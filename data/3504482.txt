<!--ALL IMAGES FAIR USE: The subject of the article is a fictional foodstuff.  All images can not be replaced by copyleft alternatives because such alternatives cannot exist.-->In the [[fictional universe]] of ''[[Babylon 5]]'', '''spoo''' is a valuable and highly desired food product. Made from the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[worm|worm-like]] creatures of the same name, spoo is considered to be the most delicious food in the [[Milky Way|galaxy]], regardless of which species is asked. Although it is a universally loved foodstuff and an actively traded [[commodity]], the creature itself is regarded with contempt by the races that consume it. 

Since its introduction on the ''Babylon 5'' television series, spoo has remained popular among fans of the [[space opera|science fiction saga]], spawning everything from attempts to cook their own version of spoo, to [[fan fiction]] related to the creatures. "Spoo" is also used variously outside the ''Babylon 5'' universe and fan community as a nonsense word.

The ''Babylon 5'' episodes in which spoo appears or is mentioned are "[[Midnight on the Firing Line]]," "[[The Geometry of Shadows]]," "[[Point of No Return (Babylon 5)|Point of No Return]]", "[[A View from the Gallery]]," "[[A Tragedy of Telepaths]]," and "[[Meditations on the Abyss]]."  Spoo also appears in the "Over There" segment of the ''[[Babylon 5: The Lost Tales|Lost Tales]]'' episode "[[Babylon_5:_The_Lost_Tales#Voices_in_the_Dark|Voices in the Dark]]."

===Explanation of Spoo===
[[Image:Midnight Spoo copy lite.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[G'Kar]] offering [[Londo Mollari|Londo]] a plate of fresh spoo from the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[Midnight on the Firing Line]]".]]<!--Fair use rationale: Image clearly "identifies [...] program and its contents," where the focal point of the scene is the subject of the article --> 

After several years of cryptic answers, Straczynski finally made a post explaining what Spoo was. His answer stated that spoo were tiny, pasty, [[mealworm]]-like creatures that were 
regarded with contempt by most of the [[Civilizations in Babylon 5|sentient species that have encountered it]]. According to Straczynski, spoo "are the only creatures of which the Interstellar Animal Rights Protection League says, simply, 'Kill 'em.'"<ref name="JMSspoopost"/>

The process of raising spoo was described by Straczynski in comical detail. The creatures are raised on ranches on planets with moist and chilly [[climate]]s, not because the creatures thrive in such environs, but because it produces the best level of paleness in the creatures' skin. Starting a spoo ranch is relatively easy: the only requirement is to place 200 spoo in the middle of the ranch and wait. Within a short period of time, they have reproduced in sufficient numbers and harvesting can commence, with the preferred method being a simple whack with a stick. Little physical effort is required to cull the herds—spoo are incapable of moving more than six&nbsp;inches (15&nbsp;cm) in a year, tend to stay propped up against one another "ostensibly for mutual protection," with attempts at movement usually ending up in the creatures toppling over. The primary difficulty in spoo ranching is in the only sound the creatures make: loud, continuous sighing. The only protection against the sighing is the use of earmuffs, which eventually cannot block the sheer volume of sighs as the harvest progresses—when whacked, a spoo simply sighs more loudly.  The sighing often triggers bouts of [[major depression]], with some ranchers even going [[insanity|mad]] from the incessant sighs.<ref name="JMSspoopost"/>

===Spoo in the series===
[[Image:Spoo Close Up 3 lite.jpg|thumb|right|202px|Spoo close-up.]]<!--Fair use rationale: Image clearly "identifies [...] program and its contents," where the focal point of the scene is the subject of the article --> 

Although mostly relegated to a background role, spoo was once involved in a significant way in a plot. In the season 5 episode ''[[A Tragedy of Telepaths]]'', the fact that Narn prefer fresh spoo while the [[Centauri]] prefer it aged was the reason that [[G'Kar]] was able to figure out that there was another Narn in the Centauri Royal Palace.<ref name=Tragedy>"[[A Tragedy of Telepaths]]," written by Straczynski. See its [[Lurker's Guide]] page at [http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/098.html midwinter.com.] Retrieved on [[2007-08-11]].</ref>

As befitting a fan-favorite reference, Spoo made a number of appearances in the series, most recently in the DVD release ''[[Babylon 5: The Lost Tales]]'', where [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|President Sheridan]] at one point jokes that the product is "Spoo: The other gray meat."<ref name=OverThere> From the ''[[Babylon 5: The Lost Tales|Lost Tales]]'' episode "[[Babylon_5:_The_Lost_Tales#Voices_in_the_Dark|Voices in the Dark]]" by Straczynski.</ref> 

===Commodity===
As a widely consumed food product, like coffee or beef, spoo is a traded commodity, where the price of the product at the consumer level is dictated by the price on common [[stock exchange|exchanges]]. During one episode the price of a spoo sandwich is stated as ten [[Fictional currency|credits]] an ounce; at the end of the same episode it is stated as fifteen credits.<ref name=Gallery>Spoo is a conversation piece in the episode "[[A View from the Gallery]]," written by Straczynski from a story by [[Harlan Ellison]] and Straczynski. See its [[Lurker's Guide]] page at [http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/092.html midwinter.com.]  Retrieved on [[2007-08-11]].</ref> While this could be a simple mistake by Straczynski, a bit of [[Fanon (fiction)|fanon]] assumes that it is an intentional reference to spoo's exorbitant volatility in the market.<ref name=LurkersNote>This view is expressed in the "Notes" section of the [[Lurker's Guide]] page for the episode at [http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/092.html#NO midwinter.com.]  Retrieved on [[2007-08-11]].</ref>

Unlike other products, not only is spoo a tradable commodity, but spoo ranches themselves, like large corporations, sell shares.<ref name=Geometry>In the episode "[[The Geometry of Shadows]]," a [[Technomage]] infected [[Londo Mollari|Londo's]] personal computers with a [[Computer virus|virus]] that converted all his personal finances into a purchase of 200,000 [[share (finance)|shares]] in a spoo ranch.</ref> It is not known if this is facilitated by spoo's immense popularity or because the ranches' value is exacerbated by their rarity (due to the difficulty of, and disproportionately high suicide rate in, spoo ranching).

==Real-world spoo==
In 1998, Boxtree UK published a ''Babylon 5'' cookbook, officially licensed from Warner Bros.<ref name=cookbook>{{cite book| title=Dining on ''Babylon 5'': Human Edition - The Ultimate Collection of Space Station Cuisine| first=Emerson| last=Briggs-Wallace| coauthors=Smith, Steve| id=ISBN 0-7522-1143-9| location=UK| year=June 1998}}</ref> Presented as if written around the year 2260, the time when most of the ''Babylon 5'' series takes place, the book contains many recipes for the various foods mentioned and seen throughout the series. Included were recipes for Narn-style spoo and Centauri-style spoo, both using currently available ingredients, with sea [[scallops]] taking the place of spoo. 

Many fans have attempted to make "spoo" on their own. One common method is the use of [[tofu]], itself a rather versatile and nondescript food with a pale color. There have been times when Straczynski has been eating at a restaurant or event, and a fan will send over a plate of food, christened "spoo."<ref name=SpooPlate>This anecdote was mentioned as an aside in a GEnie post from [[September 4]] [[1996]].

==Real-world etymology of the word==

Straczynski was not the first person to use the word spoo - uses can be found in [[popular culture]] since the 1970s, sometimes as a replacement for ''stuff'', as was the case with its first recorded use on USENET in 1989,<ref name=spoofirst>The first USENET occurrence was [[July 28]], [[1989]] - See the post archived via [[Google]] at [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/sci.physics/msg/7379a1827e328633?dmode=source&hl=en sci.physics.]  Retrieved on [[2007-08-11]].</ref> and later as a misspelling of ''spew''. The earliest known print usage was as an exclamation in a 1971 [[Beetle Bailey]] comic strip, as a play on the reverse spelling of "oops."<ref name=BeetleSpoo>''[[Beetle Bailey]]'', [[April 18]] [[1971]], as reproduced in [[Mort Walker]], ''I'll Throw the Book at You, Beetle Bailey'' (New York: Tempo/[[Grosset & Dunlap]], 1973, ISBN 0-448-05582-1).</ref> In 1979 [[Barnes & Barnes]] recorded the song "Three Drunk Newts" which begins with what has been interpreted as the two of them yelling "Spoo!". According to ''Slang and Euphemism'', ''spoo'' is a slang term for [[ejaculate]], etymologically derived from ''spew'', and cited by linguist [[Pamela Munro]] in a paper on 1980s collegiate slang at [[UCLA]].<ref name=UCLA>From "UCLA slang: a dictionary of slang words and expressions used at UCLA," (Volume 1 of the UCLA Slang series), ''UCLA Occasional Papers in Linguistics'' No. 8 (1989), by F.

Retrieved on [[2007-08-13]]. </ref> One [[blog|blogger]] claims to have had ''spoo'' attached to him as a nickname in the mid-1980s on various [[Bulletin board system|message boards]], rejecting Straczynski's popularization of the term, although Straczynski's first use of the word predates his.<ref name=Spoonet>  For the blogger who claims to have created ''spoo'', see the main page at [http://www.spoo.net/who/ spoo.net].  Retrieved on [[2007-08-11]]</ref>  [[Frank Zappa]] used the word as a euphemism for semen in the song "What Kind of Girl?", which appears on the 1988 live album ''[[Broadway the Hard Way]]''. He claimed in ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'' to have learned the word from guitarist Ike Willis, and also used ''spoo'' to mean self-indulgent "musical [[masturbation]]," in which musicians play an extended solo primarily for their own enjoyment rather than to enhance the musical experience of the audience.<ref name=Zappa>{{cite book| title=The Real Frank Zappa Book| first=Frank| last=Zappa| coauthors=Occhiogrosso, Peter| id=ISBN 0-318-41476-7| year=June 1989| publisher=Poseidon Press}}<!--If anyone has the page number for this specific cite, please add it here.--></ref>

Straczynski's own usage of the word predates ''Babylon 5''. Straczynski was a writer in the 1985 cartoon series ''[[She-Ra|She-Ra Princess of Power]]''. After a fan recalled a possible spoo reference from that show, Straczynski replied, "[Yes], I slipped some spoo in there once.

===Current usage===
Since its advent and popularization in ''Babylon 5'', some people in the [[science fiction fandom|science fiction community]] have used the term "spoo space" on online message boards instead of [[spoiler (media)|spoiler space]].<ref name=SpooSpace> Internet example at [http://boards.theforce.net/eu_community/b10194/7432408/p3 Jedi Council Forums], and numerous USENET examples can be attained via a Google search, (linked at [http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?q=%22spoo%20space%22&hl=en&lr=&sa=N&tab=wg Google groups]).
