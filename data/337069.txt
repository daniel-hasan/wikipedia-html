'''Herne Bay''' is a seaside town in [[Kent]], [[South East England|South East]] [[England]], with a population of 35,188. On the south coast of the [[Thames Estuary]], it is {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} north of [[Canterbury]] and {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} east of [[Whitstable]]. It neighbours the ancient villages of [[Herne, Kent|Herne]] and [[Reculver]] and is part of the [[City of Canterbury]] local government district. Herne Bay's seafront is home to the world's first freestanding purpose-built clock tower, built in 1837; until 1978, the town had the second-longest pier in the [[United Kingdom]].

The town began as a small shipping community, receiving goods and passengers from London en route to Canterbury and [[Dover]]. The town rose to prominence as a seaside resort during the early 19th century after the building of a pleasure pier and promenade by a group of London investors, and reached its heyday in the late Victorian era. Its popularity as a holiday destination has declined over the past decades, due to the increase in foreign travel and regular flooding that has prevented the town's redevelopment. However, the recent renovation of the [[sea defences]] and seafront is expected to re-establish the town as a popular seaside resort.

==History==
The town of Herne Bay derived its name from the neighbouring village of Herne, two kilometres inland from the bay. The word herne, meaning a place on a corner of land, evolved from the Old English ''hyrne'', meaning corner. The village was first recorded in around 1100 as Hyrnan. The ''corner'' may relate to the sharp turn in the [[Roman Road]] between Canterbury and [[Reculver]] at Herne.<ref name="place names">{{cite web  | title = Kent place names  | publisher = bbc.co.uk | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/places/names/names_h.shtml  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>

One of the oldest buildings in Herne Bay is the late 18th-century inn, The Ship, which served as the focal point for the small shipping and farming community which first inhabited the town. During this time, passenger and cargo boats regularly ran between Herne Bay and London, and boats carrying coal ran from [[Newcastle]]. From Herne there was easy access by road to the city of Canterbury, or to Dover, where further passage by boat could then be obtained across the [[English Channel]] to France.<ref name="Appraisal">{{cite web | title = Herne Bay Conservation Area Appraisal  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/assets/conservation/HerneBayAppraisal2006.pdf |format = PDF | date= [[2006-10-06]]| accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>

The 1801 census recorded Herne Bay, including Herne, as having a population of 1,232.<ref name="KAS">{{cite web  | title = Population of Kent 1801 to 1921  | publisher = Kent Archaeological Society | url = http://www.kentarchaeology.org.uk/Research/03/03/05/358.htm  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> During the early 1800s, a smugglers' gang operated from the town.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Smuggler's Britain  | publisher = Smuggling.com | url = http://www.smuggling.co.uk/gazetteer_se_12.html  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> The gang were regularly involved in a series of fights with the preventive services until finally being overpowered in the 1820s.<ref name="KAS"/> In the 1830s, a group of London investors, who recognised Herne Bay's potential as a seaside resort, built a wooden pier and a promenade on the town's seafront. This and the subsequent building of a railway station led to the rapid expansion of the town; between 1831 and 1841 the town's population grew from 1,876 to 3,041.<ref name="KAS"/> The London businessmen intended to rename the town St Augustine's, but the name was unpopular with residents and the "Herne Bay" remained.<ref name="mini">{{cite web  | title = Herne Bay Mini History  | publisher = Herne Bay Town Partners | url = http://www.hernebaytp.co.uk/local_attractions.php  | accessdate = 2007-05-29 }}</ref> In 1833, an Act of Parliament established Herne Bay and Herne as separate towns.<ref name="connecting">{{cite web  | title = Connecting Herne Bay  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/assets/localplan/ConnectingHerneBayweb.pdf  |format = PDF | date = January 2006| accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> Local landowner Sir Henry Oxenden donated a piece of ground for the site of the town's first church,<ref name="pigot">{{cite web  | title = Pigots 1840 -- Herne Bay and Herne Street  | publisher = Pigots | url = http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~shebra/pigots_1840_-_herne_bay_&_herne_street.htm |date = 1840 | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> Christ Church, which was opened in 1834.<ref name="Appraisal"/> In 1837, Mrs Ann Thwaytes, a wealthy lady from London, donated around Â£4,000 to build a {{convert|75|ft|m|0}} clock tower on the town's seafront.<ref name="pigot"/> It is believed to be the first freestanding purpose built clock tower in the world.<ref name="Appraisal"/>

During the 1840s, steamboats began running between Herne Bay and London. There was a type of beach boat unique to Herne Bay and nearby [[Thanet]], known as the Thanet [[wherry]],<ref>{{cite web  | title = The Chatham Directory of Inshore Craft  | publisher = ThamesBarge.org.uk | url = http://www.thamesbarge.org.uk/barges/models/chathamplans.html  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> a narrow pulling boat about {{convert|18|ft|m|0}} long. These boats were mainly used for fishing; however, with the advent of tourism and the decline of fishing, they became mainly used for pleasure trips. A document dated 1840 records the town as having the following schools, all of which are now defunct: Haddington boarding school, Oxenden House, British School, Prospect Place and Herne Street school.<ref name="pigot"/> The village of Herne was often called Herne Street around this time. The same document also mentions the still-existing Rodney Head, The Ship and Upper Red Lion inns.

The original wooden pier had to be dismantled in 1871 after its owners went into liquidation and sea worms had damaged the wood.<ref name="hbpier">{{cite web  | title = Herne Bay Pier | last=Gough|first=Harrold| publisher = Association Of Hotels, Business and Leisure | url = http://www.hernebaypier.co.uk/history.htm  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> A shorter {{convert|100|m|ft|0}} long iron pier with a theatre and shops at the entrance was built in 1873.<ref name="heritage">{{cite web | title = Herne Bay Pier | publisher = The Heritage Trail | url = http://www.theheritagetrail.co.uk/piers/herne%20bay%20pier.htm  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> However, it was too short for steamboats to land at. The pier proved to be unprofitable and a replacement longer iron pier with an electric tram began to be built in 1896. At {{convert|3600|ft|m|0}}, this pier was the second longest in the country, behind only the pier at [[Southend-on-Sea]].<ref name="Appraisal"/>

[[Image:The landward end of Herne Bay pier.jpg|right|thumb|The landward end of Herne Bay pier]]
The town's heyday as a seaside resort was during the late Victorian era; the population nearly doubled from 4,410 to 8,442 between 1881 and 1901.<ref name="KAS"/> Much of the resulting late Victorian seafront architecture is still in existence today. In 1910, a pavilion was added to the landward end of the pier.<ref name="heritage"/> In 1912, the first "Brides in the Bath" murder by [[George Joseph Smith]] was committed in Herne Bay.<ref>{{cite web  | title = 'Brides in the Bath' murders  | publisher = Metropolitan Police Service | url = http://www.met.police.uk/history/brides.htm  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> By 1931, the town's population had grown to 14,533. At the beginning of [[World War II]], the army cut two gaps between the landward end of the pier and the seaward terminal as a counter-invasion measure. The pier was restored however after the war.<ref name="hbpier"/> During World War II, a [[Maunsell Forts|sea-fort]] was built off the coast of Herne Bay and Whitstable, which is still in existence. The coastal village of Reculver, to the east of Herne Bay, was the site of the testing of the [[bouncing bomb]] used by the "[[The Dam Busters (film)|Dam Busters]]" during the war.<ref name="mini">{{cite web  | title = Herne Bay, a mini history  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.co.uk/cgi-bin/buildpage.pl?mysql=326  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> 

1963 marked the end of steamboat services from the pier.<ref name="hbpier"/> In 1970, a fire destroyed the pier's pavilion and plans began to replace it with a sports centre,<ref name="hbpier"/> which was opened in 1976 by former Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]].<ref name="hbpier"/> The centre section of the pier was torn down by a storm in 1978, leaving the end of the pier isolated out at sea.<ref name="heritage"/> It has not been rebuilt due to the cost; however, residents and businesses in the town have campaigned for its restoration.

==Governance==
Since 1983, the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[North Thanet]], covering northern [[Thanet]] and Herne Bay, has been the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Roger Gale]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], the Conservatives won a majority of 7,634 and 49.6% of the vote in North Thanet. [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] won 32.2% of the vote, [[Liberal Democrats]] 14.4% and [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] 3.9%.<ref>{{cite web  | title = North Thanet  | publisher = Guardian.co.uk | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0,,-1183,00.html  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>

Herne Bay, along with Whitstable and Canterbury, is in the [[City of Canterbury]] [[Districts of England|local government district]]. The town contains the five electoral [[Ward (politics)|wards]] of Heron, Herne and Broomfield, Greenhill and Eddington, West Bay and Reculver. These wards have thirteen of the fifty seats on the [[City of Canterbury|Canterbury]] City Council. As at the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2007|2007 local elections]], eight of those seats were held by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and five by the [[Liberal Democrats]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = Members of the Council  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/members.php?order=ward&sort=DESC  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:25012007081.jpg|right|thumb|Cloud Cover captured off the coast of Herne Bay]] Herne Bay is located at {{coord|51|22|14|N|1|7|37|E|city|display=inline}} in northeast Kent, on the coast of the [[Thames Estuary]]. The landscape of the town has been largely influenced by the Plenty [[stream|Brook]], which flows northward through the centre of the town and into the sea. It is thought to have been a much larger stream in ancient times. The coastline has two distinct [[bay]]s, separated by a jut of land created by silt from the outflow of the brook into the sea. The first buildings in the town were built along the east bay, a short distance from the brook outflow, where the road from [[Canterbury]] met the sea. The town has since spread across both bays, across the Plenty Brook valley and onto the relatively high land flanking both sides of the valley. The land to the east of the valley reaches a height of twenty-five metres above sea level and to the west reaches ten metres. Cliffs are formed where this high land meets the sea. <ref name="Appraisal"/>

[[Image:The end of Herne Bay's Pier.jpg|right|thumb|The seaward end of Herne Bay pier, now isolated out at sea]][[Image:07072007197.jpg|right|thumb|Sunset captured off Herne Bay's Coast]]
The rising land beside the coast, between the valley and the eastern cliffs, is known as 'The Downs' (no relation to the [[North Downs|North]] or [[South Downs]]). This area has been named a Site of Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area for Birds. The whole of the north east Kent coast has been designated a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]. The [[geology]] of the town consists mainly of [[London Clay]], overlaid with brickearth in the west. The sand and clay of The Downs are subject to [[landslip]]s.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Nature On The Map  | publisher = Natural England | url = http://www.natureonthemap.org.uk/map.aspx?m=nreserves  | accessdate = 2007-03-30 }}</ref><ref name="Appraisal"/>

The Plenty Brook now passes through the town's drainage system, allowing buildings to be built over the top.<ref name="Appraisal"/> The brook has been prone to flooding during heavy rain, especially in inland areas, which regularly causes problems for people living in the Eddington area in southern Herne Bay.<ref name="brook">{{cite web  | title = Flooding from the Plenty Brook at Herne Bay.  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/cgi-bin/buildpage.pl?mysql=2285  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>

Stormy weather can cause the sea level by the coast to rise by up to two metres. In the past, this has caused disastrous [[flood]]ing in the town, the worst in the town's history being in 1953. Coastal defences were subsequently constructed including [[groyne]]s, [[sea wall]]s and [[shingle beach]]. In the 1990s, these defences were deemed to be inadequate and an offshore [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], now known as Neptune's Arm, was built to protect the most vulnerable areas of the town.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Coastal Management Herne Bay Sea Defences  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/cgi-bin/buildpage.pl?mysql=155  | accessdate = 2007-03-30 }}</ref>

As of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 UK census]], Herne Bay area [[Ward (politics)|wards]] had a population of 35,188 and a population density of 11.3 persons per [[hectare]].<ref name="Statistics.gov.uk">{{cite web  | title = Neighbourhood Statistics  | publisher = Statistics.gov.uk | url = http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadHome.do;jsessionid=ac1f930bce6a711447e60ba4446bb56c21648d42c51.e38PbNqOa3qRe38OaNeKahqMai1ynknvrkLOlQzNp65In0?bhcp=1  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>

Of the town's 14,732 households, 48.7% were married couples living together, 8.4% were [[Cohabitation|cohabiting]] couples and 8.3% were lone parents. 30.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 20.5% had someone living alone at pensionable age. 27.7% of households included children aged under 16 or a person aged 16 to 18 who was in full-time education. The average household size was 2.74.

The ethnicity of the town was 98.5% white, 0.6% mixed race, 0.4% Asian, 0.2% black and 0.3% Chinese or other. The place of birth of residents was 96.3% United Kingdom, 0.6% Republic of Ireland, 0.3% Germany, 0.6% other Western Europe countries, 0.2% Eastern Europe, 0.6% Africa, 0.3% Far East, 0.3% South Asia, 0.2% Middle East, 0.2% North America and 0.2% Oceania.

For every 100 females, there were 89.9 males. The age distribution was 6% aged 0â4 years, 14% aged 5â15 years, 4% aged 16â19 years, 29% aged 20â44 years, 25% aged 45â64 years and 22% aged 65 years and over. The town had a high percentage of residents over 65, compared with the national average of 16%. As a seaside town, Herne Bay is a popular retirement destination; many modern retirement complexes are located near the seafront. 

The economic activity of residents aged 16â74 was 36% in full-time employment, 13% in part-time employment, 9% self-employed, 3% unemployed, 2% students with jobs, 3% students without jobs, 18% retired, 7% looking after home or family, 6% permanently sick or disabled and 2% economically inactive for other reasons. This was roughly in line with the national figures, except for the number of people in retirement. This figure nationally was significantly lower at 14%. Of the town's residents aged 16â74, 12% had a [[higher education]] qualification or the equivalent, compared with 20% nationwide. According to [[Office for National Statistics]] estimates, during the period of April 2001 to March 2002 the average gross weekly income of households in the Herne Bay area was Â£516 (Â£26,906 per year).<ref name="Statistics.gov.uk"/>

==Economy==
[[Image:Guest houses on Herne Bay seafront.jpg|left|thumb|Guest houses on Herne Bay seafront]]
The advent of overseas travel and changes to holiday trends eventually caused the town's economy to decline after the 1960s; regular flooding of the Plenty Brook prevented redevelopment of the town centre.<ref name="connecting"/> However, extensive seafront regeneration in the 1990s followed the creation of the Neptune's Arm sea defence jetty. The jetty has created a small harbour used by leisure boats and from where tourists can take sailing yacht trips to a seal-watching site in the Thames estuary. The Victorian gardens on the seafront were then able to be fully restored. The Central Bandstand, built in 1924, was refurbished after years of disrepair and closure to the public. A swimming pool and cinema were added to the town centre in the early 1990s. In 2005, a wind-farm with thirty 2.75&nbsp;MW wind turbines was built {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} off the coast of Herne Bay and Whitstable, generating a total of 82.5&nbsp;MW of electricity. The recent upgrades by the Council have helped improve the image of the town and raise its profile. It is hoped this will attract new investment in tourism and business by the private sector, and lead to the regeneration of the town's economy.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Thirty NEG Micon offshore wind turbines for Kentish Flats in the UK | publisher = Vestas | url = http://www.vestas.com/vestas/global/en/Press/News/News/NEGMicon/Press_release/NMPR_201103.htm.htm  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref><ref name="planning">{{cite web  | title = Planning in Herne Bay.  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/cgi-bin/buildpage.pl?mysql=644  | accessdate = 2007-04-01 }}</ref>

In 2006, Canterbury City Council began a public consultation to discuss the regeneration. A concern raised by the council is that the shopping centre is incoherent and fails to attract the tourists that come for the seafront. Other issues raised are the lack of holiday accommodation, car parks and clear pedestrian routes between the three main attractions in the town: the seafront, Memorial park and shopping centre. The council is considering relocating the sports centre from the pier and replacing it with other tourist attractions.<ref name="connecting"/><ref name="planning"/>

As of the 2001 census, the industry of employment of residents of Herne Bay was 19% retail, 14% health and social work, 11% manufacturing, 10% construction, 9% real estate, 8% education, 8% transport and communications, 5% public administration, 5% hotels and restaurants, 4% finance, 1% agriculture and 5% other community, social or personal services. Compared to national figures, the town had a relatively high number of workers in the construction and health/social care industries and a relatively low number in manufacturing and real estate.<ref name="Statistics.gov.uk"/> Many residents commute to work outside the town. As of the 2001 UK census, 14,711 of the town's residents were in employment, whereas there were only 8,104 jobs within the town.<ref name="Statistics.gov.uk"/>

One of the largest employers is the centrally located supermarket, which as of January 2006 was considering further expansion. It is one of the major attractions to the town's shopping centre, however there are fears that its expansion could lead it to become too dominant, at the cost of smaller shops in the town.<ref name="connecting"/> Apart from tourism and retail, many jobs are also provided in the manufacturing industry, mainly located in industrial estates on the outskirts of the town,<ref>{{cite web  | title = Business Parks and Industrial Estates  | publisher = Canterbury City Council | url = http://www.business.canterbury.gov.uk/buildpage.php?id=21  | accessdate = 2007-04-17 }}</ref> which produce goods such as kitchen furniture<ref>{{cite web  | title = Crown Products contact  | publisher = Crown Imperial | url = http://www.crown-imperial.co.uk/contactcrown.asp  | accessdate = 2007-04-17 }}</ref> and factory machinery.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Flexicon office Locator  | publisher = Flexicon | url = http://www.flexicon.com/us/Offices/index.asp?Continent=Europe&CountryID=184&repID=33  | accessdate = 2007-04-17 }}</ref> A high number of construction jobs have been created by redevelopment of the seafront, which is expected to continue with the proposed regeneration of the town centre.<ref name="connecting"/> The elderly population of the town has led to many health and social care jobs at local care homes and at the town's Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital.<ref name="Hospital">{{cite web  | title = Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital  | publisher = NHS | url = http://www.kentandmedway.nhs.uk/local_nhs_services/hospitals/queen_victoria_memorial_hospital.asp  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> As of the 2001 census, 1.9% of the town's population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.<ref name="Statistics.gov.uk"/>

Landmarks by the seafront include the clock tower, the sea defence jetty, the off-shore World War II sea fort and the off-shore wind farm. There are seaside cafÃ©s, fresh seafood restaurants, guesthouses, beach huts and numerous water-sports facilities.

The Memorial Park, situated near the centre of the town, incorporates a children's play area, a large shallow duck pond often used for remote control boats, basketball and tennis courts and a large expanse of grass for field games. The park has a monument and an 'Avenue of Remembrance' as memorials to the town's residents killed during the two world wars.
