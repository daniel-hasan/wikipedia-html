'''George Robert Gleig''' ([[20 April]] [[1796]] &ndash; [[9 July]] [[1888]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] soldier and military writer.

Gleig was born in [[Stirling]]. His parents were [[George Gleig]] ([[1753]] &ndash; [[1840]]), Bishop of [[Brechin]] from October [[1808]]) and Janet, nee Hamilton.

On [[1813-06-21]], [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] had his first victory in [[Spain]] over the [[France|French]], at the battle of [[Vitoria]].  One month later a young student of divinity, George Robert Gleig, gave up a scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] to join Wellington’s army as an Ensign in the [[85th Foot|85th Light Infantry]].  His father, by then Bishop of Brechin, furnished him with £20, a substantial sum, though he notes that the rate at which he could buy readily exchangeable gold coins was poor — he had to pay 6s for every gold dollar, and £5 for a doubloon.  On 7 October Wellington crossed into France for the first time.

On 6 April 1814, [[Napoléon]] abdicated, though Wellington did not find out until the 12th.  By then, on 10 April he had fought and won the decisive battle of the war at [[Toulouse]].  The young divinity student was then sent to the war against the [[United States]], where he fought in five battles ([[Battle of Bladensburg|Bladensburg]], [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]], [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[Fort Bayo]]) and was three times wounded;  after peace broke out he resumed his scholarship at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in 1816. 

At the [[Battle of Baltimore]], in which Gleig saw action, the British army took prisoners including one [[Francis Scott Key]].  Key witnessed his captors’ bombardment of [[Fort McHenry]]; next morning he found that the Fort’s large flag was still flying.  He was familiar with the old English tune ''[[To Anacreon in Heaven]]'';  the flying flag inspired him to write a poem, to fit the tune.  His song was immediately popular with Americans, and was adopted by Congress as the national anthem in 1931, as ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]''.  Napoléon Buonaparte meanwhile was sent to [[Elba]].  

Gleig married in 1819, while at Oxford.  Having taken his B.A. and M.A., the young Gleig took holy orders in 1820.  He became curate of [[Westwell, Kent]], and was later appointed to two additional parishes, as curate of [[Ash (near Sandwich)|Ash]] and as Rector of [[Ivychurch]].  He wrote a series of articles for [[Blackwood’s Magazine]] on his [[Peninsular War]] experiences;  they were collected into a book, published in 1825:  “The Subaltern”.  In 1827 he published an account of his experiences in the USA as "The Campaigns of the British Army at Washington and New Orleans". In 1829 he was invited to meet Wellington, and became a regular house-guest of the Duke.

In 1832 George Robert Gleig, by then Chaplain to the [[Chelsea Hospital]] — the [[Chelsea Pensioners]] — and a well-known author, mainly on military matters, publicly opposed the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]] before Parliament.

Gleig had excellent relations with the Duke of Wellington, but that did not stop the [[Iron Duke]] from issuing a public reprimand in 1840 to Gleig for his plan to educate NCOs and private soldiers:
:''By Jove!  If there is a mutiny in the army – and in all probability we shall have one – you’ll see that these new-fangled schoolmasters will be at the bottom of it.''

Gleig was appointed Chaplain-General of the Forces in 1844, resigned 1875;  from 1846 to 1857 he was Inspector-General of Military Schools.

Gleig was a frequent contributor to reviews and magazines, especially ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'', in which his best-known novel, ''[[The Subaltern]]'', appeared in instalments.  He was also the author of Lives of [[Warren Hastings]], [[Robert Clive]], and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]], ''[[Military Commanders]]'', ''[[Chelsea Pensioners]]'', and other works.

He died	at [[Stratfield Turgis]], [[Hampshire]] in [[1888]].
