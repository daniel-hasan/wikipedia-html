The '''King Vulture''', ''Sarcoramphus papa'', is a large [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America|South American]] [[bird]] in the [[New World vulture]] [[family (biology)|family]] Cathartidae. This vulture lives predominantly in tropical lowland forests stretching from southern [[Mexico]] to northern [[Argentina]], though some believe that [[William Bartram|William Bartram's]] [[#Bartram's "Painted Vulture"|Painted Vulture]] of [[Florida]] may be of this species. It is the only surviving member of the genus '''''Sarcoramphus''''', though [[#Fossil record and evolution|fossil members are known]].

It is large and predominantly white, with gray to black ruff, flight, and tail [[feather|feathers]]. Its head and neck are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The King Vulture has a very noticeable yellow fleshy [[Wattle (anatomy)|carnucle]] on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World Vulture species from a carcass. King Vultures have been known to live for up to 30 years in captivity.

King Vultures were popular figures in the [[Mayan codices]] as well as in local folklore and medicine. Though currently listed as Least Concern by the [[IUCN]], they are declining in number, due primarily to [[habitat loss]].

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The King Vulture was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the tenth edition of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' as ''Gyparchus papa''.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. Tomus I. Editio decima, reformata. | publisher=Holmiae. (Laurentii Salvii). | date=1758| pages=824}}</ref> It was reassigned to the genus ''Sarcoramphus'' in 1805 by [[André Marie Constant Duméril]]. This genus is often misspelled as ''Sarcorhamphus''. The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''sarco-''/σαρκο- "flesh" and ''ramphos''/ραμφος "crooked beak of bird of prey."<ref> {{cite book|last=Liddell| first=Henry George|coauthor=Robert Scott|year=1980|title=Greek-English Lexicon, Abridged Edition |publisher=Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 0-19-910207-4}}</ref> The King Vulture's closest living relative is the [[Andean Condor]], ''Vultur gryphus''.<ref name=" taxonomy ">{{Citation| last = Amadon| first = Dean| title = Notes on the Taxonomy of Vultures| journal = Condor| volume = 79  | issue =4| pages = 413–416| year = 1977 | url =http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Condor/files/issues/v079n04/p0413-p0416.pdf }}</ref> Some authors have even put these species in a separate subfamily from the other New World Vultures, though most authors consider this subdivision unnecessary.<ref name="taxonomy"/>

There are two theories on how the King Vulture earned the "King" part of its common name. The first is that the name is a reference to its habit of displacing smaller vultures from a carcass and eating its fill while they wait.<ref name=" Grosset ">{{cite web | title = King Vulture (Sarcoramphus papa)| author=Grosset, Arthur | publisher = | url = http://www.arthurgrosset.com/sabirds/king%20vulture.html| accessdate = 2007-09-11}}</ref> An alternative theory reports that the name is derived from [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] legends, in which the bird was a king who served as a messenger between humans and the gods.<ref name=" NGeo">{{cite web | title =King Vulture | author= | publisher = National Geographic | url = http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/king-vulture.html | accessdate = 2007-09-11}}</ref> This bird is also known as the "White Crow" by the Spanish in [[Paraguay]].<ref name=" Wood"> {{cite book | last = Wood| first =John George | title =The illustrated natural history | publisher =Oxford University| date= 1862| url =http://books.google.com/books?id=BEwDAAAAQAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=King+Vulture}}</ref>

The exact [[systematic]] placement of the King Vulture and the remaining six species of [[New World Vulture]]s remains unclear.<ref name="SACC"/> Though both are similar in appearance and have similar [[Ecological niche|ecological roles]], the New World and [[Old World Vultures]] evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to [[storks]].<ref>[[Charles Sibley|Sibley, Charles G.]] and Burt L.

===Fossil record and evolution===
The genus ''Sarcoramphus'', which today contains only the King Vulture, had a wider distribution in the past. The '''Kern Vulture''', '''''Sarcoramphus kernense''''' lived in southwestern [[North America]] during the mid-[[Pliocene]] ([[Piacenzian]]), some 3.5-2.5 million years ago). It was a little-known component of the [[Blancan]]/[[Delmontian]] [[faunal stage]]s. The only material is a broken [[distal]] [[humerus]] [[fossil]], found at [[Pozo Creek]], [[Kern County, California]]. As per [[Loye H. Miller]]'s original description, "[c]ompared with [''S. papa''] the [[type (biology)|type]] conforms in general form and curvature except for its greater size and robustness."<ref name = miller1931>Miller, Loye H. (1931): Bird Remains from the Kern River Pliocene of California. ''[[Condor (journal)|Condor]]'' '''33'''(2): 70–72. [http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Condor/files/issues/v033n02/p0070-p0072.pdf PDF fulltext]</ref> The large span in time between the existence of the two species suggests that the Kern Vulture might be distinct, but as the fossil is somewhat damaged and rather non-diagnostic, even assignment to this genus is not completely certain.<ref>Fisher, Harvey L. (1944): The skulls of the Cathartid vultures. ''[[Condor (journal)|Condor]]'' '''46''': 272–296. [http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Condor/files/issues/v046n06/p0272-p0296.pdf PDF fulltext]</ref>

During the [[Late Pleistocene]], another species probably assignable to the genus, '''''Sarcoramphus fisheri''''', occurred in [[Peru]]. This would have been the [[chronospecies]] ancestral to the present-day King Vulture, or possibly a [[sister species]]. Few [[avian]] species of today [[evolve]]d after that time, and of those that did most are small, short-lived [[Passeriformes]].

A supposed King Vulture relative from [[Quaternary]] cave deposits on [[Cuba]] turned out to be the remains of the giant [[eagle]] ''[[Titanohierax borrasi]]''.<ref>Suárez, William (2001): A Re-evaluation of Some Fossils Identified as Vultures (Aves: Vulturidae) from Quaternary Cave Deposits of Cuba. ''[[Caribbean Journal of Science|Caribb. J. Sci.]]'' '''37'''(1–2): 110–111. [http://www.uprm.edu/publications/cjs/Vol37a/37_110-111.pdf PDF fulltext]</ref>

Little can be said of the [[evolution]]ary history of the genus, mainly because remains of other [[Neogene]] New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The [[teratorn]]s held sway over the [[ecological niche]] of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern Vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the [[Great American Interchange]], and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated out of [[Central America]]<ref name = miller1931 />. The Kern Vulture would then seem to represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the ''S. fisheri - S. papa'' lineage. Be that as it may, the fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral King Vultures and South American Condors separated at least some 5 mya.

===Bartram's "Painted Vulture"===
[[Image:KingVultureBerlin.JPG|right|thumb|King Vulture at [[Zoologischer Garten Berlin]]]]
There has been much speculation about the '''"Painted Vulture"''' ('''''"Sarcoramphus sacra"''''' or '''''"S. papa sacra"'''''){{Verify source|date=November 2007}}, a bird described in [[William Bartram]]'s notes of his travels in [[Florida]] during the [[1770s]]. The notes were considerably altered and expanded in the printed edition, possibly by an editor who had seen images of the King Vulture and believed the bird briefly and equivocally described by Bartram to be a King Vulture and therefore fleshed out the details as he saw fit.

Several researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a King Vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of [[extinct]]ion and finally disappeared during a cold spell.<ref name=" Day">Day, David (1981): ''The Doomsday Book of Animals'': Ebury, London/Viking, New York. ISBN 0-670-27987-0</ref> However, Bartram saw his "Painted Vulture" in the area from which the [[Crested Caracara|Northern Crested Caracara]] was later described. This bird was common and conspicuous in Bartram's days, but it is conspicuously missing from Bartram's notes if the "Painted Vulture" is accepted as a ''Sarcoramphus''.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}<!-- ref: Bartram notebook, Peter's Checklist or HBW Crested Caracara article -->

While the original notes are somewhat ambiguous regarding the appearance of the bird, the description does fit that of a caracara. The birds' behavior, as recorded by Bartram, is in complete agreement with the caracara's. For example, Bartram observed the birds following [[wildfire]]s to scavenge for burned insects and [[box turtle]]s. Such behavior is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged King Vultures are not well adapted for walking. However, the fact that Bartram cannot have missed the caracara but does not mention it is the most convincing piece of evidence against the theory that this bird was a King Vulture subspecies or relative.<ref name="Day"/>{{Verify source|date=November 2007}}<!-- I think Day maintains it *is* a KV relative. First part is referrable to Bartram's notes or entire para is referable to publication discussing the issue; some article from The Auk does IIRC -->

Despite its bill and large size, It is relatively unaggressive at a kill and will normally back down rather than fight.<ref name="ADW"/> The King Vulture lacks a [[Syrinx (biology)|voice box]], though it can make low croaking noises and wheezing sounds.<ref name="Who"/> Its only natural predators are [[snake]]s, which will prey upon the vulture's eggs and young, and large cats such as [[jaguar]]s, which may surprise and kill an adult vulture at a carcass.<ref name="ADW"/>

===Diet===
The King Vulture feeds solely on carrion and, unlike some New World Vultures, is not known to kill sick or dying animals for food.<ref name="ADW"/> It often eats stranded [[fish]] along river banks, but does not come to village refuse dumps for food.<ref name="HC"/> Though it has keen eyesight which can help it locate food,<ref name="Belize"/> there are two theories regarding how it specifically finds carrion. Some argue that it uses its [[olfaction|sense of smell ]] to find animal carcasses.<ref name=" Honolulu "/><ref name="Belize"/> Others argue that it does not have a sense of smell, and instead follows the smaller [[Turkey Vulture]]s and [[Greater Yellow-headed Vulture]]s, which do have a sense of smell, to a carcass.<ref name=" Grosset "/><ref name="ADW"/><ref name="Strike ">{{cite paper| author =Beason, Robert C.| title = Through a Birds Eye: Exploring Avian Sensory Perception|publisher =University of Nebraska| date= 2003| url =http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=birdstrike2003| format = pdf| accessdate = 2007-09-11}}</ref> A recent study demonstrated that the King Vulture could find carrion in the forest without the aid of other vultures, suggesting that it locates food using a sense of smell.<ref name=" Foraging ">{{Citation| last = Lemon| first = William C| title = Foraging behavior of a guild of Neotropical vultures| journal = Wilson Bulletin| volume = 103| issue = 4| pages = 698–702| date= December| year =1991| url = http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Wilson/v103n04/p0698-p0702.pdf}}</ref> The King Vulture primarily eats carrion found in the forest, though it is know to venture onto nearby savannas in search of food.

===Reproduction===
An adult King Vulture sexually matures when it is about four or five years old.<ref name="Who"/> The birds mainly breed during the dry season.<ref name="ADW"/> The vultures give an elaborate courting display in which the pair circle each other on the ground while flapping their wings and making loud wheezing noises and snorting sounds while mating.<ref name="HC"/> King Vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white [[egg (biology)|egg]] in its nest in a hollow in a tree.<ref name=" Howell "/> To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling.<ref name="ADW"/> Both parents incubate the egg for the 32 to 38 days before it hatches.<ref name="Who"/> If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks.<ref name="HC"/> Young are [[altricial]], or helpless at birth.<ref name="ADW"/> The chick is born featherless, but quickly gains some black down feathers.<ref name="Belize"/> The chicks do not molt into their white adult plumage until they reach five or six years of age. When they are first born, the chicks are fed with meat brought to them directly from their parents’ claws, but eventually they are fed by [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]].<ref name="ADW"/>

==Conservation==
This bird is a species of Least Concern to the [[IUCN]], with an estimated range of 14,000,000&nbsp;square kilometers (5,405,430&nbsp;sq mi) and between 10,000 and 100,000 wild individuals. However, there is evidence that suggests a decline in population, though it is not significant enough to cause it to be listed.<ref name="BirdLife"/> This decline is due primarily to [[habitat destruction]] and [[poaching]].<ref name=" Eureka "/>

==Relationship with humans==
The King Vulture is one of the most common species of birds represented in the [[Mayan codices]].<ref name=" Maya"> {{cite book | last = Tozzer| first =Alfred Marston | coauthors =Glover Morrill Allen| title =Animal Figures in the Maya Codices

Rural South Americans believed that if the shadow of a King Vulture fell on a person, that person would suffer misfortune or death.<ref name="Who"/> The bird’s blood and feathers were also used to cure diseases.<ref name="Who"/> The King Vulture is also a popular subject on the stamps of the countries within its range. It appeared on a stamp for [[El Salvador]] in 1963, [[Belize]] in 1978, [[Guatemala]] in 1979, [[Honduras]] in 1997, [[Bolivia]] in 1998, and [[Nicaragua]] in 1999.<ref name="Stamp ">{{cite web | title =King Vulture | author= | publisher =Bird Stamps | url = http://www.bird-stamps.org/cspecies/2800700.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-17}}</ref>

Because of its large size and beauty, the King Vulture is an attraction at several zoos, including the [[Honolulu Zoo]], [[Belize Zoo]], and [[Zoologischer Garten Berlin]]. It breeds well in captivity,<ref name=" Honolulu "/> but the captive vultures have a tendency to kill their hatchlings.<ref name=" Eureka "/> This habit has not been observed in the wild. Determining the sex of a newborn bird in captivity is difficult due to the large amount of "baby fat" present in the first six months and the lack of [[gonad|gonadal development]] in the bird's first year.<ref name=" Eureka "/> The King Vulture is one of the few bird species with an [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|AZA]] studbook, which as of 2007 is kept by Brian Tierney of the [[Bronx Zoo]].<ref name=" AZA ">{{Citation| title = Vulture, King Studbook | year = 2007| url = http://www.aza.org/Cands/index.cfm?page=Studbook_detail&Studbook_id=1026  | accessdate = 2007-10-8 }}</ref>
