'''Houston''' (pronounced /ˈhjuːstən/) is the fourth-largest city in the [[United States|United States of America]] and the largest city within the state of [[Texas]]. As of the 2006 U.S. Census estimate, the city has a population of 2.14 million within an area of 600 square miles (1,600&nbsp;km²).  Houston is the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Harris County, Texas|Harris&nbsp;County]] and an economic center of the {{nowrap|[[Greater Houston|Houston–Sugar Land–Baytown]]}} metropolitan area—the {{nowrap|sixth-largest}} [[United States metropolitan area|metropolitan&nbsp;area]] in the U.S. with a population of more than 5.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.houston.org/media/documents/09AW025_001.pdf Current Population Estimates]|34.7&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 35598 bytes -->}}.

Houston was founded on August 30, 1836 by brothers [[Augustus Chapman Allen]] and [[John Kirby Allen]] on land near the banks of {{nowrap|[[Buffalo Bayou]]}}. The city was incorporated on June 5, 1837 and named after then-President of the [[Republic of Texas]]—former General [[Sam Houston]]—who had commanded at the [[Battle of San Jacinto|Battle of San&nbsp;Jacinto]], which took place 25&nbsp;miles (40&nbsp;km) east of where the city was established.  The burgeoning port and railroad industry, combined with oil discovery in 1901, has induced continual surges in the city's population.  In the mid-twentieth century, Houston became the home of the [[Texas Medical Center]]—the world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions—and NASA's [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]], where [[Mission Control Center]] is located.

Houston's economy has a broad industrial base in the energy, manufacturing, aeronautics, and technology; only [[New York City]] is home to more [[Fortune 500]] headquarters.  Commercially, Houston is ranked as a [[global city|world city]], and the area is a leading center for building oilfield equipment.  The [[Port of Houston]] ranks first in the United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled.<ref name="port ranking">[http://www.aapa-ports.org/files/Statistics/2004%5FUS%5FPORT%5FCARGO%5FTONNAGE%5FRANKINGS.xls U.S. Port Ranking by Cargo Volume 2004].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 601.7 square miles (1,558.4&nbsp;km²); this comprises 579.4 square miles (1,500.7&nbsp;km²) of land and 22.3 square miles (57.7&nbsp;km²) of water.

Most of Houston is located on the [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|gulf coastal plain]], and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest. Much of the city was built on forested land, marshes, swamp, or [[prairie]], which are all still visible in surrounding areas. Flatness of the local terrain, when combined with [[urban sprawl]], has made flooding a recurring problem for the city.<ref>[http://www.crwr.utexas.edu/gis/gishyd98/class/trmproj/ahrens/prepro.htm  Flood Forecasting for the Buffalo Bayou Using CRWR-PrePro and HEC-HMS].

Houston has four major [[bayou]]s passing through the city. [[Buffalo Bayou]] runs through downtown and the [[Houston Ship Channel]], and has three tributaries: [[White Oak Bayou]], which runs through the [[Houston Heights|Heights]] neighborhood and towards downtown; Braes Bayou, which runs along the [[Texas Medical Center]]; and Sims Bayou, which runs through the south of Houston and downtown Houston The ship channel continues past [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] and then into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. 

===Geology===
Underpinning Houston's land surface are [[Consolidation (geology)|unconsolidated]] clays, clay [[shale]]s, and poorly-cemented [[sand]]s up to several miles deep. The region's [[geology]] developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. These [[sediment]]s consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic matter that, over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of [[halite]], a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into [[salt dome]] formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.<ref>[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/HH/hch7.html Harris County].

However, the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves.<ref>[http://www.ig.utexas.edu/research/projects/eq/faq/tx.htm Texas Earthquakes], ''University of Texas Institute for Geophysics'', July 2001.

===Cityscape===
{{Further|[[Geographic areas of Houston]]}}
Houston was incorporated in 1837 under the [[Ward (politics)|ward]] system of representation. The ward designation is the progenitor of the nine current-day Houston City Council districts. Locations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate&nbsp;610 Loop]]. The inside encompasses the [[central business district]] and many residential neighborhoods that predate World War II. More recently, high-density residential areas have been developed within the loop. The city's outlying areas, suburbs and enclaves are located outside of the loop. [[Texas State Highway Beltway 8|Beltway 8]] encircles the city another 5&nbsp;miles (8&nbsp;km) farther out.

[[Image:Houston Cityscape.jpg|center|500px|thumb|[[Uptown Houston|Uptown]] and [[Downtown Houston|Downtown]]]]
Houston is the largest city in the United States without [[zoning]] regulations.  However, Houston has developed in a manner similar to other cities throughout the [[sunbelt]]<ref>http://www.planetizen.com/node/109 Zoning Without Zoning</ref>, and [[Covenant#In a legal context|legal covenants]] are widely employed to play a role largely equivalent to zoning,<ref>http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/hotproperty/archives/2007/10/how_houston_get.html</ref> but with less democratic oversight. Voters rejected efforts to have separate residential and commercial land-use districts in 1948, 1962, and 1993. Rather than a single central business district as the center of the city's employment, multiple districts have grown throughout the city in addition to [[Downtown Houston|downtown]] which include [[Uptown Houston|Uptown]], [[Texas Medical Center|Texas&nbsp;Medical&nbsp;Center]], [[Midtown, Houston, Texas|Midtown]], the [[Houston Energy Corridor|Energy&nbsp;Corridor]], [[Greenway Plaza|Greenway&nbsp;Plaza]], [[Westchase, Houston, Texas|Westchase]], and [[Greenspoint, Houston, Texas|Greenspoint]].

In the 1960s, [[Downtown Houston]] comprised of a modest collection of mid-rise office structures, but has since grown into one of the largest [[skyline]]s in the United States. Downtown was on the threshold of a boom in 1970 with huge projects being launched by [[real estate developer]]s with the energy industry boom.

Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the [[Uptown Houston|Uptown District]] boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of mid-rise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate 610]] west.
