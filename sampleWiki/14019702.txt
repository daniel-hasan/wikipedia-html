In baseball, the home run is one of the most popular aspects of the game. Thus, the career record for home runs is among the most important and respected records in baseball. The road to this record has been closely followed and each additional home run Bonds hits extends the current record further. On [[August 7]] [[2007]], Barry Bonds became the major leagues' career home run champion by hitting his 756th career home run, which surpassed [[Hank Aaron]]'s total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270807126|accessdate=2007-11-01|date=[[2007-08-07]]|title=Bonds turns page to new era with home run No. 756|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}</ref>
