The '''Order of the Phoenix''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] '''Τάγμα του Φοίνικος''') is an [[Order (decoration)]] of [[Greece]], established on [[May 13]], [[1926]] by the [[republicanism|republican]] government of the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] to replace the defunct [[Order of George I|Royal Order of George I]]. The Order was retained by the revived Monarchy after [[1935]], and continues to be awarded by the current Republic.

The Order is bestowed by the [[Greece|Greek]] government to Greek [[citizens]] who have excelled in the [[arts]] and [[literature]], [[science]], [[public administration]], [[shipping]], [[commerce]], and [[industry]]. It is also awarded to [[Alien (law)|foreigner]]s who have helped raise [[Greece]]'s international prestige.

==Grades==
The Order has five classes:
*''Grand Cross'' ('Μεγαλόσταυρος') - wears the badge of the Order on a sash on the right shoulder, and the star of the Order on the left chest; 
*''Grand Commander'' ('Ανώτερος Ταξιάρχης') - wears the badge of the Order on a necklet, and the star of the Order on the left chest; 
*''Commander'' ('Ταξιάρχης') - wears the badge of the Order on a necklet; 
*''Gold Cross'' ('Χρυσούς Σταυρός') - wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest; 
*''Silver Cross'' ('Αργυρούς Σταυρός') - wears the badge on a ribbon on the left chest. 

==Insignia==
The badge of the Order is a white-enameled cross, in silver for the Silver Cross class, in gold for the higher classes, with the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] (symbolizing the rebirth of the Hellenic nation) at the centre. A five-pointed star is at the upper arm of the cross. The first version of the Order (1926-1935) featured the letters "E-T-T-A" on each arm of the cross, the initials of the motto ''Εκ της τέφρας μου αναγεννάμαι'' ("From my ashes I am reborn"). During the Monarchy (1935-1974) the letters were removed and the badge was topped by a crown, while the badge's reverse side featured the monogram of the reigning [[monarch]]. The current version (since 1975) omits the crown, while the reverse features the [[Coat of arms of Greece|Greek National Emblem]] with the words ''ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΗΜΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ'' ("Hellenic Republic").

The ''star'' of the Order is a silver eight-pointed star with straight rays, with the phoenix at the centre; during the Monarchy it was topped by a crown.

The ''ribbon'' of the Order is orange with black edges.

Crossed swords on the insignia indicate that the award was made in the military division of the Order.
