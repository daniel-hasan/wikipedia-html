'''Gaius Julius Caesar''' (ca. [[140 BC]]–[[85 BC]]) was a Roman senator, supporter and brother-in-law of [[Gaius Marius]], and father of [[Julius Caesar]], the later [[Roman dictator|dictator]] of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].  

Caesar was married to [[Aurelia Cotta]], a member the of Aurelii and Rutilii families, and had two daughters, both named [[Julia Caesaris (sister of Julius Caesar)|Julia]], and a son, [[Julius Caesar]], born in 100 BC.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#9 9]; [[Suetonius]], ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#74 74]</ref> He was the brother of [[Sextus Julius Caesar]], [[consul]] in 91 BC.<ref>T.R.S. Broughton, ''Magistrates of the Roman Republic'', ii.20</ref>

Caesar's progress through the ''[[cursus honorum]]'' is well known, although the specific dates associated with his offices are controversial. According to two ''elogiae'' erected in Rome long after his death, Caesar was a commissioner in the colony at [[Cercina]], [[military tribune]], [[quaestor]], [[praetor]], and [[proconsul]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]].<ref>Inscriptiones Italiae, 13.3.51-52</ref> The dates of these offices are unclear.  The colony is probably one of Marius' of 103 BC.<ref>T.C. Brennan, ''The Praetorship in the Roman Republic'', 555.</ref> Broughton dated the praetorship to 92 BC, with the quaestorship falling towards the beginning of the [[90s BC|90s]].<ref> Broughton, ''Magistrates'', ii. 17</ref> Brennan has dated the praetorship to the beginning of the decade.<ref>Brennan, ''Praetorship'', 555</ref>

Caesar died suddenly in 85 BC, in Rome, while putting on his shoes one morning. Another Caesar, possibly his [[Gaius Julius Caesar#Gaius_Julius_Caesar_II|father]], had died similarly in [[Pisa]].<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.54 7.54]</ref> His son, Julius Caesar, survived. His father had seen to his education by one of the best orators of Rome, [[Marcus Antonius Gnipho]].<ref>Suetonius, ''Lives of Eminent Grammarians'' [[s:Lives of Eminent Grammarians#7|7]]</ref> In his will, he left Caesar the bulk of his estate, but after Marius's faction had been defeated in the civil war of the [[80s BC]], this inheritance was confiscated by the dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]].<ref>Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]</ref>
