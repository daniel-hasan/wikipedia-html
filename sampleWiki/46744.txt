<!--See #Shorthand titles for her styles--> 
'''Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon''', later '''Queen Elizabeth''' (Elizabeth Angela Marguerite; [[4 August]] [[1900]] – [[30 March]] [[2002]]), was the [[Queen Consort]] of King [[George VI of the United Kingdom]] and the [[British Empire|British]] [[Dominion]]s from 1936 until his death in 1952. After her husband's death, she was known as ''Queen Elizabeth, The [[Queen Mother]]'', to avoid confusion with her daughter, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. Before her husband ascended the throne, from 1923 to 1936 she was known as the [[Duchess of York]]. She was the last [[King of Ireland|Queen-consort of Ireland]] and [[Emperor of India|Empress-consort of India]].

Born into a family of [[Scottish nobility]] (her [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|father]] inherited the [[Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earldom of Strathmore and Kinghorne]] in 1904), she came to prominence in 1923 when she married Albert, Duke of York, the second son of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. As Duchess of York, she – along with her husband and their two daughters Elizabeth and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]] – embodied traditional ideas of family and public service.<ref>{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Roberts |coauthors=Edited by [[Antonia Fraser]] |title=The House of Windsor |publisher=Cassell and Co. |location=London |year=2000 |isbn=0-304-35406-6 |pages=pp.58–59 }}</ref> She undertook a variety of public engagements, and became known as the "Smiling Duchess" because of her consistent public expression.<ref>{{cite video|people=British Screen News|title=Our Smiling Duchess|publisher=British Screen Productions|location=London|medium=film |year=1930}}</ref>

In 1936, her husband unexpectedly became King when her brother-in-law, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]], [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] in order to marry his mistress, the [[United States|American]] divorcée [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]]. As Queen Consort, Elizabeth accompanied her husband on diplomatic tours to France and North America in the run-up to [[World War II]]. During the war, her seemingly indomitable spirit provided moral support to the British public, and in recognition of her role as a [[propaganda]] tool, [[Adolf Hitler]] described her as "the most dangerous woman in Europe".<ref name="churchill">{{cite web |url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=262 |title=The Churchill Centre |accessdate=2007-02-13 }}</ref> After the war, her husband's health deteriorated and she was widowed at the age of 51.

With her brother-in-law living abroad and her elder daughter now Queen at the age of 26, when Queen Mary died in 1953 Elizabeth became the senior royal and assumed a position as family matriarch. In her later years, she was a consistently popular member of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], when other members were suffering from low levels of public approval.

Only after the illness and death of her own younger daughter, Princess Margaret, did she appear to grow frail. She died seven weeks after Margaret, at the age of 101. During the year of her death in 2002, she was ranked 61st in the [[100 Greatest Britons]] poll.

==Early life==
[[Image:Queenmum27.jpg|thumb|right|Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon 1906]]

Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was the fourth daughter and the ninth of ten children of [[Claude George Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Claude George Bowes-Lyon]], [[Lord Glamis]], (later 14th [[Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]]), and his wife, [[Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Cecilia Nina Cavendish-Bentinck]]. Amongst her ancestors were [[British Prime Minister]] [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland]], and [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]] (Governor-General of India and elder brother of another Prime Minister, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]]).

The location of her birth remains uncertain, but reputedly she was born either in her parents' [[London]] home at [[Belgrave Mansions]], [[Grosvenor Gardens]], or in a horse-drawn ambulance on the way to hospital.<ref>{{cite book |first=Alison |last=Weir |title=Britain’s Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy, Revised edition |publisher=Pimlico |location=London |year=1996 |isbn=0-7126-7448-9|pages=p.330 }}</ref> Her birth was registered at [[Hitchin]], [[Hertfordshire]],<ref>Civil Registration Indexes: Births, General Register Office, England and Wales. Jul–Sep 1900 Hitchin, vol. 3a, p. 667</ref> near the Strathmores' country house [[St Paul's Walden Bury]], and she was christened there on [[23 September]] [[1900]], in the local parish church.

She spent much of her childhood at [[St Paul's Walden]] and at [[Glamis Castle]], the Earl's ancestral home in [[Glamis]], [[Angus]], [[Scotland]]. Until the age of 8, she was educated at home by a governess, and was fond of field sports, ponies and dogs.<ref>{{cite book |last=Vickers |first=Hugo |title=Elizabeth: The Queen Mother |publisher=Arrow Books/Random House |year=2006 |isbn=9780099476627 |pages=p.8 }}</ref> When she started school in London, she astonished her teachers by precociously starting an essay with two [[Greek language|Greek]] words from [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''. Her best subjects were literature and scripture. After returning to private education under a [[German people|German]] governess she passed the [[OCR (examination board)|Oxford Local Examination]] with distinction aged 13.<ref>Vickers, pp.10–14</ref>

On her fourteenth birthday, Britain [[World War I|declared war]] on [[German Empire|Germany]]. Her elder brother, [[Fergus Bowes-Lyon|Fergus]], an [[Commissioned officer|officer]] in the [[Black Watch]] Regiment, was killed in action in [[France]] at the [[Battle of Loos]] in 1915. Another brother, Michael, was reported missing in action in May 1917. However, he had actually been captured after being wounded and remained in a [[prisoner of war]] camp for the rest of the war. Glamis was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers, which Elizabeth helped to run. One of the soldiers she treated wrote in her autograph book that she was to be "Hung, drawn and...quartered...hung in diamonds, drawn in a coach, and...quartered in the best house in the land."<ref>{{cite news |first=Judy |last=Wade |title=The Sunday Express |date=[[9 October]] [[2005]] }}</ref>

==Marriage to Prince Albert==
[[Image:queen mum.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of "The Duchess of York" by [[Philip de László]], 1925]]

Prince Albert – "Bertie" to the family – was the second son of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]. He initially proposed to Elizabeth in 1921, but she turned him down, being "afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to".<ref name="ezard">{{citation|last=Ezard|first=John|title=A life of legend, duty and devotion |newspaper=The Guardian|date=[[1 April]] [[2002]] |page=18 }}</ref> When he declared he would marry no other, his mother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], visited Glamis to see for herself the girl who had stolen her son's heart. She became convinced that Elizabeth was "the one girl who could make Bertie happy", but nevertheless refused to interfere.<ref>{{cite book |last=Airlie |first=Mabell |authorlink=Mabell Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie |title=Thatched with Gold |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |year=1962 |pages=p.167}}</ref>

Eventually Elizabeth agreed to marry Albert, despite her misgivings about royal life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Longford |first=Elizabeth |authorlink=Elizabeth Longford |title=The Queen Mother |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |year=1981 |pages=p.23}}</ref> The engagement was announced in January 1923. Albert's freedom in choosing Elizabeth, legally a [[commoner]] though the daughter of a peer, was considered a gesture in favour of political modernisation; previously, princes were expected to marry princesses from other royal families.<ref>Roberts, pp.57–58</ref> They married on [[26 April]] [[1923]], at [[Westminster Abbey]]. Elizabeth laid her bouquet at the Tomb of [[the Unknown Warrior]] on her way into the Abbey,<ref>Vickers, p.64</ref> a gesture which every royal bride since has copied, though subsequent brides have chosen to do this on the way back from the altar rather than to it. She became styled ''[[HRH]] [[The Duchess of York]]''. They honeymooned at [[Polesden Lacey]], a manor house in [[Surrey]], and then went to Scotland.<ref>{{cite book |last=Howarth |first=Patrick |title=George VI |publisher=Century Hutchinson |year=1987 |pages=p.37–38|isbn=0091710006 }}</ref> 

In 1926, the couple had their first child, Elizabeth, who would later become [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Another daughter, [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret Rose]], was born four years later. The Duke and Duchess of York travelled to Australia to open [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]] in 1927.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page1041.asp|title=The Official Memorial Site of the Queen Mother|accessdate=2007-02-26 }}</ref>

==Queen consort to George VI (1936–1952)==
===Accession and abdication of Edward VIII; accession of George VI===
On [[20 January]] [[1936]], [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] died and the succession passed to Albert's brother, Prince Edward the Prince of Wales, who became King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]]. George and Mary had been forthcoming as to their reservations about their eldest child. Indeed, George had expressed the wish, "I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne."<ref>{{cite book |last=Ziegler |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Ziegler |title=King Edward VIII: The Official Biography |location=London |publisher=Collins |year=1990 |pages=p.199|isbn=0002157411 }}</ref>

As if granting his parents' wish, Edward forced a [[Abdication crisis of 1936|constitutional crisis]] by insisting on marrying the American divorcée Mrs [[Wallis Simpson]]. Although legally Edward could have married Mrs Simpson and remained king, his ministers advised him that the people would never accept her as queen and advised against the marriage. Indeed, if the King ignored their advice, they would have to resign: this would have irreparably ruined Edward's status as a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional Monarch]], obliged to accept ministerial advice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beaverbrook|first=Lord|authorlink=Max Aitken, Baron Beaverbook|title=The Abdication of King Edward VIII|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|location=London|coauthor=Edited by [[A. J. P. Taylor]]|year=1966|pages=p.57 }}</ref> He chose to abdicate in favour of Albert,<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p.387</ref> who had no desire to become king and had even less training for the role (despite his parents' aforementioned hopes for him). Albert took the regnal name [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]]. He and Elizabeth were crowned King and Queen of [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]] and the [[Commonwealth realms|British dominions beyond the seas]], and Emperor and Empress of [[British Raj|India]] on [[12 May]] [[1937]], the date already nominated for the coronation of Edward VIII.<ref> Elizabeth's crown contained the [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond and was heavily based on that of Queen Mary, whose crown was taken to Garrard's with "the purpose of preparing designs for a new Crown for the Queen" (See [http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page1067.asp British Royal Family website, "HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother: Crown"]). As with Queen Mary's crown, the arches are detachable, a feature which Elizabeth used in 1953 at her daughter's coronation as Queen Mary had done at the 1937 coronation of George VI and Elizabeth.</ref>

Elizabeth supported George VI's decision to withhold the style of [[Royal Highness]] from the ex-King Edward's wife and any of his children.<ref>Letter from George VI to Winston Churchill in which the King says his family shared his view, quoted by Howarth, p.143</ref> When Edward and Wallis Simpson married, Mrs Simpson became the Duchess of Windsor, but not a Royal Highness. Elizabeth was later quoted as referring to the Duchess as "that woman".<ref>Michie, Alan A., ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]'', [[17 March]] [[1941]], quoted by Vickers, p.224</ref><ref>According to [[Diana Mitford|Lady Mosley]], who knew both the future Queen Mother and the Duchess of Windsor, the Queen's antipathy toward her sister-in-law may have had a deeper source. As Lady Mosley wrote, "probably the theory of their [the Windsors'] contemporaries that Cake [a Mitford nickname for the Queen Mother, derived from her fashion sense] was rather in love with him [the Duke] (as a girl) & took second best, may account for much." Letter from Lady Mosley to her sister the [[Deborah Mitford|Duchess of Devonshire]], 5 June 1972, "The Mitfords: Letters Between Six Sisters", London: Fourth Estate, 2007, page 582</ref> For her part, the Duchess referred to Elizabeth as "Cookie".<ref>Hogg, James; Mortimer, Michael (2002).

===Royal tour of Canada and the United States in 1939===
[[Image:Qew-lg.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Queen Elizabeth Way Monument]], near [[Toronto]], with the [[Effigy|effigies]] of Queen Elizabeth and King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]].]]
In June 1939, Elizabeth's husband became the first reigning [[Monarchy in Canada|King of Canada]] to tour the country, as well as the [[United States]].<ref>According to the official Royal Tour historian [[Gustave Lanctot]], George VI was to be present in [[Canada]] as a living example the fact of Canada's status as an independent kingdom. During the tour of the United States, the King and Queen were accompanied by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]], as the sole Minister in Attendance, rather than by a British minister, by way of reinforcing that their visit to the United States was a visit from Canada.

In Canada she was quoted throughout her life as to her reported immediate response on landing in 1939: a World War I veteran asked, during one of the earliest of the royal couple's repeated encounters with the crowds, "Are you [[Scottish people|Scots]] or [[English people|English]]?" She replied, "I'm Canadian!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/royalvisit2005/speech_7oct2002_e.cfm |title=Speech Delivered by Her Majesty the Queen at the Fairmont Hotel, Vancouver, Monday, 7th October 2002 |publisher=Canadian Heritage |accessdate=2007-02-13 }}</ref>

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], the King and Queen became symbols of the nation's resistance. Shortly after the declaration of war, [[The Queen's Book of the Red Cross]] was conceived. Fifty authors and artists contributed to the book, which was fronted by [[Cecil Beaton]]'s portrait of the Queen and was sold in aid of the [[Red Cross]].<ref>Vickers, p.205</ref> Elizabeth publicly refused to leave London or send the children to Canada, even during [[the Blitz]], when she was advised by [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|the Cabinet]] to do so and indeed the Canadian government had purchased an [[Hatley Castle|estate]] outside [[Victoria, BC]] for them to occupy.<ref>[http://www.ltgov.bc.ca/whatsnew/sp/sp_may07_2004.htm Office of the Lieutenant Governor: Speech by Iona Campolo, Retired Heads of Mission Association's Gala Dinner, Royal Roads University, Hatley Castle, Victoria, BC, February 5, 2007]</ref> She said, "The children won't go without me. I won't leave the King. And the King will never leave."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page1043.asp |title=The Official Web-site of the British Monarchy |accessdate=2007-05-14 }}</ref>

She often made visits to parts of London that were targeted by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Luftwaffe]], in particular the [[East End of London|East End]], near [[London Docklands|London's docks]]. Her visits initially provoked hostility. Rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered, in part because she dressed in expensive clothing which served to alienate her from those suffering the privations caused by the war.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/queenmother/article/0,,676855,00.html |first=Lucy |last=Moore |title=A wicked twinkle and a streak of steel |publisher=The Guardian |date=[[31 March]] [[2002]] |accessdate=2007-02-13 }}</ref> She explained that if the public came to see her they would wear their best clothes, so she should reciprocate in kind; [[Norman Hartnell]] dressed her in gentle colours and never black, in order to represent "the rainbow of hope".<ref>Vickers, p.219</ref> When [[Buckingham Palace]] itself took several hits during the height of the bombing, Elizabeth was able to say, "I'm glad we've been bombed. It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britainexpress.com/royals/queen-mother.htm |title=BritainExpress |accessdate=2007-02-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onwar.com/articles/0205.htm |title=On War |accessdate=2007-02-13 }}</ref>

Though the King and Queen spent the working day at Buckingham Palace, partly for security and family reasons they stayed at night at [[Windsor Castle]] (about 20 miles, 35 kilometres, west of central London) with the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. The Palace had lost much of its staff to the [[British Army|army]], and most of the rooms were shut.<ref>Vickers, p.229</ref> Due to fears of imminent invasion during the "[[Phony War]]" the Queen was given revolver training.<ref>Bradford, p.321</ref>

Because of her effect on British morale, [[Adolf Hitler]] is said to have called her "the most dangerous woman in Europe".<ref name="churchill" /> However, prior to the war both she and her husband, like most of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and the British public, had been supporters of [[appeasement]] and Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]], believing after the experience of the First World War that war had to be avoided at all costs. After the resignation of Chamberlain, the King asked [[Winston Churchill]] to form a government. Although the King was initially reluctant to support Churchill, in due course both the King and Queen came to respect and admire him for what they perceived to be his courage and solidarity.<ref>{{citation |first=H. C. G. |last=Matthew |title=George VI (1895–1952) |journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 }}</ref><ref>Vickers, pp.210–211</ref>

==Queen Mother (1952–2002)==
===New role in widowhood===
On [[6 February]] [[1952]], King George VI died of [[lung cancer]]. Shortly afterward, Elizabeth began to be styled "Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother". This style was adopted because the normal style for the widow of a king, "Queen Elizabeth", would have been too similar to the style of her elder daughter, now [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=CBC News|last=McCluskey|first=Peter|title=Elizabeth: The Queen Mother|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/obit/queenmother/|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> Popularly, she simply became "the Queen Mother" or "the Queen Mum".

She was devastated by the King's death and retired to Scotland; however, after a meeting with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, she broke her retirement and resumed her public duties.<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Hogg |coauthors=Mortimer, Michael (eds.) |title=The Queen Mother Remembered |publisher=BBC Books |year=2002 |isbn=0-563-36214-6 |pages=p.161 }}</ref> Eventually she became just as busy as Queen Mother as she had been as Queen. In July of 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral, laying the [[foundation stone]] in Mount Pleasant of the [[University of Zimbabwe|University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland – the current University of Zimbabwe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uz.ac.zw/information/uz.html|title=University of Zimbabwe Department of Information|accessdate=2007-02-10}}</ref>

The widowed queen also oversaw the restoration of the remote [[Castle of Mey]] on the [[Caithness]] coast of Scotland, which she used to "get away from everything"<ref>Vickers, p.314</ref> for three weeks in August and ten days in October each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.castleofmey.org.uk/castle-ownership.html|title=The Queen Elizabeth Castle Of Mey Trust|accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> Inspired by the amateur jockey [[Anthony Bingham Mildmay, 2nd Baron Mildmay of Flete|Lord Mildmay]],<ref>Rowe, David.

Her distinctive light blue colours were carried by horses such as Special Cargo, the winner of the 1984 [[Betfred Gold Cup|Whitbread Gold Cup]] and The Argonaut. Although (contrary to rumour) she never placed bets, she did have the racing commentaries piped direct to her London residence, [[Clarence House]], so she could follow the races.<ref>Vickers, p.458</ref> One of her [[jockey]]s, [[Dick Francis]], later achieved fame as a writer of [[detective novel]]s.

[[Image:QEQM 100th birthday.jpg|left|thumb|The Queen Mother reads a [[telegram]] from her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, on her 100th birthday:
[[4 August]] [[2000]]]]
Before the marriage of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana Spencer]] to her grandson [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], and after Diana's death, the Queen Mother – known for her personal and public charm – was by far the most popular member of the [[British Royal Family]].<ref name="ezard" /> Her signature dress of large upturned hat with netting and dresses with draped panels of fabric became a distinctive personal style. The Queen Mother had a discerning love of the arts, and purchased works by [[Claude Monet]], [[Augustus John]] and [[Peter Carl Fabergé]], among others. The works she obtained were transferred to the [[Royal Collection]] after her death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/ |title=The Royal Collection |accessdate=2007-02-13 }}</ref>

===Centenarian===
In her later years, the Queen Mother became known for her longevity. Her hundredth birthday was celebrated in a number of ways: a parade that celebrated the highlights of her life included contributions from [[Norman Wisdom]] and [[John Mills]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC|title=Birthday pageant for Queen Mother|date=[[19 July]] [[2000]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/841740.stm|accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref> She attended a lunch at the [[Guildhall, London]], at which [[George Carey]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], accidentally attempted to drink her glass of wine. Her quick admonition of "That's mine!" caused widespread amusement.<ref>Vickers, p.490</ref>

In December 2001, the Queen Mother had a fall in which she fractured her pelvis. Even so, she insisted on standing for the National Anthem during the memorial service for her husband on [[6 February]] the following year.<ref>Vickers, p.495</ref> Just three days later, her second daughter Princess Margaret died. On [[13 February]] [[2002]], at [[Sandringham House]], the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm. A doctor and an ambulance with a resuscitation unit (the latter only being there as a precaution) were called to Sandringham, where the wound on the Queen Mother's arm was dressed.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1818165.stm|title=Queen Mother hurt in minor fall|date=[[13 February]] [[2002]]|accessdate=2007-02-23 }}</ref> Despite this fall, the Queen Mother was still keen to attend Margaret's funeral at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]], two days later on Friday of that week. The Queen and the rest of the royal family were greatly concerned about the journey the Queen Mother was facing to get from Norfolk to Windsor.<ref name="fall">Vickers, pp.497–498</ref> Nevertheless, she made the journey but insisted that she be shielded from the press, so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be taken.<ref name="fall" />

==Death==
[[Image:Queen Mother Carriage.jpg|thumb|The Queen Mother's funeral carriage escorted by the Queen's Guard]]
On [[30 March]] [[2002]], at 3:15pm, the Queen Mother died peacefully in her sleep at the [[Royal Lodge]], Windsor, with her surviving daughter Elizabeth II at her bedside. She had been suffering from a cold for the last four months of her life.<ref name="bbc" /> She was 101&nbsp;years old, and at the time of her death was the longest-lived member of the royal family in British history. This record was broken on [[24 July]] [[2003]], by her last surviving sister-in-law [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]], who died aged 102 on [[29 October]] [[2004]].

She grew [[camellia]]s in every one of her gardens, and as her body was taken from the [[Royal Lodge]], [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] to lie in state at [[Westminster Hall]], camellias from her own gardens were placed on top of the flag-draped coffin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/queenmother/article/0,,678048,00.html|publisher=The Guardian|first=Stephen|last=Bates|accessdate=2007-02-26|date=[[3 April]] [[2002]]|title=Piper's farewell for Queen Mother }}</ref> More than 200,000 people filed by her [[coffin]] as it lay in state in Westminster Hall of the [[Palace of Westminster]] for three days. During that time the coffin was guarded by members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces. The Queen Mother's four grandsons [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]], [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]] and [[David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley|Viscount Linley]] stood guard over the four corners at one point.

On the day of the Queen Mother's funeral, [[9 April]], more than a million people filled the area outside [[Westminster Abbey]] and along the 23-mile route from central London to her final resting place beside her husband and younger daughter in [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=CNN|title=Queues at Queen Mother vault |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/04/10/uk.queenmum/index.html |accessdate=2007-02-26|date=[[10 April]] [[2002]] }}</ref> At her request, after her funeral the wreath that had lain atop her coffin was placed on the Tomb of [[the Unknown Warrior]] in Westminster Abbey, a gesture that echoed her wedding-day tribute.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1920360.stm |publisher=BBC|date=[[10 April]] [[2002]]|accessdate=2007-02-26|title=Mourners visit Queen Mother's vault }}</ref>

==Public perception and character==
[[Image:RBS=Queen Mother.jpg|thumb|right|[[Academy Award]]-winning songwriter [[Robert B. Sherman]] with the Queen Mother at the 1976 [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''[[The Slipper and the Rose]]'']]

Sir [[Hugh Casson]] described her vividly as like "a wave breaking on a rock, because although she is sweet and pretty and charming, she also has a basic streak of toughness and tenacity. … when a wave breaks on a rock, it showers and sparkles with a brilliant play of foam and droplets in the sun, yet beneath is really hard, tough rock, fused, in her case, from strong principles, physical courage and a sense of duty."<ref>Hogg and Mortimer, p.122</ref> [[Peter Ustinov]] described her during a student demonstration in 1968, "As we arrived in a solemn procession the students pelted us with toilet rolls. They kept hold of one end, like streamers at a ball, and threw the other end. The Queen Mother stopped and picked these up as though somebody had misplaced them. [Returning them to the students she said,] 'Was this yours? Oh, could you take it?' And it was her sang-froid and her absolute refusal to be shocked by this, which immediately silenced all the students. She knows instinctively what to do on those occasions. She doesn't rise to being heckled at all; she just pretends it must be an oversight on the part of the people doing it. The way she reacted not only showed her presence of mind, but was so charming and so disarming, even to the most rabid element, that she brought peace to troubled waters."<ref>Hogg and Mortimer, pp.212–213</ref>

Despite being regarded as one of the most popular members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] in recent times who helped to stabilise the popularity of the [[British monarchy|monarchy]] as a whole,<ref name="lawrence">{{citation|first=Lawrence |last=Goldman|title=Elizabeth (1900–2002) |journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=May 2006 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/76927 |accessdate=2007-02-23|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/76927 }}</ref> the Queen Mother was subject to various degrees of criticism during her life. Among the most serious criticisms of her relates to perceived partiality of the King and Queen in relation to the appeasement debate in the 1930s. Upon Neville Chamberlain's return from [[Munich Agreement|Munich]] in 1938, he was invited onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace to receive acclamation from a crowd of well-wishers. Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of opposition in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], which led historian [[John Grigg (writer)|John Grigg]] to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as "the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century".<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,677098,00.html Mourning will be brief] Christopher Hitchens, The Guardian, 1 April 2002</ref> However, historians have also argued that the King only ever followed ministerial advice and acted as he was constitutionally bound to do.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sinclair|first=David|title=Two Georges: the Making of the Modern Monarchy|publisher=Hodder and Staughton|year=1988|pages=p.230|isbn=0340332409}}</ref> In 1945, Churchill was invited onto the balcony in a similar gesture.

During the 1939 Royal Tour of North America, [[First Lady of the United States|U.S. First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] said that Elizabeth was "a little self-consciously regal".<ref>{{cite book |first=Joseph P. |last=Lash |title=Eleanor and Franklin |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1971 |pages=p.582}}</ref> After Mrs Roosevelt "lunched alone with the King & Queen & Elizabeth & Margaret Rose", during her 1948 visit for the unveiling of the statue of President Roosevelt in [[Grosvenor Square]], she observed, "It was nice & they are nice people but so far removed from real life, it seems."<ref>{{cite book |first=Joseph P. |last=Lash |title=Eleanor: The Years Alone |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1972 |pages=p.47}}</ref>

[[Kitty Kelley]] and others have alleged that during [[World War II]] Elizabeth did not abide by the [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing regulations]] to which the rest of the population was subject.<ref name="kelley">{{cite book |first=Kitty |last=Kelley |title=The Royals |publisher=Time Warner |location=New York |year=1977 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Picknett |first=Lynn|coauthors=Prince, Clive; Prior, Stephen; & Brydon, Robert |title=War of the Windsors: A Century of Unconstitutional Monarchy |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=1-84018-631-3 |pages=p.161 }}</ref> However, this point is contradicted by the official records;<ref>The memoirs of the [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Rt. Hon. the Earl of Woolton C.H., P.C., D.L., LL.D.]] (1959) London: Cassell</ref><ref>Roberts, p.67</ref> and Eleanor Roosevelt during her stay at Buckingham Palace during the war reported expressly on the rationed food served in the Palace and the limited bathwater that was permitted.<ref>{{cite book |last=Goodwin |first=Doris Kearns |authorlink=Doris Kearns Goodwin |title=No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |year=1995 |pages=p.380 }}</ref>

Kelley also alleged that Elizabeth used racist slurs to refer to black people,<ref name="kelley" /> a claim strongly denied by Major Colin Burgess.<ref>{{cite book |first=Major Colin |last=Burgess |title=Behind Palace Doors: My Service as the Queen Mother's Equerry |publisher=John Blake Publishing |year=2006 |pages=p.233}}</ref> Major Burgess was the husband of Elizabeth Burgess, the mixed-race secretary who accused members of the Prince of Wales's Household of racial abuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1697526.stm|title=Royal secretary loses race bias case|publisher=BBC|date=2001-12-7|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> Queen Elizabeth made no racist public comments; in private comments recorded in [[Woodrow Wyatt]]'s diary she apparently admonishes him when he expresses racist views, by telling him, "I am very keen on the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].

Her political views were never publicly disclosed, though a letter she wrote in 1947 described [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]]'s "high hopes of a [[socialism|socialist]] heaven on earth" as fading and presumably describes those who voted for him as "poor people, so many half-educated and bemused. I do love them."<ref>{{cite web|first=Andrew|last=Pierce|title=What Queen Mother really thought of Attlee's socialist 'heaven on earth'|publisher=The Times|date=[[13 May]] [[2006]]|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2178089,00.html|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> She told the [[Fortune FitzRoy, Duchess of Grafton|Duchess of Grafton]], "I love [[communism|communists]]".<ref>Hogg and Mortimer, p.89</ref> Woodrow Wyatt thought her "much more pro Conservative than the Queen or the Prince of Wales"<ref>{{cite book|author=Wyatt, Woodrow|authorlink=Woodrow Wyatt|coauthors=Edited by Sarah Curtis|title=The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt: Volume I|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|pages=p.255|isbn=0333741668}}</ref> but she later told him, "I like the dear old Labour Party."<ref>Wyatt, ''Volume I'' p.309</ref>

In 1987, she was criticised when it emerged that two of her nieces, [[Katherine Bowes-Lyon]] and [[Nerissa Bowes-Lyon]], had both been committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]] because they were severely handicapped. However, [[Burke's Peerage]] had listed the sisters as dead, apparently because their mother, [[Fenella Bowes-Lyon|Fenella]] (the Queen Mother's sister-in-law), "was 'extremely vague' when it came to filling in forms and might not have completed the paperwork for the family entry correctly".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:wgiIZsTRuhMJ:www.sundayherald.com/print23673+site:http://www.sundayherald.com/+bowes-lyon&hl=en&gl=uk&ct=clnk&cd=1&client=firefox-a |first=Neil |last=MacKay |title=Nieces abandoned in state-run mental asylum and declared dead to avoid public shame |publisher=The Sunday Herald |date=[[7 April]] [[2002]] |accessdate=2007-02-13 }}</ref> When Nerissa had died the year before, her grave was originally marked with a plastic tag and a serial number.

Elizabeth maintained a serene image throughout her public engagements, except once, during the 1947 Royal Tour of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], when she rose from the royal carriage to beat an admirer about the head with her umbrella, having mistaken enthusiasm for hostility.<ref>Bradford, p.391</ref> Being a keen [[angling|angler]], she once calmly joked, after being rushed to hospital when a fish bone stuck in her throat at a dinner party, "The salmon have got their own back."<ref name="straits">{{citation |title=Queen of Quips |publisher=The Straits Times (Singapore) |date=[[7 August]] [[2000]] }}</ref>

She was well-known for her dry witticisms. On hearing that [[Edwina Mountbatten, Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Edwina Mountbatten]] was buried at sea, she said: "Dear Edwina, she always liked to make a splash."<ref name="straits" /> Accompanied by the gay writer and wit Sir [[Noël Coward]] at a gala function, she mounted a staircase lined with Guards.

In the memorial service held in Canada, her Canadian honours, the [[Canadian Forces Decoration]] and [[Order of Canada]], were read out.

===Arms===
The Queen Mother's coat of arms were the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom]] (in either the English or the Scottish version) [[impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] with the arms of her father, [[Earl of Strathmore]], the latter being ''1st and 4th quarters, [[argent]], a lion [[Charge (heraldry)#Quadrupeds|rampant]] [[Azure]], armed and langued [[gules]], within a double tressure flory-counter-flory of the second (Lyon), 2nd and 3rd quarters, [[ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] three bows, stringed paleways proper (Bowes).''
