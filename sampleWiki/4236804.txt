[[Image:Buche-cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|A traditional Bûche de Noël, made with a Génoise cake and chocolate buttercream, and garnished with powdered sugar, raspberries, and spruce boughs.]]'''Bûche de Noël''' ("[[Yule log]]") is a traditional dessert served during the [[Christmas]] holidays in [[France]] and [[Quebec]].  As the name indicates, the cake is generally prepared, presented, and garnished so as to look like a log ready for the fire.  The traditional bûche is made from a [[Génoise Cake|Génoise]] or other [[sponge cake|sponge]] [[cake]], generally baked in a large, shallow [[Swiss roll|jelly roll]] pan, frosted, rolled to form a cylinder, and frosted again on the outside.  The most common combination is a basic yellow sponge cake, frosted and filled with [[chocolate]] [[buttercream]], however, many variations on the traditional recipe exist, possibly including chocolate cakes, ganache and [[espresso]] or otherwise-flavored [[icing (food)|frosting]]s and [[Filling (cooking)|filling]]s.  Bûches are often served with a portion of one end of the cake cut off and set on top of the cake to resemble a chopped off branch, and [[bark]]-like texture is often produced in the buttercream for further realism.  These [[cake decorating| cakes are often decorated]] with [[powdered sugar]] to resemble [[snow]], tree branches, fresh [[berries]], and [[mushroom]]s made of [[meringue]].


One popular story behind the creation of this dessert is that [[Napoleon I of France]] issued a proclamation requiring households in [[Paris]] to keep their chimneys closed during the winter, based on the notion that cold air caused medical problems.  This prevented Parisians from being able to use their fireplaces, and, thus, prevented them from engaging in many of the traditions surrounding and involving the hearth in French Christmas tradition.  French bakers, according to the theory, invented this dessert as a symbolic replacement around which the family could gather for story-telling and other holiday merriment.
