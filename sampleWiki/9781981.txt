The '''February-March 2007 Tornado Outbreak''' was a [[tornado outbreak]] across the [[southern United States]] that began in [[Kansas]] on [[February 28]], [[2007]]. The severe weather spread eastward on [[March 1]] and left a deadly mark across the southern US, particularly in [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. 20 deaths were reported, one in [[Missouri]], nine in Georgia and 10 in Alabama. Scattered severe weather was also reported in [[North Carolina]] on [[March 2]] producing a possible [[tornado]] before the storms moved offshore into the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070302/ap_on_re_us/tornadoes_27|title=Tornadoes rip through Ala., killing 7|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070304065659/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070302/ap_on_re_us/tornadoes_27|publisher=The Associated Press|archivedate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

In the end, there were 57 tornadoes confirmed during the outbreak, including three '''EF3''' tornadoes reported across three states, as well as three '''EF4''' tornadoes; two in Alabama and one in Kansas, the first such tornadoes since the introduction of the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]. Total damages exceeded $520 million. Insured losses in the state of Georgia topped $210 million, making this outbreak the costliest in that state's history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2007/03/19/77826.htm |title=Ga.: Losses from March 1 Storms Top $210 Million |publisher=Insurance Journal |accessdate = 2007-11-11}}</ref> [[Enterprise, Alabama]], which was hit the hardest, sustained damages in excess of $307 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.disasternews.net/news/article.php?articleid=3281 |title=AL recovery shows real 'Enterprise' |publisher=Disaster News Network|accessdate = 2007-11-11}}</ref>    

==Meteorological synopsis==
The tornado outbreak was related to a large low-pressure system across the [[central United States]] that intensified on [[February 28]] while over [[Kansas]], and a [[cold front]] moved across the region, providing the lift needed to allow the storms to develop. In addition, a surge of very moist air from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and warm temperatures across the south side of the storm helped feed the storms. [[Temperature]]s were in the 70s°F (low 20s°C) in some areas to the south, while the mercury was below freezing on the north side. The [[dewpoint]]s were in the 60 °F (16 °C) range as far north as southeastern Kansas, which provided extra fuel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2007/day1otlk_20070228_1630.html |title=Feb 28, 2007 1630 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook |=publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

A '''moderate risk''' of severe storms was issued by the [[Storm Prediction Center]] for February 28 across parts of the central Plains. The first tornadoes developed early in the evening of February 28 in [[Kansas]] as the [[dry line]] pushed eastward and was lifted by the cold front.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2007/day1otlk_20070228_2000.html|title=
Feb 28, 2007 2000 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook |=publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> In total, 12 tornadoes formed that evening across Kansas and [[Missouri]], of which 11 were weak. However, one of the tornadoes was an '''EF4''', the first such tornado recorded and the first violent tornado since [[Late-September 2006 Tornado Outbreak|September 22, 2006]]. Fortunately, no one was injured that evening. Farther south, though, expected activity in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Arkansas]] did not take place as the atmospheric cap held up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2007/day1otlk_20070301_0100.html |title=

A '''high risk''' of severe storms - [[List of SPC High Risk days|the first such issuance]] since [[April 6-8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak|April 7, 2006]] - was issued for a large part of the [[Deep South]] for [[March 1]] as the cold front moved eastward.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2007/day1otlk_20070301_1200.html|title=
Mar 1, 2007 0600 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook|=publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking place that morning across the [[Mississippi Valley]], with one of them leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as [[Illinois]] near the center of the low. However, the most intense activity began around noon and continued throughout the afternoon and evening, with southern [[Alabama]] and southern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] being the hardest hit. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with devastating effects. 19 people were killed by those tornadoes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2007/day1otlk_20070301_2000.html|title=

The [[squall line]] finally overtook the supercells just after midnight on [[March 2]] after putting down 37 tornadoes that day. As the squall line overtook the cells, a few tornadoes - all '''EF0''' - took place overnight in [[Florida]] and extreme southern Georgia within the squall line before the severe weather emerged in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] that morning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2007/day1otlk_20070302_0100.html|title=

On the other side of the [[low pressure area]], a significant [[blizzard]] occurred over the northern [[Great Plains]] and [[Upper Midwest]] including parts of [[Minnesota]], [[Manitoba]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Iowa]] and [[Nebraska]] where several snowfalls in excess of 8 to 18 inches (20—45 cm) were reported and between 6 and 11 inches (15—28 cm) across portions of Ontario and Quebec<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2007/03/01/storm-roads.html|title=Treacherous roads blamed for accidents|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> .

Early on the afternoon of Thursday, [[March 1]], at 1:08 pm [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CST]] (1908 [[UTC]]), a destructive tornado first developed near the [[Enterprise Municipal Airport (Alabama)|Enterprise Municipal Airport]]. The tornado lifted off the ground briefly before returning to the ground as an even stronger storm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/tlh/Mar0102_2007/index.html|title=Tornado Outbreak of March 1-2, 2007|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> It quickly slammed into [[Enterprise, Alabama]] at 1:12 pm CST (1912 UTC). The tornado left severe damage throughout a large section of the city. The most severe damage took place at [[Enterprise High School (Alabama)|Enterprise High School]], where a section of the school was destroyed during the middle of the school day. At least eight fatalities were reported at the school and 50 others were taken to local hospitals. Some early reports suggested that there had been as many as 15 deaths at Enterprise High School and 18 deaths statewide, which was found to be an over-estimation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readingeagle.com/Article.aspx?id=18801|title=Tornadoes Kill 18 in Alabama; Mo. Girl|publisher=Reading Eagle|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> It was the first killer tornado at a US school since the [[Plainfield Tornado]] in [[Illinois]] in 1990, and the deadliest definite tornado since [[Belvidere Tornado Outbreak|one in]] [[Belvidere, Illinois]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/toptens/topten2.htm|title=The Ten Worst Tornado Related Disasters in Schools|publisher=TornadoProject.com|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> One other death was reported in Enterprise at a nearby private residence when her living room was shattered by the tornado.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eprisenow.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=ENT/MGArticle/ENT_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1149193487576&path=%21news|title=Victim count continues to change; some names released|publisher=The Enterprise Leader|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref><ref name="NCDC-Enterprise">{{cite web |url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~646167|title=Event Record Details|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>  

[[Image:Enterprise High School, Alabama 2007March03.jpg|thumb|250px|left|US President G.W. Bush surveys tornado damage to Enterprise High School from [[Marine One]].]]
At the school, the fatalities resulted from the collapse of a concrete wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students in the rubble just outside the music room. The tornado at the school was so strong that it flipped cars over in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. [[School bus]]es were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1 pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.<ref name="Leader1054">{{cite web |url=http://www.eprisenow.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=ENT/MGArticle/ENT_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1149193481054&path=%21news|title='We need your prayers'|publisher=The Enterprise Leader|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

Nearby Hillcrest Elementary School also sustained severe damaged from the tornado. After the tornado hit, students from both schools that were not injured were relocated by emergency personnel to Hillcrest Baptist Church, adjacent to the school which was not damaged, in order to meet up with shocked parents. Emergency personnel also rushed to the school to send the most seriously injured to local hospitals and provide treatment on the scene to others.<ref name="Leader1054"/>

The tornado initially formed in a neighborhood just south of the downtown area; after demolishing a section of the downtown area it moved on to the schools. The tornado then continued northeast crossing the Holly Hill and Dixie Drive areas. A quarter mile (400 m) wide swath was devastated, with enormous damage reported to many houses and businesses, some of which were flattened. Several other schools and the local [[YMCA]] were among the damaged buildings.<ref name="Leader1054"/> In total, at least 370 houses were damaged or destroyed, according to Mayor Kenneth Boswell.<ref name='bush'>{{cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070303/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_tornadoes|title=Bush offers comfort to devastated towns|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070307154321/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070303/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_tornadoes|archivedate=2007-03-07|publisher=The Associated Press}}</ref>

The tornado itself was estimated to have been 500 yards (450 m) wide and had a path length of 10 miles (16&nbsp;km). It dissipated shortly after leaving Enterprise.<ref name="NCDC-Enterprise"/> It was given an initial rating of '''EF3''' on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eprisenow.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=ENT/MGArticle/ENT_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1149193487576&path=%21news|title=Victim count continues to change; some names released|publisher=The Enterprise Leader|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> However, after a detailed survey, the tornado was upgraded to a low-end '''EF4''' with winds around 170 mph (275&nbsp;km/h) due to flattened houses near the school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/tlh/Mar0102_2007/PNSTAE_03010207.txt|title=Public Information Statement|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
The [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] was called into Enterprise in the aftermath of the tornado. [[Governor of Alabama|Governor]] [[Bob Riley]] mobilized about 100 troops and placed more on standby. A [[dusk]]-to-[[dawn]] [[curfew]] was imposed on the community after the tornado hit due to the extensive damage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eprisenow.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=ENT/MGArticle/ENT_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1149193468910&path=%21news |title=The Enterprise Ledgder - National Guard Being Sent to Enterprise |accessdate=2007-11-08 }}</ref> On the morning of [[March 3]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] visited the community and declared Coffee County a [[disaster area]]. He went into the school and also took an aerial view of the devastation.<ref name='bush'/> [[FEMA]] was also called in to provide additional assistance.

After the tornado, it was debated on whether the students should have indeed been dismissed before the tornado hit. However, the [[National Weather Service]] survey from the office in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] suggested that the death toll could have been much higher due to the extreme damage in the parking lot and the area nearby.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/tlh/Mar0102_2007/index.html|title=Tornado Outbreak of March 1-2, 2007|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref> In addition, earlier thunderstorm activity in the area with two other rotating supercells tracking towards Enterprise late that morning (the first tornado warning was issued at 10:41 am CST) made evacuating the area unsafe.<ref name="NWS Assessment">{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.gov/os/assessments/pdfs/AL-GA_tornadoes07.pdf|title=Tornadoes in Southern Alabama and Georgia on March 1, 2007|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref>

In a later service assessment done by the NWS, it was determined that the school had taken the appropriate safety precautions to minimize and prevent potential loss of life with the tornado approaching, and the students were indeed in the safest part of the building. However, it was recommended in the assessment that hardened "safe rooms" with enhanced construction to prevent future disasters in the event of large and violent tornadoes impacting large buildings. A [[Roanoke Tornado of 2004|similar tornado]] on [[July 13]], [[2004]] in [[Roanoke, Illinois]] destroyed an industrial building, yet such rooms were used and no one there was seriously injured.<ref name="NWS Assessment"/>
