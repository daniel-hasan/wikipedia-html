'''Rena Mero Lesnar''' (born '''Rena Greek''' on [[August 8]], [[1967]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[model (person)|model]], [[actor|actress]], and former [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. She is primarily known for her stints in [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] as the buxom '''Sable''' character. As Sable, she was one of the first [[WWE Diva]]s, gained considerable popularity, and was featured on the cover of ''[[Playboy]]'' three times.<ref name=alumni/>

==Early life==
Born '''Rena Greek''' in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], she was active in her youth and was interested in activities such as gymnastics, horseback riding, and softball. After winning her first beauty pageant at 12 years of age, she eventually became a model, working with companies such as [[L'Or√©al]], [[Pepsi]], and [[Guess (clothing)|Guess?]].<ref name="askmen">{{cite web|title=AskMen.com - Rena Mero|url=http://www.askmen.com/women/models_300/316_rena_mero.html}}</ref>

Greek married Wayne Richardson in 1986, and had a daughter with him named Mariah in 1988. The two remained married until Richardson died in 1991. She met her second husband, professional wrestler and former [[boxing|boxer]] [[Marc Mero]], who had been performing in [[World Championship Wrestling]] as "Johnny B. Badd", in 1993. After marrying Marc in the following year, she broke into the wrestling business through the World Wrestling Federation.

==World Wrestling Federation==
===1996-1998===
Rena Mero made her World Wrestling Federation debut as Sable at ''[[WrestleMania XII]]'' in March 1996, escorting [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] to the ring as he took on the returning [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]].<ref name=alumni>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wwealumni/sable/bio/|title=Sable's Alumni Profile|accessdate=2007-05-21|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref><ref name=release>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/08/11/577986.html|title=WWE, Sable part ways|author=Jason Clevett|publisher=SLAM!

Rena's first major [[List of professional wrestling slang#A|angles]] as Sable involved her then real-life husband, who debuted at ''WrestleMania XII'' as "Wildman" Marc Mero. After witnessing Sable being [[kayfabe]] mistreated by Helmsley backstage, the "Wildman" attacked Helmsley and took Sable as his [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]].<ref name=alumni/> She remained Mero's manager until his injury in 1997. Between 1997 and the time he returned from his injury in 1998, Sable became popular on her own.<ref name=alumni/> In her next storyline, a returning Marc Mero (now known as "Marvelous" Marc Mero) became jealous, refused to let Sable get any of the spotlight, and mistreated her. The duo entered into a [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Gertrude Vachon|Luna Vachon]] and [[Dustin Rhodes|The Artist Formerly Known as Goldust]], which climaxed in a match at ''[[WrestleMania XIV]]''. Sable delivered a superkick to Goldust and executed a [[powerbomb]] (known as the "Sable bomb") on Luna. She also delivered a [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#TKO|TKO]] and pinned Luna to finish the match, with the crowd chanting Sable's name in the background.<ref name="oww">{{cite web|title=Online World of Wrestling: Sable's profile|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/sable.html|accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref> At the following [[pay-per-view]] event, ''[[WWE Unforgiven#1998|Unforgiven 1998]]'', Sable lost to Luna in the promotion's first [[List of professional wrestling match types#Bra and Panties match|Evening Gown match]] after being distracted by Marc Mero.<ref name="insidepulse">{{cite web|title=Inside Pulse - Unforgiven 1998|url=http://www.insidepulse.com/article.php?contentid=36529|accessdate=July 4|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

After Marc's interference at ''Unforgiven'', Sable came to the ring and challenged Marc to a match. Sable then kicked him in the groin and delivered a Sable bomb to get revenge.<ref name=alumni/> Sable eventually broke away from "Marvelous" Marc Mero, who debuted [[Jacqueline Moore|Jacqueline]] as his new manager, resulting in a storyline feud between the two women.<ref name=alumni/> The two met in a [[bikini]] contest in July at ''[[WWF Fully Loaded#1998|Fully Loaded 1998]]''. Sable, only wearing impressions of hands painted on her exposed [[breast]]s, won the contest. However, the next night on ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]'', [[Vince McMahon]] disqualified Sable from the previous night's contest since she did not actually wear a bikini. The match was then awarded to Jacqueline. In response, Sable gave McMahon the double [[finger (gesture)|finger]].<ref name="crz">{{cite web|title=CRZ.net: RAW 27 July 1998|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/980727.html|accessdate=July 4|accessyear=2006}}</ref> At ''[[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam 1998]]'', Sable and her mystery partner, federation newcomer [[Adam Copeland|Edge]], defeated Marc Mero and Jacqueline in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#mixed tag team match|mixed tag team match]].<ref name="oww"/>

Sable and Jacqueline faced off for the newly reinstated [[WWE Women's Championship|WWF Women's Title]] on the [[September 21]], [[1998]] edition of ''RAW''. Jacqueline claimed the title after Marc Mero interfered.<ref name="crz2">{{cite web|title=CRZ.net: RAW 21 September 1998|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/980921.html|accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref> However, on [[November 15]] [[1998]] at ''[[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]]'', she [[List of professional wrestling slang#D|dropped]] the title to Sable, who won after powerbombing both Marc and Jacqueline during the match.<ref name="oww"/><ref name=alumni/> During this time, Rena had a guest appearance on an episode of the [[USA Network]] show ''[[Pacific Blue (TV series)|Pacific Blue]]''.<ref name=slam>{{cite web | url = http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/jan11_sable.html | title = Sable looks beyond wrestling | author = Greg Oliver | publisher = SLAM! Sports | accessdate=2007-06-03 | date = January 11, 1999}}</ref><ref name="askmen"/> Sable then briefly entered a storyline where she was forced to play a subservient role to Vince and [[Shane McMahon]], but the storyline did not progress very far.

Sable holds the record for most diva match wins in 1998, ahead of both Luna Vachon and Jacqueline.<ref name="crz3">{{cite web|title="CRZ.net: RAW 16 November 1998|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/981116.html|accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref>

===Heel turn (1999)===
In 1999, Sable was [[kayfabe]] attacked by a masked woman named Spider Lady, who turned out to be Luna. Sable defeated Luna in a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Texas Bullrope match|Strap Match]] at the ''[[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]]'' after an assist from a [[List of professional wrestling slang#P|planted]] female Sable fan, who turned out to be WWF newcomer [[Terri Poch|Tori]].<ref name="oww"/> Tori's debut signified a change in Sable's persona.

After the ''Royal Rumble'', Rena (under her Sable ring name) was featured as the cover girl for the April 1999 issue of ''Playboy''.<ref name=slam/><ref name=alumni/> The issue was the hottest selling issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' in 15 years. Surrounding the release of the issue, the Sable character turned [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] by "going Hollywood" and having an inflated ego. Rarely defending her title, Sable continually berated her fan Tori, and she feuded with both Tori and Luna Vachon (who had turned [[face (professional wrestling)|face]]). She debuted a new [[catch phrase]]: "This is for all the women who want to be me and all the men who come to see me" and a dance move called "the [[grinding (dance)|grind]]."<ref name=alumni/> The feud with Tori led to a match at ''[[WrestleMania XV]]''. During the contest, [[Nicole Bass]] debuted as Sable's [[bodyguard]] and helped Sable win the match.<ref name="owow">{{cite web|title=Official Women of Wrestling: Sable 1999 Updates|url=http://www.owow.com/Ringsidewith/Sable/99Update.htm|accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref>

Sable went on with Nicole Bass making Bass do all of her dirty work. Sable continued to hold the championship for almost 6 months, but on [[May 10]] [[1999]], [[Debra Marshall|Debra]] "won" the Women's Championship from Sable in an Evening Gown Match. Normally in an Evening Gown Match, the winner is the woman who forcibly removes her opponent's dress, which Sable did. However, ([[kayfabe]]) [[List of authority figures in professional wrestling#Commissioners|WWF Commissioner]] [[Shawn Michaels]] ruled that the woman who had lost her dress was the winner, making Debra the new Women's Champion. With this, Sable became the first woman to lose a title without losing it by [[Pin (wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]].<ref name="askmen"/>

=== Post-WWF career (1999-2001) ===
In June 1999, Rena Mero quit the WWF and filed a $110 million lawsuit against the company, citing allegations of [[sexual harassment]] and unsafe working conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/08/14/583136.html|title=Sable released by WWE|author=TJ Madigan|publisher=Calgary Sun|accessdate=2007-06-03|date=August 14, 2004}}</ref><ref name=release/><ref name=homelife/> During the course of the lawsuit, [[Vince McMahon]] counter-sued Rena over control of the stagename "Sable".<ref name="owow"/> Mero reduced the amount she was seeking in damages, and they eventually settled out of court in August 1999.<ref name=release/> Subsequently, her husband Marc was released from his WWF contract. Rena Mero used her real name for her appearance in the September 1999 issue of ''Playboy''. After her WWF exit, she made an on-camera appearance as an audience member on [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''. Her WWF contract's non-compete clause was still legally valid, preventing her from working for WCW -- although she stated that she wanted to.

During this time, Rena made appearances on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. She also made appearances on television shows such as ''[[Relic Hunter]]'' and ''[[First Wave]]'' and in the film ''[[Corky Romano]]'' as a female bouncer. She released her autobiography, entitled ''Undefeated'' in August 2000.<ref name="askmen"/> She also released a [[comic book]] entitled ''The 10th Muse'' starring herself as a superhero.<ref name="cbr">{{cite web|title=WOLFMAN TAG TEAMS WITH RENA MERO ON '10TH MUSE'|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=2168|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2006-07-11}}</ref>

On [[November 13]] and [[November 14]] [[2001]], she appeared as the on-camera "CEO" of the newly formed [[X Wrestling Federation|XWF]], but these would be her only appearances with the company.<ref name="oww"/> In 2003, she announced that she and Marc Mero were getting [[divorce]]d.<ref name="askmen"/> Despite this, she continues to use his surname publicly and professionally.

===Return to WWE (2003-2004)===
[[Image:Sable clapping.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Sable in 2003]]
Rena returned to the World Wrestling Federation (now known as [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]) on the [[April 3]] [[2003]] episode of ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]'', reprising her role as Sable. Sable continued as a heel and spent several months in a storyline with new Playboy covergirl [[Torrie Wilson]]. Sable would follow Torrie down to her matches, talk with her backstage, and on one occasion she left Torrie in a tag match alone to fend for herself. Sable eventually challenged Torrie Wilson to a showdown bikini contest at [[WWE Judgment Day#2003|Judgment Day 2003]]. After Sable got the bigger applause, Torrie removed another layer of clothing, and [[List of professional wrestling match types#Special referee|Special Guest Referee]] [[Tazz]] declared Torrie the winner. After the match, Torrie went up to Sable and kissed her before exiting the ring. Sable had a brief feud with the guest judge Tazz, dumping water on him on the following edition of ''SmackDown!'', as a means of gaining revenge for declaring Wilson the winner.

Sable then feuded with [[Stephanie McMahon]] in a storyline where she was Vince McMahon's [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]].<ref name=release /> Vince appointed Sable as Stephanie McMahon's personal assistant against Stephanie's will, sparking the feud between the duo. During the feud, they competed in several catfights, a food fight, a parking lot brawl, and a match where Sable bashed a clipboard over Stephanie's head. At ''[[WWE Vengeance#2003|Vengeance 2003]]'', Sable defeated Stephanie after interference by her new ally, [[Matt Bloom|A-Train]]. At ''[[SummerSlam (2003)|SummerSlam]]'', Sable accompanied A-Train in his match against [[The Undertaker]], which he lost. After the match, The Undertaker held Sable so that Stephanie could use a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|Spear]] attack on her. After ''Summerslam'', Mr. McMahon and Sable focused on getting rid of Stephanie for good, so Vince made an [["I Quit" match]] at ''[[WWE No Mercy#2003|No Mercy 2003]]''. In the match, Sable slapped Stephanie and was attacked by [[Linda McMahon]]. She also handed Vince the lead pipe that he used to choke Stephanie out for the win.<ref name="oww"/> During the contest, she was notably "heckled" by play-by-play commentator [[Michael Cole]].

Sable briefly became a face again when she appeared on the cover of ''Playboy'' magazine for the third time in her career. On the cover, she appeared with fellow diva Torrie Wilson, making them the first WWE Divas to pose in ''Playboy'' together. Surrounding the release of the cover, the duo feuded with ''RAW'' divas [[Stacy Keibler]] and [[Jackie Gayda|Miss Jackie]], even though all four women were faces at the time. The two teams squared off at ''[[WrestleMania XX]]'' in an Interpromotional Tag Team Evening Gown match, but the divas started the match in their underwear, making it more of a [[lingerie]] match.<ref name="oww"/> Sable and Wilson were victorious.<ref name=release/> The change was rumored to have occurred because Sable had suffered damage to her [[breast]].<ref name="owow2">{{cite web|title="Official Women of Wrestling: Sable, 2004 Updates"|url=http://www.owow.com/Ringsidewith/Sable/04Update.htm|accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref>

Following ''WrestleMania XX'', Sable quickly turned heel again and engaged in another short feud with Torrie Wilson. The feud culminated in a match at ''[[WWE Great American Bash#2004|The Great American Bash 2004]]'', which Sable won. Sable's final appearance in WWE would be on ''SmackDown!'' when she, [[Dawn Marie Psaltis|Dawn Marie]], and Torrie Wilson accompanied [[Eddie Guerrero]] to the ring in his lowrider. On [[August 10]] [[2004]], WWE's official website announced that Rena Mero and WWE had parted ways.<ref name="owow2"/> Mero claimed that she left the company to spend more time with her family.<ref name=homelife/>
