{{Nihongo|'''''Lupin III'''''|ルパン三世|rupan sansei}} is an [[anime]] and [[manga]] [[media franchise]] created by [[Monkey Punch|Kazuhiko Kato]] under the [[pen name]] of "Monkey Punch". The franchise follows the adventures of a gang of thieves led by [[Arsène Lupin III]], the grandson of [[Arsène Lupin]], the [[gentleman thief]] of [[Maurice Leblanc]]'s series of novels.<ref name="History"/> Lupin and his gang travel throughout the world to steal treasures and escape from the law.

The first ''Lupin III'' manga, which first appeared in ''[[Weekly Manga Action]]'' beginning on [[August 10]], [[1967]],<ref name="Manga"/> spawned a media franchise that includes numerous manga, anime television series, [[feature film]]s, [[OVA|direct-to-video]] releases, [[television special]]s, music CDs, [[video game]]s, and a [[Musical theatre|musical]]. In addition, WhiteLight Entertainment, a production company owned by [[Gerald R. Molen]], purchased the live action theatrical rights to ''Lupin III'' in 2003<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-02-27/lupin-iii-coming-to-hollywood|title=Lupin III Coming to Hollywood |publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> and the [[Hollywood]] production is scheduled to be released in [[2009]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=

|title=Lupin the 3rd|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

Several different companies own the North American distribution rights to many ''Lupin III'' properties, including [[Geneon Entertainment]], which provided the television broadcast rights for 26 episodes of the second television series to [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] during 2003.<ref name="as"/>

==Overall plot==
Each project within the ''Lupin III'' [[Fictional universe|universe]] has its own plot. The overall plot of the franchise centers on the international thief [[Arsène Lupin III]]. He is joined by [[Daisuke Jigen]], Lupin's closest ally; [[Fujiko Mine]], the ''[[femme fatale]]'' and Lupin's love interest who works against Lupin more often than with him; and [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]], a master swordsman and the descendant of [[Ishikawa Goemon]], the legendary Japanese bandit. Lupin is often chased by Inspector [[Koichi Zenigata]] of the [[ICPO]], the descendent of [[Zenigata Heiji]]. A rather cynical detective, Zenigata has made it his life's mission to chase Lupin across the globe in hopes of arresting him.

== Cast of characters ==
[[Image:Lupin gang.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Lupin and his gang.]]

'''[[Arsène Lupin III]]''' (ルパン三世 ''Rupan sansei'') is the grandson of [[Arsène Lupin]]. He is the world's most wanted [[thief]]. Often in his adventures, he takes it upon himself and his gang to foil other criminals engaged in more serious crimes. He sometimes appears incompetent, but mostly as a charade to catch his opponents off guard. While he has been arrested and thrown in jail on a number of occasions, he has always managed to break out. He also has a fondness for fancy gadgets from time to time, such as in [[Castle of Cagliostro]] where his belt features many small gadgets. His infatuation with Fujiko Mine is perhaps his biggest weakness, as it often lands him in undesirable situations.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinthethird.info/personages/char_lupin_en.html|publisher=Giovanni Di Chiara|title=Lupin III European Page - Lupin III Character Profiles (Lupin)|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref><ref name="DoDVD"/>
<div style="clear: left"></div>

'''[[Daisuke Jigen]]''' (次元 大介 ''Jigen Daisuke'') is Lupin's marksman. He can perform a 0.3-second quick-draw and shoots with amazing accuracy. He prefers to conceal his eyes using his hat, as it gives him a more enigmatic appearance. His hat is also an important element to his dead shot accuracy because he uses it for aiming and target acquisition. He is also proficient in the use of many different firearms, such as machine guns, sniper rifles, and even a [[PTRS]] anti-tank rifle. In the opening of the [[Playstation 2]] video game, [[Lupin the 3rd: Treasure of the Sorcerer King| Treasure of the Sorcerer King]], Jigen assembles his pistol from composite parts and fires a shot through a door with 100% accuracy before an enemy can finish turning the doorknob.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinthethird.info/personages/char_jigen_en.html|publisher=Giovanni Di Chiara|title=Lupin III European Page - Lupin III Character Profiles (Jigen)|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref><ref name="DoDVD"/>
<div style="clear: left"></div>

'''[[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]]''' (石川 五ェ門 ''Ishikawa Goemon'') is the thirteenth generation of renegade samurai, beginning with the real-life historical figure [[Ishikawa Goemon]] (石川 五右衛門). He has a sword called [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII#Goemon.27s sword - Zantetsuken|Zantetsuken]] (斬鉄剣), meaning "iron-cutting sword", which can cut through anything. However, Zantetsuken is usually used to cut inanimate objects, which Goemon considers unworthy of his blade and often mutters his catchphrase "once again, I have cut a worthless object" after doing so. Objects cut by Zantetsuken will fall apart a couple of seconds after he sweeps through them with his blade. He is usually quiet and participates in Lupin's exploits less frequently than Jigen.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinthethird.info/personages/char_goemon_en.html|publisher=Giovanni Di Chiara|title=Lupin III European Page - Lupin III Character Profiles (Goemon)|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref><ref name="DoDVD"/>
<div style="clear: left"></div>

'''[[Fujiko Mine]]''' (峰 不二子 ''Mine Fujiko'') is Lupin's love (or rather lust) interest. She is sometimes an associate in his schemes, sometimes a rival, knowing full well that his infatuation with her will mean that he will forgive her for double-crossing him at times. Despite her appearances, Fujiko is an extremely intelligent and crafty person and will use her feminine charms to get what she wants from any man. She is also an expert when it comes to firearms and even rivals Lupin when it comes to her burglary and disguise skills. She will also routinely make deals with Zenigata or Lupin's current enemy in an attempt to gain her freedom or to hopefully gain a piece of the loot he is after. While Lupin often knows Fujiko is only using him, she usually makes off with most or all of his loot.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinthethird.info/personages/char_fujiko_en.html|publisher=Giovanni Di Chiara|title=Lupin III European Page - Lupin III Character Profiles (Fujiko)|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref><ref name="DoDVD"/>
<div style="clear: left"></div>
[[Image:Zenigata.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Zenigata]]

'''[[Koichi Zenigata|Inspector Zenigata]]''' (銭形警部 ''Zenigata-keibu''), full name '''Koichi Zenigata''' (銭形 幸一 ''Zenigata Kōichi'') is a police inspector working for the [[ICPO]]. He has made it his mission in life to arrest Lupin. Zenigata is based on a famous Japanese crime fighting character named [[Zenigata Heiji]], best known for throwing coins as a weapon. Lupin and Zenigata appear to be the worst of enemies, but they are, in a manner of speaking, friends; in the television special [[Orders to Assassinate Lupin]], Zenigata even teams up with Lupin after the chief of the ICPO takes him off the Lupin case. While usually portrayed as competent but slow at deductions in most of the anime, Zenigata's character in the manga is a very clever and crafty adversary to Lupin.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinthethird.info/personages/char_zenigata_en.html|publisher=Giovanni Di Chiara|title=Lupin III European Page - Lupin III Character Profiles (Zenigata)|accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref><ref name="DoDVD"/>
<br style="clear: both" /> Often referred to by Lupin as "Pops", Zenigata's strengths are his tenacity and his artful style of handcuffing, even at a distance.

== Manga series ==
[[Image:Lupin Manga 1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Tokyopop]]'s cover of the first volume of the original manga series]]The original manga series was published by Futabasha in [[Weekly Manga Action]] from August [[1967]] to April [[1972]].<ref name="Manga">{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/manga|title=Lupin III Encyclopedia - Manga|publisher=Luis A. Cruz|accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>
[[Monkey Punch]]'s main character was the grandson of [[Arsène Lupin]], but [[Arsène Lupin III|Lupin III]] was far from being a gentleman like his grandfather. In this first manga series, Lupin is a lecherous sex maniac with an extreme lust for women that can never be satisfied; yet, he somehow remains a likeable character. According to Monkey Punch, the ''Lupin III'' manga was influenced by ''[[MAD Magazine]]''.<ref name="DoDVD">{{cite video| people = Monkey Punch Interview (DVD Extra)| title = Lupin the 3rd: Dead or Alive| medium = [[DVD]]| publisher = [[Funimation]] }}</ref>[[Image:Lupin official magazine.jpg|thumb|125px|right|[[Futabasha]]'s cover of the spring 2007 issue of the official Lupin III magazine]]

Monkey Punch began publishing the second Lupin manga, ''Shin Lupin III'', also known as ''Lupin III - World's Most Wanted'', on [[June 23]], [[1977]]. The second series ran for 180 chapters.<ref name="Manga"/> A third manga series, ''Lupin III S'', began in January of 1997. Monkey Punch, however, was not involved in this project. The story was written by [[Satozumi Takaguchi]] and the art was done by [[Shusay]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=5771|title=Lupin III S (manga)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> Monkey Punch returned to write the story for the fourth manga series, ''Lupin III Y'', but the art was done by Manatsuki Yamakami. The fourth manga series ran from 1998 until 2004.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=5772|title=Lupin III Y (manga)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> The current manga series is ''Lupin III M'', with story by Monkey Punch and art by Miyama Yukio. The manga is serialized in the ''Lupin III Official Magazine,'' a quarterly magazine published by [[Futabasha]], which also contains Lupin news, information on Lupin products and merchandise, and fan art.<ref name="mag">{{cite web|url=http://www.futabasha.co.jp/?magazine=lupin|title=www.futabasha.co.jp/?magazine=lupin|title=Lupin the 3rd Official Magazine|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref> 

==Adaptations==
===Pilot film===
Following the manga series, [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha|TMS]] and [[Toho]] produced a Lupin III pilot film featuring Lupin in his red jacket outfit. [[Masaaki Osumi]] was brought in to direct, and two different versions, a [[CinemaScope]] version planned for theaters and [[4:3]] television version, were made. The animation was mainly the same for the two versions, but the voice cast varied. [[Kiyoshi Kobayashi]] and [[Eiko Masuyama]], voicing Daisuke Jigen and Fujiko Mine respectively, were the only cast members to not only voice their characters in both versions of the pilot, but also in every other incarnation of [[Lupin III]], with the exception of [[Fuma Conspiracy]] ([[Lupin III#Original animation videos (OVAs)|see below]]). By the time the pilot was completed in 1969, budget concerns and other problems between Toho and TMS caused the film to never reach theaters. [[Masaaki Osumi]] then moved on to direct several episodes of the first Lupin III television series (see below).<ref name="History">{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime|title=Lupin III Encyclopedia - History |publisher=Luis A.

Cruz|accessdate=2007-09-01}} </ref>

The two versions of the pilot films were later released in 1989 as a part of the ''Lupin III Secret Files'' [[direct-to-video|OVA]], which also contained trailers for ''[[Mystery of Mamo]]'', ''[[Castle of Cagliostro]]'', and ''[[Lupin III: Legend of the Gold of Babylon|Legend of the Gold of Babylon]]''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2097|title=Lupin III: Secret Files (OAV)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>

=== Television series ===
{{Main|Lupin III (anime)|Shin Lupin III|Lupin III Part III}}

On [[October 24]] [[1971]], [[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation|YTV]] began airing the first ''Lupin III'' television series. The series, which featured Lupin in his green jacket outfit, lasted for 23 episodes with the last one airing on [[March 26]], [[1972]]. The first seven episodes of the series, along with episodes nine and 12, were directed by [[Masaaki Osumi]], with the remaining episodes being directed jointly by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and [[Isao Takahata]]<ref name="tv1">{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=886|title=Lupin III (TV)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> The director of [[Cowboy Bebop]], [[Shinichiro Watanabe]], revealed during an interview with ''[[Newtype (magazine)|Newtype]] Japan'' that he was heavily influenced by the work of director [[Masaaki Osumi]] on the first television series.<ref>{{Citation

The second ''Lupin III'' television series began airing on [[Nippon Television|NTV]] on [[October 3]], [[1977]]. In this series, Lupin began wearing a red jacket instead of the green one he wore during the first television series. The series lasted for 155 episodes, with the last one airing on [[October 24]], [[1980]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=885|title=Lupin III: Part II (TV)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> Episodes 145 and 155 were directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] under the [[pseudonym]] of Teruki Tsutomu, and they marked his final involvement in making television animation before exclusively working on feature films.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime/second_series/farewell_my_beloved_lupin|title=Lupin III Encyclopedia - Episode 155 "Farewell My Beloved Lupin" |publisher=Luis A.

Episode 99 of the second television series, titled Kōya ni Chitta Combat Magnum (The Combat Magnum Scattered in the Wasteland), which aired on [[September 3]], [[1979]], was the first episode of any anime series to be broadcast in stereo.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime/second_series/the_combat_magnum_scattered_in_the_wasteland|title=Lupin III Encyclopedia - Episode 099 "The Combat Magnum Scattered in the Wasteland" |publisher=Luis A. Cruz|accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> After that episode, several other episodes of the second ''Lupin III'' television series were broadcast in stereo.

The third television series began airing on NTV on [[March 3]], [[1984]]. In this series, Lupin wore a pink jacket instead of the red one he wore in the previous series. The series lasted for 50 episodes and ended on [[September 28]], [[1985]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=887|title=Lupin III: Part III (TV)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> The only other time that Lupin wore a pink jacket again was in the feature film ''The Legend of the Gold of Babylon'', which was released in theaters while the third television series was still in broadcast.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=642|title=Lupin III: The Legend of the Gold of Babylon (movie)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

In France the series was renamed ''Edgar le détective cambrioleur'' ("Edgar the Burglar Detective") due to problems with the estate of [[Maurice Leblanc]], creator of the original [[Arsène Lupin]].

There was also a "Lupin in Space"-type series to be produced called ''Lupin VIII'', featuring the descendants of Lupin, Goemon, Jigen and Zenigata in space. The project was a French-Japanese co-production. The production folded when LeBlanc's estate wanted more money for the use of the Lupin name than the budget allowed.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2155|title= Lupin VIII (TV)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> Two scripts were written, and one episode, entitled "The Man From the Past", was fully animated and had a music and sound effects track, but the voice-overs were never recorded.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime/lupin_viii|title=Lupin III Encyclopedia - Lupin VIII|publisher=Luis A.

===1974 live action theatrical feature ===
{{main|Strange Psychokinetic Strategy}}

Because the pilot film never made it to theaters, the first ''Lupin III'' theatrical feature was a live action movie produced in 1974 during the hiatus between the first and second television series. The motion picture included all of the main cast members with the exception of Goemon Ishikawa XIII. Lupin wore neither his red nor his green jacket outfit in the movie, but rather a white jacket with an ascot.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime/film/strange_psychokinetic_strategy|title=Lupin III Encyclopedia - Strange Psychokinetic Strategy (1974)|publisher=Luis A. Cruz|accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>

As opposed to the dark theme of the first television series, the live action feature was very heavy on [[slapstick]] and physics-defying stunts, but it was a more faithful adaptation of the original ''Lupin III'' manga than the television program.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/5151.php|title=Anime on DVD: Strange Psychokinetic Strategy DVD Review|author=Chris Beveridge|publisher=Anime on DVD|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>

=== Animated theatrical features ===
{{main|List of Lupin III animated theatrical features}}

The first animated theatrical feature starring the character of ''Lupin III'', released on [[December 16]] [[1978]], was simply titled ''Lupin III'',<ref name="History"/> although it was subsequently released as ''Lupin vs. The Clone'', ''Mystery of Mamo'', and, most recently, ''Secret of Mamo''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1040|title=Lupin III: The Secret of Mamo (movie)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> As of today, ''[[Secret of Mamo|The Secret of Mamo]]'' has received the most English dubs of any anime title, with a total of four different dubs.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime/film/secret_of_mamo|title=Lupin III Encyclopedia - Secret of Mamo (1978)|publisher=Luis A. Cruz|accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>

Following ''[[Mystery of Mamo|Lupin vs the Clone]]'', [[Toho]] brought in [[Hayao Miyazaki]] to direct ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]''. The movie, which received its title from the [[Maurice Leblanc]] novel ''La Comtesse de Cagliostro'' (The Countess of Cagliostro),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/lupin/faq.html#true|title=I heard that there was a real Count Cagliostro. Is it true?|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref> was released one day short of the one year anniversary of ''Lupin vs the Clone'', on [[December 15]], [[1979]]. While initially, the film was not a box office success,<ref name="History"/> and was considered atypical, with Lupin too noble and not egoistical enough,<ref>{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |title=The Animated Movie Guide|year=2005 |month=October |publisher=Chicago Review Press |id=ISBN 1-556-52591-5 }}</ref> it gained popularity through numerous re-releases and was even voted as "the best anime in history" by the readers of ''[[Animage]]'' magazine prior to the release of ''[[Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind]]'' in 1984.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/lupin/faq.html#castle|title=Nausicaa.net - What Is Castle of Cagliostro?|publisher=Team Ghiblink|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref>

Following ''Cagliostro'', three more ''Lupin III'' theatrical features were released. ''[[Lupin III: Legend of the Gold of Babylon|Legend of the Gold of Babylon]]'' was released in theaters on [[July 13]], [[1985]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=642|title=Lupin III: The Legend of the Gold of Babylon (movie)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> Ten years after ''Babylon'', ''[[Farewell to Nostradamus|To Hell with Nostradamus]]'' was released into Japanese cinemas on [[April 22]], [[1995]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2098|title=Lupin III: Farewell to Nostradamus (movie)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref>

The creator of ''Lupin III'', [[Monkey Punch|Kazuhiko Kato]], was asked to direct the last theatrical to be released, ''[[Dead or Alive (Lupin the 3rd)|Dead or Alive]]'' for a lack of another director.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1039&page=22|title=Lupin III: Dead or Alive Trivia|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> Although he was credited as chief director for the production, Monkey Punch said that he left most of the work for his assistant directors and only directed the opening and ending sequences while acting as consultant for everything else.<ref name="DoDVD"/><ref name="History"/> ''Dead or Alive'' was released into Japanese theaters on [[April 20]] [[1996]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1039|title=Lupin III: Dead or Alive|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> Following the production of the movie, Monkey Punch stated that the process was exhausting he would not like to direct another anime again.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2003-11-13|title=Interview: Monkey Punch by Allen Divers|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref>

=== Television specials ===
{{Main|List of Lupin III television specials}}
On [[April 4]] [[1989]], the television special ''[[Bye Bye Liberty Crisis]]'',<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2090|title=Lupin III: Bye Bye Liberty Crisis (special)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> aired on [[Nippon Television|NTV]]. Every summer since then featured a new 90 minute Lupin III television special that would air on [[Nippon Television|NTV]] at 9:03<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6837|title=Lupin III: Seven Days Rhapsody (special)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> on Friday evening, usually in the last week of July or the first week of August (''[[Bye-Bye Liberty Crisis]]'' and ''[[Seven Days Rhapsody]]'' diverted from that trend, however).

The latest television special is Rupan Sansei: Kiri no Elusive (ルパン三世 霧のエリューシヴ). Produced by [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha|TMS]] with animation by Telecom (the animation studio responsible for ''Farewell to Nostradamus'' and ''Castle of Cagliostro''), the special features the return of one of the villains of the original television series, Mamo Kyousuke. The special is a part of the 40th anniversary celebration of the original manga.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=8335|title=Lupin III: Elusiveness of the Fog (special)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.tms-e.com/on_air/lupin/2007tvsp.html|title=ルパン三世 霧のエリューシヴ (Original Japanese website for the special)|publisher=[[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]]|accessdate=2007-07-17}}</ref>

===Original animation videos (OAVs)===
Only two original ''Lupin III'' features were released as OVAs. ''[[The Plot of the Fuma Clan]]'' was the first of the two, released in Japan in 1987. The 74 minutes feature is unique amongst other Lupin productions because it's the only one to feature an entire voice cast replacement. Because of budget problems, [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha|TMS]] decided not to employ the regular voice cast for the production. Instead, the studio hired a different cast to save money.

[[Yasuo Yamada]], the voice actor for Lupin, had always taken pride in his role as the title character. After the voice cast replacement, due to a misunderstanding, he thought that [[Monkey Punch]] had lobbied the producers for a new voice actor. Following the production, Monkey Punch did try to reassure Yamada that he had nothing to do with the producers decision to use a new cast, and the regulars were reinstated with the first television special, ''[[Bye Bye Liberty]]''. Despite that, relations between Yamada and Monkey Punch were permanently strained by the affair.<ref name="History"/>

The second OVA was released on [[April 3]] [[2002]] under the title ''Rupan Sansei: ikiteita majutsushi'' ''([[Return of the Magician]]''). The OVA was created as a part of the 30-year anniversary of the first television series, and thus it featured the return of one of the original villains of the series, the magician Pycal (hence the title).<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime/ova/return_of_the_magician|title=Lupin III Encyclopedia - Return of the Magician (2002)|publisher=Luis A.

== Video games ==
Over the years, many ''Lupin III''-related video games were released in Japan and abroad. The first video game featuring the character of ''Lupin III'' to make it to the [[United States]] was a [[Laserdisc video game]], only ever seen in coin-operated arcades, titled ''[[Cliff Hanger (video game)|Cliff Hanger]]''. Released in 1983 by a company known as Stern,<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/games/arcade/cliff_hanger|title=Lupin III Encyclopedia - Cliff Hanger|publisher=Luis A. Cruz|accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> the video game featured clips from the first two ''Lupin III'' animated theatrical features, [[Mystery of Mamo|Lupin vs the Clone]] and [[The Castle of Cagliostro]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.dragons-lair-project.com/games/pages/ch.asp|title=Dragon's Lair Project - Cliff Hanger|publisher=Jeff Kinder & Dave Hallock|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> 

Aside from ''Cliff Hanger'', the only ''Lupin III'' game to be released in the United States is ''[[Lupin III: Treasure of the Sorcerer King]]'' (released in Japan as ''Rupan Sansei Majutsu-Ou no Isan'' (ルパン三世 魔術王の遺産)), developed in Japan by [[Banpresto]] for the [[Playstation 2]]. The stealth-action game, similar to [[Metal Gear Solid]],<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.g4tv.com/xplay/features/541/Lupin_the_3rd_Treasure_of_the_Sorcerer_King_PS2_Review.html|title=X Play's review of Treasure of the Sorcerer King|author=X Play|publisher=[[G4 (TV channel)|G4]]|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> was originally released in Japan on [[November 28]], [[2002]].

It was praised for its voice acting, soundtrack and level of faithfulness to the source material, but criticized for its poor graphics and weak enemy [[artificial intelligence|AI]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/lupin3majutsuounoisan/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=tabs&tag=tabs;reviews|title=Lupin the Third: Treasure Of the Sorcerer King Review|publisher=CNET Networks|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref>

[[Geneon Entertainment]] released two music CDs in the United States.

== English language licensing and release information ==
[[Streamline Pictures]] was the first company to adapt ''Lupin III'' for English language release in the United States. The first film they adapted was ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', which was released on [[VHS]] on [[September 1]], [[1992]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079833/sales|title=Merchendise for Rupan sansei: Kariosutoro no shiro|publisher=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> Streamline went on to release [[Mystery of Mamo|Lupin vs the Clone]] (as ''The Mystery of Mamo''),<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animejump.com/index.php?module=prodreviews&func=showcontent&id=192|title=Lupin III Mystery of Mamo review|author=Mike Toole|publisher=Anime Jump|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> as well as episodes 145 and 155 of the second television series.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/video/lupin/#e_capers_vhs|title=Lupin III Video List|publisher=Team Ghiblink|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> Because Monkey Punch did not seek permission to use the Lupin name from the estate of [[Maurice Leblanc]], when Lupin material was licensed for overseas usage, the name had to be changed. [[Streamline Pictures]] resorted to referring to Lupin as "Wolf" in their releases, which is the English translation of the French word "Lupin".<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079833/trivia|title=Trivia for Rupan sansei: Kariosutoro no shiro |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

[[Manga Entertainment]] purchased the North American distribution rights to the animated theatrical feature ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' after Streamline went out of business. Because the Lupin name passed into the [[public domain]] in the early 1990s, Manga did not have the same legal issues with using the name as Streamline did.<ref name="portal"> {{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=3053|title=Anime News Network's Lupin III Portal|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> Manga released the film on DVD in 2000 and later went on to release a special edition of the film on [[August 29]], [[2006]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=127|title=Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro (movie)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

In 2002, [[FUNimation]] Entertainment purchased the rights to eight of the television specials, from ''[[Orders to Assassinate Lupin]]'' to ''[[$1 Money Wars]]'', as well as the feature films ''[[Farewell to Nostradamus]]'' and ''[[Dead or Alive (Lupin the 3rd)|Dead or Alive]]''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-02-27/lupin-iii-movies-licensed-retitled|title=Lupin III Movies Licensed, Retitled|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> FUNimation has released all of their Lupin III properties on DVD in the United States.

[[Geneon Entertainment]], which was at the time known as Pioneer, began distributing the second television series in the [[United States]] in [[2003]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-05-28/pioneer-confirms-lupin-license|title=Pioneer Confirms Lupin License|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>  Geneon hired Phuuz Entertainment Inc. to adapt and translate the series.<ref>{{citeweb|url=

Until 2006, [[Animeigo]] owned the North American distribution rights to the OVA ''[[The Plot of the Fuma Clan|The Fuma Conspiracy]]'' and the animated theatrical feature ''[[Lupin III: Legend of the Gold of Babylon| The Legend of the Gold of Babylon]]'', which they released using the name ''Rupan III'' (the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] pronunciation of Lupin's name) due to the same legal issues that Streamline had.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=641|title=Lupin III: The Fuma Conspiracy |publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>  but the license for those two movies is now owned by [http://www.discotekmedia.com/ Discotek Media], along with the 1974 live action film, ''[[Strange Psychokinetic Strategy]]''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-08-30/new-anime-distributor|title=New Anime Distributor|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

[[Tokyopop]] owns the North American distribution rights to two of the [[manga]] series. The company has finished releasing the first manga series and is now in the process of translating and releasing the second manga series under the title ''Lupin III - World's Most Wanted''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1632|title=Lupin III (manga)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=4452|title=Lupin III: World's Most Wanted (manga)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

==Reception==
Reception of the various English adaptations of ''Lupin III'' have been relatively positive, although some titles have received mixed reviews. Both of [[Manga Entertainment]]'s releases of the ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' received ''DVD Talk Collector Series'' recommendation status, the highest status given by the review website [[DVD Talk|DVDtalk.com]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=672|title=Castle of Cagliostro Review|author=Earl Cressey|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read.php?ID=23472|title=The Castle of Cagliostro - Special Edition Review|author=Jamie S. Rich|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref> Chris Beveridge of AnimeOnDVD.com gave the film a grade of "A+", although he disliked [[Manga Entertainment]]'s use of PG-13 level language in the English dub.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/211.php
|title=Castle of Cagliostro Review|author=Chris Beveridge|publisher=AnimeOnDVD|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>

Both Chris Beveridge of Anime On DVD and Mike Crandol of Anime News Network disliked the dub of the second television series because the company used many modern references and updated dialogue for a series that was released in the late 1970s, although the series itself received a positive overall review from both web sites.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/1656.php

The [[List of Lupin III television specials|''Lupin III'' television specials]] and [[List of Lupin III animated theatrical features|theatrical features]] released by [[FUNimation Entertainment|FUNimation]] have received reviews varying from positive to mixed. The most well received of FUNimation's releases is ''Island of Assassins'', with Chris Beveridge of Anime On DVD describing it as "the best non-TV Lupin experience...since the Castle of Cagliostro",<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3840.php
