'''Chromosome 2''' is one of the 23 pairs of [[chromosome]]s in [[human]]s. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 2 is the second largest human chromosome, spanning more than 237 million [[base pair]]s <ref name="Generation">{{cite journal | author=Hillier et al | title=Generation and annotation of the DNA sequences of human chromosomes 2 and 4 | journal=Nature | year=2005 | pages=724-31 | volume=434 | issue=7034  | id=PMID 15815621}}</ref> (the building material of [[DNA]]) and representing almost 8% of the total DNA in [[cell (biology)|cells]].

Identifying [[gene]]s on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 2 likely contains between 1,300 and 1,800 genes{{Fact|date=January 2007}}, including those of the HOXD [[homeobox]] gene cluster.

Chromosome 2 is widely accepted to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral chromosomes. <ref name="fusion">[http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome_2.htm Human Chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral chromosomes] by Alec MacAndrew; accessed 18 May 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-WAHpC0Ah0 Evidence of Common Ancestry: Human Chromosome 2] (video) 2007</ref> The evidence for this includes:

* The correspondence of chromosome 2 to two ape chromosomes. The closest human relative, the [[chimpanzee]], has near-identical DNA sequences to human chromosome 2, but they are found in two separate chromosomes. The same is true of the more distant [[gorilla]] and [[orangutan]]. <ref name="compare">{{cite journal | author=Yunis and Prakash | title=The origin of man: a chromosomal pictorial legacy | journal=Science | year=1982 | pages=1525-1530 | volume=215 | id=PMID 7063861}}</ref><ref name="similarities">[http://www.gate.net/~rwms/hum_ape_chrom.html Human and Ape Chromosomes]; accessed 8 September 2007.</ref>
* The presence of a [[Vestigial structure|vestigial]] [[centromere]]. Normally a chromosome has just one centromere, but in chromosome 2 we see remnants of a second. <ref name="centromeres">{{cite journal | author=Avarello et al | title=Evidence for an ancestral alphoid domain on the long arm of human chromosome 2 | journal=Human Genetics | year=1992 | pages=247-9 | volume=89 | id=PMID 1587535}}</ref>
* The presence of vestigial [[telomere]]s. These are normally found only at the ends of a chromosome, but in chromosome 2 we see additional telomere sequences in the middle. <ref name="telomeres">{{cite journal | author=IJdo et al | title=Origin of human chromosome 2: an ancestral telomere-telomere fusion | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | year=1991 | pages=9051-5 | volume=88 | id=PMID 1924367}}</ref>

Chromosome 2 is thus strong evidence in favour of the [[common descent]] of humans and other [[ape]]s. According to researcher J. W. IJdo:

:''We conclude that the locus cloned in cosmids c8.1 and c29B is the relic of an ancient telomere-telomere fusion and marks the point at which two ancestral ape chromosomes fused to give rise to human chromosome 2.''
