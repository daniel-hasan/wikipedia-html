'''Tropical Storm Zeta''' was a late-developing [[tropical storm]] over the central [[Atlantic]] which formed after the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]] had officially ended, and continued into January. It extended the record number of storms in a season to twenty-eight.

Zeta developed late on [[December 29]] and headed to the west. Throughout the storm's lifetime, the [[National Hurricane Center]] continually predicted it would weaken rapidly. Like the previous tropical cyclone [[Hurricane Epsilon (2005)|Hurricane Epsilon]], Zeta defied these predictions. The storm reached its peak strength on [[January 2]], [[2006]] before finally dissipating on [[January 6]]. As Zeta never approached land there was no impact from the storm.

== Storm history ==
{{storm path|Zeta 2005 track.png}}
Late on [[December 29]], [[2005]], a tropical depression developed in the east-central Atlantic from a [[weather front|frontal]] [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] and became a tropical storm early the next day. As this was more than four weeks after the official end of the season, the [[National Hurricane Center]] didn't operationally notice the system until after it had already become a tropical storm.<ref name="ZetaTCR">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Tropical Storm Zeta|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 1|accessyear=2006|format=PDF|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL312005_Zeta.pdf}}</ref> Initially the storm headed to the northwest but stalled late on [[December 31]] before heading westwards, gradually strengthening to winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) as it did so. As with the previous storm, [[Hurricane Epsilon (2005)|Hurricane Epsilon]], the [[National Hurricane Center]] continuously forecast that Zeta would weaken in response to high level shear but Zeta held onto its strength, like Epsilon had done.<ref name="NHC-disc11">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Storm Zeta, 10 p.m. EST, January 1 2006|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 1|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al302005.discus.011.shtml}}</ref>

Tropical Storm Zeta weakened slightly on [[January 2]], before intensifying further to its peak strength with 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) winds. One of the models suggested that Zeta could strengthen further and become a hurricane but this did not occur.<ref name="NHC-disc16">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Storm Zeta, 4 a.m. EST, January 3 2006|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 1|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al302005.discus.016.shtml}}</ref> Tropical Storm Zeta continued to defy forecasts of weakening and on [[January 4]] increasing frustration led NHC forecaster, Dr. [[Lixion Avila]] to say that he had "run out [of] things to say".<ref name="NHC-disc21">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Storm Zeta, 10 a.m. EST, January 4 2006|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 1|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al302005.discus.021.shtml}}</ref>

The effects of wind shear finally took their toll late on [[January 4]], and Zeta's convection began to die down. This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm. The NHC continued to overestimate how quickly Zeta would dissipate and early on [[January 5]] they operationally downgraded Zeta to a depression, which was later confirmed to have been an error.<ref name="NHC-disc24">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Storm Zeta, 4 a.m. EST, January 5 2006|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 1|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al302005.discus.024.shtml}}</ref> Zeta continued to move west-northwestward, barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on [[January 6]] and dissipated into a remnant later that day, finally ending the 2005 season. The remnant low retained its identity for a further day before it dissipated 660 miles (1060 km) southeast of [[Bermuda]].<ref name="ZetaTCR"/>

==Impact and records==
Several of the crews that were taking part in the 2005 [[Atlantic Rowing Race]] were affected with heavy seas and strong adverse winds from Tropical Storm Zeta.<ref name="Rowing">{{cite web|author=Woodvale Events Ltd|title=Atlantic Rowing Race 2005 Press Release: Tropical Storm Zeta|accessdate=May 1|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.atlanticrowingrace.co.uk/news_releases/newsdetail.php?id=32}}</ref> The ship ''Liberty Star'' made several reports of strong winds from Tropical Storm Zeta, including one of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) winds early on [[December 31]], when the ship was about 45&nbsp;miles (75&nbsp;km) north of the center of the storm.

Tropical Storm Zeta never threatened land so no coastal [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|watches or warnings]] were issued.<ref name="ZetaTCR"/> There was no reported damage or fatalities from Zeta.<ref name="ZetaTCR"/>

When Tropical Storm Zeta formed at 0600 [[UTC]] on [[December 31]], it became the second latest-forming tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic, forming about six hours earlier than [[Hurricane Alice (December 1954)|Hurricane Alice]] did in 1954. Zeta is only the second [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic tropical cyclone]] on record to have existed in two calendar years (after Alice).<ref name="ZetaTCR"/> However, lasting seven full days (six of them in 2006), Zeta is the longest-lasting tropical storm on record for the month of January. Tropical Storm Zeta also extended the record number of storms to form in the 2005 season to twenty-eight, seven more than the previous record held by the [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933 season]]. It was the only Atlantic storm to have a name beginning with the letter "Z", since the lists of names for Atlantic storms stop at "W".
