The term '''supersonic''' is used to define a speed that is over the [[speed of sound]] ([[Mach number|Mach]] 1).  At a typical temperature like 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21.1 [[Celsius|°C]]), the threshold value required for an object to be traveling at a supersonic speed is approximately 344 [[metre per second|m/s]], 1,129 [[feet per second|ft/s]], 770 [[Miles per hour|mph]] or 1,238 [[kilometre per hour|km/h]]. Speeds greater than 5 times the speed of sound are often referred to as [[hypersonic]]. Speeds where only some parts of the air around an object (such as the ends of rotor blades) reach supersonic speeds are labeled [[transonic]] (typically somewhere between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2).

Sounds are travelling vibrations (pressure waves) in an elastic medium. In gases sound travels longitudinally at different speeds, mostly depending on the [[molecular mass]] and [[temperature]] of the gas; ([[pressure]] has a little effect). Since air temperature and composition varies significantly with altitude, [[Mach number]]s for aircraft can change without airspeed varying. In water at [[room temperature]] supersonic can be considered as any speed greater than 1,440 m/s or 4,724 ft/s. In solids, sound waves can be longitudinal or transverse and have even higher velocities.

[[Supersonic fracture]] is crack motion faster than the speed of sound in a [[brittle]] material. 

== Supersonic objects ==
Many modern [[fighter aircraft]] are supersonic, but [[Concorde]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-144]] were the only [[supersonic transport|supersonic passenger aircraft]]. Since Concorde's final retirement flight on [[November 26]] [[2003]], there are no supersonic passenger aircraft left in service. Some large [[bombers]], such as the [[Tupolev]] [[Tu-160]] and [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]]/[[Boeing]] [[B-1B]] are also supersonic-capable. The [[F-22]] and [[Eurofighter]] are among the first fighters to be able to sustain supersonic flight for prolonged periods of time without the use of [[afterburners]].

Most modern [[firearm]] [[munition]]s are supersonic, with rifle [[projectiles]] often travelling at speeds approaching [[Mach (speed)|Mach]] 3. 

Most [[spacecraft]], most notably the [[Space Shuttle]] are supersonic at least during portions of their reentry, though the effects on the spacecraft are reduced by low air pressures. During ascent, launch vehicles generally avoid going supersonic below 30&nbsp;km (~98,400 feet) to reduce air drag.

Note that the [[Speed of sound#Speed in ideal gases and in air|speed of sound]] decreases somewhat with altitude, due to lower temperatures found there (typically up to 25&nbsp;km). At even higher altitudes the temperature starts increasing, with the corresponding increase in the speed of sound.<ref> [http://bpesoft.com/s/wleizero/xhac/?M=s eXtreme High Altitude Conditions Calculator] </ref>

== Breaking the sound barrier ==
{{main|Sound barrier}}
Supersonic [[aerodynamics]] are simpler than subsonic because the airsheets at different points along the plane often can't affect each other. Supersonic jets and rocket vehicles require several times greater thrust to push through the extra drag experienced within the [[transonic]] region (around Mach 0.85-1.5). At these speeds [[Aerospace engineer]]s can gently guide air around the [[fuselage]] of the aircraft without producing new [[shock wave]]s but any change in cross sectional area further down the vehicle leads to shock waves along the body.  Designers use the [[Supersonic area rule]] and the [[Whitcomb area rule]] to minimize sudden changes in size.

It should be kept in mind, however, that the aerodynamic principles behind a supersonic aircraft are often more complex than described above due to the fact that such an aircraft must be efficient and stable at supersonic, transonic ''and'' subsonic flight.

At high speeds [[aerodynamic heating]] can occur, so an aircraft must be designed to operate and function under very high temperatures. For example, the [[SR-71 Blackbird]] jet could fly continuously at Mach 3.1 while some parts were above 315°C (600°F).
