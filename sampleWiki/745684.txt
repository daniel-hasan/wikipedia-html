Douglaston represents one of the least traditionally urban communities in New York City, with many areas (particularly those north of Northern Boulevard) having a distinctly upscale [[suburb]]an feel, similar to that of wealthy [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] towns located nearby (such as [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck]]).

Demographically, Douglaston is approximately 72% [[White American]], 23% [[Asian American]] (predominantly of [[Korean American|Korean]] origin),{{fact|date=February 2007}} and also is home to a small number of [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic Americans]] and [[African Americans]]. Over the past 15 years, the number of [[Asian Americans]] in the area has more than doubled, and persons of [[Koreans|Korean]] origin make up the fastest-growing sector of Douglaston's population.<ref>See "2 Affluent Areas of Queens Adjust to a New Ethnic Mix," ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[2003-03-25]], at D1.</ref>

==History==
The earliest known residents of the area that would become Douglaston were the [[Matinecock (tribe)|Matinecock]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Early [[Netherlands|Dutch]] settlers were drawn to the area by the rich land and abundant fishing. [[Thomas Hicks]] settled the area in 1656 on a peninsula first called '''Little Madnan's Neck'''. In 1796, his estate passed to [[Thomas Wickes]], and in 1819, to Wyant Van Zandt, a wealthy merchant, who built a large [[Greek Revival]] mansion in the area. (Today, this mansion houses the [[Douglaston Yacht Club]].)<ref>Kenneth T. Jackson: ''The Encyclopedia of New York City'', p.342.</ref> In 1835, George Douglas bought 240 [[acre]]s of land along with Van Zandt's mansion. Upon Douglas' death in 1862, the land was inherited by his son, William Douglas. Four years later, the North Shore Railroad extended its service to the area. William Douglas donated an outbuilding for use as the station house, and in thanks, the railroad named its new stop "Douglaston", which soon was taken on as the name of the community.

Douglaston Hill is the oldest area of the community, and is characterized by turn-of-the-20th-century homes in [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] styles. It was laid out with very large lots in 1853, at the very beginning of a movement in the United States to create suburban gardens. The area was recognized as an Historic District of New York City in December 2004 by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]].<ref>See [http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/press/12_14_04.pdf Landmarks Preservation Commission Designates the Douglaston Hill Historic District in Queens], [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], [[2004-12-14]]</ref>

In the early 20th century, the Rickert-Finlay Realty Company of [[Manhattan]] purchased 175 acres of the Douglas' family holdings, and formed the Douglas Manor Association, creating a planned community. Many of the houses in this area were built in architectural styles popular at the time, such as [[Tudor Style architecture|Tudor]], [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture|Mediterranean]], [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]], and [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]]. In 1997, New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Douglas Manor as the Douglaston Historic District, ensuring that no new buildings or external alterations could be made without the commission's approval.{{fact|date=February 2007}}

Other areas of Douglaston were developed during the latter half of the 20th Century. Douglaston Park contains a mixture of large, older homes as well as [[Cape Cod (house)|Capes]], Tudors, and [[ranch house|ranch-style]] homes dating from the 1960s. The areas adjacent to the [[Douglaston, Queens#Local economy|Douglaston Shopping Center]] are comprised mainly of attached single-family homes built in the early-1970s, as well as four-story [[condominium]]s added in the mid-1980s.<ref>For a general overview, see "Timeless City Area, With a Country Feel," ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[2004-02-08]], p.11.</ref>

==Community activities==
Because northern Douglaston is surrounded by water many residents take advantage of the waterfront. The Douglaston Yacht Squadron<ref>http://www.douglaston.net/</ref> is the local yacht club. It is a part of the Douglaston Club, a country club based in Van Zandt's original mansion in [[Douglas Manor, Queens|Douglas Manor]]. The Douglaston Club is also site of various community events, such as the Douglaston [[Chess]] Congress' annual championships, which decides the community's best players.

Douglaston also boasts an 18-hole, par 67 [[golf course]]. Formerly known as the [[North Hills Country Club]], the 104-acre course opened in 1927 and became a municipal course in the 1960s. The [[Douglaston Park|Douglaston Golf Course]] underwent significant renovations in 2004. The course is situated at the highest point in the borough of Queens, providing picturesque views of the Manhattan skyline, and also boasts a restaurant.

This area also has several parks under the administration of the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]. To the west of Douglaston along the waterfront is [[Alley Pond Park]], a 635-acre wildlife and bird sanctuary, and home to the [[Queens Giant]], one of the oldest known trees in New York City. To the east along the water is Udalls Cove, a 90-acre wildlife sanctuary.

It contains a [[Waldbaum's]] supermarket, [[Toys 'R' Us]], [[Modell's]] sporting goods store, [[Starbucks]], [[Macy's]], [[Burger King]], and a MovieWorld theater. Until 2004, the Shopping Center was owned by [[Yale University]].
