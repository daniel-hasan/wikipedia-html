'''''Fight Club''''' is a 1999 [[United States|American]] [[film adaptation|feature film adaptation]] of the 1996 novel ''[[Fight Club]]'' by [[Chuck Palahniuk]], adapted by Jim Uhls and directed by [[David Fincher]].  The novel was [[option (film)|optioned]] by producer [[Laura Ziskin]], who hired Uhls to write the script for the film.  Several directors were sought to film ''Fight Club'', and David Fincher was hired to direct based on his interest in the project despite previous difficulties with the studio [[20th Century Fox]].  Major actors and actresses were considered by the studio to help promote the film, and actors [[Brad Pitt]], [[Edward Norton]], and [[Helena Bonham Carter]] were ultimately cast into the lead roles.  Fincher worked with Uhls to develop the script, seeking advice from others in the film industry and his own cast members.

Fincher described ''Fight Club'' as a black comedy that applies heavy satire; he and the cast also compared the film to ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967) and ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955).  Thematically, the film was intended to represent the conflict between a generation of young people and the [[value system]] of advertising.  The film's use of violence in the fight clubs was intended to serve as a metaphor for feeling based on the generation's conflict.   The nameless protagonist, portrayed by Edward Norton, is an [[everyman]] and an [[unreliable narrator]] who becomes involved in a fight club with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and is conflicted in a relationship triangle with Durden and Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter).  The director carried [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] overtones over from Palahniuk's novel to implement in the film, believing that the overtones would make audiences uncomfortable and not anticipate the [[twist ending]].

Studio executives were not receptive to the film, and they altered Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to recoup perceived losses.  ''Fight Club'' failed to meet expectations at the box office, and the film received polarized reactions from film critics.  The film was cited as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of 1999.  It was perceived as crossing a milestone for visual style in cinema and introducing a new mood in American political life.  The film later found commercial success with its DVD release, which  established ''Fight Club'' as a [[cult film]].  The film has also permeated American society, with people inspired by the film to set up their own fight clubs.

== Plot == 
The narrator ([[Edward Norton]]) is a nameless automobile company employee who travels to accident sites to perform [[product recall]] cost analyses. His doctor refuses to write a prescription for his [[insomnia]], instead recommending that he visit a [[support group]] for [[testicular cancer]] victims in order to appreciate real suffering. By attending the group, the narrator is able to sleep soundly and subsequently fakes more illnesses so he can attend other support groups. The narrator's routine is disrupted when he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]), at the groups he goes to and his insomnia returns.

During a flight for a business trip, the narrator meets Tyler Durden ([[Brad Pitt]]), who is a soap salesman. The narrator arrives home to find his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. He calls Tyler and meets him at a bar, where Tyler agrees to let the narrator stay at his home on the condition that the narrator hits him. The narrator complies and the two end up enjoying a fist fight outside the bar. The narrator moves in with Tyler and the two return to the bar, where they have another fight in the car park. After attracting a crowd, they establish a 'fight club' in the bar's basement. Soon, other fight clubs are established around the country.

When Marla overdoses on [[Xanax]], she is rescued by Tyler and the two embark upon a sexual relationship. Tyler tells the narrator never to discuss him with anyone. Under Tyler's leadership, the fight club becomes "Project Mayhem," which commits increasingly destructive acts of [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] vandalism in the city. The fight clubs become a network for Project Mayhem, and the narrator is left out of Tyler's activities with the project. After an argument, Tyler disappears from the narrator's life and when a member of Project Mayhem dies on a mission, the narrator attempts to shut down the project. Tracing Tyler's steps, he travels around the country to find that fight clubs have been started in every city, where one of the participants identifies him as Tyler Durden. A phone call to Marla confirms his identity and he realizes that Tyler is an alter ego of his own [[split personality]]. Tyler appears before him and explains that he controls the narrator's body whenever he is asleep.

The narrator faints and awakes to find Tyler has made several phone calls during his blackout and traces his plans to the [[central business district|downtown]] headquarters of several major [[credit card]] companies, which Tyler intends to destroy in order to cripple the financial networks. Failing to find help with the police, many of whom are members of Project Mayhem, the narrator attempts to disarm the explosives in the basement of one of the buildings. He is confronted by Tyler, knocked unconscious, and taken to the upper floor of another building to witness the impending destruction. The narrator, held by Tyler at gunpoint, realizes that in sharing the same body with Tyler, he is the one who is actually holding the gun.  He fires it into his mouth, shooting through the cheek without killing himself.  The illusion of Tyler collapses with an exit wound to the back of his head.  Shortly after, members of Project Mayhem bring a kidnapped Marla to the narrator and leave them alone. The bombs detonate and, holding hands, the two witness the destruction of the city block through the windows.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1996, a [[20th Century Fox]] book scout sent a [[galley proof]] of [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s novel ''[[Fight Club]]'' to creative executive [[Kevin McCormick]].  Despite a studio reader discouraging a film adaptation of the material, McCormick passed the proof on to producers [[Lawrence Bender]] and [[Art Linson]], who in turn also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell then expressed interest in the project and arranged unpaid screen readings with actors, initially lasting six hours, to determine the length of a script.  After cutting out sections to reduce the running time and recording the dialogue, Bell sent the book on tape to [[Laura Ziskin]], head of the division [[Fox 2000]], who after listening to the tape purchased the rights to ''Fight Club'' for $10,000.<ref name="mav1">{{cite book | author=Sharon Waxman | title=Rebels on the Backlot: Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System | pages=137-151 | year=2005 | month=December | publisher=HarperEntertainment | isbn=0060540176 }}</ref>

To adapt the story into a screenplay, Ziskin initially considered hiring [[Buck Henry]]; Ziskin thought that ''Fight Club'' was similar to ''[[The Graduate]]'', which had been adapted by Henry.  However, a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, began lobbying Donen and Bell to be hired to adapt the screenplay and was subsequently chosen by the producers over Henry.  For directing, Bell had four options in mind: [[Peter Jackson]], [[Bryan Singer]], [[Danny Boyle]], and [[David Fincher]].  Bell considered Jackson the best choice and contacted the director, but Jackson was too busy filming ''[[The Frighteners]]'' (1996) in New Zealand.  Singer received the book, but did not read it, while Boyle met with Bell and read the book, but ultimately pursued another project.  Fincher, who had previously read the book and tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film, but was hesitant to work with 20th Century Fox again after his bad experiences with the studio during ''[[AlienÂ³]]'' (1992).  A meeting with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic restored his relationship with the studio,<ref name="mav1" /> and in August 1997, [[Twentieth Century Fox]] announced that Fincher would helm the [[film adaptation]] of the novel.<ref>{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116678264.html?categoryid=3&cs=1 | title=Thornton holds reins of 'Horses' | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[1997-08-19]] | accessdate=2007-03-23 }}</ref>  Mechanic and Ziskin initially planned to finance the film with a $23 million budget.<ref name="mav1" />

===Casting===
Producer Ross Bell met with actor [[Russell Crowe]] to discuss portraying Tyler Durden, while at the same time producer Art Linson, who had lately joined the project, was negotiating with [[Brad Pitt]] for the same role.  Due to Linson's seniority, Pitt was cast over Crowe.<ref name="mav1" />  Pitt, who was seeking a new project after the failure of his previous film, ''[[Meet Joe Black]]'' (1998), was hired for $17.5 million, the studio believing that ''Fight Club'' would be more commercially successful with a major star.<ref name="mav2" />  Likewise for the role of the nameless narrator, the studio desired a "sexier marquee name" like [[Matt Damon]] to increase the film's visibility ([[Sean Penn]] was also considered), but Fincher sought to cast [[Edward Norton]] in that role, based on the actor's performance in ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996).<ref name="vanity">{{cite news | author=Peter Biskind | url= | title=Extreme Norton | publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date=Aug. 1999 }}</ref> Norton had also been approached by other studios for leading roles in films like ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' (1999) and ''[[Man on the Moon]]'' (1999), and he temporarily pursued ''[[Runaway Jury]]'' (2003) before that project fell apart. To lure him away from the other projects, Fox offered Norton a salary of $2.5 million, but Norton could not immediately accept, as he still  owed [[Paramount Pictures]] a film.  Norton therefore signed a new contract with Paramount for a lesser salary, eventually and unwillingly being cast in ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]'' (2003).<ref name="mav2" />  In January 1998, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton officially joined the project to portray Tyler Durden and the nameless narrator, respectively.<ref>{{cite news | author=Chris Petrikin | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117434297.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Studio Report Card: Fox | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[1998-01-07]] | accessdate=2007-03-23 }}</ref>

Actresses [[Courtney Love]] and [[Winona Ryder]] were considered to portray Marla Singer,<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.cnn.com/books/news/9910/29/fight.club.author/ | title=Palahniuk: Marketing 'Fight Club' is 'the ultimate absurd joke' | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=[[1999-10-29]] | accessdate=2007-03-26 }}</ref>  and the studio would have cast [[Reese Witherspoon]] were it not for Fincher's objections that the actress was too young.<ref name="mav2" />  Ultimately, [[Helena Bonham Carter]] was cast in the role, based on her performance in ''[[The Wings of the Dove (film)|The Wings of the Dove]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite news | author=Richard Johnson | url= | title=Boxing Helena | publisher=Los Angeles Magazine | date=November 1999 }}</ref>

To prepare for their roles, Norton and Pitt took lessons in [[boxing]], [[taekwondo]], and [[grappling]], <ref name="details">{{cite news | author=Stephen Garrett | url= | title=Freeze Frame | publisher=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] | date=Jul. 1999 }}</ref>  in addition to [[soapmaking]] classes from boutique company owner Auntie Godmother.<ref>{{cite news | author=Johanna Schneller | url= | title=Brad Pitt and Edward Norton make 'Fight Club' | publisher=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] | date=Aug. 1999 }}</ref>  For the cosmetics of his role, Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off, which were restored after filming concluded.<ref>{{cite news | author=Chris Nashawaty | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,83604,00.html | title=Brad Pitt loses his teeth for a "Fight" | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=[[1998-07-16]] | accessdate=2007-03-23 }}</ref>

===Writing===
Screenwriter Jim Uhls began working on the adaptation from an earlier draft which lacked a [[voice-over]] due to the industry's perspective at the time that the technique was "hackneyed and trite".  When Fincher joined the project, he disagreed with the approach, believing that the film's humor came from the narrator's voice,<ref name="mav2">''Rebels on the Backlot'', 175â184.</ref>  and described the film without voice-over as seemingly "sad and pathetic".<ref name="comment">{{cite news | author=Gavin Smith | url= | title=Gavin Smith goes one-on-one with David Fincher | publisher=[[Film Comment]] | date=Sept/Oct 1999 }}</ref>  The director and Uhls developed the script for six to seven months, creating a third draft by 1997 that reordered the story and left out several major elements.  When Pitt came on board, the actor expressed concern that Tyler Durden was too one-dimensional, so Fincher sought the advice of writer-director [[Cameron Crowe]], who suggested giving the character more ambiguity.  Fincher also hired screenwriter [[Andrew Kevin Walker]] and invited Pitt and Norton to collaborate on rewriting the script, which was completed after a year of work and five drafts.<ref name="mav2" />  The narrator was written to be nameless in the film, although he is identified in the script as Jack.  The narrator's aliases in the support groups that he attends were based on characters from ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' and [[Robert De Niro]] roles of the '70s.<ref>{{cite news | title = 100 DVDs You Must Own | pages = 31 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = January 2003 }}</ref>
[[Image:Fight Club bathtub.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The bathtub scene served as part of the director's intended homoerotic presentation to make audiences uncomfortable and unprepared for the film's coming events.]]
Author [[Chuck Palahniuk]] praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel ''Fight Club'' and applauded the fact that the plot of the film was more streamlined than that of the book.  Palahniuk also noted the contention over the believability for film audiences of the novel's plot twist, the inclusion of which Director David Fincher supported by saying, "If they accept everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist. If they're still in the theater, they'll stay with it."  Palahniuk was, however, annoyed by the film's change of a single ingredient in its explanation on making [[napalm]], which rendered the recipe useless, since the author had researched the components extensively.<ref name="dvdtalk">{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/fightclub.html | title=Interview With Fight Club Author Chuck Palahniuk | publisher=DVD Talk | accessdate=2007-03-23 }}</ref>  Palahniuk's novel also contained [[homoerotic]] overtones, which the director purposely included in the film in order to make audiences uncomfortable and thereby accentuate the surprise of the film's twists and turns.<ref>{{cite news | author=Louis B. Hobson | url= | title=Fiction for real | publisher=[[Calgary Sun]] | date=[[1999-10-10]] }}</ref>  The scene in which Tyler Durden bathes next to the narrator is an example of such overtones, although Durden's insight in the scene, "I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need," was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality.<ref name="DVDcom" />  Another example of the overtones was the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the narrator's mouth.<ref>{{cite news | author=Stephen Schaefer | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010416022913/mrshowbiz.go.com/news/Todays_Stories/991013/fightclubauthor101399.html | title=Fight Club's Controversial Cut | publisher=MrShowbiz.com | date=[[1999-10-13]] | accessdate=2007-12-02 }}</ref>

===Filming===
[[Image:Fight Club interior deconstruction.jpg|thumb|250px|The interior of Tyler Durden's Paper Street home was designed to possess a sense of decay to reflect the deconstructed world of the characters.]]
When production first began, the initial $50 million budget, of which half was paid by [[New Regency]], escalated to a peak of $67 million.  New Regency's head and ''Fight Club'' executive producer [[Arnon Milchan]] petitioned Fincher to reduce the budget by at least $5 million, but the director refused to cut costs, so Milchan contacted studio head Bill Mechanic, saying that he would back out.  To bring back Milchan's support, Mechanic sent him tapes of [[dailies]], and after three weeks of shooting, Milchan returned his support and financed half of the production budget.<ref name="mav3">''Rebels on the Backlot''.  199â202.</ref>

Filming lasted 138 days,<ref name="anarchy">{{cite news | author=Christopher Probst | url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/nov99/anarchy/index.htm | title=Anarchy in the U.S.A. | publisher=[[American Cinematographer]] | date=November 1999 | accessdate=2007-03-23 }}</ref> during which Fincher shot over 1,500 rolls of film, three times the average for a Hollywood film.<ref name="details" />  Filming locations were in and around [[Los Angeles]] and on sets built at the studio's location in [[Century City]].<ref name="anarchy" />  Production designer Alex McDowell constructed over 70 sets.<ref name="details" />  The exterior of Tyler Durden's home on Paper Street was built in [[San Pedro, California]], while the interiors, given a decayed look to reflect the deconstructed world of the characters, were built on a sound stage at the studio's location.<ref name="anarchy" />  Marla's apartment was based on photographs of the Rosalind Apartments in downtown L.A.<ref name="comment" />

Fighting in the film was heavily choreographed, and fighters were required to "go full out" during fight scenes to capture realistic effects such as having the wind knocked out of oneself.<ref name=tribune>{{cite news | author= | url= | title='Club' fighting for a respectful place in life | publisher=[[Post-Tribune]] | date=[[2001-03-15]] }}</ref>  To enhance the scenes, makeup artist Julie Pearce, who collaborated with the director on ''[[The Game (film)|The Game]]'', studied [[mixed martial arts]] and [[pay-per-view]] boxing for her work on the fighters. She also designed an extra to have a chunk missing from his ear, for which she cited [[The Bite Fight|Mike Tyson's bite]] as inspiration.<ref>{{cite news | url= | title=It Bruiser: Julie Pearce | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=[[1999-07-25]] }}</ref>  To create sweat on cue, makeup artists devised two methods: spraying water over a coat of [[Vaseline]], and using straight water for "wet sweat".  [[Meat Loaf]], who plays a member of the fight club that has "[[gynecomastia|bitch tits]]", wore a 90-pound fat harness that gave him large breasts for the role.<ref name="details" />  He also wore eight-inch [[elevator shoe|lifts]] in his scenes with Norton, being shorter than the lead actor.<ref name="DVDcom">''Fight Club'' DVD commentary featuring [[David Fincher]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Edward Norton]] and [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [2000].</ref>

Overall production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and [[#Visual effects|complex special effects]].  Fincher compared ''Fight Club'' to his succeeding and less complex project ''[[Panic Room (film)|Panic Room]]'' (2001), "I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on."<ref>{{cite news | author=Colin Covert | url= | title=Fear factor is Fincher's forte | publisher=[[Star Tribune]] | date=[[2002-03-29]] }}</ref>

===Cinematography===
''Fight Club'' was shot in the [[Super 35]] format to give the director maximum flexibility in composing shots. To direct the cinematography for the film, director [[David Fincher]] hired Jeff Cronenweth, the son of the late cinematographer [[Jordan Cronenweth]] with whom Fincher had collaborated for ''[[AlienÂ³]]'' (1992).  Fincher and Cronenweth drew from elements of the visual styles that Fincher had begun exploring in ''[[Se7en]]'' and ''The Game''.  For the narrator's scenes without Tyler Durden, the look was purposely bland and realistic, while for scenes with Tyler, Fincher chose a look that was "more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense - a visual metaphor of what [the narrator's] heading into".  Heavily desaturated colors were used in the costuming, makeup, and art direction, and the crew took advantage of as much natural and practical light at filming locations as possible.  The director also took various approaches to take advantage of lighting situations in the film's scenes, and several practical locations were chosen for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds.  Fluorescent lighting at practical locations was also embraced to maintain an element of reality and to light the prosthetics of the characters' injuries appropriately.<ref name="anarchy" />  On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were darkened enough to reduce the visibility of the characters' eyes, citing cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]]'s technique as the influence.<ref name="DVDcom" />

The majority of ''Fight Club'' was filmed at night, with daytime shots taking place in purposely shadowed locations.  For the first scenes of the actual indoor fight club in Lou's basement, the area was lit by inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow.  The director also chose to film fight scenes in the basement from a more objective view, purposely avoiding stylish camerawork and instead placing the camera in a fixed position.  As the fight scenes in the film progressed, the camera moved from the point of view of a distant observer to that of the fighter.<ref name="anarchy" />

Scenes of Tyler Durden were staged to conceal the film's twist; the character was not filmed in [[two shot]]s with a group of people, nor was he included in any [[over the shoulder shot]]s.  Durden is also present in single frames of the narrator's scenes before the narrator actually meets Durden,<ref name="comment" /> appearing in the background and out of focus, like a "little devil on the shoulder".<ref name="DVDcom" /> Regarding these subliminal frames, Fincher explained, "Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the narrator's consciousness."<ref name="cinefex" />

===Visual effects===
[[Image:Fight Club fear center.jpg|thumb|250px|The opening scene in ''Fight Club'' that represents a brain's [[neural network]] in which the thought processes are initiated by the narrator's fear impulse.  The network was mapped using an [[L-system]] and drawn out by a medical illustrator.]]
As [[visual effects]] supervisor, Tod Haug, who had collaborated with director David Fincher on ''The Game'', divided the VFX artists and experts into different facilities, each responsible for addressing a separate aspect of the film's visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. According to Haug, "We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness." Fincher chose to illustrate the nameless narrator's perspective with a "[[mind's eye]]" view and to create a [[myopic]] framework for the film's audience. Fincher also utilized [[previsualization|previsualized]] footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.<ref name="cinefex">{{cite news | author=Kevin H. Martin | url= | title=A World of Hurt | publisher=[[Cinefex]] | date=Jan. 2000 }}</ref>

The film's title sequence is a ninety-second pullback scene from the fear center of the narrator's brain, representing the thought processes initiated by the narrator's fear impulse.<ref name="comment" /> The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was budgeted separately from the rest of the film, but the studio later paid for the sequence based on Fincher's expert direction of the film.<ref name="DVDcom" /> For the visual effects of the sequence, Fincher hired [[Digital Domain]] and its visual effects supervisor Kevin Mack, who had won an [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]] for ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'' (1998). The computer-generated brain was mapped using an [[L-system]],<ref>{{cite news | author=Mark Frauenfelder | url= | title=Hollywood's Head Case | publisher=[[Wired magazine|Wired]] | date=Aug. 1999 }}</ref> and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Kathryn Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included [[neuron]]s, [[action potential]]s, and a [[hair follicle]]. Concerning the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, Haug explained, "While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like [[electron microscopy|electron microscope photography]], that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive - wet, scary, and with a low depth of field." The shallow [[depth of field]] was accomplished with the process of [[ray tracing]].<ref name="cinefex" />

One of the earliest scenes in the film, in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots, was a three-dimensional composition of nearly one hundred photographs of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Century City]] by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of demolishing the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant, who worked on the scene for over fourteen months.<ref name="cinefex" />
[[Image:Fight Club cigarette burn.jpg|thumb|250px|The sequence in which Tyler Durden (Pitt) points out a [[cue mark#So-called "cigarette burns"|cue mark]] is a thematic element implemented by the director to reflect the point after which reality would become subverted.]]
The director gave a lurid style to the [[color palette]] of the film, choosing to make people "sort of shiny"; Helena Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to create a "smack-fiend [[patina]]" that would portray her romantic nihilistic character best. The director and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth were also influenced by ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973), which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.  When ''Fight Club'' was processed, several techniques were applied to alter the footage. The [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be [[exposure (photography)|underexposed]], resilvering (lower-scale enhancement) was used to increase [[optical density|density]], and high-contrast print socks were stepped all over the print to create a dirty patina.<ref name="comment" />

Fincher included the [[cue mark#So-called "cigarette burns"|cue mark]] sequence, in which Durden points out the "cigarette burn" flash, to serve as a thematic element. The sequence represents a turning point, foreshadowing the coming rupture and inversion of the "fairly subjective reality" that characterizes the initial progression of the film. "Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way," explained Fincher.<ref name="cinefex" />

===Musical score===
For the [[film score|musical score]], the director was concerned that bands experienced in performing film music would be unable to tie the movie's themes together, so for this reason, he sought a band which had never recorded for film before.  [[Radiohead]] was pursued as a possible choice,<ref name="DVDcom" /> but the [[alternative rock]] producer duo [[Dust Brothers]] was ultimately chosen to score the film.  The duo created a post-modern score that included drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples because, as Dust Brothers performer [[Michael Simpson (producer)|Michael Simpson]] explains, "Fincher wanted to break new ground with everything about the movie, and a nontraditional score helped achieve that."<ref>{{cite news | author=Amanda Schurr | url= | title=Score one for musicians turned film composers | publisher=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] | date=[[1999-11-19]] }}</ref>

===Characters===
In ''Fight Club'', the nameless narrator is an [[everyman]] who lacks a world of possibilities and initially cannot find a way to change his life.  The narrator finds himself unable to match society's requirements for happiness and so embarks on a path to enlightenment which involves metaphorically killing his parents, his God, and his teacher.  At the beginning of the film, the narrator has killed off his parents but still finds himself trapped in his false world.  The narrator then meets Tyler Durden, with whom he kills his metaphorical God by going against the norms of society.  Ultimately, the narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden, to complete the process of maturity.<ref name="comment" />

Screenwriter Jim Uhls described the film as a "romantic comedy", explaining, "It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which ''seems'' unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them&mdash;because both characters are out on the edge psychologically."<ref>{{cite news | author=Michael Sragow | url=http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/10/14/fincher/index1.html | title=Testosterama | publisher=[[Salon.com]] | date=[[1999-10-14]] | accessdate=2007-12-02 }}</ref>  In the film, the narrator seeks intimacy, but he avoids it at first with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her.<ref name="DVDcom" />  Though Marla presents a seductive and negativist prospect for the narrator, he instead embraces the novelty and excitement that Tyler Durden has to offer him.  The narrator finds himself comfortable having the personal connection to Tyler Durden, but he becomes jealous when Marla becomes sexually involved with Tyler.  When the narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler explains that the relationship between the two men is secondary to the active pursuit of the philosophy they had been exploring.<ref name="reel" />  Tyler also suggests doing something about Marla, implying that she is a risk to be removed.  When Tyler says this, the narrator realizes that his desires should have been focused on Marla and begins to diverge from Tyler's path.<ref name="DVDcom" />

===Marketing===
[[Image:Fight Club bar of soap.jpg|thumb|A pink bar of soap was conceived by the advertising firm [[Wieden+Kennedy]] as the main marketing image, but studio executives considered the concept "a bad joke".]]
In early 1999, after filming had concluded the previous December, David Fincher edited the footage to prepare ''Fight Club'' for a preliminary screening with senior executives.  They did not receive the film positively, expressing concern that there would not be an audience that would watch it, and in a second screening two months later, second-tier executives also responded negatively to the film.<ref name="mav4">''Rebels on the Backlot''.  253â273.</ref>  Nevertheless, ''Fight Club'' was originally slated to be released in July 1999,<ref name="blood">{{cite news | author=Benjamnin Svetkey | url= | title=Blood, Sweat, and Fears | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=[[1999-10-15]] }}</ref> later changed to [[August 6]], [[1999]].  The studio further delayed the film's release, this time to autumn, due to a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production process,<ref>{{cite news | author=Leonard Klady | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117503196.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Fox holds the 'Fight' to fall | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[1999-06-17]] | accessdate=2007-03-23 }}</ref> although outsiders attributed the delays to the [[Columbine High School massacre]] earlier in the year.<ref>{{cite news | author=Christopher Goodwin | url= | title=The malaise of the American male | publisher=[[The Sunday Times]] | date=[[1999-09-19]] }}</ref>

Marketing executives at Twentieth Century Fox faced difficulties in marketing ''Fight Club'' and at one point considered marketing it as an [[art film]].  Because of the film's violence, they considered it primarily geared toward male audiences and believed that not even the presence of Brad Pitt would attract female filmgoers.  Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers.  Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Brad Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm [[Wieden+Kennedy]] to devise a marketing plan.  The firm came up with a bar of pink soap as the film's main marketing image, which was considered "a bad joke" by Fox executives.  Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of faux public service announcements presented by Pitt and Norton which the studio considered as inappropriate introductions to the movie.  Instead, the studio financed a $20 million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes.  ''Fight Club'' was also advertised on cable during [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film.<ref name="mav4" />

For the [[United Kingdom|UK]] release of ''Fight Club'' on [[November 12]], [[1999]], the [[British Board of Film Classification]] removed two scenes involving "an indulgence in the excitement of beating a (defenseless) man's face into a pulp" and  awarded the film an 18 certificate, limiting the release to adult-only audiences in the UK.  The BBFC did not censor any further, having considered and dismissed claims that ''Fight Club'' contained "dangerously instructive information" and could "encourage anti-social [behavior]".  As the board noted, "The film as a whole is&mdash;quite clearly&mdash;critical and sharply parodic of the amateur fascism which in part it portrays.  Its central theme of male machismo (and the anti-social behaviour that flows from it) is emphatically rejected by the central character in the concluding reels."<ref>{{cite news | author=Adam Dawtrey | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117757863.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=UK to cut 'Club' | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[1999-11-09]] | accessdate=2007-03-23 }}</ref>

She also noted that ''Fight Club'' carried a message of "contemporary manhood", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism.<ref>{{cite news | author=Janet Maslin | authorlink=Janet Maslin | url= | title=FILM REVIEW; Such a Very Long Way From Duvets to Danger | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=[[1999-10-15]] }}</ref>  [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called ''Fight Club'' "visceral and hard-edged", as well as "a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy" that most audiences would not appreciate.<ref>{{cite news | author=Rogert Ebert | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991015/REVIEWS/910150302/1023 | title= Fight Club | publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=[[1999-10-15]] | accessdate=2007-03-23 }}</ref>  Jay Carr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' thought that the film began with an "invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz", but that it eventually became "explosively silly".<ref>{{cite news | author=Jay Carr | url= | title='Fight Club' packs a punch but lacks stamina | publisher=[[Boston Globe]] | date=[[1999-10-15]] }}</ref>  David Ansen of ''[[Newsweek]]'' described ''Fight Club'' as "an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload" and thought that the ending was too pretentious.<ref>{{cite news | author=David Ansen | url= | title=A Fistful of Darkness | publisher=[[Newsweek]] | date=[[1999-10-18]] }}</ref>

Richard Schickel of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the director's [[mise en scÃ¨ne]] as dark and damp, noting, "It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's better to be wet than dry."  Schickel applauded the performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, but he criticized the film's "conventionally gimmicky" unfolding and the failure to make Helena Bonham Carter's character interesting.<ref name=time>{{cite news | author=Richard Schickel | url= | title=Conditional Knockout | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=[[1999-10-11]] }}</ref>

David Edelstein of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' thought that ''Fight Club'' was "sensationalism that mistakes itself for satire" and criticized the film's sporadic exploration of satiric ideas.  Edelstein did not consider the message of ''Fight Club'' to be revolutionary, believing that it had already been presented in [[punk culture]].  Edelstein considered Edward Norton's performance "marvelous" and thought that Brad Pitt played well into the embodiment of conceit, but the critic believed that the film failed to utilize any female or African-American perspectives.<ref>{{cite news | author=David Edelstein | url= | title=Boys Do Bleed | publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=[[1999-10-16]] }}</ref>

Jeff Vice of the ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'' described the film as an [[Ernest Hemingway]] novel reinterpreted by [[Ken Kesey]] and thought that ''Fight Club'' was buoyed by the cast, particularly [[Edward Norton]], who "turns in a terrific performance that veers from intense to horrifying to likably comical and back again".  Vice described the first two-thirds of the film to be "exhilarating, if disturbing", though he believed that the final third petered out.<ref>{{cite news | author=Jeff Vice | url= | title=Fight Club | publisher=[[Deseret Morning News]] | date=[[2001-09-24]] }}</ref>

Feminist author [[Susan Faludi]], who wrote ''[[Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man]]'', described ''Fight Club'' as an "incisive gender drama", comparing its message to the 1991 film ''[[Thelma & Louise]]''.  Faludi also considered ''Fight Club'' a "savagely violent reprise" of the film ''[[American Beauty (film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999) but commented that Fincher's film "delves deeper for a response".  The author believed that ''Fight Club'' critiqued the "necessarily intramural" revolution and that the film ultimately renounced violence and adolescent fraternity.  Faludi said, "For all its chaotic darkness, ''Fight Club'' ends up as a quasi-feminist tale, seen through masculine eyes."<ref>{{cite news | author=Susan Faludi | url= | title=It's 'Thelma and Louise' for Guys | publisher=[[Newsweek]] | date=[[1999-10-25]] }}</ref><!-- Dr. [[Henry Giroux]] described the pathology of ''Fight Club'' as an intensely misogynistic representation of women, and an advancement of the theory that the intense expression of violence is the only means by which men can be cleansed of feminism.<ref>{{cite paper |author=Henry Giroux |title=Private Satisfactions and Public Disorders: Fight Club, Patriarchy, and the Politics of Masculine Violence |publisher=[[Penn State University]] |date=[[2000-07-03]] |url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/ed253a/FightClub |accessdate=2007-04-02 }}</ref>-->

A "Gentleman's Fight Club" was started in [[Menlo Park, California]] in 2000 and has members mostly from the [[high tech]] industry.<ref>{{cite news | author=Associated Press | url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-05-29-fight-club_x.htm | title=Fight club draws techies for bloody underground beatdowns | publisher=[[USA Today]] | date=[[2006-05-29]] | accessdate=2007-04-28 }}</ref>  Teens and preteens in [[Texas]], [[New Jersey]], [[Washington]] state, and [[Alaska]] also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs.  In 2006, a fight club in [[Arlington, Texas]] injured an unwilling participant from a local high school, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers.<ref>{{cite news | author=Bruce Rosenstein | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-07-31-violent-fight-clubs_x.htm | title=Illegal, violent teen fight clubs face police crackdown | publisher=[[USA Today]] | date=[[2006-08-01]] | accessdate=2007-04-28 }}</ref>  An unsanctioned fight club was even started at [[Princeton University]], and matches were held on campus.<ref>{{cite news | author= | url= | title=At Princeton, no punches pulled | publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date=[[2001-06-06]] }}</ref>  The film has also been suspected of influencing [[Luke Helder]], a college student who planted [[pipe bomb]]s in mailboxes in 2002.  Helder's goal was to create a [[smiley]] pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in ''Fight Club'' in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior.<ref>{{cite news | author=C.

According to actor [[Edward Norton]], his old professor from [[Yale University]] has reported being inundated with [[thesis|dissertation]]s about ''Fight Club''.<ref name=see/>  The film has also been used as an academic tool at [[Northern Arizona University]] to introduce students to rhetorical analysis and argumentation.<ref>{{cite news | author=Julia Duin | url= | title=Pop degrees | publisher=[[The Washington Times]] | date=[[2002-05-09]] }}</ref> In addition, the film has been parodied in a [[re-cut trailer]] that converted the storyline into a "quirky love story" between Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter's characters.  The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' noted that this parody trailer was "dominated by a distinctly nonprofessional voiceover".<ref>{{cite news | author=John Jurgensen | url= | title=Downloads: Web Humor; Parody movie trailers serve as calling cards for Net design firms and comedy groups | publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] | date=[[2006-02-11]] }}</ref>
