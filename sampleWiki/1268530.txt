'''''Even in the Quietest Moments...''''' is the fifth [[album]] by [[progressive rock]] band [[Supertramp]], released in April of 1977 (see [[1977 in music]]).

The album was recorded mainly at Caribou Studios in Colorado with overdubs, vocals and mixing completed at The Record Plant in Los Angeles and was Supertramp's first album to use engineer Peter Henderson whom would work with the band for the rest of Roger Hodgson's tenure with the band.

Even in the Quietest Moments reached #16 on the Billboard Pop Albums Charts in 1977 and within a few months of release became Supertramp's first Gold (500,000 copies or more) selling album in the US thanks to "Give a Little Bit" being a US Top 20 single.

A remastered CD version of the album with full original artwork, lyrics and credits restored (including the inner sleeve picture of the band absent from the original CD) was released on June 11, 2002 on A&M Records in the US. The cover photo is not doctored - a grand piano was placed on a mountain top at Caribou Studios, covered with snow and photographed.

While "Give a Little Bit" was the big hit, both "Fool's Overture" and "Even in the Quietest Moments" got a fair amount of FM album-rock play.
