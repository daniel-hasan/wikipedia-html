The [[bird]] [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Petroicidae''' includes roughly 45 species in about 15 genera. All are endemic to [[Australasia]] or nearby areas. For want of a more accurate common name, the family is often described as the '''Australasian robins''': it extends beyond Australasia, however, and includes not just robins but the [[Jacky Winter]], the [[New Zealand Tomtit]], some flycatchers, and scrub-robins.

Most species have a stocky build with a large, rounded head, a short, straight bill, and rounded wingtips. They occupy a wide range of wooded habitats, from subalpine to tropical rainforest, and mangrove swamps to semi-arid scrubland. All are primarily insectivorous, although a few supplement their diet with seeds. Hunting is mostly by perch and pounce, a favoured tactic being to cling sideways onto a treetrunk and scan the ground below without moving.

Social organisation is usually centered on long term pair-bonds and small family groups. Some genera practice [[cooperative breeding]], with all family members helping defend a territory and feed nestlings. 

Nests are cup-shaped, usually constructed by the female, and often placed in a vertical fork of a tree or shrub; many species are expert at adding moss, bark or lichen to the outside of the nest as camouflague, making it very difficult to spot (even when it is in a seemingly prominent location).

The relationship of the Petroicidae to other bird families is uncertain. They are clearly part of a particularly old lineage. [[Charles Sibley|Sibley and Alquist]]'s [[DNA-DNA hybridisation]] studies put them in the "[[Corvoidea]]" (a huge group that includes the [[shrike]]s, [[crow]]s and [[jay]]s, [[butcherbird]]s, [[woodswallow]]s, [[drongo]]s, [[cuckoo-shrike]], [[fantail]]s, [[monarch flycatcher]]s and many others), but this superfamily has been proven to be [[paraphyletic]].

More recent [[allozyme]] studies{{Fact|date=January 2007}} suggest that they be placed with the [[Meliphagoidea]] - the [[superfamily]] that includes the [[honeyeater]]s, [[Australian wrens]], [[Pardalote]]s, and [[thornbill]]s and itself derives from the great Australasian corvid radiation. 

Although the details remain uncertain, the overall picture is clear: despite the striking similarity between the robins of Australasia and the [[European Robin|true robins]] of Europe, their evolutionary relationship is quite distant, and the Petroicidae are more closely related to the [[crow]]s and [[jay]]s than to the group of northern hemisphere birds which resemble them in appearance, diet, habits, and even coloration.
