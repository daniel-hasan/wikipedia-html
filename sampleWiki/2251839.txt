The '''Upper Magdalena Tapaculo''' (''Scytalopus rodriguezi'') is a member of the [[tapaculo]]s, a group of [[Neotropical]] [[bird]]s. It was described as [[Bird species new to science|new to science]] in 2005. 

It is a [[restricted-range endemic]] presently known only from two localities on the eastern slope of the [[Cordillera Central, Colombia|Cordillera Central]] at the head of the [[Magdalena Valley]], [[Colombia]] at 2000m or more above sea-level. Its range is believed to be no greater than 170km², and its population around 2,200 pairs; due to its recent description, no formal evaluation of its conservation status has taken place yet, however. It is found in humid [[forest]]s with dense [[understorey]]. 

The species scientific name honours [[José Vicente Rodriguez Mahecha]], a Colombian conservationist. 

The existence of this species was first suspected in 1986, when a tape-recording of the bird's song was made, but political instability in the region prevented a return visit until 2002-2003, when the species' existence was confirmed.
