Numerous '''[[Georgia Tech]] legends and traditions''' have been established since the school's opening in 1888,<ref name="Hopkins">{{cite web | title = The Hopkins Administration, 1888-1895 | work = "A Thousand Wheels are set in Motion": The Building of Georgia Tech at the Turn of the 20th Century, 1888-1908 | publisher = Georgia Institute of Technology | url = http://www.library.gatech.edu/gtbuildings/hopkins.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref><!-- this ref is about the school's opening, not strictly about traditions--> some of which have persisted for decades. Over time, the school has grown from a [[trade school]] into a large [[research university]], and the traditions reflect that heritage. One of the cherished holdovers from Tech's early years, a [[steam whistle]] blows five minutes before the hour, every hour from 7:55 a.m. to 5:55 p.m. It is for that reason that the faculty newspaper is named ''The Whistle''.

Some of the traditions are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower. [[Tech Tower]], Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters TECH hanging atop it on each of its four sides. A number of times, students have orchestrated complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion have carried this act out successfully. One especially well-known tradition that has existed nearly since the school's establishment is [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate]], Georgia Tech's heated, long and ongoing rivalry with the [[University of Georgia]]. The first known hostilities between the two schools trace back to [[1891]].

Several legends originated at Georgia Tech. [[George P. Burdell]], Tech's ever-present fictional student, was created in 1927 when a student filled out two application forms. Burdell went on to lead a long life; he earned several degrees, fought World War II, and almost won ''Time''{{'}}s 2001 [[Person of the Year]] award. Georgia Tech is also known for the largest margin of victory in a football game, achieved in their 222-0 thrashing of [[Cumberland University]] in the [[1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game]].

===Stealing the T===
{{main|Stealing the 'T'}}
[[Image:TechTowerSign.jpg|thumb|right|A closeup of [[Tech Tower]]]]
Tech's historic and primary administrative building, [[Tech Tower]], has the letters TECH hanging atop it on each of its four sides. Since 1969, students  on several occasions have orchestrated complex plans to scale Tech Tower and steal the huge symbolic letter T off the building. The 'T' was first stolen in April of [[1969]] by a secret group of Georgia Tech students calling themselves the "Magnificent Seven."<ref name="Dismantling">{{ cite news | title = Dismantling a tradition | work = Tech Topics | publisher = Georgia Tech Alumni Association | date = Winter 1999 | accessdate = 2007-02-02 | url = http://gtalumni.org/StayInformed/techtopics/win99/hill.html#stealing | last = Coffee | first = Hoyt }}</ref> The students, who were inspired by a similar prank that had taken place in [[1968]] at [[Harvard University]], planned the theft as a means of commemorating Institute President [[Edwin D.

Following successful thefts, the T would then returned at the halftime of the homecoming football game or would be returned to the lawn of the President's mansion, and the student's achievement would be celebrated. Tradition dictates that the first T to be stolen should be the one facing east, as this can most easily be seen from the I-75/I-85 [[Downtown Connector]].<ref>{{cite web

The term ''Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech'' refers to either current students or alumni, the school mascot, or the various sports teams.  Georgia Tech alumni, working on the construction of the [[Panama Canal]], were called Ramblin' Wrecks for the ingenuitive machines that they devised to transport themselves in and out of the jungles of [[Panama]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Edwards|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2000-08-25/online%20exclusives/7|title=It’s the most beautiful old car in the world...|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2000-08-25|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref>  These devices and their creators were nicknamed Ramblin' Wrecks from Georgia Tech.  Since then the term Ramblin' Wreck has been applied to a graduate or current student of Georgia Tech.

===To Hell With Georgia===
{{seealso|Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate}}
Georgia Tech has an ongoing rivalry, mostly in sports, with the [[University of Georgia]], often simply called ''"Georgia"'' for short. The rivalry is often called [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate]]. An annual issue of the Institute newspaper, ''[[The Technique]]'', focuses on this rivalry with an issue that spoofs ''[[The Red and Black]]'', the newspaper of the University of Georgia.<ref name="thwga">{{cite news|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2000-12-01/campus%20life/4|title=Nique staff does Athens in lavish style|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[2000-12-01]]|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref> As a dig at the rival school, the ''Technique'' will typically refer to it as "the University ([[sic]]) of Georgia" (sometimes shortened to "U(sic)GA") in articles.<ref name="thwga"/> "To Hell With Georgia" (abbreviated "THWG" or "THWUGA") is also known as "The good word."

===RAT Caps===
[[Image:GeorgiaTechRatCapDiagram.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Georgia Tech Rat Cap inscription diagram.]]
Every year, a number of freshmen, most notably those in the [[marching band]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtraditions/traditions/ratcap.html|title=RAT Caps|work=Ramblin' Memories|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref> wear gold caps known as RAT caps at each football game. RAT is short for ''Recruit At Tech'', although freshmen are sometimes addressed as RATS, or "Recently Acquired Tech Students."<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> The RAT caps are decorated with the football team's scores, the freshman's name, hometown, major, expected graduation date, and "To Hell With Georgia" emblazoned on the back of the cap.

The tradition began in 1915,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|title=Traditions|work=RamblinWreck.com|publisher=Georgia Tech Athletic Association|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref> and freshmen were required to wear the RAT caps everyday until the Thanksgiving Day game with UGA (if Georgia Tech won) or until end of the school year (if Georgia Tech lost).<ref name="season"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/reck/about.php?PHPSESSID=413fd85976060e885c577f3391796e6f|title=What is the Ramblin Reck Club?|publisher=Ramblin' Wreck Club|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref> Freshmen were allowed to stop wearing their caps if the football team won the homecoming game. If the team loses, the previously stated rules apply. Freshmen caught not wearing the cap faced varying degrees of [[hazing]],<ref name="season"/> including having their hair shaved into the shape of a letter tee ("T"). Anti-hazing laws in the 1960s led to the virtual elimination of the tradition,<ref name="ens"/><!-- p345 --> although the use of RAT caps is still actively maintained by the marching band.

The RAT rules enforced by upperclassmen and in particular the Ramblin' Reck Club are presented in the July 17, 1964 edition of the ''Technique''. <ref>{{cite news

===Junior's Grill===
{{main|Junior's Grill}}
[[Image:Junior's Grill.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Junior's Grill]], on the side of [[Tech Tower]].]]
Junior's Grill is a restaurant located in East Campus next to [[Tech Tower]]. The restaurant was first opened in 1948 under the name Pilgrim's and was originally located on the corner of [[North Avenue (Atlanta)|North Avenue]] and Techwood Drive.  Its name changed to Junior's Grill in 1958, and it has moved locations twice since then.  Junior's Grill moved to its current location in the Bradley Building in 1994 when it was forced out of its old location by the need to construct apartments for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]].<ref name="The Junior's Tradition">{{cite web|url=http://juniors.gatech.edu/history.php|title=The Junior's Tradition|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> It is currently owned and run by Tommy Klemis.<ref name="jun">{{cite news|first=Joshua|last=Cuneo|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2004-08-27/focus/1|title=Junior’s struggles to match competition|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2004-08-27|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref>

The restaurant is similar in nature to [[The Varsity]] but is perhaps more cherished by Tech students due to its higher quality food, its renowned chicken finger baskets, its superlatively friendly staff, its convenient on-campus location, and its fame as a Tech tradition.<ref name="jun"/> Historically however, the staff was not always considered so friendly. During the late 1960s, the proprietor, known to students then only as "Junior," would routinely exhort his customers to "Eat it and beat it" due to the old facility's severely limited seating. The current restaurant also houses pieces of Tech history including aerial photographs of campus from various years, assorted Georgia Tech memorabilia, portraits of prominent individuals in Tech's history, and a section of the goalpost from Tech's [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|1990 National Championship]] game in the [[Citrus Bowl]].<ref name="The Junior's Tradition"/>

The events are usually lead off with various Greek sports tournaments followed by the Mini 500, Freshman Cake Race, and the Wreck Parade.  Every year the student body elects a Mr. and Ms. Georgia Tech.  These are two individuals who have excelled in academics and extracurriculars on Tech campus.

====Mini 500====
{{seealso|Mini 500}}
The Mini 500 is a [[tricycle]] race held during homecoming every year that requires teams to complete laps around Peters Parking Deck on East Campus.<ref name="tric">{{cite news|first=Madhu|last=Adiga|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2002-10-25/news/2|title=Fun, rule changes mark homecoming events|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2002-10-25|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatech.edu/help/tech-lingo.php|title=Tech Lingo|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> Men must complete 15 laps while women must complete 10. There are mandatory pit stops in which the front tire must be rotated 3 times during the course of the race. Because the average racer weighs more than the average 5 year old, the car is allowed one support brace to be welded on to the frame.

The race traces its roots back to the early 1960s when fraternity pledges were forced to ride tricycles around campus as a form of hazing.<ref name="hc">{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Edwards|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/1999-10-08/campus%20life/7|title=Homecoming traditions make Tech special|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1999-10-08|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> The race was eventually formalized in 1969 and rules were instituted to make the Mini 500 an instant classic.<ref>{{cite news

====Wreck Parade====
The Ramblin' Wreck Parade is a parade of classic cars and engineering oddities held before every homecoming football game. There are three classes of vehicles, which participate in the competition. The first class is known simply as classic cars and these are vehicles over a certain age limit (currently 25 years). The second class is known as fixed bodies and these vehicles are normal cars, which have only been cosmetically modified retaining their original [[drive train]]. These are often themed, but are distinctly different from [[Float (parade)|floats]] and are prohibited from being "pseudo-wrecks displaying pomps". The third class is the contraption category and these vehicles feature drive trains completely fabricated by students ranging from [[pendulum]] propulsion to [[pulse jet]] engines. Vehicles must feature an "indirect" drive system and are judged both on creativity and effective operation.

The Wreck parade dates back to 1929 when ''[[The Technique]]'' began an "Old Ford Race" to Athens.<ref name="hc"/> In 1932, the race was deemed unsafe by the administration so a parade of contraptions was created to subdue student protests.<ref name="hc"/>  The parade has run every year since 1932 except for the years of 1942-1943.  The American fuel shortage caused by [[World War II]] stopped the parade.  In 1944, the parade was renewed except the contraptions had to be [[Human-powered transport|human powered]].  [[Internal combustion engine|Gasoline power]] was allowed again in 1946.<ref name="fuelshortage">{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Goettling|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtopics/spr95/ww2.html|title=World War II and the Tech Connection|work=Tech Topics|date=1995-Spring|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref>

====Freshman Cake Race====
The Freshman Cake Race is a foot race from the [[Russ Chandler Stadium]] to [[Bobby Dodd Stadium]] that takes place before sunrise (about 6:00 am) on the morning of the homecoming game. This distance is about a one-half mile, so the crowd of several hundred participants engages in a mad sprint over the relatively short distance. The race runs through the middle of the campus's Greek sector and is often subject to tampering by fraternity students. The competitors are supposed to be freshmen (students with less than 30 hours of credit), and the race is split up by gender. The winners receive cakes baked by faculty, alumni, or students, and all participants receive cupcakes. The winners also receive a kiss from Mr. or Ms. Georgia Tech at the homecoming half-time show.

The race began as a cross-country race in 1911. In 1913, the winners received cakes from wives, mothers, and other women affiliated with Tech. The race was initially mandatory for all students.<ref name="hc"/><ref name="cake race">{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtraditions/traditions/cakerace.html|title=Freshman Cake Race|work=Tech Traditions|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref><ref name="timeline1910s">{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/1910s.html|title=Tech Timeline: 1910s|work=Tech Traditions|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

Membership in Reck Club was limited to two individuals per fraternity or military ROTC program.<ref name="newrecks"/>  A group known as the T-Club was charged with upholding the RAT rules with incoming freshmen.<ref name="newrecks"/>

Four years after Tech became coed, Reck Club became the first non-[[faith based]] organization on campus to admit a female member.<ref name="reck club"/>  Paula Stevenson was the club's first female member in 1956.<ref name="reck club"/>  Under Reck Club, the strict RAT rules slowly faded away. Anti-hazing laws severely diminished Reck Club's ability to punish Tech freshmen for disobeying the RAT rules in 1965.<ref name="reck club"/>  By 1967, the Club was given a more wholesome duty.

Reck Club was given charge of the Ramblin' Wreck in 1967 following the disbandment of the Student Council's Reck Committee.  A member from Reck Club known as the Wreck Driver has been elected annually since 1967 to drive the Wreck onto Grant Field for football games and other school functions.

=====Bull Dog Club=====
The Bull Dog Club was an honor society created in 1910 originally as a social branch of Tech's Koseme Society.<ref name="blueprintbdc10">{{Citation

The Bull Dogs rise to Institute prominence also lead to their eventual demise.  The Bull Dogs put a particular emphasis on mediating campus-wide sporting events.  The Bull Dogs utilized their Cake Race ties to the Athletic Association in order to coordinate the first intramurals on the athletic playing fields.<ref name="bulldog69"/>

The Bull Dogs also aided in spirit and tradition upkeep on campus by aiding in Ramblin' Wreck Parade judging, homecoming queen selection, and homecoming dance planning.<ref name="bulldog69"/> Despite the Bull Dogs roles in homecoming celebrations, their intramural coordination became their primary focus by the 1960's.<ref>{{Citation

====Georgia Tech Bands====
The Georgia Tech Bands are student musical groups fielded at many of the home athletic and schoolwide events.  None of the musicians receive scholarships for participating in the assorted bands meaning the bands are composed entirely of volunteers.  Since several schools in Atlanta do not field football teams, the GT Marching Band invites students from other Atlanta schools to participate (e.g. [[Kennesaw State]], [[Georgia State]], [[Agnes Scott]], etc.).

Every home football game and most away games include a 300 member Georgia Tech marching band performing during [[Dead ball (American football)|dead ball time]] and [[half-time]].  The GT Bands also field smaller pep bands at home [[basketball]], [[ice hockey]], and [[volleyball]] games.  The bands are known to follow teams for special events such as [[bowl games]] and [[NCAA Basketball Tournament|basketball tournaments]].  The ice hockey pep band in particular travels to [[Savannah, GA|Savannah]] every year for the [[Thrasher cup]].  The band has some of the richest traditions on campus including a strict enforcement of RAT caps amongst first year band members, no matter their actual year in college.<ref name="bands">{{cite web|url=http://www.gtband.net/mambo/|title=Georgia Tech Bands|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

The first Georgia Tech bands were formed in 1908 and lead by Robert "Biddy" Bidez.  Bidez lead the group until his graduation in 1912.  He was succeeded by another student named Mike Greenblatt who continued in Bidez's footsteps until 1913.  Greenblatt wrote the first versions of ''Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech''.  The first professional band director was Frank "Wop" Roman.  Roman is noted for writing Tech's Alma Mater as well as ''Up With the White and Gold''.  Roman copyrighted ''Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech'' in 1919 and lead the bands until his death in 1928.  Since Roman there have been seven professional band directors.  The directors have had varying levels of success and longevity.

====Swarm====
[[Image:GTflashcards79.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Georgia Tech Flashcard Section in 1979.]]
The Swarm is a spirit group<ref name="season"/> consisting of 900 Georgia Tech students found seated along the north end zone during home football games and on the court during basketball games.  The Swarm was started by the Suzanne "Suzy Swarm" Robinson of the  Ramblin' Reck Club in 1996 to increase the amount of student participation in the stands.<ref name="swarm1">{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Cunningham | url = http://www.nique.net/issues/2001-10-12/sports/2 | title = Techsters swarm to join student-run cheering squad | work = [[The Technique]] | date = [[2001-10-12]] | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}</ref>  The Swarm was only 250 members when it began in 1996.

=====Flashcards=====
A flashcard display is performed at every home football game by students.  The flashcard section was first formed in 1957 by an organization known as the Block-T Club.  The idea for a flashcard section and group to organize its efforts was conceived by members of the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity.  Through the support of Ramblin' Reck Club the first flashcard section featured 400 freshmen and highly coordinated flashcard images.<ref name="blueprint58">{{Citation

====Goldfellas====
[[Image:GTgoldfellas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Georgia Tech Goldfellas.]]

Occasionally, the Goldfellas will attend home basketball, volleyball, or other sporting events. The group had its origins in the 1998 Georgia Tech football season, when a group of guys painted up for the homecoming game against the favored Virginia Cavaliers. The Jackets upset the Cavaliers and the tradition was started and passed on by residents in the now defunct Area II dormitories.<ref name="goldf"/> Each member is given a unique face design that is retired upon his graduation. The group is not considered an official club as its members do not bow to any charters and are not affiliated with Swarm.  The Goldfellas take pride in their complete lack of clothing besides a yellow wig and gym shorts.  The group never sits during the course of a football game, not even during halftime. The largest gathering of the Goldfellas occurred in the 2007 football game against rival University of Georgia with over 80 Tech students painted up with the Goldfellas for the event.<ref name="goldf"/>

And our union is a lasting bond.<br />
Oh! May we be united.<br />
Till the victory of life is won.<br />

:''Go Georgia Tech!''

===Yellow Jackets===
{{see also|Buzz (mascot)}}
[[Image:YellowJacketProgression.jpg|thumb|150px|right|1927, 1952, & 1987 Yellow Jacket Emblems]]
The term Yellow Jacket or Yellowjacket has been used to refer to students and the various sports teams as early as the 1890's.  Fans of Georgia Tech would often wear yellow jackets to sporting events in support of the early Georgia Tech teams.  The early football teams, lacking gold fabric for jerseys, wore [[yellow]] jerseys. John Heisman told the [[Atlanta Constitution]] that he wanted his teams to be referred to as the Yellow Jackets in October of 1905.  In November of 1906, the [[Atlanta Journal]] portrayed a [[University of Georgia]] [[American football|football]] player being attacked by a [[yellowjacket]] with the words "Somebody's about to get stung" as the caption.<ref>{{ cite news | title = First Yellowjacket Image in AJC | url = http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/fall06/InFocusImg1.html| date = Fall-06 | accessdate = 2007-05-29 | last = | first = | work = Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine }}</ref>  This would be the first time and not the last time that the Georgia Tech sports teams would be referred to as the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Yellow Jackets Fly By 100-year Mark | url = http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/fall06/InFocus.html | date = Fall-06 | accessdate = 2007-05-29 | last = | first = | work = Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine }}</ref>

Buzz Bee became the [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] Yellow Jacket in 1979.  He was initially an impromptu student volunteer but is now an official cheerleader that requires an intense tryout process.  This Buzz character would be the model for a new Georgia Tech emblem, designed in 1985 by Mike Lester.<ref>{{cite news | title = A Walk Through Tech's History | url = http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/sum04/article1.html | date = Summer-04 | accessdate = 2007-05-29 | last = | first = | work = Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine }}</ref>

In [[1927]], a student, receiving 2 enrollment forms, also enrolled as ''George P. Burdell'' and attended as both names, so Burdell obtained a B.S. [[1930]], got a Master's, and in [[World War II]], went to [[Harvard]] and joined the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]].<ref name="tbbd"/> Since the 1960s, some students have managed to re-enroll George P.

When Tech switched to online class registration, Burdell took every course offered that term.<ref name="tbbd"/> After initially vigorously searching for the [[hackers]], the Institute has since accepted the presence of George P. Burdell in every year's class. George P. Burdell is also a common tool for pranks at various school events and games.

In 1916, Georgia Tech's football team (coached by the legendary [[John Heisman]] &mdash; for whom the [[Heisman Trophy|trophy]] is named) defeated Cumberland 222-0, the largest margin of victory in college football history. <ref name="story222">{{cite web|url=http://www2.cumberland.edu/about/gotc/gamestory.html|title=222-0: The Story of The Game of the Century|first=G.

===41-38===
41-38 is the score of two momentous victories by Georgia Tech over the [[University of Virginia]] in [[college football]].<ref name="uva">{{cite news|first=Larry|last=Memberg|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/1999-07-09/sports/1|title='99 Jackets look to top last year's madness|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1999-07-09|accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref>

In 1990, Virginia won its first seven games and raced out to a #1 ranking in both polls. Undefeated but unheralded Georgia Tech came into [[Scott Stadium]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and beat the Cavaliers 41-38 on a last-second field goal by Scott Sisson.<ref name="uva"/> This victory set off celebrations back in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] that culminated in GT students breaking into [[Bobby Dodd Stadium]], closed for the road game that weekend, and tearing down a goalpost (a common victory celebration when a game is played ''on one's home field''). GT went on to be ACC champion and co-national champion with [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] that year. Virginia's season spiraled downhill from there, going 1-3 to finish 8-4 and ranked only #22.<ref>{{cite news|first=Brett|last=Jerasa|url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/CVArticle.asp?ID=13670&pid=920|title=Eyeing a bowl bid, Cavs face Jackets|work=[[The Cavalier Daily]]|date=2002-10-25|accessdate=2007-02-20}}</ref>

In 1998, the first year since 1990 that both teams had come into this game with high hopes, #25 GT hosted undefeated #7 UVA, and again pulled off the upset. This time, the Jackets came from three touchdowns behind and survived a 54-yard field goal miss by UVA kicker Todd Braverman as time ran out.<ref name="uva"/> Since then, any time the two teams have met with rankings and bowl positions on the line, GT fans have used "41-38" as a rallying cry, similar to Miami fans' "[[Wide Right (Florida State)|Wide Right]]" against [[Florida State University|Florida State]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedirtroad.net/jeff/journal/2005/11/11/41-38/|title=41-38|work=Writings from the Dirt Road|date=2005-11-11|accessdate=2007-03-23|quote=Say "41-38″ to any Georgia Tech fan and they will know exactly what opponent you are talking about.}}</ref>

From 1940 to 1987, Tech offered a class called Drownproofing,<ref name="timeline1940s">{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/1940s.html|title=Tech Timeline: 1940s|work=Tech Traditions|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> which was required for graduation for male students. The class was developed by Coach Fred Lanoue for the Naval School which was located at Georgia Tech prior to and during [[World War II]]. He taught students how to float in water for extended periods of time with ankles and wrists bound, how (unbound) to swim 50 yards (46 meters) underwater, and other water survival skills. At the time it was considered a prime example of the difficulty of Tech's curriculum, and referred to in jest by students as "Drowning 101."<ref>{{cite news

===Anak Society===
{{main|ANAK Society}}
The Anak Society is said to be the only official [[secret society]] on campus. Since its founding in 1908,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/finding-aids/display/xsl/MS156|title=Inventory of the ANAK Society Records, 1948-1983|publisher=Georgia Tech Archives and Records Management|accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref> the ANAK Society has selected seniors who "exhibit a true love for Georgia Tech through their campus involvement and compassion for their fellow students," according to their website.<ref name="anak">{{

==Jargon==
===North Avenue Trade School===
Georgia Tech is sometimes called the "North Avenue Trade School," although this was never its official title.<ref name="ens">{{cite book|first=Robert C.|last=McMath|coauthors=Ronald H. Bayor, James E. Brittain, Lawrence Foster, August W. Giebelhaus, and Germaine M.

===The Institute===
Traditionally, Georgia Tech has been called "the Institute" while discouraging use of the terms "the university" or "the college" and such.  The Institute had been divided into "Schools" which are now called "Colleges" for each field of study. For instance, when Georgia Tech's football team played the University of Miami for its 2006 Homecoming game, several students were seen wearing gold t-shirts that said "Fear the I!" (mocking Miami's tradition of being called the U).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gtsports.blogspot.com/2006/11/fear-i.html|publisher=Georgia Tech Sports Blog|title=Fear the I|accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref>

The Georgia Institute of Technology is one of only five [[Division I|Division I Bowl Subdivision]] football programs without "University" in the school's name. The others are [[Boston College]] and the three service academies ([[United States Air Force Academy]], [[United States Military Academy]] and the [[United States Naval Academy]].

===Getting Shafted===
"Getting shafted" generally refers to the rigorous academic difficulty of Georgia Tech's curriculum.<ref name="webster2004"/> The physical manifestation of this phrase is the [[Kessler Campanile]], a "shaft-like" structure near the Student Center. The phallic shape of the structure invites its designation as a shafting device.<ref name="webster2004"/><ref name="nargon">{{cite news|title=The Tech Dictionary|publisher=North Avenue Review|url=http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/nar/summer98/fresh/dictionary.html|accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>

===TBS===
Due to the traditionally high ratio of male to female students, some students have felt that certain women at Georgia Tech may be stuck up because of all the attention they get from an overwhelming number of males. These students call the behavior of the female in this scenario as "Tech Bitch Syndrome" or "TBS" for short.<ref>{{cite news|first=Aileen|last=Li|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2007-03-09/focus/3|title=Women speak on campus experience|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[2007-03-09]]|accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Madhu|last=Adiga|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2002-06-14/opinions/4|title=Staff Editorial: Advice for males from a Tech female: there is no TBS|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[2002-06-14]]|accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Brinda|last=Ramaiya|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2000-03-17/news/1|title=Women’s awareness month kicks off|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[2000-03-17]]|accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2000-03-31/news/7|title=Scientists isolate bacteria that causes TBS|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[2000-03-31]]|accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Allison|last=Roberts|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/1999-04-16/opinions/5|title=Tech females should resist ratio stereotypes|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[1999-04-16]]|accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Miklos|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/1999-09-17/opinions/6|title=Tech girls give Tech guys shaft in whole new way|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[1999-09-17]]|accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref>

Of course, such remarks are controversial as there will be different attitudes of different people everywhere. Women against the term claim that they are often labeled the term without warrant.<ref >{{cite news|title=The Tech Dictionary|publisher=North Avenue Review|url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/nar/summer98/fresh/tbs.html|date=Summer 1998|accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref> An analysis of the term was done by Georgia Tech's Sexual Violence and Prevention Initiative.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why is VOICE at Tech?|publisher=VOICE|url=http://www.voice.gatech.edu/site_content/2_For_Men/1_Why_We_Are_Here/page_3.php|accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref>

===Getting Out===
"Getting out" refers to graduating from Georgia Tech. Graduates never say they graduated from Georgia Tech, they simply say "I got out."<ref name="webster2004"/><ref>{{cite news|first=Dave|last=McGill|url=http://www.gtalumni.org/news/ttopics/fall96/out.html|title="Getting Out" the Hard Way|work=Tech Topics|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|date=Fall 1996|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Two Bits Man|authorlink=Two Bits Man|url=http://nique.net/issues/2007-08-24/entertainment/4|title=Two Bits Man welcomes new RATS to Tech campus|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[2007-08-24]]|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref>

===Ma Tech===
An affectionate name that students and alumni alike use for their Alma Mater.<ref name="season"/><ref name="webster2004"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/mecheng/profiles/mcgoff.htm|title=Matthew McGoff|publisher=The Sloan Career Cornerstone Center|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref>

===The Hill===
A nickname given to Tech's academic administration.  Topologically, Tech's first [[Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District|administrative buildings]] were built on an actual hill in Atlanta.  As campus expanded onto surrounding lower terrain, the Hill became a much more prominent sight on campus.  The term now is typically used in derision when referring to the administration.  The Hill also refers to the steep incline of Bobby Dodd Way, which residents of East Campus must trek up in order to attend class.  The climb is often referred to as a hike up the Freshman Hill as many freshman courses are held in buildings on the Hill or near the Hill.
