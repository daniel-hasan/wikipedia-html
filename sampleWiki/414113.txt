'''''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy''' comprises three [[live-action]] [[fantasy]] [[epic film]]s: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' ([[2001 in film|2001]]), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' ([[2002 in film|2002]]) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]) (often abbreviated to 'LotR', 'FotR', 'TTT' and 'RotK').<ref>{{cite web | work=elvish.org | title=Abbreviations |url=http://www.elvish.org/elm/abbrev.html| accessdate=2006-10-12}}</ref> The trilogy is based on the book ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], and while it follows the book's general storyline, it also features some additions to and deviations from the source material.

Set in the fictional world of [[Middle-earth]], the three films follow the young [[hobbit]] [[Frodo Baggins]] as he and a [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] embark on a quest to destroy the [[One Ring]], and thus ensure the destruction of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]]. However, the Fellowship breaks and Frodo continues the quest together with his loyal companion [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and the treacherous [[Gollum]]. Meanwhile, the wizard [[Gandalf]] and [[Aragorn]], heir in exile to the throne of [[Gondor]], unite and rally the [[Middle-earth peoples#Free Peoples|Free Peoples of Middle-earth]] in several battles culminating in the [[War of the Ring]]. The wizard [[Saruman]] is defeated, The Ring is destroyed, and Sauron and his forces are vanquished.

The films were written, produced and directed by [[Peter Jackson]], co-written by [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] and distributed by [[New Line Cinema]]. Considered to be one of the biggest movie projects ever undertaken, with an overall budget of $280 million, the entire project took eight years, with the filming for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in Jackson's native [[New Zealand]].

The trilogy was a large financial success, with the films being the 14<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> [[List of highest-grossing films|most successful of all time]], respectively, unadjusted for inflation. The films were critically acclaimed, winning 17 [[Academy Awards]] in total, as well as wide praise for the cast and for the innovative practical and digital special effects.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring| publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/lord_of_the_rings_the_fellowship_of_the_ring/| accessdate = 2006-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers| publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers/| accessdate = 2006-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King| publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url = http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/lord_of_the_rings_the_return_of_the_king/| accessdate = 2006-10-12}}</ref> Each film in the trilogy also had Special Extended Editions (SEE), released a year after the theatrical release on [[DVD]]. Two prequels, one based on ''[[The Hobbit]]'', are in development for 2010 and 2011 releases.
==Development==
Director [[Peter Jackson]] first came into contact with ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' when he saw [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|1978 film]], which he found confusing. Afterwards, he read a tie-in edition of the book<ref>{{cite news|author=Ian Nathan|title=Peter Jackson|pages=90|publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=[[2003-11-28]]}}</ref> during a twelve-hour train journey from [[Wellington]] to [[Auckland]] when he was seventeen. Jackson's reaction was, "I can't wait until somebody makes a movie of this book because ''I'd'' like to see it!"<ref name="i want to see it">Sibley (2001), p.11-12</ref>

In 1995, Jackson was finishing ''[[The Frighteners]]'' and considered ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a new project, wondering "why nobody else seemed to be doing anything about it".<ref name="i want to see it"/> With the new developments in [[computer generated imagery]] following ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', Jackson set about planning a fantasy film that would be relatively serious and feel "real". By October, he and his partner [[Fran Walsh]] teamed up with [[Miramax]] boss [[Harvey Weinstein]] to negotiate with [[Saul Zaentz]] who had held the rights to the book since the early 1970s, pitching an adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and two films based on ''The Lord of the Rings''. Negotiations then stalled when [[Universal Studios]] offered Jackson a [[remake]] of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''.<ref name="cheat">{{cite book | author = [[Brian Sibley]] | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher =Harper Collins | date =2006 | location =London | pages =310-328 | id = ISBN 0-00-717558-2 | chapter = Cheats, Spooks, Hobbits and Apes }}</ref> Weinstein was furious, and further problems arose when it turned out Zaentz did not have distribution rights to ''The Hobbit''; [[United Artists]], which was in the market, did. By April 1996 the rights question was still not resolved.<ref name="cheat"/> Jackson decided to move ahead with ''King Kong'' before filming ''The Lord of the Rings'', prompting Universal to enter a deal with Miramax to receive foreign earnings from ''The Lord of the Rings'' whilst Miramax received foreign earnings from ''King Kong''.<ref name="cheat"/>

When Universal cancelled ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' in 1997,<ref name="Timeline">{{cite web| last = Watkin| first = Tim| title = The 'Rings' movies, a potted history| publisher = New Zealand Herald| url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=200&objectid=232465| date = [[2001-08-12]]| accessdate = 2006-12-21}}</ref> Jackson and Walsh immediately received support from Weinstein and began a six-week process of sorting out the rights. Jackson and Walsh asked [[Costa Botes]] to write a synopsis of the book and they began to re-read the book. Two to three months later, they had written their treatment.<ref name="quest">{{cite book | author = [[Brian Sibley]] | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher =Harper Collins | date =2006 | location =London | pages =329-87 | id = ISBN 0-00-717558-2 | chapter = Quest for the Ring }}</ref> The first film would have dealt with what would become ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]]'' and the beginning of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]]'', ending with the death of [[Saruman]], and [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] going to [[Minas Tirith]]. In this treatment Gwaihir and Gandalf visit Edoras after escaping Saruman, Gollum attacks Frodo when the Fellowship is still united, and [[Farmer Maggot]], [[Glorfindel]], [[Radagast]], [[Elladan and Elrohir]] are present. Bilbo attends the Council of Elrond, Sam looks into Galadriel's mirror, Saruman is redeemed before he dies and the Nazgûl just make it into Mount Doom before they fall.<ref name="quest"/> They presented their treatment to Harvey and [[Bob Weinstein]], the latter of whom they focused on impressing with their screenwriting as he had not read the book. They agreed upon two films and a total budget of $75 million.<ref name="quest"/> 

During mid-1997,<ref name="FOTR SEE">{{cite video| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Appendices|medium = [[DVD]]|publisher = [[New Line Cinema]] | date = 2002}}</ref> Jackson and Walsh began writing with Stephen Sinclair.<ref name="quest"/> Sinclair's partner, [[Philippa Boyens]], was a major fan of the book and joined the writing team after reading their treatment.<ref name="FOTR SEE"/> It took 13-14 months to write the two film scripts,<ref name="FOTR SEE"/> which were 147 and 144 pages respectively. Sinclair left the project due to theatrical obligations. Amongst their revisions, Sam, Merry and Pippin are caught eavesdropping and forced to go along with Frodo. Gandalf's account of his time at Orthanc was pulled out of flashback and Lothlórien was cut with [[Galadriel]] attending the Council of Elrond. [[Denethor]], Boromir's father, also attends the Council, and other changes included having [[Arwen]] rescue Frodo, and the action sequence involving the cave troll. Arwen was even going to kill the [[Witch-king]]. Most significantly, there was an all-new sequence. A [[Ringwraith]] kills Saruman and attacks Gandalf at Orthanc. Seeing this from the Seeing Seat, now at [[Emyn Muil]] rather than [[Amon Hen]], Frodo puts on the Ring and draws him all the way to the Seat on his [[Fell beast]]. Frodo manages to save Sam and stabs the wraith in his heart.<ref name="quest"/> 

Trouble struck when Marty Katz was sent to New Zealand. Spending four months there, he told Miramax that the films were more likely to cost $150 million, and with Miramax unable to finance this, and with $15 million already spent, they decided to merge the two films into one. On [[June 17]] [[1998]], Bob Weinstein presented a treatment of a single two-hour film version of the book. He suggested cutting [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]] and the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]], "losing or using" [[Saruman]], merging [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]] with [[Éowyn]] as [[Boromir]]'s sister, shortening [[Rivendell]] and [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] as well as having [[Ent]]s prevent the Uruk-hai kidnapping Merry and Pippin.<ref name="quest"/> Upset by the idea of "cutting out half the good stuff"<ref name="FOTR SEE"/> Jackson balked, and Miramax declared that any script or [[Weta Workshop|Weta Workshop's]] work was theirs.<ref name="quest"/> Jackson went around Hollywood for four weeks,<ref name="FOTR SEE"/> showing a thirty-five minute video of their work, before meeting with [[Mark Ordesky]] of [[New Line Cinema]].<ref>Sibley (2006), p.388-92</ref> At New Line Cinema, [[Robert Shaye]] viewed the video, and then asked why they were making two films when the book was published as three volumes; he wanted to make a film trilogy. Now Jackson, Walsh and Boyens had to write three new scripts.<ref name="FOTR SEE"/>

The expansion to three films allowed a lot more creative freedom, although Jackson, Walsh and Boyens had to restructure their script accordingly. Each film is not exactly based on each volume of the book, but rather they represent a three-part adaptation, as Jackson takes a chronological approach to the story, whilst Tolkien retold chunks of his fictional history (the first half of ''The Two Towers'' book focused purely on Aragorn & Co., then the second half jumped back in time to the beginning of the book but focused on what Frodo was doing at the same time). Frodo's quest is the main focus, and Aragorn is the main sub-plot,<ref>{{cite web| last = Head| first = Steve| title = An interview with Peter Jackson| publisher = IGN| date = 2002-12-13| url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/380/380092p1.html| accessdate = 2006-10-24}}</ref> and many sequences (such as [[Tom Bombadil]] and the [[Scouring of the Shire]]) that do not contribute directly to those two plots were left out. Much effort was put into creating satisfactory conclusions and making sure exposition did not bog down the pacing. Amongst new sequences, there are also expansions on elements Tolkien kept ambiguous, such as the battles and the creatures.

Above all, most characters have been altered for extra drama. [[Aragorn]], [[Théoden]] and [[Treebeard]] have added or modified elements of self-doubt, whilst [[Galadriel]], [[Elrond]] and [[Faramir]] have been darkened. [[Boromir]] and [[Gollum]] are (arguably) relatively more sympathetic, whilst some characters such as [[Legolas]], [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], [[Saruman]] and [[Denethor]] have been simplified. Some characters, such as [[Arwen]] and [[Éomer]], are given actions from minor characters such as [[Glorfindel]] and [[Erkenbrand]], and generally lines of dialogue are somewhat preserved or switched around between locations or characters depending on suitability of the scenes. New scenes were also added to expand on characterization. In the meantime during shooting, the screenplays would undergo many daily transformations, due to contributions from cast looking to further explore their characters.<ref name="FOTR SEE"/> Most notable amongst these rewrites was the character [[Arwen]], who was originally planned as a warrior princess, but reverted back to her book counterpart, who remains physically inactive in the story (though she sends moral and military support).<ref name="TTT SEE"> {{cite video| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers "Appendices"| medium = [[DVD]]| publisher = [[New Line Cinema]]| date = 2003}}</ref>

==Production design==
[[Image:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|right|Alan Lee at Worldcon 2005 in Glasgow, August 2005.]]
{{main|Production design of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy}}
Jackson began storyboarding the trilogy with [[Christian Rivers]] in [[August 1997]] and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name="TTT Art">{{cite book | last = Russell| first = Gary| authorlink = Gary Russell| title = The Art of the Two Towers| publisher = Harper Collins| date = 2003}}</ref> Jackson hired long-time collaborator [[Richard Taylor (movies)|Richard Taylor]] to lead [[Weta Workshop]] on five major design elements: armour, weapons, prosthetics/make-up, creatures and miniatures. In November 1997,<ref name="FOTR SEE" /> famed Tolkien illustrators [[Alan Lee]] and [[John Howe]] joined the project. Most of the imagery in the films is based on their various illustrations.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Art of Film| publisher = JW's LOTR fansite| url = http://www.angelfire.com/film/rings/art.html | accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref> Grant Major was charged with the task of converting Lee and Howe's designs into architecture, creating models of the sets, whilst Dan Hennah worked as art director, scouting locations and organizing the building of sets.

Jackson's vision of [[Middle-earth]] was described as being "[[Ray Harryhausen]] meets [[David Lean]]" by Randy Cook.<ref name="ROTK SEE">{{cite video| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King "Appendices"| medium = [[DVD]]| publisher = [[New Line Cinema]]| date = 2004 }}</ref> Jackson wanted a gritty realism and historical regard for the fantasy, and attempted to make the world rational and believable. For example, the New Zealand army helped build Hobbiton months before filming began so the plants could really grow.<ref>{{cite news| title = Hobbiton is being built| publisher = The One Ring.net| date = 2006-04-12| url = http://www.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/923891184| accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref> Creatures were designed to be biologically believable, such as the enormous wings of the [[Fell beast]] to help it fly.<ref>{{cite book | last = French | first = Lawrence | coauthor = Paul A.

==Filming==
{{main article|Principal photography of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy}}
[[Principal photography]] for all three films was conducted concurrently in [[New Zealand]] from [[October 11]], [[1999]] through to [[December 22]], [[2000]] for 274 days. [[Pick-up (film)|Pick-up]] shoots were conducted annually from 2001 to 2004. The trilogy was shot at over 150 different locations<ref name="Trilogy book" />, with seven different units shooting, as well as soundstages around [[Wellington]] and [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]]. As well as Jackson directing the whole production, other unit directors included John Mahaffie, Geoff Murphy, [[Fran Walsh]], Barrie Osbourne, Rick Porras and any other assistant director, producer or writer available. Jackson monitored these units with live satellite feeds, and with the added pressure of constant script re-writes and the multiple units interpreting his envisioned result, he only got around four hours of sleep a night.<ref name="TTT SEE" /> Due to the remoteness of some of New Zealand's untamed landscapes, the crew would also bring survival kits in case helicopters could not reach the location to bring them home in time.<ref name="FOTR SEE" />

==Special effects==
{{main|Special effects of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy}}
The first film has around 540 effect shots, the second 799, and the third 1488 (2730 in total). The total increases to 3420 with the extended editions. 260 visual effect artists began work on the trilogy, and the number doubled by ''The Two Towers''. The crew, led by Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook, worked long and hard hours, often overnight, to produce special effects within a short space of time. Jackson's overactive imagination was a driving force. For example, several major shots of Helm's Deep were produced within the last six weeks of post-production of ''The Two Towers'', and the same happened again within the last six weeks on ''The Return of the King''.

==Post-production==
Each film had the benefit of a full year of post-production time before its respective December release, often finishing in October-November, with the crew immediately going to work on the next film. In the later part of this period, Jackson would move to [[London]] to supervise the scoring and continue editing, whilst having a computer feed for discussions to The Dorchester Hotel, and a "fat pipe" of Internet connections from [[Pinewood Studios]] to look at the special effects. He had a [[Polycom]] video link and 5.1 surround sound to organise meetings, and listen to new music and sound effects generally wherever he was. The extended editions also had a tight schedule at the start of each year to complete special effects and music.

===Editing===
To avoid pressure, Jackson hired a different editor for each film. John Gilbert worked on the first film, Mike Horton and Jabez Olssen on the second and longtime Jackson collaborator [[Jamie Selkirk]] and [[Annie Collins]] on the third. Daily rushes would often last up to four hours, with scenes being done throughout 1999–2002 for the rough (4 1/2 hours) assemblies of the films.<ref name="FOTR SEE" /> In total, six million feet of film (over 1,100 miles)<ref name="Trilogy book" /> was edited down to the 11 hours and 23 minutes (683 minutes) of Extended DVD running time. This was the final area of shaping of the films, when Jackson realised that sometimes the best scripting could be redundant on screen, as he picked apart scenes every day from multiple takes.

Editing on the first film was relatively easygoing, with Jackson coming up with the concept of an Extended Edition later on, although after a screening to New Line they had to re-edit the beginning for a prologue. ''The Two Towers'' was always acknowledged by the crew as the most difficult film to make, as "it had no beginning or end", and had the additional problem of inter-cutting storylines appropriately. Jackson even continued editing the film when that part of the schedule officially ended, resulting in some scenes, including the reforging of [[Andúril]], Gollum's back-story, and Saruman's demise, being moved to ''The Return of the King''. Later, Saruman's demise was controversially cut from the cinema edition (but included in the extended edition) when Jackson felt it was not starting the third film effectively enough.<ref>{{cite news| title = Hey, what happened to Saruman?| publisher = CNN.com| date = 2003-12-17| url = http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/12/17/film.rings.saruman.ap/| accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref> As with all parts of the third film's post-production, editing was very chaotic. The first time Jackson actually saw the completed film was at the Wellington premiere.
====Deleted scenes====
Many filmed scenes remain unused, not even included in the Extended Editions. These scenes remain unincluded largely because many of them significantly change or add to the plot of Tolkien's original storyline.

* Additional footage from the Battle of the Last Alliance in the FotR Prologue.
* An obscure shot from the trailers of two Elven girls playing about in Rivendell.
* Dialogue from the Council of Elrond, such as Gandalf explaining how Sauron forged the One Ring.<ref name="FOTR SEE" />
* An attack by Moria Orcs on Lothlórien after the Fellowship leaves Moria. Jackson replaced this with a more suspenseful entrance for the Fellowship. Much of the lost footage can be seen as promotional material on the FotR theatrical DVD and tie-in books, documentary footage on the Extended Editions, and Trading Cards.
* More Arwen footage, including a flashback scene of her first meeting with a beardless Aragorn (seen in the Two Towers teaser).
* Faramir having a vision of Frodo becoming like Gollum.<ref name="TTT SEE" />
* Famous footage of [[Arwen]] at Helm's Deep, cut by Jackson during a revision to the film's plot. Foreshadowing this sequence were scenes where Arwen and Elrond visit Galadriel at Lothlórien (seen in ''The Two Towers'' teaser trailer). The scene was edited down to a telepathic communication between Elrond and Galadriel.<ref name="TTT SEE" />
*Théoden speaking to the troops in the armoury, prior to the Battle of Helm's Deep.
* Éowyn defending the refugees in the Glittering Caves from Uruk-hai intruders.<ref>''The Fellowship of the Ring'' DVD preview of ''The Two Towers'' (2002)</ref>
* An unknown scene displayed in ''The Two Towers'' preview of Éomer lowering a spear while riding his horse.
* A line of dialogue during the death of Saruman, in which he reveals that Wormtongue poisoned Théodred, giving further context as to why Wormtongue kills Saruman and Legolas in turn kills Wormtongue.{{ME-fact|date=October 2007}}
* A conversation between Elrond and Arwen in a library in Rivendell, after Arwen decides to wait for Aragorn. Elrond leaves saying "I cannot protect you anymore." <ref> ''The Return of the King'' trailer </ref>
* Aragorn having his armour fitted during the preparations for the [[Battle of the Morannon|Battle of the Black Gate]]. This was the final scene filmed during principal photography.<ref name="ROTK SEE" />
* Sauron fighting Aragorn at the Black Gate. A computer-generated Troll was placed over Sauron due to Jackson feeling the scene was inappropriate. Sauron is also seen in a beautiful form as Annatar, giver of gifts.<ref name="ROTK SEE" />
* Also at the Black Gate sequence, Pippin was seen in the trailer holding a wounded Merry, a scene which takes place after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields upon Pippin discovering Merry under the ''[[mûmak]]''.
* Further epilogue footage, including that of Legolas and Gimli, as well as Éowyn and Faramir's wedding and Aragorn's death and funeral.<ref>{{cite web| last = Knowles| first = Harry| authorlink = Harry Knowles| title = There and Back Again: A Geek's Adventures in Middle-earth, CHAPTER FOUR!| publisher = Ain't It Cool News| date = 2000-12-17| url = http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=7728| accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref>

Peter Jackson has stated that he would like to include some of these unused scenes in a future 'Ultimate Edition' home video release (probably High Definition) of the film trilogy. They will not be re-inserted into the movies but available for viewing separately. This edition will also include outtakes.<ref>{{cite web| title = Peter Jackson talks of Lord of the Rings Ultimate Box Set| publisher = The Movie Blog.com| url = http://www.themovieblog.com/2005/01/peter-jackson-talks-of-lord-of-the-rings-ultimate-box-set | accessdate = 2005-01-14}}</ref>

{{sample box end}}
[[Howard Shore]] composed the trilogy's music. He was hired in August 2000<ref>{{cite news| last = Davidson| first = Paul| title = Lord of the Rings Composer Confirmed| publisher = IGN| url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034262p1.html| date = 2000-08-15| accessdate = 2006-11-14}}</ref> and visited the set, and watched the assembly cuts of Films 1 and 3. Although the first film had some of its score recorded in Wellington,<ref name="FOTR SEE" /> virtually all of the trilogy's score was recorded in [[Watford]] Town Hall and mixed at [[Abbey Road Studios]]. Jackson planned to advise the score for six weeks each year in London, though for ''The Two Towers'' he stayed 12. As a [[Beatles]] fan, Jackson had a photo tribute done there on the [[zebra crossing]].<ref name="TTT SEE" />

The score is primarily played by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], and many artists such as [[Ben Del Maestro]], [[Enya]], [[Renee Fleming]], [[James Galway|Sir James Galway]] and [[Annie Lennox]] contributed. Even actors [[Billy Boyd]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Liv Tyler]], [[Miranda Otto]] (extended cuts only for the latter two) and [[Peter Jackson]] (for a single gong sound in the second film) contributed to the score. Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens also wrote the lyrics to various music and songs, which David Salo translated into Tolkien's languages. The third film's end song, ''[[Into the West (song)|Into the West]]'', was a tribute to a young filmmaker Jackson and Walsh befriended named [[Cameron Duncan]], who died of cancer in 2003.<ref name="ROTK SEE" />

Shore composed a main theme for The Fellowship rather than many different character themes, and its strength and weaknesses in volume are depicted at different points in the trilogy. On top of that, individual themes were composed to represent different cultures. Infamously, the amount of music Shore had to write every day for the third film increased dramatically to around seven minutes.<ref name="ROTK SEE" />

===Sound===
Sound technicians spent the early part of the year trying to find the right sounds: animal sounds like tigers and walruses were bought. Sometimes human voices were used, such as Fran Walsh as the Nazgûl scream and David Farmer as some Warg howls. Some sounds were unexpected: a donkey screech is the Fell Beast, and the ''mûmakil'' roar comes from the beginning and end of a lion. In addition, there was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|ADR]] for most of the dialogue.

The technicians worked with New Zealand locals to get many of the sounds. They re-recorded sounds in abandoned tunnels for an echo-like effect in the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] sequence. 10,000 New Zealand cricket fans provided the sound of the Uruk-hai army in ''The Two Towers'', with Jackson acting as conductor during a single cricket break.<ref name="TTT SEE" /> They spent time recording sounds in a graveyard at night, and also had construction workers drop stone blocks for the sounds of boulders firing and landing in ''The Return of the King''. Mixing generally took place between August and November at "The Film Mix", before Jackson commissioned building a new studio in 2003. Annoyingly, the building wasn't fully completed as they started mixing for ''The Return of the King''.<ref name="ROTK SEE" />

==Releases==
The online promotional trailer for the trilogy was first released on [[April 27]] [[2000]] and shattered records for download hits, registering 1.7 million hits in the first 24 hours of its release.<ref>http://www.xenite.org/faqs/lotr_movie/download-press-release.html</ref> The trailer used a selection from the soundtrack for [[Braveheart]], and [[The Shawshank Redemption]] among other cuts. In 2001, 24 minutes of footage from the trilogy, primarily the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] sequence, was shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and was very well received.<ref> http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/200/200155p1.html </ref> The showing also included an area designed to look like [[Middle-earth]].<ref name="Trilogy book" /> A full description of the footage can be found here: [http://www.theonering.net/perl/newsview/11/990112543]

''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released [[December 19]], [[2001]]. It grossed $47 million in its U.S. opening weekend and made around $871 million worldwide. A preview of ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' was attached at the end of the cinema release for the film.<ref>[http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/317/317797p1.html ''A Longer ''Fellowship'' Ending?''] by [[Paul Davidson]], last retrieved on [[5 August]] [[2006]]</ref> 

A promotional trailer was later released. The trailer contained some music re-scored from the film ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]''.<ref> http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021117/ANSWERMAN/211170301 </ref> ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' was released [[December 18]], [[2002]]. It grossed $62 million in its first U.S. weekend and out-grossed its predecessor, grossing $926 million worldwide.

The promotional trailer for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' was debuted exclusively before the New Line Cinema film ''[[Secondhand Lions]]'' on [[September 23]], [[2003]].<ref>[http://www.movieweb.com/news/14/1714.php MovieWeb.com's News for [[23 September]], [[2003]], last retrieved on [[5 August]], [[2006]]</ref> Released [[December 17]] [[2003]], its first U.S. weekend gross was $72 million, and became the second film (after [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']]) to gross over $1 billion worldwide.

Each film was released on standard two disc edition DVDs containing previews of the next film. The success of the theatrical cuts brought about four disc Extended Editions, with new editing, added special effects and music. These are not "Director's Cuts", however, as Jackson has said he prefers the theatrical versions.<ref>[http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/571/571469p1.html] IGN DVD's extended Return of the King review by Andy Patrizio. December 8, 2004, last retrieved on [[23 November]], [[2007]]</ref>

With the extended cuts of the films and their respective special features spread over two discs apiece, the Special Extended Edition DVD sets were issued as follows:
* ''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'', [[November 12]], [[2002]]. Containing 30 minutes more footage, in a green sleeve. It contains an Alan Lee painting of the Fellowship entering Moria, and the Moria Gate on the back of the sleeve. An [[Argonath]] styled bookend was issued within a Collector's Edition.
* ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'', [[November 18]], [[2003]]. It contains 44 minutes more footage. A Rohirrim sun symbol decorates the back of its red sleeve and a Lee painting of Gandalf the White's entrance. The Collector's Edition contained a Sméagol statue, with a crueler-looking statue of his Gollum persona available for order during a limited time.
* ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' [[December 14]], [[2004]]. It has 50 minutes more footage, and a blue sleeve with the White Tree of Gondor. The Lee painting is of the Grey Havens. The Collector's Edition included a model of Minas Tirith, with Minas Morgul available for order during a limited time.
The Special Extended DVD Editions also had in-sleeve maps of the Fellowship's travels. They have also played at [[movie theaters]], most notably for a [[December 16]] [[2003]] marathon screening culminating in a midnight screening of the third film.

On [[August 28]] [[2006]] both versions were put together in a Limited Edition "[[Seamless branching|branching]]" version plus a new feature-length documentary by [[Costa Botes]]. The complete trilogy was released in a six Disc set on November 14th, 2006.

==Public and critical response==
The ''Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy <ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20050125/ai_n11009603 ''Remaking ''King Kong'' an honor for Jackson''] by John Horn, last retrieved on [[5 August]] [[2006]]</ref> is verified to be the currently highest grossing motion picture trilogy worldwide of all time, besting such other film franchises as the [[Star Wars trilogy|''Star Wars'' original trilogy]] and [[The Godfather]]. The film trilogy also tied a record for the total number of [[Academy Awards]] won. 

The majority of critics have also praised the trilogy, with [[Kenneth Turan]] of the [[Los Angeles Times]] writing that "''the trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal''".<ref>[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan16dec16,2,3219427.htmlstory?coll=cl-mreview ''Return of the King'' review at CalendarLive.com] by [[Kenneth Turan]], last retrieved on [[5 August]] [[2006]]</ref> In particular, performances from [[Ian McKellen]],<ref> http://www.imdb.com/poll/results/2001-12-03 </ref> [[Sean Astin]],<ref> http://www.imdb.com/poll/results/2004-02-04 </ref> [[Sean Bean]], [[Andy Serkis]] and [[Bernard Hill]] stood out for many in audience polls, and special effects for the battles and Gollum were praised. A few critics such as [[Roger Ebert]] of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] did not rank the trilogy so highly, and while praising the special effects, Ebert was critical of the story, regarding it as "silly to carry the emotional weight" <ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031217/REVIEWS/312170301/1023 Review of ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' from http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/]</ref>, and as such none of the films appeared in his "Top 10" lists for their respective years<ref>http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041215/COMMENTARY/41215001/1023</ref>. Some were also critical of the films' pacing and length, "It's a collection of spectacular set pieces without any sense of momentum driving them into one another" according to the Philadelphia Weekly.<ref>[http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=1339 ''Ringing Hollow''] by Sean Burns, last retrieved on [[28 January]] [[2007]]</ref> Overall however, the films received a positive 93% critics rating on [[rottentomatoes.com]], (93% for FotR and RotK, 97% for TTT) a consensus amongst film critics.

The trilogy appears in many "Top 10" film lists, such as the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association's Top 10 Films]], Time Magazine's All-Time 100 Movies, [[James Berardinelli]]'s Top 100,<ref>{{cite web|author=James Berardinelli|title=Berardinelli's All-Time Top 100|publisher=Reelviews|url=http://www.reelviews.net/top100/toc.html|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> and The Screen Directory's "Top Ten Films of All Time" (considering the trilogy as "one epic film split into three parts").<ref>[http://www.thescreendirectory.com/cat4/top_tens.php?c=60 Top Ten Films of All Time] accessed [[February 10]] [[2007]]</ref>. In 2007, ''[[USA Today]]'' named the trilogy as the most important films of the past 25 years.<ref>{{cite news | title = Hollywood highlights: 25 movies with real impact | publisher = [[USA Today]] | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/top25-movies.htm?csp=34 | date = [[2007-07-02]] | author = Susan Wloszczyna | accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref>

===Comparison of worldwide box office figures===
The following movies were all released within a few years of each other: 
*''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy: $2.916 billion
*[[Pirates of the Caribbean films| ''Pirates of the Caribbean'']] trilogy (as of December 4, 2007): $2.79 billion

===Academy Awards===
The three films together were nominated for a total of 30 [[Academy Awards]], of which they won 17, a record for any movie trilogy. On its own, ''The Return of the King'' tied the previous record of eleven academy awards and won in every category in which it was nominated, an extremely rare feat. ''The Return of the King'' also tied a record for the total number of [[Academy Awards]] won, 11, with [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|''Ben-Hur'']] and [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']]. Although the three films failed to win any acting awards from the Academy, [[Ian McKellen]] earned the series its sole Academy acting nomination for the 2001 release of ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.

As well as Academy Awards, each film of the trilogy scored [[MTV Movie Awards]]' Best Film, and the [[Hugo Awards]] for Best Dramatic Presentation categories. The first and third films also won the Best Film [[BAFTA]]s. It must also be noted that the soundtrack for ''The Two Towers'' did not receive a nomination because of the rule prohibiting a soundtrack including music from a previous soundtrack to be eligible for nomination. This rule was overturned in time for ''The Return of the King'' to receive the Oscar for Best Music Score.

===Reactions to changes in the movies from the book===
{{seealso|List of original characters in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy}}
While the films were generally well received, some readers of the book decried certain changes made in the adaptation, including changes in tone and themes;<ref name = "croft">Croft, Janet B.

Hammond]], a noted [[Tolkien research|Tolkien scholar]], has said of the first two films: 

{{cquote|"''I find both of the Jackson films to be travesties as adaptations... faithful only on a basic level of plot... Cut and compress as necessary, yes, but don't change or add new material without very good reason... In the moments in which the films succeed, they do so by staying close to what Tolkien so carefully wrote; where they fail, it tends to be where they diverge from him, most seriously in the area of characterization. Most of the characters in the films are mere shadows of those in the book, weak and diminished (notably Frodo) or insulting caricatures (Pippin, Merry, and Gimli)... [T]he filmmakers sacrifice the richness of Tolkien's story and characters, not to mention common sense, for violence, cheap humor, and cheaper thrills... [S]o many of its reviewers have praised it as faithful to the book, or even superior to it, all of which adds insult to injury and is demonstrably wrong...''"<ref name= "croft" /><ref name= "kirst">Kirst, Sean.

Some fans of the book who disagreed with such changes have released their [[fan edit]]s of the films, which removed many of the changes to bring them closer to the original. The theatrical version of ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' has received this treatment, and a combined 8-hour version of the trilogy exists, called "The Lord of the Rings: The Purist Edition".<ref name = "cimmerian">{{cite web | title = Tolkien Purists Strike Back! | author = Leo Grin | url = http://www.thecimmerian.com/?p=739 | accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = The Lord of the Rings: the purist edition | url = http://fanedit.org/true_fanedits/3ditor_lotr/3ditor_lotr.html | accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref>
  
Supporters of the film trilogy assert that it is a worthy interpretation of the book, most changes stemming from the filmmakers putting the book into a modern context; connected to this is their perceived need for developing characters further.<ref> http://www.angelfire.com/film/rings/essays/changes.html</ref> It is important to note that many who worked on the trilogy are fans of the book, including <!-- any others besides... -->[[Christopher Lee]], who alone among the cast had actually met Tolkien in person,<ref>"Biography for Christopher Lee." [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000489/bio http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000489/bio]</ref> and Boyens once noted that no matter what, it is simply their interpretation of the book. Jackson once said that to simply summarise the story on screen would be a mess, and in his own words, "''Sure, it's not really The Lord of the Rings... but it could still be a pretty damn cool movie.''"<ref>[http://members.tripod.com/peter_jackson_online/lotr/articles/20_questions.htm 20 Questions with Peter Jackson. Last retrieved [[16 September]] [[2006]]]</ref><ref> http://www.theonering.com/landing_pages/25,3.html </ref> Other fans also claim that, despite any changes, the changes do not matter within the context of stand-alone films, and nonetheless that they serve as a tribute to the book, appealing to those who have not yet read it, and even leading some to do so. The Movie Guide for The Encyclopedia of [[Arda]] (an online Tolkien encyclopedia) states:

{{cquote|"''It seems appropriate to end with a word of acknowledgement of Peter Jackson and everyone else associated with the movie version of The Lord of the Rings. Though of course they haven't come close to the scope and intricacy of the original story &mdash; that would be quite impossible &mdash; what they have produced is still nothing less than a masterpiece. The film-makers, and of course Peter Jackson in particular, have to be admired merely for having the courage to take on such an immense challenge, let alone to produce such an exceptional result. The complete story of The Lord of the Rings is probably unfilmable, but Peter Jackson has come closer than anyone could have imagined possible.''"<ref> http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/ </ref>}}<!--Some fans of the book were critical of the way New Line Cinema has "franchised" the series. In particular, [[Electronic Arts]] has produced videogames which stray from Tolkien's storylines in varying degrees.-->

===Three films or one?===
Because the films were shot together and then edited into three separate films released theatrically over a span of three successive years, a significant number of fans and critics have come to regard the trilogy as a single film.{{ME-fact|date=October 2007}} They argue that as with the book, which was meant to be a single novel but was first released in three parts for marketing and budget reasons (leading to the common but erroneous label of "trilogy"), Jackson's trilogy is one long 10-hour film.{{ME-fact|date=October 2007}} When [[Time magazine]] placed the trilogy in its [[Time magazine top 100|top 100 list]] it was done under a single heading. While this grouping into a single entity is debated it is not unusual as [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]]'s ''[[The Decalogue]]'' was originally released as ten separate short films with intersecting themes and characters but now is regarded by the majority of critics as a single work. [[Satyajit Ray]]'s ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'' is also grouped together quite often. Recently, when coming top of an Australian film poll, the trilogy was regarded as one.<ref> http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200512/s1523327.htm </ref>

===Legacy===
The release of the films saw a surge of interest in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and Tolkien's other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture.<ref name = "surge">{{cite web|author=Gilsdorf, Ethan|year = [[November 16]], [[2003]]|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2003/11/16/lord_of_the_gold_ring/| title=Lord of the Gold Ring|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2006-06-16}}</ref> For example, in 2003, the BBC conducted a poll to find the U.K.'s favourite book, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' won, at the height of anticipation for the third film.<ref> http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3317081.stm </ref> Despite higher sales, it was rumoured that the Tolkien family became split on the trilogy, with [[Christopher Tolkien]] and [[Simon Tolkien]] feuding over whether or not it was a good idea to adapt.<ref> http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=594&ObjectID=231286 </ref> Christopher Tolkien has since denied these claims saying, "My own position is that ''The Lord Of The Rings'' is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form. The suggestions that have been made that I 'disapprove' of the films, vent to the extent of thinking ill of those with whom I may differ, are wholly without foundation." He added that he had never "expressed any such feeling".<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1697884.stm</ref> Capitalizing on the trilogy's success, a [[The Lord of the Rings (musical)#Toronto production|musical adaptation]] of the book was launched in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], in 2006, but it closed after mostly poor reviews. A [[The Lord of the Rings (musical)#London production|shortened version]] opened in [[London]], [[UK]], in the summer of 2007. The success of the films has also spawned the production of video games and many other kinds of merchandise.

Jackson has become his own mogul like [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]], and has befriended some industry heavyweights like [[Bryan Singer]], [[Frank Darabont]] and [[James Cameron]]. He founded his own film production company [[Wingnut Films]], and [[Wingnut Interactive]], a video game company. He was also finally given a chance to remake ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' in 2005; although it was not as successful, it nevertheless still received critical acclaim. On a personal level, he found it hard to leave the trilogy and still keeps the Bag End set (as a guest house) and Rivendell miniatures.<ref>http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,1538494_1_0_,00.html </ref> He has also become a "favourite son" of New Zealand.<ref> http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=594&ObjectID=584301 </ref> Howard Shore also found leaving difficult, and in 2004 toured with ''The Lord of the Rings Symphony'', consisting of two hours of the score. Alongside the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films, the trilogy has also renewed interest in the fantasy film genre. Around the same time, fellow New Zealand director [[Andrew Adamson]] began [[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|''The Chronicles of Narnia'' film series]], credited by many to be stylistically influenced by ''The Lord of the Rings'',{{ME-fact|date=October 2007}} being also shot in [[New Zealand]] and having art direction from Weta Workshop, as well as its own extended edition.

[[Motion capture]] was used for characters in ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]''. ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' is one of many epics to use the [[Massive (software)|MASSIVE]] technology. In non-filmic terms, tourism for [[New Zealand]] is up, possibly due to its exposure in the trilogy,<ref> http://www.theculturedtraveler.com/Archives/AUG2005/Movies_New_Zeland.htm </ref> with the tourism industry in the country waking up to an audience's familiarity.<ref> http://www.newzealand.com/travel/about-nz/culture/lotr/nz-home-of-middle-earth-feature.cfm </ref>

In December 2002, [[The Lord of the Rings Motion Picture Trilogy: The Exhibition]] opened at the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Te Papa museum]] in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]. [[As of 2007]], the exhibition has travelled to seven other cities around the world.

[[Peter Jackson]] and [[Fran Walsh]] expressed interest in 1995 in filming ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which would be part one of a trilogy, and therefore lead on to making two films based on ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Brian Sibley]] | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher = HarperCollins | date = 2006 | location = London | pages = 313-16 | id = ISBN 0-00-717558-2}}</ref> Frustration arose when Jackson's producer, [[Harvey Weinstein]], discovered [[Saul Zaentz]] had production rights to ''The Hobbit'', but distribution rights still belonged to [[United Artists]].

On [[December 18]] [[2007]], it was announced that Jackson would be [[executive producer]] of ''The Hobbit'' and its sequel: Jackson is busy with ''[[The Lovely Bones (film)|The Lovely Bones]]'' and ''[[Tintin (film)|Tintin]]''. Back-to-back shooting on these films will begin in 2009, and each film will be released in December 2010 and December 2011 respectively. NL and MGM will co-finance the film, and the latter studio will distribute the films outside North America &mdash; NL's first ever such deal with another major studio. Shooting will again take place in [[New Zealand]], and [[Weta Workshop]] and [[Weta Digital]] are expected to offer their services once more.<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | title = 'Hobbit' back on track as twin bill | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[2007-12-18]] | url = http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071218/ap_en_ot/film_the_hobbit | accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref> The set for [[Bag End]] and the miniatures for [[Rivendell]] were kept after production of the trilogy.<ref name=action>{{cite news | author = Steve Daly | title = Action Jackson | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[2006-09-22]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1538494,00.html | accessdate=2007-10-05}}</ref> 

It was MGM who expressed interest in another prequel film, set between ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{cite news | title = Hobbit, Crown, Panther News | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2006-11-14]] | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/746/746019p1.html | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> Jackson concurred, stating "one of the drawbacks of ''The Hobbit'' is [that] it's relatively lightweight compared to LOTR... There...[are] a lot of sections in which a character like [[Gandalf]] disappears for a while. From memory — I mean, I haven't read it for a while now — but I think he references going off to meet with the [[White Council]], who are actually characters like [[Galadriel]] and [[Saruman]] and people that we see in ''Lord of the Rings''. He mysteriously vanishes for a while and then comes back, but we don't really know what goes on."<ref name=action/>

[[Sam Raimi]] had expressed interest in directing ''The Hobbit'' under Jackson,<ref name=peace/> while [[Guillermo del Toro]] also said "it would be a privilege" to direct, having met Jackson.<ref>{{cite news | author = Missy Schwartz | title = Guillermo del Toro addresses rumors about his directing 'The Hobbit' | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[2007-12-19]] | url = http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2007/12/will-guillermo.html | accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> MGM CEO Harry Sloan said, "Neither us nor New Line would want to hire a director that Peter was not completely comfortable with." He also mentioned Jackson and [[Fran Walsh]] would co-operate on the scripts, and that Jackson may direct the second prequel as he would have completed ''Tintin''.<ref>{{cite news | author = Vanessa Juarez | title = MGM CEO Harry Sloan talks 'Hobbit' | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[2007-12-18]] | url = http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2007/12/mgm-ceo-on-the.html | accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> The actors [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Viggo Mortensen]] and [[Cate Blanchett]] had said they would reprise their roles as [[Legolas]], [[Aragorn]] and Galadriel respectively with Jackson,<ref>{{cite news | author = Shawn Adler | title = Orlando Bloom Iffy On ‘Hobbit’ Role Unless Peter Jackson Returns | publisher = [[MTV]] | date = [[2007-05-17]] | url = http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/05/17/orlando-bloom-iffy-on-hobbit-role-unless-peter-jackson-returns/ | accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Shawn Adler | title = Will Aragorn Return In ‘The Hobbit’?
