'''Sir Charles Fox''' ([[11 March]] [[1810]] – [[14 June]] [[1874]]) was an [[England|English]] [[civil engineer]] and [[contractor]]. His work focused on railways, railway stations and bridges.

==Biography==
Born in [[Derby]] in 1810, he was the youngest of four sons of [[Francis Fox (Doctor)|Francis Fox, MD]]. Initially trained to follow his father's career, he abandoned medical training at the age of 19 and became [[articled]] to [[John Ericsson]] of [[Liverpool]], working with him and [[J. Braithwaite]] on the ''[[Novelty (locomotive)|Novelty]]'' locomotive, and drove it in the [[Rainhill trials]] on the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

He acquired a taste for locomotive driving, and was employed on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, being present at its opening.

In [[1830]] Fox married Mary, second daughter of [[Joseph Brookhouse]], by whom he had 3 sons and a daughter.

One of his earliest inventions, patented in [[1832]], was the [[Railroad switch|railway switch]] (''points'' in the UK), which superseded the sliding rail used up to that time.

In [[1837]] [[Robert Stephenson]] appointed him as one of the engineers on the [[London and Birmingham Railway]], where he was responsible for Watford tunnel and the incline down from [[Camden Town]] to [[Euston]]. He presented an important paper on the correct principles of [[skew arches]] to the Royal Institution. In 1837 [[Herbert Spencer]], whose father George Spencer had been Fox's tutor when young, joined him  as an assistant engineer.

Fox then entered into partnership with the contractor [[Joseph Bramah]] to form the company Bramah, Fox and Co., which when Bramah retired became Fox, Henderson and Co., of  [[London]], [[Smethwick]], and [[Renfrew]]. The company specialised in railway equipment, including wheels, bridges, roofs, cranes, tanks and [[permanent way]] materials. It also experimented with components for suspension and girder bridges, with Fox reading a paper before the [[Royal Society]] in [[1865]].

The company was responsible for many important station roofs including Liverpool Tithebarn Street, (1849–50), [[Bradford Exchange]] (1850), [[Paddington]] and [[Birmingham New Street]].

Fox and Henderson's expertise with structural ironwork led [[Joseph Paxton]] to invite them to build [[The Crystal Palace]] for [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851. Due to its innovative modular design and construction techniques, it was ready in nine months. For their work, Fox, Cubitt and Paxton were [[knight]]ed on [[22 October]] [[1851]]. After the exhibition they were employed by the Crystal Palace Company to move the structure to [[Sydenham]], re-erecting and enlarging it on Sydenham Hill, thereafter known as [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]].

In [[1857]] he left the company to practise as a civil and consulting engineer with two of his sons, Charles and [[Francis Fox (engineer)|Francis]], and in [[1860]] formed a partnership with his two sons, the firm being known as [[Sir Charles Fox and Sons]].

Their engineering work included the [[Medway]] bridge at [[Rochester]], three bridges over the [[Thames]], a swing bridge across the [[Shannon]] in Ireland, a bridge over the [[Saône]] at [[Lyon]] and many bridges on the [[Great Western Railway]]. Railways upon which Fox worked included the [[Cork and Bandon]], [[Thames and Medway]], [[Portadown and Dungannon]], [[East Kent Railway|East Kent]], [[Lyons and Geneva Railway|Lyons and Geneva]], [[Macon and Geneva Railway|Macon and Geneva]] and the [[Wiesbaden and Zealand]] lines in [[Denmark]]. Fox was also engineer to the [[Queensland, Cape Town and Wynberg Railway]] and the [[Toronto]] [[narrow gauge]] lines.

Fox became an expert in [[narrow-gauge]] railways and in conjunction with [[G. Berkley]] he constructed the first narrow-gauge line in [[India]], and later constructed narrow-gauge lines in other parts of the world.

Fox and Sons engineered the complex scheme of bridges and high-level lines at [[Battersea]] for the [[London Brighton and South Coast Railway]], [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] and [[London and South Western Railway]] and the approach to [[Victoria Station]], London, including widening the bridge over the Thames.

Fox was also a member of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]]  from 1838 until his death, a founder member of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] from 1856 to 1871 and a fellow of the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] and [[Royal Geographical Society]].

Sir Charles Fox died at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] on [[14 June]] [[1874]], at the age of sixty-four.
