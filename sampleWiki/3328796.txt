==Music videos==

===U Can't Touch===

===Jingle Bells===

In some clips, his genitals are censored.

The video starts with the Frog playing in the snow with the bounty hunter robot from previous clips. It then shows flashbacks from clips of [[Axel F (Crazy Frog Song)|Axel F]], a trip to a carnival, and the Crazy DJ clip, then more of the Axel F clip. The flashbacks end, and the bounty hunter robot begins to throw a snowball at the frog. But instead he kisses the bounty hunter robot, and his lips get stuck to him, until the robot pulls him off. They then make snow angels and a message reads "Have a ding dong Christmas, everyone!"
