__TOC__
==History==

=== Early days ===
The MUD was started in the summer of 1991 as an [[LPMUD]] called ''[[#Change of Name|Farside MUD]]''.<ref name="MizukoIto1"/> It was initially [[hosting|hosted]] on the [[Server (computing)|servers]] of [[Newcastle University]] by three Ph.D. computer science candidates. It later moved to [[Swansea University]]<ref name="MizukoIto1"/> until they announced a ban on mudding<ref>{{cite book|last=Mizuko|first=Ito|title=Cybernetic Fantasies: Extended Selfhood in a Virtual Community|url=http://www.itofisher.com/PEOPLE/mito/papers/cyberfantasies.html|authorlink=Mizuko Ito|accessdate=12 February 2014|quote=Soon after, the university that Farside was residing at announced a ban on mudding.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mizuko|first=Ito|title=Cybernetic Fantasies: Extended Selfhood in a Virtual Community|url=http://www.itofisher.com/PEOPLE/mito/papers/cyberfantasies.html|authorlink=Mizuko Ito|accessdate=12 February 2014|quote=Muds are anathema to many universities because they take up valuable space on computers, slow down network responsiveness, and tie up terminals in computer labs. They have been banned at various universities across the country, yet they continue to proliferate.}}</ref>, before crossing the Atlantic to take up residence on a couple of machines in the United States of America.<ref name "MizukoIto2"/> 

=== The switch from LPMUD to Merc 2.2 ===
Catastrophic loss of data in August, 1994,<ref name="mizuko-ito1" /> presented the implementors with an opportunity to switch to the Merc code base.

Farside MUD was created during the summer of 1991 with the established LPMUD codebase, released two years prior.  The original [[DikuMUD]] [[codebase|code base]] was released just a few months before Farside's creation on the 1st of March, 1991, and had yet to become popular at that time.

DikuMUD was quickly followed by the creation of [[Copper (MUD)|CopperMUD]] in June, 1991.  In December 1991, CopperMUD released its source code, leading to the creation of [[Merc (MUD)|MercMUD]] on December 18th, 1992.  The final Merc codebase (version 2.2) was released on the 24th of November, 1993, and this newer codebase was chosen by Farside MUD the following year due to the gameplay similarities with LPMUD.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ito|first=Mizuko|title=Cybernetic Fantasies: Extended Selfhood in a Virtual Community|url=http://all.net/journal/deception/Framework/ito1.html|authorlink=Mizuko Ito|accessdate=12 February 2014|quote=Diku-MUds, Aber-MUDS and LP-MUDs usually involve armor, weapons, gold coins and the killing of ogres, giants, and sometimes other players. In contrast, MOOs, MUSEs, and Tiny MUDs are primarily social, often have a space-age theme, and have little in terms of the adventure game component.}}</ref>

===Change of Name===
<!-- This article's header links here! -->
On the 8th of August, 1995, after disagreements between the implementors, Farside MUD became A.V.A.T.A.R. MUD.   The MUD's newsletter, published two days later, states:

<blockquote><poem>All of the players pfiles have remained intact, as have all of the areas.''
All of your favorite Immortals and Heroes are still there.''
Only the Implementor has changed, and the name.<ref name="name change article"/><ref>https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.mud.lp/z0rp371pbZ0 Even the port number (3000) remained unchanged.</ref></poem></blockquote>

Although the implementors of A.V.A.T.A.R. MUD<ref>https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topicsearchin/rec.games.mud.misc/after$3A1995$2F05$2F01$20before$3A1995$2F05$2F31/rec.games.mud.misc/OFfqJPF9LmA Rec.Games.Mud.Misc post from the 19th of May, 1995, identifying Snikt as Daemon of Farside, prior to the name change later that year.</ref> retained the right to use the "Farside MUD" name, the new name reflected the change in leadership and avoided the possibility of being sued<ref>http://www.portmann.com/farside/index.html?home.html Gary Larson's cease and desist letter.</ref> by the [[The Far Side]] comic strip's [[Gary Larson|creator]].  The new name is an acronym which stands for "Advanced Virtual Adventures Through Artificial Realities"<ref>{{cite web|last=Kariya|title=AVATAR Focus|url=http://www.outland.org/infusions/adv_articles/adv_articles.php?art_id=276|work=The AVATAR Gazette|accessdate=12 February 2014|quote=Or, as it is officially known, "Advanced Virtual Adventures Through Artificial Realities."}}</ref>  and was inspired by the computing term [[avatar (computing)|Avatar]].

==Development==
Over the 22 years (as of 2014) that the MUD has been running, the Merc 2.2 code base has been extensively updated and modified.

===Game Tiers===
A.V.A.T.A.R.'s tiered level system is an original [[Game design|design feature]].<ref name="mudbytes2">http://www.mudbytes.net/file-2602 Merc / Rom? 2000 Sublevels</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tiers|url=http://www.outland.org/infusions/wiclear/index.php?title=Tiers|accessdate=6 April 2014|author=Pulse}}</ref>   The original 35 game levels of the Merc codebase, extended to 50 levels, now form the lowest playable tier of the game, referred to as "Mortal."  A hero tier was added in 1994, followed by two other higher tiers; Lord and Legend (team-based player-versus-player) in June, 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game History|url=http://avatar.melanarchy.info/index.php/Game_History|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Archived listing from 1997|url=http://banich.public.iastate.edu/GMud/mudlist.doc|work=This file was included in the 9-Jun-97 release of version 4.62 of the ZMUD client|accessdate=11 April 2014|year=8th of June, 1997|quote="Morphing allows evolution through 999 Hero, Lord, Legend and Titan Levels"}}</ref><ref name="kelly" />  Prior to the tier system, the MUD had a simple level progression from 1-1000.<ref>{{cite web|title=MUD listing from 1995|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.mud.lp/z0rp371pbZ0|accessdate=11 April 2014|quote="Farside is a fast paced merc mud with 1000 levels of play."}}</ref>

===Classes and Races===
[[Player character|Characters]] possess gender, race, and class.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ito|first=Mizuko|title=Extensions of Selfhood In a Multi-User Dungeon|accessdate=11 April 2014|authorlink=Mizuko Ito|archiveurl=http://www.itofisher.com/PEOPLE/mito/papers/cyberfantasies.html|date=December 3, 1994|quote="When first creating a permanent character, you are asked to choose a character name, a gender (usually male or female), and a race (such as elf, dwarf, human etc.), and begin playing as a first level player. Your character has certain attributes and assets that improve as you accumulate more treasure and kill monsters and other players, and solve quests on the mud."}}</ref><ref name="kelly" /> The mud has 28 creatable races (of which two are 'evolutionary' - containing 14 sub-races), nine quest races (elemental giants and chromatic dragons, added mid-2013), ten '[[Experience point#Remorting|remort]]' (second playthrough) races, and two 'ascension' (pvp legend tier specific) races.  All together, players currently have access to 61 races, not counting [[Grandfather clause|grandfather]]ed races or races only available to [[non-player character]]s and staff members.

The game has seven creatable classes, nine 'prestige' (quest accessible) classes, and five powerful 'remort' classes, for a total of twenty-one classes, not counting grandfathered classes or classes only available to NPCs and staff members.

===Area Building===
Though the Merc [[Codebase|MUD codebase]]s usually come with a set of [[Merc (MUD)#List of Stock Areas|52 stock areas]], all of A.V.A.T.A.R.'s areas are non-stock. Some areas retain the theme of the stock areas they replaced.<ref name="avareas" />  The MUD continues to grow, with 327 areas online as of January, 2014.  In addition to these permanent additions, temporary areas and quests are regularly added to the MUD, and older, less-visited areas are either revamped or removed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ito|first=Mimi|title=Cybernetic Fantasies: Extended Selfhood in a Virtual Community|url=http://all.net/journal/deception/Framework/ito1.html|authorlink=Mizuko Ito|accessdate=12 February 2014|quote=Farside is continuosly evolving; new towns and lands suddenly manifest, and outdated spaces disappear without a trace. The world is in a perpetual state of magical flux. In the space of a few weeks absence from the system, I found that a new combat system had been implemented, a new "Gotham City" environment was added, in addition to a "Newbie Forest."}}</ref><ref name="kelly" />

===Development staff===
The coders of the MUD are members of its [[Wizard (MUD)|Immortal staff]], formed from dedicated volunteers who largely forego playing the game in order to devote their time its maintenance and development.<ref name"ItoCC">http://www.itofisher.com/PEOPLE/mito/papers/Ito.4S94.pdf [[Mizuko Ito]], "Cyborg Couplings In a Multi-User Dungeon", 1994 Annual Meetings of the Society for the Social Study of Science, October 13th, 1994</ref>  "Trackies" form a second tier of staff which is split into seven tracks (Builder, Design, Publicity, Quest, Retro, Tester, Web).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Staff Teams of Avatar|url=https://www.outland.org/infusions/staff_info/staff_list.php|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>

=== Influence on Other MUDs ===
As Farside MUD, it donated [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] space to a 1993 inter-MUD project to produce an area editor called "Make.Zones.Fast".<ref>http://www.snible.org/mud/credmzf.htm Farside MUD for providing space on their FTP server for MZF and MZF source. 11/11/1993</ref> Design features and code from A.V.A.T.A.R. has been borrowed by other MUDs.  Examples of code featuring copied or imitative code which credit A.V.A.T.A.R. can be found on repositories like [http://www.mudbytes.net MUDBytes.net].<ref>http://www.mudbytes.net/file-2601 Merc / Rom? Spell Surging (Mage)</ref><ref name="mudbytes2" /><ref>http://www.mudbytes.net/file-850 Monk Class Base Code</ref>

==Features==
===Free to Play===
A.V.A.T.A.R. is a 100% [[free-to-play]] game.  Unlike [[freemium]] games, there is no system to pay for additional benefits.

The license for Diku codebase states:

<blockquote>You may under no circumstances make profit on '''*ANY*''' part of DikuMud in any possible way. You may under no circumstances charge money for distributing any part of dikumud - this includes the usual $5 charge for "sending the disk" or "just for the disk" etc.</blockquote>

Thus the game is developed and run entirely by a large staff of volunteers.<ref>http://www.outland.org/infusions/imm_info/imm_list.php List of volunteers</ref><ref>http://www.outland.org/infusions/staff_info/staff_list.php List of volunteers</ref>

===Multi-Platform===
[[File:Three different devices connected to a MUD via different Telnet Clients.JPG|left|thumb|A smartphone, laptop and desktop system connected to AVATAR MUD using different clients.  A player-created wiki can also be seen on two of the screens.]] The game can be played on various devices (such as [[smart phone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]]) and [[operating system]]s.  A connection to the game server can be established by:
* Opening a [[web browser]] window on any [[Internet access|internet-connected]] computer and using the built-in client application on the official website<ref>http://www.outland.org/infusions/mudclient</ref> or Facebook.<ref>https://apps.facebook.com/avatarmud</ref>

Epperson, Sociology Honors Thesis for Rice University Sociology Department ''To ease and organize a user's interactions with a MUD, there are many "client" programs to receive the information from the MUD. Rather than simply displaying this continuous flood of information sequentially on your screen, the client organizes your screen into areas with different sorts of information on different portions of your screen, so that the user can find information more quickly.''</ref> or [[Telnet#Telnet_clients|TELNET client]] software for a computer, or an [[Android]] or [[iOS]] MUD client [[mobile app]] for a [[smartphone]] or [[tablet computer]]

As all [[saved game|game data]] is stored on the [[server (computing)|server]], players can switch devices.

===Fantasy Setting===
A.V.A.T.A.R. is set in a fantasy world, which occasionally incorporates elements from other [[genre fiction|fictional genres]], such as [[steampunk]].  Combat is primarily conducted through [[melee]], [[martial arts]], and [[spells]], alongside [[throwing|thrown weapons]] and [[archery]].  Most transportation is achieved by "walking" (following [[cardinal direction|directions]] to an adjacent room), though there are other options including [[ferry#foot ferry|foot ferries]], [[guide]]s, [[Teleportation in fiction|transportation spells]], [[Parallel universe (fiction)#Fantasy multiverses|planar]] travel. and [[Portals in fiction|permanent portals]].  The theme is further reinforced through the use of [[ASCII art]].<ref>http://nimud.divineright.org/webmudlister/digest.php 2010 Log in screen gallery showing one of A.V.A.T.A.R.'s entry banners</ref>

===Parental controls===
Due to the presence of younger players, the MUD has a strict language [[policy]] which is enforced through [[server log|automatic logging]] of [[profanity|bad language]] and monitoring by staff members.  In addition to this, players may select the option to [[censorship|censor]] common vulgar words appearing in communications from other players.

===Accessibility===
As a text-based game, it is used by the [[blindness|blind]] and [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] with the assistance of [[screen reader|screen reading software]], and also the [[deafness|hearing impaired]] who are not disadvantaged due to the absence of [[Sensory cue#Auditory Cues|auditory cues]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hindman|first=Beau|title=Free for All: Introduction to MUD May|url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2013/05/01/free-for-all-introduction-to-mud-may/|publisher=http://www.joystiq.com|accessdate=12 February 2014|authorlink=http://massively.joystiq.com/editor/beau-hindman|date=May 1st 2013 8:00PM|quote=MUDs are also friendly to disabled players, something that has concerned me for a long time. There are even blind players in many MUDs, players who use tools that read text out loud and respond to voice commands. Imagine if you could listen to your favorite audiobook and give it commands. That's the beauty of MUDs. These games are also good for people with colorblind issues, mobility issues or for people who cannot afford gaming PCs.}}</ref> 

Playing with a screen reader can also help those with low [[Illiteracy|literacy]] or [[learning disability|learning disabilties]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Samaranayaka|first=Chamali|title=Public endorsement|url=http://www.browsealoud.com/page.asp?pg_id=80028|accessdate=12 February 2014|quote=Here at the British Council, we have provided Browsealoud, a speech tool that reads aloud the contents of each page. This service helps users with low literacy and reading skills, where English is not the first language, dyslexic and with users who are mild visually impaired.  Our audience (mainly from overseas, with English as the second language) will benefit hugely from this service.}}</ref> to enjoy the game whilst helping them improve their [[literacy|language skills]], [[computer literacy]] and [[social skills]].

Some MUD clients include customisable [[user interface]]s, such as defineable buttons or rollers, which can largely remove the need to manually type commands, which is very helpful for those whose ability to operate a keyboard is impaired.  [[Computer accessibility]] issues can then be overcome with [[assistive technology|assistive technologies]], such as a [[footmouse]].

==Gameplay==
The game is open to anyone<ref>{{cite web|last=Ito|first=Mizuko|title=Extensions of Selfhood In a Multi-User Dungeon|url=http://www.itofisher.com/PEOPLE/mito/papers/cyberfantasies.html|accessdate=12 April 2014|authorlink=Mizuko Ito|date=December 3, 1994|quote="Connectivity to the mud server is enabled by the Internet, and for the particular mud that I have been following, access is open for anyone that has telnet capabilities on the net."}}</ref> and permits multiple connections from the same [[IP address]] (as long as each active [[Alternate character|character]] is controlled by a separate player).<ref>{{cite book|last=Ito|first=Mizuko|title=Internet Culture|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=New York & London|pages=87-110|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xUDcAAAAQBAJ&dq=%22Internet+Culture%22+porter+etext|author=Ito Mizuko, et al|authorlink=Mizuko Ito|editor=D. Porter|accessdate=12 April 2014|chapter=Virtually Embodied: The Reality of Fantasy in a Multi-User Dungeon|quote="What is restricted, however, is the number of characters that one can run concurrently on a particular combat MUD. Otherwise, a number of virtual characters connected with a particular biological body could collectively gain unfair advantage, ganging to attack a monster or another player. Disposable adjunct characters could die sacrificial deaths in order to consolidate experience points and treasure in a single primary character, creating a monstrous collective organism that defies socially acceptable subject boundaries. In other words, most combat MUDs require characters of a single physically located self to be either spatially or temporally distanced each other."}}</ref>

New characters begin in the "Mudschool" area, which teaches the basic commands, game mechanics and rules of the game.<ref name="kelly />
[[Roleplay]] on A.V.A.T.A.R. is encouraged but not enforced, so much of a player's activity involves finding [[mobs]] (non-player characters) to perform [[Quest_(video_gaming)|quests]] for, slay for [[experience point]]s, or somehow acquire [[looting|desireable items]] from, and [[exploration]] in order to enjoy the writing and story of an [[Level (video gaming)|area]] or discover [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] and other secrets.<ref name="kelly" />  As a [[social space]], the game comprises only half of the attraction of the MUD<ref name="kelly" />, with players using various tools such as [[online chat|public and private chat channels]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Epperson|first=Kraettli L.|title=Patterns of Social Behavior In Computer-Mediated Communications|date=1994-12-10|publisher=Rice University Sociology Department|url=http://w2.eff.org/Net_culture/Misc/web_social_behavior.paper|authorlink=http://blackmesaconsulting.com/long-bio-kraettli-l-epperson|accessdate=12 February 2014|quote=A MUD usually includes "channels" for discussion that allow one to talk to other players, either individually or as a group.

As player characters gain experience points, they will increase in [[Level (role-playing games)|level]], slowly rising through the four tiers of the game: Mortal ( 1-50 ), Hero ( 51[1]-51[999] ), Lord ( 125[1]-125[999] ), and Legend ( 250[1]-250[999] ).  At each tier, the style of gameplay changes.<ref name="kelly" />  Players can explore the world solo [[Party (role-playing games)|or in groups]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Epperson|first=Kraettli L.|title=Patterns of Social Behavior In Computer-Mediated Communications|date=1994-12-10|publisher=Rice University Sociology Department|accessdate=12 February 2014|quote=In the MUD, an individual wants to face challenges in a "group" established electronically, so that ones movements are tied to other players who can lend strength at critical times in virtual combat. A leader is established for a group, and all members electronically set their character in the game to automatically follow the movements and actions of the leader, but may leave at any time. Obviously, a leader does not want followers who will leave in the middle of a difficult fight. Battles are initiated with the expectation that the group will be fully present, and with the hope that the collective strength of the group will overcome the creature being attacked.}}</ref>
