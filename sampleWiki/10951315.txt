'''Syrian Americans''' are [[citizen]]s of the [[United States]] of [[Syria]]n [[ancestry]] or [[nationality]]. This ethnic group includes Americans of [[Syria]]n ancestry, Syrian [[first generation immigrant]]s, or descendants of Syrians who [[immigration|immigrated]] to the [[United States]]. It is believed that the first significant number of Syrians to arrive to the United States was in 1880.<ref name=Syr-Amer-Utica>{{cite web | url =http://www.utica.edu/academic/institutes/ethnic/lebanese.cfm | title =Lebanese and Syrian Americans | accessdate =2007-05-06 | publisher =[[Utica College]]}}</ref> Many of the earliest Syrian Americans settled in [[New York]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], and [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. Immigration from Syria to the United States suffered a long hiatus after the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which restricted immigration. More than forty years later, the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration Act of 1965]], abolished the quotas and immigration from Syria to the United States saw a surge. An estimated 64,600 Syrians immigrated to the United States in the period between 1961 and 2000.<ref name=UScensus2>{{cite web | url =http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0008.xls | title =Immigrants, by Country of Birth: 1961 to 2005 | accessdate =2007-04-29 | publisher =[[United States Census]]}}</ref>

Most of the earliest Syrian American immigrants were either [[Christian]] or [[Jew|Jewish]], whereas [[Muslim]] Syrians arrived in the United States chiefly after 1965. According to the [[United States Census, 2000|United States 2000 Census]], there are 142,897 Americans of Syrian ancestry, making up 0.05% of the total population of the United States and 12.01% of the Arab population in the United States.<ref name=UScensus>{{cite web | url =http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-23.pdf | title =The Arab Population: 2000 | accessdate =2007-04-29 | publisher =[[United States Census]]}}</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:Syrian-American-children.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Syrian American children from immigrant families that settled in New York's Syrian Quarter]]
It is believed that the first Syrian immigrants arrived in the United States from [[Greater Syria]] in the 1880s and worked as peddlers, selling linen and other similar types of goods.<ref name=Samovar83>Samovar & Porter (1994), p. 83</ref> Before 1920, the area now known as [[Syria]] was actually part of [[Greater Syria]], an area which included the four modern [[country|countries]] of [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Palestine]], and Syria itself.<ref name=GSyria>{{cite news |last=Pipes|first=Daniels|title=Greater Syria: Another Lion Roars in the Middle East|publisher =Danielpipes.com (''[[The Washington Post]]'')| date =1990-10-21| url =http://www.danielpipes.org/article/196| accessdate =2006-05-21}}</ref> Most immigrants from the region were classified as "Syrian," despite lacking Syrian ethnicity; some were even registered as [[Turkish people|Turks]].<ref name=Samovar83/> As a result, some confusion exists when determining the accurate time periods and numbers of early Syrian immigrants.

Most of the early Syrian immigrants came from [[Christianity|Christian]] villages around [[Mount Lebanon]].<ref name=Naff3>Naff (1993), p. 3</ref> According to [[historian]] Philip Hitti, approximately 90,000 "Syrians" arrived in the United States between 1899 and 1919.<ref name=Hitti>{{cite book |last=Hitti |first=Philip |title=The Syrians in America|year=2005|origyear=1924|publisher=Gorgias Press|isbn=1-59333-176-2}}</ref> An estimated 1,000 official entries per year came from the [[Governorates of Syria|governorate]]s of [[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo]], which are governorates in modern-day Syria, in the period between 1900 and 1916.<ref name=Everyculture>{{cite web | url =http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Sr-Z/Syrian-Americans.html | title =Syrian Americans | accessdate =2007-05-21 | publisher =Everyculture.com}}</ref> Early immigrants settled mainly in [[Eastern United States]], in the cities of [[New York City]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]].

Syrians, like most [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the United States]], were motivated to immigrate to the United States to pursue the [[American Dream]] of economical success.<ref name=Samovar83/> Many Christian Syrians had immigrated to the United States seeking [[religion|religious]] freedom and an escape from [[Ottoman]] conscription, who had ruled Syria before [[World War I]].<ref name=Suleiman1-5>Suleiman (1999), pp. 1-21</ref> Thousands of immigrants returned to Syria after making money in the United States; these immigrants told tales which inspired further waves of immigrants. Many settlers also sent for their relatives.

Although the number of Syrian immigrants was not sizable, the Ottoman government set constraints on emigration in order to maintain its [[populace]] in Greater Syria. The [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which greatly reduced Syrian immigration to the United States.<ref name=McCarus>{{cite book |last=McCarus |first=Ernest |title=The Development of Arab-American Identity|year=1994|publisher=[[University of Michigan]] Press|isbn=047210439X|pages=p. 26}}</ref> However, the quotas were annulled by the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration Act of 1965]], which opened the doors again to Syrian immigrants. 4,600 Syrians immigrated to the United States in the mid-1960s.<ref name=UScensus2/> Due to the Arab-Israeli and religious conflicts in Syria during this period, many Syrians had immigrated to the United States seeking a democratic haven, where they could live in freedom without political suppression.<ref name=Suleiman1-5/> An estimated 64,600 Syrians immigrated to the United States in the period between 1961 and 2000, of which ten percent have been admitted under the refugee acts.<ref name=UScensus2/>

According to the [[United States Census, 2000|United States 2000 Census]], there are 142,897 Americans of Syrian ancestry living in the United States.<ref name=UScensus/> [[New York City]] has the biggest gathering of Syrian Americans in the United States. Other urban areas, including [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa|Cedar Rapids]], and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] have large Syrian populations.<ref name=Everyculture/>

== Assimilation ==
[[Image:Syrian-American-peddler.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Syrian American food [[peddler]]s, such as this one in [[New York City]], were able to conform with American traditions]]

===Pre-1965===
The traditional clothing of the first Syrian immigrants in the United States, along with their occupation as [[peddler]]s, led to some [[xenophobia]]. Dr. A. J. McLaughlin, the United States health officer at Marine Hospital, described Syrians as "parasites in their peddling habits."<ref name=Samovar83/> U.S. authorities claimed that Syrians had no right to naturalize because they were Asian and did not belong to the white race.<ref name=Suleiman1-5/> However, Syrians reacted quickly to assimilate fully into their new [[culture]]. Immigrants [[Anglicization|Anglicized]] their names, adopted the English language and common Christian denominations.<ref name=Samovar84>Samovar & Porter (1994), p. 84</ref> Syrians did not congregate in urban enclaves; many of the immigrants who had worked as peddlers were able to interact with Americans on a daily basis. This helped them to absorb and learn the language and customs of their new homeland. Additionally, military service during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] helped accelerate assimilation. Assimilation of early Syrian immigrants was so successful that it has become difficult to recognize the ancestors of many families which have become completely Americanized.<ref name=Everyculture/>

===Post-1965===
Mostly [[Muslim]], recent arrivals from Syria, however, have faced difficulties in adjusting with their new homeland's customs. Generally, they are not overly desirous of giving up their identity as [[Arab]]s, which might be a result of the bloom in multiculturalism in the United States.<ref name=Samovar84/>

== Religion ==
Although most of the early Syrian immigrants to the United States were [[Christian]], [[Muslim]]s make up most of the Syrian population.<ref name=Everyculture>{{cite web | url =www.everyculture.com/wc/Rwanda-to-Syria/Syrians.html | title =Syrians | accessdate =2007-05-22 | publisher =Everyculture.com}}</ref> Muslim Syrian Americans arrived chiefly after 1965.<ref name=Williams>{{cite book |last=Williams|first=Raymond|title=Christian Pluralism in the United States: The Indian Experience|year=1996|publisher=[[Cambridge University]] Press|isbn=0521570166|pages=p. 11}}</ref> The largest sect in Islam is the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] sect, forming 80% of the Muslim Syrian population.<ref name=Religion-Sunnis>{{cite web | url =http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/islam/countries/bl_SyriaIslamSunni.htm | title =Religion in Syria - Sunni Islam | accessdate =2007-05-22 | publisher =[[About.com]]}}</ref> The second largest sect in Islam in Syria is the [[Alawite]] sect, a religious sect that originated in [[Shia Islam]] but separated from other Shiite Islam groups in the ninth and tenth centuries.<ref name=Religion-Alawi>{{cite web | url =http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/islam/countries/bl_SyriaAlawi.htm | title =Religion in Syria - Alawi Islam | accessdate =2007-05-22 | publisher =[[About.com]]}}</ref> Most, if not all, Alawi Syrians come from the rural areas of [[Latakia Governorate]]. [[Druze]]s form the third largest sect of Islam in Syria, which is a relatively small religious sect. Early Syrian immigrants included Druze peddlers.<ref name=Everyculture/> Muslim Syrian Americans have often found it difficult practicing their religion in the United States; For example, some Muslims, who are required to pray five times a day as part of Muslim rite, argue that there aren't enough mosques in the United States.

Christian Syrian Americans arrived to the United States in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. Most Christian Syrian Americans are [[Eastern Orthodox]].<ref name=Religion-Christian>{{cite web | url =http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/islam/countries/bl_SyriaChristianity.htm | title =Religion in Syria - Christianity | accessdate =2007-05-22 | publisher =[[About.com]]}}</ref> There are also many Catholic Syrian Americans; most branches of [[Catholicism]] are of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern rite]], such as [[Maronite Church|Maronite Catholic]]s, [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholics]], [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholics]], [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syrian Catholic]]s, and [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholic]]s. There are only few minor differences between the different branches of Catholicism; such differences include the language/s church services are conducted, and the belief in [[papal infallibility]]. A few Christian Syrian Americans are [[Protestant]]. The first Syrian American church was founded in [[Brooklyn, New York]] in 1895 by Saint [[Raphael of Brooklyn]].<ref name=Raphael>{{cite web | url =http://www.antiochian.org/saint_raphael | title =St. Raphael of Brooklyn | accessdate =2007-05-22 | publisher =Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America}}</ref> There are currently hundreds of [[Eastern Orthodox church]]es and missions in the United States.<ref name=Everyculture/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.antiochian.org/parishsearch?parishname=&citymetro=&zone=&diocese=&clergy=&Submit3=Find | title =Orthodox Churches (Parishes) | accessdate =2007-05-30 | publisher =The Antiochian Orthodox Church}}</ref> [[Saint Nicholas]] and [[Saint George]] are popular saints for the Orthodox.

[[Syrian Jews]] first immigrated to the United States around 1908 and settled mostly in New York.<ref name=JewsAleppo>{{cite book |last=Zenner|first=Walter|title=A Global Community: The Jews from Aleppo, Syria|year=2000|publisher=[[Wayne State University]] Press|isbn=0814327915|pages=p. 127}}</ref> Initially they lived on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]]; later settlements were in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]] and [[Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)|Ocean Parkway]] in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn]]. The Syrian Jewish community estimates its population at around 50,000.<ref name=Jewishaz>{{cite news| url =http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/041112/syrian.shtml | title =Syrian Jews mark 100 years in U.S. | accessdate =2007-05-20 |author= Kornfeld, Alana B. Elias | publisher =''Jewish News of Greater Phoenix''}}</ref>

== Politics ==
Early Syrian Americans were not involved politically.<ref name=Suleiman1-5/> Business owners were usually [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], meanwhile labor workers were usually [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Second generation Syrian Americans were the first to be elected for political roles. In light of the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], many Syrian Americans tried to affect [[Foreign relations of the United States|American foreign policy]] by joining Arab political groups in the United States.<ref name=Samovar85>Samovar & Porter (1994), p. 85</ref> In the early 1970s, the [[National Association of Arab Americans]] was formed to negate the stereotypes commonly associated with Arabs in [[Media of the United States|American media]].<ref name=Samovar85/> Syrian Americans were also part of the [[Arab American Institute]], established in 1985, which supports and promotes Arab American candidates, or candidates commiserative with Arabs and Arab Americans, for office.<ref name=Suleiman1-5/> [[Mitch Daniels]], the current [[List of Governors of Indiana|Governor of Indiana]], is the son of Syrian immigrants.

== Employment ==
[[Image:Syrian-American-man-selling-drinks.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A young Syrian American sells drinks in the Syrian Quarter in [[New York City]]]]

The majority of the early Syrian immigrants arrived in the United States seeking better jobs; they usually engaged in basic commerce, especially peddling.<ref name=Samovar83/> Syrian American peddlers found their jobs comfortable since peddling required little training and mediocre vocabulary. Syrian American peddlers served as the distribution medium for the products of small manufacturers. Syrian peddlers traded mostly in dry goods, primarily clothing. Networks of Syrian traders and peddlers across the United States aided the distribution of Syrian settlements; by 1902, Syrians could be found working in [[Seattle, Washington]].<ref name=Alixa/> Most of these peddlers were successful, and, with time, and after raising enough capital, some became importers and wholesalers, recruiting newcomers and supplying them with merchandise.<ref name=Alixa/> By 1908, there were 3,000 Syrian-owned businesses in the United States.<ref name=Everyculture/> By 1910, the first Syrian millionaires had emerged.<ref name=ImmigrantCulture>{{cite book |last=Levinson|first=David|coauthors=Ember, Melvin|title=American Immigrant Cultures: Builders of a Nation|year=1997|publisher=Simon & Schuster Macmillan|isbn=0028972139|pages=p. 580}}</ref>

Syrian Americans gradually started to work in various métiers; many worked as physicians, lawyers, and engineers. Many Syrian Americans also worked in the bustling auto industry, bringing about large Syrian American gatherings in areas like [[Dearborn, Michigan]].<ref name=Dearborn>{{cite book |last=Giggie|first=John|coauthors=Winston, Diane|title=Faith in the Market: Religion and the Rise of Urban Commercial Culture|year=2002|publisher=[[Rutgers University]] Press|isbn=0813530997|pages=p. 204}}</ref> Later Syrian emigrants served in fields like banking, medicine, and computer science. Syrian Americans have a different occupational distribution than all Americans. According to the 2000 census, 42% of the Syrian Americans worked in management and professional occupations, compared with 34% of their counterparts in the total population; additionally, more Syrian Americans worked in sales than all American workers.<ref name=UScensus-Arab/> However, Syrian Americans worked less in the other work domains like farming, transportation, construction, etc. than all American workers.<ref name=UScensus-Arab/>

The median level of earnings for Syrian men and women is higher than the national earning median; employed Syrian men earned an average $46,058 per year, compared with $37,057 for all Americans and $41,687 for Arab Americans.<ref name=UScensus-Arab/> Syrian American families also had a higher median income than all families and lower poverty rates than those of the general population.<ref name=UScensus-Arab/>

== Culture ==
Syrians value strong family ties. Unlike young Americans, young Syrians find leaving their family unnecessary to set up their independence. Respect and social status are important in Syrian societies. Men are respected for their financial success or their honesty and sincerity. Syrians are characterized by their magnanimity and graciousness, ethics which are integral to Syrian life.<ref name=RoadfromDamascus>{{cite book |last=Davis|first=Scott|title=The Road from Damascus: A Journey Through Syria|year=2002|publisher=Cune Press|isbn=9781885942845|url=http://www.cunepress.net/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=88594100145700}}</ref> Although these are virtuous characteristics, many have criticized Syrians, and Arabs in general, for a tendency toward "overstatement, equivocation, intractability, intense emotionalism, and at times, aggressiveness."<ref name=Alixa>{{cite book |last=Naff |first=Alixa |title= Becoming American: The Early Arab Immigrant Experience |year=1993 |publisher=[[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], [[Southern Illinois University Press]] |isbn= 9780585108094}}</ref> Men, the heads of a Syrian household, take care of their women. However, much of the Syrian traditions have diminished with time, mainly due to the fast pace of life in America which encourages individual independence.

=== Cuisine ===
[[Image:Fattoush.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A garnished dish of [[tabbouleh]]]]
Syrians consider eating an important aspect of social life. There are many Syrian dishes which have become popular in the United States. Unlike many Western foods, Syrian foods take more time to cook, are less expensive and usually more healthy.<ref name=Cuisine/> [[Pita]] bread (''khubz''), which is round flat bread, and ''[[hummus]]'', a [[dip (food)|dip]] made of ground [[chickpea]]s, [[sesame]] [[tahini]], [[lemon juice]], and [[garlic]], are two popular Syrian foods. ''[[Baba ghanoush]]'', or eggplant spreads, is also a dish made by Syrians. Popular Syrian salads include ''[[tabbouleh]]'' and ''[[fattoush]]''. The Syrian cuisine includes other dishes like stuffed [[zucchini]] (''mahshe''), [[dolma]], [[kebab]], ''[[kibbeh]]'', ''[[kibbeh nayyeh]]'', ''[[mujaddara]]'', [[shawarma]], and ''[[shanklish]]''. Syrians often serve selections of appetizers, known as ''[[meze]]'', before the main course. ''[[Za'atar]]'', [[minced beef]], and cheese [[manakish]] are popular hors d'oeuvre. Syrians are also well-known for their [[Syrian cheese|cheese]]. A popular Syrian drink is the [[Arak (distilled beverage)|''arak'' beverage]]. One of the popular [[dessert]]s made by Syrians is the ''[[baklava]]'', which is made of [[filo]] pastry filled with chopped nuts and soaked in [[honey]].<ref name=Cuisine>{{cite book |last=Mahdi|first=Ali Akbar|title=Teen Life in the Middle East|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=031331893X|pages=pp. 189-191|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-ewAe5DwteQC&pg=PA190&ots=UUhACPKtjw&dq=Syrian+cuisine&sig=tuIXS5X9h6pWLWo5eqXPmRWyXY4}}</ref>

=== Music ===
{{Further|[[Arabic music]], [[Music of Syria]]}}
[[Image:79-tone Kanun on the couch.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Typical [[kanun (instrument)|kanun]] with a 79-tone mandal configuration]]
[[Music of Syria|Syrian music]] includes several genres and styles of [[music]] ranging from [[Arab classical music|Arab classical]] to [[Arabic pop music]] and from [[secular music|secular]] to [[sacred music]]. Syrian music is characterized by an emphasis on [[melody]] and [[rhythm]], as opposed to [[harmony]]. There are some genres of Syrian music that are [[polyphony|polyphonic]], but typically, most Syrian and Arabic music is [[homophony|homophonic]]. Syrian music is also characterized by the predominance of vocal music. The prototypical Arabic music ensemble in Egypt and Syria is known as the [[Takht (music)|''takht'']], and relies on a number of [[musical instrument]]s that represent a standardized [[tone system]], and are played with generally standardized performance techniques, thus displaying similar details in construction and design. Such musical instruments include the [[oud]], [[kanun (instrument)|kanun]], [[rabab]], [[ney]], [[violin]], [[riq]] and [[goblet drum|''tableh'']].<ref name=Music>{{cite book |last=Toumar|first=Habib Hassan|title=The Music of the Arabs|year=2003|publisher=Amadeus|isbn=1574670816}}</ref> The Jews of Syria sang [[pizmonim]].

Modern Syrian music has incorporated instruments from the West, including the [[electric guitar]], [[cello]], [[double bass]] and [[oboe]], and incorporated influences from [[jazz]] and other foreign musical styles.

=== Traditional clothing ===
Traditional dress is not very common with Syrian Americans, and even native Syrians; modern Western clothing is conventional in both Syria and the United States.<ref name=Nationalgeo>{{cite web|url=http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0502/feature6/assignment1.html| title =Syrian Royal Tomb | accessdate =2007-05-23 | publisher =[[National Geographic Magazine]]|author=Lange, Karen}}</ref> Ethnic dance performers wear a ''shirwal'', which are loose, baggy pants with an elastic waist. Some Muslim women wear a ''[[hijab]]'', which is a [[headscarf]] worn by Muslim women to cover their [[hair]]. There are [[Sartorial hijab|various styles]] of ''hijab''.

=== Holidays ===
Syrian Americans celebrate many religious [[holiday]]s. Muslim Syrian Americans celebrate three main [[Muslim holiday]]s: Ramadan, Eid ul-Fitr (Lesser Bairam), and Eid ul-Adha (Greater Bairam). [[Ramadan]] is the ninth month of the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic year]], during which Muslims fast from dawn to sunset; Muslims resort to self-discipline to cleanse themselves spiritually. After Ramadan is over, Muslims celebrate [[Eid ul-Fitr]], when Muslims break their fasting and revel exuberantly. Muslims also celebrate [[Eid ul-Adha]] (which means ''The Festival of Sacrifice'') 70 days after at the end of the Islamic year, a holiday which is held along with the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, ''[[Hajj]]''.<ref name=Holidays>{{cite web|url=http://damascus.usembassy.gov/holidays.html| title =Holidays | accessdate =2007-05-24 | publisher =US Embassy in Damascus}}</ref>

Christian Syrian Americans celebrate most [[Liturgical year|Christian holidays]] usually celebrated in the United States. They celebrate [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]], but since most Syrians are Eastern Orthodox, they celebrate Easter on a different Sunday than most other Americans. Some Christians celebrate various Saints' days. Syrian American Jews celebrate the [[Jewish holiday]]s, such as [[Rosh Hashanah]], [[Yom Kippur]], [[Sukkot]], [[Purim]], [[Passover]] and [[Shavuot]]. Few Syrians celebrate Syria's [[independence day]], April 17. As American citizens, many Syrians celebrate American holidays like [[Memorial Day]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], and [[Thanksgiving Day]].

=== Dating and marriage ===
[[Dating (activity)|Dating]] among assimilated Syrian Americans, especially Christians, is widely acceptable. However, [[conservatism|conservative]] and traditionalist Syrian Americans prefer arranged relationships and disfavor casual dating. Muslims can only date after a ceremonial engagement. After completing their marriage contact, ''kitabt al-kitab'' (Arabic: كتابة الكتاب, which means "writing the book"), a Muslim couple have a period that ranges from a few months to a year or more to get used to living with one another. After this time period, a [[wedding]] takes place and fulfills the marriage. Muslims tend to marry other Muslims only. Unable to find other suitable Muslim Syrian Americans, many Muslim Syrian American women have married other Muslim Americans.<ref name=Everyculture/> 

Syrian American marriages are usually very strong; this is reflected by the low [[Divorce demography|divorce rates]] among Syrian Americans, which are below the average rates in the United States.<ref name=Everyculture/> Generally, Syrian American partners tend to have more children than average American partners; Syrian American partners also tend to have children at early stages of their marriages. According to the [[United States Census, 2000|United States 2000 Census]], almost 62% of Syrian American households were married-couple households.<ref name=UScensus-Arab>{{cite web | url =http://www.census.gov/prod/2005pubs/censr-21.pdf | title =We the People of Arab Ancestry in the United States | accessdate =2007-05-20 | publisher =[[United States Census]]}}</ref>

== Education ==
[[Image:Education-USA-Arabs.png|right|thumb|200px|35% of Syrians 25 years and older have a [[Bachelor's degree]] or more, compared to 24.4% of all Americans]]
Syrian Americans, including the earliest immigrants, have always had a convention of high [[education]]. Like other Americans, Syrian Americans view education as a necessity. Generally, Syrian and other Arab Americans are more highly educated than the average American. In the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] it was reported that the proportion of Syrian Americans to achieve a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher is one and a half times that of the total American population.<ref name=UScensus-Arab/> Many Syrian Americans now work as [[engineer]]s, [[scientist]]s, [[pharmacist|druggists]], and [[physician|medical doctor]]s.

== Language ==
Syrians are mainly [[Arabic language|Arabic]] speakers. While some may speak the formal [[literary Arabic]], many Syrians speak [[Syrian Arabic]], a dialect which belongs to the [[Levantine Arabic]] family of dialects. There are also sub-dialects in Syrian Arabic; for example, people from [[Aleppo]] have a distinct and distinguishable accent, one that differs considerably from that of people from [[Homs]] or [[Al-Hasakah]]. Syrians can usually comprehend and understand the dialects of most Arabs, especially those who speak any form of Levantine Arabic. 

Many old Syrian American families have lost their linguistic traditions due to the fact that many parents do not teach their children Arabic. Newer immigrants, however, maintain their language traditions. The 2000 census shows that 79.9% of Syrian Americans speak English "very well".<ref name=UScensus-Arab/> Throughout the United States, there are [[school]]s which offer Arabic language classes; there are also some [[Eastern Orthodox church]]es which hold Arabic services.<ref name=Everyculture/>

== Notable people and contributions ==
Sometimes some confusion occurs between Greater Syria and the modern Syria when determining the place of origin of the earliest Syrian Americans. However, the following list is comprised of notable Americans which are originally people of modern Syrian heritage.
*[[F. Murray Abraham]] (born [[24 October]] [[1939]]), an [[Assyria]]n American [[actor]]. Abraham won the [[Academy Award]] [[Academy Award for Best Actor|for Best Actor]] for his role as [[Antonio Salieri]] in the [[1984 in film|1984 film]] ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]''. His career after ''Amadeus'' inspired the name of the phenomenon dubbed "[[F. Murray Abraham syndrome]]", attributed to actors who, after winning an Oscar, have difficulty obtaining comparable success and recognition despite having recognizable talent.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.film.com/news/story/entertainmentoscarscursedc/13303376| title =Is winning an Oscar a curse or a blessing?| accessdate =2007-05-20 | publisher =Film.com| author =Zeidler, Sue}}</ref>
