'''Ubuntu''' ({{IPA2|ʊˈbʊntuː}} in English<ref>http://www.ubuntu.com/aboutus/faq</ref>, {{IPA2|ùbúntú}} in Zulu) is a predominantly desktop-oriented [[Linux distribution]] based on [[Debian GNU/Linux]]. Ubuntu aims to use only [[free software]] to provide an up-to-date yet stable operating system for the average user, and features a strong focus on [[usability]], regular releases, and ease of installation at the expense of platform diversity. Ubuntu is sponsored by [[Canonical Ltd]], owned by [[South Africa]]n entrepreneur [[Mark Shuttleworth]]. The name of the distribution comes from the southern [[Africa]]n concept of ''[[Ubuntu (philosophy)|ubuntu]]'' which may be rendered roughly as "humanity toward others", "we are people because of other people", or "I am who I am because of who we all are," though other meanings have been suggested.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.easy-ubuntu-linux.com/ubuntu-african-word.html | title=Ubuntu's African Roots | accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref>

[[Kubuntu]] and [[Xubuntu]] are official subprojects of the Ubuntu project, aiming to bring the [[KDE]] and [[Xfce]] [[desktop environment]]s, respectively, to the Ubuntu core. [[Edubuntu]] is an official subproject designed for school environments, and should be equally suitable for children to use at home.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edubuntu - Frequently asked questions |url=http://www.edubuntu.org/faq |accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref> [[Gobuntu]] is an official subproject that is aimed at adhering strictly to the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s [[Free software#Definition| Four Freedoms]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Gobuntu - What is Gobuntu |url=http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/gobuntu |accessdate=2007-10-26}}</ref> The newest official subproject is JeOS. Ubuntu JeOS (pronounced "Juice") is an efficient variant of the popular desktop and server operating system, configured specifically for [[virtual appliances]].

Ubuntu releases new versions every six months, and supports those releases for 18 months with daily security fixes and patches to critical bugs. There are also Long Term Support (''LTS'') releases, which have three years support for the desktop version and five years for the server version.  The most recent LTS version, Ubuntu 6.06 ''(Dapper Drake)'', was released on [[June 1]] [[2006]] (updated to Ubuntu 6.06.1 on [[August 10]] 2006); the next LTS version will be 8.04 ''(Hardy Heron)'', scheduled for release in April 2008. The most recent version, Ubuntu 7.10 ''(Gutsy Gibbon)'', was released on [[18 October]] [[2007]].

==History and development process==
Ubuntu's first release was on [[October 20]], [[2004]], which began by making a temporary [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[Debian GNU/Linux]] project.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ubuntustory | title=ubuntu/history "The Ubuntu Story" | accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> This was done so that a new version of Ubuntu could be released every six months<ref>[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases Time Based Releases]</ref>, resulting in a more frequently updated system. Ubuntu releases always include the most recent [[GNOME]] release, and are scheduled to be released about a month after GNOME.<ref>[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases Releases]</ref> In contrast with previous general-purpose forks of Debian—such as [[MEPIS]], [[Xandros]], [[Linspire]], [[Progeny Componentized Linux|Progeny]] and [[Libranet]], many of which relied on [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and [[closed source software|closed source]] add-ons as part of their business model—Ubuntu has stayed closer to Debian's philosophy and uses [[free software|free]] (''[[Gratis versus Libre|libre]]'') software most of the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/philosophy |title=ubuntu/philosophy |accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref>

The Ubuntu logo and typography has remained the same since that first release. The hand-drawn<ref>[http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-23773.html Anyone know what font the Ubuntu Logo uses?]</ref>, lower case [[OpenType]] font used is called [[Ubuntu-Title]] and was created by Andy Fitzsimon.<ref name=ubuntutitle>[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuTitle UbuntuTitle]</ref> The font is distributed under the [[Lesser General Public License]] and use with logos derived from the Ubuntu logo is encouraged.<ref name=ubuntutitle /> The font is available  as a package for Ubuntu.<ref name=ubuntutitle />

Ubuntu packages have generally been based on packages from [[Debian]]'s [[Debian#Development versions|unstable branch]]: both distributions use Debian's [[deb (file format)|deb]] [[Software package|package]] format and [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]]/[[Synaptic]] to manage installed packages. 

Ubuntu cooperates with Debian - to some extent pushing changes back to Debian,<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-website/+bug/154274 | title=ubuntu/relationship "Website does not reference Debian visibly" | accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> although there has been criticism that this is not happening enough<ref name=forking>{{cite web | url=http://ianmurdock.com/?p=167 | title=Ubuntu vs. Debian, reprise | accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> and Debian and Ubuntu packages are not necessarily 'binary compatible' with each other.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarkShuttleworth | title=Mark Shuttleworth on binary compatibility | accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref> Many Ubuntu developers are also maintainers of key packages within Debian itself. However, [[Ian Murdock]], the founder of Debian, criticized Ubuntu for incompatibilities between its packages and those of Debian, saying that Ubuntu had diverged too far from [[Debian Sarge]] to remain compatible.<ref name=forking />

There are plans for a branch codenamed Grumpy Groundhog. It will be a permanently unstable development and testing branch, pulling the source directly out of the [[revision control]] of the various programs and applications that are shipped as part of Ubuntu. This will allow power users and upstream developers to test up-to-the-minute versions of individual programs as they would appear if packaged for the distribution today, without needing to build packages themselves; it will be able to provide early warning of build failures on various architectures.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDownUnder/BOFs/GrumpyGroundhog | title=GrumpyGroundhog specification | accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> It is intended that Grumpy Groundhog should merge with Debian Unstable every six months.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wiki.edubuntu.org/MarkShuttleworth | title=MarkShuttleworth - Ubuntu Wiki | accessdate=2006-07-13}}</ref> Grumpy Groundhog has not been made available to the public yet.

Ubuntu is currently funded by [[Canonical Ltd]]. On [[July 8]], [[2005]], Mark Shuttleworth and Canonical Ltd announced the creation of the [[Ubuntu Foundation]] and provided an initial funding of US$10 million. The purpose of the foundation is to ensure the support and development for all future versions of Ubuntu, but as of 2006, the foundation remains dormant.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Mark Shuttleworth describes the foundation as an emergency fund in case Canonical's involvement ends.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2005-July/000025.html |title=Announcing Launch of ($10m) Ubuntu Foundation |accessdate=2007-04-21 |date=2005-07-08 }}</ref>

On [[1 May]] [[2007]], [[Dell]] announced they would sell desktops and laptops with Ubuntu installed and on [[24 May]] [[2007]] these computers went on sale in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/linux_3x?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs | title=Ubuntu Customers | accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> They also stated that customers would be able to buy support for Ubuntu through Dell, with the support coming from Canonical. On [[8 August]] [[2007]] these computers went on sale in the UK, France and Germany as well.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/08/07/23816.aspx | title=Dell's Blog | accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> In October, [[Tesco]] followed in Dell's footsteps and started to sell desktop computers with [[#Releases|Ubuntu 6.06 LTS]] pre-installed on them .<ref>{{cite web | url=http://direct.tesco.com/q/R.200-3224.aspx | title=Tesco Shipping Desktops with Ubuntu - eSys | }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://direct.tesco.com/q/R.200-6129.aspx | title=Tesco Shipping Desktops with Ubuntu - eSys ePC}}</ref> However unlike Dell, they do not offer Canonical's support program. Select Dell machines now include Ubuntu 7.10 with DVD playback using [[LinDVD]] software.<ref>http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS7924076658.html</ref>

During July 2007 at Ubuntu Live 2007, Mark Shuttleworth announced that Ubuntu 8.04 (out April 2008) would be the next LTS (Long Term Support) release. He also added that Canonical is committed to releasing a new LTS version every two years.

==Features==
[[Image:Ubuntu606.png|right|thumb|A screenshot of Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, showing the ''Dawn of Ubuntu'' wallpaper, one from the selections available.]]
Ubuntu focuses on [[usability]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ | title=About Ubuntu | accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref> including the widespread use of the [[sudo]] tool for administrative tasks.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo?highlight=%28sudo%29 | title=RootSudo - Ubuntu Wiki | accessdate=2006-04-25}}</ref> The Ubiquity installer<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kubuntu.org/~jriddell/espresso/screenshots/ | title=Screenshots of Ubiquity's KDE frontend | accessdate=2006-05-03}}</ref> allows installing Ubuntu to the hard disk from within the Live CD environment without the need for restarting the computer prior to installation. Ubuntu furthermore emphasizes [[accessibility]] and [[internationalization]], to reach as many people as possible. As of version 5.04, [[UTF-8]] is the default [[character encoding]]. The default appearance of the user interface in the current version is called ''Human'' and is characterized by shades of brown and orange. 

Besides standard system tools and other small applications, Ubuntu comes installed with the following software: the [[OpenOffice.org]] productivity suite, the Internet browser [[Firefox]], the instant messenger [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]] (formerly known as Gaim), and the [[raster graphics editor]] [[GIMP]]. Several lightweight [[card game|card]] and [[Computer puzzle game|puzzle]] games are pre-installed, including [[Sudoku]] and [[Chess]]. Ubuntu has all ports closed by default adding to security, although some people choose to run a [[firewall]] in order to keep tabs of incoming and outgoing connections.

Ubuntu offers a fully featured set of applications that work straight from the standard install, but nonetheless fits on a single CD. The [[live CD]] allows users to see whether their hardware is compatible before installation to the hard disk.  The live CD is then used to install Ubuntu.<ref name=livecdinstall>{{cite web | url=http://www.easy-ubuntu-linux.com/ubuntu-installation-606-2.html | title=Installing Ubuntu from the Live CD | accessdate=2006-07-08}}</ref> CDs are mailed free to anyone who requests them, and CD images are available for download. The Ubuntu live CD requires 256 megabytes of RAM, and once installed on the hard disk, Ubuntu needs four gigabytes of hard-disk space.<ref name=hwreq>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/desktopedition | title=Ubuntu 6.06 Release Notes: Hardware Requirements | accessdate=2006-07-08}}</ref> An alternate install disc using the standard [[debian-installer]] in text mode is available for download only, and is aimed at people with lower system specifications, computer dealers selling systems already installed with Ubuntu, and for complex [[Disk partitioning|partitioning]] including the use of [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ | title=Ubuntu 6.06 LTS: Download | accessdate=2006-07-30}}</ref>

With the release of Ubuntu 7.04 in April 2007, the Ubuntu installation process changed slightly.  It now supports migration from Windows.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.easy-ubuntu-linux.com/ubuntu-feisty-installation.html | title=Ubuntu 7.04 Adds a Migration Tool | accessdate=2006-06-27}}</ref>  The new migration tool imports Windows users' bookmarks, desktop background (wallpaper), and settings for immediate use in the Ubuntu installation.

For Ubuntu there are tools available to create a specific installation CD/DVD. With [[Wubi (Ubuntu)|Wubi]], it is possible to install Ubuntu on a Windows partition. It also makes use of the migration tool which imports Windows users' configurations.

===Multilingual===
Since Ubuntu uses GNOME, the language of the GUI can set up in [http://www.gnome.org/start/2.20/notes/en/index.html#rni18 different languages].

==Package classification and support==
[[Image:Ubuntu7.10shipit.jpg|thumb|200px|Ubuntu 7.10 CD]]

Ubuntu divides all software into four '''components''',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components | title=ubuntu/components | accessdate=2006-03-16}}</ref> to reflect differences in licensing and level of support available. Packages are assigned to components as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
| || '''[[free software]]''' || '''non-free software'''
|-
| '''supported''' || Main || Restricted
|-
| '''unsupported''' || Universe || Multiverse
|}

"Free" software here includes only that which meets the Ubuntu license requirements,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/licensing | title=ubuntu/licensing | accessdate=2006-06-29}}</ref> which correspond roughly to the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]].  There is one caveat for Main however; it "also may contain binary [[firmware]] and selected [[fonts]] (which are used by free components of Main) that cannot be modified without permission from their authors" so long as their "redistribution is unencumbered."

Non-free software is usually unsupported (Multiverse), but some exceptions (Restricted) are made for very important non-free software, such as non-free device drivers, without which users might be prevented from running Ubuntu on their system, particularly binary-only [[graphics card]] [[device driver|drivers]]. The level of support is more limited than for ''main'', since the developers may not have access to the [[source code]].

It is intended that ''Main'' and ''Restricted'' should contain all software needed for a general-use Linux system. Alternative programs for the same tasks and programs for specialised applications are placed in ''Universe'' and ''Multiverse''.

Beyond the official repositories is ''Ubuntu Backports'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://backports.ubuntuforums.org/ | title=UbuntuBackports | accessdate=2006-03-16}}</ref> which is an officially recognized project to [[backport]] newer versions of certain software that are available only in unstable versions of Ubuntu. The repository is not comprehensive; it mostly consists of user-requested packages, which are approved if they meet quality guidelines.

==Availability of proprietary software==
{{further|[[Linux distribution#Proprietary software]]}}
Ubuntu has a certification system for third party software.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ubuntu.com/partners/certification/software | title=partners/certification/software | accessdate=2006-03-16}}</ref> Ubuntu-certified proprietary software should work well in Ubuntu. However, many programs familiar to users of non-free operating systems, such as [[Microsoft Windows]], are incompatible and are not Ubuntu-certified. Some proprietary software that does not limit distribution is included in Ubuntu's ''multiverse'' component.

Some examples of software not distributed by Ubuntu include:

* Software that enables the playback of [[regional lockout|region-locked]] video [[DVD]]s, due to the questionable legal status of the [[Libdvdcss]] open-source DVD-decoding library in some parts of the world. (Note: the library is needed even when watching a DVD in the target region.)
* Some popular proprietary web-browser plugins, such as [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]'s (formerly [[Macromedia]]'s) [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]] (there is no Linux version) and [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]. (One [[workaround]] to the specific prohibition against redistribution in the Flash [[EULA]] is the multiverse package "flashplugin-nonfree" which automatically downloads the Linux Flash plugin directly from Adobe's site and then installs it.)

==Releases==
{{wikinews|Ubuntu releases 6.06 LTS version of popular Linux distribution}}
Each release has both a code name and a version number. The version number is based on the year and month of release. For example, the very first release of Ubuntu 4.10 was released on [[October 20]], [[2004]].<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2004-October/000003.html |title=Ubuntu 4.10 announcement |date=[[2004-10-20]] |accessdate=2007-09-25 |mailinglist=ubuntu-announce |last=Shuttleworth |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Shuttleworth }}</ref>

<!-- add in note about http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=ubuntu and its version table -->

Releases are timed to be approximately one month after GNOME releases, which are in turn about one month after releases of X.org.  Consequently, every Ubuntu release comes with a newer version of both GNOME and X.

Release 6.06—and recently 8.04—have been labeled as a Long Term Support (LTS)<!--they use the acronym and the capitals-->, to indicate that it will be supported with updates for three years on the desktop and five years on the server, with paid technical support available from [[Canonical Ltd.]]<ref name="lts">{{cite web | url=https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-April/000065.html | title=Announcing Beta release of Ubuntu 6.06 LTS | accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>

==ShipIt==
Canonical offers Ubuntu installation CDs at no cost, including postage paid for destinations anywhere in the world, via a service called ShipIt<ref name=ubushipi>{{cite web | url=http://shipit.ubuntu.com/ | title=Shipit - free shipment of Ubuntu CDs | accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>: after a request for CDs is made at shipit.ubuntu.com and approved, disks are sent to the user's postal address in the mail without charge. Delivery is estimated at six to ten weeks<ref name=shipit-faq>{{cite web | url=http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/shipit-faq | title=ShipIt Questions | accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref>.

All Ubuntu releases have been available via ShipIt, except 6.10, which had less development time due to it being released immediately after a LTS release (6.06), so 6.06 was offered in its place. As of [[December]] 2007, the most recent release available for order via ShipIt is 7.10

==Variants==
[[Image:Xubuntu704.png|thumb|right|[[Xubuntu]] 7.04 default desktop.]]
{{further|[[List of Ubuntu-based distributions]].}}
There are several variants besides Ubuntu, both official and unofficial. Of the official variants, [[Kubuntu]]<ref name=kubushipi>{{cite web | url=https://shipit.kubuntu.org/ | title=Shipit - free shipment of Kubuntu CDs | accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref> and [[Edubuntu]]<ref name=edushipi>{{cite web | url=https://shipit.edubuntu.org/ | title=Shipit - free shipment of Edubuntu CDs | accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref> are also available free of charge via mail order through Ubuntu's ShipIt service, but Xubuntu is not.<ref>[https://bugs.launchpad.net/shipit/+bug/62318 No shipit for xubuntu]</ref> These Ubuntu variants simply install a set of packages different from the original Ubuntu, but since they draw additional packages and updates from the same [[repository|repositories]] as Ubuntu, all of the same software is available for each of them. These different versions correspond to development efforts run by largely separate groups of people who try to bring different functionalities to the distribution. The official sister distributions are:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.easy-ubuntu-linux.com/other-ubuntus.html | title=Other Ubuntus | accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref>
* [[Edubuntu]], a distribution designed for classrooms using [[GNOME]]
* [[Gobuntu]], a [[free software]] distribution
* [[Kubuntu]], a desktop distribution using [[KDE]] rather than [[GNOME]]
* [[Xubuntu]], a "lightweight" distribution based on the [[Xfce]] desktop environment instead of [[GNOME]]
* [[Ubuntu Studio]], a [[multimedia]]-creation flavor of Ubuntu.
* Ubuntu [[JeOS]] (pronounced as [[juice]]), "an efficient variant [...] configured specifically for [[virtual appliance]]s"<ref>{{ cite web | title =  Ubuntu JeOS 7.10 released | url = https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2007-November/000106.html }}</ref>

Unofficial variants and derivatives are not controlled or guided by [[Canonical]] and are generally [[Fork (software development)|forks]] with different goals in mind.

==System requirements==
The most recent stable version of Ubuntu is officially supported for the [[Intel x86]] and [[AMD64]] architectures in the Desktop release and for the Intel x86, AMD64 and [[SPARC]] architectures in the Server release.<ref>http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/</ref><ref>[http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1969424,00.asp Ubuntu to Support Sun 'Niagara' Platform]</ref>

There are also unsupported ports for the [[PowerPC]] (note however that prior to version 7.04, Ubuntu officially supported the PowerPC architecture),<ref>{{cite web | url=https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2007-February/000098.html | title=Technical Board Decision - February 2007}}</ref>[[IA-64]] (Itanium) and the [[PlayStation 3]].<ref>[http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/7.04/release/ Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn)]</ref>

For older computers which do not meet the system requirements listed below, there is also [[Xubuntu]], based on [[Xfce]], which requires roughly half of the [[RAM]] and [[Hard disk drive|disk space]].

===Server Edition===
While it is possible to install the Server release on a "legacy machine" (e.g. a 75 MHz [[Pentium]] with 32 MB of RAM),<ref>[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems Installation/LowMemorySystems]</ref> the "minimum requirements"<ref name="SystemRequirements">[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements Ubuntu System Requirements]</ref> for good performance are:
*300 MHz x86 processor
*64 MB of [[RAM]] <ref name="ServerGuide710">[https://help.ubuntu.com/7.10/server/C/preparing-to-install.html#id2581089]</ref>
*500MB of disk space <ref name="ServerGuide710" />
*VGA graphics card capable of 640x480 resolution
*CD-ROM drive

===Desktop Edition===
For the Desktop release, the "recommended minimum requirements"<ref name="SystemRequirements"/> for good performance are:
*500 MHz x86 processor
*384 MB of system memory (RAM)
*8 GB of disk space (although only 4 GB are required)<ref>[http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/desktopedition Ubuntu Desktop Edition]</ref>
*Graphics card capable of 1024x768 resolution
*Sound card (optional)
*A network or Internet connection

==Install and Live CDs==
For the Desktop release, there are two different types of install CD offered:<ref>http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/</ref>
*'''Desktop CD''' (a [[Live CD]])

"''The desktop CD allows you to try Ubuntu without changing your computer at all, and at your option to install it permanently later. This type of CD is what most people will want to use. You will need at least 320MB of RAM to install from this CD.''"
*'''Alternate Install CD'''

"''The alternate install CD allows you to perform certain specialist installations of Ubuntu. It provides for the following situations: creating pre-configured OEM systems; setting up automated deployments; upgrading from older installations without network access; LVM and/or RAID partitioning; installs on systems with less than about 320MB of RAM (although note that low-memory systems may not be able to run a full desktop environment reasonably). It can also install on systems with a graphics environment not suitable to Ubuntu (which needs to be changed later) i.e. virtual PC''"
*'''Server CD'''

"''The Server Install CD allows you to install Ubuntu permanently on a computer for use as a server. It will not install a graphical user interface.''"

==Response==
Ubuntu's popularity has climbed steadily since its 2004 release. It is currently the second most viewed Linux distribution on [[Distrowatch|Distrowatch.com]][http://distrowatch.com/], and was the most accessed on the site in 2005<ref>[http://distrowatch.com/index.php?dataspan=2005 DistroWatch 2005]</ref> and 2006.<ref>[http://distrowatch.com/index.php?dataspan=2006 DistroWatch]</ref> This popularity is borne out by a rise in Google searches for "Ubuntu" since 2004 as compared to a shrinking or plateauing number for terms related to other major desktop Linux distributions such as "[[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]]", "[[Debian]]" or "[[SUSE Linux|SUSE]]" over the same period.<ref>[[Google Trends]], comparing [http://www.google.com/trends?q=Fedora|RHEL|Red+Hat,+Debian,+Ubuntu,+SUSE|OpenSUSE,+Mandrake|Mandriva&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=2 Fedora|RHEL|Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE|OpenSUSE, Mandrake|Mandriva]</ref> In a 2007 survey of 38,500 visitors on DesktopLinux.com, Ubuntu was the most popular distribution with 30.3 percent of respondents using it.<ref>{{cite web|title=2007 Desktop Linux Market survey|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/cgi-bin/survey/survey.cgi?view=archive&id=0813200712407|date=[[2007-08-21]]|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref>
