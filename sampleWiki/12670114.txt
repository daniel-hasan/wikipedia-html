The '''South Side''' is a major part of the city of [[Chicago]], which is located in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. Much of it has evolved from the incorporation of independent townships, such as [[Hyde Park Township]], that have been annexed by the city.

The [[Chicago Loop|downtown "Loop" district]] (#32) is south of the river, but changing geographic and social perspectives have caused the contemporary definition of the "South Side" to exclude the Loop.<ref name=EoCSS>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1177.html|title=South Side|accessdate=2007-08-10|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Pacyga, Dominic A.}}</ref><ref name=ZornPoll/><ref name=Nobleman>  Further confusing the issue, [[Streets and highways of Chicago|Chicago's address numbering system]] uses [[Madison Street (Chicago)|Madison Street]] (which runs east-west in the middle of the Loop) as the demarcation between north and south.<ref name=SC>Hayner, Don and Tom McNamee, ''Streetwise Chicago'', "Madison Street", p. 79, Loyola University Press, 1988, ISBN 0-8294-0597-6</ref> Since the Loop's southern boundary is [[Roosevelt Road]], many say that the South Side begins with the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]] (#33) [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]], and, moving westward, it begins with the [[Armour Square, Chicago|Armour Square]] (#34), [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]] (#60), [[McKinley Park, Chicago|McKinley Park]] (#59), [[Brighton Park, Chicago|Brighton Park]] (#58), [[Archer Heights, Chicago|Archer Heights]] (#57) and [[Garfield Ridge, Chicago|Garfield Ridge]] (#56) community areas.<ref name=Encarta/>  This article covers the region defined with these border communities. To the south of these lie 35 more community areas of the city, making the South Side defined by Roosevelt Road larger than the North and West Sides combined. [[Lake Michigan]] and the [[Indiana]] state line border provide eastern boundaries that remain constant. The southern border has changed over time because of Chicago's evolving city limits.

====Southwest Side====

The Southwest Side of Chicago is a subsection of the South Side comprising mainly residential, predominantly white and Hispanic neighborhoods. Architecturally, the Southwest Side is distinguished by the tract of Chicago's [[Bungalow Belt]], which runs through it.

Archer Heights, a [[Polish American|Polish]] enclave along [[Archer Avenue, Chicago|Archer Avenue]], which leads toward [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway Airport]], is located on the Southwest Side of the city, as is [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]] (#72), home to a large concentration of [[Irish American]]s. Beverly hosts the annual [[South Side Irish Parade]], which typically draws a larger crowd than the [[St. Patrick's Day parade]] in Chicago's Loop. In fact, the parade is said to be the largest Irish neighborhood St. Patrick's celebration in the world outside of [[Dublin, Ireland]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200203/ai_mark03039308|accessdate=2007-09-27|month=March|year=2002|publisher=FindArticles|work=Market Wire|title=South Side Irish Parade Expected To Draw Record Crowd}}</ref> and it is broadcast on Chicago's [[CBS]] [[Affiliate network|affiliate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbs2chicago.com/local/local_story_070112246.html|accessdate=2007-09-27|title=Pray, Parade and Party At South Side Irish Parade|author=Puccinelli, Mike|publisher=CBS Broadcasting, Inc.}}</ref>  The Southwest Side is also home to the largest concentration of [[Góral]]s, ([[Carpathian mountains|Carpathian]] highlanders) outside of [[Europe]]; it is the location of the [[Polish Highlanders Alliance of North America]].

The South Side Irish Parade is not the South Side's only large parade. The [[Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic]], the second largest parade in the United States and the nation's largest [[African-American]] parade,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=ontv&id=4402494|accessdate=2007-09-28|date=2006|title=ABC 7 Chicago Presents Live Broadcast Of The Bud Billiken Parade|publisher=ABC Inc., WLS-TV Chicago}}</ref> runs through the South Side.

[[Image:Chicago Olympics 2016.jpg|160px|thumb|right|The South Side has a prominent role in the [[Chicago 2016 Olympic bid]].]]

==Athletics==
The South Side hosts two major professional athletic teams. [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Chicago White Sox]] play at [[U.S. Cellular Field]] in the Armour Square community area, while the [[National Football League]]'s [[Chicago Bears]] play at [[Soldier Field]] in the Near South Side community area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/tickets/IndividualGameTickets.asp|accessdate=2007-10-08|publisher=CHICAGO BEARS|title=Individual Game Tickets|date=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/ballpark/cws_attractions_map.jsp|accessdate=2007-10-08|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.|title=U.S. Cellular Field Attractions|date=2007}}</ref>  Formerly, it has hosted the [[Chicago American Giants]] of the [[Negro Leagues|Negro National Leagues]] and the [[Chicago Cardinals]] of the National Football League.<ref name=EoCSS/> 

===2016 Olympic bid===

The South Side will play a prominent role in Chicago's bid for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].

==History==

===Demographics===

With its factories, steel mills, and [[meat packing industry|meat-packing]] plants, the South Side saw a sustained period of immigration which began around the 1860s and continued through  [[World War II]]. [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] immigrants, in particular, settled in neighborhoods adjacent to industrial zones. African Americans resided in [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]] (around 35th and State Streets) in an area called "The Black Belt", and they later spread across the South Side after World War II. The Black Belt, which gave a new meaning to the term [[ghetto]], arose from discriminatory real estate practices and the threat of violence in nearby white neighborhoods.<ref name=EoCGh>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/514.html|title=Ghettoization|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Bennett, Larry|accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>

Post [[reconstruction]] black southerners migrated to Chicago in large numbers and caused the African American population to nearly quadruple from 4,000 to 15,000 between 1870 and 1890.<ref name=EoCAA>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/27.html|accessdate=2007-08-10|title=African Americans|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Manning, Christopher}}</ref>  The population was concentrated on the South Side. The migration continued into the 20th century when the Black population reached 40,000 by 1910, with 78% residing in the South Side's "Black Belt", which extended for 30 blocks along [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] and was only a few blocks wide.<ref name=EoCAA/> The migration of blacks to Chicago's South Side led to a [[white flight]].<ref name=EoCOL>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/916.html|accessdate=2007-08-10|title=Oak Lawn, IL|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Gurlacz, Betsy}}</ref>

The South Side has had a history of [[racial segregation]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, much of the South Side was a hotbed of legal debate with cases such as [[Hansberry v. Lee]], {{ussc|311|32|1940}}, rising to the [[U. S. Supreme Court]] in the [[Washington Park Subdivision]]. Another example of this segregation was the construction of the [[Dan Ryan Expressway]], which separated some white neighborhoods from black neighborhoods (''e.g.'' the divide between Bridgeport and [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]]). <!--I think this is the only uncited para, but it has a Supreme Court external link in it-->

[[Image:Robertaylorhome.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Last [[Robert Taylor Homes|Robert Taylor Home]], 2005]]
After decades of sustaining some of the poorest housing conditions in the United States, the [[Chicago Housing Authority]] has begun replacing the old high-rise public housing with mixed-income, lower-density developments in what is known as the Plan for Transformation. Many of the CHA's massive public housing projects, which lined several miles of south State Street, have been torn down. Among the largest were the [[Robert Taylor Homes]] and the [[Cabrini-Green]] project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecha.org/transformplan/plan_summary.html |title=The CHA's Plan for Transformation |publisher=Chicago Housing Authority |date=2007}}</ref>

[[Private sector]] redevelopment is occurring rapidly. Neighborhood rehabilitation (and, in some cases, gentrification) can also be seen in parts of Washington Park, [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]] (#42) and Bronzeville, as well as in Bridgeport and McKinley Park. Historic [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]]'s redevelopment is another example of a work in progress. [[Chinatown, Chicago|Chinatown]], which has seen a surge in growth and has become an increasingly popular destination for both tourists and locals alike, is a cornerstone of the city's [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] community. The South Loop's booming mid-decade construction suggests that the South Side will be populated with more Caucasians in the coming years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russstewart.com/9-14-05.htm|accessdate=2007-10-23|date=2007-10-19|title=CHICAGO’S DEMOGRAPHIC TREND: MORE WHITES, FEWER BLACKS|publisher=Russ Stewart, Attorney at Law|author= Stewart, Russ}}</ref>

White flight from the South Side has resulted in a high remaining percentage of African Americans. Thus, most neighborhoods south of 55th Street are predominantly black with a large [[Mexican American]] population residing in Little Village (South Lawndale) and areas south of 99th Street. Hyde Park is home to the [[University of Chicago]] as well as the South Side's largest [[Jew]]ish population, which is centered around Chicago's oldest [[synagogue]], the [[Chicago Landmark]] [[KAM Isaiah Israel]].<ref name=KAM>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/K/KAMIsaiahIsrael.html|title=K.A.M.

Street gangs have been prominent on the South Side for over a century. By the 1960s, gangs such as the [[Vice Lords]] began to improve their public image, moving from thuggish ventures to obtaining government and private grants. By 2000, gangs crossed gender lines to include about a 20% female composition.<ref name=EoCG>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/497.html|accessdate=2007-08-10|title=Gangs|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Diamond, Andrew J.}}</ref>

Chicago's African American community, which was concentrated on the South Side, experienced an artistic movement following the [[Harlem Renaissance]] in [[New York City]]. From the 1930s until the 1950s, the movement was concentrated in and around the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] community area and included [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], [[Margaret Burroughs]], [[Elizabeth Catlett]], [[Eldzier Cortor]], [[Gordon Parks]], and [[Richard Wright]].<ref name=EoCA>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/72.html|accessdate=2007-08-10|title=Art|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Warren, Lynne}}</ref> Other Chicago Black Renaissance artists included [[Willard Motley]], [[William Attaway]], [[Frank Marshall Davis]] and [[Margaret Walker]]. [[St. Clair Drake]] and [[Horace R. Cayton]] represented the new wave of intellectual expression in literature by depicting the culture of the urban ghetto rather than the culture of the blacks of the south in the [[monograph]] ''[[Black Metropolis]]'' (ISBN 0226162346).<ref name=EoCAA/> In 1961, Burroughs founded the [[DuSable Museum]], and by the late 60s the South Side had a resurgent art movement led by [[Jim Nutt]], [[Gladys Nilsson]] and [[Karl Wirsum]], who became known as the [[Chicago Imagists]].

Music in Chicago flourished because labels with studios in New York City or [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] only kept regional distribution offices in Chicago, which created a vacuum for many independent labels.<ref name=EoCRP>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1048.html|accessdate=2007-08-13|title=Record Publishing|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Clague, Mark}}</ref> In 1948, [[Blues]] was introduced by [[Aristocrat Records]] (later [[Chess Records]]), and [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Chess Records]] quickly followed with [[Little Walker]], [[Jimmy Rogers]], and [[Howlin' Wolf]].<ref name=EoCAA/><ref name=EoCRaB/> Vee-Jay, the largest black owned label before [[Motown Records]], was among the post-World War II companies that formed "Record Row" on Cottage Grove between 47th and 50th Streets and later (in the 1960s) along South [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]].<ref name=EoCRP/><ref name=EoCRaB>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1070.html|accessdate=2007-08-13|title=Rhythm and Blues|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Pruter, Robert}}</ref> [[Rhythm and blues]] continued to thrive after Record Row became the hub of gospelized R&B, known as soul.

Many other artists have left their mark on Chicago's South Side.

The [[Illinois Constitution]] gave rise to townships that provided municipal services in 1850. Several townships surrounding Chicago incorporated in order to better service their residents. However, growth and prosperity led to an overburdened government system. In 1889, most of these townships determined that they would be better off as part of a larger Chicago. Lake View, Jefferson, Cicero, Lake, and [[Hyde Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Hyde Park Township]]s were annexed.<ref name=EoCT>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2484.html|title=Townships|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author= Keating, Ann Durkin|accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref><ref name=EOCAaAttCoC>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/3716.html|accessdate=2007-10-23|date=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Keating, Ann Durkin|title=Annexations and Additions to the City of Chicago }}</ref>  Today's South Side is mostly comprised of the old Hyde Park and Lake Townships. Within these townships many had made speculative bets on the future prosperity of the respective regions.  Much of the South Side has evolved from these speculative investments. [[Stephen A.

===Prostitution===
Chicago's reputation for political corruption stems from tolerance of vices such as [[prostitution]]. Early prostitution occurred in the [[central business district]]. However, the disreputables were eventually pushed to the South Side, creating the Levee, one of the nation's most infamous sex districts. Although [[Chicago Mayor]] [[Carter Harrison II]] closed the Levee in 1912 and much of the trade moved to the suburbs, nightclubs on the South Side had an ample supply of prostitutes.<ref name=EoCPros>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1015.html|accessdate=2007-08-10|title=Prostitution|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Blair, Cynthia M.}}</ref> Among those who cared for and rehabilitated persons charged with prostitution were a small group of the [[Good Shepherd Sisters]] who eventually became the first [[nun]]s to serve African Americans on Chicago's South Side.<ref name=EoCHotGS>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/606.html|title=House of the Good Shepherd / Chicago Industrial School for Girls|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|author=Hoy, Suellen|accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>

The South Side has been a place of political controversy. Although the locations of some of these notable controversies have not become officials landmarks, they remain important parts of Chicago history. The [[Chicago Race Riot of 1919]] was the worst of the approximately 25 riots during the [[Red Summer of 1919]] and required 6000 [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] troops to quell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9023985/Chicago-Race-Riot-of-1919|accessdate=2007-08-24|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|date=2007|title=Chicago Race Riot of 1919}}</ref>  As mentioned above, segregation has been a political theme of controversy for some time on the South Side as exhibited by [[Hansberry v.

The South Side is served extensively by [[mass transit]] as well as major roads and highways. In addition, [[Midway International Airport]], which provides connections between the South Side and the world, is located on the South Side. Among the highways through the South Side are [[Interstate 94 in Illinois|I-94]] (which goes by the names [[Dan Ryan Expressway]], [[Bishop Ford Freeway]], and [[Kingery Expressway]] on the South Side), [[Interstate 90 in Illinois|I-90]] (which goes by the names [[Dan Ryan Expressway]], and [[Chicago Skyway]] on the South Side), [[Interstate 57 in Illinois|I-57]], [[Interstate 55 in Illinois|I-55]] [[U.S. Route 12 in Illinois|U.S. 12]], [[U.S. Route 20 in Illinois|U.S. 20]], and [[U.S. Route 41 in Illinois|U.S. 41]]. Several [[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA) bus and train lines and [[Metra]] train lines link the South Side to rest of the city. The South Side is serviced by the [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red]], [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green]] and [[Orange Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Orange]] lines of the [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]], and the [[Rock Island District]], [[Metra Electric Line|Metra Electric]], and [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore]] [[Metra]] lines and a few stops on the [[SouthWest Service]] Metra line. In addition to standard local metropolitan bus service by the CTA, several South Side CTA express service bus routes provide the South Side with direct service into the [[Chicago Loop]] by running without stops along [[Lake Shore Drive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transitchicago.com/maps/maps/2007C.html|accessdate=2007-09-27|publisher=Chicago Transit Authority|title=Central System Map}}</ref>

The [[Chicago Park District]] boasts {{acre to km2|7300|wiki=yes}} of parkland, 552 [[Chicago Parks|parks]], 33 [[Chicago beaches|beaches]], nine museums, two world-class [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatories]], 16 historic [[lagoon]]s, 10 bird and wildlife gardens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/parks.home.cfm|accessdate=2007-10-17|publisher=Chicago Park District|title=Parks & Facilities}}</ref> Many of these are on the South Side, including several large parks that are part of the legacy of [[Paul Cornell (lawyer)|Paul Cornell]], the father of [[Hyde Park Township|Hyde Park]], and his service on the South Parks Commission. Chicago Park District parks serving the South Side include [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]], [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]], [[Washington Park (Chicago park)|Washington Park]], [[Midway Plaisance]] and [[Harold Washington Park]]. The parks of Chicago foster and host tremendous amounts of athletic activities. The South Side also has the only [[List of protected areas of Illinois|Illinois state park]] within the city of Chicago: [[William W. Powers State Recreation Area]]. In addition, several events cause the closure of parts of [[Lake Shore Drive]]. Although the [[Chicago Marathon]] causes many roads to be closed in its route that goes as far north as [[Wrigleyville]] and to [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]] on the South Side, it does not cause any closures to the drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/uploadedFiles/Chicago_Marathon/Runner_Information/07_Course_Map_Vert_CMYK.pdf|accessdate=2007-09-27|title=The LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon 2007 Course Map|publisher=chicagomarathon.com}}</ref> However, on the South Side, the Chicago Half Marathon necessitates closures,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohalfmarathon.com/|accessdate=2007-09-27|publisher=Devine Sports|title=The Chicago Half Marathon}}</ref> and the entire drive is closed for [[Bike The Drive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikethedrive.org/|accessdate=2007-09-27|title=Bank America Bike The Drive|publisher=Chicagoland Bicycle Federation}}</ref>
