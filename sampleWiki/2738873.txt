'''Harrogate Town F.C.''' is an [[England|English]] semi-professional [[football (soccer)|football]] club from [[Harrogate, North Yorkshire]]. The club was founded in [[1914]] and currently competes in the [[Conference North]] division of the Football Conference.

==History== 
The club was founded as '''Harrogate AFC''' in 1914. Previously the town of [[Harrogate]] had tried to put together a football team as far back as [[1907]] but nothing emerged until 1914. They were entered into the [[Northern League (football)|Northern League]] upon their year of founding, and were set to play their home fixtures at the County Ground. However, due to [[World War I]] all fixtures were postponed.

After World War I ended, a meeting was held around the idea of putting the club back together. A man named Robert Ackrill Breare instigated this, and he later became the Secretary of the club. Harrogate were entered into the [[West Riding League]]. 

===Early years===
Harrogate AFC finally played in their first competitive fixture on [[30 August]] [[1919]] at Starbeck Lane Ground against Horsforth FC. They won the name 1-0 and the scorer was L. Craven with a headed goal. They were entered into the [[FA Cup]] the same year. Harrogate also won their first trophy; the Whitworth Cup with a 4-0 victory against Ripon City.

For the 1920/21 season they were one of the founding teams in the new [[Yorkshire League]], yet they also continued to field a team in the [[West Riding League]]. The club had relocated to a new ground; Wetherby Lane. Around the holiday periods, they took part in friendlies against higher league opposition including [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at their [[Anfield]] ground, and another at fellow Yorkshire side [[Sheffield United]] in front of 15,000 fans.

They moved league once again for their third season, leaving the West Riding League and moving into the [[Midland Football League]]. It included the reserve teams of [[Nottingham Forest]], [[Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. The club remained in the Yorkshire League, fielding a reserve team. However, the club resigned from the Midland's league after only one season and reverting to fielding a first team in the Yorkshire League. The West Riding County Challenge Cup was won by Harrogate in [[1925]], with their 3-1 victory against Fryston Colliery at [[Elland Road]].

League victory was secured in 1926/27, as Harrogate became the [[Yorkshire League]] champions, with Bob Morphet scoring 44 goals. The club then moved into the [[Northern League (football)|Northern League]]. Their second West Riding County Challenge Cup was won the same season against against [[Selby|Selby Town]]. The team disbanded in [[1932]].

===Climbing the Pyramid===
The town's club was brought back in [[1935]] as '''Harrogate Hotspurs'''. After [[World War II]], the club was renamed as '''Harrogate Town''' and played in the [[West Yorkshire League]]. Harrogate Town joined the [[Yorkshire League]] again in [[1957]]. They spent many years in the Yorkshire Leagues during the 1960s and 1970s, and then became a founding member of the new [[Northern Counties East Football League]] in 1982. The club was looking to climb the newly instated [[English football league system|football pyramid]] and so began to improve their ground, installing [[floodlight]]s. They played a friendly to mark the occasion against [[Leeds United]], with [[Eddie Gray (footballer)|Eddie Gray]] being the first to switch the lights on.

After a West Riding County Cup win in 1986, and five seasons in the Northern Counties East league, they became founding members of the [[Northern Premier League First Division]] in 1987-88, after having been invited to join the new league. In 1990 the club became a Limited Company in order to fund the construction of a new main stand, and in the same year the club won the [[Northern Premier League First Division Cup]] under the captaincy of club stalwart Paul Williamson. They would spend fifteen seasons in this league, and on two occasions the club only narrowly avoided relegation back to the [[Northern Counties East Football League]].  Finally being promoted after the 2001-02 season, Manager John Reed led the club into the [[Northern Premier League Premier Division]]. During their first season in that division they finished sixth, and for the first time in the club's history they reached the First Round proper of the [[FA Cup]], bowing out 5-1 to Farnborough Town of the Football Conference. Town also won the West Riding County Cup in both the 2001-02 and 2002-03 seasons.

They became founders of the newly established [[Conference North]] League, which feeds into the Conference National League, in 2004. During the first seaon they finished an impressive sixth, and the following season in 2005-06 they finished fifth winning entry into the Conference North play-offs; they lost the Play-Off Semi-Final 1-0 to the eventual Play-Off winners [[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]]. 

During their FA Cup run in the 2005-06 season, Harrogate were drawn to play away at [[Torquay United]], their first ever cup game against Football League opposition. The game was played on Saturday [[5 November]] and Harrogate achieved a 1-1 draw at Plainmoor to reach the 2nd round draw for the first ever time. In the replay on Tuesday [[15 November]] at Wetherby Road, Torquay United won 6-5 on penalties after the game finished 0-0 after extra-time. The crowd was a record with a capacity 3,300 packing into the ground.

===Recent times===
The current Manager of Harrogate Town is [[Neil Aspin]], who was appointed in January 2005. A former Town player (and coach), Aspin gained extensive Football League experience with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] and [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]. At the same time as Aspin's appointment, the job of Player/Coach was given to Lee Philpott, who had originally signed as a player in November 2004. Philpott was another player with substantial Football League experience including spells at [[Leicester City]] and [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]]. In August 2007 Philpott signed for Hinckley United as a player. The current Chairman of Harrogate Town is Bill Fotherby, the former Chief Executive and Chairman of [[Leeds United]].
