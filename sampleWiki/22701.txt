The term '''''Oriental Orthodoxy''''' refers to the communion of [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] Churches that recognize only the first four [[ecumenical council]]s — the [[First Council of Nicaea]], the [[First Council of Constantinople]], the [[First Council of Ephesus]]  and the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] — and reject the [[dogmatic definition]]s of the [[Council of Chalcedon]]. Hence, these Churches are also called '''Old Oriental Churches'''. Despite potentially confusing nomenclature, Oriental Orthodox churches are distinct from the churches that are collectively referred to as [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]. 

The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] is considered the spiritual leader of the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]]. It is to be noted that the spiritual leadership is not in the same sense understood for the one extended among the Eastern Orthodox churches to the Church of Constantinople; it is however, in the spirit of respect and honor for the Apostolic Throne of Alexandria. It does not give any prerogatives, jurisdiction or rights to the Church of Alexandria in any way as in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

==History==

The [[Schism (religion)|schism]] between Oriental Orthodoxy and what would become the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches occurred in the [[5th century]].  The separation resulted in part from the refusal of Pope Dioscorus, the patriarch of Alexandria, to accept the [[Christology|Christological]] [[dogma]]s promulgated by the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which held that [[Jesus]] has two natures &mdash; one divine and one human. This was not because the council stated that Christ has two natures, but because the council's presiders refused to confess (more than wordly) that the two natures are inseparable and united. Pope Dioscorus would accept only "of or from two natures" but not "in two natures." 

To the hierarchs who would lead the Oriental Orthodox, this was tantamount to accepting [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]]-flavored terminology, according their definition of Christology, which was founded in the Alexandrine School of Theology that advocated a formula that stressed unity of the Incarnation over all other considerations.  

The Oriental Orthodox churches were therefore often called [[Monophysite]] churches, although they reject this label, which is associated with Eutychian Monophysitism, preferring the term "non-Chalcedonian" or "[[Miaphysite]]" churches. Oriental Orthodox Churches reject the heretical Monophysite teachings of [[Eutyches]], the heretical teachings of [[Nestorius]] and the Dyophysite definition of the Council of Chalcedon.

Christology, although important, was not the only reason for the refusal of the Council of Chalcedon - political, ecclesiastical and imperial issues were hotly debated. 

In the years following Chalcedon, the patriarchs of Constantinople remained in communion with the non-Chalcedonian patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, while Rome remained out of communion with Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, and in unstable communion with Constantinople. It was not until 518 AD that the Byzantine Emperor, [[Justin I]], on the ultimatum of the Roman patriarch, demanded that the Church of the Roman Empire be Chalcedonian once and for all. Justin ordered the deposition and replacement of all anti-Chalcedonian bishops, including the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria. By 525 AD, anti-Chalcedonian Christians found themselves being persecuted by the Roman Empire; this would not end until the rise of Islam.    

In the [[20th century]], the Chalcedonian [[Schism (religion)|schism]] was not seen with the same relevance any more, and from several meetings between the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Pope]] and Patriarchs of the Oriental Orthodoxy, reconciling declarations emerged.  

{{cquote|
The confusions and schisms that occurred between their Churches in the later centuries, they realize today, in no way affect or touch the substance of their faith, since these arose only because of differences in terminology and culture and in the various formulae adopted by different theological schools to express the same matter. Accordingly, we find today no real basis for the sad divisions and schisms that subsequently arose between us concerning the doctrine of Incarnation. In words and life we confess the true doctrine concerning Christ our Lord, notwithstanding the differences in interpretation of such a doctrine which arose at the time of the Council of Chalcedon.}}
''From the common declaration of Pope [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] and HH Mar [[Ignatius Zakka I Iwas]], [[June 23]] [[1984]]''

According to the canons of the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the four Archbishops of [[Rome]], [[Alexandria]], [[Ephesus]] (later transferred to [[Constantinople]]) and [[Antioch]] were all given status as [[Pentarchy|Patriarchs]], or in other words, the Ancient Apostolic Centers of Christianity by the First Council of Nicea (predating the schism) &mdash; each of the four being responsible for those bishops and churches under his jurisdiction within his own quarter of [[Christendom]], being the [[Metropolitan Archbishop]] of the Province, (with the exception of the Archbishop or [[Patriarch of Jerusalem]], who was to be independent of all of these.)  Thus, the Archbishop of Rome (ie, the Pope of the Catholic Church) has always been held by the others to be in Communion, and fully sovereign within his own quadrant.  

The technical reason for the schism was that the Bishop of Rome excommunicated the non-Chalcedonian bishops in 451 AD for refusing to accept the "in two natures" teaching, thus declaring them to be out of communion with him, although they have continued to recognize him as an equal.  With the recent declarations, it is unclear whether the Archbishop of Rome still considers the other three to be excommunicated, or now sees them as being fully in Communion as before.

The Roman Catholic Church teaches that it is the [[One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church]] founded by [[Jesus]]. But it does not deny that the one and only, true Church of Christ exists in other churches and ecclesiastic bodies.  Vatican Council II said in its ''Dogmatic Constitution on the Church'' (''Lumen gentium'', 1964, § 15): "in some real way [non-Catholic Christians] are joined with us in the Holy Spirit, for to them too He gives His gifts and graces whereby He is operative among them with His sanctifying power."

==Geographical distribution==
{{Eastern Christianity}}
Oriental Orthodoxy is a dominant religion in [[Armenia]] (94%), the ethnically Armenian breakaway republic [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] (95%), and in [[Ethiopia]] (51%, the total Christian population being 62%), especially in two regions in [[Ethiopia]]: [[Amhara Region|Amhara]] (82%) and [[Tigray Region|Tigray]] (96%), as well as the chartered city of [[Addis Ababa]] (82%), and is also important in [[Oromia Region]] (41%). It is also one of two dominant religions in [[Eritrea]] (50%). Whereas it is a minority in [[Egypt]] (15%), [[Sudan]] (3-5% out of the 15% of total Christians), and [[Syria]] (2-3% out of the 10% of total Christians). Also in [[Kerala]], [[India]] (8% out of the 23% of Christians).  In total number of members, the Ethiopian church is the largest of all Oriental Orthodox Churches, and is second among all Orthodox Churches among Eastern and Oriental Churches (exceeded in number only by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]).

==Oriental Orthodox Communion==<!-- This section is linked from [[Panentheism]] -->

The Oriental Orthodox Communion is a group of churches within Oriental Orthodoxy which are all in [[full communion]] with each other.  The communion includes:

* The Oriental Orthodox Communion
** The [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic Church of All Armenians]]
*** The [[Catholicos of Cilicia|Armenian Apostolic Church of Cilicia]]
*** The [[List of Armenian Patriarchs of Constantinople|Armenian Apostolic Church of Constantinople]]
*** The [[List of Armenian Patriarchs of Jerusalem|Armenian Apostolic Church of Jerusalem]]
** The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]
*** The [[British Orthodox Church]] in the United Kingdom
*** The [[French Coptic Orthodox Church]] in France
** The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] 
** The [[Eritrean Orthodox Church|Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]
** The [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]  of Antioch (also known as the Syrian Orthodox Church of Antioch)
*** The [[Malankara Jacobite Syriac Orthodox Church]]
**The [[Indian Orthodox Church]]

==Assyrian Church of the East==
The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] is sometimes, although incorrectly, considered an Oriental Orthodox Church. Being largely centered in what was then the [[Persian Empire]], it separated itself administratively from the Church of the [[Roman Empire]] around AD 400, and then broke communion with the latter in reaction to the [[Council of Ephesus]] held in 431.  Additionally, the Assyrian Church venerates [[Saint]]s anathematized by the previously mentioned Church and its descendants. In addition, the Assyrian Church accepts a [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] or Nestorian-like [[Christology]] that is categorically rejected by the Oriental Orthodox Communion.
