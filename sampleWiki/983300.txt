[[image:alta2004.PNG|thumb|Alberta riding map showing the winning parties and their vote percentage in each won riding.]]
The '''Alberta general election of 2004''' was the twenty-sixth general election for the [[Provinces of Canada|province]] of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It was held on [[November 22]], [[2004]] to elect members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]].

The election was called on [[October 25]], [[2004]]. [[Premier of Alberta|Premier]] [[Ralph Klein]] decided to go to the polls earlier than the legislated deadline of March 2006. This election was held in conjunction with the [[Alberta Senate nominee election, 2004]].

When the election was called, it was expected to be anticlimactic, with Klein cruising to his fourth straight [[majority government|majority]], the tenth for his [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative Party]].

Shortly after the drop of the [[writ]]s, Klein's mother died and all parties suspended their campaigns for several days. After the campaign resumed, Klein avoided making any policy announcements and attended few events. One commentator called it "Kleinfeld: the campaign about nothing" (a reference to the television [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]''). The [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], which had hoped to hold onto the five seats it had and regain the two seats that it had lost to resignations, began to pick up momentum and became far more optimistic.

In the end, the Conservatives were re-elected, despite losing 11 seats and 15% of the popular vote. The Liberals more than doubled their seats by electing 17 MLA's on election night while dominating [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], and making strong inroads in [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]]. The [[Alberta New Democrats]] (NDP) held on to their two seats and gained two more, all in Edmonton. The Conservatives swept rural Alberta except for one seat that went to the [[Alberta Alliance]], which placed second in a number of rural ridings. The [[Green Party of Alberta|Green Party]] gained in the popular vote, jumping from 0.3% in the [[Alberta general election, 2001|2001 election]] to 2.8%, and placed third in some places. Also placing second in the riding of  [[Drayton Valley-Calmar]] ahead of the liberals, It was unable to win any seats, however. [[Alberta Social Credit Party|Social Credit]] placed third in a number of ridings, and its leader tied for second in [[Rocky Mountain House (electoral district)|Rocky Mountain House]]. The Conservative, Liberal and NDP leaders all easily held onto their own seats.

==Electoral re-distribution==
Alberta's electoral laws fix the number of legislature seats at 83. As a result of the [[Alberta Electoral Boundary Re-distribution, 2004]], [[Calgary]] gained two seats. [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] lost one seat, and one "special consideration" division was eliminated. [[Dunvegan-Central Peace]] is the sole remaining "special" division - due to its isolation, it is allowed to have a population below 75% of the provincial average. [[Lesser Slave Lake, Alberta|Lesser Slave Lake]] is now considered to be a standard [[rural]] division as its boundaries were re-drawn so that its population is slightly above 75% of the provincial average. One [[Urbanization|urbanized]] division outside Calgary and Edmonton was added, and two rural seats were eliminated.

==Political parties==
For this election, there were 11 [[political party|political parties]] registered with [[Elections Alberta]]. ''See also: [[List of political parties in Canada#Alberta|List of Alberta political parties]].''

===Parties that elected MLAs in the previous election===
''The parties are listed in descending order of number of MLAs elected in 2001.''

====Progressive Conservative Party====
Leader: [[Ralph Klein]]

In the 2001 election, the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservatives]] recorded a result that was comparable to those achieved in their years of dominance under [[Peter Lougheed]]. The [[Tories]] received 627,252 out of 1,013,152 votes cast and won 74 seats, gaining 11 seats over and above their 1997 result at the expense of the Liberals. This result was achieved due to a resurgence of the party in Edmonton, where the Tories won a majority of seats for the first time since 1982. Premier Ralph Klein easily retained his Calgary-[[Elbow River|Elbow]] seat.

On [[April 8]], [[2002]], [[Doug Griffiths]] retained the Tories' seat in [[Wainwright, Alberta|Wainwright]] in the only [[by-election]] held since the 2001 election, albeit with a substantially reduced plurality. The Tories lost only one seat since the 2001 election, after Edmonton-Norwood MLA [[Gary Masyk]] [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] to join the Alberta Alliance. As expected, the Tories nominated a full slate of candidates for the 2004 election.

====Liberal Party====
Leader: [[Kevin Taft]]

The 2001 election was generally regarded to be as a disaster for the Liberals. Although the Liberals retained [[Official Opposition]] status and received 276,854 votes, the party lost 11 seats to the Tories and won only seven seats, six of them in Edmonton. Leader [[Nancy Macbeth]] even lost her own seat in Edmonton-McClung - she resigned days after the election and was replaced by [[Ken Nicol (politician)|Ken Nicol]], the Opposition's sole representative outside the capital.

Nicol eventually resigned as MLA for Lethbridge East and as [[List of Alberta official opposition leaders|Leader of the Opposition]] to run (unsuccessfully) for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|federal election]], as did Edmonton-Ellerslie MLA [[Debby Carlson]]. These seats remained vacant through dissolution. The Liberals were led in the 2004 election by Edmonton-Riverview MLA Kevin Taft, who was elected to the position in March 2004. The Liberals had 82 candidates in the 2004 election - they were absent from the ballot in Drumheller-Stettler after failing to file papers for their expected candidate, [[Don McMann]] before the deadline.

[http://www.liberalparty.ab.ca External link]

==== New Democratic Party ====
Leader: [[Brian Mason]]

In 2001, the [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] were unable to claim Official Opposition status from the floundering Liberals, but Leader [[Raj Pannu]] managed to hold the party's two existing seats—Pannu's own in [[Edmonton—Strathcona]] and Brian Mason's seat in [[Edmonton Highlands]] (later merged into [[Edmonton Highlands-Norwood]]). The “NDs”, as they were then known, received 81,339 votes. Pannu resigned the leadership in July 2004, with Mason filling the role of interim leader before being elected to that position in September 2004. The party has also ceased abbreviating its name as "ND in favour of the more traditional “NDP” abbreviation. The NDP nominated a full slate of candidates for the 2004 election.

[http://www.albertagreens.ca/ External link]

==== Social Credit Party ====
Leader: [[Lavern Ahlstrom]]

Under Lavern Ahlstrom, the party nominated 12 candidates in the 2001 election (down from 70 in 1997), and received 5,361 votes (down from 64,667). The party had 42 candidates for the 2004 election.

[http://www.socialcredit.com External link]

==== Separation Party ====
Interim Leader: [[Bruce Hutton]]
