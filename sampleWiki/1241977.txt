The '''Mariana Mallard''' ('''''Anas oustaleti'''''<ref>
[[Etymology]]: ''Anas'', [[Ancient Greek]] for a duck. ''oustaleti'', dedicated to [[France|French]] [[zoologist]] [[Émile Oustalet]].</ref>)
or Oustalet's Gray Duck is an [[extinct]] [[species]] of [[duck]] of the [[genus]] ''Anas'' that was [[endemism|endemic]] to the [[Mariana Islands]]. It is sometimes treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[Mallard]] or the [[Pacific Black Duck]], or (erroneously) the [[Spot-billed Duck]] (as ''Anas poecilorhyncha oustaleti'').

This species is an interesting example of [[hybrid speciation]] (which is very rare in [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s), as it is apparently derived from migrating individuals of the Mallard (''A. p. platyrhynchos'') and the [[Australasian Black Duck]] (''A. s. rogersi'') which settled down and became resident on the [[Marianas]]. The speciation process has only started in comparatively recent time (thousands of years maybe) and neither Mariana Mallards nor their progenitor species are known from fossils on the Marianas, casting into doubt the assumption that a resident Black Duck population had been long established on the islands.<ref>
Note however that most [[rock shelter]]s and caves on the Marianas were obliterated in [[Battle of Guam (1944)|World War II]] (Steadman 2006).</ref>
A species of flightless duck known from a prehistoric bone found on [[Rota (island)|Rota]] in [[1994]] (Steadman, 1999) was apparently not closely related to the Recent birds.

The [[IUCN]], among others, does not consider the Mariana Mallard a proper species yet and thus does not include it in its [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|redlist]]. However, as the population constituted a distinct, established and independent evolutionary unit (although not yet phenotypically homogenized), it was at least an incipient species. If considered specifically distinct, it was one of the most short-lived [[vertebrate]] species known to science, existing for a few 10.000 years at most from the fist hybridization event to its extinction.

Local names are '''''ngånga' (palao)''''' in [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] and '''''ghereel'bwel''''' in [[Carolinian language|Carolinian]]. The [[binomial]] of this species commemorates the [[France|French]] zoologist [[Emile Oustalet]].

==Description==
Mariana Mallards were 51-56 cm long and weighed approximately one kilogram, making them marginally smaller than mallards. Two intergrading color [[Morph (zoology)|morphs]] were found in males, called the "platyrhynchos" and the "superciliosa" type after the species they resembled more.

Only the former had a distinct [[nuptial plumage|nuptial]] (breeding) plumage: the head was green as in mallard drakes, but less glossy, with some buff feathers on the sides, a dark brown eyestripe and a faint whitish ring at the base of the neck. The upper breast was dark ruddish chestnut brown with blackish-brown spots. The wing patch ([[speculum feathers|speculum]]) and the tail was also like in mallard drakes' nuptial plumage, including curled-up central tail feathers, but the tips of the speculum feathers were buff. The underside was a mix between the vermiculated grey feathers of the mallard and the brown ones of the Pacific Black Duck. The remainder of the bird looked like a male Pacific Black Duck with lighter underwings. The bill was black at the base and olive at the tip, the feet reddish orange with darker webs and the iris brown. The [[eclipse plumage]] looked similar to a dark eclipse mallard drake.<br>
Males of the "superciliosa" type resembled an [[Island Black Duck]] with a less distinctly marked head, the [[supercilium]] and cheeks being buffy and the cheek (malar) stripe hardly visible. The upper breast, flank and [[scapula]]r feathers had broader buff edges, and the underwings were lighter. The speculum was usually as in the "platyrhynchos" type, i.e. mallard-like, but at least two specimens have the green speculum of the Pacific Black Duck. The bill was like that of ''A. superciliosa'', and the iris and legs similar to the "platyrhynchos" type.

Females looked essentially like a dark mallard female with the orange of the feet and near the bill tip usually a bit more pure.

Ducklings were probably intermediate in plumage between the two progenitor species, somewhat duller than mallard or somewhat more vivdly colored than Pacific Black Duck downy young.
<!-- should be correct, but check Philips, J.C. (1923): "A natural history of the ducks, vol. 2" to be able to remove "probably" -->

The voice can be assumed to have resembled the Mariana Mallard's parent species'; possibly, the females' quacking was hoarser than in the mallard.

==Distribution==
It occurred, in recent times at least, on the islands of [[Guam]], [[Saipan]] and [[Tinian]]. Madge & Burn (1988) mention a report of 2 unidentified ducks seen on Rota in [[1945]], but as no movement of ''A. oustaleti'' between Saipan and Tinian, which are just 8 km apart, was recorded (Kuroda, 1941-42), these were probably vagrant migrating ducks, although Marshall (1949) suspected from circumstantial evidence that such movement did indeed take place. However, the distance between Guam and Rota is nearly 80 km, making intentional migration between these islands not likely.

==Ecology==
The Mariana Mallard inhabited wetlands, mostly inland but occasionally also in coastal areas. On Guam, it was most abundant in the [[Talofofo River]] valley, on Tinian on [[Lake Hagoi]] and Lake Makpo (now [[Makpo Swamp]]) before it was drained, and on Saipan on the [[Garpan lagoon]] and on and around [[Lake Susupe]]. The birds were rather reclusive, preferring sheltered [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] with plenty of wetland/water plants - [[fern]] ''[[Acrostichum aureum]]'' thickets and ''[[Scirpus]]'', ''[[Cyperus]]'' and ''[[Phragmites|Phragmites (australis) karka]]'' [[reed bed]]s, as described in detail by Tenorio ''et al.'' (1979) and Stemmermann (1981) -, where they also nested. Usually, pairs or small flocks were encountered, but in the key habitats larger groups of dozens and rarely up to 50-60 individuals could be found. Apart from possible inter-island movement, the birds were not migratory.

Feeding and reproduction is not well documented, but cannot expected to differ significantly from its immediate relatives: The birds fed on aquatic [[invertebrates]], small [[vertebrates]] and plants and although up-ending was not observed, they probably utilized it too.

Breeding was recorded from at least January to July, with a peak in June/July at the end of the dry season. One male specimen taken in October was also in breeding condition (Marshall, 1949); thus, the birds may have bred nealy year-round at least on occasion. Unfortunately, the courtship behavior, which in the strongly [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] mallard is focused more on presentation of visual cues than in the monomorphic Pacific Black Duck (although it is generally similar in both species), was never recorded. The [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] consisted of 7-12 pale grey-green oval eggs measuring 61.6 x 38.9 mm on average (Kuroda, 1941-42). Males took no part in incubation, which lasted around 28 days, and caring for the ducklings. The young fledged when c. 8 weeks old and became sexually mature the following year.

==Extinction==
The birds declined due to draining of wetlands for agriculture and construction. Hunting pressure was probably heavy, despite a ban on gun ownership under Japanese control ([[1914]]-[[1945]]), as the birds were unwary to be trapped, and at any rate the gun ban was lifted after [[World War II]] (see also below). By the [[1940s]], flocks of more than a dozen birds were seldom seen. On Guam, the last sightings were in [[1949]] and [[1967]] - the latter being a single, possibly vagrant, bird - and on Tinian in [[1974]]. As Lake Susupe offered the most plentiful and least accessible habitat, although it too suffered from pollution by sugar mill wastes, the Saipan population lingered on for a few more years. The Mariana Mallard was listed as [[Endangered Species Act|federally endangered]] on [[June 2]], [[1977]] (United States Government, 1977). In [[1979]], two males and a female were found on Saipan and caught; one male was later released, the last wild bird ever to be encountered. The pair was brought to [[Pohakuloa]], [[Hawai‘i]], and later to [[SeaWorld]], [[San Diego]], where it was attempted to have them reproduce in captivity. However, this was unsuccessful and the species became extinct with the death of the last individual in [[1981]]. Surveys were conducted in the following years, but the species was certainly gone by then. It was removed from the [[Fish and Wildlife Service|USFWS]] Endangered Species List on [[February 23]], [[2004]], due to extinction (United States Government, 2004).

Collection of specimens for museums and private collections must have had a temporary impact during the Japanese control over the islands. Although less than 100 specimens are on record, most were taken in the [[1930s]] and [[1940s]] for Japanese collectors; given the rather sedentary habits and small population size of the species, this may have jeopardized local populations to the point of extinction. Outside Japan, 7 specimens (including the [[type (zoology)|type]]) are in the [[MNHN]], [[Paris]], one in the [[Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum]], [[Tring]], two in the [[Smithsonian Institution|USNM]], [[Washington D.C.]] and six in the [[AMNH]], [[New York City]] (FWIE-VTU, 1996). Greenway (1967) mentions additional specimens in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and [[Lisbon]].

=="New Zealand Mallard"==
The evolutionary lineage of the Mariana Mallard was terminated by its extinction. However, a similar hybrid population is found in many locations of [[New Zealand]], particularly around urban areas. The parents of these hybrids are the native [[New Zealand Black Duck]]s and introduced mallards which spread with increasing land clearance after the [[1950s]]. In some areas, hybrids make up over half the population by now (Gillespie, 1985). According to Rhymer ''et al.'' (1994), "[t]he speciation process appears to be undergoing reversal." Their study shows that the more colorful mallards drakes, somewhat surprisingly, contribute less to the [[gene pool]]. In [[dabbling ducks]], speciation is mainly driven by behavioral and morphological cues, namely the drakes' plumage and courtship displays, and the females' vocalizations. Many ''Anas'' species probably separated less than 100.000 years ago, and with hybridization not infrequent among these ducks, molecular barriers eliminating [[gene flow]] have not yet become established. The cases of the Mariana Mallard and the New Zealand hybrids illustrate well how under certain circumstances even the behavioral barriers may break down. It could be said that these cases represent [[evolution]] running at the same time both "backwards" - as separated species merge again - and "forward" - as a distinct new lifeform is produced in this process, which does probably ''not'' resemble the mid-/late [[Pleistocene]] mallard/Pacific black duck common ancestor, and certainly is not equivalent to it genetically because of the evolutionary changes both species have undergone since their separation.
