'''Seona Dancing''' (pronounced as "Shawna Dancing") was a 1980s [[Music of the United Kingdom (1980s)|British]] [[pop music|pop]] group best known for providing [[Ricky Gervais]] with his first taste of fame.

The band was formed in 1982 by aspiring pop stars [[Bill Macrae]] and Ricky Gervais. They were signed to [[London Records]]. Their single "More to Lose," released in 1983, made it only to number 70 on the [[UK]] charts. The followup, "Bitter Heart," reached number 79 on the [[UK]] charts. The group quickly disbanded in 1984. A year later, in 1985, a DJ from 99.5 DWRT-FM in [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]], started playing a song called "Fade" by Medium (also billed as "Medium" by Fade). It became a runaway hit and a favorite theme song for many [[Filipino people|Filipino]] teenagers in the mid-1980s.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:60psa9tgw23u~T1 Michael Sutton on All Music Guide]</ref> Eventually, the identity of the song was revealed as "More to Lose" by Seona Dancing. Bill Macrae faded into obscurity, however [[Ricky Gervais]] has had quite a successful career, as he is now an [[Emmy]], [[Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA]] award-winning comic writer and performer. He is mostly known as the co-writer and star of the successful hit [[BBC]] [[British sitcom|comedy]] ''[[The Office]]'', and recently'' [[Extras (sitcom)|Extras]]''. He is also a stand-up comedian.

Former members of the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[New Wave music|New Wave]]/[[Alternative rock]] band [[Half Life Half Death]], Alfie Vera Mella (on vocals and keyboards) and Rain Paggao (on guitar) collaborated in [[2006 in music|2006]] and recorded their version of "More to Lose." Perhaps one of, if not the only Seona Dancing cover to be recorded, the piece is included in Paggao's project, an album entitled ''Songs for Moonlit Nights'' by The Rain (2006, Independent).
