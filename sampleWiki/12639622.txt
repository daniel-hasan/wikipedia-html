[[Image:Haka 2006.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The [[All Blacks]] performing a [[Haka of the All Blacks|haka]] prior to a Test against [[France national rugby union team|France]] in 2006.]]'''[[France national rugby union team|France]]''' and '''[[All Blacks|New Zealand]]'s''' national teams have been playing each other in Test '''[[rugby union]]''' since 1906. New Zealand's team, known as the All Blacks, won the first Test between the countries 38&ndash;8 on [[1 January]] [[1906]]. This was also France's first ever Test. They played again in 1924, and then in 1954. The 1954 match was won 3&ndash;0 by France and was their first victory over the All Blacks. 

France first toured New Zealand in 1961 &mdash; before any of the [[Home Nations]] &mdash; and the All Blacks won all three Tests. The All Blacks' first ever full tour of France was in 1977,{{ref label|Fulltour|i|i}} when they won both Tests. France achieved their first ever victory over the All Blacks in New Zealand on [[Bastille Day]] 1979. The teams also met at the inaugural [[Rugby World Cup]] final in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]], which was won by the All Blacks 29&ndash;9. A first series win in New Zealand was achieved by France in 1994 when they won both Tests. In [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]] the teams again met in the World Cup, but this time in the semi-finals. The match was hosted at [[Twickenham Stadium]], where France overcame a 24&ndash;10 deficit to win 43&ndash;31. Since 2000 the two teams have contested the [[Dave Gallaher Trophy]] which the All Blacks won in 2000 and have never lost. They last met during the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007 World Cup]] quarter-finals at [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]] which France won 20&ndash;18.

Overall the All Blacks have won 34 Tests, France 11, with one drawn. The highest victory between the countries was achieved when the All Blacks won 61&ndash;10 at Westpac Stadium in 2007. The most career points scored by members of either team is 92 by [[Andrew Mehrtens]]; he also holds the record for points in one match with 29.

==History==
===Early meetings===
[[Image:1905-All-Blacks-.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[The Original All Blacks]] that toured the Northern Hemisphere and played against France in their first ever Test match.]]
The first ever All Blacks tour to the northern hemisphere occurred in 1905&ndash;06. The team &mdash; known as [[The Original All Blacks]] &mdash; played throughout the [[British Isles]] before playing France on [[1 January]] [[1906]]. The Test was France's first ever, and was held at [[Parc des Princes]], [[Paris]].<ref name="ABGame88">{{cite web| url=http://stats.allblacks.com/teamsheet.asp?level1=All_Blacks&Level2=ABC&MT_ID=1088 |title=8th All Black Test : 88th All Black Game |publisher=allblacks.com |accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> The All Blacks scored ten tries, including six in the second half, to France's two, and eventually won 38&ndash;8. Despite the scoreline, France's two tries were more any team had scored against the All Blacks on tour at that time.<ref name="RugbyMuseumO">{{cite web| url=http://www.rugbymuseum.co.nz/asp/container_pages/normal_menu/rmArticle.asp?IDID=150 |title=THE 1905/06 'ORIGINALS' |publisher=rugbymuseum.co.nz |accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> Following the Test in ''The Complete Rugby Footballer'', Original All Blacks [[Dave Gallaher]] and [[Billy Stead]] wrote of French rugby; "We are strongly of the opinion that the game will spread in their country and that in the course of time they will put a team in the field which will command the utmost respect of any other."<ref name="ABGame88"/>

The next Test between the two teams was on the All Blacks' ''Invincibles''' tour of 1924/1925. They met at [[Stade Des Ponts Jumeaux]] in [[Toulouse]] on [[18 January]] [[1925]].<ref name='ABGame201">{{cite web| url=http://stats.allblacks.com/teamsheet.asp?level1=All_Blacks&Level2=ABC&MT_ID=1201 |title=31st All Black Test : 201st All Black Game |publisher=allblacks.com |accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref> Although French rugby had advanced since 1906, the All Blacks still won 30&ndash;6; with France scoring two tries. All Blacks' captain [[Cliff Porter]] said of France "Your forwards gave us a lot of bother. Your three-quarters were not so good."<ref name="Potter175">Potter (1961), pg 175.</ref> Due to the [[International Rugby Board|International Rugby Football Board]] (IRB) expelling France from the [[Six Nations Championship|Five Nations Championship]] during the 1930s for professionalism in its domestic club competition, the All Blacks did not face France during their tour of the British Isles in 1935. Although France was readmitted into international competition in 1939, due to the Second World War they did not play the All Blacks again until 1954. France also played New Zealand teams when they faced the [[New Zealand Maori]] in 1926 and the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]]'s Kiwis twice in 1946; France lost all three matches.<ref name="Potter102">Potter (1961), pg 102.</ref>

===Post war===
The 1954 match at [[Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir|Stade Colombes]], [[Paris]] was dominated by the All Blacks with the majority of possession and territory.<ref name="Potter102"/> Despite this, France scored in the 35th minute after the ball was lost by All Blacks' {{Half-back}} Keith Davis 40&nbsp;metres from the France's line. The ball was picked up by French {{Number 8}} Robert Baulon who passed to Paul Labadie. Labadie then passed to French captain [[Jean Prat]] who scored a try with several All Blacks attempting to tackle him. The score gave France a 3&ndash;0 lead that the All Blacks never caught.<ref name="Potter103">Potter (1961), pg 103.</ref> Despite attacking the French line for much of the game, and having several drop-goal and penalty attempts, the All Blacks could not score and the French defence held. The final score of 3&ndash;0 earned France their first win over the All Blacks.

France first toured New Zealand in 1961 &mdash; before any of the [[Home nation|home nations]].<ref name="Palenski51">Palenski (2003), pg 51.</ref> The first Test at [[Eden Park]] was won 13&ndash;6 by the All Blacks after they scored two converted tries and a penalty. France's {{First five-eighth}} Pierre Albaladejo kicked all of France's points with two drop goals.<ref name="ABGame483">{{cite web| url=http://stats.allblacks.com/teamsheet.asp?level1=All_Blacks&Level2=ABC&MT_ID=1482 |title=105th All Black Test : 483rd All Black Game |publisher=stats.allblacks.com |date=2007-07-22}}</ref> As a result he became known in New Zealand as "Monsieur Drop".<ref name="Polenski51">Palenski (2003), pg 51.</ref> The second Test of the tour was played at [[Athletic Park]] in [[Wellington]].<ref name="ABGame484">{{cite web| url=http://stats.allblacks.com/teamsheet.asp?level1=All_Blacks&Level2=ABC&MT_ID=1483 |title=106th All Black Test : 484th All Black Game |publisher=stats.allblacks.com |date=2007-07-22}}</ref> The wind was very strong and there was no scoring in the first half. In the second, and playing into the wind, France scored a try to lead 3&ndash;0. The All Blacks then responded with a try to [[Kel Tremain]] which was converted by [[Don Clarke]]. The conversion was considered one of the best of Clarke's career, as he needed to aim the kick almost parallel to the goal-line and hope that the wind would take it over the posts. The Blacks won 5&ndash;3.<ref name="Polanski52">Palenski (2003), pg 52.</ref> Despite the All Blacks winning the final Test in [[Christchurch]] 32&ndash;3 to win the series, it did have a positive influence in France where it was broadcast on to television via satellite. This helped promote the sport outside its traditional French heartland of the southwest.<ref name="Dine131">Dine (2001), pg 131.</ref>

The next two matches between the teams were both in Paris. The All Blacks won the first 12&ndash;3 in 1964 after tries to Ralph Caulton and Ken Gray. In the next match, in 1967, the All Blacks were coached by [[Fred Allen]] and captained by [[Brian Lochore]]; they won 21&ndash;15.<ref name="Palenski52">Palenski (2003), pg 52.</ref> Following their first ever Five Nations [[Grand Slam (Rugby Union)|Grand Slam]] in 1968, France toured New Zealand and Australia that year. France lost all four Tests on tour, three of those against the All Blacks. France faced an All Blacks side that did not lose between 1965 and 1970,<ref name="Palenski52"/> and their losses on tour preluded successive Test losses until their draw with Wales in the 1969 Five Nations where France finished last.<ref name="Dine154">Dine (2001), pg 154.</ref>

===Full tours===
France achieved only their second Test victory over the All Blacks in 1973 at [[Parc des Princes]], [[Paris]].<ref name="ABGame656">{{cite web| url=http://stats.allblacks.com/teamsheet.asp?level1=All_Blacks&Level2=ABC&MT_ID=1656 |title=158th All Black Test : 656th All Black Game |accessdate=2007-07-30 |publisher=allblacks.com}}</ref> The All Blacks had defeated England, Scotland and Wales, and drawn with Ireland on their 1973 tour and France was their last Test. France won 13&ndash;6.<ref name="Palenski53">Palenski (2003), pg 53.</ref> In 1977 the All Blacks made their first ever full tour of France. France won the first Test in Toulouse and the All Blacks the second in France.<ref name="Palenski53"/> France then reciprocated and toured in 1979. This time neutral referees were appointed for the first time. The All Blacks won the first Test 23&ndash;9 at Lancaster Park. However  in the second Test France upset the All Blacks by winning 24&ndash;19 on [[Bastille Day]] at Eden Park. The victory was France's first over the All Blacks in New Zealand.<ref name="Palenski55">Palenski (2003), pg 55.</ref>

The teams' first meeting of the 1980s was in 1981 when the All Blacks toured France. They played Tests in Toulouse and Paris; the All Blacks winning them both, 13&ndash;9 and 18&ndash;6 respectively. France then visited New Zealand in 1984 for two Tests. The first was lost 10&ndash;9 at Lancaster Park despite repeated drop-goal attempts from the French. The second at Eden park was also lost by France. France next played a one off Test in New Zealand in 1986. The match was at Lancaster Park, and due to the rebel Cavaliers tour to South Africa, most of the top All Blacks were banned for two matches. Hence the All Blacks team that played France were known at the "Baby Blacks" as all bar two of them were either making their Test début or were very inexperienced.<ref name="GordonMacpherson">{{cite web| title=Gordon Macpherson |publisher=allblacks.com |accessdate=2007-08-02 |url=http://stats.allblacks.com/Profile.asp?ABID=524 }}</ref> The Baby Blacks upset France 18&ndash;9 in front of 24,000 spectators; the only try coming from {{Number 8}} [[Mike Brewer (rugby player)|Mike Brewer]].<ref name="ABGame854">{{cite web| url=http://stats.allblacks.com/teamsheet.asp?level1=All_Blacks&Level2=ABC&MT_ID=1854 |title=220th All Black Test : 854th All Black Game |publisher=allblacks.com |accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref> Later that year the All Blacks toured France, and played a Test in Toulouse that they won 19&ndash;7. Their next match at Nantes became known as "the battle of Nantes".<ref name="Palenski61">Palenski (2003), pg 61.</ref> France played aggressively and tried to intimidate the All Blacks. All Black [[Buck Shelford]] had his scrotum rucked in the twentieth minute that required stitches while he was still on the field.

The following year France and the All Blacks met in the final of the [[1987 Rugby World Cup|inaugural]] [[Rugby World Cup]]. The tournament was co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia and the final was held at Eden Park. According to the All Blacks' coach at the time, [[Brian Lochore]], the previous year's loss in Nantes was the catalyst for their World Cup victory.<ref name="NantesCatalyst">{{cite news| title=A HUNDRED GREAT YEARS |publisher=Dominion Post |date=[[2006-11-18]] |last=Smith |first=Tony |page=3}}</ref> Shelford said of the match "We wanted to play them in the final because we wanted revenge".<ref name="NantesRevenge">{{cite news| title=BUCK VERSUS THE BRUTES |publisher=Dominion Post |date=[[2006-11-10]] |page=6 |last=Kayes |first=Jim}}</ref> The match also helped improve the diplomatic and political rift between France and New Zealand caused by the 1985 [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|bombing]] of the [[Rainbow Warrior]] by [[Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure|French Secret Service]] agents.<ref name="Dine136">Dine (2001), pg 136.</ref>

France toured New Zealand in 1989 and played a two Test series. They lost both Tests; the first 25&ndash;17 at Lancaster Park, and the second 34&ndash;20 at Eden Park. The All Blacks reciprocated by touring France in 1990. Again there were two Tests and again they were won by the All Blacks; 24&ndash;3 at Nantes, and 30&ndash;12 at the Parc de Princes. The next tour was when France came to New Zealand in 1994. They won the first Test 22&ndash;8 at Lancaster Park. The second and final Test on tour was at Eden Park on [[3 July]] 1994. The All Blacks were winning 20&ndash;16 with three minutes remaining after [[Matthew Cooper (rugby)|Matthew Cooper]] had kicked a penalty.<ref name="NantesCatalyst"/> The French counter-attacked however, and from their own in-goal area ran the ball the length of the field to win. The ball was handled by nine French players before the try was scored by [[Jean-Luc Sadourny]].<ref name="EndofWorld">{{cite news| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3ce65378-106e-11dc-96d3-000b5df10621.html |publisher=ft.com |title=Eden Park sees start of turf war |date=[[2007-06-01]] |last=Huw |first=Richards |accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> French captain [[Philippe Saint-Andre]] called it "a counter-attack from the end of the world",<ref name="NantesCatalyst"/> and it was then labelled ''the try from the end of the world''.<ref name="GreatTries">{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2003/01/30/srtry30.xml |publisher=telegraphy.co.uk |title=Edwards settles the score  |date=[[2003-01-03]] |last=Gallagher |first=Brendan |accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> The try gave France a 23&ndash;20 win and a 2&ndash;0 series win over the All Blacks.

===Professional era===
A record was set when France defeated the All Blacks at Toulouse on [[11 November]] 1995; they had achieved their greatest winning streak against the All Blacks of three consecutive Tests. The following week on [[November 18]] the All Blacks stopped the streak with a 37&ndash;12 victory. The two teams did not meet again until 1999 when France played the All Blacks in a one off Test at Athletic Park. The All Blacks won 54&ndash;7; at the time France's largest ever loss.<ref name="ABGame1044">{{cite web| url=http://stats.allblacks.com/teamsheet.asp?MT_ID=2044 |title=326th All Black Test : 1044th All Black Game |publisher=allblacks.com |accessdate=2007-08-06 }}</ref> [[Tana Umaga]] scored three tries in the match and [[Andrew Mehrtens]] kicked 19 points in the match.<ref name="ABGame1044"/> 

[[Image:France All Blacks 16-11-2002.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The All Blacks playing France in 2002.]]Due to their Athletic Park victory the All Blacks were heavy favourites to win when they met France in the semi-finals of the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]].<ref name="1999Favourites">{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/rugby/1999/world_cup/news/1999/10/31/newzealand_france/ |title='Les Bleus' blacken New Zealand's campaign |date=[[1999-10-31]] |accessdate=2007-08-06 |publisher=sportsillustrated.cnn.com}}</ref> The game was played at the neutral venue of [[Twickenham Stadium]] on [[31 October]] 1999.

Lamaison had scored 28 points, and a ''full house'' &mdash; a try, conversion, penalty and drop-goal all in one match.<ref name="1999Favourites"/>

The [[Dave Gallaher Trophy]] was introduced in 2000 to be contested between the two teams. It was named in memory of All Blacks captain Dave Gallaher who captained the All Blacks against France in 1906 and who died at [[Passchendaele]].<ref name="GallaherTrophy">{{cite web| url=http://www.masseyrugby.com/content/view/63/2/ |title=The Gallaher Cup is on a six month train ride around France. |publisher=masseyrugby.com |accessdate=2007-08-06 |date=[[2006-05-17]]}}</ref> The Cup was first contested [[Armistice Day]] ([[November 11]]) 2000.

The countries met in each year in a one off Test in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The 2001 Test was won 37&ndash;12 by the All Blacks, the 2002 Test was a 20 all draw and in 2003 the All Blacks won 31&ndash;23 at [[Jade Stadium]]. They met again in 2003 at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|Rugby World Cup]] in [[Sydney]]. The match was a third-fourth play-off game and was won 40&ndash;13 by the All Blacks. In 2004 they met in a one off Test in Paris. The 2004 Test was the first between the two teams with [[Graham Henry]] as All Blacks coach.

==Notes==
<div class="references-small"<!-- style="-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;"--> >
:{{note|Fulltouri|i}}: A full tour, rather than tour, is when the All Blacks tour France alone, rather than as an extension of a tour to the [[Home Nations]]. The 1977 All Blacks tour to France consisted of nine matches, including two Tests.<ref name="1977Tour">{{cite web| url=http://stats.allblacks.com/tourbreak.asp?IDID=77 |title=All Blacks Player Profiles, Match Details and Statistics&mdash;in France |publisher=allblacks.com |accessdate=2007-10-25}}</ref>
