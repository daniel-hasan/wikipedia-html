Infection with '''Group B Streptococcus''' (GBS), also known as '''[[Streptococcus agalactiae]]''', can cause serious illness and sometimes [[death]], especially in newborn infants and the elderly. Group B streptococci are also important [[pathogen]]s in veterinary [[medicine]], because they can cause bovine [[mastitis]] ([[inflammation]] of the [[udder]]) in dairy cows. The species name "agalactiae" meaning "no milk", alludes to this.

[[Streptococcus]] is a [[genus]] of [[spherical]], [[Gram-positive]] bacteria of the [[phylum]] [[Firmicutes]]. [[Streptococcus agalactiae]] is a [[gram-positive]] streptococcus characterized by the presence of Group B [[Rebecca Lancefield|Lancefield antigen]], and so takes the name Group B Streptococcus. 

==Perinatal disease==

GBS is a member of the normal [[gut flora|flora of the gut]] and female [[urogenital]] tract, so many women are [[asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]s of this bacterium without knowing it. GBS [[colonization]] can be [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] or intermittent.

GBS bacteria can be passed from a [[pregnant]] women to her baby during [[childbirth|labor]], if she is a [[asymptomatic carrier|carrier]] of the bacteria. 

===[[Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease]]=== 
One out of every four women are colonized with GBS in the vagina or rectum.<ref name="cdcwebsite">

Toward the end of a pregnancy at an [[antenatal]] appointment, the [[vagina]] and [[rectum]] are swabbed and cultures grown . Treatment of [[Group B Streptococcus|GBS]] positive women with intravenous penicillin at the onset of labour reduces early neonatal infection.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Cochrane 2000: CD000115}}</ref>. After birth the baby is given a course of antibiotics immediatly. Evidence based research studies show that using this test can reduce infant [[infection]]s. In many centers if a woman presents late in her [[prenatal]] period then there may be no time to grow cultures prior to labour. In this situation some clinicians advocate [[empirical]] antibiotic cover of mother and baby.

===Perinatal GBS disease prevention===
Through collaborative efforts clinicians, researchers, professional organizations, parent [[advocacy groups]], and the [[public health]] community developed recommendations for intrapartum [[prophylaxis]] to prevent Perinatal GBS disease. Many organizations have developed [[Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease|Perinatal GBS disease]] [[prevention]] and education programs to reduce the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of the disease. Information about the recommendations and the prevention programs can be found in [[medical journal]]s and on the [[internet]].
