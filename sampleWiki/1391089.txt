'''Sai Ying Pun''' is a proposed [[List of Hong Kong MTR stations|station]] on the [[Hong Kong]] [[MTR]] {{HK-MTR lines|Island}} serving the neighbourhood of [[Sai Ying Pun]] in northwestern [[Hong Kong Island]], [[Hong Kong]].

Under the latest proposal as of June [[2005]], Sai Ying Pun will serve as a station on the proposed extension of the Island line known as [[West Island Line (MTR)|West Island Line]], as opposed to a transfer station to another line serving the [[Southern District, Hong Kong|Southern District]] with the same name as in previous plans.

The station appeared in ''Hong Kong Mass Transit: Further Studies'' in [[1970]]. It was to be built as part of the Island Line in the [[1980]]s, but construction of the line did not commence westwards beyond [[Sheung Wan (MTR)|Sheung Wan]], citing inadequate passengers and technical difficulties by contractors.

==Proposed locations==
In [http://www.ozp.tpb.gov.hk/pdf/S_H3_20_e.pdf Outline Zoning Plan No. S/H3/20], the Planning Department of the government has indicated one possible location under [[Des Voeux Road]] West at [[Ko Shing Street]] as of December [[2003]]. A ventilation shaft marked with MTR notices can be found at the intersection. A large void facing Des Voeux Road West, sealed, can also be found at a nearby medical centre, which some have speculated that it was reserved for a to-be-built exit. These findings suggest that this was the original proposed location.

However, in [http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/extensions/WIL&SIL_Summary.pdf#page=2 proposals submitted to the government] by the MTR in May [[2002]], the proposed station was shifted further west to the intersection of Des Voeux Road West and [[Water Street, Hong Kong|Water Street]].

In March [[2004]], the MTR moved the station back east but south of the initial alignment under [[King George V Memorial Park, Hong Kong|King George V Memorial Park]]. Source from [[MTR Corporation Limited]] (MTRCL) revealed to the local newspaper [[Ming Pao]] that this location was chosen to avoid any nuisance during works under major roads. The location would also better suit the needs of [[Mid-Levels]] residents, the source said.

==Suggested design==
===Platforms===
All information in this section is subject to change by [[MTR Corporation]]. Platform numbering are only speculations according to the current scheme used on other Island Line stations.
*<font color="blue">'''Platform 1'''</font>: Island Line to Chai Wan
*<font color="blue">'''Platform 2'''</font>: Island Line to Kennedy Town

Platform 1 will share the same concourse as platform 2.
