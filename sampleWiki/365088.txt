'''Mauthausen''' (known from the summer of 1940 as '''Mauthausen-Gusen''') grew to become a large group of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]s that were built around the [[village]]s of [[Mauthausen]] and [[Gusen]] in [[Upper Austria]], roughly 20 km east of the city of [[Linz]].

==History==
=== KZ Mauthausen ===

On [[August 7]], [[1938]], prisoners from [[Dachau concentration camp]] were sent to the town of Mauthausen near [[Linz]], [[Austria]], to begin the construction of a new camp. The location was chosen due to its proximity to the transport hub of Linz, but also because the area was sparsely populated.<ref name="Dobosiewicz"/> Although the camp was, from the beginning of its existence, controlled by the German state, it was founded by a private company as an economic enterprise. The owner of the Wiener-Graben quarry (the Marbacher-Bruch, and Bettelberg quarries), which was located in and around Mauthausen, was a [[DEST]] Company: an acronym for ''Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke GmbH''. The company, led by [[Oswald Pohl]], who was also a high-ranking official of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], bought the quarries from the city of [[Vienna]] and started the construction of the Mauthausen camp. A year later, the company ordered the construction of the first camp at Gusen. The [[granite]] mined in the quarries had previously been used to pave the streets of Vienna, but the Nazi authorities envisioned a complete reconstruction of major German towns in accordance with the plans of [[Albert Speer]] and other architects of [[Nazi architecture]],<ref name=Speer">{{en icon}} {{cite book|author =[[Albert Speer]] | title =Inside The Third Reich | year =1970 | publisher =The Macmillan Company | location =New York | isbn =0-88365-924-7}}</ref> for which large quantities of granite were needed.

The money needed for the construction of the Mauthausen camp was gathered from a variety of sources, including commercial loans from [[Dresdner Bank]] and [[Prague]]-based [[Escompte Bank]], the so-called [[Reinhardt's fund]] (meaning money stolen from the inmates of the concentration camps themselves); and from the [[German Red Cross]].<ref name="Dobosiewicz"/><ref name="Red Cross">Oswald Pohl, apart from being a high-ranking SS member, owner of DEST and several other companies, chief of administration and treasurer of various Nazi organizations, was also the managing director of the [[German Red Cross]]. In 1938, he transferred 8,000,000 RM from member fees to one of the accounts of the SS (SS-Spargemeinschaft e. V.), which in turn donated all the money to DEST in 1939.</ref>

Mauthausen initially served as a strictly-run prison camp for common criminals, prostitutes<ref name="Żeromski">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =Tadeusz Żeromski | title =Międzynarodówka straceńców | year =1983 | pages = 76+| publisher =Książka i Wiedza | location =Warsaw | id =ISBN 83-05-11175-X }}</ref> and other categories of "Incorrigible Law Offenders".<ref name="Heydrich">As stated in [[Reinhard Heydrich]]'s memo of [[January 1]], [[1941]]; in: Dobosiewicz, Stanisław, op.cit., p.12</ref> On [[May 8]], [[1939]] it was converted to a labour camp which was mainly used for the incarceration of political prisoners.<ref name="Marsalek">{{de icon}} {{cite book|author =[[Hans Maršálek]] | title =Die Geschichte des Konzentrationslagers Mauthausen (History of Mauthausen Concentration Camp) | year =1995 | publisher =Österreichischen Lagergemeinschaft Mauthausen u.

===KL Gusen===
[[Image:GusenII aerial.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Aerial view of the Gusen I & II camps]]
In late 1939, the Mauthausen camp, with its Wiener-Graben [[granite]] quarry, was already overcrowded with prisoners. Their numbers rose from 1,080 in late 1938 to over 3,000 a year later. About that time the construction of a new camp began in [[Gusen]], about 4.5 kilometres away. The new camp (later named '''Gusen I''') and its Kastenhofen quarry were completed in May of 1940. The first inmates were put in the first two huts (No. 7 and 8) on [[April 17]], [[1940]], while the first transport of prisoners - mostly from the camps in [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] - arrived on [[May 25]] of the same year.<ref name="Dobosiewicz"/>

Like nearby Mauthausen, the Gusen camp also used its inmates as slave labour in the granite quarries, but they also rented them out to various local businesses. In October of 1941, several huts were separated from the Gusen sub-camp by [[barbed wire]] and turned into a separate ''Prisoner of War Labour Camp'' ({{lang-de|Kriegsgefangenenarbeitslager}}). This camp had a large number of [[prisoners of war]] incarcerated, mostly Soviet officers. By 1942, the production capacity of both Mauthausen and Gusen had reached its peak. Gusen was expanded to include the central depot of the [[SS]], where various goods, which had been seized from occupied territories, were sorted and then dispatched to Germany.<ref name="Dobosiewicz2">Dobosiewicz, op.cit., p.26</ref> Local quarries and businesses were in constant need of a new source of labour as more and more Germans were drafted into the [[Wehrmacht]].

In March of 1944, the former SS depot was converted to a new sub-camp, and was named '''Gusen II'''. Until the end of the war the depot served as an improvised concentration camp. The camp contained about 12,000 to 17,000 inmates, who were deprived of even the most basic facilities.<ref name="Dobosiewicz_W_obronie"/> In December of 1944, another part of Gusen was opened in nearby [[Lungitz]]. Here, parts of a factory infrastructure were converted into the third sub-camp of Gusen — '''Gusen III'''.<ref name="Dobosiewicz_W_obronie"/> The rise in the number of sub-camps could not catch up with the rising number of inmates, which led to overcrowding of the huts in all of the sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen. From late 1940 to 1944, the number of inmates per bed rose from 2 to 4.<ref name="Dobosiewicz_W_obronie"/>

=== Mauthausen-Gusen camp system ===

{{seealso|List of subcamps of Mauthausen}}
As the production in all of the sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen complex was constantly rising, so was the number of detainees and the number of the sub-camps themselves. Although initially the camps of Gusen and Mauthausen mostly served the local quarries, from 1942, and onwards, they began to be included in the German war machine. To accommodate the ever-increasing number of slave workers, additional sub-camps ({{lang-de|Außenlager}}) of Mauthausen began construction in all parts of Austria. At the end of the war the list included 101 camps (including 49 major sub-camps<ref name="Waller">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[James Waller]] | title =Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing | year =2002 | pages =3&ndash;5 | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] | location =Oxford | id =ISBN 0-19-514868-1| url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0195148681&id=dHBB4TJpcx0C&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=Mauthausen&sig=40Bj2HNIG1t24SjCpEIzLNHJzdE }}</ref>) which covered most of modern [[Austria]], from [[Mittersill]] south of [[Salzburg]] to [[Schwechat]] east of [[Vienna]] and from [[Passau]] on the pre-war Austro-German border to the [[Loibl Pass]] on the border with [[Yugoslavia]]. The sub-camps were divided into several categories, depending on their main function: ''Produktionslager'' for factory workers, ''Baulager'' for construction, ''Aufräumlager'' for cleaning the rubble in Allied-bombed towns, and ''Kleinlager'' (small camps) where the inmates were working specifically for the SS.

===Mauthausen-Gusen as a business enterprise===
The production output of Mauthausen-Gusen exceeded that of each of the five other large slave labour centres, including: [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]], [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]], [[Marburg]] and [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], in terms of both production quota and profits.<ref name="Memoriales">{{es icon}} {{cite book | author =various authors | title =Memoriales históricos, 1933&ndash;1945 | year =2005 | chapter = Historia de los campos de concentración: El sistema de campos de concentración nacionalsocialista, 1933&ndash;1945: un modelo europeo | url =http://www.memoriales.net/ }}</ref> The list of companies using slave labour from the Mauthausen-Gusen camp system was long, and included both national corporations and small, local firms and communities. Some parts of the quarries were converted into a [[Mauser]] [[machine pistol]] assembly plant. In 1943, an underground factory for the [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] company was built in Gusen. Altogether, 45 larger companies took part in making [[Konzentrationslager|KZ]] Mauthausen-Gusen one of the most profitable concentration camps of Nazi Germany, with more than 11,000,000 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]]<ref name="Reichsmark">11,000,000 Reichsmark was equivalent to roughly 4,403,000 [[US dollar]]s or almost 1 million [[pound sterling|UK pounds]] by [[1939]] exchange rates; as per: {{en icon}} {{cite web | author=Michał Derela | title=The prices of Polish armament before 1939 | publisher= | year=2005|work=The PIBWL military site|url=http://derela.republika.pl/prices.htm|accessdate=2006-05-22 }} In turn, 4,403,000 1939 dollars are roughly equivalent to 560,370,000 modern US dollars using the [[relative share]] of [[GDP]] as the main factor of comparison; as per: {{en icon}} {{cite web | author=Samuel H.

Prisoners were also 'rented out' as slave labour, and were exploited in various ways, such as working for local farms, for road construction, reinforcing and repairing the banks of the Danube, and the construction of large residential areas in Sankt Georgen as well as being forced to excavate archaeological sites in Spielberg.

When the Allied [[strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign]] started to target the German war industry, German planners decided to move production to underground facilities that were impenetrable to enemy aerial bombardment. In Gusen I, the prisoners were ordered to build several large tunnels beneath the hills surrounding the camp (code-named ''Kellerbau''). By the end of [[World War II]] the prisoners had dug 29,400 m² to house a small arms factory. With January 1944, similar tunnels were also built beneath the village of Sankt Georgen by the inmates of Gusen II sub-camp (code-named ''Bergkristall''). They dug roughly 50,000 m² so the Messerschmitt company could build an assembly plant to produce the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] and [[V-2 rocket]]s. In addition to planes, some 7,000 m² of Gusen II tunnels served as factories for various war materials.<ref name="Bergkristall">{{en icon}} {{cite web | author=Rudolf Haunschmied, Harald Faeth | title=B8 "BERGKRISTALL" (KL Gusen II) | publisher= | year=1997|work=Tunnel and Shelter Researching|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/1325/berg.htm|accessdate=2006-04-26 }}</ref> In late 1944, roughly 11,000 of the Gusen I and II inmates were working in underground facilities.<ref name="Dobosiewicz-tunnels">Stanisław Dobosiewicz, ''W obronie życia…'', op.cit., p.194</ref> An additional 6,500 worked on expanding the underground network of tunnels and halls.

=== Extermination through labour ===
[[Image:Mauthausen gas chamber.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Showers in Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.]] 
The political function of the camp continued in parallel with its economic role. Until at least 1942, it was used for the imprisonment and murder of Germany's political and ideological enemies, both real and imagined.<ref name="Bischof"/><ref name="Richardson">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Elizabeth Richardson]] | title =Administrative Law and Procedure | year =1995 | pages =162&ndash;164 | chapter =United States vs. Leprich | chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0827374682&id=8iBCkpR1MqMC&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=Mauthausen&sig=uS5RYlmOR7sqvkU-C-Ff3Hgq_hU | publisher =Thomson Delmar Learning | id =ISBN 0-8273-7468-2 }}</ref> The camp served the needs of the German war machine and also carried out [[Vernichtung durch Arbeit|exterminations through labour]].

Initially, the camp did not have a [[gas chamber]] of its own and the so-called [[Muselmann|Muselmänner]], or prisoners who were too sick to work, after being maltreated, under-nourished or totally exhausted, were then transferred to other concentration camps for extermination (mostly to the infamous [[Hartheim Castle]],<ref name="Traveler's Guide">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Marc Terrance]] | title =Concentration Camps: A Traveler's Guide to World War II Sites | year =1999 | publisher =Universal Publishers | location = | id =ISBN 1-58112-839-8| url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN1581128398&id=TNt9IVBVeNQC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=Mauthausen&vq=Mauthausen&sig=LICy2j9fVQHMJS7anXJDGm7tTDs }}</ref> which was 40.7 km (25.3 miles) away), or killed by lethal injection and cremated in the local [[crematorium]]. The growing number of prisoners made the system too expensive and from 1940, Mauthausen was one of the few camps in the West to use a gas chamber on a regular basis. In the beginning, an improvised [[mobile gas chamber]] &ndash; a van with the exhaust pipe connected to the inside &ndash; shuttled between [[Mauthausen]] and [[Gusen]].

{{seealso|List of notable Mauthausen-Gusen inmates}}
Until early 1940, the largest group of inmates consisted of German, Austrian and Czechoslovak [[socialist]]s, [[communist]]s, [[anarchist]]s, [[homosexual]]s, and people of [[Roma people|Roma]] origin. Other groups of people to be persecuted solely on religious grounds were the ''Sectarians'', as they were dubbed by the Nazi regime, meaning [[Bible Students]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. The reason for their imprisonment was their total rejection of giving the loyalty oath to Hitler and their absolute refusal to participate in any kind of military service.<ref name="Marsalek"/>

In early 1940, a large number of Poles were transferred to the Mauthausen-Gusen complex. The first groups were mostly composed of artists, scientists, [[Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego|Boy Scouts]], teachers, and university professors,<ref name="Dobosiewicz"/><ref name="Nogaj">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Stanisław Nogaj]] | coauthors = | title =Gusen; Pamiętnik dziennikarza (Gusen: Memories of a Journalist) | year =1945|pages =64|publisher =Komitet byłych więźniów obozu koncentracyjnego Gusen|location =Katowice-Chorzów }}</ref> who were arrested during the course of the [[AB Action]].

Later in the war, all new arrivals were from every category of the "unwanted", but educated people, and so-called political prisoners constituted the largest part of all inmates until the end of the war. During [[World War II]], large groups of [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish Republicans]] were also transferred to Mauthausen and its sub-camps. Most of them were former Republican soldiers or activists who had fled to France after [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s victory and then were captured by German forces after the [[Battle of France|French defeat]] in 1940 or handed over to the Germans by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] authorities. The largest of these groups arrived at Gusen in January of 1941.<ref name="Wnuk">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =Włodzimierz Wnuk | title =Byłem z wami (I Were With You) | year =1972 | pages =100&ndash;105 | chapter =Z Hiszpanami w jednym szeregu (With the Spaniards in One Line) | publisher =[[PAX]] | location =Warsaw }}</ref> In early 1941, almost all the Poles and Spaniards, except for a small group of specialists working in the quarry's stone mill, were transferred from Mauthausen to Gusen.<ref name="Grzesiuk">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Stanisław Grzesiuk]] | title =Pięć lat kacetu (Five Years of KZ) | year =1985 | pages =392|publisher =Książka i Wiedza|location =Warsaw|id =ISBN 83-05-11108-3 }}</ref> Following the outbreak of the [[Operation Barbarossa|Soviet-German War]] in 1941 the camps started to receive a large number of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[prisoners of war|POW]]s. Most of them were kept in huts separated from the rest of the camp. The Soviet prisoners of war were a major part of the first groups to be gassed in the newly-built gas chamber in early 1942. In 1944, a large group of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Jews was also transferred to the camp.<ref name="Hungarian Jews">Roughly 8,000 people altogether</ref> Much like all the other large groups of prisoners that were transferred to Mauthausen-Gusen, most of them either died as a result of the hard labour and poor conditions, or were thrown down the sides of the Mauthausen quarry (nick-named the ''Parachutists' Wall'' by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guards and [[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapos]]). This name was a sick joke because it made fun of the prisoners by calling them "Parachutists without a parachute".

Throughout the years of World War II, the camps of Mauthausen-Gusen received new prisoners in smaller transports on a daily basis; mostly from other concentration camps in German-occupied Europe. Most of the prisoners in the sub-camps of Mauthausen were kept in various detention sites prior to transportation to their final destination. The most notable of such centres for Mauthausen-Gusen were the infamous camps at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. The first transports from Auschwitz arrived in February of 1942. The second transport in June of that year was much larger and numbered some 1,200 prisoners. Similar groups were sent from Auschwitz to Gusen and Mauthausen in April and November of 1943, and then in January and February of 1944. Finally, after [[Adolf Eichmann]] visited Mauthausen in May of that year, KZ Mauthausen-Gusen received the first group of roughly 8,000 Hungarian Jews from Auschwitz; the first group to be evacuated from that camp before the Soviet advance. Initially, the groups evacuated from Auschwitz consisted of qualified workers for the ever-growing industry of the Mauthausen-Gusen camp complex, but as the evacuation proceeded other categories of people were also transported to Mauthausen, Gusen, Vienna or [[Melk]]. 
[[Image:Kazimierkiewicz georg 1 hpk.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Camp file of a Polish political prisoner No. 382, [[Jerzy Kaźmirkiewicz]]]]

Over time, Auschwitz had to almost stop accepting new prisoners and most were directed to Mauthausen instead. The last group&mdash; roughly 10,000 prisoners&mdash;was evacuated in the last wave in January of 1945, only a few weeks before the Soviet capture of the area of the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex.<ref name="KARTA">{{pl icon}} {{cite web | author=Piotr Filipkowski  | title=Auschwitz w drodze do Matchausen (Auschwitz on its Way to Mauthausen) | year=2005 | work=Europe According to Auschwitz | url=http://www.reporter.edu.pl/europa_wg_auschwitz/kronika_reportaz/konferencja_historia_mowiona_a_kronika_reportaz/auschwitz_w_drodze_do_matchausen | accessdate=2006-04-11 }}</ref> Among them was a large group of civilians arrested by the Germans after the failure of the [[Warsaw Uprising]],<ref name="Kirchmayer">{{pl icon}} {{cite book|author =[[Jerzy Kirchmayer]] | title =Powstanie warszawskie | year =1978 | pages =576 | publisher =Książka i Wiedza | location =Warsaw | id =ISBN 83-05-11080-X }}</ref> but by the liberation not more than 500 of them were still alive.<ref name="Dobosiewicz-evacuation">Stanisław Dobosiewicz, op.cit., pp. 365&ndash;367</ref> Altogether, during the final months of the war, 23,364 prisoners from other [[concentration camp]]s arrived at the camp complex.<ref name="Dobosiewicz-evacuation"/> Many more perished during [[death march]]es, where they dropped dead because of pure exhaustion, or in railway wagons, where the prisoners were confined at sub-zero temperatures&mdash;without adequate food or water&mdash;for several days prior to their arrival.

As in all other [[German concentration camps]], not all the prisoners were equal. Their treatment depended largely on the [[Nazi concentration camp badges|category assigned to each inmate]], as well as their nationality and rank within the system. The so-called [[Kapo (Arbeitslager)|kapo]]s, or prisoners who had been recruited by their captors to police their fellow prisoners, were given more food and higher pay in the form of concentration camp coupons which could be exchanged for cigarettes in the canteen, as well as a separate room inside most barracks. In addition, following [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]]'s order in June, 1941, a [[brothel]] was opened for them in 1942, in the Mauthausen and Gusen I camps.<ref name="nizkor">{{cite web | author=KZ Gusen Memorial Committee | title=KZ Gusen I Concentration Camp

====Women and children in Mauthausen-Gusen====

Although the Mauthausen-Gusen camp complex was mostly a labour camp for men, a women's camp was opened in Mauthausen, in September of 1944, with the first transport of female prisoners from [[Auschwitz]]. Eventually, more women and children came to Mauthausen from [[Ravensbruck]], [[Bergen Belsen]], [[Gross Rosen]], and [[Buchenwald]]. With them came some female guards. Twenty are known to have served in the Mauthausen camp, and sixty in the whole camp complex. Female guards also staffed the Mauthausen sub-camps at [[Hirtenberg]], [[Lenzing]] (the main women's sub-camp in Austria), and [[St. Lambrecht]]. The Chief Overseers at Mauthausen were firstly [[Margarete Freinberger]], and then [[Jane Bernigau]]. Of all the female Overseers who served in Mauthausen, almost all of them were recruited between September 1944, and November 1944, from Austrian cities and towns. In early April of 1945, at least 2,500 more female prisoners came from the female sub-camps at [[Amstetten (Lower Austria)|Amstetten]], St. Lambrecht, Hirtenberg, and the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]] sub-camp at [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]]. It is rumoured that [[Hildegard Lächert]] also served at Mauthausen.<ref name="Brown">{{en icon}} {{cite book|author =[[Daniel Patrick Brown]] | title =The Camp Women: The Female Auxiliaries Who Assisted the SS in Running the Nazi Concentration Camp System | year =2002 | publisher =Schiffer Publishing | id =ISBN 0-7643-1444-0 | pages =288}}</ref>

====The treatment of inmates and methodology of crime====

Although not the only concentration camp where the German authorities implemented their [[extermination through labour]] (''Vernichtung durch Arbeit''), Mauthausen-Gusen was one of the most brutal and severe. The conditions within the camp were considered exceptionally hard to bear, even by concentration camp standards.<ref name="HolocaustMuseum">{{en icon}} {{cite web | author=Simon Wiesenthal Center | title=Selected Holocaust Glossary: Terms, Places and Personalities | publisher=Florida Holocaust Museum | work=Florida Holocaust Museum webpage | url=http://www.flholocaustmuseum.org/frameworks/glossary.htm | accessdate=2006-04-12 }}</ref><ref name="Bloxham">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Donald Bloxham]] | title =Genocide on Trial: War Crimes Trials and the Formation of Holocaust History and Memory | pages =210 | publisher =Oxford University Press | location =Oxford | id =ISBN 0-19-925904-6 | url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0199259046&id=ab4ZL8h5dFMC&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=extermination+through+labour&vq=Mauthausen&sig=horhgVquFxTIFvA02FbZGzzi4x0 }}</ref><ref name="Burleigh">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Michael Burleigh]] | title =Ethics and Extermination: Reflections on Nazi Genocide | year =1997 | pages =210&ndash;211 | publisher =Cambridge University Press|location =Cambridge|id =ISBN 0-521-58816-2|url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0521588162&id=y-tbb8Yx3ooC&pg=RA1-PA211&lpg=RA1-PA211&dq=extermination+through+labour&vq=Mauthausen&sig=FF-Nujc2T9wvayl-lFdQ8hWaJPU }}</ref> The inmates suffered not only from [[malnutrition]], overcrowded huts and constant abuse and beatings by the guards and [[Kapo (Arbeitslager)|kapo]]s,<ref name="Grzesiuk"/> but also from exceptionally hard labour.<ref name="Abzug"/> As there were too many prisoners in Mauthausen to have all of them work in its quarry at the same time, many were put to work in workshops, or had to do other manual work, whilst the unfortunate ones who were selected to work in the quarry were only there because of their so-called "crimes" in the camp. The reasons for sending them to work in the "Punishment-Detail" were trivial, and included such "crimes" as not saluting a German passing by.

The work in the quarries — often in unbearable heat or in temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees [[Celsius]]<ref name="Grzesiuk"/> — led to exceptionally high mortality rates.<ref name="Mortality"> It is often mentioned that the mortality rate reached 58% in 1941, as compared with 36% at Dachau, and 19% at Buchenwald over the same period.

It is estimated that the average energy content of food rations dropped from about 1,750 calories a day during the 1940&ndash;1942 period, to between 1,150 and 1,460 during the next period. In 1945, the energy content was even lower and did not exceed 600 to 1,000 calories a day; that is less than a third of the energy needed by an average worker in [[heavy industry]].<ref name="Dobosiewicz_W_obronie"/> This led to the starvation of thousands of inmates.

The inmates of Mauthausen, Gusen I, and Gusen II had access to a separate sub-camp for the sick — the so-called ''Krankenlager''. Despite the fact that (roughly) 100 medics from among the inmates were working there,<ref name="Krukowski">{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =Stefan Krukowski | title =Nad pięknym modrym Dunajem; Mauthausen (Mauthausen: At the Blue Danube) | year =1966 | pages =292&ndash;297 | chapter =Pamięci lekarzy (Memory of the doctors) | publisher =Książka i Wiedza | location =Warsaw }}</ref> they were not given any medication and could offer only basic first aid.<ref name="Krukowski"/><ref name="Dobosiewicz"/> Thus the ''hospital camp'' &ndash; as it was called by the German authorities &ndash; was, in fact, the last stop before death for thousands of inmates, and very few had a chance to recover.

The rock-quarry in Mauthausen was at the base of the infamous "Stairs of Death". Prisoners were forced to carry roughly-hewn blocks of stone — often weighing as much as 50 kilograms — up the 186 stairs - one behind the other. As a result, many exhausted prisoners collapsed in front of the other prisoners in the line, and then fell on top of the other prisoners, creating a horrific [[domino]] effect; the first prisoner falling onto the next, and so on, all the way down the stairs.<ref name="Weissman">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Gary Weissman]] | title =Fantasies of Witnessing: Postwar Efforts to Experience the Holocaust|year =2004|pages =2&ndash;3|publisher =[[Cornell University]] Press | id =ISBN 0-8014-4253-2| url =http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN0801442532&id=kXO9wXvYuAQC&dq=Mauthausen&lpg=PA1&pg=PA3&sig=Mmr8_dvGaJIJqrcQJ6j2DJfcyEo }}</ref>

Such brutality was not accidental. The SS guards would often force prisoners — exhausted from hours of hard labour without sufficient food and water — to race up the stairs carrying blocks of stone. Those who survived the ordeal would often be placed in a line-up at the edge of a cliff known as "The Parachute Wall" ({{lang-de|Fallschirmspringerwand}}).<ref name="Mauthausen-memorial">{{de icon}} {{cite web| author=| coauthors =| url =http://www.mauthausen-memorial.at/db/admin/de/show_article.php?carticle=367&topopup=1| title =Fallschirmspringerwand| format =| work =Mauthausen Memorial| publisher =KZ-Gedenkstaette Mauthausen| accessdate =2006-05-16}}</ref> At gun-point each prisoner would have the option of being shot, or to push the prisoner in front of them off of the cliff.<ref name="Waller"/> Other common methods of extermination of prisoners, who were either sick, unfit for further labour or as a means of [[Collective responsibility (doctrine)|collective responsibility]] or after escape attempts included:

After the war one of the survivors, Dr. [[Antoni Gościński]] reported 62 ways of murdering people in the camps of Gusen I and Mauthausen.<ref name="Oskarżamy"/> Hans Maršálek estimated that an average [[life expectancy]] of newly-arrived prisoners in Gusen varied from 6 months between 1940 and 1942, to less than 3 months in early 1945.<ref name="Marsalek2">Hans Maršálek (1968) ''Konzentrazionslager Gusen''.

Paradoxically, with the growth of forced labour industry in various sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen, the situation of some of the prisoners improved significantly. While the food rations were increasingly limited every month, the heavy industry necessitated skilled specialists rather than unqualified workers and the brutality of the camp's SS and Kapos was limited. While the prisoners were still beaten on the daily basis and the Muselmänner were still exterminated, from early 1943 on some of the factory workers were allowed to receive food parcels from their families (mostly Poles and Frenchmen). This allowed many of them not only to evade the risk of starvation, but also to help other prisoners who had no relatives outside the camps — or were not allowed to receive parcels.<ref name="Grzesiuk_food">Stanisław Grzesiuk, op.cit., pp. 252&ndash;255 and following</ref>

Because the Germans destroyed much of the camp's files and evidence and often gave newly-arrived prisoners the camp numbers of those who had already been killed,<ref name="Abzug"/> the exact death toll of the Mauthausen-Gusen complex is impossible to calculate. The matter is further complicated due to some of the inmates of Gusen being murdered in Mauthausen, and at least 3,423 sent to Hartheim Castle, 40.7 km (25.3 miles) away. Also, several thousands were killed in mobile gas chambers, without any mention of the exact number of victims in the surviving files.<ref name="Dobosiewicz-Zamordowani">Stanisław Dobosiewicz, op.cit., pp.418–426</ref> The SS, before their escape from the camps on [[May 4]], [[1945]], tried to destroy the evidence, allowing approximately only 40,000 victims to be identified.

Apart from the surviving camp files of the sub-camps of Mauthausen, the main documents used for an estimation of the death toll of the camp complexes are:

# Original death register for the sub-camp of Gusen held by the [[International Red Cross]]
# Personal notes of [[Stanisław Nogaj]], another inmate who had been working in the chancellery of Gusen
# Death register prepared by the SS chief medic of the Mauthausen main chancellery for the sub-camps of Gusen (similar records for the Mauthausen sub-camp itself were destroyed)

Most of the inmates of German and Austrian nationality "volunteered" for the [[SS-Freiwillige Häftlingsdivision]], an SS unit composed mostly of former concentration camp inmates and headed by [[Oskar Dirlewanger]]. The remaining prisoners were rushed to build a line of granite anti-tank obstacles to the east of Mauthausen. The inmates unable to cope with the hard labour and malnutrition were exterminated in large numbers to free space for newly-arrived evacuation transports from other camps, including most of the sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen located in eastern Austria. In the final months of the war, the main source of calories, that is the parcels of food sent through the [[International Red Cross]], stopped and food rations became catastrophically low. The prisoners transferred to the "Hospital Sub-camp" received one piece of bread per 20 inmates and roughly half a litre of weed soup a day.<ref name="Dobosiewicz-food rations">Dobosiewicz, op.cit., pp.374&ndash;375</ref> This made some of the prisoners, previously engaged in various types of resistance activity, begin to prepare plans to defend the camp in case of an SS attempt to exterminate all the remaining inmates. It is not known why the prisoners of Gusen I and II were not exterminated ''en-masse'', despite direct orders from [[Heinrich Himmler]]; Ziereis' plan assumed rushing all the prisoners into the tunnels of the underground factories of Kellerbau and blowing up the entrances. The plan was known to one of the Polish resistance organizations which started an ambitious plan of gathering tools necessary to dig air vents in the entrances.

On [[April 28]], under cover of a fictional air-raid alarm, some 22,000 prisoners of Gusen were rushed into the tunnels. However, after several hours in the tunnels all of the prisoners were allowed to return to the camp. [[Stanisław Dobosiewicz]], the author of a monumental monograph of the Mauthausen-Gusen complex explains that one of the possible causes of the failure of the German plan was that the Polish prisoners managed to cut the fuse wires. Ziereis himself stated in his testimony written on [[May 25]] that it was his wife who convinced him not to follow the order from above.<ref name="Dobosiewicz-final">Stanisław Dobosiewicz, op.cit., pp. 382&ndash;388</ref> Although the plan was abandoned, the prisoners feared that the SS might want to massacre the prisoners by other means. Because of that the Polish, Soviet and French prisoners prepared a plan for an assault on the barracks of the SS guards in order to seize the arms necessary to put up a fight. A similar plan was also devised by the Spanish inmates.<ref name="Dobosiewicz-final"/>

On [[May 3]], the SS and other guards started to prepare for evacuation of the camp. The following day, the guards of Mauthausen were replaced with unarmed [[Volkssturm]] soldiers and an improvised unit formed of elderly police officers and fire fighters evacuated from Vienna. The police officer in charge of the unit accepted the "inmate self-government" as the camp's highest authority and [[Martin Gerken]], until then the highest-ranking kapo prisoner in the Gusen's administration (in the rank of ''Lagerälteste'', or the ''Camp's Elder''), became the new ''de facto'' commander. He attempted to create an International Prisoner Committee that would become a provisional governing body of the camp until it was liberated by one of the approaching armies, but he was openly accused of co-operation with the SS and the plan failed. All work in the sub-camps of Mauthausen stopped and the inmates focused on preparations for their liberation - or defence of the camps against a possible assault by the SS divisions concentrated in the area.<ref name="Dobosiewicz-final"/> The remnants of several German divisions indeed assaulted the Mauthausen sub-camp, but were repelled by the prisoners who took over the camp.<ref name="Żeromski"/> Out of all the main sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen only Gusen III was to be evacuated. On [[May 1]] the inmates were rushed on a [[death march]] towards [[Sankt Georgen]], but were ordered to return to the camp after several hours. The operation was repeated the following day, but called off soon afterwards. The following day, the SS guards deserted the camp, leaving the prisoners to their fate.<ref name="Dobosiewicz-final"/>

The camps of Mauthausen-Gusen were the last to be liberated during the [[World War II]]. On [[May 5]], [[1945]], the camp at Mauthausen was approached by soldiers of the 41st Recon Squad of the [[US 11th Armored Division]], [[3rd US Army]]. The reconnaissance squad was led by S/SGT Albert J. Kosiek. His troop disarmed the policemen and left the camp. By the time of its liberation, most of the SS-men of Mauthausen had already fled; however, some 30 who were left were lynched by the prisoners;<ref name="Dobosiewicz-liberty">Stanisław Dobosiewicz, op.cit., pp.395&ndash;397</ref> a similar number were lynched in Gusen II.<ref name="Dobosiewicz-liberty"/> Until [[May 6]] all the remaining sub-camps of the Mauthausen-Gusen camp complex, with the exception of the two camps in the [[Loibl Pass]], were also liberated by American forces.

Among the inmates liberated from the camp was Lieutenant [[Jack Taylor]], an officer of the [[Office of Strategic Services]].<ref name="Taylor">{{en icon}} {{cite web | author= | title= Jack Taylor, American Agent Who Survived Mauthausen | publisher= | year=2006 | work=Jewish Virtual Library | url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/mauth32.html | accessdate=2006-04-28 }}</ref> He had managed to survive with the help of several prisoners and was later a key witness at the [[Mauthausen-Gusen camp trials]] carried out by the [[Dachau International Military Tribunal]].<ref name="Taylor2">{{en icon}} {{cite journal | author = [[Jack Taylor]] | year = 2003 | month = 3rd Quarter | title = OSS Archives: The Dupont Mission|journal = The BLAST; UDT-SEAL Association|url = http://www.udtseal.org/oss.html|accessdate = 2006-04-28 }}</ref> Another of the camp's survivors was [[Simon Wiesenthal]], an engineer who spent the rest of his life hunting Nazi [[war criminal]]s.

Following the capitulation of Germany, the Mauthausen-Gusen complex fell within the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet sector of occupation of Austria]]. Initially, the Soviet authorities used parts of the Mauthausen and Gusen I camps as [[barracks]] for the [[Red Army]]. At the same time, the underground factories were being dismantled and sent to the USSR as a war booty. After that, between 1946 and 1947, the camps were unguarded and many furnishings and facilities of the camp were dismantled, both by the Red Army and by the local population. In the early summer of 1947, the Soviet forces had blown the tunnels up and were then withdrawn from the area, while the camp was turned over to Austrian civilian authorities. However, it was not until 1949 that it was declared a national [[memorial]] site. Finally, 30 years after camp's liberation, on [[May 3]], [[1975]], Chancellor [[Bruno Kreisky]] officially opened the Mauthausen Museum.<ref name="Bischof"/>
Unlike Mauthausen, much of what constituted the sub-camps of Gusen I, II and III is now covered by residential areas built there after the war.<ref name="Terrance 2">Marc Terrance, op.cit., [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN1581128398&id=TNt9IVBVeNQC&vq=Mauthausen&dq=Mauthausen&lpg=PA137&pg=PA139&sig=JR-vHriYISIpCknJg7JauymBJ8M pp. 138&ndash;139]</ref>
