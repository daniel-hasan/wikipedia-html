The '''Green Iguana''' (''Iguana iguana'') is a large, [[arboreal]] [[herbivorous]] [[species]] of [[lizard]] of the [[genus]] [[iguana]] native to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]].  The Green iguana ranges over a large geographic area, from  southern [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]] to as far north as [[Mexico]], the [[Caribbean]] Islands; and in the [[United States]] as [[feral]] populations in [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]] and the [[Rio Grande Valley]] of [[Texas]].  The Green iguana is a [[reptile]] commonly found in captivity as a [[pet]] and grows to 1.5 meters in length from head to tail, although a few specimens have grown more than 2 meters (6 feet) and can weigh upwards of 20 pounds (10 kg).

==Taxonomy==

The word Iguana is derived from a Spanish form of the [[Taino]] name for the species "Iwana".<ref name="Coles">

==Anatomy and morphology==
In southern countries of their range, such as [[Peru]], Green iguanas appear bluish in color with bold black markings.<ref name="Samuelson"/> On islands such as [[Bonaire]], [[Curacao]], [[Aruba]], and [[Grenada]], a Green iguana's color may range from green to lavender, black, and even pink.<ref name="devosjoli"/><ref name ="Samuelson"/> Green iguanas from the western region of Costa Rica are red and animals of the northen ranges, such as Mexico, appear orange.<ref name="Samuelson"/><ref name="devosjoli"/> Juvenile Green iguanas from [[El Salvador]] are often bright blue as babies, however they lose this color as they get older.<ref name="devosjoli"/>

Green iguanas possess a row of spines along their backs and along their tails which helps to protect them from predators.<ref name="Samuelson"/> Their whiplike tails can be used to deliver painful strikes and like many other lizards, when grabbed by the tail, the iguana can allow it to break, so it can escape and eventually regrow a new one.<ref name="SS"/><ref name="Rosenfeld"/> In addition, iguanas have well developed [[dewlap]]s which helps regulate their body temperature.<ref name="Audobon"/>  It is also used in courtships and displays.<ref name="devosjoli"/><ref name="Samuelson"/><ref name="Conant">

</ref> As Green iguanas have only a few [[Rod cell]]s, they have poor vision in low-light conditions. At the same time, they have cells called “double [[Cone cell]]s” that give them sharp color vision and enable them to see [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths.<ref name="Brames"/> This ability is highly useful when basking so the animal can ensure that it absorbs enough sunlight in the forms of [[UVA]] and [[UVB]] to produce [[Vitamin D]].<ref name="devosjoli"/><ref name="Rosenfeld"/>

Green iguanas have evolved a white photosensory organ on the top of their heads called the [[parietal eye]], which are also called third eye, pineal eye or pineal gland.<ref name="Brames"/> This “eye” doesn’t work the same way as a normal eye does as it has only a rudimentary retina and lens and thus cannot form images.<ref name="Brames"/> It is, however, sensitive to changes in light and dark and can detect movement.<ref name="Brames"/> This helps the iguana when being stalked by predators from above.<ref name="Brames"/> 

Green iguanas have very sharp teeth that are capable of shredding leaves and even human skin.<ref name="devosjoli"/> The teeth are situated on the inner sides of the jawbones which is why they are hard to see in smaller specimens.<ref name="Conant"/>

Primarily [[herbivorous]], Green iguanas are presented with a special problem for [[osmoregulation]]; plant matter contains more [[potassium]] and as it has less nutritional content per gram, more must be eaten to meet metabolic needs.<ref name="Hazard">

Green iguanas from [[Guatemala]] and southern Mexico have small horns on their snouts between their eyes and their nostrils, whereas others do not.<ref name="Samuelson"/>  Naturalists once classified these iguanas as belonging to different [[subspecies]] (''Iguana iguana rhinolopha''); however, this classification has been found to be invalid as iguanas with similar nose projections appear randomly in other populations and interbreed freely with those that do not share this trait.<ref name="Samuelson">

==Behavior==
[[Image:Cuban Iguana head.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Reddish colored Green Iguana]]
When frightened by a [[predator]], Green iguanas will attempt to flee, and if near a [[body of water]], dive into it and swim away.<ref name="Swanson"/>  If cornered by a threat, the Green iguana will extend and display the [[dewlap]] under its neck, stiffen and puff up its body, and bob its head at the aggressor.<ref name="Samuelson"/>  If the threat persists the Green iguana will lash with it's tail, bite and use its claws in defense.<ref name="Swanson"/>  Wounded animals are more inclined to fight than uninjured ones.<ref name="Swanson"/>

Green iguanas use "head bobs" and dewlaps in a variety of ways in social interactions, such as greeting another iguana or to court a possible mate.<ref name="devosjoli"/>  The frequency and number of head bobs have particular meanings to other iguanas.<ref name="Samuelson"/>

Green iguanas are preyed upon by [[hawk]]s and their fear of hawks is exploited as a ploy to catch them in the wild.<ref name="Swanson"/>  The sound of a hawk's whistle or scream makes the iguana freeze and it becomes easier to capture.<ref name="Swanson"/>

==Diet==
[[Image:La Palmyre 073.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The herbivorous Green iguana]]

Green iguanas are primarily [[herbivore]]s, feeding on leaves, flowers, fruit, and growing shoots of upwards of 100 different species of plant.<ref name="Burghart"/><ref name="devosjoli"/>  In Panama one of the Green iguana's favorite foods is wild plum, ''[[Spondias monbin]]''.<ref name="Swanson"/>

Although they will consume a wide variety of foods if offered, green iguanas are naturally [[herbivorous]] and require a precise ratio of minerals (2 to 1 calcium to phosphous) in their diet.<ref name="Rosenfeld"/><ref name="anapsid-mkdiet">{{cite web

Although, in captivity, Green Iguanas will eat meat if presented with it, excessive consumption of animal protein results in severe kidney problems and possible [[premature death]].<ref name="devosjoli"/><ref name ="Britton"/>  Misinformed pet owners tend to feed iguanas [[iceberg lettuce]], which provides iguanas with water but has no other nutritional value.<ref name="Rosenfeld"/>  A captive Green iguana's diet should consist of fresh leafy vegetables such as [[mustard greens]], [[collard greens]], [[dandelion]], [[arugula]] or [[kale]] and access to fresh water.<ref name="devosjoli"/>

Green iguanas will thrive only in temperatures of 79 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 32 degrees Celsius) and must have appropriate sources of [[Ultraviolet|UVB]] and [[Ultraviolet|UVA]] lighting, or else their bodies cannot produce Vitamin D, which can result in a metabolic bone disease that can be fatal.<ref name="devosjoli"/><ref name="Rosenfeld"/>
