'''Proactiv Solution''' is a consumer product marketed as a three-step [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] treatment system since [[1995]].  It was developed by [[dermatology|dermatologists]] Dr. [[Katie Rodan]] and Dr. [[Kathy Fields]].

==Product Description==
The '''Proactiv''' system comprises three different core products, a cleanser, toner and lotion.

==Indications and Side Effects==
According to the company's website, '''Proactiv Solution''' was created to treat mild to moderate cases of acne, not severe cases. Like most antibacterials for treating acne, '''Proactiv Solution''' uses [[Benzoyl peroxide]] as one of the main [[active ingredient]]s.  Benzoyl peroxide may cause dryness and peeling of the skin.  Certain side effects may include: [[allergic reaction]]s such as redness, itching, [[Urticaria|hives]], swelling and a burning sensation after topical application.  Benzoyl peroxide may also cause increased sensitivity to sunlight and induce collar-specific bleaching in clothes. As an alternative product, Proactiv Solution has marketed the ''Gentle Formula'' kit, containing [[Salicylic acid]] instead of Benzoyl Peroxide.  It is unclear if these same side effects exist with the Salicylic acid preparation.

==Sales and marketing strategies==
In [[North America]], Proactiv Solutions is sold mainly through [[infomercial]]s, as advertised by [[Guthy-Renker]], at mall kiosks, and [[online]].  Buyers may be automatically entered into a [[subscription business model]], upsetting some consumers. <ref> [http://ripoffreport.com/searchresults.asp?q1=ALL&q4=&q6=&q3=&q2=&q7=&searchtype=0&submit2=Search%21&q5=proactiv ProActiv Complaints at Ripoffreport.com]</ref><ref>[http://search.complaints.com/search?btnG=Search%2BComplaints.com&output=xml_no_dtd&sort=date%253AD%253AL%253Ad1&client=complaints&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF-8&proxystylesheet=complaints&site=complaints&q=proactiv ProActiv Complaints at Complaints.com]</ref>

==Celebrity Spokespeople==
Guthy-Renker's marketing campaigns make heavy use of celebrity spokespeople. [[Celebrities]] are featured heavily in '''Proactiv''' informercials, recounting their "true-life" stories of using the product. It has not been established whether the named celebrities have actually used or currently use ProActiv Solution.  According to one source, Associated Content, before [[Jessica Simpson]] signed her endorsement deal with ProActiv, she stated publicly that she cured her acne through a prescribed medication called Accutane, an extremely powerful internal medication that stops the production of excess oil which causes acne.<ref>http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/122954/the_jessica_simpson_acne_lie.html</ref>  Nonetheless, the following celebrities, including [[Jessica Simpson]] herself, have endorsed ProActiv Solution:
