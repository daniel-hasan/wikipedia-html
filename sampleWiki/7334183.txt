The '''2006–07 season''' was the 124th year of [[football (soccer)|football]] played by [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], and their 80th season in [[The Football League]], and covers the period from [[2006-07-01]] to [[2007-06-30]]. After finishing sixth in [[Football League Two|Coca-Cola League 2]], Rovers won the [[playoff]] final for the first time in their history, and won promotion for only the fourth time since joining The Football League. The previous promotions were all automatic, and came in the [[1952-53 in English football|1952–53]], [[1973-74 in English football|1973–74]] and [[1989-90 in English football|1989–90]] seasons.<ref name="Byrne & Jay">{{cite book |last=Byrne |first=Stephen |coauthors=Jay, Mike |title=Bristol Rovers Football Club - The Definitive History 1883-2003 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Tempus Publishing|Tempus]] |location=[[Stroud, Gloucestershire|Stroud]] |isbn=0-7524-2717-2}}</ref>

The season began with a subdued atmosphere among fans, caused by six previous seasons of poor performances and a bitter boardroom split, resulting in four directors leaving the club.<ref name="board1">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_rovers/5083186.stm Turl hits out at Bristol Rovers] BBC Sport.

==Review and events==

The pre-season period was a turbulent one, with a potential take-over of the club by Mike Turl being rejected by then-chairman [[Geoff Dunford]]. Directors Kevin Spencer and Colin Williams left the club in protest at the rejection,<ref name="board1"/> followed shortly after by the Bristol Rovers Supporters Club representative on the football club's board, Kim Stuckey.<ref name="board2"/>

[[Ryan Green]] had signed for the club from [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] at the end of the previous season,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_rovers/5034268.stm |title=Rovers bag Bulls defender Green |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=2007-08-17 |format=HTML}}</ref> and he was joined by three more new players before the start of the 2006-07 season. [[Sammy Igoe]], who had been on loan at Rovers from [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] the previous season, joined on a full-time basis, young defender [[Byron Anthony]], who had yet to make an appearance in the [[Football League]], joined from [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], and experienced [[goalkeeper]] [[Steve Phillips (footballer)|Steve Phillips]] crossed the city to join from local rivals [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].

A number of players left the club following the end of the 2005–06 season. Senior players [[John Anderson (footballer born 1972)|John Anderson]], who had been assistant manager to [[Paul Trollope]] during his spell as caretaker manager the previous year,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2005/09/22/atkins_feature.shtml |title=Atkins sacked - your views |work=BBC Bristol |accessdate=2007-08-20 |format=HTML}}</ref> [[Ali Gibb]], [[Jon Bass]] and [[Christian Edwards]] were released, while [[Jamie Forrester]] moved to [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] on a free transfer. Also leaving the club were a number of younger players who had failed to earn extensions to their contracts. These were [[Mark Preece]], [[Matt Thorne (footballer)|Matt Thorne]], [[Ben Willshire]] and [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeepers]] [[Ryan Clarke]] and [[Martin Horsell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gasheads.com/summer06.htm |title=2006 summer moves |work=Gasheads.com |accessdate=2007-08-17 |format=HTML}}</ref>

The first game of the season was away to [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in [[Football League Two|League 2]], and ended in a 4-1 defeat,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/5226908.stm |title=Peterborough 4-1 Bristol Rovers |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=2007-08-21 |format=HTML}}</ref> resulting in the lowest league position, 23rd, that Rovers would occupy all season. As the season progressed, Rovers gradually climbed the [[league table]], eventually clinching a [[playoff]] spot after winning their final league match 2-1 against [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]].

The playoff campaign was a high-scoring one, with there being an average of 4⅔ goals per game in the three matches played. The semi-final was against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], and was played over [[Two-legged match|two legs]]. The first leg at the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Stadium]] was won 2-1 by Rovers, thanks to goals by [[Craig Disley]] and [[Richard Walker (footballer born 1977)|Richard Walker]]. The second leg was played at [[Sincil Bank]] and ended 5-3, with [[Stuart Campbell (footballer)|Stuart Campbell]], [[Rickie Lambert]], Richard Walker, [[Sammy Igoe]] and [[Sean Rigg]] scoring the goals. This gave Rovers a 7-4 aggregate win and a place in the final at [[Wembley Stadium]]. A record attendance for a League 2 playoff final of 61,589 watched the game, and saw Rovers win the match 3-1 and gain promotion for only the fourth time in the club's history.<ref name="Byrne & Jay"/> Richard Walker scored two of the goals and Sammy Igoe scored the other.

The [[Football League Cup|Carling Cup]] campaign was a brief one. Rovers were knocked out in the first round by [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] on [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty kicks]] after drawing the match 1-1. The [[FA Cup]] was more successful, with the team reaching the fourth round where they were beaten 1-0 by [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. The best cup run of the season was in the [[Football League Trophy]], where they reached the final after beating rivals [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] 1-0 in the southern area final. The game was played at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]], but resulted in a 3-2 defeat after extra time, the score being 2-2 after 90 minutes.

The away kit was dark blue with yellow trim, and the third choice kit was yellow with black trim.
