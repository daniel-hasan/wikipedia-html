:''This article provides a list of the alien races featured in [[Stargate SG-1]] and [[Stargate Atlantis]].''
:''See also: [[Human civilizations in Stargate SG-1|Humans in ''SG-1'']], [[Human civilizations in Stargate Atlantis|Humans in ''Atlantis'']]''

Most planets in the ''Stargate'' universe are populated by humans. This is largely because, in the distant past, the alien race known as the [[Goa'uld]] came to Earth and, posing as the [[Egypt]]ian Gods, forced thousands of slaves to worship them. Humans were taken from Earth (by the Goa'uld), to other planets in the [[Milky Way]], to perform forced labour for their "gods" (''e.g.'', mining the rare (and fictitious) mineral [[Stargate materials|naqahdah]]). After a rebellion on Earth, the Goa'uld fled, and indeed many of the peoples who were drafted to extraterrestrial planets also managed to free themselves of the Goa'uld - either by the Goa'uld losing interest in them, or by instigating a strong enough rebellion. For these reasons, humans of Earth are called the [[Tau'ri]], meaning "those of the first world", whilst there are innumerable extraterrestrial human civilizations, often the only surviving remnants of ancient civilizations.

Aside from the abundance of human life throughout the ''Stargate'' universe, there is also a diversity of alien life. There are many minor species that have been encountered, but the most widespread and influential species include the [[Goa'uld]] in the [[Milky Way]]. In the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus Galaxy]], the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] hold dominance. Inter-galactic races include the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]], the deadly mechanical [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicators]], and the all-powerful [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]]. Ironically, the most influential race of all, the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]], have left this plane of existence.

==Milky Way aliens==
===Goa'uld===
[[Image:Goa'uld in water.jpg|thumb|A Goa'uld symbiote]]{{main|Goa'uld}}
The Goa'uld have been the dominant race in the galaxy for millennia. They are a parasitic species that resemble small snakes, which burrow into the upper spinal cords of other creatures, thereby taking control of the "host's" body and mind. In general, they choose to use humans as hosts due to the simplicity of human physiology, which makes it easy to repair, such that they can sustain life almost indefinitely. Prior to using humans as hosts, they frequently used Unas, which were a very powerful species with regenerative capabilities, the transition to humans was due in part to the fact that Goa'uld by nature are very vain, and value physical appearance highly. This particular aspect is evident in the series pilot, Children of the Gods, in which Apophis's wife is chosen mainly by appearance by a Goa'uld symbiote which is partly leaving a Jaffa. For centuries, they ruled Earth by claiming to be gods, and so they resemble the gods of Egyptian, Mayan, Aztec, Babylonian and Indian mythology. The show consistently calls the Goa'uld a [[symbiote]], even though most biologists would use the term [[symbiont]].

The Goa'uld have a rigid rank system. The most powerful members of the race are the [[System Lord]]s, who control massive fleets of interstellar motherships, massive armies of Jaffa, and are worshipped as gods by billions.
{{-}}

===Jaffa===
{{main|Jaffa (Stargate)}}
[[Image:Jaffa mask.jpg|thumb|A Jaffa with a traditional mask showing his allegiance to the [[System Lord]] Apophis]]Strictly speaking, the Jaffa are not a separate species from humanity. They are the descendants of humans that were enslaved by the Goa'uld thousands of years ago. However, they have been genetically re-engineered by the Goa'uld so as to suppress their natural immune system, such that beyond a certain age they can only live with the aid of a Goa'uld symbiote, functioning as incubators for larval Goa'uld. All Jaffa have marsupial-like pouches in their stomachs which serve to incubate a Goa'uld larva for seven to ten years, providing them access to the long life and well-being that the Goa'uld possess. The Jaffa constituted the majority of the military strength of the [[Goa'uld]]. However, due to the [[Jaffa Resistance|Jaffa rebellion]], some [[Goa'uld]], most notably Anubis, began to use other forces, such as [[Kull Warriors]], for their primary troops.

Technically, because they are the descendants of genetically modified humans, the Jaffa could be listed as a mutation of humanity, a sub-species rather than a completely independent organism.
{{-}}

===Tok'ra===
[[Image:Tokra.jpg|thumb|The Tok'ra Martouf]]{{main|Tok'ra}}
Opposing the Goa'uld are the [[Tok'ra]] (Literal translation: "Against [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]]", the ancient Supreme System Lord). Though the same biological species as the Goa'uld, the Tok'ra have fought the Goa'uld for millennia and have come to ally with the [[Tau'ri]] (humans from Earth) against the [[System Lord]]s. Unlike the Goa'uld, who dominate their host, the Tok'ra respect their hosts and freely share the body with the human mind that still inhabits it. A member of the Tok'ra is quite literally twofold; a voluntary human host, and a Tok'ra (strictly, Goa'uld) symbiote. The minds of the two "blend", which effectively means that they share memories and emotions and wisdom, but still remain distinct personalities. The mind in control of the body swaps around frequently, at the behest of either mind, and is usually signalled by lowering the head and closing the eyes for a moment. Furthermore, when the Tok'ra is in control, the person's voice becomes like that of a Goa'uld. The Tok'ra are a dying race, as the queen from which they all were spawned, [[Known Tok'ra#Egeria|Egeria]], has died.
{{-}}

===Unas===
{{main|Unas (Stargate)}}
[[Image:Stargate Unas.jpg|thumb|The Unas Chaka]]The first race used as hosts for the [[Goa'uld]]; they coexisted with them on their original planet. Known to the Jaffa as 'The first ones'. The [[Unas (Stargate)|Unas]] possess incredible physical strength and, when taken as a host, have the ability to regenerate from almost any wound thanks to the healing powers of the [[Goa'uld]]. Few [[Unas (Stargate)|Unas]] are still used as hosts, having been abandoned in favor of humans.

The Unas have limited technology, similar to that of humans in the [[bronze age]], and are sometimes exploited and used as slaves by humans. 
{{-}}

===Nox===
[[Image:StarGateNox.jpg|300px|thumb|The Nox healing wounded young]]{{main|Nox (Stargate)}}
A peaceful and [[fairy]]-like people, who are capable of reviving the dead and rendering even large objects invisible and intangible. They are entirely against violence of any kind, regardless of whether it is noble or evil. Despite their apparent fragility, they are a race of great dormant power. Their technology appears to be nearly equal to that of the [[Ancients (Stargate)|Ancients]], as demonstrated by the fact that they have a flying metallic city that can be shown to anyone by a wave of a Nox hand. They were also a member of the [[alliance of four great races]].
{{-}}

===Furlings===
{{main|Furling (Stargate)}}
Little is known about the Furlings, except that they are a member of the [[Alliance of four great races|alliance of the Four Great Races]]. However, occasional artifacts attributed to the Furlings have been identified. In the episode "[[Paradise Lost (Stargate SG-1)|Paradise Lost]]", [[SG-1]] discovered an old Utopian colony established by the Furlings and wiped out by a Goa'uld bearing a mind-altering drug.

In episode [[200 (Stargate SG-1)|200]], the Furlings were shown as [[Ewok]]-like creatures which were destroyed by the Goa'uld soon after their contact by the Tau'ri.  However, this scene was not an actual representation of the Furlings, rather the visualization of a television movie based upon the Stargate program.

Despite fan speculation that the Giant Aliens in [[Crystal Skull (Stargate SG-1)|Crystal Skull]], various un-named races or named by local human races, Salesh spirits and even the dragon from the Quest part 2 are Furlings, the writers have stated that Furlings have never been seen on the show; only their technology.

According to "Paradise Lost"'s commentator track, Furling skeletons were originally planned to be featured in the episode, but the production of such proved to be too expensive, which indicates that while possibly humanoid, Furling anatomy differs too greatly from human anatomy for the production team to simply modify a human skeleton.

{{-}}

===Kull Warriors===
[[Image:Evolution part 1 (Stargate SG-1).jpg|thumb|A Kull Warrior]]
{{main|Kull Warriors}}
These creatures were genetically engineered by the [[Goa'uld]] [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] for use in his personal army. Given life and enhanced, they are essentially [[tabula rasa]] bred for obedience and war. Their suits, which they are almost welded into, are impervious to all main weapons and explosives, including [[C4 explosive|C-4]] and other highly explosive compounds. Small trinium darts, however, can penetrate the suit. The [[Kull Disruptor]] was eventually devised by the [[Tau'ri]] and the [[Tok'ra]], using an [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] healing device discovered by the Goa'uld [[Telchak]], and is capable of bringing a Kull Warrior down in one or two shots.

After the defeat of Anubis, the [[System Lord]] [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] took control of Anubis's army, including the Kull Warriors. However, it was later revealed that Ba'al was a puppet for Anubis, who was still controlling the [[Kull Warriors]]. This is most likely how Anubis made Ba'al his puppet as Ba'al controlled them before Anubis's return. When Anubis returned they merely defaulted to him. Later, though, when Anubis was forcibly removed from our plane of existence by [[Oma Desala]], the Kull Warriors lost their guidance from Anubis, and were quickly defeated.  It is unknown if any remain alive.

{{-}}

===Re'tu===
[[Image:Re'tu.jpg|thumb|A Re'tu]]
{{main|Re'tu}}
Sworn enemies of the Goa'uld, the rebel Re'tu faction employs a radical method to wipe out their foes: kill all possible hosts. Essentially, this means that the rebel Re'tu are a great threat towards humans, even though the legitimate Re'tu government bears no ill-will towards humanity. They have the form of large mantis-like creatures. Most notably, however, they exist 180 degrees out of phase from the normal visual spectrum, making them invisible except under a [[Transphase Eradication Rod|TER]]. One Re'tu can be a deadly threat, and the rebels usually come in packs of 5 or 6, with which they can provide a danger to even well-secured military installations.
{{-}}

===Altairian===
After their world was poisoned they built an underground facility to save their race. They learned how to make synthetic android copies of themselves and transfer their consciousnesses into them. Harlan is the last known survivor of this race, after all others left the planet and were presumably destroyed. Due to what might have been a possible oversight in continuity it is speculated that these might have been a group of Alterans(Ancients) who stayed behind in the Milky Way or came back from the Pegasus galaxy early. As Harlan was over 11,000 years old yet the Ancients hadn't returned till 10,000 years ago and the Goa'uld didn't spread humans about the Galaxy until 5,000 years ago.
{{-}}

===Serrakin===
[[Image:Serrakin.jpg|thumb|right|A Serrakin]]
Seen in "[[Forsaken (Stargate SG-1)|Forsaken]]" and "[[Space Race (Stargate SG-1)|Space Race]]", the Serrakin helped free the human [[Hebridan (Stargate)|Hebridans]] from a Goa'uld, possibly [[Morrigan]], several millennia ago. They brought a significant amount of highly advanced technology with them, making the Hebridans one of the most technologically advanced Human civilizations. The Serrakin and the Hebridans live peacefully together, with the exception of an extreme minority of racial purists, and are known to intermarry and sire multi-species offspring. The Serrakin civilization is one of the few starfaring civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy not controlled or exterminated by the Goa'uld.  In Season 10 you can see a pair of Serrakin bounty hunters chasing after SG-1 in the episode 'Bounty', which indicates they have ties with the Luician Alliance. As of Season 10, their home planet has been conquered by the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]].
{{-}}

===Re'ol===
[[Image:Re'ol.png|thumb|A Re'ol]]
{{main|Re'ol}}
Almost wiped out by the Goa'uld, the Re'ol have a unique natural defense: one of their bodily secretions is used to create false memories when it comes into contact with a living creature. A Re'ol managed to infiltrate [[SG-1]] in the episode "[[The Fifth Man (Stargate SG-1)|The Fifth Man]]" as "Lt. Tyler", but was stunned to see how O'Neill, even once he was told that Tyler wasn't a member of his team, wouldn't "leave a man behind". The Re'ol now hide on an unknown planet, but the possibility for an alliance, should they appear again, is still there. An artificial version of the Re'ol secretion features twice in the series as Jackson used it to infiltrate a Goa'uld system lord meeting and Cameron used it to infiltrate the Lucian Alliance.
{{-}}

===Oranians===
[[Image:Stargate Jup.jpg|thumb|An Oranian]]
A gold-eyed alien species of which little is known. The only two members of this race the SGC has encountered so far are bumbling [[mercenaries]] [[Lucian Alliance characters in Stargate#Tenat|Tenat]] and [[Lucian Alliance characters in Stargate#Jup|Jup]] working for the [[Lucian Alliance]].("[[Prometheus Unbound (Stargate SG-1)|Prometheus Unbound]]", "[[The Ties That Bind (Stargate SG-1)|The Ties That Bind]]", "[[Company of Thieves (Stargate SG-1)|Company of Thieves]]" and "[[Bounty (Stargate SG-1)|Bounty]]"). However, several more members of the species were seen on the bridge of Tenat's ship in "Company of Thieves".
{{-}}

===Lesser known alien races===
These races have appeared only once so far.
[[Image:Gadmeer.png|thumb|120px|The Gadmeer]]
* The '''Atonieks''': The Atonieks were the subject of legends across the galaxy long before the era of Goa'uld dominance because of a technology, generally considered to be utterly fanciful, which gave them unprecedented speed and strength. These devices turned out to be real; they wore [[Atoniek armbands|armbands]] discovered by the [[Tok'ra]] [[Known Tok'ra#Anise|Anise]] in an archaeological survey of the Atoniek planet. The armbands released a virus into the wearer which modified their phsysiology to drastically increase their strength, stamina, and durability. However, the host body eventually develops an immunity to the virus of the armbands, rendering them ineffective and useless. With their primary technology rendered ineffective, the Atonieks died out.
* '''Gadmeer''': The Gadmeer existed for thousands of years, before being wiped out. They created a ship for the purpose of [[terraform]]ing a new planet for them. For ten thousand years it travelled around the universe looking for a viable world to terraform. Their [[sulfur]] environment was a problem when the ship attempted to terraform a planet being used at the time. The ship created [[Lotan (Stargate)|Lotan]] to communicate with the settlers and inform them they had to leave.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Scorched Earth (Stargate SG-1)| title=Scorched Earth| series=Stargate SG-1}}</ref>
* '''"Giant Aliens"''': Name given by Nicholas Ballard ([[Daniel Jackson]]'s grandfather) to the beings that live in a [[lepton]]-rich environment on planet P7X-377. They are not entirely humanoid, composing of a substance resembling mist. They can only be seen by those who have received a special radiation emanating from a special crystal skull present in an offworld Mayan Ziggurat. They are enemies of the Goa'uld, and are friends with anyone who shares that in common with them.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Crystal Skull (Stargate SG-1)|title=Crystal Skull| series=Stargate SG-1}}</ref>. 
[[Image:Stargate Mimetic aliens.jpg|thumb|Mimetic aliens]]
* '''"Mimetic aliens"''': Mysterious aliens who tried to take over the [[Stargate Command|SGC]] in "[[Foothold (Stargate SG-1)|Foothold]]", using technology that allows them to mimic the appearance of other beings. It was discovered that a certain sound frequency disrupted that technology. To prevent a similar situation, ever since, that same sound is played every time the Stargate activates (not that we can hear it).
[[Image:Fire and Water.jpg|thumb|Nem]]
*'''Oannes''': Nem and Omoroca are the only known members of this species. In the episode "[[Fire and Water (Stargate SG-1)|Fire and Water]]", Daniel Jackson is kidnapped by an Oanne named Nem who wants to know what happened to his mate Omoroca, insisting that Daniel remember some old information he read in his predoctoral days. Omoroca obviously at some point visited earth, and influenced early Phoenecian mythology. He searches Daniel's mind for the information only to find out that his mate was killed a long time ago by the Goa'uld. The species is aquatic and refer to the mythological species [[Oannes]].
* '''"Orb aliens of P5C-353"''': The only survivors of planet P5C-353, preserved within an orb. When the orb was taken back to Earth, strong spikes darted out from it, pinning [[Jack O'Neill (Stargate)|Colonel O'Neill]] to the wall. Eventually, they grew strong enough to speak through O'Neill, and the SGC agreed to take them to a planet they could survive on, rather than, as they planned, take over Earth.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Message In a Bottle (Stargate SG-1)| title=Message In a Bottle| series=Stargate SG-1}}</ref>
[[Image:One False Step.jpg|thumb|Aliens of PJ2-445]]
* '''"Aliens of PJ2-445"''': Though humanoid in appearance, their internal organ structure suggests otherwise. They have no spoken language, primitive housing, and cover their bodies in a thick paint that becomes a second skin. They seem to unknowingly live in symbiosis with the flora around them. When the crash of a UAV disturbed the flora and the humanoid creatures, SG-1 was forced to set things right.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=One False Step (Stargate SG-1)| title=One False Step| series=Stargate SG-1}}</ref> They are a culture centered entirely around the human musical voice, and sing to heal themselves - this singing is in part what generates the synergy with the plants.
[[Image:Salish Spirits.jpg|thumb|Salish Spirits]]
*'''Salish Spirits''': Seen in the episode "[[Spirits (Stargate SG-1)|Spirits]]", the race defeated the [[Goa'uld]] occupying a particular planet several centuries, possibly millennia ago, and coexisted with the [[Human civilizations in Stargate SG-1#Salish|Salish]] on PXY-887 as the Salish gods. They have natural powers, including the ability to teleport either themselves or others to or from, seemingly, anywhere. Their appearance is distinctive - [[humanoid]], although with unusual foreheads and layers of [[gill]]-like features on their face. As their race is fairly immaterial, they can assume many different forms, from mythical Salish animals to members of the [[Stargate Command|SGC]]. They can make adversaries disappear to what has been described as a "place of nothingness", who can be later returned at will with no memories of where they were.
[[Image:Cold Lazarus.jpg|thumb|Unity]]
*'''Unity''': A species of intelligent crystalline beings that was almost destroyed by the Goa'uld. The unity crystals are able to create a duplicate of any being that touches them. When SG-1 arrived at their planet, Colonel O'Neill touched one of the crystals and was knocked unconscious while the duplicate returned to Earth. The change was discovered after O'Neill woke up and returned to Earth. The duplicate had no ill intentions, and O'Neill himself helped him return home.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Cold Lazarus (Stargate SG-1)| title=Cold Lazarus| series=Stargate SG-1}}</ref>
*'''"Water-beings"''': beings that lived in a water world in the form of a liquid and were able to transform into a gas at will. They can also take control of humans. They were found when Russian stargate personnel took a sample of the water back to Russia when they noticed that the water was emitting thermal energy.<ref>{{cite episode|episodelink=Watergate (Stargate SG-1)| title=Watergate| series=Stargate SG-1}}</ref>
* The '''Shippers''': After the destruction of its original naqadriah powered hyperdrive, the ''Prometheus'' encountered an unknown ship while it travelled back to Earth using an Al'kesh hyperdrive.  The mysterious ship was superior in both size and technology, and launched an unprovoked attack upon the ''Prometheus''.  The ship suffered no damage during its attack and kidnapped the entirety of the human crew off the ''Prometheus'' with the exception of Major Carter, who was later able to barter for the release of her crewmates.  The physical appearance, history, and personality of these aliens are currently unknown, as they have not been seen since their first appearance.
*'''"Unnamed energy fireflies"''': While not technological, and never proven intelligent, the behavior of the spark-like energy entities on the research outpost moon (M4C-862) in the episode "Prodigy" exhibit distinct signs of intelligence, that may be attributed to the planet's massive magnetic field.<ref>{{cite episode|episodelink=Prodigy (Stargate SG-1)| title=Prodigy| series=Stargate SG-1}}</ref> The same species has also been seen in the Pegasus Galaxy where it displayed a more insect like behavior and no signs of actual intelligence.
*'''"Unnamed 'computer virus' entity"''': A world with a surface covered in advanced technology turns out to be inhabited by, for want of a better description, software. The software entity(ies) transmit a 'weapon' - a sentient computer virus - back to the SGC, where it hijacks the computers and, eventually, [[Samantha Carter]].<ref>{{cite episode|episodelink=Entity (Stargate SG-1)| title=Entity| series=Stargate SG-1}}</ref>
{{-}}

==Pegasus Galaxy aliens==
===Wraith===
[[Image:Steve the Wraith (Stargate).jpg|thumb|The Wraith "Steve"]]{{main|Wraith (Stargate)}}
The Wraith are the dominant species of the Pegasus Galaxy. This hive-based species drove the Ancients out of the Pegasus Galaxy around [[8000 BC]], and are currently the primary [[antagonist]]s of ''Stargate Atlantis''. They maintain thousands of worlds, populated by humans, as sources of food, and they feed off the life-force of other beings. The Wraith are part human-ancient and part insect. In the Pegasus Galaxy a genetic trait exists among certain species such that, by a complex chemical and enzymical process as yet not understood by man, they feed on either time or life (victims tend to "lose years"). This trait is enhanced in the Wraith. They still maintain vestigial human organs such as stomachs and are capable of eating human food but derive no sustenance from it. Since the Wraith are descended from Ancients they presumably had some Ancient technology which helped them to overcome the original Ancients and makes them a formidable adversary today.

===Asurans===
[[Image:Oberoth (Progeny).jpg|thumb|The Asuran Oberoth]]
{{main|Asuran}}
The second "evil" race of aliens in the Pegasus Galaxy. They are artificial lifeforms, similar to the Replicators faced by SG-1, and may as well ultimately be the very first generation of Replicators, that evolved from a Lantean experiment to create powerful and aggressive nanites to attack the Wraith on a cellular level.<ref>{{cite episode|  episodelink=Hot Zone (Stargate Atlantis)| title=Hot Zone| series=Stargate Atlantis}}</ref> But the microscopic creatures came together to form increasingly larger and more complex organisms, eventually imitating their creators to become human in appearance. When the Lanteans realized their experiment had gotten out of hand, they attacked this new race with their fleet of warships and nearly wiped them out ([[Progeny (Stargate Atlantis)|"Progeny"]]).

{{-}}

===Lesser known alien races===
*'''"Mist" Beings''': Intelligences that compose the mist covering M5S-224. They are made mostly of energy. Whenever the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] is activated on their world, thousands of their species die from the Stargate's attempting to process their lifeforce as energy (the design of the gate is such that it seeks energy in any possible form). Because they are energy in nature, the life forms provided a brief power surge on Stargate activation. [[Rodney McKay]] devised a method to dial Earth from M5S-224; however this would have resulted in millions of alien deaths to establish the wormhole, thus the aliens placed the Atlantean team into a "fabricated reality" in a desperate attempt to save themselves. It took the diplomatic skills of [[Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)|Dr. Weir]] to convince the energy creatures to allow the expedition team to return to Atlantis and ensure the Atlantean expedition would not threaten their world in such a way again.
*'''Shadow Creatures''': A creature contained by the Ancients in Atlantis to research more on ascension. In 2004, the young Athosian Jinto accidentally released it while playing hide and seek. Dr. Rodney McKay managed to send to it through the Stargate to a barren planet.
*'''The Beast''': A semi-transparent creature that inhabited the Sanctuary. It terrorized those who sought ascension. The only way to stop it, was for those whose fears it had manifest from, to stand up to it. The beast itself is thought to be the subconscious fears represented in a telekinetic form. Capable of acting on the world around it, but nothing could act upon it.
*'''Crystals''': The crystals are in some way, similar to the 'Unity' in SG-1, however the crystal's intentions is somewhat hostile. The crystals glow and somehow makes people touch them. The entity will stay in the toucher until physical contact with other people, where they will create nightmares in the form personification of the first person touching the crystal. The nightmares will be more severe for each person and has the ability to kill them during the nightmares, causing the victims to die for real. The Atlantis expedition encountered them in a dark, jungle-like planet. The crystal actually killed an expedition member Dr Kate Heightmeyer, but was stopped before it could kill anyone else and the entity was sent back to the planet.
*'''Iratus Bug''': The [[Iratus Bug]] is a beetle-like insect found on at least two planets in the Pegasus galaxy,including the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] homeworld.  It is believed, from information accessed in the Atlantean database, that the Wraith evolved when human DNA was combined with the DNA of the insect.  [[Carson Beckett|Dr. Carson Beckett]] has developed a retrovirus that would, theoretically, strip all the insect DNA from a Wraith, leaving only human biology.

==Other galaxy aliens==
===Ancients===
[[Image:Orlin.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Orlin (Ascended form)]]{{main|Ancient (Stargate)}}
An originally human race that learned to advance beyond their corporeal forms, the Ancients inhabited Earth millions of years ago after leaving their distant home galaxy in order to escape their brethren, the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]]. Before leaving for the [[Milky Way]], the Ancients were known as the [[Alterans]], a fact discovered by humans on Earth after the discovery of a great Ancient treasury in England. The same repository helped the SGC learn that Merlin the wizard was an ancient who helped King Arthur to ascend, and that the sword in the stone of legend truly existed to test purity of heart in order to determine whether a person was deserving of the secrets of the Ancients. They were the central party of the alliance of the [[Four Great Races]], and are credited with building of the entire system of [[Stargate (device)|stargates]]. They possessed technology that still surpasses anything known throughout the ''Stargate'' science-fiction universe. Only the Ori are thought to match their understanding of the universe.  As many other races are associated with civilizations on Earth, the Ancients are associated with the Romans.  As the Romans built a network of highways and roads that connected their empire and the known world,  the Ancients built a network of stargates in multiple galaxies connecting worlds within themselves and to those of others of different galaxies.

After establishing the gate system in the Milky Way galaxy, the vast majority of the Ancients were wiped out by a plague, and they left for the Pegasus galaxy in the flying city of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] several million years ago, where they seeded an intricate system of planets with both stargates and humans.  They were forced out of the Pegasus galaxy by the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]], who were a result of an unintended genetic mixture of a native Pegasus insect, the [[Iratus bug]], and the humans seeded on the planet native to the bug. 

Although their technology was far superior to the Wraith's, they were vastly outnumbered and the Wraith eventually culled them down until all the unascended Ancients left in Pegasus were kept under siege in Atlantis for many years. Finally accepting that they would never defeat the Wraith, they submerged the city of Atlantis and returned to Earth to live out the rest of their lives there some ten thousand years ago. There they passed on some of their genes to humans, including what came to be known as the [[Ancient Technology Activation gene]] (or ATA gene), allowing those in possession of it to use Ancient technology while those without cannot. Few Ancients are known to exist on the mortal plane of existence, having [[Ascension (Stargate)|ascended]] to a higher state of being.

===Asgard===
[[Image:Asgardalien.jpg|thumb|An Asgard]]{{main|Asgard (Stargate)}}
Physically identical to Roswell [[Greys]], and, according to ''Stargate'', accounting for them, the Asgard are a benevolent, highly advanced and evolved race who have visited Earth on many occasions from the galaxy Ida, and who also gave rise to the [[Norse mythology|Norse legends]]. Whilst still posing as Gods to many pretechnological races, they do this to help that race grow, and leave tests such that, when the race advances enough, they will return to them and show them their true forms. They were a prominent member of the alliance of the [[Four Great Races]].

The Asgard have established the [[Protected Planets Treaty]] with the [[Goa'uld]], which was expanded to include the [[Tau'ri]] in Season 3. This means that the Goa'uld cannot attack Earth without incurring the wrath of the Asgard - but this hasn't stopped them throughout the course of the show.

Thor, as Supreme Commander of the Asgard, expressed to the Tau'ri the regret the Asgard had over allowing the Goa'uld to spread and enslave humans throughout the galaxy. If it weren't for the threat of the Replicators in the Ida Galaxy, they would have prevented the Goa'uld rise to power long before they became a serious threat.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Fair Game (Stargate SG-1)| title=Fair Game| series=Stargate SG-1}}</ref>

The Asgard are no longer able to reproduce in the traditional sense, and must use cloning technology in order to survive by cloning their bodies and then transplanting their minds into the new one. During the transplant process the consciousness of the individual is "downloaded" into their ships' computers. They were constantly at war with the [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicators]] until the end of Season 8.

As far as is known at the present time, all the Asgard died on Orilla when they performed an act of mass euthanasia. The only known Asgard unaccounted for is [[Hermiod]].

===Ori===
{{main|Ori (Stargate)}}
[[Image:Ori Ascended Being.jpg|thumb|An Ori being shoots past [[Daniel Jackson]]]]The most fearsome and terrible threat in the cosmos, the Ori are Ascended beings who use their infinite knowledge of the universe to force lesser beings to worship them. In essence, they used to be Ancients, however they split into separate groups due to different views of life. The Ori are religious while the Ancients prefer science.

The Ori sway lesser-developed planets into worshipping them by promising Ascension through an invented and empty religion called "Origin". This religion states that they created humanity and as such are to be worshipped by their creations. It also promises its followers that, on death, they will Ascend. However, Origin was designed to channel energy from the human worshippers to the Ori. As such, the Ori never help anyone else Ascend because then they would have to share the power that they sap from their worshippers. Their ultimate goal is to completely destroy the Ascended Ancients, who they know as "the Others".

As Ascended beings, the Ori do not interfere directly in the mortal plane. They use instead humans called [[Prior (Stargate)|Priors]], which they artificially evolve so that they are one step from Ascension, giving the Priors godly powers. Because the Ori have worshippers across the entire home galaxy of the Ancients, and using their knowledge to spread, they are nearly unstoppable.

===Replicators===

A potent mechanical lifeform using a quiron-based technology composed of building blocks using [[nanotechnology]]. They strive to increase their numbers and spread across the universe by assimilating advanced technologies. They are hostile to all other lifeforms in the universe, but are opposed primarily by the Asgard. In the episode "[[Unnatural Selection (Stargate SG-1)|Unnatural Selection]]", the Replicators had developed human-form Replicators, based on the technology they extracted from their Android creator, that appear just like humans and are able to change their form. Standard Replicators are resistant to energy weapons, and can only be destroyed by projectile weapons. Human-form Replicators, on the other hand, are resistant to projectile weapons as well due to the change in their nature from large blocks to smaller units the size of organic cells (cell blocks).

In the episode "[[New Order (Stargate SG-1)|New Order (Part 2)]]", an [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] weapon called the Replicator Disruptor was developed by [[Jack O'Neill (Stargate)|Jack O'Neill]] while he still had the knowledge of the Ancients in his mind. It works by blocking the cohesion between the blocks that make up the Replicators. The Replicators in the Milky Way galaxy were wiped out by the [[Dakara Superweapon]] in the two-part episode "[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning]]" at the climax of Season 8.
