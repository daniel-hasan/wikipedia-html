The '''Roman Catholic Church in Afghanistan''' is part of the worldwide [[Roman Catholic Church]], under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]] and [[curia]] in [[Rome]]. There are very few Catholics in this overwhelmingly [[Islamic]] country - just over 100 attend mass in its only chapel - and freedom of religion has been difficult to obtain in recent times, especially under the former [[Taliban]] regime. On 16 May 2002, [[Pope John Paul II]] established a [[mission sui iuris]] for [[Afghanistan]] with Father [[Giuseppe Moretti (priest)|Giuseppe Moretti]] as its first superior. The only Catholic church in the country is the chapel at the [[Italy|Italian]] embassy in [[Kabul]]. In 2004, the [[Missionaries of Charity]] arrived in Kabul to carry out humanitarian work. 

==History of the Catholic Church in Afghanistan==
Legend from the [[Apocrypha|apocrypha]]l [[Gospel of Thomas]] and other ancient documents suggests that Saint Thomas preached in [[Bactria]], which is today northern Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web | author= Merillat, Herbert Christian| year=1997| title=Wandering in the East| format= | work= The Gnostic Apostle Thomas| url=http://members.aol.com/didymus5/ch19.html| accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> The [[Nestorians]] planted Christianity in the area, and there have been 9 bishops and dioceses in the region, including [[Herat]] (424-1310), [[Farah]] (544-1057), [[Kandahar]], and [[Balkh]].

===The 20th Century===
Italy was the first country to recognise Afghanistan’s independence in 1919, and the Afghan government asked how it could thank Italy. Rome requested the right to build a chapel, which was then being requested by international technicians then living in the Afghan capital. A clause giving Italy the right to build a chapel within its embassy was included to Italian-Afghan treaty of 1921, and that same year the [[Barnabites]] arrived to start giving pastoral care.<ref>{{cite web | author=| year=September 29, 2003| title=ASIA/AFGHANISTAN - BARNABITE FATHERS 70 YEARS OF SERVICE IN AFGHANISTAN: KABUL MISSION FIRST STEP FOR GROWTH OF LOCAL CHURCH” SAYS NUNCIO TO PAKISTAN, ARCHBISHOP ALESSANDRO D’ERRICO| format= | work= Fides| url=http://www.fides.org/eng/news/2003/0309/29_807.html| accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> The actual pastoral work began in 1933 when the chapel international technicians had asked for was built.<ref name= "Afghan">{{cite web | author=| year=October 12, 2005| title=A “public” church in Afghanistan?

The Catholic community in Afghanistan is mainly made of foreigners, especially aid workers, and no Afghans currently are part of the Church, mainly due to great social and legal pressure not to convert to non-Islamic religions. Some Afghans have converted while overseas, but keep it secret when they return.<ref>{{cite web | author=Barker, Kim | year=March 22, 2006| title=Afghan man faces death after leaving Islam for Christianity| format= | work=Chicago Tribune | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0603210143mar21,1,938137.story|accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> Despite this, the community has grown from only a few nuns to a full Sunday Mass of around 100.<ref name ="catacombs">{{cite web | author=Caffulli, Giuseppe | year=January 30, 2004| title=A Church of the catacombs, made up of only foreigners | format= | work= Asianews.it | url=http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&art=314| accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref>
