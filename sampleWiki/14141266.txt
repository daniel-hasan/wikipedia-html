[[Ezra]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''{{lang|ar|عزير}}''', ''{{lang|ar-Latn|'Uzair}}'', [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''{{lang|tr|Üzeyir}}'') is a biblical priest who is usually believed by Muslim commentators to be the figure mentioned in the Qur'anic verse {{cite quran|9|30|style=nosup|expand=no}} and worshiped by Jews as "the son of God".<ref name="EoI"/> Although not explicitly mentioned in [[Quran]] among the prophets, Ezra is considered as one of the prophets by some Muslim scholars, based on Islamic traditions. Ezra lived between the times of King [[Solomon]] and the time of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]], father of [[John the Baptist]].<ref name="shahid"> {{cite book

</ref> On the other hand, Muslim scholars such as Mutahhar al-Maqdisi and [[Al-Juwayni|Djuwayni]] and notably [[Ibn Hazm]] and [[Ibn Yahyā al-Maghribī al-Samaw'al|al-Samaw'al]] accused Ezra (or one of his disciples) of falsification of the Scriptures. <ref name="EoI"/>

==In the Qur'an==
One Qur'anic verse ({{cite quran|9|30|style=ref}}) refers to a certain Uzayr (Arabic: عزير) worshiped by Jews as "the son of God". Uzayr is usually identified by Muslim commentators with the biblical Ezra, or sometimes with a man who slept for three hundred years. Modern scholars have also suggested the Biblical [[Enoch]], [[Azazel]] and [[Osiris]].<ref name="EoI"> [[Encyclopaedia of Islam|Encyclopedia of Islam]], ''Uzayr'' </ref>

==In Islamic tradition==
He is mentioned in [[Sahih Muslim]] in ''The Book of Faith'' as:
<blockquote>...Then the Jews would be summoned, and it would be said to them: What did you worship? They will say: We worshipped 'Uzair, son of Allah. It would be said to them: You tell a lie; Allah had never had a spouse or a son... {{muslim-usc|1|352}} </blockquote>

Also, according to Ibn 'Abbas and Al-Hassan Al-Basri, ''the prophet'' mentioned in the following tradition is Uzair <ref name="shahid" />:
<blockquote>Abu Haraira said that he heard Muhammad say, "An ant bit ''a prophet'' amongst the prophets, and that he ordered that the place of the ants be burnt. So, God inspired to him, 'Is it because one ant bit you that you burnt a nations amongst the nations that glorify God?</blockquote>

In some Islamic narrations, [[Ezra]] is the person mentioned in the following Qur'anic verse <ref name="kathir" />:
<blockquote>Or (take) the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet, all in ruins to its roofs. He said: "Oh! how shall Allah bring it (ever) to life, after (this) its death?" but Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: "How long didst thou tarry (thus)?" He said: (Perhaps) a day or part of a day." He said: "Nay, thou hast tarried thus a hundred years; but look at thy food and thy drink; they show no signs of age; and look at thy donkey: And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people, Look further at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh." When this was shown clearly to him, he said: "I know that Allah hath power over all things." ({{cite quran|2|259|style=ref}})</blockquote>

After resurrection, he rode on his donkey and entered his native place. But the people did not recognize him, nor did his household, except the maid, who was now an old blind woman. He prayed to God to cure her blindness and she could see again. He meets his son who recognized him by a mole between his shoulders and was older than him. Ezra then led the people to locate the only surviving copy of [[Torah]] as the remaining were burnt by [[Nebuchadnezzar]]. He thus renovated the [[Torah]] to [[Children of Israel|the Children of Israel]]. [[Ibn Kathir]] mentions that the ''sign'' in the phrase "And that We may make of thee a ''sign'' unto the people" was that he was younger than his children <ref name="kathir" />.

==Quranic statements about perceived Jewish exaltation==
The Quran says that Jews exalted [[Ezra]] as a "son of God."
<blockquote>The Jews call 'Uzair a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. Allah's curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the Truth! ({{cite quran|9|30|style=ref}})</blockquote>
<blockquote>They take their priests (Ahbar) and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of Allah, and (they take as their Lord) Christ the son of Mary; yet they were commanded to worship but One Allah: there is no god but He. Praise and glory to Him: (Far is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him).({{cite quran|9|31|style=ref}})</blockquote>

According to John Kaltner, the Qur'anic verse on Ezra is the only place where the Qur'an accuses Jews of [[polytheism]] and that this reference is obscure and remains a mystery.<ref name = "Kaltner" /> G. D. Newby, pointing out to the books that were in circulation among the Jewish population in Hijaz, states that “It is easy, then, to imagine that among the Jews of the Hijaz who were apparently involved in mystical speculations associated with the ''merkabah'', Ezra, because of the traditions of his translation, because of his piety, and particularly because he was equated with Enoch as the Scribe of God, could be termed one of the ''Bene Elohim'' [son of God].

According to Horovitz, “Muhammad could have heard about Jewish or [[Judeo-Christian]] sects that venerated Ezra in the way other sects venerated Melchizedek.”<ref name="EoQ"> Abu-Rabiʿ, Ibrahim M. "Ezra ." Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān. General Editor:  Jane  Dammen  McAuliffe, Georgetown University, Washington DC. Brill, 2007. Brill Online.</ref> According to Ibrahim M. Abu-Rabi, the relevant qur'anic text should in any case be understood in the context of the Muslim-Jewish relations that was replete with theological arguments between the nascent [[Ummah|Muslim community]] and the well-established Jewish community in Medina. Rabi states that for the Qur'an, even a minute association of a creature with God is not acceptable and that this verse aims to distinguish the Muslim community from the existing Christian and the Jewish community. Even so, Rabi says, this would not explain why Ezra should be considered the son of God; Is Uzayr really Ezra, Rabi questions.<ref name="EoQ"/> Some modern scholars have suggested that Uzayr might actually refer to the Biblical [[Enoch]], [[Azazel]] or [[Osiris]].<ref name="EoI"> [[Encyclopaedia of Islam|Encyclopedia of Islam]], ''Uzayr'' </ref>

According to Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, later Muslim authors who heard from their contemporary Jews and Christians that the accusation of sonship had no basis mentioned three types of explanation: [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] said that only one Jew (Finhas) viewed Uzra as the son of God, [[Ibn Hazm]] said that only a small group of Jews worshipped ʿUzayr as a son of God in some past period. And others like Qurtubi said that the verse refers to the extreme admiration of Jews for their doctors of law.<ref name="EoI"/>

[[Ibn Kathir]], in his Qur'anic commentary, narrates a tradition on the authority of [[Abdullah Ibn Abbas]] saying that the Jews exalted Ezra because he could write down the Torah out of his memory; Moses could receive the Torah in the form of a book while Uzair got it without a book.<ref name="kathir" /> According to Islamic scholar [[Baidawi|Al Baidawi]], when Jews returned from ''Babylonish captivity'', no one remembered the ''[[Tawrat]]'' and it was lost, hence God raised Ezra from the dead. Upon seeing him being raised from the dead, Jews exalted him to be the Son of God.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=JherW50tVyAC&pg=PA114&dq=uzair+ezra+islam&as_brr=3&ei=_BkvR5WeAoKAsgPUzKChCQ&sig=5i1Fiq01TVLkK6jsU-IHaogRvng A Dictionary of Islam By Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes, pg 114]</ref> Moreover, the Quran further adds that despite Jews and christians were "commanded to worship but One Allah" through scriptures, yet they exalted their clergy as Lords.<ref>Quran 9:31</ref>

===Jewish tradition and literature===
A fundamental tenet of [[Judaism]] is that God is not bound by any limitations of time, matter, or space, and that the idea of any person being God, a part of God, or a mediator to God, is heresy.<ref>
*[[Maimonedes]], [[Mishneh Torah]], Yesodei Hatorah, Chapter 1
*''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth]]'', II:5
*[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tmm/tmm08.htm Exod. Rabba 29], “…I am the first, I have no father; I am the last, I have no brother; Beside Me there is no God; I have no son.”
</ref> The [[Book of Ezra]], which Judaism accepts as a chronicle of the life of Ezra and which predates Muhammad and the Qur'an by around 1000 years, gives Ezra's human lineage as being the son of Seraiah and a direct descendant of [[Aaron]] ({{Bibleref|Ezra|7:1|HE}}–{{Bibleref|Ezra|7:5|HE}}). Tractate [[Ta'anit (Talmud)|Ta'anit]] of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], which predates Muhammad by two to three hundred years, states explicitly that “if a man claims to be God, he is a liar.”<ref> [[Ta'anit (Talmud)|Ta'anit]] (2:1)</ref>

The Qur'anic verse on Ezra appears in one of [[Maimonides|Maimonides's]] discussions about the relationship between Judaism and Islam where he says “…they [Muslims] lie about us [Jews], and falsely attribute to us the statement that God has a son.”<ref name="Shapiro">{{cite journal

[[Abraham Geiger]] remarked the following concerning the claim that Jews believed Ezra to be the son of God: “According to the assertion of Muhammad the Jews held Ezra to be the Son of God. This is certainly a mere misunderstanding which arose from the great esteem in which Ezra was undoubtedly held. This esteem is expressed in the following passage ‘Ezra would have been worthy to have made known the law if Moses had not come before him.’ Truly Muhammad sought to cast suspicion on the Jews’ faith in the unity of God, and thought he had here found a good opportunity of so doing.” <ref>[[Abraham Geiger]]'s book Judaism and Islam chapter 2 part 4</ref>

In [[Karaite Judaism]], mourners use the word "meharef" to represent a whole range of Muslim anti-Jewish polemic including the notion that Jews considered Ezra to be the son of God. Salmon b. Yeruhim said: “A meharef is one who reviles [us] for sins we have committed and others which we have not. The former includes our worshipping the calves, killing the prophets and the like. The latter, our assertion that 'Uzayr [Ezra] was the son [of God]…”<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=MzqwUksGUrkC&pg=RA1-PA193&dq=ezra+jews+quran&sig=fbOsyb0Xif-XuWYIrA0Yi2ifdf0#PRA1-PA193,M1|Search Scripture Well: Karaite Exegetes and the Origins of the Jewish Bible, By Daniel H.

== Accusations of falsification ==
[[Ibn Hazm]], an Andalusian Muslim scholar, explicitly accused Ezra of being a liar and a heretic who falsified and added interpolations into the Biblical text. Ibn Hazm provided a polemical list of what he considered "chronological and geographical inaccuracies and contradictions; theological impossibilities (anthropomorphic expressions, stories of fornication and whoredom, and the attributing of sins to prophets), as well as lack of reliable transmission ([[tawatur]]) of the text", Hava Lazarus-Yafeh states. <ref name="EoI"/><ref name="EoI-Tahrif"> Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, ''Tahrif'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]] </ref> In response to attacks on the personality of Ezra, the [[Leo III the Isaurian|Byzantine Emperor Leo III]] defended Ezra as a pious, reliable person.<ref name="EoI-Tahrif"/>The Jewish convert to Islam [[Ibn Yahyā al-Maghribī al-Samaw'al|al-Samaw'al]] (d. 1175) accused Ezra of interpolating stories such as Gen. 19:30-8 in the Bible in order to sully David’s origins and to prevent the rule of the [[Davidic line|Davidic dynasty]] during [[Second Temple|the second Temple]].<ref name="EoI"/>
The writings of [[Ibn Hazm]] and [[Ibn Yahyā al-Maghribī al-Samaw'al|al-Samaw'al]] was adopted and updated only slightly by later Muslim authors up to contemporary times.<ref name="EoI"/><ref name="EoI-Tahrif"/>

According to Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, the early writers seem to have been influenced with the idea of falsification of the scriptures already present in the [[Jahiliyyah|pre-Islamic]] sources and well-known among Christians and Jews, who had written in their refutation.<ref name="EoI"/>
