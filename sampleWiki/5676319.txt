The '''Feminist Sex Wars''', '''Lesbian Sex Wars''', or simply the '''Sex Wars''' or '''Porn Wars''', refers to the acrimonious debates within the [[feminist]] movement and [[lesbian]] community in the late 1970s through the 1980s around the issues of feminist strategies regarding sexuality, sexual representation, [[pornography]], [[sadomasochism]], the role of [[transwomen]] in the lesbian community, and other sexual issues. The debate pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and the feminist movement ended up deeply divided as a result. 

The Feminist Sex Wars are often viewed as the event that signaled the end of the [[Second-wave feminist]] era.
