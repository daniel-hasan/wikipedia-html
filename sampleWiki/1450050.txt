This article lists the characters from [[manga]] and [[anime]] series '''''[[School Rumble]]'''''.  Most of the primary characters' names coincide with train stations/lines, street names, or geographical landmarks in [[Japan]], particularly centered around the [[Kansai]] region.

==Class 2-C==
The students in class 2-C include a large number of the central characters in ''[[School Rumble]]''. 2-C is one of the six classes for second year students attending Yagami High School, taught by Hayato Tani. The class develops a fierce rivalry with 2-D, although the two classes often set aside their differences to plan events together.

''First appearance:'' #17: Field of Dreams

{{anime voices|Daisuke Kishio|David Trosko}}

Imadori is the class's number two pervert (the pervert ringleader being Ganji Nishimoto).  He has the special skill of knowing a girl's bra size just by looking at her chest. Interested only in girls with breast sizes of D or larger, the main targets of his flirting are the well-endowed Mikoto Suo and Lala Gonzalez, and he continues to pursue them constantly although they are strong enough to beat him down. Imadori has some physical abilities, such as being strong enough to grapple Hanai to a standstill. He works in a hair salon called "Now Bird", which his family owns. He enjoys the [[tokusatsu]] show "Hatenkou Robo Dozibiron" (a [[Super Sentai]]/[[Power Rangers]] parody). Despite constantly avoiding any involvement with Ichijō, he sometimes shows some interest in her, such as when he was admiring her singing during the cultural festival party. He also has a more sensitive side to him, which he shows towards Lala when he tries to get her to smile at her part-time job, even at the cost of getting walloped by her.

{{main|Haruki Hanai}}

{{-}}

*'''Kentarou Nara''' (奈良 健太郎 ''Nara Kentarō'')
[[Image:SR11 Nara.jpg|150px|left|Kentarō Nara]]
''First appearance:'' #36: Boy meets Girl

{{anime voices|Yuuki Tai|Todd Haberkorn}}

Kentarō Nara is a side character who has feelings for Tenma, but his attempts to get closer to her are often foiled by Harima. Curiously, according to the mangaka, his original intentions were to have Nara as the series' main character, but somehow he was relegated to a supporting role. He is now often seen as a reluctant participant in various escapades with Yoshidayama and Nishimoto. Nara is both a [[Nara|city]] and [[Nara prefecture|prefecture]] in the [[Kansai]] region of Japan, near [[Kyoto]].
{{-}}

*'''Karen Ichijō'''
''First appearance:'' #47: Girl Fight

''Voiced by:'' [[Yuuka Nanri]] (Japanese, 1st series, OVA), [[MAKO]] (2nd series), [[Carrie Savage]] (English)

Ichijō has monstrous strength despite having a weak and feminine appearance and is a member of the amateur wrestling club. Her power amazes even her strongest male classmates (i.e., she is arguably even stronger than Harima and Hanai in terms of raw muscle strength, for she could carry a piano without any signs of physical stress, while the other two were on the verge of breakdown while trying hard to carry objects of the same size). It would also seem that she is not able to control her strength well, as shown when she nearly suffocates Tenma when trying to cover her mouth so that she does not blurt out secrets. Lala Gonzalez is her only rival in this regard, but has not been able to physically defeat her (In fact, Ichijo defeated her with her ultimate move, the "Frankensteiner"). Despite this, Ichijō has not reciprocated Lala's antagonism, always remaining polite towards her. Later the two seem to have developed into friends.

Despite her strength she has a kind nature and is one of the more timid girls in 2-C. She is in love with Imadori, but gets embarrassed when this is hinted at. Imadori also initially avoids her, not only because of her small measures (later it is revealed that she does have considerably large breasts), but also because he fears her strength. She is also a good singer, and her singing is featured in episodes 2 and 6 of ''School Rumble - Second Term''.

When Imadori met her practicing wrestling and asked her why she liked it, she said that she really did not want to do wrestling. Later, when Imadori, along with Harima and Hanai were working for a moving company, they found out that Ichijō was also working with them as well as how strong she was. At the end of their shift, Imadori accidentally said that he could take Karen out on a date with his earnings, which Karen agrees to, even though Imadori did not really mean it.

Ichijō-dōri is the northernmost of Kyoto's numbered east-west avenues, which in the east extends to the [[Kyoto University]] campus and the precincts of [[Yoshida Shrine]].

*'''Hiroyoshi Asou''' (麻生 広義 ''Asō Hiroyoshi'')

He is good at cooking Chinese food and works part-time at a Chinese restaurant together with Sarah Adiemus of 1-D. 

Asō is reputed to be popular among girls, although this is not explicitly shown.  He, on the other hand, does not appear to have much interest in girls with the exception of Mikoto, who he dated several times.  Their relationship progressed to the point of Mikoto's parents inviting him over to a family dinner.  The two have since broken up, for reasons not made entirely clear.

*'''Ganji Nishimoto''' (西本 願司 ''Nishimoto Ganji'')

{{anime voices|Shun Takagi|Jaime Rivera}}

Ganji Nishimoto is a huge but timid figure, and is the proud leader of the perverts of the class. His family operates a video store, and he is known to host "ero meetings" discussing girls.

He has feelings for Eri, but later turns to Tae Anegasaki, the school's infirmary nurse. Yoshidayama plays a lead role when with his two friends Nara and Nishimoto. After bathing, he usually wears his hair in two pigtails, making him look like a female from behind. His birthday is on [[February 14]]. However, he doesn't receive any chocolate from any girls on Valentines' Day, which makes him really depressed. Harima usually mistakenly calls Yoshidayama as "Yoshida (吉田)".

==Class 2-D==

Later in the series, some of the 2-D students befriend some of those in 2-C and start to hang out with them. Several 2-D members resemble characters from the [[Zeon]] faction of [[Mobile Suit Gundam]], as befitting their role of rivals.

[[Image:SR Tennouji.jpg|150px|left|Tennōji Noboru]]

*'''Harry Mackenzie''' (ハリー マッケンジー ''Harī Makkenjī'')
''First appearance:'' #69: The McKenzie Break

{{anime voices|Nobuyuki Hiyama}}
[[Image:SR 2-D.jpg|thumb|right|Masakazu Tougou (left) and Harry Mackenzie (right)]]
Harry Mackenzie is a blonde-haired exchange student, skilled at fighting and a rival of Harima and Hanai. His name sounds like Harima's name when pronounced fast, which leads to more than a few misunderstandings between the two. He rides a gold-coloured motorcycle with a Hyaku decal and often wears red clothing and red shades, making him a parody of the character [[Char Aznable]]. His name may come from Harry Ord from [[Turn A Gundam]] and [[Christina MacKenzie]] from [[Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket]]. He was first mentioned in chapter 2 of the manga when Yoshidayama misread his name and told Harima that the latter was in class 2-D.

*'''Lala Gonzalez''' (ララ ゴンザレス ''Rara Gonzaresu'')
''First appearance:'' #60: Trading Places

{{anime voices|Yū Kobayashi|Monica Rial}}

Lala is an exchange student from [[Mexico]], and a skilled practitioner of [[Lucha libre]] fighting. She belongs to the same amateur wrestling club as Ichijō, who she sees her as a rival, often shouting "Ichijō!" when she meets her. Lala dislikes Ichijō's name because her mother, who abandoned her and her father when she was a child, was also named Karen. 

She detests the D-cup-hunting pervert Imadori, especially when he managed to grope her chest while being choked. She thus tends to beats him up whenever she sees him after sufficient provocation. Lala works in the same fast food restaurant as Ichijo, where no one dared to go to her counter because of her violent temper. She even grabs customers that annoy her and drags them inside for a beating. Lala's closest friends appear to be Harry Mackenzie and Masakazu Tougou, who both look out for her.  Later on, her animosity towards Ichijo softens. Her character is the direct opposite of her rival Ichijō, being that she is tall, well-endowed, sour-faced, hot-tempered, and very easily provoked.

*'''Masakazu Tougou''' (東郷 雅一 ''Tōgō Masakazu'')
''First appearance:'' #71: Renegade

{{anime voices|Hiroki Yasumoto}}

Masakazu is 2-D's class representative who sees class 2-C as rivals. Despite his obvious self-confidence, his character leads him to rejections from his classmates. He is a parody of Gundam character, [[Anavel Gato]]. Recently Masakazu has shown some interest in Tenma, to Harima's distress. He is often seen with Harry Mackenzie. Some people around him usually refer to him with an alternate nickname "Macaroni", probably because he likes to put Italian words in his sentences. He has a tendency to burst into extremely long inspirational speeches either involving 'facing challenges head on' or 'how to be manly'. As the series progressed, his self-confidence and passion for facing challenges 'head on' have become so extreme that his actions and ideas often border on shear-stupidity and often contain a startling lack of regard for the safety and well-being of others, like when he said that they should just charge the ocean liner the students (including himself) were in straight into a giant reef instead of going around it because it was 'the manly thing to do'. His appearance is often followed by the US national anthem.

==Class 1-D==
Class 1-D is a first year class in Yagami High School. Some of these characters are siblings of the second year students.
*'''Yakumo Tsukamoto'''
{{main|Yakumo Tsukamoto}}

The best friend of [[Yakumo Tsukamoto]], Sarah is distinguished by her blonde hair done up in a bun.  She is a British girl raised in an orphanage, and is a relative newcomer to Japan.  She is frequently seen together with Yakumo, as they are classmates and members of the Tea Club.  With her cheerful and positive attitude, she does her best to support Yakumo, particularly on the latter's relationship with [[Kenji Harima]] and her difficulties with the unwanted attentions of [[Haruki Hanai]]. She stayed over with Yakumo to accompany her while Tenma was away for the Kyoto trip.

Sarah has several part-time jobs outside school.  She is a nun at a local church, performing duties such as hearing confessions, playing the organ, and babysitting children.  Although her position as a nun may preclude her from pursuing romantic relationships, she reveals in a conversation with [[Akira Takano]] that she may have an eye on someone; furthermore, at least one hopeful student has expressed interest in her. Aside from her duties as a nun, Sarah also works with Hiroyoshi Asō of 2-C at a Chinese restaurant, waiting tables and cooking.

*'''Itoko Osakabe''' (刑部 絃子 ''Osakabe Itoko'')
''First appearance:'' Volume 2, Special Chapter: The Time Machine

{{anime voices|Yuu Asakawa|Stephanie Young}}

The [[physics]] teacher and Harima's cousin. Itoko is Harima's roommate and takes care of him. Though she does not show it, she does care for him and realises just how much Tenma has changed him. Her figure is admired by the perverted boys of class 2-C. She has a fear that her past would get brought up, and this is a weakness Sasakura uses against her.

"Itoko" is also homonymous with the word "cousin" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] which makes it a pun. Due to this pun, when Harima says "my cousin" it can be mistaken that he is saying "my Itoko". 

Itoko's looks (but definitely not her character) vaguely resembles [[Yukishiro Tomoe]] from [[Ruroni Kenshin]], especially the Tomoe drawn in the [[Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen]] OVA.

[[Image:Youko Sasakura.jpg|150px|right]]

It has also been hinted that she is a lesbian and has always been trying to get closer to Itoko during their high school years. She seems to know (and share) an important part of Itoko's past, and though not deliberately, has used this against Itoko to gain favours or company a few times. She has very good driving skills.

*'''Tae Anegasaki''' (姉ヶ崎 妙 ''Anegasaki Tae'')
[[Image:SR23 Anegasaki.jpg|150px|right]]
''First appearance:'' #29: The Boy Can't Help It

{{anime voices|Sayaka Ohara|Colleen Clinkenbeard}}

The school's infirmary nurse who is also loved by the boys. The fact that she is the infirmary nurse has encouraged many boys to get injured or feign injury so that they can get close to her. Prior to taking this job, she briefly let Harima stay at her apartment when his dream of becoming a ''mangaka'' was temporarily crushed after he found out that his idol, the ''mangaka'' Nijō jō was really Karasuma. Anegasaki is attracted to Harima and calls him affectionately by his pen name "Hario". Her belief in and support of Harima helped him get over his depression and return to school.  She later becomes the faculty sponsor for the girls' basketball team.

Harima refers to her as "Onee-chan" (lit. Older Sister). For the first five volumes of the manga, she is unnamed, and is referred to in the list of characters by this nickname.

''First appearance:'' #60: Trading Places

{{anime voices|Hiroki Yasumoto}}

The [[physical education]] teacher, often referred by the class of 2-C as "Goriyama" (lit. gorilla-mountain)due to his [[gorilla]]-like physique. His methods are very strict and makes it known to every student of Yagami High School (usually the class of 2-C) to adhere in the best manner how a responsible student should be; incidents such as Ganji Nishimoto and his team of perverts loitering in the hallway of the school clinic trying to get a glimpse (or in some cases, incurring harm to themselves just to get tended to) of Tae Anegasaki. Failure to comply with his ideals (if he catches you) will result with some sort of disciplinary punishment.
