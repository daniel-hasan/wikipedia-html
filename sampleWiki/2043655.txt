The '''Manila Metro Rail Transit System''', popularly known as the '''MRT''', '''Metrostar Express''' or '''Metrostar''', is part of the [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] rail system in the [[Metro Manila]] area of the [[Philippines]], the [[Strong Republic Transit System]] (SRTS).<ref name="srts">[http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_071503_GMALaunchesTransit.htm GMA Launches transit system], [[Philippine Star]], [[July 15]], [[2003]]</ref> It has a single line, MRT-3 or the Blue Line.  Although it has characteristics of [[light rail]], such as the type of [[Railroad car|rolling stock]] used, it is more akin to a [[rapid transit]] system.  It is not related to the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System]], a separate but linked system.

The MRT forms part of Metro Manila's rail transport infrastructure, known as the [[Strong Republic Transit System]], and overall [[public transport]] system.  One of its original purposes was to decongest [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA), one of Metro Manila's main thoroughfares and home to the MRT, and many commuters who ride the MRT also take road-based public transport, such as buses, to reach the intended destination from an MRT station.  MRT has been only partially successful in decongesting EDSA, and congestion is further aggravated by the rising number of motor vehicles.<ref name="lto">[http://www.lto.gov.ph/stats2005annual/MVRegisteredCY200320042005.htm NUMBER OF MOTOR VEHICLES REGISTERED: Comparative, JAN.- DEC. 2003, 2004, 2005], [[Land Transportation Office (Philippines)|Land Transportation Office]], [[January 23]], [[2006]]</ref>  The expansion of the system to cover the entire stretch of EDSA is expected to contribute to current attempts to decongest the thoroughfare and to cut travel times.

The MRT is operated by the [[Metro Rail Transit Corporation]] (MRTC), a private company operating in partnership with the [[Department of Transportation and Communications (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] (DOTC) under a [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] (BOT) agreement.

==The MRT network==
{{Template:Manila Metro Rail Transit System|left}}
The single line<ref name="blueline">[http://www.dotcmrt3.gov.ph/route%20map.htm Route Map], [[Metro Rail Transit Corporation]] Passenger Information, retrieved [[July 7]] [[2006]]</ref> serves [[List of Strong Republic Transit System stations#List of MRT stations|13 stations]] on 16.95 kilometres (10.5&nbsp;[[Mile|mi]]) of line.  It is mostly elevated, with some sections [[at-grade intersection|at grade]] or underground.  The line commences at [[Taft Avenue MRT Station|Taft Avenue]] (''Taft'' on the map) and ends at [[North Avenue MRT Station|North Avenue]], serving the cities that EDSA passes through: [[Makati City|Makati]], [[Mandaluyong City|Mandaluyong]], [[Pasay City|Pasay]], [[Pasig City|Pasig]], [[Quezon City]], and [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]].

Taft Avenue and [[Araneta Center-Cubao MRT Station|Araneta Center-Cubao]] are interchanges with the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System|LRT]] network, with Taft Avenue connected to [[EDSA LRT Station|EDSA]] station on the [[Manila LRT Yellow Line|Yellow Line]] and Araneta Center-Cubao connected to its [[Araneta Center-Cubao LRT Station|namesake station]] on the [[Manila LRT Purple Line|Purple Line]].  The line's termini have been designated as transport hubs, where commuters can change to and from take other forms of public transport.

The MRT is open from 5:30 a.m. [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]] ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]+8) until 10:30 p.m.<ref name="times">[http://www.dotcmrt3.gov.ph/operating%20hours.htm Operating Hours and Train Schedule], [[Metro Rail Transit Corporation]] Passenger Information, retrieved [[July 7]] [[2006]]</ref>  Special schedules are announced via the [[public address system|PA system]] in every station and also in [[newspaper]]s and other [[mass media]].  It is open every day of the year except when announced, and during [[Holy Week]], when it is closed for annual maintenance, owing to fewer commuters and lower levels of traffic congestion on EDSA. Normal operation resumes after [[Holy Saturday|Black Saturday]] or [[Easter Sunday]].

==History==
[[Image:EDSA end of MRT.jpg|275px|thumb|right|The end of the tracks looking towards [[North Avenue MRT Station|North Avenue station]], with a stabled train awaiting a clear signal to proceed back into the station]]
[[Image:EDSA Crossings.jpg|275px|thumb|right|Northbound MRT train going out from the Shaw Boulevard Station while southbound vehicles pass through the Crossings Underpass.]]
A metro line on EDSA was envisioned in the plan of [[Electrowatt Engineering Services]] of [[Zürich]] during the construction of the LRT.  The plan consisted of a 150&nbsp;kilometre network of rapid transit lines spanning all major corridors within 20 years, including a line on EDSA.

In the 1990s, the MRTC was awarded a [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] contract by the DOTC.  The DOTC would have ownership of the system and assume all administrative functions, such as the regulation of fares and operations.  The MRTC would have responsibility over construction and maintenance of the system and the procurement of spare parts for trains.  In exchange, the DOTC would pay the MRTC monthly fees for a certain number of years to reimburse any incurred costs.<ref name="background">[http://www.dotcmrt3.gov.ph/history.htm#background Background], [[Metro Rail Transit Corporation]] History, retrieved [[July 7]], [[2006]]</ref>

Construction started on [[September 16]] [[1997]] after the MRTC signed an amended turnkey agreement with a consortium of companies, which included [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] and [[Sumitomo Corporation]], and a local company, [[EEI Corporation]], which was subcontracted for civil works.  A separate agreement was signed with [[ČKD]] on rolling stock.  MRTC also retained the services of [[ICF Kaiser Engineers and Constructors]] to provide program management and technical oversight of the services for the design, construction management and commissioning.<ref name="construction">[http://www.dotcmrt3.gov.ph/history.htm#construction Construction], [[Metro Rail Transit Corporation]] History, retrieved [[July 7]] [[2006]]</ref>

During construction, the MRTC oversaw the design, construction, equipping, testing, and commissioning, while the DOTC oversaw technical supervision of the project activities covered by the BOT contract between the DOTC and MRTC.  The DOTC also sought the services of [[Systra]], a [[France|French]] consultant firm, with regards to the technical competence, experience and track record in the construction and operations.<ref name="construction">[http://www.dotcmrt3.gov.ph/history.htm#construction Construction], [[Metro Rail Transit Corporation]] History, retrieved [[July 7]] [[2006]]</ref>

On [[December 16]] [[1999]], the initial section, from [[North Avenue MRT Station|North Avenue]] to [[Buendia MRT Station|Buendia]], opened, followed on [[July 20]] [[2000]] by the remainder, from Buendia to [[Taft Avenue MRT Station|Taft Avenue]].<ref name="urbanrail">[http://www.urbanrail.net/as/mani/manila.htm MANILA Mass Rail Transit (MRT)], UrbanRail.Net, retrieved [[July 7]] [[2006]]</ref>

Ridership was initially far below expectations, since passengers had to climb long flights of stairs to enter a station, and fares were higher than on the LRT.<ref name="urbanrail">[http://www.urbanrail.net/as/mani/manila.htm MANILA Mass Rail Transit (MRT)], UrbanRail.Net, retrieved [[July 7]] [[2006]]</ref>  Some stations have been retrofitted with [[escalator]]s and [[elevator]]s for easier access, and ridership has increased.  By 2004 MRT had the highest ridership of the three lines, with 400,000 passengers daily.

==Station facilities, amenities, and services==
[[Image:MRT-Approaching.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Taft Avenue MRT Station|Taft Avenue Station]]  platform area]]
[[Image:MRTAyala Station.JPG|thumb|230px|right|The entrance to [[Ayala MRT Station|Ayala]] station as seen from the [[Ayala Center]]]]
[[Image:MRT-LRT Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Bridge linking [[Taft Avenue MRT Station|Taft Avenue Station]] to the nearby [[EDSA LRT Station|EDSA Station]]]]

With the exception of [[Buendia MRT Station|Buendia]] and the platform level of [[Ayala MRT Station|Ayala]] stations, all stations are above ground. 

===Station layout and accessibility===
Stations have a standard layout, with a concourse level and a platform level. The concourse is usually above the platform, with [[stairs]], [[escalator]]s and [[elevator]]s leading down to the platform level.  The levels are separated by fare gates.

The concourse contains ticket booths. Some stations, such as [[Araneta Center-Cubao MRT Station|Araneta Center-Cubao]], are connected at concourse level to nearby buildings, such as shopping malls, for easier accessibility.

Stations either have [[island platform]]s, such as [[Taft Avenue MRT Station|Taft Avenue]] and [[Shaw Boulevard MRT Station|Shaw Boulevard]], or [[side platform]]s, such as [[Ortigas MRT Station|Ortigas]] and [[North Avenue MRT Station|North Avenue]].  Part of the platform at the front of the train is cordoned off for the use of women, children, elderly and disabled passengers.  At side-platform stations passengers may need to enter the concourse area to enter the other platform, while passengers can easily switch sides at stations with island platforms.  Stations have toilets at the concourse level.

Most stations are [[barrier-free]] inside and outside the station, and trains have spaces for [[wheelchair]]-bound passengers.

===Shops and services===
Inside the concourse of all stations is at least one stall or stand where people can buy food or drinks.  Stalls vary by station, and some have fast food stalls.  The number of stalls also varies by station, and stations tend to have a wide variety, especially in stations such as [[Ayala MRT Station|Ayala]] and Shaw Boulevard.  

Stations such as Taft Avenue and North Avenue are connected to or are near shopping malls and/or other large shopping areas, where commuters are offered more shopping varieties.

In cooperation with the [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], passengers are offered a copy of the [[Inquirer Libre]], a free, [[tabloid]]-size, [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] version of the Inquirer, which is available from 6 a.m. at [[Santolan MRT Station|Santolan]], Ortigas, Buendia and Ayala stations.

==Safety==
The MRT has always presented itself as a safe system to travel in.  So far, this has been affirmed by the MRTC, the contractors who built the MRT and even the government, and the MRT has since been able to live up to that reputation.   Safety notices in both [[English language|English]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] are also a common sight at MRT stations and inside MRT trains.

===Incidents and accidents===
Incidents and accidents are rare aboard the MRT, but there have been notable events throughout the MRT's history:

|-
| [[June 28]], [[2004]]
| [[Guadalupe MRT Station|Guadalupe]] and [[Boni MRT Station|Boni]] || A [[catenary wire]] broke between Guadalupe and Boni stations, causing an MRT train to stop between the two stations.  Passengers panicked inside the train and a minor stampede was reported, although no one was hurt.  The wire was believed to have broken due to a fluctuation in the MRT's power supply.  Because of the incident, all MRT services from [[Taft Avenue MRT Station|Taft Avenue]] to [[Shaw Boulevard MRT Station|Shaw Boulevard]] were temporarily suspended.<ref name="power">[http://www.inq7.net/met/2004/jun/29/met_3-1.htm Short circuit stops MRT, causes panic], [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], [[June 28]], [[2004]]</ref>

The [[Abu Sayyaf]] took responsibility for the bombings, which included attacks in [[Davao City]] and [[General Santos City]] that occurred at the same time as the bombing below the MRT.  It is unknown whether any MRT passengers were hurt or killed in the bombing.  The Abu Sayyaf claims that the bombing is their "Valentine's gift" to the President.  Three suspects, one an [[Indonesian people|Indonesian]], were sentenced to death on [[October 28]], [[2005]] for their actions.<ref name="valentines">[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2005/feb/15/yehey/top_stories/20050215top1.html Bloody Valentine: 11 killed in 3 separate bombings,  Abu Sayyaf claims responsibility, AFP on nationwide red alert], [[Manila Times]], [[February 15]], [[2005]]</ref><ref name="death">[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2005/oct/29/yehey/top_stories/20051029top2.html Death for 3 Valentine bombers], [[Manila Times]], [[October 29]], [[2005]]</ref>

Three lanes of EDSA were closed due to the incident, which caused massive traffic jams, while power had to be cut for a few hours after the incident, since portions of the billboard were entangled in the power wires.  MRT services were not interrupted.<ref name="boni">[http://newsinfo.inq7.net/inquirerheadlines/metro/view_article.php?article_id=16351 Fallen billboard causes heavy traffic on EDSA], [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], [[August 21]], [[2006]]</ref>

===Rules===
Passengers at MRT stations are advised to not stay too close to the edge of the platforms to avoid falling onto the tracks.  Passengers are prohibited from eating, drinking or smoking inside the platform area of all MRT stations and inside the trains.  Bags are also inspected for prohibited goods, such as chemicals and knives.  Passengers are also inspected by guards using a handheld [[metal detector]].

For safety and security reasons, persons who are visibly [[intoxication|intoxicated]], [[insanity|insane]] and/or under the influence of [[controlled substances]], persons carrying flammable materials and/or explosives, persons carrying bulky objects or items over 1.5&nbsp;[[metre]]s (5&nbsp;ft) tall and/or wide, and persons bringing pets and/or other [[animal]]s are prohibited from entering the MRT.  Passengers are also prohibited from entering the MRT if bringing products in [[tin can]]s, citing the possibility of home-made [[bomb]]s being concealed inside the cans.<ref name="cans">[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2005/aug/10/yehey/metro/20050810met6.html MRT issues directive imposing ban on tin cans], [[Manila Times]], [[August 10]], [[2005]]</ref>

===Security===
In response to the [[Rizal Day bombings]] and the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks|September 11th attacks]], security has been stepped up onboard the MRT.  The [[Philippine National Police]] has a special MRT police force,<ref name="pnp">[http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_111304_NewTaskForceFormed.htm New task force formed to keep LRT, MRT safe], [[The Daily Tribune (Philippines)|The Daily Tribune]], [[November 13]], [[2004]]</ref> and [[security police]] provided by private companies can be found in all MRT stations.  All MRT stations have a head guard.

The MRT also employs the use of [[closed-circuit television]] inside all stations to monitor suspicious activities and to assure safety and security aboard the line.

Passengers are also advised to look out for thieves, who can take advantage of the crowding aboard MRT trains.  [[Wanted poster]]s are posted at all MRT stations to help commuters identify known thieves.

==Fares and Ticketing==
[[Image:Mrtpass.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A sample MRT stored-value ticket bearing the face of former President [[Joseph Estrada]].]]

The MRT, like the LRT, uses a distance-based fare structure, with fares ranging from ten to fifteen [[Philippine peso|pesos]] (19 to 29 [[United States dollar|U.S. cents]]), depending on the destination.

===Fare structure===
The MRT only uses one fare structure for both single-journey and stored-value ticket holders.  Commuters who ride the MRT are charged 10 pesos for the first three stations, 11 pesos for 4–5 stations, 12 pesos for 6–8 stations, 14 pesos for 9–11 stations and 15 pesos for 12 stations or the entire line.  Children below 1.02&nbsp;metres (3&nbsp;ft&nbsp;4.4&nbsp;in) (the height of a fare gate) may ride for free on the MRT.

===Types of tickets===
Two types of MRT tickets exist: a single-journey (one-way) ticket whose cost is dependent on the destination, and a stored-value (multiple-use) ticket for 100 pesos.  A 200-peso stored-value ticket was issued in the past, but has since been phased out. The single-journey ticket is valid only on the date of purchase. Meanwhile, the stored-value ticket is valid for three months from date of purchase when unused and for one month from date it was first used.

MRT tickets come in three incarnations: one bearing the portrait of [[Joseph Estrada]], which have since been phased out, although some tickets have been recycled due to ticket shortages,<ref name="eraptickets">[http://www.dotc.gov.ph/2005_articles/sept_oct/oct21.htm DOTC: MRT fare could increase by P10 in 2006], [[Philippine Star]], [[October 21]], [[2005]]</ref> one bearing the portrait of [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], and one bearing the logos of the [[Department of Transportation and Communications (Philippines)|DOTC]] and the MRTC.  In the past, the MRT was also forced, other than recycling the old "Erap tickets", to borrow stored-value tickets from the LRT, due to the same ticket shortages.<ref name="tickets">[http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_111203_MrtBorrowsValueTicketsFromLrt.htm MRT borrows value tickets from LRT], [[Manila Times]], [[November 12]], [[2003]]</ref>

Because of the ticket shortages, it is now common practice for regular MRT passengers to purchase several stored-value tickets at a time, since passengers would not know when or what station the tickets would be available at.  Although new stored-value tickets have arrived, passengers still complain of a lack of tickets at stations.<ref name="notickets">[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2005/nov/16/yehey/opinion/20051116opi6.html MRT woes], [[Manila Times]], [[November 16]], [[2005]]</ref>  Passengers also complain of a shortage of single-journey tickets, with long lines at MRT ticket booths already common and with the MRTC having to alleviate the ticket shortages through alternate means.<ref name="tickets2">[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2005/jul/19/yehey/business/20050719bus5.html MRTA incurs losses with pull out of 'Erap tickets'], [[Manila Times]], [[July 19]], [[2005]]</ref>

===The Flash Pass===
{{main article|Manila Light Rail Transit System#The Flash Pass|l1=The Flash Pass}}
[[Image:FlashPass Card.png|thumb|right|A sample Flash Pass Card]]

The system formerly utilized the "Flash Pass", a pass for use on all three rapid transit lines in the [[Metro Manila]] area (the Yellow, Purple and Blue Lines).  The pass costs 250 pesos and may be used for multiple rides on any of the metro lines for one week.  The system was introduced on [[April 19]], [[2004]].<ref name="flashpass">[http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_042004_ForLrt,MrtRiders1Ticket3Lines.htm For LRT, MRT riders: 1 ticket, 3 lines], [[Manila Standard Today]], [[April 20]], [[2004]]</ref>

A Flash Pass consists of two parts: a card, known as a Flash Pass Card, and a ticket, known as a Flash Pass Coupon.  Both components are complementary: a Flash Pass Card is issued when buying a Flash Pass Coupon for the first time, and a Flash Pass Coupon must be used with its corresponding Flash Pass Card.  The one-week validity period of a Flash Pass Coupon only corresponds to the Flash Pass Coupon, since a Flash Pass Card does not expire.

It was believed that the Flash Pass was a precursor to a unified ticketing system utilizing contactless [[smart card]]s, similar to the [[Octopus card]] in [[Hong Kong]] and the [[EZ-Link]] card in [[Singapore]].<ref name="smartcards">[http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_121003_SmartCardsForCommuters.htm LRT, MRT smart cards for commuters], [[Manila Bulletin]], [[December 10]], [[2003]]</ref><ref name="screadiness">[http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_020204_SinglePassRailTicketMayBeRead.htm Single Pass Rail Ticket May Be Ready Ahead of Schedule], [[Manila Times]], [[February 2]], [[2004]]</ref>  However, this project has since been dropped.<ref name="nedadrop">[http://www.neda.gov.ph/odamon/ProjectProfile.asp?ProjectId=1061 INTEGRATED TICKETING SYSTEMS FOR VARIOUS LRT LINES], [[National Economic and Development Authority (Philippines)|National Economic and Development Authority]] Project Profile, retrieved [[April 7]], [[2006]]</ref>  Instead, passengers simply show their Flash Pass coupon to the gatekeeper who will manually open the gate once validated.

===G-Pass===
[[Image:Inquirer Libre with G-Pass.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The G-Pass featured on the [[Inquirer Libre]].]]

In July 2006, [[Globe Telecom]] introduced the G-Pass as an alternative to entering the MRT.  The G-Pass uses a stored-value [[RFID]] chip that is tapped on a sensor on top of the fare gates upon entry and exit from the MRT, instead of a ticket which is inserted through the gate's ticket slot. The chip can be reloaded with MRT fare credits using G-Cash or through a G-Pass reloading booth usually located near a station's ticket counters.  The product is not exclusive to Globe subscribers; however, being a Globe subscriber avoids the queues when reloading a G-Pass, since Globe subscribers can reload using G-Cash.  A G-Pass costs 100 pesos, with 50 pesos worth of free credits upon initial purchase.

While G-Passes can be purchased at all MRT stations, RFID sensors for these passes have only been installed at MRT stations from Ayala to Araneta Center-Cubao.  Installation of G-Pass readers at remaining MRT stations is ongoing, but no formal deadline has been announced by Globe.  To use a G-Pass, at least 16 pesos worth of credits must remain in the chip, corresponding to the maximum MRT fare of the same amount because the system deducts credits after exiting the station of your destination. A maximum of 2000 pesos can be loaded on a G-Pass.  No plans have been made whether the G-Pass will be instituted on the LRT.<ref name="g-pass">[http://www.myglobe.com.ph/gcash/news.asp?articleid=1981 Lakaki, gustong mauna sa loob ng MRT.  Nag-Globe G-PASS], [[Inquirer Libre]], retrieved [[August 21]], [[2006]]</ref>

===Smart Money Pay Pass===
In March 2007, Globe Telecom's main competitor, [[Smart Communications]], forged a partnership with MetroPass Systems to allow MRT passengers to use the upcoming Smart Money [[PayPass]] card to pay for their ride.  The system has not been installed yet on any MRT station and no formal date has been set as to when this method of payment will be rolled-out.<ref name="smartmoneypaypass">[http://www.smart.com.ph/SMART/About+Us/News_Events/200703Metropass.htm Smart, MetroPass team up for electronic pay system in MRT stations], [[Smart Communications]], March 2007.</ref>   

==Rolling stock==
[[Image:MRT Adwrap.jpg|thumb|right|250px|MRT train with [[GE Capital Bank|GE Money Bank]] wrap advertising]]
[[Image:MRT Interior.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Interior of an MRT train]]

The MRT runs light rail vehicles made in the [[Czech Republic]] by [[ČKD]] (now part of [[Siemens AG]]) in a three-car configuration.  The trains are a gift from the [[Politics of the Czech Republic|Czech government]].<ref name="donation">[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2005/jun/21/yehey/business/20050621bus4.html MRT stress and Camp John Hay turmoil], [[Manila Times]], [[June 21]], [[2005]]</ref>  Trains have a capacity of 957 passengers, which is less than the normal capacity of LRT rolling stock.  Unlike original Yellow Line stock at the time, MRT trains came with [[air conditioning]].

MRT trains are particularly known for their use of [[wrap advertising]].  A wide variety of advertisements can be seen on MRT trains, of which some include [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Panasonic]] and [[Epson]] products.  Trains bearing wrap advertising are now very common aboard the MRT, although trains that use MRT's house colours are also in service in the network.  The revenues generated from the advertising on MRT trains are used to pay off debts incurred by the MRTC during the system's construction.

As of 2006, the Department of Transportation and Communications has sealed a deal with the city government of [[Vienna]] to obtain 48 second-hand [[Vienna U-Bahn]] trains as part of the MRT's expansion program, designed to expand the MRT's current capacity of 23,000 passengers per hour per direction (pphpd) to 48,000 pphpd.  The trains are a donation from the Vienna city government.  It is unclear, however, when the trains will arrive and enter service.<ref name="u-bahn">[http://news.inq7.net/metro/index.php?index=1&story_id=76253 DOTC eyes E-payment for commuter trains], [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], [[May 19]], [[2006]]</ref>

===Depot===
The MRT maintains an underground depot in [[Quezon City]], near North Avenue station.  It occupies 84,444 [[square meter]]s (908,948&nbsp;[[Square foot|sq&nbsp;ft]]) of space and serves as the headquarters for light and heavy maintenance of the MRT, as well as the  operations of the system in general.  It is connected to the main MRT network by a [[spur (disambiguation)|spur line]].

The depot is capable of storing 81 light rail vehicles, with the option to expand to include 40 more vehicles as demand arises.  They are parked on nine sets of tracks, which converge onto the spur route and later on to the main network.

==Future expansion==
Although much of the MRT has already been built, the route envisioned by the DOTC and the government in general was for the MRT to traverse the entire length of EDSA, eventually connecting to the Yellow Line at [[Monumento LRT Station|Monumento]] in [[Caloocan City]].  So far, the northern extension of the line has not yet been built and efforts to bid the extension by the [[Department of Transportation and Communications (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] have stalled.  The deadline for the start of construction, 2004, has since been moved to 2007.<ref name="construction2">[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2005/nov/22/yehey/business/20051122bus2.html Document shows govt to begin extension of MRT 3 in two years], [[Manila Times]], [[November 22]], [[2005]]</ref>

In the early 2000s, the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] ruled that a supplementary agreement entered that in 1999 between the DOTC and Metro Rail Transit Corporation, the consortium of companies that built the already-existing portions of the MRT, had lapsed, and as such shall be subject to public bidding.<ref name="doj-mrt3">[http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_073103_MrtIIIwillBeInterconnected.htm MRT III, Phase 2 will be interconnected to LRT I], [[Manila Bulletin]], [[July 31]], [[2003]]</ref>  MRTC subsequently appealed the case to the DOTC, which was later denied, and has even said that if the bidding pushes through, conditions would have to be inserted which would be in favor of MRTC.<ref name="mrtcbid">[http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_082803_RailwayTransitOperatorAppealsAuctionMethod.htm Railway transit operator appeals auction method for MRT- 3  project, MRTC wants to impose condition if gov't  proceeds with the bidding], [[BusinessWorld]], [[August 28]], [[2003]]</ref>  The DOTC countered, claiming that there are legal mechanisms that give the department the authority to compel MRTC to build the extension.<ref name="compel">[http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_070703_DOTCassures.htm DOTC assures public of MRT2, LRT 1 link], [[Manila Standard Today]], [[July 7]], [[2003]]</ref>

The [[National Economic and Development Authority (Philippines)|National Economic and Development Authority]] and even President Arroyo herself have said that the MRT-LRT link at Monumento is a national priority, since it would not only provide seamless service between the LRT and the MRT, but would also help decongest Metro Manila.<ref name="neda">[http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_092104_LrtMrtLinkIsNationalPriority.htm LRT-MRT link is nat'l priority - NEDA], [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], [[September 21]], [[2004]]</ref>  It is estimated that by [[2010]], if the extension is completed, some 684,000 commuters would use the MRT everyday from the present 400,000, and traffic congestion on EDSA would be cut by as much as fifty percent.<ref name="commuters">[http://www.dotc.gov.ph/actioncenter/articles/2005_jan/articles_010405.htm After gov't takeover of NAIA Terminal 3, PGMA orders immediate completion of EDSA MRT extension], [[Department of Transportation and Communications (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] Press Release, [[January 4]], [[2005]]</ref>

Recent developments however indicate that the national government is no longer keen in extending the Blue Line northwards.  Instead, what is prioritized is the eastward extension of the Yellow Line towards North Avenue, traversing through EDSA, in order to link up the two systems.  It is envisaged that the Termini for the Blue and Yellow Lines will connect with the Terminus of the proposed MRT-7, which will link Quezon City, Caloocan (north), and San Jose del Monte City, [[Bulacan]].

'''''‘Super City’''''' 

On September 4, 2007, [[Mayor]] Eduardo Roquero announced that a “super [[city]]” will rise (following the construction of the $1.2-billion Metro Rail Transit 7 (MRT) in the next 2  years) at the 200-hectare lot in Tungkong Mangga, [[San Jose del Monte City]], [[Bulacan]] where the first inter-modal [[terminal]] will be constructed (the last terminal of the 20.7-kilometer MRT-7 line from SM City North [[EDSA]] in [[Quezon City]], MRT-3 north). Light Rail Transit Corp. (Manila Metro Rail Transit System) will build it late 2008 and early 2009 and completed by 2010. The 40-kilometer  Circumferential Road 6 (C-6) will also start and branch out of the [[North Luzon Expressway]] between its [[Malolos]] and [[Marilao]] segments.  At least 20,000 workers will be employed.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=91011  Abs-Cbn Interactive, ‘Super City’ to rise in Bulacan]</ref>
