The [[castle]] of '''Bourtzi''' (Greek: '''Μπούρτζι''') is located in the middle of the harbour of [[Nafplio]]. The [[Venice|Venetians]] completed its fortification in [[1473]] to protect the city from pirates and invaders from the sea. The [[Greece|Greeks]] regained it from the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] on [[June 18]] [[1822]], from where they assisted in the siege of Nafplio. Until [[1865]] it served as a fortress. It was then transformed into residence of the executioners of convicts from the castle [[Palamidi]]. From [[1930]] to [[1970]] served as a hotel. Since then it is mainly a tourist attraction hosting occasionally parts of the Summer Music Festival.
