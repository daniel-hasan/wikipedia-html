The '''Cape Fear Shiner''', ''Notropis mekistocholas'', is a species of [[ray-finned fish]] in the [[Cyprinidae]] family. It is [[endemism|endemic]] to the central part of the state of [[North Carolina]] in the southeastern [[United States]] and is only found in the shallow streams of the [[Cape Fear River]] Basin. The fish is small and yellow with black lips and a black stripe which runs down the middle of the fish's side. This shiner is normally found in mixed schools with other minnow species. It is unique amongst its [[genus]] because it has elongated intestines that are specifically adapted to a primarily herbivorous diet. It can breed twice a year and normally lives for only two or three years in the wild. The males and females are normally similar in appearance but become different colors in the spawning season. This species of shiner was not discovered until 1962.

The shiner is [[critically endangered]] due to its small population size and threats to its [[habitat destruction|habitat]] from [[dam]] construction and pollution. It was first recognized as threatened in 1987. The species has since undergone a successful captive breeding program and its status has been a significant factor in the destruction of a dam that destroyed part of the shiner's habitat. However, the species is still limited to just five  populations in the wild and some experts believe that a single toxic chemical spill into the Cape Fear River could wipe out all of these.

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[Image:CFSRockyRiver1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rocky River (North Carolina)|Rocky River]] shiner habitat]]
The Cape Fear Shiner is [[endemism|endemic]] to the Upper Basin of the [[Cape Fear River]] in [[North Carolina]]’s Piedmont.<ref name="Rabon"/> Only five wild populations of this fish are known to exist. These populations are found in the freshwater [[Deep River (North Carolina)|Deep]], [[Haw River|Haw]], and [[Rocky River (North Carolina)|Rocky]] rivers in [[Chatham County, North Carolina|Chatham]], [[Harnett County, North Carolina|Harnett]], [[Lee County, North Carolina|Lee]], [[Moore County, North Carolina|Moore]], and [[Randolph County, North Carolina| Randolph]] counties. The largest of these populations is found where the Deep and Rocky Rivers meet.<ref name="Fact1"/> During the winter, shiners may migrate from their shoals in main river channels to smaller tributary streams.<ref name="Atlas"/>

This minnow typically lives in clean streams over gravel, cobble, and boulder substrates, especially where nearby [[Justicia americana|water willows]] and [[riverweed]] are available to provide protection from predators.<ref name="Rabon"/> The shiner rarely ventures into water deeper than 0.5 meters (1.6 ft).<ref name=" Malindzak ">{{cite paper| author = Edward George Malindzak| title = Behavior and habitat use of introduced flathead catfish in a North Carolina Piedmont river| date =2006-04-21| url = http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06042006-143746/unrestricted/etd.pdf| format =pdf| accessdate = 2007-12-12}}</ref> It has been observed in slow runs, riffles, and slow pools.

==Ecology and behavior==
The Cape Fear Shiner is often found swimming in mixed [[swarm|schools]] with other minnow species; however, it is never the most numerous minnow in a mixed school.<ref name="Rabon"/> It has been known to survive for six years in captivity but are only believed to survive for two or three years in the wild.<ref name="Fact1"/>

The Cape Fear Shiner's [[intestine]]s are adapted to help the fish digest plants and they were initially suggested to be primarily herbivorous because of this adaptation. However, recent studies have shown that the shiner eats a variety of both plant and animal matter.<ref name="Zoo"/> It is known to eat [[detritus]], [[bacteria]], [[phytoplankton]], [[diatom]]s, and [[algae]].<ref name="VT"/>

The shiner is threatened by numerous predators, such as [[crappie]], [[bass (fish)| bass]], and the introduced [[Flathead Catfish]].<ref name="Rabon"/> However, the adult Flathead Catfish does not pose a significant threat because of the differences in habitats of the two species within the river; the juvenile catfish, which share the same habitat as the shiner, may pose a larger threat.<ref name=" Malindzak "/>

This shiner [[Spawn (biology)|spawns]] around May 15 when the water temperature reaches 19 [[Celsius|°C]] (66.2 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]).<ref name="Atlas"/> A second spawning may occur in the late summer.<ref name="Fact1"/> Both male and female change color while spawning and the male develops a number of small [[tubercle]]s along its upper body.<ref name="Atlas"/> The shiner generally moves to slower-flowing pools to lay its [[egg (biology)|egg]]s in rocky substrates. Eggs hatch after three days, although the young generally live off of their [[egg yolk]] for another five days.<ref name="Fact2">{{cite web| title = Cape Fear Shiner (Notropis mekistocholas)| publisher = US Fish and Wildlife Service| date = May 2005| url =http://www.fws.gov/nc-es/fish/CFS_Fact_Sheet2.pdf| accessdate = 2007-12-09}}</ref> Juvenile shiners are often found in slow-moving water, particularly amongst large rocks in the middle of a stream or in flooded channels and pools. Juveniles sexually mature after their first year.<ref name="Rabon"/>

==Conservation==

The Cape Fear Shiner is only known from five different populations, two of which are extremely small and run a high risk of extinction. The other three populations are more stable and are estimated to number between 1500 and 3000 individual fish that are reproductively viable.<ref name="Rabon"/> 

The Cape Fear Shiner was recognized as "Endangered with Critical Habitat" on September 25, 1987 under the [[Endangered Species Act]] of 1973. Since 1987, the shiner has dwindled both in range and population.<ref name="Rabon"/> This fish is also protected from being captured and traded by the [[Lacey Act]].<ref name="VT"/> The shiner is not believed to have had historically large populations.<ref name="Zoo"/>

This minnow has been endangered by [[dam]] construction on the Cape Fear River, which has led to the flooding and destruction of the its shallow water habitat. The small number of geographically separated populations may also threaten the species’ genetic health, although a 2004 study concluded that genetic diversity was still relatively high.<ref>{{cite journal| last =Saillant| first = E| coauthors = Patton JC, Ross KE, Gold JR| title = Conservation genetics and demographic history of the endangered Cape Fear shiner (Notropis mekistocholas)| journal = Molecular Ecology| volume =13| issue =10| pages =2947-2958| date = Oct 2004| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=15367111&ordinalpos=2&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum| accessdate =2007-12-09  }}</ref> A deterioration of water quality due to [[pollution]] at some of the sites has also threatened the shiner.<ref name="Rabon"/> Experiments have shown that the shiner is highly sensitive to contaminating chemicals,<ref name="Hewitt"/> and experts believe that the wild population of this species can be wiped out by a single toxic chemical spill.<ref name="VT"/>

The [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] has been working to protect this species. Some of the conservation methods used to protect this species include studying its biology in the wild and donating $16,000 in 1998 to help maintain a captive population at the [[North Carolina Zoo]].<ref name="Zoo"/> Since the first successful captive breeding in 1997, this species has bred easily in captivity. An experiment was carried out in 2001 in which 900 captive-bred shiners were released temporarily into the wild to judge water quality at potential reintroduction sites.<ref name="Hewitt"/>

In the fall of 2005, work crews began removing the Carbonton Dam, which had destroyed part of the shiner's habitat. After the work that removed the dam finished in February 2006, the lake fell back to its historic creek levels, allowing the Cape Fear Shiner to expand its range back into the area that was previously unsuitable for inhabitation because of the dam.<ref name="Dam"> {{cite news | last = Graff| first = Frank | title =Cape Fear Shiner Returns To Area| publisher = NBC 17| date =2007-09-13| url =http://www.nbc17.com/midatlantic/ncn/search.apx.-content-articles-NCN-2007-09-13-0014.html| accessdate =2007-12-09  }}  </ref>
