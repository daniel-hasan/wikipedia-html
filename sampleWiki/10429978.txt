'''Freeport''' is a major railroad station along the [[Babylon Branch]] of the [[Long Island Rail Road]]. It is located in '''Freeport Plaza''' between Henry Street and Benson Place just north of [[New York State Route 27|NY 27]] in [[Freeport, New York]].

Freeport Station was originally built on [[October 28]], [[1867]], and is among many of the stations along the Babylon Branch that were elevated throughout Nassau and Western Suffolk Counties during the 1960s, in this case [[1961]]. The current Freeport Station replaced a structure that was built in in [[1899]], which itself replaced the original 1867 station built by the [[South Side Railroad of Long Island]].  Some afternoon rush-hour trains terminate at Freeport; and some morning rush-hour trains originate at Freeport.
