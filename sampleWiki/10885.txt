'''French fries''' ([[North America]]; sometimes also uncapitalized as "french fries"[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?sourceid=Mozilla-search&va=french+fries] or simply "fries"[http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/F0346800.html]), or '''chips''' ([[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], and most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations), are pieces of [[potato]] that have been [[Julienning|Julienned]] and [[deep-frying|deep-fried]].
    
In areas like Tokyo where "chips" is the common term, "French fries" usually refers to the thinner variant found in US-influenced [[fast food]] restaurants, or to the even thinner "shoestring potatoes". In North America "chips" generally means [[potato chips]] (called "crisps" in the UK and Ireland), which are deep-fried very thin slices of potato that are usually served at room temperature. In Australia "chips" refefers to any form of fried potato. A more recent hybrid of thicker cross-cut splicings, and generally eaten hot, is "waffle-cut potatoes" (not to be confused with [[potato waffle]]s made from [[Food processing|reconstituted]] potato).

==History==
French fried potatoes also known as "French Fries" were likely invented during the 18th century in the area that later became [[Belgium]]. The name "French" was applied to them in English at the beginning of the 19th century. 

===Culinary origin of the term===
The straightforward explanation of the term is that it means potatoes fried in the French sense of the verb "to fry" , which can mean either [[sautéing]] or [[Deep-frying|deep-fat frying]], while its [[French language|French]] origin, ''frire'', unambiguously means deep-frying&nbsp;: ''frites'' being its [[past participle]] used with a plural [[Grammatical gender|feminine substantive]], as in ''pommes de terre frites'' ("deep-fried potatoes").<ref name=ppc_hess1>

The verb "to french", though not attested until after "French fried potatoes" had appeared{{Fact|date=November 2007}}, can refer to "[[julienning]]" of vegetables as is acknowledged by some dictionaries<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?french "french :] (...) Usage: often capitalized – 1 : to trim the meat from the end of the bone of (as a chop) – 2 : to cut (green beans) in thin lengthwise strips before cooking" (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 10th ed.)</ref> while others only refer to trimming the meat off the [[shank]]s of chops.<ref>"to French: to prepare, as a chop, by partially cutting the meat from the shank and leaving bare the bone so as to fit it for convenient handling" (Oxford English Dictionary)</ref> In the UK "French-trimmed" lamb chops (particularly for serving as a 'rack of lamb') have the majority of the fat removed together with a small piece of fatty meat from between the ends of the chop bones, leaving mainly only the meat forming the "eye" of the chop attached.

===Belgium===
The [[Belgians]] claim that "French" fries are in fact Belgian, but definitive evidence for the origin has not been presented.  Belgian [[historian]] Jo Gerard recounts that potatoes were already fried in 1680 in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], in the area of "the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] valley between [[Dinant]] and [[Liège]], Belgium. The poor inhabitants of this region allegedly had the custom of accompanying their [[meal]]s with small fried [[fish]], but when the [[river]] was frozen and they were unable to fish, they cut potatoes lengthwise and fried them in [[cooking oil|oil]] to accompany their meals."<ref name=belgiangov1>

The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] concur with a [[Southern Netherlands|Southern Netherlandish]] or Belgian origin when referring to ''Vlaamse frieten'' ('[[Flanders|Flemish]] fries'). In 1857, the [[newspaper]] ''Courrier de Verviers'' devotes an article to Fritz (assumed pun with'' 'frites'''), a Belgian [[entrepreneur]] selling French fries at fairs, calling them "''le roi des pommes de terre frites''". In 1862, a stall selling French fried potatoes (see [[French_fries#Belgium_2|''frietkot'']]) called "''Max en Fritz''" was established near [[Het Steen]] in Antwerp.<ref name=ilegems1>

A Belgian legend claims that the term "French" was introduced when [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[North America|American]] soldiers arrived in Belgium during [[World War I]], and consequently tasted Belgian fries. They supposedly called them "French", as it was the official [[language]] of the [[Belgian Army]] at that time.<ref name=fritkotmax1/> But the term "French fried potatoes" had been in use in America long before the [[Great War]].

Whether or not Belgians invented them, "frites" "quickly became the national [[snack]] and a substantial part of both national dishes — making the Belgians their largest consumers,{{Fact|date=February 2007}} and to [[Europe]], their "symbolic" creators.

===France===
Many Americans attribute the dish to [[France]] — although in France they are often thought of as Belgian — and offer as evidence a notation by [[U.S. President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]]. ''"Pommes de terre frites à cru, en petites tranches"'' ("Potatoes deep-fried while raw, in small cuttings") are noted in a manuscript in Thomas Jefferson's hand (circa 1801-1809) and the [[recipe]] almost certainly comes from his French [[chef]], Honoré Julien.<ref name=ppc_hess1/> It is worth noting, though, that France had recently [[annexation|annexed]] what is now Belgium, and would retain control over it until the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 brought it under [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch reign]].<ref name=clc_ebeling1>

Recipes for fried potatoes (not clearly specified how) in French cookbooks date back at least to Menon's ''Les soupers de la cour'' (1755). It is true that eating potatoes was promoted in France by [[Antoine-Augustin Parmentier|Parmentier]], but he did not mention fried potatoes in particular. And the name of the dish in languages other than English does not refer to France; in French, they are simply called'' "pommes de terres frites" ''or, more commonly, simply'' "pommes frites" ''or'' 'frites'''.

===Spain===
Some claim that the dish was invented in [[Spain]], the first European country in which the potato appeared via the [[New World]] [[colony|colonies]], and assumes the first appearance to have been as an accompaniment to fish dishes in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]],{{Fact|date=February 2007}} from which it spread to the rest of the country and further to the [[Spanish Netherlands]]<!--do NOT replace link with its redirect destination: "Southern Netherlands" existed much longer-->, more than a century before Belgium was created there.

Professor Paul Ilegems, [[Museum curator|curator]] of the Friet-museum in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], believes that [[Saint Teresa of Ávila]] fried the first chips, referring also to the [[tradition]] of frying in [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean cuisine]].<ref name=demorgen_schoetens1>

===United Kingdom===
The first chip fried in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was apparently on the site of [[Oldham]]'s Tommyfield Market in 1860. In [[Scotland]], chips were first sold in [[Dundee]], "...in the 1870s, that glory of British [[gastronomy]] – the chip – was first sold by Belgian [[immigrant]] Edward De Gernier in the city’s [[Greenmarket]]."<ref name=dundee1>

[[Image:Frenchfriesmainnpret.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Oven baked fries / chips]]
Although the thicker cut English style of chip was already a popular dish in most Commonwealth countries, the thin style of french fries has been popularized worldwide in part by [[United States]]-based [[fast food|fast-food]] chains like [[McDonald's]] and [[Burger King]]. This came about through the introduction of the frozen French fry invented by the [[J.R. Simplot Company]] in the early 1950s. Before the [[handshake]] deal between [[Ray Kroc]] of McDonald's and Jack Simplot of the J.R. Simplot Company, potatoes were hand-cut and peeled in the [[restaurant]]s, but Simplot's frozen product reduced preparation time and aided the expansion of the McDonald's franchise. One of the few fast-food chains that still [[In-N-Out Burger menu items#French fries|prepares fresh potatoes on the premises]] is [[In-N-Out Burger]].

On [[September 22]], 2007, [[Benguet]] [[State University]] (BSU) announce that 4 [[potato]] varieties -- Igorota, Solibao, [[Ganza]] and a 4th one yet to be given an official [[tag]] -- possess more than 18% [[dry matter]] [[content]] required by [[fast-food]] chains to make [[crispy]] and sturdy French fries.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view_article.php?article_id=90044 Inquirer.net, RP's new potato varieties good for French fries]</ref>

===Recent developments===
Frozen French fries most often have been pre-fried — it is not unheard of for these to be [[bake]]d instead of fried — and are widely available in [[supermarket]]s.

By the start of the 21st century, frozen fries for home-cooking had become available, battered and breaded, and many U.S. fast-food and casual food chains had turned to dusting with kashi. [[dextrin]] and flavors coating for crispier fries with particular tastes. The [[food service]] sector is challenged to create time-saving "fries" that consumers find acceptable. Results with new batterings and breadings, followed by [[microwave oven|microwaving]], remain sub-standard, though [[oven]] frying may deliver reasonable fries, be it different from the traditionally fried item.<ref name=virgopub_gerdes1>

==Food associations==
[[Image:DefragsDinner.jpg|thumb|250px|Thin Potato chips accompanying a meal]]

Besides being a popular snack in themselves, French fried potatoes as a [[side dish]] to specific [[food]] or an integral part of a named dish often typify a country:
*In Belgium, [[steam]]ed [[mussels]]: ''mosselen-friet'' or ''moules-frites''. After missing the popular dish for a few months, in summer, the Belgians rush to restaurants and fishmongers when the mussels arrive, typically from [[Zeeland]]. Another national dish is their ''biefstuk-friet'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or ''bifteck-frites'' in [[French language|French]], which may disregard these terms' [[English language]] origin as [[beefsteak]] and — for aficionados — be horse steak; the steak fries are plainly seasoned or served with one of the sauces the Belgians are praised for, and usually a simple [[salad]], in restaurants or at home. A time and cost efficient traditional puts a ''deep'' fried egg on top of a plate of chips.
*In France, grilled [[steak]]: ''steak-frites''.
*In Spain, [[fried eggs]]: ''huevos con patatas''.
*In the United Kingdom, [[fried fish]]: ''[[fish and chips]]'' and fried eggs: "double egg and chips".
*In the United States, [[hamburger]]s.
*In [[Germany]], curried [[sausage]]: ''[[Currywurst]]''.
*In [[Norway]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]], [[kebab]], hamburgers and sausages.

==Variants==
[[Image:Flickr nattokun 285273165--In-N-Out Cutting Fries.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cutting fries at an [[In-N-Out Burger]]]]
French fries have numerous variants, from "thick-cut" to "shoestring", "joe joes", "crinkle", "curly" and many other names. They can also be coated with [[breading]] and [[spices]], which include [[garlic powder]], [[onion powder]], [[black pepper]], [[paprika]] and salt to create "seasoned fries", or cut thickly with the skin left on to create [[potato wedges]], or without the skin to create "steak fries", essentially the American equivalent of the British "chip". Sometimes, French fries are cooked in the oven as a final step in the preparation (having been coated with oil during preparation at the [[factory]]): these are often sold frozen and are called "oven fries" or "oven chips".

In France, the thick-cut fries are called'' 'pommes Pont-Neuf'<ref>Evelyn Saint-Ange, Paul Aratow (translator), ''La Bonne Cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange: The Essential Companion for Authentic French Cooking'', Larousse, 1927, translation Ten Speed Press, 2005, ISBN 1-580-08605-5, p. 553.</ref> ''or simply'' 'pommes frites''', about 10&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]]; thinner variants are'' 'pommes allumettes' ''(matchstick potatoes), ±7&nbsp;mm, and'' 'pommes pailles' ''(potato straws), 3-4&nbsp;mm (roughly ⅜, ¼ and ⅛&nbsp;[[inch]] respectively). The two-bath technique is standard (Bocuse).'' 'Pommes gaufrettes' ''or  "waffle-cut potatoes" are not typical French fried potatoes, but actually [[crisps]] obtained by quarter turning the potato before each next slide over a [[grater]] and deep-frying just once.<ref>

In the [[British Isles]], [[Australia]] and elsewhere, the term "French fries" is only used by fast-food restaurants serving narrow-cut (shoestring) fries. Traditional "chips" in the [[United Kingdom]] are usually cut much thicker, typically between ⅜ and ½ [[inch]]es (9.5-13&nbsp;mm) square in cross-section and cooked twice, making them less crunchy on the outside and [[softness|fluffier]] on the inside. Since the surface-to-volume [[ratio]] is lower, they have a lower fat content. Chips are part of the popular British take-away dish [[fish and chips]]. In Australia, the UK, Ireland, and [[New Zealand]], few towns are without a chip shop ([[colloquial]]ly, a ''chippie/chippy'').

Belgian fries are about 10-13&nbsp;mm thick and must be fried twice, usually in horse fat, according to American culinary celebrity [[Alton Brown]]. This was used shortly after World War II but also quickly abandoned in favor of the traditional [[ox]] or beef fat. For economical reasons [[vegetable oil]] became common and is now usually preferred for a relative cholesterol benefit.

==Cooking==

[[Image:Friescookingbigrest.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Fries prepared at a restaurant with thermostat temperature control. (The lack of bubbles in oil indicates an oil temperature of less than 120 °C)]]

Some home cooks who prepare French fries from scratch cook them a single time in a generous amount of oil pre-heated to a temperature around 375&nbsp;°F (190&nbsp;°C, medium to high heat power dial settings depending on the amount of fries to available fryer heat power) until they are golden and slightly crisp. The method recommended by most cookbooks, and used by many restaurants, especially those reputed to have excellent French fries, cook them in two stages: first at a thermostat temperature at around 350&nbsp;°F (177&nbsp;°C), until the fries are nearly cooked but limp, still pale and not too dried; then, after they have been removed from the oil and allowed to cool, at a higher temperature, generally around 375&nbsp;°F (190&nbsp;°C), fries are fried again until they are golden and crisp, which normally takes less than a minute. A third method, attributed to the celebrated French chef [[Joël Robuchon]] for the home cook, is to put the sliced potatoes into a saucepan with just enough cold oil in it to cover the potatoes, then cook them over high heat until golden, stirring occasionally.<ref name=steingarten1>

<!-- this is the standard two-bath method; it may seem very wordy but it is the essence of the article topic -->
The Belgian way of cooking'' 'frites' ''is generally in two stages.
:First the peeled and lengthwise crisscross cut potatoes are 'pre-fried' ('voorgebakken' in Dutch) for about 7 to 12 minutes in oil or – traditionally – beef dripping preheated to about 130 to 160 °C (medium-low heat power dial settings depending on the amount of fries to oil), to cook the inner part without burning the outside, while some of the moisture is driven out and where the fragrance starts to develop. When the fries are added to the oil, the oil at first cools quickly and is quickly kept at secret values (98 °C to 122 °C) to prevent the potatoes from burning. The fries stay a pale beige to yellow color and not too dry when finished at this stage. The fries would not be burned with brown patches at this stage. Then they are taken out, tossed to avoid clumping, and generally allowed to cool down and dry. This intermediate product can be either frozen for 'instant' deep-frying later, or as several batches of 'pre-fried' fries prepared (e.g., when fries stands are opened for the day, or at home ahead of a company of guests) for rapid frying and almost simultaneously serving later.
:The second stage where the cooked flavor is achieved involves frying for about two to five minutes in oil or beef fat preheated to 175 to 195 °C (as high as the oil or fat can safely stand, but without burning the fries before this time period: a too high temperature breaks it down to rather poisonous compounds) depending on the initial temperature of the fries. The (cool) batches must be small enough relative to the quantity of oil or fat for its preheated temperature to stay sufficiently high (125 °C to 160 °C) already during the first half minute of the frying process. Generally the cook is guided more by the color of the product than by timing; and by experience with the particular variety of potato. As a rule-of-the-thumb, one might wait until the fries start to float near the surface. The oil temperature must reach specific values (115 °C to 125 °C) for a specific amount of time after the fries has been precooked. The cooking task is to get sufficient cooking time (10 to 16 minutes) without allowing the fries to become too greasy. Once more the fries are sturdily tossed and preferably also kind of centrifuged (vigorously swerving the batch around in a wide recipient, in the shape of the base of a cone upside down, held in front of the cook's belly – common for professional batch frying), and shortly tossed again – thus removing excessive fattiness and preventing loss of the outer crispness.
:Ideally, the fries have a golden to golden-brown appearance and a bite through the crispy outside reveals a soft inside. For a given depth of the crispy crust, the balance with the soft cooked potato inside is determined by the thickness; no less than 13 [[Millimetre|mm]] traditionally to 10&nbsp;mm towards the end of the 20th century, before frying, are typical for Belgium. Some restaurants may cut as thin as 5&nbsp;mm. In a good professional ''friterie'' stand, the cut is done in a single action by driving the whole peeled potato standing vertically, through a horizontal ''raster'' of crosswise sharp blades. This easily removable (for cleaning) and exchangeable set of blades defines the thickness of the ''frites''.

Typically for U.S. fast-food restaurants, is a preparation prior to cooking:
:In an interview, Burger King president Donald Smith said that his chain's fries are sprayed with a sugar solution shortly before being packaged and shipped to individual outlets. The sugar carmelizes in the cooking fat, producing the golden color customers expect. Without it, the fries would be nearly the same color outside as inside: pasty yellow. Smith believes that McDonald's also sugar-coats its fries. McDonalds was assumed to fry their fries for a total time of about 16 to 20 minutes, and with fries fried at least twice. The secret oil temperature(s) was assumed to be such that the color of the fries would still be a pale beige before the final frying. The final frying time seems to be less than a few minutes at higher oil temperatures. The fries appear to contain beef lard, or shortening. <ref name=poundstone1>

===Australia===
Chips are usually eaten with tomato sauce ([[ketchup]]) and most shops offer a choice of plain or [[chicken salt]] (seasoned salt). Many shops also offer [[gravy]].  Potato wedges are also popular which consist of a quartered, often with the skin left on, seasoned fried potato. Potato wedges are commonly eaten with [[sweet chilli sauce]] and [[sour cream]], but also with tomato sauce.

===Belgium===

Even the smallest Belgian town has a ''frietkot'' (literally 'fries shack').<ref>Whether [[Herstappe]]'s eighty-odd inhabitants have a 'frietkot'? Belgium's ''smallest'' municipality [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]] has at least one.

Traditionally, take-away chips were picked by the fingers out of a tip bag wrapped from a square paper, while walking on the streets. By the 1970s and 80s with several meat accompaniments gaining popularity, more practical open carton boxes became standard and tiny plastic forks available. One can order a small or large portion, often three or four sizes are priced.<br/>''Fries with [[mayonnaise]]'' is a fastfood classic in Belgium, often eaten without any side orders. The limited choice around 1960 between a [[pickled herring]], a cold large meatball ''boulet'' or red coloured garlic sausage ''cervela'' (both often served deep-fried later on), or a beef or (now rarely) horsemeat stew, became expanded by ''stoofvlees'' or ''stoofkarbonade'' and a wide variety of deep-fried meats as chicken legs, beef or pork sticks, minced beef and/or pork and/or chicken and/or turkey in all shapes (balls, sticks, sausages) mixed with a dosage of fat and condiments to one's preference, usually factory made. An example of an additional on-the-spot preparation is sometimes in Flanders called ''mammoet speciaal'' (mammoth special), a large ''[[frikandel]]'' (''curryworst'' in the Antwerp and Flemish Brabant) deep-fried and cut so as to put chopped onion in the V-shaped length and dressed with [[mayonnaise]] (as real as factory made can be, not ''frietsaus'') and (curry-)ketchup. The earlier of now many available sauces, are mayonnaise, and one called ''pickles'' which is actually piccalilly.<ref name=dupuis_franquin1>

===Bulgaria===
In [[Bulgaria]], a serving of fries can be ordered with a covering of [[sirene]], a grated white brine cheese.

===Canada===
[[Image:Flickr dongkwan 124242873--Poutine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Poutine]] is a mixture of fries, cheese curd and hot chicken sauce.]]
Throughout [[Canada]], white vinegar is a popular condiment for French fries. No other country is known to so enjoy white vinegar (as opposed to malt or other vinegars) on its fries. Most major Canadian fast-food outlets provide white vinegar packets next to their ketchup packets in their stores, and many restaurants keep white vinegar on their tables. That is not to say that the use of malt vinegar is not common – particularly amongst those of English heritage. In most traditional 'fish & chips' shops in Canada, malt vinegar is more prevalent. However, ketchup remains the most popular condiment used on French fries in Canada.

In Canada, French fries are the main component of a dish called'' '[[poutine]]''': a mixture of French fries with fresh [[cheese curd]]s, covered with a hot [[gravy]], optionally with browned ground beef and/or a vegetable such as green peas mixed in. This dish is most popular in [[Quebec]] fast food chains such as [[La Belle Province (restaurant)|La Belle Province]], and [[Lafleur Restaurants]]; however, its popularity has begun to spread in Quebec, and then across Canada, and is also carried in national chains such as [[Harvey's]][http://www.harveys.ca/eng/nutritional_info/Harveys_NAG_V2.pdf] and [[New York Fries]][http://www.southstburger.com/pdf/SOUTH_ST-launch_release4.pdf], as well as Canadian outlets of international franchises such as [[A&W]][http://www.aw.ca/foodfacts.nsf/listbyref_new/Sides-6] and [[Burger King]][http://www.burgerking.ca/en/1158/index.php]. (A similar variant, '[[disco fries]]' is found in several [[New England]] cities.) In [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], "chips, dressing and gravy" (sometimes referred to by outsiders as "[[Newfie]] fries") comprise French fries topped with "dressing" (turkey [[stuffing]] made with [[summer savoury]]) and gravy.

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]] the traditional accompaniment to French fries is [[remoulade]] sauce.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], accompaniments are usually limited to ketchup and mayonnaise.  The two are often combined, which is commonly called ''Pommes rot-weiß'' ("fries red and white"). Although mustard may also be available at the same fast food stand to serve with [[Bratwurst]], it is used to accompany French Fries less commonly.  Curry sauce is sometimes used as a condiment.  During [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s term, some Germans jokingly referred to a combination of salted French fries ("Pommes", or "Fritten") with ketchup and a large [[Currywurst]] as ''[[Kanzlerplatte]]'' ([[Chancellor]]'s Dish) because Schröder was said to prefer this kind of fast food. Other "nicknames" are "[[Bottroper Platte]]" ([[Bottrop plate]]), referring to the city of [[Bottrop]] in the [[Ruhr]] area or "[[Pommes Schranke]]" (Fries "barrier"), referring to the common red and white markings on barriers.

===Netherlands===
[[Image:IMGP4604.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Dutch fries with tartar sauce, served in a cone.]]
In the [[Netherlands]], vending points are often very similar to the ones in [[Belgium]] but called ''snackbars''. Though each country has a few typical accompaniments, many are alike but usually known by different and confusing names in an otherwise for the Netherlands and [[Flanders]] common language. [[Peanut]] sauce is also popular (also called [[satay]] sauce, after the Malayan meat ''sate'' on which the same sauce is used). The Dutch also use the word [[mayonnaise]] to refer to ''frietsaus'' (fries-sauce) a thicker, less acidic sauce made specially to accompany French fries (as made famous in the film ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''). Another interesting combination is ''Patatje Oorlog'' (Dutch for: ''French Fries War''), which is French fries with a variety of sauces, a variety that differs from region to region, and even from one snackbar to another. While it sometimes means mayonnaise (or rather, ''frietsaus''), peanut sauce and chopped raw onions, in other places it means the fries are accompanied with all condiments available. Dutch snackbars typically offer at least 8 condiments or combinations of them (the condiments are never free in the Netherlands), but some serve up to 40 different styles. The Dutch eat their fries mostly with the famous Dutch snacks such as the [[kroket]] and [[frikandel]]. A well made fries recipe would give the fries a fried fish and pastry like fragrance. The texture of this fries indicates that it may have first been blanched before frying.



===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], they are often served with a sprinkling of powdered flavors, primarily [[cheese]], [[sour cream]] or [[barbecue]]. In some fast food chains, these are topped with cheese sauce and minced [[bacon]].

===United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland===
[[Image:Flickr adactio 164930387--Fish and chips.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fish & chips.]]

In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland]], traditionally chips are usually accompanied by [[salt]] and [[malt vinegar]], and in some areas onion vinegar. The fondness for vinegar on chips has led to some outlets using spray misters, such as used for misting plants or spraying cleaning products, for the even distribution of vinegar to chips; this ensures an even coating of vinegar, meaning there are no "pools" where vinegar and salt form a small clump. In [[England]] and [[Wales]], [[gravy]] and [[curry]] sauce are available from some [[chip shop]]s. In [[Northern England]], [[Scotland]] and [[South Wales]], 'chips, cheese and gravy' is a popular dish, while in the South 'cheesy chips' (chips with grated [[cheddar]] thickly sprinkled on) are popular. In Britain and Ireland, the term ''french fries'' refers exclusively to the long thin version served in fast food establishments. The most common accompaniment for chips in England is [[tomato ketchup]]; other sauces used include barbecue sauce, burger sauce, mayonnaise, [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]] and [[HP Sauce|brown sauce]] or a combination thereof. When chips are served with other fried foods such as fish or battered sausage, [[mushy peas]] or [[baked beans]] are a popular addition. In the Midlands and some Northern regions of England a takeaway of chips with either mushy peas or baked beans is called a "pea mix" or "bean mix" respectively.

In [[Scotland]] salt and vinegar tends to be served in most places, with salt and sauce (a mixture of brown sauce and vinegar) a local specialty served in [[Edinburgh]] and parts of [[Fife]]. Often the 'vinegar' is actually [[non-brewed condiment]], a solution of [[acetic acid]] coloured with caramel. Fish and chips in parts of Scotland is more commonly called "a fish supper".

In [[Ireland]], chips are served with salt and vinegar, with gravy, mayonnaise, [[pepper sauce]], curry sauce and mushy peas being common accompaniments. [[Fish and chips]] or [[kebab]] are common. Chips are also commonly served with any combination of [[coleslaw]], curry sauce, garlic sauce and  [[grated cheese]] which is known as a "garlic and cheese chip". "Burger sauce" is also very a popular accompaniment.

===United States===
In the United States, by far the most popular condiment for fries is [[ketchup]], so much so that consumption of restaurant fries drives ketchup sales.<ref>[http://www.ers.usda.gov/AmberWaves/September03/Findings/VegetableConsumption.htm Vegetable Consumption Away from Home on the Rise]</ref> Occasionally [[mustard]] is used, and [[malt vinegar]] mainly available at restaurants which serve fish and chips. Fries are sometimes coated with melted cheese, called ''cheese fries''. This can be in combination with [[chili con carne|chili]], making chili cheese fries.
*Variations of cheese fries include fries covered with [[Cheez Whiz]], [[mozzarella]], [[Swiss cheese]], or [[garlic]] and cheese fries (cheese with garlic mayonnaise).
*[[Disco fries]] – (with brown gravy and mozzarella) are a staple of [[New Jersey]] [[diner]]s.
*The American fast-food restaurant [[Checkers Drive-In|Checkers]]/[[Rally's]] serve "fully loaded fries": seasoned fries covered in melted American cheese, ranch dressing and bacon bits. 
*[[Mid-Atlantic States]] often put [[Old Bay Seasoning]] on fries. These are sometimes referred to as "beach fries".<ref name=sunsetgrille1>

*In [[Rhode Island]], both vinegar and ketchup are standards on the table in local restaurants.
*In [[Utah]] and surrounding areas, French fries are often served with [[fry sauce]], a mixture of spices, mayonnaise, and ketchup.
*In some parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]], french fries are covered with cheese, [[carne asada]], [[sour cream]], and [[guacamole]]. These are called [[carne asada fries]] and are served almost exclusively in [[Mexican food|taco shops]].
*In the [[South Central United States|Midsouth]], fries are often served with white, or [[gravy#Types of gravy|country gravy]].
* In Northern Virginia, eating french fries dipped in [[chocolate]] has recently become popular and are called "choco-fries".

''Steak fries'' are thicker-cut fries, often with the skins intact.  They are often coated with spices or [[marinade]]d before cooking.  They may be fried or baked in the oven.<ref>[http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_22048,00.html Oven Steak Fries]</ref>

===Vietnam===
In [[Vietnam]], restaurants are usually found serving fries with sugar over a dollop of soft butter.

==Health aspects==

French fries can contain a large amount of [[fat]] (usually [[saturated fat|saturated]]) or [[oils]] from frying. Some researchers have suggested that the high temperatures used for frying such dishes may have results harmful to health (see [[acrylamide]]s). In the United States about ¼ of [[vegetable]]s consumed are prepared as French fries and are proposed to contribute to widespread [[obesity]]. <!--Page 4,5, ''Food Fight'', ISBN 0071402500--> Frying French fries in [[beef tallow]], recently discarded from the [[McDonald's]] recipe, adds saturated fat to the diet. Replacing tallow with tropical oils such as [[palm oil]] simply substitutes one saturated fat for another. Replacing tallow with partially hydrogenated oil reduces [[cholesterol]] but adds [[trans fat]], which has been shown to both raise [[LDL cholesterol]] and lower HDL cholesterol.<ref name=harvardsph1>

==Legal issues==
In 1994, the well-known owner of Stringfellows nightclub in [[London]], [[Peter Stringfellow]], took exception to [[McCain Foods Limited|McCain Foods]]' use of the name "Stringfellows" for a brand of long thin French fries and took them to court. He lost the case (''Stringfellows v McCain Food (GB) Ltd (1994)'') on the basis that there was no connection in the public mind between the two uses of the name, and therefore McCain's product would not have caused the nightclub to lose any sales.<ref>

In June 2004, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], with the advisement of a federal district judge from [[Beaumont, Texas]], classified batter-coated French fries as a [[vegetable]] under the [[Agricultural Marketing Service|Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act]]. Although this move was mostly for trade reasons (French fries do not meet the standard to be listed as a "[[processed food]]"), this received significant media attention partially due to the documentary ''[[Super Size Me]]''.
