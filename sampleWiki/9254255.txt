'''Hurricane Isabel''' was the costliest and deadliest [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane]] in the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The ninth tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Isabel formed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[September 6]] in the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165&nbsp;mph (265&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 11]]. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 18]]. It quickly weakened over land and became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] over western [[Pennsylvania]] the next day.

In [[North Carolina]], the storm surge from Isabel washed out a portion of [[Hatteras Island]] to form what was unofficially known as [[Isabel Inlet]]. Damage was greatest along the [[Outer Banks]], where thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed. The worst of the effects of Isabel occurred in [[Virginia]], which reported the most deaths and damage from the hurricane. About 64% of the damage and 68% of the deaths occurred in the two states alone.

Moderate to severe damage extended up the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coastline]] and as far inland as [[West Virginia]]. Roughly 6 million were left without power in the eastern United States from the strong winds of Isabel. Rainfall from the storm extended from [[South Carolina]] to [[Maine]], and westward to [[Michigan]]. Throughout the path of Isabel, damage totaled about $3.6&nbsp;billion (2003&nbsp;USD, $3.95&nbsp;billion 2006&nbsp;USD). 16&nbsp;deaths in seven states were directly related to the hurricane, with 35&nbsp;deaths in six states and one province indirectly related to the hurricane.

It weakened after it made landfall, though due to its fast forward motion Isabel remained a hurricane until reaching western [[Virginia]] early on [[September 19]]. After passing through [[West Virginia]] as a tropical storm, Isabel became [[extratropical]] over western [[Pennsylvania]]. Later that day, it crossed [[Lake Erie]] into [[Canada]], and was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over the [[Cochrane District, Ontario|Cochrane District]] of [[Ontario]].<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
[[Image:Hurricane Isabel from ISS.jpg|thumb|left|Hurricane Isabel as seen from the [[International Space Station]]]]
50 hours prior to Isabel making landfall, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] from [[Little River, South Carolina]] to [[Chincoteague, Virginia]], including the [[Pamlico Sound|Pamlico]] and [[Albemarle Sound]]s and the lower [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The NHC also issued a tropical storm watch south of Little River, South Carolina to the mouth of the [[Santee River]], as well as from Chincoteague, Virginia northward to [[Little Egg Harbor|Little Egg Inlet]], [[New Jersey]]. Hurricane and tropical storm warnings were gradually issued for portions of the [[East Coast of the United States]]. By the time Isabel made landfall, a tropical storm warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to [[Fire Island, New York]] and from [[Cape Fear]], [[North Carolina]] to the mouth of the Santee River in South Carolina, and a hurricane warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Cape Fear. Landfall forecasts were very accurate; from three days prior, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36&nbsp;miles (58&nbsp;km), and for 48&nbsp;hours in advance the average track error was 18&nbsp;miles (29&nbsp;km).<ref name="tcr"/>

Officials declared mandatory evacuations for 24&nbsp;counties in [[North Carolina]], [[Virginia]], and [[Maryland]], though in general not many left. According to a survey conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, evacuation rates were estimated as follows; 45% in the [[Outer Banks]], 23% in the area around the [[Pamlico Sound]], 23% in [[Virginia]] under mandatory orders, and about 15% in [[Maryland]].<ref name="assess">{{cite web|author=Post, Buckley, Schuh and Jernigan|year=2005|title=Hurricane Isabel Assessment, a Review of Hurricane Evacuation Study Products and Other Aspects of the National Hurricane Mitigation and Preparedness Program (NHMPP) in the Context of the Hurricane Isabel Response|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2006-11-27|url=http://www.csc.noaa.gov/hes/docs/postStorm/Isabel_PostStorm_Summary.pdf}}</ref> The threat of Isabel resulted in the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents, primarily in North Carolina and Virginia, and included more than 12,000&nbsp;residents staying in emergency shelters.<ref name="scotsman">{{cite web|author=Scotsman.com|year=2003|title=America feels the wrath of Isabel|accessdate=2007-02-11|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=980&id=1037902003}}</ref>

19 major airports along the [[East Coast of the United States]] were closed, with more than 1,500&nbsp;flights canceled. The [[Washington Metro]] and Washington bus system closed prior to the arrival of the storm, and [[Amtrak]] canceled nearly all trains south of the nation's capital. Schools and businesses throughout its path closed prior to Isabel's arrival to allow time to prepare; hardware and home improvement stores reported brisk business of plywood, flashlights, batteries, and portable generators, as residents prepared for the storm's potential impact. The federal government was closed excluding emergency staff members.<ref name="scotsman"/> The [[United States Navy]] ordered the removal of 40&nbsp;ships and submarines and dozens of aircraft from naval sites near [[Norfolk, Virginia]].<ref name="cnnn">{{cite web|author=CNN.com|year=2003|title=Storm could cause 'extensive damage'|accessdate=2007-02-11|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WEATHER/09/15/hurricane.isabel/index.html}}</ref>

Strong winds from Isabel extended from [[North Carolina]] to [[New England]] and westward to [[West Virginia]]. The winds, combined with previous rainfall which moistened the soil, downed many trees and power lines across its path, leaving about 6 million electricity customers without power at some point. Coastal areas suffered from waves and its powerful storm surge, with areas in eastern North Carolina and southeast [[Virginia]] reporting severe damage from both winds and the storm surge. Throughout its path, Isabel resulted in $3.6&nbsp;billion in damage (2003 USD, $3.95&nbsp;billion 2006&nbsp;USD) and 47&nbsp;deaths, of which 16 were directly related to the storm's effects.<ref name="assess">{{cite web|author=United States Department of Commerce|year=2004|title=Service Assessment of Hurricane Isabel|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2007-02-10|url=http://www.weather.gov/os/assessments/pdfs/isabel.pdf}}</ref>

Powerful surf affected the northern coastlines of the islands in the [[Greater Antilles]]. Strong swells also impacted the [[Bahamas]]. During most hurricanes, the location of the Bahamas prevents powerful swells of Atlantic hurricanes from striking southeast [[Florida]]. However, the combination of the location, forward speed, and strength of Isabel produced strong swells through the [[Tongue of the Ocean|Providence Channel]] onto a narrow 10&nbsp;mile (16&nbsp;km) stretch of the southeastern Florida coastline; wave heights peaked at 14&nbsp;feet (4.3&nbsp;m) at [[Delray Beach, Florida|Delray Beach]].<ref name="iswav"/> The swells capsized a watercraft and injured its 2&nbsp;passengers at [[Boynton Beach, Florida|Boynton Beach]], and a swimmer required assistance to be rescued near [[Juno Beach, Florida|Juno Beach]].

{{main|Effects of Hurricane Isabel in West Virginia}}
In [[West Virginia]], 50 to 60&nbsp;mph (50 to 60&nbsp;km/h) wind gusts downed hundreds to thousands of trees across the state; previously heavy rainfall moistened the soil which allowed the winds to uproot the trees more easily. The falling trees severely damaged dozens of houses and left over 1.4&nbsp;million without power. Rainfall from the storm caused flooding along the rivers in the eastern portion of the state. Damage totaled $20&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $22&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD).<ref name="tcr"/><ref name="wvncdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for Hurricane Isabel|accessdate=2007-02-07|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~527587}}</ref>

The disaster declaration allocated the use of federal funds for rebuilding and providing aid in the aftermath of hurricane Isabel.<ref name="assess"/> By about four months after the passage of the hurricane, disaster aid totaled about $516&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $576.3&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD), primarily in North Carolina and Virginia. Over 166,000 residents applied for individual assistance, with about $117&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $130&nbsp;million) approved for residents to assist with temporary housing and home repairs. About 50,000&nbsp;business owners applied for Small Business Administration loans, with about $178&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $199&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD) approved for the assistance loans.
