'''The House of Gediminas''' refers to the siblings, children, and grandchildren of [[Gediminas]], [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] (ca. 1275–1341). The [[Gediminids|Gediminid]] dynasty ruled the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] from ca. 1285 or 1316 to 1572, eventually extending its territories from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]]. 

Gediminas' origins are unclear, but recent research suggests that [[Skalmantas (Gediminids)|Skalmantas]], an otherwise unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' father or at least father-in-law, and could be considered the dynasty's founder.<ref name=tomas/> Because none of his brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]],  and [[Poland]].<ref name=r91>{{cite book | title=Lithuania Ascending: A Pagan Empire Within East-Central Europe, 1295–1345 | first=S. C. | last=Rowell | pages=89–93 | year=1994 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought: Fourth Series| isbn=9780521450119 }}</ref> 

The relationships between Gediminas' children were generally harmonious, with the notable exception of [[Jaunutis]], who was deposed in 1345 by his brothers [[Algirdas]] and [[Kęstutis]]. These two brothers went on to provide a celebrated example of peaceful power-sharing. However, Gediminas' many grandchildren and their descendants engaged in power struggles that continued well into the 15th century.<ref name=r69/> Gediminas' grandchildren [[Christianization of Lithuania|converted Lithuania to Christianity]] and inaugurated the first [[Union of Krewo|personal union with Poland]]. The dynasty came to an end in 1572, when [[Sigismund II Augustus]] died without producing a male heir.

==Origins==
[[Image:Vytenis.jpg|thumb|Vytenis, Grand Duke of Lithuania about 1295–1315.]]

Because written sources of the era are scarce, Gediminas' ancestry, early life, and assumption of the title of Grand Duke in 1316 are obscure and continue to be the subject of scholarly debate. Various theories have claimed that Gediminas was either Grand Duke [[Vytenis]]' son, his brother, his cousin, or his [[hostler]]. For several centuries, only two versions of his origins circulated. Chronicles written long after Gediminas' death by the [[Teutonic Knights]], a long-standing enemy of Lithuania, claimed that Gediminas was a hostler to Vytenis;<ref name=tomas/> according to these chronicles, Gediminas killed his master and assumed the throne. Another version introduced in the [[Lithuanian Chronicles]], which also appeared long after Gediminas' death, proclaimed that Gediminas was Vytenis' son.<ref name=tomas/> However, the two men were almost the same age, making this relationship unlikely. In 1868, a letter issued by the Council of [[Riga]] in 1323 was published; it contained a small note mentioning Vytenis as "the brother and predecessor" of Gediminas.<ref name=tomas/> After the letter came to light, textbooks almost universally represented Vytenis and Gediminas as brothers. However, historian [[Tomas Baranauskas]] believes that the word "brother" has been interpreted too literally, and that the two were in fact cousins.<ref name=tomas>{{lt icon}} {{cite journal| url=http://viduramziu.lietuvos.net/gediminas.htm | title=Gedimino kilmė | first=Tomas | last=Baranauskas | journal=[[Voruta (newspaper)|Voruta]] | date=1996-11-23 | volume=44 | issue=278 | page=6 | accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>

Grand Duke Vytenis' origins are relatively well-established; he was the son of [[Butvydas]], who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. However, no consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give [[Traidenis]] as the ancestor,<ref>{{ru icon}} {{cite book| title=Families of the Nobility of the Russian Empire. Second Volume. Princes | publisher=Vesti |location=St. Petersburg |date=1995 |isbn=5-86153-012-2 |page=26}}</ref> this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson would have violated [[canon law]], since the two would have been related, and this violation would have been noticed by the pope.<ref name=empire/> 

Recent research indicates that Gediminids' ancestor may have been [[Skalmantas (Gediminids)|Skalmantas]]. In 1974 the historian [[Jerzy Ochmański]] noted that ''[[Zadonshchina]]'', a poem from the end of the 14th century, contains a line in which two sons of [[Algirdas]] name their ancestors: "We are two brothers – sons of Algirdas, and grandsons of Gediminas, and great-grandsons of Skalmantas."<ref name=tomas/> This discovery led to the belief that Skalmantas was the long-sought ancestor of the Gediminids.<ref>{{cite book| first=Rimantas |last=Jokimaitis |coauthors=Algis Kasperavičius, Eugenijus Manelis, Beatričė Stukienė | title=World and Lithuanian History.

C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 52–55</ref> Ochmański posited that the poem skipped the generation represented by Butvydas, and jumped back to the unknown ancestor. Baranauskas does not agree that the poem skipped a generation and believes that Skalmantas was Butvydas' brother, rather than his father - making Vytenis and Gediminas cousins.<ref name=tomas/>

It is known that Gediminas, born about 1275, had one (or possibly two, see below for the wife of Andrei of Kozelsk) sister and several brothers – [[Vainius]], [[Fiodor of Kiev]], possibly [[Vytenis]], and possibly [[Margiris]]. If Vytenis, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from about 1295 to 1315, was indeed Gediminas' brother, he was probably the eldest son.<ref name=nik>{{lt icon}} {{cite book | title=Gediminas | first=Alvydas | last=Nikžentaitis | publisher=Vyriausioji enciklopedijų redakcija | location=Vilnius | year=1989 | pages=7–16 }}</ref> Historians recognize one son of Grand Duke [[Vytenis]], Žvelgaitis, who may have died before his father.<ref name=empire/> In 1310, Žvelgaitis, already a mature man, led an army to nearby [[Livonia]], in modern-day [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]].<ref>Nikžentaitis, Alvydas. ''Gediminas'', 23</ref> After Vytenis died heirless in about 1315, Gediminas became the Grand Duke. There are no sources indicating that his  brothers or other family members advanced any competing claims.<ref>Rowell, C. S. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 60</ref> 

Vainius first appears in written sources in 1324. In 1326, as Duke of [[Polatsk]], he signed a treaty with the [[Livonian Order]] and [[Novgorod]].<ref name=vainius>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia |editor=Jonas Zinkus, et. al |encyclopedia=Tarybų Lietuvos enciklopedija |title=Vainius |year=1988 |publisher=Vyriausioji enciklopedijų redakcija |volume=IV |location=Vilnius, Lithuania |pages=419}}</ref> His date of death is unknown; scholars have placed it sometime between 1338<ref name=vainius/> and 1342.<ref name=nik/> Vainius' only known son, Liubko, died in 1342 during a battle with the Livonian Order. 

[[Fiodor of Kiev|Fiodor]], whose relationship to Gediminas was not established until the 20th century, was the longest-lived brother; he was still alive in 1362.<ref name=nik/> In about 1325, with help from Gediminas, he became a Duke of [[Kiev]].<ref name=fiod>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia |first=Edvardas |last=Gudavičius | authorlink=Edvardas Gudavičius | editor= Vytautas Spečiūnas |encyclopedia= Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis žinynas |title=Teodoras |year=2004 |publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos institutas |location=Vilnius |id=ISBN 5-420-01535-8 |pages=31}}</ref> Fiodor was baptized in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox rite]] and his pagan name is unknown. Kiev was still under the influence of the [[Golden Horde]], and Fiodor acknowledged fealty to the Horde's [[Khan]]. This subordination lasted until 1363, when Gediminas' son [[Algirdas]] soundly defeated the Horde in the Battle of Blue Waters.<ref name=fiod/> Scholarly opinion had long considered Fiodor to be a [[Rurikid]], rather than a Lithuanian, because of his Christian name. In 1916, however, a list of property belonging to [[Theognostus]], a deceased [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow|Metropolitan of Moscow]], and compiled in the 1330s, was published; among the items listed were two silver cups gifted by "Fiodor, brother of Gediminas".<ref>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 100</ref>

[[Margiris]], the defender of [[Pilėnai]], is often suggested as the most likely candidate for the fourth brother. The chronicles of [[Hermann de Wartberge]] mention that in 1329 Gediminas and two of his brothers raided Livonia.<ref name=nik/> By that time, Vytenis was already dead, and Fiodor was probably occupied with establishing himself in Kiev. One of these two brothers must then have been Vainius; the identity of the other still puzzles historians. [[Alvydas Nikžentaitis]] suggests that he was Margiris: the sources attest to his high status and wealth.<ref name=nik/> Sources mention one son of Margiris, who was captured by the Teutonic Knights soon after his father's suicide in 1336 and did not return.<ref name=nik/> 

The only direct written mention of Gediminas' sister is a legend describing the murder of two [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s who came to [[Vilnius]] to spread Christianity.<ref name=nik2>Nikžentaitis, Alvydas. ''Gediminas'', 55–57</ref> This legend was first presented in [[Chronica XXIV Generalium]], a chronicle written before 1369. The events probably took place around 1340; some eyewitnesses could still have been alive when the chronicle was written. According to the legend, Friar Ulrich's preaching angered townspeople. He and his companion Martin were seized and brought before Gediminas, who ordered the friars killed. Ulrich was tortured and his body tossed into a river. Martin's body was rescued by Gediminas' sister, an Orthodox nun. She buried Martin at the monastery where she lived.<ref>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 275–276</ref> The legend was retold in other sources, including the [[Bychowiec Chronicle]], where the number of [[martyr]]s was increased to fourteen and the initially realistic story acquired a number of miraculous trappings.<ref name=nik2/>

==Wives==
It is uncertain how many wives Gediminas had. The [[Bychowiec Chronicle]] mentions three  wives: Vida from [[Courland]], Olga from [[Smolensk]], and [[Jewna]] from [[Polatsk]], who was [[Eastern Orthodox]] and died in 1344 or 1345.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Lietuvių enciklopedija | title=Jaunė |first=Zenonas |last=Ivinskis | location=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher=Lietuvių enciklopedijos leidykla |year=1953–1966 |volume=IX |pages=335 |id={{LCC|55020366}} }}</ref> Most modern historians and reference works state that Gediminas' wife was Jewna, dismissing Vida and Olga as fictitious, since no sources other than this chronicle mention the two additional wives.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | editor= Vytautas Spečiūnas |encyclopedia= Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis žinynas |title=Jaunutis |year=2004 |publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos institutas |location=Vilnius |id=ISBN 5-420-01535-8 |pages=38, 46}}</ref> The historian S. C. Rowell argues that Gediminas' wife was a local pagan duchess, on the grounds that his marriage to a princess from a neighboring land would have been noted in other contemporary sources, and that the reliability of the Bychowiec Chronicle has been questioned.<ref name=r87>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 87–88</ref> 

An argument has been advanced that Gediminas had two wives, one pagan and another Orthodox. This case is supported only by the ''Jüngere Hochmeisterchronik'', a late-15th century chronicle, mentioning [[Narimantas]] as half-brother to [[Algirdas]].<ref name=r87/> Other historians, in support of this claim, argue that Gediminas' otherwise mysterious designation of a middle son, [[Jaunutis]], as his successor would be understandable if Jaunutis were the first-born son of Gediminas and a second wife.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kiaupa | first=Zigmantas |coauthors= Jūratė Kiaupienė, Albinas Kunevičius |title= The History of Lithuania Before 1795 |origyear= 1995|edition= English|year= 2000|publisher= Lithuanian Institute of History|location= Vilnius|id= ISBN 9986-810-13-2|pages=118}}</ref> 

==Children and grandchildren==

Because none of Gediminas' siblings had strong heirs, Gediminas and his children were in a favorable position to assume and consolidate power in the Grand Duchy. Gediminas had at least five daughters and seven sons, whose shrewd marriages helped to consolidate and expand the Grand Duchy's influence to areas east and west of Lithuania. Those marriages speak to Gediminas’ diplomatic talent in building alliances with the neighboring states that shared his goals: destruction of the Teutonic Order and containment of the growing power of [[Moscow]] and Poland.<ref name=r87/> The marriages of Gediminas' sons helped to consolidate the dynasty's power over various territories already within the Grand Duchy, while his daughters' and granddaughters' marriages worked to strengthen Lithuanian relationships with neighboring powers.<ref name=r91/> 

===Daughters===
[[Image:Europein1328.png|thumb|300px|Map of Europe in 1328]]
[[Image:Galicia-Volhynia map.PNG|thumb|300px|Map of Halych-Volhynia. Two of Gediminas' children, Liubartas and Eufemija, were involved in succession disputes over Halych-Volhynia]]

In 1320 Maria married [[Dmitri of Tver]], the ruler of a Russian principality. The marriage took place soon after [[Mikhail Yaroslavich]], Dmitri's father, was killed; his sons were searching for strong allies against [[Yury of Moscow]], their principal competitor for the throne of [[Vladimir]] and All Rus'.<ref name=r91/> After 1327 Lithuania began to supplant [[Tver]] as Moscow's chief rival for supremacy in the Rus'. When Tver sought to rival Moscow, it needed an alliance with Lithuania.<ref name=r114>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 114</ref> Dmitri was killed in 1325 and Maria spent the reminder of her life as a widow, but Maria's brother-in-law [[Alexander I, Grand Prince of Tver|Alexander I, the Grand Prince of Tver]], maintained friendly relationships with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: his daughter [[Uliana Alexandrovna of Tver|Uliana]] married [[Algirdas]], the son of Gediminas who continued the Gediminid line.<ref name=r91/> The cooperation between Lithuania and Tver lasted well into the 15th century.<ref name=r91/>

[[Aldona Ona of Lithuania|Aldona]] (baptized as Ona or Anna; her pagan name is known only from the writings of the 16th century chronicler [[Maciej Stryjkowski]]<ref name=aldona2/>) married [[Casimir III of Poland]], son of [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław I of Poland]], when he was 15 or 16 years old. The bride was probably about the same age. The marriage took place on either [[April 30]] or [[October 16]] [[1325]], and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the Polish-Lithuanian coalition against the [[Teutonic Knights]].<ref name=aldona>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | last=Jonynas | first=Ignas | editor=Vaclovas Biržiška | encyclopedia=Lietuviškoji enciklopedija | title=Aldona | year=1933 | publisher=Spaudos Fondas | volume=I | location=Kaunas | pages=208–211}}</ref> The alliance foreshadowed the [[Union of Krewo]] in 1385 and the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569; the latter resulted in a stable and powerful new state, the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name=aldona2>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia |first=Edvardas |last=Gudavičius | authorlink=Edvardas Gudavičius | editor= Vytautas Spečiūnas |encyclopedia= Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis žinynas |title=Aldona |year=2004 |publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos institutas |location=Vilnius |id=ISBN 5-420-01535-8 |pages=40}}</ref> This preliminary coalition was short-lived, collapsing in about 1330, but there is no evidence of military conflict between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive.<ref name=aldona/> The marriage into the Lithuanian dynasty that had ruled since about 1289 might have lent legitimacy to the rule of Władysław I of the [[Piast dynasty]], who was crowned in 1320 replacing the [[Přemyslid dynasty]].<ref name=r87/> Aldona died suddenly at the end of May 1339 and was buried in [[Kraków]]. Aldona had two daughters; Cunigunde (d. 1357) married [[Louis VI the Roman]], the son of [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], and Elisabeth (d. 1361) married Duke [[Bogislaus V]] of [[Pomerania]], an area in modern-day Germany and Poland.<ref name=rgt>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', xxxvi</ref> Elisabeth's daughter, [[Elizabeth of Pomerania]], was the fourth wife of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. 

Gediminas' daughter Elzbieta married Wacław of [[Płock]], one of the [[dukes of Masovia]] in modern-day eastern Poland. Her second name is recorded in writings by [[Maciej Stryjkowski]] (as ''Danmila'') and [[Teodor Narbutt]] (as ''Damila''). It has been suggested these names are misread versions of ''Danutė'',<ref name=elz>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | last=Jonynas | first=Ignas | editor=Vaclovas Biržiška | encyclopedia=Lietuviškoji enciklopedija | title=Damilla | year=1937 | publisher=Spaudos Fondas | volume=V | location=Kaunas | pages=1414}}</ref> a name derived from the word ''[[Daniel]]''. Another interpretation is that historians confused [[Danutė of Lithuania]], daughter of Kęstutis, with Elzbieta.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | last=Jonynas | first=Ignas | editor=Vaclovas Biržiška | encyclopedia=Lietuviškoji enciklopedija | title=Danutė | year=1937 | publisher=Spaudos Fondas | volume=5 | location=Kaunas | pages=1501–1502}}</ref> As an alliance, the marriage was significant because passages to and from western Europe had to pass through [[Masovia]]; it can be seen as an attempt to revive Grand Duke [[Traidenis]]' and his daughter [[Gaudemunda of Lithuania|Gaudemunda's]] link with Masovia in the 1270s.<ref name=r91/> The marriage's importance is attested by Elzbieta's [[dowry]]: 720 Kraków silver [[Mark (weight)|marks]] and nine marks of gold, three times more than an ordinary recorded dowry of the time.<ref name=r91/> This marriage probably took place about 1316, when Gediminas supported Wacław during a civil war in the divided [[Duchy of Masovia]].<ref name=r91/> After Wacław's death in 1336, Elzbieta became a widow and managed her own wealth. She is mentioned for the last time in 1361, when her brother [[Kęstutis]] escaped from [[Malbork|Marienburg]] and sought refuge at his sister's house; historians put her date of death at around 1364.<ref name=elz/> In 1337 Elzbieta's daughter Anna, first mentioned in late 1323, married Henry of [[Żagań]], in modern-day western Poland. Her son Bolesław III or Bolko died without a male heir in 1351 and his land was divided among other dukes.<ref name=rgt/>

Eufemija (also known as Marija, Ofka, and Anka) married [[Boleslaus George II of Halych|Bolesław Jerzy II]] of [[Halych]], in modern-day Ukraine, in 1331. The marriage was engineered in 1323 when the brothers [[Leo of Halych|Leo]] and [[Andrew of Halych]] were slain without leaving heirs. Instead of replacing them with his own son [[Liubartas]] and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas forged a compromise with [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław I of Poland]].<ref name=r224>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 224</ref> Both parties agreed to install Bolesław, cousin of Władysław I and nephew of Gediminas' son-in-law Wacław of Płock, with the marriage to take place later. Bolesław at the time was fourteen years old.<ref name=r224/> In this way the war for control of [[Halych-Volhynia]] was postponed until after Bolesław's poisoning in 1340; control of the area was not stabilized until 1370.<ref name=liub/> According to Teodor Narbutt, Eufemija was drowned beneath the ice of the [[Vistula]] River on [[February 5]] [[1342]], in order to keep her out of the succession disputes.<ref name=r91/>

Aigusta was baptized as Anastasia in order to marry [[Simeon of Russia]] in 1333;<ref name=r91/> he became [[Grand Prince of Moscow]] in 1341. There is no direct evidence that she was a daughter of Gediminas, but because the marriage was high-profile, most historians have concluded that she was a member of Gediminas' family.<ref name=elz>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | last=Jonynas | first=Ignas | editor=Vaclovas Biržiška | encyclopedia=Lietuviškoji enciklopedija | title=Aigustė | year=1933 | publisher=Spaudos Fondas | volume=I | location=Kaunas | pages=112}}</ref> The marriage had great potential because Lithuania and Moscow were fierce rivals for supremacy in [[Ruthenia]], but conflicts broke out again in 1335.<ref name=r91/> Her two sons did not survive infancy; she had a daughter who married a Tverite prince opposing Lithuania.<ref name=r91/> Immediately before her death on [[March 11]] [[1345]], Aigusta became a nun. 

It is possible that Gediminas had two more daughters. According to Maciej Stryjkowski, one of Gediminas' daughters was married to [[David of Hrodna|David]], his  favorite war leader.<ref name=nik/> However, some historians disagree with the conclusion that David was Gediminas' son-in-law, expressing skepticism about the reliability of Stryjkowski's sources.<ref>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 82</ref> 

The existence of another Gediminas' daughter, or rather his another sister, named Elena, might be hypothesized on the basis of some written sources. The list of metropolitan [[Theognostus]]' property (published in 1916) contains a note that Andrei (Mstislavich), Duke of [[Kozelsk]] (ruled from ca. 1320 to 1339), was Gediminas' son-in-law.<ref>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 160–161</ref> On the other hand, the [[ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] word ''ziat''' (''зять'') can mean not only "son-in-law", but also "sister's husband". Hence Andrei of Kozelsk can also be consider as Gediminas' brother-in-law. In addition, the [[Synodik of Liubech]] mentions Lithuanian duke Gomantas (''Гамант''), who most probably is identical to supposed Gediminas' father [[Skalmantas (Gediminids)|Skomantas, or Skalmantas]], and Gomantas' daughter Elena, who was married to Andrei Mstislavich of Kozelsk,<ref>(Russian) Зотов Р. В. ''О черниговских князьях по Любецкому синодику и о Черниговском княжестве в татарское время'' // Летопись занятий Археографической комиссии за 1882–1884 гг., С.-Петербург, 1892, стр. 292.</ref> so it is very likely that Andrei of Kozelsk indeed was Gediminas' brother-in-law.

===Sons===
[[Image:Lithuanian state in 13-15th centuries.png|thumb|300px|Expansion of the Lithuanian state during the 13th-15th centuries]]

The chronicle of [[John of Winterthur]] contains a reference to Gediminas' eight sons.<ref name=nik/> The names of seven sons can be found in various written sources, while the identity of the eighth remains disputed. Alvydas Nikžentaitis suggests that this son was the Duke of [[Trakai]] who perished in 1337 near [[Veliuona]].<ref name=nik/> Duke of Trakai was an important position held either by the Grand Duke himself or his second-in-command. Therefore 18th- and 19th-century historians believed that it was Gediminas himself who died in Veliuona,<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite journal |title=Istorija ir „Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija“ (2) | first=Gediminas |last=Zemlickas |journal=Mokslo Lietuva | date=2006-06-21 |volume=11 |issue=345 |url=http://mokslasplius.lt/mokslo-lietuva/node/41}}</ref> which still advertises itself as the place of Gediminas' burial. Nikžentaitis further postulates that the name of the unknown son might have been Vytautas, as records indicate a Yuri, described as son of Vytautas and Duke of [[Pskov]], who was young but powerful. Yuri died in 1342. His high position in youth could easily be accounted for by being a grandson of Gediminas.<ref name=nik/> However, others dispute these theories, arguing that the note in John of Winterthur's chronicle was misinterpreted.<ref name=r280>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 280</ref>

It is unclear why, but [[Jaunutis]], a middle son not mentioned in any written sources before the [[coup d'état]] accomplished by his brothers, was designated by Gediminas as his heir in [[Vilnius]] and consequently became the Grand Duke.<ref name=r282>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 282–283</ref> His brother [[Kęstutis]], Duke of Trakai, was assisting him in [[Samogitia]]. Despite help from Narimantas, Jaunutis was deposed by his brothers [[Algirdas]] and Kęstutis in 1345, just four years after Gediminas' death.<ref name=r282/> Jaunutis tried, but failed, to solicit help from his brother-in-law [[Simeon of Russia]] and was baptized as ''Iwan'' in the process. He was forced to reconcile with Algirdas and in compensation received the [[Duchy of Zasłaŭje]], which he ruled until his death in 1366.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Simas Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title=Jaunutis | year=1970–1978 | publisher=Juozas Kapočius | volume=II | location=Boston, Massachusetts | id={{LCC|74-114275}} | pages=516}}</ref>

[[Algirdas]] was the son whose heirs continued the Gediminid line. Before deposing his brother Jaunutis in 1345, he ruled [[Kreva]] and, despite remaining pagan, married Maria, a daughter of the last prince of [[Vitebsk]].<ref name=r87/> After 1345 he became the Grand Duke of Lithuania and shared his power with his brother Kęstutis. Their successful collaboration is celebrated in Lithuanian [[historiography]], and gave rise to a much debated theory that a tradition of co-rule or diarchy in Lithuania was customary and arose as early as 1285.<ref name=nik/> The Grand Duchy experienced its greatest expansion during their reign.

This [[Polish-Lithuanian union]], in various forms, survived until the [[Partitions of Poland|third partition]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1795. Jogaila's branch of the Gediminids is known as the [[Jagiellon dynasty]]. 

[[Image:Algirdas the Grand Duke of Lithuania Reversum.jpg|thumb|left|Commemorative silver coin (50 [[Lithuanian litas|litas]]) with a modern portrait of Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1345–1377]]
[[Kęstutis]], Duke of Trakai, despite exercising considerable autonomy while controlling the western provinces of the duchy, was loyal to Algirdas and acknowledged his superiority.  Kęstutis was a devoted pagan and dedicated his life to defending Lithuania from the Teutonic Knights. A popular romantic legend arose about his marriage to the pagan priestess [[Birutė]] of [[Palanga]]. They had seven or eight children, including [[Vytautas the Great]].<ref>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', xxxvi</ref> After Algirdas' death in 1377, his son Jogaila became the Grand Duke. At first Kęstutis and his son Vytautas acknowledged Jogaila's rule, but after Jogaila signed the controversial [[Treaty of Dovydiškės]] with the Teutonic Knights, Kęstutis seized Vilnius and became the Grand Duke in late 1381. In August 1382 he was imprisoned in [[Kreva]] and died there.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite book| first=Zenonas |last=Ivinskis |title=Lietuvos istorija iki Vytauto Didžiojo mirties |publisher=Lietuvių Katalikų Mokslo Akademija |location=Rome |year=1978 |pages=271–274}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045186/Kestutis |title = Kestutis |accessdate = 2007-09-25 |publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] }}</ref> Vytautas continued his fight for supremacy, and the conflicts between the descendants of Algirdas and Kęstutis lasted well into the 15th century.<ref name=r69>Rowell, S.

[[Manvydas]] was the eldest son of Gediminas and inherited the territories of [[Kernavė]] and [[Slonim]] from his father.<ref name=r280/> Little is known about him, and he died soon after Gediminas. It is believed that he was killed in battle during the [[Battle of Strėva]] in 1348 along with his brother [[Narimantas]].<ref name=nik/> 

Narimantas was the second son of Gediminas. He was baptized as Gleb and went on to rule [[Pinsk]], Polatsk, and – as his [[patrimony]] by invitation of [[Novgorod]]'s nobles – [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]], [[Oreshek]] and [[Korela]].<ref name=narim>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia |first=Zigmantas |last=Kiaupa | authorlink=Zigmantas Kiaupa | editor= Vytautas Spečiūnas |encyclopedia= Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis žinynas |title=Narimantas |year=2004 |publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos institutas |location=Vilnius |id=ISBN 5-420-01535-8 |pages=42}}</ref> He initiated a tradition of Lithuanian [[mercenary]] service north of Novgorod on the Swedish border that lasted until Novgorod's fall to Moscow in 1477<ref>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 175</ref> and helped keep Moscow at bay.<ref>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 251</ref> In 1345 Narimantas became the strongest supporter of his deposed brother Jaunutis and went to [[Jani Beg]], Khan of the [[Golden Horde]], to ask for support against Algirdas and Kęstutis. There are rumors that Narimantas married a Tatar princess, but they lack sources.<ref name=r114/> After a few years the brothers reconciled, and it is believed that Narimantas led the Battle of Strėva in the name of Algirdas and died there. He left behind three to five sons who founded Russian princely families, including [[Kurakin]] and [[Galitzine]].<ref name=narim/>

[[Karijotas]] was baptized as Mikhail and inherited [[Navahrudak]] in [[Black Ruthenia]]. In 1348 he was sent by Algirdas to Khan [[Jani Beg]] to negotiate a coalition against the [[Teutonic Knights]], but was handed over to Moscow for ransom.<ref>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 114</ref> He died about 1363. It is uncertain how many children he had: the number varies between four and nine.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Simas Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title=Karijotas | year=1970–1978 | publisher=Juozas Kapočius | volume=III | location=Boston, Massachusetts | id={{LCC|74-114275}} | pages=47–48}}</ref> 

[[Liubartas]] (baptized Dymitr) was Gediminas' youngest son. In the early 1320s he married a daughter of [[Andrew of Halych]] and ruled [[Lutsk]] in eastern Volhynia.<ref name=liub/> After Andrew's and his brother [[Leo II of Halych|Leo of Halych]]'s deaths about 1323, Halych-Volhynia experienced a power vacuum. Rather than promoting Liubartas and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas married his daughter Eufemija to [[Bolesław Jerzy II]] of Halych. War with Poland was thereby postponed until 1340. The issue was settled after 1370, when Poland received [[Halych]], while Lithuania retained [[Volhynia]].<ref name=liub>{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Simas Sužiedėlis | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title=Liubartas | year=1970–1978 | publisher=Juozas Kapočius | volume=III | location=Boston, Massachusetts | id={{LCC|74-114275}} | pages=411–412}}</ref> Liubartas died around 1385, having ruled Volhynia for roughly sixty years. He had three sons.
