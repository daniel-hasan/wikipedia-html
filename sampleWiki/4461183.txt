'''The Penn State College of Engineering''' 

== Overview ==

The Penn State College of Engineering is one of the oldest colleges in [[The Pennsylvania State University]]. It was established in 1896, under the leadership of [[George W. Atherton]]. Today, with 13 academic departments <ref name=factsheet>{{cite web|title=2009 College of Engineering factsheet|url=http://www.engr.psu.edu/AboutCOE/Facts2010.pdf|publisher=PSU|accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref> , over 9,700 enrolled students <ref name=factsheet /> and research expenditures that exceed 100 million dollars annually, Penn State College of Engineering is one of the leading engineering schools in the United States. It is estimated that approximately one out of every fifty engineers in United States with a [[Bachelor's Degree]] in Engineering got that degree from Penn State <ref name=coe>{{cite web|title=College of Engineering|url=http://www.coe.psu.edu/|publisher=PSU|accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref> .
