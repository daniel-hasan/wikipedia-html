==Recording and production==
Prior to the release of ''Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000'', there was some talk of the idea that a [[best of]] album would be a mistake by the band, as they were generally seen to "end of an artist's creative haul".<ref name=AMO /> Australian Music Online, publishing a [[Universal Music Australia]] press release, said these fears were not justified, and that the album would be "a Powderfinger biography that really tells the story better than anyone can on paper".<ref name=AMO>{{cite web|url=http://www.amo.org.au/release.asp?id=6952|title=Fingerprints: The Best Of Powderfinger 1994 - 2000|publisher=Australian Music Online|work=Releases|author=[[Universal Music Australia]]|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>

[[MTV|MTV Scene]] writer Craig Tangsley also commented on fears about the "death" of the band, stating that he spoke to [[Bernard Fanning]] about the band's death as "it's inevitable to talk when someone releases a best of album".<ref name=HSMTV /> Fanning denied that the band was finished, instead claiming that ''Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000'' was spawned due to a deal with the band's record label. He also assured readers that the band had another album planned.<ref name=HSMTV>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindleysite.com/media/mag/Powderfinger_MTVScene_giveemthefinger.htm|title=Give Em' the Finger|publisher=Hindley Site|work=[[MTV|MTV Scene]]|author=Craig Tangsley|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>

''Ciao'' reviewer cocoklo agreed with Universal's assessment, stating that "If there ever was a band, in my opinion, that needed a greatest hits album, it's Powderfinger".<ref name=Ciao /> However, he noted another issue which had some influence on the production of the album - the issue of which songs to include. As the band had only released five albums, they were forced to mostly include the singles they had previously released.<ref name=Ciao>{{cite web|url=http://cd.ciao.co.uk/Fingerprints_The_Best_Of_PowderFinger_1994_2000_Powderfinger__Review_5543644 |title=I need somewhere to begin....|publisher=Ciao|work=Reviews|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>

Throughout production stages, the album was not referred to as ''Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994 - 2000'', but rather by its alternative title; ''From Heavy Metal to Centenary Medal''. It is unknown when the band decided on the final title of the album.<ref name=Fingerprints>{{cite book|author=[[Powderfinger]]|title=Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000|pages=Back cover|year=2004|publisher=[[Universal Music Australia]]}}</ref><ref name=Sputrev>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=7124|title=Powderfinger - Parables for Wooden Ears|publisher=Sputnikmusic|author=James Bishop|date=[[12 April]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref>
