{{Nihongo|'''''Fate/stay night'''''|フェイト／ステイナイト|Feito／sutei naito}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[eroge]] [[visual novel]] game created by [[Type-Moon]], which was originally released on [[January 30]], [[2004]]. It has been adapted into an [[anime]] [[Television program|television series]], which was animated by [[Studio Deen]] and aired between [[January 6]] [[2006]] through [[June 16]] [[2006]].

The official announcement and teaser trailer of the anime were first shown at the ''Rondo Robe 2005 "-Gate to Date-"'' event in Japan on [[June 26]] [[2005]], and a curtain-raiser DVD was released in Japan during November 2005.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.staynight.com/top.html|title=Official Fate/stay night animation homepage|accessdate=2006-11-26|language=Japanese}}</ref> An all-ages version of ''Fate/stay night'', titled ''Fate/stay night Realta Nua'', was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] on [[April 19]], [[2007]], and features the [[seiyū]] from the anime series. The series has been adapted into a [[manga]] series, which began serialization in the monthly ''[[Shōnen Ace]]'' magazine.

==Premise==
''Fate/stay night'' chronicles a two-week period in the life of [[Shirō Emiya]], an amateur mechanic who attends school called Homurabara Gakuen in Fuyuki City. Ten years ago, Shirō was caught in a massive fire hazard that incinerated his parents and consumed a large portion of the city; as he was dying, an enigmatic man discovers and treats him. This man, [[Kiritsugu Emiya]], decides to adopt him, though the two maintain a distant relationship because of Kiritsugu's frequent departures from Fuyuki City. One moonlit night, Kiritsugu and Shirō had a discussion outside of their home, and Shirō discovers a fact about his father that Kiritsugu was actually a mage.</br>
</br>
{{cquote|''I have a secret that I haven't told you--- I'm a Magi.''}}

Through their conversation, Shirō learns of his foster father's failed life ambition to become a {{Nihongo|"Hero of Justice"|正義の味方|Seigi no Mikata}}, a guardian of mankind who could protect the weak and innocent. Touched by Kiritsugu's conviction, Shirō affirms to his foster father that he intends to devote his life to achieving that distant ideal, much to Kiritsugu's chagrin. To do this, Shirō pleads with a begrudging Kiritsugu to teach him {{Nihongo|''sorcery''|魔術|Majutsu}}; but Shirō proves to be talentless in almost all the fundamental sorcerous disciplines. 

Kiritsugu warns his son that the life of a sorcerer is one that leads to destruction, but if he is truly set on benefiting people, he should apply his knowledge in secret and hone his craft in private. After Kiritsugu dies, Shirō becomes frustrated with his progress, for he feels inadequate about his good deeds through sorcery and is unsure of how to orient his future to contribute more.

Unknown to Shirō, Fuyuki City is the setting for a secret and violent war among competing [[magus|magi]]. For the past two centuries, seven sorcerers have gathered and engage in a Battle Royale, each gambling his or her own life to obtain the [[Holy Grail]], a legendary chalice capable of granting wishes. The past four Holy Grail Wars have typically occurred every sixty years, with the most recent concluding a decade ago, but the fifth war has eerily started prematurely.

Each of the sorcerers, better known as ''Masters'', are aided by one of the seven summoned spiritual familiars known as ''Servants'', who are the reincarnations of legendary souls from all across time. These resurrected {{Nihongo|''Epic Spirits''|英霊|Eirei}}, possess superhuman characteristics and wield powerful artifacts or abilities called {{Nihongo|''Noble Phantasms''|宝具|Hōgu}}. A Noble Phantasm's hidden abilities may be released by invoking its true name, but casual brandishing of a Noble Phantasm is best avoided, for symbolic Noble Phantasms usually belie a Servant's identity, diminishing that Servant's competitive advantage. Specific legends may be summoned with the aid of catalysts, which are artifacts, ideas, or experiences similar or of value to the desired Servant. Only one Servant can be summoned in each war from one of seven classes: ''Saber'', ''Archer'', ''Lancer'', ''Berserker'', ''Rider'', ''Assassin'', and ''Caster''.

The Holy Grail is a spiritual artifact, so only astral entities, such as Servants, are capable of touching it; this restriction forces Master and Servant to cooperate with each other against rival pairs, even if a situation entails fighting to the death. Masters control Servants with three {{Nihongo|''Command Mantra''|令呪|Reiju}}, which are crystallized miracles issued by the Holy Grail that manifest on a Master's hand. When activated, Command Mantra permit a Servant to accomplish an incredible feat, or alternatively provide Masters with the authority to issue an irrevocable and absolute order to a Servant. In the event of a Master's demise, a Servant may choose to bind him or herself to another Master; if a Servant is slain, a Master may ally with a wayward Servant or pursue sanctuary with the Holy Grail War's impartial supervisor, who is traditionally a delegate of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].   

After cleaning his school's [[kyūdō]] (archery) [[dojo]] late one night, Shirō stumbles upon two Servants, [[Archer (Fate/stay night)|Archer]] and [[Lancer (Fate/stay night)|Lancer]], battling in the school courtyard. To avoid compromising the war's secrecy, Lancer hunts down and pierces Shirō in the heart with a spear. For an unknown reason, Shirō's classmate, [[Rin Tōsaka]], uses an heirloom filled with concentrated magic, {{Nihongo|''Mana''|魔力|Maryoku}}, to resuscitate him. Shaken and dazed, Shirō goes back to his home, but is again attacked by Lancer. Shirō weakly defends himself against Lancer but is soon overwhelmed by the powerful Servant's attack. After the battle prelonged, Shiro falls into his storage room. Cornered, Shirō prepares for the worst; but before Lancer can inflict another fatal blow, a young woman outfitted in alabaster armor blocks Lancer's spear. She drove Lancer away from Shirou. She introduces herself to Shirō as [[Saber (Fate/stay night)|Saber]], and greets him with the words:</br>

==Characters==
{{main|List of Fate/stay night characters}}
As with ''[[Tsukihime]]'', the character base in ''Fate/stay night'' is extremely comprehensive and expansive, with characters possessing varied and extraordinary abilities.

[[image:Emiya Saber.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Shirō Emiya and Saber]]
;{{Nihongo|[[Shirō Emiya]]|衛宮 士郎|Emiya Shirō}}:Shirō is the main character of the story. He is a serious yet helpful, hardworking, and honest teenager. His hobbies include fixing a variety of broken things, from VCRs to stoves, as well as cooking and cleaning. He has some slight talent with sorcery, though he was discouraged by his foster father Kiritsugu Emiya from improving his gifts. He is initially confused about the Holy Grail War and attempts to irrationally shield others from danger, including his own Servant, Saber.

;{{Nihongo|[[Saber (Fate/stay night)|Saber]]|セイバー|Seibā}}:
:She is Shirō's Servant, an agile but powerful [[warrior]]. Loyal, independent, and reserved, Saber acts coldly but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. Her class is considered the "Most Outstanding", with excellent ratings in all categories. Since her Master cannot effectively provide her with Mana, she minimizes her activity to preserve what she has. Saber is frustrated by Shirō's "protective" tendencies, believing his erratic and reckless behavior will jeopardize her chances of winning the Holy Grail War.

[[image:Rin Archer.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Rin Tōsaka and Archer]]
;{{Nihongo|[[Rin Tōsaka]]|遠坂 凛|Tōsaka Rin}}
:A model student and idol of Shirō's school who is secretly a sorceress and Master in the Holy Grail War. She is a descendant from a long line of sorcerers, and though she lacks a formal magic education, she is extremely powerful in her own right. Her father was killed in the fourth Holy Grail War, and she has trained since his death to succeed him. She is perceptive, resourceful and avidly competitive. She tried to summon a Saber-class Servant, but she accidentally called Archer instead.

;{{Nihongo|[[Archer (Fate/stay night)|Archer]]|アーチャー|Āchā}}:
:He is the Servant of one of the series' main heroines, Rin Tōsaka. Due to an incomplete summon, he apparently has no memory of his previous life or identity. Archer is sarcastic and cynical - but under his hardened exterior lies a complex and dark personality that unfolds throughout the story. Though skilled with ranged weapons, he can hold his own in [[mêlée]] combat. Archer considers [[Shirō Emiya]]'s idealism to be weak and delusional, recognizing Shirō's mentality of "wanting to save everyone" as naïve and impossible.

[[Image:Ilya.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Illyasviel von Einzbern and Berserker]]
;{{Nihongo|[[Illyasviel von Einzbern]]|イリヤスフィール・フォン・アインツベルン|Iriyasufīru fon Aintsuberun}}:
:A young [[Germany|Teutonic]] aristocrat, she traveled to Japan to participate in the Holy Grail War as a Master. Illyasviel has an [[angel]]ic appearance and an unsurpassed degree of magical power. She lives in a castle on the outskirts of Fuyuki City, accompanied only by her Servant and two maids. Illyasviel asks those she feels comfortable around to simply call her "Ilya".

;{{Nihongo|[[Berserker (Fate/stay night)|Berserker]]|バーサーカー|Bāsākā}}:
:The Servant of Ilya, who appears as a swarthy [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] with adamantine skin and immense strength. He wields a colossal stone Axe-Club, and is capable of causing massive destruction with the mere backlash of his swings. As a Berserker, he is stripped of his sanity and reason, acting [[feral]] and animalistic in combat. Berserkers are praised as members of the "Strongest" class, though they are difficult to control and always turn on their Masters. Ilya appears to have little trouble managing him.

;{{Nihongo|[[Sakura Matō]]|間桐 桜|Matō Sakura}}
:A student in her first year of high school, and the sister of Shinji Matō. After Shirō's father Kiritsugu died, Sakura often visited Shirō's home to help him with his daily chores. Though Shinji is from a family of sorcerers, he asserts that she has no knowledge of her family's craft or history. Sakura is outwardly shy and timid, but possesses great inner strength. She has a long standing and obvious crush on Shirō Emiya.

[[Image:Shinji Rider.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Shinji Matō and Rider]]
;{{Nihongo|[[Shinji Matō]]|間桐 慎二|Matō Shinji}}
:Sakura Matō's older brother, and a long-time friend of Shirō. Shinji is very popular as vice-captain of the archery dojo despite being chauvinistic and a narcissist. Like Rin Tōsaka, he is of a distinguished lineage of sorcerers, though the Matō blood has thinned and no longer produces heirs naturally capable of sorcery. Shinji feels uncomfortable with his sister's daily visits to Shirō's home. He has an open crush on Rin, but she does not return his favors.

;{{Nihongo|[[Rider (Fate/stay night)|Rider]]|ライダー|Raidā}}:
:The Servant of Shinji, first seen scouting around Homurabara Gakuen. Rider is silent, sultry, and vigilant, never hesitating to shield her Master from harm. With Shinji incapable of lending Mana to her, she is forced to seek alternative means to augment her abilities. To compensate for her weakness, Rider employs covert battle tactics and takes full advantage of territory around her. Her weapon of choice is a pair of long iron nails fastened to opposite ends of a single chain, which she effectively thrusts from distances.

==Media==
The popularity of the ''Fate/stay night'' visual novel has expanded beyond the video game; the expanded fields of media include an anime adaption, as well as an officially sponsored manga. Various [[doujin]], including fan-developed video games (such as ''[[Fatal/Fake]]'') have become prominent, complementing the rise of [[fanart]] and amateur manga dedicated to characters or themes in ''Fate/stay night''.

===Video game===
{{see also|Fate/stay night scenarios|Fate/hollow ataraxia|Fate/Zero}}
The ''Fate/stay night'' franchise began as a [[visual novel]] [[video game]] created by [[Type-Moon]] which premiered in Japan on [[January 30]] [[2004]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://typemoon.com/product/index.html|title=Official Type-Moon product information page|accessdate=2006-11-30|language=Japanese}}</ref> It was Type-Moon's first commercial work, following their transition from a [[dōjin soft]] visual novel group. An all-ages version of ''Fate/stay night'', entitled ''Fate/stay night Realta Nua'', was released for the [[PlayStation 2]]<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.ps2-fate.com/realta_nua/hana_ps2/index.html|title=Official Type-Moon '' 	Fate/stay night ［Realta Nua］ extra edition　の特典として付属'' homepage|accessdate=2007-01-16|language=Japanese}}</ref> on April 19, [[2007]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.ps2-fate.com/|title=Official Type-Moon ''Fate/stay night Realta Nua'' homepage|accessdate=2006-11-26|language=Japanese}}</ref> ''Fate'', ''Unlimited Blade Works'' and ''Heaven's Feel'' are the three branching [[Plot (narrative)|storylines]] found within the game. Each diverge at certain points, and, depending upon player interaction, will end in one of several possible ways. The ''Fate'' scenario features Saber as the main heroine. In ''Unlimited Blade Works'', Rin Tōsaka is the main female lead but the storyline focuses around her Servant, Archer. ''Heaven's Feel'' expands on the dark history of Sakura Matō. The ''Heaven's Feel'' scenario connects to the story of ''Fate/hollow ataraxia''. The plot of the anime series is an amalgam of the three game scenarios, though it heavily favors the events of ''Fate'' over the other two.

On [[October 28]] [[2005]], Type-Moon released a sequel to ''Fate/stay night'', entitled ''Fate/hollow ataraxia''.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://typemoon.org/product/hollow/main.html|title=Official Type-Moon ''Fate/hollow ataraxia'' homepage|accessdate=2006-11-26|language=Japanese}}</ref> Regarded more as a fan disc and a side-story rather than a serious sequel, its plot is set half a year after the events of ''Fate/stay night'' and features new characters such as [[Avenger (Fate/hollow ataraxia)|Avenger]], [[Bazett Fraga McRemitz]], and [[Caren Ortensia]], alongside returning characters such as Shirō Emiya and Rin Tōsaka.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://typemoon.org/product/hollow/main.html|title=Official Type-Moon ''Fate/hollow ataraxia'' homepage|accessdate=2006-11-26|language=Japanese}}</ref>

On [[November 22]] [[2006]], Type-Moon announced a new installment in the ''Fate/stay night'' franchise, entitled ''Fate/Zero''. ''Fate/Zero'' is a prequel to ''Fate/stay night'', stressing the events of the 4th Holy Grail War and how its consequences affected the 5th Holy Grail War. In contrast to ''Fate/stay night'', ''Fate/Zero'' will be a series of [[light novels]] instead of a visual novel, and will be told in a third person narrative that follows the actions of multiple characters. The first volume was released on [[December 12]] [[2006]], and is a collaboration between Type-Moon and fellow developer [[Nitroplus]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.fate-zero.com/|title=Official Type-Moon ''Fate/Zero'' homepage|accessdate=2006-11-26|language=Japanese}}</ref> The second volume was released on [[March 31]] [[2007]]. The third volume was released on [[July 27]] [[2007]]. The fourth and final volume will be released on [[December 29]] [[2007]], along with the ''Fate/Zero Original Image Soundtrack "Return to Zero"''.

===Manga===
The ''Fate/stay night'' [[manga]], illustrated by Nishiwaki Datto, began serialization in the manga magazine ''[[Shōnen Ace]]'', published by [[Kadokawa Shoten]], on [[December 26]] [[2005]]. It is an adaption of the ''Fate/stay night'' visual novel, rather than the anime. In contrast to the anime, the manga focuses solely on the ''Unlimited Blade Works'' scenario of the game, and has refrained from pooling story elements from the sister scenarios, ''Fate/hollow ataraxia'' or ''Fate/Zero''. Four [[Tankōbon|bound volumes]] have been released in Japan, with a fifth being released in December 2007.

===Anime===
{{see also|List of Fate/stay night episodes|List of Fate/stay night cast members}}
The ''Fate/stay night'' [[anime]] series aired between [[January 6]] [[2006]] and [[June 16]] [[2006]], containing 24 episodes. It was animated by [[Studio Deen]] and produced by the Fate Project, which included [[Geneon Entertainment]], [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]], CREi, Type-Moon and Frontier Works Inc. The series later received its international television premieres on the anime television network [[Animax]] in [[2007]], also receiving its English-language television premiere on Animax's English networks in [[Southeast Asia]] from June 2007, as well as its other networks in [[South Korea]], [[Hong Kong]] and other regions.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://express.animax-asia.com/cp.aspx?p=WiYC1UmQWX8k1Ks9kncVdi7XIeyW2/P8yKKUgNzDZL8ybzT57tdq2A== |title=Animax Rave April Issue|accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animax-asia.com/schedule/|title=Animax East Asia|accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref> Geneon also licensed the series for distribution across [[North America]]. It is an adaptation of the ''Fate/stay night'' visual novel, featuring content from all of the available scenarios in the original game's release. The general direction of the anime borrows heavily from the ''Fate'' scenario, with select segments from ''Unlimited Blade Works'' included as filler while only a couple nods are given toward the ''Heaven's Feel'' option. Elements from ''Fate/hollow ataraxia'' not directly impacting the plot were included, but sparingly. [[Kenji Kawai]] composed the original music for the series, also remixing three symphonic themes from the ''Fate/stay night'' visual novel for use in the anime; they are "Yakusoku Sareta Shouri No Tsurugi", "Emiya", and "This Illusion", the latter of which was retitled "disillusion".

===Music===
There is an arranged soundtrack of the game music, entitled ''Avalon - Fate/Stay Night''.  It is arranged by WAVE and [[K. JUNO]] and features two English arranged versions of "This Illusion" titled "Illusion/Vision" and "Illusion/Fate". The anime original soundtrack was arranged and composed by [[Kenji Kawai]].

==Reception==
When released on [[January 30]] [[2004]], ''Fate/stay night'' rapidly became one of the most popular visual novels in history, securing the title of "highest selling visual novel" in 2004.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.getchu.com/pc/salesranking2004.html|title=Getchu.com PC visual novel sales rankings for 2004|accessdate=2006-11-30}}</ref> A "fan disk" sequel, ''[[Fate/hollow ataraxia]]'', was released on [[October 28]] [[2005]], which became one of the top selling visual novels of 2005.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.getchu.com/pc/salesranking2005.html|title=Getchu.com PC visual novel sales rankings for 2005 |accessdate=2006-11-30}}</ref> The popularity of the visual novel lead to the formation of the "Fate Project", which in cooperation with Geneon Japan and Studio Deen produced a twenty-four episode anime series based on the original story in 2006. During that same year, a PS2 port for ''Fate/stay night'' entitled ''Fate/stay night[Realta Nua]'' was scheduled for a Fall/Winter release, but was pushed back to 2007. A prequel known as ''Fate/Zero'' was produced through a collaboration with fellow visual novel company Nitroplus, which could be obtained prior to the official release date at [[Comiket]] 2006. In early 2007, the popularity of ''Fate/stay night'' and the anime [[seiyū]] lead to the launch of the ''Fate/stay tune'' internet radio drama, featuring the voice talent of [[Kana Ueda]] and [[Ayako Kawasumi]]. Another project elaborating on ''Fate/stay night'' canon has been planned, but as is the case with ''Fate/Zero'', Type-Moon itself will have little, if any, direct involvement. Although no official translation or licensing of the visual novels has taken place overseas, several fan groups have translated parts of the original game into English.
