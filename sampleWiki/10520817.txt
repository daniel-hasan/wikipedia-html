The western-end starts off in front of the ''McMaster Medical Centre'' as a two-way street and passes through [[Westdale, Ontario|Westdale]] and then at ''Paradise Road South'', ''King Street'' switches over to a one-way street (Westbound) right through the city's core up to ''the Delta'', a spot in town where ''King'' and [[Main Street (Hamilton, Ontario)|Main Streets]] intersect. (West of ''the Delta'', King Street is North of Main Street. East of ''the Delta'' after ''King'' crosses over Main Street, King then runs South of Main Street.)
