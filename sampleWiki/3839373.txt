'''Odin''' or '''Odinn''' ([[Old Norse]]/[[Icelandic]] ''Óðinn'', also known as '''Oden''', Woden or Wodan), is considered the chief [[Æsir|god]] in [[Norse mythology]] and [[Norse paganism]]. Like the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] ''[[Woden]]'' it is descended from [[Proto-Germanic]]  '''''*[[Wodanaz|Wōđinaz]]''''' or '''''*Wōđanaz'''''. 

His name is related to  ''[[óðr]]'', meaning "fury", "excitation", "mind" or "poetry".  His role, like many of the Norse [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], is complex. He is a god of [[wisdom]], [[war]], battle and death. He is also attested as being a god of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[poetry]], [[prophecy]], victory and the hunt.

==Characteristics==
<!--poetic/mantic "odhr"-->
Odin is an ambivalent deity. [[Old Norse]] ([[Viking Age]]) connotations of Odin lie with "poetry, inspiration" as well as with "fury, madness and the wanderer."  Odin sacrificed his eye (which eye he sacrificed is unclear) at [[Mímir]]'s spring in order to gain the Wisdom of Ages.  Odin gives to worthy poets the [[mead]] of inspiration, made by the dwarfs, from the vessel ''Óð-rœrir''.<ref>''[[Skaldskaparmal]],'' in ''Edda.'' Anthony Faulkes, Trans., Ed. (London: Everyman, 1996).</ref>

<!--Wild hunt, receiver of the dead-->
Odin is associated with the concept of the [[Wild Hunt]], a noisy, bellowing movement across the sky, leading a host of slain warriors. 

Consistent with this, [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s [[Prose Edda]] depicts Odin as welcoming the great, dead warriors who have died in battle into his hall, [[Valhalla]], which, when literally interpreted, signifies the hall of the slain. The fallen, the ''[[einherjar]]'', are assembled and entertained by Odin in order that they in return might fight for, and support, the gods in the final battle of the end of [[Midgard]], [[Ragnarök]].

<!--war-->
He is also a god of war, appearing throughout Norse myth as the bringer of victory. In the [[Norse saga]]s, Odin sometimes acts as the instigator of wars, and is said to have been able to start wars by simply throwing down his [[javelin]] [[Gungnir]], and/or sending his [[valkyrie]]s, to influence the battle toward the end that he desires. The [[Valkyrie]]s are Odin's beautiful battle maidens that went out to the fields of war to select and collect the worthy men who died in battle to come and sit at ''Odin's table'' in Valhalla, feasting and battling until they had to fight in the final battle, [[Ragnarök]]. Odin would also appear on the battle-field, sitting upon his eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]], with his two ravens, one on each shoulder, [[Hugin and Munin|Hugin (Thought) and Munin (Memory)]], and two wolves([[Geri and Freki]]) on each side of him.

Odin is also associated with trickery, [[kenning|cunning]], and deception. Most sagas have tales of Odin using his cunning to overcome adversaries and achieve his goals, such as swindling the blood of Kvasir from the [[dwarves]].

[[Image:Tangelgarda Odin.jpg|thumb|The 7th century [[Tängelgarda stone]] shows Odin leading a troop of warriors all bearing rings. [[Valknut]] symbols are drawn beneath his horse, which at this time still has the normal number of legs.]]
[[Worship]] of Odin may date to [[Proto-Germanic]]  [[Germanic paganism|paganism]]. The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] may refer to Odin when he talks of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. The reason is that, like Mercury, Odin was regarded as [[Psychopomp]]os,"the leader of souls." 

Some support for Odin as a latecomer to the Scandinavian Norse pantheon can be found in the Sagas where, for example, at one time he is thrown out of [[Asgard]] by the other gods - a seemingly unlikely tale for a well established "all father".  Scholars who have linked Odin with the "Death God" template include [[E. A. Ebbinghaus]], [[Jan de Vries]] and [[Thor Templin]].  The later two also link [[Loki]] and Odin as being one-and-the-same until the early Norse Period. 

Scandinavian ''Óðinn'' emerged from [[Proto-Norse]] ''*Wōdin'' during the [[Migration period]], [[Vendel]] artwork ([[bracteate]]s, [[image stone]]s) depicting the earliest scenes that can be aligned with the High Medieval Norse mythological texts. The context of the new elites emerging in this period aligns with [[Snorri]]'s tale of the indigenous [[Vanir]] who were eventually replaced by the [[Aesir]], intruders from the Continent.[http://www.algonet.se/~arador/postfestum.html]

Parallels between Odin and Celtic [[Lugus]] have often been pointed out: both are intellectual gods, commanding magic and poetry. Both have ravens and a spear as their attributes, and both are one-eyed. [[Julius Caesar]] (''de bello Gallico'', 6.17.1) mentions Mercury as the chief god of [[Celtic religion]].  A likely context of the diffusion of elements of Celtic ritual into Germanic culture is that of the [[Chatti]], who lived at the Celtic-Germanic boundary in [[Hesse]] during the final centuries before the Common Era. (It must be remembered that Odin in his Proto-Germanic form was not the chief god, but that he only gradually replaced [[Tyr]] during the [[Migration period]].)

==Blót==
It is attested in primary sources that sacrifices were made to Odin during [[blót]]s. [[Adam of Bremen]] relates that every ninth year, people assembled from all over [[Sweden]] to sacrifice at the [[Temple at Uppsala]]. Male slaves and males of each [[species]] were sacrificed and hung from the branches of the trees. 

As the Swedes had the right not only to elect their king but also to depose him, the [[sagas]] relate that both King [[Domalde]] and King [[Olof Trätälja]] were sacrificed to Odin after [[year]]s of [[famine]]. It has been argued that the killing of a combatant in battle was to give a sacrificial offering to Odin. The fickleness of Odin in war was well-documented; in [[Lokasenna]], [[Loki]] taunts Odin for his inconsistency.

Sometimes sacrifices were made to Odin to bring about [[change]]s in circumstance. A notable example is the sacrifice of King [[Víkar]] that is detailed in [[Gautrek's Saga]] and in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' account of the same event. Sailors in a fleet being blown off course drew lots to sacrifice to Odin that he might abate the [[wind]]s. The king himself drew the lot and was hanged.

Sacrifices were probably also made to Odin at the beginning of summer (mid [[April]], actually--summer being reckoned essentially the same as did the Celt, at Beltene, Calan Mai [Welsh], which is Mayday--hence as summer's "herald"), since [[Ynglinga saga]] states one of the great festivals of the calendar is ''at sumri, þat var sigrblót'' "in summer, for victory"; Odin is consistently referred to throughout the Norse mythos as the bringer of victory. 
The Ynglinga saga also details the sacrifices made by the Swedish king [[Aun]], to whom it was revealed that he would lengthen his life by sacrificing [[one]] of his sons every [[ten]] years; nine of his ten sons died this way. When he was about to sacrifice his last son [[Ongenþeow|Egil]], the Swedes stopped him.

==Eddic==

According to the [[Prose Edda]], Odin, the first and most powerful of the Aesir, was a son of [[Bestla]] and [[Borr]] and brother of [[Ve]] and [[Vili]]. With these brothers, he cast down the [[frost]] [[giant]] [[Ymir]] and made [[Earth]] from Ymir's [[body]]. The [[three]] brothers are often mentioned together. "Wille" is the German word for "will" (English), and indeed Villi is known as "Vilje" in modern Norwegian, which is also the word for "will".  "Weh" is the German word (Gothic ''wai'') for "woe" (English: great sorrow, [[grief]], misery) but is more likely related to the archaic German "Wei" meaning 'sacred'.

Odin had several wives, with whom he fathered many children. With his first wife, [[Frigg]], he fathered his most gentle son [[Balder]], who stood for happiness, goodness, wisdom, and [[beauty]]. He also fathered the blind god Hodr, who was representative of [[darkness]] (in contrast to Balder's [[light]]).  [[Frigg]] is best known for her love of her son Balder, as well as the story of how she travelled Earth in order to protect him from fated death. By the Earth Goddess [[Jord]] (Fjorgin) Odin was the father of his most famous son, [[Thor]] the Thunderer. By the giantess [[Grid (Jotun)|Grid]], Odin was the father of [[Vidar|Vídar]], and by [[Rind]]a he was father of [[Váli (son of Odin)|Váli]]. Also, many royal families claimed descent from Odin through other sons. For traditions about Odin's offspring, see ''[[Sons of Odin]]''.

According to the [[Hávamál]] Edda, Odin was also the creator of the [[Runic alphabet]].  It is possible that the legends and genealogies mentioning Odin originated in a real, prehistoric Germanic chieftain who was subsequently deified; but this is presently impossible to prove or disprove.

===Exploits ===
[[Image:Manuscript Odinn.jpg|thumb|200px|Odin with his ravens and weapons (MS [[SÁM 66]], eighteenth century)]]
Odin and his brothers, Vili and Ve, are attributed with slaying [[Ymir]], the Ancient Giant, to form [[Midgard]]. From Ymir's flesh, the brothers made the earth, and from his shattered [[bone]]s and [[teeth]] they made the [[rock]]s and stones.  From Ymir's [[blood]], they made the [[river]]s and [[lake]]s.  Ymir's [[skull]] was made into the sky, secured at four points by four dwarfs named [[East]], [[West]], [[North]], and [[South]]. From Ymir's [[brain]]s, the three [[God]]s shaped the [[cloud]]s, whereas Ymir's eye-brows became a barrier between Jotunheim (giant's home) and Midgard, the place where men now dwell. Odin and his brothers are also attributed with making humans. 

After having made earth from Ymir's flesh, the three brothers came across two logs (or an ash and an [[elm tree]]). Odin gave them breath and [[life]]; Vili gave them brains and feelings; and Ve gave them [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] and [[sight]]. The first man was [[Ask and Embla|Ask]] and the first woman was [[Ask and Embla|Embla]] and from them all human families are descended. Many kings and royal houses claim to trace their lineage back to Odin through Ask and Embla.

Odin ventured to [[Mímir]]'s Well, near Jötunheim, the land of the giants; not as Odin, but as Vegtam the Wanderer, clothed in a dark [[blue]] cloak and carrying a traveller's staff. To drink from the Well of Wisdom, Odin had to sacrifice his [[eye]] (which eye he sacrified is unclear), symbolizing his willingness to gain the [[knowledge]] of the past, present and future. As he drank, he saw all the sorrows and troubles that would fall upon men and the gods. He also saw why the sorrow and troubles had to come to men.  

Mímir accepted Odin's eye and it sits today at the bottom of the Well of Wisdom as a sign that the father of the gods had paid the price for wisdom. Sacrifice for the greater good is a recurring theme in Norse mythology, as in the case of [[Tyr]], who sacrificed his [[hand]] to fetter [[Fenrisulfr]].

Odin was said to have learned the mysteries of [[seid]] from the [[Vanir|Vanic]] goddess and [[völva]] [[Freya|Freyja]], despite the unwarriorly connotations of using [[magic]]. In ''[[Lokasenna]]'', [[Loki]] derides Odin for practicing seid, implying it was women's work. Another example of this may be found in the ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' where Snorri opines that men who used seid were ''[[ergi]]'' or ''unmanly''.

Odin's quest for wisdom can also be seen in his work as a farmhand for a [[summer]], for [[Baugi]], and his seduction of [[Gunnlod]] in order to obtain the mead of [[poetry]]. (See [[Fjalar and Galar]] for more details.) 

In the [[Rúnatal]], a section of the [[Hávamál]], Odin is attributed with discovering runes. He was hanged from the [[tree]] called [[Yggdrasill]] while pierced by his own javelin for [[nine]] [[day]]s and [[night]]s, in order to learn the wisdom that would give him power in the nine worlds. Nine is a significant number in Norse magical practice (there were, for example, [[The Nine Worlds of Norse Mythology|nine realms of existence]]), thereby learning nine (later [[eighteen]]) magical songs and eighteen magical runes.   

Some scholars hypothesize that this [[legend]] influenced the story of [[Christ]]'s [[crucifixion]].  It is also similar to the story of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s [[enlightenment]]. In Shamanism, the traversal of the [[axis mundi]] by the shaman to bring back knowledge is a common pattern. We know that sacrifices, human or otherwise, to the gods were commonly hung in or from trees, often transfixed by [[spear]]s. (See also: [[Peijainen]]) Additionally, one of Odin's names is ''Ygg'', and the Norse name for the World Ash &mdash;[[Yggdrasill]]&mdash;therefore could mean "Ygg's (Odin's) horse". Another of Odin's names is ''Hangatýr'', the god of the hanged.

===Attributes===

Odin had three residences in Asgard. First was Gladsheim, a vast hall where he presided over the [[twelve]] Diar or Judges, whom he had appointed to regulate the affairs of Asgard. Second, [[Valaskjálf]], built of solid [[silver]], in which there was an elevated place, [[Hlidskjalf]], from his throne on which he could perceive all that passed throughout the whole earth. Third was [[Valhalla]] (the hall of the fallen), where Odin received the [[soul]]s of the warriors killed in battle, called the [[Einherjar]]. The souls of women warriors, and those strong and beautiful women whom Odin favored, became [[Valkyries]], who gather the souls of warriors fallen in battle (the [[Einherjar]]), as these would be needed to fight for him in the battle of [[Ragnarök]]. They took the souls of the warriors to Valhalla. Valhalla has five hundred and forty gates, and a vast hall of [[gold]], hung around with golden shields, and spears and coats of mail.

[[Image:Ardre Odin Sleipnir.jpg|thumb|220px|A depiction of Odin entering [[Valhalla]] riding on [[Sleipnir]] from the [[Tängvide image stone]].]]

Odin has a number of magical artifacts associated with him: the dwarven javelin [[Gungnir]], which never misses its target; a magical gold ring ([[Draupnir]]), from which every ninth night eight new rings appear; and two [[raven]]s [[Huginn and Muninn]] ([[Thought]] and [[Memory]]), who fly around Earth daily and report the happenings of the world to Odin in Valhalla at night. He also owned [[Sleipnir]], an octopedal [[horse]], who was given to Odin by [[Loki]], and the severed [[head]] of [[Mímir]], which foretold the future. He also commands a pair of wolves named [[Geri and Freki]], to whom he gives his food in Valhalla since he consumes nothing but [[mead]] or wine. From his throne, [[Hlidskjalf]] (located in [[Valaskjalf]]), Odin could see everything that occurred in the [[universe]]. 

The [[Valknut]] (slain warrior's knot) is a symbol associated with Odin. It consists of three interlaced triangles.


===Stories And Myths===

Odin had not yet drunk from the [[Well of Wyrd]] when he found [[Loki]] the handsome [[Jotun]]. Odin saw how talented Loki was and requested that the two become foster brothers. Loki agreed and was brought up to [[Asgard]] immediately, where the [[Æsir]] welcomed him warmly as Odin's brother.

Another myth tells of the time that Odin found a [[Jotun]] guarding an object protectively. Full of curiosity Odin summoned the Jotun at once and asked him his name. The Jotun replied that his name was [[Mímir|Mimir]]. Odin then asked him what his object was.

"It is the Well of Knowledge" Mimir replied, and, seeing the look in Odin's eyes added and you may have a drink- if you give me one of your all-seeing eyes. Odin readily agreed and took  out one of his eyes. Odin then took a long drink from the Well and was, forever after, the wisest man on[[ Midgard]] and the wisest God on [[Asgard]].

===Names===
{{main|List of names of Odin}}
The[[ Norsemen]] gave Odin many nick-names; this was in the Norse [[skald]]ic tradition of [[heiti]] and [[kennings]], a poetic method of indirect reference, as in a riddle. The name Alföðr ("Allfather", "father of all") appears in [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s [[Younger Edda]]. (It probably originally denoted [[Tyr|Tiwaz]], as it fits the pattern of referring to [[Sky father|Sky Fathers]] as "father".) According to [[Bernhard Severin Ingemann]], Odin is known in [[Wendish mythology]] as ''Woda'' or ''Waidawut''.

==Persisting beliefs in Odin==
[[Image:Ed0030.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An 1893 depiction of Odin taking the dead [[Sinfjötli]] to [[Valhalla]] by Fredrik Sander.]][[Snorri Sturluson]] feels compelled to give a rational account of the Aesir in his preface. In this scenario, Snorri speculates that Odin and his peers were originally refugees from the [[Anatolia]]n city of [[Troy]], etymologizing ''Aesir'' as derived from the word [[Asia]]. Some scholars believe that Snorri's version of Norse mythology is an attempt to mould a more shamanistic tradition into a Nordic mythological cast. In any case, Snorri's writing (particularly in [[Heimskringla]]) tries to maintain an essentially scholastic neutrality. That Snorri was correct was one of the last of [[Thor Heyerdahl]]'s archeoanthropological theories (see [[Jakten på Odin|The search for Odin]]).

The spread of Christianity was slow in Scandinavia, and it worked its way downwards from the nobility. Among commoners, beliefs in Odin may have lingered for some time, and legends would be told until modern times. Currently, there are still isolated groups of worshipers, primarily in Iceland and Norway.

The last battle where Scandinavians attributed a victory to Odin was the [[Battle of Lena]] in [[1208]].<ref>[http://runeberg.org/img/sverhist/1/0325.5.png]</ref> The former Swedish king [[Sverker II of Sweden|Sverker]] had arrived with a large Danish army, and the Swedes led by their new king [[Eric X of Sweden|Eric]] were outnumbered. Odin then appeared riding on Sleipnir and he positioned himself in front of the Swedish battle formation. He led the Swedish charge and gave them victory.

The ''[[bagler]]-saga'', written in the thirteenth century concerning events in the first two decades of the thirteenth century, tells a story of a one-eyed rider with a broad-brimmed hat and a blue coat who asks a smith to shoe his horse. The suspicious smith asks where the stranger stayed during the previous night. The stranger mentions places so distant that the smith does not believe him. The stranger says that he has stayed for a long time in the north and taken part in many battles, but now he is going to Sweden. When the horse is shod, the rider mounts his horse and says "I am Odin" to the stunned smith, and rides away. The next day, the battle of Lena took place. The context of this tale in the saga is that a peace-treaty has been signed in Norway, and Odin, a god of war, no longer has a place there. ''[[Haakon IV of Norway|Håkon Håkonssons]] saga'', written in the 1260s, describes how, at some point in the 1230s, [[Skule Baardsson]] has the skald [[Snorri Sturluson]] compose a poem comparing one of Skule's enemies to Odin, describing them both as bringers of strife and disagreement. These episodes do not necessarily imply a continued belief in Odin as a god, but show clearly that his name was still widely known at this time. 

[[Scandinavian folklore]] also maintained a belief in Odin as the leader of the [[Wild Hunt]] (''Åsgårdsreia'' in Norwegian). His main objective seems to have been to track down and kill the forest dweller ''[[huldra]]n'' or ''skogsrået''. In these accounts, Odin was typically a lone hunter, save for his two wolves. Originally, he was armed with a javelin, but in later accounts this was sometimes changed to a [[rifle]] {{Fact|date=March 2007}}.


=== Woden's Day ===

[[Wednesday]] comes from the Old English ''Wēdnes dæg'' meaning ''Wōden's Day''. Wōden is the [[Wōden|Old English]] form of the Proto-Germanic [[*Wōdanaz]] just as ''Óðinn'' (''Odin'') is the Norse form.

== Toponyms with the name of Odin ==
{{main|List of places named after Odin}}
Many toponyms ("place names") in [[Northern Europe]] where Germanic Tribes existed contain the name of *Wodanaz (Norse Odin, West Germanic Woden).

==Modern age==
===Germanic neopaganism===
Odin, along with the other Germanic Gods and Goddesses, is recognized by [[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic neopagans]].  His Norse form is particularly acknowledged in [[Ásatrú]], the "faith in the [[Aesir]]", an officially recognized religion in [[Iceland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]].

===Modern popular culture===

[[Image:Ring16.jpg|right|thumb|Donner calls upon the storm clouds in this illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to Wagner's ''[[Das Rheingold]]''.]]
Odin appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera cycle, ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]''. This has led to many portrayals based on Wagner's interpretation, although some are closer to pre-Wagner models. Since Wagner's time, Thor has appeared, either as himself or as the namesake of characters, comic books, on television, in literature and in song lyrics.

Odin is also the deity worshipped by Ingeri in the [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s Oscar winning movie [[The Virgin Spring]].
