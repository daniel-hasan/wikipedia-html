'''XXL''' is a [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] girl pop group from [[Skopje]] who represented their native country in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000]] with the song "[[100% Te Ljubam]]" in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. Versions of the song were recorded in both Macedonian and English. Author [[John Kennedy O'Connor]] suggests in his ''The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History'' that the appearance and choreography had been emphasised to the exclusion of the vocals, which contributed to the low score. 

The group members were: [[Marija Nikolova]], [[Ivona Dzampovska]], [[Rosica Nikolovska]] and [[Verica Karanfilovska]].
