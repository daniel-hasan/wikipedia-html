{{Politics of Belgium}}
The '''2007 Belgian government formation''' followed the [[Belgian general election, 2007|general election]] of [[10 June]], [[2007]], and consisted of a period of negotiation in which the Flemish parties [[Open VLD]], [[CD&V]] and [[N-VA]] and the French-speaking parties [[Mouvement Réformateur|MR]], [[Front Démocratique des Francophones|FDF]] and [[CdH]] negotiated to form a government coalition. The negotiations were characterized by the disagreement between the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]- and [[French language|French]]-speaking parties about the need for and nature of a [[state reform in Belgium |constitutional reform]]. According to some, this political conflict could have led to a [[partition of Belgium]].<ref name="NYT">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/world/europe/21belgium.html?_r=1&ref=world&oref=slogin|title=Calls for a Breakup Grow Ever Louder}}</ref>

On [[November 6]], the formation talks became the longest in Belgian history. When the Parliament confirmed the formation of an interim Government, it had been 196 days since the Belgian people had voted out the previous coalition. It was the second longest formation period in European history, after the Dutch record of 208 days in [[1977]]. Talks were interrupted twice by the resignation of the ''[[formateur]]'', which left the political parties waiting for a new appointment by the [[Monarchy of Belgium|King]]. [[Guy Verhofstadt]] was appointed as [[formateur#informateur|mediator]] on [[December 3]], with the task not only of looking into the formation of a new government, but also of investigating how the government could handle certain urgent policy matters. Pressed by time, and some say by the King, on 19 December Verhofstadt concluded a deal on a Government and presented it to Parliament on 21 December; on the same day the Ministers took the oath of office. On Sunday 23 December the interim Government officially came into office when it was acknowledged by the lower house of Parliament with 97 votes in favour.

==Conventions==
After a [[Elections in Belgium|federal election]], the process of government formation starts. This process is based on [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] rather than written law and generally consists of two stages: information and formation. The [[Belgian monarchy|King]] consults the presidents of the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]] and the [[Belgian Senate|Senate]] and a number of prominent politicians in order to discuss the election results. Following these meetings, he appoints an ''[[informateur]]''.

The ''informateur'' has the task of exploring the various possibilities for a new federal government and for examining which parties can form a majority in the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Federal Parliament]]. He also meets with prominent people in various fields to hear their views on what policies the new federal government should pursue. The ''informateur'' then reports to the King and advises him about the appointment of a ''[[formateur]]''. However, the King can also decide to appoint a second ''informateur'' or appoint a royal mediator.

The ''formateur'', who is usually the prospective [[Prime Minister of Belgium|prime minister]] is appointed by the King on the basis of the informateur's report. The task of the ''formateur'' is to form a new [[Coalition government|government coalition]] and lead the negotiations about the government agreement and the composition of the government. If these negotiations succeed, the ''formateur'' presents a new federal government to the King.

==Election and immediate aftermath, 10 - 13 June==
{{main|Belgian general election, 2007}}

On [[June 10]], federal elections were held in Belgium.<ref name=DS-summary>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelId=DMA02082007_004|title=Sire, ik heb al bijna 100 dagen|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-06|accessdate=2007-09-12|language=Dutch}}</ref> In Flanders, the ruling purple coalition - the liberal Open VLD and the socialist coalition SP.a/SPIRIT - lost the most seats, while the electoral coalition CD&V/N-VA gained the most and the CD&V became the largest party in Flanders and Belgium. The CD&V/N-VA had an electoral program that emphasized the need for far-reaching state reform. [[Yves Leterme]] of the CD&V personally gained 800,000 votes and was considered to be the prospective prime minister. The SP.a, the party that lost the most seats, declared it would prepare itself for a role in the opposition, and would support state reform from that position.

In the French-speaking part of Belgium, the liberal party MR lost some seats but nevertheless became the largest party and replaced the socialist PS as the dominant party for the first time in history. Before he was appointed ''informateur'', [[Didier Reynders]], the MR party leader, indicated his preference for a coalition of Christian Democratic parties CD&V (Flanders) and CDH (Wallonia) and liberal parties MR (Wallonia) and Open VLD (Flanders)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/070613_Reynders_informateur|title=Eind juni klaar met informatieopdracht|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-06-13]]|accessdate=2007-06-13|language=Dutch}}</ref> and noted the fact that the PS was no longer the largest francophone party "a state reform in itself". Reynders also emphasized that the MR was the largest political party of the largest political group, as the combined number of seats of liberals in Flanders and French-speaking Belgium (MR + Open VLD) surpassed the combined number of seats of the Christian-democrats (CD&V + CDH).

==First information round, 13 June - 4 July==
On [[13 June]], [[2007]], King [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]] appointed Reynders as ''[[informateur]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/flandersnews.be/News/2.728/070613_informateur|title=King picks Mr Reynders as "informateur"|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-06-13]]|accessdate=2007-06-15|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/06/13/begium.coalition.reut/index.html|title=King appoints coalition adviser|publisher=CNN.com|date=[[2007-06-13]]|accessdate=2007-06-15|language=English}}</ref> The CD&V/N-VA caused a minor controversy when they immediately agreed with Reynders to stall constitutional reform until after the coinciding regional and European elections of 2009.

Reynders presented his 170-page final report, titled ''Develop, unite and protect'', to the king on [[4 July]] [[2007]]. It included a list of a record-breaking 450 people he talked as ''informateur'' and contained an inventory of their views.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/1.149213|title=Reynders legt koning zijn eindverslag voor|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-07-04]]|accessdate=2007-08-26|language=Dutch}}</ref> Reynders talked to, among others, [[Guy Quaden]], the Governor of the [[National Bank of Belgium]], [[Joaquin Almunia]], the [[European Commissioner for Economic & Financial Affairs]], [[Herman De Croo]], [[Anne-Marie Lizin]], the leaders of [[Trade union|trade unions]] and [[Employers' organization|employers' organisations]] and several senior [[Civil servant|civil servants]].

==Mediation round, 5 - 15 July==
Following the ''informateur's'' report, King [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]] on [[July 5]] asked former [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to accept a "mediation and negotiation assignment" in order to prepare the ground for the ''formateur'' and to look into the possibility of state reform.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:tv3UL0iAuH4J:www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp%3Fsubchannel_id%3D24%26story_id%3D41598+%22the+belgian+plumber+is+back%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=3&gl=uk&client=firefox-a|title=The Belgian plumber is back|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-07-05]]|accessdate=2007-07-06|language=English}}</ref> Dehaene reached the conclusion that only an orange-blue coalition with [[Christian Democratic and Flemish|CD&V]]/[[New-Flemish Alliance|N-VA]], [[Open Vld]], [[Reformist Movement|MR]] and [[Humanist Democratic Centre]] was viable.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/1.152030|title="Oranje-blauw is de enige mogelijkheid"|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-07-05]]|accessdate=2007-08-25|language=Dutch}}</ref>

Initially Dehaene stated there should be a ''formateur'' by [[July 21]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/1.149570|title="Graag een formateur tegen 21 juli"|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-07-05]]|accessdate=2007-08-27|language=Dutch}}</ref> the Belgian national holiday, but he ended his assignment prematurely on Sunday [[July 15]], one week before the [[July 21]] deadline. The former mediator said the four orange-blue parties would accept an invitation to coalition talks, but that this did not "mean all obstacles have been removed, far from it!"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/1.154351|title=Yves Leterme is aangeduid als formateur|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-07-15]]|accessdate=2007-08-27|language=Dutch}}</ref>

==First formation round, 15 July - 23 August==
===Leterme begins his mission===
The King then appointed [[Yves Leterme]] as ''[[formateur]]'' on Sunday [[July 15]] with the task of forming a new government coalition after [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] was relieved from his task as mediator and negotiator. On his first day as ''formateur'', Leterme met with outgoing [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] [[Guy Verhofstadt]] ([[Open Vld]]), the new [[President of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives|President]] of the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]], [[Herman Van Rompuy]] ([[CD&V]]), and the new [[President of the Belgian Senate|President]] of the [[Belgian Senate|Senate]], [[Armand De Decker]] ([[Reformist Movement|MR]]). The following day, Tuesday [[July 17]], Leterme received the presidents of the orange-blue parties: [[Jo Vandeurzen]] ([[CD&V]]), [[Bart De Wever]] ([[N-VA]]), [[Didier Reynders]] ([[MR]]), [[Bart Somers]] ([[Open Vld]]) and [[Joëlle Milquet]] ([[Humanist Democratic Centre]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/1.154551|title=Leterme gaat voor oranje-blauwe regering|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-07-16]]|accessdate=2007-08-28|language=Dutch}}</ref>

On Monday [[July 23]], ''Formateur'' Leterme presented his formation memorandum called ''The Power of People - Turning Challenges Into Opportunities Together''. This formation memorandum formed the basis for the real negotiations. It contained 80 pages and 9 chapters about various issues; however, it did not contain a separate chapter on constitutional reform and devolution.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/1.157310|title=Leterme: "Werkende mensen beter belonen"|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-07-23]]|accessdate=2007-08-28|language=Dutch}}</ref> In his memorandum, Leterme proposed lowering income taxes for those with low and median incomes, changing the unemployment benefits system, and expanding [[parental leave]]. He also wanted to keep several [[nuclear power]] stations open longer, build 1,500 additional prison cells, and establish an emergency budget for the [[FPS Justice Belgium|FPS Justice]] to hire more people. The ''formateur'' did not want a collective [[regularisation]] of [[Illegal immigration|illegal aliens]], but proposed the establishment criteria to allow regularisation in individual cases.

===Suspension of negotiations and consultations by the King===
Coalition talks at [[Castle of the Valley of the Duchess|Valley of the Duchess]] proceeded with much difficulty due to differences between Flemish and Francophone parties over constitutional reform, with communautary tensions reached a high on Thursday [[August 16]]. Negotiator for [[Humanist Democratic Centre]] [[Francis Delpérée]] described the situation with the following words: "Il y a un parfum de crise" ({{lang-en|There is a whiff of crisis}}). Formal negotiations were temporarily suspended on Friday [[August 17]], following a meeting between the King and the ''formateur'', to allow the King to conduct a series of political consultations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/flandersnews.be/News/070817_Albert_steps_in|title=Can King Albert solve the crisis?|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-17]]|accessdate=2007-08-26|language=English}}</ref> It was the third time since he was appointed ''formateur'' that Leterme reported to the King on the progress of the coalition talks. This move was heavily criticised by [[Johan Vande Lanotte]], the outgoing chairman of the Flemish socialist party [[Socialist Party – Different|SP.A]] and a professor in [[constitutional law]], who accused the parties involved in the coalition talks of forcing the King, who is supposed to remain impartial, to play a political role.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/1.169139|title="Koning wordt ingezet? Onaanvaardbaar!"|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-18]]|accessdate=2007-08-27|language=Dutch}}</ref>

That evening, the King received Jo Vandeurzen, the CD&V chairman, and Didier Reynders, the chairman of the MR. The next day the King received the chairpersons of the two other orange-blue parties, Bart Somers (Open Vld) and Joëlle Milquet (CDH), in order to attempt to defuse the tensions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/koning-wil-dat-leterme-onderhandelingen-hervat/site72-section24-article7241.html|title=Koning wil dat Leterme onderhandelingen hervat|publisher=Knack.be|date=[[2007-08-20]]|accessdate=2007-08-27|language=Dutch}}</ref> The King did not receive the chairmen of the N-VA and the [[Democratic Front of Francophones|FDF]]; however, Bart De Wever (N-VA) reportedly did receive an exploratory phone call from the [[Royal Palace of Brussels|Royal Palace]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/1.169206|title=Eerste gespreksronde van koning afgerond|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-18]]|accessdate=2007-08-27|language=Dutch}}</ref> During the weekend, there also were informal consultations between the ''formateur'' and all other parties involved in the coalition talks.

===Leterme resumes his mission and resigns===
On Sunday [[August 19]], the ''formateur'' Leterme was summoned by the King to discuss his consultations. Afterwards, the King asked him to resume his work as ''formateur'', but asked him to make new political contacts before resuming the negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/1.169439|title=Koning wil dat Leterme opdracht hervat|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-19]]|accessdate=2007-08-27|language=Dutch}}</ref> After further negotiations produced no results, Leterme resigned as ''formateur'' on [[August 23]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/leterme-stapt-op/site72-section24-article7376.html|title=Leterme stapt op|publisher=Knack.be|date=[[2007-08-23]]|accessdate=2007-08-23|language=Dutch}}</ref>

==Consultations by the King, 23 - 29 August==
Following [[Yves Leterme]]'s resignation, King Albert asked [[Didier Reynders]], the chairman of the Francophone liberal party [[Reformist Movement|MR]] and erstwhile ''[[informateur]]'', to seek a way out of the stalemate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/flandersnews.be/News/070824_reynders|title=Didier Reynders looking for mediator|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-24]]|accessdate=2007-08-26|language=English}}</ref> At first, the [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep]] (VRT) reported that [[Philippe Maystadt]] or [[Melchior Wathelet]] would probably take over, either as ''informateur'' or as royal mediator.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/flandersnews.be/News/070823_Leterme_towel|title=Mr Leterme throws in the towel|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-23]]|accessdate=2007-08-23|language=English}}</ref> The Flemish parties felt it was up to a a member of CDH to take an initiative; however, the CDH wanted a Flemish politician to be involved in the mediation efforts as well.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/flandersnews.be/News/070825_King|title=Who shall rid me of this stalemate?|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-25]]|accessdate=2007-08-25|language=English}}</ref> It was later reported that, according to observers, King Albert would probably ask [[Raymond Langendries]] (CDH) and [[Herman De Croo]] (Open Vld) to mediate.

On [[August 24]], a survey conducted by [[VTM]] showed that 45.8% of the 1300 Flemings polled wanted Flanders to be declared independent and that 54.2% opposed such an action.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF24082007_083|title=Kleine helft Vlamingen wil volgens enquête onafhankelijk Vlaanderen|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-08-24|accessdate=2007-08-31|language=Dutch}}</ref> The same survey showed that 58% of the respondents thought that the state reform is worth a crisis. Also, 72% could not understand the French-speaking opposition, and 53% thought that Milquet was to blame for the crisis and 15% thought that Leterme was to blame.

On [[August 25]], the King received [[Herman Van Rompuy]] (CD&V), President of the Chamber of Representatives and [[Armand De Decker]] (MR), President of the Senate,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=NI1GEIH7|title=Niemand wachtte op 'ervaren ontmijners'|publisher=[[De Standaard|De Standaard Online]]|date=[[2007-08-27]]|accessdate=2007-08-27|language=Dutch}}</ref> and on [[August 27]] the Royal Palace announced that the King would receive several [[Minister of State|ministers of State]] to discuss the political crisis.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF27082007_018|title=Ministers van Staat moeten koning bijstaan|publisher=[[De Standaard|De Standaard Online]]|date=[[2007-08-27]]|accessdate=2007-08-27|language=Dutch}}</ref> It was suggested by ''[[De Standaard]]'' that the King would not appoint the duo Langendries and De Croo because they were already named too much in the media which caused several politicians, such as [[Hendrik Bogaert]] (CD&V) and [[Bart de Wever]] (N-VA), to object or criticize such a choice. The Open VLD also held a press conference in which [[Bart Somers]] called the remarks about De Croo "inconvenient and unseen".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/070827_openvld_decroo|title="Uitspraken over De Croo ongepast en ongezien"|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-27]]|accessdate=2007-08-28|language=Dutch}}</ref> He also said that the problem of the [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] (BHV) electoral district should be tackled before all other issues, something regarded by the VRT as a direct criticism of Leterme because he did not once mention this problem when he was ''formateur''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/1.172944|title=Open VLD: "Nu eerst B-H-V op de tafel"|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-27]]|accessdate=2007-08-28|language=Dutch}}</ref> Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Karel De Gucht]], who is a negotiator for [[Open VLD]] in the coalition talks, described the government formation as "surrealistic" and added: "Ceci n'est pas une formation".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/nieuws/belgie/566207|title=Hof brengt geen rust|publisher=[[De Morgen|DeMorgen.be]]|date=[[2007-08-28]]|accessdate=2007-08-28|language=Dutch}}</ref>

[[Jean-Luc Dehaene]], [[Wilfried Martens]] and [[Philippe Moureaux]] were the first ministers of State to be received by the King. A photographer took a picture of a document Dehaene had with him when he arrived at the palace. The document reportedly stated that the state reform should not be an issue during the formation whereas the issue of [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] should be included in a coalition agreement, and that all [[Elections in Belgium|elections]] (federal, regional and European) should coincide in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/1.172843|title=Dehaene, Martens en Moureaux bij de koning|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-27]]|accessdate=2007-08-29|language=Dutch}}</ref> On Tuesday [[August 28]], King Albert received [[Willy Claes]] ([[Socialist Party – Different|SP.A]]), [[Gérard Deprez]] ([[Reformist Movement|MR]]), Jos Geysels ([[Green!|Groen!]]), [[Philippe Busquin]] ([[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|PS]]), Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb ([[Humanist Democratic Centre]]) and José Daras ([[Ecolo]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/070828_ministersvanstaat|title=Koning zet zijn consultatieronde voort|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-28]]|accessdate=2007-08-28|language=Dutch}}</ref> The following day, the King received three more ministers of State: [[Raymond Langendries]] ([[Humanist Democratic Centre]]), [[Herman De Croo]] ([[Open VLD]]) and [[Louis Michel]] ([[Reformist Movement|MR]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/070829_consultaties|title=Van Rompuy krijgt verkenningsopdracht|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-29]]|accessdate=2007-08-29|language=Dutch}}</ref>

===Van Rompuy begins his mission===
Following consultations with a number of ministers of State, King Albert received [[Herman Van Rompuy]] ([[Christian Democratic and Flemish|CD&V]]), the outgoing [[President of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives|President of the Chamber of Representatives]], and charged him with an exploratory mission in order to find a solution to the political crisis.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/flandersnews.be/News/070829_VanRompuy|title=King appoints mediator|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-08-29]]|accessdate=2007-08-29|language=English}}</ref> Van Rompuy was considered by Flemish and French-speaking parties and newspapers as a good choice.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/070830verkenningdag1|title=Eerste werkdag voor verkenner Van Rompuy|publisher=VRTnieuws.net|date=2007-08-30|accessdate=2007-08-31|language=Dutch}}</ref> He met on [[August 30]] with the presidents of several parties of the orange-blue coalition, in particular Jo Vandeurzen (CD&V), Bart de Wever (N-VA), Bart Somers (Open VLD) and Jöelle Milquet (CDH). On [[August 31]], he met with presidents Didier Reynders (MR), Olivier Maingain, (FDF)<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/070831verkenningdag2|title=Verkenner ontmoet Reynders en Maingain|publisher=VRTnieuws.net|date=2007-08-31|accessdate=2007-08-31|language=Dutch}}</ref> and [[Jean-Michel Javaux]] (Ecolo).<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelid=DMF31082007_080|title=Van Rompuy ontvangt Ecolo en MR|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-08-31|accessdate=2007-08-31|language=Dutch}}</ref> The content of the discussions is unknown as Van Rompuy wanted to communicate and negotiate discretely. ''De Standaard'' noted that Van Rompuy did not talk with a member of the PS, which could mean he wanted to reach the required two-thirds majority for constitutional reform with the ecologists (Ecolo on the French-speaking side) and rather that the PS.<ref name=DS1>{{cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelid=FC1GN7S9|title=Verkenner heeft PS nog niet op scherm|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-01|accessdate=2007-09-01|language=Dutch}}</ref>

Also on [[August 30]], the Walloon government held its first meeting since the summer holidays. [[Rudy Demotte]] (PS), the minister-president of the Walloon government criticized the long duration of the government formation and was skeptical about whether Van Rompuy would be able to solve the crisis.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek|title=Demotte: "Wij wachten op voorstellen"|publisher=VRTnieuws.net|date=2007-08-30|accessdate=2007-08-31|language=Dutch}}</ref> He also said that he was waiting for formation proposals. On [[August 31]], Milquet said institutional reform was less important than other topics and all French-speaking parties should formulate a common strategy. She also expressed her wish to replace the current "confrontational federalism" with a modern "cooperative federalism".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/070831milquet|title=Milquet: "Het institutionele is bijkomstig"|publisher=VRTnieuws.net|date=2007-08-31|accessdate=2007-09-01|language=Dutch}}</ref> [[Gérard Deprez]] (MCC, a part of the MR just like the FDF) criticized Maingain's (FDF) demand for the territorial expansion of the region of Brussels to several Flemish towns in return for the split of the BHV electoral district. Deprez said in ''La Libre Belgique'' that "Maingain acts like the Inquisition and excommunicates everyone that does not share his dogmas".<ref name=DS1/>

In an international press meeting, [[Vlaams Belang]] said that the formation crisis was an example of Belgium's failure to function as a state and that the time had come to declare Flemish independence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/070831vlaamsbelang|title="Een revolutionair moment zonder haat"|publisher=VRTnieuws.net|date=2007-08-31|accessdate=2007-08-31|language=Dutch}}</ref> On September 1, the Flemish newspaper ''De Standaard'' devoted an issue to the question of whether a Flemish secession was realistic and viable.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelid=JL1GN4F8|title=Is er leven na België?|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-01|accessdate=2007-09-01||language=Dutch}}</ref> On [[September 2]], during [[De Gordel]], an annual Flemish cycling event in the periphery of Brussels with a strong political undertone, [[Eric Van Rompuy]] (member of the CD&V and the brother of explorateur Herman) and Bart de Wever (N-VA) emphasized that this should be the last De Gordel in which the problems surrounding the BHV were not solved.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF02092007_017|title=Gordel in het teken van splitsing|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-02|accessdate=2007-09-02|language=Dutch}}</ref> Flemish minister Geert Bourgeois (N-VA) also stated that the Flemish majority in the newly elected parliament should urgently solve the problem unilaterally - i.e. without the consent of the French speaking parties and thus without any offers. Other politicians, such as Flemish minister-president [[Kris Peeters]] (CD&V) and federal minister of Internal Affairs [[Patrick Dewael]] (Open VLD) participated in the event, but did not comment on BHV. Prominent absentees were Yves Leterme and Guy Verhofstadt.

===Non-participation of Ecolo===
During this period, speculation about the participation of the French-speaking ecologist party Ecolo in the orange-blue coalition increased. Van Rompuy tried to obtain the support of Ecolo for the coalition to address left-winged CDH's desire to have a left-wing partner in the centre-right coalition.<ref name=DS2>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Krant/Tekst/Artikel.aspx?artikelId=501GPDKO|title=Coalitie met Ecolo afgevoerd|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-04|accessdate=2007-09-04|language=Dutch}}</ref>

On [[September 3]], Ecolo said that three conditions must be met for it to participate in a coalition.<ref name=DS2/> First, the party refused to join any coalition involving N-VA. A coalition without the N-VA would "respect the different communities" of Belgium. Second, [[Groen!]], the Flemish ecologists would have to be part of the coalition as well. Third, formation would have to be renegotiated to give the climate change a central place in the coalition programe.

CD&V/N-VA said Ecolo's demands could not "be taken seriously" because the CD&V without the N-VA was unthinkable.<ref name=DS2/> They also said the presence of N-VA was not a problem, but that the problem is the unreasonableness of the French-speaking parties to negotiate around the Flemish demands. Groen! said it was unwilling to participate in a coalition in which it is not necessary to obtain a majority in parliament. The need to undertake the negotiations again also meant the agreement between the partners about the prolonged existence of several nuclear power plants had to be reconsidered.

Herman Van Rompuy provided the King a first interim report on [[September 3]].<ref name=DS3/> Although his effort to include Ecolo in the coalition failed, Van Rompuy continued his mission despite a general decline in optimism about his likelihood of success of his mission steeply declined.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF06092007_081|title=Optimisme over Van Rompuy daalt|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-06|accessdate=2007-09-07|language=Dutch}}</ref> He formulated several proposals that he suggested to the orange-blue parties.<ref name=DS3>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF07092007_009|title=Van Rompuy maandag naar paleis voor tussentijds verslag|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-07|accessdate=2007-09-07|language=Dutch}}</ref> On [[10 September]], Van Rompuy provided the King with a second "interim" report - something that indicated his work would be prolonged.

===Plenary session of the Flemish parliament===
[[Filip Dewinter]] of the [[Flemish Interest]] proposed to have an earlier plenary session in the Flemish parliament to discuss the communtarian crisis, a request that was granted. On [[September 10]], under the eyes of the international media, he proposed in the plenary session to prepare a plan for an independent Flanders and to hold a referendum on independence.<ref name=DS7>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF10092007_060&word=vlaams+parlement|title=Geen steun voor referendum|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-10|accessdate=2007-09-14|language=Dutch}}</ref> He said that the Flemish resolutions agreed upon in the Flemish parliament in 1999 (that supported a far-reaching devolution of powers) were a breaking point. He also called Belgium "a country that is terminally ill" and that it was time to say "bye bye Belgium".

Other parties vehemently opposed the course of action, proposed by Dewinter.<ref name=DS7/> For instance, Ludwig Caluwé (CD&V) said that the Flemish Interest did not vote for the resolutions in 1999. He added that more power to the regions does not imply the end of inter-regional solidarity. Patrcia Ceysens (Open VLD) said that "the country is not going to split, the parliament is not going to declare independence."

===Leterme's controversial remark===
In Karrewiet, a Flemish news program for children, Leterme was interviewed. He said "We could make sure that they [French-speaking Belgium] could build schools more cheaply. That would be beneficial for students from Wallonia and Brussels. Maybe if we could agree about that, French-speakers would be willing to negotiate about our demands."<ref name=DS4>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF12092007_017|title=Ketnet stort zich op regeringsonderhandelingen|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-12|accessdate=2007-09-12|language=Dutch}}</ref>

French-speaking politicians and the French-speaking media were enraged about Leterme's remark. [[Marie Arena]] (PS) and [[Joëlle Milquet]] (CDH) interpreted Leterme's remark as making the Flemish youth believe Walloon parties are only interested in money and could be bribed. They also said that the lower [[VAT]] for building schools was already agreed upon in a six-year old accord which was still not executed. Milquet said that Leterme should refrain from giving interviews.

[[Wilfried Martens]] (CD&V) criticized the French-speaking side of the country for misinterpreting a "sign of goodwill" made by Leterme. [[Karel de Gucht]] (Open VLD) said that they do not have a veto right about which Fleming can become prime minister.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=B19092321070914|title=De Gucht vindt Waals veto tegen Leterme onaanvaardbaar|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-14|accessdate=2007-09-14|language=Dutch}}</ref> He also added that they overreacted. "Who takes away his position as prime minister, turns him into a political martyr. I don't feel like competing against a political martyr during the next election. Why shouldn't he be allowed to speak? The campaign waged against him...is unacceptable."

===Criticism on the duration of negotations===
[[Guy Quaden]], president of the [[National Bank of Belgium]], warned on [[September 13]] that the long duration of negotiations were not without a price as much-needed measures in the domains of budget, competition and employment are still not taken.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=B19070009070913&|title=Guy Quaden haalt uit naar politiek|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-13|accessdate=2007-09-14|language=Dutch}}</ref> Didier Reynders said that Quaden should occupy himself with "interest rates, not politics".<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF13092007_090|title=Uiteenlopende reacties van MR en CDH|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-13|accessdate=2007-09-14|language=Dutch}}</ref> CDH agreed with Quaden. CD&V and Open-VLD also agreed, but said that a good agreement was better than a quick but bad agreement.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF13092007_058|title=CD&V en Open VLD benadrukken inhoud regeerakkoord|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-13|accessdate=2007-09-14|language=Dutch}}</ref>

[[Elio Di Rupo]], the president of the PS, sharply criticized the duration of the negotiations.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelid=KP1HBOHH|title='Met ons erbij was het niet zo ontspoord'|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-15|accessdate=2007-09-15|lenguage=Dutch}}</ref> "Three months on from the election, they're not even sitting around the negotation table. This has never happened before". He continued, "If we would have participated in the talks, negotations would never have been derailed". Di Rupo also called the talks a "guerilla war" rather than negotiations.

Belgian [[Minister of State]] [[Louis Tobback]] and [[Trends]] journalist [[Geert Noels]] blamed the [[Euro]] for allowing the formation talks to last this long. Since the Belgian government is no longer in charge of its own [[monetary policy]], the value of the currency will not be affected by this political crisis, so there is no monetary incentive to force the formation partners to find a quick solution.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.libertarian.be/2007/08/european-union-brought-belgium-on-edge.html|title='The Euro brought Belgium on the Edge of the Abyss'|publisher=Libertarian.be|date=2007-08-27|accessdate=2007-09-28|language=English}}</ref>

===No participation of the PS===
On August 31, the magazine ''Knack'' reported that talks were taking place to include the [[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|PS]] in a tripartite coalition. This was denied by Di Rupo, whilst Didier Reynders absolutely ruled out the MR joining a coalition with the PS.<ref>>{{citenews|title=Knack et Di Rupo « négocient » sur le net|publisher=Le Soir|date=2007-08-31|accessdate=2007-12-01|language=French}}</ref> Rumours continued until September 7 when Van Rompuy denied any negotations on extending the Orange-Blue coalition to include the PS.<ref>>{{citenews|url=http://www.rtlinfo.be/news/article/31322/0/?&article_comment_page=5|title=Van Rompuy nie toute tentative d'élargir l'orange bleue au PS|publisher=RTL Group|date=2007-09-07|accessdate=2007-12-01|language=French}}</ref>

On [[September 14]], [[Jean-Jacques Viseur]] (CDH), mayor of Charleroi, said that it was wrong to keep the socialists out of the government.<ref name=DS10>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=RQ1HCM2G&word=PS|title=Verkenner stuurde Dehaene naar PS|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-17|accessdate=2007-09-18|language=Dutch}}</ref> On [[September 16]], Open VLD senator [[Patrik Vankrunkelsven]] agreed and openly questioned his party's opposition to the participation of the socialists in government. He said that as long as the PS is an opposition party, the MR will not make any concessions on state reform.

On [[September 17]], it was revealed that Van Rompuy had used [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to contact the PS secretly a week earlier.<ref name=DS10/> Dehaene met Elio Di Rupo and enquired as to whether the PS would support some parts of a state reform from opposition, as the [[Socialist Party – Different|SP.a]] has said it will. Di Rupo declined to support reforms as long as the PS is not a member of the coalition.

===Larger role for Van Rompuy===
Van Rompuy's discretion was appreciated in French-speaking Belgium.<ref name=DS6>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=J11H9IAG|title=Franstaligen willen bredere rol Van Rompuy|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-14|accessdate=2007-09-14|language=Dutch}}</ref> MR and CDH proposed that Van Rompuy would include issues such as the federal budget, justice and social-economic matters in his exploratory mandate. Until then, Van Rompuy only tried to determine communatarian issues ranging from the BHV to the [[regionalisation]] of power. Van Rompuy's spokesman said that such a widening of his mandate was not being considered.

Open VLD and CD&V supported the French-speaking proposal.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelid=DMF14092007_037|title=Open VLD: 'geen kwaad om ook andere thema's aan te snijden'|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-14|accessdate=2007-09-14|language=Dutch}}</ref> CD&V added that a widening of his role can only happen if Van Rompuy remains an explorer, does not become a ''formateur'' and does not negotiate.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelid=DMF14092007_059|title=CD&V: 'Voorwaarden aan uitbreiding rol verkenner'|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-14|accessdate=2007-09-14|language=Dutch}}</ref> Jo Vandeurzen (CD&V) also emphasized that Leterme remains the prime minister designate. VLD responded that they did not have any intention to undermine the position of Leterme.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.standaard.be/Krant/Tekst/Artikel.aspx?artikelId=H21HBMFG&date=20070915&demo=False|title='Wij ondermijnen Leterme niet'|publisher=De Standaard|date=2007-09-15|accessdate=2007-09-15|language=Dutch}}</ref>

==Second formation round, 29 September – 1 December==
On [[September 29]], Herman Van Rompuy presented his final report to the King. Afterwards, the Royal Palace announced that King [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]] relieved him of his exploratory mission. Later that day, King Albert II again appointed [[Yves Leterme]] as ''[[formateur]]''.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/070929_Koning_Leterme_en_verkenner|title=Koning benoemt Leterme opnieuw als formateur|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=2007-09-29|accessdate=2007-09-29|language=Dutch}}</ref> On Friday, [[5 October]], Leterme provided the King his first interim report, after which negotiations with all orange-blue parties began.

===Voting about Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde===
Talks for a new government were interrupted on [[November 7]], with agreements about everything not related to strengthening [[Flanders]], [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]]; or to [[monetary]] affairs. Chairman [[Pieter De Crem]] ([[Christian Democratic and Flemish]]) of the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Belgian Chamber]] [[Belgian Chamber Committee on the Interior|Committee on the Interior]] had decided to go ahead with a vote on the split of electoral district [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]]. The six Francophone committee members walked out in protest. The 11 Dutch-speaking members continued the meeting, and voted in favour of the split, with only [[Tinne Van der Straeten]] ([[Green!]]) abstaining.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/071107_kamercommissie|title=Kamercommissie keurt splitsing BHV goed|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-11-07]]|accessdate=2007-11-07|language=Dutch}}</ref>

The Francophone parties subsequently invoked a procedure known as the ''conflict of interest'' ({{lang-nl|belangenconflict}}, {{lang-fr|conflit d'intérêt}}), a procedure whereby a regional parliament can indicate that it feels that the interests of the region are hurt by the decision of another political body in Belgium, in this case the Belgian Chamber Committee on the Interior.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/071107_franstaligen|title=Franstaligen roepen een belangenconflict in|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-11-07]]|accessdate=2007-11-07|language=Dutch}}</ref> The Parliament of the [[French Community of Belgium]] approved the procedure on [[November 9]], with three members of the [[National Front (Belgium)|National Front]] abstaining. This suspends a decision about Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde for a period of 60 days.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/071109_Formatie_Belangenconflict_NVA|title=Parlement heeft belangenconflict ingeroepen|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-11-09]]|accessdate=2007-11-09|language=Dutch}}</ref>

===The King intervenes===
On [[November 9]], King Albert II intervened. He took state reform off the agenda for the negotiations, and instructed the chairmen of the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]] and the [[Belgian Senate|Senate]] to "start a dialogue" on the matter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/071108_Formatie_BHV_DayAfter|title=Koning wil dat Leterme opdracht voortzet|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-11-08]]|accessdate=2007-11-09|language=Dutch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nrc.nl/buitenland/article815244.ece/Belgische_koning__formatie_Leterme_snel_afronden|title=Belgische koning: formatie Leterme snel afronden|publisher=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|date=[[2007-11-09]]|accessdate=2007-11-09|language=Dutch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF08112007_085&kanaalid=433#|title=Mededeling van Het Paleis|publisher=[[De Standaard|De Standaard Online]]|date=[[2007-11-08]]|accessdate=2007-11-10|language=Dutch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/article.phtml?id=10&subid=90&art_id=382062|title=Le communiqué du Palais|publisher=[[La Libre Belgique|LaLibre.be]]|date=[[2007-11-09]]|accessdate=2007-11-10|language=French}}</ref> In a joint statement, the parties CD&V and N-VA rejected the decision, and stated they would only join a government if there were "guarantees for big state reform."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/071109_NVA_bijeen|title="Geen regering zonder staatshervorming"|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-11-09]]|accessdate=2007-11-09|language=Dutch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/12/europe/EU-POL-Belgium-Government.php|title=Belgian political crisis: king meets with political leaders in search for government coalition|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[2007-11-12]]|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/11/europe/EU-POL-Belgium-Government.php|title=Belgium's largest party objects to initiative to end stalemate in government talks|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[2007-11-11]]|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref>

On [[November 12]], the King met with the chairmen of the socialist parties SP.A and PS, and the green parties Green! and Ecolo, who would be part of the opposition if the orange-blue government were to be formed. The purpose of the meeting was to see whether the parties were willing to take part in a Committee of Wise Men that would examine the possibilities for state reform.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ad.nl/buitenland/article1818767.ece|title=Koning op de knieën voor steun Oranje-Blauw|publisher=Algemeen Dagblad|date=[[2007-11-12]]|accessdate=2007-11-13|language=Dutch}}</ref> SP.A chairwoman [[Caroline Gennez]] declined the offer, saying it was not the job of her party to make an orange-blue government possible.<ref name="Gennez">{{cite web|url=http://www.s-p-a.be/nationaal/nieuws/nieuwsitem.asp?iID=14004|title=Concrete voorstellen over staatshervorming, graag|publisher=SP.A|date=[[2007-11-12]]|accessdate=2007-11-13|language=Dutch}}</ref> She called the Council of Wise Men "not a way towards a solution to state reform, but a getaway route to nowhere."<ref name="Gennez"/> [[Mieke Vogels]], chairwoman of Green!, stated her party would not give the new government a "blank check" for state reform.<ref name="Committee">{{cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF12112007_028&kanaalid=433|title=Oppositie loopt niet warm voor 'Comité van Wijzen'|publisher=De Standaard|date=[[2007-11-12]]|accessdate=2007-11-13|language=Dutch}}</ref> Chairman [[Elio di Rupo]] of the PS said he wanted to see the "menu" of the Committee of Wise Men first; "without a serious menu, [the Committee of Wise Men] risks becoming a talking shop."<ref name="Committee"/>
[[Image:Herman Van Rompuy and Armand De Decker.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Armand De Decker]] and [[Herman Van Rompuy]] surrounded by the press on the [[King's Feast]].]]
The next day, the King met with the chairmen of CD&V, CDH, Open VLD and MR, and with [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]] chairman [[Herman Van Rompuy]] (CD&V) and [[Belgian Senate|Senate]] chairman [[Armand De Decker]] (MR), to discuss ways to start dialogue on state reform.<ref name="koningpraat">{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/071113_Formatie_koningpraat|title=Paleis blijft positief over formatie|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=[[2007-11-13]]|accessdate=2007-11-13|language=Dutch}}</ref>

CD&V's partner party in the negotiations, N-VA, was not invited, neither was [[Democratic Front of Francophones|FDF]], which is affiliated with MR. The chairmen of right-wing parties Flemish Interest, List Dedecker and FN - who would be in opposition if the orange-blue government was to be formed - were not invited either.

One of the instructions the King had given to De Decker and Van Rompuy, was to find a way to start a dialogue on state reform. In an interview with [[RTBF]] on [[November 14]], Armand De Decker said he and Karel Van Rompuy wanted to establish a National Committee of Dialogue ({{lang-fr|Collège national pour le dialogue}}, {{lang-nl|Nationaal College van Dialoog}}). The committee would consist of prominent politicians of the christian-democratic, liberal, socialist and green parties, who together have a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rtbf.be/info/belgique/ARTICLE_133706|title=Un Collège national pour le dialogue entre les communautés|publisher=RTBF|date=2007-11-14|accessdate=2007-11-14|language=French}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/989/Binnenland/article/detail/52324/2007/11/14/College-van-dialoog-moet-zich-buigen-over-toekomst-Belgi.dhtml|title='College van dialoog' moet zich buigen over toekomst België|publisher=De Morgen|date=2007-11-14|accessdate=2007-11-15|language=Dutch}}</ref> Van Rompuy stated that nothing had been agreed upon, and that De Decker had spoken in his own name.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/071114_Formatie|title="De Decker sprak in hoogst persoonlijke naam"|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|date=2007-11-14|accessdate=2007-11-15|language=Dutch}}</ref>

===Negotiations at a standstill===
While the King is trying to find a new way to hold negotiations between the parties involved, the negotations themselves have come to a standstill. The parties have not spoken with each other since [[November 8]], and the Francophone parties have stated that they would only rejoin the negotiating table if the Flemish parties apologize for the Chamber Committee on the Interior vote on Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde.<ref name="koningpraat"/>

Several politicians had suggested a tripartite government of liberal, christian-democratic and socialist parties.<ref>Such a government had been suggested by i.a. [[Open VLD]] [[Belgian Senate|senator]] [[Patrik Vankrunkelsven]] on [[September 15]], [[2007]] in ''[[Le Soir]]'' and by Van Krunkelsven and a [[Wallonia|Walloon]] Minister President [[Rudy Demotte]] in ''[[De Zevende Dag]]'' on [[September 16]], [[2007]].

Bruno De Wever, professor at the [[Ghent University]] and brother of [[New-Flemish Alliance|N-VA]] chairman [[Bart De Wever]] on [[17 November]] stated on Kanaal Z, a [[Flanders|Flemish]] business [[television channel]], that "a periphery around [[Brussels]] where 80% speaks [[French language|French]], is not Flemish."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/071117_BHV_Franstaligen|title="Rand maakt geen deel uit van Vlaanderen"|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|Vrtnieuws.net]]|date=[[2007-11-17]]|accessdate=2007-11-17|language=Dutch}}</ref> He said that a compromise should be worked with an increase in social and economic competences for Flanders in exchange for the expansion of the bilingual [[Brussels-Capital Region]]. Bruno De Wever also said that it is hard to continue to call a municipality where a large majority of the population speaks French a Flemish municipality.

===Mayors of Kraainem, Linkebeek and Wezembeek-Oppem===
[[Flanders|Flemish]] Interior Minister [[Marino Keulen]] ([[Open VLD|Open VLD]]) announced on [[November 14]] that he had decided not to appoint the [[French language|French]]-speaking mayors of [[Kraainem]], [[Linkebeek]] and [[Wezembeek-Oppem]], three [[municipalities with linguistic facilities]] in the Flemish Periphery of [[Brussels]], because they had sent letters of convocation (letters calling citizens to vote and informing them where their polling station is) in French for the [[Belgian municipal elections, 2006|2006 municipal elections]] and the [[Belgian general election, 2007|2007 federal election]]. This was a violation of rules established by the [[Flemish Government]]. The three mayors are all members of the [[Democratic Front of Francophones|FDF]]. Marino Keulen will ask the municipal councils of these municipalities to nominate a new mayor for appointment.<ref name="mayors">{{cite news|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/vrtnieuws.net/nieuws/politiek/071114_Rand_Burgemeesters|title=Drie "randburgemeesters" niet benoemd|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|Vrtnieuws.net]]|date=[[2007-11-14]]|accessdate=2007-11-15|language=Dutch}}</ref>

The three mayors also violated [[Language legislation in Belgium|language legislation]] by allowing French to be spoken during the meetings of the municipal councils of Kraainem, Linkebeek and Wezembeek-Oppem on Monday [[22 October]] [[2007]], which Minister Marino Keulen described as a provocation.<ref name="mayors"/>

[[Myriam Delacroix-Rolin]] ([[Humanist Democratic Centre|CDH]]), the Mayor of [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]], another municipality with linguistic facilities, will be appointed; her municipality had only sent letters of convocation in French for the 2006 municipal elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://destandaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF14112007_089|title=Nieuwe slag voor formatie|publisher=[[De Standaard|De Standaard Online]]|date=[[2007-11-14]]|accessdate=2007-11-15|language=Dutch}}</ref>

The Francophone political parties put forth a united declaration in the Walloon parliament on [[November 16]], calling the act by Flemish minister Keulen "a rejection of democracy." The appointment of the mayors should be seen in the broader perspective of the Brussels' periphery, the declaration stated.<ref>{{cite news | title = Franstaligen willen splitsing B-H-V ongedaan maken | url = http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/1341/Formatie/article/detail/52960/2007/11/16/Franstaligen-willen-splitsing-B-H-V-ongedaan-maken.dhtml | publisher = De Morgen | date = [[2007-11-16]]}}</ref> Damien Thiery, the Mayor of Linkebeek, announced the following day that he will again be presented for appointment as Mayor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://destandaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF17112007_085|title=Burgemeester Linkebeek zal zich opnieuw kandidaat stellen|publisher=[[De Standaard|De Standaard Online]]|date=[[2007-11-17]]|accessdate=2007-11-18|language=Dutch}}</ref>

===Resignation of Leterme===
A confused week of negotiations started on [[26 November]] [[2007]] with an agreement proposed by Yves Leterme and immediately accepted by CDH, MR, FDF and OpenVLD. Ironically, his own close partner NV/A did not accept the agreement, requesting more concessions for government reforms in the agreement instead; this led to a week of back and forth statements and interviews in the media.

On [[30 November]] [[2007]], Leterme made a final proposal with three questions; he requested positive responses to all questions by all parties in order to continue negotations.<ref name="Qui pour succeder">{{cite web|url=http://www.lesoir.be/actualite/belgique/les-reponses-mr-et-open-vld-2007-12-01-564317.shtml|title=Qui pour succéder à Leterme ?|date=[[2007-12-02]]|accessdate = 2007-12-27}}</ref> The questions were:
* Are all topics admissible to be discussed in the special commission for state reform?
* Will the regions be given more leeway in regulating business tax rates?
* Can law proposals for state reform be adopted by any constitutional two-thirds majority, without extra conditions, as well?<ref>Most likely referring to a two-thirds majority consisting of the parties of government - which was expected to have a simple majority in both language groups - with additional parties from only one language group.</ref>

The French-speaking party CDH gave no response to all three questions, and FDF did not accept the transfer of business tax regulations to the regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/MangainsStatementOnLetermes3Questions|title=Mangain's Statement On Leterme's 3 Questions| date = [[2007-12-01]] | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}</ref> Faced with this defeat, on [[1 December]] [[2007]] Leterme gave his resignation as ''formateur'' to the King, which the King accepted.<ref>{{cite news | title = Belgium's PM hopeful gives up efforts to form government | url = http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jxQKb3BNsKSj5hKhwTpYIGC4Rhmw | date = [[2007-12-01]] | accessdate = 2007-12-01}}</ref>

==Consultations by the King, 1 - 3 December==
[[Guy Verhofstadt]], who remains the head of government, was received by the King on [[1 December]].<ref name="Qui pour succeder"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtbf.be/info/belgique/ARTICLE_139175|title=Stop ou encore pour Guy Verhofstadt?}}</ref> He was one of many politicians who could be asked by the King to try to seek a new consensus between Dutch and French-speaking parties. After visiting the royal palace twice on 3 December, prime minister Verhofstadt was nominated ''[[formateur#informateur|informateur]]'' by the King, although with a smaller role than an ''informateur'' usually plays. Verhofstadt stated he was hesitant at first to accept the job.<ref>{{cite news | title = Crisis mission for Belgian leader | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7126381.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = [[2007-12-04]] | accessdate = 2007-12-04}}</ref>

==Second information round, 4 – 17 December==
[[Image:Reynders Verhoofdstadt.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Didier Reynders]] and [[Guy Verhofstadt]]]]
Verhofstadt started his information round on [[December 4]], talking to the chairmen of the [[Belgian Senate]] and
[[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]], Herman Van Rompuy and Armand De Decker respectively. The chairman have already been given the task by the Belgian King to organize a convention on constitutional reform, with members from the Belgian political class. Verhofstadt also met with the leaders of the largest political parties, followed by the smaller political parties on [[December 5]]. The main political parties have not ruled out a tripartite coalition, although Verhofstadt's own party, Open VLD, has come out against such arrangement.<ref>{{cite news | title = Open Vld verzet zich tegen klassieke tripartite | url = http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/1341/Formatie/article/detail/94931/2007/12/06/Open-Vld-verzet-zich-tegen-klassieke-tripartite.dhtml | publisher = De Morgen | date = [[2007-12-06]] | accessdate = 2007-12-06}}</ref> [[List Dedecker]] has declared it will not support Verhofstadt's endeavours, and wants to see new elections instead.

There were several difficulties associated with forming a temporary government. On the French-speaking side, the MR opposed a government that included all French-speaking parties. On the Flemish side, the VLD opposed the participation of the SP.a, the Flemish socialist party.

==Forming interim government, 17 December – 23 December==
{{main|Verhofstadt III}}

On [[17 December]], [[Guy Verhofstadt]] was asked by the King to start the formation of an "interim government" that will last until [[23 March]], [[2008]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Verhofstadt to form interim government | url = http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/flandersnews.be/News/071217_interim_govt | publisher = VRT Nieuws | date = [[2007-12-17]] | accessdate = 2007-12-17}}</ref>
On the morning of [[18 December]], Verhofstadt met with [[cdH]] head [[Joëlle Milquet]] and offered the party a part in an interim Government through a person outside the party, a move that confirmed the refusal by [[Reformist Movement|MR]] to a full participation of cdH in the interim Government. In reaction, [[cdH]] called a party meeting, soon followed by a press conference where cdH announced its withdrawal from formation talks. The move was followed in the afternoon by a call for francophone unity by [[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|PS]] head [[Elio di Rupo]] that announced it will not take part in a Government without [[cdH]]. Later in the afternoon, [[CD&V]] head [[Jo Vandeurzen]] and [[Yves Leterme]] requested a meeting with Verhofstadt where they call for an inclusion of [[cdH]] in the coalition. [[Reformist Movement|MR]] thus remained the only party opposing a deal that would include [[cdH]], Verhofstadt decided to meet with Milquet again in the evening and bring back his morning proposal of a participation of [[cdH]] in the Government through an external actor, but added that this Minister would have the rank though not the title of Deputy Prime Minister. Milquet and her party met and agreed on this proposal.<ref>{{cite news | title = Une majorité au bout de la nuit. | url = http://www.lesoir.be/actualite/belgique/politique-guy-verhofstadt-2007-12-19-567381.shtml | publisher = Le Soir | date = [[2007-12-19]] | accessdate = 2007-12-19}}</ref>

In the early hours of [[19 December]], [[Belga News Agency]] announced a deal had been struck by all parties and an interim Government was to be formed by 21 December and approved by Parliament by 23 December.<ref>{{cite news | title = Le cdH dit oui au gouvernement intérimaire | url = http://www.rtlinfo.be/news/article/72664/--Le+cdH+dit+oui+au+gouvernement+int%C3%A9rimaire | publisher = RTLinfo | date = [[2007-12-19]] | accessdate = 2007-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Het cdH zegt ja - interimregering tegen eind van de week | url = http://www.knack.be/belga/politiek/het-cdh-zegt-ja---interimregering-tegen-eind-van-de-week/site78-section3-article30180.html | publisher = Knack | date = [[2007-12-19]] | accessdate = 2007-12-19}}</ref> Later in the day, it was confirmed Guy Verhofstadt would address the Parliament on 21 December with a General Policy Declaration. It was also announced the legal 48-hour delay following the declaration would lead the Parliament to vote its confidence to the interim Government on 23 December.<ref>{{cite news | title = Interimregering krijgt vorm | url = http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/1341/Formatie/article/detail/109632/2007/12/19/Interimregering-krijgt-vorm.dhtml | publisher = De Morgen | date = [[2007-12-19]] | accessdate = 2007-12-20}}</ref> The interim Government officially came into office when it was acknowledged by the lower house of Parliament with 97 votes in favour on Sunday 23 December 2007.
