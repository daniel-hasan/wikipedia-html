'''''Descent: FreeSpace &mdash; The Great War''''' is a 1998 [[Space combat simulator|space combat simulation]] [[IBM PC compatible]] [[Personal computer game|computer game]] developed by [[Volition, Inc.]] when it was split off from [[Parallax Software]]. Published by [[Interplay Entertainment]], it is also known as '''''Conflict: FreeSpace &mdash; The Great War''''' in [[Europe]]. In 2001, it was [[Porting|ported]] to the [[Amiga]] platform as '''''FreeSpace &mdash; The Great War''''' by [[Hyperion Entertainment]].

The story has the player taking up the role of a human pilot in the Galactic Terran Alliance as it engages in war with the [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] Vasudan empire. Their feud is interrupted by the enigmatic Shivans who slaughter anyone in their sights. Putting aside their differences, the humans and Vasudans form an alliance, and the player is assigned to missions to stop the Shivan's [[Genocide|genocidal]] advance. Featuring huge [[capital ship]]s which explode spectacularly on destruction, the player pilots a [[starfighter]] and fights massive battles alongside competent [[Wingman|wingmen]] amongst the stars to determine the fate of two races.

''Descent: FreeSpace'' was well received as a single player space simulation which integrated all the desired features of its genre, but its multiplayer mode was plagued by lag and inaccurate statistic tracking. Its expansion, '''''Silent Threat''''' which comprised of additional missions was also released in 1998. The sequel ''[[FreeSpace 2]]'' was released a year later in 1999.

==Gameplay==
''Descent: FreeSpace &mdash; The Great War'' (hereafter simply called ''FreeSpace'') puts the player in a [[starfighter]] flying out on missions to destroy or protect certain targets. It has been categorized more as a simulator for its many controls and commands than an arcade game.<ref name="alamode" /> Its flight model is however simple, akin to that of the game, ''[[Star Wars: TIE Fighter|TIE Fighter]]'' though it incorporates a bit of [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] such as precise collision physics.<ref name="forcegood" /><ref name="gamewant" /> In the single player mode, the player flies through a series of missions in a [[wikt:campaign|campaign]].

[[Image:FS Asteroids Combat.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|The HUD-only interface of ''FreeSpace'']]Before flying a mission, the player goes through a briefing which details the background information and objectives. Ships and weapons can also be selected at this stage, which adds an element of strategy to the missions.<ref name="sharky" /> The main view when flying, is a [[First-person shooter|first-person-look]] from within the [[cockpit]], but the only visible interface is that of the [[head-up display]] (HUD). The player can customize the HUD by changing its color, or toggling the information displays.<ref name="allgame" /><ref name="combat" />

Missions must be successfully completed for the campaign to advance.<ref name="agdb" />  A mission however can be considered successful if only a few of the primary objectives are completed.<ref name="forcegood" /> Results of a mission can be persistent, an enemy capital ship allowed to flee may turn up in a later mission.<ref name="skoar" /> Completed missions can be replayed on the in-game mission simulator.<ref name="agdb" /> Training missions are mixed in with the regular missions (and can be skipped), gradually introducing players to advanced commands and techniques as more sophisticated missions come up next.<ref name="agdb" /><ref name="combat" /> The game has been said to be well playable with the keyboard alone, or together with a mouse or joystick.<ref name="sharky" /><ref name="gameover" />

The game features multiplayer matches over [[local area network]] (LAN) or [[Internet|online]]. The modes offered are for players to band together to complete [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative missions]], or to split up into teams and eliminate the other team.<ref name="gamespot" /> [[Voice chat]] is available, though advised to be only used on [[broadband]] or LAN.<ref name="gamerevo" /> Online gameplay was free over the services offered by Parallax Online, which also kept track of players' statistics and rankings.<ref name="gameover" />

==Plot and setting==
''FreeSpace'' takes place in a fictional future where humans have discovered how to travel long distances by jumping into [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|subspace]], and have spread among the stars as the Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA).<ref>{{cite web

The player initially flies several combat missions against the Vasudans, before encountering the Shivan advance elements who indiscriminately attacks the two races.

</ref> Volition also used the term "FreeSpace" in the game to initially describe what became later known as subspace.<ref name="bibintro" /> The game was conceived by Adam Pletcher to create the best space simulator ever, with all the features of space simulator games his team had found to be fun. Their primary inspirations, the games ''[[Star Wars: TIE Fighter|TIE Fighter]]'' and ''[[Wing Commander (video game)|Wing Commander]]'' made their way into the game's flight model,<ref name="pletcher" /> along with the influence of historical [[World War II|WWII]] [[dogfight]]s. Themes from the fiction of [[Star Wars]], [[Space: Above and Beyond]], and [[Ender's Game]] form a part in shaping the background and story of the ''FreeSpace'' world. The chaotic battles between masses of ships commonly found in science-fiction [[anime]] became one of the features of ''FreeSpace''.<ref>{{cite web

Initially staffed with a crew of five, the project grew to encompass 17 people.<ref name="danint" /> The game's code was built from scratch.

Most of the reviewers glossed over the game's story but a few found it lacking the depth needed to captivate the player.<ref name="allgame" /><ref name="combat" /> There are suggestions that the game would have been much better if the player had a greater obvious role in controlling the outcome of the story. Without this impetus, the reviewers found themselves simply playing a "very sweet looking arcade title",<ref name="combat" /> and felt detached from their wingmen and environment.<ref name="gamewant" /> This feeling was made worse in ''Silent Threat'' with its "cold and inhuman" briefings and non-player characters.<ref name="stwant" />

</ref><ref name="forcegood" /> However all reviewers were united in stating that the explosions in ''FreeSpace'' were the most spectacular they have ever seen. They were impressed with how a ship undergoing destruction would have electricity arcing over the hull, buckling under multiple small explosions before bursting in a large fireball with debris being flung out, leaving wreckage where the ship once stood. Sharky Extreme was dismayed by the game's inability to go beyond 640x480 screen size.<ref name="sharky" /> The game's AI garnered several praises from the reviewers.<ref name="cvgrev" /> The player's [[Wingman|wingmen]] were competent on their own and could be trusted with orders, even to the extent of co-ordinating attacks on capital ships.<ref name="skoar" /><ref name="agdb" /><ref name="forcegood">{{cite web

''Silent Threat'' was judged to be a decent but uninspiring add-on. The campaign missions were either standard escort or destroy missions, and offered no new equipment which were unable to compete against the older equipment.<ref>{{cite web

</ref><ref name="stwant" /> The stand-alone missions were however toasted for the way they were conceived. The contest winning entries gave breadth to the game's variety of missions, and encouraged greater community participation. This was possible with the free editor, FreeSpace Editor (FRED), which has been called the best space simulation editor. Able to import personal audio and 3D animation files, the editor allows users the same capability as Volition to create their own missions.<ref name="gamewant" /> The possibilities offered by the editor resulted in a call to the community to stop the flood of "[[Battle of Endor]]"-type missions, and to design missions following Volition's Jason Hoffoss' [[Zen]] philosophy of accomplishing more with less.<ref>{{cite web
