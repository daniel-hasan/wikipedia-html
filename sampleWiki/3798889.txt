The '''Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East'''<ref>An Introduction to the Christian Orthodox Churches, By John Binns, page 28 [http://books.google.com/books?id=MOA5vfSl3dwC&pg=PA28&ots=4Xlc7SrvU5&dq=%22Apostolic+Catholic+Assyrian+Church+of+the+East&sig=7lX8LhoY23F3bXoC4K7Q4jsmnSA] </ref> ({{lang-syr|ܥܕܬܐ ܩܕܝܫܬܐ ܘܫܠܝܚܝܬܐ ܩܬܘܠܝܩܝ ܕܡܕܢܚܐ ܕܐܬܘܪ̈ܝܐ}}) under His Holiness [[Mar Dinkha IV]] is a [[Christian]] church that traces its origins to the [[Episcopal see|See]] of [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]], said to be founded by [[Saint Thomas the Apostle]] as well as [[Saint Mari]] and [[Thaddeus of Edessa|Addai]] as evidenced in the [[Doctrine of Addai]]. This church is sometimes referred to as the "[[Nestorian]] Church", the "Syrian Church" or the "Persian Church."

It is sometimes mistakenly called the '''Assyrian Orthodox Church''', and is also mistakenly thought to be an [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] body. The usage of the term "Orthodox" is not to be found in the service books of the church nor is it in any official correspondence but a late and confusing usage of a term that belongs to [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches. The term "correct faith" or "correct doctrine" in [[Syriac]] is not to be found in any nomenclature of the body either. In [[Syriac]] transliterated that would be "trisa subHa". In [[India]], it is known as the '''[[Chaldean Syrian Church]]'''. In the [[Western countries|West]] it is often known as the '''[[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Church''' although the Church of the East takes issues with the term and regards it as pejorative. The church declares that no other church has suffered as many martyrdoms as the Assyrian Church of the East.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

The Assyrian Church is the original Christian church in what was once [[Parthia]]; eastern [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]]. Geographically it stretched in the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] to [[China]] and India: a monument found in [[Xi'an]] (Hsi-an), the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang-period]] [[capital]] of China (originally [[Chang'an]]), in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Syriac]] described the activities of the church in the [[7th century|7th]] and [[8th century]], while half a [[millennium]] later a Chinese [[Rabban Sauma|monk]] went from [[Beijing]] to [[Paris]] and [[Rome]] to call for an alliance with the [[Mongol]]s against the [[Mamelukes]].  Prior to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrival in India in [[1498]], it provided "'''East Syrian'''" bishops to the [[Saint Thomas Christians]].  Patriarch [[Mar Timothee I|Timothy I]] ([[727]]&ndash;[[823]]) wrote of the large Christian community in Tibet.

The founders of Assyrian theology are [[Diodorus of Tarsus]] and [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], who taught at [[Antioch]]. The normative [[Christology]] of the Assyrian church was written by [[Babai the Great]] ([[551]]&ndash;[[628]]) and is clearly different from the accusations of [[dualism]] directed toward [[Nestorius]]: his main christological work is called the '[[Book of the Union]]', and in it Babai teaches that the two ''qnome'' ([[essence]]s) are unmingled but everlastingly united in the one ''parsopa'' ([[person]]ality) of [[Jesus|Christ]].

==Early history==
{{main|History of the Church of the East in Asia}}

===Consolidation of the Church===
Christian communities existed in the regions of [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]], and [[Persian Empire|Persia]] as early as the [[2nd century|second century]].  A [[Council of Seleucia|council]] is known to have been held at [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] about [[325]] to deal with jurisdictional conflicts among the leading bishops.  At a subsequent [[Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] in [[410]] the Christian communities of [[Mesopotamia]] renounced all subjection to Antioch and the "Western" bishops and the Bishop of [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] assumed the rank of [[Catholicos]].<ref>J.-M. Fiey, ''Jalons pour une histoire de l'eglise en Iraq'', (Louvain: Secretariat du CSCO, 1970)</ref><ref>M.-L. Chaumont, ''La Christianisation de l'empire Iranien'', (Louvain: Peeters, 1988).</ref>

===Schism with the Catholic/Orthodox Church===
{{Eastern Christianity}}
The Assyrian Church was split from the [[Catholic]]/[[Orthodox Church]] (the undivided Church of the East and West prior to the [[East-West Schism]] of 1054) as a result of the [[Nestorian schism]] in [[431]], but the theology of the Assyrian church cannot be defined as [[Nestorianism]]. Nestorius, a [[pupil]] of Theodore of Mopsuestia and [[bishop]] of [[Constantinople]], was condemned because he refused to call the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] '[[Theotokos|mother of God]]' ("Theotokos" in Greek). He would only call her 'mother of Christ' ("Christotokos" in Greek). His opponent [[Cyril of Alexandria]] accused him of dividing Christ into two [[person]]s, which he clearly denied. The affair was complicated by the unclear arguments of Cyril, which soon after provoked the [[Monophysite]] [[Schism (religion)|schism]].
 
Cyril of [[Alexandria]] worked hard to remove Nestorius and his supporters and followers from power. But in the Syriac-speaking world [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] was held in very high esteem, and the condemnation of his pupil Nestorius was not received well. His followers were given refuge. The [[List of kings of Persia|Persian kings]], who were at constant war with the Roman Empire, saw the opportunity to assure the loyalty of their Christian subjects and supported the Nestorian schism:

* They granted protection to Nestorians ([[462]]).
* They executed the pro-Roman Catholicos [[Babowai]] who was then replaced by the Nestorian Bishop of [[Nisibis]] [[Bar Sauma]] ([[484]]).
* They allowed the transfer of the school of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] to the Persian city Nisibis when the Roman emperor closed it for its Nestorian tendencies ([[489]]).

===Subsequent history===
At the time of the arrival of the Nestorian refugees from Edessa, the prelate was [[Babaeus]] or [[Babowai]] (sometimes also called 'Babai', not to be confused with 'Babai the Great') ([[457]]&ndash;[[484]]), who appears to have received them with open arms. But [[Bar Sauma]], having become Bishop of Nisibis, the nearest important city to Edessa, broke with the weak Catholicos, whom he had deposed at the [[Synod of Beth Lapat]] in April, [[484]]. In the same year Babowai was accused before the king of conspiring with Constantinople and cruelly put to death. 

At the synod of Beth Lapat, it was also decided that monks and all church dignitaries should marry. 
This led to [[apostasy]] and a weakening of spiritual life, and already by [[544]] some of the reforms had been reverted. The counter reforms reached their zenith in [[571]] when [[Abraham the Great of Kashkar]] founded a new [[monastery]] on [[Mt. Izla]] above Nisibis to revive the strict monastic movement, and [[Henana of Adiabene]] became head of the school of Nisibis. Henana then broke with the Antiochene tradition of Theodore and openly followed the teaching of [[Origen]]. Attempts by the Bishops to censor and condemn Henana failed because of his protection by the royal court and he remained head of the school, even though almost all the students left.

The wars of [[610]]&ndash;[[628]] between the Persian and Byzantine empires weakened the political standing of the Assyrian church and several sees and villages were lost to the Monophysites. The Assyrian church was not allowed to choose a new Catholicos, and its theological tradition was undermined by Henana. [[Babai the Great]] together with [[Archdeacon Mar Aba]] administered the church without the authority vested in the position of the Catholicos. But in his official position as 'visitor of the monasteries of the north' Babai had the authority to investigate the [[orthodoxy]] of the monks and monasteries of northern Mesopotamia and to enforce discipline. In particular, he drove out married monks.

Babai the Great and his co-religionists worked hard to defend the legacy of Theodore: rival schools were set up in Nisibis and Balad, and the monastery of Mar Abraham, headed by Babai, took in a number of students from the school of Nisibis. Babai himself wrote a great number of commentaries and [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] to defeat the Monophysites and the Origenist Henana, and developed the only systematic Assyrian Christology. He taught that the two ''qnome'' (essence) are unmingled but everlastingly united in the one ''parsopa'' (personality) of Christ.

The defenders were successful: at the [[Episcopalian church governance|episcopal]] gathering of [[612]] the teachings of Theodore were [[Canonization|canonized]]. Soon Babai's writings and Christology became normative, and the writings of Henana were doomed to oblivion. Assyrian monasticism was purged and gathered momentum. The church proved to be well organized during the [[Arab]] conquest that followed the [[Byzantine-Persian Wars]], and flourished for many centuries after.

===Southern expansion===
Assyrian Christians reached [[India]] at an early date, either overland or via [[Christians in the Persian Gulf]].  There they are popularly known as [[Saint Thomas Christians]].  Bishops from the ''Church of the East'' were sent from Mesopotamia to India until the [[Sixteenth Century]], but ecclesio-political considerations related to [[Portugal|Portuguese]] missions meant that for the next few centuries bishops for India were ordained only with authorization from Rome, or from the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] (a [[particular church]] in communion with Rome).  Those who sought independent ecclesiastical organization looked mainly to the [[Syrian Orthodox Church]].  During the [[Nineteenth Century]], Christians in [[Trichur]] again sought the ordination of a native bishop under authority of the Church of the East.  This resulted in the organization of the [[Chaldean Syrian Church]] as a part of the Church of the East.  The present Metropolitan of India is Mar Aprem.

===Eastern expansion===

[[Image:DebateBetweenCatholicsAndOrientalChristiansInThe13thCenturyAcre1290.jpg|thumb|Debate between Catholics (left) and Oriental Christians (right) in the 13th century. Acre, circa 1290.]]
The Assyrian Church was the first Christian tradition to reach China (in [[635]]), reaching [[Mongolia]] at about the same time,<ref>Weatherford, p. 28</ref> and its relics can still be seen in Chinese cities such as [[Xi'an]] ([[Sai-an Fu]]), at that time the capital of China. An [[Memorial of the Propagation in China of the Luminous Religion from Daqin|inscribed stone]], set up in February, [[781]] at [[Chou-Chih]] ([[Pinyin]], "[[Zhouzhi]]"), fifty miles to the south-west, describes the introduction of Christianity into China from Persia in the reign of [[Emperor Tang Taizong of China|Tang Taizong]]; see the entry for [[Nestorian Stele]]. However when [[Tang Wu Zong]] decided to suppress all foreign [[religion]]s; Christianity largely ceased to exist in China. The church appears to have survived for a time, however, among the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]], and had a substantial revival under the [[Mongols]] of the [[Yuan Dynasty]].  Numerous gravestones written in [[Syriac]] survive from this time period in what is today [[Kyrgyzstan]].  A native of China was elected Patriarch as [[Yaballaha III]] in [[1281]], and his colleague [[Rabban Bar Sauma]] journeyed as far west as [[Gascony]].  A [[14th century|fourteenth-century]] monument in the remains of the Monastery of the Cross at Zhoukoudian in the [[Fangshan District]] near Beijing can still be seen.<ref>[http://edu.sina.com.cn/en/2003-01-23/8888.html Article on the 14th Century monument at Zhoukoudian in China]</ref>  

Recent historical research indicates the presence of Christianity in [[Tibet]]an controlled lands as early as the sixth and seventh centuries. A strong presence existed by the eighth century when Patriarch Timothy I (727&ndash;823) in 782 called the Tibetans one of the more significant communities of the Church of the East and wrote of the need to appoint another bishop in ca.794.<ref>Hunter, pp. 129-142</ref><ref>Klein</ref><ref>Moule</ref><ref>Saeki</ref>

The church prospered and expanded into [[China]], the steppes of [[Central Asia]], and the [[Malabar Coast]] of [[India]] until the 14th century, when the Mongol leader [[Timur]] completely destroyed the church east of [[Iraq]], except in India.<ref>[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1388350 Nestorian Church]</ref>

==Modern times==
In the [[15th century]], the church decreed that the title of Patriarch could pass only to relatives of then-patriarch [[Mar Shimun IV]]. This upset many in the church's hierarchy, and in [[1552]] a rival Patriarch, [[Mar Yohanan Soulaqa VIII]] was elected. This rival Patriarch met with the [[Pope]] and entered into communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  The Assyrian Church now had two rival leaders, a hereditary patriarch in [[Alqosh]] (in modern-day northern [[Iraq]]), and a Papal-appointed patriarch in [[Diyarbakır]] (in modern-day eastern [[Turkey]]). This situation lasted until [[1662]] when the Patriarch in Diyarbakır, [[Mar Shimun XIII Denha]], broke communion with Rome, resumed relations with the line at Alqosh, and moved his seat to the village of [[Qochanis]] in the Turkish mountains. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] responded by appointing a new patriarch to Diyarbakır to govern the Assyrians who stayed loyal to the [[Holy See]]. This latter group became known as the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]. In [[1804]] the hereditary line of Patriarchs in Alqosh died out, and that church's hierarchy decided to accept the authority of the Chaldean patriarchs.  The line of patriarchs at [[Qochanis]] remained independent.

Assyrians faced reprisals under the [[Hashemite]] monarchy for co-operating with the [[United Kingdom|British]] during the years after [[World War I]], and most fled to the West. The Patriarch [[Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII]], though born into the line of Patriarchs at Qochanis, was educated in Britain.  For a time he sought a homeland for the Assyrians in [[Iraq]] but was forced to take refuge in [[Cyprus]] in [[1933]], later moving to [[Chicago, Illinois]], and finally settling near [[San Francisco, California]].  The present Patriarch of Babylon is based in [[Chicago]], and less than 1&nbsp;million of the world's 4.5&nbsp;million Assyrians remain in Iraq.

The Chaldean community was less numerous at the time of the [[British Mandate of Palestine]], and did not play a major role in the British rule of the country. However with the [[exodus]] of Church of the East members, the Chaldean Catholic Church became the largest non-[[Muslim]] group in Iraq, and some later rose to power in the [[Ba'ath Party]] government, the most prominent being [[Deputy Prime Ministers of Iraq|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Tariq Aziz]].

In [[1964]], the issue of hereditary succession again caused a schism, with the subsequent election of [[Mar Thoma Darmo]] as a rival to the hereditary [[Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII]].  Shortly thereafter the patriarch became convinced that nothing in the [[canon law]] of the Church of the East prohibited the patriarch from [[marry]]ing. He therefore married in [[August]] [[1973]]. Mar Shimun announced his resignation in [[1973]], but was asked to stay in office. 

He was later allowed to continue in office, but was assassinated in [[1975]] while negotiations were being carried out over the conditions of his reinstatement. [[Mar Dinkha IV]] was elected as Shimun's successor, and announced the permanent end of the hereditary succession. While this removes the underlying dispute, the rift between the rival Patriarchs still exists, with [[Mar Addai II]] as the successor to Mar Thomas Darmo at the head of a group called the [[Ancient Church of the East]].

On [[November 11]], [[1994]], a historic meeting of Mar Dinkha IV and [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] took place in the Vatican and a ''Common Christological Declaration'' was signed. One side effect of this meeting was that the Assyrian Church's relationship to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] was improved.<ref>Mar Aprem Mooken,  p.18</ref>

In September 2006, Mar Dinkha IV paid a historic visit to Northern Iraq to give oversight to the churches there and to encourage the governor of the Kurdish region to open a Christian school as well as a library in Arbil.

==Liturgy==
The most common eucharistic liturgy of the Church of the East is the [[Liturgy of Addai and Mari]]. This rite is well known to liturgical scholars because it lacks the [[Words of Institution]] used by Jesus at the [[Last Supper]] ("This is my body"..."This is [the cup of] my blood"). For that reason many (especially [[Roman Catholics]]) considered this liturgy as invalid. However, in 2001, after a study of this issue, the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] and the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (Cardinal [[Ratzinger]], now [[Benedict XVI]], then being prefect) declared that this was a valid liturgy and that Roman Catholics in Iraq could receive the [[Eucharist]] in an Assyrian Church if unable to attend their own churches. This declaration was approved by Pope [[John Paul II]].

==Sacraments==
===Priesthood===
The Priesthood is the ministry of mediation between God and man in those things which impart forgiveness of sins, convey blessings and put away wrath. This is the priesthood of Christ in which the priests of the Church share.

===Baptism===
Baptism is the immersion in and the washing with water and this is divided into five kinds.

===Oil of Unction===
The [[Oil of Unction]] is an apostolical tradition, originating from the oil consecrated by the Apostles.

===Oblation (Qurbana)===
[[Qurbana]], "the Offering"; Udasha, "the Hallowing" 

The oblation is a service offered up by those below to those above, through material elements, in hope of the forgiveness of sins and of an answer to prayer. A meal of leavened bread and non-alcoholic wine. These are considered the literal body and blood of Christ, and purifies the spirit and soul.

There are three [[Anaphorae]]: [[The Hallowing of the Apostles]] ([[Saint Addai]] and [[Saint Mari]]), [[The Hallowing of Nestorius]] and [[The Hallowing of Theodore of Mopsuestia]]. The first is the normal form, and from it the Malabar revision was derived. The second is used by the Chaldeans and Nestorians on the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] and the feasts of [[St. John the Baptist]] and of the [[Greek Doctor]]s, both of which occur in Epiphany-tide on the Wednesday of the Fast of the Ninevites, and on Maundy Thursday. The third is used by the same (except when the second is ordered) from [[Advent Sunday]] to [[Palm Sunday]]. The same pro-anaphoral part serves for all three. 
Three other Anaphorae are mentioned by Ebedyeshu (metropolitan of Nisibis, 1298) in his catalogue, those of Barsuma, Narses, and Diodorus of Tarsus; but they are not known now, unless Dr. Wright is correct in calling the fragment in Brit. Mus. Add. 14669, "Diodore of Tarsus". 

The Eucharistic Liturgy is preceded by a preparation, or "Office of the Prothesis", which includes the solemn kneading and baking of the loaves. These among the Nestorians are leavened, the flour being mixed with a little oil and the holy leaven (''malka''), which, according to the legend, "was given and handed down to us by our holy fathers Mar Addai and Mar Mari and Mar Tuma", and of which and of the holy oil a very strange story is told. The real leavening, however, is done by means of fermented dough (khmira) from the preparation of the last Eucharistic Liturgy. The Chaldean Catholics now use unleavened bread.

The Liturgy itself is introduced by the first verse of the Gloria in Excelsis and the Lord's prayer, with "farcings" (giyura), consisting of a form of the Sanctus. Then follow:

The [[Introit Psalm]] (variable), called ''Marmitha'', with a preliminary prayer, varying for Sundays and greater feasts and for "Memorials" and ferias. In the Malabar Rite, Pss. xiv, cl, and cxvi are said in alternate verses by priests and deacons. 
The "Antiphon of the Sanctuary" (Unitha d' qanki), variable, with a similarly varying prayer. 
The Lakhumara, an antiphon beginning "To Thee, Lord", which occurs in other services also preceded by a similarly varying prayer. 
The [[Trisagion]]. Incense is used before this. In the Eastern Rite at low Mass the elements are put on the altar before the incensing.

There are four or five Lections: (a) the Law and (b) the Prophecy, from the Old Testament, (c) the Lection from the Acts, (d) the Epistle, always from St. Paul, (e) the Gospel. Some days have all five lections, some four, some only three. All have an Epistle and a Gospel, but, generally, when there is a Lection from Law there is none from the Acts, and vice versa. Sometimes there is none from either Law or Acts. The first three are called ''Qiryani'' (Lections), the third ''Shlikha'' (Apostle). Before the Epistle and Gospel, hymns called ''Turgama'' (interpretation) are, or should be, said; that before the Epistle is invariable, that of the Gospel varies with the day. They answer to the Greek prokeimena. The Turgama of the Epistle is preceded by proper psalm verses called ''Shuraya'' (beginning), and that of the Gospel by other proper psalm verses called ''Zumara'' (song). The latter includes Alleluia between the verses. 
The Deacon's Litany, or Eklene, called ''Karazutha'' (proclamation), resembles the "Great Synapte" of the Greeks. During it the proper "Antiphon [Unitha] of the Gospel" is sung by the people.

The [[Offertory]]. The deacons proclaim the expulsion of the unbaptized, and set the "hearers" to watch the doors. The priest places the bread and wine on the altar, with words (in the Nestorian, but not in the Chaldean Catholic Rite) which seem as if they were already consecrated. He sets aside a "memorial of the Virgin Mary, Mother of Christ" (Chaldean; usual Malabar Rite, "Mother of God"; but according to Raulin's Latin of the Malabar Rite, "Mother of God Himself and of the Lord Jesus Christ"), and of the patron of the Church (in the Malabar Rite, "of St.Thomas"). Then follows the proper "Antiphon of the Mysteries" (Unitha d' razi), answering to the offertory.

The Creed. This is a variant of the [[Nicene Creed]]. It is possible that the order or words "and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost and was made man, and was conceived and born of the Virgin Mary", may enshrine a Nestorian idea, but the Chaldean Catholics do not seem to have noticed it, their only alteration being the addition of the Filioque. The Malabar Book has an exact translation of Latin. In Neale's translation of the Malabar Rite the Karazutha, the Offertory, and the Expulsion of the Unbaptized come before the Lections and the Creed follows immediately on the Gospel, but in the Propaganda edition of 1774 the Offertory follows the Creed, which follows the Gospel.

The first Lavabo, followed by a Kushapa ("beseeching", i.e., prayer said in kneeling) and a form of the "Orate fratres", with its response. Then the variations of the three Anaphora begin. 
The Kiss of Peace, preceded by a G'hantha, i.e., a prayer said with bowed head. 
The prayer of Memorial (Dukhrana) of the Living and the Dead, and the Diptychs; the latter is now obsolate among the Nestorians. 
The Anaphora. As in all liturgies this begins with a form of a Sursum corda, but the East Syrian form is more elaborate than any other, especially in the Anaphora of Theodore. Then follows the Preface of the usual type ending with the Sanctus. 
The Post-Sanctus (to use the Hispanico-Gallican term. This is an amplification (similar in idea and often in phraseology to those in all liturgies except the Roman) of the idea of the Sanctus into a recital of the work of Redemption, extending to some length and ending, in the Anaphorae of Nestorius and Theodore, with the recital of the Institution. In the Anaphora of the Apostles the recital of the Institution is wanting, though it has been supplied in the Anglican edition of the Nestorian book. Hammond (Liturgies Eastern and Western, p. lix) and most other writers hold that the Words of Institution belong to this Liturgy and should be supplied somewhere; Hammond (loc.cit) suggests many arguments for their former presence. The reason of their absence is uncertain. While some hold that this essential passage dropped out in times of ignorance, others say it never was there at all, being unnecessary, since the consecration was held to be effected by the subsequent Epiklesis alone. Another theory, evidently of Western origin and not quite consistent with the general Eastern theory of consecration by an Epiklesis following Christ's words, is that, being the formula of consecration, it was held too sacred to be written down. It does not seem to be quite certain whether Nestorian priests did or did not insert the Words of Institution in old times, but it seems that many of them do not do so now. 
The Prayer of the Great Oblation with a second memorial of the Living and the Dead, a Kushapa. 
The G'hantha of the Epiklesis, or Invocation of Holy Spirit. The Epiklesis itself is called Nithi Mar (May He come, O Lord) from its opening words. The Liturgy of the Apostles is so vague as to the purpose of the Invocation that, when the words of Institution are not said, it would be difficult to imagine this formula to be sufficient on any hypothesis, Eastern or Western. The Anaphorae of Nestorius and Theodore, besides having the Words of Institution, have definite Invocations, evidently copied from Antiochean or Byzantine forms. The older Chaldean and the Malabar Catholic books have inserted the Words of Institution with an Elevation, after the Epiklesis. But the 1901 Mosul edition puts the Words of Institution first. 
Here follow a Prayer for Peace, a second Lavabo and a censing. 
The Fraction, Consignation, Conjunction, and Commixture. The Host is broken in two , and the sign of the Cross is made in the Chalice with one half, after which the other with the half that has been dipped in the chalice. The two halves are then reunited on the Paten. Then a cleft is made in the Host "qua parte intincta est in Sanguine" (Renaudot's tr.), and a particle is put in the chalice, after some intricate arranging on the paten.

Communion. The veil is thrown open, the deacon exhorts the communicants to draw near, the priests breaks up the Host for distribution. Then follows the Lord's Prayer, with Introduction and Embolism, and the Sancta Sanctis, and then the 'Antiphon of the Bema" (Communion) is sung. The Communion is in both species separately, the priest giving the Host and the deacon the Chalice. Then follows a variable antiphon of thanksgiving, a post-communion, and a post-communition, and a dismissal. Afterwards the Mkaprana, an unconsecrated portion of the holy loaf, is distributed to the communicants, but not, as in the case of the Greek antidoron, and as the name of the latter implies, to non-communicants. The Chaldean Catholics are communicated with the Host dipped in the Chalice. They reserve what is left of the Holy Gifts, while the Nestorian priests consume all before leaving the church. 
Properly, and according to their own canons, the Nestorians ought to say Mass on every Sunday and Friday, on every festival, and daily during the first, middle, and last week of Lent and the octave of Easter. In practice it is only said on Sundays and greater festivals, at the best, and in many churches not so often, a sort of "dry Mass" being used instead. The Chaldean Catholic priests say Mass daily, and where there are many priests there will be many Masses in the same Church in one day, which is contrary to the Nestorian canons. The Anglican editions of the liturgies omit the names of heretics and call the Anaphorae of Nestorius and Theodore the "Second Hallowing" and "Third Hallowing". Otherwise there are no alterations except the addition of Words of Institution to the first Anaphorae. The recent Catholic edition has made the same alterations and substituted "Mother of God" for "Mother of Christ". In each edition the added Words of Institution follow the form of the rite of the edition. The prayers of the Mass, like those of the Orthodox Eastern Church, are generally long and diffuse. Frequently they end with a sort of doxology called Qanuna which is said aloud, the rest being recited in a low tone. The Qanuna in form and usage resembles the Greek ekphonesis.

The vestments used by the priest at Mass are the ''Sudhra'', a girded alb with three crosses in red or black on the shoulder, the ''Urara'' (orarion) or stole worn crossed by priests, but not by bishops (as in the West), and the ''Ma'apra'', a sort of linen cope. The deacon wears the Sudhra, with an urara over the left shoulder.

===Absolution===
The Holy Eucharist, communion, mass, or Liturgy is the heart and essence of the Christian faith and worship. Correct preparation for it is essential. The priesthood of Melchizedek, among whom Jesus has been designated Highpriest, is a priesthood of spiritual physicians who treat sin as an ailment needing medical attention. in this sense absolution or curing people of their sins in order to present them blameless before God is the central work of this priesthood.

===Holy Leaven (Melka)===
The holy and blessed Apostles, Thomas and Bartholomew of the Twelve, and Adai and Man of the Seventy, who discipled the East, committed to all the Churches in the East the Holy [[Leaven]] [[Melchizedek]] used for both bread & wine. The tradition remains in the west only in the form of keeping the eucharitic hosts together. It might be related to the Jewish tradition of keeping some [[Challah]] dough to make the next Challah.

===Sign of the Cross===
This is also a special sacrament exclusive to this church. This replaces the western sacrament of marriage, which is not counted as a sacrament in this Church.

==Structure==
The patriarch is head of the church, and under him there are three [[archdiocese]]s in the Assyrian Church: one for [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[Europe]], another for [[India]], and the last serves [[Iraq]] and [[Russia]]. Individual [[diocese]]s exist in the eastern [[USA]] (including [[Chicago]]), western USA, [[California]], [[Canada]], [[Syria]], [[Iran]], [[Europe]], and one for both [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Several [[congregation (worship)|congregations]] exist in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], India, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, and Syria. A single [[parish]] exists in the [[People's Republic of China]], whose existence stretches back to antiquity, and another in Moscow. The present Patriarch, Mar Dinkha IV, has his headquarters (along with four other houses of worship) in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[USA]].
