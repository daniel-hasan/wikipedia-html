[[Image:Jiao zi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jiaozi (currency)|Jiaozi]], the world's first [[Banknote|paper-printed]] [[currency]], an innovation of the [[Song Dynasty]].]]
The '''[[Song Dynasty]]''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 宋朝; [[960]]&ndash;[[1279]] AD) provided some of the most prolific [[technology|technological]] advancements in [[History of China|Chinese history]], much of which came from talented statesmen drafted by the government through [[imperial examination]]s.

The ingenuity of advanced [[mechanical engineering]] had a long tradition in China. The Song Dynasty engineer [[Su Song]] admitted that he and his contemporaries were building upon the achievements of the ancients such as [[Zhang Heng]] (張衡; 78&ndash;139), an astronomer, inventor, and early master of mechanical gears.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 466">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 466.</ref> The application of [[movable type|movable type printing]] advanced the already widespread use of [[woodblock printing]] to educate and amuse [[Confucianism|Confucian]] students and the masses. The application of new weapons employing the use of [[gunpowder]] enabled the Song Dynasty to ward off its militant enemies until its collapse to the [[Mongols|Mongol]] forces of [[Kublai Khan]], late in the 13th century.

Notable advancements in [[civil engineering]], [[maritime history|nautics]], and [[metallurgy]] were made in Song China, as well as the introduction of the [[windmill]] to China during the 13th century. These advancements, along with the introduction of [[Banknote|paper-printed money]], helped revolutionize and sustain the [[economy of the Song Dynasty]].
 
==Polymaths and mechanical engineering==
===Polymaths===
[[Image:SuSongClock1.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A scale model of [[Su Song]]'s astronomical clocktower of Kaifeng.]]
[[Polymath]] personalities such as [[Shen Kuo]] (沈括; 1031&ndash;1095) and [[Su Song]] (苏颂; 1020&ndash;1101) embodied the spirit of early [[empirical]] science and technology in the age of the Song Dynasty. Shen Kuo is famous for discovering the concept of [[true north]] and [[magnetic declination]] towards the [[North Pole]] by calculating a more accurate measurement of the [[meridian (astronomy)|astronomical meridian]], and fixed the calculated position of the [[pole star]] that had shifted over the centuries.<ref name="sivin III 22">Sivin, III, 22.</ref> This allowed sailors to more accurately [[navigation|navigate]] the seas with the magnetic needle [[compass]], also first described by Shen Kuo.<ref name="sivin III 22"/>  Shen was made famous for his written description of [[Bi Sheng]], the inventor of [[movable type]] printing. Shen Kuo was also interested in [[geology]], as he formulated a theory of [[geomorphology]] and [[climate change]] over time after making observations of strange natural phenomena.<ref name="sivin III 23">Sivin, III, 23.</ref><ref name="needham volume 3 618">Needham, Volume 3, 618.</ref> Using contemporary knowledge of [[solar eclipse]]s and [[lunar eclipse]]s, he theorized that the sun and moon were spherical in shape, not flat, expanding upon the reasoning of earlier Chinese astronomical theorists.<ref name="needham volume 3 415 416">Needham, Volume 3, 415-416.</ref> Along with his colleague [[Wei Pu]] in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo used [[cosmological]] hypotheses when describing the variations of [[planetary motion]], including [[retrogradation]].<ref name="sivin III 16">Sivin, III, 16.</ref><ref name="sivin III 19">Sivin, III, 19.</ref> One of Shen's greatest achievements, aided by Wei Pu, was correcting the lunar error by diligently recording and plotting down the moon's [[Orbital motion|orbital path]] three times a night over a period of five years.<ref name="sivin III 18 19">Sivin, III, 18-19.</ref> Unfortunately Shen had many political rivals at court who were determined to sabotage his work. The court fully accepted their corrections to lunar and solar error, but only partially adopted Shen and Wei's corrected plotting of the [[planet]]ary orbital paths and various speeds.<ref name="sivin III 18 19"/> Su Song, one of Shen Kuo's political rivals at court, wrote a famous [[pharmaceutical]] treatise in 1070 known as the ''Ben Cao Tu Jing'', which included related subjects on [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[metallurgy]], and [[minerology]].<ref name="unschuld 60">Unschuld, 60.</ref><ref name="wu 5">Wu, 5.</ref> This treatise included many medicinal applications, including the use of [[ephedrin]] as a pharmaceutical drug.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 446">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 446.</ref> He also was the author of a large celestial atlas of five different [[star map]]s,<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 569">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 569.</ref> and his extensive written and illustrative work in [[cartography]] helped solve a heated border dispute between the Song Dynasty and its [[Khitan]] neighbor of the [[Liao Dynasty]].<ref name="wright 213">Wright, 213.</ref> However, Su Song was most famous for his  hydraulic-powered [[Astronomical clock|astronomical clock tower]], crowned with a mechanically-driven [[armillary sphere]], which was erected in the capital city of [[Kaifeng]] in the year 1088.<ref name="sivin III 31 32">Sivin, III, 31-32.</ref> Su Song's clock tower employed the [[escapement]] mechanism two centuries before it was applied in [[clock]]s of [[Europe]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 445">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 445.</ref><ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 448">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 448.</ref> Su Song's [[clock tower]] also featured the earliest known endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]] in the world, as outlined in his [[horological]] treatise of 1092.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 111">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 111.</ref> The cases of the latter two men display the eagerness of the Song in drafting highly skilled officials whom were knowledgeable in the various sciences which could ultimately benefit the administration, the military, the economy, and the people.

[[Image:Su Song Star Map 1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|One of five [[star map]]s published in [[Su Song]]'s horological and astronomical book of 1092 AD, featuring Shen Kuo's corrected position of the [[pole star]] as well as [[Mercator projection]].]]
Intellectual men of letters like the versatile Shen Kuo dabbled in subjects as diverse as [[mathematics]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[economics]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[art criticism]], [[archeology]], [[military strategy]], and [[diplomacy]], among others.<ref name="ebrey 162"/><ref name="ebrey cambridge 148">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 148.</ref> On a court mission to inspect a frontier region, Shen Kuo once made a [[raised-relief map]] of wood and glue-soaked sawdust to show the mountains, roads, rivers, and passes to other officials.<ref name="ebrey 162"/> He once computed the total number of possible situations on a game board, another time the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers.<ref name="ebrey 162">Ebrey, 162.</ref> Shen Kuo is also noted for improving the designs of the inflow [[clepsydra]] clock for a more efficient higher-order [[interpolation]], the [[armillary sphere]], the [[gnomon]], and the astronomical sighting tube; increasing its width for better observation of the pole star and other celestial bodies.<ref name="sivin III 17">Sivin, III, 17.</ref> Shen Kuo also experimented with [[camera obscura]], just several decades after the first to do so, [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (965&ndash;1039).<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 98">Needham, Volume 4, Part 1, 98.</ref>

===Odometer and South Pointing Chariot===
[[Image:Odometer2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A modern mechanical [[odometer]] of an [[automobile]].]]
There were many other important figures in the Song era besides Shen Kuo and Su Song, many of whom contributed greatly to the technological innovations of the time period. Although the mechanically-driven mile-marking device of the carriage-drawn odometer had been known in China since the ancient [[Han Dynasty]], the ''Song Shi'' (compiled in 1345) provides a much greater description and more in-depth view of the device than earlier Chinese sources. The ''Song Shi'' states:

{{cquote|The odometer. [The mile-measuring carriage] is painted red, with pictures of flowers and birds on the four sides, and constructed in two storeys, handsomely adorned with carvings. At the completion of every li, the wooden figure of a man in the lower storey strikes a drum; at the completion of every ten li, the wooden figure in the upper storey strikes a bell. The carriage-pole ends in a phoenix-head, and the carriage is drawn by four horses. The escort was formerly of 18 men, but in the 4th year of the Yong-Xi reign-period (987) the emperor Taizong increased it to 30. In the 5th year of the Tian-Sheng reign-period (1027) the Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong presented specifications for the construction of odometers as follows:<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 283">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 283.</ref>}}

What follows is a long dissertation made by the Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong on the ranging measurements and sizes of wheels and gears.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 283"/> However, the concluding paragraph provides description at the end of how the device ultimately functions:

{{cquote|When the middle horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 1 li and the wooden figure in the lower story will strike the drum. When the upper horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 10 li and the figure in the upper storey will strike the bell. The number of wheels used, great and small, is 8 inches in all, with a total of 285 teeth. Thus the motion is transmitted as if by the links of a chain, the "dog-teeth" mutually engaging with each other, so that by due revolution everything comes back to its original starting point.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 284">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 284.</ref>}}
[[Image:Zhi Nan Ju.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A replica of the 3rd century [[South Pointing Chariot]]]]
Furthermore, the odometer device in the Song period (and once during the earlier Tang period) was combined with the [[South Pointing Chariot]] device, which was first invented by the ancient Chinese mechanical engineer [[Ma Jun]] (馬鈞; c. 200&ndash;265). The South Pointing Chariot was a wheeled vehicle that incorporated complex [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears, used now in all modern automobiles to apply equal amounts of [[torque]] to wheels rotating at different speeds while turning. The differential gear was incorporated in order to keep a mechanical-operated figure pointing in a fixed position to the south. Hence, the device used advanced mechanics, rather than the magnetism of a [[compass]], in order to navigate and find one's directional bearings. Yan Su(燕肃; c. 961&ndash;1040), the Divisional Director in the Ministry of Works, recreated a South Pointing Chariot device in 1027, and his specifications for creating the device were provided in the ''Song Shi''.<ref name="sivin III 31">Sivin, III, 31.</ref> This is of little surprise, as Yan was somewhat of a polymath like Shen Kuo and Su Song, improving the design of the clepsydra clock, writing on mathematical [[harmonics]], theory about tides, etc.<ref name="sivin III 31"/> The ''Song Shi'' text records that it was the engineer Wu Deren who combined the South Pointing Chariot and odometer in the year 1107:

{{cquote|In the first year of the Da-Guan reign period (1107), the Chamberlain Wu Deren presented specifications of the south-pointing carriage and the carriage with the li-recording drum (odometer). The two vehicles were made, and were first used that year at the great ceremony of the ancestral sacrifice.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 292">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 292.</ref>}}

The text then went on to describe in full detail the intricate mechanical design for the two devices combined into one (refer to the article on the [[South Pointing Chariot]]).

===Revolving repositories===
[[Image:Longxingsi400x300.jpg|240px|left|thumb|The [[Longxing Monastery]], home to the oldest existent Chinese mechanical revolving-repository book case.]] 
Besides clockwork, hydraulic-powered armillary spheres, odometers, and mechanical compass vehicles, there were other impressive devices of mechanical engineering found during the Song Dynasty. Although literary references for mechanical revolving [[repository|repositories]] and book cases of [[Buddhist temple]]s trace back to at least 823 during the [[Tang Dynasty]],<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 549">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 549.</ref> they came to prominence during the Song Dynasty.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 549"/> Furthermore, the oldest surviving rotating book case dates to the Song period (12th century), found at the [[Longxing Monastery]] of [[Zhengding]], [[Hebei]] province.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 549"/><ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 plate CCLXIX">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, Plate CCLXIX, Fig. 683.</ref> However, there were nine prominently known revolving repositories during the Song period, and one of them was even featured in an illustration of Li Jie's book ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') of 1103.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 549"/><ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 551">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 551.</ref> The rotating repository of 1119 in Kaifu Temple near [[Changsha]] had five wheels which all turned together,<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 552"/> and the revolving repository at Nanchan Temple of Suzhou featured a [[brake]] system of some sort ([[Sinology|Sinologist]] scholars are still uncertain of how this operated, since the earliest known curve brake bands appear in the time of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in Europe).<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 552">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 552.</ref> A later Muslim traveler Shah Rukh (son of the [[Turco-Mongol]] warlord [[Timur]]) came to [[Ming Dynasty]] China in 1420 during the reign of the [[Yongle Emperor]], and described a revolving repository in Ganzhou of [[Gansu]] province that he called a 'kiosque':

{{cquote|In another temple there is an octagonal kiosque, having from the top to the bottom fifteen stories. Each story contains apartments decorated with [[lacquer]] in the [[Cathay]]an manner, with ante-rooms and [[verandah]]s...It is entirely made of polished wood, and this again [[Gilding|gilded]] so admirably that it seems to be of solid gold. There is a vault below it. An iron shaft fixed in the center of the kiosque traverses it from bottom to top, and the lower end of this works in an iron plate, whilst the upper end bears on strong supports in the roof of the edifice which contains this pavilion. Thus a person in the vault can with a trifling exertion cause this great kiosque to revolve. All the carpenters, smiths, and painters in the world would learn something in their trades by coming here!<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 554">Needham Volume 4, Part 2, 554.</ref>}}

===Textile machinery===
In the field of manufacturing [[textiles]], the Chinese invented the [[quilling]]-wheel by the 12th century,<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 107">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 107.</ref> while the mechanical [[Belt (mechanical)|belt drive]] was known since the 11th century.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 108">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 108.</ref> Qin Guan's book ''Can Shu'' (Book of [[Sericulture]]) of 1090 described a [[silk]]-reeling machine with an oscillating 'proto-flyer', as the apparatus of the main reel of which the silk is bound is wound and powered by [[treadle]] motion.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 107"/> In this device the ramping arm of the flyer was activated simultaneously by a subsidiary belt drive.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 107"/> This machine was portrayed in an illustration of the ''Geng Zhi Tu'' book of 1237,<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 107 108">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 107-108.</ref> and again a more elaborate illustration was provided in a 17th century book.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 107"/> Qin Guan's 1090 book stated that:

{{cquote|The pulley (bearing the eccentric lug) is provided with a groove for the reception of the driving belt, an endless band which responds to the movement of the machine by continuously rotating the pulley.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 108"/>}}

Although this clearly states the use of the belt drive, an endless rope or cord may have been used in [[Du Shi]]'s device of waterwheels that powered [[bellows]] of the [[blast furnace]] in the 1st century (see [[Technology of the Song Dynasty#Wind power|Wind Power]] below).<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 108"/>

==Movable type printing==
{{main|Movable type}}
{{See|History of typography in East Asia}}
[[Image:Jingangjing.gif|thumb|right|270px|The [[Diamond Sutra]], printed in 868 during the [[Tang Dynasty]].]]
[[Printing]] technology in the form of [[movable type]] was invented by [[Bi Sheng]] (毕升; 990&ndash;1051) in the 11th century. The work of Bi Sheng was written of by [[Shen Kuo]] in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' (夢溪筆談 Mengxi Bitan).<ref name="bowman 105">Bowman, 105.</ref> Movable type, alongside [[woodblock printing]], increased literacy with the mass production of printed materials. This meant that parents could encourage sons to learn to read and write and therefore be able to take the [[imperial examination]] and become part of the growing learned bureaucracy. Movable type printing was further advanced in [[Joseon]] era Korea, where Bi Sheng's baked clay characters were scrapped for metal type characters in 1234.<ref name="ebrey 238">Ebrey, 238.</ref> The movable type of Bi Sheng was later improved upon by [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (王禎; fl. 1290&ndash;1333), who invented wooden movable type c. 1298, and [[Hua Sui]] (华燧; 1439&ndash;1513), who invented [[bronze]] movable type in China in 1490; yet the [[Koreans]] had metal movable type before Hua Sui, and even Wang Zhen had experimented with [[tin]]-metal movable type.<ref name="Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 217">Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 217.</ref> Although movable type and woodblock printing would remain as the dominant types of printing methods for centuries, the European [[printing press]] (employing the [[Hellenistic]] [[screw]]-press) was eventually adopted by East Asian countries.

For printing, the mass production of [[paper]] for writing was already well established in China. The [[papermaking]] process had been perfected and standardized by the [[Han Dynasty]] court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] (蔡伦; 50&ndash;121) in 105, and was in widespread use for writing even by the 3rd century.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 1">Needham, Volume 4, Part 1, 1.</ref> The Song Dynasty was the world's first government in history to issue paper-printed money &mdash; the [[banknote]] (''see [[Jiaozi (currency)|Jiaozi]] and [[Huizi]]'').<ref name="ebrey 156">Ebrey, 156.</ref> [[Toilet paper]] had been in general use in China since the 6th century,<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 122"/> paper bags for preserving the flavor of tea leaves by the 7th century,<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 122"/> and by the Song Dynasty government officials who had done a great service were rewarded by the court with gifts of paper-printed money wrapped in paper [[envelope]]s.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 122">Needham, Volume 4, Part 1, 122.</ref> During the Song Dynasty, independent and government sponsored industries were developed to meet the needs of a growing population that had reached over 100 million. For example, for the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run [[Mint (coin)|mint]]s and factories in the cities of [[Huizhou]], [[Chengdu]], [[Hangzhou]], and Anqi.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 48">Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 48.</ref> The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories were quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 48"/>

==Gunpowder warfare==
[[Image:FireLanceAndGrenade10thCenturyDunhuang.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Earliest known representation of a gun (a [[fire lance]]) and a [[grenade]] (upper right), from the cave murals at [[Dunhuang]], c. 950 AD.<ref>"The Genius of China", Robert Temple</ref>]]
Advances in military technology aided the [[Song Dynasty]] in its defense against hostile neighbors to the north. The [[flamethrower]] found its origins in [[Byzantine]]-era [[Greece]], employing [[Greek fire]] (a chemically-complex, highly [[flammable]] petrol fluid) in a device with a [[siphon]] hose by the [[7th century]].<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 77">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 77.</ref> The earliest reference to Greek Fire in China was made in 917, written by the author Wu Renchen in his ''Shiguo Chunqiu''.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 80">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 80.</ref> In 919, the siphon projector-pump was used to spread the 'fierce fire oil' that could not be doused with water, as recorded by Lin Yu in his ''Wuyue Beishi'', hence the first credible Chinese reference to the flamethrower employing the chemical solution of Greek fire (see also [[Pen Huo Qi]]).<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 81">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 81.</ref> Lin Yu mentioned also that the 'fierce fire oil' derived ultimately from one of China's maritime contacts in the 'southern seas', [[Arabia]] (''Dashiguo'').<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 82">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 82.</ref> In the Battle of Langshan Jiang (Wolf Mountain River) in 932, the naval fleet of the Wenmu King from [[Wuyue]] defeated a [[Huainan]] army from the [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu state]]; Wenmu's success was facilitated by the use of 'fire oil' ('huo you') to burn their fleet, signifying the first Chinese use of [[gunpowder]] in a battle.<ref>Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 81&ndash;83</ref> The Chinese applied the use of double-[[piston]] [[bellows]] to pump petrol out of a single cylinder (with an upstroke and downstroke), lit at the end by a slow-burning gunpowder match to fire a continuous stream of flame.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 82"/> This device was featured in description and illustration of  the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' military manuscript of 1044.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 82"/> In the suppression of the [[Southern Tang]] state by 976, early Song naval forces confronted them on the Yangtze River in 975. Southern Tang forces attempted to use flamethrowers against the Song navy, but were accidentally consumed by their own fire when violent winds swept in their direction.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 89">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 89.</ref>

[[Image:Chinese Flamethrower.JPG|thumb|right|180px|A Chinese [[flamethrower]] from the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' manuscript of 1044 AD, [[Song Dynasty]].]]
Although the destructive effects of gunpowder were described in the earlier [[Tang Dynasty]] by a [[Taoism|Daoist]] [[alchemy|alchemist]], the earliest-known existent written formulas for gunpowder come from the ''Wujing Zongyao'' text of 1044, which described explosive bombs hurled from catapults.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 138">Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 138.</ref> The earliest developments of the gun barrel and the projectile-fire [[cannon]] were found in late Song China. The first art depiction of the Chinese '[[fire lance]]' (a combination of a temporary-fire flamethrower and gun) was from a Buddhist mural painting of [[Dunhuang]], dated circa 950.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 224 225">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 224-225.</ref> These 'fire-lances' were widespread in use by the early 12th century, featuring hollowed bamboo poles as tubes to fire sand particles (to blind and choke), lead pellets, bits of sharp metal and pottery shards, and finally large gunpowder-propelled arrows.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 220 221">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 220-221.</ref> Eventually, perishable bamboo was replaced with hollow tubes of cast iron, and so too did the terminology of this new weapon change, from 'fire-spear' ('huo qiang') to 'fire-tube' ('huo tong').<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 221">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 221.</ref> This ancestor to the gun was dually complemented by the ancestor to the cannon, what the Chinese referred to since the 13th century as the 'multiple bullets magazine erupter' ('bai zu lian zhu pao'), a tube of bronze or cast iron that was filled with about 100 lead balls.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 263-264">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 263-364.</ref> However, the oldest existent [[archaeological]] discovery of a metal barrel [[handgun]] is from the Chinese [[Heilongjiang]] excavation, dated to 1288.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 293">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 293.</ref> The Chinese also discovered the explosive potential of packing hollowed cannonball shells with gunpowder. Written later by [[Jiao Yu]] (焦玉) in his ''[[Huolongjing]]'' (mid 14th century), this manuscript recorded an earlier Song-era cast iron cannon known as the 'flying-cloud thunderclap eruptor' (fei yun pi-li pao). The manuscript stated that:

{{cquote|The shells are made of cast iron, as large as a bowl and shaped like a ball. Inside they contain half a pound of 'magic' gunpowder. They are sent flying towards the enemy camp from an eruptor; and when they get there a sound like a thunder-clap is heard, and flashes of light appear. If ten of these shells are fired successfully into the enemy camp, the whole place will be set ablaze...<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 264">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 264.</ref>}}

[[Image:Trebuchet1-intransit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An illustration of a [[trebuchet]] catapult, from the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' of 1044.]]
As noted before, the change in terminology for these new weapons during the Song period were gradual. The early Song Dynasty cannons were at first termed the same way as the Chinese [[trebuchet]] [[catapult]]. A later [[Ming Dynasty]] scholar known as Mao Yuanyi would explain this use of terminology and true origins of the cannon in his text of the ''Wu Bei Zhi'', written in 1628:

{{cquote|The Song people used the turntable trebuchet, the single-pole trebuchet and the squatting-tiger trebuchet. They were all called 'fire trebuchets' because they were used to project fire-weapons like the (fire-)ball, (fire-)falcon, and (fire-)lance. They were the ancestors of the cannon.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 22">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 22.</ref>}}

The 14th century ''[[Huolongjing]]'' was also one of the first Chinese texts to carefully describe to the use of explosive [[land mine]]s, which had been used by the late Song Chinese against the Mongols in 1277, and employed by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] afterwards.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 192">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 192.</ref> The innovation of the detonated land mine was accredited to one Luo Qianxia in the campaign of defense against the Mongol invasion by [[Kublai Khan]],<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 192">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 192.</ref> Later Chinese texts revealed that the Chinese land mine employed either a rip cord or a motion [[booby trap]] of a pin releasing falling weights that rotated a steel [[wheellock|flint wheel]], which in turn created sparks that ignited the train of [[fuse]]s for the land mines.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 199">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 199.</ref> Furthermore, the Song Dynasty employed the use of the earliest known gunpowder-propelled [[rocket]]s in warfare during the late 13th century,<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 477">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 477.</ref> its earliest form being the archaic [[Fire Arrow]]. When the Northern Song Dynasty capital of Kaifeng fell to the Jurchens in 1126, it was written by Xia Shaozeng that 20000 fire arrows were handed over to the Jurchens in their conquest.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 154">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 154.</ref> An even earlier Chinese text of the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' (武经总要, "Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques"), written in 1044 by the Song scholars Zeng Kongliang and Yang Weide, described the use of three spring or triple bow [[ballista|arcuballista]] that fired arrow bolts holding gunpowder packets near the head of the arrow.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 154"/> Going back yet even farther, the ''Wu Li Xiao Shi'' (1630, second edition 1664) of Fang Yizhi stated that fire arrows were presented to [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] (太祖; r. 960&ndash;976) in 960.<ref name="partington 240">Partington, 240.</ref>

In ancient China, the [[sluice]] gate, the [[Lock (water transport)|canal lock]], and [[flash lock]] had been known since at least the 1st century BC (as sources then alluded that they were not new innovations), during the ancient [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC&ndash;220 AD).<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 344 350">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 344-350.</ref>  During the Song Dynasty that the [[pound lock]] was first invented in 984 by the Assistant Commissioner of Transport for [[Huainan]], the engineer Qiao Weiyo.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 350">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 350.</ref>  During his day, the Chinese became concerned with a [[barge]] traffic problem at the Shanyang Yundao section of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]], as ships often became wrecked while passing the double slipways and were robbed of the tax grain by local [[bandit]]s. The historical text of the ''Song Shi'' (compiled in 1345) stated that in 984:

{{cquote|Qiao Weiyo also built five double slipways (lit. [[dam]]s) between Anbei and Huaishi (or, the quays on the Huai waterfront). Each of these had ten lanes for the barges to go up and down. Their cargoes of imperial tax-grain were heavy, and as they were passing over they often came to grief and were damaged or wrecked, with loss of the grain and peculation by a cabal of the workers in league with local bandits hidden nearby. Qiao Weiyo therefore first ordered the construction of two gates at the third dam along the West River (near Huaiyin). The distance between the two gates was rather more than 50 paces (250&nbsp;ft) and the whole space was covered over with a great roof like a shed. The gates were 'hanging gates'; (when they were closed) the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached, and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out. He also built a horizontal bridge to protect their foundations. After this was done (to all the double slipways) the previous corruption was completely eliminated, and the passage of the boats went on without the slightest impediment.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 351">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 351.</ref>}}

[[Image:Canallock.png|thumb|right|170px|Diagram of a canal [[pound lock]], invented in the 10th century and written of by [[Shen Kuo]].]]
This practice became widespread, and was even written of by the Chinese polymath scientist [[Shen Kuo]] in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' (1088).<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 351 352">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 351-352.</ref>  Shen Kuo wrote that the establishment of pound lock gates at Zhenzhou (presumably Kuozhou along the [[Yangtze]]) during the Tian Sheng reign period (1023&ndash;1031) freed up the use of five hundred working laborers at the canal each year, amounting to the saving of up to 1,250,000 strings of cash annually.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 352">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 352.</ref>  He wrote that the old method of hauling boats over limited the size of the cargo to 300 ''tan'' of rice per vessel (roughly 21 [[ton]]s/21337&nbsp;[[kg]]), but after the pound locks were introduced, boats carrying 400 ''tan'' (roughly 28&nbsp;[[ton]]s/28449&nbsp;[[kg]]) could then be used.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 352"/>  Shen wrote that by his time (c. 1080) government boats could carry cargo weights of up to 700 ''tan'' (49½&nbsp;[[ton]]s/50294&nbsp;[[kg]]), while private boats could hold as much as 800 bags, each weighing 2 ''tan'' (i.e. 113&nbsp;[[ton]]s/114813&nbsp;[[kg]]).<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 352"/> Shen Kuo also noted that proper use of sluice gates at irrigation canals was the best means of achieving success in the [[silt]] [[fertilization]] method.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 230 231">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 230-231.</ref> However, agricultural and transportation needs had the potential to conflict with one another. This is best represented in the ''Dongpo Zhilin'' of the governmental official and famous poet [[Su Shi]] (苏轼; 1037&ndash;1101), who wrote about two decades before Shen Kuo in 1060:

{{cquote|Several years ago the government built sluice gates for the silt fertilization method, though many people disagreed with the plan. In spite of all opposition it was carried through, yet it had little success. When the torrents on Fan Shan were abundant, the gates were kept closed, and this caused damage (by flooding) of fields, tombs, and houses. When the torrents subsided in the late autumn the sluices were opened, and thus the fields were irrigated with silt-bearing water, but the deposit was not as thick as what the peasants call 'steamed cake silt' (so they were not satisfied). Finally the government got tired of it and stopped. In this connection I remember reading the ''Jiayipan'' of [[Bai Juyi]] (the poet) in which he says that he once had a position as Traffic Commissioner. As the Bian River was getting so shallow that it hindered the passage of boats he suggested that the sluice gates along the river and canal should be closed, but the Military Governor pointed out that the river was bordered on both sides by fields which supplied army grain, and if these were denied irrigation (water and silt) because of the closing of the sluice gates, it would lead to shortages in army grain supplies. From this I learnt that in the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang period]] there were government fields and sluice gates on both sides of the river, and that irrigation was carried on (continuously) even when the water was high. If this could be done (successfully) in old times, why can it not be done now? I should like to enquire further about the matter from experts.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 230">Needham Volume 4, Part 3, 230.</ref>}}

Although the [[drydock]] had been known in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] since the late 3rd century BC (by a [[Phoenicia]]n; not used again until [[Henry VII of England]] in 1495), the scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] wrote of its use in China to repair boats during the 11th century. In his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' (1088), Shen Kuo wrote:

{{cquote|At the beginning of the dynasty (c. 965) the two Zhe provinces (now [[Zhejiang]] and southern [[Jiangsu]]) presented (to the throne) two dragon ships each more than (60.00&nbsp;m/200&nbsp;ft) in length.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 660 220 feet">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 660, 200 feet.</ref> The upper works included several decks with [[palace|palatial]] cabins and [[cabin (ship)|saloon]]s, containing [[throne]]s and [[couch]]es all ready for imperial tours of inspection. After many years, their hulls decayed and needed repairs, but the work was impossible as long as they were afloat. So in the Xi-Ning reign period (1068 to 1077) a palace official Huang Huaixin suggested a plan. A large basin was excavated at the north end of the Jinming Lake capable of containing the dragon ships, and in it heavy crosswise beams were laid down upon a foundation of pillars. Then (a breach was made) so that the basin quickly filled with water, after which the ships were towed in above the beams. The (breach now being closed) the water was pumped out by wheels so that the ships rested quite in the air. When the repairs were complete, the water was let in again, so that the ships were afloat once more (and could leave the dock). Finally the beams and pillars were taken away, and the whole basin covered over with a great roof so as to form a hanger in which the ships could be protected from the elements and avoid the damage caused by undue exposure.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 660">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 660.</ref>}}

===Background===
[[Image:Songrivership3.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] naval ship with a traction [[trebuchet]] [[catapult]], from the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' of 1044.]]
The Chinese of the Song Dynasty were adept [[maritime]] sailors who traveled to ports of call as far away as [[Fatimid]] Egypt. They were well equipped for their journeys abroad, in large seagoing vessels steered by stern-post [[rudder]]s and guided by the directional [[compass]]. Even before Shen Kuo and Zhu Yu had described the mariner's magnetic needle compass, the earlier military treatise of the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' in 1044 had also described a thermoremanence compass.<ref name="sivin III 21"/> This was a simple iron or steel needle that was heated, cooled, and placed in a bowl of water, producing the effect of weak magnetization, although its use was described only for navigation on land and not at sea.<ref name="sivin III 21">Sivin, III, 21.</ref>

===Literature===
There were plenty of descriptions in Chinese literature of the time on the operations and aspects of seaports, maritime merchant shipping, overseas trade, and the sailing ships themselves. The author [[Zhu Yu (author)|Zhu Yu]] (朱彧) wrote not only of the magnetic compass for navigation, but also a hundred foot line with a hook that was cast over the deck of the ship, used to collect mud samples at the bottom of the sea in order for the crew to determine their whereabouts by the smell and appearance of the mud.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 279">Needham, Volume 4, Part 1, 279.</ref> In addition, Zhu Yu wrote of [[Bulkhead (partition)|watertight bulkhead compartments]] in the [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] of ships to prevent sinking if damaged, the [[fore-and-aft rig|for-and-aft]] [[lugger|lug]], taut mat sails, and the practice of beating-to-windward.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 463">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 463.</ref> Confirming Zhu Yu's writing on Song Dynasty ships with bulkhead hull compartments, in 1973 a 78 ft long, 29 ft wide Song Dynasty trade ship from c. 1277 AD was dredged from the water near the southern coast of China that contained 12 bulkhead compartment rooms in its hull.<ref name="ebrey 159">Ebrey, 159.</ref> Maritime culture during the Song period was enhanced by these new technologies, along with the allowance of greater river and canal traffic. All around there was a bustling display of government run grain-tax transport ships, tribute vessels and barges, private shipping vessels, a multitude of busy fishers in small fishing boats, along with the rich enjoying the comforts of their luxurious private [[yacht]]s.<ref name="China"/> 

Besides Zhu Yu there were other prominent Chinese authors of maritime interests as well. In 1178, the [[Guangzhou]] customs officer Zhou Qufei, who wrote about the [[Arab]] [[slave trade]] of [[Africa]]ns as far as [[Madagascar]],<ref name="levathes 37">Levathes, 37.</ref> stated this about Chinese seagoing ships, their sizes, durability at sea, and the lives of those on board:

{{cquote|The ships which sail the southern sea and south of it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their [[rudder]]s are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] on board. There is no account of dead or living, no going back to the mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 464">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 464.</ref>}}

The later Muslim [[Moroccan]] [[Berber people|Berber]] traveler [[Ibn Batutta]] (1304&ndash;1377) wrote in greater detail about Chinese sailing vessels than Zhou Qufei. He noted that in and around the seas of China, only the distinct Chinese [[junk (ship)|junk ships]] were used to sail the waters.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 469">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 469</ref> He noted that the largest type of Chinese ships boasted a total of twelve sailing [[mast]]s, while the smaller ones had three.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 469"/> On Chinese ships and their crews, Ibn Batutta stated:
[[Image:SongJunk.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A Song era [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ship, 13th century; Chinese ships of the Song period featured [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s with [[Bulkhead (partition)|watertight compartments]].]] 

{{cquote|The sails of these vessels are made of strips of [[bamboo]], woven into the form of [[matting]]. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the direction of them according to whether the wind is blowing from one side or the other. When the ships cast anchor, the sails are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 [[sailor]]s and 400 [[Marine (military)|marine]]s, among whom there are archers and [[crossbow]]men furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) [[naptha]]. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a [[pinnace]], a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a [[rowing boat]]). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton ([[Quanzhou]]) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin ([[Guangzhou]]).<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 469"/>}}

Ibn Batutta then went on describing the means of their construction, and accurate depictions of separate bulkhead compartments in the hulls of the ships:

{{cquote|This is the manner in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of very thick wooden (planking) are raised, and across the space between them are placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured longitudinally and transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the lower deck is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and those parts of the hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; they are as big as masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 469"/>}}

Although Ibn Batutta had mentioned the size of the sailing crew, he described the sizes of the vessels further, as well as the lavish merchant cabins on board:

{{cquote|The vessels have four decks, upon which there are cabins and [[saloon]]s for merchants. Several of these 'mysria' contain cupboards and other conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, and keys for their occupiers. (The merchants) take with them their wives and concubines. It often happens that a man can be in his cabin without others on board realizing it, and they do not see him until the vessel has arrived in some port. The sailors also have their children in such cabins; and (in some parts of the ship) they sew garden herbs, vegetables, and ginger in wooden tubs. The Commander of such a vessel is a great [[Emir]]; when he lands, the archers and the [[Ethiopians|Ethiops]] (i.e. black slaves, yet in China these men-at-arms would have most likely been [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]]) march before him bearing [[javelin]]s and swords, with drums beating and trumpets blowing. When he arrives at the guesthouse where he is to stay, they set up their lances on each side of the gate, and mount guard throughout his visit.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 470">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 470.</ref>}}

===Paddle-wheel ships===
[[Image:Radpaddelsch.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Paddle-wheel ship, 1726]]
During the Song Dynasty there was also great amount of attention given to the building of efficient automotive vessels known as [[Paddle steamer|paddle wheel craft]]. The latter had been known in China perhaps since the 5th century,<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 31">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 31.</ref> and certainly by the [[Tang Dynasty]] in 784 with the successful paddle wheel warship design of Li Gao.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 31"/> In 1134 the Deputy Transport Commissioner of [[Zhejiang]], Wu Ge, had paddle wheel warships constructed with a total of nine wheels and others with thirteen wheels.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 421">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 421.</ref> However, there were paddle wheel ships in the Song that were so large that 12 wheels were featured on each side of the vessel.<ref name="morton 104">Morton, 104.</ref> In 1135 the famous geneal [[Yue Fei]] (岳飞; 1103&ndash;1142) ambushed a force of rebels under Yang Yao, entangling their paddle wheel craft by filling a lake with floating weeds and rotting logs, thus allowing them to board their ships and gain a strategic victory.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 421"/> In 1161, [[gunpowder]] [[bomb]]s and paddle wheel crafts were used effectively by the Song Chinese in the [[Battle of Tangdao]] and the [[Battle of Caishi]] against the [[Jurchen]] [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin Dynasty]], who made an unsuccessful invasion of the Southern Song along the [[Yangtze]] River.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 421"/> In 1183 the [[Nanjing]] naval commander Chen Tang was given a reward for constructing ninety paddle wheel crafts and other ships for war.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 421"/> In 1176, [[Emperor Xiaozong of Song]] (孝宗; r. 1162&ndash;1189) issued an imperial order to the Nanjing official Guo Gang (who desired to convert damaged paddle wheel craft into [[Junk (ship)|junk ships]] and [[galley]]s) not to limit the amount of paddle wheel craft in the navy's dockyards, since he had high esteem for the fast assault craft that won the Chinese victory at Caishi.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 422">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 422.</ref> However, paddle wheel craft found other uses besides effective assaults in warfare. The Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for [[Quanzhou]], the Muslim Kuwabara (who served from 1250&ndash;1275) noted that paddle wheel ships were also used by the Chinese as [[tugboat]]s for [[towing]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 423">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 423.</ref>

==Metallurgy==
[[Image:Yuan Dynasty - waterwheels and smelting.png|thumb|right|260px|An illustration of [[blast furnace]] bellows operated by waterwheels, from the ''Nong Shu'', by [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]], 1313, during the [[Yuan Dynasty]].]]
The art of [[History of ferrous metallurgy|metallurgy]] during the Song Dynasty built upon the efforts of earlier Chinese dynasties, while new methods were incorporated. The Chinese of the ancient [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC&ndash;220) figured out how to create [[steel]] by smelting together the [[carbon]] intermediary of [[wrought iron]] and [[cast iron]] by the 1st century BC.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 563g">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 563 g</ref><ref name="gernet 69">Gernet, 69.</ref><ref name="morton 287">Morton, 287.</ref> However, there were two new Chinese innovations of the Song Dynasty to create steel during the 11th century. This was the "berganesque" method that produced inferior, inhomogeneous steel, while the other was a precursor to the modern Bessemer process that utilized partial decarbonization via repeated forging under a cold blast.<ref name="Hartwell, 53 54">Hartwell, 53-54.</ref> 

The per capita [[iron]] output rose sixfold between 806 and 1078, and by 1078 Song China was producing 127000000&nbsp;[[kg]] (125,000&nbsp;English [[ton|t]]/114,000&nbsp;[[metric tonne]]s) in weight of iron per year.<ref name="Ebrey 158">Ebrey et al., 158.</ref><ref name="wagner 175"/>  The historian Donald B. Wagner points out that this estimate was based upon the total number of government tax [[receipt]]s on iron from the various iron-producing prefectures in the empire.<ref name="wagner 177">Wagner, 177.</ref> In the smelting process of using huge [[bellows]] driven by [[hydraulics]] (i.e. large [[waterwheel]]s), massive amounts of [[charcoal]] were used in the production process, leading to a wide range of [[deforestation]] in northern China.<ref name="Ebrey 158"/><ref name="ebrey cambridge 144">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 144.</ref> However, by the end of the 11th century the Chinese discovered that using [[Coke (fuel)|bituminous coke]] could replace the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land and prime timber in northern China were spared by the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources to [[coal]].<ref name="Ebrey 158"/><ref name="ebrey cambridge 144"/> This massive increase in output of the iron and steel industry in China was the result of the Song Dynasty's needs for military expansion, private commercial demands for metal products such as cooking utensils found in the market and a wide variety of agricultural tools, and by new canals linking major centers of iron and steel production to the capital city's bustling market.<ref name="embree 339">Embree, 339.</ref> The many uses for manufactured iron products in the Song period included iron for weapons,<ref name="wagner 175">Wagner, 175.</ref> implements,<ref name="wagner 175"/> coins,<ref name="wagner 175"/> architectural elements,<ref name="wagner 175"/> musical bells,<ref name="wagner 175"/> artistic statues,<ref name="wagner 175"/> and components for machinery such as the [[hydraulic]]-powered [[trip hammer]], which had been known since the 1st century BC during the ancient Han Dynasty,<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 390 392">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 390-392.</ref> and used extensively during the Song Dynasty.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 393">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 393.</ref> Due to the enormous amount of production, the economic historian Robert Hartwell noted that Chinese iron and coal production in the following 12th century was equal to if not greater than [[England]]'s iron and coal production in the early phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]] during the late 18th century.<ref name="embree 712">Embree, 712.</ref> However, the Chinese of the Song period did not harness the energy potential of coal in ways that would generate power mechanically, as in the later Industrial Revolution that would originate in the [[Western world|West]].<ref name="China">China. (2007). [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-71718/China In ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']. From Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved on [[2007-06-28]]</ref> There were certain administrative prefectures during the Song era where the Chinese [[iron industry]] was mostly concentrated. For example, the poet and statesman [[Su Shi]] wrote a memorial to the throne in the year 1078 that specified 36 ironwork smelters, each employing a work force of several hundred people, in the Liguo Industrial Prefecture (under his governance while he administered [[Xuzhou]]).<ref name="wagner 178 179">Wagner, 178-179.</ref>

==Wind power==
[[Image:Campo de Criptana Molinos de Viento 1.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Vertical [[windmill]]s at La Mancha, [[Spain]], which differ in design to horizontal Chinese windmills.]]
The effect of wind power was appreciated in China long before the introduction of the [[windmill]] during the Song period. It is uncertain when the ancient Chinese used their very first inflatable [[bellows]] as wind-blowing machines for kilns and furnaces. They existed perhaps as far back as the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1600 BC&ndash;1050 BC), due to the intricate [[bronze]] casting technology of the period. They were certainly used since the advent of the [[blast furnace]] in China from the 6th century BC onwards, since [[cast iron]] farm tools and weapons were widespread by the 5th century BC.<ref name="ebrey 30">Ebrey, 30.</ref> In 31 the [[Han Dynasty]] governmental [[prefect]] and engineer [[Du Shi]] (杜詩; d. 38) employed the use of horizontal [[waterwheel]]s and a complex mechanical gear system to operate the large bellows that heated the [[blast furnace]] in smelting [[cast iron]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 370">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 370.</ref>  Bellows continued in use for purposes of metallurgy, but other sources of wind power were discovered and harnessed. The Han Dynasty artisan Ding Huan (fl. 180) not only pioneered the invention of the [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardan suspension]], but also the [[rotary]] [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]],<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 33">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 33.</ref> which could be used as a simple [[air conditioner]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 233">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 233.</ref> There was also an intricate Chinese rotary fan [[winnowing]] machine depicted in [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen's]] agricultural treatise of the ''Nong Shu'' of 1313 (although the earliest depiction of a winnowing machine was from a Han Dynasty tomb model dated from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century).<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 118">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 118.</ref><ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 plate CLVI">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, Plate CLVI.</ref> After these innovations, the windmill was finally introduced to China in the early 13th century via the [[Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin Dynasty]] in [[northern China]], during the late Song Dynasty.

The [[Persian Empire|Persian]] scholar [[Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari]] wrote c. 850 that the earlier [[Caliph]] [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] was murdered in 644 by the technician Abu Lu'lu'a, who claimed to construct [[mill]]s driven by the power of wind.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 556">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 556.</ref> More reliable than this account were the [[windmill]]s of the Banu Musa brothers (850 to 870), while there are also several authors confirming the windmills of [[Sistan]] ([[Iran]]), written of by Abu Ishaq al-Istakhri and Abu al-Qasim ibn Hauqal.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 557">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 557.</ref> The northern Chinese under the rule of the [[Jurchen]] Jin Dynasty became acquainted with the windmills of the [[Islamic world]] in the early 13th century. This is seen in an account of the ''Shu Zhai Lao Xue Cong Tan'' (Collected Talks of the Learned Old Man of the Shu Studio), written by Sheng Ruozi.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 560">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 560.</ref> It read:

{{cquote|In the collection of the private works of the 'Placid Retired Scholar' (Zhan Ran Ju Shi), there are ten poems on Hechong Fu. One of these describes the scenery of that place...and says that 'the stored wheat is milled by the rushing wind and the rice is pounded fresh by hanging [[Mortar and pestle|pestles]]. The westerners (i.e. [[Turkish people|Turks]]) there use [[windmill]]s (''feng mo'') just as the people of the south (i.e. Southern Song Dynasty) use [[watermill]]s (''shui mo''). And when they pound they have the pesltes hanging vertically'.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 560"/>}}

Here Sheng Ruozi quotes a written selection about windmills from the 'Placid Retired Scholar', who is actually Yelü Chucai (1190&ndash;1244), a prominent Jin and [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] statesman (after the Jin fell in 1234 to the [[Mongols]]).<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 560"/> The passage refers to Yelü's journey to [[Turkestan]] (in modern [[Xinjiang]]) in 1219, and Hechong Fu is actually [[Samarkand]] (in modern [[Uzbekistan]]).<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 560"/> Afterwards, the Chinese applied the 'fore-and-aft' sail riggings of typical Chinese junk ships to horizontal windmills.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 561">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 561.</ref> These windmills were used to operate the square-pallet [[chain pump]]s used in Chinese [[irrigation]] since the ancient [[Han Dynasty]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 558">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 558.</ref> Windmills of this nature were still in use during modern times in [[Tianjin]] and along the [[Yangtze]] River.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 558"/> The first European to view Chinese windmills was Jan Nieuhoff, who spotted them in [[Jiangsu]] while traveling along the [[Grand Canal]] in 1656, as part of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[embassy]] to [[Beijing]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 558"/> The first European windmills written of were those of Dean Herbert of [[East Anglia]] in 1191, who competed with the mills of the [[Abbey]] of [[Bury St Edmunds]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 555">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 555.</ref>

After the windmill, wind power applications in other devices and even vehicles were found in China. There was the '[[Wheelbarrow|sailing carriage]]' that appeared by at least the [[Ming Dynasty]] in the 16th century (although it could have been known beforehand).
