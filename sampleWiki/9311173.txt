[[Principal photography]] for [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] was conducted concurrently in [[New Zealand]] from [[October 11]], [[1999]] through to [[December 22]], [[2000]] for 274 days. [[Pick-up (film)|Pick-up]] shoots were conducted annually from 2001 to 2004. The trilogy was shot at over 150 different locations,<ref name="Trilogy book">''The Making of the Movie Trilogy'' by [[Brian Sibley]], 2002, ISBN 0-00-713567-X</ref> with seven different units shooting, as well as soundstages around [[Wellington]] and [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].  Jackson directed the whole production, while other unit directors included John Mahaffie, Geoff Murphy, [[Fran Walsh]], Barrie Osbourne, Rick Porras. Jackson monitored these units with live satellite feeds, and with the added pressure of constant script re-writes and the multiple units handling his vision, he only got around 4 hours of sleep a night.<ref name="TTT SEE"> {{cite video| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers "Appendices"| medium = [[DVD]]| publisher = [[New Line Cinema]]| date = 2003}}</ref>

Peter Jackson described the production as the world's largest home movie, due to the independence and sense of family.<ref name="ROTK SEE">{{cite video| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King "Appendices"| medium = [[DVD]]| publisher = [[New Line Cinema]]| date = 2004 }}</ref> Barrie Osbourne saw it as a traveling circus.<ref name="TTT SEE" /> Fran Walsh described writing the script for the production as "laying the track down in front of a moving train" (paraphrased). Jackson also described shooting as like organizing an army, with 2,400 people involved at the height of production. Due to the remoteness of some of New Zealand's untamed landscapes, the crew would also bring survival kits in case helicopters couldn't reach the location to bring them home in time.<ref name="FOTR SEE">{{cite video| title = The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Appendices|medium = [[DVD]]|publisher = [[New Line Cinema]] | date = 2002}}</ref>

===Late 1999===
[[Image:Ringwraithpic.JPG|thumb|300px|left|October 11, 1999 -- the first scene filmed for the trilogy was the scene in which the Hobbits hide from a Ringwraith]]
The first scene filmed was the Wooded Road sequence where the [[Hobbit]]s hide underneath the tree from a Ringwraith. The focus was generally on ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' when the Hobbits try to reach [[Rivendell]], such as a single night in Bree exteriors. Second units also shot the [[Ford of Bruinen]] chase and the deforestation of [[Isengard]]. Liv Tyler generally came to New Zealand for stunts, and spent five days on a barrel for Bruinen whilst riding double [[Jane Abbott (horse rider)|Jane Abbott]] got to ride on horseback.<ref name="FOTR SEE" />

During the first month of filming, an immediate event took place: [[Stuart Townsend]] was deemed too young to play [[Aragorn]], and within three days [[Viggo Mortensen]] became his replacement, just in time to film the [[Weathertop]] sequence. Mortensen, who decided to take the role because his own son was a book fan, became a hit on set, going fishing, always taking his "hero" sword around and applied dirt to improve Ngila Dickson's makeshift look to his costume.<ref name="FOTR SEE" /> He also headbutted the stunt team as a sign of friendship,<ref name="TTT SEE" /> and bought himself his horse, Uraeus, as well as another horse for Abbott.<ref name="ROTK SEE" /> 

[[Sean Bean]] began filming in November for most of his scenes. It was during this time shooting became focused on the battle of [[Amon Hen]].<ref name="FOTR SEE" /> Despite the focus on ''Fellowship'', floods in Queenstown prompted the crew to shoot mountain interiors from ''The Return of the King'' for Wood and Astin: a single day ([[November 24]]) of Astin's coverage from a pivotal scene. This would become a general failsafe measure if the weather disrupted the shooting schedule.<ref name="TTT SEE" /> Wood's coverage wouldn't be done until [[November 30]], [[2000]].<ref name="ROTK SEE" />

===2000===
A [[Christmas]] break followed, and filming resumed on [[January 17]]. [[Ian McKellen]], fresh from filming ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', arrived to film scenes in [[Hobbiton]] and the [[Grey Havens]]. McKellen did not become that close to the lead actors due to generally working with their scale doubles, but when [[Christopher Lee]] arrived in February, they became very friendly.<ref name="FOTR SEE" /> Shooting the fight sequence in Orthanc interiors without air conditioning (for atmosphere) and with heavy wigs and robes was described by the actors as "murder".<ref name="Trilogy book" /> The Grey Havens sequence, which takes place at the end of ''The Return of the King'', was shot three times due to, firstly, Sean Astin forgetting his vest after lunch and secondly, an out-of-focus camera.<ref name="ROTK SEE" />

While the Hobbit leads had scenes in Hobbiton and Rivendell exteriors in Kaitoke Park with new arrival [[Ian Holm]], Mortensen, Bloom and Rhys-Davies filmed scenes involving the Rohirrim countryside. Mortensen broke his toe kicking an Orc helmet on camera, Bloom fell off his horse and broke a rib, and the Gimli scale double, Brett Beattie, dislocated his ankle. They spent two days as the injured for the hunting sequence seen in the second film. Soon after, they spent a month of day shoots at Helm's Deep and another three months of night shoots handled by Mahaffie, in Dry Creek Quarry outside of Wellington. Mortensen himself though would get a tooth knocked out and Hill was hit on the ear with the flat of a sword. The extras insulted each other in [[Maori Language|Maori]] and improvised stunts, primarily as those dressed in Uruk-hai prosthetics got extremely cold.<ref name="TTT SEE" />

The production got larger, with Wood and Astin shooting scenes in [[Mount Ruapehu]] for [[Emyn Muil]] and [[Mount Doom]]. On [[April 13]] [[2000]], [[Andy Serkis]] joined the cast. During this shoot, [[cross coverage]] was used for a pivotal scene in ''The Return of the King''. In the meantime, prologue scenes<ref name="Trilogy book" /> and the [[Battle of the Black Gate]] were shot, during which [[Sala Baker]] put on the [[Sauron]] armour. The latter was filmed at a former mine field in the Rangipo Desert, and soldiers served as extras.<ref name="ROTK SEE" /> The Fellowship then reunited with the return of Sean Bean, as they proceeded to shoot the Moria sequence<ref>{{cite news| last = Davidson| first = Paul| title = The Fellowship at Moria| publisher = IGN| date = 2000-05-29| url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034245p1.html| accessdate = 2006-11-14}}</ref> and the Rivendell interior, including 5 days of dull coverage for the [[Council of Elrond]].

In July they began shooting scenes with [[Cate Blanchett]] on soundstages for [[Lórien]],<ref>{{cite web| title = One Year of Principal Photography| publisher = The One Ring.net| url = http://www.theonering.net/features/exclusives/oneyear_page01.html| accessdate = 2006-10-15}}</ref> as well as a week of exterior shooting for the farewell sequence.<ref name="FOTR SEE" />

[[Edoras]] was built on Mount Sunday, and the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] was shot in [[Twizel]] with 250 horses.

As filming ended, the nine actors portraying the Fellowship got an Elven 9 tattoo, bar John Rhys-Davies, who sent his scale double. Jackson and Bernard Hill got an Elven 10, and Hill and Mortensen founded the C-Bago club, the c standing for 'cunt'. Originally, the cast members promised each other they would not show the tattoos on-camera. However, Sean Astin shows his (on his ankle) on an Oprah appearance, justifying the move by pointing out Elijah Wood showed his to Jay Leno and Orlando Bloom accidentally shows it in [[Pirates of the Caribbean]] .

===Pick-ups===
Pick-ups were conducted from 2001 to 2003 for six weeks every year to refine each film's edit. For the first two films they often returned to sets; for the third, they had to shoot around the clock in a car park full of set parts. Pick-ups provided a chance for cast and crew to meet in person again, and during ''The Two Towers'' pick-ups, [[Sean Astin]] directed a short film entitled ''[[The Long and Short of It]]''.

Notable scenes filmed in the pick-ups included ''The Two Towers'' Extended Edition's flashback with [[Boromir]], and the reshot [[Witch-king]] scenes with his new helmet design for ''The Return of the King'', the latter with improved Orc designs and the new character of [[Gothmog (Third Age)|Gothmog]]. Théoden's last scene was reshot just after he finished; Bernard Hill was still in New Zealand. Andy Serkis also had to shoot a scene in Jackson's house during post-production.

The final and only pick-up in 2004 were shots of falling skulls in ''The Return of the King'' as part of an extended [[Paths of the Dead]] scene. Jackson joked that "it's nice to win an Oscar before you've even finished the film".<ref name="ROTK SEE" />
