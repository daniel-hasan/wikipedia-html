'''Neposedi''' ({{lang-ru|Непоседы}}) is a children's music group formed in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] in 1991 by Elena Pindzhoyan and Yuri Nikolaev. The title refers to children who are unable to sit indifferently in the same place; who are fidgety.

[[Yulia Volkova]] and [[Lena Katina]] of [[t.A.T.u]] were the most successful of the group. They were both members from 1997 until 1999. Volkova claims to have been banned for smoking, drinking and swearing {{Fact|date=February 2007}}; Neposedi, however, deny this, stating she had graduated as many of the members do at a certain age. Lena ([[Lena Katina]]), of t.A.T.u., left Neposedi soon after Volkova. 

The group's first release was in 1997 titled ''[[Pust Mirom Pravit Lyubov|Пусть миpом пpaвит любовь]]'' (Pust' Mirom Pravit Lyubov'; Let love rule the world). The album included 20 tracks, both in English and Russian, with covers of "[[It's All Coming Back to Me Now]]" and "[[Can You Feel The Love Tonight]]." In the song "Looking In", the voice of [[Lena Katina]] is prominent, and Volkova has a few lines in the song as well. 

Neposedi is still together today, with ever changing members, performing in Russia. They had a notable performance at the GTSKZ "Russia" on Children's Protection Day. They sang 19 new songs, and after the performance, a CD of these songs was released, including two bonus videos.

In 2006, the group released a CD titled "To Us 15 Years!", a celebration of the group's 15 year anniversary, including a cover of the song "[[Irresistible (song)|Irresistible]]" by [[Jessica Simpson]].
