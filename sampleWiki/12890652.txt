Produced by [[Hat Trick Productions]], ''Outnumbered'' is written, directed and produced by [[Andy Hamilton]] and [[Guy Jenkin]], although the show is also semi-[[Improvisational theatre|improvised]]. Most of the improvised lines are given to the child characters, in order to make the performances more realistic.<ref name="Sun">{{cite news|last=Tyers|first=Alan|title=Hugh not reading the script|publisher=The Sun|date=2007-08-16|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2007380093,00.html|accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref>

==Plot==
''Outnumbered'' is about a family living in [[South London]], where the parents are "Outnumbered" by their three children. The parents constantly try to keep their children under control, but completely fail to do so. The father, Pete, ([[Hugh Dennis]]) works at an inner city school as a history teacher, whereas mother, Sue, ([[Claire Skinner]]) is a part-time PA.<ref name="Press Office">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/08_august/17/outnumbered_production.shtml|title=Press Office: Outnumbered|publisher=BBC|date=2007-08-17|accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref> The three children are eleven-year-old Jake ([[Tyger Drew-Honey]]) who worries about everything, from worrying about starting at his new school to the world being sucked into a [[black hole]],<ref name="S1E6">{{cite episode|title=Episode 6|series=Outnumbered|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/08_august/17/outnumbered_episode.shtml|airdate=2007-08-28|season=1|episode=6}}</ref> seven-year-old Ben ([[Daniel Roche (actor)|Daniel Roche]]) who constantly lies to his parents and always wants to watch ''[[Little Britain]]'',<ref name="S1E4">{{cite episode|title=Episode 4|series=Outnumbered|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/08_august/17/outnumbered_episode.shtml|airdate=2007-09-03|season=1|episode=1}}</ref> and five-year-old Karen ([[Ramona Marquez]]) who constantly asks too many questions.<ref name="Press Office"/><ref name="Episode Synopsis">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/08_august/17/outnumbered_episode.shtml|title=Press Office: Outnumbered Episode Synopsis|publisher=BBC|date=2007-08-17|accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref> Other characters who regularly appear include Sue's [[new age]] 44-year-old sister, Angela, ([[Samantha Bond]]) and their father, referred to as "Grandad", ([[David Ryall]]) who appears to be suffering from [[Dementia|senility]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/outnumbered/characters.shtml|title=''Outnumbered'' Characters|publisher=British Sitcom Guide|date=2007-08-28|accessdate=2007-08-28}}</ref> Another character referred to is the [[unseen character|unseen]] Veronica, a very overbearing woman that Sue works for, who constantly demands too much.

==Production==
''Outnumbered'' marks the first collaboration between Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin since ''[[Drop the Dead Donkey]]'' ended in 1998.<ref name="Press Office"/> It was commissioned by [[Lucy Lumsden]], the BBC Controller Comedy Commissioning, and the [[executive producer]] is [[Jon Rolph]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/08_august/17/outnumbered.shtml|title=Press Office: Outnumbered Introduction|publisher=BBC|date=2007-08-17|accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref>  Originally a 20-minute long pilot was made, which was given to Lumsden who then commissioned six episodes. Whilst the setting for the show is somewhere in South London, the show was shot on location in [[Wandsworth]].<ref name="Press Office"/>

''Outnumbered'' is notable for using improvisation, in order to get more believable performances from the child actors. Dennis commented on this saying that, "In most sitcoms all the lines for children are written by adults. So they are speaking the words of people 30 years older. And you really want kids to have their own voices, and say their own things."<ref name="Sun"/> Jenkin said that: "You rarely get the feeling that children in sitcoms are real. They tend to be the same type of character – the smartarse who says adult things – and they are rooted to the spot, staring at the camera, because they've been told to stand in one place and say the lines. We decided to attempt to do something that hadn't been tried before, bounced some ideas around and we got very keen on this idea of involving improvisation very quickly."<ref name="Press Office"/>

==Episodes==
The first series of ''Outnumbered'' aired on BBC One between [[28 August]] and [[5 September]] [[2007]]. Unlike most British sitcoms, where one episode is shown per week, all six episodes aired over two weeks, three per week, at 10.35pm. On Wednesdays it aired at 10.40pm due to the midweek [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|national lottery draw]]. The episodes contain recurring story lines; the main ones being Jake worrying about [[secondary school]] and later being bullied,<ref name="S1E1">{{cite episode|title=Episode 1|series=Outnumbered|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/08_august/17/outnumbered_episode.shtml|airdate=2007-08-28|season=1|episode=1}}</ref><ref name="S1E4"/> Sue's rivalry with Angela after she begins to look after Grandad,<ref name="S1E2">{{cite episode|title=Episode 2|series=Outnumbered|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/08_august/17/outnumbered_episode.shtml|airdate=2007-08-29|season=1|episode=2}}</ref> as well as her relationship with Veronica,<ref name="S1E1"/> and Pete coming into trouble with his school after he makes a supposed [[racism|racist]] comment to one of his pupils.<ref name="S1E2"/> There are also storylines about Ben's constant lying,<ref name="S1E1"/> and Karen's dislike of Angela.<ref name="S1E2"/>

==Reception==
The first episode received 4.1 million viewers (25.5%) of the audience share when it began and finished with 2.8 million (19.5%) at the end, which is larger than the average 2.2 million (14%) normally attracted by television shows at its particular time slot.<ref>{{cite web|title=News - ''Outnumbered'' starts with great ratings|publisher=British Sitcom Guide|date=[[29 August]] [[2007]]|url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/news/news.php?story=000249|accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref> The audience for the second episode however fell by half a million viewers, whilst still being the highest ranking show in its time slot, with 18% of the audience share.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dowell|first=Ben|title=Supernanny and Silent Witness take lion's share|publisher=The Guardian|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,2159092,00.html|date=2007-08-30|accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref> However, it maintained a constant audience throughout the first series, with the fourth episode attracting 2.7 million viewers (20% audience share).<ref>{{cite news|last=Dowell|first=Ben|title=Hell's Kitchen goes off boil|publisher=The Guardian|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,2162827,00.html|date=2007-09-05|accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>

Reception to the show was mixed. ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' found the mundane settings to be similar to the American sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' saying that "compared to the ridiculous carry-on of ''[[My Family]]'', it's much more low-key and realistic. In fact it's so low-key, nothing actually happens, which could well be a nod to ''Seinfeld'' - the touchstone of all great sitcoms. The getting ready for school chaos is like ''[[Supernanny]]'': The Movie only with nicer children. It's also taken a leaf out of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm|Curb Your Enthusiasm's]]'' book with large chunks of improvisation - although the strongest language you'll find here is "ponk"."<ref name="Mirror">{{cite news|title=''Outnumbered''|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=[[28 August]] [[2007]]|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/tv/todaystv/2007/08/28/outnumbered-89520-19696750/|accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref>

[[Rod Liddle]], in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', also praised the show, although he was somewhat surprised saying, "An exquisitely middle-class, middle-aged domestic situation comedy set in north London – maybe [[Crouch End]] or [[Tufnell Park]] – and starring one of those bloody stand-up comics who now festoons every network, it really should be hated before it is even seen. Start liking this sort of programme and you are an ace away from enjoying ''[[Terry and June]]'' and having a house that smells faintly of weak tea, Murray Mints and urine. So, maybe it's just me, but ''Outnumbered'' is very funny indeed: despite its current bout of self-flagellation, the BBC still knows how to make people laugh. Comedy may be the very last thing the corporation does well."<ref>{{cite news|last=Liddle|first=Rod|authorlink=Rod Liddle|title=The cheap laughs are the best|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article2350447.ece|publisher=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=2007-09-02|accessdate=2007-09-02}}</ref>

James Walton wrote in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that the domestic setting and more mundane storylines were a virtue, saying, "All of this feels both carefully observed and suspiciously heartfelt. More unusually, it’s not contrived. ''Outnumbered'' sticks firmly with the mundane, yet manages to be funny about it. It doesn’t avoid the sheer dullness involved in family life either – but, happily, depicts it with a winning mixture of exasperation and affection."<ref name="Telegraph"/>

However, Kevin Maher of ''[[The Times]]'' attacked the quality of the programme, saying it is not funny or dramatic enough. He wrote, "''Outnumbered'' was at its most meretricious. For every exchange between adult and child was hijacked by a crass sitcommy need for sotto voce punchlines and knowing winks to the wings. A protracted scene in which 45-year-old dad (Hugh Dennis) was unable to wrestle a live power drill from the hands of 7-year-old son Ben (Daniel Roche), and instead had to, ho-ho, pay him £5 for the privilege, was emblematic of the show’s dubious capacity for fake pay-offs."<ref name="Times"/>

Walton criticised the scheduling of the programme saying, "Despite the very specific London setting, the series (shown in two batches of three, this week and next) will surely appeal to the parents of young children everywhere. As long, that is, as they’re not asleep by 10.35pm."<ref name="Telegraph"/>

''Outnumbered'' is currently nominated for the 2008 "''[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]'' Award" for "Best Comedy Programme".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/news/news.php?story=000347|title=News - Broadcast Awards 2008 shortlist revealed|publisher=British Sitcom Guide|language=English|date=2007-12-10|accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref>
