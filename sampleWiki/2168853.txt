'''Charles Scott''' (1739 &ndash; [[October 22]] [[1813]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[soldier]] and [[politician]] who served as [[Governor of Kentucky]] from 1808 to 1812. Orphaned at an early age, Scott participated in the [[French and Indian War]], serving under [[Edward Braddock]] and [[George Washington]]. He again served under Washington during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], weathering the winter at [[Valley Forge]] and serving as Washington's chief of intelligence during later campaigns.

Following the revolution, Scott moved to [[Kentucky]] where he participated in a number of [[Northwest Indian War|skirmishes]] with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], including the decisive [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]]. He parlayed his military success into political gain, serving as a [[United States Electoral College|presidential elector]] in [[United States presidential election, 1792|1793]], [[United States presidential election, 1800|1801]], and [[United States presidential election, 1808|1809]], and serving as Kentucky's fourth governor from 1808 to 1812. His most significant achievement as governor was preparing the state militia to participate in the [[War of 1812]], including the elevation of [[William Henry Harrison]] to command the militia. During his first year in office, Scott was injured in a fall and left on crutches for the remainder of his life; consequently, he relied heavily on [[Jesse Bledsoe]], his [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], to perform the routine duties of the office.

Scott retired to "Canewood," his home in [[Clark County, Kentucky|Clark County]], following his term as governor. He died there on [[October 22]] [[1813]], and was buried in a family plot before being re-interred at [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] in 1854. [[Scott County, Kentucky]], [[Scott County, Indiana]], and [[Scottsville, Virginia]] were all named in honor of Governor Scott.

==Personal life==
Scott was born in [[Goochland County, Virginia]], in the area that became [[Powhatan County, Virginia|Powhatan County]]. His father, Samuel Scott, and his grandfather, Captain John Scott, were both [[vestry]]men of St. Peter's Parish.<ref name=powell20>Powell, p. 20</ref> Samuel Scott was also a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], and his death in 1755 left the younger Scott an orphan.<ref name=ward16>Ward, p. 16</ref> Charles Scott was educated in the rural schools of Virginia.

On [[February 25]] [[1762]], Scott married Frances Sweeney of [[Cumberland County, Virginia]]; the couple settled in [[Woodford County, Kentucky]] and had eight children, one of whom was a twin believed to have died in infancy.<ref name=powell20 /><ref name=ward16 /> With the help of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] owned by his wife, Scott ran a mill on a large land plot near [[Muddy Creek (Virginia)|Muddy Creek]] and the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]].<ref name=ward18 />

At the outset of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], Scott raised a company of [[Virginia militia]] and commanded them in the [[December 9]] [[1775]] [[Battle of Great Bridge]].<ref name=ward16 /> In 1776 he was commissioned a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the [[2nd Virginia Regiment]] of the [[Continental Army]], rising to the rank of [[colonel]] later in 1776 and [[brigadier general]] in 1777.<ref name=powell20 /> He served under George Washington from 1776 to 1778, and was his chief of intelligence toward the end of this period.<ref name=harrison804 /> He participated in both the [[Battle of Trenton|first]] and [[Second Battle of Trenton|second battles of Trenton]] and weathered the winter of 1777&ndash;78 at [[Valley Forge]].<ref name=powell20 /><ref name=ward17>Ward, p. 17</ref> His unit fought in the battles of [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]], [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]], and [[Battle of Monmouth|Monmouth]], but their major engagement was the [[February 1]] [[Battle of Drake's Farm]].<ref name=ward17 />

He was captured by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] at [[Siege of Charleston|Fall of Charleston]] in 1780, and was held [[prisoner of war|prisoner]] for two years. He was [[parole]]d in March 1781 and exchanged for [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Rawdon]] in July 1782.<ref name=ward17 /> For his service, he was [[brevet (military)|brevetted]] to the rank of [[major general]] in 1783.

In 1785 Scott visited Kentucky, and he moved to [[Woodford County, Kentucky|Woodford County]] near [[Versailles, Kentucky|Versailles]] in 1787. He dreamed of founding a settlement on his land called "Petersburg" and having it become the state capital.<ref name=ward17 /> In 1790, [[President of the United States|President]] Washington appointed Scott to a military board in Kentucky to investigate the need for armed frontier troops to quell Indian attacks.<ref name=powell20 /> He and [[James Wilkinson]] were given charge of the Kentucky militia, and Scott participated in the [[Northwest Indian War|Indian wars]] to the north of Kentucky.<ref name=powell20 /> Two of his sons were killed in these wars.<ref name=harrison804 /> Scott commanded the Kentucky forces in [[Arthur St. Clair|St. Clair]]'s campaign in 1791, including the disastrous [[Battle of the Wabash]]. On [[August 20]] [[1794]], he participated in the American victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]].<ref name=harrison804 />

==Political career==
Scott's first foray into the political arena came in 1789, when he served one term in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], representing Woodford County. In 1792, the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] created a new county from Woodford County and named it [[Scott County, Kentucky|Scott County]] in honor of General Scott. He was also chosen as a presidential elector in 1793, 1801, and 1809.<ref name=powell20 />

In 1808, Scott was elected governor of Kentucky by a wide margin over [[John Allen (soldier)|John Allen]] and [[Green Clay]]. He was injured in a fall on the icy steps of the [[Kentucky Governor's Mansion|governor's mansion]] during his first year in office, leaving him on crutches for the rest of his life. His handicap forced him to rely heavily on [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]] [[Jesse Bledsoe]] throughout his term; Bledsoe often delivered the governor's messages to the legislature. In preparation for the impending [[War of 1812]], Scott brevetted [[William Henry Harrison]] to the rank of [[major general]] in the state's militia, and raised an additional 1,400 recruits to serve under him.<ref name=ward18>Ward, p. 18</ref>

Following his term as governor, Scott retired from public life to "Canewood," his farm in Clark County, where he died [[October 22]] [[1813]].<ref name=harrison804 /> He was originally buried in a private family cemetery, but was re-interred at Frankfort Cemetery in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] in 1854. Besides Scott County in Kentucky, [[Scott County, Indiana]] and [[Scottsville, Virginia]] are named in honor of Governor Scott.<ref name=powell20 />
