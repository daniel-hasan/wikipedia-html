The '''3rd [[congressional district|Congressional District]] of [[Illinois]]''' includes part of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], and has been represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Dan Lipinski]] since January 2005; the district was previously represented by his father [[Bill Lipinski]] beginning in 1993. This district includes [[Chicago metropolitan area|west and southwest suburbs]] of [[Chicago]] as far as the [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] border, as well as a portion of the southwest side of the city of Chicago itself, and covers 124.5 [[square mile]]s (322.45 [[square kilometre|km²]]), making it one of the [[List of United States congressional districts by area|50 smallest districts]] in the U.S., although there are five smaller districts in Illinois. It is adjacent to the [[Illinois' 1st congressional district|1st District]] to the east and south, the [[Illinois' 4th congressional district|4th District]] to the north, and the [[Illinois' 13th congressional district|13th District]] to the west, and also borders the [[Illinois' 6th congressional district|6th]] and [[Illinois' 7th congressional district|7th Districts]] at its northwest and northeast corners respectively. The district was created following the [[United States Census, 1830|1830 Census]] and came into being in 1833, five months before Chicago was organized as a town; it initially included [[northern Illinois|northern]] and [[Forgottonia|western Illinois]]<ref name=ParsonsI>{{cite book |last=Parsons |first=Stanley B. |coauthors=William W.

Although the district has elected Democrats to [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]] in 24 of the last 25 elections, and has voted for the Democratic nominee in the last four [[United States presidential election|presidential races]], there is also a strong tradition of [[social conservatism]] in the area which has resulted in the election of [[conservative Democrat]]s, as well as greater support for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] than might be expected based on voter identification by party.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

==Geography==
The 3rd District includes the municipalities of [[Bedford Park, Illinois|Bedford Park]], [[Bridgeview, Illinois|Bridgeview]], [[Burbank, Illinois|Burbank]], [[Chicago Ridge, Illinois|Chicago Ridge]], [[Countryside, Illinois|Countryside]], [[Forest View, Illinois|Forest View]], [[Hickory Hills, Illinois|Hickory Hills]], [[Hodgkins, Illinois|Hodgkins]], [[Hometown, Illinois|Hometown]], [[Indian Head Park, Illinois|Indian Head Park]], [[Justice, Illinois|Justice]], [[La Grange, Illinois|La Grange]], [[La Grange Park, Illinois|La Grange Park]], [[Lyons, Illinois|Lyons]], [[McCook, Illinois|McCook]], [[Merrionette Park, Illinois|Merrionette Park]], [[Oak Lawn, Illinois|Oak Lawn]], [[Palos Hills, Illinois|Palos Hills]], [[Riverside, Illinois|Riverside]], [[Stickney, Illinois|Stickney]], [[Summit, Illinois|Summit]] and [[Western Springs, Illinois|Western Springs]], nearly all of [[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]], [[Brookfield, Illinois|Brookfield]] and [[Willow Springs, Illinois|Willow Springs]], and parts of [[Alsip, Illinois|Alsip]], [[Burr Ridge, Illinois|Burr Ridge]], [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]], [[Forest Park, Illinois|Forest Park]], [[Hillside, Illinois|Hillside]], [[North Riverside, Illinois|North Riverside]], [[Palos Heights, Illinois|Palos Heights]], [[Palos Park, Illinois|Palos Park]], [[Westchester, Illinois|Westchester]] and [[Worth, Illinois|Worth]].

In Chicago, it includes the communities of [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]] (home of mayor [[Richard M. Daley]] until he relocated in the late 1990s to the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]]'s [[Central Station (Chicago neighborhood)|Central Station]] development), [[Clearing, Chicago|Clearing]], [[Garfield Ridge, Chicago|Garfield Ridge]], [[Mount Greenwood, Chicago|Mount Greenwood]] and [[West Lawn, Chicago|West Lawn]]; almost all of [[Beverly, Chicago|Beverly]]; those portions of [[Archer Heights, Chicago|Archer Heights]] and [[West Elsdon, Chicago|West Elsdon]] west of Pulaski Road; the western portions of [[Ashburn, Chicago|Ashburn]], [[Chicago Lawn, Chicago|Chicago Lawn]] and [[Morgan Park, Chicago|Morgan Park]]; the portion of [[McKinley Park, Chicago|McKinley Park]] south of Archer Avenue; parts of [[Gage Park, Chicago|Gage Park]] and [[New City, Chicago|New City]]; and a small section (1/16 m²) of [[Armour Square, Chicago|Armour Square]].

==Demographics==
The 3rd District, situated between the Hispanic-majority 4th District to the north and the black-majority 1st and 7th Districts to the east, is the home of numerous sizable and historic [[Maps of American ancestries|ethnic groups]] including [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Polish American|Polish]], [[German American|German]], [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Czech American|Czech]] immigrants and their descendants. At 14.2%, the Irish make up the largest [[white people|white]] ethnic group in the district,<ref name=Ethnic3rd>{{cite book |last=Tarr |first=David R.

Of the suburbs primarily south of 87th Street (in [[Palos Township, Cook County, Illinois|Palos]] and [[Worth Township, Cook County, Illinois|Worth Townships]]), 9 of 10 have larger Irish than Polish populations, usually by large margins; but north of 87th Street, in those areas in [[Lyons Township, Cook County, Illinois|Lyons Township]] south of [[Interstate 55]] or in the townships to the east of Harlem Avenue, 9 of 10 suburbs have greater Polish populations than Irish, again by large margins. In Oak Lawn, the district's largest suburb, Irish outnumber Polish 30%-19%; in neighboring Burbank, the district's third largest suburb, Polish outnumber Irish by an identical margin.

More recently a large [[Mexican American|Mexican]] community has moved to the district, notably in Berwyn, Cicero, Hodgkins and Summit where they represent over 30% of the population, and along [[Archer Avenue (Chicago)|Archer Avenue]], a major Chicago artery that runs through the district's northern section.<ref name=Barone2002 /> There is also a sizable [[Greek American|Greek]] community in Oak Lawn and Palos Hills. In the last two decades, there has been notable [[Arab American|Arab]] settlement in the vicinity of Bridgeview, and by the 2000 Census, Arabs represented one of the five largest non-Hispanic ethnic groups in Bridgeview and three adjacent suburbs. Approximately 41% of the district's residents live in Chicago. 21% of the district's population is Hispanic, with 68% white (non-Hispanic), 6% [[African American]] and 3% of [[Asian American|Asian]] descent; redistricting following the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 Census]] and the continued influx of Hispanics tripled the minority population from a decade earlier, as the district in its previous configuration had a population that was 7% Hispanic, 2% African American and 1% Asian.<ref name=Barone1998>{{cite book |last=Barone |first=Michael |coauthors=Grant Ujifusa, Richard E.

==Economy==
The district is a historic U.S. [[Transportation in the United States|transportation]] and [[shipping]] hub; not only does it include [[Chicago Midway International Airport]], but it is also traversed by the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]], the [[Calumet River#Cal-Sag Channel|Calumet Sag Channel]], and the [[Des Plaines River]], earning national designations for the [[Chicago Portage]] [[Chicago Portage National Historic Site|National Historic Site]] in Forest View and the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] [[U.S. National Heritage Area|National Heritage Corridor]]. The [[U.S. Route 66 in Illinois|path]] of historic [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] runs southwest through the district from its eastern end in Chicago. [[Interstate 55]] intersects with both the [[Tri-State Tollway]] ([[Interstate 294]]) and the [[Dan Ryan Expressway]] ([[Interstate 90]]/[[Interstate 94|94]]) in the district, and in 2001 &ndash; since which time the district has shifted slightly to the northwest &ndash; it was noted as likely having more freight yards and [[Rail transport in the United States|railroad crossings]] than any other district.<ref name=Barone2002/>

The district includes [[Toyota Park (Bridgeview)|Toyota Park]], home of the [[Chicago Fire (soccer)|Chicago Fire]] team in [[Major League Soccer]] and the [[Chicago Machine]] team in [[Major League Lacrosse]], as well as [[Hawthorne Race Course]]; the area also benefits from [[Chicago White Sox]] home games at [[U.S. Cellular Field]], which is less than 1000 feet beyond the district's border. Portions of the [[Cook County Forest Preserves]] cover several square miles in the district's southwest corner. Cultural attractions include [[Brookfield Zoo]] and the [[Balzekas Museum of Lithuanian Culture]] in West Lawn; educational institutions include [[St. Xavier University]] in Mount Greenwood, [[Moraine Valley Community College]] in Palos Hills, [[Morton College]] in Cicero, and [[Richard J. Daley College]], a [[City Colleges of Chicago|Chicago city college]], in West Lawn; and medical facilities include [[Advocate Christ Medical Center]] in Oak Lawn, [[Adventist La Grange Memorial Hospital]] in La Grange and [[MacNeal Hospital]] in Berwyn. Industrial and business presences in the district include: [[Tootsie Roll|Tootsie Roll Industries]]; [[Electro-Motive Diesel]]; a [[Nabisco]] bakery which is the largest biscuit bakery in the world [https://www.kraftoperations.com/Facility.asp?FacilityID=93]; the [[CACH|Chicago Area Consolidation Hub]] of [[United Parcel Service]] and adjacent [[BNSF Railway]] yard [http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&id=549]; an ACH Food manufacturing plant (formerly part of Corn Products Company) in Summit [http://www.achfood.com/careers.aspx?type=sum]; an [[Owens Corning]] roofing and asphalt plant in Summit; and a [[Nalco Holding Company|Nalco Chemical]] plant in Bedford Park. The former site of the [[International Amphitheatre]], now an [[ARAMARK|Aramark]] plant, is within the district. Organizations based in the district include the [[American Nuclear Society]] in La Grange Park. Among the federal facilities in the district is the Great Lakes Regional Headquarters of the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] [http://www.archives.gov/great-lakes/chicago/] in West Lawn.

==Politics==
The 3rd District has been described as "ancestrally Democratic, [[cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]], multiethnic and viscerally [[patriotism|patriotic]]."<ref name=Barone2005>{{cite book |last=Barone |first=Michael |coauthors=Richard E.

[[George W. Bush]] received 41% of the vote here in both [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] despite not exceeding 21% in any of the other four south side districts; it was his best performance in any district located primarily within Cook County. Much of the district's current suburban territory was in the [[Illinois' 4th congressional district|4th District]] from the 1950s to the 1970s, when that was a solidly Republican suburban district represented by [[Ed Derwinski]]; more recently, [[Lyons Township, Cook County, Illinois|Lyons]], [[Palos Township, Cook County, Illinois|Palos]] and [[Riverside Township, Cook County, Illinois|Riverside Townships]], which together approximately correspond with the district's western half, all voted for Bush in 2000.<ref>''Congressional Districts in the 2000s: A Portrait of America'', p. 300.</ref> Over the last eight presidential elections, the Democratic nominee for Congress has run an average of [[split-ticket voting|20 points ahead]] of the party's nominee for president in the district.<ref>Based on results from 1976 through 2004 in the ''Guide to U.S. Elections''.</ref>

Redistricting which took effect for the [[United States House elections, 1992|1992 elections]] kept only 40% of the district's previous area, and pitted nine-term incumbent Russo &ndash; who changed his residence rather than run in the [[Illinois' 2nd congressional district|2nd District]], which now included his previous home &ndash; against five-term incumbent [[Bill Lipinski]], who had previously represented the [[Illinois' 5th congressional district|5th District]], in the Democratic primary.

[[Image:Danlipinski.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rep. Dan Lipinski]]
The district's seat changed hands under somewhat controversial circumstances in [[United States House elections, 2004|2004]]. Lipinski was renominated in the primary election, but in August announced his intention to withdraw from the race, just two weeks before the deadline for replacing a candidate on the ballot. Four days later, the district's ward and township committeemen &ndash; including Lipinski himself as well as Mayor Daley's brother [[John P. Daley|John]] and [[Illinois House of Representatives|Illinois House]] Speaker [[Michael Madigan]] &ndash; met to choose a replacement; Lipinski nominated his son [[Dan Lipinski|Dan]], an assistant professor at the [[University of Tennessee]], and he was approved without opposition despite not having lived in Illinois since 1989. In his initial campaign, the younger Lipinski stated that his policies made him "not really that different from" his father, and indicated that he would oppose [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] as well as abortion except when the mother's life was at stake. True to the district's heritage, he identified Reagan as his political hero.<ref>Barone, et al. (2005), pp. 567-568.</ref>

Since taking office, Dan Lipinski has continued his father's pro-life stance, voting with Republicans to give federal courts jurisdiction in the [[Government involvement in the Terri Schiavo case#U.S. Congress|Terri Schiavo case]], and to maintain restrictions on federal funding for [[stem cell controversy|embryonic stem cell research]].<ref name=Key>{{cite web |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/l000563/key-votes/ |title=Key Votes by Daniel Lipinski |accessdate=2007-04-18 |publisher=The Washington Post }}</ref> Among the legislation he has sponsored is the Family and Consumer Choice Act (HR 2738 IH), which would require [[Cable television in the United States|cable television]] companies to either provide subscribers with increased options of channel selection or comply with the same [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] decency standards that apply to broadcasters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070614/tv_nm/indecency_congress_dc_4 |title=House bill aims to curb indecent TV programs |accessdate=2007-06-21 |last=Younglai |first=Rachelle |publisher=Reuters |date=[[2007-06-14]] }}</ref> He has voted to [[H.R. 4437|strengthen border security]], with no provisions for citizenship for [[United States immigration debate|illegal immigrants]], and to build a [[Secure Fence Act of 2006|700-mile fence]] along the Mexican border. In December 2005 he voted to make the [[USA PATRIOT Act|Patriot Act]] permanent. In June 2006 he joined Republicans in opposing a timetable for [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|troop withdrawal from Iraq]] and declaring the Iraq War to be a part of the [[War on Terrorism]]. Although in March 2007 he voted with Democrats in supporting a war spending bill which would establish a timetable, in May he voted for a spending bill which favored benchmarks rather than a timetable.<ref name=Key/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/IL/Dan_Lipinski.htm |title=Dan Lipinski on the Issues |accessdate=2007-04-18 }}</ref>
