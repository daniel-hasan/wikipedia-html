{{Politics of New Zealand}}
Members of [[New Zealand]]'s [[New Zealand Parliament|House of Representatives]], commonly called "[[Parliament]]", normally gain their parliamentary  [[legislative seat|seats]] through nationwide general [[election]]s, or (less frequently) in [[by-election]]s. General elections normally occur at least every three years in New Zealand, and operate using the [[Electoral system of New Zealand|Mixed Member Proportional electoral system]]. The [[Chief Electoral Office (New Zealand)|Chief Electoral Office]] and the [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] co-ordinate the electoral system.

== Overview of elections ==
=== Voting ===

New Zealand general elections occur when the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] requests a dissolution of Parliament and therefore a general election. Theoretically, this can happen at any time, although a convention exists whereby Prime Ministers do not call elections unless they have no reasonable alternative.

Elections always take place on a Saturday, so as to minimise work-commitments inhibiting people from voting. Voting (the casting of ballots) happens at various [[polling station]]s, generally established in schools, churches, or other such public places. The 2005 election made use of 6,094 such polling stations.

The voting process uses printed voting ballots, with voters marking their choices (one vote for a candidate and one vote for a party — see [[Electoral system of New Zealand]]) with an ink pen provided for their use. The voter then places the voting paper in a sealed [[ballot box]]. Voters can alternatively cast "special votes" if genuinely unable to attend a regular polling place (for example, if they have travelled overseas, or have impaired mobility).

=== Timing of elections ===
New Zealand general elections generally occur every three years. Unlike some other countries, New Zealand has no fixed election-date, but rather the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] determines the timing of general elections. Convention dictates that a general election should take place roughly three years after the previous general election — unless a major crisis arises or the Prime Minister loses the ability to command a majority in parliament. The 1930s and 1940s saw two elections delayed due to the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], respectively: the [[New Zealand general election 1935|1935]] and [[New Zealand general election 1943|1943]] elections, which would normally taken place in 1934 and 1941.

Early or [[snap election|"snap" elections]] have occurred at least three times in New Zealand's history: in [[New Zealand general election 1951|1951]], [[New Zealand general election 1984|1984]] and [[New Zealand general election 2002|2002]]. Early elections often provoke controversy, as they potentially give governing paqrties an advantage over opposition candidates. Note that of the three elections in which the government won an increased majority, two involved snap elections (1951 and 2002) — the other incumbent-boosting election took place in [[New Zealand general election 1938|1938]]). The 1984 snap election backfired on the government of the day: many believe that the Prime Minister, [[Robert Muldoon]], called it while drunk.<ref>[http://www.salient.co.nz/index.php?a=1894&c=17 REHABILITATED: TOM SCOTT]</ref><ref>[http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_politics_story_skin/34506 Sips causing political slips]</ref> ''See [[Snap election#New Zealand]].''

The Prime Minister's power to determine the election date can give the government some subtle advantages. For example, if governing parties believe that a section of the population will either vote against them or not at all, they might hold the election in early spring, when the weather may well keep less-committed voters away from the polls. Party strategists take the timing of important [[rugby union]] matches into account, partly because a major match in the same weekend of the election will likely lower voting-levels, and partly because of a wide-spread belief that incumbent governments benefit from a surge of national pride when the [[All Blacks]] (the New Zealand national rugby team) win and suffer when they lose. 

Tradition associates elections with November — give or take a few weeks. After disruptions to the 36-month cycle, Prime Ministers tend to strive to restore it to a November base. Barring crises, the  [[as of 2007|next]]  [[New Zealand general election, 2008|general election]] should occur before Saturday [[15 November]] [[2008]].

=== Electoral roll ===
The [[electoral roll]] consists of a register of all eligible voters, organised (primarily alphabetically by surname) within electorates. All persons who meet the requirements for voting must by law register on the electoral roll, even if they do not intend to vote. The roll records the name,  address and stated [[wikt:occupation|occupation]] of all voters, although individual electors can apply for "unpublished" status on the roll in special circumstances, such as when having their details printed in the electoral roll could threaten their [[personal safety]].

=== Electorates ===
New Zealanders refer to voting districts as "[[New Zealand electorates|electorates]]", or as "seats". New Zealand [[as of 2006|currently]] has sixty-nine electorates (including seven [[Māori seats|Māori electorates]] specially set up for people of [[Māori]] ethnicity or ancestry who choose to place themselves on a separate electoral roll). All electorates have roughly the same number of people in them — the Representation Commission periodically reviews and alters electorate boundaries to preserve this approximate balance. The number of people per electorate depends on the population of the [[South Island]] — this, the less populous of the country's two main islands, has sixteen guaranteed electorates, so the ideal number of people per electorate equals the population of the South Island divided by sixteen. From this, the Commission determines the number of [[North Island]], Māori and list seats, which may fluctuate accordingly.

Supplementing the geographically-based electorate seats, the system  [[as of 2007|currently]] allows for fifty-one at-large "list seats". A nation-wide "party-vote" fills these seats from lists submitted by political parties; they serve to make a party's total share of seats in parliament reflect its share of the party vote. For example, if a party wins 20% of the party vote, but only ten electorate seats, it will win fourteen list-seats, so that it has a total of 24 seats: 20% of the 120 seats in parliament. (For further explanation see [[Electoral system of New Zealand]].)

=== Vote-counting and announcement ===
Polling places close at 7.00pm on election day. The process of the counting of the votes by polling officials then begins. Results (at this stage provisional ones) go to a central office in the capital, [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]], for announcement as they arrive. In recent years, a dedicated official website, "[http://www.electionresults.govt.nz www.electionresults.govt.nz]" has provided "live" election-result updates. Electoral officers generally complete the provisional counting of ordinary votes on the night of the election, but counting of special votes (see "Voting") can take longer, occasionally producing surprise upsets. In [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999]] the provisional result indicated that neither the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]] or [[New Zealand First]] would qualify for Parliament, but both parties qualified on the strength of extra special votes, and the so-called "major parties" ended up with fewer list seats than expected. The final results of the election become official when confirmed by the Chief Electoral Officer.

== History of voting in New Zealand ==

::''Main article: [[History of voting in New Zealand]]''

The first national elections in New Zealand took place in [[1853]], the year after the [[United Kingdom|British]] government passed the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]]. Note that New Zealand claims to have become the first country in the world to have granted women's suffrage, although the accuracy of this claim depends on the definitions used (see [[Women's suffrage]]).

=== General elections ===
The following table lists all  [[as of 2007|previous]] general elections held in New Zealand (note that elections for Māori seats initially took place at different times from elections for general seats). The table displays the dates of the elections, the officially recorded voter turnout, and the number of seats in Parliament at the time. On the right the table shows the number of seats won by the four most dominant parties in New Zealand's history (the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] and the [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]], which later merged to form the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], and the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]), as well as the number won by other candidates (either independents or members of smaller political parties).
