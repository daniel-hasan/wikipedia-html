==History==
{{main|History of Detroit}}
The city name comes from the Detroit River (in French ''le détroit du Lac Erie''), meaning "the strait of Lake Erie," linking [[Lake Huron]] and [[Lake Erie]], in the historical context the strait included [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]] and the [[St. Clair River]].<ref name=RivièreduDétroit>{{cite web

}}</ref> Traveling up the Detroit River on the ship ''[[Le Griffon]]'' (owned by [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]]), Father [[Louis Hennepin]] noted the north bank of the river as an ideal location for a settlement. There, in 1701, the French officer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] founded a settlement called ''[[Fort Detroit|Fort Détroit]]'', naming it after the [[comte de Pontchartrain]], Minister of Marine under [[Louis XIV]]. Francois Marie Picoté, sieur de Belestre (Montreal 1719–1793) was the last French military commander at Fort Detroit (1758–1760), surrendering the fort on [[November 29]] [[1760]] to the British.

During the French and Indian War (1760), [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops gained control and shortened the name to ''Detroit''.
Several tribes led by [[Chief Pontiac]],
an [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]] leader, launched [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] (1763), including a [[siege of Fort Detroit]]. Partially in response to this, the British [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], included restrictions in unceded Indian territories. Detroit passed to the [[United States]] under the [[Jay Treaty]] (1796). In 1805, fire destroyed most of the settlement. A river warehouse and brick chimneys of the wooden homes were the sole structures to survive.<ref>[http://www.ste-anne.org/dempsey.html Ste. Anne of Detroit] ''St. Anne Church''. Retrieved on April 29, 2006.</ref> Detroit's city flag reflects this French heritage. (See [[Flag of Detroit, Michigan]].)

[[Image:Map image detroit.jpg|thumb|Detroit in the 1880s.]]

From 1805 to 1847, Detroit was the capital of Michigan. As the city expanded, the street layout followed a plan developed by [[Augustus B. Woodward]], Chief Justice of the [[Michigan Territory]]. Detroit fell to British troops during the [[War of 1812]] in the [[Siege of Detroit]], was recaptured by the United States in 1813 and incorporated as a city in 1815. Prior to the [[American Civil War]], the city's access to the Canadian border made it a key stop along the [[underground railroad]].<ref>Blockson, Charles and Chase, Henry (April 2005).

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was founded in 1851 in nearby [[Jackson, Michigan]] by anti-slavery and Former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] [[Zachariah Chandler]].  Then Lieutenant, the Future president [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was stationed in the city.  His dwelling is still at the Michigan State Fairgrounds.  Because of this local sentiment, many Detroiters volunteered to fight during the American Civil War, beginning with the "Iron Brigade" which defended Washington, D.C. early in the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln is quoted as saying "Thank God for Michigan"!  Following the death of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George Armstrong Custer]] delivered a eulogy to the thousands gathered near [[Campus Martius Park]]. Custer led the [[Michigan Brigade]] during the American Civil War and called them the "Wolverines."<ref>Rosentreter, Roger (July/August 1998). "Come on you Wolverines, Michigan at Gettysburg." ''[[Michigan History magazine]]''.</ref>

Detroit's many [[Gilded Age]] mansions and buildings arose during the late 1800s. The city was referred to as the ''"Paris of the West"'' for its architecture, and for Washington Boulevard, recently electrified by [[Thomas Edison]].<ref>Woodford, Arthur M. (2001). This is Detroit: 1701–2001. ''Wayne State University Press.''</ref> Strategically located along the [[Great Lakes]] waterway, Detroit emerged as a transportation hub. The city had grown steadily from the 1830s with the rise of shipping, shipbuilding, and manufacturing industries. In 1896, a thriving carriage trade prompted [[Henry Ford]] to build his first [[automobile]] in a rented workshop on Mack Avenue, and in 1904, the [[Ford Motor Company]] was founded. Ford's manufacturing — and those of automotive pioneers [[William C. Durant]], the [[Dodge]] brothers, and [[Walter Chrysler]]—reinforced Detroit's status as the world's automotive capital; it also served to encourage [[truck]] manufacturers such as [[Rapid (truck manufacturer)|Rapid]] and [[Grabowsky]]. The industry spurred the city's spectacular growth during the first half of the [[20th century|twentieth century]] as it drew many new residents, particularly workers from the [[Southern United States]]. Strained racial relations were evident in the trial of Dr. [[Ossian Sweet]], a black Detroit physician acquitted of murder after he shot into a large mob when he moved from the all-black part of the city to an all-white area.<ref>Zacharias, Patricia (February 12, 2001).

Labor strife climaxed in the 1930s when the [[United Auto Workers]] became involved in bitter disputes with Detroit's auto manufacturers. The labor activism of those years brought notoriety to union leaders such as [[Jimmy Hoffa]] and [[Walter Reuther]]. The 1940s saw the construction of the world's first urban depressed freeway, [[M-8 (Michigan highway)|the Davison]]<ref>[http://www.michiganhighways.org/listings/MichHwys01-09.html#M-008 Michigan Highways].

The city faced major challenges during the war as tens of thousands of workers migrated to the city to work in the war industries. Many of these migrant workers were blacks and whites from the U.S. south. Housing was difficult to find. The "color blind" promotion policies of the auto plants resulted in racial tension that erupted into a full-scale riot in 1943.<ref>Baulch, Vivian M. and Patricia Zacharias (February 11, 1999).

With [[white flight]] to the suburbs, many Detroit inner-city neighborhoods endured a painful decline from the 1960s and 1970s leaving many areas of the inner-city with [[urban blight]]. The [[12th Street Riot|Twelfth Street riot]] in 1967 and [[Desegregation busing|court-ordered busing]] accelerated white flight from the city. An extensive freeway system constructed in the 1950s and 1960s facilitated [[commuting]]. The percentage of black residents increased rapidly thereafter. Accordingly, the city's tax base began a steep decline. Retailers and small business owners departed the city in the wake of the increased crime rate. Within a few years large numbers of buildings and homes were abandoned, many remaining for decades in a state of decay. In 1973, the city elected its first black mayor, [[Coleman Young]]. Young's chaotic style during his five terms in office was not well received by many whites, who continued to leave the city in large numbers.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/US/9711/29/young.obit.pm/ Detroit's 'great warrior,' Coleman Young, dies (November 29, 1997)]. ''CNN.com''.</ref>

The gasoline crises of [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]] shook the U.S. auto industry as small cars from foreign makers made inroads into the traditional dominance of the domestic [[automakers]]. High-paying manufacturing jobs became scarce. Acute [[heroin]] and [[crack cocaine]] use afflicted the city with the influence of [[Young Boys Inc.|Butch Jones]], Maserati Rick, and the [[Chambers Brothers (gang)|Chambers Brothers]]. Drug-related violence and property crimes rose, and many abandoned homes were demolished as they had become havens for [[drug dealer]]s. Sizable tracts have reverted to a form of [[urban prairie]] with wild animals spotted migrating into the city.<ref>[http://www.detroitblog.org/?p=287 Wild Kingdom]. ''Detroit Blog''. Retrieved on March 8, 2006.</ref> "Renaissance" has been a perennial buzzword among city leaders since the [[12th Street Riot|Twelfth Street riot]] and was reinforced by the construction of the [[Renaissance Center]] in the late 1970s. This complex of skyscrapers, designed as a "city within a city," was unable to reverse the trend of businesses leaving the city's downtown.

In 1980, Detroit hosted the [[Republican National Convention]] which nominated [[Ronald Reagan]] to a successful bid for [[President of the United States]]. Four years later, the city again appeared on the national radar, but for unwanted reasons: rioting in the wake of the [[Detroit Tigers]]' [[World Series]] championship left three dead and millions of dollars in property damage.

In the 1990s, the city began to enjoy a revival, much of it centered downtown. [[Comerica Tower|Comerica Tower at Detroit Center]] (1992) arose on the city skyline. In the ensuing years, three casinos opened in Detroit: [[MGM Grand Detroit]], [[Motor City Casino]], and [[Greektown Casino]] which are now adding resorts. New downtown stadiums were constructed for the [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Detroit Lions]] in 2000 and 2002, respectively; this put the Lions' home stadium in the city proper for the first time since 1974. The city hosted the 2005 [[MLB All-Star Game]] and the 2006 [[Super Bowl XL]], both of which prompted many improvements to the downtown area. The city's riverfront is the focus of much development; in 2007, the first portions of the [[Detroit River Walk]] were laid, including miles of parks and fountains. This new [[urban development in Detroit]] is a mainstay in the city's earnest desire to reinvent its economic identity through tourism.<ref>Bailey, Ruby L.(August 22, 2007). The D is a draw: Most suburbanites are repeat visitors.''Detroit Free Press''. New Detroit Free Press-Local 4 poll conducted by Selzer and Co., finds, "nearly two-thirds of residents of suburban Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties say they at least occasionally dine, attend cultural events or take in professional games in Detroit."</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 143.0 square miles (370.2 [[square kilometre|km²]]); of this, 138.8 square miles (359.4&nbsp;km²) is land and 4.2 square miles (10.8&nbsp;km²) is water. The highest elevation in Detroit is in the University District neighborhood in northwestern Detroit, just west of Palmer Park sitting at a height of 670&nbsp;feet (204&nbsp;m). Detroit's lowest elevation is along its riverfront, sitting at a height of 579&nbsp;feet (176&nbsp;m). Detroit completely encircles the cities of [[Hamtramck, Michigan|Hamtramck]] and [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]]. On its northeast border are the wealthy communities of [[Grosse Pointe]].  The [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]] is the only international [[wildlife preserve]] in [[North America]], uniquely located in the heart of a major metropolitan area. The Refuge includes islands, coastal wetlands, marshes, shoals, and waterfront lands along {{convert|48|mi|km|0}} of the [[Detroit River]] and [[Western Lake Erie]] shoreline.

The city is crossed by three road systems: the original [[France|French]] template, radial avenues from a [[Washington, D.C.]]-inspired system, and true [[Mile Road System (Detroit)|north&ndash;south roads]] from the [[Northwest Ordinance]] township system. It sits atop a large salt mine<ref>Zacharias, Patricia (January 23, 2000). [http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=17 The ghostly salt city beneath Detroit]. Michigan History, ''The Detroit News''. Retrieved on November 23, 2007.</ref> and is north of [[Windsor, Ontario]]. Detroit is the only major city along the U.S.-Canadian border in which one travels south in order to cross into Canada. Detroit has four border crossings: the [[Ambassador Bridge]] and the [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel]] provide motor vehicle thoroughfare; the [[Michigan Central Railway Tunnel]] provides railroad access to and from Canada. The fourth border crossing is the [[Detroit-Windsor Truck Ferry]], located near the Windsor Salt Mine and [[Zug Island]].

{{main|Architecture of metropolitan Detroit}}
Detroit's waterfront panorama shows a variety of architectural styles. The past meets the present as the city's historic [[Art Deco]] skyscrapers blend with the [[Post-modern architecture|post modern]] neogothic [[spire]]s of the [[One Detroit Center|Comerica Tower at Detroit Center]] (1992). Together with the [[Renaissance Center]], they form the city's marque. Examples of the [[Art Deco]] style include the [[Guardian Building]] and [[Penobscot Building]] downtown, as well as the [[Fisher Building]] and [[Cadillac Place]] in the [[New Center]] area near [[Wayne State University]]. Among the city's prominent structures are the nation's largest [[Fox Theatre (Detroit)|Fox Theatre]], the [[Detroit Opera House]], and the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].

[[Image:P8040442.JPG|thumb|150px|[[St. Joseph Catholic Church, Detroit|St. Joseph Catholic Church]](1873) is a notable example of Detroit's fine ecclesial architecture.]]
While the downtown and New Center areas contain high-rise buildings, the majority of the surrounding city consists of low-rise structures and single-family homes. Outside of the city's core, apartments and high-rises are found in neighborhoods such as the East Riverfront extending toward [[Grosse Pointe]] and the [[Palmer Park]] neighborhood just west of Woodward. Many of the city's neighborhoods were constructed prior to [[World War II]], and feature the architecture of the times. Wood frame and simple brick houses in the working class neighborhoods, larger brick homes in vast middle class neighborhoods, and ornate mansions in neighborhoods such as [[Neighborhoods in Detroit|Brush Park]], [[Woodbridge]], [[Indian Village]], [[Neighborhoods in Detroit|Palmer Woods]], [[Neighborhoods in Detroit|Sherwood Forest]], and others. The oldest neighborhoods are along the Woodward and Jefferson corridors, while newer neighborhoods, built as late as the 1950s, are found in the far west and closer to 8 Mile Road. Some of the oldest extant neighborhoods include [[Corktown]], a working class, formerly Irish neighborhood, and Brush Park. Both are now seeing million dollar redevelopments and construction of new homes and condos.

Detroit's architecture is heralded as some of America's finest; many of the city's architecturally significant buildings are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and the city has one of the nation's largest surviving collections of late nineteenth and early twentieth century buildings.<ref>[[Robert Sharoff|Sharoff, Robert]] (2005). [http://wsupress.wayne.edu/turtle/sharoffac/sharoffb.html American City: Detroit Architecture] ''Wayne State University Press''</ref> Among these historic places are dozens of architecturally significant churches including[[St. Joseph Catholic Church, Detroit|St. Joseph Catholic Church]] and [[Ste. Anne de Detroit Catholic Church|Saint Anne de Detroit Catholic Church]].

The city has an active community of professionals dedicated to urban design, historic preservation, architecture, and investment in the city.<ref>Cityscape Detroit.[http://www.cityscapedetroit.org/ www.cityscapedetroit.org] Retrieved on April 8, 2007.</ref> A number of downtown redevelopment projects — of which [[Campus Martius Park]] is one of the most notable — have revitalized parts of the city. [[Grand Circus Park]] stands near the [[Detroit Theatre District|city's theater district]], [[Ford Field]], home of the [[Detroit Lions]], and [[Comerica Park]], home of the [[Detroit Tigers]].

The [[Detroit International Riverfront]] includes a partially completed three and one-half mile riverfront promenade with a combination of parks, residential buildings, and commercial areas from [[Hart Plaza]] to the MacArthur Bridge accessing [[Belle Isle (Michigan)|Belle Isle]] (the largest island park in a U.S. city). The riverfront includes [[Tri-Centennial State Park]] and Harbor, Michigan's first urban state park. The second phase is a two mile (3 km) extension from Hart Plaza to the [[Ambassador Bridge]] for a total of five miles (8 km) of parkway from bridge to bridge. Civic planners envision that the newly reclaimed riverfront with pedestrian parks will spur more residential development. Other major parks include Palmer (north of [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]]), River Rouge (in the southwest side), and [[Chene Park]] (on the east river downtown).

Live music has been the dominant feature of Detroit's nightlife since the late 1940s bringing the city worldwide attention. The metropolitan area boasts two of the top live music venues in the United States: [[DTE Energy Music Theatre]] and [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]]. The [[Detroit Theatre District]] is the nation's second largest.<ref>[http://www.theworldiscoming.com/getinfo_coolstuff.html Firsts and facts] ''Detroit Tourism Economic Development Council''.

In the 1940s, Detroit's blues scene saw the long-term residency of [[John Lee Hooker]]. During the 1950s, the city became a center for jazz, with stars performing in the [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Black Bottom]] neighborhood.<ref>Boyd, Herb (September 17, 1997). [http://www.metrotimes.com/music/special/jazzhist/51jazzhist.html Cookin' in the Motor City]. ''The Metro Times''</ref> [[Berry Gordy, Jr.]] founded [[Motown Records]] which rose to prominence during the 1960s and early 1970s with acts such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Four Tops]], [[Smokey Robinson & The Miracles]], [[Diana Ross & The Supremes]], and [[Marvin Gaye]]. Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles in 1972 to pursue film production, but the company has since returned to Detroit. [[Aretha Franklin]] is another Detroit R&B star.

Detroit also gave birth to the [[Nederlander Organization]], which originated with the purchase of the [[Detroit Opera House]] in 1922 by the Nederlander Family. The organization would later go on to become the largest controller of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions in [[New York City]].

The area spawned a high-energy rock in the late 1960s and 1970s around the [[Grande Ballroom]] with artists [[Alice Cooper]], [[Ted Nugent]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]], [[Brownsville Station]], [[Glenn Frey]] and [[Bob Seger]]. The group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] captured the love for rock music in ''[[Detroit Rock City]]''. This was a precursor to [[punk rock]]'s [[MC5]] and [[Iggy Pop]]'s [[The Stooges]], among others.

As a birthplace of [[Techno music]] emerging in 1987 to venues worldwide, seminal [[Detroit Techno]] artists include [[Juan Atkins]], [[Derrick May]], and Kevin Saunderson. This genre developed alongside [[Chicago]]'s [[House music]], yet was more influenced by [[funk]] and European electronic pioneers such as [[Kraftwerk]], as well as Atkins's own early [[electro music|electro]] work. Techno reached a worldwide audience and in Europe triggered a [[Sociocultural evolution|revolution]] in both [[youth culture]] and [[music industry]].

In addition, Detroit's [[garage rock]] of the 1990s rose to national attention with the bands [[The White Stripes]], [[Von Bondies]], [[the Dirtbombs]], and [[Electric Six]]. In recent years, bands like [[The Hard Lessons]] and the Amino Acids revived garage rock. [[Hard rock]], powered by 101.1 [[WRIF]], produced local success for bands like [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]]. Detroit [[Hip Hop]] rose to prominence in the late nineties with the emergence of [[Eminem]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Street Lord'z]], [[Slum Village]], [[D12]], [[J Dilla]], [[Obie Trice]], [[Blade Icewood]], [[Big Herk]], and [[Royce Da 5'9]] as well as other artists like [[Tone Tone]] and [[Esham]]. [[Detroit Rap]] and Soul are internationally recognized.  Some of Detroit's other famous rap groups include [[Insane Clown Posse]], [[Twiztid]], and [[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]]. Detroit Soul artists include [[Dwele]], [[Amp Fiddler]], Monica Blaire, and [[Kem (singer)|Kem]].

Other music events include [[Ford Detroit International Jazz Festival]], the [[Detroit Electronic Music Festival]], the Motor City Music Conference (MC2), the Urban Organic Music Conference, the [[Concert of Colors]], and the hip-hop Summer Jamz festival.

Artist Tyree Guyton created the controversial street art exhibit known as the [[Heidelberg Project]] in the mid 1980s. The exhibit used junk and abandoned cars, clothing, shoes, vacuum cleaners, and other garbage Guyton found in the neighborhood near and on Heidelberg Street on the near East Side of Detroit. Guyton painted polka dots and other symbols on several houses on Heidelberg Street. The city sued Guyton twice for creating a public nuisance, removed large parts of his art project, and tore down two vacant homes he had painted with various symbols. Nevertheless, the Heidelberg Project is continually updated.

As of the 2000 [[census]][[Geographic references#2|²]], there were 951,270 people, 336,428 households, and 218,341 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 6,855.1 people per square mile (2,646.7/km²). There were 375,096 housing units at an average density of 2,703.0 units per square mile (1,043.6/km²). In 2006, Detroit's population was estimated to be 918,849, a decline of 3.4% since 2000.

During the twentieth century, the city experienced tremendous growth - then rapid population decline. The city's population increased more than sixfold during the first half of the twentieth century, fed largely by an influx of Eastern European, [[Lebanese Americans|Lebanese]] and [[U.S. South|Southern]] migrants to work in the burgeoning automobile industry.<ref name=Michpeople>Baulch, Vivian M.

The city population dropped from its peak in 1950 with a population of 1,849,568 to 886,675 in 2005. This is in part attributed to the construction of an extensive freeway system during the 1950s and [[white flight]] from the 1960s onward on account of concerns over crime, and [[desegregation busing|court-ordered busing]]. 

As of 2000, the city of Detroit was 82.70% [[Race (U.S. Census)|African American]], 12.26% [[White American|white]], 0.97% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.33% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.03% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 2.54% from [[Race (U.S. Census)|other races]], and 2.32% from two or more races. 4.96 percent of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race. Non-Hispanic whites accounted for 10.50% of Detroit's population. The city's foreign-born population stood at 4.8%.

The city government is run by a mayor and nine-member city council and clerk elected on an at-large nonpartisan ballot. Since voters approved the city's charter in 1974, Detroit has had a "[[Mayor-council government|strong mayoral]]" system, with the mayor approving departmental appointments. The council approves budgets but the mayor is not obligated to adhere to any earmarking. City ordinances and substantially large contracts must be approved by the council. The city clerk supervises elections and is formally charged with the maintenance of municipal records. Municipal [[election]]s for mayor, city council and city clerk are held at four-year intervals, in the year after presidential elections (so that there are Detroit elections scheduled in 1993, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2009, etc.).<ref>Ward, George E.

With its proximity to Canada and its facilities, ports, major highways, rail connections and international airports, Detroit is an important transportation hub. The city has three international border crossings, the [[Ambassador Bridge]], [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel]] and [[Michigan Central Railway Tunnel]], linking Detroit to [[Windsor, Ontario]]. The Ambassador Bridge is the single busiest border crossing in North America, carrying 27% of the total trade between the U.S. and Canada.<ref>[http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/freight_analysis/ambass_brdg/ambass_brdge_ovrvw.htm Ambassador Bridge Crossing Summary (May 11, 2005)].

Metro Detroit has an extensive freeway system administered by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]].  The city is at the crossroads for three [[Interstate Highway]]s: [[Interstate 94|I-94]] ([[Edsel Ford]] Freeway), [[Interstate 96|I-96]] (Edward Jeffries Freeway), and [[Interstate 75|I-75]] (Fisher and [[Walter P. Chrysler|Chrysler]] Freeways). [[Interstate 696|I-696]] ([[Walter Reuther]] Freeway) serves the northern suburbs, while [[Interstate 275 (Michigan)|I-275]] serves the western suburbs and [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|I-375]] is a short extension of the Chrysler Freeway. Other major routes are the [[John C. Lodge]] Freeway ([[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]]), the [[M-39 (Michigan highway)|Southfield Freeway]] (M-39) and the [[M-8 (Michigan highway)|Davison Freeway]] (M-8). Detroit and surrounding close suburbs are also served by a square [[Mile Road System (Detroit)|grid network of major arterial roads]].

Detroit is also connected via [[Interstate 94]] to [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Kings Highway 401]] and to major [[Southern Ontario]] cities such as [[London, Ontario]] and the [[Greater Toronto Area]] along [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]. Upon construction and completion of a third border crossing, Detroit and the surrounding area would have a third direct link to the [[400-Series]] freeway network, and have a direct connection to Kings Highway 401, eliminating (or greatly diminishing) the traffic jams that plague the [[Ambassador Bridge]], and the [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel]]. The [[Blue Water Bridge]] near [[Sarnia, Ontario]] is another major commercial border crossing.

An [[people mover|automated guideway transit]] system known as the [[Detroit People Mover|People Mover]] provides a 2.9&nbsp;mile (4.6&nbsp;km) loop in the downtown area and usually operates daily. [[Amtrak]] provides service to Detroit, operating its {{Amtrak lines|Wolverine}} service between [[Chicago]], and [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]. Baggage cannot be checked at this location; however, up to two suitcases in addition to any "personal items" such as briefcases, purses, laptop bags, and infant equipment are allowed on board as carry-ons. The [[Detroit (Amtrak station)|current passenger facility]] is north of downtown. The ''J.W. Westcott II'', which delivers mail to [[freighter]]s on the Detroit River, is the world's only floating post office.<ref>[http://continuouswave.com/boats/westcott/ America's Floating ZIP Code 48222] ''J.W.

Currently, a study is underway to investigate the feasibility of a Detroit-[[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] [[SEMCOG Commuter Rail|commuter line]],<ref>Ann Arbor Detroit Rapid Transit Study (2006). [http://www.annarbordetroitrapidtransitstudy.com/ Ann Arbor to Detroit Lightrail] ''SEMCOG.'' Retrieved on April 4, 2007.</ref> which would service the nearly 100,000 daily commuters between the two regional hubs. The proposed system would be funded by a [[United States dollar|$]]100 million federal grant that is secured based on the results of the study.
