The '''Northern Red-legged Frog''', ''''' Rana aurora aurora''''', is a protected [[species]] of [[amphibian]], whose range is the coastal region stretching from [[Northern California]] to southwest [[British Columbia]].<ref name="Zeiner">''California [[Wildlife]], Volume I: Amphibians and Reptiles'', ed. by D.C. Zeiner et al., published by the [[California Department of Fish and Game|California State Department of Fish and Game]], May 2, 1988</ref>  As a member of the [[genus]] Rana, this species is considered a [[true frog]], with characteristic smooth skin and a narrow [[waist]].  This [[frog]] requires still waters for [[Reproduction|breeding]] and is rarely found at any great distance from its breeding [[pond]]s or [[marsh]]es. 

'' Rana aurora aurora'' adults may attain a length of eight centimeters; they have a dark facial mask and a characteristic light stripe along the [[jaw]]line.<ref name="Stebbins">R.C. Stebbins, ''[[Amphibian]]s and [[Reptile]]s of North America'', McGraw Hill, New York (1954)</ref>  The Northern Red-legged Frog has long, powerful legs well adapted to significant leaps; in fact its proximate species, ''R. draytonii'', is considered to be that depicted by [[Mark Twain]], in the famed tale of the ''Leaping Frog of [[Calaveras County]]''.  It is one of two amphibian species classified as [[Red-legged Frog]], the other species being termed [[California Red-legged Frog]]; however, the latter species is found primarily from [[Marin County]] southerly to [[Baja California]].  These two [[Genetics|genetic]]ally distinct species are believed to intergrade in the counties of Marin and [[Sonoma County|Sonoma]].  In some systems of [[taxonomy]], this species is classified as '''''Rana aurora aurora'''''.

==Range==
The Northern Red-legged Frog is found in every [[coast]]al county of [[California]] from [[Mendocino County]] northward and including  coastal [[Oregon]].{{Fact|date=October 2007}}  While it occurs primarily in the [[California Coast Ranges|Northern California coastal mountain range]]s, it is not found above an elevation of 1200 meters.  It also occurs somewhat less commonly in the southern [[Cascade Range]].<ref name="Zeiner" />  The species is thought to intergrade with ''Rana draytonii'' in Marin County and Sonoma County, California, but has been observed as far south as [[San Mateo County]].

==Habitat==
The still waters of ponds, marshes or [[stream]] pools are essential for Northern Red-legged Frog breeding [[habitat]];<ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/mendocino/maps/info/frog/3-nrdlegfrog-03.pdf U.S. Department of Agriculture Northern Red-legged Frog profile (2003)]</ref> moreover, this species of frog is considered unusually highly oriented to its [[Freshwater biology|aquatic habitat]], with a clear preference for thickly [[vegetation|vegetated]] [[shoreline]].<ref name="Lumina">''Red-legged Frog observations in the coastal ranges and development impact analysis'', Lumina Technologies, Tiburon (1997)</ref>  ''Rana aurora'' requires cover, since it is subject to [[predation]] by various [[fish]], [[snake]]s, [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s and even certain other amphibians.  When this frog senses danger, it will quickly plunge to depths of one meter or more to seek safety in the [[benthic]] zone of a pond.  Adults leave the breeding pond soon after the breeding activity is concluded and may migrate about one half kilometer to its summer location, which is likely to be a [[riparian zone]].  In the northern part of its range, adults may [[hibernation|hibernate]].  Juveniles are slower to leave the breeding ponds, but also tend to find cover in riparian areas and may readily migrate about one half kilometer by summertime.  Mature ''Rana aurora'' prey upon [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[insect]]s, but will also take small [[snail]]s and [[crustacean]]s;<ref name="UC">[http://www.amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?where-genus=Rana&where-species=aurora Amphibian Declines: The Conservation Status of United States Species, edited by Michael Lannoo ©2005 website excepted from University of California Press]</ref> moreover, they will consume [[worm]]s, [[tadpole]]s, small fish and even small frogs of other species.  The [[larva]]e of the Northern Red-legged Frog are considered totally [[herbivore|herbivorous]].

==Breeding==
[[Male]]s and [[female]]s begin to move to the breeding sites as early as October, and sometimes as late as January depending on [[latitude]], cumulative [[rainfall]] for the season and average [[temperature]]<ref name="Lumina">''Red-legged Frog observations in the coastal ranges and development impact analysis'', Lumina Technologies, Tiburon (1997)</ref>.  Typically stable minimum temperatures of 42 to 44 degrees Fahrenheit are required to induce breeding. Observations of adult migration are best made on moonlit nights with light rains.  The male is thought to defend [[territory (animal)]], once he is in the breeding pond area, using [[nocturnal]] displays.  In fact, most activity is in the night-time, especially enhanced by periods of light rain.  The actual [[courtship]] [[behavior]]s commence in January in the California part of the range, and as late as March in northerly regions.  In any case, the breeding season terminates in July at the very latest, and earlier in the drier locales.

Each famale produces 200 to 1100 eggs per season and attaches the egg cluster to submerged vegetation or rotting logs, characteristically seven to fifteen centimeters below the pond surface.<ref name="Stebbins">R.C. Stebbins, ''[[Amphibian]]s and [[Reptile]]s of North America'', McGraw Hill, New York (1954)</ref>   [[Egg (biology)|Egg]] clusters are typically about ten centimeters in diameter and may disperse into an irregular form underwater.  Eggs hatch out in 39 to 45 days, and [[tadpole]]s require approximately 80 days to attain [[metamorphasis]].<ref>G.W. Calef, ''Natural [[Death|Mortality]] of [[Tadpole]]s in a Population of "Rana aurora"'', Ecology 54:741-758 (1973)</ref>

[[Oviposition]] generally takes place in densely vegetated shallow portions of wetlands with mimimal current, and in unusual cases egg masses have been observed in water up to 500 centimeters in depth. Breeding sites can be either permanent or temporary, with inundation usually necessary into June for successful [[metamorphosis]].<ref name="UC">[http://www.amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?where-genus=Rana&where-species=aurora Amphibian Declines: The Conservation Status of United States Species, edited by Michael Lannoo ©2005 website excepted from University of California Press]</ref>  The June date is based upon Oregon conditions; in Northern California late May or early June witnesses metamorphosis.   Breeding is initiated when water temperatures exceed about six degrees [[Celsius]] (usually in January), but can be as late as March in the extreme northern part of the range.
