'''Minneapolis''' ({{pronEng|ˌmɪniˈæpʌlɪs}}) is the largest [[city]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]] and is the [[county seat]] of [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin County]]. The city lies on both banks of the [[Mississippi River]], just north of the river's confluence with the [[Minnesota River]], and adjoins [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], the state's [[capital]]. Known as the ''Twin Cities'', these two cities form the core of [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]], the fifteenth largest [[metropolitan area]] in the [[United States]], with about 3.5 million residents.

Dakota [[Sioux]] were the region's sole residents until [[explorer]]s arrived from France in about 1680. Nearby [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]], built between 1820 and 1825 by the [[United States Army]] spurred growth in the area. Circumstances pressed the [[Mdewakanton]] band of the Dakota to sell their land, allowing people arriving from the east to settle there. The Minnesota Territorial Legislature authorized present day Minneapolis as a town on the Mississippi's west bank in 1856. Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867, the year rail service began between Minneapolis and Chicago, and joined with the east bank city of St. Anthony in 1872.<ref>{{cite web | publisher= Minneapolis Public Library (mpls.lib.mn.us) | date=2001 | title=A History of Minneapolis: Mdewakanton Band of the Dakota Nation, Parts I and II | url=http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/eh1.asp}} and {{cite web | title=A History of Minneapolis: Minneapolis Becomes Part of the United States| url=http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/eh3.asp}}, and {{cite web | title=A History of Minneapolis: Governance and Infrastructure | url= http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/cg1.asp}} and {{cite web | title=A History of Minneapolis: Railways | url= http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/tr2.asp | accessdate=2007-04-30}}.</ref>

Minneapolis has a [[continental climate]] typical of the [[Upper Midwest|Upper Midwestern United States]]. [[Winter]]s can be cold and dry, while summer is comfortably warm although at times it can be hot and humid. On the [[Köppen climate classification]], Minneapolis falls in the warm summer [[humid continental climate]] zone (''Dfa''). The city experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather events, including [[snow]], [[sleet]], [[ice]], [[rain]], [[thunderstorm]]s, [[tornado]]es, and [[fog]]. The warmest temperature ever recorded in Minneapolis was 108&nbsp;°F (42.2&nbsp;°C) in [[1936 North American heat wave|July 1936]], and the coldest temperature ever recorded was -41&nbsp;°F (-40.6&nbsp;°C), in January 1888. The snowiest winter of record was 1983&ndash;84, when 98.4&nbsp;in (2.5&nbsp;m) of snow fell.<ref>{{cite web| author= Fisk, Charles| url= http://home.att.net/~minn_climo/| title= Links to Some of the More Interesting Years With Accompanying Notes| date= [[March 3]] [[2007]]| accessdate= 2007-03-25}}</ref>

Because of its northerly location in the United States and lack of large bodies of water to moderate the air, Minneapolis is sometimes subjected to cold Arctic [[air mass]]es, especially during late December, January & February.

[[Image:American Swedish Institute-2007-03-18.jpg|thumb|left|[[American Swedish Institute]]. Immigrants from [[Scandinavia]] arrived beginning in the 1860s.]]
During the 1850s and 1860s, new settlers arrived in Minneapolis from [[New England]] and [[New York]], and during the mid-1860s, Scandinavians from [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], and [[Denmark]] began to call the city home. Later, immigrants came from [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Poland]], and southern and eastern Europe. [[Jews]] from [[Russia]] and eastern Europe settled primarily on the north side of the city before moving in large numbers to the western suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name=Nathanson>{{cite web| last= Nathanson| first= Iric| title= Jews in Minnesota| publisher= Jewish Community Relations Council| url= http://www.minndakjcrc.org/Docs/Jews%20of%20Minnesota%20by%20Iric%20Nathanson.pdf| format= PDF| accessdate= 2007-04-14}}</ref> Asians came from [[China]], the [[Philippines]], [[Japan]], and [[Korea]]. Two groups came for a short while during U.S. government relocations, Japanese during the 1940s, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] during the 1950s. From 1970 onward, Asians arrived from [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Thailand]]. Beginning in the 1990s, a large [[Latino]] population arrived, along with refugees from [[Africa]], especially from [[Somalia]].<ref name=residents>{{cite web| title=A History of Minneapolis: Residents of the City| publisher=Minneapolis Public Library (mpls.lib.mn.us)| date=2001| url=http://www.mpls.lib.mn.us/history/| accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref>

Into the 21st century, Minneapolis continues its heritage of welcoming newcomers.

The number of African-Americans, Asians, and Hispanics is growing. Non-whites are now about one fifth of the city's residents.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia= Encyclopaedia Britannica| title= Minneapolis History| date= 2007| url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-242048/Minneapolis| accessdate= 2007-03-24}}</ref>

Compared to a peer group in 2000, the metropolitan area is decentralizing, with a high [[churn rate]] and a large young and white population and low unemployment. Racial and ethnic minorities lag behind white counterparts in education, with 15% of black and 13% of Hispanic people holding bachelor's degrees compared to 42% of the white population. The standard of living is on the rise, with incomes among the highest in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], but median household income among black people is below that of white by over $17,000. Home ownership among black and Hispanic residents is half that of white, and one-third of the Asian population lives below the poverty line.<ref name=Brookings />

Early Minneapolis experienced a period of corruption in local government and crime was common until an economic downturn in the mid 1900s. Since 1950 the population decreased and much of downtown was lost to urban renewal and highway construction. The result was a "moribund and peaceful" environment until the 1990s.<ref>{{cite journal| author= Moskowitz, Dara| title= Minneapolis Confidential| journal= City Pages|publisher=Village Voice Media |volume=16 |issue=775| date= [[1995-10-11]]| url= http://citypages.com/databank/16/775/article2415.asp| accessdate= 2007-03-21}}</ref> Along with economic recovery the [[murder]] rate climbed.

Minneapolis is also home to a number of less traditional religious organizations, including several chapters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons), the Church of Jesus Christ, Scientist, and the Jehova's Witnesses.  There is at least one Baha'i temple and at least one Hubbard Dianetics Foundation (Scientology) office in the city.  Residential neighborhoods and surrounding rural areas are home to a thriving Pagan/Wiccan community which meets variously in members' homes, coffeeshops and city parks.  The largest Wiccan group in Minnesota, known as Covenant of the Goddess, operates out of Minneapolis and holds public rituals to mark the four pagan "high days" (the Equinoxes and Solstices), at area parks during summer months and various unitarian churches or community centers in winter.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
