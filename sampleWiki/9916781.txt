The '''Georgia Institute of Technology''', commonly known as '''Georgia Tech''', is a [[public university|public]], [[coeducation]]al [[research university]], part of the [[University System of Georgia]], and located in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], [[United States|USA]], with [[wiktionary:Transwiki:Satellite campus|satellite campuses]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]], [[Metz|Metz, France]], [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]], and [[Singapore]]. Georgia Tech is best known for its programs in [[engineering]], [[computing]], and the [[science]]s, though it also offers degrees in [[architecture]], [[liberal arts]], and [[management]].

Established in 1885<ref name="walk"/> and opened in 1888 with the construction of [[Tech Tower]] and a shop building,<ref name="Hopkins">{{cite web | title = The Hopkins Administration, 1888-1895 | work = "A Thousand Wheels are set in Motion": The Building of Georgia Tech at the Turn of the 20th Century, 1888-1908 | publisher = Georgia Institute of Technology | url = http://www.library.gatech.edu/gtbuildings/hopkins.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref> Georgia Tech's campus occupies a large part of [[Midtown Atlanta]]. Founded as the '''Georgia School of Technology''', it changed its name in 1948 to reflect its evolution from a [[vocational school|trade school]] to a [[institute of technology|technical institute]] and [[research university]], and its [[history of Georgia Tech|history]] and [[Georgia Tech traditions|traditions]] reflect that change.  In 1996, it was the site of the athletes' village and a venue for a number of athletic events for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]].

=== Establishment ===
[[Image:AtlantaDuringCivilWar.jpg|Atlanta during the Civil War (c. 1864)|right|thumb|300px]]
The idea of Georgia Institute of Technology was introduced in 1865 during the [[Reconstruction]] period. Two former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officers, Major [[John Fletcher Hanson]] and [[Nathaniel Edwin Harris]], who had become prominent citizens in the town of [[Macon, Georgia]] after the [[American Civil War|war]], strongly believed that the South needed to improve its technology to compete with the [[industrial revolution]] that was occurring throughout the North.<ref name="Hopkins"/><ref name="gws">{{cite web|url=http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/1293.pdf|title=The George W. Woodruff Schol of Mechanical Engineering|publisher=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref> Many Southerners at this time agreed with this idea. However, because the American South of that era was mainly comprised of agricultural workers and few technical developments were occurring, a technology school was needed.<ref name="Hopkins"/><ref name="gws"/>

In 1882, prominent Georgians, authorized by the [[Georgia State Legislature]] and led by Harris, formed a committee and visited the Northeast to see firsthand how technology schools worked. Using examples from the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science (now [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]) and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the Atlanta technology school began development on the Worcester Free Institute model, which stressed a combination of "theory and practice," the "practice" component including student employment and production of consumer items to generate revenue for the school.<ref name="NewSouthCreed">{{cite journal | last = Brittain | first = James E. | coauthors = Robert C.

On [[October 13]], [[1885]], [[Governor of Georgia|Georgia Governor]] [[Henry D. McDaniel]] signed the bill to create and fund the new school.<ref name="walk">{{cite news| url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/sum04/article1.html | title=A Walk Through Tech's History | publisher = Georgia Tech Alumni Association | work = Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine Online | accessdateb = 2007-01-29 }}</ref> In 1887, Atlanta pioneer [[Richard Peters (Atlanta)|Richard Peters]] donated four acres of his extensive land holdings to the state;<ref name="walk"/> this land was bounded on the south by [[North Avenue (Atlanta)|North Avenue]], and on the west by Cherry Street.<ref name="walk"/> He then sold five adjoining acres of land to the state for [[United States dollar|$]]10,000,<ref name="walk"/> approximately equivalent to $182,717.44 in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|first=S.

A historical marker on the large hill in [[Georgia Institute of Technology#Central Campus|Central Campus]] notes that the site occupied by the school's first buildings once held fortifications built to protect Atlanta during the [[Atlanta Campaign]] of the [[American Civil War]]. The surrender of the city took place on the southwestern boundary of the modern Georgia Tech campus in 1864.<ref name="CivilWarAtlanta">{{cite web | last = Lenz | first = Richard J. | title = Surrender Marker, Fort Hood, Change of Command Marker | work = The Civil War in Georgia, An Illustrated Travelers Guide | publisher = Sherpa Guides | year = 2002 | month = November | url = http://sherpaguides.com/georgia/civil_war/atlanta/westview_area.html | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref>

=== Early years ===
[[Image:Tech Tower and Shop 1899.jpg|right|300px|thumb|An early picture of Georgia Tech]]
The Georgia School of Technology opened its doors in the fall of 1888 with only two buildings.<ref name="Hopkins"/> One building (now [[Tech Tower]], an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a [[foundry]], [[forge]], [[mechanical room|boiler room]] and [[engine room]]. It was designed specifically for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands;<ref name="Hopkins"/> though, at the time, there was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used to turn a profit.<ref name="NewSouthCreed"/>

On [[October 20]], [[1905]], [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] visited the Georgia Tech campus. On the steps of Tech Tower, Roosevelt presented a speech about the importance of technological education.<ref name="PresidentialVisit">{{cite web | last = Selman | first = Sean | title = Presidential Tour of Campus Not the First for the Institute | work = A Presidential Visit to Georgia Tech | publisher = Georgia Institute of Technology | date = 2002-03-27 | url = http://www.gatech.edu/presidential-visit/presidential-history.html | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref> He then shook hands with every student.<ref name="EventfulYear">{{cite web | title = One Hundred Years Ago Was Eventful Year at Tech | work = BuzzWords | publisher = Georgia Tech Alumni Association | date = 2005-10-01 | url = http://gtalumni.org/buzzwords/oct05/article389.html | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref>

[[John Patrick Crecine]] was instrumental in securing the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] for Atlanta. A dramatic amount of construction occurred, creating most of what is now considered "West Campus" in order for Tech to serve as the [[Olympic Park|Olympic Village]].<ref name="village">{{cite news|url=http://gtalumni.org/news/ttopics/fall95/home0.html|title=Touring the Olympic Village|work=Tech Topics|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|date=Fall 1995|accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> The Undergraduate Living Center, Fourth Street Apartments, Sixth Street Apartments, [[Eighth Street Apartments]], Hemphill Apartments, and Center Street Apartments housed athletes and journalists.

In 1994, [[G. Wayne Clough]] became the first Tech alumnus to serve as the President of the Institute, and was in office during the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. In 1998, he separated the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs into the [[Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts]] and returned the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Management|College of Management]] to "College" status (Crecine, the previous president, had demoted Management from "College" to "School" status as part of a controversial 1990 reorganization plan).<ref name="Crecine">{{cite news | last = Joshi | first = Nikhil | title = Geibelhaus lectures on controversial president | work = [[The Technique]] | date = 2006-03-10 | url = http://www.nique.net/issues/2006-03-10/focus/4 | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=J.R.|last=Gray|url=http://technique.library.gatech.edu/issues/winter1998/feb6/eds5.html|title=Get over headtrip, Management|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[1998-02-06]]|accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref> His tenure has been focused on a dramatic expansion of the institute, a revamped Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), and the creation of an International Plan.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nikhil|last=Joshi|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2005-03-04/news/2|title=International plan takes root|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2005-03-04|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Inn Inn|last=Chen|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2005-09-23/focus/1|title=Research, International Plan Fair hits Skiles Walkway|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2005-09-23|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref>

=== Demographics ===
The student body consists of 18,500 graduate and undergraduate students, and more than 900 full-time instructional faculty.<ref name="Facts">{{cite web|url=http://www.gatech.edu/about-tech/facts-figures.php|title=Georgia Tech Facts and Figures|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref>

Historically, female enrollment at engineering institutions has been quite low and Georgia Tech is no exception. With about twice as many [[male]] students as females, Georgia Tech has one of the most unbalanced male-to-female ratios of any [[coeducation|co-ed]] university. However, this is slowly changing presumably due to the university's growing liberal arts programs as well as outreach programs to encourage more female high school students to consider careers in science and engineering, such as the "Women In Engineering" program and also having a chapter of The [[Society of Women Engineers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.gatech.edu/diversity/wieabout.php|title=Women in Engineering at Georgia Tech|publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Engineering|Georgia Tech College of Engineering]]|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/swe/|title=Society of Women Engineers at Georgia Tech|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> [[As of 2007|As of Spring 2007]], the freshman class of 2006â2007 had a ratio of 68.8% to 31.2%.<ref name="ratio">{{cite web|url=http://www.irp.gatech.edu/apps/Enrollment/gender.cfm?TERM=200702&time_status=Total|title=Office of Institutional Research & Planning: Facts and Figures: Enrollment by Gender|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> The highest freshman ratio in the past few years (counting only Fall and Spring semesters)<ref>A slightly higher percentage of freshmen women attend during Summer.

=== Funding ===
The Georgia Institute of Technology is a [[public universities|public institution]], receiving funds from the [[Georgia (U.S. State)|State of Georgia]], tuition, fees, research grants, and alumni contributions. In 2006, the school's revenue amounted to approximately $879 million, with 27% of that amount from the state, and 12% from tuition and fees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irp.gatech.edu/apps/factbook/?page=122|title=Financial Information: Revenue|work=Georgia Tech Fact Book|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref> Most of the remaining funds were donated by private sources, including the most generous alumni donor base, percentage-wise, of any public university ranked in the top 50.<ref name="highest">{{cite pressrelease|url=http://www.gatech.edu/news-room/release.php?id=1457|title=Tech Receives Highest U.S. News Ranking Ever|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|date=[[2007-08-17]]|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref> The Institute's expenses for 2006 were $860 million; 41% of that figure went to research, 21% to instruction, and 1% to scholarships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irp.gatech.edu/apps/factbook/?page=123|title=Financial Information: Expenditures|work=Georgia Tech Fact Book|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>

=== Industry connections ===
Owing to its roots as a [[vocational school|trade school]], Georgia Tech maintains close ties to the industrial world. Many of these connections are made through Georgia Tech's uniquely popular and robust [[cooperative education]] and [[intern]]ship programs. Georgia Tech's Division of Professional Practice (DoPP), established in 1912 as the Georgia Institute of Technology Cooperative Division,<ref name="DoPPhonor">{{ cite news | url=http://www.whistle.gatech.edu/archives/07/jun/18/brief.shtml | work = The Whistle | accessdate = 2007-09-24 | date=[[2007-06-18]] | title=Cooperative Education named to national Hall of Honor }}</ref> operates the fourth-oldest cooperative education program in the United States.<ref name="DoPPhome">{{ cite web | title = Division of Professional Practice | url=http://www.profpractice.gatech.edu/index.php | accessdate = 2007-09-24 | publisher = Georgia Institute of Technology }}</ref> The DoPP is specifically charged with providing opportunities for students to gain real-world [[employment]] experience through four programs, each targeting a different body of students. The Undergraduate Cooperative Education Program is a five-year program in which [[undergraduate education|undergraduate students]] alternate between semesters of formal instruction at Georgia Tech and semesters of full-time employment with their employers. The Graduate Cooperative Education Program, established in 1983, is the largest such program in the United States.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.gradcoop.gatech.edu/ | work=Division of Professional Practice | title=Graduate Cooperative Education Program | publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology | accessdate = 2007-09-24 }}</ref> It allows [[graduate school|graduate students]] pursuing [[master's degree]]s or [[doctorate]]s in any field to spend a maximum of two consecutive semesters working full- or part-time with employers. The Undergraduate Professional Internship Program enables undergraduate students â typically juniors or seniors â to complete a one- or two-semester internship with employers. The Work Abroad Program hosts a variety of cooperative education and internship experiences for upperclassmen and graduate students seeking international employment and cross-cultural experiences. While all four programs are voluntary, they consistently attract high numbers of students â more than 3,000 at last count.

{{seealso|Stealing the T|Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate}}
Tech has a number of legends and traditions, some of which have persisted for decades. Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower. [[Tech Tower]], Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters TECH hanging atop it on each of its four sides. A number of times, students have orchestrated complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion have carried this act out successfully. The latest instance of this tradition occurred in October 2005, when a replica of the T was stolen from the Student Services Building and returned two days later.<ref>{{cite news

Georgia Tech holds a heated, long and ongoing rivalry with the [[University of Georgia]], known as [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate]]. The first known hostilities between the two schools trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia's literary magazine proclaimed UGA's school colors to be "[[old gold]], black, and [[crimson]]." Dr. Charles H. Herty, the first UGA football coach, felt that [[old gold]] was too similar to [[yellow]] and that it "symbolized cowardice." After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official school color.<ref name="ugacolors">{{cite web | title = College football tradition - Official school colors | url = http://www.1122productions.com/tradition/colors/ | accessdate = 2007-03-16 }}</ref> Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial slap in the face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] in 1891.<ref name="rw">{{cite web|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|title=Georgia Tech traditions|work=RamblinWreck.com|publisher=Georgia Tech Athletic Association|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> Georgia Tech's school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.

In 1963 the [http://www.coa.gatech.edu/music/ Music Department], under the leadership of Ben Logan Sisk, was created within Tech's General College. In 1976 the Music department was assigned to the College of Sciences & Liberal Studies, and in 1991 was relocated to its current home in the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Architecture|College of Architecture]]. [[Under the Couch]] is a live music venue located beneath the Couch Building on West Campus. It is run by the Musician's Network. Georgia Tech also has a growing music scene, including the growing [[a cappella]] groups on campus: Nothin' but Treble,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nothinbuttreble.com/|title=Nothin' but Treble|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> Sympathetic Vibrations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sympvibes.com/|title=Sympathetic Vibrations|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> and Infinite Harmony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gtinfiniteharmony.com/|title=Infinite Harmony|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref>

[[WREK]], 91.1 [[Megahertz|MHz]] is known as "Wreck Radio." The studio is on the second floor of the Student Center Commons. Broadcasting with 40&nbsp;kW ERP, WREK is among the nation's most powerful college radio stations.  WREK is currently a student operated and run radio station, but there is currently a debate (as of April 2007) as to whether or not [[NPR]] or [[GPB]] should be given control over some of the station's airtime.<ref>{{cite news|first=James|last=Stephenson|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2006-11-17/news/2|title=PBA inquires about managing WREK|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2006-11-17|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> Many students are opposed to such a change.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2006-11-17/opinions/1|title=Leave WREK alone|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2006-11-17|accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref>

''[[The Technique]]'', also known as the "{{'}}''Nique''," is Tech's official [[student newspaper]]. It is distributed weekly during the Fall and Spring semesters (on Fridays), and biweekly during the Summer semester (with certain exceptions). It was established on [[November 17]], [[1911]]. ''[[Blueprint (yearbook)|The Blueprint]]'' is Tech's yearbook, established in 1908. Other student publications include ''The North Avenue Review'', Tech's "free-speech magazine,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/nar/|title=North Avenue Review|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> and ''Erato'', Tech's [[literary magazine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/erato/index.html|title=Erato|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref> The offices of all student publications are located in the Student Services Building.

=== Campus services ===
[[Georgia Tech Cable Network]], or GTCN, is the college's branded cable source. The station broadcasts WREK-FM on channel 17, in addition to student-generated content and recent movies on channels 20 and 21. Most non-original programming is obtained from [[Dish Network]]. GTCN currently has 109 [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]] channels and five [[high-definition television|high-definition]] channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gtcn.gatech.edu/TVGuide/channelLineup.cfm|title=Channel Lineup|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Cable Network]]|accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref>

The Office of Information Technology, or OIT, manages most of the school's computing resources (and some related services such as campus telephones). With the exception of a few computer labs maintained by individual [[Georgia Institute of Technology#Colleges|colleges]], OIT is responsible for most of the computing facilities on campus. Student, faculty, and staff e-mail accounts are among its services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oit.gatech.edu/|title=Georgia Tech OIT|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> 

ResNet provides free technical support to all students and guests living in Georgia Tech's on-campus housing (excluding fraternities and sororities).

The Georgia Tech campus is located in [[Midtown Atlanta|Midtown]], an area north of downtown Atlanta. Although a number of [[skyscraper]]s â most visibly the headquarters of [[AT&T Midtown Center|AT&T]], [[Coca-Cola headquarters|The Coca-Cola Company]], and [[Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)|Bank of America]] â  are visible from all points on campus, the campus itself has few buildings over four stories and has a great deal of greenery. This gives it a distinctly [[suburb]]an atmosphere quite different from other Atlanta campuses such as that of [[Georgia State University]].<ref name="map">{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/campusmap/|title=Campus Map|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Alumni Association]]|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatech.edu/vtour/|title=Tech Virtual Tour|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>

The campus is organized into four main parts: West Campus, East Campus, Central Campus, and [[Technology Square]]. West Campus and East Campus are both occupied primarily by student living complexes, while Central Campus is reserved primarily for teaching and research buildings.<ref name="map"/>

=== West Campus ===
[[Image:Gatech8th.png|thumb|left|275px|[[Eighth Street Apartments]] East Building]]
West Campus is occupied primarily by apartments and coed undergraduate dormitories. Prominent apartments include Hemphill, Center Street, 6th Street, Maulding, Undergraduate Living Center (ULC), and [[Eighth Street Apartments]]. Prominent dorms include [[Freeman Hall (Georgia Tech)|Freeman]], [[Montag Hall (Georgia Tech)|Montag]], [[Fitten Hall (Georgia Tech)|Fitten]], [[Folk Hall (Georgia Tech)|Folk]], [[Caldwell Hall (Georgia Tech)|Caldwell]], Armstrong, Hefner, Fulmer, and Woodruff Suites. The [[Georgia Tech Campus Recreation Center|Campus Recreation Center]] (formerly the Student Athletic Complex); a [[volleyball]] court; a large, low natural green area known as the [[Burger Bowl]]; and a flat artificial green area known as the SAC Fields are all located on the western side of the campus. Also within easy walking distance of West Campus is City Cafe, which is open 24 hours, Rocky Mountain Pizza, and Engineer's Bookstore, an alternative to Georgia Tech's official bookstore. West Campus is also home to a music club operated by students called [[Under the Couch]] as well as a small diner and convenience store, West Side Market. Due to limited space, all auto travel proceeds via a network of one-way streets which connects West Campus to Ferst Drive, the main road of the campus. [[Woodruff Dining Hall]], or "Woody's," is the West Campus Dining Hall. It connects the Woodruff North and Woodruff South undergraduate dorms.

=== East Campus ===
[[Image:Georgia Tech Skiles walkway.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A view of Skiles Walkway from the Student Center, facing east.]]
East Campus houses all of the Fraternities and Sororities as well as most of the undergraduate freshman dormitories. Although the residences are similar, East Campus is decidedly more urban than West Campus. East Campus abuts on the [[Downtown Connector]], granting residences quick access to Midtown and its businesses (for example, [[The Varsity]]) via a number of bridges over the highway as well as a tunnel beneath it. Georgia Tech football's home, [[Bobby Dodd Stadium]] is located on East Campus, as well as Georgia Tech basketball's home [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum]]. [[Brittain Dining Hall]] is the main dining hall for East Campus. It is modeled after a [[Gothic architecture|medieval church]], complete with carved [[column]]s and [[stained glass]] windows showing symbolic figures. The main road leading from East Campus to Central Campus is an ascending incline commonly known as "Freshman Hill" (in reference to the large number of freshman dorms near its foot) or simply "The Hill." On [[March 8]], [[2007]], the former Georgia State University Village apartments were transferred to Georgia Tech, and began housing students in the fall semester of 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first=Craig|last=Tabita|url=http://nique.net/issues/2007-03-09/news/1|title=Tech acquires Ga.

=== Central Campus ===
{{seealso|Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District}}
[[Image:Georgia Tech campus.jpg|left|300px|thumb|A view of central campus from the student center, facing northeast.]]
Central Campus is home to the majority of the academic, research, and administrative buildings. The Central Campus includes, among others: the Howey Physics Building; the Boggs Chemistry Building; the College of Computing; the [[Klaus Advanced Computing Building]]; the Skiles Classroom Building, which houses the School of Mathematics and the School of Literature, Communication and Culture; the [[D. M. Smith]] Building, which houses the School of Public Policy and the School of History, Technology, and Society; and the Ford Environmental Science & Technology Building. In 2005, the School of Modern Languages returned to the Swann Building, a 100-year-old former [[dormitory]] that now houses some of the most technology-equipped classrooms on campus. Intermingled with these are a variety of research facilities, such as the Centennial Research Building, the Microelectronics Research Center, the [[Nanotechnology Research Center]], and the Petit Biotechnology Building.

Tech's administrative buildings, such as the Student Services Building ("Flag Building"), [[Tech Tower]], and the Bursar's Office, are also located on the Central Campus, in the recently-renovated [[Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District|Georgia Tech Historic District]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New construction on the Hill recreates historic appearance near Tech Tower|first=Neeraj|last=Kumar|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2000-09-22|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2000-09-22/news/2|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> The campus library, plus a small traditional eatery called [[Junior's Grill]], as well as a large communal building for students, the Fred B. Wenn Student Center (a student union), are also located on Central Campus. The Student Center provides a variety of recreational and social functions for students including: a computer lab, a game room ("Tech Rec"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foef.gatech.edu/techrec/|title=Tech Rec|work=Fun On Every Floor|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-08-23}}</ref> the Student Post Office, a darkened Music Listening Room, a [[movie theater]], the Food Court, plus meeting rooms for various clubs and organizations. Adjacent to the eastern entrance of the Student Center is the [[Kessler Campanile]] (which is referred to by students as "The Shaft"). The former Hightower Textile Engineering building was demolished in 2002 to create Yellow Jacket Park. More greenspace now occupies the area around the Kessler Campanile for a more aesthetically pleasing look, in accordance with the official Campus Master Plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.gatech.edu/masterplan.htm|title=Campus Master Plan|publisher=Georgia Tech Capital Planning & Space Management|date=2004|accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref> Numerous clubs and organizations hold activities in Yellow Jacket Park.

=== Technology Square ===
[[Image:Atltechsquare2.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A view of [[Technology Square]], facing south]]
{{main|Technology Square}}
[[Technology Square]], also known as "Tech Square," is located across the [[Downtown Connector]] and embedded in the city east of East Campus. It is home to the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Management|College of Management]], the official school bookstore, the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center.

Buildings in Tech Square also serve as offices for a number of faculty and graduate students, the [[GVU Center]], the Georgia Tech Enterprise Innovation Institute, the [[Advanced Technology Development Center]], [[VentureLab]], and the Georgia Electronics Design Center. The buildings in Technology Square also host a variety of small restaurants and businesses, as well as business ventures spawned by Georgia Tech research. Opened in 2003, the district was built over run-down neighborhoods and has sparked a revitalization of the entire Midtown area.

''I'm a Ramblin' Wreck'' has had many other notable moments in its history, including being the first school song played in [[space]].<ref name="archive">{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/finding-aids/display/xsl/UA318|title=Inventory of the Georgia Tech Songs Collection, 1900-1953|publisher=Georgia Tech Archives and Records Management|accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref> [[Gregory Peck]] sang the song while strumming a [[ukulele]] in the movie ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]''.

There are numerous stories of commanding officers in [[Higgins boat]]s crossing the [[English Channel]] on the morning of [[D-Day]] leading their men in the song to calm their nerves.<ref name="archive"/> It is played after every Georgia Tech score in a football game.

Another popular fight song is ''Up with the White and Gold'', which is usually played by the band preceding ''Ramblin' Wreck''.

There are many notable graduates, non-graduate former students and current students of Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech alumni are generally known as Yellow Jackets. According to the Georgia Tech [[Alumni association|Alumni Association]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/uploads/bylaws.pdf|title=Bylaws of the Georgia Tech Alumni Association, Inc.|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref>

The first class of 95 students entered Georgia Tech in 1888,<ref name="GTB1">{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/gtbuildings/GTVA-UKL999-A.htm|title=GT Buildings: GTVA-UKL999-A|work=A Thousand Wheels are set in Motion: The Building of Georgia Tech at the Turn of the 20th Century, 1888-1908|publisher=Georgia Tech Library|accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref> and the first two graduates received their degrees in 1890.<ref name="twq">{{cite web|url=https://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/tech_questions.html|title=20 Common Questions about Georgia Tech|publisher=Georgia Tech Archives and Records Management|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> Since then, the institute has greatly expanded, with an enrollment of 12,526 undergraduates and 6,128 postgraduate students [[As of 2007|as of Fall 2007]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irp.gatech.edu/apps/Enrollment/college.cfm?TERM=200702&time_status=Total|title=Enrollment by College, Fall 2007|work=Facts and Figures: Enrollment|publisher=Georgia Tech Institutional Research and Planning|accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>

Many distinguished individuals once called Georgia Tech home. The most notable alumnus is probably [[Jimmy Carter]], former [[President of the United States|President]] of the [[United States]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner, who briefly attended Georgia Tech in the early 1940s prior to matriculating at and graduating from the [[United States Naval Academy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrotc.gatech.edu/history.php|title=History of the NROTC Unit at Georgia Institute of Technology|publisher=Georgia Tech NROTC|accessdate=2007-03-05}}</ref> Another Georgia Tech graduate and [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[Kary Mullis]], received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1993. A large number of businesspeople ([[CEO]]s, directors, etc.) began their careers at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Management|College of Management]]. Some of the most successful of these are [[Charles (Garry) Betty|Charles "Garry" Betty]] (CEO [[Earthlink]]), [[David Dorman]] (CEO [[AT&T Corporation]]), [[Mike Duke]] (CEO [[Wal-Mart]]), and [[James D. Robinson III]] (CEO [[American Express]] and later director of [[The Coca-Cola Company]]).

Tech graduates have been deeply influential in politics, military service, and activism. [[Atlanta]] mayor [[Ivan Allen Jr.|Ivan Allen, Jr.]] and former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Sam Nunn]] have both made significant changes from within their elected offices. Current Georgia Tech president [[G. Wayne Clough]] was also a Tech grad, the first Tech alumnus to serve in that position. Many notable military commanders are alumni; [[William L. Ball]] was the 67th [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], [[John M. Brown III]] is the Commander of the [[United States Army Pacific Command]], and [[Leonard Wood]] was a [[Medal of Honor]] winner for helping capture of the Apache chief [[Geronimo]].<ref name="wood">{{cite news|first=Joseph|last=Byrd|url=http://gtalumni.org/StayInformed/techtopics/spr92/FOW.html|title=From Civil War Battlefields to the Moon: Leonard Wood|work=Tech Topics|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|date=Spring 1992|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> Wood was also Tech's first football coach and (simultaneously) the team captain, and was instrumental in Tech's first-ever football victory in a game against the [[University of Georgia]].<ref name="wood"/>

Numerous [[astronaut]]s and [[NASA]] administrators spent time at Tech; most notably, Retired Vice Admiral [[Richard H. Truly]] was the eighth administrator of NASA, and later served as the president of [[GTRI]]. [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] was the first commander of the [[space shuttle]] and is the only person to have piloted four different classes of spacecraft. Georgia Tech has its fair share of noteworthy engineers, scientists, and inventors. [[Kary Mullis]] developed the [[polymerase chain reaction]], [[Herbert Saffir]] developed the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], and [[W. Jason Morgan]] made significant contributions to the theory of [[plate tectonics]] and [[geodynamics]]. In [[computer science]], [[Krishna Bharat]] developed [[Google News]], [[D. Richard Hipp]] developed [[SQLite]], and [[Chaim Gingold]] and [[Mike Pinkerton]] have contributed to [[Spore (video game)|Spore]] and [[Mozilla]], respectively. Architect [[Michael Arad]] designed the [[World Trade Center Memorial]] in [[New York City]], and [[John Portman]] designed several buildings across the globe, including Atlanta's [[SunTrust Plaza]].

Despite their highly technical backgrounds, Tech graduates are no strangers to the arts or athletic competition. Comedian/actor [[Jeff Foxworthy]] of [[Blue Collar Comedy Tour]] fame, [[Mark Lee]] of [[Third Day]], [[John Salley]] of [[The Best Damn Sports Show Period]], and [[Randolph Scott]] all called Tech home. <!--
