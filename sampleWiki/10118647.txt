'''Yamashita Yoshiaki''' (山下 義韶, [[16 February]] [[1865]]&ndash;[[26 October]] [[1935]], also known as '''Yamashita Yoshitsugu'''), was the first person to have been awarded 10th degree black belt (''[[Dan_rank|jūdan]]'') rank in [[Kodokan]] [[judo]]. He was also a pioneer of judo in the [[United States]]. 

==Early years== 

Yamashita was born in [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa]], [[Japan]]. His father was of the [[samurai]] class.<ref name="tomita">Tomita, Tsuneo. "Histoire du Judo," ''Revue Judo Kodokan'', November 1962, v. 12:5.</ref> As a boy, Yamashita trained in the traditional (''[[koryū]]'') [[Japanese martial arts]] schools of [[Yoshin-ryu|Yōshin-ryū]] and [[Tenjin Shinyo-ryu|Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū]] [[jujutsu]].<ref>Sol, Kim. "Part 8: Kodokan Becomes an Organization."[http://www.bstkd.com/JudoHistory/HistoryEight.htm]</ref> In August 1884, he joined the Kodokan judo [[dojo]] of [[Kano Jigoro]] (嘉納 治五郎 ''Kanō Jigorō'', 1860&ndash;1938), as its nineteenth member. He advanced to first degree black belt (''[[shodan]]'') rank in three months, fourth degree ([[Dan_rank|''yondan'']]) ranking in two years, and sixth degree ([[Dan_rank|''rokudan'']]) in fourteen years.<ref name="tomita">Tomita, Tsuneo.

==Introducing judo to America==

In February 1902, a [[Seattle]]-based [[railroad]] executive named [[Samuel Hill]] decided that his 9-year-old son, James Nathan, should learn judo, which he had apparently seen or heard about while on a business trip to [[Japan]]. In Hill's words, the idea was for the boy to learn "the ideals of the Samurai class, for that class of men is a noble, high-minded class. They look beyond the modern [[Commerce|commercial]] spirit."<ref>Tuhy, John E. ''Sam Hill: The Prince of Castle Nowhere''. Beaverton, Oregon: Timber Press, 1983, p. 71.</ref> Hill spoke to a [[Issei_Japanese_American|Japanese American]] business associate, Masajiro Furuya,<ref>Gary Iwamoto, "Rise & Fall of an Empire", ''International Examiner'', September 6, 2005.</ref> for advice. Furuya referred Hill to Kazuyoshi Shibata, who was a student at [[Yale University]]. Shibata told Hill about Yamashita, and on July 21, 1903, Hill wrote a letter to Yamashita, asking him to come to Seattle at Hill's expense.<ref>Letter from Sam Hill to Y. Yamashita dated 21st Jul 1903, in [[Maryhill Museum of Art]] collection.</ref> On August 26, 1903, Yamashita replied, writing that he, his wife, and one of his students (Saburo Kawaguchi) would leave for Seattle on September 22, 1903.<ref>Letter from Y. Yamashita to Sam Hill dated 26th August, 1903, in Maryhill Museum of Art collection.</ref> 

The ship carrying the Yamashita party docked in Seattle on October 8, 1903.<ref>"List or Manifest of Alien Passengers for the U.S. Immigration Officer at Port of Arrival," SS Shinano Maru, October 8, 1903, in National Archives and Record Administraion microfilm roll M1383, "Passenger and Crew Lists of Vessels Arriving at Seattle, Washington, 1890-1957," Roll 2 (Apr. 17, 1900, SS GOODWIN - Jan. 17, 1904, SS TOSA MARU).</ref> A week later, on October 17, 1903, Yamashita and Kawaguchi gave a judo exhibition at a Seattle theater that Hill had rented for the evening. Attendance was by invitation only, and guests included Sam Hill's mother-in-law, Mary Hill (wife of railroader [[James_J._Hill|J.J. Hill]]), [[United_States_Senate|Senator]] [[Russell Alger]], and assorted [[Sportswriters|sportswriters]].<ref>''Seattle Post-Intelligencer,'' October 25, 1903.</ref>  Afterwards, Hill took the Yamashita party east to [[Washington, D.C.]], where Mrs. Hill and young James Nathan were then living. Meanwhile, the favorable publicity surrounding the event caused Japanese Americans living in Seattle to start their own judo club, known as the [[Seattle Dojo]].

Soon after arriving in the [[District of Columbia]], Yamashita visited the Japanese [[Legation]], and in March 1904, the Japanese naval [[military attaché|attaché]], Commander [[Isamu Takeshita|Takeshita Isamu]], took Yamashita to the [[White House]] to meet President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].<ref>Roosevelt, Theodore.

New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1919, pp. 113-114.</ref> Roosevelt practiced [[wrestling]] and [[boxing]] while in the White House, and he had received [[Judogi|jujutsu jackets]] from [[William Sturgis Bigelow]]<ref>Brousse, Michel and David Matsumoto.

"Professor Yamashita Goes to Washington."[http://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_svinth1_1000.htm]</ref> Subsequently, at other locations, Yamashita and his wife Fude gave lessons to prominent American women, to include Martha Blow Wadsworth (sister of [[Kindergarten]] pioneer [[Susan Blow]]), Hallie Elkins (wife of [[United_States_Senate|Senator]] [[Stephen Benton Elkins]]), and Grace Davis Lee (Hallie Elkins' sister), and their children.<ref>"Jiu-Jitsu for Women," ''Sandow's Magazine,'' December 7, 1905, with annotations by Joseph R.

Lee]].</ref>

In January 1905, Yamashita got a job teaching judo at the [[U.S. Naval Academy]]. There were about 25 students in his class, including a future admiral, [[Robert L. Ghormley]].<ref>''Army and Navy Journal'', March 25, 1905.</ref> The position ended at the end of the school term, and Yamashita was not rehired for the following year.<ref>Sweetman, Jack. ''The U.S. Naval Academy: An Illustrated History,'' 2d edition, revised by Thomas J. Cutler. Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Academy Press, 1995, p. 269.</ref> When President Roosevelt heard of this, he spoke to the [[Charles_Joseph_Bonaparte|Secretary of the Navy]], who in turn told the [[James_H._Sands|Superintendent of the Naval Academy]] to rehire Yamashita.<ref>Memorandum from Charles J. Bonaparte, Secretary of the Navy, to Chief, Bureau of Navigation, dated November 3, 1905, in US Naval Academy archives.</ref> Consequently, Yamashita's judo was taught at the Naval Academy throughout the first six months of 1906.<ref>Letter from Superintendent of Naval Academy to Chief of Bureau of Navigation, Navy Department, dated May 4, 1906, in US Naval Academy Archives.</ref>

==Later life==

At the end of the 1906 academic year, Yamashita left the United States for Japan.<ref>Letter from Imperial Japanese Embassy to the Bureau of Navigation, The Navy Department, dated December 19, 1906, in US Naval Academy archives.</ref>  On July 24, 1906, he participated in a conference in [[Kyoto]] that had been called for the purpose of standardizing judo forms (''[[kata]]'') that could be taught in Japanese public schools. Subsequently, he was employed as a judo teacher at {{Nihongo|Tokyo Higher Normal School|東京高等師範学校|Tōkyō Kōtō Shihan Gakkō''}}.<ref name="svinth">Svinth, Joseph R. "Professor Yamashita Goes to Washington."[http://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_svinth1_1000.htm]</ref> An example of Yamashita's teaching method is the advice:<ref>"Do's and Don'ts in Learning Judo by Yoshiaki Yamashita," JudoInfo.com.[http://www.judoinfo.com/yoshiaki.htm]</ref>

{{cquote|Always try to think of improvement, and don't think that you are too good. The latter is very easy to do while learning judo.}}

From the 1910s until the mid-1930s, Yamashita often attended judo tournaments and exhibitions.<ref>For a description of such an event in [[Kobe]] in 1925, see Frank O'Neill, "The Brown Man in the Field of Sports," ''The Ring,'' November 1925, p. 19.</ref> His last major public appearance was probably the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Kodokan, an event which took place in November 1934. British judoka Sarah Mayer described Yamashita's participation as follows:<ref>Letter from Sarah Mayer to Gunji Koizumi dated November 27, 1934.[http://www.judoinfo.com/mayer.htm][http://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_mayer1_0200.htm]</ref>

{{cquote|One of the Imperial Princes was present and the [[Hirohito|Emperor]] sent a present of money. A speech was read from the [[Okada_Keisuke|Prime Minister]] and the Minister of Education delivered a long oration. All the famous Judo men were there and there was a rather touching scene when Mr. Yamashita, the oldest pupil, came forward. He has lost his voice with advancing years and another man had to read his speech for him, but as he stood facing Prof. Kano I could not help thinking of the long years that these two men, now so old, had struggled to make Judo popular, and what a wonderful day it must be to them to have lived to see such an amazing achievement. Famous men demonstrated beautiful Kata when the speeches were over and Prof. Kano had dedicated three trees to his three teachers, and comic relief was provided by a match between me and Mr. Samura,<ref name="judoinfo">Ohlenkamp, Neil.

His ultimate promotion to 10th ''dan'' was posthumous.<ref name="judoinfo"/>
