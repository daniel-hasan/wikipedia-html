The '''180th Street–Bronx Park''' station was the former [[terminal station]] for the [[IRT White Plains Road Line]] of the [[New York City Subway]]. The line was originally supposed to extend farther north during the construction but was changed into a terminal due to protests stating that the trains running over the park would be bad for animals in the [[Bronx Zoo]]. The line's extension is the reason for the S-curve north of the [[West Farms Square-East Tremont Avenue (IRT White Plains Road Line)|West Farms Square–East Tremont Avenue]] station. After the line's extension to [[Wakefield-241st Street (IRT White Plains Road Line)|Wakefield–241st Street]], the Bronx Park spur was considered redundant, but was not closed and abandoned until 1952. Trackways of the [[Bronx Park]] spur can be seen north of the [[West Farms Square-East Tremont Avenue (IRT White Plains Road Line)|West Farms Square–East Tremont Avenue]] station.

The station's former arrangement was two tracks and an island platform.
