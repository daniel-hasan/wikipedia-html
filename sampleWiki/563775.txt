'''Mildura''' is a regional city in northwestern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], part of the [[Rural City of Mildura]]. Mildura is located in the [[Sunraysia]] region, and is on the banks of the [[Murray River]]. The town's population was 47,168 at the [[2006]] census.

Mildura is also known as the centre of ''Victoria's Food Bowl'' and is a major producer of citrus fruits (especially oranges), and wine. It is also notable for its grape production, supplying 80% of Victoria's grapes <ref name="mrcc">[http://www.localgovernment.vic.gov.au/web20/dvclgv.nsf/AllDocs/27EC5AE7DF0CFECCCA2571610027AEC2?OpenDocument Mildura], ''[[Department of Planning and Community Development]] Mildura Rural City Council'', Accessed September 27, 2007</ref>. Many wineries also source grapes from Mildura.

==Climate==
Mildura enjoys a mostly warm climate.

==History==

Many [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] people lived around the site of Mildura because of the abundant food. Local tribes included the [[Latje Latje]] and [[Yerre Yerre]]. Europeans noticed this abundance and decided to harness it, so they brought sheep to graze the natural pastures.

===Irrigation settlement===
A major [[Drought in Australia|drought]] in Victoria from 1877 to 1884 prompted [[Alfred Deakin]], then a minister in the [[Parliament of Victoria|State Government]] and chairman of a [[Royal Commission]] on water supply to visit the [[irrigation]] areas of California.  There he met [[George Chaffey|George]] and [[William Chaffey]]. 

In 1886 George Chaffey came to Australia and selected a derelict sheep station at Mildura as the site for his first irrigation settlement signing an agreement with the Victorian government to spend at least £300,000 on permanent improvements at Mildura in the next twenty years.<ref name =WChaffeyADB">{{cite web | last = Westcott | first = Peter | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1979 | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070687b.htm | title =  Chaffey, William Benjamin (1856 - 1926) | work = [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] | publisher = Australian National University / Melbourne University Press | accessdate = 2007-02-22}}</ref>

After much political wrangling, the settlement of Mildura was established in 1887. It was named after the Mildura sheep station that provided most of the land. The name is of Aboriginal origin, and means either "red sand" or "sore eyes" <ref name=smhtravelmildura/>.
===Growth===
The nearby towns of [[Wentworth, New South Wales|Wentworth]], [[Gol Gol, New South Wales|Gol Gol]], [[Curlwaa, New South Wales|Curlwaa]] and [[Yelta, Victoria|Yelta]] sprang up in the mid to late 1800s. The number of Aboriginal people started to decrease {{Fact|date=September 2007}}.

In the 1890s came the scourge of the [[Rabbits in Australia|rabbit]]. This devastated the [[sheep]] farmers, especially south of the Murray. There was also a financial recession at this time. Combined, these factors restricted growth of the new settlement.

After this period, the new settlement grew and grew. It was soon the main town of the district. Suburbs and new satellite towns sprang up. In 1934 it officially became a city <ref name=smhtravelmildura/>. Today, Mildura is a bright, thriving regional centre, and the surrounding Sunraysia district has a population of over 50,000.

==Media==
Local newspapers include the [[Sunraysia Daily]], Mildura Midweek, Mildura Weekly and the Mildura Independent Star which ceased publication in 2007. Local radio stations include [[ABC Local Radio]], Easymix 1467AM, 97.9 3MA FM, 99.5 [[Star FM (Australian radio network)|Star FM]], and Hot FM.

Mildura is on the intersection of the [[Sturt Highway]] from [[Adelaide]] to [[Sydney]], and the [[Calder Highway]] to [[Melbourne]] via [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]].

Mildura has a railway connection to Melbourne, which is used for freight transport.  In July 2006, it was announced that the Mildura line would be upgraded using [[gauge convertible]] concrete [[sleepers]].

[[Sunraysia Bus Lines]], [[Swan Hill Bus Lines]] and [[Dyson's Bus Services|Dysons Bus Services]] operate [[V/Line]] bus/train services that connect Mildura to various parts of Victoria and southern NSW. [[Greyhound Australia]] run buses to Adelaide and Sydney via [[Canberra]]. [[Countrylink]] run buses to Sydney. The [[Henty Highway Bus Service]] runs buses to [[Horsham, Victoria|Horsham]].

[[Mildura Airport]] is the third busiest airport in Victoria, serviced by five [[QantasLink]] flights daily to Melbourne, three [[Regional Express]] flights to Melbourne, and two [[O'Connor Airlines]] flights daily to [[Adelaide]]. Regional Express also operates flights to [[Sydney]] several days a week.

Deakin Avenue, the main street of Mildura, is known as the longest straight avenue in Australia, at 12.1km <ref name=smhtravelmildura/>.

==Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone==
[[Image:Fruit Fly exclusion zone.jpg|thumb|Fruit disposal bins and warning signs along the [[Calder Highway]], approaching Mildura.]]
Mildura is part of the '[[Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone]]', in which fruits or vegetables may not be taken into the area (they can, however, be taken out). This is to stop the [[fruit fly]] from invading crops and plantations. Disposal bins into which fruit can be disposed of are located along highways entering the zone.

==Nowingi toxic waste proposal==
In [[2004]] there was a controversial proposal by the [[Victorian Government]] to build a state-level Long Term Containment Facility (LTCF) for Industrial Waste in [[Nowingi, Victoria|Nowingi]], approximately 50 km south of Mildura. The site is a small enclave of [[state forest]] surrounded by [[national park]], and contains habitat important to a number of threatened species. 

Its hydrological composition is disputed, the Environmental Effects Statement (EES) investigations and subsequent evidence predicted that contaminated moisture would take greater than 1000 years to move though the LTCF barrier system. Transport modelling of groundwater contaminants predicted that if contaminants did enter the groundwater, they would move slowly through the Blanchetown Clay and then in a westerly to north-westerly direction towards the Raak Plains, taking thousands of years to finally discharge within the Raak Boinkas in the [[Murray-Sunset National Park]], while local opponents claimed it would flow east through [[Hattah-Kulkyne National Park]] into the [[Murray River]].

The site is around 500 km away from [[Melbourne]], where most of the waste is generated.  Local opponents to the LTCF argued that transporting the waste will incur higher costs and create more opportunity for accident than a LTCF closer to Melbourne.

Local opponents, a group called "Save the Food Bowl Alliance" and local media branded the LTCF the "Mallee Toxic Waste Dump".  The chairman of the "Save the Food Bowl Alliance", Peter Crisp, was elected to Victorian Parliament in 2006, campaigning on this issue.

[[Image:Mildura vines.jpg|thumb|Grape vines growing in Mildura during December 2006.]]
In January [[2007]], the Victorian Government announced that it was abandoning its proposal to build the Long Term Containment Facility at Nowingi.  

It could be argued that its reasoning was that enabling legislation would have had trouble passing both houses of Parliament, with the [[Steve Bracks|Bracks]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Government losing control of the reformed [[Legislative Council]] in the [[Victorian legislative election, 2006|2006 State Election]].  The parties holding the balance of power in the Legislative Council - the [[National Party of Australia|Nationals]], the [[Australian Greens]] and [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] all stating during the election campaign their opposition to the LTCF.  

The Panel Inquiry report found the proposal to be environmentally feasible but recommended against granting approval on strategic planning grounds.  Specifically because it:
• Could fill too soon to provide a sustainable solution for Victoria’s Category B wastes;
• Cannot be reasonably or readily expanded because of its surrounds;
• Would be between two National Parks;
• Would be located in high conservation value remnant vegetation which is habitat of threatened species;
• Would be too distant from waste producers; and
• Would be as a lesser but relevant consideration, constrained by the need to suspend construction during the breeding period of Mallee Emu-wren and Malleefowl.

The abandoning of the LTCF proposal was received with jubilation by opponents of the LTCF not only in the Mildura area and elsewhere in Victoria, but also across the border in [[South Australia]] where there were fears that in reputation, if not in substance, the toxic waste could effect the water supply via the [[Murray River]] and thereby the fruit-growing industries of the [[Riverland]] and [[Murraylands]]. 
 
The Mildura Rural City Council and residents spent almost $2 million fighting the Government's proposal for the LTCF at Nowingi.  On [[10 January]] [[2007]] the Victorian Government did not rule out some form of reimbursement for the [[Rural City of Mildura]] council's legal and other costs in opposing the LTCF.  "The general rule is that people bear their own costs, that is most likely to apply in this case ... but I've indicated and I am prepared to talk to the council and mayor about the whole issue of how Mildura moves forward and I'll do that," John Thwaites said.<ref name=REIMBURSE-2M-MILDURA>{{cite news
