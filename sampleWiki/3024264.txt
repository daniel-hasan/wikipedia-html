'''''Les Amants de Montparnasse''''', (''The Lovers of Montparnasse''), also known as '''''Montparnasse 19''''', is a [[France|French]]/[[Italy|Italian]] [[film]] chronicling the last year of the life of the [[Italy|Italian]] [[painter]] [[Amedeo Modigliani]] who worked and died in abject poverty in the [[Montparnasse Quarter]] of [[Paris]], [[France]]. The film project was initiated by [[Max Ophüls]] who died before the script could be completed, so his name was credited as [[dedicatee]].

The film [[poster]], as seen here, billed the film as '''''"Montparnasse 19"''''', but it is credited as '''''"Les Amants de Montparnasse (Montparnasse 19)"'''''.
