'''''The Simpsons'' ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes''', also known as '''''The Simpsons'' Halloween episodes''', are a series of episodes in the [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. They are [[Halloween]] specials, each consisting of three separate, self-contained segments. These segments usually involve the [[Simpson family]] in some [[Horror film|horror]], [[science fiction]], or [[supernatural]] setting. Considered [[canon (fiction)|non-canon]], they always take place outside the normal continuity of the show and completely abandon any pretense of being realistic. The first ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode aired on [[October 25]], [[1990]] as part of the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|second season]] and was inspired by [[EC Comics]] horror tales. As of 2007, there are 18 ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes, with one airing every year. The episodes are known for being more violent than an average ''Simpsons'' episode and contain several trademarks, including the alien characters [[Kang and Kodos]], "scary names" in the credits, a special version of the opening sequence, and parodies of horror and science fiction films. The show's staff regard the ''Treehouse of Horror'' as being particularily difficult to produce as the scripts often go through many rewrites, and the animators typically have to design new characters and backgrounds. 

Many of the episodes are popular among fans and critics of the show and have inspired a whole off-shoot of ''Simpsons'' merchandise, including action figures, playsets, video games, books, DVDs, comic books and a special version of ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]''. Several of the episodes have won awards for animation and sound editing. In 1996, "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]" was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in the "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)]]" category, but it ultimately lost.

==Segments==
''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes typically consist of four parts: an opening and Halloween-themed version of the credits as well as three segments. These segments usually have a horror, science fiction or fantasy theme and quite often are parodies of films, novels, plays, television shows, ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episodes, or old issues of [[EC Comics]]. Although they are sometimes connected by "wraparounds", the three segments rarely have any kind of continuing connection within the segment. The exception is "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]", in which [[Groundskeeper Willie]] is killed by an axe in a similar fashion in all three segments.<ref name="Mirkin5"/> The segments are considered to be non-canon and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show.<ref name="Groening1"/> From "[[Treehouse of Horror]]" to "[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]", all three segments were written by different writers. In some cases there was a fourth writer who wrote the opening and wraparound segments.<ref name="IV"/> For "Treehouse of Horror", there were even three different directors for the episode.<ref name="I"/> However, starting with [[The Simpsons (season 15)|season 15's]] "[[Treehouse of Horror XIV]]", only one writer was credited as having written a ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode, and the trend has continued since.<ref name="XIV"/><ref name="XV">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XV|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror XV|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Odenkirk, Bill; Silverman, David|network=Fox |airdate=2004-11-04 |season=16|number=01}}</ref><ref name="XVI">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XVI|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror XVI|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Wilmore, Marc; Silverman, David|network=Fox |airdate=2005-11-06 |season=17 |number=04}}</ref><ref name="XVII">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XVII|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror XVII|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Gaffney, Peter; Silverman, David; Faughnan, Matthew|network=Fox |airdate=2006-11-05 |season=18 |number=04}}</ref><ref name="XVIII">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XVIII|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror XVIII|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Wilmore, Marc; Sheetz, Chuck|network=Fox |airdate=2007-11-04 |season=19 |number=05}}</ref> On occasion, the episodes will be used to showcase special animation, such as the "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]" segment "Homer<sup>3</sup>", which uses computer animation. At the time, it was groundbreaking, as it was unheard of for a television show to use such animation. The segment was executive producer [[Bill Oakley]]'s idea and included live action directed by [[David Mirkin]].<ref name="Oakley6"/>

==Traditions==
===Opening sequence===
[[Image:Treehouse of Horror Tombstone.png|right|200px|thumb|Two of the tombstones from the opening segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror]]"]]
Every ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode opens with a special introductory segment. The first, second and fifth ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes open with [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] standing on a stage and warning parents about the content of the episode, advising them to put their children to bed. The warning in the first episode was put in as a sincere effort to warn young viewers, as the producers felt it was somewhat scary.<ref name="Jean1"/> The entire segment was a parody of the opening of the 1931 film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''.<ref name="Reiss1">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Marge's warnings became a burden to write as the years went on and there was no warning for third and fourth ''Treehouse of Horror''s. The tradition was revived for "Treehouse of Horror V" and after that, they were permanently dropped<ref name="Jean2"/> and the writers did not make any attempts at reviving them.<ref name="Oakley6">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VI"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Other ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes open with parodies, for example "Treehouse of Horror III" had Homer introduce the episode in a way similar to [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''<ref name="III"/> and "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]" featured a parody of ''[[The Outer Limits]]''.<ref name="V"/> The [[Treehouse of Horror VI|sixth]] and [[Treehouse of Horror VII|seventh]] episodes featured short clips with no lines because the episodes had run long and longer segments were cut.<ref name="Oakley6"/> Following "Treehouse of Horror VII", the opening can be upwards of a minute long and sometimes feature an introduction by a character, such as [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] in "[[Treehouse of Horror XVII]]"<ref name="XVII"/> or include over the top violence, such as "[[Treehouse of Horror VIII]]" which shows a [[FOX Network]] censor being  brutally murdered and "[[Treehouse of Horror XIV]]" which showed the Simpson family killing each other.<ref name="XIV"/>

In the opening segment of the first five episodes, the camera zooms through a cemetery where tombstones with humorous messages written on them can be seen. These messages include the names of canceled shows from the previous season, celebrities such as [[Walt Disney]] and [[Jim Morrison]]<ref name="II"/> and other messages such as one that read "TV violence", but was then filled with bullet holes. They were last used in "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]", which included a single tombstone with the words "Amusing Tombstones" to signal this.<ref name="V">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror V|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror V |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Daniels, Greg; McGrath, Dan; Cohen, David S.; Kushell, Bob; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=1994-10-30 |season=6 |number=06}}</ref> The Tombstone gags were easy for the writers in the first episode, but like Marge's warnings, they eventually got more difficult to write, so they were abandoned.<ref name="Reiss1"/> Another reason they were dropped was because the tombstones would list television shows that had been canceled the previous season and after a few years, several of the shows that were canceled were produced by ex-''Simpsons'' writers.<ref name="Groening5">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror V"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> 

While the early ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes featured a Halloween themed opening sequence, the later ones only included the title and the "created by" and "developed by" credits. Every episode between "Treehouse of Horror II" and "[[Treehouse of Horror X]]" featured a couch gag with a Halloween theme, examples of which included the Simpson family dressed as skeletons,<ref name="II"/> Zombies<ref name="IV"/> and characters from previous Halloween episodes.<ref name="X"/>

===Wraparounds===
[[Image:Treehouse of Horror.png|right|200px|thumb|Bart and Lisa tell scary stories to each other in "[[Treehouse of Horror]]"]]
The first four ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes had wraparounds that occurred before each segment and loosely tied together all three stories. "Treehouse of Horror" was the only one that actually included a treehouse as a setting.<ref name="Groening1"/> In that episode, Bart and Lisa sat in it telling stories to each other.<ref name="Groening1"/><ref name="I">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace; Simon, Sam; Archer, Wes; Moore, Rich; Silverman, David|network=Fox |airdate=1990-10-25 |season=2 |number=03}}</ref> "[[Treehouse of Horror II]]" presented all of the segments as being nightmares of Lisa, Bart and Homer;<ref name="II">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror II|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror II|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Meyer, George; Reiss, Mike; Jean, Al; Martin, Jeff; Simon, Sam; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=1991-10-31 |season=3 |number=07}}</ref> "[[Treehouse of Horror III]]" had Lisa, Bart and [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] telling stories at a Halloween party;<ref name="III"/> and "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]" is presented by Bart in a parody of [[Rod Serling|Rod Serling's]] ''[[Night Gallery]]''.<ref name="IV">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror IV|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror IV|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=O'Brien, Conan; Weinstein, Josh; Oakley, Bill; Daniels, Greg; McGrath, Dan; Canterbury, Bill; Silverman, David|network=Fox |airdate=1993-10-28 |season=04 |number=05}}</ref> The wraparounds were abandoned after a few years because eventually, the amount of broadcast time for an episode was shortened and they were cut so that the segments could be longer.<ref name="Jean2">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al |year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror II"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> There were no wraparounds for "Treehouse of Horror V" because they had been cut to make more time for the segments, and following that, the writers permanently dropped them.<ref name="Weinstein7">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh |year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VII"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

===Kang and Kodos===
[[Image:THOH Kang and Kodos.png|left|200px|thumb|Kang and Kodos laugh uproariously in their brief cameo in "[[Treehouse of Horror III]]"]]
{{main|Kang and Kodos}}
Two characters that are virtually exclusive to the ''Treehouse of Horror'' series are [[Kang and Kodos]], who are a pair of large green space aliens who were introduced in the "Hungry are the Damned" segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror]]". Kang and Kodos have since appeared in every ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode, sometimes as important parts of a story, but often just for brief cameos. In some episodes, they only appear in the opening segment,<ref name="XIV"/><ref name="X">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror X|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror X |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cary, Donick; Long, Tim; Hauge, Ron; Michels, Pete|network=Fox |airdate=1999-10-31 |season=11 |number=04}}</ref> but quite often they will make a cameo appearance in the middle of a different story. For example, a story about zombies attacking the town will suddenly show them in space, watching the events and laughing maniacally at the Earthlings' suffering. The action will then switch back to the actual story.<ref name="III">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror III|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror III |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace; Simon, Sam and Vitti, Jon|network=Fox |airdate=1992-10-29|season=04|number=05}}</ref> The unofficial rule is that they must be in every episode,<ref name="Jean1"/> although quite often they will be forgotten and are added at the last second, leading to some of their appearancess being short.<ref name="Groening1"/> Their scene in "[[Treehouse of Horror VIII]]" nearly did not make the final cut of the episode, but [[David X. Cohen]] managed to persuade the producers to leave the scene in.<ref name="Cohen8">{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X. |year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VIII"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

==="Scary names"===
[[Image:Treehouse of Horror Spooky names.png|200px|right|thumb|The "scary names" for the writers in "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]". Due to the number of writers, the credits took up the entire screen.]]
"Scary names" is the name given by the show's production staff to the special version of the credits that air only during the ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes. Starting with "[[Treehouse of Horror II]]", the producers decided to give the cast and crew of the show "scary names" in the opening and closing credits. Although the names quickly became more silly than scary, there have been a wide variety of special credits, from simple names like "Bat Groening" to complex ones like "David²+S.²+Cohen²".<ref name="VI">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror VI|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror VI |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Cohen, David S.; Tompkins, Steve; Anderson, Bob|network=Fox |airdate=1995-10-29 |season=07 |number=06}}</ref> [[Sam Simon]], who left the show during the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]], has ever since been credited as "Sam 'Sayanora' Simon". The idea came from executive producer [[Al Jean]], who was inspired by [[EC Comics]] because some of the issues also used "scary" alternate names.<ref name="Jean1"/> The "scary names" became such a burden to write that they were cut for "Treehouse of Horror XII" and "Treehouse of Horror XIII", but after hearing complaints from the fans, Jean decided to bring them back.<ref name="Jean3"/> [[Matt Groening]]'s rule for the "scary names" is that they can not be longer than a person's real name, but this is rarely followed by anyone else.<ref name="Groening6">{{cite video|people=Groening, Matt|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VI"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

===Cultural references===
References to films, novels, plays, television shows and other media are quite common and many segments have been complete parodies of something. Many segments are spoofs of episodes of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' and entire segments will be based on a single episode.<ref name="Kogen1">{{cite video | people=Kogen, Jay|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>  Some of the ''Twilight Zone'' episodes parodied include "[[To Serve Man (The Twilight Zone)|To Serve Man]]",<ref name="BBCI">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season2/page3.shtml|title=The Simpsons Halloween Special|accessdate=2007-11-09|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> "[[A Small Talent for War]]",<ref name="BBCII">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season3/page7.shtml|title=The Simpsons Hallowe'en Special II|accessdate=2007-11-09|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> "[[Living Doll (The Twilight Zone)|Living Doll]]",<ref name="BBCIII">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season4/page6.shtml|title=Treehouse of Horror III|accessdate=2007-11-09|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> "[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]",<ref name="BBCIV">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season5/page6.shtml|title=Treehouse of Horror IV|accessdate=2007-11-09|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> "[[Little Girl Lost]]",<ref name="BBCVI">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page6.shtml|title=Treehouse of Horror VI|accessdate=2007-11-09|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> and "[[The Little People]]".<ref name="Anderson">{{cite video | people=Anderson, Mike B.|year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VII"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The "The Bart Zone" segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror II]]" parodies the episode "[[It's a Good Life (The Twilight Zone)|It's a Good Life]]" and is even presented in a format similar to an episode of ''The Twilight Zone''.<ref name="BBCII"/> The Halloween episodes also regularly parody horror films such as ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'',<ref name="BBCI"/> ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'',<ref name="BBCIII"/> ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'',<ref name="BBCV">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season6/page6.shtml|title=Treehouse of Horror V|accessdate=2007-11-09|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'',<ref name="BBCVI"/> and ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]''.<ref name="BBCVIII">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season9/page4.shtml|title=Treehouse of Horror VIII|accessdate=2007-11-09|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Science fiction films have also occasionally been used as inspiration for segments, and in later episodes many of the segments were based more on science fiction than horror.

==Production==
[[Image:Aljean.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Al Jean]] has been executive producer for more ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes than any other EP.]]
The first ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode aired in 1990 as part of [[The Simpsons (season 2)|the second season]], and its on-screen title was "The Simpsons Hallowe'en Special." It was inspired by [[EC Comics]] Horror tales.<ref name="Jean1">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al |year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Although every episode is entitled "Treehouse of Horror", the first one was the only episode that actually used the treehouse motif.<ref name="Groening1"/>

The Treehouse of Horror episodes are difficult for both the writers and the animators.<ref name="Reiss1"/> The episodes were originally written at the beginning of the production run, but in later seasons they were written at the end and aired at the beginning of the next season as holdovers, thus giving the animators more time to work.<ref name="Jean1"/> Part of the difficulty for the animators is that the episodes always involve many complex backgrounds, new characters, and new designs.<ref name="Jean1"/> They are difficult for the writers because they must produce three stories, an opening and, in the early episodes, a wraparound. They would have to try to fit all of this into a 20-22 minute episode.<ref name="Mirkin4">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VI"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The episodes often go through many last minute changes such as rewrites, and new lines are recorded.<ref name="Reiss2">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror II"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> "Treehouse of Horror III" in particular underwent somewhere between 80 and 100 line changes in the six week period between when the animation came back from Korea and the airing of the episode.<ref name="Jean3">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al |year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> By the fourth season, executive producers [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] were less enamored with ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes and considered dropping them, but the other writers insisted that they be kept.<ref name="Jean3"/> 
[[Image:Davidmirkin.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[David Mirkin]] believes the episodes should be both scary and funny and has been responsible for some of the more gruesome moments.]]
Part of the attraction for the writers is that they are able to break the rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode.<ref name="Groening1">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> In some cases, the writers will have an idea that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode and are used as segments.<ref name="Jean1"/> Several of the writers, former executive producer [[David Mirkin]] among them, believe that the episodes should be scary and not just funny.<ref name="Mirkin4"/> "Treehouse of Horror V" has been described by Mirkin as being "the most intense, disturbing Halloween show ever" as it was filled with violence and gore in response to new censorship rules.<ref name="Mirkin5">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VI"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Although gruesome for the most part, some segments, such as "Citizen Kang" in "[[Treehouse of Horror VII]]", satirize political issues. In "[[Treehouse of Horror XVII]]", a segment called "The Day the Earth Looked Stupid" ends with Kang and Kodos taking over Springfield as part of a mission called "Operation: Enduring occupation". The script originally called for Kodos and Kang to look over the smoking ruins of Springfield and say "This sure is a lot like Iraq will be." The Fox network did not have any objection to the line, but it was rejected by some of the writers as too obvious and was cut from broadcast. While cut from the aired version, the line does appear in the "review" version sent to newspapers and magazines.<ref name="ABCNews_20061023">{{cite news | url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=2600380&page=1 | date=[[October 23]], [[2006]] | title='Simpsons' Halloween 'Horror' Could Hit GOP | last=Redeker | first=Bill | publisher=ABC News}}</ref>

The first "Treehouse of Horror" episode was the first time that an alternate version of the theme that airs over the end credits was used. Originally it was supposed to use a [[Theramin]], but one could not hit all the necessary notes.<ref name="Groening1"/> Usually when the producers submit an episode for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore)", they submit a Treehouse of Horror episode,<ref name="Jean1"/> and to date, seven episodes have been nominated.<ref name="Emmys"/> The closing of "Treehouse of Horror IV" features a version of the theme that is a combination of the instruments from ''[[The Munsters]]'' theme song and the harpiscord and clicking from the ''[[The Addams Family (TV series)|Addams Family]]'' theme song.<ref name="Mirkin4"/> 

Although the series is meant to be seen on Halloween, in recent years new episodes have premiered in November. This is due to [[FOX]]'s current contract with [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Pick of the Day: The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror XVII|last=Ryan|first=Andrew|publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date=[[2006-11-04]]|pages=p. 12}}</ref> [[The Simpsons (season 12)|Season 12]]'s "[[Treehouse of Horror XI]]" was the first episode to air in November, and this has continued since. There have been several references to this in the show, such as in "[[Treehouse of Horror XIV]]" where Kang looks at a ''[[TV Guide]]'' and says, "A Halloween special in November?" and Kodos replies "We've already got our Christmas decorations up!" The camera then cuts to a shot of the fireplace with Christmas decorations, complete with multi-legged stockings and alien reindeer, scattered about, and festive Christmas music plays over the opening credits.<ref name="XIV">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XIV|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror XIV |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Moore, Steven Dean|network=Fox |airdate=2003-11-02 |season=15 |number=01}}</ref>

However, the award went to an episode of ''[[Pinky & The Brain]]''.
