The '''Toyota Aurion''' ''(pronounced or-ree-on)'' is a [[full-size car]] produced by [[Toyota]] in [[Australia]] and parts of [[Asia]] since 2006. The Aurion is essentially a [[Toyota Camry#Sixth generation (2006-present)|sixth generation Toyota Camry]] with revised front- and rear-end treatment, along with changes to the interior.<ref name = "2007 Toyota Aurion Sportivo ZR6 Road Test">{{cite web | date = [[2007-02-22]] | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/1598/2007-toyota-aurion-sportivo-zr6-road-test/ | title = 2007 Toyota Aurion Sportivo ZR6 Road Test | publisher = CarAdvice.com.au Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-08-31}}</ref> The Camry-based Aurion is also sold in the majority of [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]] as the '''Toyota Camry''', with the original version of the Camry sold alongside the Aurion in the [[Middle East]] and [[Australasia]] (Australasia being Australia and [[New Zealand]]). In the previous two markets, the car replaces the [[Toyota Avalon|Avalon]] model, which can trace its roots back to the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.motorauthority.com/news/sedans/toyota-oz-releases-its-camry-aurion-sedan/ | title =  Toyota Oz releases its <s>Camry</s> Aurion sedan | publisher = Motor Authority | date = [[2006-10-18]] | accessdate = 2007-10-22}}</ref>

In the Middle Eastern and Australasian regions, to further differentiate the Aurion from its Camry sibling, Toyota equips the former exclusively with a 3.5&nbsp;litre [[V6 engine]] engine. With the [[Toyota Camry]] however, only the 2.4&nbsp;litre four-cylinder model is offered.<ref>{{cite web | last = Darukhanawalla | first = Neville | date = [[2007-01-24]] | url =

The [[powertrain]]s used in the Asian specification Camry vary slightly from those of the Aurion. As well as the 3.5&nbsp;litre V6, two four-cylinder engines are offered in either 2.0&nbsp;litre or a 2.4&nbsp;litre form. These engines are mated with a six-, four- and five-speed [[automatic transmission]]s respectively.<ref name = "MTM">{{cite web | url =  http://www.motortrader.com.my/NUS/articles/article_57/page_m.asp | title = All-New Toyota Camry | publisher = MTM Publications Sdn.

== History of development ==
Before the official unveiling of the Toyota Aurion at the 2006 [[Melbourne International Motor Show]], [[Toyota Australia]] manufactured the [[Full-size car|full-size]] [[Toyota Avalon|Avalon]] model at its [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]] plant in [[Melbourne]]. Production of the Avalon had commenced in 2000, and had taken much of its basic design and mechanical features from the then five-year-old Avalon model designed in the [[United States]]. The Avalon was offered as a larger, more upmarket car than the [[Toyota Camry]], which it was built alongside with.<ref name = "Motor express">{{cite web | date = [[2006-02-06]] | url = http://www.mellor.net/mellor/enews.nsf/edition/EB2772816ADDFDA5CA25710F002CB5F7/$file/GoAuto_enews322.pdf| title = The Aurion express | publisher = John Mellor Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-08-25}}</ref> The original sales predictions were not met with the Avalon, failing to challenge rivals such as the [[Holden Commodore]] and the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]]. The reasoning behind this translated back to the outdated design and lack of [[Car handling|dynamic ability]]. In its best year, the Avalon only managed to reach half of Toyota's sales target, with many potential buyers opting for the similarly sized [[V6 engine|V6]] Camry, featuring the same engine as the Avalon.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2006-02-10]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/news/now-its-round-two-for-toyota/2006/02/09/1139465785084.html | title = Now it's round two for Toyota | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2007-08-21}}</ref>

[[Image:2006-2007 Toyota Aurion AT-X.jpg|thumb|left|The the base model AT-X features the ''comfort'' design, which it shares with both the second tier Prodigy and the top-of-the-line Presara variants.]]

Toyota, discovering that the Australian public wanted something that was Australian and modern, began working on the Aurion in 2003. The development kick-started when Nick Hogios left [[Ford Motor Company of Australia|Ford Australia]] and joined Toyota, working in [[Japan]] on the design of the Aurion. Hogios became the chief designer of the car. He previously worked on designing the ''XR'' performance models of the [[Ford BA Falcon]], and claims that the Aurion follows the traits of current Australian styling, with a tendency to look towards [[Europe]]an designs for inspiration. Unlike the Avalon, the Aurion is a new model designed for Australians.<ref name = "Aurion launches">{{cite web | date = [[2006-10-18]] | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/toyota-aurion-1.htm | title = Toyota Launches Aurion V6 Large Car | publisher = Web Wombat Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-08-17}}</ref>

Paul Beranger was the head of ''Toyota Styling Australia'', which was a team that had regular discussions with Toyota Japan, to come to decisions about how the car would turn out. Aurion, being the first time that Toyota Australia designed their own car, took ''Toyota Styling Australia'' some time to convince Toyota Japan that the Australian division could indeed design and make the Aurion. Successful [[Concept car|concept]] designs, notably the Sportivo Coupe and Avalon X-Runner [[Pickup truck|utility]] helped convince Toyota Japan to allow the project to be undertaken.<ref name = "Motor express"/>

On [[February 9]], [[2006]], Toyota Australia unveiled the Aurion alongside the Aurion Sportivo concept at the Melbourne International Motor Show at an official press release. Toyota dropped the Avalon tag for their new large car, as it had gained a reputation to be an uninspiring car, both in flesh and to drive. Toyota made use of the ''Aurion'' name to give the car a fresh start.<ref name = "Name choices">{{cite web | last = Blackburn | first = Richard  | date = [[2006-10-16]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=20987 | title = What difference does a name make?| publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-08-16}}</ref> Aurion means "tomorrow" in [[Ancient Greek]], and [[wiktionary:Aurora|Aurora]] translates to "the dawn" in [[Latin]]. This gives implications of a completely new car and ties in with Toyota's [[advertising]] slogan, "Can't wait for tomorrow".<ref name = "Name choices"/> The name was chosen after [[Marketing research|consumer research]] on more than 30 potential names.<ref name = "Black Falcon Media Group">{{cite web | url = http://www.worldcarfans.com/2061017.005/new-toyota-aurion-in-depth-au | title = New Toyota Aurion in Depth (AU) | publisher = Black Falcon Media Group Oy | accessdate = 2007-09-01}}</ref> 

===Design===
With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche in the market sector. The base model [[#AT-X|AT-X]], and luxury [[#Prodigy|Prodigy]] and [[#Presara|Presara]] variants employ the ''comfort'' design, with the more aggressive ''sports''-oriented style found on the [[#Sportivo|Sportivo]] versions.<ref>{{citation | last = Robinson | first = Peter | title = Back from the dread | publisher = [[Australian Consolidated Press]] | journal = [[Wheels magazine]] | pages = 50–54 | date = November 2006}}</ref> In addition to this, there are also two [[Toyota Racing Development|TRD]] high performance versions, which advance further on the ''sports''-orientated theme.<ref name = "Aurion launches"/> 

[[Image:2006-2007 Toyota Aurion Presara interior 01.jpg|thumb|right|The luxury interior of the Presara, featuring [[Global Navigation Satellite System|satellite navigation]] and [[wood grain]] trim.]] 

Toyota claims that the Aurion is designed to Australian tastes, although it has been designed with markets such as [[Asia]] in mind.<ref name = "Aurion launches"/> In addition, the Aurion, like other recent Toyota vehicles, was designed with Toyota's "vibrant clarity" design language. According to chief designer Nick Hogios, the Toyota Aurion was designed with a "vibrant clarity" theory known as "perfect imbalance". This involved body features that act as a counter-point to other body features. Examples of this include intersecting [[concave]] and [[convex]] surfaces and vertical sculpted features on the front fascia, which are balanced by horizontal [[headlamp]]s.<ref name = "Black Falcon Media Group"/>

Aurion takes its doors, side windows, windscreen and roof panels from the [[Toyota Camry#Sixth generation (2006-present)|sixth generation Toyota Camry]]. The reasoning behind this strategy was to reduce costs, allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, allowing for a simplified manufacturing process. However, the other panels in the Aurion are unique from the Camry.<ref name = "2007 Toyota Aurion Sportivo ZR6 Road Test"/> The two vehicles also share a common interior design. This again comes back to cost, and simplified production. To distance the Aurion away from its Camry stable mate, a different [[dashboard]] layout, [[steering wheel]], and driving gauges are implemented.<ref>{{cite web | last = Spinks | first = Jez | date = [[2006-09-21]] | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/news/toyota-aurion/2006/09/21/1158431830197.html?page=2 | title = Toyota Aurion | publisher = Fairfax Media | accessdate = 2007-10-04}}</ref>

In its most basic form, the Aurion features a European exterior style, with understated looks and minimalistic chrome highlights around the [[grille]] and along the doors. For certain markets like [[People's Republic of China|China]], where Toyota sits right below [[Mercedes-Benz]], as a luxury brand, it is important for the Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles.<ref>{{cite web | last = Jian | first = Li | date = [[2005-04-28]] | url = http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2005/0428/fo4-1.html | title = In lane for luxury | publisher = Shanghai Star | accessdate = 2007-09-14}}</ref> Unlike the luxury Aurions, the Sportivo variants are designed to have an aggressive, more sports-oriented style. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17&nbsp;inch [[alloy wheel]]s, a rear [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]], different headlight and taillight designs, and a sports [[body kit]]. Both the Sportivo SX6 and ZR6 have identical exterior designs, differing only by their internal features and pricing. The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned [[Formula One]]-inspired front [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]], with integrated foglamps, a unique rear bumper with fixed [[Exhaust system|tailpipes]].<ref name = "Black Falcon Media Group"/>

=== Safety ===
Safety was a key aspect in the development of the Aurion. All safety features are standard across the entire range and there are no optional safety devices. Features such as dual front, side and curtain [[airbag]]s, [[traction control]], [[brake assist]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] and [[Electronic Stability Control|Vehicle Stability Control]] come standard. In recent tests conducted by [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]], the base model scored a four-star rating, with 30.03 out of 37 points, giving it a marginally better score than its Ford and Holden rivals.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.howsafeisyourcar.com.au/_scripts/ancap_detail.php?IID=15289 | title = 2006 Toyota Aurion ANCAP | publisher = How safe is your car? | accessdate = 2007-08-17}}</ref> Toyota caused controversy by not providing a third test vehicle for ANCAP to use for the optional "side-pole impact test". This third and optional test, allows tested vehicles to be eligible for a five star rating if the initial score is high enough. Toyota cited the additional expense of [[Australian dollar|AU$]]75,000-$100,000 including the car as being unjustifiable, and that they did not agree with the nature of the pole test. The scores given without the optional test indicate that the maximum two points that could have been earned would have being slightly less than needed to give the Aurion a five star rating anyway.<ref>{{cite web | last = McKinnon | first = Bill | date = [[2007-05-04]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=38523&pg=3&vf=0&IsPgd=0 | title = Crash test stand-off | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-11-30}}</ref>

== Engine and mechanicals ==
The Aurion employs a version of Toyota's ''[[Toyota GR engine#2GR-FE|2GR-FE]]'' [[V6 engine]] that also powers the [[Toyota Camry#Sixth generation (2006-present)|sixth generation Toyota Camry]] outside of Australia. With an [[engine displacement]] of 3.5&nbsp;litres, the ''2GR-FE'' engine is capable of outputting 200&nbsp;kilowatts (268&nbsp;hp) of power and 336&nbsp;newton metres (248&nbsp;ft·lbf) of [[torque]]. Acceleration figures for the car have been recorded at 7.4&nbsp;seconds for the standard 0–100&nbsp;km/h (0–62&nbsp;mph) test, and Toyota claims a top speed of 228&nbsp;km/h (141&nbsp;mph).<ref>{{cite web | last = Dowsey | first = David | date = [[2006-12-01]] | url = http://editorial.carsales.com.au/car-review/2261246.aspx | title = Toyota Aurion Prodigy | publisher = Carsales | accessdate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> These figures make the Aurion more powerful than Ford's [[Ford BF Falcon|BF Falcon]] and the [[Holden VE Commodore|VE Commodore]] by Holden. As well as being the most powerful of the three, the Aurion also takes home the title of being the most [[Fuel efficiency|fuel efficient]], with consumption rated at {{Auto L/100km|9.9}}.<ref>{{cite web | last = McKinnon | first = Bill | date = [[2007-07-27]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=38261&vf=15 | title = Toyota Aurion AT-X | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-07-28}}</ref> The [[European emission standards|Euro IV]] compliant ''2GR-FE'' engine which employs dual [[VVT-i]] is coupled to Toyota's six-speed ''[[Toyota U transmission#U660E|U660E]]'' [[automatic transmission]]. This same transmission is also utilised by the [[Supercharger|supercharged]] [[Toyota Racing Development|TRD]] variants. These variants produce 241&nbsp;kilowatts (323&nbsp;hp) and 400&nbsp;newton metres (295&nbsp;ft·lbf) of power and torque respectively, and have a combined fuel economy of {{Auto L/100km|10.9}}.<ref name = "TRD powertrain">{{cite web | last = Carey | first = John | date = [[2007-09-01]] | url = http://www.wheelsmag.com.au/wheels/site/articleIDs/8C122C3C321DC11ECA2573550012A9E2 | title = Toyota TRD Aurion | publisher = [[Australian Consolidated Press]] | accessdate = 2007-10-04}}</ref>

In some [[Asia]]n countries where the Aurion is sold as the Toyota Camry, both 2.0 and 2.4&nbsp;litre powerplants are offered. More specifically, in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] the 3.5&nbsp;litre engine is also available in the same configuration as the Australian version. However, the [[Supercharger|supercharged]] version fitted to the TRD Aurion is not. The 2.0&nbsp;litre ''[[Toyota AZ engine#1AZ-FE|1AZ-FE]]'' [[Straight-4|straight-four]] has a maximum output of 103&nbsp;kilowatts (145&nbsp;hp) of power and 190&nbsp;newton metres (140&nbsp;ft·lbf) of torque. These figures rise to 123&nbsp;kilowatts (165&nbsp;hp) and 224&nbsp;newton metres (165&nbsp;ft·lbf) when the 2.4&nbsp;litre ''[[Toyota AZ engine#2AZ-FE|2AZ-FE]]'' unit is fitted. Of the two four-cylinder motors, the latter is united with Toyota's five-speed ''[[Toyota U transmission#U250E|U250E]]'' automatic, with the ''[[Toyota U transmission#U241E|U241E]]'' four-speed unit reserved for the 2.0&nbsp;litre model.<ref name = "MTM"/>

[[Image:Toyota Camry (sixth generation) (rear), Serdang.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The Aurion is sold in some Asian markets as the [[Toyota Camry]], shown here in 2.0 G guise.]] 

Toyota launched the Aurion in [[Australasia]], where it competes with the rear-wheel-drive [[Ford Falcon]], [[Holden Commodore]], and the [[front-wheel drive]] [[Mitsubishi 380]]. The TRD variants are pitched to compete with the [[Subaru Legacy|Subaru Liberty GT]] and [[Mazda Atenza|Mazda 6 MPS]].<ref>{{citation | last = Dupriez | first = Curt | title = Aurion Express | publisher = [[Australian Consolidated Press]] | journal = [[Motor magazine]] | pages = 76–82 | date = October 2007}}</ref>  

Prior to its introduction, a target of 24,000 annualised sales were predicted for the [[Australian]] market, double that of the [[Toyota Avalon|Avalon’s]] eventual sales rate. A further 8,000 vehicles were forecasted to be sent abroad to the [[Middle East]] and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://racv.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/RT/4F0B590EC335FE8ECA25720B001A263E_Launch+Story?OpenDocument | title = Toyota Aurion sedan range | publisher = John Mellor Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-10-10}}</ref> Starting from 2007, Toyota received a contract to deliver 10,000 export Aurions to the [[Middle East]].<ref name = "Times Newspapers">{{cite web | url = http://www.times.co.nz/cms/lifestyle/motoring/2006/12/art100014452.php | title = Toyota looks to Tomorrow | publisher = Times Newspapers | accessdate = 2007-10-03}}</ref>

Toyota also manufactures and markets the Aurion in parts of [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], where it is marketed under the [[Toyota Camry]] branding. This model gets a redesigned [[grille]] and are marketed under different trim levels to their Australasian counterparts. Although these vary from country to country, the range is comprised of the following models in some markets: 2.0 G, 2.0 E, 2.4 G, 2.4 E, 2.4 Sportivo, 3.5 V, and 3.5 Q.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://tw.autos.yahoo.com/newcar_model/id/600.html | title = 2007 Toyota Camry | language = Mandarin | publisher = Yahoo!

Toyota unveiled the Aurion Sports Concept at the 2006 [[Australian International Motor Show]], held in [[Sydney]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Torr | first = Fean | date = [[2006-10-27]] | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/australian-motor-show-2006.htm | title = 2006 Australian International Motor Show: Part I | publisher = WebWombat Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-10-12}}</ref> The AU$8 million [[concept car]] was a styling exercise previewing the '''TRD Aurion''', which was subsequently released in August 2007.<ref name = "Wheels magazine TRD Aurion">{{citation | title = TRD Aurion | year = 2007 | magazine = [[Wheels magazine]]: September 2007 | pages = 72–82}}</ref> TRD’s first experiment with supercharger technology was with the 2005 Camry V6 based, [[Toyota Camry TS-01|TS-01]] concept which produced satisfying results.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2005-03-10]] | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/toyota-ts-01.htm | title = TS-01 Concept: Toyota Flexes Muscles | publisher = WebWombat Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-10-12}}</ref> 

The project's exterior design manager was Lee Moran, a former [[Ford Australia]] designer. He was chosen by ''Toyota Styling Australia'' chief Paul Berninger in 2005. One of Moran’s focuses was to reduce the size of the grille and add emphasis to the front [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]] line below it. This was done so the car had more of a [[Formula One]] oriented look. In the Toyota wind tunnel in Japan, the vehicle's [[drag coefficient]] was confirmed at 0.30, meaning that the car would operate better [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamically]] than its non-TRD variants.<ref name = "Wheels magazine TRD Aurion"/> The TRD also features bold exterior additions that differentiate it with the standard Aurion range, such as [[Exhaust system|exhaust pipes]] integrated into the bumper, tinted taillight lenses, and a unique [[bodykit]].<ref name = "TRD Aurion">{{cite web | last = Hagon | first = Toby | date = [[2007-08-20]] | url = http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=42676&vf=26&pg=2 | title = TRD Aurion hints at Toyota excitement| publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-08-25}}</ref> Along with the [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 3.5&nbsp;litre [[V6 engine]] outputting 241&nbsp;kilowatts (323&nbsp;hp) of power and 400&nbsp;newton metres (295&nbsp;ft·lbf) of [[torque]], the TRD also incorporates an upgraded [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system and [[Tire|tyres]] over the standard Aurion models to improve [[car handling]].<ref name = "TRD powertrain"/>
 
Toyota Australia plans to sell 50–70 TRD Aurion units per month with the majority of the sales coming from Australia,<ref name = "Wheels magazine TRD Aurion"/> with the range comprising of two variants, the '''3500S''' and '''3500SL'''. The former of the two features performance [[muffler]]s, 19&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, red alcantara leather seats with black alcantara fabric bolsters and other high performance upgrades.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2007-09-17]] | url = http://www.caradvice.com.au/6306/2007-trd-aurion-3500s-road-test/ | title = 2007 TRD Aurion 3500S Road Test | publisher = CarAdvice.com.au Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-10-22}}</ref> The range-topping 3500SL adds clearance and reverse [[parking sensors]], dual-zone climate control air conditioning, a colour-coded [[Gear stick|selection lever]], and an eight-way adjustable driver's seat.<ref>{{cite web | date = [[2005-08-21]] | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/trd-aurion.htm | title = TRD Aurion: Toyota's Supercharged Hero Car | publisher = WebWombat Pty Ltd | accessdate = 2007-10-12}}</ref> Furthermore, the 3500SL gains an [[aluminium]] rear bumper reinforcement addition, and is the first production car in the world to use the [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] twin-vortices supercharger.
