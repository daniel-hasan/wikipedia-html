'''Milburn''' is an [[indie rock]] band from [[Sheffield]], [[England]] that consists of Joe Carnall, Louis Carnall, Tom Rowley, and Joe Green.

==History==
===Formation===

Milburn started out playing small gigs in front of friends, practising at drummer Joe Green's Grandma's house. The origin of their name comes from a bet with a friend whose surname was Milburn.

===Rising fame===

In [[2002]] they sold out the [[Boardwalk (nightclub)|The Boardwalk]] twice and played at the [[Cavern Club]] in Liverpool, [[The Garage]] in London and [[Leadmill]] in Sheffield, while supporting [[Tony Wright (musician)|Tony Wright]]'s band [[Laika Dog]] and [[Cosmic Rough Riders]].

The band's profile was raised immensely by several gigs with friends and contemporaries [[Arctic Monkeys]], including a support slot with the Arctics at the time their "[[I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor]]" reached number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. [[NME]] also took interest, including them under the banner of [[New Yorkshire]].

After releasing two limited singles, "Lipstick Lickin" and "Showroom", on their own label Free Construction, Milburn signed to [[Mercury Records]] in [[2006]]. Their debut single for the label, "Send In the Boys", reached #22 in the UK Singles Chart in April [[2006]], and their debut album, ''Well Well Well'', released on the [[9 October]] [[2006]] on [[Mercury Records]] reached #32 in the UK Albums Chart.

===Second album and 2007 UK Tour===

Milburn released their second album ''[[These Are The Facts]]'' on [[24 September]] [[2007]] whilst releasing the first single from this album "[[What Will You Do (When the Money Goes)?]]" beforehand on [[17 September]]. ''These Are The Facts'' was leaked on to private download website, in its entirety on [[3 September]].

Milburn promoted this new album with a UK tour running from [[13 September]] to [[28 September]] ending with a hugely anticipated home-coming gig at [[The Leadmill]] in [[Sheffield]] on the last night of the tour which sold out in just 3 days. 
This gig had wide-spread rumours attached to it which speculate that [[Matt Helders]], the drummer from fellow [[Sheffield]] favourites [[Arctic Monkeys]] (who joined them on stage during a previous gig at [[The Leadmill]] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/content/articles/2006/07/24/milburn_review_210706.shtml]) would repeat this, and join Milburn once again to play out their home crowd. However, the event never occurred due to Helders touring with his band in America. 

After the success of the 2 week album tour, the band have announced a new tour which will take place in November. The tour will be held at university venues across the country and will finish with a sold out highly anticipated gig at the octagon [[Sheffield]].

On this university tour the gig at Manchester Metropolitan University's K2 was cancelled halfway through after the venue failed to hire a sufficient crowd barrier. This resulted in uncontrollable surges by the crowd, which culminated in a bouncer allegedly attacking a fan and then starting on Louis Carnall.
