'''Australian Christian Churches''' (formerly '''Assemblies of God in Australia''', also known as '''AOG''' and '''ACC''') is the Australian organisation of the [[Assemblies of God]], a [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]] originating in the [[United States of America]]. The denomination was formed in [[1937]] by the merger of two Pentecostal denominations. From April 2007, the denomination adopted a public name of Australian Christian Churches, however is still incorporated as the Assemblies of God in Australia. [[Churches affiliated with Australian Christian Churches|Member churches]] are autonomous but work together to provide support for each other and cooperate in [[evangelism|evangelisation]]. The denomination is lead by [[Brian Houston (pastor)|Brian Houston]], the [[National President of Australian Christian Churches]] and the [[National Executive of Australian Christian Churches|National Executive]].

==History==

Australian [[Pentecostalism]] in the early years was greatly influenced by such figures as Mrs. Janet Lancaster, AC Valdez, [[Smith Wigglesworth]], Charles Greenwood and Philip Duncan but none of these were individually responsible for the formation of the Assemblies of God in Australia. The Assemblies of God in Australia formed out of a conference of the Assemblies of God - [[Queensland]] and the Pentecostal Church of Australia in Sydney, Easter [[1937]]. It was recognised by the leaders of both movements that a more harmonious, co-operative and unified relationship was needed. Charles Greenwood was elected the first Chairman of the Assemblies of God in Australia and every state was granted autonomy in its own affairs as was each registered assembly.

In the early years of the denomination growth was very slow but firm foundations were set in place. In [[1948]] the Commonwealth Bible College (now known as [[Southern Cross College]]) was established in order to train men and women for ministry. Various leaders also arose to bring leadership and direction to the movement such as Henry Wiggins, Philip Duncan, Edward Irish, James Wallace, Alec Davidson and [[Ralph Read]]. [[1977]] was a turning point for growth when Pastor [[Andrew Evans]] became the General Superintendent of the Assemblies of God in Australia. During his term in office from 1977 to [[1997]], the AOG in Australia experienced great growth multiplying by over 13 times in the number of members and adherents and planting over 700 churches. 

In May [[1997]], Pastor Brian Houston was elected the National President of the Assemblies of God in Australia. Houston initiated the launch of Australian Christian Churches, a network of [[Pentecostal]] and [[Charismatic]] churches in [[2000]]. This umbrella organisation became the largest Pentecostal group in Australia, it included the Assemblies of God, the [[Apostolic Church]], Bethesda and the [[Waverley Christian Fellowship]]. In April [[2007]], at the Assemblies of God in Australia National Conference, the public name of the movement was changed to Australian Christian Churches, still incorporated as Assemblies of God in Australia. The denomination currently has over 1,100 churches and 180,000 members across Australia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aog.org.au/AboutUs/WhoWeAre/tabid/108/Default.aspx|title=Who We Are |accessdate=2007-09-04 |author=Australian Christian Churches (Assemblies of God in Australia) |work=Australian Christian Churches (Assemblies of God in Australia) |publisher=Australian Christian Churches (Assemblies of God in Australia)}} </ref>

==Doctrine==

The doctrine of Australian Christian Churches is based on the doctrine of the [[World Assemblies of God Fellowship]]. Australian Christian Churches believe;
* That the [[Bible]] is God's Word. It is accurate, authoritative and applicable to our every day lives.
* In one eternal God who is the Creator of all things. He exists in [[Trinity|three Persons]]: God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. He is totally loving and completely holy.
* That [[sin]] has separated each of us from God and His purpose for our lives.
* That the Lord [[Jesus Christ]] as both God and man is the only One who can reconcile us to God. He lived a sinless and exemplary life, died on the cross in our place, and rose again to prove His victory and empower us for life.
* That in order to receive forgiveness and the '[[Born again Christianity|new birth]]' we must repent of our sins, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and submit to His will for our lives.
* That in order to live the holy and fruitful lives that God intends for us, we need to be [[Baptism|baptised in water]] and be [[Baptism with the Holy Spirit|filled with the power of the Holy Spirit]]. The Holy Spirit enables us to use [[spiritual gift]]s, including [[Glossolalia|speaking in tongues]] which is the initial evidence of baptism in the Holy Spirit.
* That God has individually equipped us so that we can successfully achieve His purpose for our lives which is to [[Christian worship|worship]] God, fulfil our role in the [[Church]] and serve the community in which we live.
* That God wants to heal and transform us so that we can live healthy and prosperous lives in order to help others more effectively.
* That our eternal destination of either [[Heaven]] or [[hell]] is determined by our response to the Lord Jesus Christ.
* That the Lord Jesus Christ is [[Second Coming|coming back]] again as He promised.

In order to train future pastors and leaders in the denomination, Commonwealth Bible College (now known as [[Southern Cross College]]) was established in 1948 as the official ministry training school of Australian Christian Churches. Since the emergence of megachurches, large churches have begun establishing their own bible colleges. At the beginning of the 21st century, it was estimated that there are over 3,000 full-time students being trained at bible colleges affiliated with Australian Christian Churches.<ref>{{cite news |The Bulletin |title=The New Believers |date=2000-04-11 |author=Diana Bagnall |work=[[The Bulletin]] |publisher=[[Australian Consolidated Press]]}} </ref>

==Media attention==
There has been significant attention drawn to the denomination's relationship to the [[Family First Party]], particularly in light of the party's founder, [[Andrew Evans]], being a former superintendent of the movement, and its one-time leader, [[Andrea Mason]], attending an ACC church. Both Australian Christian Churches and the Family First Party maintain that links are historical only, and that there is no organisational connection at the present time. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.familyfirst.org.au/mr/ffptruth250904.pdf |title=Family Fist Party Media Release |accessdate=2007-07-30 |date=2004-09-25 |author=Chris Baker |work=[[Family First Party]] |publisher=[[Family First Party]]}} </ref>

Publicly the Assemblies of God in Australia has distanced itself from advocating certain political groups and parties, including the fledgling Family First party:
:''One thing we are not is a political movement ... The Assemblies of God in Australia does not have a political vision and we don't have a political agenda. I think people need to understand the difference between the church being very involved in politics and individual Christians being involved in politics. There is a big difference.'' (Brian Houston) <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Church-expands-horizons/2005/05/03/1115092503070.html |title=Church expands horizons |accessdate=2006-06-27 |date=2005-05-04 |author=Linda Morris |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=[[John Fairfax Holdings]]}} </ref>

In October 2007, a [[Today Tonight]] story claimed that several of the final remaining [[Australian Idol]] contestants were from [[Hillsong Church]], raising concerns of vote-stacking by the church. It was later revealed that none of the remaining contestants were from Hillsong Church but from churches affiliated with Australian Christian Churches<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.crikey.com.au/Media-Arts-and-Sports/20071010-Australian-Idol-what-about-the-Buddhists.html | title=Australian Idol: Where are the singing Buddhists? | author=Jane Nethercote | source=[[Private Media Pty Ltd, Publishers of Crikey.com.au]] | accessdate=[[2007-10-30]] }}</ref>{{,}}<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,22558938-10229,00.html | title=Idol fans angry at vote bloc | author=Garth Montgomery | source=[[News Limited.]] | accessdate=2007-10-30 }}</ref>, including [[Shirelive Church]].
