{{bilateral|Canada-United States|Canada|USA}}
'''Canada–United States relations''' covers more than two centuries, marked by a shared British colonial heritage, conflict during the early years of the U.S., and the eventual development of one of the most successful international relationships in the modern world. The most serious breach in the relationship was the [[War of 1812]], which saw both sides try to invade the other, and both failed, leaving the status quo.  Friendship was solidified in the 20th century with the shared experience of the [[world wars]] and a close alliance during the [[Cold War]]. 

Canada and the United States are currently the world's largest trading partners, share [[Canada-United States border|the world's longest border]], and have significant interoperability within the defence sphere. Modern difficulties have included repeated trade disputes (despite [[North American Free Trade Agreement|a continental trade agreement]]), environmental concerns, and debates over immigration and the movement of people across the shared border. While the foreign policies of the neighbours have been largely aligned for much of the post-war era, significant disputes have arisen, including over the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Cuba-United States relations|status of Cuba]], the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War on Terror]].

==History==
===As Part Of The British Empire===

At the outset of the [[American Revolution]], the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American revolutionaries]] hoped the [[French Canadians]] in Quebec and the Yankees in [[Nova Scotia]] would join their rebellion and they were pre-approved for joining the United States in the [[Articles of Confederation]]. When [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Canada was invaded]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], most Canadians remained neutral, while some joined the invaders. The American effort was a fiasco and Britain tightened its grip on its northern possessions. In peace negotiations, [[Benjamin Franklin]] unsuccessfully attempted to convince British diplomats to cede Canada to the United States.  The British refused, and used Canada as a refuge for those Loyalists who wanted to leave the U.S. Thomas Jefferson saw the nearby British imperial presence as a threat to [[republicanism in the United States]]. 

The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] which ended the war called for the British to vacate all their forts south of the [[Great Lakes]] border. The British refused to do so, citing failure of the United States to provide financial restitution for Loyalists who had lost property in the war. The [[Jay Treaty]] in 1795 with Great Britain resolved that lingering issue and the British departed the forts. Tensions mounted again after 1805, erupting into the [[War of 1812]], when the Americans declared war on Britain. The Americans were angered by British harassment of U.S. ships on the high seas and seizure ("impressment") of 6,000 American sailors, as well as severe restrictions against neutral American trade with France.  The Americans were outgunned by more than 10-1 by the [[Royal Navy]], and so a land invasion of Canada was proposed as the only feasible means of attacking the British Empire. Americans on the western frontier also hoped an invasion would bring an end to British support of [[American Indians in the United States|American Indian]] resistance to the [[westward expansion of the United States]], typified by [[Tecumseh]]'s coalition of tribes. The early strategy was to temporarily seize Canada as a means of forcing concessions from the British. As in 1775 many Americans hoped the Canadians would welcome the chance to overthrow their British rulers. However, the American invasion attempts were ultimately unsuccessful.  In later years Canadians loyal to the Empire viewed the war as a successful resistance against an outside aggressor.

===As An Independent Nation===

Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties to the British crown. Strained relations with the United States continued, however, due to a series of armed incursions named the [[Fenian raids]] by [[Irish-American]] [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veterans across the border from 1866 to 1871 in an attempt to overthrow British interests in North America. While officially the American government did not openly endorse the raids, and did eventually move to disarm the Fenians, the raids created lasting anger in Canada.  Many Canadians believed that [[President Andrew Johnson]] initially supported the raids, and that the American government turned a blind eye to these armed incursions for far too long.

[[Image:CanadianAmericaRelationsCartoon1886.gif|right|thumb|An editorial cartoon on Canada-United States relations, 1886]]

A [[Oregon boundary dispute|boundary dispute]] in the [[Oregon Country]] (''Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!'') was the most serious disturbance, but was peacefully resolved. In the 1930s, the United States studied plans to invade Canada in [[War Plan Red]], albeit as an academic exercise. Canadian defence was organized against an American invasion until the onset of [[World War II]].

Following co-operation in the two World Wars, Canada and the United States lost much of their previous animosity. As Britain's influence as a global superpower declined, Canada and the United States became extremely close partners. Canada was a close ally of the United States during the [[Cold War]].

In World War II the U.S. built large military bases in Newfoundland (then a British colony), and the business community there sought closer ties with the U.S. as expressed by the [[Economic Union Party]]. Ottawa took notice and wanted Newfoundland to join Canada, which it did after hotly contested referendums. There was little demand in the U.S. for the acquisition of Newfoundland, so the U.S. did not protest the British decision not to allow an American option on the [[Newfoundland referendums, 1948|Newfoundland referendum]].

The Canadian military, like forces of many other Western countries, fought along side the U.S. in most major conflicts with UN-involvement since World War II, including the [[Korean War]], the [[Gulf War]], the [[Kosovo War]], and most recently, the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]. The main exceptions to this were the Canadian government's opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Iraq War]], which caused some brief diplomatic tensions. Despite these issues, military relations have remained close.

==Defence and international conflict==
[[Image:NORADCommandCenter.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[North American Aerospace Defense Command|North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)]], long headquartered in the [[Cheyenne Mountain|Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center]] in Colorado, exemplifies military co-operation between Canada and the U.S.]]
U.S. defence arrangements with Canada are more extensive than with any other country. The [[Permanent Joint Board of Defense]], established in 1940, provides policy-level consultation on bilateral defence matters. The United States and Canada share [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) mutual security commitments. In addition, U.S. and Canadian military forces have cooperated since 1958 on continental air defence within the framework of the North American Aerospace Defense Command ([[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]]).
There is also an active military exchange program between the two countries under which [[Canadian Forces]] personnel have been involved in Iraq. Moreover, interoperability with the American armed forces has been a guiding principle of Canadian military force structuring and doctrine since the end of the Cold War. Canadian navy frigates, for instance, integrate seamlessly into U.S. carrier battle groups.

===War in Afghanistan===
{{main|Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan}}
Canada's JTF2 unit joined American special forces in Afghanistan shortly after the Al-Qaeda attacks on [[September 11]], [[2001]]. Canadian forces joined the multinational coalition in [[Operation Anaconda]] in January 2002. On [[April 18]], [[2002]], an American pilot attacked Canadian forces involved in a training exercise, killing four and wounding eight Canadians. A joint US-Canadian inquiry determined the cause of the incident to be pilot error, in which the pilot interpreted ground fire as an attack; the pilot ignored orders that he felt were "second-guessing" his field tactical decision.<ref name="friendly fire cbc">{{cite web

The Canadian [[Embassy]] in [[Washington, DC]] maintains a [[public relations]] [[web site]] named [http://www.canadianally.com CanadianAlly.com], which is intended "to give American citizens a better sense of the scope of Canada's role in North American and Global Security and the War on Terror."

The [[New Democratic Party]] and some recent Liberal leadership candidates have expressed opposition to Canada's expanded role in the Afghan conflict on the ground that it is inconsistent with Canada's historic role (since the [[Second World War]]) of peacekeeping operations.

===2003 Invasion of Iraq===
{{See also|Canada and the Iraq War}}

According to contemporary polls, the vast majority of Canadians were opposed to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. The Canadian government, under Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]], maintained a position with emphasis on [[United Nations|UN]] authority. Many Canadians, and the former Liberal government of [[Paul Martin]] (as well as many Americans such as [[Bill Clinton]]<ref name="clinton canada">{{cite web
|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20061120.BCSPECTOR20%2FTPStory%2FspecialComment%2Fcolumnists&ord=1170048528746&brand=theglobeandmail

==Trade==
'''[[Canada]]''' and the United States have the world's largest trading relationship, with huge quantities of goods and people flowing across the border each year. Since the 1987 [[Canadian-American Free Trade Agreement]] there have been no [[tariff]]s on most goods passed between the two countries.

With such a massive trading relationship, trade disputes between the two countries are frequent and inevitable. American officials have placed ongoing tariffs on Canadian [[US - Canada softwood lumber dispute|softwood lumber]] despite losing various appeals placed by Canada in the NAFTA and WTO panels. The softwood lumber dispute remains a growing issue between the two countries and is degrading the trade relationship on both sides of the border. Other notable disputes include the [[Canadian Wheat Board]], and Canadian cultural "restrictions" on magazines and television (See [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and [[National Film Board of Canada]]). Canadians have criticized about such things as the ban on [[beef]] since a case of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|Mad Cow]] disease was discovered in 2003 with cows from United States of America (and a few subsequent cases) and the high American agricultural subsidies. Concerns in Canada also run high over aspects of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) such as Chapter 11.

One ongoing and complex trade issue involves the importation of cheaper [[prescription drugs]] from Canada to the United States. Due to the Canadian government's [[price controls]] as part of their state-run medical system, prices for prescription drugs can be a fraction of the price paid by consumers in the unregulated U.S. market. While laws in the United States have been passed at the national level against such sales, specific state and local governments have passed their own legislation to allow the trade to continue. American drug companies--often supporters of political campaigns--have obviously come out against the practice.

According to a 2003 study commissioned by the Canadian Embassy in the United States, based on 2001 data, Canada-U.S. [[trade]] supported 5.2 million U.S. jobs.

==Arctic disputes==
A long-simmering dispute between Canada and the U.S. involves the issue of Canadian sovereignty over the [[Northwest Passage]] (the sea passages in the Arctic). Canada’s assertion that the Northwest Passage represents internal (territorial) waters has been challenged by other countries, especially the U.S., which argue that these waters constitute an international strait (international waters). Canadians were incensed when Americans drove the reinforced oil tanker ''[[Manhattan (ship)|Manhattan]]'' through the Northwest Passage in 1969, followed by the icebreaker [[Polar Sea]] in 1985, both without asking for Canadian permission.  In 1970, the Canadian government enacted the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, which asserts Canadian regulatory control over pollution within a 100-mile zone.  In response, the United States in 1970 stated, “We cannot accept the assertion of a Canadian claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada…. Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide.” A compromise of sorts was reached in 1988, by an agreement on “Arctic Cooperation,” which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers “will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada.”  However the agreement did not alter either country’s basic legal position.  In January 2006 David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Canada, said his government opposes Stephen Harper's proposed plan to deploy military icebreakers in the Arctic to detect interlopers and assert Canadian sovereignty over those waters.<ref>Matthew Carnaghan, Allison Goody, [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/prb0561-e.htm "Canadian Arctic Sovereignty"] (Library of Parliament: Political and Social Affairs Division, 26 January 2006); [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/01/26/wilkins-harper060126.html 2006 news]</ref>  In August 2007, former US ambassador to Canada, [[Paul Cellucci]], stated that in 2005 he informed his government that it should reevaluate its assertion that the Northwest Passage is an international sea body, and should belong to Canada. His advice was rejected and in 2007 Bush and Harper took opposite positions.<ref>http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070817/qp_cellucci_070819/20070819?hub=Politics</ref>

==Environmental issues==
The two countries work closely to resolve transborder environmental issues, an area of increasing importance in the bilateral relationship. A principal instrument of this cooperation is the [[International Joint Commission]] (IJC), established as part of the [[Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909]] to resolve differences and promote international cooperation on boundary waters. The [[Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1972]] is another historic example of joint cooperation in controlling transborder water pollution. However, there have been some disputes. Most recently, the [[Devil's Lake (North Dakota)|Devil's Lake]] Outlet, a project instituted by North Dakota, has angered Manitobans who fear that their water may soon become polluted as a result of this project. 
The two governments also consult semi-annually on transborder air pollution. Under the [[Air Quality Agreement of 1991]], both countries have made substantial progress in coordinating and implementing their acid rain control programs and signed an annex on ground level ozone in 2000. Despite this transborder air pollution remains an issue, particularly in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence watershed during the summer. The main source of this transborder pollution results from coal fired power stations, most of them located in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest US]]. 

There is also concern over sewage disposal in British Columbia, as current legislation allows the province to dispose of its sewage in the Pacific Ocean.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Currently neither of the countries governments support the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which set out time scheduled curbing of greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike the United States, Canada has ratified the agreement. Yet after ratification, due to internal political conflict within Canada, the Canadian government does not enforce the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and has received criticism from environmental groups and from other governments for its climate change positions.[http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/national/article.jsp?article=2006_11_16_1163698971]

==Illicit drugs== 
In 2003 the American government became concerned when members of the Canadian government announced plans to [[decriminalization|decriminalize]] [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. David Murray, an assistant to U.S. [[Director of the National Drug Control Policy|Drug Czar]] [[John P. Walters]], said in a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] interview that, "We would have to respond. We would be forced to respond." <ref>http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2003/05/02/us_pot_rxn030502.html</ref>. However the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|election]] of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] in early 2006 has halted the liberalization of marijuana laws for the foreseeable future. The Canadian government currently grows marijuana for [[Medical cannabis|medicinal purposes]] only in former mines.

==Arar affair==
{{main|Maher Arar}}
On [[September 26]], [[2002]], U.S. officials, acting upon a tip from Canadian law enforcement, detained [[Maher Arar]] on suspicion of terrorist links.  Arar is a dual citizen of Canada and Syria and was travelling through New York as part of a trip from [[Tunisia]] to Canada.

Despite travelling on a Canadian passport, Arar was deported to Syria, his country of birth. He was imprisoned there for over a year and tortured repeatedly. The decision by U.S. officials to deport him to Syria, his imprisonment and torture there, and the extent of collaboration between U.S. and Canadian officials became a major political issue in Canada at the time.

Canadian officials have since said that Arar was not linked in any way to terrorism, and the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, has issued a formal apology to Arar, who nonetheless remains on an American terrorist watchlist.

==The current state of relations==
{{update}}

Shortly after being congratulated by U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] for his victory in February of 2006, Prime Minister of Canada, [[Stephen Harper]] rebuked U.S. Ambassador to Canada [[David Wilkins]] for criticizing the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives']] plans to assert Canada's sovereignty over the [[Arctic Ocean]] waters with armed forces. Harper's first meeting with the U.S. President occurred at the end of March, 2006; and while little was achieved in the way of solid agreements, the trip was described in the media as signalling a trend of closer relations between the two nations.
