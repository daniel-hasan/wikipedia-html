'''''The Portland Mercury''''' is an [[alternative weekly]] newspaper published in [[Portland, Oregon]].  It serves to chronicle the ever-changing Portland music scene, and generally includes interviews, commentaries, reviews, and concert dates.  Popular features include the "I, Anonymous" section, in which local readers are encouraged to submit anonymous, usually impassioned, and often incendiary letters to the city at large and [[Dan Savage]]'s syndicated advice column [[Savage Love]].  The Mercury is similar in style to its sibling publication, [[Seattle, Washington]]'s [[The Stranger (newspaper)|''The Stranger'']].
