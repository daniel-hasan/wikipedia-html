'''Charles Polk, Jr.''' ([[November 14]] [[1788]] &ndash; [[October 27]] [[1857]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[farmer]] and [[politician]] from Big Stone Beach, in Milford Hundred, [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]], [[Delaware]]. He was a member of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]], and later the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], who served in the [[Delaware General Assembly]] and twice as [[Governor of Delaware]]. 

==Early life and family==
Polk was born [[November 14]] [[1788]] near [[Bridgeville, Delaware|Bridgeville]], [[Delaware]], son of Charles and Mary Manlove Polk. The Polk family originally came from [[Scotland]] and [[U.S. President]] [[James K. Polk]] was a distant cousin. Robert Polk settled in [[Somerset County, Maryland|Somerset County]], [[Maryland]] in 1660 and the [[Delaware]] family descended from him. Charles Polk, Sr. was a veteran of the [[American Revolution]], having served in Colonel [[David Hall]]'s regiment in 1777. He was a large landowner in the [[Bridgeville, Delaware|Bridgeville]] area, served eight years in the [[Delaware House of Representatives|State House]], and was a member of the [[Delaware]] Constitutional Convention of 1792.

After his father's death in 1795, Charles, Jr. attended Westtown Boarding School in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]], [[Pennsylvania]] and then studied [[Law]] with [[Kensey Johns (jurist)|Kensey Johns, Sr.]], but never practiced. By 1812 he was the owner of the ''Knife and Fork'' Tavern near [[Bridgeville, Delaware|Bridgeville]]. He married Mary Elizabeth Purnell and they had nine children, including, Charles, William Alexander, and Theodore. In 1816 Polk purchased a large tract of land at Big Stone Beach, near Milford, in what is now Milford Hundred, in [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]], [[Delaware]]. He established his residence there on [[Delaware Bay]]. They were members of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian Church]].

==Political career==
Polk was a member of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]], which was the majority party in [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]] and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]], but was nearly matched in popularity statewide by the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]] because of that party's strength in [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]]. As a result statewide elections were usually close and hard fought. [[Delaware]] was the last state in the country to have an effective [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]], it having virtually disappeared everywhere else. By 1827 members of the old Jeffersonian [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]] had split into a [[Andrew Jackson|Jacksonian]], or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] faction or an [[John Quincy Adams|Adams]]/[[Henry Clay|Clay]] faction, known initially as the [[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republicans]], and later as [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]]. The remaining [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]], which were many in [[Delaware]], did likewise.

Polk, and most of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] in [[Delaware]], joined the [[John Quincy Adams|Adams]]/[[Henry Clay|Clay]] faction, and began a [[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republican]], then [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] ascendancy in [[Delaware]] politics. Like the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]], the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] were especially strong in [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]] and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]], but were nearly matched by the new [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] majority in [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]]. The upstate /downstate competition continued as before, just under new names.

Polk first represented [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]], and served two terms in the [[Delaware House of Representatives|State House]] in the 1814 and 1815 sessions. After moving to [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]] he was elected to the [[Delaware House of Representatives|State House]] again, this time from [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]]. He served two more terms in the 1818 and 1824 sessions. Polk was also elected to the [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]] Levy Court in 1819. In 1824 he was elected to the [[Delaware Senate|State Senate]] and served one term including the 1825, 1826 and 1827 sessions. He was the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] in the 1826 session. 

==Governor of Delaware==
In 1826, the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] selected Polk as their candidate for [[Governor of Delaware|Governor]], and after a hard fought campaign, he was elected, narrowly defeating the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican]] candidate, [[David Hazzard]]. He served one term as [[Governor of Delaware]] from [[January 16]] [[1827]] to [[January 19]] [[1830]]. 

Legislation was passed in 1829 that called for the creation of school districts in each [[hundred (division) #United States|hundred]] throughout the state, with small schools placed within two miles of every student. This was an ambitious and creative plan to improve secondary education developed and promoted by [[Willard Hall]], now the [[United States District Judge]] for [[Delaware]]. There was some state funding, but the expectation was the localities would supplement it. Many did not.

During Polk's term declining agricultural yields due to worn out soil were a matter of great concern. To address the concern, the [[Delaware General Assembly]] hired an expert from the Franklin Institute in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], who provided a good deal of helpful advice on the use of fertilizers. As it happened, the construction of the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] was beginning, and some farmers in [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] realized the marl obtained from the dredging would enrich their soil. Using this soil, the first peach trees were planted near [[Delaware City, Delaware|Delaware City]].

Regrettably, many thought the problem lay elsewhere. No doubt, reflecting this thinking Polk, as [[Governor of Delaware|Governor]] in 1837, blamed the problem on inadequate labor, saying the problem lay with "the wretched condition of the colored population which infests the state...irresponsible, lawless, and miserable...a migratory tribe without fixed abode, alternatively roving from city to country." He and others were concerned about the large number of free [[African-Americans]] and rather than addressing the issue directly, sought to restrict their entry into [[Delaware]]. <ref>{{cite book |title= Democracy in Delaware |last= Hoffecker |first= Carol E |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others |origyear= 2006 |publisher= Cedar Tree Books |location= Wilmington, Delaware |id= |pages= p.92 |chapter= |quote =Journal of the House of Representatives (1837), p. 10 }}</ref>

==Constitution of 1831==
A new State Constitution was adopted in 1831. Polk was the President of the convention that adopted it, but the real leader of the conclave was Polk’s former [[Delaware]] [[Secretary of State]] and good personal friend, [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John M. Clayton]]. This document provided for elections in November, biannual sessions of the [[Delaware General Assembly]], four year terms for [[Governor of Delaware|Governors]] and [[Delaware Senate|State Senators]], and two year terms for [[Delaware House of Representatives|State Representatives]]. [[Governor of Delaware|Governors]] were not allowed to succeed themselves. The judicial system was changed as well, reducing the number of judges from nine to five: a Chancellor, a Chief Justice, and three associate justices.

==Later career==
After his initial term as [[Governor of Delaware|Governor]], Polk was again elected to the [[Delaware Senate|State Senate]] in 1834, and served in the 1835/36 session as [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]]. As the governor’s constitutional successor, he became [[Governor of Delaware|Governor]] again upon the death of [[Governor of Delaware|Governor]] [[Caleb P. Bennett]] and served the remaining months of Bennett's term from [[July 11]] [[1836]] until [[January 17]] [[1837]]. Polk then returned to his seat in the [[Delaware Senate|State Senate]], served in the 1837/38 session, and was reelected for the 1839/40 and 1841/42 sessions. He was once again [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] in the 1841/42 session. 

Polk served as Register of Wills for [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]] from 1843 until 1848, and in 1850, moved to [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], when [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John Tyler]] brought him out of retirement to spend three years as the Collector for the Port of [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]. Finally, he was appointed Commissioner-Judge of the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] in August 1857.

==Death and legacy== 
Polk died [[October 27]] [[1857]] at his home at Big Stone Beach, in Milford Hundred, [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]], [[Delaware]], and is buried at the Old Presbyterian Cemetery, which is now on the grounds of the Delaware State Museum in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]], [[Delaware]]. His son, William A. Polk served as the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Delaware House of Representatives|State House]] in the 1867/68 session.

==Almanac==
Elections were held the first Tuesday of October. Members of the [[Delaware General Assembly]] took office the first Tuesday of January. [[Delaware Senate|State Senators]] had a three year term and [[Delaware House of Representatives|State Representatives]] had a one year term. The [[Governor of Delaware|Governor]] takes office the third Tuesday of January and had a three year term. 

After 1831, elections were held the first Tuesday after November 1st. In addition, the terms of [[Delaware Senate|State Senators]] were increased to four years, the terms of [[Delaware House of Representatives|State Representatives]] were increased to two years, and the term of the [[Governor of Delaware|Governor]] was increased to four years.
