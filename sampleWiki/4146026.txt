'''Allama Mashriqi''' ([[Urdu]]: '''علامہ مشرقی''') ('''Inayatullah Khan''') ([[Urdu]]: '''عنایت اللہ خان''') (born in [[Amritsar]], [[25 August]], [[1888]]; died in [[Lahore]], [[27 August]], [[1963]]) was an [[Islam]]ic scholar and founder of the [[Khaksars|Khaksar movement]].

Mashriqi was a noted intellectual who became a college Principal at the age of 25, and then became an Under Secretary, at the age of 29, in the Education Department of the Government of India. He wrote an [[exegesis]] of the [[Qur'an]] which was nominated for the 1925 [[Nobel Prize]]. He was offered an [[Ambassadorship]] to [[Afghanistan]] at age 32 and [[Knighthood]] at the age of 33 years, but he declined all [[honours]].

He subsequently resigned government service and in 1930 founded the [[Khaksars|Khaksar Movement]], aiming to advance the condition of the masses irrespective of any [[faith]], [[sect]], or [[religion]].<ref name="shabbir2">S. Shabbir Hussain, Al-Mashriqi: The Disowned Genius, Lahore, [[Jang Group of Newspapers|Jang Publishers]], 1991</ref> As its leader, he was imprisoned several times. Through his philosophical writings, he asserted that the [[Science of Religions]] was essentially the science of collective evolution of mankind.

== Family background ==

Mashriqi was born into an eminent [[Muslim Rajput]] family in [[Amritsar]] on [[25 August]], [[1888]]. His father, Khan Ata Mohammad Khan, had inherited a large property from his father. His ancestors had held prominent positions during the [[Mughal Empire]]. Khan Ata was also well-connected with the [[Muslim]] luminaries of the time such as [[Syed Ahmed Khan|Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]], [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani|Jamal Ud Din Afgahani]], [[Shibli Nomani]], and [[Mirza Ghalib]].<ref>Nasim Yousaf, Pakistan's Birth & Allama Mashraqi: Chronology & Statements, Period 1947-1963 --ISBN 0-9760333-4-8</ref>

Khan Ata owned a [[Biweekly|bi-weekly]] publication, ''Vakil'' ("Lawyer"), published from Amritsar. ''Vakil'' discussed political issues with a Muslim focus. [[Shibli Nomani]] requested that Khan Ata let [[Abul Kalam Azad]] work at ''Vakil''. Azad went on to work as an editor of ''Vakil''. Mashriqi was thus raised in an intellectual Muslim environment.<ref>Al-Mashriqi Author Rasheed Nisar</ref> Khan Ata Mohammad Khan noticed the genius in his son and he guided him accordingly.

== Education ==

Mashriqi had a passion for mathematics from his childhood.<ref name="shabbir2" /> He completed his Master's degree in Mathematics from the [[University of the Punjab]] at the age of 19 and broke all previous records. In October 1907 he went to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and matriculated at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], to read for the mathematics [[tripos]]. He was awarded a college foundation scholarship in May 1908.<ref>''The Times'', 23 June 1908, page 12.</ref> In June 1909 he was awarded [[British undergraduate degree classification|first class honours]] in Mathematics Part I, being placed joint 27th out of 31 on the list of [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wranglers]].<ref>''The Times'', 16 June 1909, page 9.</ref> For the next two years, he read for the [[Languages of Asia|oriental languages]] tripos in parallel to the natural sciences tripos, gaining first class honours in the former and third class in the latter.<ref>''The Times'',17 June 1911, page 6.</ref><ref> M. Aslam Malik,''Allama Inayatullah Mashraqi'', page 3.</ref>

After three years' residence at [[Cambridge]] he had qualified for his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, which he took in 1910. In 1912 he completed a fourth tripos in mechanical sciences, and was placed in the second class.<ref>''The Times'', 13 June 1912, page 7</ref> He left Cambridge and returned to India in December 1912.<ref>M. Aslam Malik,''Allama Inayatullah Mashraqi'', page 4.</ref>. During his stay in Cambridge his religious and scientific conviction was inspired by the works and concepts of the professor [[Sir James Jeans]].<ref name="shabbir">S. Shabbir Hussain (ed.), God, Man, and Universe, Akhuwat Publications, Rawalpindi, 1980</ref>

== Career ==

On his return to India, Mashriqi was offered the premiership of [[Alwar]], a [[Princely states|princely state]], by the Raja. He declined owing to his interest in education. At the age of 25 he was appointed Vice Principal of [[Islamia College]], [[Peshawar]], by Chief Commissioner [[Sir George Roos-Keppel]]. He was made Principal of the same college in 1917.<ref name="nasim">Nasim Yousaf.''Pakistan's Freedom and Allama Mashriqi: Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi's Birth to 1947'' ISBN 0-9760333-4-8 (2004), p. 47</ref> In Oct 1917 he was appointed Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Education Department in succession to Sir George Anderson (1876-1943).<ref>Hira Lal Seth, ''The Khaksar Movement Under Search Light And the Life Story of Its Leader Allama Mashriqi'' (Hero Publications, 1946), p 16</ref> He became headmaster of the High School, Peshawar on [[21 October]] [[1919]].

Aged 32, he was offered an ambassadorship to [[Afghanistan]], which he decline. The following year, he was offered a British [[knighthood]], which he also turned down.<ref>Nasim Yousaf.''Pakistan's Freedom and Allama Mashriqi: Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi's Birth to 1947'' ISBN 0-9760333-4-8 (2004), pp.48</ref> Mashriqi was among the youngest Indians to have been offered such positions.

In 1930 he was passed over for a promotion in the government service, following which he went on medical leave. In 1932 he resigned, taking his pension, and settled down in [[Ichhra]], [[Lahore]].<ref>Shan Muhammed, Khaksar Movement in India, Pub. Meenakshi Prakashan, Meerut, 1973</ref>

=== Nobel nomination ===

In [[1924]], at the age of 36, Mashriqi completed the first volume of his book, ''Tazkirah''. It is a commentary on the [[Qur'an]] in the light of science. It was nominated by the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize Committee]] in [[1925]],<ref>M.Aslam Malik,''Allama Inayatullah Mashraqi''</ref> subject to the condition it was translated into one of the [[European languages]].<ref name="nasim" /> Mashriqi, however, declined the suggestion of translation.<ref>[http://www.paktribune.com/news/print.php?id=149500 Allama Mashriqi - a great genius], Pak Tribune, 11 July 2006. (accessed on 30 November 2006)</ref>

=== Fellowships ===

Mashriqi's fellowships included:<ref name="shabbir">S. Shabbir Hussain (ed.), God, Man, and Universe, Akhuwat Publications, Rawalpindi, 1980</ref>:

* Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]], 1923
* Fellow of the Geographical Society (F.G.S), [[Paris]]
* Fellow of Society of Arts (F.S.A), [[Paris]]

* President of the All World's Faiths Conference, 1937

== Mashriqi's philosophy ==

Mashriqi was interested in the conflict within various religions. Instead of getting disgusted with the conflict and discarding [[Religion]], he tried to fathom the fallacy. To him, [[Prophet|messengers]] from the same [[Creator deity|Creator]] could not have brought different and conflicting messages to the same creation. He could not conceive of a contradictory and conflicting state of affairs in the [[Universe]], nor could he accept the conflict within various religions as real. Either Religion was a fraud and the [[prophet]]s were impostors who misguided and disrupted mankind, or they were misprojected by their followers and misunderstood by the [[mankind]].

He delved into the religious [[scriptures]] and arrived at the conclusion that all the prophets had brought the same message to man. He analysed the fundamentals of the Message and established that the teachings of all the prophets were closely linked with [[evolution]] of mankind as a single and united [[species]] in contrast to other ignorant and stagnant species of animals.

It was on this basis that he declared that the [[Science of Religions]] was essentially the science of collective evolution of mankind; all prophets came to unite mankind, not to disrupt it; the basic law of all faiths is the law of [[unification]] and [[consolidation]] of the entire humanity.<ref name="shabbir">S. Shabbir Hussain (ed.), God, Man, and Universe, Akhuwat Publications, Rawalpindi, 1980</ref> According to Markus Daeschel, the philosophical ruminations of Mashriqi offer an opportunity to re-evaluate the meaning of colonial modernity and notion of post-colonial [[nation-building]] in modern times.<ref>Markus Daeschel, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=500148 Scientism and its discontents: The Indo-Muslim "Fascism" of Inayatullah Khan Al-Mashriqi], ''Modern Intellectual History'', 3: pp. 443-472, [[Cambridge University Press]]. 2006</ref>

== Political life ==

Mashriqi is often portrayed as a controversial figure, a religious activist, a [[revolutionary]], and an [[anarchist]]; while at the same time he is described as a [[visionary]], a [[reformer]], a [[leader]], and a scientist-philosopher who was born ahead of his time.<ref name="shabbir2" />

=== Mashriqi and the Freedom of British India ===

[[Image:Mashriqi with Khaksars.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Allama Mashriqi (fourth from right)]]
After Mashriqi resigned from government service, he laid the foundation of the [[Khaksars|Khaksar Tehreek]] (also known as Khaksar Movement) in 1930.<ref>Khaksar Tehrik Ki Jiddo Juhad Volume 1. Author Khaksar Sher Zaman</ref> He played a role in directing the Muslims towards the independence of British India. Mashriqi was repeatedly imprisoned, along with his family, and a large number of Khaksars.<ref>Angrez Sir Sikandar aur Khaksar Tehreek (in [[Urdu]]): Author Muhammad Ali Faraq</ref>

=== Imprisonments and allegations ===

Mashriqi was first imprisoned in 1939, by the Congress Government of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]] (now [[Uttar Pradesh]]) during his efforts in resolving the sectarian conflicts between [[Sunnis]] and [[Shias]]. In 1940, he was arrested during a clash between the police and the [[Khaksars]]. The newspapers reported it as the "battle of spades and guns". He was only freed from [[solitary confinement]] in 1942 after he fasted for 80 days.

On [[20 July]], [[1943]], an assassination attempt was made on [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] by Rafiq Sabir who was assumed to be a Khaksar worker<ref>Jinnah of Pakistan, [http://www.humsafar.info/1943.htm Calendar of events, 1943]. Accessed on [[2 March]], [[2007]]</ref> The  attack was deplored by Mashriqi, who denied any involvement. Later, Justice Blagden of [[Bombay High Court]], in his ruling on [[4 November]] [[1943]] dismissed any association of Khaksars.<ref>Akbar A. Peerbhoy, Jinnah Faces An Assassin, Bombay: Thacker & Co., 1943</ref>

In [[Pakistan]], Mashriqi was imprisoned at least five times: in 1950 prior to election; in 1958 for alleged complicity in the murder of republican leader [[Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan]]; and, in 1962 for suspicion on attempt to overthrow [[Ayub Khan|President Ayub's]] government. However, none of the charges were proved, and he was acquitted in each case.<ref name="shabbir">S. Shabbir Hussain (ed.), God, Man, and Universe, Akhuwat Publications, Rawalpindi, 1980</ref>

In 1957 Mashriqi allegedly led 300,000 of his followers to the borders of [[Kashmir]], intending, it is said, to launch a fight for its liberation. However, the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistan government]] persuaded the group to withdraw and the organisation was later disbanded.<ref>Obituary, ''The Times'', 29 August 1963</ref>

== Death ==

Mashriqi became ill with cancer of the rectum <ref> The Civil and Military Gazette, Lahore Pakistan, 10 August 1963</ref> and died on [[August 27]], [[1963]] in [[Lahore]] ([[Pakistan]]). Well over 100,000 people attended his funeral.<ref>Al-Mashraqi, Author: Dr. Muhammad Azmatullah Bhatti</ref> Condolences were received from, among others, [[Ayub Khan]] and [[Khwaja Nazimuddin]]. Ayub Khan wrote that Mashriqi was “a great scholar and organiser who had given up a brilliant academic future to serve the people, as he thought right.”<ref name="pt1">''[[Pakistan Times]]'', 29 August 1963.</ref>

Nazimuddin wrote that Mashriqi had been “a very interesting figure who took prominent part in the politics of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent”.<ref name="pt1" />
