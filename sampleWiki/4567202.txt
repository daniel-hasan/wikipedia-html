The '''LVT-5''' ('''Landing Vehicle, Tracked''') was a family of [[amphibious vehicle|amphibious]] armoured fighting vehicles used by the [[United States Marine Corps]]. It was first accepted into service in 1956, and saw action in the [[Vietnam War]]. 1,124 units were produced.

It was an evolution of the [[Landing Vehicle Tracked]] series, and was replaced in service by the [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle|LVT-7]] family.

The most common was the '''LVTP-5''', an armoured personnel carrier, with mine-sweeper, command, recovery and fire support variants, the latter mounting a 105 mm howitzer. An anti-aircraft version was prototyped, but never saw service.
