[[Image:Yukonwikimap.PNG|thumb|350px|right|A [[map]] of [[Yukon]]]]
The '''[[Yukon]] Territory''' is in the northwestern corner of [[Canada]]. The sparsely populated territory abounds with natural scenic beauty, with snowmelt lakes and perennial whitecapped mountains, including many of Canada's highest mountains. Although the [[climate]] is [[Arctic climate|arctic]] and [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] and very dry, with long cold winters, the long sunshine hours in the short summer allow a profusion of flowers and fruit to blossom. Most of the territory is [[boreal forest]], [[tundra]] being the main vegetation zone only in the extreme north and at high elevations. The world's largest non-polar [[icefield]], the [[Kluane icefield]]s is mostly in the Yukon.

The territory is about the shape of a right triangle, bordering the [[United States|American]] state of [[Alaska]] to the west, the [[Northwest Territories]] to the east and [[British Columbia]] to the south. The Yukon covers [[1 E11 m²|482,443]] [[square meter|square kilometres]], of which 474,391 km² is land and 8,052 km² is water. 

It is bounded on the south by the 60th parallel of [[latitude]]. Its northern coast is on the [[Beaufort Sea]]. Its western boundary is 141 degrees west [[longitude]].  Its ragged eastern boundary mostly follows the [[water divide|divide]] between the [[Yukon River]] Basin and the [[Mackenzie River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] to the east in the [[Mackenzie mountains]]. All of the Yukon is west of [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] and contains Canada's westernmost communities.

==Physical Geography==
Except for the coastal plain on the [[Beaufort Sea]] ([[Arctic Ocean]]) coast, most of the Yukon is part of the [[American cordillera]]. The terrain includes [[mountain range]]s, [[plateau]]s and [[river]] [[valley]]s. 

The southwest is dominated by the [[Kluane icefield]]s in [[Kluane National Park and Reserve]], the largest non-polar [[icefield]]s in the world. Kluane National Park also contains eight of Canada's ten highest mountains, including the five highest, all in the [[Saint Elias Mountains]]. A number of glaciers flow out of the icefields, including the [[Logan Glacier]], the [[Hubbard Glacier]] and the [[Kaskawulsh Glacier]].

[[Permafrost]] is common. The northern part of the territory has continuous permafrost, while it is widespread in the central part. Even the southern Yukon has scattered patches of permafrost.

Two major [[Geologic fault|faults]], the [[Denali fault]] and the Tintina fault have created major valleys called [[Oceanic trench|trenches]]: the Shakwak trench and the Tintina trench. The Shakwak trench separates the Kluane ranges from other mountain ranges north of it. The [[Haines Highway]] and the [[Alaska Highway]] north of [[Haines Junction, Yukon|Haines Junction]] are built in the Shakwak trench. The Tintina trench bisects the Yukon from northwest to southeast and its edges have rich mineral deposits including the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] [[gold]] and the [[lead]]-[[zinc]] deposits near [[Faro, Yukon|Faro]].

===Volcanoes===
The [[volcano]]es in the Yukon are part of the circle of volcanoes around the [[Pacific Ocean]] known as the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. The Yukon includes more than 100 separate volcanic centers that have been active during the [[Quaternary]]. The [[Fort Selkirk Volcanic Field]] in central Yukon is the northernmost [[Holocene]] [[volcanic field]] in Canada, including the young [[active volcano|active]] [[cinder cone]], [[Volcano Mountain]]. A [[volcanic field]] in southcentral Yukon is called [[Alligator Lake]]. It contains two well-preserved cinder cones that caps a small [[shield volcano]]. Lava from the cones traveled north and were erupted at the same time. Volcanoes in southwestern Yukon are part of the [[Wrangell Volcanic Field]], which is related to the [[subduction]] of the [[Pacific Plate]] beneath the [[North American Plate]] at the easternmost end of the [[Aleutian Trench]].

Yukon volcanoes include:

*[[Volcano Mountain]]
*[[Alligator Lake]]
*[[Fort Selkirk Volcanic Field]]
*[[Pelly Formation]]
*[[Bennett Lake Caldera]]
*[[Sifton Range volcanic complex]]
*[[Rabbit Mountain]]
*[[Felsite Peak]]
*[[Ibex Mountain]]
*[[Mount McNeil]]
*[[Miles Canyon Basalts]]
*[[Ne Ch'e Ddhawa]]
*[[Skukum Group]]
*[[Upper Becker Creek Cone]]

===Mountain Ranges===
The Saint Elias mountains are part of the [[Coast Mountains]] which range from southern British Columbia to Alaska and cover the southeastern Yukon. While the Saint Elias Mountains contain the highest mountains, there are numerous other mountain ranges, from the [[British Mountains]] in the far north, which are part of the [[Brooks Range]], to the [[Mackenzie Mountains]] and the [[Richardson Mountains]] in the east, the [[Cassiar Mountains]] in the south-east, the [[Pelly Mountains]] in the central Yukon, and the [[Ogilvie Mountains]] north 
of [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]] and along himalayas the [[Dempster Highway]]. 

Yukon mountain ranges include:
*[[Brooks Range]] (mostly in northern [[Alaska]])

==Hydrography==
See also: [[List of Yukon lakes]] and [[List of Yukon rivers]]

Most of the territory is in the [[drainage basin|watershed]] of its namesake, the [[Yukon River]], which flows into the [[Bering Sea]]. The southern Yukon is dotted with a large number of large, long and narrow glacier-fed alpine [[lake]]s, most of which flow into the Yukon River system. The larger lakes include: [[Teslin Lake]], [[Atlin Lake]], [[Tagish Lake]], [[Marsh Lake]], [[Lake Laberge]], [[Kusawa Lake]], [[Kluane Lake]]. [[Lake Bennett (Canada)|Lake Bennett]] on the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] trail is a smaller lake flowing into Tagish Lake.

Other rivers flow either directly into the [[Pacific Ocean]] or directly or indirectly into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The [[Alsek River|Alsek]]-Tatshenshini drainage flows directly into the Pacific from the southwestern Yukon. A number of rivers in the northern Yukon flow directly into the Arctic Ocean. The two main Yukon rivers flowing into the [[Mackenzie River]] in the Northwest Territories are the [[Liard]] River in the southeast and the [[Peel River (Canada)|Peel River]] and its tributaries in the northeast.

==Climate==
Most of the Yukon has a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] Dfc), characterized by long cold winters and brief warm summers. The airstrip at Snag, 25 kilometres east of [[Beaver Creek, Yukon|Beaver Creek]] near the Alaska border, experienced the lowest ever [[temperature]] measured in North America, -63.0 °[[Celsius|C]] (-81.4 °[[Fahrenheit|F]]) on [[February 3]], [[1947]]. The [[Arctic Ocean]] coast has a [[Polar climate|Tundra climate]] (ET). The climate is generally very dry, with little precipitation, but is considerably wetter in the southeast. Precipitation is much greater in the mountains, and the snowpack continues to melt well into the summer, resulting in high water in July or August.

==Ecology==
Except for the [[Arctic Ocean]] [[coastal plain]] and high elevations, most of the Yukon is in the [[boreal forest]] [[ecoregion]]. Most mountain peaks and higher elevations are characterized by Alpine [[tundra]] while the Arctic coastal plain is Arctic tundra. More precisely, according to [[Environment Canada]]'s ecozone definitions, the southern and central Yukon is part of the [[Boreal Cordillera Ecozone]] while the northern forest is part of the [[Taiga Cordillera Ecozone]]. The [[Peel River (Canada)|Peel River]] area in the northeast is in the [[Taiga Plains Ecozone]] and the Arctic coast is in the [[Southern Arctic Ecozone]].

[[Image:Fireweed Yukon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Fireweed]] ''Epilobium angustifolium, the Yukon's territorial flower and [[White Spruce]] (''Picea glauca'') in the southern Yukon near the South [[Klondike Highway]].]]
===Flora===
[[Black Spruce]] (''Picea mariana''), [[White Spruce]] (''Picea glauca''), [[Aspen|Quaking Aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') and [[Balsam poplar]] (''Populus balsamifera'') are found throughout the territory. Although relatively uncommon, the Alaska birch (''Betula neoalaskana'') is also found in most areas. The [[Lodgepole Pine]] (''Pinus contorta'') reaches its northern extreme the south-central part of the territory, while [[Tamarack]] (''Larix laricina'') is found in the southeast and the [[Fir|Sub-Alpine fir]] (''Abies lasiocarpa'') is found at higher elevations in the southern part of the Territory.

===Fauna===
The large mammals found throughout the territory include [[Caribou]] (''Rangifer tarandus'', both barren-ground and woodland), [[Moose]] (''Alces alces''), [[Wolf|Wolves]] (''Canis lupus''), [[Grizzly Bear|Grizzly bears]] (''Ursus arctos horribilis'') and [[American black bears]] (''Ursus americanus''). Higher elevation have [[Dall sheep]] (''Ovis dalli'') and, in the south, [[Rocky Mountain Goat]] (''Oreamnos americanus''). [[Polar Bear]]s (''Ursus maritimus'') are found on the Arctic coast. The [[Mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hermionus'') and its predator, the [[Cougar]] (''Puma concolor''), are becoming increasingly common in the south, and [[Coyote]]s (''Canis latrans'') are increasing their range to the northern Yukon. [[Elk]] and [[Bison]] have been introduced.

There are many species of [[rodent]]s, including [[Squirrel]]s, [[Spermophilus|Ground squirrels]], [[Lemming]]s, [[Pika]]s, [[Beaver]]s, various [[Vole]]s, [[Porcupine]]s, [[Muskrat]]s, etc. [[Mustelid]]s are also well represented and include the [[Wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo''), [[Marten]] (''Martes Americana''), [[Stoat|Ermine]] (''Mustela erminea''), [[Least Weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), [[American Mink]] (''Mustela vison''), and the [[River Otter]] (''Lontra Canadensis''). Other small carnivores present are the [[Canadian Lynx|Lynx]] (''Lynx canadensis''), [[Red Fox]] ('' Vulpes vulpes'') and [[Arctic Fox]] (''Alopex lagopus'') along the northern coast. 

More than 250 species of [[bird]]s have been sighted in the Yukon. The [[Common Raven]] ''(Corvus corax)'' is the territorial bird and is common everywhere. Other common resident birds include  [[Bald Eagle]]s '' (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)'', [[Golden Eagle]]s ''(Aquila chrysaetos)'',  [[Gyrfalcon]] (''Falco rusticolus'') and [[Peregrine falcon]] (''Falco peregrinus''), five species of [[grouse]] ([[Spruce Grouse]], [[Blue Grouse]], [[Ruffed Grouse]], [[Ptarmigan]], and [[White-tailed Ptarmigan]]). Many [[migratory bird]]s breed in the Yukon, as it is at the northern end of the [[Pacific Flyway]].

Other than the [[Burbot]] and [[Northern Pike]], most of the large fish found in Yukon rivers, lakes and streams are [[Salmonidae|Salmonid]]s. Four species of [[Oncorhynchus|Pacific salmon]] ([[Chinook salmon|Chinook]], [[Sockeye salmon|Sockeye]], [[Coho salmon|Coho]] and [[Chum salmon|Chum]]) breed in Yukon rivers and lakes in the [[Pacific]] and [[Yukon River]] watersheds. The [[Yukon River]] has the longest freshwater migration route of any salmon; Chinook salmon swim over 3,000 kilometres from its mouth in the Bering Sea to spawning grounds upstream of [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]]. There are also land-locked kokanee ([[Sockeye Salmon]]) and [[Rainbow trout]]. [[Salvelinus|Chars]] are represented by [[Lake trout]] present in most large Yukon lakes, as well as [[Dolly Varden trout|Dolly Varden]],  [[Bull trout]] and [[Arctic char]]. The [[Arctic Grayling]] is ubiquitous, while the lakes have various [[Coregonus|Whitefish]] and [[Inconnu]].

There are no [[reptile]]s in the Yukon, but a few [[frog]]s.

==Human Geography==
The Yukon is sparsely populated, with about 30,000 inhabitants in a territory almost as large as Spain or Sweden. Population density is 0.06 people per [[km²]]. Close to three quarters of the population is in the [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] area, and the rest live in a number of other [[List of communities in Yukon|communities]]. All except [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]] are accessible by road. 

The capital, Whitehorse, is also the largest city with more than two thirds of the population; the second largest is [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]], (pop. 1800) which was the capital until [[1952]]. 

Traditionally, the Yukon was inhabited by nomadic [[Athapaskan]]-speaking [[First Nations]] people who had established extensive trading networks with the Pacific Coast [[Tlingit]]. The interior people traded [[copper]], furs and meat for coastal products such as [[eulachon]] oil. About 20% of the Yukon population is of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] origin. 

There is no [[Inuit]] population in the Yukon, although there was a population along the [[Arctic Ocean]] coast within historic times. The Inuit were decimated by disease and disappeared in the 19th century.

The following table presents the population of most [[List of communities in Yukon|Yukon communities]]. Note that the [[Canada 2001 Census|Census]] data represents those people who lived within the community boundaries, while the Yukon Bureau of Statistics (YBS) includes everyone with a postal address in the community. Typically, many people live immediately outside the community boundaries, hence the larger YBS numbers.

==Natural Resources==
The Yukon has abundant mineral resources and [[mining]] was the mainstay of the economy until recently. Abundant [[gold]] was found in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike region]] leading to the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] of [[1898]]. [[Placer mining|Placer]] gold is found in many streams and rivers, and there is an active placer mining industry in the Klondike and many other parts of the Yukon to this day. 

Other minerals that have been actively mined include [[copper]] in the [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] area, [[lead]] and [[zinc]] in [[Faro, Yukon|Faro]], [[silver]], [[zinc]] and [[lead]] in the [[Mayo, Yukon|Mayo]]/[[Keno City, Yukon|Keno City]] area, [[asbestos]] in [[Clinton Creek, Yukon|Clinton Creek]], and copper, gold, and coal in the [[Carmacks, Yukon|Carmacks]] area. The world's largest known deposit of [[tungsten]] is in the [[Macmillan Pass]] area in the [[Mackenzie Mountains]] near the [[Northwest Territories]] border. Non-metallic minerals mined have included [[jade]] and [[barite]].

The fur trade was very important to the Yukon [[First Nation]] economy, but low prices and the impact of [[animal rights activism|animal rights activists]] have devastated the traditional economy.

There are three [[hydroelectric]] generating stations in the Yukon: one at [[Schwatka Lake]] in Whitehorse, another near Mayo and a third on [[Aishihik Lake]].

While the Yukon is mostly covered with forests, most of the trees are small and take a long time to grow and regenerate because of the dry cold climate. There is a considerable amount of small scale [[logging]], but the only area that can sustain industrial forestry is in the southeast with its wetter climate. However, distance from markets and fluctuating prices have resulted in a boom-and-bust industry.

A small amount of [[natural gas]] is currently produced in the southeast, but little exploration has been done in other parts of the Yukon. It is believed that there are abundant natural gas fields in the Eagle Plains area along the [[Dempster Highway]] and possibly in the Whitehorse area, but distance from [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] has hampered exploration.

==Environmental issues==
[[Global warming]] is affecting the north more than other parts of the world and the Yukon is no exception. While residents might welcome warmer temperatures, the ultimate effects are not known. Higher temperatures would mean more [[evaporation]] and drying out an already dry climate, resulting in more [[forest fire]]s and reducing the biological productivity of [[boreal forest]]s, whose growth is limited more by lack of moisture than temperature.

The Yukon is also the recipient of airborne pollutants from other parts of the world, especially [[Persistent Organic Pollutant]]s. Consumption of the liver of certain wild animals and fish is no longer recommended because of these.

Locally, [[mine reclamation]] and dealing with mine [[tailings]] that cause [[acid mine drainage]] left over from [[mine closure]]s is a major problem and is likely to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to clean-up.

In an effort to encourage natural resource exploration, the current (2005) [[Yukon Party]] government led by [[Dennis Fentie]] has suspended the application of the Protected Areas Strategy (established by a previous [[Yukon New Democratic Party]] government) and has indicated its intention of not creating additional protected areas or parks.

The [[Gwichʼin]] people of [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]] are dependent on the Porcupine [[caribou]] herd for food and clothing, as are others in the Yukon. The Porcupine caribou herd migrates to the coastal plain in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] (ANWR) in [[Alaska]] to give birth. That herd may be seriously threatened by [[oil well|oil-drilling]] in the ANWR.
