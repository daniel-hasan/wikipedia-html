The following list comprises the characters that form the three ranks of the army of the greek goddess Athena, in the japanese [[manga]] ''[[Saint Seiya]]'', written and illustrated by [[Masami Kurumada]].

Athena's army is the main warring faction presented by Kurumada in his work. Although the three ranks swore allegiance to Athena, Kurumada presented some of the characters at first in an antagonic role, later revealing their true nature.

He easily defeated Lionet Ban in his first match but was outmatched against Andromeda Shun whose chains proved impenetrable.

The Hydra Saint underestimated his opponent who froze him to near death. Ashamed by his defeat, he asked Saori for permission to undergo further training in Finland with his master. She agreed and thus Ichi didn't reappear until Saori was put in danger in Sanctuary after being struck by a golden arrow. From then on, he served her as Athena and came to reside in Sanctuary.

After a brief appearance during the Twelve Temples arc in a flashback, to date, June has never reappeared in Kurumada's manga.

===Silver Saints===
{{nihongo||白銀聖闘士|Shirubā Seinto}}

The Saints wearing the second-highest ranked Cloths are the Silver Saints, the specialists in battle. They possess advanced mastery of Cosmo, which enables them to attain speeds ranging from [[mach number|mach]] 2 to 5, and also grants them tremendous physical strength. When they receive an assignment from the Sanctuary, they go to any part of the world to fulfill it, whatever the cost, using all their power. They represent the true concept of a Saint of Athena.

Another of their responsibilities is to take care of the Cloths that do not have owners. It is common to find Silver Saints training potential candidates to gain one of these Cloths. As many Saints and Cloths were lost in the last Holy War, training new Saints and increasing the ranks are important tasks to be fulfilled before the next Holy War.<ref>Saint Seiya Encyclopedia, page 61 ISBN 4-8342-1690-X</ref>

The Silver Cloths are more beautiful and stronger than Bronze Cloths. They freeze at a temperature of -200°C. Currently there have only been eighteen Silver Cloths confirmed, however, the Silver Cloths of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Scutum|Shield]] and [[Crux|Southern Cross]], created by Masami Kurumada for the first Saint Seiya theatrical release, as well as their bearers, are considered canonical.

The seventeenth and eighteenth Silver Cloths were revealed in the Saint Seiya Encyclopedia; they represent the constellations of [[Crater (constellation)|Crateris]] and [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]], although the latter has never been featured in any arcs of the manga to date. In total there are twenty-four Silver Saints, but only sixteen were revealed by Kurumada in the story arcs of his manga Saint Seiya. Recently, since the start of ''[[Saint Seiya Next Dimension]]'', the canonical continuation of Kurumada's original manga, a new Silver Saint was added to the universe, Crateris Suikyō, whose Cloth differs entirely from the one shown in the Saint Seiya Encyclopedia.

*'''Eagle Marin'''
:{{nihongo||鷲星座の魔鈴|Īguru no Marin}}
:Voice actor: [[Yuriko Yamamoto]], [[Fumiko Inoue]], [[Christine Auten]] (English)
:'''Techniques:''' Empty Fist, Meteor Punches, Eagle Toe Flash.

:An enigmatic female Silver Saint of strong personality, she was assigned as mentor of the young Seiya when he arrived to Sanctuary, as both were of japanese nationality. She instructed him in the ways of the Saints with a stern hand and strict discipline, enabling him to cultivate his enormous potential. Due to the code of the female Saints, Seiya never had the chance to know her mentor's facial features, as she always concealed her behind her mandatory mask. Although Seiya endured hardships during his training, he and Marin bonded strongly. Due to Marin's physical appearance, her pupil Seiya long wondered if she and her long-lost sister Seika were one and the same, a question that would take time to be answered as Marin was aware of the machinations of the false Pope of Sanctuary and involved herself in the rebellion to overthrow him. Marin assists Seiya and the Bronze Saints in their battle against the Silver Saints, after which she disappears temporarily. During this absence, Marin made shocking discoveries when she entered, at the risk of her life, the forbidden place known as Star Hill, learning the truth about the false Pope and his rise to power. She reappears during the climax of the conflict of the twelve temples, saving Seiya's life and helping him to reach the Pope's chambers. During the resurrection of Poseidon, Marin once again parts on business of her own, reappearing until the climax of the war against Hades, when she reveals the reason of her long absence: She had been able to locate Seiya's sister Seika, finally dissipating the enigma of her identity and ending a tortuous and seemingly futile search that had lasted years. Also, Marin reveals she had also been searching for her long lost brother, Tōma, who became an Angel, one of the servants of the goddess Artemis. During Seiya and the Bronze Saints' battle against Thanatos in the Elysion fields, Marin bravely opposses the deities' murderous attempts on Seika's life, finally achieving, after the defeat of Hades and his army, the rejoining of the siblings at long last. Recently, she battled the Angel Tōma, preventing him from taking Seiya's life. Although she felt Tōma as someone from her past, she remains ignorant of his true identity and relation to her.

:'''Techniques:''' Mavrou Trypa (μαύρου τρύπα, greek for "black hole", although the grammatically correct form is μαύρη οπή, ''Mavri Opi'')

:Misty was a narcissist who considered himself inferior only to the goddess Athena herself. Misty made it clear when he was sent to Japan with his fellow Silver Saints to deal with the renegade Bronze Saints. When Phoenix Ikki came back to his senses with the help of his fellow Bronze Saints, the Lizard Saint created a landslide in the hopes of burying them, but he was unsuccessful. Aries Mu created illusions which made the four Black Saints look like the Bronze Saints and teleported them all eight from the landslide. The Silver Saints were deceived by the illusion and went after the Black Saints but Eagle Marin and Misty went after the real Pegasus. Marin, in hopes of saving Seiya, attacked her pupil with an illusion attack and buried him. Misty however didn't fall for it and took the Bronze Saint out of his grave and attacked him. The Silver Saint told Seiya that he had never been bruised in battle and that itself was true victory in Misty's view, never to be hurt by an opponent. During the fight some blood from Seiya fell on Misty, who was disgusted by it cleaned it off. Thus, he removed his Cloth and went into the nearby sea. Seiya deemed him crazy and as soon as Misty donned his Cloth again, the battle continued. After, a hard battle, Pegasus Seiya overcame Misty's attacks and defeated him.

:In the adaptation to anime of the Hades arc from the manga, Misty was revived along with his fellow Silver Saints and was sent to fight the Bronze Saints.

Thinking they completed their mission, they retreated, but returned due to Misty and Babel's delay. Being accompanied by Hound Asterion, who could read minds, Mozes soon turned on Eagle Marin. After subduing her, they tied her upside down to a pole in the sea, to use her as bait for Pegasus Seiya. The plan failed, and Seiya engaged Mozes in combat. After a bloody battle, Seiya sprouted wings from his Cosmo, and Mozes was defeated.

He was sent along with Misty, Asterion and Mozes to kill the Bronze Saints for their crimes against Sanctuary. However, due to Aries Mu's intervention, they went after the wrong Saints, ending up killing the Black Saints instead. Believing they had accomplished their mission, they retreated, though Misty stayed behind to confirm his suspicions. After some time, Babel grew worried and returned to find Misty dead on the beach. Cygnus Hyōga soon arrived and challenged the Silver Saint, who was confused because he thought he had already killed the Bronze Saint. Babel regained his composure and fought, confident he had the advantage with his flames, but was ultimately defeated by Hyōga's freezing Cosmo.

:''Named after the Biblical [[Tower of Babel]]. Kurumada gave Babel's constellation name as Centaurus in the Shōnen Jump serialization of the manga. In the anime adaptation, Babel's constellation name used the alternative japanese spelling Santōru.''

Thinking they had completed their mission, they retreated, but came back due to Misty and Babel's late return. As Asterion is one of the few people in the Sanctuary who can use telepathy, he soon discovered that Eagle Marin had betrayed them. After defeating her, he and Mozes used her as bait for Pegasus Seiya by tying her to a pole upside down in the sea. Pegasus Seiya came to them and narrowly managed to defeat Mozes, but was overwhelmed by Asterion's power. In the meantime, Eagle Marin was able to free herself and fought against Asterion. By closing her mind and thinking of nothing, she managed to defeat him, but let him live and return to Sanctuary with a warning to the Pope.

Regarded as a man who boasted the greatest raw strength among the Gold Saints, and revered as the wise father figure known as Rōshi, the Old Master, Dohko exerted the task of judging good and evil among the Saints, and his guidance was a key element in the triumphs of the Bronze Saints in the 20th century. After Hades' defeat in the past, Dohko was granted by Athena the divine gift of the ''Misopethamenos'', a miraculous ability that turned his body virtually impervious to aging, as he was entrusted by her to guard the tower that contained the sealed souls of Hades' Specters, in the centuries to come, as their resurrection would be the harbinger of the advent of the new holy war. Dohko returned to his home in Lushan and spent the next almost three centuries waiting for Hades' return, becoming a diminutive, wrinkled man.

Dohko's experience from the past proves a crucial element in the Saints' victory, as he revealed the secret of the Eighth Sense, he devised a strategy to pierce the Wailing Wall and revealed the location of Hades' true body in Elysion.
