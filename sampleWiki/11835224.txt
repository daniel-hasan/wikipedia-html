==Childhood and education==
Jefferson, who grew up in [[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-Op City]] in [[the Bronx]] and played many years in the [[Little League Baseball|Co-Op City Little League]], graduated from [[Harry S. Truman High School (New York City)|Harry S. Truman High School]] in 1980, and attended [[Bethune-Cookman College]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] from 1981 to 1983. He later obtained his [[Bachelor's degree]] at [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]] in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York]]. <ref name=DailyNews>Coffey, Wayne.

Accessed [[June 18]], [[2007]].</ref> 

==Baseball career==
He was selected by the New York Mets organization in first round (20th pick overall) of the [[Major League Baseball Draft|free agent draft]] on [[June 6]], [[1983]]. <ref>[http://www.ultimatemets.com/profile.php?PlayerCode=0384 Stan Jefferson - Ultimate Met Database]</ref>

After toiling in the [[Minor League Baseball|minors]] for three years, Jefferson played in 14 games for the Mets during the last month of the [[1986 in baseball|1986 season]] before he was sent to the San Diego Padres in the nine-player [[Kevin McReynolds]]-[[Kevin Mitchell (baseball player)|Kevin Mitchell]] deal at the end of the year. Though he became a regular in the Padres outfield in 1987, he clashed with manager [[Larry Bowa]] in May and spent much of the first half on the [[disabled list]]. Jefferson stole 33 bases but batted just .230 that year, severely hindering his shot at remaining San Diego's full-time outfielder. 

In 1988 Jefferson performed horribly, batting .144 over 111 at-bats. At the end of the season he was traded with [[Jimmy Jones (baseball player)|Jimmy Jones]] and [[Lance McCullers]] to the New York Yankees for [[Jack Clark (baseball player)|Jack Clark]] and [[Pat Clements]]. He logged just 12 at-bats with the Yankees before being shipped to the Baltimore Orioles for [[John Habyan]] in July 1989. For the next year and a half, he played intermittently for the Baltimore Orioles, the Cleveland Indians, and the Cincinnati Reds. After just 19 games with the Reds in 1991, Jefferson was released for good. 

Jefferson later became a coach for the [[Pioneer League]] [[Butte Copper Kings]]. When the player's strike threatened the [[1995 in baseball|1995 season]], Jefferson became a much-maligned [[1994 Major League Baseball strike#Replacement players|replacement player]] for his original team, sharing the outfield with fellow ex-Met [[Herm Winningham]]. <ref name=BaseballLibrary> [http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/J/Jefferson_Stan.stm Stan Jefferson - BaseballLibrary.com]</ref>

==NYPD career==
In 1997, with his baseball career over, Jefferson joined the [[New York City Police Department]]. He was on duty during the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], and worked at [[Ground zero#World Trade Center|Ground Zero]] after the collapse of the [[World Trade Center]]. He suffered health problems as a result of his time at Ground Zero, and retired from the NYPD in 2004. <ref name=DailyNews>Coffey, Wayne.
