'''Nhat Hanh''' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''Nhất Hạnh''; {{pronounced|tʰǐk ɲɜ̌t hɐ̂<sup>ʔ</sup>ɲ}} {{Audio|ThichNhatHanh.ogg|listen}} (born [[October 11]] [[1926]] in central [[Vietnam]]) is an expatriate [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] [[monk]], teacher, author, and [[Peace movement|peace]] [[activism|activist]]. He joined a Zen [[monastery]] at the age of 16, studied Buddhism as a novice, and was fully ordained as a monk in [[1949]]. Commonly referred to as Thich Nhat Hanh, the title ''Thích'' is used by all Vietnamese monks and nuns, meaning that they are part of the Shakya (Shakyamuni [[Buddha]]) clan.<ref name="lineage">Phap Dung, Brother (2006) "A Letter to Friends About Our Lineage", published on the Plum Village website[http://www.orderofinterbeing.org/wiki/index.php?title=Lineage]</ref> He coined the term [[Engaged Buddhism]] in his book ''Vietnam: Lotus in a Sea of Fire''.<ref name="giaodiem">Nhu, Quan (2002) "Nhat Hanh's Peace Activities" in "Vietnamese Engaged Buddhism: The Struggle Movement of 1963-66", reprinted on the Giao Diem site [http://www.giaodiem.com/FotoNews/nh_quannhu.htm]</ref>

In the early 1960s, he founded the School of Youth for Social Services (SYSS) in [[Saigon]], a grassroots relief organization that rebuilt bombed villages, set up schools and medical centers, and resettled families left homeless during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="BBC">Author and date unknown, "Thich Nhat Hanh", feature article on the BBC website [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/features/thich_nhat_hanh/]</ref>  He traveled to the U.S. a number of times to study at [[Princeton University]], and later lecture at [[Cornell University]] and teach at [[Columbia University]].

== Biography ==
Thich Nhat Hanh was born Nguyễn Xuân Bảo in Thừa Thiên (Central [[Vietnam]]) in 1926. At the age of 16 he entered the monastery at Từ Hiếu Temple near [[Huế]], [[Vietnam]], where his primary teacher was [[Dhyana]] ([[meditation]]; [[Zen]]) Master Thanh Quý Chân Thật.<ref name="lineage">[http://www.orderofinterbeing.org/wiki/index.php?title=Lineage]</ref><ref>Cordova, Nathaniel (2005) "The Tu Hieu Lineage of Thien (Zen) Buddhism", blog entry on the Woodmore Village website [http://www.woodmoorvillage.org/2005/08/the_tu_hieu_lin.html]</ref><ref>Author and date unknown, "Thich Nhat Hanh", published on the Community of Interbeing, UK website [http://www.interbeing.org.uk/teachers/thay.html]</ref> A graduate of Bao Quoc Buddhist Academy in Central Vietnam,<ref name="giaodiem">Nhu, Quan (2002) "Nhat Hanh's Peace Activities" in "Vietnamese Engaged Buddhism: The Struggle Movement of 1963-66",  reprinted on the Giao Diem website [http://www.giaodiem.com/FotoNews/nh_quannhu.htm]</ref> Thich Nhat Hanh received training in [[Zen]] (in Vietnamese: [[Thien|Thiền]]) and the [[Mahayana]] school of [[Buddhism]] and was ordained as a monk in [[1949]]. Thich Nhat Hanh is now recognized as a Dharmacharya and as the spiritual head of the Từ Hiếu Temple and associated monasteries.<ref>Mau, Thich Chi (1999) "Application for the publication of books and sutras", letter to the Vietnamese Governmental Committee of Religious Affairs, re-printed on the Plum Village website [http://www.plumvillage.org/news/Press_Application%20for%20the%20publication%20of%20books%20and%20sutras%20-%20Tu%20Hie.htm]</ref> He is the Elder of the Từ Hiếu branch of the 8th generation of the Liễu Quán lineage in the 42nd generation of the Lâm Tế Dhyana school (Lin Chi [[Chán]] 臨濟禪 in Chinese or [[Rinzai]] Zen in Japanese).<ref name="lineage">[http://www.orderofinterbeing.org/wiki/index.php?title=Lineage]</ref> On [[May 1]], [[1966]] at Từ Hiếu Temple, Thich Nhat Hanh received the “lamp transmission”, making him a Dharmacharya or Dharma Teacher, from Master Chân Thật.<ref name="lineage"> [http://www.orderofinterbeing.org/wiki/index.php?title=Lineage]</ref>  Thich Nhat Hanh has combined his deep knowledge of a variety of traditional Zen teachings with methods from [[Theravada]] Buddhism, insights from [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, and ideas from Western psychology to form his approach to modern meditation practice. Thich Nhat Hanh has become an important influence in the development of [[Western Buddhism]].

In [[1956]] he was named Editor-in-Chief of ''Vietnamese Buddhism'', the periodical of the Unified Vietnam Buddhist Association (Giáo Hội Phật Giáo Việt Nam Thống Nhất). In the following years he founded Lá Bối Press, the Van Hanh Buddhist University in [[Saigon]], and the School of Youth for Social Service (SYSS), a neutral corps of Buddhist peaceworkers who went into rural areas to establish schools, build healthcare clinics, and help re-build villages.<ref name="BBC">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/features/thich_nhat_hanh/]</ref>

== During the Vietnam War ==
Van Hanh Buddhist University became a prestigious private university that focused on Buddhist studies, Vietnamese culture, and languages. Nhat Hanh taught Buddhist psychology and ''Prajnaparamita'' literature. At a meeting in April [[1965]], Van Hanh Union students issued a ''Call for Peace'' statement. Its main theme was: "It is time for North and South Vietnam to find a way to stop the war and help all Vietnamese people live peacefully and with mutual respect." When Thich Nhat Hanh left for the U.S. shortly afterwards, control over Van Hanh University was taken over by one of the Chancellors who wished to sever ties with Thich Nhat Hanh and the SYSS, calling Sister [[Chan Khong]], who was left in control of the organization, a [[Communism|"communist"]]. From that point, the SYSS struggled to raise funds and endured a number of attacks on its members, many of whom were threatened, harassed, and murdered. The SYSS persisted in their efforts, refusing to take sides in the conflict and continuing to provide aid to people in need.<ref name="giaodiem">Nhu, Quan (2002) "Nhat Hanh's Peace Activities" in "Vietnamese Engaged Buddhism: The Struggle Movement of 1963-66", reprinted on the Giao Diem site [http://www.giaodiem.com/FotoNews/nh_quannhu.htm]</ref>

Thich Nhat Hanh has been a leader in the [[Engaged Buddhism]] movement and he is credited with bringing the idea to the West. He credits the thirteenth-century Vietnamese King Tran Nhan Tong with the origination of the concept. Tran Nhan Tong abdicated his throne to become a monk, and founded the still dominant Vietnamese Buddhist school, the Bamboo Forest tradition.<ref>Information on the Vietnamese Plum Village website [http://langmai.org/TNH/BaoChiTPhuong/Data/A%20Monk%20for.pdf]</ref>

In [[1960]], Thich Nhat Hanh came to the U.S. to study [[comparative religion]] at [[Princeton University]], and he was subsequently appointed lecturer in Buddhism at [[Columbia University]]. By then, he had gained fluency in [[French language|French]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[English language|English]], in addition to his native Vietnamese. In [[1963]] he returned to Vietnam to aid his fellow monks in their non-violent peace efforts.

Thich Nhat Hanh returned to the US in 1966 to lead a symposium in Vietnamese Buddhism at [[Cornell University]] and to continue his work for peace. Thich Nhat Hanh had written a letter to [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in 1965 entitled: “Searching for the Enemy of Man” and it was during his 1966 stay in the U.S. that Thich Nhat Hanh met with Martin Luther King, Jr. and urged him to publicly denounce the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>"Searching for the Enemy of Man", in Nhat Nanh, Ho Huu Tuong, Tam Ich, Bui Giang, Pham Cong Thien. ''Dialogue''. Saigon: La Boi, 1965. P. 11-20., archived on the African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War website [http://www.aavw.org/protest/king_journey_abstract09.html]</ref>

Dr. King gave his famous speech at the [[Riverside Church]] in [[New York City]] in [[1967]],<ref>"Beyond Vietnam", April 4, 1967, speech made by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the Riverside Church, NYC, archived on the African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War website  [http://www.aavw.org/special_features/speeches_speech_king01.html]</ref> his first to publicly question the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Later that year, Dr. King nominated Thich Nhat Hanh for the 1967 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. In his nomination Rev. King said, "I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of [this prize] than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity." (Despite King's high praise, the committee decided not to make an award that year. King's revelation of his nomination was a violation of tradition and the explicit "strong request" of the prize committee.)<ref name="nomination">"Nomination of Thich Nhat Hanh for the Nobel Peace Prize" letter by Martin Luther King, Jr., 1967, archived on the Hartford Web Publishing website [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/025.html]</ref>

In [[1969]], Thich Nhat Hanh was the delegate for the Buddhist Peace Delegation at the Paris Peace talks. When the [[Paris Peace Accords]] were signed in [[1973]], the Vietnamese government denied Thich Nhat Hanh permission to return to Vietnam, and he went into exile in France. From [[1976]] through [[1977]], he led efforts to help rescue Vietnamese [[boat people]] in the [[Gulf of Thailand|Gulf of Siam]], but was forced to stop because of the hostility of the governments of [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]].<ref>Author and date unknown, "Thich Nhat Hanh", article on the Integrative Spirituality website [http://www.integrativespirituality.org/postnuke/html/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=printpage&artid=308]</ref>  In 1969, Thich Nhat Hanh established the [[Unified Buddhist Church]] (Église Bouddhique Unifiée) in France (not a part of the [[Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam]]).

== Establishing the Order of Interbeing ==
In [[1975]], he formed the Sweet Potatoes Meditation Center. The center grew and in [[1982]] he and his colleague [[Chan Khong|Sister Chân Không]] founded [[Plum Village]] Buddhist Center (Làng Mai), a [[monastery]] and Practice Center in the [[Dordogne]] in the south of France.<ref name="BBC">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/features/thich_nhat_hanh/]</ref> Since the mid 60s he has headed a monastic and lay group, the [[Order of Interbeing (Tiep Hien)|Order of Inter-Being]], teaching the Five and Fourteen [[Mindfulness]] Trainings and "[[Engaged Buddhism]]." The Unified Buddhist Church is the legally recognized governing body for Plum Village (Làng Mai) in France, for [[Blue Cliff Monastery]] in Pine Bush, [[New York]], the Community of Mindful Living, Parallax Press, [[Deer Park Monastery]] in [[California]], and the Magnolia Village in Mississippi.<ref>Information about Practice Centers from the official Community of Mindful Living site [http://www.iamhome.org/about.htm]</ref>

There are now two monasteries in Vietnam, at the original Từ Hiếu Temple near [[Huế]] and at Prajna Temple in the central highlands. Thich Nhat Hanh and the Order of Interbeing have established monasteries and Dharma centers in the United States at [[Deer Park Monastery]] (Tu Viện Lộc Uyển) in [[Escondido, California]], Maple Forest Monastery (Tu Viện Rừng Phong) and Green Mountain Dharma Center (Ðạo Tràng Thanh Sơn) in [[Vermont]] both of which closed in 2007 and moved to the Blue Cliff Monastery in Pine Bush, [[New York]], and [[Magnolia Village Practice Center]] (Đạo Tràng Mộc Lan) in [[Mississippi]]. These monasteries are open to the public during much of the year and provide on-going [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]]s for lay people. The Order of Interbeing also holds focused retreats for groups of lay people, such as families, teenagers, veterans,<ref>Information about retreats from the Deer Park Monastery site [http://www.deerparkmonastery.org/about_us/ourteacher.html]</ref> the entertainment industry, members of Congress,<ref>"Thich Nhat Hahn Leads Retreat for Members of Congress" (2004) from the ''Faith and Politics'' newsletter, Rev.

== Return to Vietnam ==
From January 12 until April 11, [[2005]], Thich Nhat Hanh returned to Vietnam after a series of negotiations that allowed him to teach, have select titles of his books published in Vietnamese, and allowed 100 monastic and 90 lay members of his Order to accompany him in his travels around the country, including a return to his root temple, Tu Hieu Temple in Hue.<ref name="time">Johnson, Kay (2005) "A Long Journey Home", Time Asia Magazine (online version) [http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/article/0,13673,501050124-1018137,00.html]</ref><ref>Warth, Gary (2005) "Local Buddhist Monks Return to Vietnam as Part of Historic Trip", North County Times, re-published on the Buddhist Channel news website [http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=2,627,0,0,1,0]</ref>

Prior to the 2005 trip, Thich Nhat Hanh’s organization had been highly critical of the restrictions imposed by the Vietnamese government regarding a possible visit. Those restrictions included:  not allowing his monastics to stay in Buddhist monasteries, not allowing him to teach to large crowds as he does in the West, and not allowing his books to be published in Vietnamese.<ref>Phap An, Brother (1999) "When will Thay Nhat Hanh Return to Vietnam?", archived article on the Plum Village website  [http://www.plumvillage.org/news/Press_When%20Will%20Thay%20Nhat%20Hanh%20Return%20to%20Vietnam.htm]</ref>

The trip was not without controversy. Thich Vien Dinh writing on behalf of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (considered illegal by the Vietnamese government) called for Thich Nhat Hanh to make a statement against the Vietnam government’s poor record on religious freedom. Thich Vien Dinh feared that the trip would be used as propaganda by the Vietnamese government, making the world believe that the issues of religious freedom are improving there, while abuses continue.<ref>"Buddhist monk requests Thich Nhat Hanh "to see true situation in Vietnam", 2005, Letter from Thich Vien Dinh as reported by the Buddhist Channel news website [http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=1,686,0,0,1,0]</ref><ref>"Vietnam: International Religious Freedom Report 2005", 
Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, 2005, report published by the U.S. State Department [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51535.htm]</ref><ref>"Vietnam: The Suppression of the Unified Buddhist Church", Vol.7, No.4, 1995, Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, executive director [http://www.hrw.org/reports/1995/Vietnam.htm]</ref>

Nhat Hanh returned to Vietnam in 2007 despite continued controversy over his return and the continued house arrest of two top officials of the government-banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam.<ref name="time2">Johnson, Kay (2007) "The Fighting Monks of Vietnam", Time Magazine (online version accessed 3/7/2007) [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1595721,00.html]</ref> According to the Plum Village Website, the three goals of his 2007 trip back to Vietnam are to support new monastics in his order, organize and conduct "Great Chanting Ceremonies" intended to help heal remaining wounds from the Vietnam war, and to lead retreats for monastics and lay people.<ref>Sr. Tue Nghiem, (2006) "78 Days with Thay Nhat Hanh", Plum Village Website (accessed 3/7/2007) [http://www.plumvillage.org/indexHotNews/VNTrip2007.htm]</ref> The chanting ceremonies were originally called "Grand Requiem for Praying Equally for All to Untie the Knots of Unjust Suffering," but Vietnamese officials objected, saying it was improper to "equally" pray for soldiers in the South Vietnamese army or U.S. soldiers. Nhat Hanh agreed to change the name to "Grand Requiem For Praying."<ref name="time2">Johnson, Kay (2007) "The Fighting Monks of Vietnam", Time Magazine (online version accessed 3/7/2007) [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1595721,00.html]</ref>

== Names applied to him ==
The [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] title ''Thích'' ([[wikt:釋|釋]]) is from "Thích Ca" or "Thích Già" (釋迦), means "of the Shakya ([[Shakyamuni Buddha]]) clan."<ref name="lineage">[http://www.orderofinterbeing.org/wiki/index.php?title=Lineage]</ref> All Vietnamese (and Chinese) Buddhist monks and nuns adopt this title as their [[family name|"family" name]] or [[surname]] implying that their first family is the Buddhist community. In many Buddhist traditions, there are a progression of names that a person can receive. The first, the lineage name, is given when a person takes [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] in the [[Three Jewels]]. Thich Nhat Hanh's lineage name is Trung Quang. The next is a Dharma name, given when a person, lay or monastic, takes additional vows or when one is ordained as a monastic. Thich Nhat Hahn's Dharma name is Phung Xuan. Additionally, Dharma titles are sometimes given, and Thich Nhat Hanh's Dharma title is "Nhat Hanh".<ref name="lineage">[http://www.orderofinterbeing.org/wiki/index.php?title=Lineage]</ref>

Neither ''Nhất'' (一) nor ''Hạnh'' (行) &mdash; which approximate the roles of [[middle name|middle]] or intercalary name and [[given name]], respectively, when referring to him in English &mdash; was part of his name at birth. ''Nhất'' (一) means "one", implying "first-class," or "of best quality," in English; ''Hạnh'' (行) means "move", implying "[[Noble Eightfold Path#Virtue (Ethical Conduct)|right conduct]]" or "good nature."  Thích Nhất Hạnh has translated his Dharma Names in the following manner: Nhất = One, and Hạnh = Action. Taken collectively, his Dharma Names are best translated as "One Action". [[Vietnamese names]] follow this naming convention, placing the family or surname first, then the middle or intercalary name which often refers to the person's position in the family or generation, followed by the given name.<ref>"Vietnamese Names", Excerpted from "Culture Briefing: Vietnam", published by Geotravel Research Center, Kissimmee, Florida, 1995, on the Things Asian website [http://www.thingsasian.com/goto_article/article.630.html]</ref>

Thich Nhat Hanh is often referred to as "Thay" ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''Thầy'', "master; teacher") or Thay Nhat Hanh by his followers. On the Vietnamese version of the Plum Village website, he is also referred to as Thiền Sư Nhất Hạnh which can translated as "Zen Priest", "Zen Master", or "Dhyana Master".<ref>Title attributed to TNH on the Vietnamese Plum Village site [http://www.langmai.org/]</ref> Any Vietnamese monk or nun in the Mahayana tradition can be addressed as "Thầy" ("teacher"). Vietnamese Buddhist monks are addressed  "Thầy tu" ("priest" or "monk") and nuns are addressed "Sư Cô" ("sister") or "Sư Bà" ("elder sister").

{{wikiquote}}
*The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green earth in the present moment, to appreciate the peace and beauty that are available now.
**From ''Touching Peace'', Parallax Press, 1992, p. 1.  ISBN 0-938077-57-0

*If in our daily life we can smile, if we can be peaceful and happy, not only we, but everyone will profit from it. If we really know how to live, what better way to start the day than with a smile? Our smile affirms our awareness and determination to live in peace and joy. The source of a true smile is an awakened mind.
**From ''Peace Is Every Step: The Path of Mindfulness in Everyday Life'', Bantam reissue, 1992, ISBN 0-553-35139-7

*Your true home is in the here and the now. It is not limited by time, space, nationality, or race. Your true home is not an abstract idea. It is something you can touch and live in every moment. With mindfulness and concentration, the energies of the Buddha, you can find your true home in the full relaxation of your mind and body in the present moment. No one can take it away from you. Other people can occupy your country, they can even put you in prison, but they cannot take away your true home and your freedom.
