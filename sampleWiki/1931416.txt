The '''Blue iguana''' or '''Grand Cayman iguana''' ('''''Cyclura lewisi''''') is a [[critically endangered species]] of [[lizard]] of the genus ''[[Cyclura]]'' endemic to the island of [[Grand Cayman]]. Previously listed as ''Cyclura nubila lewisi'' as a subspecies of [[Cyclura nubila nubila|Cuban Iguana]], it has been since reclassified as its own species due to genetic differences discovered in 2000. The Blue iguana has been noted as one of the longest-living species of lizard (possibly 69 years) and is a National Symbol of the [[Cayman Islands]].

By the year 2003, fewer than 15 of these animals still lived in the wild, and this wild population was expected to be extinct within the first decade of the 21st century. The animals' demise is mainly being driven by [[predation]] by feral human pets (cats and dogs) and indirectly by the destruction of their natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] as fruit farms are converted to pasture for cattle grazing.

Since 2004, 219 captive-bred iguanas have been released into a preserve on Grand Cayman run by a partnership headed by the [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]], in an attempt to save this critically endangered species. Some success with naturally laid eggs has been reported in the wild. At least five non-profit organizations are working with the government of the Cayman Islands to ensure the survival of this species.

==Taxonomy==
The Grand Cayman Blue iguana, ''Cyclura lewisi'', is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman.<ref name="kenyon2"/> Its [[genus|generic]] name ''[[Cyclura]]'', is derived from the [[Greek]] words ''cyclos'' meaning "circular" and ''urus'' meaning "tail", after the thick ringed tail characteristic of all ''Cyclura'' [[iguana]]s.<ref name="Sanchez">

The Blue iguana's closest relatives are ''[[Cyclura nubila nubila|C. nubila nubila]]'' on [[Cuba]] and ''[[Cyclura cychlura|C. cychlura cychlura]]'' in the [[Bahamas]], all having apparently diverged from a common ancestor some three million years ago.<ref name="kenyon"/><ref name="kenyon2"/> The species has a low [[genetic diversity]] but does not seem to suffer the same lack of vitality that afflicts other such species of rock iguana.<ref name="Hudson"/><ref name="Malone"/> One theory is that the species evolved from a single female [[Cyclura nubila nubila|Cuban rock iguana]] (''C. nubila nubila'') with eggs inside her who drifted across the sea, perhaps during a storm.<ref name="kenyon">{{cite journal

In 1977, Schwartz and Carey established the [[trinomial nomenclature|trinomial]] ''Cyclura nubila lewisi'' for the blue iguana.<ref name="taxo"/><ref name="hollingsworth"/>  They held that the Grand Cayman blue iguana was a strongly distinct subspecies of ''C. nubila'', commonly known as the Cuban rock iguana, the species from which it evolved and with which it can breed. They emphasized its overall bright blue coloration, noting that further study may reveal this lizard to be a distinct species.<ref name="taxo"/><ref name="hollingsworth"/> The current taxonomic change was made in 2004 by Frederic Burton, who named the blue iguana a distinct species in its own right.<ref name="taxo"/> This decision was made after years of research comparing scale counts on the heads of other Caribbean iguanas, including those found on Little Cayman, Cayman Brac, Cuba, and the Bahamas, with those of the blue iguana, as well as [[mitochondrial DNA]] analysis performed by Dr. Catherine Malone, to re-examine the [[phylogeography]] of the different species.<ref name="taxo"/>

</ref>  As Blue iguanas have only a few [[Rod cell]]s they have poor vision in low-light conditions. At the same time they have cells called “double [[Cone cell|cone]]s” which give them sharp color vision and enable them to see [[ultraviolet]] wavelenghts.<ref name="Brames"/>  This ability is highly useful when basking so the animal can ensure that it absorbs enough sunlight in the forms of [[Ultraviolet|UVA]] and [[UVB]] to produce [[Vitamin D]].<ref name="devosjoli"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
[[Image:Cayman Islands (detail).jpg|thumb|300px|Cayman Islands]]
The Blue iguana is found only on the island of Grand Cayman. Comparison with other ''Cyclura'' species in the region strongly suggests that there was once a coastal population of Blue iguanas which was gradually displaced or extirpated by human settlements and the construction of roads.<ref name="iucn"/> The Blue iguana now only occurs inland in natural [[xerophytic]] shrubland and along the interfaces between farm clearings, roads, and gardens and closed-canopy dry forest or shrubland.<ref name="plan"/><ref name="iucn"/> The interior population is believed to have been attracted to agricultural clearings and fruit farms which provide thermoregulatory opportunities, herbaceous browse, fallen fruit, and nesting soil, but this also brought the Blue iguana into contact with humans and feral animals.<ref name="iucn"/> Females often migrate to coastal areas to nest.<ref name="salina">

One of the early difficulties the program encountered was that the captive stock of the early 1990s was found not to be pure.<ref name="herp"/><ref name="zoorole"/> It was discovered through DNA analysis and blood work that the captive population contained a number of individual animals that were [[hybrid]]s with ''C. nubila caymanensis''.<ref name="herp"/><ref name="zoorole"/> The program now contains only pure specimens, as these hybrids were sterilized by means of hemipenectomies and removed from the breeding program.<ref name="plan"/><ref name="zoorole"/><ref name="Dorge"/>

This program was created in order to determine the exact genealogies of the limited gene pool of the remaining animals.<ref name="zoorole"/> It was determined through DNA analysis that the entire North American captive population which was to be used as a base for reviving the species was descended from a single pair of animals.<ref name="zoorole"/> After five years of research two captive breeding populations were established and are managed as a single unit, with bloodline exchanges to promote genetic diversity.<ref name="zoorole"/>  

As a hedge against disaster striking the Blue iguana population on [[Grand Cayman]], an [[ex situ|off-island]] captive population was established in 25 zoos in the USA.<ref name="zoorole"/><ref name="plan"/> A minimum of 20 founder lines represented by at least 225 individuals is being maintained by captive breeding and recorded in a [[studbook]] for the species by Tandora Grant of the San Diego Zoo's Center for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species (CRES).<ref name="plan"/><ref name="zoorole"/><ref name="BIRP0606"/>  The Indianapolis zoo has had success with breeding the Blue iguana in captivity over a period of seven years.<ref name="hatch"> {{cite web

====Blue Iguana Recovery Programme====
Efforts to save the Blue iguana are being implemented as of 2007 by the Blue Iguana Recovery Programme (BIRP) which, with local and international partners, operates under the auspices of the National Trust for the Cayman Islands.<ref name="Burton"/> This program operates under a special exemption from provisions in the Animals Law of the Cayman Islands which normally would make it illegal for anyone to kill, capture, or keep iguanas.<ref name="plan"/><ref name="caymannetnews"/> 

BIRP's [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] strategy involves generating large numbers of genetically diverse hatchlings, head-starting them to an age where their chance of survival in the wild is high, and using these animals to rebuild a series of wild sub-populations in protected, managed natural areas.<ref name="plan"/><ref name="knapp">

When the restored wild sub-populations have reached the carrying capacity of their respective protected areas, release of head-started animals will be phased out, and the sub-populations will be left to reproduce naturally.<ref name="plan"/> In addition, guided by research and monitoring, control or eradication of non-native predators will be implemented to the degree necessary to allow young blue iguanas to survive to maturity in sufficient numbers to maintain these sub-populations.<ref name="plan"/><ref name="zoorole"/>

==Captivity==

The Blue Iguana is established in captivity, both in public and private collections.<ref name="devosjoli"/>  There are very few purebred animals in private collections. Private individuals have established these animals in captive breeding programs primarily as hybrids with the Lesser Caymans iguana(''C.nubila caymanensis'') and occasionally hybrids with the Cuban iguana(''C.n.nubila'')minimizing the demand for wild-caught specimens for the pet trade.<ref name="devosjoli">
