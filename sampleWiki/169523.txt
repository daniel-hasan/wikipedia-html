Nine cities submitting '''bids to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]'''{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} were recognised by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). The Committee shortlisted five of them—[[London]], [[Madrid]], [[Moscow]], [[New York City]], and [[Paris]]—from which London eventually prevailed; it will become the first city to host the [[Olympic Games]] for [[London Olympics|a third time]].<ref name="CNN">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SPORT/07/06/singapore.olympics/index.html |title=London wins 2012 Olympics |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=[[2005-07-07]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> The bidding process for the 2012 Olympics was considered one of the most hotly contested in the history of the IOC.<ref name="MSNBC">{{cite news |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8476616/ |title=London named 2012 Olympics host |date=[[2005-07-18]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> Paris was seen as the front-runner for most of the campaign,<ref name="BBC frontrunner">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/4655555.stm |title=London beats Paris to 2012 Games |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2005-07-06]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> but last-minute lobbying by London's supporters was one factor that led to the success of its bid.<ref name="CNN"/> Madrid was regarded as one of the favourites, but the city did not receive enough votes to surpass Paris and London.<ref name="Spain">{{cite news |url=http://www.thinkspain.com/news-spain/2228 |title=Spain bids for 2012 Olympics |publisher=ThinkSpain |date=[[2004-01-15]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref>

After a technical evaluation of the nine original bids, the top five were shortlisted on [[May 18]], [[2004]], becoming official candidates. The remaining applicant cities—[[Havana]], [[Istanbul]], [[Leipzig]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]—were eliminated.<ref name="IOC2012election">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/london/election_uk.asp |title=London 2012 Election |work=Olympic Games |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref> Four of the five candidate cities were highly recognised national capitals, which lent an increased competitive interest to the final bidding phase. Paris and Madrid earned the top scores during the application phase, but in early 2005, a more thorough evaluation of the candidates put Paris and London in a close race that became tighter as the final vote approached. On [[July 6]], [[2005]], in a four-round [[exhaustive ballot]] of the IOC (gathered at the [[117th IOC Session]] in [[Singapore]]),  Moscow, New York City, and Madrid were eliminated in the first three rounds. London won the final round by a margin of four votes over Paris and secured the right to host the 2012 Olympics.

In the month after the election, members of the Paris 2012 delegation argued that the London delegation had violated IOC rules. The key points in the accusations were London 2012's abortive athlete incentive initiative and lobbying by then-British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]].<ref name="wrongf"/> A public statement by IOC President [[Jacques Rogge]] dismissed these accusations, stating that the competition had been fair.<ref name="wrongg"/> Another controversy occurred during the bidding process when an undercover investigation by British television series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' revealed a corruption scandal associated with IOC member [[Ivan Slavkov]] and Olympic agents, who offered to deliver votes from IOC members to any 2012 Olympic bid in return for financial favours.<ref name="BBC BuyingGames"/> Still recovering from the effects of the [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|Salt Lake City scandal]], the IOC reacted swiftly and punitively toward the rule-breaking individuals.<ref name="Slavkov expelled"/>

==Bidding process==
The Olympic bidding process begins with the submission of a city's application to the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) by its [[National Olympic Committee]] (NOC) and ends with the election of the host city by the members of the IOC during an ordinary session. The process is governed by the [[Olympic Charter]], as stated in Chapter 5, Rule 34.<ref name="Charter">{{cite book |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf |title=Olympic Charter |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2007-03-28 |date=[[2004-09-01]] |format=PDF}}</ref> 

Since 1999, the process has consisted of two phases. During the first phase, which begins immediately after the bid submission deadline, the "applicant cities" are required to answer a questionnaire covering themes of importance to a successful Games organisation. This information allows the IOC to analyse the cities' hosting capacities and the strengths and weaknesses of their plans. Following a detailed study of the submitted questionnaires and ensuing reports, the IOC Executive Board selects the cities that are qualified to proceed to the next phase. The second phase is the true candidature stage: the accepted applicant cities (from now on referred to as "candidate cities") are required to submit a second questionnaire in the form of an extended, more detailed, candidature file.<ref name="CityElectionProc">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/missions/cities_uk.asp |title=Host City Election Procedure |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref> These files are carefully studied by the IOC Evaluation Commission, a group composed of IOC members, representatives of [[List of international sport federations|international sport federations]], NOCs, athletes, the [[International Paralympic Committee]], and international experts in various fields.<ref name="EvalCommis"/> The members of the Evaluation Commission then make four-day inspection visits to each of the candidate cities, where they check the proposed venues and are briefed about details of  the themes covered in the candidature file. The Evaluation Commission communicates the results of its inspections in a report sent to the IOC members up to one month before the electing IOC Session.<ref name="CityElectionProc"/>

The IOC Session in which a host city is elected takes place in a country that did not submit an application to stage the Olympics.<ref name="CityElectionProc"/> The election is made by the assembled active IOC members (excluding honorary and honour members), each possessing one vote. Members from countries that have a city taking part in the election cannot vote while the city is in the running. The voting is conducted in a succession of rounds until one bid achieves an [[absolute majority]] of votes; if this does not happen in the first round, the bid with the fewest votes is eliminated and another voting round begins. In the case of a tie for the lowest number of votes, a special runoff vote is carried out, with the winner proceeding to the next round. After each round, the eliminated bid is announced.<ref name="ElectionProc">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/utilities/faq_detail_uk.asp?rdo_cat=24_55_0 |title=FAQ - ELECTION OF AN OLYMPIC GAMES HOST CITY - Host city election |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref><ref name="SingElectionProc">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/events/117_session/election_uk.asp |title=Election procedure |work=117th IOC Session |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref> Following the announcement of the host city, the successful bid delegation signs the "Host City Contract" with the IOC, which delegates the responsibilities of the Games organisation to the city and respective NOC.<ref name="HostCityContract">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/ocog/index_uk.asp |title=The Organising Committees of the Olympic Games |work=The Movement |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref>

===Evaluation of applicant cities===
The deadline to submit applications for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games was [[July 15]], [[2003]]. The nine cities that submitted bids before that date also met the [[January 15]], [[2004]] deadline for submission of the first phase questionnaire.<ref name="2012candidproc"/> Through analysis of the questionnaires, the IOC gave a [[weighted average|weighted-average]] score to each city based on the scores obtained in each of the questionnaire's eleven themes: political and social support, general [[infrastructure]], sports venues, Olympic Village, environment, accommodation, transport, security, past experience, finance, and legacy. If a bid's score was higher than six (IOC's predefined benchmark score), the city was considered highly capable of hosting the Games; otherwise, its chances were very slim.<ref name="Report1">{{cite book |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_809.pdf |title=Report by the IOC candidature acceptance working group to the IOC Executive Board |publisher=International Olympic Committee |date=[[2004-03-12]] |accessdate=2007-03-26 |format=PDF |pages=97}}</ref> On [[May 18]], [[2004]], the IOC announced the cities accepted as candidates:<ref name="2012candidproc">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/events/117_session/candidature_uk.asp |title=Candidature Procedure for the 2012 Olympic Games |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2007-03-27}}</ref>

The five highest-rated applicants progressed to the next phase as official candidate cities.<ref name="2012candidproc"/> As stipulated, the IOC granted them the right to use the [[Olympic rings]] on their candidature emblem, together with a label identifying each as a "Candidate City".{{Ref_label|B|b|none}}

===Evaluation of candidate cities===
By [[November 15]], [[2004]], all candidates had submitted their candidature files to the IOC. After a period of analysis by the IOC, the cities were visited by the IOC Evaluation Commission, consisting of twelve members and chaired by [[Morocco|Moroccan]] IOC member [[Nawal El Moutawakel]].<ref name="EvalCommis">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/events/117_session/commission_uk.asp |title=Role and composition of the Evaluation Commission |work=117th IOC Session |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref> The four-day visits occurred between [[February 3]] and [[March 17]], [[2005]]:<ref name="2012candidproc"/> 

*{{flagicon|Spain}} [[Madrid]] — February 3–6
*{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[London]] — February 16–19
*{{flagicon|USA}} [[New York City]] — February 21–24
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Paris]] — March 9–12
*{{flagicon|Russia}} [[Moscow]] — March 14–17

The Parisian bid suffered two setbacks during the inspection: a number of strikes and demonstrations coincided with the visit, and a report was released stating that [[Guy Drut]], IOC member and one of the key members of Paris's bid team, would face charges over alleged political party financial corruption.<ref name="wrongb">{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1110389129 |title=Day One Of Paris 2012 Inspection By IOC |publisher=GamesBids |accessdate=2005-03-09}}</ref>

On [[June 6]], [[2005]], the IOC released the inspection team's evaluation reports of the five candidate cities.<ref name="2012candidproc"/> Although these documents did not contain scores or rankings, the report for Paris was considered the most positive, followed closely by London, which had narrowed most of the gap observed at the time of the first-phase evaluation in 2004. New York City and Madrid also obtained very positive evaluations, while Moscow was considered the weakest bid.<ref name="wrongc">{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1118060827 |title=Paris, London and New York Get Glowing IOC Reports |publisher=GamesBids |accessdate=2005-06-06}}</ref> On the same day, New York City's bid suffered a major setback following the report that the [[State of New York]] refused to fund [[West Side Stadium]], a New York 2012 centrepiece.<ref name="wrongd">{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1118096992 |title=Funding For New York 2012 Olympic Stadium Rejected |publisher=GamesBids |accessdate=2005-06-06}}</ref> The New York City campaign devised an alternative plan within a week, but such a major change with only one month remaining before the final vote damaged the city's chances.

Throughout the bidding process and leading up to the vote at the [[117th IOC Session]], Paris was widely seen as the favourite, particularly as its bid was the city's third in recent history (previous bids being for [[1992 Summer Olympics bids|1992]] and [[2008 Summer Olympics bids|2008]]). London was originally seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin, but this situation began to reverse with the appointment of [[Sebastian Coe]] as the head of London 2012, on [[May 19]], [[2004]].<ref name="BidPhotoFinish">{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1117995476 |title=Race For 2012 Summer Olympics Could be Photo Finish |date=[[2005-06-05]] |publisher=GamesBids |accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref> In late August 2004, reports emerged that predicted a tie between London and Paris.<ref name="wronge">{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1093970849 |title=London And Paris Tie In 2012 Bid |publisher=GamesBids |accessdate=2004-08-31}}</ref> In the final run-up to the 117th IOC Session, London and Paris appeared to be in an increasingly close contest. On [[July 1]], [[2005]], IOC president [[Jacques Rogge]], when asked who the winner would be, told the assembled press, "I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less."<ref name="Rogge quote">{{cite news |publisher=[[International Sailing Federation]] |accessdate=2007-03-06 |url=http://www.sailing.org/default.asp?ID=j1lFh5uql |title=Rogge Arrives in Singapore |date=[[2005-07-01]]}}</ref>

The electronic ballot began at 10:26 UTC, and the first three rounds eliminated Moscow, New York City and Madrid, respectively. After a city was eliminated, members from that city's country were allowed to vote in the following rounds. London and Paris made it to the fourth and final round of voting, which concluded at 10:45 UTC. An hour later, at 11:49 UTC, London was formally announced as the winner by Jacques Rogge.<ref name="BBC frontrunner"/> Approximately one billion viewers watched the announcement on live television.<ref name="InSingapore"/>

After the announcement, the ballot results were published: London gathered more votes in the first, third and final rounds, while Madrid won the second round despite falling short on votes in the third round and being eliminated. The competitiveness of the bids from Paris and London was ultimately demonstrated by a four-vote difference in the final round.

After [[Birmingham]] and [[Manchester]] failed to deliver winning bids for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympic Games]], the [[British Olympic Association]] (BOA) decided that London was the best choice to pursue the goal of hosting the Summer Olympics.<ref name="BBC London">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4233055.stm |title=Rivals for 2012: London |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2005-06-08]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> The centrepiece of the London bid was the [[Lower Lea Valley]], the location designated to be transformed into a world-class [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] and [[Olympic Village]].

London was considered to be the second favourite for the election after Paris, but intense lobbying by the London bid team at the later stages of the bidding process swung the votes in their favour.<ref name="CNN"/>
On [[July 7]], [[2005]], the victory celebrations were marred by the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|terrorist attacks]] on London's public transport system. This prompted immediate fears concerning the security of the 2012 Games, to which the IOC and British officials reacted in a reassuring way.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1120759363 |title=London Terrorist Attack Won’t Affect Host City Status Says IOC – Celebration Cancelled |publisher=GamesBids |date=[[2005-07-07]] |accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1120936727 |title=London Will Stage Safe And Secure Games Says Sports Minister |publisher=GamesBids |date=[[2005-07-09]] |accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref>

New York City was selected over [[San Francisco]] during the United States internal bid competition in 2002. The "Olympic X" plan was the main concept proposed by the bid team: two primary transportation lines would string together the several Olympic venue clusters in [[Manhattan]], [[Queens]], [[Brooklyn]], and even [[East Rutherford]], [[New Jersey]]; an 8,550-room Olympic Village would be located at the lines' intersection.<ref name="NYReport">{{cite book |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_949.pdf |title=Report of the IOC Evaluation Commission for the Games of the XXX Olympiad in 2012 - New York |publisher=International Olympic Committee |date=[[2005-06-06]] |accessdate=2007-03-30 |format=PDF}}</ref> Within the clusters, existing sites such as [[Madison Square Garden]], [[Yankee Stadium]], [[Central Park]], [[USTA National Tennis Center]], and [[Giants Stadium]] and [[Continental Airlines Arena]] ([[Meadowlands Sports Complex]]), would stand next to new venues, like the Queensbridge Athletic Center, Greenbelt Equestrian Center and the [[Flushing Meadows]] Regatta Center.<ref name="NYvenues">{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/summer/2004-05-18-nyc-venues_x.htm |title=Home improvements |last=Lieber |first=Jill |date=[[2004-05-18]] |publisher=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref> The city assured plentiful accommodation and possessed a high-level hosting experience, and the city's ability to market itself throughout the world, was seen as one of its strongest aspects.<ref name="NYReport"/> The bid was dealt a setback when [[New York State]] authorities refused to approve the construction of the [[West Side Stadium]], the plan's main venue, hampering the bid's chances in the short-run.<ref name="BBC New York">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics_2004/olympics_2012/3092947.stm |title=Rivals for 2012: New York |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2005-06-08]] |accessdate=2007-03-31}}</ref> The city's bid was revived when it announced an agreement to construct a new stadium ([[Citi Field]]), which was billed as the potential primary venue for the ceremonies and athletics.<ref name="BBC New York"/> New York City was never seen as a front-runner, and its chances for getting the Games were hurt after [[Canada]] secured the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].{{Ref_label|C|c|none}}

===Moscow===
{{main|Moscow 2012 Olympic bid}}

[[Image:Moscow2012 adbanner.jpg|thumb|Building near [[Arbat Square]] covered with a Moscow 2012 Olympic bid ad.]]

Moscow's plan for the 2012 Olympics were to be built upon the legacy created by the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]. It called for every single competition to be staged in sports venues within the city limits and in clustered areas around the [[Moscow River]], which would have made it one of the "most compact Games ever" according to the bid's head [[Valery Shantsev]].<ref name="BBC Moscow">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/3071399.stm |title=Rivals for 2012: Moscow |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2005-06-08]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> All existing venues would have been extensively renovated and new venues were to be constructed and tested in time for the Olympics.<ref name="MoscowReport">{{cite book |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_950.pdf |title=Report of the IOC Evaluation Commission for the Games of the XXX Olympiad in 2012 - Moscow |publisher=International Olympic Committee |date=[[2005-06-06]] |accessdate=2007-03-30 |format=PDF}}</ref> The centrepiece and core of the city's Olympic bid was the new, modern Olympic Village, that would be constructed on one of the river banks.<ref name="MoscowReport"/> Despite a high support from the city and national population, plus an extended hosting experience, Moscow suffered from insufficient accommodation and an old transport system which may not have been able to cope with the expected traffic during the Olympics.<ref name="MoscowReport"/>

==Controversies==
===Tony Blair's Olympic pitch===
In December 2003, the British prime minister [[Tony Blair]] spoke about the London bid during a "sports breakfast" he hosted during a summit in Nigeria.<ref name="OlympicPitch">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics_2004/olympics_2012/3340169.stm |title=Blair denies 'Olympic pitch' |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2003-12-22]] |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Blair mentioned the bid in context of the positive legacy of the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in Manchester: "It was partly the success of the Commonwealth Games that inspired our bid for the Olympics."<ref name="OlympicPitch"/> Since the IOC expressly forbids any international promotion of bids before the final candidature phase, it wrote to leading British officials asking for an explanation concerning the alleged violation.<ref name="OlympicPitch"/> The chairmen of the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] and the [[British Olympic Association]], and spokesmen from [[Downing Street]] and London 2012 denied any violation of the IOC's ethical code, insisting that Blair's comments were taken out of context as there was no intention to promote the bid.<ref name="OlympicPitch"/> Nevertheless, to prevent future ethical clashes, [[barrister]] [[Michael Beloff]] was appointed the ethics commissioner for the London bid two months later.<ref name="Beloff">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/3455573.stm |title=London appoints ethics tsar |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2004-02-03]] |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>

===Ivan Slavkov corruption scandal===
On [[August 4]], [[2004]], [[BBC]]'s ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' broadcast the results of a year-long investigation in which the reporters posed as consultants from a fictitious firm "New London Ventures", which was supposed to represent businesses interested in bringing the 2012 Olympics to London. The report unveiled how some Olympic agents could guarantee votes from certain IOC members to the London bid, in exchange for favours or money.<ref name="BBC BuyingGames">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/4649677.stm |title=Buying the Games |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=[[2005-07-06]] |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> The undercover team secretly filmed its encounter with one of these agents, Goran Takac, who presented them to [[Ivan Slavkov]], an IOC member and the [[Bulgarian Olympic Committee]]'s president.<ref name="BBC BuyingGames"/> Slavkov stated he was open to negotiation since he had not made up his mind about which 2012 candidate city would get his vote.<ref name="BBC Slavkov">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/4652861.stm |title=The case against Slavkov |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=[[2005-07-06]] |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Takac mentioned that Slavkov's position on the IOC was an advantage to bypass the rigid rules concerning meetings with other members, and that Slavkov's services fee was included on the initial figures given to the reporters.<ref name="BBC Slavkov"/>

In the days leading to the programme's broadcast, the IOC Ethics Commission launched an enquiry to investigate the accusations made in the documentary.<ref name="BBC IOCenquiry">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/3938619.stm |title=Olympic votes 'up for sale' |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2004-07-30]] |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Even though the ''Panorama'' reporters clearly stated that the London bid was nowhere associated with the investigation, the bid officials made further statements claiming the team had no knowledge and involvement, hoping to distance themselves from the scandal: "What I have to make clear is that London 2012 knew nothing about this—we have nothing to hide," said [[Alan Pascoe]], a London 2012 vice chairman, committing to "do everything we can to co-operate [with the IOC enquiry] and take this story off the running order".<ref name="BBC IOCenquiry"/> [[Sebastian Coe]], also a vice chairman at the time, reaffirmed Pascoe's words and assured "London 2012 has acted properly and ethically throughout the bidding process."<ref name="BBC IOCenquiry"/> After watching the documentary, IOC members and officials cleared London 2012 of any wrong-doing.<ref name="ChinaDaily">{{cite news |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/13/content_365058.htm |title=IOC clears London group of bid corruption |date=[[2004-08-13]] |publisher=[[China Daily]] |accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref>

Following the broadcast, the IOC provisionally suspended Ivan Slavkov and forbade him from attending the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].<ref name="BBC BuyingGames"/> Jacques Rogge claimed he was "an angry man because some people are not playing by the rules," underlining that "Under my leadership, I can stress there is zero tolerance for unethical behaviour".<ref name="BBC BuyingGames"/> An IOC Ethics Commission report released on [[October 25]], [[2004]] condemned Slavkov and backed the veracity of the BBC's investigation: "the complete recording of the meeting between Mr Slavkov and the two journalists reveals that: &hellip;at no time and in no way did Mr Slavkov object to this discussion of the terms of a contract to secure a candidate city the votes of IOC members whom he and Mr Takac were likely to be able to influence".<ref name="BBC Slavkov"/><ref name="EthicsSlavkov">{{cite book |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_912.pdf |title=IOC Ethics Commission: Decision with recommendations |publisher=International Olympic Committee |date=[[2004-10-25]] |accessdate=2007-04-05 |format=PDF}}</ref> Knowing about the accusation, Slavkov argued that he attended the meeting with the purpose of trying to frame the supposed corrupters,<ref name="BBC BuyingGames"/> however the Ethics Commission report further stated that "at no point does it emerge from the meeting that Mr Slavkov's sole intention was to catch in the act these corrupters of IOC members."<ref name="BBC Slavkov"/> It goes on to say that Slavkov received "no mandate to 'find the real roots of corruption'" and that he was to profit monetarily from Takac's services.<ref name="BBC Slavkov"/> The report concluded: <blockquote>
"Mr Slavkov tarnished the honour and reputation of the Olympic Movement and the IOC&hellip; Indeed, an IOC member's involvement in this 'negotiation' lent credibility to the hypothesis advanced by the journalists that there were within the IOC members and agents who could corrupt other IOC members."<ref name="BBC Slavkov"/>
</blockquote>

On [[July 7]], [[2005]], during the 117th IOC Session, Ivan Slavkov was expelled from the organisation following an 84–12 voting by the IOC members.<ref name="Slavkov expelled">{{cite news |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/olympic_news/full_story_uk.asp?id=1415 |title=SINGAPORE 2005: Session Receives Reports |publisher=International Olympic Committee |date=[[2005-07-07]] |accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref>

===French recriminations following vote===
The Paris delegation, led by [[Bertrand Delanoë]], argued that Tony Blair and the London delegation had broken the IOC rules. On [[July 11]], [[2005]], Delanoë stated: "They have not respected the rules established by the International Olympic Committee. I do not say that they were flirting with the yellow line, I say that they crossed the yellow line".<ref name="wrongf">{{cite news |url=http://www.lexpansion.com/art/134.0.133407.0.html |title=JO 2012: Delanoë relance la polémique |publisher=L'Expansion |accessdate=2005-07-11 |date=[[2005-07-11]] |language=French}}</ref><ref name="wrongf2">{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1121098753 |title=London’s Bid Breached Rules Said Paris Mayor – Blair Spokesman Calls It "Fair" |publisher=GamesBids |date=[[2005-07-11]] |accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref> A controversial move by the London bid team was its initiative to offer incentive packages for participating athletes, which included free flights, food, vouchers for long-distance calling and other financial accommodations. Immediately after announcing the initiative, London withdrew it, most likely as a result of Jacques Rogge raising concerns over its potential to start a "bidding war".<ref name="LondonIncentives">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4475017.stm |title=London withdraws 2012 incentives |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2005-04-23]] |accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref> Paris also claimed that the lobbying by Tony Blair was illegal, an accusation that was strongly denied by Downing Street.<ref name="wrongf2"/> It was not until [[August 4]], [[2005]] that Jacques Rogge suppressed any further controversies by saying in a statement: "I made it very clear that, in my opinion, the competition was fair. It was conducted according to the rules that we have set out".<ref name="wrongg">{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1123175331 |title=Rogge Calls 2012 Host City Competition "Fair" |publisher=GamesBids |accessdate=2005-08-04 |date=[[2005-08-04]]}}</ref> Delanoë's comments were criticised by Parisian political leaders; Claude Goasguen, president of the [[UMP]] Party, stated: "One cannot make such type of accusations without delivering any proof".<ref name="wrongf"/> 

Even before the election, tensions grew between the French and British delegations, already in Singapore. The Paris bid team considered submitting a complaint against London bid consultants Jim Sloman and Rod Sheard after they stated that the [[Stade de France]] was not adequate for athletics, an action that goes against the IOC rules which forbid any bid to make statements about a rival bid.<ref name="wrongh">{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1120494836 |title=IOC President Steps In To Diffuse Potential Dispute |publisher=GamesBids |date=[[2005-07-04]] |accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref> The London team promptly denied that the two men were under contract with the bid at that time, and underlined that their opinions did not reflect the views of the London bid.<ref name="wrongh"/>

===Mistaken voting controversy===
On [[December 23]], [[2005]], Alex Gilady, an [[Israel]]i IOC member and a member of the IOC's London 2012 Co-ordination Commission, suggested that Madrid should have tied for second spot with Paris in the third round of voting, but did not do so because [[Greece|Greek]] member Lambis Nikolaou pressed the wrong button.<ref name="wrongi">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4553116.stm |title='Voting error' gave London Games |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2005-12-23 |date=[[2005-12-23]]}}</ref> He further postulated that if this had happened, Madrid would have beaten Paris in the resulting runoff ballot for second place, and gone on to beat London in the final round.<ref name="wrongi"/> However, Craig Reedie, a British IOC member, dismissed these words, commenting that a claim "that an unnamed member 'might' have done something which 'might' have brought about something else which 'might' have brought about a different result is 'the kind of tittle-tattle that happens after many an IOC vote'."<ref name="wrongi"/>

By the end of 2005, Lambis Nikolaou denied Gilady's claims: "All speculations regarding my role in the third round of candidate cities for 2012 are completely unfounded. I declare that I did not vote during the third round as I had announced during the election in question."<ref name="wrongj">{{cite news |url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/news/newswire.php/news/reuters/2005/12/28/topnews/iocmemberdeniesvotingblunder.html |title=IOC member denies voting blunder |publisher=Reuters, Tiscali |accessdate=2005-12-28 |date=[[2005-12-28]]}}</ref> This statement was confirmed by the IOC voting numbers,<ref name="IOCLambis">{{cite news |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/events/117_session/full_story_uk.asp?id=1591 |title=IOC Reiterates Voting Details For Host City Of The XXX Olympiad |publisher=International Olympic Committee |date=[[2005-12-27]] |accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref> which demonstrate that, even if Nikolaou had voted for Madrid, the city would have failed to beat Paris in the third voting round. Gilady later apologised by letter to Nikolaou, denying that he had mentioned Nikolaou's name.<ref name="wrongj"/>

==Potential applicant cities==
Besides the initial nine applicant cities, other cities also wished to bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but the bids were not internally selected by the NOC (in case of more than one bidding city from the same country), were not put forward to the IOC, or were withdrawn before filing the necessary paperwork.<ref name="Gamesbids2012">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/bids/2012.shtml |title=2012 Summer Olympic Games Bids |accessdate=2007-03-06 |publisher=GamesBids}}</ref>

In [[Canada]], [[Toronto]] initially planned to gain hosting rights for 2012 after losing the [[2008 Summer Olympics bids|2008 Olympics bidding process]], but because Vancouver landed the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], the Canadian city cancelled these plans.<ref name="Canadabids">{{cite news |url=http://evalu8.org/staticpage?page=review&siteid=2833 |title=Already with the Whining and Sour-Grapes: 'Toronto's hopes dashed' |publisher=[[The Globe & Mail]] |date=[[2003-07-02]] |last=Lawlor |first=Allison |accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref> In the United States, the city of New York was picked by the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) over [[San Francisco]],<ref name="USAbids">{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=5&id=1036282899 |title=New York Wins USOC Nomination For 2012 Olympic Bid |publisher=GamesBids |date=[[2002-11-02]] |accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref> although  several other cities submitted candidatures to become the American candidate for the 2012 Olympics; these included [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Washington, D.C.]] (in cooperation with nearby [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]), [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] (in cooperation with nearby [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]).<ref name="USAbids2">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/bids/usa.shtml |title=New York City 2012 Summer Olympic Games Bid |publisher=GamesBids |accessdate=2007-03-25}}</ref> Several European cities wanted to follow the likes of London, Madrid, Moscow and Paris, and were thus hopeful to gain their NOC's support.
