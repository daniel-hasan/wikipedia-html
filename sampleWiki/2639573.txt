The {{nihongo|'''Sega Mega Drive'''|メガドライブ|Mega Doraibu}} is a [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit]] [[video game console]] released by [[Sega]] in [[Japan]] in [[1988]], [[North America]] in [[1989]], and the [[PAL region]] in [[1990]]. It was sold under the name '''Sega Genesis''' in North America as Sega was unable to secure legal rights to the Mega Drive name in that region.

The Mega Drive was the successor to the [[Sega Master System]] and was Sega's third home console and second to be sold outside of Japan.

The Mega Drive is part of the [[History of video games (Fourth generation era)|fourth generation era]] of consoles, and the first of its generation to achieve notable market share in Europe and North America. It was the direct competitor of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], although the Sega Mega Drive was released two years earlier. The Sega Mega Drive began production in Japan in 1988 and ended with the last new game being released in 2002 in Brazil.

== History ==
Although the [[Sega Master System]] had proved a success in [[Brazil]] and [[Europe]], it failed to ignite much interest in the North American or Japanese markets, which, by the mid-to-late [[1980s]], were both dominated by [[Nintendo]]'s large market shares.<ref name="MarketShare1988">{{cite book | title=Nintendo Official Magazine - Nintendo's Market Share 1988| last=Nintendo Official Magazine Staff|date=2001| pages=35| publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref><ref name="MarketShare1990">{{cite book | title=Business Week - Nintendo's Market Share 1990| last=Business Week staff|date=1999| pages=60}}</ref> Meanwhile in the arcades, the [[Sega System 16]] became a success. [[Hayao Nakayama]], Sega's [[CEO]] at the time, decided to make its new home system utilize a similar 16-bit architecture.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} The final design was eventually also used in the [[Mega-Tech]], Mega-Play and System-C arcade machines. Any game made for the Mega Drive hardware could easily be [[porting|ported]] to these systems.<ref name="ArcadePorting">{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitpress.com/faq/megadrive.htm|title=Sega Mega Drive FAQ|accessdate=2007-10-18|year=1999|author=Foulger, C.|work=http://www.digitpress.com}}</ref><ref name="ArcadePorting2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetdreamcast.com/about/sega/#3|title=Sega History|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Planet Dreamcast staff|work=http://www.planetdreamcast.com}}</ref>

The first name Sega considered for its console was the MK-1601, but it ultimately decided to call it the "Sega Mega Drive". Sega used the name Mega Drive for the Japanese, European, Asian, Australian and Brazilian versions of the console. The North American version went by the name "Genesis" due to a trademark dispute,<ref>{{cite web |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |url=http://www.sega-16.com/Retroinspection-%20Mega%20Drive.php |title=Retroinspection: Mega Drive |date=[[2006-09-12]] |publisher=Sega-16 (Reprinted from [[Retro Gamer|Retro Gamer Magazine]] (27)) |accessdate=2007-11-08}}<!-- If someone has Retro Gamer #27, feel free to replace this with a cite of the magazine: {{cite magazine |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2006 |month=July? |title=Retroinspection: Sega Mega Drive |journal=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=27 |pages=??–?? |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |location=??? |url=http://www.sega-16.com/Retroinspection-%20Mega%20Drive.php |accessdate=2007-11-08}} --></ref> while the South Korean versions were called Super Gam*Boy (수퍼겜보이) and Super Aladdin Boy ([[Transliteration|transliterated]] from 수퍼알라딘보이; this was the Korean version of the Mega Drive 2). The Korean consoles were licensed and distributed by [[Samsung Electronics]].

===Launch===
The Mega Drive was released in [[Japan]] on [[October 29]] [[1988]] for ¥21,000,<ref name="ConsoleInfo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consoledatabase.com/consoleinfo/segamegadrive/index.html|title=Sega Mega Drive/Genesis Console Information|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Console Database Staff|work=http://www.consoledatabase.com}}</ref> almost exactly a year after the [[Nippon Electric Corporation|NEC]] [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]]. Although this initially caused slow sales, the Mega Drive soon eclipsed the earlier machine in popularity and sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/111822.shtml |title=The 10 Worst-Selling Consoles of All Time |author=Blake Snow |publisher=GamePro.com |date=[[2007-05-04]] |accessdate=2007-05-28}}</ref>

In 1987, Sega announced a North American release date for the system (under the name of Sega Genesis) of [[January 9]] [[1989]],<ref name="GenesisRelease">{{cite book | title=Mega Drive Release Date| last=Sheff, David|date=1993| pages=352}}</ref> making it the second console to feature a 16-bit CPU (the first one being the [[Mattel Intellivision]]) and the first to feature single-instruction 32-bit arithmetic. Sega was not able to meet the initial release date and [[United States|U.S.]] sales began on [[August 14]], [[1989]] in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]]<ref>Steven L. Kent,  ''The Ultimate History of Video Games'', p. 404.</ref> with a suggested retail price of [[United States Dollar|US$]]200 at launch. The Genesis was released in the rest of North America on [[September 15]] of the same year with the price reduced slightly to $190.

====Europe====
The European release was on [[30 November]] [[1990]]. In the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland]] it was priced at £189.99. The first UK shipment of 30,000 units was sold at retailers [[Comet Group plc|Comet]], [[Dixons (UK)|Dixons]], [[Rumbelows]] and [[Toys "R" Us]].<ref>Foulger, C. (2000). [http://www.angelfire.com/ny/dezmoowu/Sega/megadrive.txt Sega Mega Drive Frequently Asked Questions], version 2.2.</ref>

Following on from the European success of the [[Sega Master System]], the Mega Drive became a very popular console in Europe.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Unlike in other regions where the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] had been the dominant platform, instead the [[Sega Master System]] was the most popular console in Europe at the time,{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Sega's marketing strategy was not aimed at direct competition with Nintendo's aging machine.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} In the United Kingdom the most well known of Sega's advertising slogans was "To be this good takes AGES, to be this good takes SEGA". Some of these adverts employed adult humour and innuendo with sentences like "The more you play with it, the harder it gets" displayed with an illustration of the waggling of a joystick.<ref name="SegaVizAds">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukresistance.co.uk/2006/03/segas-bizarre-early-1990s-viz-adverts.html|title=SEGA'S BIZARRE EARLY 1990S VIZ ADVERTS|accessdate=2007-10-20|year=2006|work=http://www.ukresistance.co.uk}}</ref> A prominent figure in the European marketing was the "Sega Pirate". This character was a talking one-eyed skull that starred in many TV adverts with a generally aggressive and humorous attitude.

[[Image:MD Sonic the Hedgehog.png|thumb|right|200px|A typical in-game screenshot of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)|Sonic The Hedgehog]]'', taken from its first [[level (video games)|level]], Green Hill Zone (Act 1).]]
The relatively late release of the Mega Drive in Europe assured a strong launch line-up in comparison with other regions. The arcade ports of classics like ''[[Altered Beast]]'', ''[[Golden Axe]]'' and ''[[Ghouls 'n Ghosts]]'', available in stores at launch, provided a strong image of the console's power when compared to other home conversions of these games.<ref name="MegaDriveLaunch">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vc-reviews.com/news/60/hardware-focus-sega-megadrive-genesis.php|title=Hardware Focus - Sega Megadrive / Genesis|accessdate=2007-10-19|year=2007|author=McFerran, Damien |work=http://www.vc-reviews.com}}</ref> The arrival of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' in 1991 was just as successful as in North America, with the new Sega mascot becoming popular throughout the continent.<ref name="MegaDriveLaunch">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vc-reviews.com/news/60/hardware-focus-sega-megadrive-genesis.php|title=Hardware Focus - Sega Megadrive / Genesis|accessdate=2007-10-19|year=2007|author=McFerran, Damien |work=http://www.vc-reviews.com}}</ref>

====Brazil====
The Mega Drive was released by [[Tec Toy]] in 1990, only a year after the Brazilian release of the [[Sega Master System]].

Tec Toy also released the internet service [[Sega Meganet|Mega Net]], and made exclusive games including a port of ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]''.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/duke-nukem-3d | title = Moby Game Duke Nukem page | accessdate = 2006-09-24 }}</ref> The Mega Drive is still manufactured in Brazil, with many games built into the console.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://asp.tectoy.com.br/videogame/mega/jogos71jogos.asp | title = Tec Toy | accessdate = 2006-09-24 }}</ref> The last Brazilian title released was Show do Milhão Volume 2, in 2002.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

===Console Wars===
The Sega Mega Drive initially competed against the aging 8-bit [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], over which it had superior graphics and sound. Nonetheless, it had a hard time overcoming Nintendo's ubiquitous presence in the consumer's home and the huge catalog of popular games already available for the machine.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} Sega forced the theoretically competitive [[TurboGrafx-16]] system into relative obscurity, thanks in part to [[NEC Corporation|NEC's]] poor [[North America]]n marketing campaign.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} However, after the release of the PC-Engine CD add-on and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Super Famicom]], the Mega Drive soon lost ground. The Mega Drive was not as popular as the two aforementioned systems in Japan.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

In an attempt to build itself a significant consumer base, Sega decided to focus on slightly older buyers, especially young men in their late teens and early 20s who would have more disposable income and who were eager for more "grown-up" titles with more mature content and/or more in-depth game play.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

[[Image:SegaGenesis-NintendontAd.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sega advertisement for "Genesis does what Nintendon't" campaign featuring [[After Burner II]] and [[Super Monaco GP]]]]
One of Sega's most famous advertisements in North American media was its [[slogan]] "Genesis does what Nintendon't",<ref name="wired">{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/05/gallery_game_history?slide=22 |title=Console Portraits: A 40-Year Pictorial History of Gaming |accessdate=2007-09-08 |author=Greg Orlando |date=[[2007-05-15]] |publisher=[[Wired News]]}}</ref><ref name="forsyard"/> which showcased the graphics advantage that the Genesis held against the aging NES.

To compete with the release of the Super NES in the US, Sega promoted the console with "[[Blast Processing]]", a term coined by Sega because the Genesis' 68000 processor had a higher clock speed than the [[SNES]]. Eventually, Nintendo's 16-bit SNES became the Mega Drive's main rival, though the Mega Drive had a head start in terms of user base and number of games, reversing the problem Sega had faced against the NES. The Genesis continued to hold on to a healthy fan base composed significantly of action and sports games fans.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} The release of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' in 1991 began to threaten Nintendo's stranglehold on the US console market. ''Sonic'' was released to replace former mascot [[Alex Kidd]], and to provide the "[[killer application|killer app]]" that Sega needed.<ref name="ConsoleInfo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consoledatabase.com/consoleinfo/segamegadrive/index.html|title=Sega Mega Drive/Genesis Console Information|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Console Database Staff|work=http://www.consoledatabase.com}}</ref> This sparked what became one of the greatest [[console wars]] in video gaming history.

[[Image:Sega Pirate.png|thumb|right|The Sega Pirate, a popular marketing icon for the console in Europe]]
The console did not have a major competitor in Europe until the launch of the [[Super Nintendo|SNES]] in 1992. But unlike in North America, Nintendo's 16-bit console did not outsell the Mega Drive, even with the release of the [[Rare (company)|British-made]] ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' in 1994. The market share in Europe was always favorable to Sega, which enjoyed a strong position until withdrawing from the 16-bit market.

===The 32-bit era and beyond===
Aside from the release of the [[Sega Mega-CD|Mega-CD]] (Sega CD in North America) and [[Sega 32X|32X]] add-ons for the Mega Drive, Sega's last big announcement came in the form of a partnership with Time Warner in the [[United States|U.S.]] to offer a subscription-based service called [[Sega Channel]] that would allow subscribers to "download" games on a month-by-month basis.

The poor performances of the Mega-CD and 32X, a lack of effective advertising, and disputes between [[Sega|Sega of America]] and [[Sega of Japan]] had taken their toll on the company.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} By mid 1994, Sega's market share had dropped from 65% to 46%,{{Fact|date=October 2007}} and the official announcements of newer, more powerful consoles, such as the [[Sega Saturn]], [[Sony PlayStation|PlayStation]], and [[Nintendo 64]] signaled that the 16-bit era was drawing to a close.

The last commercial licensed release in North America was ''[[Frogger]]'', released by [[Majesco]] in 1998.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

The Mega Drive was supported until 1996 in Europe until Sega announced they were dropping support for it.<ref name="ConsoleInfo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consoledatabase.com/consoleinfo/segamegadrive/index.html|title=Sega Mega Drive/Genesis Console Information|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Console Database Staff|work=http://www.consoledatabase.com}}</ref> It was discontinued along with its predecessor, the successful and long-lived Sega Master System, to allow Sega to concentrate on their next console, the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]]. The Mega Drive's add-ons, the [[Mega CD]] and [[32x]], were also both discontinued at this point, having been the same general failures they were in the other regions. The last commercial licensed release in Europe was ''[[FIFA '98: Road To World Cup]]'', released by [[Electronic Arts]] in November 1997.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} In the UK the last stocks of the Mega Drive II were sold by the end of 1999, [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] selling it with one controller and Mega Games 6 for £24.99.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

On [[May 22]], [[2006]], [[Super Fighter Team]] released ''[[Beggar Prince]]'', a game translated from a [[1996 in video gaming|1996]] [[Taiwanese language|Taiwanese]] original. It is the first commercial Sega Mega Drive game since 1998 in the North American market. It was released worldwide.

== Emulation ==

In recent years, there has been some revival of interest in the Mega Drive, led largely by the [[grey market]] trade in both unlicensed cartridges and dumped [[Read-only memory|ROMs]], which are played through [[emulator]]s such as [[Kega Fusion]], [[GENS]], or [[Genecyst]]. There is also a trend towards home programming, using the [[Personal computer|PC]]-based [[SGCC]]. One example is Tavern RPG, a game stated for release on both the Mega Drive and its CD add-on in 2008 [http://tavernrpg.genny4ever.net/].

In 2004, there came a trend toward plug-and-play [[TV game]]s, and [[Radica Games]] released licensed, self-contained versions of the Sega Mega Drive in both North America (as the Play TV Legends Sega Genesis)<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.radicagames.com/playtv-legends-sega-genesis.php | title = Play TV Legends Sega Genesis - Radica Games| accessdate = 2006-09-24 }}</ref> and Europe (as the Sega Mega Drive 6-in-1 Plug 'n' Play), which contain six popular games in a small Genesis-shaped control box, with a permanently connected control pad. It does not have a cartridge slot, and thus is a [[dedicated console]].<ref name="6in1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesdog.co.uk/reviews/review.phtml/604/1628/sega-mega-drive-6-in-1-retro.phtml|title=Sega Mega Drive 6-in-1 Plug and play Review|accessdate=2007-10-19|author=Miles, Stuart|work=http://www.gamesdog.co.uk}}</ref>

The [[GameTap]] subscription gaming service includes a Genesis emulator, and has several dozen licensed Genesis games in its catalog.<ref name="GameTapCatalogue">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gametap.com/home/play/browse/browseCatalog|title=GameTap Catalogue|accessdate=2007-10-19|work=http://www.gametap.com}}</ref><P>The [[Console Classix]] subscription gaming service also includes a Genesis emulator, and has several hundred Genesis games in its catalog.<P>

In 2006 was released the [[Sega Genesis Collection]] for [[PlayStation Portable]] that consists a original compilation of 28 games.

During his keynote speech at the 2006 Game Developers Conference, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata announced that Sega will make a number of Mega Drive titles available to download on the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]]. These games are now available along with other systems' titles under the Wii's [[Virtual Console]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.gamespot.com/news/6146528.html|title=GDC 06: Revolution to play Genesis, TurboGrafx-16 games|author=Tor Thorsen| publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2007-10-18}}</ref> The 16-bit Sega selections available on the Virtual Console at launch were ''[[Altered Beast]]'', ''[[Columns (video game)|Columns]]'', ''[[Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine]]'', ''[[Ecco the Dolphin]]'', ''[[Golden Axe]]'', ''[[Gunstar Heroes]]'', ''[[Ristar]]'', and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Each title costs 800 Wii Points (US$8) except in Japan, where they are 600 Points (¥600).

At Tokyo Game Show on [[September 21]], [[2006]], [[Ken Kutaragi]], President and CEO of [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], announced that Sega Mega Drive game ports would be available on the [[PlayStation Network]] (network service for the [[Playstation 3]]).<ref name="KutaragiKeynote">{{Cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6158144.html|title=TGS 06: Kutaragi talks PS3 at keynote|accessdate=2007-10-19|year=2006|author=Shoemaker, Brad|work=http://uk.gamespot.com}}</ref> No specific titles or price points have been confirmed as of yet, with Kutagari simply stating that these specifics will be discussed with individual publishers. This, however, was later contradicted by SEGA Japan when a short statement was issued stating "that such claims are not correct at this point".<ref> {{ cite web | url = http://www.worthplaying.com/article.php?sid=37344&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 | title = SEGA Denies Genesis support for PS3 - WORTHPLAYING| accessdate = 2006-09-23 }}</ref>

==Master System compatibility==
[[Image:genesis power base.png|thumb|200px|right|Sega Power Base Converter]]
One of the key design features of the console is its [[backwards compatibility]] with Sega's previous console, the [[Sega Master System]]. The 16-bit design was based upon the 8-bit design, albeit enhanced and extended in many areas. In order to achieve backwards compatibility, the Master System's central processor and sound chip (the [[Zilog Z80]] and SN76489 respectively) were included in the Mega Drive, and the Mega Drive's Video Display Processor (VDP) was capable of the Master System's VDP's mode 4 (though it cannot run in modes 0, 1, 2, or 3).

As the cartridge slot was of a different shape, Sega released the Power Base Converter, a separate device that sits between a Master System cartridge and the Mega Drive's cartridge slot. The Power Base Converter does not contain any SMS components, instead functioning as a pass-through device. The converter contains a top slot for cartridge-based games along with a front slot for card based games. When a Master System game is inserted, the system puts the Z80 in control, leaving the Mega Drive's main 68000 processor idle.

Both 2-button Master System pads and standard Mega Drive pads can be used to play Master System games, although due to slight differences in how the pads operate, some Master System games inadvertently cause the wrong set of inputs to be selected in a Mega Drive pad, preventing input from working correctly and necessitating the use of a Master System controller. The "pause" function, as with on the Master System itself, is not available from the controller but is accessed by a button on the Power Base Converter.

In Japan the device is known as the "Mega Adapter". The PAL variant is called the "Master System Converter" in mainland Europe.<ref name="MegaAdapter">{{Cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=2&c=843|title=Mega Drive II|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Old-Computers.com Staff|work=http://www.old-computers.com}}</ref>

The Power Base Converter is not fully compatible with the redesigned Mega Drive 2. A second version, the "Master System Converter II", was released to address this problem. This second version adapter was produced in far fewer quantities and only released in Europe.

The only game which does not work with this device is ''[[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]'', because it uses all 50 pins across the card edge connector, and the Power Base Converter does not address all of them.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

==Peripherals==

[[Image:Genesis controller.png|thumb|right|Original Genesis Controller]]
[[Image:Sega-Mega-Drive-controllers.jpg|thumb|right|Original three button joypad with later six button version]]

The standard Mega Drive controller features three main buttons and a "start" button usually used for pausing mid-game. The controller itself had a distinctive rounded shape. Sega later released a six-button version which was slightly smaller and featured, as well as three more face buttons, a "mode" button to allow the controller to work with certain older games which it would otherwise be incompatible with. An [[infra-red]] wireless version of the six-button controller was also released.

====Mega CD====
{{mainarticle|Sega Mega CD}}
The [[Sega Mega-CD]] became available in 1991, 1992 and 1993 in Japan, North America and Europe respectively.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} It plugs into the side of the Mega Drive and provides access to CD games as well as allowing the user to play music CDs and [[CD+G]]s.

====32X====
{{mainarticle|Sega 32X}}
The [[Sega 32X]] allows the user to play technically superior 32-bit games on the Mega Drive. It was released in [[1994]] in Japan and North America and [[1995]] in Europe. The 32X plugs into the Mega Drive's cartridge slot and the game cartridges are then plugged into the 32X.

====Other peripherals====
A number of other peripherals for the Mega Drive were released that added extra functionality. The [[Menacer|Menacer Light Gun]] was developed in response to the [[Super Scope]] for the SNES and was only compatible with the [[Menacer 6-game cartridge]] and a few other games. The Sega Mouse and [[Sega Mega Mouse]] were also released for the Mega Drive, the latter being available in North America while the other served the Japanese and European markets. A foam-covered bat called the BatterUP and the TeeVGolf golf club were both released for the Mega Drive and SNES and provided support for similar games.<ref name="Peripherals">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vidgame.net/SEGA/peripherals.htm#15|title=Sega Genesis Peripherals|accessdate=2007-10-17|author=Vidgame.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/snes/peripherals/index.html |title=Super NES/Famicom Peripherals |publisher=[http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/ Gamers Graveyard] |accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> As well the official Mega Drive peripherals, the console was also compatible with Sega Master System accessories through use of the Power Base Converter.<ref name="PowerBase">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vidgame.net/SEGA/POWERBASE.htm|title=Sega Genesis Power Base Convertor|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Barr, Adrienne}}</ref><ref name="ConsoleInfo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consoledatabase.com/consoleinfo/segamegadrive/index.html|title=Sega Mega Drive/Genesis Console Information|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Console Database Staff|work=http://www.consoledatabase.com}}</ref>

Both [[Electronic Arts]] and Sega released [[multi-tap]]s for the system to allow more than the standard two players to play at once. Initially, EA's version, the 4-Play, and Sega's adapter, the Team Player, only supported each publisher's own titles. Later games were created to work on both adapaters.<ref name="ArcadePorting">{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitpress.com/faq/megadrive.htm|title=Sega Mega Drive FAQ|accessdate=2007-10-18|year=1999|author=Foulger, C.|work=http://www.digitpress.com}}</ref>

The Megamodem, a modem with a speed of 1,600 to 2,400 [[baud|bit/s]], could be connected to the DE-9 port on the back of the Mega Drive and used to play games online with other players. This was supported by the [[Sega Meganet]] service, a network service in Japan for people using the Sega Mega Drive. Debuting in 1991, this was the first time multiplayer console gaming was possible to a second console. However, the service was not very successful and was eventually discontinued. Plans for this service were considered in North America, with the device being renamed the Telegenesis, and was in fact advertised in several early product and accessory line-ups for the console, but these plans were also cancelled.

The game selection included ''Phantasy Star II''-based text adventures, [[Sonic Eraser]] (a Sonic the Hedgehog/[[Columns (video game)|Columns]] crossover puzzle game), and a [[Mahjong]] title. There were also small games that could be downloaded to the console. In 1995, the service was also started in Brazil. The selection of games was increased and included many titles such as ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' and ''[[Fifa series#Fifa 95|FIFA Soccer 95]]''.

Third-party accessories such as the [[Action Replay]] by [[Datel]] and the [[Game Genie]] by [[Codemasters]] were released as well as converter cartridges that allow Japanese games to be played on American or European machines.

==Variations==
{{main article|Variations of the Sega Mega Drive}}
[[Image:Console-wondermega.jpg|thumb|Sega Wondermega incorporates the Mega Drive and Mega CD in one unit]]

The Mega Drive and Genesis quite possibly received more officially licensed variations than any other console. While only one major design revision of the console was created during its lifespan, each region has its own peculiarities and unique items, while other variations were exercises in reducing costs (such as the removal of the little-used 9-pin EXT. port) or expanding the capabilities of the Mega Drive.

Contrary to popular belief,{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Model MK-1631 (Mega Drive/Genesis 2) ''does'' have a Z80 CPU.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Depending on the board revision, the system has either a Zilog Z84C00 or a Custom Sega 315-5676 or similar. Because the Z80 is used for sound production by many games, it is a necessary component. The idea that the redesigned machine has no Z80 came from reports of incompatibility between those models and the Power Base Converter, which provides Sega Master System compatibility.

Majesco's Genesis 3 (single-chip and dual-chip versions) retains the Mode 4 support but has the Master System compatibility removed from the bus controller logic.<ref name="ConsoleInfo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consoledatabase.com/consoleinfo/segamegadrive/index.html|title=Sega Mega Drive/Genesis Console Information|accessdate=2007-10-18|author=Console Database Staff|work=http://www.consoledatabase.com}}</ref> This renders the Power Base Converter or any other adapter useless. 68000 software can still enable and use Mode 4, however.

One of the 68000's instructions, TAS, is intended for [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphore]] communication in multiprocessor machines and locks the 68000 bus during memory access.<ref name="TAS">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thule.no/haynie/systems/amiga2k/docs/tasa2k.pdf|title=A Study of the Viability of the TAS Instruction on the Zorro II Bus|accessdate=2007-10-19|year=1990|author=Haynie, Dave|work=http://www.thule.no}}</ref> The Sega hardware did not support this unusual bus cycle and ignored the write-back phase. Two games, ''[[Gargoyles (video game)|Gargoyles]]'' from Buena Vista Interactive, and ''[[Ex-Mutants (video game)|Ex-Mutants]]'' from Sega make use of the TAS instructions and expect it not to write to memory. As a result, these games work on original Sega machines but not the Majesco Genesis 3, which has correct support for TAS.

{{mainarticle|Motorola 68000}}
The Sega Mega Drive's [[CPU]] is a 16/32-bit Motorola 68000. <ref>http://www.ticalc.org/pub/text/68k/68kpm.zip|Motorola Programmers Reference Manual - Introduction says MC68000 is 16-/32-bit processor</ref> It is a 32 bit microprocessor sitting on a 16-bit-wide data bus.  Maximum addressable memory is 16 [[megabyte]]s.  The 68000 Runs at 7.61 MHz in PAL consoles, 7.67 MHz in NTSC consoles. The Mega Drive also includes a [[Zilog Z80]] as the sound CPU. The Z80 Runs at 3.55 MHz in PAL consoles, 3.58 MHz in NTSC consoles.

The VDP uses a technique called [[Direct Memory Access]] (DMA) which is a high speed technique for accessing the VRAM, CRAM and VSRAM. DMA has 3 modes of access which may be applied to [[Video RAM|VRAM]], CRAM or VSRAM. During memory to VRAM/CRAM/VSRAM DMA, the 68000 is stopped, but the Z80 will continue to run as long as it does not attempt to access the 68000 memory space.

The Mega Drive has a dedicated VDP (Video Display Processor) for playfield and [[sprite]] control. This is an improved version of the [[Sega Master System]] [[Graphics processing unit|VDP]], which in turn is derived from the [[Texas Instruments TMS9918]]. It contains both mode 4 (for Master System compatibility) and mode 5 (for native 16-bit games). However, Master System programs can switch the VDP into mode 5 and make use of advanced VDP features. This page only discusses mode 5 capabilities.

Images could be output at 256 pixels (32 tiles) or 320 pixels (40 tiles) across and 224 scanlines (28 tiles) or 240 scanlines (30 tiles) down.
The 240-line resolutions are only used on 50 Hz (i.e. [[PAL]]) displays, as the extra lines end up in the [[overscan]] of a 60 Hz ([[NTSC]]) signal.
Instead, NTSC games use the 224-line resolution to free up more [[vertical blanking]] time to send more updates to the VDP.
Colors are chosen from a total of 512 possible colors; some games used a small amount of flicker to simulate more colors. Graphics consist of up to 64 sprites on 3 [[Plane (mathematics)|planes]]. Palettes are stored in color RAM (CRAM) and consist of 16 colors each for a total of 64 colors.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

Sprites can be any combination of 8, 16, 24 and 32 by 8, 16, 24 and 32. Up to 20 sprites may be used on a single [[Scan line|line]] and each of these sprites will be on one of the 3 planes. The [[priority]] of each sprite can be changed allowing sprites on different planes to appear in a different order than the planes themselves.

Playfields, 2 of the available planes, can both be scrolled horizontally and vertically as a whole. Horizontal scrolling allows for individual character line or scan line scrolling while vertical scrolling is limited to 2 character wide columns.

There are two primary sound chips which are both controlled by the Z80; the [[Yamaha YM2612]] [[Frequency Modulation]] (FM) chip and the [[Texas Instruments SN76489]] [[Programmable Sound Generator]] (PSG) chip. The FM sound [[synthesis]] IC resembles the [[Yamaha YM2151]] (used in Sega's coin-op machines) and the chips used in Yamaha's synthesizers. There is 8 [[kilobyte]]s of dedicated sound RAM available to them.

The Yamaha uses six FM channels, four operators each and runs at 7.67 MHz (7.61MHz in PAL machines). The sixth channel can be used as a 8-bit digitized audio channel or as a regular FM channel. The use of the digitized audio allows for [[Stereophonic sound|stereo sound]] and is output only through the headphone [[Jack (connector)|jack]] on model 1 systems and through AV out on model 2 systems along with mono signal.

The SN76489 device is built into the VDP and has a four-channel PSG (Programmable Sound Generator). It has three square wave channels, one [[white noise]] channel and programmable tone/noise and attenuation. It is mainly used for Master System compatibility mode but can be used to supplement FM channels.

== Modifications ==

It is possible to overclock the Motorola 68000 CPU in some cases in excess of 300% (the current known world record is 25.4&nbsp;MHz){{Fact|date=December 2007}}, though it may not be completely stable beyond a certain point on each console.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.epicgaming.us/md_oc/howto.php guide at Epic Gaming | title = MegaDrive/Genesis Overclocking | accessdate = 2006-09-24 }}</ref> Overclocking the CPU does not speed up the games, but actually eliminates slowdown that some games are plagued by (such as Sonic 2 splitscreen). The reason for this is most games do the processing for a video frame, then wait for the vertical blank interrupt. If the processor runs faster, it simply finishes the processing for the video frame earlier, and waits for the vertical blank interrupt for a longer period of time.

Another possible modification is to replace the stock 68000 processor with a [[Motorola 68010|68010]]. Since the CPU isn't socketed, this requires the removal of the old CPU, and soldering in of the new. The 68010 is a pin-compatible enhanced version of the 68000, which is a bit more efficient internally and offers some new features. Upgrading the CPU to a 68010 does not necessarily make the games run faster, it just reduces how much they slow down in intensive situations (due to reason explained in the previous paragraph).{{Fact|date=October 2007}} Also, the DAC's digital audio output may sound cleaner and less distorted because the 68010 has a "loop mode" to run small loops faster, which may allow the Z80 to receive PCM data faster. However, the 68010 is not 100% object code-compatible with the 68000, so machines modified with a 68010 processor are not able to run certain games properly; such as Sonic 3, Sonic and Knuckles, Street Fighter II, Red Zone, and a few others. It is possible to mod the console up to a max of 13.4&nbsp;MHz.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

Other mods have been made to the console, such as switches to instantly switch between 50&nbsp;Hz and 60&nbsp;Hz, language settings, the ability to fit Japanese carts and various paint finishes.
