'''''Smallville''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American television]] series created by writer/producers [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]], and was initially broadcast by [[The WB Television Network|The WB]]. After its fifth season, the WB and [[UPN]] merged to form [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], which is the current broadcaster for the show in the [[United States]].<ref name="new CW">{{cite news|author=Jessic Seid|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/cbs_warner/index.htm|title='Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown':CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS-Warner venture beginning in September.|publisher=CNN Money|date=[[2006-01-24]]|accessdate=2007-08-19}}</ref> ''Smallville'' premiered on [[October 16]], [[2001]], and completed its sixth season on [[May 17]], [[2007]].<ref name="tvg">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=100398&more=ucepisodelist|title=Smallville Episodes <nowiki>|</nowiki> TVGuide.com|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> A [[Smallville_Season_7|seventh season]] was officially announced by The CW on [[May 16]], [[2007]],<ref>{{cite news|author=Neil Wilkes|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/a46667/smallville-supernatural-one-tree-hill-safe.html|title='Smallville', 'Supernatural', 'One Tree Hill' safe|publisher=DigitalSpy|date=[[2007-05-16]]|accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref> and premiered on [[September 27]], [[2007]].<ref name="tvg"/> It is produced in and around [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].

The plot follows the adventures of a young [[Clark Kent]]'s life in the [[fictional]] town of [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], [[Kansas]], during the years before he becomes [[Superman]]. The first four seasons focused on Clark and his friends' high school years. Since season five, the show has ventured into more adult settings, with some characters attending college. Recent seasons have seen an increase in the introductions of other [[DC Comics|DC]] comic book [[superhero]]es and [[Supervillain|villains]]. 

''Smallville'' inspired an ''[[Aquaman (TV program)|Aquaman]]'' [[spin-off]] pilot, which was not picked up by The CW network, as well as promotional tie-ins with [[Verizon]], [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]], and [[Toyota]]. In other media, the show has spawned a series of young-adult novels, a DC Comics comic book and soundtrack releases. The show broke the record for highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers tuning in for its [[Pilot (Smallville)|pilot episode]].

==Production==
===Development===
Originally, [[Tollin/Robbins Productions]] wanted to do a show about a young [[Bruce Wayne]]. The feature film division of [[Warner Bros.]] had decided to develop an origin movie for [[Batman]], and, because they didn't want to compete with a television series, had the television series idea nixed.<ref name="genesis">{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 1|year=2004|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|location=London|pages=8-17|isbn=1840237955}}</ref> In 2000, Tollin/Robbins approached Peter Roth, the President of [[Warner Bros. Television]], about developing a series based on a young Superman. That same year, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar developed a pilot based on the film ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]''. After watching the pilot, Roth approached the two men about developing a second pilot, based on the young Superman concept that was brought to him.<ref name="genesis"/> After meeting with Roth, Gough and Millar decided that they didn't want to do a series where there was lots of flying, and a cape.<ref name="genesis"/> It was here that they developed a "no tights, no flights" rule, vowing Clark would not, at any point, fly or don the suit during the run of the show.<ref name="No Flights No Tights">{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelrosenbaum.com/small.html|title=Smallville|author=Barry Garron|date=[[2001-10-15]]|publisher=MichaelRosenbaum.com|accessdate=2006-10-19}}</ref> 

Gough and Millar wanted to strip Superman down to his "bare essence", and see the reasons behind why Clark became Superman.<ref name="genesis"/> Gough and Millar felt the fact that they were not comic book fans played into their favor. Not being familiar with the universe would allow them an unbiased approach to the series. This didn't keep them from learning about the characters; they both did research on the comics and picked and rearranged what they liked.<ref name="genesis"/> They returned and pitched their idea to both the WB and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] in the same day.<ref name="metcom">{{cite video|title="Metamorphosis" commentary by Al Gough and Miles Millar|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|year=2002}}</ref> A bidding war ensued between FOX and the WB, which the WB won with a commitment of 13 episodes to start.<ref name="metcom"/>

Roth, Gough, and Millar knew the show was going to be action oriented, but they wanted to be able to reach that "middle America iconography" that ''[[7th Heaven]]'' had reached. To help create this atmosphere, the team decided the [[meteor shower]] that brings Clark to Earth would be the foundation for the franchise of the show. Not only does it act as the primary source behind the creation of the super powered beings that Clark must fight, but it acts as a sense of irony in Clark's life. The meteor shower would give him a life on Earth, but it would also take away the parents of the girl he loves, and start Lex Luthor down a dark path, thanks to the loss of his hair during the shower. Roth loved the conflict that was created for Clark, in forcing him to deal with the fact that his arrival is what caused all of this pain.<ref name="genesis"/>

Another problem the creators had to address was why Lex Luthor would be hanging out with a bunch of teenagers. They decided to create a sense of loneliness in the character of Lex Luthor, which they felt would require him to reach out to the teens.<ref name="genesis"/> The loneliness was echoed in Clark and Lana as well.<ref name="pilcom">{{cite video|title="Pilot" commentary by Al Gough, Miles Millar and David Nutter|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|year=2002}}</ref> Gough and Millar wanted to provide a parallel to the Kents, so they created Lionel Luthor, Lex's father, which they saw as the "experiment in extreme parenting".<ref name="genesis"/> Gough and Millar wanted a younger Kent couple, because they felt they needed to be able to be involved in Clark's life, and help him through his journey.<ref name="pilcom"/> [[Chloe Sullivan]], another character created just for the show, was meant to be the "outsider" the show needed. Gough and Millar felt the character was necessary so someone would notice the weird happenings in Smallville.<ref name="genesis"/> She was meant to act as a "precursor to Lois Lane".<ref name="pilcom"/>

The concept of ''Smallville'' has been described by Warner Brothers as being a reinterpretation of the Superman mythology from its roots. Recently, since the November 2004 reacquisition of [[Superboy]] by the [[Jerry Siegel|Siegels]], there has arisen contention regarding a possible [[copyright infringement]]. The dispute is over ownership of the fictional Smallville, title setting of the show, and a claimed similarity between ''Superboy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s title character and ''Smallville''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Clark Kent. The heirs of [[Jerry Siegel]] claim "Smallville is part of the Superboy copyright", of which the Siegels [[Superboy#Legal status|own the rights]].<ref name="Superboy">{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/02/superboy-copyright-faq/|title=Superboy Copyright FAQ|author=Brian Cronin|date=[[2006-08-02]]|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref>

===Filming===
[[Image:Smallville-sign1.jpg|thumb|upright|The Cloverdale welcome sign]]
The show is produced at BB Studios in [[Burnaby, British Columbia|Burnaby]]. Initially, production was going to be in [[Australia]], but Vancouver had more of a "Middle America landscape". The city provided a site for the Kent farm, as well as doubling for Metropolis. It also provided a cheaper shooting location, and was in the same time zone as [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].<ref name="genesis"/> "Main street" Smallville is at a combination of two locations. Portions were shot in the town of [[Merritt, British Columbia|Merritt]], and the rest was shot in [[Cloverdale, British Columbia|Cloverdale]].<ref name="pilcom"/> Cloverdale is particularly proud of being a filming site for the show; at its entrance is a sign which reads "Home of Smallville."

[[Vancouver Technical Secondary School|Vancouver Technical School]] doubled as the exterior for Smallville High, as the film makers believed Van Tech had the "mid-American largess" they wanted.<ref name="pilcom"/> This kept in-line with Millar's idea that Smallville should be the epitome of "Smalltown, USA".<ref name="Pilot ep">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.20-23</ref> The interiors of [[Templeton Secondary School]] were used for Smallville High's interior.<ref name="locations school/">{{cite web|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/schools/Secondaryschools/03939010/Profile/Schoolhighlights.htm|title=School Highlights - School Profile|publisher=vsb.bc.ca|accessdate=2006-10-19}}</ref> The Kent farm is a real farm located in [[Aldergrove, British Columbia|Aldergrove]].

===Music===
Most episodes feature one or more songs  by [[alternative rock]] acts. Two soundtrack albums were released, with the second following two years after the first. On [[February 25]], [[2003]], ''Smallville: The Talon Mix'' was released. ''The Talon Mix'' featured a selected group of artists that supplied music for the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00007FRWZ|title=Smallville: The Talon Mix|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon]]|accessdate=2006-10-16}}</ref> Following that release, on [[November 8]], [[2005]], ''Smallville: The Metropolis Mix'' was released.

==Season overviews==
{{main|List of Smallville episodes}}
{{see also|Smallville timeline|Powers and abilities of Superman|Kryptonite in Smallville}}

[[Smallville (season 1)|Season one]] sees the introduction of the regular cast, and storylines that regularly included a villain deriving a power from kryptonite exposure. The one-episode villains were a plot device developed by Gough and Millar. Instead of creating physical monsters, the kryptonite would enhance the personal demons of the character.<ref name="pilcom"/> To prove the show was not simply about a new kryptonite monster every week, the writers attempted to craft episodes that had nothing to do with kryptonite, like "Rogue".<ref>Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion) pp.52-55</ref> The first season primarily dealt with Clark trying to come to terms with his alien origins, and the revelation that his arrival on Earth was connected to the deaths of Lana's parents.<ref name="genesis"/> Clark develops [[X-ray vision]] this season, and, unlike his super strength and speed that he was already aware of, is forced to exercise his new ability to gain control over it.<ref>{{cite episode|title=X-Ray|series=Smallville|credits=Mark Verheiden (writer) & James Frawley (director)|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]|airdate=2001-11-06|season=1|number=4|minutes=42}}</ref>

[[Smallville (season 2)|Season two]] has fewer villain of the week episodes, focusing more on story arcs that affect each character and explore Clark's origins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=13430|title=Smallville: The Complete Second Season|accessdate=2007-09-12|author=D.J. Nock|date=[[2004-11-25]]|publisher=DVD Times}}</ref> Several key plot points include Lex becoming more entangled in conflict with his father, Chloe digging into Clark's past while dealing with Lionel, Martha and Jonathan Kent's financial troubles, and Lana and Clark's vacillating relationship though they end the season apart. The main story arc, however, focuses on Clark's discovery of his Kryptonian origins.<ref name="Rosetta ep">{{cite episode|title=Rosetta|series=Smallville|credits=Al Gough, Miles Millar (writers) & James Marshall (director)|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]|airdate=2003-02-25|season=2|number=17|minutes=42}}</ref> The disembodied voice of Clark's biological father [[Jor-El]] is introduced, communicating to Clark via his space ship, setting the stage for plots involving the fulfillment of Clark's earthly [[destiny]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Calling|series=Smallville|credits=[[Kenneth Biller]] (writer) & [[Terrence O'Hara]] (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2003-05-13|season=2|number=22|minutes=42}}</ref> [[Christopher Reeve]], who portrayed Superman in the 1970s and 1980s film series, appears as Dr. Virgil Swann to provide Welling's Clark with information regarding his heritage.<ref name="Rosetta ep"/> Season two saw the emergence of [[heat vision]],<ref>{{cite episode|title=Heat|series=Smallville|credits=Mark Verheiden (writers) & James Marshall (director)|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]|airdate=2002-10-01|season=2|number=2|minutes=42}}</ref> as well as a new form of kryptonite.

[[Smallville (season 3)|Season three]] focuses on loyalty, betrayal, and new revelations involving Jor-El. Early in the season, [[Michael McKean]], Annette O'Toole's real-life husband, portrays Clark's future ''[[Daily Planet]]'' editor [[Perry White]]; from this point on, other major characters present in the Superman mythology and the DC Universe are introduced to ''Smallville''.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Perry|series=Smallville|credits=[[Mark Verheiden]] (writer) & [[Jeannot Szwarc]] (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2003-10-29|season=3|number=5|minutes=42}}</ref> Pete Ross' inability to deal with keeping Clark's secret causes him to move to [[Wichita, Kansas]] with his mother after his parents' divorce.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Forsaken|series=Smallville|credits=[[Kelly Souders]], [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]] (writers) & Terrence O'Hara (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2004-05-12|season=3|number=21|minutes=42}}</ref> Season three introduced Clark's "super hearing", which developed when his heat vision accidentally blinded him.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Whisper|series=Smallville|credits=Ken Horton (writer) & Tom Wright (director)|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]|airdate=2004-01-21|season=3|number=10|minutes=42}}</ref> 

[[Smallville (season 4)|Season four]] ventures further into the Superman mythology by creating a story arc that runs the length of the season; it involved Clark seeking out [[The Kryptonian Crystals|three Kryptonian stones]], at the instruction of Jor-El, which contain the knowledge of the universe.<ref name="Crusade ep">{{cite episode|title=Crusade|series=Smallville|credits=Alfred Gough, Miles Millar (writers) & [[Greg Beeman]] (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2004-09-22|season=4|number=1|minutes=42}}</ref> The majority of this season revolves around Lex trying to rekindle a strained friendship with Clark, Lana dating [[Jason Teague]] ([[Jensen Ackles]]), a young man she meets in France, Clark and numerous other characters vying with one another in attempts to obtain the stones, and Lionel's ambiguous transformation into a good father and person.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Transference|series=Smallville|credits=[[Todd Slavkin]], [[Darren Swimmer]] (writers) & James Marshall (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2004-10-27|season=4|number=6|minutes=42}}</ref> This season introduced [[Lois Lane]] ([[Erica Durance]]), Chloe Sullivan's (Allison Mack) cousin, as well as [[Bart Allen]].<ref name="Crusade ep"/><ref>{{cite episode|title=Run|series=Smallville|credits=[[Steven S.

[[Smallville (season 5)|Season five]] brings in more elements of the Superman mythology, including <ref name="Reckoning ep">{{cite episode|title=Reckoning|series=Smallville|credits=Kelly Souders, Brian Peterson (writers) & Greg Beeman (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2006-01-26|season=5|number=12|minutes=42}}</ref> the [[Fortress of Solitude]],<ref name="Arrival ep">{{cite episode|title=Arrival|series=Smallville|credits=Todd Slavkin, Darren Swimmer(writers) & James Marshall (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2005-09-29|season=5|number=1|minutes=42}}</ref> the [[Phantom Zone]],<ref name="Arrival ep"/> and [[General Zod|Zod]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Vessel|series=Smallville| credits=Kelly Souders, Brian Peterson (writers) & James Marshall (director)|network=The WB|airdate=2006-05-11|season=5|number=22|minutes=42}}</ref> The villain [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], in the guise of Professor Milton Fine ([[James Marsters]]), becomes a recurring antagonist.

==Cast==
Unlike most shows, which generally get about four weeks of casting, Gough and Millar had five months.<ref name="genesis"/> In October 2000, the two producers began their search for the three lead roles, and had casting directors in ten different cities.<ref name="metcom"/> There were originally eight series regulars, but since the first season four members of the original cast were written off the show, while five new actors were hired as series regulars during the succeeding seasons.

She feels connected to Clark.<ref name="Kristin"/> Gough and Millar were initially trying to find someone for the role of Clark Kent, but Kristin Kreuk was the first to be cast, as Lana Lang. Casting director Coreen Mayrs sent David Nutter, the director of the pilot episode, a tape of 69 people and the second person on the tape was Kristin Kreuk.<ref name="pilcom"/> They loved her audition tape so much they immediately showed her to the network.<ref name="genesis"/>   

*'''[[Michael Rosenbaum]]''' as '''[[Lex Luthor]]''': A billionaire's son, sent to Smallville to run the local fertilizer plant. After Clark saves his life, the two become quick friends.<ref name="Pilot ep"/> Lex tries to be a hero, but his motives are usually driven by curiosity for the unexplained, like the day Clark rescued him from drowning. He is searching for that unconditional love, something his mother had for him before her death.<ref name="Mike"/> ''Smallville's'' Lex Luthor was not supposed to be a precursor to the more comedic role performed by [[Gene Hackman]]; he was meant to be likeable and vulnerable.<ref name="Mike"/> The role was hard to cast, as no one could agree on who they liked for the role. Gough and Millar wanted to cast a comedian for the series, on the belief that comedians always want to "please and be loved at the same time."<ref name="genesis"/> Michael Rosenbaum auditioned for Lex Luthor twice. Feeling he didn't take his first audition seriously, Rosenbaum outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene, indicating all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing.<ref name="Mike">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.120-123</ref> His audition went so well that everyone agreed he was "the guy".<ref name="genesis"/>

Mack instead auditioned twice for the role of Chloe Sullivan.<ref name="Allison">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.128-131</ref> The character was created just for the series,<ref name="genesis"/> and was intended to have an ethnic background before Mack was hired.<ref name="Allison"/> Part of the reason she was cast was because Gough and Millar felt she had a "rare ability to deliver large chunks of expositionary {{sic}} dialogue conversationally".<ref name="genesis"/>

*'''[[Sam Jones III]]''' as '''[[Pete Ross]]''': Another of Clark's best friends. He hates the Luthors for what he sees as their thievery of his family's [[creamed corn]] business.<ref name="Exodus">{{cite episode|title=Exodus|series=Smallville|credits=Alfred Gough, Miles Millar (writers) & Greg Beeman (director)|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]|airdate=2003-05-20|season=2|number=23|minutes=42}}</ref> He is the first person Clark voluntarily informs of his secret.<ref name="Duplicity">{{cite episode|title=Duplicty|series=Smallville|credits=Todd Slavkin, Darren Swimmer (writers) & Steve Miner (director)|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]|airdate=2002-10-08|season=2|number=3|minutes=42}}</ref> He is in love with Chloe,<ref name="Truth">{{cite episode|title=Truth|series=Smallville|credits=Drew Greenberg (writer) & James Marshall (director)|network=[[The WB Television Network|The WB]]|airdate=2004-04-21|season=3|number=18|minutes=42}}</ref> which he keeps to himself because of the Clark-Lana-Chloe love triangle already taking place.<ref name="Sam">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.124-127</ref> Pete Ross was written out of the series at the end of season three. Sam Jones III, who portrayed Pete Ross, was the last of the series regulars to be cast.

*'''[[Annette O'Toole]]''' as '''[[Ma and Pa Kent|Martha Kent]]''': Clark's adopted mother. She, along with her husband Jonathan, give Clark sage advice about how to cope with his growing abilities.

In her vision, Martha was originally from Metropolis, but she left because she felt it was "too phony".<ref name="Annette"/> O'Toole also believes Martha carries sympathy for Lex, because of all the loss he endured as a child (his mother and his hair).

Around the time the creators were looking to recast the role of Martha Kent, ''The Huntress'' was canceled, which allowed O'Toole to join the cast of ''Smallville''.<ref name="Annette">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.136-139</ref> O'Toole had previously portrayed Lana Lang in ''[[Superman III]]''.<ref name="Owen 3">{{cite news|author=[[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]]|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011014smallvilletv2.asp|title=Superman revisited in "Smallville"|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=[[2001-10-14]]|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref>

Gough and Millar loved the idea of casting John Schneider as Jonathan Kent, because Schneider was already known as [[Bo Duke]] from ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnschneider.tv/dukes.php|title=John Schneider|publisher=JohnSchneider.tv|accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref> which Gough saw as adding belief that he could have grown up running a farm.<ref name="genesis"/>

===Additional cast===
*'''[[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]''' as '''[[Lionel Luthor]]''': Lex's father. Lionel is responsible for the Kents being able to adopt Clark without any legal ramifications or questions of his origins.<ref name="Lineage"/> Glover tried to make Lionel appear as though he was trying to "toughen [Lex] up". The character is made to "go out his way, to give [Lex] tests, so [Lex] can prove himself." Glover saw the character as someone who was a rich and powerful business man, who is disappointed in his son. Glover's goal, for season one, was to show Lionel's attempts to make Lex tougher; he interprets the character's motto, in regards to raising Lex, as "no risk, no rewards."<ref name="Lionel">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pg.144</ref> Lionel was created specifically for the show, to provide a parallel to [[Ma and Pa Kent#Smallville|the Kents]], as an "experiment in extreme parenting."<ref name="genesis"/> In season two, John Glover, who had been a recurring guest on the show in season one, became a part of the regular cast.

''Smallville's'' first accomplishment was breaking the record for highest rated debut for [[the WB Television Network|The WB]], with 8.4 million viewers tuning in for its pilot.<ref>{{cite news|author=Seth Gunderson|url=http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=908|title=Smallville, Kansas. The biggest little town you've ever seen.|publisher=The Trades|date=[[2001-11-05]]|accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref> A common criticism for the first season was the use of "[[villain of the week]]" storylines. By the time the first seven episodes aired, at least one journalist had had enough; [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'s [[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]] stated, "''Smallville'' flies high with super character interaction and a nice performance by John Schneider as Pa Kent, but the series needs better plots than the "monster of the week" stories seen so far."<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]]|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011129owen1129p3.asp|title=Tuned In: It's time to revisit the season's new shows|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|Post-Gazette]]|date=[[2001-11-29]]|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> Jordan Levin, president of The WB's Entertainment division, recognized the concerns that the show had become a villain-of-the-week series. Levin announced that season two would see more "smaller mini-arcs over three to four episodes, to get away from some of the formulaic storytelling structure we were getting ourselves boxed into... We don't want to turn it into a serialized show."<ref name="Post">{{cite news|author=Rob Owen|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20020116owen0116p3.asp|title=Tuned In: UPN got 'Buffy,' but WB gets ratings|publisher=Post-Gazette|date=[[2002-01-16]]|accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> ''Smallville's'' first season placed sixth on the [[Parents Television Council]]'s list of the "best shows for families".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sbcbaptistpress.org/bpnews.asp?ID=14098|title=Broadcast TV may test limits on sex, language|publisher=Baptist Press|date=[[2002-08-26]]|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref>

On [[January 24]], [[2006]], it was confirmed ''Smallville'' would be part of the new [[The CW Television Network|The CW's]] Fall [[2006]]&ndash;[[2007]] lineup once [[the WB Television Network|The WB]] and [[UPN]] ceased separate operations and merged as The CW in September 2006.<ref name="new CW"/>

Allison Mack's character Chloe Sullivan has starred in two promotional tie-in series, ''[[Smallville: Chloe Chronicles]]'', and ''Vengeance Chronicles''. There were two "Chloe Chronicles" editions. The first featured Chloe investigating further into the events of the first season episode "[[Smallville (season 1)#Jitters|Jitters]]". The second edition, ''Chloe Chronicles, Vol II'', was a continuation of the first. In total, the first two series included seven mini-episodes. The third series was a spin-off of the fifth season episode "[[Smallville (season 5)#Vengeance|Vengeance]]". Titled ''Vengeance Chronicles'', Chloe joins forces with a costumed vigilante whom she dubs the "Angel of Vengeance."

On [[April 19]], [[2007]], a tie-in with [[Toyota]], promoting their new [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Yaris]], featured an online comic strip as [[Interstitial program|interstitial]] programs, during new episodes, titled ''Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom.'' The interactive comic was based on the episode "Justice", which follows the adventures of Oliver Queen, Bart Allen, Victor Stone, and Arthur Curry as they seek to destroy all of LuthorCorp's secret experimental labs. The online series allowed viewers to investigate alongside the fictional team, in an effort to win prizes.<ref name="Justice and Doom">{{cite web|url=http://supermanhomepage.com/news.php?readmore=3392|title=Smallville Legends: Justice and Doom press release|publisher=Superman Homepage.com|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref> The plots of ''Smallville'' and the ''Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom'' are integral and complimentary to each other.
