{{Merge|USS Black Douglas (PYc-45)|date=December 2007}}

The '''''Black Douglas''''' (later ''teQuest'', ''Aquarius'', ''Aquarius W''; now ''El Boughaz I'') was a three-masted [[staysail]] auxiliary [[schooner]] built for Robert C. Roebling (great-grandson of [[John A. Roebling]] and grand-nephew of [[Washington Roebling]]) at the [[Bath Iron Works]] of [[Bath, Maine]], and launched on June 9, [[1930]]. Designed by renowned [[New York]] [[Naval architecture|naval architects]] H.J. Gielow & Co., she is one of the largest [[steel]]-[[Hull (watercraft)|hulled]] schooners ever built.

The [[ship]] undertook a variety of functions during her first three and a half decades: private [[yacht]] for the Roebling family, coastal patrol vessel in [[United States Navy]] service during [[World War II]], and [[research vessel]] for the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] plying the [[Pacific]] from [[Alaska]] to [[Baja California]].

She was bought at auction by Louis Black of Santa Monica Ca. to be used as a treasure hunting ship in the Caribbean but due to changes in the salvage laws this enterprise never materialized. From the mid-[[1960s]] she ran airplane parts around the [[Bahamas]] (until the owners went broke), and ended up moored at an out island in the [[Turks and Caicos]], being used as a floating [[electrical generator]]. Capt. George Stoll found her there and turned her into a second [[Flint School]] [[school ship]] until the school closed. She was then sold and in [[1982]]–[[1983]] was reconditoned at the Abeking & Rasmussen [[shipyard]] in [[Lemwerder]], [[Germany]], serving as a template for the first generation of [[super yacht]]s. She is currently owned by King [[Mohammed VI of Morocco]].

She was launched with a 325-[[Horsepower|hp]] [[Cooper Industries|Cooper-Bessemer]] marine [[diesel engine]], later replaced by a 400-hp model from [[San Francisco]]'s Enterprise Engine & Foundry Co. She now is equipped with twin 290-hp [[Volvo Penta]]s. She has flown the flags of the [[United States]], [[Panama]], the [[Cayman Islands]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Morocco]] (current).

Dimensions: LOA, 175 feet; draft, 12.5 feet; beam, 32 feet.
