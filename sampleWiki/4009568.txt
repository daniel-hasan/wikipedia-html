}}</ref> or ''Masacre de las bananeras'' was a massacre of workers for the [[United Fruit Company]] that occurred on [[December 6]], [[1928]] in the town of [[Ciénaga, Magdalena|Ciénaga]] near [[Santa Marta]], [[Colombia]]. An unknown number of workers died<ref>See [[Talk:Santa Marta Massacre#The Death Toll]]</ref> after the government decided to send the military forces to end a month long [[Strike action|strike]] organized by the workers' [[Trade union|union]] in order to demand better working conditions.

==Strike==
The workers of the banana plantations in Colombia went on strike in December 1928. They demanded written contracts, eight-hour days, six-day weeks and the elimination of food coupons.  The strike turned into the largest labor movement ever witnessed in the country until then. Radical members of the [[Liberal Party of Colombia|Liberal Party]], as well as members of the Socialist and Communist Parties, participated.<ref>{{cite web

==Massacre==
An army regiment from [[Bogotá]] was dispatched by the government to deal with the strikers, which it deemed to be subversive. Whether these troops were sent in at the behest of the United Fruit company was and remained a matter of debate.

The troops set up their machine guns on the roofs of the low buildings at the corners of the main square, closed off the access streets,<ref>{{cite book

==Number dead==
General Cortés Vargas, who commanded the troops during the massacre, took responsibility for 47 casualties, but the exact number of casualties has never been confirmed. Herrera Soto, co-author of a comprehensive and detailed study of the 1928 strike, has put together various estimates given by contemporaries and historians, ranging from 47 to 2,000.<ref name="E" />

Among the survivors was Luis Vicente Gámez, later a famous local figure, who survived by hiding under a bridge for three days. Every year after the massacre he delivered a memorial service over the radio.

==Justifications==
General [[Cortés Vargas]], who issued the order to shoot, argued later that he had issued the order because he had information that U.S. boats were poised to land troops on Colombian coasts to defend American personnel and the interests of the United Fruit Company. Vargas issued the order so the US would not invade Colombia. This position was strongly criticized in the [[Senate of Colombia|Senate]], especially by  [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]], who argued that those same bullets should have been used to stop the foreign invader.[http://64.233.179.104/translate_c?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masacre_de_las_Bananeras&prev=/search%3Fq%3DMasacre%2Bde%2Blas%2BBananeras%2Bwikipedia%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26hs%3DPrQ%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DG]

==U.S. embassy telegrams==

The Telegram from Bogotá Embassy to the U.S. Secretary of State, dated [[December 5]], [[1928]], stated:
<blockquote>I have been following Santa Marta fruit strike through United Fruit Company representative here; also through Minister of Foreign Affairs who on Saturday told me government would send additional troops and would arrest all strike leaders and transport them to prison at Cartagena; that government would give adequate protection to American interests involved.[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/santamarta.htm]</blockquote> 

The telegram from Bogotá Embassy to Secretary of State, date [[December 7]], [[1928]], stated:

{{cquote|Situation outside Santa Marta City unquestionably very serious: outside zone is in revolt; military who have orders "not to spare ammunition" have already killed and wounded about fifty strikers. Government now talks of general offensive against strikers as soon as all troopships now on the way arrive early next week.[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/santamarta.htm]}} 

The Dispatch from US Bogotá Embassy to the US Secretary of State, dated [[December 29]], [[1928]], stated:

{{cquote|I have the honor to report that the legal advisor of the United Fruit Company here in Bogotá stated yesterday that the total number of strikers killed by the Colombian military authorities during the recent disturbance reached between five and six hundred; while the number of soldiers killed was one.[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/santamarta.htm]}}

The Dispatch from US Bogotá Embassy to the US Secretary of State, dated [[January 16]], [[1929]], stated:

{{cquote|I have the honor to report that the Bogotá representative of the United Fruit Company told me yesterday that the total number of strikers killed by the Colombian military exceeded one thousand.[http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/colombia/santamarta.htm]}}

==Consequences==

Guerrilla movements in Colombia like the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] argued that one of the consequences for the development of [[Communism in Colombia|communism]] in Colombia was triggered by events like these and called it state terrorism. The Banana massacre is set to be one of the main events that preceded the [[Bogotazo]], the subsequent era of violence known as [[La Violencia]] and the guerrillas that developed during the bipartisan [[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]] to created the ongoing [[Colombian armed conflict]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
