'''[[Snake]]s''', like other [[reptile]]s, have a skin covered in '''[[Scale (zoology)|scale]]s'''.<ref name = "Boulenger_1"> Boulenger, George A. 1890 The Fauna of British India. page 1</ref> Snakes are entirely covered with scales or [[scutes]] of various shapes and sizes. Scales protect the body of the snake, aid it in locomotion, allow moisture to be retained within, alter the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage, and in some cases even aid in prey capture (such as [[Acrochordus]]). The simple or complex colouration patterns (which help in camouflage and anti-predator display) are a property of the underlying skin, but the folded nature of scaled skin allows bright skin to be concealed between scales then revealed in order to startle predators. 

Scales have been modified over time to serve other functions such as 'eyelash' fringes, and protective covers for the eyes<ref name="INSnakes"> [http://herpcenter.ipfw.edu/outreach/INherps/INsnakes.htm The Snakes of Indiana] at [http://herpcenter.ipfw.edu/ The Centre for Reptile and Amphibian Conservation and Management, Indiana]. Accessed 14 August 2006.</ref> with the most distinctive modification being the ''rattle'' of the North American rattlesnakes. 

Snakes periodically moult their scaly skins and acquire new ones. This permits replacement of old worn out skin, disposal of parasites and is thought to allow the snake to grow. The arrangement of scales is used to identify snake species. <!-- It permits creation of simple keys which would identify the snake and help distinguish venomous from non-venomous snakes. comment - Remove this since it suggests that there are special scales that separate venomous from non-venomous when in fact the idea is that this is a result of species identification which is already mentioned. Similarly with genera... are there special genus specific scales ? Even if so, this is already covered . -->

Snakes have been part and parcel of culture and religion. Vivid scale patterns have been thought to have influenced early art. The use of snake-skin in manufacture of purses, apparel and other articles led to large-scale killing of snakes, giving rise to advocacy for use of artificial snake-skin. Snake scales are also to be found as motifs in fiction, video games and films.

==Functions of scales==
[[Image:AB 053 Banded Krait.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Dorsal scales on the body of a '''Banded Krait''' ''[[Bungarus fasciatus]]'']] 
The scales of a snake primarily serve to reduce friction as it moves, since friction is the major source of energy loss in snake locomotion. The ventral (or belly) scales, which are large and oblong, are especially low-friction, and some arboreal species can use the edges to grip branches. Most snakes have at least some large scales (called 'shields') on their head, which can be used to distinguish different species.

Snake skin and scales help retain moisture in the animal's body.<ref name="Kentucky2"> [http://www.kentuckysnakes.org/publication.cfm Kentucky Snake Publication (pdf). University of Kentucky]</ref> 

Snakes pick up vibrations from both the air and the ground, and can differentiate the two, using a complex system of internal resonances (perhaps involving the scales) [http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/54/2/349].

==Morphology of scales==
[[Image:AB Keeled Scales.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Keeled scales of Buff-striped keelback ''[[Amphiesma stolatum]]'', a Colubrid.]]
Snake scales are formed by the differentiation of the snake's underlying skin or [[epidermis]].[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/110429759/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0]  Each scale has an outer surface  and an inner surface. The skin from the inner surface hinges back and forms a free area which overlaps the base of the next scale which emerges below this scale.<ref name = "Greene_pg22"> Greene, Harry W. Snakes - The Evolution of Mystery in Nature, page 22</ref>

A snake hatches with a fixed number of scales. The scales do not increase in number as the snake matures nor do they reduce in number over time. The scales however grow larger in size and may change shape with each [[moult]].<ref name="RSSlimy">[http://www.szgdocent.org/resource/rr/c-slimy.htm Are snakes slimy?] at [http://www.szgdocent.org/ Singapore Zoological Garden's Docent]. Accessed 14 August 2006.</ref>

Snakes have smaller scales around the mouth and sides of the body which allow expansion so that a snake can consume prey of much larger width than itself. 

Snake scales are made of [[keratin]], the same material that hair and fingernails are made of.<ref name="RSSlimy"/>  They are cool and dry to touch.<ref name="SDNHM-HerpFAQ">[http://www.sdnhm.org/research/herpetology/herpfaq.html Herpetology FAQ] at [http://www.sdnhm.org/ San Diego Museum of Natural History]. Accessed 14 August 2006.</ref>

===Surface and shape===
Snake scales are of different shapes and sizes.  Snake scales may be granular, have a smooth surface or have a longitudinal ridge or keel on it. Often, snake scales have pits, tubercles and other fine structures which may be visible to the naked eye or under a microscope. Snake scales may be modified to form fringes, as in the case of the Eyelash Bush Viper, ''[[Atheris ceratophora]]'', or rattles as in the case of the [[rattlesnake]]s of [[North America]].<ref name="Greene_pg23"> Greene, Harry W. Snakes - The Evolution of Mystery in Nature, page 23</ref> 

Certain primitive snakes such as [[boa]]s, [[Pythonidae|python]]s and certain advanced snakes such as [[viper]]s have small scales arranged irregularly on the head. Other more advanced snakes have special large symmetrical scales on the head called ''shields'' or ''plates''.<ref name="Greene_pg22"/> 

Snake scales occur in variety of shapes. They may be :
[[Image:Leptotyphlops humilis - head.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cycloid scales on ''[[Leptotyphlops humilis]]''.]]
* cycloid as in family ''[[Typhlopidae]]''.<ref name="Boulenger_234"> Boulenger, George A. ''The Fauna of British India''... page 234</ref>
* long and pointed with pointed tips, as in the case of the Green Vine Snake ''[[Ahaetulla nasuta]]''.<ref name="Smith3_6"> Smith, Malcolm A. Fauna of British India...Vol III - Serpentes, page 6</ref>
* broad and leaf-like, as in the case of green pit vipers ''[[Trimeresurus]]'' spp.<ref name="Smith3_6"/>
* as broad as they are long, for example, as in Rat snake ''[[Ptyas mucosus]]''.<ref name="Smith3_6"/>
* [[Keeled scales|keeled]] weakly or strongly as in the case of the Buff-striped keelback ''[[Amphiesma stolatum]]''.<ref name="Smith3_6"/>
* with bidentate tips as in some spp of ''[[Natrix]]''.<ref name="Smith3_6"/>
* spinelike, juxtaposed as in the Short Seasnake ''[[Lapemis curtus]]''.<ref name="Greene_pg22"/>
* large, non-overlapping knobs as in the case of the Javan Mudsnake ''[[Xenodermis javanicus]]''.<ref name="Greene_pg22"/>

Another example of differentiation of snake [[Scale (zoology)|scales]] is a transparent scale called the ''brille'' or ''spectacle'' which covers the eye of the snake. The brille is often referred to as a fused eyelid. It is shed as part of the old skin during [[moult]]ing.<ref name="INSnakes"/>

===Rattles===
[[Image:Crotale diamantin 40.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Modified tail scales form a rattle on a '''Western Diamondback Rattlesnake''' ''[[Crotalus atrox]]''.]]
The most distinctive modification of the snake scale is the ''rattle'' of [[rattlesnakes]], such as those of the genera ''[[Crotalus]]'' and ''[[Sistrurus]]''. The rattle is made up of a series of loosely linked, interlocking chambers that when shaken, vibrate against one another to create the warning signal of a rattlesnake. Only the bottom button is firmly attached to the tip of the tail.<ref name = "RepSnakeFacts">[http://www.colszoo.org/animalareas/reptiles/snakfact.html Reptiles - Snake facts. Columbus Zoo & Aquarium.]</ref> 

At birth, a rattlesnake hatchling has only a small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached to the tip of the tail.<ref name = "RepSnakeFacts"/> The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time.<ref name=''Newton''>[http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/zoo00/zoo00533.htm|Young Snake Rattles! Ask a scientist! (Zoology archive). Newton BBS, Argonne National Laboratory.]</ref> A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.<ref name=''desertusa 98''>[http://www.desertusa.com/mag98/mar/stories/rattlesin.html|''Spring rattles in!'' by '''Dusty Rhoades''' in Desert USA website].</ref>

===Colour===
Scales, more specifically, mostly consist of hard beta [[keratin]]s which are basically transparent. The colours of the scale are due to pigments in the inner layers of the skin and not due to the scale material itself. Scales are hued for all colours in this manner except for blue and green. Blue is caused by the [[ultrastructure]] of the scales. By itself, such a scale surface diffracts light and gives a blue hue, while, in combination with yellow from the inner skin it gives a beautiful iridescent green. 

Some snakes have the ability to change the hue of their scales slowly. This is typically seen in cases where the snake becomes lighter or darker with change in season. In some cases, this change may take place between day and night.<ref name="RSSlimy"/>

===Ecdysis===
[[Image:Crotalus durissus terrificus1.jpg|thumb|340px|left|A '''cascavel''' (''[[Crotalus durissus]]''), a species of rattlesnake, seen moulting.]]
The shedding of scales is called ''[[ecdysis]]'', or, in normal usage ''[[moult]]ing'' or ''sloughing''. In the case of snakes, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer.<ref name = "Smith1_30"> Smith, Malcolm A. Fauna of British India...Vol I - Loricata and Testudines, page 30 </ref> Snake scales are not discrete but extensions of the epidermis hence they are not shed separately, but are ejected as a complete contiguous outer layer of skin during each [[moult]], akin to a sock being turned inside out.<ref name="RSSlimy"/>

[[Moult]]ing serves a number of functions - firstly, the old and worn skin is replaced, secondly, it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks. Renewal of the skin by [[moult]]ing is supposed to allow growth in some animals such as insects, however this view has been disputed in the case of snakes.<ref name="RSSlimy"/><ref name="ZooPax3"> [http://whozoo.org/ZooPax/ZPScales_3.htm ZooPax Scales Part 3]</ref>

Moulting is repeated periodically throughout a snake's life. Before a moult, the snake stops eating and often hides or moves to a safe place. Just prior to shedding, the skin becomes dull and dry looking and the eyes become cloudy or blue-colored. The inner surface of the old outer skin liquefies. This causes the old outer skin to separate from the new inner skin. After a few days, the eyes clear and the snake "crawls" out of its old skin. The old skin breaks near the mouth and the snake wriggles out aided by rubbing against rough surfaces. In many cases the cast skin peels backward over the body from head to tail, in one piece like an old sock. A new, larger, and brighter layer of skin has formed underneath.<ref name="RSSlimy"/><ref name = "GenSnakeInfo"> [http://www.sdgfp.info/Wildlife/Snakes/SnakeInfo.htm General Snake Information - Division of Wildlife, South Dakota]</ref>

An older snake may shed its skin only once or twice a year, but a younger, still-growing snake, may shed up to four times a year.<ref name = "GenSnakeInfo"/> The discarded skin gives a perfect imprint of the scale pattern and it is usually possible to identify the snake if this discard is reasonably complete and intact.<ref name="RSSlimy"/>

[[Image:AB045 Scales on a snakes head.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Nomenclature of scales (top view of head)]]

==Arrangement of scales== 
Excepting for the head, snakes have imbricate scales, overlapping like the tiles on a roof.<ref name="Smith3_5"> Smith, Malcolm A. Fauna of British India...Vol III - Serpentes, page 5</ref> Snakes have rows of scales along the whole or part of their length and also many other specialised scales, either singly or in pairs, occurring on the head and other regions of the body.

The dorsal (or body) scales on the snake's body are arranged in rows along the length of their bodies. Adjacent rows are diagonally offset from each other. Most snakes have an odd number of rows across the body though certain species have an even number of rows e.g. ''[[Zaocys]]'' spp.<ref name="Greene_pg22"/>  In the case of some aquatic and marine snakes, the scales are granular and the rows cannot be counted.<ref name="Smith3_5"/>

The number of rows range from ten in Tiger Ratsnake ''[[Spilotes pullatus]]''; thirteen in ''[[Dryocalamus]]'', ''[[Liopeltis]]'', ''[[Calamaria]]'' and Asian coral snakes of genus ''[[Calliophis]]''; 65 to 75 in [[Pythonidae|python]]s; 74 to 93 in ''[[Kolpophis]]'' and 130 to 150 in ''[[Acrochordus]]''. The majority of the largest family of snakes, the ''[[Colubridae]]'' have  15, 17 or 19 rows of scales.<ref name="Greene_pg22"/><ref name="Smith3_7"> Smith, Malcolm A. Fauna of British India...Vol III - Serpentes, page 7</ref>

The maximum number of rows are in mid-body and they reduce in count towards the head and on the tail.

==Nomenclature of scales==
The various scales on a snake's head and body are indicated in the following paragraphs with annotated photographs of Buff-striped Keelback ''[[Amphiesma stolata]]'' (a common grass-snake of South Asia). 

===Head scales===
[[Image:AB047 Scales on a snakes head.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Nomenclature of scales (underside view of head)]]
Identification of scales is most conveniently begun with reference to the nostril which is easily identified on the snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the '''nasals'''. The outer nasal (near the snout) is called the '''prenasal''' while the inner nasal (near the eye) is called the '''postnasal'''. Along the top of the snout connecting the nasals on both sides of the head are scales called '''internasals'''.

Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of the snout called the '''rostral''' scale.

The scales around the eye are called '''circumorbital''' scales and are named as 'ocular' scales but with appropriate prefix. The '''ocular scale''' proper is a transparent scale covering the eye which is called the '''spectacle''', '''[[brille]]''' or '''eyecap'''.<ref name="RSSlimy"/><ref name = "Evolution"> [http://arachnophiliac.co.uk/burrow/evolution_of_snakes.htm Evolution of snakes. Accessed 21 August 2006.]</ref>.

The circumorbital scales towards the snout or the front are called '''preocular''' scales, those towards the rear are called '''postocular''' scales and those towards the upper or dorsal side are called as '''supraocular''' scales. Circumorbital scales towards the ventral or lower side, if any, are called as '''subocular''' scales.

Between the preocular and the postnasal scales are the '''loreal''' scales.

The scales along the lips of the snake are called as '''labials'''. Those on the upper lip are called '''supralabials''' while those on the lower labial are called '''infralabials'''.

Between the eyeballs on top of the head, adjacent to the supraoculars are the '''frontal''' scales. The '''prefrontal''' scales are the scales connected to the frontals towards the tip of the snout which are in contact with the internasals.

The back of the top of the head has scales connected to the frontal scales called as the '''parietal''' scales. At the sides of the back of the head are scales called '''temporal''' scales.

On the underside of the head, a snake has an anterior scale called as the '''mental''' scale.  Connected to the mental scales and all along the lower jaws are the '''infralabials'''. Along the lower jaw connected to infralabials are a pair of shields called the '''anterior chin shields'''. Next to the anterior chin shields, further back along the jaw are another pair of shields called the '''posterior chin shields'''.

Scales in the central or ''throat'' region, which are in contact with the first [[ventral scales]] of a snake's body and are flanked by the [[chin shields]], are called '''gular scales'''.

The '''mental groove''' is a longitudinal groove on the underside of the head between large, paired chin shields and smaller gular scales.

===Scales on the body===
[[Image:AB 053 Banded Krait.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Enlarged vertebral scales of Banded Krait ''[[Bungarus fasciatus]]'']]
The scales on the body of the snake are called the '''dorsal''' or '''costal''' scales. Sometimes there is a special row of large scales along the top of the back of the snake, i.e, the uppermost row, called the '''vertebral''' scales.

The enlarged scales on the belly of the snake are called '''ventral''' scales or '''gastrosteges'''. 

In "advanced" ([[Caenophidia]]n) snakes, the broad belly scales and rows of dorsal scales correspond to the vertebrae, allowing scientists to count the vertebrae without dissection.

===Tail scales===
[[Image:AB048 Scales on a snakes body.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Nomenclature of scales (underside view of body)]]
At the end of the ventral scales of the snake is an anal plate which protects the opening to the cloaca (a shared opening for waste and reproductive material to pass) on the underside near the tail. This '''anal''' scale may be single or divided into a pair. The part of the body beyond the anal scale is considered to be the tail.<ref name = "RepSnakeFacts"/>

Sometimes snakes have enlarged scales, either single or paired, under the tail; these are called '''subcaudals''' or '''urosteges'''. These subcaudals may be smooth or keeled as in ''[[Bitis arietans somalica]]''. The end of the tail may simply taper into a tip (as in the case of most snakes), it may form a spine (as in ''[[Acanthophis]]''), end in a bony spur (as in ''[[Lachesis (genus)|Lachesis]]''), a rattle (as in ''[[Crotalus]]''), or a rudder as seen in many sea snakes.

==Taxonomic importance==
Scales do not play an important role in distinguishing between the [[family (biology)|families]] but are important at [[genus|generic]] and [[species|specific]] level. There is an elaborate scheme of nomenclature of scales. Scales patterns, by way of scale surface or texture, pattern and colouration  and the division of the anal plate, in combination with other morphological characteristics,  are the principal means of classifying snakes down to species level.<ref name="Kentucky1"> [http://www.kentuckysnakes.org/snake/ How to identify snakes - Kentucky snake identification. University of Kentucky]</ref> 

In certain areas in North America, where the diversity of snakes is not too large, easy keys based on simple identification of scales have been devised for the lay public to distinguish poisonous snakes from non-poisonous snakes.<ref name="Damage"> [http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/nreos/wild/wildlife/wdc/snakes.html North Carolina State Wildlife Damage Notes - Snakes]</ref> <ref name="PennState"> [http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/FreePubs/pdfs/uh124.pdf   Pennsylvania State University - Wildlife Damage Control 15 (pdf)]</ref> In other places with large biodiversity, such as Myanmar, publications caution that venomous and non-venomous snakes cannot be easily distinguished apart without careful examination.<ref name="MyanmarList"> Leviton AE, Wogan GOU, Koo MS, Zug GR, Lucas RS, Vindum JV. 2003. The Dangerously Venomous Snakes of Myanmar, Illustrated Checklist with Keys. Proc. Cal. Acad. Sci. 54 (24):407-462. [http://www.nmnh.si.edu/vert/reptiles/Publications/levitonal2003-dangven.pdf PDF] at [http://www.nmnh.si.edu/vert/reptiles/ Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Division of Amphibians and Reptiles]. Accessed 8 August 2006.</ref>

Identification of snakes by reference to scales seems an arcane art to the amateur naturalist because the nomenclature of snake scales seems esoteric and, more importantly, the snakes need to be caught and the head and body examined closely in hand for identification. The advent of high definition digital cameras means that images taken of snakes, if of appropriate definition and of the correct position, would show scales that can be examined, distinguished and counted without the need for catching and handling. 

The scales patterning may also be used for individual identification in field studies. Clipping of specific scales to mark individual snakes is a popular approach to population estimation by [[mark and recapture]] techniques.

===Distinguishing between venomous and non-venomous snakes===
Finding out whether a snake is [[venom]]ous or not is correctly done by identification of the species of a snake with the help of experts, or in their absence, close examination of the snake and using authoritative references on the snakes of the particular geographical region to identify it. Scale patterns help indicate the species and from the references, it can be verified if the snake species is venomous or not.

A point to note is that such identification requires a fair degree of knowledge about snakes, their taxonomy, snake-scale nomenclature as well as familiarity and access to authoritative scientific texts on snakes. 

In certain regions, experts use presence or absence of certain scales to distinguish between non-venomous and venomous scales, with well-understood exceptions. For example, in relation to venomous snakes of [[Myanmar]], the distribution of snakes permits the use of the presence or absence of [[loreal scale]]s to distinguish between relatively harmless [[Colubrids]] and lethally venomous [[Elapids]].<ref name="MyanmarList"/>

The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the [[nasal scale]] and [[ocular scale|pre-ocular scale]] indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal.<ref name="MyanmarList"/>

Please note that this rule-of-hand applies to terrestrial venomous snakes only and that vipers are an exception since they cannot be so classified due to the large number of small scales on the head. Subsequently a further check is to be carried out in the case of identified Colubrids to exclude known poisonous members of their family such as ''Rhabdophis'' species.<ref name="MyanmarList"/>

In South Asia, it is advisable to kill the snake which has bitten a person and carry it along to the hospital for possible identification by medical staff using scale diagrams so that an informed decision can be taken them as to whether and which anti-venin is to be administered.

==Cultural significance==
Snakes have been a motif in human culture and religion and an object of dread and fascination all over the world. The vivid patterns of snake scales, such as the [[Bitis gabonica|Gaboon Viper]], both repel and fascinate the human mind. Such patterns have inspired dread and awe in humans from pre-historic times and these can be seen in the art prevalent to those times.  Studies of fear imagery and psychological arousal indicate that snake scales are a vital component of snake imagery. Snake scales also appear to have affected Islamic art in the form of tessallated mosaic patterns which show great similarity to snake-scale patterns.<ref name = "Aesthetics_108_116"/>
