{{Politics of Switzerland}}

'''Elections to the [[Swiss Federal Assembly]], the federal parliament of [[Switzerland]]''', were held on Sunday, [[October 21]], [[2007]]. In a few cantons, a second round of the elections to the Council of States was held on [[11 November]], [[18 November]], or [[25 November]] [[2007]]. For the 48th legislative term of the federal parliament (2007–2011), voters in 26 [[Swiss cantons|cantons]] elected all 200 members of the [[National Council of Switzerland|National Council]] as well as 43 out of 46 members of the [[Swiss Council of States|Council of States]]. The other three members of the Council of States for that term of service were elected at an earlier date.<ref name="early">The date of the election of the members of the Council of States is a matter of cantonal law. 24 cantons have chosen to let the elections coincide with the federally regulated National Council elections. Two cantons are electing their members of the Council of States at an earlier date: [[Canton of Zug|Zug]] reelected its incumbents [[Peter Bieri]] and [[Rolf Schweiger]] on [[29 October]] [[2006]], while [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] elected [[Ivo Bischofsberger]] as  its one representative in that Council on [[29 April]] [[2007]].</ref>

On [[12 December]] [[2007]], the newly elected legislature [[Swiss Federal Council election, 2007|elected]] the Swiss federal government, the [[Swiss Federal Council]], for a four-year-term.

The main result was the consolidation of the leading position of the populist [[Swiss People's Party]], at 29% of the popular vote, and the growth of the [[Green Party of Switzerland|Green]] and [[Green Liberal Party of Switzerland|Green Liberal]] parties at the expense of the  [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democrats]].<ref>main migration of voters was from SPS to GPS and GLP. Minor movements from CVP to GLP, and some migration from all of SPS, CVP and FDP to SVP [http://www.tagblatt.ch/index.php?artikelxml=1416150&ressort=tagblattheute/inland&jahr=2007&ressortcode=&ms=]</ref>.

===National Council===
{{seealso|List of members of the Swiss National Council (2007-2011)}}

The Swiss People's Party successfully defended its clear position as the strongest party, rising another 2.3% to 29.0% of the popular vote. Support of the Social Democrats eroded to the benefit of the Green and Green Liberal parties.

The right wing with 63 seats (the SVP with 62 seats plus a single seat of the [[Christian right]] [[Federal Democratic Union of Switzerland|Federal Democratic Union]]) is  numerically neutralized by the left-wing Red-Green block (43+20 seats). The centrist CVP and the centre-right FDP are likewise symmetrical, with 31 seats each. The remaining 12 seats are taken by the minor parties: 9 in the political center (Liberals, 4 seats; Green Liberals, 3 seats; Evangelical People's Party, 2 seats), besides  the regionalist  [[Ticino League]], the Christian-left [[Christian Social Party (Switzerland)|Christian Social Party]] and the far-left [[Swiss Labour Party|Labour Party]] with a single seat each.  

59 of  200 seats (29.5%) were won by women, as compared to 50 in 2003. [[Ricardo Lumengo]] (Social Democrats, born in [[Angola]]) is notable as the first [[Afro-European|black]] Swiss national councillor. 23 incumbents did not get re-elected and lost their mandate, among them [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]] far-right politician [[Ulrich Schlüer]] (SVP).The turnout of the election was 48,9% a rise of 3,7% from the previous elections in 2003.

===Council of States===

Contrary to the developments in the National Council, the Council of States remains dominated by the traditional "center" parties FDP and CVP. 

[[Robert Cramer (Swiss politician)|Robert Cramer]] (Geneva) is the first member of the Green Party to be elected to the Council of States, joined in the second round by [[Luc Recordon]] of Vaud. [[Verena Diener]] (Zurich), formerly of the Green Party, wins a Council of States seat for the newly-founded Green Liberal Party.   [[Christine Egerszegi]] of [[Aargau]] (FDP) is the first woman councillor elected in that canton. 

====Second rounds====

The Council of States election was not finalized with the first run on [[21 October]]; twelve seats remained to be distributed in second round elections on [[11 November]], [[18 November]] or [[25 November]] [[2007]].<ref>http://tagi.ch/dyn/news/schweiz/805079.html</ref> 

The second round saw a number of notable races, for instance the election for the second seat in Zürich, where SP candidate [[Chantal Galladé]] agreed to withdraw and support GLP candidate [[Verena Diener]] against SVP candidate [[Ueli Maurer]], increasing the centre-left's changes in the second round.<ref>http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/zuerich/aktuell/chantal_gallade_verzichtet_1.575094.html</ref> In St. Gallen, where no one was elected in the first round, FDP candidate [[Erika Forster]] and CVP candidate [[Eugen David]], both incumbents, started a common campaign for reelection against SVP candidate [[Toni Brunner]].<ref>http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/schweiz/aktuell/brunner_staenderat_st_gallen_1.575039.html</ref> Four candidates contested the election for the two seats in Tessin -- [[Dick Marty]] (FDP, over 40,000 votes in the first round), [[Filippo Lombardi]] (CVP), [[Franco Cavalli]] (SP) -- both of whom had over 30,000 votes -- and finally [[Attilio Bignasca]] (Lega).<ref>http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/schweiz/aktuell/lombardi_erhaelt_schuetzenhilfe_von_der_lega__1.576581.html</ref> The two incumbents from the FDP and CVP were reelected on [[18 November]].

The second seat for Lucerne was handed to CVP candidate [[Konrad Graber]] in so-called "silent election" when no other candidate filed to run against him in the second round. Graber had narrowly failed to be elected in the first round.<ref>http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/schweiz/aktuell/stille_wahl_im_kanton_luzern_1.574544.html</ref> The second mandate in Fribourg and Wallis was also decided in this way.
