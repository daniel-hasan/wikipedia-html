Colonel '''Lê Quang Tùng''' (1923 &ndash; [[November 1]], [[1963]]) was the commander of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces]] under the command of [[Ngo Dinh Nhu|Ngô Ðình Nhu]], the brother of [[South Vietnam]]'s president, [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Ngô Đình Diệm]]. A former servant of the Ngô family, Tùng's military background was in security and counterespionage. During the 1950s, Tùng was a high ranking official in Nhu's [[Can Lao Party|Cần Lao Party]], the secret [[Roman Catholic]] party which maintained the Ngô family's grip on power, extorting money from wealthy businessmen. He was promoted in 1960 directly to the rank of colonel, and appointed as the commander of the Special Forces. Tùng's period in command was noted mostly for his work in repressing dissidents, rather than fighting the [[Vietcong|Việt Cộng]] insurgents. His most well known attack was the [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids|raid on Xa Loi Pagoda]] on [[August 21]], [[1963]] during the [[Buddhist crisis]], in which hundreds of monks were believed to have died. Tùng's main military program was a scheme in which [[ARVN]] personnel attempted to infiltrate [[North Vietnam]] to engage in intelligence gathering and sabotage. The program was ineffective, with the vast majority of infiltrators being killed or captured. He was assassinated during the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|November 1963 coup]] that toppled Diệm's government. 

== Early career ==
A devout [[Roman Catholic]] from [[Provinces_of_Vietnam#Regions|central Vietnam]], Tùng was born in 1923 in what was then [[Annam (French colony)|Annam]] in [[French Indochina]]. Short and bespectacled, Tùng was a former servant in the Ngô family. Serving a family dictatorship concerned purely with unadulterated power, his military background was almost entirely in security and counterespionage, an unusual training for leading the special forces. Tùng had first served the French as a security officer in central Vietnam before working for Diệm in the military-security section in central Vietnam. Tùng was a high ranking official in Nhu's [[Can Lao Party|Cần Lao Party]], the secret Roman Catholic party which maintained the Ngô family's grip on power. Tùng was known among colleagues primarily for his unstinting loyalty and was hated by generals such as [[Nguyen Khanh|Nguyễn Khánh]] and [[Ton That Dinh|Tôn Thất Đính]].<ref>Jones, p. 301.</ref> His first job under Diệm was as a lieutenant in the intelligence section, where he extorted money from wealthy businessmen for the [[Can Lao Party|Cần Lao Party]]. In 1960, he was promoted straight to the rank of colonel and put in charge of the Special Forces.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Shaplen| title=The lost revolution : Vietnam 1945-1965 | year=1965 |publisher=[[Andre Deutsch]] |pages=190}}</ref> The [[CIA]] rated Tùng the third most powerful man in South Vietnam behind Diệm and Nhu, making him South Vietnam's most powerful military officer.<ref>Prochnau, p. 368.</ref>

Tùng had been trained by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in the [[United States]]. A Diệm loyalist, he lead a force of 1,840 men,<ref name="langguth">{{cite book| title=Our Vietnam| first=A. J. |last=Langguth |year=2000 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] | pages =248| isbn=0-684-81202-9}}</ref> which operated under Nhu's direction. He did not conduct operations against the communist [[Vietcong|Việt Cộng]] insurgents, but instead used his forces mainly in Saigon for repressing dissidents against the Diệm regime. Tùng's most notable attacks occurred during the [[Buddhist crisis]] of 1963. During this period, the Buddhist majority engaged in mass protests against the pro-Catholic policies of the Diệm regime. His special forces, under Nhu's orders, were responsible for the [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids|raid]] on [[August 21]], [[1963]], of the [[Xa Loi Pagoda]], causing a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds. A further 1,400 [[bhikkhu|monks]] and [[Bhikkhuni|nuns]] were arrested, as well as extensive property damage. The attacks occurred after Nhu had tricked a group of [[ARVN]] generals into agreeing to declare [[martial law]]. Nhu knew that the generals were plotting and hoped to exploit martial law to overthrow his brother, but outmaneuvred them by using the opportunity to send Tùng's Special Forces into the pagodas disguised as regular ARVN soldiers. As a result, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority initially thought that the regular army had attacked the monks, damaging their credibility among the populace as potential leaders of the country.<ref name="karnow">Karnow, pp. 306&ndash;324.</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Vietnam:The ten thousand day was| first=Michael |last=Maclear |year=1981 |publisher=[[Methuen]] | pages =89&ndash;90| isbn=0-423-00580-4}}</ref> Following the attacks, US officials threatened to withhold aid to the Special Forces unless they were used in fighting communists, rather than attacking dissidents.<ref name="langguth"/><ref name="encyc">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War| first= Spencer C. |last=Tucker |year=2000 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]| pages =227| isbn=1-57607-040-0}}</ref>

Another notable religious attack was perpetrated by Tùng's men in 1963. In a small pond near the central city of [[Da Nang|Đà Nẵng
]], a hugely oversized [[carp]] was found swimming. Local Buddhists began to believe that the fish was a [[reincarnation]] of one of [[Gautama Buddha]]’s disciples. As pilgrimages to the pond grew larger and more frequent, so did disquiet among the district chief and his officials, who answered to [[Ngo Dinh Can|Ngô Đình Cẩn]], younger brother of Diệm. The pond was mined, but the fish swam on unhindered. After raking the pond with machine gun fire, the fish still lived. To deal with the problem, Tùng's forces were called in. The pond was grenaded, killing the carp. The incident generated more publicity as newspapers across the world ran stories about the miraculous fish. South Vietnamese army helicopters began landing at the site, with ARVN paratroopers filling their bottles with water which they believed had magical powers.<ref>Prochnau, p. 411.</ref>

Tùng also headed a group run by the CIA, in which ARVN personnel of northern origin were sent into [[North Vietnam]] posing as locals, in order to gather intelligence as well as sabotaging communist infrastructure and communications. They were trained in bases at [[Nha Trang]], [[Da Nang|Đà Nẵng]] and sometimes offshore in [[Taiwan]], [[Guam]] and [[Okinawa]]. Of the eighty groups of operatives, numbering six or seven per group, that were deployed in 1963 via parachute drops or night time sampan journeys, nearly all were captured or killed. Those who were captured were often used for propaganda by communist broadcasting authorities. Tùng was heavily criticised for his management of the operations.<ref>Karnow, p. 378.</ref><ref name="encyc"/>

He was reported to have been planning an operation at the request of Nhu to stage a government organised student demonstration outside the US Embassy. In this plan, Tùng's men would assassinate ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], other key officials and the Buddhist leader, [[Thich Tri Quang]], who had been given asylum there after being targeted in the pagoda raids. The plan reportedly would have seen Tùng's men burn down the embassy.<ref>Jones, p. 393.</ref>

== Coup and assassination ==
{{seealso|1963 South Vietnamese coup|Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem}}
In September, when Diệm and Nhu knew of a concrete plan by a group of generals were planning a coup, Nhu ordered Tùng and [[Ton That Dinh|Tôn Thất Đính]], another loyalist general who commanded the [[Saigon]] region, to plan a fake "coup" against the government by loyalist soldiers disguised as insurgents. This was to be followed by a fake "counter-coup", whereupon Tùng's Special Forces, having left Saigon on the pretext of fighting communists, as well as Đính's forces would triumphantly re-enter Saigon to reaffirm the Diệm regime.<ref name="karnow"/><ref name="encyc"/>

[[Image:Diem dead.jpg|The body of Diệm in the back of the APC, having been executed on the way to military headquarters.|thumb|left|150px]]
Nhu and Tùng were unaware that Đính was part of the coup, and agreed to send his four Special Forces companies north out of Saigon on October 29. On November 1, Tùng was summoned to the military headquarters at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]] by the organisers of the coup, on the pretext of a routine officer's meeting. At 13:30, General [[Tran Van Don]] announced that a coup was taking place. All but Tùng rose to applaud, who was taken away by [[Nguyen Van Nhung|Nguyễn Văn Nhung]], the bodyguard of General [[Duong Van Minh|Dương Văn Minh]], another of the coup plotters. As he was lead away, he shouted "Remember who gave you your stars!".<ref name="karnow"/><ref name="encyc"/>

At 16:45, Tùng was forced at gunpoint to tell his men to surrender and tell Diệm that he and his men had been captured. At nightfall he was taken with his brother, hands tied, into a jeep and driven to edge of the airport. They were made to kneel over two freshly dug holes, shot into them and buried.<ref>Jones, p. 414.</ref> The coup turned out to be successful, and on the following morning, Diệm and Nhu were captured and executed.<ref name="karnow"/><ref name="encyc"/>
