The '''Mexican redknee tarantula''' (''Brachypelma smithi'') is a [[species]] of burrowing [[tarantula]] native to [[Mexico]], but might be found in small numbers in neighboring countries. They are among the most popular tarantulas available in the [[pet]] trade, due to their impressive size and striking coloration. A similar terrestrial tarantula is named Mexican Painted Redleg ("Brachypelma emilia").

==Description==
[[Image:Brachypelma Smithii.jpg|thumb|left|Female]]
The mature Mexican redknee tarantula has a dark-colored body with orange patches on the joints of its legs; the second element of the legs (the [[trochanter]]) is [[orange (colour)|orange]]-[[red]]. Following moulting, the colors are more pronounced. The dark portion is very [[black]] while the orange-red portions will be far more on the reddish side.

An adult female has a body roughly 4 inches (10cm) long, with a legspan of 6–7 inches (15 to 18&nbsp;cm), and a weight of approximately 15 to 16 grams, and usually contains large amount of venom.

==Diet==
In the wild, they will consume almost any kind of [[arthropod]], small [[lizard]], or small [[rodent]] that they can overpower and immobilize with their [[venom]]. In captivity, baby spiders have to be fed with small flies like ''[[Drosophila]]''. When they are around half a centimeter in size, one can switch to small [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s. Adults like to eat large insects ([[grasshopper]]s) or [[mouse|mice]], but large meals are often enough to sustain the tarantula for several months before it needs to eat again.

==Behavior==
A tarantula moults (sheds its skin) when the skin is too small. After moulting, it will emerge from its [[exoskeleton]], leaving the old skin behind, often fully intact, and almost looking like a second spider. They are also capable of kicking what are called [[urticating hair]]s from the rear of their abdomen. These hairs are irritating to the skin, causing itching and sometimes blistering. If they are introduced to the eye, they can cause damage to the vision.

==In captivity==
The Mexican redknee is a mostly docile species. That, coupled with its coloration, makes it a very popular pet species. An enclosure measuring approx. 30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm (11.8 in × 11.8 in × 11.8 in) is adequate to house them. They can be kept on a substrate of fairly dry [[peat]], sometimes mixed with [[vermiculite]]. Being a terrestrial species, the substrate should be fairly deep, though ''B. smithi'' is not typically known for its [[burrow]]ing. It will instead often make use of a provided hide area, like a [[terra cotta]] flower pot half buried in the substrate. Live plants are typically discouraged from tarantula enclosures, as they can often attract [[pest (organism)|pest insects]].

Feeding is easily accomplished with commercially available crickets, 2–3 per week for an adult. If keeping a younger tarantula in captivity, feed them the same insects 3-4 times per week. They will also eat other easily catchable insects, such as [[mealworm]]s, [[locust]]s, or [[waxworm]]s. Water can be provided in a shallow non-metallic dish.
