'''Magnétophone''' are an [[electronic music|electronic]] / [[art-rock]] band originating from [[Birmingham]] [[United Kingdom|UK]], comprised of Matt Huish Saunders (b. [[1972]]) and John Hanson (b. [[1973]]). Since their inception in the mid-[[nineties]] they have released two [[albums]], ''I Guess Sometimes I Need To Be Reminded Of How Much You Love Me'' and ''[[The Man Who Ate the Man]]'', plus numerous singles and [[EP]]s and are currently signed to the revered art-house [[record label]] [[4AD]]. Magnétophone rose to international recognition out of a period of vibrant musical activity in the second city, which also spawned contemporaries [[Broadcast (band)|Broadcast]]. 

== Biography ==
Matt Huish Saunders and John Hanson formed Magnétophone in [[1995]] after they met at an art school on the outskirts of Birmingham in [[1992]]. Their respective formative journeys toward their first gig together followed similar lines in that they both played in [[Rock music|rock]]-influenced live bands.

Huish Saunders began experimenting with keyboards and computer soundchips ([[C64]] SID chip in particular) around [[1986]], composing instrumental three voice music and [[sound effects]]. Inspired by [[rock'n'roll]] and the possibilities of audio 'art', in 1989 he took up his 'neighbour's neglected guitar' and began forming bands in the style of the [[Beatles]] and [[Led Zeppelin]], playing pubs and clubs around [[Birmingham]] city centre.

Hanson's first steps into music also began in the mid-[[eighties]], and at the local community centre playing [[drums]] in the basement, in drop-in style workshops. Later, he discovered [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and his 'first love', the [[Bass guitar|bass]], and went on to form bands also playing [[Led Zeppelin]]esque tracks.

Despite the similarity of their respective bands their paths didn't cross until [[1992]] when they enrolled on an art course at Solihull College. Here, they developed a friendship, sharing their enthusiasm for [[Spacemen 3]], [[Suicide]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Talk Talk]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Woody Allen]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]] and [[photography]]. At this time, both their bands simultaneously began to disintegrate leading them to form their own forward-looking experimental outfit 'Rocket Science'.

'Rocket Science's' first gig was at The Jug of Ale in [[Moseley]], [[Birmingham]]. The duo played simple [[FM synthesis]] keyboards put through numerous [[guitar]] [[effects pedals]], acoustic guitar, [[bass guitar]] and various [[tone generators]] and used a four-track recorder to play back a combination of processed [[found sounds]], [[film dialogue]], and distorted [[breakbeats]]. Their music at this early stage was instrumental and often repetitive, recalling the sounds of early [[techno]]-[[Ambient music|ambient]] albums by [[Aphex Twin]], and the lush washes and zen-cycling of [[Brian Eno|Eno]]. Performing music that required a certain level of calm and concentration on the part of the audience brought with it certain concerns: 
"''We were finding that the quieter tracks were getting talked over to the point where you'd feel like you may as well stop and get up and go to the bar with them. We found to get around this, we had to make our beats and sounds louder and fiercer, so it was harder to talk over''."

Magnetophone's music was at odds with the [[Brit Pop]] '[[Indie (music)|indie]]' guitar bands that predominated in the second city's venues; consequently, from [[1998]]-[[1999]] Huish Saunders and Hanson organised and promoted their own night of 'alternative' music. These 'events' took place at a venue on the banks of the central canal at the heart of the city, and the pair named them 'We Brought Our Friends'. Soon the shows gathered momentum and reputation and became known as the only reliable live resource of local (and later national) experimental bands: "''There was nowhere you could hear something other than [[Brit Pop]] or [[Metal]], so we put on our own shows and booked the bands we wanted to play with''."

During this time, the duo sent out demos to record labels, and one in particular caught the attention of London label Earworm Records. 'You Should Write Music' backed by 'Monitor Rocket Science' became the band's first 7" single, and prompted the change of name from Rocket Science to Magnétophone.

This first single was met with great enthusiasm by the press, and by fellow musicians, including [[Spacemen 3]]'s Sonic Boom who met the band at a 'We Brought Our Friends' show and later worked and performed with them. A series of other singles, 12"s, and compilations followed, and a long term relationship with Static Caravan Recordings began.

The records between [[1998]] and [[2000]] showed the basis of the Magnétophone sound to be rooted in the [[electronic music|electronic]] field, but it was also moving outside of it as its 'organic-ness' and obvious human intervention and performance appeared to be informed by guitar bands like [[My Bloody Valentine]] and [[MC5]], and it is this that separates them from other [[electronica]] records of the same period and which caught the attention of 4AD's [[A&R]] department. These records were still instrumental and took in elements of [[drum'n'bass]], [[intelligent dance music|IDM]], [[Ambient music|ambient]]-[[techno]] and [[avant-garde]] [[sound sculpting]], and were tied together by strong, though sometimes hidden or intermittent melodies. The pieces were performed live and captured as whole performances, rather than being multi-tracked. [[John Peel]] was an ardent supporter of the band's output at this time and they recorded two Peel sessions, one at the [[BBC]] Maida Vale Studios, and one at the Irish Centre in a live performance in [[Birmingham]] in [[2000]].

In March [[2000]], the band completed their debut lp 'I Guess Sometimes I Need To Be Reminded Of How Much You Love Me', which was subsequently released by 4AD (where they remain signed today) to great critical acclaim in some quarters, and bemused misunderstanding in others. The [[BBC]] used one of the tracks from this album, 'So Much As Hold My Hand', on their [[World Service]] as the theme music for links between programmes and news bulletins. Their work since this LP has included collaborations with [[Kim Deal]] and [[Kelley Deal]], [[King Creosote]], [[James Yorkston]], [[Mountain Goats]] and [[Peter Kember|Sonic Boom]]. In [[2004]], Magnétophone's track 'Kel's Vintage Thought', co-written with [[The Breeders]]' [[Kelley Deal]], was voted by listeners of [[BBC 6 Music]] as the Rebel Playlist winner on the [[Steve Lamacq]] show. Their second lp, 'The Man Who Ate The Man', was released in 2005 and was voted best avant-[[post rock]] lp of [[2005]] by [[Piccadilly Records]]. Shortly after its release, in late [[2005]], Magnétophone recorded a session for [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''Blue Room<!--LINK=DAB-->'' show at the Maida Vale Studios, and for [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Rob da Bank]] show, both broadcast in [[November 2005]].

== The Magnétophone sound ==

Magnétophone's records reference a number of different influences from [[Silver Apples]], [[Suicide]], [[My Bloody Valentine]] and [[Spacemen 3]], to [[The Human League]], [[Talk Talk]], and [[Velvet Underground]]. However, one is not more apparent than the other and their music is more accurately a mixture of genres rather than bands: [[psychedelia]], [[electronica]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[synth pop]], [[post-rock]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], [[Pop music|pop]].  Their sound is a meeting of  the broken and organic and the beautiful and systematised, and the progression of their sound through their eleven year career, spans dysfunctional electronic instrumental pieces, to 'bewitching, mysterious' city-folk songs.

Magnétophone's melodies, whether sung or played on an instrument, are supported by dirty, scratchy synths, solid [[electro (music)|electro]] and acoustic [[breaks]], detuning guitars and sonic 'artefacts' that blink-in and out of the audio picture-frame seemingly at random. [[Tape hiss]], projector clicks, fireworks, fragments of human voices move around sometimes [[contrapuntal]], sometimes [[Monophony|monophonic]] arrangements. The [[time signatures]] are generally [[4/4]] or [[6/8]]. 

The [[lyrics]] of The Man Who Ate The Man are more [[poetic]] than [[rock'n'roll]] inspired, and concern city relationships (''Benny's Insobriety'' and ''Without Word'') or similar, but set against a rural backdrop (''A Sad Ha Ha (Circled My Demise)'' and ''The Only Witching You'll be Doing''). The themes explore control, loss, reverence, worth, relationship-pacts.

Much of Magnétophone's music from the early singles to the first [[Gramophone record|LP]] is notable for its 'challenging' nature (the pounding, broken, distorted [[beats]] and unrecognisable [[Bassline|bass]] textures of 'I Hear Blonde Falcons' being a case-in-point), and it is clear that the band at this stage were often concerned with creating original audio 'objects' that have questionable worth outside of pure abstract appreciation; other tracks from this time more clearly reference [[rock'n'roll]]'s more simple appeal, and the balancing of these two ethics across a record creates a unique and unsettling audio and emotional experience. 

Throughout Magnétophone's recorded output, the listener will hear sonic experimentation in the form of mis-firing beats, sliding time frames, processed acoustic [[field recordings]], minute background 'happenings' and [[synthesis]] manipulation and these are generally presented in 'alternative' song structures. However, their most recent LP 'The Man Who Ate The Man' exhibits the sonic exploration of their early work, whilst also employing traditional acoustic instruments including [[guitar]], [[drums]] and [[melodica]], [[Anglo]]-[[folk music|folk]] vocal lines and song structures approaching the 'conventional'.

''Whichever way a Magnétophone track is leaning in terms of its 'influence' or 'style', there is a tangible thread of intelligent and careful boundary-searching and maverick but conscientious sound construction through it; and always towards the end of creating a slightly uncomfortable environment for a ''proper'' song to play out in. Somehow, like [[Francis Bacon]]'s 'snail trail of human presence' being evident in a painting, Magnétophone's music quietly announces that they have attended there, whilst suggesting it was perhaps other people.''

Magnétophone's albums, 7"s and 12"s are visually impressive objects. The band state, "''we want our sleeves to be equally as exciting as the music they represent''", and to this end, they have presented their music in a variety of quality art 'packages'. The very first single, 'You Should Write Music' consisted of a red [[audiophile]]-weight [[vinyl]] 7", with a matching textured sleeve and a single white sticker, containing the band name and track titles. Their work with [[V23]]'s design-icon [[Vaughan Oliver]] and photographer/designer [[Chris Bigg]] has produced some unique sleeves, from the three-quarter cut-sleeved, double vinyl lp of 'I Guess Sometimes...', to the [[laser]] cut aluminium [[phonograph|turntable]] pillar-disc that accompanied the [[CD]] version of the same [[Gramophone record|LP]], to the high quality cardboard, gate-folding [[digipack]] of 'The Man Who Ate The Man' which contained eight small double-sided cards, printed with domestic interior images and cryptic phrases.
