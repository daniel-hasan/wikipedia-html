'''''Crazy Taxi''''' is a series of [[score attack]] [[racing]] [[video game]]s that was developed by [[Hitmaker]] and published by [[Sega]].  The first game appeared in [[Video arcade|arcades]] in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]] and was very successful, prompting Sega to port the [[arcade game|arcade version]] to their [[Dreamcast]] console in [[2000 in video gaming|2000]]. It was the [[List of best selling computer and video games#Sega Dreamcast|fourth best-selling game]] on the Dreamcast, selling over a million copies.<ref name="us pt vg chart"/> The game was later ported to the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Personal Computer|PC]] with sequels also appearing on the [[Microsoft Xbox]], [[Game Boy Advance]], and [[PlayStation Portable]] systems.

Each game has the player assume the role of a [[taxicab|taxi]] driver who must accumulate money by delivering passengers to their destinations in the fastest time possible, earning tips by performing "crazy stunts" before the time runs out. The franchise has been recognized for its innovative gameplay design which is easy to learn but difficult to master, its use of unobtrusive [[in-game advertising]], and its soundtrack music provided by the bands [[The Offspring]] and [[Bad Religion]].<ref name="ign dc review"/> The core gameplay mechanic has been [[patent]]ed by Sega,<ref name="patent"/> which has led to at least one [[lawsuit]] over similar gameplay in ''[[The Simpsons: Road Rage]]'' game which has since been settled out of court.<ref name="legal settle"/>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Crazy taxi pickup.jpg|right|thumb|The player picks up a passenger in ''Crazy Taxi''. The image of the passenger's destination is shown to the left, while another potential passenger is shown in the background (with a "$" symbol over their head)]]
[[Image:Crazy taxi ride.jpg|right|thumb|The player follows the on-screen arrow to deliver the passenger to their destination before the main time (upper left) and the passenger timer (green number in center) runs out. The player can earn extra tip by pulling off "crazy" stunts]]
''Crazy Taxi'' and its sequels are [[score attack]] games that all employ the same fundamental rules and mechanics. The player controls one of several taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and then taking them to their destination in the fastest time possible.  The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock.  Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination.  The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time.  Furthermore, a second countdown timer is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination.  While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player's [[heads-up display|HUD]] that points in the general direction of the passenger's destination to help guide the player through the map.<ref name="gamecritics dc review"/>

The player can use special "crazy stunt" moves such as drifts, jumps, and near-misses, and consecutive combos of these, to earn extra money from the passenger during the trip. If the destination is reached in time, the player is paid based on the distance driven with a possible time bonus based on how quickly the destination was reached. If the passenger's countdown drops to zero, they will exit the taxi and the player will be required to look for another fare. The game continues in this mode as long as time remains on the gameplay clock. Once this clock reaches zero, the game is over, and the player is ranked and rated based on the total earned.<ref name="gamecritics dc review"/>  

Unlike other arcade games, the player cannot continue from where the previous game ended. The game cannot be played indefinitely: while there are hundreds of potential passengers to pick up and deliver, there are only a limited number of fares in the game.  The various passengers scattered throughout the city will randomly appear and disappear throughout the game, but once one is picked up that passenger is unavailable for the rest of that game. The core gameplay in the series has been praised as being "deceptively complex";<ref name="ign dc review"/><ref name="gamecritics dc review">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamecritics.com/review/crazytaxi/main.php | title = Crazy Taxi | publisher = GameCritics | date = [[2000-02-19]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15 | first = Chi Kong |last = Lui}}</ref> as stated by the IGN staff for their review of the Dreamcast version of ''Crazy Taxi'':<ref name="ign dc review">{{cite web | url = http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/162/162006p1.html | title = Crazy Taxi | publisher = IGN | author = IGN Staff | date = [[2000-01-28]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15 }}</ref>
{{cquotetxt|As you progress through the game's ratings scale by picking up and delivering passengers as quickly as possible, you will slowly but surely realize that there is much, much more to the game than getting from point a to b.|IGN Staff|Crazy Taxi (Dreamcast) Review}}

Starting with ''Crazy Taxi 2'', the gameplay included the ability to pick up a party of passengers, each having a different destination. The number of passengers in the car multiplies the tip bonuses earned from stunt driving, while the total fare can only be earned once the last passenger is dropped off in time.<ref name="gamespot ct2 review"/>  Additionally, ''Crazy Taxi 2'' introduced a new stunt move called the "Crazy Hop" that allowed the player to make the taxi jump to clear some obstacles or reach higher drivable surfaces.

The console games have also featured a set of mini-games that require the player to meet a certain objective using one or more of the various "crazy stunts" within the game.  Some of these test the player's handling of a taxi, while others are more exaggerated, such as taxi [[bowling]] or [[pocket billiards|pool]]. Some mini-games require the completion of others before they can be accessed.

==Development==
The original arcade game was developed by Hitmaker as a variation from then-current arcade titles.  ''Crazy Taxi'' producer Kenji Kanno noted that the time extension on gameplay was a breakaway of the current "100 yen for 3 minutes" that persisted at the time for arcade games, and rewarded players with longer playing times by performing well in the game.<ref name="kenji kanno interview">{{cite web | url = http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/074/074863p1.html | title = The "Crazy" Interview with SoJ's Kenji Kanno | publisher = IGN | author = IGN Staff | date = [[2000-02-04]] | accessdate = 2007-08-17}}</ref>  In addition to providing a game that could be played in short sessions, Kanno wanted a game to explore the "daily life and routine" of a taxi driver.<ref name="ign video interview kanno">{{cite web | url = http://media.psp.ign.com/media/875/875970/vids_1.html | title = Video interview with Kenji Kanno | publisher = IGN | date = [[2007-08-03]] | accessdate = 2007-10-31}}</ref> In the development of the Dreamcast version of the original arcade game, the developers included a larger map in addition to the arcade one, as to create a feeling of "being lost" and allowing home console players to have fun "learning the town".<ref name="kenji kanno interview"/> Mini-games were developed for this version as to "let the player play longer if he improve<nowiki>[d]</nowiki> skill" by offering challenges that were both fun and educational. Over one hundred different ideas for mini-games were developed by the team but then pared down for the Crazy Box mini-game challenges for the game.<ref name="kenji kanno interview"/> The addition of the Crazy Hop in ''Crazy Taxi 2'' came about because the development team noted that "...in New York - where the basic landscape is quite flat - we had to create 3D space by letting the player drive on the buildings" and "We added the Crazy Hop to let the player hop around the roofs of buildings to make short cuts".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=2145 | title = Crazy Taxi 2 Preview | publisher = CVG | date = [[2001-08-01]] | accessdate =2007-10-31}}</ref>  

Hitmaker had tried to develop an on-line version of ''Crazy Taxi'', to be called ''Crazy Taxi Next'' exclusively for the Xbox, which, besides multiplayer game modes, would have included night and day cycles, each with a different set of passengers and destinations, while reusing and graphically updating the maps from ''Crazy Taxi'' and ''Crazy Taxi 2''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/095/095663p1.html | title = SEGA Unleashed Interviews | date = [[2001-06-08]] | accessdate = 2007-10-31 | publisher = IGN | author = IGN Staff}}</ref>  Ultimately, both multiplayer and day/night cycles were dropped and work on ''Crazy Taxi Next'' was transferred to ''Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller'', which included some of the nighttime driving concepts suggested by ''Next''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://xbox.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r19392.htm | title = Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller Review | date = [[2002-08-14]] | publisher = GameZone | first = Louis | last = Bedigian | accessdate = 2007-10-31 }}</ref> 

Kenji Kanno has noted that the gameplay in the ''Crazy Taxi'' series has otherwise not "evolved" with each new game "because basically the whole point of the game is to have a lot of fun in a short period of time, and it's a very concentrated game. So instead of trying to evolve the series necessarily, it's more like taking that concept and putting it in different places&mdash;seeing how it works."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3158197 | title = Previews: Crazy Taxi: FW | last = Leone | first = Matt | date = [[2007-03-22]] | accessdate = 2007-08-17 | publisher = 1up}}</ref>

===Setting===
Through the series, the cities used within the ''Crazy Taxi'' games have been influenced by real-world cities, including [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Certain versions of the ''Crazy Taxi'' game include in-game counterparts of real-world businesses, including [[Pizza Hut]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Fila (company)|FILA]], and [[Tower Records]];<ref name="gamespot early">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/dreamcast/driving/crazytaxi/news.html?sid=2451687&mode=all | title = Driving Crazy Taxi | first = James | last = Mielke | date = [[1999-04-21]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15 | publisher = Gamespot }}</ref> these were often destination targets for the passengers. Although this is one of the most prominent examples of [[product placement]] in video gaming history, it is generally looked upon relatively favorably amongst gamers, perhaps because it gives a sense of realism to the fictional cities in the game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/172/book_excerpt_game_design_.php?page=3 | title = Book Excerpt: Game Design Complete: Advergaming and Sponsorships | publisher = Game Career Guide | first = Patrick | last = O'Luanaigh | date = [[2006-04-06]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref> These establishments have been replaced with generic businesses in later games due to licensing difficulties.<ref name="catch a ride interview">{{cite web | url = http://gameboy.gamezone.com/news/03_26_03_05_29PM.htm | title = Catch a ride in full 3D with “Crazy Taxi” for Game Boy Advance | publisher = GameZone | first = Louis | last = Bedigian | accessdate = 2007-08-17}}</ref>

===Soundtrack===
The soundtrack of the ''Crazy Taxi'' series has typically been licensed [[hard rock]] and [[punk rock]] music. The arcade and initial home console versions include selections from punk rock bands [[The Offspring]] and [[Bad Religion]], though these have been removed in both the GameBoy Advance and the PlayStation Portable remakes because of licensing issues.<ref name="catch a ride interview"/>  In the case of the GameBoy Advance ''Catch a Ride'', the game uses instrumental music instead of recorded songs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://gameboy.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r20420_GBA.htm | title = Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride Review | publisher = Game Zone | date = [[2003-06-05]] | first = Eduardo | last = Zacarias | accessdate = 2007-08-24}}</ref>

The console/home version of ''Crazy Taxi'' was released for the Dreamcast on [[January 24]], [[2000]]. The Dreamcast and the cabinet arcade version share nearly identical processing hardware, and porting the game to the home console was only made difficult due to the limited internal memory size on the Dreamcast.<ref name="kenji kanno interview"/><ref name="hardcore gaming"/><ref name="gamespot early"/> Sega used ''Crazy Taxi'' to show off the power of the Dreamcast's graphical processor,<ref name="hardcore gaming"/> capable of maintaining 60 [[Frame rate|fps]] throughout play.<ref name="ign dc review"/> In addition to the arcade map, this version included the Los Angeles-themed city (entitled "Original"), as well as additional mini-games ("Crazy Box") that can be used to hone the player's taxi handling skills. The new map, much larger than the arcade version, was designed let the player experience the feeling of "being lost" and allow for exploration, something that could not be done on the arcade version, as well letting "the player enjoy all 3 dimensions."<ref name="kenji kanno interview"/>

This version is fundamentally the same as the ''Crazy Taxi'' console versions, featuring the San Francisco and Los Angeles-themed maps but with a smaller selection of mini-games, adapted to play on the portable device using the Graphics State "Rush" engine.<ref name="catch a ride interview"/> Specifically, while the city and streets are rendered using 3D graphics, the taxi, passengers, and other traffic are represented by [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s in order to work on the limited GBA hardware.<ref name="ign ctcar review">{{cite web | url = http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/392/392905p1.html | title = Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride | publisher = IGN | author = IGN Staff | date = [[2003-04-08]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref>  Richard Whittall, creative director for Graphics State, noted that ''Catch A Ride'' was "about the most technically challenging game you could do on a handheld machine" at the time of its release.<ref name="catch a ride interview"/>

''Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars'' was developed by Sniper Studios with support of members of original Hitmaker ''Crazy Taxi'' design team in Japan<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.seganerds.com/2007/02/23/exclusive-interview-jeff-hasson-sniper-studios/ | title = Exclusive interview: Jeff Hasson, Sniper Studios | date = [[2007-02-23]] | publisher = Sega Nerds | accessdate 2007-08-19}}</ref> and released for the PlayStation Portable on [[August 7]], [[2007]]. The game effectively is a port of both ''Crazy Taxi'' and ''Crazy Taxi 2'' to this system without any changes to the gameplay,<ref name="ign fare wars interview"/> but lacking the in-game advertising and the original soundtracks. While the game includes its own soundtrack, the player can use their own music stored on the PSP; as noted by Jeff Hasson of Sniper Studios, "for those hard core fans that must have The Offspring playing, they have that option with the Custom Music Player."<ref name="ign fare wars interview">{{cite web | url = http://psp.ign.com/articles/811/811286p1.html | title = Crazy Taxi Talk | publisher = IGN | author = IGN Cars | date = [[2007-08-07]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref> The player can also record up to a minute of gameplay footage that can then be shared with friends. The game includes a multiplayer feature over the PSP's ad-hoc wireless system, allowing players to vie for fares within the same map, including the ability to steal passengers from another player.<ref>{{cite press release | title = The Fare Frenzy Returns With SEGA's Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars For The PSP® System | publisher = Games Press | date = [[2007-01-11]] | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=22164 | accessdate = 2007-08-15 }}</ref> Multiplayer games such as [[time trial]]s or "C-R-A-Z-Y" runs (a variation of the game "[[Horse (game)|Horse]]") can also be played sharing a common PSP, with each player taking turns within the game.<ref name="ign farewars review"/>

The original Dreamcast version ''Crazy Taxi'' was one of the best-selling games for the console. The game was the second largest selling Dreamcast game in the United States in [[2000 in video gaming|2000]], selling nearly 750,000 units,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-BestSellUS.shtml | title = US Top 10 Best Selling Console Games in 2000 | publisher = The Magicbox | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref> and sold over 1 million units in the United States to be the 4th best selling game overall for the system.<ref name="us pt vg chart">{{cite web | url = http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-USPlatinum.shtml | title = US Platinum Videogame Chart | publisher = The Magicbox | accessdate =2007-08-15}}</ref> The game was praised for capturing the arcade flavor, and possibly exceeding it by making the controls and execution of the crazy stunts easier to execute.<ref name="ign dc review"/>  The game did suffer from "pop-up" due to limited [[draw distance]]s, and loss of frame rate when a large number of cars were on the screen.<ref name="planet dreamcast review"/><ref name="ign dc review"/>  Critics noted the lack of depth given that it was a port of an arcade game, some difficulties with the destination arrow, and the poor "[[Wolfman Jack]]" impersonation of the in-game announcer.<ref name="planet dreamcast review">{{cite web | url = http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/reviews/crazytaxi/ | title = Crazy Taxi review | author = Fragmaster | publisher = Planet Dreamcast | accessdate =2007-10-03}}</ref><ref name="ign dc review"/> 

''Crazy Taxi 2'' was well received by reviewers with the new features helping to expand play from the original game, though some thought that more drastic changes could have been made in the sequel.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/166/166110p1.html | title = Crazy Taxi 2 | publisher = IGN | author = IGN Staff | date = [[2001-05-29]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref><ref name="gamespot ct2 review"/> Despite the addition of new maps, the lack of new gameplay elements caused ''Crazy Taxi 3'' to be panned by reviewers.<ref name="gamespot ct3 review"/> IGN noted in its review for ''Crazy Taxi 3'' that "It's clear that the creative vibrancy that first imagined the Taxi series has waned considerably."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://xbox.ign.com/articles/365/365542p1.html | title = Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller Review | publisher = IGN | date = [[2002-07-22]] | first =Hilary | last = Goldstein | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref>

The ports of the original game to the PS2 and GameCube platforms are not considered as strong as the Dreamcast game. Both were noted to suffer from more "pop-up" than the Dreamcast version, as well as poorer controls, despite having the same gameplay features.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/driving/crazytaxi/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review | title = Crazy Taxi PS2 Review | publisher = Gamespot | first = Jeff | last = Gerstmann | date = [[2001-05-08]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/driving/crazytaxi/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review | title = Crazy Taxi GameCube Review | publisher = Gamespot | first = Jeff | last = Gerstmann | date = [[2001-11-20]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref> Graphic problems plagued the ''Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride'' port to the Gameboy Advance; as IGN stated, "it's painfully obvious that the hardware just was never meant to push so much."<ref name="ign ctcar review"/> Both PC ports for ''Crazy Taxi'' and ''Crazy Taxi 3'' also suffered from graphics problems.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/driving/crazytaxi/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review | title = Crazy Taxi PC Review | publisher = Gamespot | last = Park | first = Andrew | date = [[2002-10-14]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/crazytaxi3highroller.phtml | title= Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller Review (PC) | publisher = Action Trip | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref>

The PSP ports of ''Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars'' have had a somewhat better reception than other ports. Reviews have complimented the game on the multiplayer additions and the ability to add a custom soundtrack &ndash; which led IGN to comment that "Including this should be a no-brainer, but many PSP titles don't" &ndash; but have noted some graphical glitches, the long loading times, and the lack of the original soundtracks for the games.<ref name="ign farewars review">{{cite web | url = http://psp.ign.com/articles/811/811969p2.html | title = Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars Review | publisher = IGN | date = [[2007-08-07]] | first = Greg | last = Miller | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamer20.com/gamehub/crazy-taxi-fare-wars-psp/review/1051 | title = Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars | publisher = Gamer 2.0 | first= Chris | last=Selogy | date =2007-08-08 |accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref>  The reviews of the controls of the game have mixed, with some praising the scheme on the PSP,<ref name="ign farewars review"/> while others have stated that the controls feel stiff and inconsistent.<ref name="gamespot farewars review"/>  Gamespot's review noted that the gameplay in ''Crazy Taxi'' does not hold up well compared to more recent racing games across various platforms.<ref name="gamespot farewars review">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/crazytaxifarewars/review.html | title = Crazy Taxi; Fare Wars review | publisher= Gamespot | first = Alex | last = Navarro | date =2007-08-22 | accessdate = 2007-08-29}}</ref>

==Beyond video games==
[[Image:Crazy Taxi-A Redemption Game.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Crazy Taxi'' Redemption Game arcade cabinet.]]
Sega has attempted to branch the ''Crazy Taxi'' franchise beyond the realm of video games, with varied results.

In addition to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a ''Crazy Taxi'' themed [[redemption game]] which was released in [[2003 in video gaming|2003]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.segaarcade.com/archive/crazytaxiredemption.aspx | title = Crazy Taxi Redemption Game | publisher = Sega Enterprises, Inc. | accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref> The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi model in the center of the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the far end. Passengers were worth different points, from which the operator would then set the amount of tickets to be won. The game incorporated music and sounds from the video games.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.segaarcade.com/pdfs/crazytaxiredemption/ctr-brochure.pdf | title = Crazy Taxi Redemption Brochure | type = PDF | accessdate = 2007-08-15 | publisher= Sega Enterprises, Inc. }}</ref>

There have been two attempts to create a movie based on the ''Crazy Taxi'' franchise. In [[2001 in video gaming|2001]], Goodman-Rosen Productions acquired the rights for the movie, with [[Richard Donner]] lined up to direct the film.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/dreamcast/driving/crazytaxi2/news.html?sid=2781980&om_act=convert&om_clk=gsupdates&tag=updates;title;2 | title = Richard Donner to direct Crazy Taxi film | publisher = Gamespot | date = [[2001-07-02]] | first = Shahed | last = Ahmed | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}</ref> Donner had stated "I loved playing 'Crazy Taxi,' and I realized immediately that it had the potential to be a big summer event movie."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thestandard.com/article/0,1902,27684,00.html | title = 'Crazy Taxi' Deal Marks Another Turn for Sega | publisher = The Industry Standard | date = [[2001-07-03]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15 | last = Li | first = Kenneth }}</ref> The movie would have been tied with other merchandise items such as t-shirts and toys, according to Jane Thompson, director of licensing for Sega of America.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/dreamcast/driving/crazytaxi2/news.html?sid=2782908&om_act=convert&om_clk=gsupdates&tag=updates;title;1 | title = Sega provides perspective on the upcoming Crazy Taxi film | date = [[2001-07-05]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15 | first = Shahed | last = Ahmed }}</ref> However, this initial attempt stalled due to an "absence of plot elements" according to Movie Insider.<ref name="movie insider">{{cite web | url = http://www.themovieinsider.com/n92-crazy-taxi-gets-budget-and-production-schedule.html | title = 'Crazy Taxi' Gets Budget and Production Schedule | publisher = Movie Insider | date = [[2002-08-10]] | accessdate = 2007-08-15 }}</ref> After this option expired, Mindfire Entertainment acquired the rights to a ''Crazy Taxi'' movie based on the game franchise in [[2002 in video gaming|2002]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/driving/crazytaxi3highroller/news_2876646.html | title = Crazy Taxi movie in the works | publisher = Gamespot | date = [[2002-08-06]] | accessdate = 2007-08-14 | first = Jeff | last = Gerstmann }}</ref> with an expected release date in mid-[[2003 in video gaming|2003]].<ref name="movie insider"/> However, since then, no further news on the film has been forthcoming.<ref name="hardcore gaming">{{cite web | url = http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/crazytaxi/crazytaxi.htm | title = Crazy Taxi | author = Paul G. | publisher = Hardcore Gaming | accessdate = 2007-08-14 }}</ref>
