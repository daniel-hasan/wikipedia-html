'''Hillsong Music''' is [[Christian]] music produced by [[Hillsong Church]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] as well as offshoot churches, [[Hillsong London]] and Hillsong Kiev. Hillsong albums are released and distributed by '''Hillsong Music Australia''', the resource arm of Hillsong Church.

==History==

Hillsong Church's popularity in Christian praise and worship music stems from the inauguration of the [[Hillsong Conference]] in the late 1980s and the first publication of choruses written by Hills CLC members, especially [[Darlene Zschech]]. Their first live worship CD ''[[The Power of Your Love]]'' was released in 1992. Since then, live praise and worship albums have been produced each year. Other music series include the ''Worship series'', ''United'', ''Youth Alive'', ''Hillsong Kids'' and ''Instrumental series''. They have also released two Christmas albums and several compilation albums.<ref>http://www.hillsong.com/music/page.php?jssCart=999741b65eeda1cd8f356bab41cd1a25&xPage=about.html</ref>

==Worship leaders==
{{main|Hillsong musicians}}
Worship Pastor [[Darlene Zschech]] is perhaps the most well-known worship leader in Hillsong. She is the composer of the famous worship song "[[Shout to the Lord]]". Zschech became worship leader after [[Geoff Bullock]] resigned. Bullock had composed most of Hillsong's early songs in the late 1980s and early 1990s. [[Russell Fragar]], former Music Director, played a large part in producing early Hillsong albums until leaving Hillsong Church for [[Virginia]], [[United States|USA]] in 2001. Other prominent worship leaders include [[Reuben Morgan]], who rose to fame for his song ''I Give You My Heart'' and [[Marty Sampson]] who was integral in the success of early [[Hillsong United (band)|Hillsong United]] albums. Recently [[Joel Houston]], son of Brian and Bobbie Houston, has become a main worship leader after writing the popular song "Everyday". 

Darlene Zschech explained Hillsong's stance in her book ''Extravagant Worship''. She writes the Hillsong team pray ''"Father, let them quickly get their eyes off of us. We just want to point them to you, God, because you are the Author of truth. You are the only One who is to be praised."''

==Popularity==
''People Just Like Us'' was the first ever Christian album to go Gold in Australia as well as the first to go Platinum.<ref>http://www.interlinc-online.com/artists/index.html?p=2&id=178</ref> To date, all Hillsong live worship albums have achieved Gold status in Australia. In 1996, Hillsong Music reached international prominence with the release of ''[[Shout to the Lord (Hillsong album)|Shout to the Lord]]'' produced by [[Integrity Music]]. This was Integrity Music's first live worship album featuring a female worship leader.<ref>http://www.darlenezschech.homestead.com/Biography.html</ref>

The 2004 Hillsong live worship album ''[[For All You've Done]]'', debuted at #1 on the [[Australian Record Industry Association]] album charts. This is the first time an album of [[Contemporary Christian music]] has topped the album charts in Australia. There was some controversy about this outcome as almost all of the albums were sold at Hillsong's annual [[Hillsong Conference|conference]] held in early July. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) have defended the outcome noting that the album sold more copies than any other record on sale in Australia that week.

==Geoff Bullock's departure==
[[Geoff Bullock]], the worship pastor before Zschech, resigned from Hillsong partly because of their phenomenal success. He states:

:''People have said that Hillsong (conference) 95 was my highest moment - the heights from which I fell. Yet if someone asked me what was the worst experience of my whole ministry career it would be Hillsong (conference) 95, because I felt so out of my depth.''

:''I kept thinking, 'I don't know what I'm doing here, I'm unable to be the person that I need to be'. I just can't be Mr Charisma and Mr Excited. That's not me. I'm a quiet, introspective, melancholic type of guy. I struggled throughout the week trying to lead the worship, but feeling very much that I was failing. I really fell apart emotionally within a month of the conference ending.''

:''My face was on all the posters, I was writing songs which everyone was singing, but inside I was asking myself 'Why am I always struggling? Why can't I just rise up in faith and be the man of God that everybody else says I should be, that this movement says I should be?' ''<ref>http://www.reality.org.nz/articles/27/27-benge.asp</ref>

Geoff Bullock has released a recent album with new songs and a few of his old songs re-written. He spoke with David Adams and Lloyd Harkness at Sight Magazine in an interview on the 13th of August, 2004 "I feel tremendously responsible that I led them [Hillsong Church] along the garden path".<ref>http://www.sightmagazine.com.au/stories/interview/bullock13.8.04.php View Article</ref>

==Crossover==

Hillsong music is accepted and sung in many Christian churches worldwide. Some Hillsong songs have distinct gospel influences (see [[Gospel music]] and [[Urban contemporary gospel]]) and this has probably contributed to its acceptance.
