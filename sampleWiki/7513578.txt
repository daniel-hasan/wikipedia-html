Balboa serves grades [[ninth grade|nine]] through [[twelfth grade|twelve]] as part of the [[San Francisco Unified School District]] (SFUSD).

Balboa is a [[comprehensive school]] located in an urban [[working class]] district.  It historically educates a greater proportion of the city's [[disadvantaged]] and [[minority group|minority]] students relative to other city high schools.  Mirroring conditions in the areas it serves, the school has a history marked by periods of violence, controversy, and low academic performance. 

The school motto is "First on the Pacific".  The campus is the first and only [[historic landmark]] school in the district and the only one operating in the city.  Following the dismissal of the entire [[Faculty (university)#North American usage|faculty]], in 1999, it became the first school in [[Northern California]] to embrace and convert its curriculum to the concept of [[Small Learning Community|small learning communities]]. It was the first in California to start a school-based student health clinic.  In response to the [[AIDS pandemic]], it was the first school in California to distribute free [[condom]]s to students.  In the last decade, Balboa has experienced a turnaround and has improved its reputation and academic performance.<ref name="KNIGHT_BOOSTER">

==History==
[[Image:Balboa-HS-SanFrancisco-1.jpg|thumb|left|Balboa High School, main classroom building|302px]]
Balboa High School is named after [[16th century]] [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]. Founded in 1928, campus construction was completed in 1931.

In the [[Spring (season)|spring]] of 1952, students at Balboa invented a variation on a [[conga line]] [[dance]] which inspired bandleader and songwriter [[Ray Anthony]] to compose an accompanying hit [[song]] with the same name, "[[Bunny hop (dance)|The Bunny Hop]]".<ref name="BUNNYHOP">

In 1986, Balboa converted its [[machine shop|metal shop]] into the first school-based [[clinic|health clinic]] in California: the '''Balboa Teen Health Center'''. The clinic provides basic [[medicine|medical]] and [[mental health]] services. The clinic has improved access and the health habits of a disadvantaged student population that might otherwise have gone without professional health assistance.<ref name="SFGATE_BTHC">

Balboa became embroiled in controversy over a [[hazing]] incident on [[February 22]], [[1994]] in which three [[JROTC]] [[cadet]]s were assaulted by other team members under orders from senior commanders.

===Academic resurgence===
In 1996, frustrated by high turnover and low performance on the part of the educational staff, the SFUSD dismissed the entire [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] in a desperate move to turn the school around.<ref name="YEUNG">

During the 1999-2000 academic year, Balboa shifted its entire academic program to the concept of [[Small Learning Communities]] (SLC). These communities would form a "school-within-a-school" in an effort to turn around past poor academic performance. To support the formation of SLCs, Balboa was the recipient of funding from the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] in 2004 and 2005 through the [http://www.ecclf.org Every Child Can Learn Foundation] Secondary Redesign Initiative.<ref name="KNIGHT_BOOSTER"/>

Frustrated by poor conditions such as insufficient [[textbook]]s and dilapidated facilities during the late 1990s, students at Balboa became members of the [[class-action]] [[lawsuit]] ''Williams v. California''.<ref name="VERSTEGEN">

==Campus==
[[Image:usgs balboahs.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial image of the entire Balboa High School campus|200px]]
===Location===
The school campus is located a few blocks away from major thoroughfares including [[Mission Street]].  The campus is close to [[Balboa Park, San Francisco, California|Balboa Park]], [[Balboa Park Station]], and [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]].  [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] transit [[List of San Francisco Municipal Railway lines|lines]] [[J Church|J]], [[K Ingleside|K]], [[M Ocean View|M]], 9X, 14, 14L, 14X, 26, 29, 43, 49, and 54 provide nearby service.

The Balboa campus is part of a larger SFUSD academic complex that includes neighboring James Denman Middle School and the San Miguel Child Development Center.  Balboa is close to [[City College of San Francisco]], the private [[Lick-Wilmerding High School]], and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Catholic]] [[Archbishop Riordan High School]]. Sited at the bottom of a valley, parts of the campus are built over a former river and lake.<ref name=WHITING2>

==Demographics==
[[Image:Balboa HS arcade1.jpg|thumb|left|Gymnasium arcade|135px]]
Balboa historically has a school population of primarily ethnic minorities. Since 1993, the [[white people|White]] population at Balboa has consistently totaled less than 7% of yearly enrollment. Up to 2003, the predominant ethnic groups at the school alternated between [[Hispanic]] (24-30%) and [[African American]] (19-24%). During this time [[Filipino (people)|Filipino]] students also figured prominently in the ethnic distribution (19-30%) briefly becoming the majority ethnic group between 1997 and 1999. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] have always comprised less than 1%, and [[Pacific Islander]]s less than 3% of the school population.<ref name="CDE"/>

[[Asian people|Asian]] students became the predominant ethnic group (34-39%) previously accounting for less than 20% of the school population. Hispanic and Filipino students followed with declining majorities. The largest decline was in the number of African American students, accounting for only 11.4% of the school population through the 2006-2007 school year.<ref name="CDE"/><ref name="KNIGHT_BOOSTER"/>

Coinciding with the academic turmoil of the late 1990s, the dropout rate at Balboa experienced a spike of over 230 students (16.8%) leaving in 1998. The year 2000 saw a sharp decline in the dropout rate, with no students leaving that year. The rate has averaged 2-6% since then.<ref name="CDE"/>

The demographic composition of [[Professional certification|certificated]] [[Faculty (university)#North American usage|faculty]] over the last decade has consisted primarily of White teachers (32-54%) with approximately similar distributions of staff reporting Asian (6-15%), Filipino (9-19%), or Hispanic (11-19%) ethnicity.  African American staff accounted for the remaining 8-11%.  The number of staff over the last decade has averaged between 55 and 91 members.<ref name="CDE"/>

==Curriculum==
[[Image:balboa hs library1.jpg|thumb|right|Library building entrance|160px]]
<!--==Admissions==-->
Balboa participates in the SFUSD's admissions lottery in which students from the entire city can indicate a preference to attend any of the district schools regardless of geographical location. Based on this preference and certain socioeconomic factors, students are then assigned to schools per district policies and goals.

===Small learning communities===
Academic instruction at Balboa High School is centered on the concept of SLCs. Each [[communities|community]] has a thematic focus that encourages individualized learning, an awareness of the future, and personal responsibility.<ref name="SCHARFENBERG">

In their first two years, communities of approximately 60-120 students experience focused core literary and mathematics instruction, with emphasis on community citizenship, and an exploration of [[career]] paths. Academies or pathways are chosen by students at the end of the 10th grade for the second half of their school career with the goal of preparation for career and college. A few exceptions are noted below.

Every community or academy has several goals in common.   Students are educated in preparation for their future career or post-secondary education.

===Advanced Placement===
Balboa began offering two [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) classes in 1990 which were briefly discontinued from 1996 to 1998.  Since 1998, the number has grown to the current offering of ten AP courses in [[AP Biology|Biology]], [[AP Calculus|Calculus AB]], [[AP Computer Science AB|Computer Science AB]], [[AP Chinese Language and Culture|Chinese]], [[AP English Literature and Composition|English Literature]], [[AP Physics B|Physics]], [[AP Spanish Language|Spanish]], [[AP Statistics|Statistics]], and [[AP World History|World History]]. Honors classes are also provided for students wishing to learn at an accelerated pace. The administration has placed an emphasis on attracting and retaining students in AP courses from underrepresented ethnic groups. For example, the AP Spanish class is used to introduce Hispanic students to other AP classes. The school has a unique policy of not allowing students to drop out of an AP course without the approval of the [[Principal (school)|principal]].  The goal of this policy is to identify struggling AP students and to provide additional resources and support to allow them to complete the course.<ref name="SCHEVITZ">

Balboa has six [[JROTC]] companies (classes) with five of them meeting each day, five days a week. Balboa has a before and after school class from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 pm, respectively everyday. The Balboa Battalion's special teams and drill teams practice before and after school. Balboa has a history in several award winning teams that have consistently placed in citywide competitions in the San Francisco JROTC Brigade. Among these are the Girls' Drill Team, Boys' Flag Team, Color Guard, Drill Platoon, Squad Drill Team and Drum Corps. Balboa constantly participates in physical activity challenges in its Raiders Team, individual drill-down competitions, [[guidon]] flag drill and other drilling and marching exhibitions. Balboa's special teams participate and perform in many parades where it is well known and award winning such as the annual San Francisco [[Veterans Day]] Parade, the Excelsior District Festival and the annual 91st or spring drill competition in the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]].

The Balboa Battalion and its cadet corps of approximately 225 cadets volunteer extensively in different service learning projects and community service projects coordinated by the battalion staff of student officers and the army instructors. The battalion donates canned food items and toys to annual holiday food and toy drives where it has gained notoriety among the Student Association for amassing large amounts of food for the drive; because of this, the Balboa Battalion sponsors and puts together the food drive each year at Balboa. Balboa's JROTC participates in the city-wide beach clean up annually, as well as cleaning up the school campus on a regular basis several times a month. The Balboa Battalion is a familiar face in each [[Earth Day]] event at Balboa, where cadets volunteer and clean the school. The JROTC program participates in service learning programs such as training in the [[CERT|Neighborhood Emergency Response Team]] to respond to any emergency event that may happen within the city or the school to keep fellow cadets and students alike of Balboa High School safe.

[[Image:united playaz logo.jpg|thumb|left|United Playaz Logo]] <!-- FAIR USE of united_playaz_logo.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:united_playaz_logo.jpg for rationale -->
United Playaz is an anti-violence and [[gang]] prevention program that seeks to stop the seeds of school violence through collaborative meetings and activities. The program was started in 1994 by former Balboa student turned gang prevention counselor, Rudy Corpuz, in response to racially motivated gang violence between Balboa students. The group is best known for fostering meetings and discussions between the school administration, community, and various adversarial student factions. These efforts were credited with turning the security situation at Balboa around by 1997.<ref name="MARTIN">
