The '''Yellow-bellied Glider''' ''(Petaurus australis)'', also known as the '''''Fluffy Glider''''', is about the size of a rabbit, and has a grey-brown back and is off-white to [[Orange (colour)|orange]] underneath, with large pointed ears and a long tail.<ref>{{cite book | author = Cronin, Leonard and Westmacott, Marion (illustrator) | title = Key Guide to Australian Mammals | year = 1991 | pages = pp. 64-65 | publisher = Reed Books Pty. Ltd. | id = ISBN 0-7301-0355-2}}</ref>

The Yellow-bellied Glider is the largest species of ''Petaurus'', and can glide up to 150 metres.<ref>{{cite book | author = Jones, Cath & Parish, Steve | title = Field Guide to Australian Mammals | pages = pp. 86, 88 | publisher = Steve Parish Publishing Pty. Ltd. | id = ISBN 1-74021-743-8}}</ref>

It is similar in appearance to the [[Mahogany Glider]], although slightly larger in size, and also similar in appearance to the [[Greater Glider]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Menkhorst, Peter and Knight, Frank | title = A Field Guide to the Mammals of Australia | year = 2001 | pages = pp. 94-95 | publisher = Oxford University Press | id = ISBN 0-19-550870-X}}</ref>

The Yellow-bellied Glider is [[Wiktionary:gregarious|gregarious]] and spends the day in a leaf-lined tree hole, which is usually shared with other Yellow-bellied Gliders.

Although the Yellow-bellied Glider has a narrow range down eastern Australia, reaching from northern [[Queensland]] to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], it's status is classified as uncommon to rare, and it is vulnerable in the topics.

The Yellow-belled Glider's diet consists of [[nectar]], [[honeydew]], [[insect]]s, [[pollen]] and [[Eucalyptus|Eucalyptus sap]] (which is obtained by the Yellow-bellied Glider biting a 'V' shape wedge into the bark to promote the flow of gum and sap).<ref>{{cite book | author = Strahan, Ronald | title = A Photographic Guide to Mammals of Australia | year = 1995 | pages = p. 58 | publisher = The Australian Museum, New Holland (Publishers) Ltd. | id = ISBN 1-85368-583-6}}</ref>

Breeding occurs in spring in the south, but throughout the year in the north.

There are two subspecies:
* ''P. a. australis'' in the south (which is locally common)
* ''P. a. reginae'' in northern Queensland (which is rare and threatened with logging) 

==Threats==

Barbed-wire fences and [[felling]] of old nest trees. <ref>{{cite book | editor = Ryan, Michelle (General Editor), and Burwell, Chris (Scientific Editor) | title = Wildlife of Tropical North Queensland | pages = p.338 | publisher = Queensland Museum | id = ISBN 0-7242-9349-3}}</ref>
