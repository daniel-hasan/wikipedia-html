'''Lone Star College-CyFair''' is one of five colleges in the [[Lone Star College System]] in northwest [[Houston]], [[Cypress]], [[Texas]], [[United States of America]]. It opened on August 25, 2003 to serve the Cy-Fair community. This $95 million, 200-acre campus was built with local bond money and as of the day of its opening, Lone Star College-CyFair is the only new comprehensive college or university developed in the United States. 

LSC-CyFair opened its doors with two innovative partnerships, one a joint-use library with Harris County and the other a partnership with the Emergency Services District #9 and the [[Cy-Fair Volunteer Fire Department]].

==Harris County Public Library Cy-Fair Branch==
The county and the college collaborated to create a joint-use library to enhance services to the public and the college and to save tax dollars. This 78,000 sq. ft. blended library has resulted in extended hours, community meeting rooms, 200+ computers, a children’s library, teen room, both tutoring and counseling for students and the public. Not only do the librarians teach research to college students, but also teach English as a Second Language classes, develop community programming using the vast academic resources of a college, teach computer workshops, and sponsor book clubs. The county funds the salary of one counselor so career counseling and resume help can be offered to the public free of charge.

== EMS Training Center and Fire Station ==
According to Cy-Facts and Figures:

<blockquote>In partnership with the Emergency Services District #9 and the Cy-Fair Volunteer Fire Department, a $4 million Emergency Services Training Center was built on college land. Students in Fire Science and Emergency Medical services programs 
. . . have opportunities to develop hands-on skills in this working fire station that includes a simulated emergency room and a state-of-the-art burn facility. The programming that is possible through this facility and the training partnership that it supports will allow the NW Harris County area to meet its need to train firefighters, emergency medical technicians and paramedics.(13)
</blockquote>

== Workforce Needs ==
The growth of the area prompted LSC-CyFair to provide the area with programs which would support the rapidly changing workplace and world. The support of the business community was a key factor in the success of the petition to create the college and the workforce development programs reflect these needs including emergency services, health careers and nursing, technology and manufacturing.
