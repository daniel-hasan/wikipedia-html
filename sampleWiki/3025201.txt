|quote=Man, I think I get more nervous watching my brother fight. It's the same with him. When I was warming up before my last fight, he started to get emotional and almost cried. That's how much we care for each other."<br>
"I believe that was one more dream that I could achieve, as I always wanted to fight in the same card as my brother. I expect to be able to do it again many times in the future. I try to help my brother as much as I can, but he certainly helps me much more being more experienced. I also think it's good that we fight on the same card cause this would make fans card for us even more I believe."

==Biography==
Rua was born on [[November 25]] [[1981]] in [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]]. His family also lives in [[Curitiba]]. His father is a successful businessman that runs his own business. His mother was a [[track athlete]] and is currently a marathon runner. The Rua brothers also run marathons sometimes.<ref name = "bio">{{cite web

|publisher=PrideFC}}</ref> He has two brothers, his older brother, [[Murilo Rua|Murilo]] (born 1980) and his younger brother, Marco "Shaolin" Rua<ref name ="bio" />. Marco is also a mixed martial artist and Marco is currently training at [[Chute Boxe]], though not at a professional level like his older brothers.

On [[September 1]],  [[2007]], Rua married physiotherapist Renata Riberio.<ref>[http://www.onzuka.com/news.html The Chute Boxe athlete had married in the last September first with the physiotherapist Renata Riberio in Maringa , Paraná state,]</ref>

===Martial arts background===
Rua began training martial arts with [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] at the age of six and [[Muay Thai]] at seven, at which he became 10-0.<ref>Commentator [[Mauro Ranallo]], at 0:15 of round 1 of Mauricio Rua vs. [[Hiromitsu Kanehara]], [[PRIDE 29]]. "Shogun started training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at the age of six, Muay Thai at seven. Was 10 and 0 in Muay Thai."</ref> He was very successful in BJJ championships at the Blue and Purple belt level. Rua followed his older brothers' footsteps after Murilo started training in [[Muay Thai]] with the [[Chute Boxe]] Academy. In addition to Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, he also currently trains in [[wrestling]] and [[Boxing|western boxing]].<ref name = "wrestling">{{cite web

===Meca World Vale Tudo=== 
Rua started his career at the Meca World Vale Tudo event in [[Brazil]]. On his debut, Rua fought Rafael Capoeira, knocking him out with a head kick in the first round. At Meca World Vale Tudo 9, Shogun fought and beat current teammate [[Evangelista Santos|Evangelista "Cyborg" Santos]]. The fight was very fast paced and "Cyborg" had Rua in trouble on his feet, forcing him to take the fight to the ground and finish it with punches from the mount, after Santos defended plenty of submission attempts.

===IFC=== 
Rua's first loss came at the hands of [[Renato "Babalu" Sobral]] during the IFC tournament "Global Domination" on [[September 6]], [[2003]] by [[submission]] ([[guillotine choke]]). Though the fight was very even, Rua was caught in a guillotine in the third round. "Babalu" had to fight for nearly two minutes in order to adjust the guillotine and get "Shogun" to tap out. Earlier that night, "Shogun" showed great ground skills escaping submission after submission attempt from Eric Wanderlei. Early in the second round, Rua knocked Wanderlei out with punches to the face.

===PRIDE Fighting Championship===

Rua has exhibited noted ability with his kicks and stomps against grounded opponents throughout his career in PRIDE FC.  <ref>In the above match, commentator [[Bas Rutten]] states Rua's skill against grounded opponents owes to [[Chute Boxe]]'s specific training practice of attacking padded, grounded training partners.</ref> ]]
Rua exhibited a great ground game in his early fights in PRIDE,<ref>During the English broadcast, MMA legend [[Royce Gracie]] stated that Rua has a very good ground game.</ref> but defeated his first five opponents in the first rounds with punches, stomps, and soccer kicks.  Rua moved on from his PRIDE Bushido fights to the larger PRIDE 29 with his match against [[Hiromitsu Kanehara]], going in referred to by the commentators as the "[[heir apparent]]" to famed teammate [[Wanderlei Silva]].<ref>[[Mauro Ranallo]]: "He's a well-versed Muay Thai fighter, well-versed in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and really, a lot of people feel he is indeed the heir apparent to Wanderlei Silva." [[Bas Rutten]]: "Yes, and that's including me."</ref> He won with soccer kicks and stomps to the face at 1:40 in the first round, with the commentators noting that even famed 225 lb. striker [[Mirko Filipović|Mirko Cro-cop]] wasn't able to take out Kanehara in a full fight.<ref>[[Bas Rutten]], [[PRIDE 29]]. "I mean, Cro-cop could not take him out ... in a full fight! And now, he just demolishes him."</ref>

Rua then entered the [[PRIDE Total Elimination 2005|PRIDE 2005 205 lb. Grand Prix]] tournament as a heavy underdog. His first opponent would be [[Quinton Jackson|Quinton "Rampage" Jackson]], whom he had challenged after Jackson won a controversial split decision over his brother, [[Murilo Rua|Murilo "Ninja" Rua]], at the previous PRIDE event, [[PRIDE 29]]. Jackson had been the runner-up in the PRIDE 2003 205 lb. Grand Prix, but Mauricio dominated the favored fighter from beginning to end, breaking Jackson's ribs with knee strikes and ending the fight with soccer kicks to the face in the first round. Jackson has stated that Rua is the best fighter he has ever fought.<ref name = "jackson">{{cite web

|quote=Add UFC news: White recently signed Mauricio "Shogun" Rua, who current UFC light heavyweight champion Quinton "Rampage" Jackson called the best fighter he'd ever faced. Rua (16-2) will make his UFC debut Sept. 22}}</ref>

Rua's next fight in the tournament would be against rival academy [[Brazilian Top Team]] member [[Antonio Rogerio Nogueira]]. In one of the most exciting bouts of 2005, where each contestant scored a knock down on the other, Rua was able to edge out a unanimous decision against Nogueira. On August 28, 2005, "Shogun" cemented his place in MMA history when he won the 2005 Grand Prix tournament by defeating  [[Alistair Overeem]] and [[Ricardo Arona]], both by TKO in the first round. 

Rua came back at [[PRIDE 31]] where he suffered his second loss, now at the hands of Heavyweight [[Mark Coleman]]. The fight was stopped when Rua dislocated his elbow following a takedown by Coleman in which he landed awkwardly. Rua has repeatedly expressed interest in a rematch with Coleman.

After the elbow injury, Rua returned to the ring on [[September 10]], [[2006]] to face [[France|French]] striker [[Cyrille Diabate]]. Rua defeated Diabate via TKO (stomps).  On [[October 21]], [[2006]], Rua defeated former UFC champion [[Kevin Randleman]] with a kneebar two minutes into the first round.  After [[PRIDE 32]] Rua said that he wants to fight in the Middleweight GP in 2007, and fight as a Heavyweight in 2008<ref name = "mma365">{{cite web

On [[December 31]], [[2006]], at [[PRIDE Shockwave 2006]], Rua defeated [[Kazuhiro Nakamura]] by unanimous decision after out-grappling the [[judo]]ka. His last fight was a knockout victory at [[PRIDE 33]] in a rematch against Dutchman [[Alistair Overeem]].

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
After the sale of PRIDE FC, Rua signed a lucrative deal with the [[UFC]] and made his debut for the organization at [[UFC 76]] on [[September 22]], [[2007]]. Notable rule differences between PRIDE FC and the UFC (which uses the [[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Combat]]) include the prohibition of kicking, stomping or kneeing to the head of a downed opponent. 

In his UFC debut, Rua took on ''[[The Ultimate Fighter 1]]'' winner [[Forrest Griffin]]. Widely regarded as the top light heavyweight in the world at the time of the fight, Shogun was considered a heavy favorite to win.<ref name="nok">{{cite web

It has been stated since then that Rua will be medically cleared to fight and commence with regular training as of February of 2008. Both Mauricio and his brother Murilo have recently announced that they have left [[Chute Boxe]] with plans to open up their own facility in [[Massachusetts]].

Rua has announced that he is currently set to return at UFC 83 in April. <ref name="return_at_ufc_83">{{cite web
