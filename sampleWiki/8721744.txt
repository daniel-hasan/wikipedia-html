{{Campaignbox Byzantine-Seljuk War}}
The '''Byzantine-Seljuk wars''' were a series of decisive battles that shifted the balance of power in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the [[Seljuk Turks]]. Riding from the [[steppe]]s of [[Central Asia]], the Seljuk Turks replicated tactics practiced by the Huns hundreds of years earlier against a similar Roman opponent but now combining it with new-found Islamic zeal; in many ways, the Seljuk Turks resumed the conquests of the Muslims in the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]] initiated by the [[Rashidun]], [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbassid|Abassid]] Caliphate in the [[Levant]], [[North Africa]] and Asia Minor. 

Today the [[Battle of Manzikert]] is widely seen as the moment when the Byzantines lost the war against the Turks; however the [[Byzantine military]] was of questionable quality before 1071 with regular Turkish incursions overrunning the failing [[Theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|theme system]]. Even after Manzikert Byzantine rule over Asia Minor did not end immediately, nor were any heavy concessions levied by the Turks on their opponents &mdash; it took another 20 years before the Turks were in control of the entire Anatolian peninsula and not for long either.

During the course of the war, the Seljuk Turks and their allies attacked the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] of Egypt, capturing Jerusalem and catalyzing the call for the [[First Crusade]]. Crusader assistance to Byzantium was mixed with treachery and looting, although substantial gains were made in the [[First Crusade]]. Within a hundred years of Manzikert the Byzantines had (with Crusader assistance) successfully driven back the Turks from the coasts of Asia Minor and extended their influence right down to Palestine and even Egypt. Later the Byzantines were unable to extract any more assistance and the [[Fourth Crusade]] even led to the sack of [[Constantinople]]. Before the conflict petered out, the Seljuks managed to take more territory from the weakened [[Nicaean Empire]] until the Sultanate itself was taken over by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], leading to the rise of the [[Ghazw|ghazis]] and the conclusive [[Byzantine-Ottoman wars]].

The wars' distant origins lay in the formation of the Byzantine Empire from the collapsing Roman Empire in the 4th century AD. Prior to the formation of the Byzantine realm in the 3rd Century AD, the [[Roman Empire]] faced a severe military and political crisis; political assassinations and dangerous campaigning led to 32 Emperors seizing and losing power within 50 years of Roman history.<ref>{{cite web| title =Table of the Emperors| publisher =About.com| date =2007| url =http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_chaosemp_table.htm| accessdate =2007-11-03}}</ref> Matters were made worse with an [[economic]] and [[demographic]] problem.The population of the Roman Empire began to fall in the 4th century AD due to a lack of conquest leading to a lack of slaves,<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/GI07Aa01.html |title=Book Review: Deep in denial (or in de' Mississippi) |accessdate=2007-11-03 |date=[[2005-09-07]] |work=Asia Times Online }}</ref> a vital and significant group of people in the Empire.

Unlike the Western Half of the Roman Empire, the Eastern Half experienced fewer barbarian invasions although encounters with the [[Huns]] and [[Persians]] kept the Byzantines busy enough from making any serious recovery attempts in the West.

In the 7th and 8th centuries, the Byzantines experienced several co-ordinated [[Byzantine-Arab Wars|Arab invasions]] losing several vital provinces, such as Egypt and the [[Levant]]. A Byzantine resurgence under the Macedonian Dynasty allowed the Byzantines to reconquer parts of Syria and Mesopotamia; in particular were the efforts of [[Basil II]] who from the late 10th century to early 11th century transformed the Empire into the most powerful state in the Medieval World.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Holmes |first=Catherine |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=De Imperatoribus Romanis |title=Basil II (A.D. 976-1025) |url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/basilii.htm |accessdate=2007-11-03 |edition= |date=[[2003-04-01]] |year= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}</ref> 
[[Image:Seldschuken-Reich-map.png|thumb|right|The Seljuk Turks at their greatest extent. To the North East in North Western China (Altay Mountains) lies a probable origin of the Turks.]]

Despite this, the Byzantines were far from safe. With the death of Basil II came a series of Emperors whom failed to secure the Empire against external threats. The biggest threat to the Empire since the Arab invasions were the Turks. The Turks were much like the Byzantines former enemies, the Huns. Combining their excellent riding skills with Islamic zeal, the Turks who converted to Islam in the 7th and later 8th centuries<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Tiscali encyclopedia |title=Seljuk Empire |url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0009478.html |accessdate=2007-11-03 |edition= |date= |year=[[2007]] |publisher=Research Machines |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}</ref> were to become a formidable enemy to a Christian state in decline. 

As the Byzantines were making headway against the Arabs in the 10th century, Persia was being ruled by the [[Ghaznevid]]s, another [[Turkic people]]. The Migration of Seljuk Turks into Persia in the 10th century led to the Ghaznevids being overthrown. There they settled and adopted Persian language and customs.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Amir-Moezzi |first=M.A. |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica |title=Shahrbanu |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_shahrbanu_20050131.html |accessdate=2007-11-03 |edition= |date= |year= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote=... here one might bear in mind that non-Persian dynasties such as the Ghaznevids, Saljuqs and Ilkhanids were rapidly to adopt the Persian language and have their origins traced back to the ancient kings of Persia rather than to Turkish heroes or Muslim saints ... }}</ref>
The Seljuks established a powerful domain and captured Baghdad in 1055 from the [[Abbasid|Abassid Caliphate]]. The Abassid Caliphate henceforth became a mere figurehead in the Islamic World. The Seljuk Turks, spurred on by their previous success, now launched an attack on the Levant and against Fatimid Egypt, which lost Jerusalem in 1071.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~lilinah/Library/KnowYourTurks.html |title=Know Your Turks! |accessdate=2007-11-03 |last=bint 'abd al-Karim al-hakim al-Fassi |first=Anahita |date=[[2000-11-20]] }}</ref>

Encounters between the Seljuk Turks and the Byzantines did not occur until after the reign of Basil II. However, the outcome of another war, the [[Byzantine-Georgian wars]] was in some ways influenced by the incursions of the Seljuk Turks into Georgia,<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.aboutgeorgia.net/history/index.html?page=4 |title=Georgia in the De veloped Feudal Period (XI-XIII cen.) |accessdate=2007-11-03 |work=AboutGeorgia.net }}</ref><!-- We might have self reference issue here--> so it is unlikely that they were unheard of.

When the Seljuk Turks did encounter the Byzantines, they had chosen a good time to attack; Byzantium was faced with weak rule, [[Normans|Norman]] conquests<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/robert-guiscard |title=Robert Guiscard |accessdate=2007-11-03 |last=Bicheno |first=Hugh |work=Answers.com }}</ref> and the [[schism]] whilst the Abassid Caliphate had recently been seriously weakened with its wars against the [[Fatimid]] dynasty.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/ISLAM/ABASSID.HTM |title=The Abassid dynasty |accessdate=2007-11-03 }}</ref>

Ever since the early 11th century, the Seljuk Turks from central Asia had been expanding westward,<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=Seljuk_empire |title=The Seljuk Empire |accessdate=2007-11-03 |work=All Empires }}</ref> defeating various Arab factions and occupying the Abassid caliphate's power base in Baghdad.<ref>{{cite news | first=Martin | last=Bright | coauthors= | title=Iraq's 5,000 years of pride | date=[[2003-03-16]] | publisher= | url =http://observer.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,,914918,00.html | work =The Guardian Unlimited | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-03 | language = }}</ref> At the same time, the Byzantine empire was making a few gains in [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] and Syria.<!-- The following is a copy of relevant wikipedia article ++ <ref>http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Cities/EdessaMesopotamia.html</ref> --> In 1067 the Seljuk Turks invaded Asia Minor attacking [[Antioch, Pisidia|Caesarea]] and in 1069 [[Iconium]].<ref>Philip Sherrard, ''Great Ages of Man Byzantium'', Time-Life Books, p. 164</ref> A Byzantine counter attack in 1069 drove the Seljuk Turks back from these lands.<ref>http://navsci.berkeley.edu/ma20/PPT/14%20Feb%2006%20Byzantine.ppt.
</ref> Further offensives by the Byzantine army drove the Turks back across the [[Euphrates]]. 

Despite this, the Seljuk Turks continued their incursions into Asia Minor, capturing Manzikert. The Byzantine Emperor Romanus Diogenes led an army in an attempt to score a decisive blow against the Seljuks and add some military justification to his rule (which had seen the loss of southern Italy to Norman conquests). During the march, [[Alp Arslan]], the leader of the Seljuk Turks withdrew from Manzikert. His tactical withdrawal allowed his army to ambush the Byzantines, reclaiming Manzikert shortly after.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_manzikert.html|title=Battle of Manzikert, 19 August 1071|accessdate=2007-11-03 |format= |work= |author=Rickard, J.}}</ref> The victory itself led to few gains at the time for the Seljuk Turks, but the civil chaos that resulted in the Byzantine Empire allowed the Seljuk's and various other Turkic allies to swarm into Asia Minor.

[[Image:Byzantium1081ADlightpurple-1-+Antioch.png|thumb|right|Byzantine Empire 1081. By now, the Empire was in financial crisis at a time when increased taxes needed to be levied on a smaller population to raise revenue for increased defenses.]]

After Manzikert, the Seljuk Turks concentrated on their eastern territorial gains which were threatened by the Fatimid dynasty in Egypt although Alp Arslan encouraged other allied Turks and vassals to establish [[Beyliks]] in Asia Minor.<ref>http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/christian/blchron_xian_crusades01.htm</ref> Many Byzantines at the time did not see the victory as a total disaster and when the Turks began occupying the countryside in Anatolia they began to garrison the Byzantine cities as well, not as foreign conquerors but as mercenaries requested by various Byzantine factions &mdash; one Byzantine Emperor even gave the city of Nicaea's defense to the invading Turks in 1078.<ref>{{cite web | title =  The Battle of Manzikert: Military Disaster or Political Failure?| last = Markham| first = Paul| url = http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/markham.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-19}}</ref>

The result of the civil war meant that pretenders to the Byzantine throne sought Turkic aid by conceding Byzantine territory. The loss of these cities such as Nicaea and another defeat in Anatolia led to a prolongation of the war. The civil conflict finally ended when [[Alexius I Comnenus]], who had been leading Imperial armies to defeat revolts in Asia Minor became a rebel himself and seized the Byzantine Throne in 1081. Despite emergency reforms implemented by [[Alexius I]], [[Antioch]] and [[İzmir|Smyrna]] were lost by 1084,<REF>http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9355511</REF> Although between 1078 and 1084 the city had been in the hands of an Armenian renegade. By 1091, the few remaining Byzantine towns in Asia Minor inherited by Alexius were lost as well. However, all was not to end in defeat for Byzantium; in 1091, a combined Seljuk/Pecheneg invasion and siege of Constantinople was thoroughly defeated whilst the Norman invasions had been held back as well allowing the Empire to focus her energies against the Turks.

In 1094, Alexius Comnenus sent a message to Pope Urban II asking for weapons, supplies and skilled troops. At the Council of Clermont in 1095, the Pope preached a [[Crusade]] to be undertaken in order to capture Jerusalem and, in the process, assist the Byzantine Empire which could no longer guard Christendom in the East from Islamic aggression.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/urban2a.html|title=Speech at Clermont 1095 |accessdate=2007-11-03 |work= Medieval Sourcebook|author=Urban II}}</ref> Though the Crusades would assist the Byzantine Empire in reconquering many vital Anatolian towns, it also led to the dissolution of the Empire in 1204 during which time the Byzantines struggled to hold on to their territories.

The first Crusaders arrived in 1096 following Alexius' appeal to the West.<ref>{{cite book|last=Madden|first=Thomas F.|title=Crusades: The Illustrated History |publisher=University of Michigan Press| year=2005 | isbn=0-472-03127-9|pages=35}}</ref> The agreement between the Byzantines and the Crusaders was that any Byzantine cities re-captured from the Turks would be handed over to the Empire.<ref name="M40">Madden (2005), 40</ref>

This was beneficial for the Crusaders as it meant that they did not have to garrison captured towns and lose troop strength whilst maintaining their supply lines. The Byzantines, in return, would supply the Crusaders with food in a hostile territory and Alexius' troops would act as a reserve to reinforce them in any dangerous situations. The Crusaders first set about attacking [[Siege of Nicaea|Nicaea]] on [[May 6]], [[1097]].<ref name="M40" /> [[Kilij Arslan I]] was unable to assist the Turks there due to the immense size of the Crusader armies; another small defeat on May 16<ref name="M40" /> convinced Kilij Arslan to withdraw and abandon relieving the city, which surrendered to the Byzantines on the June 19.<ref name="M40" /> After this a decisive victory at [[Battle of Dorylaeum|Dorylaeum]]<ref>Rickard, J. (3 April 2001), Battle of Dorylaeum, 1 July 1097, http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_dorylaeum.html

Unfortunately for Alexius Comnenus, the Byzantines were unable to fully capitalize on these conquests with Caesarea returning to the Seljuks as a part of the [[Sultanate of Rum]] along with several other cities such as Iconium, the future capital of the Seljuk Turks.
[[Image:SiegeofAntioch.jpeg|thumb|right|The siege of Antioch, with soldiers wearing plate as opposed to mail armour.]]Following these victories, the Crusaders went on to [[Siege of Antioch|lay siege to Antioch]] a city under Turk occupation. The siege marked the end of Crusader assistance to the Byzantines due to the simulations of Stephen of Blois. Kerbogah, a vassal of the Seljuk Turks, had a huge army of 75,000 troops sent to relieve Antioch; his unsuccessful siege of Edessa (a city that had recently fallen to the Crusaders) allowed the Crusaders time to capture Antioch on the [[June 3]], [[1098]],<ref name="M42-43">Madden (2005), 42-43</ref> a day before Kerbogah's arrival. Despite this, Kerbogah's troops were able to breach the citadel<ref name="M42-43" />  where vicious and desperate fighting allowed the Crusaders to repulse his offensive. At this point, one of the Crusaders present, Stephen of Blois deserted and reaching Alexius Comnenus warned him that the Crusaders were destroyed and so had the [[Byzantine Emperor]] turn back.<ref>Evans, Michael. "The Siege of Antioch." Suite 101. 9 Nov. 2001. 2 June 2007 <www.suite101.com/article.cfm/crusades/84416>. </ref>

As a result of this apparent desertion of Alexius I, the Crusaders refused to hand back Antioch when they managed to defeat Kerbogah's scattered army.<ref>Rickard, J. (2 April 2001), Antioch, Kerboga's siege of, 5-28 June 1098, http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_antioch_kerboga.html</ref> 
With this resentment, the Crusaders largely abandoned assisting the Byzantines against the Seljuk Turks and their allies. A further Crusade in 1101 to follow up the successes of the First ended in total defeat<ref>Knox, Skip E. "Second Battle of Ramleh." The Crusades. Boise State University. 2 June 2007 <http://crusades.boisestate.edu/1101/11.shtml>. </ref> and the consolidation of Seljuk Power in Asia Minor with Iconium (modern day Konya) being established as the capital of the Sultanate of Rum.

==Byzantine Counter-Attack: 1118-1176==
''See also: [[Battle of Myriokephalon]] ''
[[Image:JohnIIcomnenus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John II Comnenus, Byzantium's greatest military leader since Basil II. John was able to exploit the weakness of the Turks using the still fragile state and army he had inherited from his [[Alexius I Comnenus|father]]]]

The death of Alexius I brought [[John II Comnenus]] to power. By now, the Seljuk Turks had fractured and became loosely allied to each other.<ref>http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=Seljuk_empire</ref> During this time the Sultanate of Rum was busy fighting off their former allies, the [[Danishmends]]. John Comnenus was able to use this to his advantage as he undertook a series of campaigns aimed at recapturing Anatolia. Under his rule, the front line was pushed far into Anatolia, reaching dangerously close to his enemies' capital at Iconium. Despite this, the Turks in Anatolia continued to fight each other but a hunting accident robbed the Byzantines the opportunity to inflict a decisive victory.<ref>Stone, Andrew. "An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors." 26 Nov. 2004. University of Western Australia. 2 June 2007 <http://www.roman-emperors.org/johncomn.htm>. </ref>

John II died in 1143 while the Byzantine empire was very powerful. The new emperor, [[Manuel Comnenus]], was unable to extend the front line past his father's achievements. The Seljuk Turks were able to subdue their enemies, the Danishmends under Kilij Arslan II.<ref>"Seljuks." Classic Encyclopedia. 1911. Encyclopedia Britannica. 2 June 2007 <http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Seljuks>.</ref> During this time, the Byzantines were also fighting the Danishmends as nominal allies of the Seljuks. Part of the agreement meant that captured Danishmend territory would go to the Byzantines. When Kilij Arslan refused, the Byzantines under Manuel Comnenus had an army sent which was repulsed with heavy losses to both sides in 1176 at the [[Battle of Myriokephalon]].<ref>"Events After Myriokephalon." Geocities. 2 June 2007 <http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Labyrinth/2398/oocinfo/history/postmyrio.html>. </ref>
[[Image:Byzantium1173.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Byzantine territory in red, and the Sultanate of Iconium and Four Emirates in 1180 A.D.]]
The battle was tactically indecisive with both leaders keen to seek peace. Following this Manuel's army continued to skirmish with the Turks in Anatolia, defeating them in a smaller but indecisive battle in the Meander Valley. Regardless of this small respite, Myriokephalon had far more decisive implications than the casualties would suggest &mdash; there was no more reconquest of Asia Minor under Manuel Comnenus after 1176 like that which occurred under his father's reign. For the Seljuks, the acquisition of Danishmend territory gave them a victory though once again the Seljuks had to contend with neighbouring disputes leading to the peace treaty as requested by both leaders. Manuel Comnenus would later see the battle as another Manzikert. Manuel Comnenus may have attempted to reverse the situation at a later date; a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with his army was planned.

==Byzantine Collapse 1176 - 1308==

The wars continued, disrupted only by treaties intending to solve territorial disputes.<ref>Knox, E. S. "Manuel I Comnenus." The Crusades. Boise State University. 29 May 2007 <http://crusades.boisestate.edu/Byzantium/06.shtml></ref> The Seljuk Turks defeat on the Byzantines in 1176 led to no further Byzantine conquests; in fact [[Dorylaeum]] fell to the Turks that year. However the Seljuk Turks were unable to fully capitalize on this due to internal problems that [[Kilij Arslan II]] had to face; matters were made worse following his death in 1189.<ref name="Lowe">{{cite web|title=The Seljuqs of Rum|last=Lowe|first=Steven|coauthors=Baker, Martin|url=http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Seljuqs.htm|accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

The death of Manuel I Comnenus in 1180 did not end the Komnenoi dynasty, but Manuel's son proved to be incapable of holding together an empire burdened with heavy expenditure thanks to his father's extensive campaigning. In 1183, Alexius II Comnenus was deposed and replaced by Andronikus II Comnenus. His attempts to continue the militarization of the empire led to his torture, blinding, 3 days of public humiliation and finally death in 1185.<ref name="Norwich294">{{cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=A Short History of Byzantium|location=New York|publisher= Vintage Books|year=1997|pages=p. 298}}</ref> Even the Komnenoi proved fallable - Sozopolis, Ankara and Heraclea all fell to Alp Arslan, reaping the benefits of Myriokephalon at long last. 
[[Image:Byzantium1170lightpurple + seljuks.PNG|thumb|left|Byzantine Empire in Purple with the Seljuks of Rum in Green, '''c'''.1180. Despite a highly efficient military system, the Komnenian Dynasty failed to drive the Seljuks out of Asia Minor.]]

Following this turmoil, the Byzantine Empire was ruled by a [[List of Byzantine Emperors#Angelid dynasty (1185-1204)|series of corrupt and/or incapable emperors]] between 1185 and 1204, who failed to guard the frontier. The weak Imperial Byzantine rule led to the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and Antioch freeing themselves from Byzantine vassal status, the latter doing so in 1180<ref>http://lexicorient.com/e.o/antioch_crusaders.htm</ref> and the former establishing Prince Leo II on the throne in 1187.<ref>http://www.fanaticus.org/DBA/armies/IV2.html</ref>

Meanwhile, the Crusader states in Palestine began to [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall to Saladin]] resulting in the Third Crusade. This ended in a wasted opportunity for the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire to make substantial gains in the Middle East. The Byzantine Emperor [[Isaac II Angelos|Isacc II]] further demonstrated his incompetent rule by promising Saladin to keep the Third Crusade from crossing Anatolia (he had little military power to back up this agreement) and when he did allow the Third Crusade to pass due to [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]]'s threat, he failed to capitalize on the Crusader sacking of Iconium which had the potential to reverse the defeat at Myriokephalon.

For an empire that was surrounded by enemies the downfall of Byzantium became a greater probability and in 1204 the city of Constantinople was sacked by soldiers of the [[Fourth Crusade]] bringing the Empire into another era of chaos. The Seljuks of Rum under a new Sultan [[Kaykhusraw I|Kaykhusraw]] exploited this event and attacked the port of [[Antalya]] in 1207 capturing it from the weakened splinter [[Empire of Nicaea]].<ref name="Lowe" /> In 1210, a bold attack on Nicaea by the Sultan was narrowly repulsed with heavy losses inflicted on the defenders. The Byzantines of Nicaea continued to lose ground to the Seljuks who captured parts of southern [[Anatolia]] by '''c'''.1250.<ref>Madden (2005), 162</ref> However, beyond this the Seljuks were unable to achieve anything further by military action. In 1243, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion broke Seljuk power in [[Anatolia]]. Three years later, the early death of [[Kaykhusraw II]] placed his three young sons on the throne.<ref name="Lowe" /> Civil disputes arose once again in the [[Sultanate of Rum]] allowing the Empire of Nicaea to recapture Constantinople from the Latins in 1261.<ref name="Lowe" /> In 1283, the Sultanate of Rum took its share of Civil warfare and in 1308 was disbanded; Iconium was taken some time afterward by the [[Karamanids]], another Turkic people.<ref name="Lowe" /> The end of the Sultanate did not end the confrontations between the Turks and the Byzantines; the rising power of one of the nobles of the Sultanate, [[Osman I|Osman]] (Uc Beg) gave rise to the Ottoman Beylik and the [[Byzantine-Ottoman wars]], a continuation of confrontations between the Turks and the Byzantines ultimately leading to the demise of the Byzantine Empire and Islamic domination in Anatolia.

====Byzantine Army====
''Main article in [[Byzantine army]]''

Throughout the 10th and 11th centuries, the Byzantine Army was utilized in an increasingly aggressive manner, with new conquests made in the East and the West.<ref>Haldon, John. Byzantium at War 600 - 1453. New York: Osprey, 2000. pg 48 </ref>  As a result, the Theme system which was designed as a defensive military solution to wear down invasions of Asia Minor slowly began to break down. Troops were needed that would maintain a full-time presence on the field, something that the Thematic militia armies drawn from peasant farmers could not do. As a result, the use of ''Tagmata'', full-time professional soldiers became increasingly necessary to wage the offensive warfare that had propelled Byzantium to Great Power status in the 11th century.<ref>Haldon, John. Byzantium at War 600 - 1453. New York: Osprey, 2000. pg 49 </ref> The Tagamata were also drawn from mercenaries, such as Franks, Normans and no doubt Saxons, Rus and Vikings. The use of Tagamata troops did not directly undermine Byzantine military strength &mdash; Romanus Diogenes campaigns into Seljuk controlled Mesopotamia was composed of Tagmata as well as Theme troops. Nonetheless, the Theme troops began to seriously decline in quality.<ref>Haldon, John. Byzantium at War 600 - 1453. New York: Osprey, 2000. pg 51 </ref> Michael Attaleiates commented at the time of the Manzikert Campaign that the troops of the Theme system were poorly supplied, poorly provisioned and unfit for warfare. Consequently, when the Tagmata army was routed at Manzikert, the Theme system could not stop the relentless advance of the Seljuk Turks and their Turkic allies as they swarmed over Asia Minor, over-running the last Byzantine settlements in 1091. The Tagmata army was not the cause of the failure at Manzikert; however, the reliance on the Tagmata troops was one of the causes that led to the disintegration of the Theme System. As the Turks took Asia Minor, any organized resistance (as demonstrated by Alexius I's pre-Imperial career) had to make-do with an army in a poor condition.

====Crusades====

''See also [[Crusades]]''

Historians continue to debate the effect of the Crusaders on Byzantium. The [[First Crusade]] saw Byzantium make substantial gains in territory although this may have been achieved by the Byzantines themselves; there were plenty of civil conflicts in Asia Minor and amongst the Turks for Alexius to exploit. Furthermore, every other Crusade after the First had a detrimental effect on the Empire with Crusader armies unable to resist raiding towns which were supposed to be their allies<ref>Knox, Skip. "Second Crusade." Crusades. Boise State University. 19 June 2007 <http://crusades.boisestate.edu/2nd/05.shtml></ref> but in Byzantine territory there were quarrels over supplies and a few incidents of fighting. Once again, the westerners had created an unfavorable impression of themselves, and once again the Greeks had made themselves seem untrustworthy. At Constantinople, there were further incidents, even to the point that Conrad threatened to return from the crusade and take the city by force. The Second Crusade saw increased unity amongst the Islamic World,<ref>Bentley, Jerry H., and Herb F. Ziegler. Traditions & Encounters a Global Perspective on the Past. 3rd ed. Vol. 1. New York: McGraw-Hil, 2006. pg 533 </ref> with Zhengi able to bring Damascus into the fold and soon after much of Syria became a united front against the Crusades and a threat to Byzantine interests there. The Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] even threatened an assault on Constantinople in the [[Third Crusade]] and the [[Fourth Crusade]] saw the sack of Constantinople and substantial loss of territory by the Byzantines to the Frankish Crusaders & the Seljuk Turks.

Long term consequences of the Crusade also includes increased Islamic fanaticism and no more clearly is this seen then in the numerous Beyliks set up in Western Anatolia after 1204, particularly the Beylik of the Ottomans, Osman I's domain.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen. The Ottoman Empire 1326 - 1699. New York: Osprey, 2003. pg 17 </ref> Later, the Crusades of Nicopolis in 1396 and Varna in 1444 designed to aid the Byzantines made Constantinople appear as a magnet for Frankish Knights to launch their zealous attacks &mdash; this did not help the Byzantines in the long run. 

On the other hand, the Crusades allowed Byzantium a chance to regain power in the Mediterranean. Additionally, under Manuel Comnenus, the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Byzantine]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic Churches]] experienced far better relations than in the previous few decades and even coming close to healing the [[Schism]]. The alliance with the Pope was also crucial. Together, the Byzantines  and Catholics were able to put on hold the incursions of the Normans in southern Italy who were ravaging Byzantine territory in the Balkans, becoming almost as dangerous a threat as the Seljuk Turks.

It must also be said that long before [[Manzikert]], the Turkic incursions into Asia Minor had begun and Norman Knights were attacking Byzantine cities in southern Italy and the [[Balkans]]. The First Crusade in some aspects gave the Byzantines the tools they needed to utilize the Normans and other Franks as [[mercenaries]], some of whom joined the [[Varangian guard]]. Without the Crusades, the Normans and Turks may have continued their advance even after the defeat of the [[Pecheneg]]s and the [[Normans]] in the Balkans.

====Seljuk Turks====
[[Image:131 Bataille de Malazgirt.jpg|thumb|right|A French depiction of Manzikert, with no accuracy applied to the weapons, tactics or clothing worn by the combatants<ref>http://www.allempires.com/empires/seljuk/seljuk_warriors_enh.jpg</ref>.]]
The war's outcome was determined as much by the weakness of the Byzantines as the strengths of the Seljuks. Nonetheless, the Seljuks, just like the Arabs many years earlier, failed to destroy the Byzantine Empire. The Seljuk Turks, having originated from the steppes, possessed many advantages. At the Battle of Manzikert, the Byzantine Heavy Cavalry, the pride of Byzantium, was defeated using simple hit and run tactics,<ref>Grant, R G. Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat. London: Dorling Kindersley, 2005 </ref> with the faster light cavalry of the Turks out-flanking and out-maneuvering the exhausted Cavalry. 

Asia Minor was not completely overrun by the Turks after Manzikert but the resulting chaos that followed was easily exploited &mdash; Turkic soldiers had been used as Mamelukes by the Arabs before seizing power themselves &mdash; the same occurred in Asia Minor, with Byzantine factions inviting Turkic mercenaries to garrison towns. As Imperial rule was re-imposed in Byzantium, these factions, which were secured by Turkic soldiers, became part of the Seljuk Turk domains.

====Conclusion====

Despite being under Roman rule for almost 1000 years, the Seljuks rapidly consolidated their holdings over Anatolia demonstrated by the Seljuks' nerve to place their capital so close to the front line.<ref>"Turkey Sultanate of Rum." www.workmall.com. Jan. 1995. The Library of Congress Studies. 29 May 2007 <http://www.workmall.com/wfb2001/turkey/turkey_history_sultanate_of_rum.html></ref> This allowed them to hold on to their lands and made it all the more difficult for the Byzantines during the [[Komnenian restoration]] to re-conquer.<ref>"Manuel I Comnenus." Soylent Communications. 29 May 2007 <http://www.nndb.com/people/054/000095766/></ref> The result was that even when the Byzantine empire was not riddled with civil disputes, it could not defeat the Seljuk Turks, who rarely allowed the Byzantines to engage them, hence the slow campaigning of John Komnenus.<ref>"John II Comnenus." Soylent Communications. 29 May 2007 <http://www.nndb.com/people/849/000101546/></ref>

Whenever the Seljuks did show up in great strength, poor strategy on the part of the Byzantines coupled with good strategy on behalf of the Seljuk ruler resulted in two decisive defeats at Manzikert and Myriokephalon.

The old Roman state was in a constant state of war due to the numerous enemies on its borders; Muslims to the South and East, Slavs to the North and Franks to the West. It was an unfortunate Byzantium that had to face [[Normans]], [[Pechenegs]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] within a few decades of each other at a time when the army was torn in civil conflict.

====Consequences====

The war had great consequences. The Middle East was dominated by the power of the Fatimid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire; by the end of the 13th century, neither of the two were in a position to project power; the Fatimids having been toppled by the Turkic influenced [[Ayyubids]], whilst the Byzantines severely weakened by the Seljuks. Power shifted to the Mamelukes by the 14th century and then back to the Turks in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Never again would a Christian Kingdom yield so much military and political power in the Middle East. As the Turks steadily gained ground in Anatolia, the local population converted to Islam, further reducing any chances of a successful reconquest.<ref>Bentley, Jerry H., and Herb F. Ziegler. Traditions & Encounters a Global Perspective on the Past. 3rd ed. Vol. 1. New York: McGraw-Hil, 2006. 465. </ref>

The War also gave Western Christendom the opportunity to launch expeditions/pilgrimages to visit/liberate the Holy Land from Muslim Rule. In time, these Crusaders would establish their own fiefs in the Holy Land, ruling with interests coinciding,  but more often in conflict with, the Byzantine Empire, ultimately leading to a weakening of both the Crusader states and the Byzantine Empire.

For the Turks, it was the beginning of a new era of power. Despite further invasions and attacks by Crusaders from the west and Mongols/Turkic tribes from the east, the Turks slowly emerged as a superpower under the [[Ottomans]].<ref>http://turkeytravelplanner.com/details/History/Seljuks.html</ref> The rise of the Ottomans was parallel to the fall of the Sultanate of Rum and the carving up of the Byzantine Empire. The power vacuum left in Anatolia was easily exploited by one of the Sultanate's nobles, Osman I. Matters were made worse for the Byzantine Empire due to the Latin presence in the [[Peloponnese]] and the rising power of the Bulgarians whom continued to press hard against the borders of Byzantium. In time, the Byzantines would be forced to call on the aid of the Ottomans to head to the European mainland and fight the Bulgarians, giving the Ottoman Turks a firm grip on Europe. The close proximity of Osman's Beylik ensured that confrontation between the Byzantines and the Ottomans would be inevitable. The Byzantines were a match for the Ottomans but events west of Constantinople coupled with civil war and incompetent leadership left the Byzantines reeling from [[Byzantine-Ottoman wars|one siege after another]] until [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople fell in 1453]].
