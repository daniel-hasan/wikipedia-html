'''''Kashyap Samhita''''', also known as '''''Braddha Jivakiya Tantra''''', is an important treatise on [[Ayurveda]] medicine written in [[History of India|ancient India]] by the sage [[Kashyap]]. 

The originator of this [[Samhita]] is said to be [[Brahma]] himself, who transmitted this knowledge to [[Daksha]] Prajapati. Daksha then transmitted this knowledge to the [[Ashwins]], who in turn illuminated [[Indra]], [[Kashyap]], [[Vashishtha]], [[Atri]] and [[Bhrigu]]. The son of Kashyap and the pupil of the Kashyap transferred the knowledge to subsequent generations. 

The ''Kashyap Samhita'' was later translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] during the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>Terence Duke. ''The Boddhisattva Warriors: The Origin, Inner Philosophy, History and Symbolism of the Buddhist Martial Art Within India and China'' (p. 139-145).</ref>

==Overview==

In the ''Kashyapa Samhita'', the [[Ayurveda]] science descriptions are given in question-and-answer style: raised by the pupils and answered by the Sage Kashyapa himself, in a lucid way. The questions raised relate to the [a] commencement of diseases, [b] diagnosis, [c] treatment and [d] management. Kashyapa Samhita is said to be one of the oldest classical books on Ayurveda and an excellent study on the Arterial System.

Kashyap Samhita has an interesting myth concerning its origin - When Kashyap Rishi wrote the Samhita, it was not welcomed by the Ayurveda masters of that time.  The then five-year old son of sage Richeek, named Jeevak, summarized the huge volume of Samhita written by Kashyap himself and went to [[Kankhal]], [[Haridwar]], in [[Uttarakhand]], India and presented the concise version of Samhita before the Ayurvedic practitioners of the time, who rejected it outrightly, considering it to be written by a five-year-old boy. 

At the same time, the boy went to bathe in river Ganges, and when he stepped out after he had transformed into an old man (''Braddha''). Seeing this transformation, present Ayurveda practitioners called him "Braddha Jeevak" and recognized the collected work as "Braddha Jeevakeeya Tantra".

It is presumed that the time of Braddha Jeevak, is before of [[Buddha]] and Mahavir, and is different from Jeevak Vaidya, born in the era of Buddha, Bimbsaar's Bhujishya. Jeevak Vaidya was very expert in surgery while Braddha Jeevak is understood to be first originator of ''Kaumar Bhratya'' (pediatrics, midwifery, and gynecology).

With the passage of time, the Braddha Jeevakeeya Tantra suddenly came in the hand of Anayas [[Yaksha]]. At that time, Uttarakhand was domain by the Yakshas. Anayas Yaksha saved this script and spread the knowledge to his entire community.

After some time, Vatsaya, who was the successor of the Kashyap family, again got the script from Yaksha. He edited the whole book and divided it into eight chapters, or branches:
#Kaumar Bhratya 
#Shalya kriya - pradhan shalya 
#Uttamang- Shalyakriya - Pradhan Shalakya 
#Vayah Sthapanadi deergha prayoga - Pradhan Rasayana 
#Shareerik Mansik Chikitsa Pradhan 
#Kaya Chikitsa 
#Agad Tantra  
#Bhut Vidya.

Because of this eightfold division Ayurveda also known as '''Astanga Ayurveda''' [[The Eight Armed Ayurveda|(The Eight Armed Ayurveda)]].
