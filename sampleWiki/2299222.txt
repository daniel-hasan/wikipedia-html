The MS Isle of Innishmore is a [[ROPAX]] ferry built in 1997 at [[Van der Giessen-De Noord]], Netherlands.

She entered service with [[Irish Ferries]] on the [[Holyhead]] - [[Dublin]] route in 1997. In 2001, she was replaced by the flagship [[MV Ulysses]] and was transferred to the [[Pembroke Dock]] - [[Rosslare]]. The existing ferry on that route, the [[MS Isle of Innisfree]] was subsequently charted to [[P&O Portsmouth Ferries]].

Her sistership, [[MV Stena Jutlandica]], operates between Gothenburg and Frerikshavn. She has less passengers accommodation, being primarily a freight ship.
