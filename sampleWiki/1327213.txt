It is the first ZEN to have an [[SD card]] slot, support for unprotected [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], and a [[Truecolor|24-bit]] screen. The ZEN is not to be confused with the ZEN Micro-based [[Creative ZEN#ZEN (Micro-based hard drive player)|player]] of the same name.

Like its predecessor, decal stickers called "Stik-Ons" are sold separately to customize the look of the Neeon 2's frontplate, though they cannot be interchanged. The players and their "Stik-Ons" are only available in [[Singapore]] and several other Asian countries.

[[Image:Rachel's Zen V.jpg|left|169px|thumb|ZEN V (Green/Black, 2&nbsp;GB)]]

=== ZEN V&nbsp;/&nbsp;ZEN V Plus ===
{{main|ZEN V}}
Creative's first [[Flash memory|flash]]-based [[portable media player]] was released on [[June 20]], [[2006]].<ref>[http://www.mp3.com/creative-zen-v-plus/hardware/141/summary.html]</ref> The scratch-resistant models have a 1.5-inch [[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED]] display with a resolution of 128x128.

There are also built-in microphones for voice recording, as well as wires for [[Line-in Recording|line-in recording]]. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery has a life span of up to 15 hours of continuous audio playback.

The ZEN V Plus won the CNET Editor's Choice award during that month.

On [[September 29]], [[2006]], Creative announced that the blue-and-black ZEN V Plus had been upgraded to 8&nbsp;GB. Four days later, the company joined forces with the National Breast Cancer Foundation to release a pink version of the 2&nbsp;GB model, now available in most areas.<ref>[http://us.creative.com/corporate/pressroom/releases/welcome.asp?pid=12638], Creative supports the National Breast Cancer Foundation in conjunction with launch of pink ZEN V Plus 2&nbsp;GB, accessed [[January 28]], [[2007]].</ref> In Japan, the 8&nbsp;GB version is now available in a red-and-black color. <ref>[http://jp.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&subcategory=214&product=15306], jp.

== Discontinued players ==
=== NOMAD Jukebox Zen series ===
[[Image:NomadNenNxBattery.jpg|thumb|195px|right|NOMAD Jukebox Zen players feature easily replaceable batteries]]
{{main|Creative NOMAD}}
The first models branded as a "Zen" were then released under the now-defunct [[Creative NOMAD|NOMAD]] line, and have an [[anodising|anodized]] aluminium case. The 2.5-inch [[Fujitsu]] hard drives range from a 20 (NOMAD Jukebox Zen), 30 (Zen NX, Zen Xtra), 40 and 60&nbsp;GB (Xtra). Unlike the earlier NOMAD Jukebox players, which looked like CD players, these ones have the appearance of a cassette player.

==== NOMAD Jukebox Zen ====
Announced on [[October 14]], [[2002]], the NOMAD Jukebox Zen was the first player to include the "Zen" branding. It had the ability to connect via [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] 1.1 or [[FireWire]], while subsequent releases had connectivity to USB 2.0. Up to 14 hours of continuous audio playback is achieved by the rechargeable battery, and an optional wired remote gives the player an FM tuner and microphone.

==== NOMAD Jukebox Zen NX ====
The Zen NX, as it was later called, was released on [[August 20]], [[2003]],<ref>[http://reviews.cnet.com/mp3-players/creative-nomad-jukebox-zen/4505-6490_7-30468951.html]</ref> is an upgrade to the old NOMAD Jukebox Zen, with a removable battery and a slightly smaller size. Included with the player was MediaSource, the music management software that would be used with subsequent Zen players.
[[Image:ZenXtra.jpg|right|100px||thumb|NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra]]

==== NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra ====
The NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra, or the Zen Xtra (renamed by Creative for commercial reasons) was released simultaneously with the Zen NX.<ref>[http://reviews.cnet.com/mp3-players/creative-nomad-jukebox-zen/4505-6490_7-30571468.html]</ref> The player was presumably named Xtra, thanks to the larger screen. The package includes the player, a leather case with belt-clip, a lithium ion battery, a USB cable, and a pair of standard earbuds. Complaints against the Xtra have included failures of the firmware, headphone jack, and the hard drive. The Xtra can have problems with keeping track of very large numbers of music files.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nomadness.net/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=5811&highlight=maximum|title=Track limit to be fixed in new firmware|publisher=Nomadness.net|accessdate=2007-11-07}}</ref> The equalizer is somewhat broken in at least one firmware version.<ref>{{http://www.nomadness.net/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=18070&highlight=equalizer XTRA Custom EQ comparison (old FW vs. recent)], Nomadness.net forum, accessed November 7, 2006.</ref>

The Xtra is notable for being the first [[Digital audio player|DAP]] to support [[Real Networks]]'s Helix [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]], but through a tailored [[firmware]]. The [[SanDisk]] [[SanDisk Sansa|Sansa]] [[SanDisk Sansa#Rhapsody Sansa e200R|e200R]] would later be the only other player to have this feature.

=== Zen Touch === 
The Zen Touch was released on [[June 7]], [[2004]]<ref>[http://reviews.cnet.com/mp3-players/creative-zen-touch-40gb/4505-6490_7-31260506.html]</ref>. The model incorporated major changes in design, functionality and technology.

The Zen Touch has a smaller form factor and larger backlit blue display in a curved industrial design. In addition, the device uses a touch-sensitive vertical strip on the front of the unit for easier file navigation. These changes were enabled by the use of [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]]'s smaller 1.8-inch hard drives. The Touch is available in capacities of 20 and 40&nbsp;GB. Unlike the previous two generations, the Zen Touch does not have a removable battery, and plays audio for approximately 24 hours.

The Zen Touch has a brief uncredited appearance in Pepsi's new commercial which aired during [[Super Bowl XL]] <ref>http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4449065816181299003</ref>.

=== Zen Portable Media Center ===
[[Image:Portable Media Center.jpg|thumb|200px|Zen Portable Media Center]]
The Zen Portable Media Center, announced on [[January 8]], [[2004]] and released eight months later<ref>[http://reviews.cnet.com/portable-video-players-pvps/creative-zen-portable-media/4505-6499_7-30993434.html]</ref>, is based on [[Microsoft]]'s [[Portable Media Center]] interface, runs [[Windows Mobile]] and supports [[Windows Media Video|WMV]], WMA, and MP3, and can display [[JPEG]] images; other video formats are supported through transcoding. This device was the first to exclusively support [[Microsoft]]'s [[Media Transfer Protocol]], and was presented at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in 2004, winning the [[TechTV]] Best of CES Award in the Portable Audio and Video category.<ref name="Zen Portable Media Center CES" /> The player uses a 1.8-inch 20 or 40&nbsp;GB hard drive from [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]]. The Zen Portable Media Center has been replaced by the ZEN Vision and the ZEN Vision W.

=== ZEN Micro ===
[[Image:Zenmicro.jpg|thumb|right|100px|ZEN Micro glowing in the dark]]
The ZEN Micro was released on [[November 12]], [[2004]]<ref>[http://www.mp3.com/creative-zen-micro-5gb/hardware/24/summary.html]</ref>, and is a [[microdrive]] player available in 10 colors. It is also the first ZEN release that sports the new branding, including capitals for all letters in ''Zen''.
[[Image:Zenmicro3.jpg|left|150px|thumb|ZEN Micro with the included earphones]]
The ZEN Micro is much smaller than the Touch and shares a similar interface and controls (including the touchpad, without the 'OK' button. Making a selection would be done by tapping the touchpad). The Micro has a removable battery rated to last for up to 12 hours of continuous playback. In addition, the player has an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]-backlit [[liquid crystal display|LCD]], a glowing case, and offers hard disk capacities of 4, 5 and 6&nbsp;GB.

The Micro also features a built-in FM tuner/recorder, voice recorder and microphone, partitioning for data storage (i.e. acting as a removable hard drive for PCs), and the ability to synchronize contacts, tasks and calendars with [[Microsoft Outlook]]. Accessories for the ZEN Micro include matching color speakers, wireless headsets and a wired remote control.

The first 35,000 units shipped worldwide were packaged as a "Limited Edition" package that came with an additional rechargeable battery.  Asian models of the Limited Edition included the extra battery and a wired remote control.

At [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 2005, it was announced that the ZEN Micro line would be expanded to include 4 and 6&nbsp;GB models.

The ZEN Micro optionally supports the [[Microsoft]] [[Media Transfer Protocol]] and the [[Microsoft PlaysForSure|PlaysForSure]] certification with updated [[firmware]].

=== ZEN (Micro-based [[hard drive]] player) ===
The ZEN was released on [[April 6]], [[2005]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.creative.com/creativelabs/board/message?board.id=dap&message.id=45734|title=Creative Zen 20gb (zen micro look) really available??? Price (with shipping): 369$|author=Lazar|publisher=[[Creative Technology|Creative]]}}</ref>, and is slightly larger than the ZEN Micro with a 20&nbsp;GB hard drive capacity. The ZEN, however, has a magnesium back-casing and the battery is unremovable. This model was initially available in the Asia-Pacific region, but soon became available in the US through Cambridge SoundWorks, a subsidiary of Creative.
[[Image:zen neeon.jpg|left|110px|thumb|ZEN Neeon]]

=== ZEN Neeon ===
The ZEN Neeon was released on [[May 17]], [[2005]].<ref>[http://www.dealtime.co.uk/xPF-Creative-Labs-Zen-NEEON-5-GB]</ref> It is a throwback to the old Zen Xtra, but in a much smaller size. The 5&nbsp;GB model has an [[Signal-to-noise ratio|SNR]] of 98 [[Decibel|dB]] and a battery life of 16 hours (19 hours with new firmware version). The front has a piano black finish, and the back is [[anodized aluminium]] that comes in ten colors. and the LCD screen has a 7 color backlight.

The Creative ZEN Neeon was criticized highly at the time of release for having a slow interface, more specifically slow start-up, menus and song switch. As well, the first released models came with a virus that could infect your computer.<ref>[http://news.com.com/Virus-infected+Creative+Zen+MP3+players+found/2100-7349_3-5845499.html Virus-infected Creative ZEN MP3 Players found]CNet News.com - [[September 1]], [[2005]]</ref> This affected the popularity of the product and though the hardware and style of the ZEN Neeon was very good, the software seemed to let the product down. The firmware update released latter provided a much quicker start-up time and interface. If released with the player, it might have been more popular on the market.

Like its Micro brother, this unit also has an FM tuner and a [[microphone]], but also has a line in record function. This model does not use Creative specialized USB drivers; it is a standard [[USB mass storage device class|USB mass storage]] device.

On [[November 17]], [[2005]], the microdrive player was updated to 6&nbsp;GB and a new flash range was launched in capacities of 512&nbsp;MB, 1&nbsp;GB, and 2&nbsp;GB.<ref>[http://creative.com/press/releases/welcome.asp?pid=12260]</ref> The device is now equipped with a dual-tone [[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED]] screen. The device is also accompanied by a new marketing campaign, ''Put a Face to Your Music'', with emphasis on a whole new range of customizable "Stik-Ons", which are decal stickers that can be placed and removed from the face of the unit.

=== ZEN MicroPhoto ===
[[Image:Microphoto1.jpg|right|thumb|ZEN MicroPhoto with a custom wallpaper]]
The ZEN MicroPhoto, released on [[July 28]], [[2005]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/win/60992|title=Creative ZEN MicroPhoto 1.0.0.0 software download|publisher=[[VersionTracker]]}}</ref>, shares the same features of the ZEN Micro except [[Audible.com]] support (reinstated in firmware versions 1.31.01 and above), and adds an upgraded 262,144-color (18 bpp) [[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED]] screen for displaying photos. To fix the lack of bass with the ZEN Micro, Creative also implemented a Bass Boost feature, now available in most subsequent players. The 8&nbsp;GB player is available in the same colors of the Micro and is advertised to store "thousands of [[JPEG]]s" or "4,000 songs". Due to its larger battery, the player can play up to 15 hours of continuous playback, 3 hours longer than its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aphnetworks.com/reviews/creative_zen_microphoto|last=Schweitzer|first=Jason|title=Reviews | Creative Zen MicroPhoto 8GB|publisher=APH Networks}}</ref> Unlike the Micro, it does not have any problems with the headphone jack. The MicroPhoto is the first of many subsequent players with expanded customization, with the ability to use a picture as a custom wallpaper, with color themes to change the tones of it, and six color schemes.

The player was first announced at the [[Consumer Electronics Show#2005|2005 Consumer Electronics Show]], where it won the [[G4 (TV channel)|G4TV]] Best of CES award in the Audio To Go category.<ref name="ZEN Micro Photo CES" /> On [[November 2005]], the player was the [[CNET]] Editor's Choice award on [[CNET|CNET.com]].

It supports audio (WMA-DRM, WMA, MP3, WAV), video (WMV, Motion JPEG, MPEG 1/2/4, DivX 4/5, xvid) and picture (JPEG) playback. The ZEN Vision utilizes a 30&nbsp;GB hard drive and can partition a part of its hard drive to work as a removable disk (up to 16&nbsp;GB) for any [[operating system]]. There are some features of the ZEN Vision which require compatibility with certain operating systems, e.g require users to have access to [[Microsoft]] [[Windows XP]] (SP1 or higher).

Like past models, the ZEN Vision comes with a FM tuner, a voice and FM recorder, and a calendar and organizer that can be synchronized with [[Microsoft Outlook]].

The ZEN Vision has a 3.7-inch, trans-reflective TFT-LCD display that has a resolution of 640x480 (VGA) pixels.

Also, this version has a USB host adapter cable, which enables users to transfer photos from a digital camera directly to the player. It is only available in black and white, and is a little thicker than the 30&nbsp;GB model. However, on [[March 11]] [[2007]], the 60&nbsp;GB model was upgraded with the same thickness as the 30&nbsp;GB version. The 60&nbsp;GB model has only been released in Japan.

In November 2004, Creative Labs announced a $100 million marketing campaign to promote their digital audio products, including the ZEN range of MP3 players. In particular, the company was heavily publicizing the Zen Touch and ZEN Micro. These two products had been featured in an increasing number of television commercials, print ads, and urban billboards.

Many celebrities were seen with the ZEN Micro, including [[Paris Hilton]], pop group [[Maroon 5]] and Aerosmith's [[Steven Tyler]].
