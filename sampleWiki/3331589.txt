'''Hurricane Epsilon''' was a long lasting [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] of the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]] in late November and early December over the central [[Atlantic]]. Hurricane Epsilon was the twenty-seventh tropical or subtropical storm and the fifteenth hurricane of the season and was one of the strongest [[Atlantic hurricane]]s ever recorded so late in the year.

Hurricane Epsilon developed from an [[extratropical]] storm on [[November 29]] and gradually developed into a hurricane on [[December 2]], despite a highly hostile environment. Epsilon then held onto hurricane status for several more days, despite all predictions by the [[National Hurricane Center]], before finally dissipating on [[December 8]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Epsilon 2005 track.png}}
Tropical Storm Epsilon developed out of an [[extratropical]] storm in the central [[Atlantic Ocean]] on [[November 29]] that had gradually gained tropical characteristics in the wake of [[Tropical Storm Delta (2005)|Tropical Storm Delta]].<ref name="EpsilonTCR">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Epsilon|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 3|accessyear=2006|format=PDF|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL302005_Epsilon.pdf}}</ref> It was well east of [[Bermuda]] at the time and never would get close to land. Epsilon gradually strengthened into a strong tropical storm before it weakened slightly on [[December 1]]. The official forecasts from the [[National Hurricane Center]] predicted Epsilon would weaken further in the highly sheared environment before becoming an extratropical system again.<ref name="NHC-disc10">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Tropical Storm Epsilon, 4:00 p.m. EST, December 1 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 3|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al292005.discus.010.shtml}}</ref> Unexpectedly, Tropical Storm Epsilon strengthened again on [[December 2]] and became a hurricane over cooler waters averaging 21 &ndash; 24°C (70 &ndash; 75°F) and continuing shear, conditions that are highly unfavorable to maintaining a tropical cyclone. The official forecasts continued to predict weakening and eventual dissipation but Epsilon defied them and remained at hurricane strength for several days. At one point on [[December 4]] it was thought that Epsilon had briefly weakened into a tropical storm, but later re-analysis showed that it had remained a hurricane. Hurricane Epsilon then strengthened further to its peak intensity of 85 mph&nbsp;(135&nbsp;km/h) just hours later.<ref name="EpsilonTCR"/>

Hurricane Epsilon frustrated the forecasters, and the lack of any weakening led [[NOAA]] hurricane forecaster Dr. [[Lixion Avila]] to say "There are no clear reasons — and I am not going to make one up — to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon…"<ref name="NHC-disc21">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Hurricane Epsilon, 10:00 a.m. EST, December 4 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 3|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al292005.discus.021.shtml}}</ref> The storm maintained its hurricane status for five days while most of the six-hourly forecasts during that period called for it to weaken below that intensity.<ref name="TCD-summary">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|title=Summary for Hurricane Epsilon|publisher=Tropical Cyclone Database|accessdate=September 29|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.tropicalcyclone2005.com/database/2005/atlantic/SUMMARY/2005-29L-SUMMARY.txt}}</ref> Dr. Avila also claimed that Epsilon had developed a structure similar to one of an [[annular hurricane]], which enabled it to maintain its strength despite poor conditions.<ref name="NHC-disc26">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Discussion for Hurricane Epsilon, 4:00 p.m. EST, December 5 2005|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=May 3|accessyear=2006|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al292005.discus.026.shtml}}</ref>

On [[December 7]] a strong upper-level flow from the northwest disrupted the organization of Hurricane Epsilon. The continuing shear then finally weakened it into a tropical storm that day. It quickly weakened further into a tropical depression on [[December 8]] and dissipated shortly thereafter.<ref name="EpsilonTCR"/>

==Impact and records==
As Hurricane Epsilon stayed well out to sea and never approached land, no [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|warnings or watches]] were issued. No ships reported experiencing tropical storm force winds from Epsilon and there were no reports of damages or fatalities.<ref name="EpsilonTCR"/>

When Tropical Storm Epsilon formed on [[November 29]], it was the first known time that twenty-seven tropical or subtropical storms had formed in the Atlantic during one hurricane season. Hurricane Epsilon was only the sixth ever [[Atlantic hurricane]] recorded in December. Epsilon also spent more time as a hurricane during December than any other Atlantic storm (beating the old record held by [[Hurricane Lili (1984)|Hurricane Lili]] of 1984).<ref name="EpsilonTCR"/> Along with Lili, Epsilon was also one of only four known Atlantic tropical cyclones to strengthen into a hurricane in December.
