==History==
[[Image:KC Stadium.JPG|left|thumb|240px|The [[Kingston Communications]] Stadium]]
The idea of a new stadium for [[Kingston upon Hull]] was first mooted in 1997, but funds to finance such a project only became available when the [[Hull City Council|city council]] sold a portion of its holdings in [[Kingston Communications]].<ref name="hull_in_print"/> The council provided most of the funds, more than GB£42 million, with the rest stemming from government single regeneration budget grants and from the Football Stadium Improvement Fund.<ref name="hull_in_print"/>

The council appointed John Topliss to head the stadium construction project.<ref name="hull_in_print"/> He and his team partnered with consulting firm [[Drivers Jonas]] to explore preliminary issues such as stadium location, seating capacity, and facilities offered. Stated Mr. Topliss: "We had a totally blank canvas and, working with consultants, made a thorough assessment of what was needed."<ref name="hull_in_print"/>

The project team considered over a dozen sites, inside and outside of the city, before settling on The Circle in West Park.<ref name="hull_in_print"/> Factors contributing to the decision include transport guidance, central government planning guidelines, existing athletic facilities, isolation from residential areas, and council ownership.<ref name="hull_in_print"/>

The final recommendation of [[Drivers Jonas]] included additional facilities for both indoor and outdoor sports for the people of West Hull in addition to the main stadium, planned to seat from 25,000 to 30,000 spectators.<ref name="hull_in_print"/> Professional services firm [[Arup|Arup Associates]] provided initial concept proposals for the stadium.<ref name="facts"/> The Miller Partnership, an architectural and interior design firm, adopted these proposals during the stadium's design.<ref name="facts"/>

Outline planning permission for the project was granted in December 2000, with Birse Construction Limited named as the main contractor the following year.<ref>{{ cite web | title = New Stadium | url = http://www.ambernectar.com/index2.htm?http&&&www.ambernectar.com/content/stadium/stadium_orig.shtml | publisher = Amber Nectar | accessdate = 2007-08-30}}</ref> 

In spite of a number of obstacles during the course of the project, including [[Hull City A.F.C.]]'s receivership in 2001 (just after the granting of planning permission),<ref name="hull_in_print"/> the stadium complex was completed on time (in fourteen months)<ref name="facts"/> and on budget (at approximately [[pound sterling|GB£]]44 million).<ref name="facts"/> The stadium opened its doors on [[December 18]] [[2002]]. Hull City beat [[Sunderland A.F.C.]] 1&ndash;0 in a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] to mark the occasion.<ref name="hfh">{{ cite web | title = Home From Home | url = http://www.hullcityafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Stadium/0,,10338,00.html | publisher = Hull City AFC | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref> [[Steve Melton]] scored the goal, the first at the KC Stadium.<ref name="History Of The Tigers">{{cite web
