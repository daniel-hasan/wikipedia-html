The [[Council of Europe]] (COE) has developed a series of '''European symbols''' for the continent of [[Europe]], and these have since been shared with the [[European Union]] (EU). They are intended both as symbols of the organisations themselves, and as a focus for a form of [[Pan-European identity]]. Later, the EU has created further symbols for itself.

==Flag ==
{{Main|Flag of Europe}}
[[Image:European flag in the wind.jpg|thumb|right|220px]]

The '''Flag of Europe'''  consists of a circle of twelve [[gold]]en ([[yellow]]) stars on a [[blue]] background. It is most commonly associated with the [[European Union]] (EU), formerly the [[European Communities]], which adopted the flag in the 1980s. However it was first adopted by the [[Council of Europe]] (CoE), which created it in 1955. 

The EU and CoE are separate organisations; while the EU has 27 members, the CoE has 47 members and 5 observers comprising not only all 27 EU members but also all European countries except [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Vatican City]]. When adopted by the CoE, it was to represent not just itself, but the whole of Europe. Since both the EU and the CoE represent [[European integration|European unity]], the two organisations are using the same flag.

==Presidency insignia==
[[Image:Slovenian European Union presidency 2008.svg|thumb|150px|right|The logo of the 2008 Slovenian presidency.]]
Every [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] has its own logo and visual expression. These sets of colours and designs follow the politics of the EU as a whole for the six months length of the presidencies. The EU has no official ''coat-of-arms'', so in a sense the presidency logo fills lack of symbols for the Union.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} It is always commented in the media when launched.

==Institutional emblems==
Every institution, body and agency of the EU has an individual symbol:

==Anthem ==
{{main|European anthem}}
<div style="position: relative; float: right; clear: right; border:1px solid #CCCCCC; background-color:white; font-size:85%; width:300px; margin:3px; margin-left: 0.5cm; padding:3px;">{{Listen|filename=Ode to Joy violin.ogg|title=Ode to Joy|description=String version from 1997|format=[[Ogg]]}}</div>
The European anthem is based on the prelude to "The Ode to Joy", 4th movement of Ludwig van [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 9th symphony]]. Due to the large number of languages in Europe, it is an instrumental version only with the original German lyrics having no official status. The anthem was announced on [[19 January]] [[1972]] by the Council of Europe after being arranged by conductor [[Herbert von Karajan]].  The anthem was launched via a major information campaign on Europe Day, [[5 May]] 1972.

It was adopted by European Community leaders in 1985. It does not replace national anthems, but is intended to celebrate their shared values.[http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp]. It is played on official occasions by both the Council of Europe and the European Union.

== Europe Day ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Council of Europe]] -->
{{splitsection}}
[[Image:Aachen Rathaus.JPG|right|thumb|220px]]
The Council of Europe has celebrated its founding on [[5 May]], [[1949]] as "Europe Day" since [[1964]].

What is now the [[European Union]] adopted [[9 May]] as "Europe Day" at the [[Milan]] summit in [[1985]], to celebrate that [[Robert Schuman]] presented his proposal on the creation of an organised Europe, indispensable to the maintenance of peaceful relations, on [[9 May]], [[1950]]. This proposal, known as the ''[[Schuman declaration]]'', is considered by many to be the beginning of the creation of what is now the European Union.

[[9 May]] is now the more commonly observed date, though some Europeans still prefer [[5 May]], since the Council of Europe was designed to defend [[human rights]], parliamentary [[democracy]] and the [[rule of law]], while the Schuman speech was simply proposing a sharing of [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] [[coal]] and [[steel]].  Incidentally, [[May 9]] is also celebrated in many former [[Soviet Union]] countries as [[Victory Day]], the end of [[World War II]]. This is celebrated on [[May 8]] in most Western European countries, but is celebrated on [[May 5]] in Denmark and the Netherlands.

==Motto==<!-- This section is linked from [[European Union]] -->
{{splitsection}}
An EU motto, ''In varietate concordia'' ([[Latin]] for ''united in diversity''), was first established through an unofficial process in [[2000]]. It was selected from entries proposed by school pupils submitted to the website [http://www.devise-europe.org www.devise-europe.org], and then accepted by the President of the [[European Parliament]], [[Nicole Fontaine]]. The modified version, ''United in diversity'', has been written into the English-language version of the currently stalled [[European constitution|Constitution for Europe]], and now appears on official EU websites. See  [http://www.eurominority.org/version/eng/languages-motto.asp www.eurominority.org] for the motto in many languages not listed below.

Interestingly, the proposed change would make the motto essentially the same as the [[South Africa]]n motto officially adopted in  [[2000-04-27]]: "''!ke e: /xarra //ke''" in [[/Xam language|/Xam]], an extinct [[Khoisan language]]. "''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]''", translated as "Unity in Diversity", is also the national motto of [[Indonesia]]. It is also similar to "''[[E pluribus unum]]''" (Latin for "out of many, one"), one of the mottos of the [[United States of America]] (although this refers to the fifty states comprising the Union and not the diversity of its population.)
[[Unity in diversity]] is the present official motto of [[Papua New Guinea]].
