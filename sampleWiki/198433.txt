'''''GoldenEye''''', released in [[1995 in film|1995]], is the seventeenth [[spy film]] of the [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] [[James Bond]] [[James Bond (films)|series]], and the first to star [[Pierce Brosnan]] as the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. Unlike previous James Bond films, it was not related to the works of novelist [[Ian Fleming]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A817823 | title =The James Bond Films - 1994-2002 | date=2002-11-10 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 | work =BBC News }}</ref>  although the name "GoldenEye" was taken from his estate in [[Jamaica]]. The original story was conceived and written by [[Michael France]], with later collaboration by several other writers, and was directed by [[Martin Campbell]]. In the film, Bond fights to prevent an arms syndicate from using the GoldenEye satellite weapon against [[London]] in order to cause a global financial meltdown.

''GoldenEye'' was released in 1995 after legal disputes forced a six-year hiatus in the series, during which [[Timothy Dalton]] resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. [[M (James Bond)|M]] was also recast (last played by [[Robert Brown (actor)|Robert Brown]] in ''[[Licence to Kill]]'') with actress [[Judi Dench]], becoming the first female to portray the character. ''GoldenEye'' was the first Bond film made after the downfall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the end of the [[Cold War]], which provided a background for the plot.

The film was lauded by most critics and performed well at the box office, considerably better than Dalton's films, without taking inflation into account.<ref name="nos">{{cite web | url =http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/JamesBond.php | title =Box Office History for James Bond Movies | accessdate = 2007-10-18 | work =The Numbers | publisher= Nash Information Service }}</ref> Some critics viewed the film as a modernisation of the series, and felt Brosnan was a definite improvement over his predecessor.<ref name="QNetwork">{{cite web | title=GoldenEye | publisher=Qnetwork | url=http://www.qnetwork.com/?page=review&id=348 | accessdate=2007-04-27 |last= Kendrick|first= James}}</ref><ref name="variety">{{cite web | title=GoldenEye | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | first=Todd | last=McCarthy | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904690.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | date= [[1995-11-15]] | accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=GoldenEye | publisher=Filmcritic.com | url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/ddb5490109a79f598625623d0015f1e4/9503ab99be3b464086256275001adc5a?OpenDocument | accessdate=2007-04-27 |last= Null|first= Christopher}}</ref> It also received two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nominations &ndash; "Best Achievement in Special Effects" and "Best Sound".<ref>{{cite web | title = Film Winners 1990-1999 PDF | publisher = BAFTA.org | url = http://www.bafta.org/site/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/import/Film_Winners_1990-1999.pdf | accessdate = 2007-05-25}}</ref>

==Plot==
In the prologue, [[MI6]] agents [[James Bond]] and [[Alec Trevelyan]] infiltrate an illicit [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[chemical weapons]] facility at [[Arkhangelsk]] and plant explosive charges. During the operation, Trevelyan is captured and shot by [[List of James Bond henchmen in GoldenEye#General_Ourumov|Colonel Arkady Ourumov]], while Bond steals an airplane and escapes the exploding facility.

[[Image:GE-Bond-and-Trevelyan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alec Trevelyan]] and [[James Bond]] infiltrate the Arkhangelsk facility]]

Nine years later, Bond arrives in [[Monte Carlo]] to follow Xenia Onatopp, a suspected member of the [[Janus]] crime syndicate. The next day, she and Ourumov (now a Russian general) steal a French Tiger helicopter and fly it to a bunker in [[Severnaya]], where they massacre the staff and steal the control disk for the '''GoldenEye''' satellite weapon. The two program Goldeneye to target and destroy the complex with an [[electromagnetic pulse]], while they escape with programmer Boris Grishenko, another Janus operative. [[Natalya Simonova]], the lone survivor and witness to the massacre, later escapes from the ruins and arranges to meet Grishenko in [[St. Petersburg]], where he betrays her to Janus agents.

In [[London]], [[M (James Bond)|M]] assigns Bond to investigate the attack, and he flies to St. Petersburg to meet CIA agent [[Jack Wade]], who drives him to meet [[Valentin Zukovsky#Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky|Valentin Zukovsky]], a local [[Russian Mafia]] head. Zukovsky arranges a meeting between Bond and Janus, who reveals himself as Trevelyan. A [[Betrayal of the Cossacks|Lienz Cossac]], Trevelyan faked his death at Archangelsk and vows revenge against Britain for their involvement in his family's death. Trevelyan captures Bond and ties him up with Simonova in the Tiger helicopter, now programmed to self-destruct, which the two narrowly escape using its ejection system. Bond and Simonova are immediately arrested by the Russian police and interrogated by the Minister of Defence, [[Dmitri Mishkin]]. Just as Simonova reveals Ourumov's involvement in the massacre at Severnaya, Ourumov bursts into the room, shooting Mishkin and dragging Simonova into a waiting car.[[Image:GE-BondandSimonovainCuba.jpg|right|thumb|[[James Bond]] and [[Natalya Simonova]] in Cuba.]] Bond steals a [[T-55]] tank and audaciously pursues Ourumov through St. Petersburg to Janus' train, where he kills Ourumov as Trevelyan escapes, locking Bond in the train with Simonova. As the train's self-destruct countdown begins, Bond slices through the floor with his laser watch while Simonova locates Grishenko's satellite dish in Cuba. The two escape just before the train explodes.

In Cuba, Bond and Simonova fly a plane over the jungle before they are shot down. As they stumble out of the wreckage, Onatopp rappels down from a helicopter and attacks, knocking out Simonova and torturing an already enfeebled Bond, who resists and narrowly kills her. Minutes later, he and Simonova watch a lake being drained of its water, uncovering Grishenko's satellite dish. They infiltrate the control station, where Bond is captured by Trevelyan, who reveals his plan of stealing money from the [[Bank of England]] before destroying it with the GoldenEye, concealing the theft and destroying England's economy. 

[[Image:Gold9.jpg|thumb|left|[[Xenia Onatopp]] fighting [[James Bond]] in the Cuban jungle.]]

Meanwhile, an unnoticed Simonova programs the satellite to initiate [[atmospheric reentry]] and destroy itself. As Trevelyan captures Simonova and orders Grishenko to save the satellite, Bond triggers an explosion with his [[Parker Jotter]] pen grenade and escapes to the antenna cradle with Simonova, followed by Trevelyan. Bond sabotages the antenna, preventing Grishenko from regaining control of the satellite, before turning and facing Trevelyan. In the ensuing fight, Bond shoves Trevelyan off the antenna and into the dish hundreds of feet below, before escaping aboard a helicopter commandeered by Simonova. The cradle malfunctions and collapses, crushing Trevelyan and rupturing [[liquid nitrogen]] tanks in the station that freeze Grishenko to death. Meanwhile on the surface, while finding solace in each others arms, Bond and Simonova are rescued by Wade and his platoon of U.S. Marines.

==Production==
The preceding Bond film, ''[[Licence to Kill]]'', had underperformed at the American box office.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1989&p=.htm | title=1989 Domestic Grosses | work=Box Office Mojo | accessdate=2007-10-21 }}</ref> Also, in 1989, MGM/UA was sold to the Australian based broadcasting group Quintex, who wanted to merge the company with [[Pathé]]. Danjaq, the Swiss based parent company of EON, sued [[MGM/UA]] because the Bond back catalogue was being licensed to Pathé, who intended to broadcast the Bond series on television in several countries across the world without the approval of Danjaq.<ref name="Production notes"/> These legal disputes delayed the film for several years.<ref>{{cite web | title=GoldenEye - The Road To Production | publisher=mi6.co.uk | url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/ge_roadtoproduction.php3 | date=2003-06-23 | accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref>

While the legal disputes went on, [[Timothy Dalton]] was still expected to play Bond in the new film, as he had originally signed up for a three-film contract. In an interview in 1993, Dalton said that Michael France was writing the story for the film, which was due to begin production in January or February 1994.<ref>{{cite news |title = Interview with Dalton |work = [[The Daily Mail]] | date = [[1993-08-06]]}}</ref> However, the deadline was not met, and in April 1994, Dalton officially abdicated from the role.<ref>{{cite video

''GoldenEye'' was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]]'s [[EON Productions]]. With Albert Broccoli's health deteriorating (he died seven months after the film's release), his daughter [[Barbara Broccoli]] described him as taking "a bit of a back seat" in the production of the film, but still having a lot of influence.<ref name="ashton">{{cite web | url = http://www.hmss.com/films/mgw/mgw95.html | title =Richard Ashton Interview Michael G.

While the story was not based on a work by Ian Fleming, the title ''GoldenEye'' traces its origins to the name of Fleming's Jamaican estate where he wrote the Bond novels. Fleming gave a number of origins for the name of his estate, including [[Carson McCullers]]' ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye]]''<ref>{{cite book | author = [[John Pearson (author)|Pearson, John]] | year = 1966 | title = [[The Life of Ian Fleming]] | publisher = Vintage/Ebury | id = ISBN 0-224-61136-4}}</ref> and [[Operation Goldeneye]], a contingency plan Fleming himself developed during [[World War II]] in case of a [[Nazi]] invasion through [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite web | title= The Real James Bond | url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/R/real_lives/james_bond.html | publisher=[[Channel 4]]  | accessdate=2006-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title= Adultery, Cambridge spies, a Jamaican idyll — Ian Fleming's biographer Andrew Lycett traces the origins of James Bond  | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2101-2432127,00.html | publisher=[[The Times]] | first=Andrew |last=Lycett | date=[[2006-11-05]] | accessdate=2006-11-19}}</ref> 

Since ''Licence to Kill'', the world had changed drastically. ''GoldenEye'' was the first James Bond film to be produced since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the collapse of the Soviet Union. This cast doubt over whether James Bond was still relevant in the modern world, as many of the previous films pitted him against Soviet villains trying to take advantage of the Cold War.<ref>{{cite book

The producers gained the assistance of the [[French Navy]], which provided full use of the frigate [[La Fayette (F710)|FS ''La Fayette'']] and the navy's newest helicopter, the [[Eurocopter Tiger]]. The French government also allowed the use of Navy logos as part of the promotional campaign for the film.

The tank chase scene was performed with the use of a Russian [[T-55]] tank from a British military rental firm and modified with the addition of fake [[explosive reactive armor]] panels (chronologically appropriate to a modern upgraded T55 equipping the [[Russian Army|Russian Army Reserve]] of the period, such as the [[T-55#Modernization|T-55M5]]). In order to avoid destroying the pavement on the city streets of St. Petersburg, the steel off-road tracks of the T-55 were replaced with the rubber-shoed tracks from a British [[Chieftain tank]]. A rectangular viewport was cut in the [[glacis plate]] and covered with tinted [[Perspex]], allowing a trained driver to maneuver the tank from a [[prone]] position inside the driver's compartment while Pierce Brosnan sat in the (modified) driver's seat with his head protruding from the driver's hatch, creating the illusion he was driving the tank "unbuttoned".<ref>''"T55 Main Battle Tank - The "Goldeneye Tank"'', Tanks For Hire Inc. , http://www.tanks4hire.co.uk/T55armouredmilitarytank.html, accessed 11-02-07</ref>

The sequences involving the armoured train were filmed on [[Nene Valley Railway]], near [[Peterborough]] in the UK.

The fall of [[communism]] in Russia is the main focus of the opening titles, designed by [[Daniel Kleinman]] (who took over from [[Maurice Binder]] after his death in 1991). They show the collapse and destruction of several structures associated with the Soviet Union, such as the [[red star]] and [[hammer and sickle]]. In an interview, Kleinman said they were meant to be "a kind of story telling sequence" showing that "what was happening in Communist countries was Communism was falling down".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20060204162919/http://www.jamesbond.com/bond20/newsflash/newsflash_27.php | title = Opening Sequence W/ Daniel Kleinman | accessdate = 2007-01-18}}</ref>

''GoldenEye'' was the first James Bond film in which Bond does not wear a [[Rolex]]. Brosnan wore an [[Omega SA|Omega]] watch to help modernise Bond's image. Lindy Hemming, the film's costume designer, told ''The European Magazine'' Rolex had "become a bit ordinary".<ref>{{cite journal | title="The Names Bond, Euro Bond" | journal=The European Magazine | date=1995-07-07}}</ref> The producers also wanted to work with a company that would cooperate in cross promotions, which Rolex did not wish to do.

''GoldenEye'' was edited in order to be guaranteed a [[MPAA film rating system|PG-13]] rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] and a 12 rating from the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]]. The cuts included the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan's head when he is shot in the prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station, more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral's death, extra footage of Onatopp's death, and Bond giving her a [[rabbit punch]] in the car.<ref name="secret"/>In 2006, the film was remastered and re-edited for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the cuts including headbutts and violent sound effects were restored, causing the rating to be changed to 15.<ref>{{cite video

''GoldenEye'' was the second and final Bond film to be adapted to a novel by novelist [[John Gardner (thriller writer)|John Gardner]], and was to be his penultimate Bond novel. The book closely follows the film's storyline, but Gardner added a violent sequence prior to the opening bungee jump in which Bond kills a group of Russian guards, a change that the video game ''GoldenEye 007'' retained.<ref>{{cite book
