Calls from [[Western world|Western governments]] for an international investigation prompted a major shift in Uzbek foreign policy favoring closer relations with Asian nations. The Uzbek government ordered the closing of the United States air base in [[Karshi-Khanabad]] and improved ties with the [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]], and [[Russia]], all of which supported the regime's response in Andjian.<ref name="DOCUMENTING">[http://www.cfr.org/publication/10984/documenting_andijan.html#6 "Documenting Andijan"], Council for Foreign Relations, 26 June 2006.</ref><ref name="BASECLOSED">[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2005/11/22/us_closes_air_base_in_uzbekistan_amid_uprising_dispute/ "US closes air base in Uzbekistan amid uprising dispute"], [[Boston Globe]], 22 November 2005.</ref>

==Trial of businessmen==
Uzbek protesters initially asked for the release of 23 local businessmen who were arrested on June 23, 2004 and charged with "[[Three Evils|extremism, fundamentalism and separatism]]." Uzbek police subsequently charged them with membership in [[Akromiya]], an organization the Uzbek government has designated and banned as terrorist. The businessmen denied the charge, saying they were arrested because of their growing support among the local populace.<ref name=CLAN>[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav092905.shtml Andijan massacre linked to local power struggle -- source 9/29/05] EurasiaNet</ref><ref name=ARRESTINFO>The 23 businessmen are Rasuljon Ajikhalilov, Abdumajit Ibragimov, Abdulboki Ibragimov, Tursunbek Nazarov, Makhammadshokir Artikov, Odil Makhsdaliyev, Dadakhon Nodirov, Shamsitdin Atamatov, Ortikboy Akbarov, Rasul Akbarov, Shavkat Shokirov, Abdurauf Khamidov, Muzaffar Kodirov, Mukhammadaziz Mamdiyev, Nasibillo Maksudov, Adkhamjon Babojonov, Khakimjon Zakirov, Gulomjon Nadirov, Musojon Mirzaboyev, Dilshchodbek Mamadiyev, Abdulvosid Igamov, Shokurjon Shakirov, and Ravshanbek Mazimjonov.

Melissa Hooper, an American lawyer in Tashkent who worked with the defense in the trial, said on May 14, "This is more about [the businessmen] acquiring economic clout, and perhaps refusing to pay off the local authorities, than about any religious beliefs." Andrei Grozin, head of the Central Asia and Kazakhstan Department of the Institute of CIS Countries, said in an interview conducted by ''Rossiiskaya gazeta'' that authorities used the trial to "take away the business of several entrepreneurs under a clearly trumped-up pretext."<ref name=GROZIN>[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/05/99498e1f-029f-488b-9cda-ac3292ca9e54.html Uzbekistan: Bloody Friday in the Ferghana Valley] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty</ref>

The protesters, mainly relatives of the defendants, videotaped the demonstration, which the police did not interrupt. Demonstrators lined the streets around the courthouse, with women on one side and men on the other. By [[11 May]] over 4,000 demonstrators had gathered to hear the verdict. Prosecutors had asked for prison terms ranging from three to seven years for 20 of the accused, offering to free the remaining three.

===Government involvement===
In some accounts, the troops involved in the massacre are from the Interior Ministry;<ref name=POLACCOUNT>[http://www.turkishweekly.net/news.php?id=14294 Uzbekistan: Andijan Policeman's Account] Turkish Weekly</ref> Burnashev and Chernykh report that the 12,500 troops involved included the "17th air-assault brigade and a battalion of specialized operations from the Eastern military district; a brigade of rapid reaction forces and a separate battalion of Special Forces “Bars” of the Ministry of Interior’s internal troops; and four separate units of Special Forces of the National Security Service."<ref name=CLANTHEORY/>

==Mass graves==
[[Muhammad Solih]], founder and leader of the [[Erk]] political party in Uzbekistan, estimated more than 1,000 casualties in the massacre. Solih said the bodies were buried in mass graves holding 15 to 20 people each, or were thrown into the [[Karasu river]]. Between May 13-14, 18 flights took 35 or more bodies from Andijan out of the city. Solih said, "Andijan is a litmus test for countries who want influence in the region. Russia sees Central Asia as the source for religious extremism, while China fears a growth of internal separatists," but "neither wants to recognize that Karimov gives strength to what they fear." The Chinese and Russian governments support for the Uzbek government allows it to avoid an international investigation.<ref name=SALIH>[http://www.rferl.org/releases/2005/07/352-200705.asp Uzbek opposition leader hopes Andijon tragedy will awaken west] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty</ref>

===United States===
When asked about the government's response to the incident, State Department spokesman [[Richard Boucher]] said the U.S. government has been "very consistently critical of the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, we're very concerned about the outbreak of violence in Andijan, in particular the escape of prisoners, including possibly members of the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]], an organization we consider a terrorist organization. I think at this point we're looking to all the parties involved to exercise restraint to avoid any unnecessary loss of life." At another point Boucher said, "It's becoming increasingly clear that very large numbers of civilians were killed by the indiscriminate use of force by Uzbek forces. There needs to be a credible and a transparent accounting to establish the facts of the matter of what occurred in Andijon. At the same time I think it is clear that the episode began by an armed attack on the prison and on other government facilities. there are reports of hostage-taking and other claims that should be investigated.

==Clan struggle theory==
One interpretation of the unrest and the preceding trial mainly espoused by Central Asian scholars is an inter-clan struggle between the [[Tashkent clan|Tashkent-Ferghana clan alliance]] and the rival [[Samarqand clan]].<ref name=CLANTHEORY/><ref name=CLANALLIANCE>[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/EC13Ag03.html Uzbek strongman under Russian attack] Asia Times</ref>

On [[25 May]] [[2004]] the legislative chamber of Andijan's regional government voted to impeach Kobiljon Obidov, the Governor of Andijan and a leading member of the [[Ferghana clan]], replacing him with Saydullo Begaliyev, the former Minister of Agriculture and Water in the national government. Governor Obidov's involvement in several political scandals lost him favor with President Karimov, who personally attended his impeachment proceedings. According to an anonymous source who spoke with ''EurasiaNet'' Obidov "was the province's master ... businesses favored by the hokim got the green light for everything. All the entrepreneurs who enjoyed [Obidov's] patronage," including the 23 businessmen, "grew rich." In late 2004 Karimov appointed Ikromkhon Nazhmiddinov, who succeeded Begaliyev as the Minister of Agriculture and Water, Governor of [[Ferghana province]].<ref name=CLAN/>

The source said, "Criminal proceedings were started against many of his [Obidov's] administration members. The new hokim also decided to re-divide the businesses in the province; he cracked down on the entrepreneurs who had been supported by Obidov. They were told to sell their businesses for a pittance either to him [Begaliyev] or his people, or face legal proceedings."<ref name=CLAN/>

Prior to the Andijan massacre the Samarqand clan maintained control over the Interior Ministry under the leadership of Zakir Almatov and the [[Tashkent clan]] controlled the National Security Service under the leadership of Rustam Innoyatov. Rustam Burnashev and Irina Chernykh of the Central Asia-Institute argue that rumors of Karimov's resignation due to ill-health prompted the two leaders to try to seize power. Both leaders considered [[coup d’état]]s in 2004, early 2005, and in mid-2005.<ref name=CLANTHEORY>[http://216.109.125.130/search/cache?p=resignation+Karimov+andijan&ei=UTF-8&fr=yfp-t-501&x=wrt&u=www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/CEF/Quarterly/February_2007/Burnashev_Chernykh.pdf&w=resignation+karimov+andijan&d=MPllo_mdOfRN&icp=1&.intl=us Changes in Uzbekistan’s Military Policy after the Andijan Events] Central Asia-Institute Silk Road Studies Program</ref>

During the unrest security forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense acted as police forces. Ministry of Interior troops were abolished and counter-terrorism divisions were put under the command of the Ministry of Defense or the National Security Service, run by the Tashkent clan. Karimov fired Defense Minister Kadyr Gulyamov, Interior Minister Almatov, Head of the Joint Headquarters of the Armed Forces Ismail Ergashev, and Commander of the Eastern military district Kosimali Akhmedov. Karimov replaced Almatov with the deputy director of the Uzbek National Security Service, a member of the Tashkent clan. This greatly shifted control of security to the Tashkent clan which has traditionally controlled the National Security Service.<ref name=CLANTHEORY/><ref name=IM>[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/08/970cdfca-adb7-4c9c-856b-526cef00273b.html Uzbekistan: Karimov appears to have political clans firmly in hand] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty</ref> Analysts had previously suggested that the Interior Ministry, under Almatov's leadership, had organized the 1999 Tashkent bombings. Others have suggested the bombings were done by the SNB under the leadership of Rustam Inoyatov, who at the time led the Tashkent clan. Analysts suggested a series of bombings in 2004 in Tashkent and [[Bukhara]] may have been done by the SNB against the MVD.<ref name=BOMBINGS>[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/04/51d08217-f03f-4906-9cc7-6224a3cff08b.html Uzbekistan: Islam Karimov vs. The clans] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty</ref>

Dilyor Jumabayev, a prominent member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, later said in an interview in Kara-Suu, Kyrgyzstan that in February 2005 agents of Uzbekistan's secret police offered to pay Hizb ut-Tahrir members to overthrow Andijan's government; "But we refused. They said they were sick and tired of Karimov's regime. But we said, 'After Karimov will come another Karimov.' We said such things are sin. We did not participate."<ref name=JUMBAYEV>[http://www.truthout.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/37/12913 Uzbek refugees are forced to wait out diplomatic storm] The Washington Post</ref>

Obidov, initially put under [[house arrest]], is now imprisoned in Tashkent. Karimov replaced Begaliyev with Akhmad Usmanov, the former security head of the Interior Ministry of [[Namangan province]], on October 13, 2006.<ref name=CLANNOW>[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav101906.shtml Political purge in Uzbekistan indicates president is "afraid of his own nation"] EurasiaNet</ref>
