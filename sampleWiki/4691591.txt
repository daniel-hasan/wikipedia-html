'''Cydonia Mensae''' is an [[albedo feature]] (region) on [[Mars]]. It lies in the planet's northern [[Northern Hemisphere|hemisphere]] in a transitional zone between the heavily [[Impact crater|crater]]ed regions to the South, and relatively smooth [[plains]] to the North.  Some [[planetary science|planetologists]] believe that the northern plains may once have been [[seabed|ocean bed]]s<ref>Head, J.W., Kreslavsky, M., Hiesinger, H., Ivanov, M., Pratt, S., Seibert, N., Smith, D.E. and Zuber, M.T.

==The Face on Mars==

One of the Cydonian mesas, situated at 40°75' north [[latitude]] and 9°46' west [[longitude]], took on the striking appearance of a [[humanoid]] Face on Mars in a photo taken by [[Viking 1]] on [[July 25]], [[1976]].  This discovery was made independently by two computer engineers named at [[NASA]]'s [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], Vincent DiPietro and Gregory Molenaar.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} While searching through NASA archives they discovered two misfiled images, Viking frames 35A72 and 70A13.  When the images were originally acquired in 1976, Viking chief scientist Gerry Soffen dismissed the "face" in image 35A72 as "a trick of light and shadow" which "disappeared several hours later"{{Fact|date=November 2007}}.  However, the second "face" image, 70A13, was acquired 35 Viking orbits later and at a different "sun-angle" to the 35A72 image.  Subsequently, DiPietro and Molenaar developed an [[image processing]] technique (Starburst Pixel Interleaving Technique) to [[Super-resolution|increase the resolution]] of the original images (the technique was validated using [[Landsat]] images){{Fact|date=November 2007}}.

Some commentators, most notably [[Richard C. Hoagland]], believe it to be evidence of a long-lost [[life on Mars|Martian civilization]] along with other features they believe are present, such as apparent [[pyramid]]s, which they argue are part of a [[ruins|ruined city]]. [[Image analysis]] of the early Viking images led a few researchers to suggest that the features of the Face might not be an accidental consequence of viewing conditions<ref name="carlotto88"/>. 

However, today it is generally accepted to be an [[optical illusion]], an example of [[pareidolia]]<ref>Britt, R.R., [http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/03/17/alien.debunk/index.html Scientist attacks alien claims on Mars], [[CNN]], [[18 March]] [[2004]].  Retrieved [[12 October]] [[2007]].</ref>. After analysis of the higher resolution [[Mars Global Surveyor]] data [[NASA]] stated that "a detailed analysis of multiple images of this feature reveals a natural looking Martian hill whose illusory face-like appearance depends on the viewing angle and angle of [[illumination]]"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_60.html | title=The Face on Mars, Viking Project | publisher= [[NASA]] website | accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref>.  Similar optical illusions can be found in the geology of [[Earth]]; an example is the [[Badlands Guardian]], which resembles a human head wearing a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[headgear|headress]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://maps.google.com/maps?z=16&ll=50.010083,-110.113006&spn=0.009363,0.020084&t=k&iwloc=addr | title=Badlands Guardian Geological Feature | publisher=[[Google Maps]] | accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref>.

Originally, eighteen images of the Cydonia Mensae region were taken by the [[Viking 1]] and [[Viking 2|2]] [[orbiter]]s, but only seven have resolutions better than 250 m/[[pixel]] (820 ft/pixel). The other eleven images have resolutions worse than 550 m/pixel (1800 ft/pixel) and are virtually useless for studying the feature. Of the seven good images, the lighting and time at which two pairs of images were taken are so close as to reduce the number to five usable, distinct images. The ''Mission to Mars: Viking Orbiter Images of Mars'' CD-ROM image numbers are: 35A72 (VO-1010), 70A13 (VO-1011), 561A25 (VO-1021), 673B56 & 673B54 (VO-1063), and 753A33 & 753A34 (VO-1028)<ref>[http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/Admin/resources/cd_viking.html ''Mission to Mars: Viking Orbiter Images of Mars'' website], [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]; raw data in [[Alphabetical_list_of_file_extensions#I|IMQ (ImageQ) format]] can be downloaded from these links: [http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/geo/vo1_vo2-m-vis-2-edr-v2/vo_1010/f035axx/f035a72.imq 35A72], [http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/geo/vo1_vo2-m-vis-2-edr-v2/vo_1011/f070axx/f070a13.imq 70A13], [http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/geo/vo1_vo2-m-vis-2-edr-v2/vo_1021/f561axx/f561a25.imq 561A25], [http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/geo/vo1_vo2-m-vis-2-edr-v2/vo_1063/f673bxx/f673b56.imq 673B56],

Since September [[2006]], a succession of new data from the Cydonia region have been published by the [[European Space Agency]] and the [[HiRISE]] team.  These have included photographs taken by the [[Mars Express|Mars Express probe]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM09F8LURE_index_0.html | title=Cydonia - the face on Mars, 3D rendering of Mars Express imagery | publisher=[[ESA]] website | accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref> and the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/PSP/diafotizo.php?ID=PSP_003234_2210 | title=Popular Landform in Cydonia Region | publisher=[[HiRISE]] website | accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref> and a 3D animation of the "Face on Mars" using a combination of digital data from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on the [[Mars Express]] probe and the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) on board NASA's [[Mars Global Surveyor]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMINCO7BTE_0.html | title=Cydonia's 'Face on Mars' in 3D animation using Mars Global Surveyor imagery | publisher=[[ESA]] website | accessdate=2007-04-26}}</ref>  In contrast to the relatively low resolution of the Viking images of Cydonia, these new platforms afford much improved resolution.  For instance, the Mars Express images are at a resolution of 14 m/pixel (46 ft/pixel) or better.

Cydonia and the Face on Mars appear frequently in [[popular culture]], including [[feature film]]s, [[television series]], [[video game|videogames]] and even [[popular music|music]]<ref>For example: Film - ''[[Mission to Mars]]'' (2000); TV series - ''[[The X-Files]]'' ("[[Space (The X-Files)|Space]]", 1993), ''[[Futurama]]'' ("[[Where The Buggalo Roam]]", 2002); Videogames - ''[[Zak McKracken]]'' (1988), ''[[X-COM: UFO Defense]]'' (1993); Music - ''[[Telemetry of a Fallen Angel]]'' by [[Cruxshadows]] (1995), "[[Knights of Cydonia]]" by [[Muse (band)|Muse]] (2006).</ref>.  Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] criticized many conclusions people have made about it in his book ''[[The Demon Haunted World]]''.
