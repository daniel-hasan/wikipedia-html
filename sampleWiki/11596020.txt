The '''1975 unnamed hurricane''' was an unusual [[Pacific hurricane|Pacific]] [[tropical cyclone]] that attained hurricane status farther north than any other Pacific hurricane. The twelfth tropical cyclone of the [[1975 Pacific hurricane season]], it developed from a cold-core upper-level low merging with the remnants of a tropical cyclone on [[August 31]], well to the northeast of [[Hawaii]]. Convection increased as the circulation became better defined, and by early on [[September 2]] it became a tropical storm. Turning to the northeast through an area of warm water temperatures, the storm quickly strengthened, and, after developing an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], it attained hurricane status late on [[September 3]], while located about 1200&nbsp;miles (1900&nbsp;km) south of [[Alaska]]. After maintaining peak winds for about 18&nbsp;hours, the storm rapidly weakened, as it interacted with an approaching [[cold front]]. Early on [[September 5]], it lost its identity near the coast of Alaska.

On [[August 26]], the [[tropical cyclone]] that was once [[1975 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Ilsa|Hurricane Ilsa]] degenerated into a remnant [[low pressure area]] about 1200&nbsp;miles (1950&nbsp;km) west of the southern tip of the [[Baja California Peninsula]].<ref name="1975mwr">{{cite web|author=Robert A.

The [[extratropical storm|cold-core low]] rapidly intensified as convection increased, and late on [[August 31]] it absorbed the remnants of Ilsa,<ref name="tcr"/> which influenced the development of the system.<ref name="potm"/> Convection steadily organized as it tracked westward, and it is estimated it transitioned into a [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical depression]] by 18:00&nbsp;[[UTC]] on [[September 1]].<ref name="potm"/>

With warm water temperatures,<ref name="potm"/> the system strengthened and began to develop [[tropical cyclogenesis|tropical characteristics]]. Subsequent to the development of [[squall|banding features]], convection contracted and deepened over the increasingly well-defined center, and is estimated it became a tropical storm by early on [[September 2]] while located about 685&nbsp;miles (1100&nbsp;km) north of the Hawaiian island of [[Kauai]]. The storm quickly developed a [[tropical cyclone#structure|central dense overcast]], and by 00:00&nbsp;UTC on [[September 3]] [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] began on the cyclone.<ref name="tcr"/> With water temperatures of over 82&nbsp;째[[Fahrenheit|F]] (28&nbsp;째[[Celsius|C]]),<ref name="potm"/> it strengthened rapidly as an approaching [[cold front]] caused it to accelerate to the northeast. An [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] became apparent on satellite imagery, and the storm intensified into a hurricane at 18:00&nbsp;UTC on [[September 3]], while located about 1170&nbsp;miles (1885&nbsp;km) south of [[Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve]] in [[Alaska]].<ref name="tcr"/> Upon becoming a hurricane, the cyclone was small, measuring about 85&nbsp;miles (140&nbsp;km) in diameter.<ref name="potm"/>

Operationally, the hurricane was not classified due to lack of ship confirmation; by the time it became a hurricane, the strongest winds reported by a ship was 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) about 80&nbsp;miles (130&nbsp;km) southeast of the center. Additionally, upon developing a closed eyewall, the cyclone was beginning to interact with the frontal system to its west. However, late on [[September 3]], a ship reported a pressure of 1003&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] with a 3-hour tendency increase of 13.5&nbsp;mb, suggesting a minimum pressure of under 990&nbsp;mbar.<ref name="tcr"/> At the time, the storm maintained a T-number of 4.0, resulting in estimated winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) and an estimated pressure of 987&nbsp;mbar.<ref name="potm"/> Maintaining hurricane status for about 18&nbsp;hours, the storm continued rapidly northeastward and weakened due to strong [[wind shear]] from the approaching cold front. Early on [[September 5]], it is estimated the cyclone became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] in the [[Gulf of Alaska]] while located about 315&nbsp;miles (510&nbsp;km) southwest of [[City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska|Juneau, Alaska]]. The circulation was rapidly absorbed by the front,<ref name="tcr"/> and the remnants quickly reached the coast of [[British Columbia]].<ref name="potm"/> The remnants of the storm turned southeastward, and was last tracked definitively to a point north of [[Montana]].<ref name="tcr"/>

==Impact and records==
[[Image:Unnamed Storm (1975).png|right|thumb|200px|Cyclone shortly before becoming a tropical storm]]
At 18:00&nbsp;UTC on [[September 3]], a ship named ''Pluvius'' recorded 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h) winds near the center of the storm. At 06:00&nbsp;UTC on [[September 4]], a vessel with the name of ''Transcolorado'' recorded winds of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) about 120&nbsp;miles (200&nbsp;km),<ref name="1975mwr"/> the strongest reported winds in association with the tropical cyclone; the ship also reported 27&nbsp;foot (8.5&nbsp;m) swells.<ref name="tcr"/> No significant land impact occurred in association with the cyclone, and no fatalities were reported.<ref name="potm"/>

Forming at 31째&nbsp;[[Latitude|N]], the storm formed farther north than any other [[Pacific hurricane|Pacific]] tropical cyclone at the time, though, in 2000, [[2000 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Wene|Tropical Storm Wene]] formed farther to the north.<ref name="epachurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2007|title=Hurricane Data for Pacific Hurricanes 1949-2006|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2007-07-08|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2006_epa.txt|format=TXT}}</ref> The cyclone marked the first known occurrence of a mid-Pacific upper tropospheric low developing into a tropical cyclone,<ref name="1975cphc">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|title=The 1975 Central Pacific Tropical Cyclone Season|accessdate=2007-07-10|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1975.php}}</ref> though [[2002 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane Fausto|Tropical Storm Fausto]] in 2002 redeveloped in a similar occurrence to the hurricane.<ref name"2002cphc">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|title=The 2002 Central Pacific Tropical Cyclone Season|accessdate=2007-07-10|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/2002.php}}</ref> The cyclone attained hurricane status at 40째&nbsp;N, a record for a Pacific hurricane.
