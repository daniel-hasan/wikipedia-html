"'''Can I Have It like That'''" is a [[pop rap]] song performed by rapper [[Pharrell Williams]] featuring [[Gwen Stefani]].  It was written and produced by Williams for his 2006 debut album ''[[In My Mind (Pharrell album)|In My Mind]]'', and the song is the [[opening track]].  The song's [[hook (music)|hook]] comes from a one-line contribution from Stefani, used as part of a [[call and response (music)|call and response]] in the chorus.  The song received generally negative reviews from music critics.

"Can I Have It like That" was released as the album's [[lead single]] in October 2005 (see [[2005 in music]]).  It was commercially unsuccessful in the [[United States]], but fared somewhat better worldwide.  A [[rock music|rock]] [[remix]] of the song featured [[Travis Barker]] playing the [[drum]]s and Pharrell playing the [[guitar]].

==Background and composition==
[[P. Diddy]] was originally designated to use the track that Williams created.  Several other artists were also interested in using it, but Williams changed his mind and decided to use the song himself.<ref>Bainbridge, Luke.  [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,1607765,00.html "Just Williams"].  ''[[The Observer]]''.  [[November 6]], [[2005]].  Retrieved [[October 17]], [[2007]].</ref>  In mid 2005, he worked with Stefani in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] on her second solo album ''[[The Sweet Escape]]'' (2006).  While she was in the booth recording "Breakin' Up", he told her that he had a song he thought would be his first single.  Stefani asked to hear it, and he said that he wanted to record her for the track after the two finished working on "Breakin' Up".  Stefani, however, insisted that they work on "Can I Have It like That" then, and Williams recorded her performing the song's [[hook (music)|hook]].<ref>Reid, Shaheem and Bland, Bridget.

==Critical reception==
"Can I Have It like That" received generally negative reviews from music critics.  Josh Tyrangiel of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called it an "odd opener" to ''In My Mind'' and remarked that Williams "never commits to putting his hips into it", leaving the track without any climax.<ref name="ew"/>  ''[[The Observer]]''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Luke Bainbridge, however, referred to the song as "a grinding instant smash".<ref>Bainbridge, Luke.

Retrieved [[October 23]], [[2007]].</ref>  For [[IGN]], Spence Abbott described Williams' rapping as "a little sticky, but…ruggedly appealing in a manner of speaking", and commented that "it's the shuffling and infectious beat…that will have you swerving and slinking like a cobra with epilepsy."<ref name="IGN"/>  In his review for ''[[Slant Magazine]]'', Preston Jones characterized the song as "curiously inert", adding that it sounded better as a [[sampling (music)|sample]] on [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]]'s 2006 [[mashup (music)|mashup]] album ''[[Night Ripper]]''.<ref>Jones, Preston.

Stefani's presence as a featured artist on the song received negative reviews from music critics.  [[About.com]]'s Ivan Rott commented that the song's [[funk]] sound "definitely [[wikt:knock|knocks]]", but was disappointed in Stefani's contribution, finding its repetition tedious.<ref>Rott, Ivan.

Retrieved [[October 18]], [[2007]].</ref>  Evan McGarvey of ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' also found it repetitive, and described "Can I Have It like That" as "a brief distillation of everything calamitous about [Williams'] and [[Chad Hugo]]'s production style".<ref name="stylus"/>  ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that Stefani's part was the only catchy [[hook (music)|hook]] on ''In My Mind'', but added that it "seems to be built around a one-line cast-off found on the ''[[Love Angel Music Baby]]'' factory floor."<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1824855,00.html "Pharrell, In My Mind"].  ''[[The Guardian]]''.  [[July 21]], [[2006]].  Retrieved [[October 18]], [[2007]].</ref>  Finding "Can I Have It like That" a "slow burner" that offered a "promising hint at what else is to come" on ''In My Mind'', Claire Simpson stated in her [[OMH Media]] review that Stefani's contribution was "purely cosmetic and clearly a transparent means of getting her name on the single to not only boost her own credentials but to help draw Pharrell to the attention of her increasingly mainstream following."<ref name="OMH"/>

==Music video==

The song's music video was directed by [[Paul Hunter (director)|Paul Hunter]].  It depicts Williams being watched by a secret organization.  Aware that he is being watched, he talks to a woman, revealed to be Stefani, on the phone.  He makes appearances at an exclusive boat party and at another party in his penthouse.<ref name="mtv2">Vineyard, Jennifer.

Retrieved [[October 18]], [[2007]].</ref>  There are intercut sequences of people including Williams and Stefani dancing in front of a large equalizer, Williams standing in front of explosions, and people skateboarding.<ref name="mtv1"/>

The music video was filmed in late September 2005.  The cinematography is designed so that the music video becomes the secret organization's surveillance of Williams.  It uses shifting [[camera angle]]s to create tension.<ref name="mtv2"/>  The scenes in front of the equalizer were filmed in front of a [[chroma key|greenscreen]], and the explosion sequences were shot live on the streets of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].  In the penthouse scene, he is accompanied by two naked women with leopard-pattern [[body paint]] and a baby cougar.  Hunter came up with the idea of showing body-painted women, and Williams suggested sitting with the cougar because he "wanted to exude power."<ref name="mtv1"/>

The video had little success on video chart programs.  To date, it is Williams' only video as a main artist to debut on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]''.<ref>[http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/?s=debuts "The TRL Archive - Debuts"].  ATRL.
