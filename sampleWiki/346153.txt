The '''Columbia River Highway''' is a [[highway]] built in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] along the [[Columbia River]] between 1913 and 1922. When the [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]] portion was first paved in 1916, it was the first major paved [[highway]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Once completed, it ran from [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]] to [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]], a total of 196 miles. It is an [[All-American Road]].

The original highway was promoted by lawyer and entrepreneur [[Samuel Hill|Sam Hill]] and engineer [[Samuel Lancaster]], to be modeled after the great scenic roads of [[Europe]]. From the very beginning, the roadway was envisioned not just as means of traveling by the then popular [[Model T]], but designed with an elegance that took full advantage of all the natural beauty along the route.

When the [[United States highway]] system was officially established in 1926, the highway became the first and then westernmost segment of what became [[U.S. Route 30]]. Since then, modern [[Interstate 84 (west)|Interstate 84]] has been built parallel to the highway between [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and The Dalles, replacing it as the main travel route and resulting in the loss of some of the original sections of road.

Today, the modern Columbia River Highway ('''Highway 2''') uses I-84 from Portland to east of [[Boardman, Oregon|Boardman]], and then [[U.S. Route 730]] northeast to the [[Washington]] state line. There is also a '''Lower Columbia River Highway''' ('''Highway 2W''', sometimes '''Highway 92'''), using U.S. 30 from [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]] to Portland. Between [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]] and [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]], much of the original highway is part of the '''Historic Columbia River Highway''' ('''Highway 100'''.)

==Present-day "Historic Columbia River Highway"==
Modern highways, including I-84, and other developments have resulted in the abandonment of major sections of the historic original highway. In the interest of [[tourism]] and historical preservation, seventy-four miles of the original road—from Troutdale to The Dalles—have been established as the '''Historic Columbia River Highway''' (HCRH). Forty miles of the route are open to motor vehicles:
*The 24 westernmost miles starting in [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]] (at the eastern edge of urban [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]) provide access to dozens of hiking trails, [[Crown Point, Oregon|Crown Point]] Vista House, and numerous [[waterfall]]s such as [[Multnomah Falls]]. This section forms a loop with the [[Mount Hood Scenic Byway]].
*The 16 easternmost miles ending in The Dalles.

The remaining portions of the HCRH designated for non-motorized use are now known as the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail. These are being developed as money becomes available. Roughly seven miles between [[Hood River, Oregon|Hood River]] and [[Mosier, Oregon|Mosier]] have been open to non-motorized traffic since 2000, passing through the historic Mosier Tunnels.<ref>{{cite news

Once restoration is complete, the highway will serve as a scenic and alternative bicycle route for I-84 and US-30 between The Dalles and Portland. Currently, cyclists wishing to travel between these two towns must ride on the shoulders of I-84 for much of the distance, or the much more dangerous and narrow [[State Route 14 (Washington)|State Route 14]] on the Washington side of the river.

The Columbia River Highway is the nation's oldest scenic highway. In 1984 it was recognized as a [[List of historic civil engineering landmarks#United States landmarks|National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. In 2000 it was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[National Park Service]] as "an outstanding example of modern highway development".
