'''Fashion in 15th century Europe''' is characterized by a series of extremes and extravagances, from the voluminous gowns called [[houppelande]]s with their sweeping floor-length sleeves to the revealing [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]]s and [[hose (clothing)|hose]] of [[Renaissance Italy]].  [[Hat]]s, [[hood]]s, and other [[headdress]]es assumed increasing importance, and were swagged, draped, jewelled, and [[feather]]ed.

As Europe continued to grow more prosperous, the urban middle classes, including skilled workers, began to wear more complex clothes that followed, at a distance, the fashions set by the elites.  National variations in clothing seem on the whole to have increased over the century.<ref name="Boucher">Boucher, François: ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', Harry Abrams, 1966.</ref> 

==General trends==
[[Image:Petrus Christus 003 detail.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Bold pomegranate- or artichoke-patterned silks are characteristic of the 15th century, as are richly coloured velvets and woolens.  Fine linen was important for headdresses and for the shirts and chemises revealed by new lower necklines and slashing.]]
===Dominance of the Burgundian court===
With England and France mired in the [[Hundred Years War]] and its aftermath and then the English [[Wars of the Roses]] through most of the century, European fashion north of the [[Alps]] was dominated by the glittering court of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], especially under the fashion-conscious power-broker [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Good]] (ruled 1419-1469).  Having added [[Holland]] and [[Flanders]] to their dominion, the Dukes of Burgundy had access to the latest fabrics of Italy and the East and to English wool exports through the great trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]].<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume'', p. 199</ref>  Purchases of fabrics through Italian merchants like the two cousins [[Giovanni Arnolfini]] amounted to a noticeable proportion of all government expenditure.<ref> 2% to the elder Giovanni alone, in 1444-6, p195 National Gallery Catalogues, The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings, Lorne Campbell, 1998, ISBN 185709171X </ref>  Especially in Florence, where [[sumptuary law]]s prevented the citizens from wearing the most luxurious cloths on which the city's fortunes were built, the materials of men's clothing in particular often appear plain in paintings, but contemporaries who understood the difference in grades of cloth very well would have appreciated the beauty and great expense of a very fine grade. .<ref name="frick">Frick, Carole Collier. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0801869390 Dressing Renaissance Florence: Families, Fortunes, and Fine Clothing.] Johns Hopkins University Press (2002).</ref>

===Fabrics and furs===
[[Wool]] was the most popular [[textile|fabric]] for all classes by far, followed by [[linen]] and [[hemp]].<ref name="Koslin">Koslin, Désirée, "Value-Added Stuffs and Shifts in Meaning: An Overview and Case-Study of Medieval Textile Paradigms", in Koslin and Snyder, ''Encountering Medieval Textiles and Dress'', p. 237-240</ref>  Wool fabrics were available in a wide range of qualities, from rough undyed cloth to fine, dense [[broadcloth]] with a velvety nap; high-value broadcloth was a backbone of the [[England|English]] economy and was exported throughout Europe.<ref name="Crowfoot">Crowfoot, Elizabeth, Frances Prichard and Kay Staniland, ''Textiles and Clothing c. 1150 - c. 1450''</ref>  Wool fabrics were dyed in rich colours, notably reds, greens, golds, and blues, although the actual blue colour achievable with dyeing with [[woad]] (and less frequently [[indigo]]) could not match the characteristic rich [[lapis lazuli]] [[pigment]] blues depicted in contemporary [[illuminated manuscript]]s such as the ''[[Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]''.<ref name="Koslin" />
[[Silk]]-weaving was well-established around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] by the beginning of the century, and figured silks, often silk [[velvet]]s with silver-gilt [[weft]]s, are increasingly seen in Italian dress and in the dress of the wealthy throughout Europe.  Stately floral designs featuring a [[pomegranate]] or [[artichoke]] motif had reached Europe from [[China]] in the previous century and became a dominant design in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] silk-producing cities of [[Istanbul]] and [[Bursa]], and spread to silk weavers in [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and [[Seville]] in this period. <ref name="Koslin" /> <ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_Of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=20&item=12%2E49%2E8&viewMode=0&section=description Late 15th century Italian (Venice) Velvet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art]</ref>

Fur was worn, mostly as a lining layer, by those who could afford it.  The grey and white squirrel furs of the Middle Ages, [[vair]] and [[miniver]], went out of style except at court, first for men and then for women; the new fashionable furs were dark brown [[sable]] and [[marten]].  Toward the end of the century, wild animal furs such as [[lynx]] became popular.<ref>Favier, Jean, ''Gold and Spices: The Rise of Commerce in the Middle Ages'', 1998, p. 66</ref>  [[Ermine]] remained the prerogative and hallmark of royalty.

===Slashing===
Contemporary chroniclers identify the source of the fashion for slashing garments (to reveal a lining or full undergarment beneath) to the actions of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] soldiers in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Grandson]] in [[1476]].<ref>Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', p. 78</ref>  Supposedly the Swiss plundered the rich fabrics of the [[Burgundy|Burgundian]] nobles and used the scraps to patch their tattered clothes. In reality, images appear of sleeves with a single slashed opening as early as mid-century, although the German fashion for "many small all-over slits" may have begun here.<ref>Payne, op cit p.241, </ref> Whatever its origin, the fad for multiple slashings spread to [[Germany|German]] [[Landsknechts]] and thence to France, Italy, and England, where it was to remain a potent current in fashionable attire into the mid-[[1600-1650 in fashion|seventeenth century]].

A second result of the defeat at Grandson was the decline of Burgundy as a fount of culture and fashion.  The heiress [[Mary of Burgundy]] married [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] but died young.  In the last decade of the century, [[Charles VIII of France]] [[Italian Wars|invaded Italy]] and was briefly declared [[Kingdom of Naples|King of Naples]].  As a result, the French nobility were introduced to the fabrics and styles of Italy, which would combine with German influence to dominate fashion in France (and later, England) in the [[1500-1550 in fashion|first half of the sixteenth century]].<ref>Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion'', chapters 3 and 4 ''passim''</ref>

==Women's fashion==
===Gown, kirtle, and chemise===

[[Image:Maria van Bourgondi.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Mary of Burgundy]] wears a headdress comprising a truncated-cone hennin, a jewelled padded roll, and a sheer veil.]]
Women's fashions of the fifteenth century consisted of a long gown, usually with sleeves, worn over a [[kirtle]] or undergown, with a linen [[chemise|chemise or smock]] worn next to the skin.  The long-waisted silhouette of the [[1300-1400 in fashion|previous period]] was replaced by a high-waisted style with fullness over the belly, often confined by a belt.  The wide, shallow scooped neckline was replaced by a V-neck, often cut low enough to reveal the decorated front of the kirtle beneath.

Various styles of overgowns were worn. The ''[[cotehardie]]'' fitted smoothly from the shoulders to the hips and then flared by means of inserted triangular gores.  It featured sleeves tight to the elbow with hanging streamers or ''tippets''. The tight fit was achieved with lacing or [[button]]s. This style faded rapidly from fashion in favor of the houppelande, a full robe with a high collar and wide sleeves that had become fashionable around 1380 and remained so to mid-century.<ref name="Payne">Payne, Blanche: ''History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century'', Harper & Row, 1965.</ref> The later houppelande had sleeves that were snug at the wrist, making a full "bag" sleeve.  The bag sleeve was sometimes slashed in the front to allow the lower arm to reach through.

Around 1450, the gown of northern Europe developed a low V-neck that showed a glimpse of the square-necked kirtle.  The neckline could be filled in with a sheer linen partlet.  Wide turn-backs like revers displayed a contrasting lining, frequently of fur or black velvet, and the sleeves might be cuffed to match.  Sleeves were very long, covering half of the hand, and often highly decorated with embroidery.  Fine sleeves were often transferred from one dress to another.

In Italy, the low scoop-neck of the early decades gave way to a neckline that was high in front with a lower V-neck at the back at mid-century.  This was followed by a V-neckline that displayed the kirtle or ''gamurra'' (sometimes spelled ''camorra'').  Sleeveless overgowns were popular, and the gamurra sleeves displayed were often of rich figured silks.  A sideless overgown called the ''giornea'' was also worn with the gamurra or kirtle.  Toward the end of the period, sleeves were made in sections or panels and slashed, allowing the full chemise sleeves below to be pulled through in puffs along the arm, at the shoulder, and at the elbow.  This was the beginning of the fashion for puffed and slashed sleeves that would last for two centuries.<ref name="Payne" />

The ''partlet'', a sort of separate yoke to fill in a low neckline, appeared in this period, usually of sheer fabric (linen or possibly silk) with an open V-neckline.  Burgundian partlets are usually depicted worn under the gown (but over the kirtle); in Italy the partlet seems to have been worn over the gown and could be pointed or cut straight across at the lower front.

Two uniquely Spanish fashions appear from the 1470s. The ''verdugada'' or ''verdugado'' was gown with a bell-shaped [[hoop skirt]] with visible casings stiffened with reeds, which would become the [[farthingale]].  The earliest depictions of this garment come from [[Catalonia]], where it is worn with pieced or slashed sleeves and the second new style, a chemise with trumpet sleeves, open and very wide at the wrist.<ref name="Boucher" />

The sideless surcoat of the [[1300-1400 in fashion|14th century]] became fossilized as a ceremonial costume for royalty, usually with an ermine front panel (called a ''plackard'' or ''placket'') and a mantle draped from the shoulders; it can be seen in variety of royal portraits and as "shorthand" to identify queens in illuminated manuscripts of the period.

===Hairstyles and headdresses===

A variety of hats and headdresses were worn in Europe in this century.

The ''crespine'' of Northern Europe, originally a thick hairnet or [[snood]], had evolved into a mesh of jeweler's work that confined the hair on the sides of the head by the end of the fourteenth century.  Gradually the fullness at the sides of head was pulled up to the temples and became pointed, like horns (''à corné'').<ref name="Payne" />

By mid-century, the hair was pulled back from the forehead, and the crespine, now usually called a ''caul'', sat on the back of the head.  Very fashionable women shaved their foreheads and eyebrows.

Any of these styles could be topped by a padded roll, sometimes arranged in a heart-shape, or a veil, or both. [[Veil]]s were supported by wire frames that exaggerated the shape and were variously draped from the back of the headdress or covered the forehead.

Women also wore the chaperon, a draped hat based on the [[hood]] and [[liripipe]], and a variety of related draped and wrapped [[turban]]s.

The most extravagant headdress of Burgundian fashion is the [[hennin]], a cone or truncated-cone shaped cap with a wire frame covered in fabric and topped by a veil.  Later hennins feature a turned-back brim, or are worn over a hood with a turned-back brim <ref>M. Vibbert, ''Headdresses of the 14th and 15th Centuries'', The Compleat Anachronist, No. 133, SCA monograph series (August 2006)</ref>.

Women of the merchant classes in Northern Europe wore modified versions of courtly hairtyles, with coifs or caps, veils, and [[wimple]]s of crisp linen (often with visible creases from ironing and folding). A brief fashion added rows of gathered frills to the coif or veil; this style is sometimes known by the German name ''kruseler''.<ref name="Kohler">Kõhler, ''History of Costume''</ref>.

The general European convention of completely covering married women's hair was not accepted in warmer Italy.<refname="Payne" />  Italian women wore their hair very long, wound with ribbons or braided, and twisted up into knots of various shapes with the ends hanging free.  The hair was then covered with sheer veils or small caps.  Toward the 1480s women wore chin-length sections of hair in loose waves or ripples over the ears (a style that would inspire "vintage" hair fashions in the [[1600-1650 in fashion|1620s and '30s]] and again in the [[1840s in fashion|1840s]] and [[1850s in fashion|1850s]]).  Blond hair was considered desirable (by [[Botticelli]] for one), and visitors to Venice reported that ladies sat out in the sun on their terraces with their hair spread out around large circular disks worn like hats, attempting to bleach it in the sun.  Chemical methods were also used.

===Shirt, doublet, and hose===
The basic costume of men in this period consisted of a shirt, doublet, and hose, with some sort of overgown.

Linen shirts were worn next to the skin.  Toward the end of the period, shirts (French ''[[chemise]]'', Italian ''camicia'', Spanish ''camisa'') began to be full through the body and sleeves with wide, low necklines; the sleeves were pulled through the slashings or piecing of the doublet sleeves to make puffs, especially at the elbow and the back of the arm.  As the cut of doublets revealed more fabric, wealthy men's shirts were often decorated with [[embroidery]] or applied braid.  

Over the shirt was worn a doublet.  From around the mid-century very tight-fitting doublets, belted or tailored to be tight at the waist, giving in effect a short skirt below, were fashionable, at least for the young. Sleeves were generally full, even puffy, and when worn with a large chaperon, the look was extremely stylish, but very top-heavy.  Very tight hose, and long pointed shoes or thigh-boots gave a long attenuated appearance below the waist, and a chunky, solid one above.  The doublet was often elaborately pleated, especially at the back, the pleats being achieved by various means.  In Italy both shirt and doublet were often high, tight and collarless at the front of the neck; sometimes they are shown higher at the front than the back.

Men of all classes wore short ''braies'' or [[Breeches#Etymology|breeches]], a loose undergarment, usually made of linen, which was held up by a belt.  [[Hose (clothing)|Hose]] or [[chausses]] made out of wool were used to cover the legs, and were generally brightly colored.  Early hose sometimes had leather soles and were worn without shoes or boots.  Hose were generally tied to the breech belt, or to the breeches themselves, or to a [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]]. 

As doublets became shorter, hose reached to the waist rather than the hips, and were sewn together into a single garment with a pouch or flap to cover the front opening; this evolved into the [[codpiece]].  

The hose exposed by short tops were, especially in Italy late in the century, often strikingly patterned, parti-coloured (different colours for each leg, or vertically divided), or embroidered. Hose were cut on the [[bias (textile)|cross-grain or bias]] for stretch. <ref name="Kohler" />

===Gowns and outerwear===
The [[Houppelande]], in Italy called the ''cioppa'', is the characteristic overgarment of the wealthy in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name="Laver">Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref>.  It was essentially a gown with fullness falling from the shoulders in organ pleats<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume''</ref> and very full sleeves often reaching to the floor with, at the start of the century, a high collar.  The houppelande could be lined in fur, and the hem and sleeves might be dagged or cut into scallops.  It was initially often worn belted, but later mostly hanging straight.  The length of the garment shortened from around the ankle to above the knee over this period.  The floor-length sleeves were later wrist-length but very full, forming a bag or sack sleeve, or were worn off the arm, hanging ornamentally behind.  

A sideless overgown or [[tabard]], called a ''giornea'' in Italy and a ''journade'' in France<ref>Boucher, François: ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', p, 197</ref>, was popular.  It was usually pleated and was worn hanging loose or belted.  Young men wore them short and older men wore them calf- or ankle-length. 

The middle of the century in Burgundy saw what seems to have been the earliest occurrence of the male fashion for dressing all in black, which was to reappear so strongly in the "Spanish" style of the mid-16th&ndash;17th century and again in the 19th&ndash;20th centuries.  This was apparently begun by Duke [[Philip the Good]].<ref>Anne Hollander, ''Seeing through Clothes'',1978, The Viking Press,ISBN 0380487772</ref> 

In [[Venice]], the patrician class, after the age of joining the [[Republic of Venice#Government|Great Council]], wore their long red robes as a uniform virtually unchanged throughout the century.  In contrast, the young men and the famous [[courtesan]]s of the city dressed very extravagantly. 

In the last decades of the century, a new style of [[gown]] appeared; this was of various lengths, generally worn unbelted, and featured wide turned back revers and collar.<ref>Parry, ''History of Costume'', p. 219-20</ref>

Short or long [[cloak]]s or mantles were worn overall for ceremonial occasions and in bad weather; these typically fastened on one shoulder.

===Headgear===
[[Image:Italienischer Meister des 15. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Young Italian men wear brimless caps, ''The Betrothal'', c. 1470<ref>Boucher, ''20,000 Years of Fashion'', p. 214</ref>]]
Early in the century, the hood remained a common component of dress for all classes, although it was frequently worn around the neck as a cowl or twisted into the fantastical shapes of the [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]].  [[Hat]]s of various styles&mdash;tall-crowned with small brims or no brims at all, or low-crowned with wider brims pulled to a point in front&mdash;began to compete with the draped chaperon, especially in Italy.<ref>Laver, ''Concise History of Costume and Fashion''</ref> A brimless scarlet cap became nearly universal for young Florentines in particular, and was widely worn by older men and those in other cities.

In mid-century, a bowl haircut with the hair shaved at the back of the neck was stylish.  In Germany, and briefly in Venice, a wide shock of frizzy blond hair was often seen on images of lovers (and angels) in the later part of the century - less often in portraits.   By the end of the century, shoulder-length hair became fashionable, a trend that would continue into the [[1500-1550 in fashion|early 16th century]].

==Footwear==

During most of the fifteenth century, both men and women wore narrow shoes with pointed toes.  Very long pointed shoes, called ''[[poulaine]]s'' or ''crackowes'' (after their reputed [[Poland|Polish]] origin), were popular early in the period.<ref>Laver, ''Concise History of Costume'', pages 71-72</ref>.  They stayed in fashion longer in Northern Europe.  [[Pattens]], or wooden [[clog]]s with cloth straps over the instep, were worn over poulaines and other soft shoes outdoors and in public areas (see picture below and [[:Image:Walraversijde49.jpg|photo]]).  A blunt toed-shoe began to appear in the last decades of the century.
