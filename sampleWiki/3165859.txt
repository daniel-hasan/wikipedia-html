The '''De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School''' ('''DLSZ''', '''De La Salle Zobel''' or '''Zobel''') is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] institution for boys and girls located in [[Muntinlupa City]], [[Metro Manila]], the [[Philippines]].  It was opened in 1978 by the [[De La Salle Brothers in the Philippines]] because of the increasing number of students in the [[grade school]] department of the former De La Salle College (Now, [[De La Salle University-Manila]]) in [[Manila]].<ref name="history">[http://www.zobel.dlsu.edu.ph/history.asp About Zobel : History] [http://www.zobel.dlsu.edu.ph/history.asp zobel.dlsu.edu.ph] Accessed May 16, 2006</ref>

== Background ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LS star.png|left|120px|Seal of the Brothers of the Christian Schools]] -->
The first De La Salle School in the Philippines,[[De La Salle University-Manila|De La Salle College]] was opened on [[June 16]], [[1911]] on Calle Nozaleda in Paco, [[Manila]], at the request of the [[Archbishop of Manila]], [[Jeremiah James Harty]] to the [[Brothers of the Christian Schools]].  It is interesting to note that Archbishop Harty had a very close affinity to La Salle since he was schooled in his grade school and high school years in the U. S. in De La Salle Christian Brother-run schools. In 1921, the school moved to its present site on [[De La Salle University-Manila|Taft Avenue]] and the Brothers have since opened schools in Greenhills, [[Mandaluyong City]]; [[Antipolo, Rizal]]; [[Lipa City]], [[Batangas]]; [[Bacolod, Negros Occidental]]; [[Iligan]], [[Lanao del Norte]]; [[Dasmariñas, Cavite]] and Alabang, [[Muntinlupa City]].<ref>[http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/brothers/delasalle-years.asp De La Salle: 1911-1986] [http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/history.asp dlsu.edu.ph] Accessed May 16, 2006</ref>

== History ==

[[Image:John baptist de la salle 1.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Saint [[John Baptist de La Salle]], the founder of the Christian Brothers]]De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School, a member-school of [[De La Salle Philippines]], Inc., was established on [[March 29]], [[1978]] after it was decided that the [[elementary education|elementary]] department of [[De La Salle University-Manila|De La Salle College]] be moved to a location that is more suitable and conducive to learning.   A high school department was also formed to assure the graduates of Zobel's elementary department of placement in [[secondary education]].<ref name="yo25">"Zobel @ 25." ''Young Observer''. Jun-Nov 2006.</ref>

The school is located in Muntinlupa's [[Ayala Alabang Village]] and was made possible through a joint donation of part of the campus's eleven hectare lot by the [[Ayala Corporation]] and the Madrigal Family, with the rest of the lot acquired through financing provided by the [[Filipinas Life Assurance Company]].  The school's location in Southern [[Metro Manila]] also helps in achieving the government's goal of dispersing educational institutions over the Metro, as well as the goal of the Brothers in the Philippines of making their resources available to as many communities as possible.<ref name="history" />

De La Salle Zobel opened in [[June]] [[1978]] with an initial offering of [[Kindergarten|Prep]] to Grade Six Levels.  The Grade School Department became fully operational when Grade 7 was added in June [[1979]] and in June [[1980]], the High School Department opened, initially without [[Freshman]] classes.  It became fully operational in June [[1983]].  Br. Raymond Bronowicz FSC, then the Vice-President for Administration of De La Salle University-Manila, was appointed as Zobel's first director.<ref name="history" />

In 1985, Brother V. Felix Masson FSC, who first came to the Philippines as a young De La Salle Christian Brother in 1938 and who survived the Japanese Occupation of the Philippines, was appointed to replace Brother Raymond as De La Salle Zobel's Director.

In this view, alterations to the natural elements of the lot were kept at a minimum.<ref>[http://www.manosa.com/dlsz.htm De La Salle Zobel] [http://www.manosa.com/ manosa.com] Accessed May 16, 2006</ref>

When the school opened in [[1978]], there was only one building available for use, the St. La Salle Building, then called the "Main Building."  At present, the campus is composed of a number of structures which have been necessitated by the burgeoning school population.  The following major buildings are found on campus:

=== St. La Salle Building ===

[[Image:ZobelFacadex.jpg|thumb|220px|The façade of the St. La Salle Building (Main Building) of DLSZ]]The first building on the campus, it houses the Grades 4 to 7 classes as well as the Freshmen to Junior classes.  The basement level, which was formerly a canteen-cum-multi-purpose hall was turned into the school's ''Learning Resource Center'' in 1992.  It is composed of two libraries: the [[Antonio Montemayor Anievas]] Memorial Library (High School) and the [[Jacobo Santiago Zobel]] Memorial Library (Grade School), audio-visual rooms, the School Archives, and the libraries' Non-Print Center.
  
In 2005, the central garden separating the Grade School and High School laboratories was converted into a ''Cyber Nook'' which houses a considerable number of computers available for use by the school community.  

[[Image:Facade DLSZ.jpg|thumb|220px|The façade with the statue of St. La Salle and the flagpole|left]]The ground floor also once housed the offices of the Registrar, the Director, and the Grade School Principal.  These offices have since been moved to the newly-renovated [[Mutien-Marie Wiaux]] Building.  At present, the Main Chapel, the Deborah Decena Auditorium, the [[amphitheater]], the Information Systems Office, the [[medical]] and [[dentistry|dental]] clinics, and the office of the School [[Chaplain]] may be found at the ground floor.

The second floor of the St. La Salle Building once housed the School Library, but with its transfer to the basement, the former library space is now home to the Faculty Rooms, as well as to the offices of the different Subject Coordinators.  All of ''Zobel'''s science laboratories are also found on the second floor, as well as one computer laboratory.  The offices of the Teachers' Union and the Adult Night High School are also found on the second floor.  

On the third floor are three computer laboratories and the office of the High School Assistant Principal.  Also found within the St. La Salle Building are two pocket gardens, as well as a [[botanical garden]] at the rear of the building.  All classrooms in this building are equipped with  [[LCD projector]]s and computers with connection to the Internet.

=== Saint Brother Mutien-Marie Building ===

In [[2005]], the Administration Building or the St. Brother Mutien-Marie Building, underwent a total renovation.  It was one of the earliest building on campus and now houses all the administrative offices of Zobel including the offices of the Director, the Grade School Principal, the High School Principal, the Registrar, and the Accounting Department.  Prior to its renovation, it housed the Sewing and Cooking classes of the high school Freshmen and Sophomores, and it featured a mock-up of a house's [[living room]] and [[bedroom]].  It featured a fully-equipped [[kitchen]] that was capable of handling four sets of ''student-chefs'' as well as a classroom that was equipped with 50 sewing machines.  These classes have since been moved to the St. Joseph Building

The building is named after St. Brother Mutien-Marie Wiaux, a De La Salle Christian Brother who taught St. Bertuin’s School in Malonne, [[Belgium]] where he taught for fifty-eight years.  He was [[canonization|canonized]] in [[1989]] by [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]].

=== St. Joseph and THELE Buildings ===

[[Image:SJ-Building.jpg|220px|thumb|The stained glass marker of the St. Joseph Building]]Named after one of the most famous carpenters in history, the [[St. Joseph]] Building is home to all of the school's ''[[Home Economics]] and Livelihood Education'' classes, including ''Shop'', ''Automotive/Driving'', ''Practical Gardening'', ''Practical Electricity'', ''Cooking'', and ''Sewing'', among others.  In [[2004]], an annex, the THE Building, was built to decongest the original building which was built in [[1992]].  The building houses the Automotive/Driving and Electricity classes at the ground floor, including the garage for the class vehicles, while a gym (Gym 3) occupied the second floor.  In [[2005]], a model home was built by the back of the original building to house the Cooking and Sewing classes.  The original building once housed art classes as well as rehearsal rooms for the [[DLSZ Band]] and doubles as transient offices for some of the school's units while some buildings on campus are undergoing renovation. For school year 2007-2008, the THELE building has been transformed to a Seniors (4th year) building due to the many other students that applied during its enrollment period thus adding section I to some of the Grade and High School levels.<ref name="yo25" />

=== Brother Flavius Leo FSC Hall ===

The Br. Flavius Leo FSC Hall, which houses the school's main [[canteen]] was built in 1991 with the initial [[food service]] management being handled by ''[[The Aristocrat Restaurant|The Aristocrat]]'' Restaurant of [[Engracia Reyes]].  The immediate past handler of the canteen management was Race Foods, Inc. and at present, it is handled by La Casita, which also handles management of the DLSU-Manila canteens at the [[Enrique M. Razon Sports Center]] and the [[Br. Andrew Gonzalez Hall]].  The canteen is fully air-conditioned and also houses a Teachers' Lounge.  While this is the main school canteen, a mini-canteen is also located in the Br. Felix Hall.  It was named after Br. Flavius Leo FSC, one of the [[De La Salle Brothers in the Philippines#The Massacre of February 12.2C 1945|sixteen Christian Brothers who were massacred]] in the Most Blessed Sacrament Chapel of De La Salle University-Manila on Taft Avenue, Manila during the [[Battle for the Liberation of Manila]] in [[World War II]].

=== Br. V. Felix Masson and St. Br. Miguel Halls ===

=== Vaugirard ===

[[Image:RecoHouse.jpg|220px|thumb|The bridge leading to the entrance of the Vaugirard]]The Recollection House, officially known as The Vaugirard, is a gated compound which is place of contemplation and is where most official school [[recollection]]s and [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]]s are held.  It is located at the far Western end of the campus and is physically secluded from the main grounds by extensive gardens and foliage.  It is named after Vaugirard, [[France]], the location where St. John Baptist De La Salle founded his first [[novitiate]].<ref>[http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/ncd04390.htm Saint John Baptist de La Salle] [http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/ncd04390.htm New Catholic Dictionary] Accessed May 16, 2006</ref>  A house was built there by the Brothers to serve as a venue wherein they could meet to strengthen their relationships through fellowship and prayer.<ref>[http://www.dasma.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/ULFO/program.htm  University Lasallian Family Office - Formation Programs] [http://www.dasma.dlsu.edu.ph/ dasma dlsu.edu.ph] Accessed May 16, 2006</ref>  The ground floor of the Vaugirard also served as an erstwhile faculty room for some of the Grade School faculty while the St. Br. Miguel Hall was being constructed.

=== Cadlum Hall ===

[[Image:CadlumHall.jpg|right|thumb|220px|The Independent Teachers Union garden in front of Cadlum Hall]]Built at the site of the former stand-alone Gym 2, the Cadlum Hall was built to house a multi-purpose hall and the school bookstore at the ground floor, with the Gym 2 being converted to a dedicated [[basketball court]] at the second floor.  Its front lawn features a garden, which was donated by the Teachers' Union, as well as a [[gazebo]], which housed the former offices of the school's [[yearbook]] the ''Green, Gold, and White''.

The school also has a full-sized [[Football field]], which is located behind the Mutien-Marie Building, as well as [[baseball field|baseball]] and [[softball]] fields, which are located by The Vaugirard. Because of these facilities, Zobel has been host to many athletic competitions, especially [[soccer]] matches, including the much awaited match-ups between De La Salle Zobel, [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo de Manila]] and brother-La Salle school[[La Salle Green Hills]].

[[Image:DLSZ Logo Clear Background.png|right|150px|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 8 December 2007}}|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 8 December 2007}}]]
*The ''double A'', which divides the bottom part of the [[shield]], is derived from the [[logo]] of the [[Ayala Corporation]], which donated the land on which the school stands.  

*The bottom center bears the ''star of faith'', or [[Signum Fidei]], which is taken from the official seal of the [[De La Salle Brothers]] and below it are the ''three broken chevrons'', which are taken from the [[coat of arms]] of the De La Salle family.

*A ''palm branch with 16 leaves'' at the shield's bottom left pays tribute to the sixteen De La Salle Christian Brothers who were [[De La Salle Brothers in the Philippines#The February 12.2C 1945 Massacre|massacred in Manila]] during its [[Battle for the Liberation of Manila|liberation by American forces]] in [[1945]].

''Three small stars'' at the corners of this part of the shield are taken from the [[Coat of arms of the Philippines]].

*The upper section of the shield contains a ''cross and rays'', which serve as reminders that a Lasallian education should lead every student to [[Christ]] and to spread the [[Good News]] of God's Kingdom.

*Above the shield is a ''[[dove]]'' with spread wings.  This signifies peace as well as the [[Holy Spirit]].

*The school seal is depicted in colors of [[green]], [[Gold (color)|gold]], and [[white]]. ''Green'' represents [[hope]] and [[confidence]], while ''gold'' represents [[love]] and ''white'' represents peace and purity of [[faith]] and [[morals]],
