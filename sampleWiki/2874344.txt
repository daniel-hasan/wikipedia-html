Many '''Japanese words of Portuguese origin''' entered the [[Japanese language]] when [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Jesuit]] priests introduced Christian ideas, Western science and technology, among other things to the Japanese during the [[Muromachi]] period (15-16th century).  

==List of loanwords==

Many of the words which entered Japanese from Portuguese and [[Japanese words of Dutch origin|Dutch]] are written in ''[[kanji]]'' or ''[[hiragana]]'' rather than ''[[katakana]]'', which is the more common way to write loanwords in Japanese.  ''Kanji'' versions of the words are ''[[ateji]]'', characters added to the words by the Japanese, based on either the pronunciation or the meaning of the word.

The sign † shows that the word is a historical, extinct one.

==Arigatō==

{{wiktionary|有り難う}}

It is often suggested that the Japanese word ''arigatō'' derives from the Portuguese ''obrigado'', both of which mean "Thank you", but this is not true.  The Japanese phrase ''arigatō'' is a shortened form of ''arigatō gozaimasu'', meaning "Thank you".  This is a form of an adjective, ''arigatai'', for which written records exist dating back to the [[Man'yōshū]], well before Japanese contact with Portugal.<ref>[http://linguistlist.org/issues/12/12-1871.html LINGUIST List 12.1871, Sun Jul 22 2001 Sum: Origins of Arigato]</ref> 

The full derivation is ''arigatō'' < ''arigatau'' < ''arigataku'' < ''arigatashi'' < ''ari'' + ''katashi''. The medial ''-k-'' drops out from ''-aku-'' resulting in /au/. This then becomes /oː/ via regular phonological rules. ''Ari'' is a verb meaning "to be" and ''katashi'' is an adjective meaning "difficult". The original meaning of "arigatashi" was "difficult to be", ie "rare" and thus "special".
