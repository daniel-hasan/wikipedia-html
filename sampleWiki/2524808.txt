{{portal|Evangelion}}

This is a '''list of characters''' in the [[Japanese culture|Japanese]] [[anime]] ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' and the movies ''[[Evangelion: Death and Rebirth]]'' and ''[[The End of Evangelion]]''. The characters were designed by [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]].

==Characters' ages and birth years==
Most of ''Evangelion'' 's characters' ages were plotted before broadcasting the TV series, but their birthdays were not settled<ref>plan reports of Neon Genesis Evangelion(Newtype 100% Collection vol.29 Neon Genesis Evangelion pp85-88, 1997, Kadokawa Shoten, ISBN 978-4048527002)</ref>. After the TV series finished, GAINAX released birthdays which were similar to those of each character's seiyuu, except Rei Ayanami, Toji Suzuhara, Kensuke Aida and Kaworu Nagisa<ref>Eva Tomo no Kai(lit.Eva Fan Club) vol.8, the liner notes bundled with Neon Genesis Evangelion Genesis0:8(VHS and LD, Sep.5,1996)</ref>.This time, the characters' birth years were still not revealed.

Adult characters' birth years were simply calculated from their age, but there was an additional aspect in determining the children's ones. According to the Japanese educational system, in 2015 second graders of junior high school (eighth graders) are basically made up of children who were born from April 2, 2001 to April 1, 2002<ref>Japanese School Education Law Article 22 and 39, Japanese Law of Age Culculating, Japanese Cibil Law Article 143</ref>. Children's birth years were set in proportion to this rule. However these birth years did not change the children's ages of 14 in year 2015. This is the reason why Asuka Langley Soryu and Toji Suzuhara were born in December 2001 and Hikari Horaki was born in February 2002, despite all children except Kaworu are 14 in 2015.

==Children==
In the Japanese dialogue for the original anime, the Eva pilots were always referred to as "Children," even when referring to an individual pilot; the entries below use this designation. The English translation referred to the individual pilots as First Child, etc. In the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' series, the expression "(n)th Children" is not used. Instead, the pilots are referred to as "一番目の適格者(Ichibanme no tekikaku-sha: lit.The First Qualified Person/Candidate)", "第一の少女(Dai-ichi no Shojo: lit.The First Girl), "三人目の子供(San'nin-me no kodomo: lit.The Third Child)", or "第三の少年(Dai-san no Shonen: lit.The Third Boy).

Rei Ayanami (綾波 レイ ''Ayanami Rei'') is the First Children, and the pilot of [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Unit 00 (Zerogōki: 零号機)|Unit 00]]. At the start of the series, she is shown to be [[Extraversion vs Introversion|socially withdrawn]], emotionless, and remote, with her only apparent relationship being with Gendo Ikari.<ref name="Episode 5">''"Evangelion'', [[Rei I|episode 5]]</ref> As the series progresses, she and Shinji grow closer<ref>''Evangelion'', episodes [[Rei II|6]], [[FOURTH CHILDREN|17]], and 23</ref>; Asuka, however, has little to do with her, insulting her by calling her a "doll" or "puppet."<ref name="Episode 22">''Evangelion'', [[Don't Be.|episode 22]]</ref> Rei and Asuka are in many ways polar opposites, and their contrasts factor heavily into their respective relationships with Shinji. It is eventually revealed that Rei is a vessel for the soul of the Angel [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Lilith|Lilith]]<ref>''Evangelion'', episode 24, "Director's Cut"</ref>, and was created specifically by Gendo to be used as a tool for accomplishing Instrumentality<ref name="Episode 25">''Evangelion'', [[Do you love me?|episode 25]]</ref>. Soulless clones of her are kept hidden in the deepest levels of NERV headquarters to be used as the supposed "cores" of the [[Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary#Dummy Plug|Dummy Plugs]].<ref name="Episode 23">''Evangelion'', [[Rei III|episode 23]]</ref>

In ''The End of Evangelion'', Rei usurps control of Instrumentality from Gendo by absorbing [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Adam|Adam]] into herself and merging with Lilith on her own, becoming a god-like being.

Asuka Langley Soryu (惣流・アスカ・ラングレー ''Sōryū Asuka Rangurē'') is the Second Children and the pilot of [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Unit 02 (Nigōki: 弐号機)|Unit 02]]. She is of mixed German and Japanese descent, but her nationality is American. Asuka is brash, egotistical, and often verbally abusive (especially to Shinji)<ref>''Evangelion'', episodes [[Both of You, Dance Like You Want to Win!|9]] and 22, for example</ref>, and has a very high opinion of her appearance and her considerable skill as an Eva pilot.<ref name="Episode 8">''Evangelion'', [[ASUKA STRIKES!|episode 8]]</ref> She also has a fierce desire for independence. Her attitude, however, is a front masking deep-seated insecurities stemming from her traumatic childhood.<ref name="Episode 22"/> Asuka is openly infatuated with Ryoji Kaji, but is also attracted to Shinji; however, she cannot properly express her affections.<ref>''Evangelion'', episodes [[MAGMADIVER|10]] and [[Those women longed for the touch of others' lips, and thus invited their kisses.|15]], for example</ref> She also deeply dislikes Rei, seeing her as a cold, emotionless doll.<ref name="Episode 22"/>

Over the course of the series, Asuka's effectiveness as a pilot dwindles, culminating in a decisive defeat by the Angel [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Arael|Arael]]. She becomes depressed and ultimately [[coma]]tose<ref name="Episode 24">''Evangelion'', [[The Beginning and the End, or "Knockin' on Heaven's Door"|episode 24]]</ref>, and is tended in NERV's infirmary until ''The End of Evangelion''. In ''The End of Evangelion'', Asuka is saved from being assassinated and engages and defeats both the JSSDF forces attacking NERV headquarters and the [[Evangelion (mecha)#Mass Production (MP) Evangelions (Units 05 - 13)|Mass-Produced Evas]]. However, the MP Evas return to life and destroy Unit 02, ostensibly killing Asuka. At the end of the film, she and Shinji are the last humans on the planet still in physical form.

'''English voice actor:''' [[Spike Spencer]]

Shinji Ikari (碇 シンジ ''Ikari Shinji'') is the Third Children and the pilot of [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Unit 01 (Shogōki: 初号機)|Unit 01]]. He is the son of Gendo and the "late" Yui Ikari. Abandoned by his father when he was a toddler<ref name="Episode 20">''Evangelion'', [[WEAVING A STORY 2: oral stage|episode 20]]</ref>, Shinji has grown up to be reclusive and withdrawn, choosing to often run away from difficult situations.<ref name="Episode 4">''Evangelion'', [[Hedgehog's Dilemma (Neon Genesis Evangelion episode)|episode 4]]</ref> Over time and with encouragement from Misato, he learns to be less cowardly, more outspoken, and more confident, but his progress is undone near the end of the series.<ref name="Episode 24"/> He becomes friends with Toji Suzuhara and Kensuke Aida, something more than friends but not quite anything else with Rei, and enters into a confused [[love-hate relationship]] with Asuka. The vicious cycle of his and Asuka's relationship becomes the focal point of Shinji's emotional turmoil, coming to a head near the end of the series and in ''The End of Evangelion''. He struggles to make his father more involved in his life<ref>''Evangelion'', episodes [[WEAVING A STORY|14]] and 15, for example</ref>, but gives up hope of reconciliation after the battle against the Angel Bardiel (''see Toji's section for details'').

In ''The End of Evangelion'', Shinji is saved from assassination by Misato, and is able to leave the GeoFront in Unit 01, only to be forced to become part of Instrumentality by the MP Evas. The merged Rei/Lilith being gives Shinji control of Instrumentality, and Shinji opts to live as a separate human being. At the end of the movie, he and Asuka are the last humans with physical form.

Touji Suzuhara (鈴原 トウジ ''Suzuhara Tōji'') is the Fourth Children. Touji is a tough boy, the stereotypical "jock," and is in constant conflict with Asuka. His younger sister was injured in the battle between the third Angel, [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Sachiel|Sachiel]], and Unit 01, and he beats Shinji up soon after for being indirectly responsible. However, after witnessing firsthand the suffering Shinji experiences piloting Unit 01 in the battle against [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Shamshel|Shamshel]], Touji comes to respect Shinji and the two eventually become friends.<ref name="Episode 3">''Evangelion'', [[A transfer|episode 3]]</ref>

Touji's Eva, [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Unit 03 (Sangōki: 参号機)|Unit 03]], is taken over by the thirteenth Angel, [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Bardiel|Bardiel]], and is eventually destroyed by Unit 01, which was under the control of the Dummy Plug system. <ref>''Evangelion'', [[AMBIVALENCE (Neon Genesis Evangelion episode)|episode 18]]</ref> He is severely injured when his Entry Plug is crushed; in the manga, he is killed.

He is sent to [[Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary#NERV|NERV]] by [[Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary#SEELE|SEELE]] as a replacement pilot for Unit 02 after Asuka's synchronization ratio falls below viability; however, his true purpose is to hasten the [[Human Instrumentality Project]]'s implementation. He verbally expresses love toward Shinji, though the show's creator denied allegations that Kaworu was homosexual. He breaks into [[Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary#Terminal Dogma|Terminal Dogma]] to return to Adam and initiate the Third Impact, but upon discovering that the being there is actually Lilith, he implores Shinji to destroy him.<ref name="Episode 24"/> After his death, Kaworu is not seen again until ''The End of Evangelion'', where he appears in the beginning and middle of Third Impact.

He also bears a resemblance to director Hideaki Anno.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

===Deputy Commander Kōzō Fuyutsuki===
'''Age:''' Unknown (about 60)<br />
'''Sex:''' Male<br />
'''Birthday:''' [[April 9]]<br />
'''Relations:''' Unknown<br />
'''Japanese seiyu: '''[[Motomu Kiyokawa]]<br />

: [[Guil Lunde]] (series)<br />[[Michael Ross (actor)|Michael Ross]] (movies)

Kōzō Fuyutsuki<ref name="essay">{{cite web | title=''Evangelion'' character names | work=Translation of essay by [[Hideaki Anno]] about character name origins; includes a link to the original essay in Japanese | url=http://www.evacommentary.org/appendix/character-names.html | accessdate=August 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> (冬月 コウゾウ ''Fuyutsuki Kōzō'') is NERV's Deputy Commander and Gendo Ikari's right hand man. He does not especially like Gendo, but he is the closest thing to a confidant that Gendo has in the series.

Once a professor of meta-biology at [[Kyoto University]], Fuyutsuki became interested in the research and theories undertaken by Yui Ikari, and became her sponsor and mentor. Shortly thereafter, he was directed by his superiors to initiate a similar arrangement with Gendo Rokobungi. He bailed Rokobungi out of jail, and took him on as a research assistant, although he took an instant disliking to Gendo (thinking of him as a "real bastard"<ref>''Evangelion'', episode 21, "Director's Cut"</ref>) and was stunned when Yui later announced that she and Gendo were getting married. Later, after the Second Impact, Fuyutsuki traveled with Gendo to Antarctica and began to suspect that Gendo and his associates in SEELE were more powerful and dangerous than he originally realized. During this voyage, Gendo revealed that he had taken the name of Ikari. In 2003, Fuyutsuki discovered the true nature of the events leading up to Second Impact and SEELE's involvement in initiating that catastrophe for himself, and threatened Gendo with exposure of the massive deception concerning Second Impact to the public. Gendo led him into the GeoFront and [[Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary#Central Dogma|Central Dogma]], revealed to him an incomplete prototype Eva, and asked Fuyutsuki to join him and "create a new future for humankind, together with me." Fuyutsuki accepted the offer, but whether this agreement was out of idealism or self-preservation is not made clear in the series. In ''The End of Evangelion'' it is mentioned that SEELE had threatened Fuyutsuki with being 'disappeared', implying that his recruitment may have been a [[Hobson's choice]].<ref name="Episode 21"/>

Although Fuyutsuki was never more than a mentor and friend to Yui, it is implied that he was in love with her to some degree, as he was shocked to learn that she was marrying Gendo. In ''The End of Evangelion'' Lilith/Rei takes the form of Yui to achieve Fuyutsuki's Instrumentality.

'''English voice actor:''' [[Aaron Krohn]]

Kaji appears to be a triple agent, working as a special inspector for NERV while secretly investigating NERV for the Japanese government, and at times seemingly acting as a cat's-paw both for and against Gendo Ikari and SEELE. During college, he and Misato were lovers, but after having long broken up, they see each other again on the UN fleet ferrying Unit 02 and Asuka to Japan.<ref name="Episode 8"/> After he returns to NERV headquarters, Kaji and Misato rekindle their romance following a period of teasing and insults, when Misato confesses that she broke up with him because she realized that he reminded her of her father. He is eventually shot and killed by an unnamed assailant after defying SEELE one time too many<ref>''Evangelion'', [[INTROJECTION (Neon Genesis Evangelion episode)|episode 19]]</ref>, but not before giving Misato information regarding the truth of the Instrumentality Project.

Makoto Hyuga<ref name="essay"/> (日向 マコト ''Hyūga Makoto'') is a First Lieutenant at NERV and one of the three main computer technicians directly serving under Commanders Ikari and Fuyutsuki in the command post of Central Dogma, the others being Aoba and Ibuki. Hyuga at first gives the impression of being something of a nerd, reading manga while on his break time, but is a highly skilled technician. His quick thinking and bravery help save NERV headquarters from the attack by [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Matariel|Matariel]], and he acts as a spy for Misato, helping her obtain information regarding NERV's machinations. He also arms NERV's self-destruct mechanism at Misato's order during Kaworu's attempt to breach Terminal Dogma.<ref name="Episode 24"/> Hyuga states that he couldn't think of a better way of ending his life than being beside Misato. The true extent of his feelings for Misato is shown in ''The End of Evangelion'' as Rei/Lilith takes the form of Misato during Instrumentality and passionately kisses him; as he embraces her, he reverts to LCL.

===First Lieutenant Maya Ibuki===
'''Age:''' 24<br />
'''Sex:''' Female<br />

'''English voice actor:'''
:[[Kendra Benham]] (series)<br />[[Amy Seeley]] (movies)<br />[[Monica Rial]] ("Director's Cut" episodes)

Maya Ibuki<ref name="essay"/> (伊吹 マヤ ''Ibuki Maya'') is a First Lieutenant at NERV and a computer technician who works primarily with Ritsuko Akagi. Her main role during the battles against the Angels is to constantly monitor the Eva pilots’ synchronization ratios and send various emergency commands to the Evas as ordered by Misato or Gendo. In spite of her profession, Maya despises violence of any sort, and is frequently shown becoming nauseous and averting her eyes during battles with the Angels, especially after Unit 01's battles with Bardiel and [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Zeruel|Zeruel]]. Notably, in ''The End of Evangelion'', Maya is the only NERV officer who is shown refusing to fight back against the [[Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary#Japanese Strategic Self Defense Forces (JSSDF)|JSSDF]] invaders. She rejects the gun Aoba hands her to defend herself, saying, "I can't shoot this thing", not because she is unskilled, but because she has never shot it at a human being. Throughout much of the second half of ''The End of Evangelion'' Maya is hiding under her desk with her face buried in a pink pillow.

Maya holds Ritsuko in very high regard, and always refers to her as "[[senpai]]." In ''The End of Evangelion'', Rei/Lilith penetrates Maya's AT field by assuming the form of Ritsuko and typing "I need you" on Maya's laptop. Maya exclaims "Senpai!", eagerly embraces "Ritsuko," and immediately reduces into [[Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary#LCL|LCL]]. This has led fans to debate whether or not Maya's feelings for Ritsuko have romantic or sexual undertones, in the same manner as the debate over the relationship between Shinji and Kaworu.

Shigeru Aoba<ref name="essay"/> (青葉 シゲル ''Aoba Shigeru'') is a First Lieutenant at NERV and a computer technician. At times a stereotypical [[metalhead]], he is a cynical [[Nihilism|nihilist]] and plays [[guitar]] (he can also sometimes be seen playing [[air guitar]]). Of the three technicians seen regularly in Central Dogma, his character is explored the least in the series.

In ''The End of Evangelion'', during Instrumentality, Rei/Lilith appears to him not as any loved one but rather as a bombardment of Reis which forces their way through his AT Field while he cowers and screams in horror under his desk.

Naoko Akagi<ref name="essay"/> (赤木 ナオコ ''Akagi Naoko'') was Ritsuko's mother. She was the creator of the [[Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary#MAGI Super Computer System|MAGI]] system<ref>''Evangelion'', [[LILLIPUTIAN HITCHER|episode 13]]</ref> and the former [[Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary#GEHIRN|GEHIRN]] head technician. Naoko was involved in a romantic relationship with the recently-widowed Gendo Ikari while working at GEHIRN. However, after Rei I called her an "old hag" and said that Gendo himself called Naoko that frequently, she realized that he had merely been using her affections to ensure her performance for him. In a fit of rage, Naoko strangled Rei to death and then either committed suicide or was murdered by an unknown assailant.<ref name="Episode 21"/> Soon afterward, GEHIRN was disbanded and the organization NERV was formed in its place.

In vol. 10 of [[Neon Genesis Evangelion (manga)|the manga]], Naoko is shown to commit suicide after killing Rei I. Ritsuko witnesses both Rei's murder and Naoko's suicide.

In the manga, Kyoko and her husband divorced after they were unable to conceive a child and he had an affair. He re-married and had a daughter, while Kyoko visited a sperm bank and was impregnated. She tried to poison Asuka against her ex-husband's daughter, referring to her as "that girl," but after the contact experiment this dissociation was transferred to Asuka's doll. At one point, Kyoko tried to strangle Asuka.

At some time between Second Impact and 2015, most of his body below the neck was replaced with cybernetic implants. Although he uses his visor to see, production drawings show that he still has eyes. 

Some fans believe him to be the character from the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] legend of [[The Wandering Jew]], but there is no evidence in the series or from any other source to support this claim. News clippings with Lorenz's picture dating 20 years prior to the story show him visibly younger.

The inspiration for his name originates from [[Konrad Lorenz]], a zoologist known especially for his research on animal psychology.<ref name="essay">{{cite web | title=''Evangelion'' character names | work=Translation of essay by [[Hideaki Anno]] about character name origins; includes a link to the original essay in Japanese | url=http://www.evacommentary.org/appendix/character-names.html | accessdate=August 19 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

In the manga, his name is given as ''Lorenz Kiel''.

'''Relations:''' Father (unnamed) (works for NERV, unknown division)<br />

Kensuke Aida<ref name="essay"/> (相田 ケンスケ ''Aida Kensuke'') is an [[otaku]], a military buff, Toji's best friend, and one of the "Other Children," Eva pilot candidates in the same class as Shinji, Toji, Rei, Asuka, and Hikari. His hobbies include camping in the mountains surrounding Tokyo-3 and playing at simulated war reenacting - by himself. Kensuke solidifies his friendship with Shinji after Shinji saves him and Toji during the fight against the fourth Angel, Shamshel.<ref name="Episode 3"/> Kensuke dreams of becoming an Eva pilot and ceaselessly begs Shinji to pull strings in NERV so he can be selected as a pilot, despite Shinji telling him that he has no say in the matter. He also seems oblivious to the intense physical and psychological distress endured by Eva pilots. Nevertheless, Kensuke enjoys the privileges of being the friend of an Eva pilot; he and Toji accompany Shinji on the excursion to the UN combined naval fleet during the transportation of Unit 02.<ref name="Episode 8"/> Like presumably every one of Shinji's classmates, Kensuke's mother is deceased.<ref name="Episode 4"/> Like Toji, Kensuke has a crush on Misato Katsuragi. He is rarely seen without his camcorder at hand.

In the PS2 "Battle Orchestra" game, Kensuke is the appointed pilot to the EVA Unit 04, wearing a yellow plugsuit.

'''Relations:''' Sisters: Kodama, Nozomi<br />
'''Japanese seiyu:''' [[Junko Iwao]]<br />
'''English voice actor:''' [[Carol Amerson]]

Hikari Horaki<ref name="essay"/> (洞木 ヒカリ ''Horaki Hikari'') is the class representative of the class that Shinji and the other Eva pilots attend. Like all of her classmates, she is an unknowing Eva pilot candidate. She has a by-the-book demeanor and takes her responsibilities as "class rep" seriously. Although she frequently bickers with Toji, she reveals to Asuka that she has an enormous crush on Toji but is unable to openly express her feelings to him. She also appears to be Asuka's only friend. After the battle with Arael, Asuka seeks out Hikari and stays with her for an unspecified time. During a late evening she reveals her inner insecurities to Hikari, a testament to their friendship; however, Hikari appears saddened by the hateful words Asuka uses.

Hikari is an accomplished cook who appears to take care of her two sisters. Like presumably every one of Shinji's classmates, Hikari's mother is dead. However, no references were ever made as to whether her father is, either.

Her given name, and that of her unseen younger sister, Nozomi, and elder sister, Kodama, is also in reference to the names of the trains of the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] line.<ref name="essay"/>

He lives in a custom refrigerator in Misato's apartment, enjoys taking warm baths, eating whatever food he can get his hands (or wings) on, and going to [[hot springs]]. He also appears to have a relatively high degree of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], as he is also shown watching TV and reading newspapers.

According to the manga, he is the result of a [[genetics]] experiment at Misato's former workplace, and she adopted him after the experiment's conclusion rather than let him be [[animal euthanasia|euthanised]]. His wingtips have retractable [[claw]]s, which normal birds do not have.<ref>[http://eva.yahoo.co.jp/kagi/chara/character_15.html Pen Pen] Information and image ('''Japanese''')</ref>

She appears as a transfer student at the Children's school, and becomes the focus of Shinji's interest and Asuka's jealous ire. She is the pilot of another man-made replacement for the Evas, the ''Trident'', whose combat skills are somewhat more on par with the Evangelions', to whom they bear a resemblance in design compared to the ''Jet Alone'' robot. She also appears in ''Shinji Ikari Raising Project''. Like many ''Evangelion'' characters, Mana's family name, Kirishima, is taken from a World War II battleship.<ref>{{cite book

A shy female character, Mana Kirishima, starts at Shinji Ikari's school and immediately admits to finding him cute. Gradually, a relationship unfolds and they end up going on a date where they kiss. It turns out, however, that she is one of three test pilots of TRIDENT, a new competitor to the Evangelions, similar to Jet Alone (thus the name "Girlfriend of Steel"). Eventually, the other robot goes berserk and the Evas have to destroy it. Throughout the game, Asuka is constantly jealous of Shinji and Mana's relationship, consistent with her widely-speculated romantic feelings for Shinji. Rei is present but plays a rather background role in the story.

In the game, Mayumi is a bespectacled bookworm who somehow has the core of an Angel inside her body. She joins Shinji's class and befriends him, and like many of the ''Evangelion'' cast, has a dark history (her mother apparently committed suicide while Mayumi was a girl, much like Asuka's mother).

==Trivia==
The Director Hideaki Anno was influenced by Ryu Murakami's war novel ''Fascism in Love and Fantasy'' (''愛と幻想のファシズム''), and the names "Toji Suzuhara," "Kensuke Aida," and the surname "Horaki" come from this story, which was based on [[Kanji Ishiwara]], a Lieutenant General in Imperial Japan.<ref name="essay"/>

Many of the surnames of the characters in ''Evangelion'' are named after Japanese warships in [[World War II]].<ref name="essay"/>
