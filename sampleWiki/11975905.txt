'''USS ''L. Y. Spear'' (AS-36)''' was the lead ship of her class of [[submarine tender]]s, in service to the [[United States Navy]] from 1970 through 1996. She was named for [[Lawrence York Spear]], a former Navy lieutenant who played an integral role in submarine design at [[Electric Boat Company]] before and during World War II.

''L. Y. Spear'' was laid down by [[General Dynamics]] Corp. at [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] on [[5 May]] [[1966]]; launched on [[7 September]] [[1967]]; sponsored by the wife of Vice Admiral Schade, Commander, Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet; and commissioned on [[22 February]] [[1970]].

Designed primarily to service nuclear attack submarines, ''L. Y. Spear'' was assigned to Submarine Squadron 6 with [[Norfolk, Virginia]] as her home port. She had the capability to provide logistic and technical support for as many as 12 submarines and service four of them alongside simultaneously.

''L. Y. Spear'' was decommissioned on [[September 6]] [[1996]] and struck from the [[Navy Register]] on [[May 3]] [[1999]]. She is currently berthed at the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]], and is scheduled for disposal.
