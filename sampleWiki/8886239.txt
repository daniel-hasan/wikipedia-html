Because England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland form the four [[constituent countries]] of the UK, technically only the English divisions are ''regions'', with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish divisions being termed ''nations''.<ref name="nations-regions">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/nationsregions.shtml | title=BBC Press Office, Key Facts, BBC Nations and Regions | date=[[August]] [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref> UK-wide programming is referred to as ''national'' or ''network''.

For Sky Digital subscribers, ex-subscribers or those with ''[[Freesat from Sky]]'' cards in their decoder the local version associated with the address to which the card was issued will appear on channels 101 and 102.

==History==
From the launch of digital satellite on [[1 October]] [[1998]] until [[31 March]] [[2001]], there were four variants (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) of both BBC One and the new [[BBC Choice]] carried on all digital platforms. Only one version of [[BBC Two]] was available digitally, and this was shown throughout the UK.

[[BBC English Regions|BBC English regions]] became gradually available via [[Digital Terrestrial Television]] (later known as [[Freeview]]) over the next few years, as did the ''national'' versions of BBC Two. Announced by the BBC on [[16 October]] [[2001]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1604952.stm|date=[[17 October]] [[2001]]|title=Digital viewers get BBC regional news}}</ref> and operating from [[28 January]] [[2002]] until [[29 May]] [[2003]] transponder space was allocated to the five largest English regions: [[BBC London News]], [[South Today]], [[Midlands Today]], [[North West Tonight]] and [[BBC Look North (Yorkshire and North Midlands)|Look North]] (for Yorkshire & Lincolnshire), 'covering 70% of England’s population', <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/01_january/10/satellitenews.shtml|title=
English Regions launch first phase of digital satellite news service|date=[[10 January]] [[2002]]}}</ref> and were accessed 'using new interactive technology'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcgovernorsarchive.co.uk/annreport/report02/review_nations.txt|title=BBC Review of services: Nations & Regions}}</ref>. This meant that viewers had to press the "red button" to access the programmes, and could only watch the 6.30pm edition. Later all regions became available as standard, full-time channels.

Eventually, programming via digital mirrored that available via analogue, with the exception of any (now rare) regional variations on BBC Two in England and the extra "opt outs" on BBC Two in Wales.
