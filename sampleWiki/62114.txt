'''Louis XVIII''' ([[November 17]], [[1755]] – [[September 16]], [[1824]]), was a King of [[list of French monarchs|France]] and [[List of Navarrese monarchs|Navarre]]. The brother of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and uncle of [[Louis XVII of France|Louis XVII]], he ruled the kingdom from 1814 (although he dated his reign from 1795) until his death in 1824, with a brief break in 1815 due to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] return in the [[Hundred Days]]. He was a member of the [[House of Bourbon]].

==Early life==
Louis-Stanislas-Xavier was born on [[17 November]] [[1755]] in the [[Palace of Versailles]] in [[France]], the fourth son of [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729-1765)|Louis, Dauphin of France]], and his wife, [[Marie-Josèphe of Saxony]].  His paternal grandparents were King [[Louis XV of France]] and his consort, Queen [[Maria Leszczyńska]]. His maternal grandparents were King [[Augustus III of Poland]], also the [[Rulers of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], and his wife, the Archduchess [[Maria Josepha of Austria|Maria Josepha]], daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]]. At birth, he received the title of '''[[Count of Provence|Comte de Provence]]''', but after the death of his two elder brothers and the accession of his remaining elder brother as [[Louis XVI of France]] in 1774, he became [[heir presumptive]] and was generally known as ''[[Monsieur]]'', the traditional title of the eldest brother of the King. The later birth of two sons to Louis XVI left him third in line to the throne of France.

==Marriage==
On [[14 May]] [[1771]], Louis married [[Marie Josephine Louise of Savoy]], princess of [[Sardinia]] and of the [[Piedmont]] (1753–1810), third child and second daughter of [[Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia]] and Maria Antonieta of Bourbon, [[Infanta]] of [[Spain]]. Her maternal grandparents were [[Philip V of Spain]] and [[Elizabeth Farnese]]. Marie Josephine suffered two miscarriages, in 1774 and 1781. After this, the couple remained childless.

==During the Revolution==
During the events leading up to the [[French Revolution]], the Comte de Provence initially took a moderately liberal line opposing his brother, but the increasing radicalism of the Revolution very soon alienated him. In 1789, he initiated a plan to save the King and end the [[French Revolution]]. In order to finance this venture, the Comte de Provence (using one of his gentlemen, the [[Comte de la Châtre]], as an intermediary) commissioned the [[Thomas de Mahy, marquis de Favras|Marquis de Favras]] to negotiate a loan of two million [[franc]]s from the bankers Schaumel and Sartorius. Unfortunately, Favras took into his confidence certain officers by whom he was betrayed.

It was stated in a leaflet circulated throughout Paris on [[23 December]] [[1789]] that Favras had been hired by the Comte de Provence to organize an elaborate plot against the people of France. In this plot, the King, Queen and their children were to be rescued from the [[Tuileries Palace]] and spirited out of the country. Then the Comte de Provence was to be declared [[regent]] of the kingdom with absolute power.

Simultaneously, a force of 30,000 soldiers was to encircle Paris. In the ensuing confusion, the city's three main liberal leaders ([[Jacques Necker]], the popular [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Finance Minister of France]], [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], the [[List of mayors of Paris|mayor of Paris]], and the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Marquis de La Fayette]], the commander of the city's new [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]]), were to be assassinated.

Afterwards, the revolutionary city was to be starved into royal submission by cutting off its food supplies. As a consequence of the leaflet, Favras and his wife were arrested the next day, and imprisoned in the L'Abbaye Prison. Terrified of the consequences of the arrest, the Comte de Provence hastened to publicly disavow Favras, in a speech delivered before the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Commune of Paris]], and in a letter to the [[National Constituent Assembly]]. Favras was eventually executed in February, 1790. 

In coordination with his brother's unsuccessful [[flight to Varennes]], the Comte de Provence fled France in 1791.  He was living in exile in [[Westphalia]] when King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was guillotined in 1793. On the king's death, the Comte de Provence declared himself [[regent]] for his nephew [[Louis XVII of France|Louis XVII]], although the boy was being held in custody by the revolutionary government and never actually reigned. 

On the 10-year-old king's death in prison on [[8 June]] [[1795]], the Comte de Provence proclaimed himself King Louis XVIII, despite claims that [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] had written papers shortly before his execution and given them to his lawyer, [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]], accusing his brother of having betrayed the royal cause out of personal ambition and barring him from the succession to the throne.

In 1794, the Comte de Provence had established a court-in-exile in the Italian town of [[Verona]], which at the time was controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]]. There, he issued a declaration, written in part by [[Louis-Alexandre de Launay, comte d'Antraigues]], that he rejected all the changes that had been made in France since 1789, which effectively destroyed the position of moderate constitutional monarchists in France, who had hoped to restore the monarchy under a limited constitution which would codify most of the changes since the Revolution began. This prompted the famous remark that the exiled Bourbons had learned nothing and forgotten nothing. Due to complaints from the [[French Directory]], the Venetians expelled the pretender to the French throne from their territories in 1796.

In the years that followed, Louis XVIII moved all over Europe, living for a time in [[Russia]], before he settled in [[England]].  From 1804 to 1805 Louis XVIII lived in Latvia, in the councellor baron Andreas v. Königfel's estate Blankenfeld.[http://www.pilis.lv/a_pnm/view.php?id=1943] By this time, the conquests and success of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], who had established himself as Emperor of the French, made any Bourbon restoration seem unlikely. 

Louis in fact corresponded with Napoleon during the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], offering to renounce the declaration he had made in [[Verona]], to pardon all regicides, to give titles and ennoblements to Bonaparte and his family, and even not to rescind any of the changes made since 1789. Napoleon's response was that the return of any Bourbon king to France would be accompanied by another civil war with at least another 100,000 dead bodies. With the army solidly behind him, Bonaparte likely could have restored the Bourbon monarchy while still being the power behind the throne. However, he preferred to rule in name as well as substance. As he put it, "I will not play the role of [[George Monck|Monck]], nor will I let anyone else play it. Nor will I be a second [[George Washington|Washington]]."

==Reign==

However, in 1814, following the defeat of Napoleon, Louis XVIII was finally able to secure the French throne, thanks to the support of the Allied Powers and, within France, Napoleon's old foreign minister [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand]]. Louis was forced by Talleyrand and the Napoleonic elites to grant a written constitution, the [[Charter of 1814]], which would guarantee a bicameral legislature. The Charter created a hereditary/appointive [[Chambre des pairs|Chamber of Peers]] and an elected [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]], although the franchise was extremely limited. Louis's regime also allowed much greater freedom of expression than the Napoleonic regime which had preceded it.

Louis's (largely symbolic) efforts to reverse the results of the [[French Revolution]] quickly made him unpopular. When Louis first became the actual king of France after the defeat of [[Napoleon]] in [[1814]], his [[favourite]], the staunchly royalist courtier [[Pierre Louis Jean Casimir de Blacas]], was appointed to the position of minister in charge of the royal household (''ministre de la [[Maison du Roi]]''). Blacas quickly assumed a dominant role in the new king's ''[[Conseil du Roi]]'', essentially becoming the first [[Prime Minister of France]]. But, unskilled, he made an assortment of errors, favoring members of the [[Ancien Régime]] too often. In addition, his cool and aloof behavior alienated many. 

On [[Napoleon]]'s return from [[Elba]], Blacas accompanied the new king on his flight to [[Ghent]]. Upon the king's return to Paris, however, after the [[Battle of Waterloo]] brought Napoleon's [[Hundred Days]] of renewed rule to an end, Blacas' unpopularity led to his dismissal. This did not, though, stop the atrocities of the [[The White Terror (France)|White Terror]], largely in the south, when supporters of the Bourbon monarchy murdered many who had supported Napoleon's return. Although the king and his ministers opposed the violence, they were ineffectual in taking active steps to stop it.

At the beginning of Louis' second restoration, his chief ministers were politically moderate, including Talleyrand, the [[Armand Emmanuel du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duc de Richelieu]], and [[Élie Decazes]]. Louis himself followed a more cautious, moderate policy, hoping that moderation would ensure the continuation of the dynasty.  The Chamber of Deputies elected in 1815, the notorious ''[[Chambre introuvable]]'' dominated by [[ultraroyalist]]s (or Ultras), was dissolved by Richelieu for being impossible to work with, and electoral [[gerrymander]]ing resulted in a more liberal chamber in 1816. However, the liberals ultimately proved just as unmanageable, and by 1820 Decazes and the King were looking to revise the electoral laws again to ensure a more conservative majority. However, the assassination in February 1820 of the [[Charles Ferdinand, duc de Berry|Duc de Berry]], the ultrareactionary son of Louis's equally ultrareactionary brother (and [[heir presumptive]]) the [[Charles X of France|Comte d'Artois]], led to Decazes's fall from power and the Triumph of the Ultras. After an interval in which Richelieu returned to power from 1820 to 1821, a new Ultra ministry was formed, headed by the [[Jean-Baptiste Guillaume Joseph, comte de Villele|Comte de Villèle]], a leading Ultra. Soon, however, Villèle proved himself to be nearly as cautious as his master, and, so long as Louis lived, overtly reactionary policies were kept to a minimum. 

Louis XVIII suffered from a severe case of [[gout]], which worsened with the years. At the end of his life, the King was [[wheelchair]]-bound most of the time.

Louis XVIII died on [[16 September]] [[1824]], and was interred in the [[Saint Denis Basilica]]. His brother, the Comte d'Artois, succeeded him as [[Charles X of France|Charles X]].  It was to be the only fully regular transfer of power in France from one head of state to another of the entire 19th century. (Charles X, [[Louis Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], and [[Napoleon III]] were ousted by revolution or military defeat, while the [[French Second Republic]] ended with a presidential [[coup d'état]]. No [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] [[President of France|President]] would serve out his whole term until [[Émile Loubet]] finished his term in 1906 and was succeeded by [[Armand Fallières]].)
