'''Tunbridge Wells''' is a [[Non-metropolitan district|local government district]] and [[borough]] in [[Kent]], [[England]]. It takes its name from its main town, [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]].

The district was formed on [[April 1]], [[1974]], by the merger of the [[municipal borough]] of Royal Tunbridge Wells along with [[Southborough, Kent|Southborough]] [[urban district]], [[Cranbrook Rural District]] and most of [[Tonbridge Rural District]].

==Description of borough==
===Location===
The borough of Tunbridge Wells lies along the south eastern border of Kent, partly on the northern edge of the [[Weald]], the remainder on the Weald [[Clay]] [[plain]] in the upper reaches of the rivers [[River Teise|Teise and]] [[River Beult|Beult]].

===The North Weald area===
The restricted area immediately to the north and west of Tunbridge Wells lies within the Weald. The presence of sandstone outcrops here, and the [[chalybeate]] springs, together with old workings, point to ancient [[Wealden iron industry|iron manufacturing]].

===Weald Clay plain===
This plain is part of the so-called ''Garden of England'', named for its extensive orchards and former [[hop (plant)|hop]] farms, sheep and cattle. A string of villages lies across this plain, from Brenchley and Horsmonden to Benenden and Headcorn.

===Communications===
* ''Roads'' The main roads through the borough are the A21 London to Hastings road and in the east, the A229, which runs from the A21 at Hurst Green through [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook]] to [[Maidstone]].
* ''Railways'' The line of the former [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] (SER) main line crosses the clay plain in an almost unbroken straight line between [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] and [[Ashford, Kent]]. The SER line to [[Hastings]] passes through Tunbridge Wells; here there was once a further branch connection south-eastwards to [[Groombridge]], and at Paddock Wood is the southern terminus of the [[Medway Valley Line]] to [[Maidstone]].

==Borough organisation==
Tunbridge Wells Borough Council is composed of 48 councillors repesenting 20 [[ward (politics)|ward]]s across the borough. Eight wards are within Royal Tunbridge Wells itself including Broadwater, Culverden; [[Pantiles]] & St Marks; [[Park (Tunbridge Wells)|Park]]; [[Rusthall]]; Sherwood & St John's and St. James. The remainder are [[rural]] wards covering the other main towns and villages.

Each of the latter also have their own form of local government in the form of a [[civil parish]]. They are as follows, paired where two villages are served by one councillor:
*[[Benenden]] & [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook]]
*[[Brenchley]] & [[Horsmonden]]
*[[Capel, Kent|Capel]]
*[[Frittenden]], [[Bidborough]]  & [[Sissinghurst]]
*[[Goudhurst]] & [[Lamberhurst]]
*[[Hawkhurst]] & [[Sandhurst, Kent|Sandhurst]]
*[[Paddock Wood]]: two wards, East and West
*[[Pembury]]
*[[Southborough, Kent|Southborough]]: two wards, Southborough & High Brooms; and Southborough North
*[[Speldhurst]] & [[Bidborough]]

===Politics===
Tunbridge Wells is and has almost always been from inception, a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Westminster constituency. However, some of the council wards are strongly [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]]. The present political composition of the Council is:

* Conservatives 41 
* Liberal Democrats 7

==Places of interest==
Apart from Tunbridge Wells itself, places of interest in the Borough include:
* [[Bewl Water]] reservoir near Lamberhurst for leisure water pursuits and outdoor conferences
* [[Sissinghurst Castle]] gardens: the home of [[Vita Sackville-West]]

- and there are facilities for rock-climbing at the 'High Rocks', 2 miles west of Tunbridge Wells
