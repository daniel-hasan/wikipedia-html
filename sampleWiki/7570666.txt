'''''Haystacks''''' is the title of a series of [[impressionism|impressionist]] [[painting]]s by [[Claude Monet]]. The primary subjects of all of the paintings in the series are stacks of [[hay|grain]] that have been stacked in the field after the harvest season. The title refers primarily to a twenty-five [[Canvas#Canvas for painting|canvas]] series ([[Wildenstein Index Number]] 1266-1290) begun the fall of 1890 and continued through the following spring, using that year's grain [[harvest]]. Some use a broader definition of the title to refer to other paintings by Monet with this same theme.  The series is known for its [[Theme (arts)|thematic]] use of repetition to show differences in [[perception]] of [[light]] across various times of day, [[seasons]], and types of [[weather]]. The subjects were painted in fields near Monet's home in [[Giverny]], [[France]].

The series is among Monet's most notable works. Although the largest collections of Monet's work are held in [[Paris]] at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] and [[Musée Marmottan Monet]], [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]], [[New York City]] at the [[Metropolitan Museum]] and [[Museum of Modern Art]] and [[Tokyo]] at the [[National Museum of Western Art]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artofmonet.com/Galleries/Where_Held_Opening_Page.htm|accessdate=2007-10-09|title=Country-by-Country List of Museums Holding Originals (Monet)|publisher=artofmonet.com}}</ref> six of the twenty-five haystacks pieces are currently housed at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in [[Chicago, IL|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/eurptg/citi/object?id=81545&collcatid=10|accessdate=2007-07-03|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|title=Claude Monet French, 1840-1926 (Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect))|date=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/eurptg/citi/object?id=14624&collcatid=10|accessdate=2007-07-03|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|title=Claude Monet French, 1840-1926 (Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn))|date=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/eurptg/citi/object?id=16560&collcatid=10|accessdate=2007-07-03|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|title=Claude Monet French, 1840-1926 (Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day))|date=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/eurptg/citi/object?id=111318&collcatid=10|accessdate=2007-07-03|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|title=Claude Monet French, 1840-1926 (Stack of Wheat)|date=2007}}</ref> The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, [[United States]] holds two,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&id=34078&coll_keywords=Monet&coll_accession=&coll_name=&coll_artist=&coll_place=&coll_medium=&coll_culture=&coll_classification=&coll_credit=&coll_provenance=&coll_location=&coll_has_images=&coll_on_view=&coll_sort=0&coll_sort_order=0&coll_view=0&coll_package=0&coll_start=41|title=Collection Search Results: Grainstack (Snow Effect)|accessdate=2007-07-03|date=2007|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&id=32189&coll_keywords=Monet&coll_accession=&coll_name=&coll_artist=&coll_place=&coll_medium=&coll_culture=&coll_classification=&coll_credit=&coll_provenance=&coll_location=&coll_has_images=&coll_on_view=&coll_sort=0&coll_sort_order=0&coll_view=0&coll_package=0&coll_start=21|title=Collection Search Results: Grainstack (Sunset)|accessdate=2007-07-03|date=2007|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston}}</ref> and [[The Louvre]] in [[Paris, France|Paris]], [[France]] holds one.

==Monet background==
{{mainarticle|Claude Monet}}
Monet settled in [[Giverny]] in 1883. Most of his paintings from 1883 until his death 40 years later were of scenes within {{km to mi|3}} of his home. Indeed, the grainstacks themselves were situated just outside his door.<ref>Tucker, p.87.</ref> He was intensely aware of and fascinated by the visual nuances of the region’s landscape and the variation in the seasons. 

Monet had already painted the same subject in different moods. However, as he matured as a painter, his depictions of [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] influences were increasingly concerned not only with specific effects, but with overall color harmonies that allowed for an autonomous use of rich color.<ref>House, page 127.</ref> The conventional wisdom was that the compact, solid haystacks were both a simple subject and an unimaginative one. However, contemporary writers and friends of the artist noted that Monet's subject matter was always carefully chosen, the product of careful thought and analysis.<ref>Tucker, p.33.</ref> Monet undertook a study of capturing their vibrance under direct light, and juxtaposing the same subject from the same view in more muted atmospheric conditions. It was not unusual for Monet to alter the canvases back in his studio, in search of harmonious transitions within the series.<ref>Tucker, p.79.</ref>

==Series background==
The stacks depicted herein are variously referred to as haystacks and grainstacks.<ref>Gerdts, p.17.</ref> The {{ft to m|15|20|convtype=range|abbr=yes|wiki=yes}} stacks emblematized the [[Normandy]] region of France by emphasizing the beauty and prosperity of the countryside. The grainstacks functioned as storage facilities that preserved the wheat until stalk and chaff could be more efficiently separated.<ref name=MiN143>Lemonedes, p. 143.</ref> The [[Normans|Norman]] method of storing grain was to use hay as a cover to shield ears of grain from the elements until they could be threshed. The threshing machines traveled from village to village. Thus, although the grain was harvested in July it often took until March for all the farms to be reached. These stacks became common in the mid 19th century. This method survived for 100 years, until the inception of [[combine harvesters]]. Although shapes of stacks were regional, it was common for them to be round in the [[Paris Basin (geology)|Paris basin]] and the region of Normandy in which Giverny is situated. 

Monet noticed this subject on a casual walk. He requested that his stepdaughter Blanche Hoschedé bring him two canvases. He believed that one canvas for overcast weather and one for sunny weather would be sufficient.<ref>Kelder, p.183.</ref> However, he realized he could not demonstrate the several distinct impressions on one or two canvases. As a result, his willing helper was quickly carting as many canvases as a [[wheelbarrow]] could hold.<ref>The veracity of this story has been doubted: '"When I began I was like the others; I believed that two canvases would suffice, one for gray weather and one for sun! At the time I was painting some stacks....One day I saw that my light had changed. I said to my stepdaughter: 'Go to the house, if you don't mind, and bring me another canvas!'" And so Monet worked on the story: another canvas! Another! The fact is that ever since he had started to paint he had had the habit of working from the same ''motif'' under different conditions....And yet there is something new here, a difference of emphasis.' Forge and Gordon, p. 158.</ref> His daily routine involved carting [[paint]]s, [[easel]]s, and many unfinished canvases and working on whichever canvas most closely resembled the scene of the moment as conditions fluctuated. Although he began painting realistic depictions ''[[en plein air]]'', he eventually revised initial effects in a studio to both generate contrast and preserve the harmony within the series.<ref name=MIN139>Lemonedes, p. 139.</ref>

Monet produced numerous Haystack paintings. His earlier [[Landscape art|landscapes]] (Wildenstein Index Number 900-995, 1073) had included haystacks in an ancillary manner. Monet had also produced five paintings (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1213-1217) with haystacks as the primary subject during the 1888 harvest.<ref>Tucker, p.31.</ref> The general consensus is that only the canvases produced using the 1890 harvest (Wildenstein Index Number 1266-1290) comprise the haystacks series proper. However, some include several additional paintings when referencing this series. For example, [[Hill-Stead Museum]] discusses their two serial haystack or grainstack paintings even though one is from the 1890 harvest and the other is from the 1888 harvest.<ref name=HSM/>

This series is one of Monet's earliest that relied on thematic repetition to illustrate nuances in perception across natural variation such as times of day, seasons, and types of weather.  For Monet, the concept of producing and exhibiting a series of paintings related by subject and vantage point began in 1889, with at least ten paintings done at the ''Valley of the Creuse'', and subsequently shown at the [[Art gallery|Galerie]] [[Georges Petit]].<ref>Tucker, p.41.</ref> This interest in the serial [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] would continue for the rest of his career.

==Thematic issues==
Although the mundane subject was constant throughout this series, the underlying theme may be seen as the transience of light. This concept enabled him to use repetition to show nuances of perception as seasons, time of day, and weather changes. The constant subject provided the basis from which comparisons could be made in changes of light across this nuanced series.<ref>So as to return to a painting at the correct moment, "on occasion Monet took the precaution of writing the time of day on the back of his canvases". House, p.143.</ref> The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October of 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.<ref name=MIN139/>

Beginning in the 1880s and 1890s, Monet focused on ''Haystacks'' and a number of other subjects (other series included the ''Mornings on the [[Seine]],'' ''[[Poplar]]s'', ''[[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]],'' the ''[[London Parliament (Monet)|Houses of Parliament]],'' and the ''[[Water Lilies]],'' among others). In order to work on many paintings virtually simultaneously, he would awake before [[dawn]] so as to begin at the earliest time of day:

{{cquote|...for the Early Mornings on the Seine series, he chose to paint at and before dawn, which made it 'an easier subject and simpler lighting than usual', because at this time of day the effects did not change so rapidly; however, this involved him getting up at 3:30 a.m., which seems to have been unprecedented even for so inveterate an early riser as Monet." <ref>House, p.143</ref>}}

As the morning progressed and the light changed he would switch to sequentially later canvas settings, sometimes working on as many as ten or twelve paintings a day, each one depicting a slightly different aspect of light.<ref>In a letter to Alice Monet dated [[March 29]], [[1893]], Monet wrote of having worked on fourteen paintings in one day at Rouen. House, p.144.</ref> The process would be repeated over the course of days, weeks, or months, depending on the weather and the progress of the paintings, until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed. 

Certain effects of light only last for a few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera received attention for no more than a few minutes a day.<ref>"In 1883 Jules Laforgue had spoken of a quarter hour as the natural time span for an Impressionist painting, while Monet himself mentioned seven minutes as the limit for one of his Poplar series...and in 1918 talked of effects which lasted 'sometimes three or four minutes at the most'". House, p.142.</ref> Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent [[sunrise]]s, for example, could alter substantially, and would require separate canvases within the series.<ref>"The constantly varying weather, rather than any idea of a final pictorial ensemble, remained his initial reason for endlessly multiplying his canvases." House, page 204. </ref> Subsequently, different [[hue]]s are evident in each painting, and in each work [[color]] is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons haystacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color [[spectrum]]. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the haystacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.<ref>"In ''Grain Stack at Sunset'' intense brick reds give the shadowed side of the stack an incandescent core, while the light of the sunset haloes the stack with vermilion and yellow, and scatters the lit parts of the field with particles of pink, orange, and mauve." House, page 128.</ref>

Many notable painters have been influenced by this particular series including [[Les Fauves]], [[Derain]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck|Vlaminck]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.impressionist-art-gallery.com/monet_haystacks.html|accessdate=2007-10-01|date=2006|publisher=Impressionist Art Gallery|title=Monet Haystacks}}</ref> [[Kandinsky]]'s memoirs refer to the series: “What suddenly became clear to me was the unsuspected power of the palette, which I had not understood before and which surpassed my wildest dreams.”<ref>Excerpts from Kandinsky's memoirs, page 53. [http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5v19n9xh&doc.view=content&chunk.id=d0e2244&toc.depth=1&anchor.id=0&brand=eschol] Retrieved May 30, 2007.</ref> [[Image:1274 Grainstacks Snow Effect, Meules, effet de neige, 1890-91, 60 x 100cm, Oil on Canvas, Hill-Stead Museum, Farmington, CT.JPG|thumb|right|240px|''Grainstacks, Snow Effect'', 1890-91, [[Shelburne Museum]], Shelburne, VT.]]
The ''Haystacks'' series was a financial success.<ref>Tucker, p.77.</ref> Fifteen of these were exhibited by [[Durand-Ruel]] in May 1891, and every painting sold within days.<ref>Tucker, p.77.</ref> The exhibit met with great public acclaim. [[Octave Mirbeau]] described Monet's daring series as representing "what lies beyond progress itself." Others described the grainstacks as "faces of the landscape," and viewers seemed to take assurance that the series would help preserve rural traditions despite [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]].<ref name=MiN143/> They represented the [[countryside]] as a retreat from daily problems and home for contentment with nature. [[Camille Pissarro]] said "These canvases breathe contentment."<ref name=MiN143/> Most of the paintings sold immediately for as much as 1,000 [[franc]]s.<ref>"...before the show even opened, Durand-Ruel purchased eight of the fifteen ''Grainstacks'' that the artist would exhibit. In the meantime, Monet had been able to sell two others that he would include in the exhibition...That meant that of the fifteen stacks that went on view in May 1891, ten were already spoken for, leaving only five for anyone who might have been interested." Tucker, p.98.</ref> Additionally, Monet’s prices in general began to rise steeply. As a result, he was able to buy outright the house and grounds at [[Giverny]] and to start constructing a [[waterlily]] [[pond]]. After years of mere subsistence living he was able to enjoy success. 

The series demonstrates his intense study of light and atmospheric conditions and Monet was a perfectionist in his renderings. Monet destroyed more than one series of paintings that he found wanting.<ref>"Many accounts speak of Monet destroying incomplete abortive paintings; with the London series and the Water Lilies of 1903-1909 the destructions seem to have been very extensive. In 1907, when deferring his exhibition of Water Lilies, he told Durand-Ruel that he had destroyed 'at least thirty of them, to my great satisfaction'." House, page 159.</ref> However, this series escaped his own harsh self-criticism and destruction.

From the 1888 harvest he produced three canvases featuring two stacks each (Wildenstein #'s 1213-5) against the backdrop of hills along the left bank of the [[Seine]] and a few [[Giverny]] houses to the right. Then, he turned to his left to capture two scenes (1216-7) in which the hills are shrouded by a line of poplars.<ref>Forge, Andrew, and Gordon, Robert, ''Monet'', Harry N.
