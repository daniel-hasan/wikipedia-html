Ralphie is erroneously called a "[[buffalo]]" (along with the team), Ralphie is actually an [[American Bison]].

Handlers, known as "Ralphie Runners," run Ralphie around [[Folsom Field]], the University of Colorado's [[college football|football]] field, in a loop before each half of each home game. Ralphie can reach speeds of 25&nbsp;[[miles per hour]] (40 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]). Female bison are used because they are smaller and less aggressive, as well as for [[insurance]] reasons,<ref name="Iowa">{{cite web | url=http://media.www.iowastatedaily.com/media/storage/paper818/news/2002/11/22/Sports/Colorados.Mascot.Handlers.Get.Workout.With.Ralphie-1093201.shtml?sourcedomain=www.iowastatedaily.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com | title=Colorado's mascot handlers get workout with Ralphie | date= [[2002-11-22]] | accessdate=2007-01-24 | author=Zac Reicks | publisher=Iowa State Daily}}</ref> although Ralphie has knocked over her handlers on more than one occasion.

==History==
The tradition began in [[1934]], three weeks after the selection of ''Buffaloes'' as a nickname for the University in a contest by the school newspaper, the ''Silver & Gold''. A group of students paid [[United States dollar|$]]25 to rent a bison [[calf]] and a [[cowboy]] as his keeper for the last game of the 1934 season. The calf was the son of Killer, a famed bison at Trails End Ranch in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. It took the cowboy and four students to keep the calf under control on the sidelines during a 7-0 win at the [[University of Denver]] on [[Thanksgiving Day]].<ref name="PreRalphie">{{cite web|url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=4460&SPID=274&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=24640 | title=Pre-Ralphie | publisher=CUBuffs.com | date= [[2003-08-23]] | accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>

Live bison continued to make sporadic appearances at CU games, usually in a pen on the field or sometimes driven around in a cage. In the 1940s, the school kept a baby bison in a special pen at the University Riding Academy.<ref name="PreRalphie" /> The first named bison was "Mr. Chips," who appeared for the first time at the 1957 CU Days kickoff rally; Mahlon White donated him to the school, and it was cared for by a men's honorary.<ref name="PreRalphie" />

===Ralphie I===
[[Image:Colorado Ralphie I.jpg|thumb|right|Ralphie I served 1966-78]]<!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale -->
Ralphie I ([[1966]]-[[1978]]) was donated to the school in 1966 by John Lowery, the father of a CU freshman from [[Lubbock, Texas]], when she was 6 months old. Initially, she was given the name "Ralph,"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=4460&SPID=274&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=24641 |title=Ralphie I | date= [[2003-08-23]] | accessdate=2007-01-24 | publisher=CUBuffs.com}}</ref> because of the noise she made while running; but after a sharp-eyed fan pointed out that the bison was a female, the name was changed to Ralphie.

The first handlers were the five officers of the sophomore class who ran the bison around the stadium in a loop. They would pick the bison up before the games from her caretaker William "Bud" Hays at the Green Mountain Riding Stables and run her around for a few hours to tire her out to make her easier to manage and run with. At the conclusion of the game, fans would start the "Buffalo Stomp" which would cause the stadium to shake and create a loud thundering noise. However, CU officials had to stop the Buffalo Stomp tradition due to damages it was causing to the stadium.

The tradition of running Ralphie around in a loop on the field started [[October 28]], [[1967 in sports|1967]] during CU's homecoming game against the [[Oklahoma State Cowboys]] which CU lost 10-7. Head coach [[Eddie Crowder]] had given permission, and thought it was a great idea having the team follow Ralphie out on to the field. Also, personnel that had experience working with animals took over for the five sophomore officers. The five sophomores then appointed themselves as the board of directors of fundraising and raised enough money by selling stock to take Ralphie to the 1967 [[Bluebonnet Bowl]].

Ralphie attended all football home games and bowl games until her retirement in 1978, a 13-year career. She achieved national celebrity status and was kidnapped in 1970 by [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] cadets. She was also voted the [[homecoming queen]] in 1971.<ref name="Spice">{{cite web | url=http://www.getboulder.com/sports/football/buffs_ralphie.html | title=Sugar and Spice: CU's "Little Girl" | author=Mary Jarrett | publisher=GetBoulder.com | date=2005 | accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>

===Ralphie II===
[[Image:Colorado Ralphie II.jpg|thumb|left|Ralphie II served 1978-87]]<!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale -->
Ralphie II ([[1975]] - [[September 19]] [[1987]]), originally named "Moon" (short for [[Moonshine]]), made her debut on [[November 18]], [[1978 in sports|1978]], the final home game of the season and last game for head coach [[Bill Mallory]] for CU, a 20-16 loss to the [[Iowa State Cyclones]].<ref name="R2">{{cite web| url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=4460&SPID=274&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=24642 | title=Ralphie II | publisher=CUBuffs.com | date= [[2003-08-23]] | accessdate=2007-01-24 | language=English |format=HTML}}</ref> Her named was changed to Ralphie II because the name had become so popular.<ref name="R2" /> The Bank of Boulder, which was a significant supporter of the first Ralphie, bought and donated Ralphie II  to CU.<ref name="R2" /> Ralphie II suddenly and unexpectedly died on September 19, [[1987 NCAA Division I-A football season|1987]], following a 31-17 win over the [[Stanford Cardinal]].<ref name="R2" /> She was expected to retire at the end of the 1987 season and was kept at the Parker Ranch.<ref name="state" />

===Ralphie III===
[[Image:Colorado Ralphie III.gif|thumb|right|Ralphie III served 1987–97]]<!-- Fair use image, see image description page for fair use rationale -->
Ralphie III (died early [[1998]]) was pressed into service with only five weeks of training due to the sudden and unexpected death of Ralphie II. She was being trained to replace Ralphie II, who was due to retire at the end of the 1987 season.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=4460&SPID=274&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=24643 | title=Ralphie III | publisher=CUBuffs.com | date= [[2003-08-23]] | accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> Ralphie III made her first appearance on [[November 7]], [[1987 NCAA Division I-A football season|1987]] in a 27-10 win against the [[Missouri Tigers]]. John and Shaaron Parker donated the orphan who was also kept at the Parker Ranch.

At the 1993 [[Fiesta Bowl]], four of the five students running with Ralphie III slipped and fell on the slick field. Only the student in front was left. Ralphie was loose for a period of time.<ref name="Gazette" />

After Ralphie's death, the [[Colorado General Assembly|Colorado State Senate]] passed State Resolution 98–10 by Senator [[Elsie Lacy]] — Concerning a tribute to Ralphie III the University of Colorado bison mascot, stating:
{{quote|WHEREAS, Ralphie III, the University of Colorado bison who for 12 years rumbled across Folsom Field to the cheers of thousands, has died; and<br />
WHEREAS, Because of her advanced age, 13 ­year ­old Ralphie III was scheduled to retire after the upcoming football season, but instead the half-­ton bison died of natural causes recently at her home in [[Hudson, Colorado]]; and<br />
WHEREAS, Ralphie III led the CU Buffaloes football team onto the field in 73 games at the start of both halves, including 62 times at Folsom Field in Boulder, 8 bowl games at locations throughout the country, and 3 games in [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]]; and<br />
WHEREAS, Ralphie III traveled to [[Anaheim, California]] in 1990 for the Pigskin Classic, but [[Anaheim Stadium]] authorities would not let her run on the field, the only disappointing experience in her otherwise illustrious career; and<br />
WHEREAS, While Ralphie III will be sadly missed, the legacy of the running of the bison will be carried on with the donation of Ralphie IV; now, therefore,<br />
Be It Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-­first General Assembly of the State of Colorado:<br />
That the University of Colorado and fans alike have lost a most beloved mascot and are saddened by the occasion of Ralphie III's death.<br />
Be It Further Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the University of Colorado's athletic department, President John Buechner, each member of the board of Regents of the University of Colorado, John Parker, the ranch owner who cared for Ralphie III, and the 14 University of Colorado students who are the bison handlers.|CO SR 98-10<ref name="state">{{cite web | url=http://www.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/sess1998/sjouap16.htm | title=SENATE JOURNAL, Sixty-first General Assembly, STATE OF COLORADO, Second Regular Session | date=100th Legislative Day, Thursday, [[April 16]] [[1998]] | accessdate=2007-01-24 | publisher=State of Colorado}}</ref>}}

===Ralphie IV===

Ralphie IV (born April [[1997]]), the current Ralphie, was born at [[Ted Turner]]'s Flying D Ranch in [[Gallatin Gateway, Montana]] and donated to the University in response to an article in ''Bison World'' magazine.<ref name="Info1998">{{cite web | url=http://web.dailycamera.com/buffzone/aboutcu/ralphie.html | title=All about Ralphie | publisher=DailyCamera.com | date=1998 | accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> She was originally named "Rowdy" by [[ranch hand]]s.<ref name="R4">{{cite web | url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=4460&SPID=274&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=24644 | publisher=CUBuffs.com | title=Ralphie IV | date= [[2003-08-23]] | accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> She was separated from her mother and, at only one month old, was found in the jaws of a [[coyote]] with bite marks around her neck.<ref name="Info1998" /> She was bottle-fed for four months while recovering and then released back into the herd, but she would not bond with them.<ref name="R4" /> Ranch hands took her back and fed her grass and grains before they decided to donate her to CU. John Parker, who trained and housed both Ralphie II and III, brought her back to [[Colorado]] from Montana and supervised all of her early training.<ref name="R4" /> Parker retired as Ralphie's caretaker in May 2000. Long-time CU supporters Dale and Lynn Johnson housed Ralphie for the following year, with Parker's assistant, Ted Davis, assuming the program duties for the 2000 season.<ref name="R4" /> In the summer of 2001, two former Ralphie Handlers and CU graduates, Ben Frei and Kevin Priola, took over the program. Together they coordinate the selection and managing of up to 12 student handlers as well as all aspects of training.<ref name="R4" />

Ralphie IV, fully grown and mature, weighs in at about 1,300&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|pounds]] (590&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]]), over three times her weight when she made her debut against the [[Colorado State Rams]] at [[Mile High Stadium]] in [[Denver, Colorado]] on [[September 5]], [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998]].  Her home is now in nearby [[Henderson, Colorado]]. Her exact location remains a secret because of previous attempts by rival schools to kidnap Ralphie, or otherwise render her unable to run.<ref name="Gazette" />

Ralphie IV has only refused to run twice.<ref name="Spice" /> She got spooked [[November 21]], [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season|2003]] as she charged out of her pen for her routine run across Folsom Field to mark the start of the game versus CU's nemesis, the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers]]. Instead of mightily rumbling over the turf, she halted at the 20-yard line, dug her hoofs into the grassy field and refused to budge.<ref>{{cite news | title=BAD DAY FOR BUFFALOES Ralphie's runs stops short | author=Christine Reid | publisher=Boulder Daily Camera | date=[[November 23]] [[2003]]}}</ref> CU lost the game 22–31. She also refused to even leave the gates on [[November 26]], [[1999 NCAA Division I-A football season|1999]], also against Nebraska in another loss, 33-30 in overtime.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/1999/11/29/Sports/Cus-Comeback.A.small.Victory.Against.Huskers-1735425.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailynebraskan.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com | title=CU's comeback a 'small victory' against Huskers | author=Adam Klinker | publisher=Daily Nebraskan | date= [[1999-11-29]] | accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref> 
A [[Kansas State Wildcats]] player was once run over by Ralphie.<ref name="Gazette" /> She also has provided the team's only serious accident in 2000 when she tossed Meghan McCarthy "like a bale of hay," leaving permanent scars from her horns.<ref name="Spice" />

Ralphie came into the national spotlight in November 2002 as Violet Stromberg, a 96-year-old lifelong CU football fan, left her life savings of $40,730 to create the Ralphie Fund which helps pay for Ralphie's hoof trimmings, transportation, harnesses, ropes, vet bills and $1,500 a year in oats, alfalfa and grass.<ref name="Iowa" />

Ralphie IV ran in her final regular-season football game during the Colorado 65-51 win over Nebraska on [[November 23]] [[2007]] and is expected to run for the final time before Colorado's appearance in the [[Independence Bowl]] on December 30, 2007  

She is partially retired and will fill the role of back-up to Ralphie V, sharing the less strenuous Ralphie duties for as long as her age and health allow. According to CU officials, Ralphie IV will be known as "Ralphie [[Emeritus]]" until her death.

===Ralphie V===
[[Image:RalphieV.jpg|thumb|right|Ralphie V at her public introduction on November 17, 2007. She was 13 months old and weighed 450 lbs.]]

Ralphie V was introduced to the public on [[November 17]] [[2007]] in a major public event called "Ralphie's Salute to a New Era." According to CU officials, Ralphie V will not take over all Ralphie duties immediately; both Ralphie IV and V will share duties as long as Ralphie IV remains healthy. Ralphie IV will retain duties that require a relatively sedate and experienced bison while Ralphie V will take over the most physically strenuous duties.<ref name="R5new">{{cite web | url=http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2007/nov/18/ready-to-rumble-fans-welcome-new-ralphie/ | title=Fans welcome new Ralphie | author=Alyssa Urish | date=[[2007-11-18]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 | publisher=Dailycamera.com}}</ref>

Like her predecessor, Ralphie V was donated to Colorado by Ted Turner.<ref name="R5new" /> She was born in October of 2006 at the Vermejo Park Ranch in northern [[New Mexico]] and was named "Blackout."<ref name="R5new" /> She began training at the age of two months to prepare her to take the field. When she was introduced at the "Ralphie's Salute to a New Era" event she weighed in at 500 &nbsp;[[pound (mass)|pounds]] (227&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]]).<ref name="R5new" />

Ralphie V runs faster than Ralphie IV and still somewhat wild, according to handlers,<ref name="R5new" /> and broke off the tip of one horn "playing with a tree" in her pasture. An alternate story regarding her shattered horn tip is that it was broken during a trip in her "Ralphie trailer" on the trip from New Mexico.<ref name="R5new" /> The horn will grow back, but there will always be scratch marks.<ref name="R5new" />

Ralphie V is not expected to take the field with the football team until the 2008 season, allowing Ralphie IV to complete her final season with the Buffaloes.

She rarely travels to away games ([[bowl game]]s excluded), and only when permitted by the rules of the host stadium. Ralphie IV traveled to the [[September 23]], [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006]] game against the [[Georgia Bulldogs]] along with an [[ESPN]] producer and cameraman who documented the trip and aired a special on that weekend's [[College GameDay (football)|College Gameday]].<ref name="game4">{{cite web | url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3843&SPID=255&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=610640 | title=2006 Colorado Football: Game 4 -- Georgia | author=David Plati | publisher=CUBuffs.com | accessdate=2006-09-22 | date= [[2006-09-19]]}}</ref> She also traveled to the 2005 [[Champs Sports Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/09/23/Sports/Watch_out__Uga___here.shtml | title=Watch out, Uga - here comes Ralphie | author=Wire services | date= [[2006-09-23]] | accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>

She wears a custom-made banner that reads "GO CU" on one side, and "Beat [the opposing team]" on the other side with the CU Logo, such as "Beat Cougars" or "Beat Longhorns".

Ralphie travels to games and appearances in a black custom stock trailer emblazoned with her name in gold. Ralphie and her trailer are pulled though the University Hill neighborhood before games on her way to the stadium.

When Ralphie leads the football team on to the field she often receives bigger cheers than the team, even when the team is doing well.
