'''Cindy Lee Miller Sheehan''' (born [[July 10]] [[1957]]) is an [[United States|American]] anti-war [[activist]], whose son, [[Casey Sheehan]], was killed during his service in the [[Iraq War]] on [[April 4]], [[2004]]. She attracted international attention in August 2005 for her extended [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] at a camp outside [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Prairie Chapel Ranch|Texas ranch]] garnering her both [[Support and criticism of Cindy Sheehan|support and criticism]].  In May 2007, Sheehan officially ended her involvement as an [[anti-war]] activist, saying "I am going to go home and be a mother to my surviving children and try to regain some of what I have lost."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/05/28/sheehan/ |title=Anti-war mom Cindy Sheehan gives up her protest - CNN.com |accessdate=2007-05-29 |format= |work=}}</ref> On [[July 8]] [[2007]], in the wake of President Bush's reduction of the sentence of [[Scooter Libby]], Sheehan announced that she plans to challenge [[Speaker Pelosi|Speaker Nancy Pelosi]] should Pelosi fail to introduce articles of impeachment against President Bush.

Sheehan and other military families met with [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] in June 2004 at [[Fort Lewis]], near [[Tacoma, Washington]], nearly three months after her son's death. In a [[June 24]] [[2004]] interview with the Vacaville ''Reporter'' published soon after the meeting, she stated, "We haven't been happy with the way the war has been handled. The President has changed his reasons for being over there every time a reason is proven false or an objective reached." She also stated that President Bush was "... sincere about wanting freedom for the Iraqis… I know he's sorry and feels some pain for our loss. And I know he's a man of faith."<ref>{{cite web

Sheehan gave another interview on [[October 4]] [[2004]], stating that she did not understand the reasons for the Iraq invasion and never thought that [[Iraq]] posed an imminent threat to the United States. She further stated that her son's death had compelled her to speak out against the war. <ref name=buzzflash410 />

During the Presidential Inauguration in January 2005, Sheehan traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak at the opening of "[[Eyes Wide Open: the Human Cost of War]]", a traveling exhibition created by the [[American Friends Service Committee]] that displays pairs of combat boots to represent every U.S. military casualty. There she met others who lost family members in Iraq, and together they planned to create an organization for similar families. Sheehan wrote about the experience in a commentary article.<ref>{{cite web

Sheehan is one of the nine founding members of [[Gold Star Families for Peace]], an organization created in January 2005 that seeks to end the U.S. presence in Iraq and provide support for families of fallen soldiers. As of August 2005, at least 63 other relatives of fallen soldiers are listed as members.

Some of her statements have caused controversy.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} One such comment she wrote on her [http://www.dailykos.com/user/uid:55131 Daily Kos diary] on [[September 24]] [[2005]], accusing the media of excessive media coverage of [[Hurricane Rita]]: 

{{cquote|[I] am watching <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[CNN]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> and it is 100 percent [R]ita... even though it is a little wind and a little rain... it is bad, but there are other things going on in this country today... and in the world!!!!<ref>[http://www.dailykos.com/comments/2005/9/24/85619/4714/25?mode=alone;showrate=1#25 Daily Kos Comment]</ref>}}

In March 2005, James Morris sent an e-mail to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline]]'' allegedly written by Sheehan that included the statements that Casey Sheehan "was killed for lies and for a [[Project for the New American Century|PNAC]] [[Neoconservativism|Neo-Con]] agenda to benefit [[Israel]]" and that he had "joined the Army to protect America, not Israel." Sheehan denies the allegations: "I've never said that... Those aren't even words that I would say. I do believe that the [[Palestinian]] issue<ref>[http://representativepress.blogspot.com/2005/08/gorilla-in-room-is-us-support-for.html The Gorilla in the Room is US Support for Israel]</ref> is a hot issue that needs to be solved, and it needs to be more fair and equitable, but I never said my son died for Israel." She claims that Morris modified the email to support his own personal agenda. Morris denies altering the email before sending it along to ''Nightline''<ref>[http://representativepress.blogspot.com/2005/08/cindy-sheehan-mother-of-spc-casey.html Cindy Sheehan Sets the Record Straight or Not?]</ref> on Sheehan's behalf (per her request for him to do so). Two other individuals, Tony Tersch and Skeeter Gallagher, received a copy of Sheehan's email directly from her; both claim that the e-mail they received is consistent with Morris' story, rather than Sheehan's. Tersch posted the email<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/bullyard/msg/7f523b1a73be1a36?hl=en&utoken=xROkbSgAAACr8ZoLXYhUv5gIBvwd_n1ns_kPkDE5mUrjNCnnQke9M69donj_N_r1RbbHeSlh9aA Fw: Nightline Tonight Mon., March 14, 2005]</ref> he received to the "bullyard" Google group.  

Cindy Sheehan on [[May 12]] [[2006]] published a letter titled "Oh no, Canada".<ref>[http://www.michaelmoore.com/mustread/index.php?id=646 Oh No, Canada!]</ref> In the letter, she wrote that the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] was "wildly unpopular from coast to coast up north and there is a growing sense of unease about his emulation of a very unpopular person in the USA but even more in Canada: George Bush."  However, in March, SES Research released the results of a poll<ref>[http://www.sesresearch.com/library/polls/POLNAT-S07-T230.pdf PDF]</ref> indicating that more Canadians in every part of the country chose Harper as the one who would make the best Prime Minister from among the five major party leaders.

She has plans to build a therapy center across from President Bush's ranch for returning war victims. {{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==Crawford Peace House==
Sheehan was on the board of directors of the [[Crawford Peace House]], which came under scrutiny in March 2007 after failing to submit paperwork since May 2006 to retain their corporate charter. <ref>[http://www.kcentv.com/news/c-article.php?cid=1&nid=12520 Anti-war group in McLennan County loses it’s corporate status], NBC 6 News, KCEN-TV</ref>

==Chronology of activism==
===Camp Casey===
{{Main|Camp Casey, Crawford, Texas}} 
On [[August 6]] [[2005]], Sheehan created a makeshift camp in a ditch by the side of the road about three miles from George W. Bush's Prairie Chapel Ranch near Crawford, Texas and announced her intention to stay (sleeping in a pup tent at night) until she is granted a  face-to-face meeting with the President.<ref>[http://www.kcentv.com/news/c-article.php?cid=1&nid=7708 Mom of soldier killed in Iraq stages protest near Bush's ranch]</ref> Sheehan started her protest the day the President started a planned five-week vacation.
A few days later, the media began referring to Sheehan's camp as "[[Camp Casey, Crawford, Texas|Camp Casey]]."<ref>[http://www.khou.com/news/state/stories/khou050808_gj_outwornwelcome.54eae939.html Grieving mom may have worn out welcome outside Bush's ranch]</ref>

She spent the next four weeks in Crawford (except for 5 days spent in California to see her elderly mother, who had suffered a stroke.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=aRyVaRrITyEs&refer=us '''Link does not work''']</ref>) On some days as many as 1500 supporters visited Camp Casey<ref>[http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050813/APN/508130949&cachetime=3&template=dateline '''Link does not work''']</ref>, including members of Congress, as well as several notable actors, singers, and civil rights activists.

Gold Star Families for Peace, of which Sheehan is a founding member, released a TV commercial featuring Sheehan, broadcast on Crawford and [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] cable channels near Bush's ranch.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thenewswire/archive/2005/08/gold-star-families-for-pe_5552.html Gold Star Families For Peace Launches New Ad Supporting Cindy Sheehan...]</ref> The group conducted a walk to a police station just outside Bush's Crawford ranch and delivered a bundle of oversized letters written by them to First Lady [[Laura Bush]], appealing to her as a mother for support towards their movement.<ref>[http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=060000&biid=2005082014748 “Please Convince the President, First Lady Laura Bush”]</ref>

On [[August 16]], Sheehan moved her camp closer to the Bush ranch after being offered the use of a piece of land owned by a supporter, [[Fred Mattlage]], who also happens to be a third cousin of Larry Mattlage, a rancher who had fired a shotgun on his property near the demonstration site several days earlier.<ref>[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001014533 '''this link is not working''']</ref><ref>[http://www.kcentv.com/news/c-article.php?cid=1&nid=7774 Shots fired near Crawford protesters]</ref>

In late August, Sheehan stated that she would continue to campaign against the Iraq war even if granted a meeting with the President. She also announced the [[Bring Them Home Now Tour]], to depart on [[September 1]] and arrive in Washington, D.C., on September 24 for three days of demonstrations. On the third day, Sheehan and about 370 other anti-war activists were arrested for demonstrating on the White House sidewalk.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/26/AR2005092600143.html "White House Sidewalk Protest Leads to Arrest of About 370"], Washington Post, September 27, 2005</ref>

===September - December 2005===
{{Main|Bring Them Home Now Tour}}
[[Image:Cindy Sheehan.jpg|thumb|215px|Cindy Sheehan in 2005]]
In September, the Bring Them Home Now Tour was organized by [[Gold Star Families for Peace]], [[Iraq Veterans Against the War]], [[Military Families Speak Out]], and [[Veterans For Peace]]. It was a rolling anti-war protest against the Iraq War, beginning in [[Crawford, Texas]], traveling three routes across the country (with rallies along the way) and culminating in a rally in Washington, DC in September 2005. It was inspired by and featured Cindy Sheehan as a speaker at many rallies. 

Sheehan's activism continued into the winter of 2005/2006. She met with Senator [[John McCain]] and, after considering the meeting a disappointment, called him a "warmonger".<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0927az-sheehan-mccain27-ON.html '''this link is not working''']</ref> She later protested [[Hillary Clinton]]'s stance on the war, stating that Clinton must either speak out against the war or risk losing her job<ref>[http://www.muslimwakeup.com/main/archives/2005/10/cindy_sheehan_r.php Cindy Sheehan Rails at the Democrats], Muslim WakeUp!</ref><ref>[http://www.dissidentvoice.org/Oct05/Frank1003.htm Cindy Sheehan Rattles the Democrats]</ref>, and urged Governor [[Janet Napolitano]] to withdraw the Arizona National Guard from Iraq at a rally in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].<ref>[http://www.kpho.com/Global/story.asp?S=3928602&nav=23Ku '''this link is not working''']</ref><ref>[http://www.oregonlive.com/enter/index.ssf?/newsflash/regional/index.ssf%3f/base/news-12/1128372541192571.xml&storylist= OregonLive.com]</ref> After a short trip back home to California, Sheehan said on October 24 during a media interview<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0543,lombardiqa,69280,2.html Mother of All Protesters]</ref> that she planned to speak at the [[White House]] and then tie herself to the fence, promising to return to the fence as soon as possible if arrested.  She did not follow through on this statement.  

Around [[Thanksgiving]], Sheehan returned to Texas to protest Bush's vacation without bringing the soldiers home. Bush planned to stay in Crawford through [[November 28]] [[2005]].<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1345370 '''this link is not working''']</ref> In early December, Sheehan traveled to [[Chicago]] to attend the annual [[People's Weekly World]] banquet. The theme of the banquet was "Make 2006 a turning point year in the fight for peace and justice."<ref>[http://colorado.indymedia.org/newswire/display/12117/index.php '''this link is not working''']</ref>

===Europe and South America===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Sheehanchavez.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sheehan with Venezuela's President [[Hugo Chávez]]]] -->
Sheehan went to [[London]] in early December. She was interviewed by [[BBC Radio 4]]<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2005_49_fri_05.shtml?wkp On her son's death and meeting Mr Bush]</ref> and by ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/antiwar/story/0,,1663388,00.html 'I feel I'm carrying the world on my shoulders']</ref> On December 10, Sheehan addressed the [[International Peace Conference]], organized by the [[Stop the War Coalition]] and held at [[The Royal Horticultural Halls]]. Sheehan was received enthusiastically by the British anti-war movement.  Later in the evening, she attended the London Premiere of [[Peace Mom]], a play written by [[Dario Fo]] (Literature Nobel laureate) about her<ref>[http://www.dariofo.it/files/peace%20mom%20FoRame%20(English).pdf PDF]</ref>, in which the role of Sheehan was played by [[Frances de la Tour]]. On December 13, Sheehan traveled to [[Ireland]], where she met Irish Foreign Affairs minister [[Dermot Ahern]]. She voiced her objection to U.S. aircraft refueling at [[Shannon Airport]], stating, "Your Government, even though they didn't send troops to Iraq, are complicit in the crimes by allowing the planes to land and refuel".<ref>[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/story.jsp?story=672721 '''this link is not working''']</ref>

===2006 activism===

On [[January 31]], Sheehan wore a T-shirt reading "2,245 Dead. How many more?" to Bush's [[State of the Union]] address and was removed and arrested by Capitol Police.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/01/31/sheehan.arrest/index.html  Activist Sheehan arrested in House gallery]</ref> Additionally, Beverly Young, the wife of Representative [[Bill Young]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]., [[Florida|Fla]].), was told to leave because she was wearing a T-shirt that read "Support the Troops: Defending Our Freedom."  As a matter of policy, visitors to Congress are not allowed to wear shirts containing type of any kind.  Sheehan described the event:<ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0201-01.htm What Really Happened]</ref>
<blockquote>
{{cquote|I was never told that I couldn't wear that shirt into the Congress. I was never asked to take it off or zip my jacket back up. If I had been asked to do any of those things... I would have, and written about the suppression of my [[freedom of speech]] later. I was immediately, and roughly (I have the bruises and muscle spasms to prove it) hauled off and arrested for "unlawful conduct."
<p>
After I had my personal items inventoried and my fingers printed, a nice Sergeant came in and looked at my shirt and said, "2245, huh? I just got back from there."
<p>
I told him that my son died there. That's when the enormity of my loss hit me. I have lost my son. I have lost my [[First Amendment]] rights. I have lost the country that I love. Where did America go? I started crying in pain.}}
</blockquote>

[[Image:100B6611.JPG|thumb|left|Sheehan in Melbourne speaking in support of [[David Matthew Hicks|David Hicks]]]]
On March 7, Sheehan was arrested in [[New York]] "after blocking the door to the U.S. Mission to the [[U.N.]] offices" during a protest with Iraqi women against the war.<ref>[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/11706772/ Cindy Sheehan arrested during NYC protest]</ref>

Sheehan took part in the "United For Peace and Justice" March in New York to protest the war on [[2006-04-29]].

Sheehan has accused the United States of planning to attack [[Iran]] in an effort to halt that nation's development of [[nuclear weapon]]s.  In two articles on ''[[BuzzFlash]]'', she called the passage of the [[Iran Freedom and Support Act]] was merely a stepping stone to war, and called on Congress to reject similar measures in the future.<ref name="buzzflash1">Sheehan, Cindy.

[http://www.buzzflash.com/contributors/06/04/con06133.html ''Don't Attack Iran'']. April 11, 2006.</ref>

On [[Mother's Day]], Sheehan joined [[Susan Sarandon]] at a [[Code Pink]] organized protest in [[President's Park|Lafayette Park]], across the street from the White House. Sheehan told the crowd that Mother's Day without her son was "very emotional" for her.<ref>[http://baltimorechronicle.com/2006/051506Hughes.shtml Code Pink Challenges White House]</ref>
 
On [[May 26]], Sheehan spoke at a rally in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The rally was held in front of the offices of the Victorian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]], and it was in support of the release of [[David Matthew Hicks|David Hicks]].<ref>{{cite web

Several organizations are planning a [[hunger strike]] for July 4 <ref>[http://troopshomefast.org troopshomefast.org]</ref> in which Sheehan has stated she will participate, although she will not be fasting indefinitely as some others have pledged to do. "Some of us like [[Dick Gregory]] and Diane Wilson will be fasting until the troops come home from Iraq, and some, like me, will be fasting for a specified time. My fast will begin on 7/04 and end on the last day of Camp Casey: 09/02."<ref>[http://www.michaelmoore.com/mustread/print.php?id=669 MichaelMoore.com Must Read]</ref> Her fast was a [[Liquid diet#Full liquid diet|full liquid diet]].<ref>[http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/3794/1/198/ Troops Home Fast: Day 6 - Cindy Sheehan]</ref>

On [[July 5]], Sheehan appeared on [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'' to discuss the war and her upcoming hunger strike. On the show, she called Bush "the biggest terrorist in the world" and "worse than [[Osama Bin Laden]]," and conceded that she would rather live under Venezuela's Chávez than Bush.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13735484/ 'Hardball with Chris Matthews' for July 5]</ref>  Later that month, Sheehan purchased five acres of land in Crawford, Texas, near Bush's private residence. In a written statement, Sheehan wrote that she "decided to buy property in Crawford to use until George's resignation or [[impeachment]], which we all hope is soon for the sake of the world." She also stated that she "can't think of a better way to use Casey's insurance money than for peace", and that she is sure that Casey would have approved.<ref>[http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/07/27/D8J4FIGG0.html Cindy Sheehan Buys Property in Crawford]</ref> In an interview on ''[[The Stephanie Miller Show]]'', Sheehan said that once her need for the land is over, she intends to donate the land to Crawford for the purpose of converting it into The Casey Sheehan Memorial Peace Park.<ref>[http://www.stephaniemiller.com/bits/2006_0728_sheehan.mp3]</ref>

In September, Sheehan released her memoir, entitled ''Peace Mom: A Mother's Journey Through Heartache to Activism''. The book recounts her experience of losing her son, along with [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] of [[suicide]] and revenge against Bush, and her transformation into an anti-war activist. Also included in the book are criticisms several other politicians, including: Senator John McCain, whom she accuses of lying to the media about his private statements to her; [[John Kerry]], whom she says she regrets voting for; and Hillary Clinton, whom she calls a "powermonger."<ref>[http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2006/09/cindy-sheehan-confessions-of-a-dangerous-mom.php Cindy Sheehan: Confessions of a Dangerous Mom]</ref>

On [[December 10]], Sheehan participated in a pro-impeachment forum at [[Fordham University]] alongside [[Carolyn Ho]], mother of [[Ehren Watada]], the first commissioned Army officer to refuse to go to Iraq.<ref>[http://worldcantwait.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3511&Itemid=10 "If war crimes, legalized torture and crimes against humanity are not reason to impeach, what is?"]</ref>

On [[January 6]] [[2007]] she traveled to [[Cuba]] and called for the closure of the U.S. military prison in [[Guantánamo Bay (Cuba)|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16504209/ MSNBC]</ref> She also visited the [[Latin American School of Medicine (Cuba)|Latin American School of Medicine]] (ELAM) where she declared: "I am impressed by the school, the quality of the students. I have never seen anything like it in the world; it doesn’t matter what part of the world we come from, or the fact that our governments don’t get along, we have the same hearts and they are filled with love."<ref>[http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2007/enero07/mar9/02cindy.html gramma.cu]</ref>

In [[Springfield, Vermont]], on [[March 4]] [[2007]], Sheehan gave a speech at the Unitarian Universalist Church about impeaching Bush and ending the war. <ref>[http://www.spoxtalk.com/plugins/p13_download_manager/getfile.php?categoryid=8&p13_sectionid=1&p13_fileid=276&p13_versionid=286 Spoxtalk.com] recording of Sheehan's speech</ref>

Cindy Sheehan planned on visiting [[Purdue University]], on [[April 12]] [[2007]], to give a speech on President Bush and the war in Iraq. <ref>[http://www.purdueexponent.org/?module=article&story_id=5325 Purdue Exponent]</ref> This visit caused controversy locally and Purdue University enacted security measures not normally used around a guest speaker, such as banning signs or banners from the speech location. Some students let their opinion be known as Sheehan had a hard time speaking over the chorus of boos from those in attendance. At one point in her speech, she referred to the students heckling her as "warmongers."<ref>[http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070413/LOCAL/704130538 Indianapolis Star]</ref>

Cindy Sheehan was invited by the May 4th Task Force as part of a yearly event remembering the [[Kent State Shootings]].

===Sheehan officially ends activism===

{{cquote|I am going to take whatever I have left and go home. I am going to go home and be a mother to my surviving children and try to regain some of what I have lost. I will try to maintain and nurture some very positive relationships that I have found in the journey that I was forced into when Casey died and try to repair some of the ones that have fallen apart since I began this single-minded crusade to try and change a paradigm that is now, I am afraid, carved in immovable, unbendable and rigidly mendacious marble.

Camp Casey has served its purpose. It’s for sale. Anyone want to buy five beautiful acres in Crawford, Texas? I will consider any reasonable offer. I hear George Bush will be moving out soon, too... which makes the property even more valuable.

This is my resignation letter as the "face" of the American anti-war movement. This is not my [[Checkers speech|"Checkers" moment]], because I will never give up trying to help people in the world who are harmed by the empire of the good old US of A, but I am finished working in, or outside of this system. This system forcefully resists being helped and eats up the people who try to help it. I am getting out before it totally consumes me or anymore people that I love and the rest of my resources.

Good-bye America ... you are not the country that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice, I can’t make you be that country unless you want it.<ref>{{cite web

===9/11 conspiracy theories===
In an interview with [[Alex Jones (radio)|Alex Jones]], Sheehan supported the [[Jersey Girls]]' call for a new investigation into the Bush administration's response to 9/11, and said with regard to the [[controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center]] that "I'm not an expert and I haven't had time to research it, but it does to me look like a controlled demolition, from a very amateur eye."  Noting that some "high profile" people "think 9/11 was an inside job," Sheehan said that "there's just a lot of very questionable things."   <ref>[http://prisonplanet.com/audio/300507sheehan.mp3 Prison Planet interview (mp3), beginning at 9 minutes and 11 minutes in]</ref>
