<b><a href="/wiki/Minneapolis%2C_Minnesota" id="w">Minneapolis</a></b> is the largest <a href="/wiki/City" id="w">city</a> in the state of <a href="/wiki/Minnesota" id="w">Minnesota</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/County_seat" id="w">county seat</a> of <a href="/wiki/Hennepin_County%2C_Minnesota" id="w">Hennepin County</a>.  The origin and growth of the city was spurred by the proximity of <a href="/wiki/Fort_Snelling" id="w">Fort Snelling</a>, the first major United States military presence in the area, and by its location on <a href="/wiki/Saint_Anthony_Falls" id="w">Saint Anthony Falls</a>, which provided power for <a href="/wiki/Sawmill" id="w">sawmills</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gristmill" id="w">flour mills</a>.</p>
<p>Fort Snelling was established in 1819, at the confluence of the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_River" id="w">Minnesota</a> Rivers, and soldiers began using the falls for waterpower.  When land became available for settlement, two towns were founded on either side of the falls: Saint Anthony, on the east side, and Minneapolis, on the west side.  The two towns later merged into one city in 1872.  Early development focused on sawmills, but flour mills eventually became the dominant industry.  This industrial development fueled the development of railroads and banks, as well as the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/Minneapolis_Grain_Exchange" id="w">Minneapolis Grain Exchange</a>.  Through innovations in milling techniques, Minneapolis became a world-leading center of flour production, earning the name &#34;Mill City&#34;.  As the city grew, the culture developed through its churches, arts institutions, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Minnesota" id="w">University of Minnesota</a>, and a famous park system designed by <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Wirth" id="w">Theodore Wirth</a>. </p>
<p>Although the sawmills and the <a href="/wiki/Flour" id="w">flour</a> mills are long gone, Minneapolis remains a regional center in banking and industry.  The two largest milling companies, <a href="/wiki/General_Mills" id="w">General Mills</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Pillsbury_Company" id="w">Pillsbury Company</a>, now merged under the General Mills name, still remain prominent in the Twin Cities area.

He published a book in 1683 entitled <i>Description of Louisiana</i>, describing the area to interested Europeans.  As time went on, he developed a tendency to exaggerate.

<a href="/wiki/Fort_Snelling" id="w">Fort Snelling</a> was established in 1819 to extend United States jurisdiction over the area and to allay concerns about British fur traders in the area.  The soldiers initially camped at a site on the south side of the Minnesota River, but conditions were hard there and nearly a fifth of the soldiers died of <a href="/wiki/Scurvy" id="w">scurvy</a> in the winter of 1819&#8211;1820.<sup id="_ref-Risjord_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Risjord" title="">[3]</a></sup>  They later moved their camp to <a href="/wiki/Camp_Coldwater" id="w">Camp Coldwater</a> in May of 1820.

A settlement on the east bank of the Mississippi near St. Anthony Falls was envisioned in the 1830s by Joseph Plympton, who became commander of Fort Snelling in 1837.  He made a more accurate survey of the reservation lands and transmitted a map to the War Department delimiting about 34,000 acres (140 km²) within the reservation.  He cleverly drew the boundary line to exclude certain parts of the east bank that had been part of the 1805 cession to <a href="/wiki/Zebulon_Pike" id="w">Zebulon Pike</a>.  His plan was to stake a pre-emption claim at the falls.  However, <a href="/wiki/Franklin_Steele" id="w">Franklin Steele</a> also had plans to stake a claim.  On <a href="/wiki/July_15" id="w">July 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1838" id="w">1838</a>, word reached Fort Snelling that a treaty between the United States and the Dakota and Ojibwa had been ratified, ceding land between the <a href="/wiki/St._Croix_River_(Wisconsin-Minnesota)" id="w">St. Croix River</a> and the Mississippi Rivers.  Steele rushed off to the falls, built a shanty, and marked off boundary lines.  Plympton&#39;s party arrived the next morning, but they were too late to claim the most desirable land.  Plympton claimed some less desirable land near Steele&#39;s claim, as did other settlers such as <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Bottineau" id="w">Pierre Bottineau</a>, Joseph Rondo, Samuel Findley, and Baptiste Turpin.<sup id="_ref-Kane_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kane" title="">[6]</a></sup>  Steele went on to build a dam at the falls and built a sawmill that cut logs from the <a href="/wiki/Rum_River" id="w">Rum River</a> area.<sup id="_ref-Lass_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lass" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Dakota were hunters and gatherers and soon found themselves in debt to fur traders. Pressed by a whooping cough outbreak, loss of buffalo, deer and bear, and loss of forests to logging, in 1851 in the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Traverse_des_Sioux" id="w">Treaty of Traverse des Sioux</a>, the Mdewakanton sold the remaining land west of the river, allowing settlement in 1852.<sup id="_ref-MPL-History_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MPL-History" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Franklin Steele also had a clever plan to obtain land on the west side of the falls.  He suggested to his associated Colonel <a href="/wiki/John_H._Stevens" id="w">John H. Stevens</a> that he should bargain with the War Department to obtain some land.  Stevens agreed to operate a <a href="/wiki/Ferry" id="w">ferry</a> service across the Mississippi in exchange for a claim of {{convert}} just above the government mills.  The government approved this bargain, and Stevens built his house in the winter of 1849&#8211;1850.  The house was the first permanent dwelling on the west bank in the area that became Minneapolis.<sup id="_ref-Kane_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kane" title="">[6]</a></sup> A few years later, the amount of land controlled by the fort was reduced with an order from <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">U.S. President</a> <a href="/wiki/Millard_Fillmore" id="w">Millard Fillmore</a>, and rapid settlement followed.

<a id="Business_and_industry" name="Business_and_industry"></a><h2>Business and industry</h2>
<p>Most of the early industrial development in Minneapolis was tied to <a href="/wiki/St._Anthony_Falls" id="w">St. Anthony Falls</a> and the power it provided.  Between 1848 and 1887, Minneapolis led the nation in sawmilling.  In 1856, the mills produced 12 million <a href="/wiki/Board_feet" id="w">board feet</a> (28,000 m³) of lumber.  That total had risen to about 91,000,000 board feet (215,000 m³) in 1869, and 960,000,000 board feet (2,270,000 m³) in 1899.  During the peak of this activity, at least 13 sawmills were operating on the falls.  The sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that planed and smoothed the lumber; factories that built sashes, doors, and windows; and manufacturers of shingles and wooden buckets.<sup id="_ref-Pennefeather_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pennefeather" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Kane_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kane" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The flour milling industry, dating back to the Fort Snelling government mill, later eclipsed the lumber industry in the value of its finished product.  Flour production stood at 30,000 <a href="/wiki/Barrel" id="w">barrels</a> in 1860, rising to 256,100 barrels in 1869.  <a href="/wiki/Cadwallader_C._Washburn" id="w">Cadwallader C.

Other prominent industries at the falls included foundries, machine shops, and textile mills.<sup id="_ref-Kane_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kane" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>During this time, St. Anthony, on the east side, was separate from Minneapolis, on the west side.  As a result of inferior management of the water power, St. Anthony found its manufacturing district declining.   Some people and organizations started to talk about merging the two cities.  A citizens&#39; committee recommended merging the two cities in 1866, but a vote on this issue was rejected in 1867.  Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867.  The two cities found themselves competing with St. Paul, which had a larger population, the head of navigation of the Mississippi River, and more access to railroads. <sup id="_ref-Kane_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kane" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

The two cities were later pushed toward merger by a disaster that nearly wiped out the falls.  The geological formation of the area consisted of a hard, thin layer of <a href="/wiki/Limestone" id="w">limestone</a> overlaying a soft <a href="/wiki/Sandstone" id="w">sandstone</a> formation.  As the sandstone eroded away, large blocks of limestone would fall off.  The expansion of milling and industry at the falls accelerated the process of erosion.<sup id="_ref-Kane_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kane" title="">[6]</a></sup>  If the fragile limestone cap ever eroded away completely, the falls would turn into a rapids that would no longer provide water power.  This process came to a head on <a href="/wiki/October_4" id="w">October 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1869" id="w">1869</a>, when a tunnel under Hennepin Island and Nicollet Island collapsed and filled with water.  With the limestone cap breached, the tunnel quickly created a torrent of water that blasted Hennepin Island and threatened to destroy the falls.  The falls were shored up quickly, and over the next several years, the falls were repaired by building a wooden apron, sealing the tunnel, and building low dams above the falls to avoid exposing the limestone to the weather.  This work was assisted by the federal government, and was eventually completed in 1884.  The federal government spent $615,000 on this effort, while the two cities spent $334,500.<sup id="_ref-Pennefeather_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pennefeather" title="">[10]</a></sup> Possibly as a result of the bonding needed to rehabilitate the falls, the cities of St. Anthony and Minneapolis merged on <a href="/wiki/April_9" id="w">April 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/1872" id="w">1872</a>.  <sup id="_ref-Kane_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kane" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

The <i>St. Anthony Express</i> newspaper predicted in 1855 that, &#34;The time is not distant when Minnesota, with the superiority of her soil and seasons for wheat culture, and her unparalleled water power for manufacturing flour, will export largely of this article. ... our mills will turn out wheat, superior in quality and appearance to any now manufactured in the West.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Pennefeather_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pennefeather" title="">[10]</a></sup>  By 1876, eighteen flour mills had been built on the west side of the river below the falls.  The first mills used traditional technology of <a href="/wiki/Millstone" id="w">millstones</a> that would pulverize the grain and grind as much flour as possible in one pass.<sup id="_ref-Pennefeather_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pennefeather" title="">[10]</a></sup>  This system worked best for winter <a href="/wiki/Wheat" id="w">wheat</a>, which was sown in the fall and resumed its growth in the spring.  However, the harsh winter conditions of the <a href="/wiki/Upper_Midwest" id="w">upper Midwest</a> did not lend themselves to the production of winter wheat, since the deep frosts and lack of snow cover killed the crop.  Spring wheat, which could be sown in the spring and reaped in the summer, was a more dependable crop.  However, conventional milling techniques did not produce a desirable product, since the harder husks of spring wheat kernels fractured between the grindstones.  The <a href="/wiki/Gluten" id="w">gluten</a> and <a href="/wiki/Starch" id="w">starch</a> in the flour could not be mixed completely, either, and the flour would turn <a href="/wiki/Rancidification" id="w">rancid</a>.  Minneapolis milling companies solved this problem by inventing the <a href="/wiki/Middlings_purifier" id="w">middlings purifier</a>, which made it possible to separate the husks from the flour earlier in the milling process.  They also developed a gradual-reduction process, where grain was pulverized between a series of rollers made of porcelain, iron, or steel.  This process resulted in &#34;patent&#34; flour, which commanded almost double the price of &#34;bakers&#34; or &#34;clear&#34; flour, which it replaced.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The Washburn mill attempted to monopolize these techniques, but Pillsbury and other companies lured employees away from Washburn and were able to duplicate the process.<sup id="_ref-Danbom_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Danbom" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the flour industry grew steadily, one major event caused a disturbance in the production of flour.   On <a href="/wiki/May_2" id="w">May 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1878" id="w">1878</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Washburn_%26quot%3BA%26quot%3B_Mill" id="w">Washburn &#34;A&#34; Mill</a> exploded when grain dust ignited.  The explosion killed eighteen workers and destroyed one-third of the capacity of the <a href="/wiki/Mills_District%2C_Minneapolis" id="w">milling district</a>, as well as other nearby businesses and residences.  By the end of the year, though, seventeen mills were back in operation, including the rebuilt Washburn &#34;A&#34; Mill and others that had been completely rebuilt.  The millers also took the opportunity to rebuild with new technology such as dust collection systems.  The largest mill on the east side of the river was the <a href="/wiki/Pillsbury_%26quot%3BA%26quot%3B_Mill" id="w">Pillsbury &#34;A&#34; Mill</a>, built in 1880&#8211;1881 and designed by local architect <a href="/wiki/LeRoy_S._Buffington" id="w">LeRoy S.

The seven-story building had stone walls six feet thick at the base tapering to eighteen inches at the top.  With improvements and additions over the years, it became the world&#39;s largest flour mill.<sup id="_ref-Pennefeather_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pennefeather" title="">[10]</a></sup>  The Pillsbury &#34;A&#34; Mill is now a <a href="/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark" id="w">National Historic Landmark</a>, along with the Washburn &#34;A&#34; Mill.</p>
<p>In 1891, <a href="/wiki/Northwestern_Consolidated_Milling_Company" id="w">Northwestern Consolidated Milling Company</a> was formed, consolidating many of the smaller mills into one corporate entity.

<a id="Railroads" name="Railroads"></a><h3>Railroads</h3>
<p>The development of sawmills and flour mills at the falls spurred demand for railroad service to Minneapolis.  In 1868, Minneapolis was only served by a spur from St. Paul, from the <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Milwaukee%2C_St._Paul_and_Pacific_Railroad" id="w">Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad</a>, and by the fledgling St. Paul and Pacific Railroad.  Minneapolis millers found that railroads based in <a href="/wiki/Milwaukee" id="w">Milwaukee</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a> were favoring their cities by diverting wheat from Minneapolis mills.  In response, the owners of several Minneapolis mills chartered the <a href="/wiki/Minneapolis_and_St._Louis_Railway" id="w">Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway</a>, which would connect the <a href="/wiki/Lake_Superior_and_Mississippi_Railroad" id="w">Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad</a> through Minneapolis to the Iowa border.

<div class="thumbcaption">The Stone Arch Bridge</div><a href="/wiki/James_J._Hill" id="w">James J. Hill</a> eventually reorganized the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad as the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railroad, which later became the <a href="/wiki/Great_Northern_Railway_(U.S.)" id="w">Great Northern Railway</a>.  The Manitoba line had two lines leading to the <a href="/wiki/Red_River_Valley" id="w">Red River Valley</a>, giving it access to wheat-growing regions, and it served several mills in Minneapolis.<sup id="_ref-Hofsommer_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hofsommer" title="">[11]</a></sup> The Manitoba&#39;s small passenger station at Minneapolis had become inadequate, so Hill decided to build a new depot that he expected to share with other railroads.

The result was the <a href="/wiki/Stone_Arch_Bridge" id="w">Stone Arch Bridge</a>, completed in 1883.

The first park in Minneapolis was land donated to the city in 1857, but it took about 25 years for the community to take a major interest in its parks.

<p>In the first few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began to lose its dominant position in the flour milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915&#8211;1916.  The rise of steam power, and later electric power, eroded the advantage that St. Anthony Falls provided in water power.  The farmers of the southern plains developed harder wheat varieties that were better suited for bread flour, and the <a href="/wiki/Kansas_City_Metropolitan_Area" id="w">Kansas City area</a> gained prominence in milling.  Also, due to changes in rail shipping rates, millers in <a href="/wiki/Buffalo%2C_New_York" id="w">Buffalo, New York</a> were able to ship their flour more competitively.<sup id="_ref-Danbom_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Danbom" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>In response, companies such as the Washburn-Crosby Company and Pillsbury began marketing their brands specifically to consumers.  Washburn-Crosby branded their flour &#34;Gold Medal&#34;, in recognition of a prize won in 1880, and advertised with the slogan &#34;Eventually -- Why Not Now?&#34;  Pillsbury countered with their slogan, &#34;Because Pillsbury&#39;s Best&#34;, incorporating their brand name &#34;Pillsbury&#39;s Best&#34;.  Washburn-Crosby invented the character <a href="/wiki/Betty_Crocker" id="w">Betty Crocker</a> to answer product questions.

Washburn-Crosby merged with several other regional milling companies in 1928 and renamed themselves <a href="/wiki/General_Mills" id="w">General Mills</a>.  Both General Mills and Pillsbury sought to diversify beyond flour milling by sponsoring baking contests and publishing recipes.

<p><a href="/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey" id="w">Hubert Humphrey</a> got his start in Minnesota politics in the early 1940s.  He was an organizer of the Minnesota <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic Party</a> at the time, and he realized that the party&#39;s best chance of success would come if the <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_Farmer-Labor_Party" id="w">Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party</a> merged with the Democratic party.  Other party leaders had been discussing the merger, but Humphrey&#39;s idea was to keep the Farmer-Labor name in the name of the merged party, in order to gain the strength of thousands of loyal voters.  Thus, the party got the name <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_Democratic-Farmer-Labor_Party" id="w">Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party</a>.<sup id="_ref-Lass_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lass" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Humphrey first ran for <a href="/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_Minneapolis" id="w">mayor</a> of Minneapolis in 1943, losing by only six thousand votes.  He campaigned again in the 1945 election, with the support of the city&#39;s labor leaders, and found support with the city&#39;s African-American community by promising to implement a city <a href="/wiki/Civil_rights" id="w">civil rights</a> commission.  He also appealed to the city&#39;s middle class by giving talks on civic virtue at area churches.  He was elected in 1945 by the largest margin to date.  When elected, he immediately proposed a city ordinance that would make racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  The ordinance, adopted after a year of opposition, created the nation&#39;s first Fair Employment Practices Ordinance.  The commission leveled few fines, but the larger banks and department stores saw the value in civil rights and began to hire more African-Americans.  He also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so he instructed the city&#39;s police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders.  This helped to redefine the issue of prejudice and got its attention as a problem that could be solved, not just a fact of life that had to be taken for granted.<sup id="_ref-Risjord_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Risjord" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Humphrey&#39;s progress with civil rights in Minneapolis gained national attention, with many cities inquiring about how they could establish their own civil rights commissions.  In 1947, he was reelected with 102,000 votes over his opponent&#39;s 52,000 votes.  
As a delegate to the <a href="/wiki/1948_Democratic_National_Convention" id="w">1948 Democratic National Convention</a>, he led the call for a strong civil rights plank.<sup id="_ref-Risjord_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Risjord" title="">[3]</a></sup>  In his address, he said, &#34;There are those who say to you -- we are rushing this issue of civil rights.

Downtown Minneapolis was the hub of business and financial activity.  The <a href="/wiki/Minneapolis_City_Hall" id="w">Minneapolis City Hall</a> (which also served as the Hennepin County Courthouse at the time) was the tallest building in Minneapolis from its construction in 1888 until 1929.  A municipal ordinance instituted in 1890 restricted buildings to a height of 100&#160;feet, later raised to 125 feet.  The construction of the <a href="/wiki/501_Marquette" id="w">First National - Soo Line Building</a> in 1915, with a height of 252 feet, caused concerns among the real estate industry, so the 125-foot (twelve story) limit was reimposed at the request of the Minneapolis Civic and Commerce Association.<sup id="_ref-Millett_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Millett" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The twenty-seven story <a href="/wiki/Rand_Tower" id="w">Rand Tower</a>, built in 1929, was the next major challenger to the height limit.  The thirty-two story <a href="/wiki/Foshay_Tower" id="w">Foshay Tower</a>, also built in 1929, was the highest building in Minneapolis until 1971.<sup id="_ref-Millett_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Millett" title="">[8]</a></sup>  Its builder, Wilbur Foshay, wanted a tower built along the lines of the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Monument" id="w">Washington Monument</a>.  He staged a lavish dedication ceremony complete with a march composed by <a href="/wiki/John_Philip_Sousa" id="w">John Philip Sousa</a>.

After <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, businesses and residents started moving to the suburbs, and downtown Minneapolis, along with downtowns across the nation, was perceived as dying.  Urban planners, such as <a href="/wiki/Le_Corbusier" id="w">Le Corbusier</a>, were advocating radically rebuilding downtowns by complete rebuilding and forcing out manufacturing and warehousing.  The Federal <a href="/wiki/Housing_Act_of_1949" id="w">Housing Act of 1949</a> provided funding for clearing blighted areas, and city officials interpreted the definition of &#34;blighted&#34; liberally.  The <a href="/wiki/Federal_Aid_Highway_Act_of_1956" id="w">Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956</a> provided funding for an interstate highway system, which would also transform Minneapolis.<sup id="_ref-Millett_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Millett" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

When <a href="/wiki/General_Mills" id="w">General Mills</a> announced in 1955 that they were moving their corporate headquarters to <a href="/wiki/Golden_Valley%2C_Minnesota" id="w">Golden Valley</a>, city planners decided to implement a large-scale Gateway district plan that included demolishing a large number of buildings.

<p><a href="/wiki/Freeway" id="w">Freeway</a> construction had its impact on the city, with neighborhoods disrupted and housing stock lost.

The remaining portion of Interstate 94, from <a href="/wiki/U.S._Route_12" id="w">U.S. Highway 12</a> to the northern boundary of the city, was completed in 1982.  Highway 12 was later rebuilt to Interstate standards in 1992, at which point it was renumbered <a href="/wiki/Interstate_394" id="w">Interstate 394</a>.

One of these developments was the building of the <a href="/wiki/Nicollet_Mall" id="w">Nicollet Mall</a> in 1968.  Previously known as Nicollet Avenue, the portion within the central business became a tree-lined mall for pedestrians and transit.
