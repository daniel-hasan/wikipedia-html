<p>The <b>Sukhoi Su-25</b> is a single-seat, twin-engine jet aircraft developed in the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Sukhoi" id="w">Sukhoi Design Bureau</a>. It was designed to provide <a href="/wiki/Close_air_support" id="w">close air support</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Soviet Ground Forces</a>.  The first prototype made its maiden flight on <a href="/wiki/22_February" id="w">22 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a>. After testing, the aircraft went into series production in 1978 at <a href="/wiki/Tbilisi" id="w">Tbilisi</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Georgian_SSR" id="w">Soviet Republic of Georgia</a>. NATO assigned the new aircraft the <a href="/wiki/NATO_reporting_name" id="w">reporting name</a> &#34;Frogfoot&#34;.</p>
<p>Early variants included the Su-25UB two-seat trainer,  the Su-25BM for target-towing, and the Su-25K for export customers. Upgraded variants developed by Sukhoi include the Su-25T and the further improved Su-25TM. As of 2007, the Su-25 is the only armoured airplane still in production except the <a href="/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-34" id="w">Su-34</a> whose production just started.<sup id="_ref-Frogfoot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frogfoot" title="">[1]</a></sup> It is currently in service with <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a> and various other <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States" id="w">CIS</a> states as well as export customers.</p>
<p>During its more than twenty-five years in service, the Su-25 has seen combat with several air forces. It was heavily involved in the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_war_in_Afghanistan" id="w">Soviet war in Afghanistan</a>, flying <a href="/wiki/Counter-insurgency" id="w">counter-insurgency</a> missions against the <a href="/wiki/Mujahideen" id="w">Mujahideen</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Iraqi_Air_Force" id="w">Iraqi Air Force</a> employed Su-25s against Iran during the 1980–89 <a href="/wiki/Iran-Iraq_War" id="w">Iran-Iraq War</a>. Most of them were later destroyed or fled to Iran in the 1991 <a href="/wiki/Gulf_War" id="w">Gulf War</a>. In 1993, they were used by <a href="/wiki/Abkhazia" id="w">Abkhazian</a> <a href="/wiki/Separatist" id="w">separatists</a> against <a href="/wiki/Georgians" id="w">Georgians</a> during <a href="/wiki/War_in_Abkhazia_(1992%E2%80%931993)" id="w">Abkhazian War</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Eight years later, the <a href="/wiki/Military_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia" id="w">Macedonian Air Force</a> employed Su-25s against Albanian separatists in the <a href="/wiki/2001_Macedonia_conflict" id="w">2001 Macedonia conflict</a>.</p>
<a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2>Development</h2>

<p>In early 1968, the Soviet Ministry of Defence decided to develop a specialised <i>shturmovik</i> armoured assault aircraft in order to provide close air support for the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Soviet Ground Forces</a>. The idea of creating a ground-support aircraft came about after analysing the experience of <i>shturmovoi</i> (attack) aviation during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, and in local wars during the 1950s and 1960s.<sup id="_ref-Development_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Development" title="">[3]</a></sup> The Soviet fighter-bombers in service or under development at this time (<a href="/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-7" id="w">Su-7</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-17" id="w">Su-17</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-21" id="w">MiG-21</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-23" id="w">MiG-23</a>) did not meet the requirements for close air support of the army.<sup id="_ref-Development_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Development" title="">[3]</a></sup> They lacked essential armour plating to protect the pilot and vital equipment from ground fire and missile hits, and their high flight speeds made it difficult for the pilot to maintain visual contact with a target. Having taken into account these problems, <a href="/wiki/Pavel_Sukhoi" id="w">Pavel Sukhoi</a> and a group of leading specialists in the Sukhoi Design Bureau started preliminary design work in a comparatively short period of time, with the assistance of leading institutes of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Defence.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>In March 1969, a competition was announced by the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Air_Force" id="w">Soviet Air Force</a> that called for designs for a new battlefield close-support aircraft. Participants in the competition were the Sukhoi Design Bureau and the Design Bureaux of <a href="/wiki/Yakovlev" id="w">Yakovlev</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ilyushin" id="w">Ilyushin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mikoyan" id="w">Mikoyan</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Sukhoi finalised its &#34;T-8&#34; design in late 1968, and began in work on the first two prototypes (T8-1 and T8-2) in January 1972. The T8-1, the first airframe to be assembled, was completed just before a major national holiday on <a href="/wiki/9_May" id="w">9 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1974" id="w">1974</a>. However, it did not make its first flight until <a href="/wiki/22_February" id="w">22 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a>, after a long series of test flights by <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Ilyushin" id="w">Vladimir Ilyushin</a>. The Su-25 surpassed its main competitor in the Soviet Air Force competition, the <a href="/wiki/Ilyushin_Il-102" id="w">Ilyushin Il-102</a>, and series production was announced by the Ministry of Defence.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>During flight-testing phases of the T8-1 and T8-2 prototypes&#39; development, the Sukhoi Design Bureau&#39;s management proposed that the series production of the Su-25 should start at Factory No. 31 in <a href="/wiki/Tbilisi" id="w">Tbilisi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(country)" id="w">Soviet Republic of Georgia</a>, which at that time was the major manufacturing base for the MiG-21UM &#34;Mongol-B&#34; trainer. After negotiations and completion of all stages of the state trials, the Soviet Ministry of Aircraft Production authorised manufacture of the Su-25 at Tbilisi, allowing series production to start in 1978.<sup id="_ref-Variants_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Variants" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several Su-25 variants appeared, including modernised versions, and variants for specialised roles. The most significant designs were the Su-25UB dual-seat trainer, the Su-25BM target-towing variant, and the Su-25T for antitank missions. In addition, an Su-25KM prototype was developed by <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(country)" id="w">Georgia</a> in co-operation with Israeli company <a href="/wiki/Elbit_Systems" id="w">Elbit Systems</a> in 2001, but so far this variant has not achieved much commercial success. The Su-25 is the only armoured aircraft still in production in 2007.<sup id="_ref-Frogfoot_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frogfoot" title="">[1]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Russian_Air_Force" id="w">Russian Air Force</a> operates the largest number of Su-25s, and has plans to upgrade older aircraft to the Su-25SM variant. However, this process has been slowed due to a funding shortfall, as of early 2007 only seven aircraft had been modified.</p>
<a id="Design" name="Design"></a><h2>Design</h2>

<p>The Su-25 has a normal <a href="/wiki/Aerodynamic" id="w">aerodynamic</a> layout with a shoulder-mounted <a href="/wiki/Trapezoidal" id="w">trapezoidal</a> wing and a conventional <a href="/wiki/Tailplane" id="w">tailplane</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rudder" id="w">rudder</a>.

<p>The basic version of the aircraft was produced at Factory 31, at Tbilisi, in the <a href="/wiki/Georgian_SSR" id="w">Soviet Republic of Georgia</a>. Between 1978 and 1989, 582 single-seat Su-25s were produced in Georgia, not including aircraft produced under the Su-25K export program. This variant of the aircraft represents the backbone of the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Air_Force" id="w">Russian Air Force</a>&#39;s Su-25 fleet, currently the largest in the world.<sup id="_ref-Variants_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Variants" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The aircraft experienced a number of accidents in operational service caused by system failures attributed to salvo firing of weapons. In the wake of these incidents, use of its main armament, the 240mm <a href="/wiki/S-24" id="w">S-24</a> missile, was prohibited. In its place, the <a href="/wiki/FAB-500" id="w">FAB-500</a> 500kg general-purpose high-explosive bomb became the primary armament.<sup id="_ref-Variants_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Variants" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Su-25K" name="Su-25K"></a><h4>Su-25K</h4>
<p>The basic Su-25 model was used as the basis for a commercial export variant, known as the Su-25K (<b><i>K</i></b><i>omercheskiy</i>). This model was also built at Factory 31 in Tbilisi. The aircraft differed from the Soviet Air Force version in certain minor details concerning internal equipment. A total of 180 Su-25K aircraft were built between 1984 and 1989.<sup id="_ref-Variants_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Variants" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Su-25UB" name="Su-25UB"></a><h3>Su-25UB</h3>
<p>The Su-25UB <a href="/wiki/Trainer" id="w">trainer</a> (<b><i>U</i></b><i>chebno-<b>B</b>oyevoy</i>) was drawn up in 1977. The first prototype, called &#34;T-8UB-1&#34;, was rolled out in July 1985 and its maiden flight was carried out at the <a href="/wiki/Ulan-Ude" id="w">Ulan-Ude</a> factory airfield on August 12 of that year.<sup id="_ref-Variants_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Variants" title="">[7]</a></sup> It was intended for training and evaluation flights of active-duty pilots, and for training pilot cadets at Soviet Air Force <a href="/wiki/Flying_school" id="w">flying schools</a>. </p>
<p>The performance of the Su-25UB did not differ substantially from that of the single-seater. The navigation, attack, sighting devices and weapons-control systems of the two-seater enabled it to be used for both routine training and weapons-training missions.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> By the end of 1986, a total of 25 Su-25UBs had been produced at Ulan-Ude, despite the fact that the twin-seater had not yet completed its State trials and therefore had not been officially cleared for service with the Soviet Air Force.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Su-25UBK" name="Su-25UBK"></a><h4>Su-25UBK</h4>
<p>From 1986 to 1989, in parallel with the construction of the main Su-25UB combat training variant, the Ulan-Ude plant produced the so-called &#34;commercial&#34; Su-25UBK, intended for export to countries that bought the Su-25K, and with similar modifications to that aircraft.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Su-25UTG (<b><i>U</i></b><i>chebno-<b>T</b>renirovochnyy s <b>G</b>akom</i>) is a variant of the Su-25UB designed to train pilots in takeoff and landing on a land-based simulated carrier deck, with a sloping <a href="/wiki/Ski-jump" id="w">ski-jump</a> section and arrester wires. The first one flew in September <a href="/wiki/1988_in_aviation" id="w">1988</a>, and approximately ten were produced.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> About half remained in Russian service after 1991, used with Russia&#39;s sole <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" id="w">aircraft carrier</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Russian_aircraft_carrier_Admiral_Kuznetsov" id="w">&#39;&#39;Admiral Kuznetsov&#39;&#39;</a>. Such a small number of aircraft were insufficient to serve the training needs of Russia&#39;s carrier air group, so a number of Su-25UBs were converted into Su-25UTGs, these aircraft being distinguished by the alternative designation Su-25UBP (<b><i>U</i></b><i>chebno-<b>B</b>oyevoy <b>P</b>alubny</i>) —the adjective &#34;<i>palubnyy</i>&#34; meaning &#34;deck&#34;, indicating that these aircraft have a naval function.<sup id="_ref-Variants4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Variants4" title="">[17]</a></sup> About ten of these aircraft are currently operational in the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Navy" id="w">Russian Navy</a> as part of the 279th Naval Aviation Regiment.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

On average, each aircraft performed 360 sorties per year, a total considerably higher than that of any other combat aircraft in Afghanistan. By the end of the war, nearly 50 Su-25s were deployed at Afghan airbases, carrying out a total of 60,000 sorties.

<p>The Su-25 also saw combat during the <a href="/wiki/Iran-Iraq_War" id="w">Iran-Iraq War</a> of 1980–89. The first Su-25s were commissioned by the <a href="/wiki/Iraqi_Air_Force" id="w">Iraqi Air Force</a> in 1987 and performed approximately 900 combat sorties throughout the course of the war, carrying out the bulk of Iraqi air attack missions. During the most intense combat of the war, Iraqi Su-25s were each performing up to fifteen sorties per day each. In one recorded incident, an Iraqi Su-25 was shot down by an Iranian <a href="/wiki/MIM-23_Hawk" id="w">Hawk</a> <a href="/wiki/Surface_to_air_missile" id="w">surface to air missile</a>, but the pilot managed to eject.

Up to 30 Su-25 are reportedly stored at the 4070th Reserve Base.

<dl><dt>{{IRQ}}</dt><dd>During the course of the early phase of the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq approached the Soviet Union with a request to purchase a wide variety of military equipment. As a result, Iraq become the first non-Warsaw Pact country to obtain the Su-25K and Su-25UBK combat trainer. It is believed that Iraq received a total of 73 Su-25s, of which four were the Su-25UBK trainer. In January 1998, the Iraqi Air Force still possessed twelve Su-25s, and at least three Su-25Ks were seen in a demonstration over <a href="/wiki/Baghdad" id="w">Baghdad</a> in December 2002.
