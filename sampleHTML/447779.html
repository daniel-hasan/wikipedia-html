<b>Education in Singapore</b> is managed by <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(Singapore)" id="w">Ministry of Education</a> (MOE), which directs <a href="/wiki/Education_policy" id="w">education policy</a>. The ministry controls the development and administration of <a href="/wiki/State_school" id="w">state schools</a> which receive <a href="/wiki/Welfare_(financial_aid)" id="w">government</a> funding but also has an advisory and supervisory role to <a href="/wiki/Private_school" id="w">private schools</a>. For both private and state schools, there are variations in the extent of autonomy in their curriculum, scope of government aid and funding, <a href="/wiki/Tuition" id="w">tuition</a> burden on the students, and admission policy.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Children with disabilities attend special <a href="/wiki/Special_education" id="w">special education</a> (SPED) schools run by <a href="/wiki/List_of_voluntary_welfare_organisations_in_Singapore" id="w">Voluntary Welfare Organisations</a> (VWOs), which are and partially funded by the Ministry of Education. Education spending usually makes up about 20 per cent of the annual <a href="/wiki/Government_budget" id="w">national budget</a>, which subsidises state education and government-assisted private education for Singaporean citizens and furnishes the <a href="/wiki/Edusave" id="w">Edusave</a> programme, but the costs are significantly higher for non-citizens.</p>
<p>In 2000 the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Singapore" id="w">Parliament of Singapore</a> passed the Compulsory Education Act,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> which <a href="/wiki/Codification" id="w">codified</a> <a href="/wiki/Compulsory_education" id="w">compulsory education</a> for children of <a href="/wiki/Primary_school" id="w">primary school</a> age, and made it a <a href="/wiki/Criminal_law" id="w">criminal offence</a> if parents fail to enrol their children in school and ensure their regular attendance.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Exemptions are allowed for <a href="/wiki/Homeschooling" id="w">homeschooling</a> or full-time religious institutions, but parents must apply for exemption from the Ministry of Education and meet a minimum benchmark.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In Singapore, the <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English language</a> is the first language learned by half the children by the time they reach <a href="/wiki/Preschool" id="w">preschool</a> age and becomes the primary medium of instruction by the time they reach <a href="/wiki/Primary_education" id="w">primary school</a>. English is the language of instruction for most subjects, especially <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" id="w">mathematics</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Natural_sciences" id="w">natural sciences</a>; the official Mother Tongue languages are generally not taught in English, although there is provision for the use of English at the initial stages. Certain schools, such as <a href="/wiki/Secondary_education" id="w">secondary schools</a> under the <a href="/wiki/Special_Assistance_Plan" id="w">Special Assistance Plan</a>  (SAP) which encourages a richer use of the mother tongue may teach occasionally in English and another language. There are also other schools which have been experimenting with curricula that integrate language subjects with mathematics and the sciences, using both English and a second language. </p>
<p>Former <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore" id="w">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew" id="w">Lee Kuan Yew</a> related the idea of English as a common language in Singapore that both connected citizens of all ethnic-cultural backgrounds, so no ethnic group is forced to learn the language of another, and tied Singapore to the <a href="/wiki/World_economy" id="w">world economy</a>.

</p><a id="Kindergartens" name="Kindergartens"></a><h1>Kindergartens</h1>
<p><a href="/wiki/Kindergarten" id="w">Kindergartens</a> in Singapore provide up to three years of <a href="/wiki/Pre-school" id="w">pre-school</a> for children ages three to six. The three years are commonly called <i>Nursery</i>, <i>Kindergarten 1</i> (K1) and <i>Kindergarten 2</i> (K2), respectively. </p>
<p>Kindergartens provide an environment for children to learn how to communicate, play, and interact with others, and to prepare them for the start of formal education in primary schools. Activities include learning of language and numbers, development of personal and social skills, games, music, outdoor play. Children learn two languages, English and their official mother tongue (<a href="/wiki/Chinese_language" id="w">Chinese</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malay_language" id="w">Malay</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Tamil_language" id="w">Tamil</a>). Many private or church-based kindergartens might not offer Malay or Tamil, so non-Chinese pupils might also learn Chinese in these kindergartens.</p>
<p>The kindergartens are run by the private sector, including community foundations, religious bodies, and civic or business groups. There are more than 200 kindergartens registered with the Ministry of Education. Kindergartens are also run by <a href="/wiki/Child_care" id="w">child care</a> centres as well as <a href="/wiki/International_school" id="w">international schools</a>.</p>
<a id="Primary_education" name="Primary_education"></a><h1>Primary education</h1>
<p>Primary education is a four-year <i>foundation stage</i> (Primary 1 to 4) and a two-year <i>orientation stage</i> (Primary 5 to 6). Primary education is compulsory and free, though there is a fee of up to <a href="/wiki/Singapore_dollar" id="w">SGD</a> 13 monthly per student that goes to the school to help cover miscellaneous costs.</p>
<a id="Foundation_stage" name="Foundation_stage"></a><h2>Foundation stage</h2>
<p>The <i>foundation stage</i> is the first stage of formal schooling. The four years, from primary 1 to 4, provide a foundation in English, mother tongue (which includes Chinese, Malay, Tamil or a Non-Tamil Indian Language (NTIL)) and Mathematics. Other subjects include <a href="/wiki/Civics" id="w">civics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ethics" id="w">ethics</a> (&#34;Civics and Moral Education&#34;), <a href="/wiki/Arts_and_crafts" id="w">arts and crafts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music" id="w">music</a>, <a href="/wiki/Health_education" id="w">health education</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_studies" id="w">social studies</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Physical_education" id="w">physical education</a>, which are taught throughout Primary 1 to 6. <a href="/wiki/Science" id="w">Science</a> is taught from Primary 3 onwards.</p>
<a id="Orientation_stage" name="Orientation_stage"></a><h2>Orientation stage</h2>

<p>All pupils advance to the orientation stage after Primary 4, where English Language, Mother Tongue and Mathematics are taught at the appropriate level according to the ability of the pupils. Schools are given the flexibility to develop their own examinations  to match pupils with the levels that suit them. The streaming system has been tweaked, where previously, pupils were streamed at Primary 5 to the EM1, EM2 and EM3 (English and Mother Tongue at 1st, 2nd and 3rd language respectively) streams, pupils are streamed according to the subject from January 2008. They can take their Mother Tongue at the higher, standard or foundation levels; Science and Maths can be taken at the standard or foundation levels.</p>
<a id="Primary_School_Leaving_Examination" name="Primary_School_Leaving_Examination"></a><h2>Primary School Leaving Examination</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>At the end of Primary 6, the national <a href="/wiki/Primary_School_Leaving_Examination" id="w">Primary School Leaving Examination</a> (PSLE) is held. The examination determines whether the student is ready to leave primary school by passing; however the primary purpose of the examination is to eventually allocate places in secondary schools to students based on their performance in the examination.</p>
<a id="Secondary_education" name="Secondary_education"></a><h1>Secondary education</h1>
<p>Based on results of the PSLE, students are placed in different secondary education tracks or streams: &#34;Express&#34;, &#34;Normal (Academic)&#34;, or &#34;Normal (Technical)&#34; </p>

</p>
<p><i>Express</i> is a four-year course leading up to a <a href="/wiki/Singapore" id="w">Singapore</a>-<a href="/wiki/Cambridge" id="w">Cambridge</a> <a href="/wiki/GCE_%26%2339%3BO%26%2339%3B_Level" id="w">General Certificate of Education Ordinary-level</a> (O-level)  exam. A foreign language, either <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>, <a href="/wiki/German_language" id="w">German</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" id="w">Japanese</a> can be taken in addition to the mother tongue or can replace it. This is especially popular with students who are struggling with their mother tongues, expatriates, or students returning from abroad. Non-Chinese students may also study Chinese and non-Malay students Malay as a third language. This programme is known as CSP (Chinese Special Programme) and MSP (Malay Special Program). Mother Tongue teachers will conduct these lessons in school after usual hours. Students of Higher Mother Tongue languages are allowed to have up to two points taken off their O-level scoring,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> a scoring system discussed below where a lower value is generally considered better, if they meet set benchmarks. The <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_Language_Centre" id="w">Ministry of Education Language Centre</a> (MOELC) provides tuition-free language education for most additional languages that other schools may not cover, and provides the bulk of such education, admitting several thousand students each year. </p>
<p><i>Normal</i> is a four-year course leading up to a <a href="/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Education" id="w">Normal-level</a> (N-level) exam, with the possibility of a fifth year followed by an O-level. Normal is split into <i>Normal (Academic)</i> and <i>Normal (Technical)</i>. In Normal (Technical) students take subjects more technical in nature, such as Design and Technology, while in Normal (Academic) students are prepared to take the O-level exam and normally take subjects such as Principles of Accounting. In 2004, the Ministry of Education announced that selected students in the Normal course would have an opportunity to sit for the O-level exam directly without first taking the N-level exam.</p>
<p>With the exception of schools offering the Integrated Programme, which leads to either an <a href="/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme" id="w">International Baccalaureate Diploma</a> or to an <a href="/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Education" id="w">A-level</a> exam, most students are streamed into a wide range of course combinations at the end of their second year, making the total number of subject they have to sit for at O-level ranging between six to ten subjects with English, Mother Tongue or Higher Mother Tongue Language, Mathematics, one Science and one Humanities Elective being compulsory. The subject taken varies, and several new subjects such as Computing and Theatre Studies and Drama are being introduced in tandem with the Ministry of Education&#39;s revised curriculum. The subjects usually taken at O-Level:</p>

<a id="Grade_and_scoring_systems" name="Grade_and_scoring_systems"></a><h2>Grade and scoring systems</h2>
<p>Most schools commonly follow the kind of grading system awarded at the Singapore-Cambridge GCE &#34;O&#34; level examination, for which a student sits for at the end of four or five years of secondary education, sitting for at least 6 subjects. The level of achievement in each subject is indicated by the grade obtained, with A1 being the highest achievable grade and F9 the lowest:</p>

<ul>
<li>A1/A2 (Distinction)</li>
<li>B3/B4 (Merit)</li>
<li>C5/C6 (Credit/Pass)</li>
<li>D7 (Sub-Pass/fail, that is, passing at a lower standard in the exam or fail)</li>
<li>E8/F9 (Fail)</li></ul>
<p>A student&#39;s overall academic performance is measured through several points scoring system (such as the L1R5, L1B5 and L1R4 scoring system) depending on which type of post-secondary institution a student is intending to apply for. Each grade has a point value respective to it, for example, with grade A1 being 1 point, A2 being 2 points, and B3 being 3 points. Thus, the fewer the points obtained, the better the score. For example, in the L1R5 scoring system, the student&#39;s L1 or first language (either English or Higher Mother Tongue Language) and R5 or relevant 5 subjects (which must include at least one from the Science &#38; Mathematics group, one from the Humanities group, and excluding subjects such as Religious Studies, Mother Tongue &#34;B&#34; and CCA). Consequently, a L1R5 score of 6 points is considered to be the best score attainable for entrance to a Junior College. A student requires a L1R5 score of below 20 points to be eligible for Junior College. On top of that, students must also pass English and Mother Tongue.</p>
<p>For non-major examinations, several schools use a Mean Subject Grade (MSG) scoring system, while schools running the Integrated Programme (IP) may also use the Grade Point Assessment (GPA) scoring system.</p>
<a id="Co-Curricular_activities" name="Co-Curricular_activities"></a><h2>Co-Curricular activities</h2>
<p>&#34;<a href="/wiki/Co-curricular_activity" id="w">Co-Curricular Activities</a>&#34; (CCA) are compulsory at the secondary level, where all pupils must participate in at least one core activity, and participation is graded together with other achievement throughout the four years in a scoring system known as LEAPS (&#34;Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation, Service&#34;). There are many co-curricular activities offered at the secondary level, varying at each school and each student is judged based in these areas. Competitions and performances are regularly organized. Co-curricular activities are often categorized under the following: Uniformed Groups, Performing Arts, Clubs &#38; Societies and Sports &#38; Games. Students may also participate in more than 1 CCA.</p>
<a id="Uniformed_Groups" name="Uniformed_Groups"></a><h2>Uniformed Groups</h2>
<p>The main uniform groups are <a href="/wiki/NCC" id="w">NCC</a> (National Cadet Corps), <a href="/wiki/NPCC" id="w">NPCC</a> (National Police Cadet Corps), <a href="/wiki/National_Civil_Defence_Cadet_Corps" id="w">NCDCC</a> (National Civil Defence Cadet Corps), <a href="/wiki/St_John_Ambulance_Brigade" id="w">St John Ambulance Brigade</a>, <a href="/wiki/Red_Cross_Youth" id="w">Red Cross Youth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Scout_Association" id="w">Singapore Scout Association</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scouting_in_Singapore" id="w">Girl Guides</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Boys_Brigade" id="w">Boys Brigade</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Girls_Brigade" id="w">Girls Brigade</a>. Students are expected to learn drills and wear the respective uniforms, hence the name.</p>
<a id="Performing_Arts" name="Performing_Arts"></a><h2>Performing Arts</h2>
<p>Performing Arts CCAs can vary, although most will include the Choir, Military/Concert/Symphonic Band, Dance groups for different ethnic culture, Drama and Debate. Most here are oriented on performing and the musical arts.</p>
<a id="Clubs_%26_Societies" name="Clubs_%26_Societies"></a><h2>Clubs &#38; Societies</h2>
<p>Clubs and societies are a wide variety, ranging from <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Youth_Flying_Club" id="w">Singapore Youth Flying Club</a> to Robotics, Media and Infocomm Clubs.</p>
<a id="Sports_%26_Games" name="Sports_%26_Games"></a><h2>Sports &#38; Games</h2>

<a id="Gifted_Education_Programme" name="Gifted_Education_Programme"></a><h2>Gifted Education Programme</h2>
<p>{{main}}
The Gifted Education Programme (GEP) was set up by the Ministry of Education in 1984 amid some public concern to cater to the <a href="/wiki/Gifted" id="w">intellectually gifted</a> students. As of <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, the schools participating consisted of 9 primary schools &#8212; <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Chinese_School_(Primary)" id="w">Anglo-Chinese School (Primary)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Catholic_High_School_(Primary)" id="w">Catholic High School (Primary)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Park_Primary_School" id="w">Henry Park Primary School</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nan_Hua_Primary_School" id="w">Nan Hua Primary School</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nanyang_Primary_School" id="w">Nanyang Primary School</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rosyth_School" id="w">Rosyth School</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tao_Nan_School" id="w">Tao Nan School</a>, <a href="/wiki/St._Hilda%26%2339%3Bs_Primary_School" id="w">St. Hilda&#39;s Primary School</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Raffles_Girls%26%2339%3B_Primary_School" id="w">Raffles Girls&#39; Primary School</a>.  7 secondary schools originally started the programme, but with the introduction of the Integrated Programme, most have included the GEP programmes into their IP curriculum. The two remaining secondary GEP schools are <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Chinese_School_(Independent)" id="w">Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)</a>, an independent all-boys IP School, and <a href="/wiki/Dunman_High_School" id="w">Dunman High School</a>, a mixed autonomous government school; the autonomous all-boys <a href="/wiki/Victoria_School" id="w">Victoria School</a> had to suspend GEP classes due to low enrolment with GEP students preferring IP schools (similarly, Dunman High had their classes cut from two to one in 2004 and had no GEP classes in 2007).</p>
<p>Pupils enter the programme through a series of tests at Primary 3, which will identify the top 1 per cent of the student population. A second selection is conducted at Primary 6 for those who do well in the PSLE. In the programme, pupils are offered special enrichment programmes to cater to their needs. However, not all students in GEP are successful. Some are not accustomed to the fast pace of study which affected their performance in the core subjects and may choose not to continue the programme at the secondary level.</p>
<p>The Secondary School Gifted Education Programme will be discontinued as of end-2008 as more students take the Integrated Programme (IP).<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Integrated_Programme" name="Integrated_Programme"></a><h2>Integrated Programme</h2>
<p><div style="wigth:200px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:200px-Tower3.jpg" title="[[Hwa Chong Institution]], founded in 1919, is one of the schools in Singapore that is currently under the Integrated Programme."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200px-Tower3.jpg" alt="[[Hwa Chong Institution]], founded in 1919, is one of the schools in Singapore that is currently under the Integrated Programme." title="[[Hwa Chong Institution]], founded in 1919, is one of the schools in Singapore that is currently under the Integrated Programme." class="location-right type-thumb" width="200px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption"><a href="/wiki/Hwa_Chong_Institution" id="w">Hwa Chong Institution</a>, founded in 1919, is one of the schools in Singapore that is currently under the Integrated Programme.</div></div>

{{main}}</p>
<p>The Integrated Programme, also known as the &#34;Through-Train Programme&#34; (直通车), is a scheme which allows the cream of secondary schools in Singapore to bypass the &#34;O&#34; levels and take the &#34;A&#34; levels, <a href="/wiki/International_Baccalaureate" id="w">International Baccalaureate</a> or an equivalent examination directly at the age of 18 after six years of secondary education.</p>
<p>The programme allows for more time to be allocated to enrichment activities. By bypassing the GCE &#34;O&#34; level examinations, the students are supposedly given more time and flexibility to immerse themselves in a more broad base education which will eventually lead to the GCE &#34;A&#34; levels examination. In addition, the students enjoy more freedom in the combination of subjects between Year 1 - 4 as compared to their non-IP counterparts. Generally, only the top performers (usually from Special, and sometimes Express, stream) are eligible to be part of the IP programme. This will ensure that the main body of the students pursue their secondary education at their own pace by first completing a 4-year O Level before going on to a 2-year &#34;A&#34; level education (as opposed to a 2-year &#34;O&#34; level and 4-year &#34;A&#34; level education).</p>
<p>As a result, schools under this IP programme allow their students to skip the &#34;O&#34; levels at Secondary 4 and go straight into junior colleges (JCs) in Year5/JC1. The <a href="/wiki/Integrated_Programme" id="w">Integrated Programme</a> or the <a href="/wiki/International_Baccalaureate_Diploma_Programme" id="w">International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme</a> has become an increasingly popular alternative to normal secondary education as it is seen to have moved away from the emphasis on the mere sciences, a side effect from the post-independence need for quick and basic education, to more refined subjects such as philosophy or political science, as well as the fact that scientific concepts are more highly stressed than before, as it is judged on the work of the student, rather than through an examination. </p>
<p>The first batch of IP students will be sitting for the revised GCE &#34;A&#34; Level or International Baccalaureate Diploma examinations in 2007.</p>
<p>Some of the schools which offer the IP / IB programmes in Singapore are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dunman High School (IP)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/National_Junior_College" id="w">National Junior College</a> (IP)</li>
<li>NUS High School of Math &#38; Science (IP - NUS High School Diploma)</li>
<li>Nanyang Girls&#39; High School (IP + Bicultural Studies Programme)</li>
<li>River Valley High School (IP)</li>

<li>Victoria Junior College (IP)</li></ul>
<a id="Admission_to_post-secondary_institutions" name="Admission_to_post-secondary_institutions"></a><h2>Admission to post-secondary institutions</h2>
<p>Upon completion of the 4 or 5-year secondary school education, students (excluding of IP students) will participate in the annual <a href="/wiki/Singaporean_GCE_%26%2339%3BO%26%2339%3B_Level" id="w">Singaporean GCE &#39;O&#39; Level</a>, which will then determine their aptitude and the pre-universities or post-secondary institutions they are able to be admitted into. Pre-university centres include junior colleges for a two-year course leading up to <a href="/wiki/GCE_%26%2339%3BA%26%2339%3B_level" id="w">GCE &#39;A&#39; level</a>, or Millennia institute for a three-year course leading up to <a href="/wiki/GCE_%26%2339%3BA%26%2339%3B_level" id="w">GCE &#39;A&#39; level</a>. Both junior colleges and Millennia Institute intake students by merit, and competition among students are usually higher than, since the emphasis on academics than professional technical education. Students who wishes to pursue for a professional-centric diploma education can be admitted into post-secondary institutions such as the <a href="/wiki/Polytechnic" id="w">polytechnics</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Technical_Education" id="w">Institute of Technical Education</a> (<a href="/wiki/ITE" id="w">ITE</a>).</p>
<p>Admission to a two-year pre-university course at junior colleges after graduating secondary school is determined by the L1R5 (first language + 5 relevant subjects) scoring system. This scoring system is based on the &#39;O&#39; Level subject grades, which range from A1 (best) to F9 (worst). The candidate adds the numerical grades for six different subjects: English (or another language taken at the &#39;first language&#39; level), a Humanities subject, a Science/Mathematics subject, a Humanities/Science/Mathematics subject, and two other subjects of any kind. The best L1R5 unmodified score is therefore 6, for a student with A1 grades in six subjects which meet the criteria given.</p>
<p>Students scoring 20 points and below can be admitted for either a Science or Arts Course. In addition, a student must also achieve at least a C6 grade, which is 50% or higher, in the GCE &#39;O&#39; Level English Language and Mathematics papers in order to qualify for junior college admission. Pre-university centres are usually associated with academic excellence, however, usually expect students to attain points in the single digits, in order to be admitted. This is because the system is merit-driven, with places given to those with lower scores first.</p>
<p>For admission to a three-year pre-university course at the Millennia Institute, the L1B5 (first language + 5 best subjects of any kind) scoring system is used and students are expected to score below 20 points being admitted. Students can opt for any of the science, arts or business streams when pursuing a three-year pre-university course.</p>
<p>For students seeking admission to diploma courses in polytechnics, the L1R4 (first language + 4 relevant subjects) scoring system is used. However, students will also be required to meet specific pre-requisites outlined by the different polytechnic schools they are applying for. Students applying for courses in the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Colleges will also have an independent scoring system dependent on the course they are applying for.</p>
<p>Bonus points can be deducted from a student&#39;s raw score, thus lowering it. These bonus points may come from either scoring an &#39;A&#39; or &#39;B&#39; grade in CCA, taking Higher Mother Tongue Language and obtaining a minimum of &#39;D7&#39;, or through affiliation (for feeder schools). Bonus points are capped at 4, with exception for those applying to schools offering Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) or Malay Language Elective Programme (MLEP).</p>
<a id="Pre-university" name="Pre-university"></a><h1>Pre-university</h1>
<p>{{main}}
The pre-university centres of Singapore consists of 17 Junior Colleges (JCs) and a Centralised Institute (CI), the <a href="/wiki/Millennia_Institute" id="w">Millennia Institute</a> (MI, established 2004), with the <a href="/wiki/National_Junior_College" id="w">National Junior College</a> (NJC, established 1969) being the oldest and <a href="/wiki/Innova_Junior_College" id="w">Innova Junior College</a> (IJC, established 2005) being the youngest. The pre-university centres are designed for upper stream students (roughly the top 20%-25% of the cohort) who wish to pursue a university degree after two to three years of pre-university education, rather than stopping after <a href="/wiki/Polytechnic" id="w">polytechnic</a> post-secondary education. </p>
<p>Originally, junior colleges in Singapore were designed to offer an accelerated pre-university education of two years instead of the to traditional three-year pre-university programmes, but the two-year programme has become the norm for students pursuing university education. Junior college has become synonymous to prestigious education. There are 5 traditional &#34;top&#34; junior colleges; HCJC/HCI, NJC, RJC, TJC and VJC. The <a href="/wiki/Public_Service_Commission" id="w">Public Service Commission</a> and other coveted scholarships (such as the FireFly, <a href="/wiki/A%2AStar" id="w">A*Star</a> and the President&#39;s Scholarship) are either largely or exclusively reserved for pre-university centre students.</p>
<p>Junior Colleges (JCs) accept students based on their GCE &#34;O&#34; Level results; an L1R5 score of less than or equals to 20 points must be attained for a student to gain admission. JCs provide a 2-year course leading up to the <a href="/wiki/Singapore-Cambridge_GCE_Advanced_Level" id="w">Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level</a> (&#34;A&#34; level) examination. Centralised Institutes (CIs) accept students based on their GCE &#34;O&#34; Level results; an L1B5 score of less than or equals to 20 points must be attained for a student to gain admission. <a href="/wiki/Millennia_Institute" id="w">Millennia Institute</a>, provides a 3-year course leading up to the <a href="/wiki/Advanced_Level_(UK)" id="w">A-level</a> examinations.</p>
<a id="Funding_and_scholarships" name="Funding_and_scholarships"></a><h2>Funding and scholarships</h2>
<p>Students in most junior colleges and centralised institute pay a subsidised school fees of S$6 and up to S$22 per month for other miscellaneous equipment and special programmes fees, depending on the status and programmes offered by the college. However, certain independent junior colleges, such as Raffles Junior College and Hwa Chong Institution, will require new students to pay a higher school fees at S$300 per month. <a href="/wiki/Scholarship" id="w">Scholarships</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bursary" id="w">bursaries</a> are provided for students whose score was within the 95th percentile from the O-levels, and for students requiring <a href="/wiki/Financial_aid" id="w">financial assistance</a>. Under these schemes, they are only required to pay an amount equivalent to the school fees of a non-independent junior college. Bursary holders are required to pay a fraction of the full fees, based on their family income. A student whose household salary is S$2000 (75% of an average Singapore household income) is required to pay 75% of the full school fees, while another whose household income is less than S$1000 per month only has to pay 25%. Apart from that, there are also MOE pre-university scholarships awarded to academically-abled students who choose to pursue and specialise their education at a junior college, providing yearly scholarship allowance and remission of school fees. These scholarships include the Pre-University Scholarship, which provides a scholarship allowance of SGD750 per annum, as well as specialised scholarships such as the Humanities Scholarship, Art Elective Programme Scholarship, Language Elective Programme (French, German &#38; Japanese) Scholarship and Music Elective Programme Scholarship which provide scholarship allowances of SGD1000 per annum in addition to a remission of school fees as well as additional grants for overseas trips or programmes (ranging from SGD1000 to SGD2000).</p>

</p>
<p>There are two ways to be admitted into a pre-university centre, namely through the traditional <a href="/wiki/Joint_Admissions_Exercise" id="w">Joint Admissions Exercise</a> (JAE) as well as <a href="/wiki/Direct_School_Admission" id="w">Direct School Admission</a> (DSA). In the JAE, students apply for admission using their Singapore-Cambridge GCE &#39;O&#39; Examinations scores, while in DSA which is conducted roughly half a year earlier, students apply directly to the various colleges for placement on the basis of talent which can range from the academic, to the cultural and performing arts to sports. Upon acceptance, students will be automatically admitted to the college irrespective of the year&#39;s JAE cut-off score, although students will still have to meet the minimum criteria of scoring an L1R5 of below 20 points for entrance into a junior college (although top JCs tend to require a minimum score of 15 points and below to avoid the student from struggling academically). In the JAE, students will have to compete nationally on the basis of their academic scores and credentials to gain admission to their college of choice.</p>
<p>In the past, there used to be two intakes, namely the <a href="/wiki/Provisional_Admissions_Exercise" id="w">Provisional Admissions Exercise</a> (PAE) and the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE). However, from the 2009 academic year onwards, a single intake system will be implemented with the Singapore-Cambridge GCE &#39;O&#39; Examinations being brought forward to minimise movement and excessive administration work involved in the two-intake system.</p>
<a id="A-level_curriculum_and_examinations" name="A-level_curriculum_and_examinations"></a><h2>A-level curriculum and examinations</h2>
<p>{{Disputed-section}}
From January 2006, the two-year and three-year pre-university curriculum framework in pre-university centres was replaced with a new and revised curriculum with the first batch of students sitting for the GCE &#34;A&#34; Level examinations in 2007. In this newly enforced curriculum, the system of categorising subjects according to &#34;Alternative Ordinary (AO)&#34;, &#34;Advanced (A)&#34; and &#34;Special (S)&#34; papers or levels has been scrapped and is replaced with the Higher One (H1), Higher 2 (H2) and Higher 3 (H3) categories. H1 subjects are worth 1 Academic Units (AU), H2 subjects 2 AUs, H3 subjects 1 AUs and students are expected to take a minimum of 10 AUs (viz. 3H2+1H1) and a maximum of 12 AUs (viz. 4H2) inclusive of Mother Tongue Language (MTL), Project Work and General Paper or Knowledge &#38; Inquiry. Students who have taken Higher Mother Tongue language paper at the GCE &#34;O&#34; Level and have obtained a minimum grade of &#39;D7&#39; are exempted from taking formal MTL lessons and examinations, albeit still having to attend MTL-related enrichment and not being allowed to replace the MTL unit with another subject as MTL is still regarded as an integral component of the curriculum.</p>
<p>In tandem with the MOE&#39;s aim of achieving more depth rather than mere breadth, the H1 and H2 categories complement each other; in general, a subject taken at H1 is half the breadth of that taken at H2, but is of the same depth and difficulty. For example, students studying Mathematics at H1 will study lesser Pure Mathematics topics (which are largely Physics-related) than those studying Mathematics at H2, but will still face the same depth and difficulty in similar topics (such as Statistics). As such, a H1 paper can theoretically be said to be half of the content of a H2 paper albeit being at equal depth and difficulty (as opposed to how &#34;AO&#34; level subjects were merely easier  papers than the &#34;A&#34; level subjects previously). Subsequently, for certain subjects such as History, students taking the subject at H1 level will only sit for Paper 1 (International History from 1945-2000), while students taking the subject at H2 level will sit for the same Paper 1 (International History from 1945-2000) in addition to having to sit for Paper 2 (Southeast Asian History from 1900-1997) as well. Students taking Science subjects such as Physics, Chemistry or Biology at H1 will only sit for the Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQ) and one written paper, and are not required to take the SPA or Practical examination as those taking the subjects at H2. Consequently, this new grouping system bears some semblance to the International Baccalaureate Diploma A1/A2/SL/HL grouping system.</p>
<p>Syllabus wise, the new curriculum framework gives students more choice of subjects to choose from and enables more permutations of subject combinations. However, unlike in the old curriculum which was criticised for being too specialised and unholistic, students are now required to take up at least one contrasting subject - i.e. Science students have to take up at least one Arts/Humanities subject, while Arts/Humanities students must take up at least one Science-based subject. For example, subjects previously not available to Arts/Humanities students such as Physics, Chemistry and Biology are now made possible at both H1 and H2 levels, while Science students now have more choice of doing an Arts/Humanities subject (such as Literature) at either H1 or H2 level. Alternatively, students can choose to take up a new subject, Knowledge &#38; Inquiry, in lieu of the General Paper (GP) as a contrasting subject, as Knowledge &#38; Inquiry (KI) is designed to expose students to <a href="/wiki/Epistemology" id="w">Epistemology</a> as well as to the construction and nature of knowledge, thus calling for the need to learn across disciplines such as Mathematics, the Sciences and the Humanities. KI is said to be similar to the IB Diploma&#39;s Theory of Knowledge paper, albeit being more difficult, as students have to sit for both an examination paper and do a 2500-3000 word Independent Study research paper. Due to its intensive nature, KI is classified as a H2 subject instead of a H1 subject like the General Paper (GP).</p>
<p>The &#34;highest&#34; level subjects, the H3 subjects, are meant to be more pragmatic and promote critical thinking unlike the previous &#34;S&#34; Papers. Under the revised curriculum, H3 subjects are examined either in the form of Research Papers (be it by Cambridge, or by local Universities), Research work (such as the HSSRP and A*Star Research Programmes) or (advanced) University Modules offered by the various local Universities which are approved by the MOE. Consequently, students are able to gain extra credits and skip several modules in the University with the H3 paper done with their other GCE &#34;A&#34; Level subjects. However, in order to do a H3 subject, students must offering the corresponding subject at H2 level. H3 subjects are not offered in Millennia Institute and SRJC.</p>
<p>In general, the subjects offered under the new Singapore-Cambridge GCE &#34;A&#34; Level Examinations are (although not exhaustive):</p>
<p><b>Science &#38; Mathematics Group</b>:

<br/><i>Offered at both H1 &#38; H2 Level</i>: French, German, Japanese
<br/><i>Note: Language Subjects taken at H1 <b>do not</b> qualify as contrasting subject(s) for Science students. Only Language Elective Programme (LEP) students are offered to study French, German or Japanese at H2 level. </i></p>
<p><b>Humanities and the Arts Group</b>:
<br/><i>Offered at H1 level only</i>: General Studies in Chinese (GSC)

<br/>1.<b>Research Papers:</b> Papers are offered by Cambridge for all core subjects including new &#34;hybrid&#34; subjects such as <b>Proteomics</b>, <b><a href="/wiki/Pharmaceutical_chemistry" id="w">Pharmaceutical chemistry</a></b> and <b>Essentials of Modern Physics</b>
<br/>2.<b>Research Programmes:</b> Humanities and Social Sciences Research Programme (HSSRP) by <a href="/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore" id="w">National University of Singapore</a>, NUS Science Research Programme by <a href="/wiki/NUS" id="w">NUS</a>(NUS SRP), H3 STAR Science Research Programme (only offered to students of NJC), H3 NAV Science Research Programme (only offered to students of VJC).
<br/>3.University Modules: Modules such as <b>&#34;Geopolitics: Geographies of War and Peace&#34;</b> for Geography and History students and <b>&#34;Managerial Economics&#34;</b> for Economics students are offered and examined by the <a href="/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore" id="w">National University of Singapore</a>. NTU will also be offering several modules in 2007.</p>
<p><br/><b><i>Other Compulsory Subjects</i></b>: 
<br/><i>Offered only at H1 level</i>: Project Work, General Paper (for those who do not take KI)
<br/><i>Offered only at H2 Level</i>: Knowledge &#38; Inquiry</p>
<p>Previously, students take two subjects at &#34;Alternative Ordinary&#34; level (&#34;AO&#34; level), namely their General Paper (GP) and Mother Tongue, and three or four subjects at &#34;A&#34; level. &#34;A&#34; level subjects include <a href="/wiki/Economics" id="w">Economics</a>, Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English Literature, History, Geography, Art, Art with Higher Art (&#34;A&#34; level) taken by students in the <a href="/wiki/Art_Elective_Programme" id="w">Art Elective Programme</a>, <a href="/wiki/Theatre_Studies" id="w">Theatre Studies</a> and Drama, Computing, Higher Chinese, Chinese (&#34;A&#34; level) <a href="/wiki/Language_Elective_Programme" id="w">Language Elective Programme</a>, Music (&#34;A&#34; level), Music with Higher Music (&#34;A&#34; Level) taken by students in the <a href="/wiki/Music_Elective_Programme" id="w">Music Elective Programme</a>, General Studies in Chinese, French, German, Japanese (&#34;A&#34; level), Malay (&#34;A&#39; level), Tamil (&#34;A&#34; level). Project Work was also made compulsory from 2003.</p>
<p>To gain admittance to local universities, students must pass the General Paper (GP) or Knowledge &#38; Inquiry (KI) and obtain a minimum grade of D7 for the &#34;AO&#34; or &#34;H1&#34; level Mother Tongue Language paper. The grade obtained for the Higher Mother Tongue paper taken at &#34;O&#34; level may be used in lieu of an &#34;AO&#34; or &#34;H1&#34; level Mother Tongue Language grade. From 2008 onwards, the scores of a student&#39;s three H2 and one H1 subject will be computed inclusive of Project Work (PW) and either GP or KI for admittance into local universities (namely NUS, NTU, SMU and UniSIM).</p>

<p>The Centralised Institutes accept students based on their GCE &#34;O&#34; level results and their L1R4 score (which must be 20 points or below). A Centralised Institute provides a three-year course leading up to a GCE &#34;A&#34; level examination. There were originally four Centralized Institutes: <a href="/wiki/Outram_Institute" id="w">Outram Institute</a>, <a href="/wiki/Townsville_Institute" id="w">Townsville Institute</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jurong_Institute" id="w">Jurong Institute</a> and <a href="/wiki/Seletar_Institute" id="w">Seletar Institute</a>. <a href="/wiki/Townsville_Institute" id="w">Townsville Institute</a> and <a href="/wiki/Seletar_Institute" id="w">Seletar Institute</a> stopped accepting new students after the 1995 school year and closed down after the last batch of students graduated in 1997.</p>
<p>There currently remains only one Centralised Institute in Singapore, the <a href="/wiki/Millennia_Institute" id="w">Millennia Institute</a>, which was formed following the merger of Jurong and Outram Institutes. Additionally, only Centralised Institutes offer the Commerce Stream offering subjects such as Principles of Accounting and Management of Business. The standard of teaching and curriculum is identical to that of the Junior Colleges.</p>

<p>{{pov}}
The <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Technical_Education" id="w">Institute of Technical Education</a> (ITE) accepts students based on their GCE &#34;O&#34; level or GCE &#34;N&#34; level results and they provide 2-year courses leading to a locally recognised &#34;National ITE Certificate.&#34; There are <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Technical_Education#Colleges" id="w">10 ITE Colleges</a> in Singapore. A number of ITE graduates are doing considerably well in the workforce as they are equipped with essential skills in their various fields of study and are proficient at their jobs.  Some ITE graduates continue their education at polytechnics and universities. However, this makes up only a minuscule proportion. There is in fact a social stigmatisation of ITE students as being less capable and possibly less successful. In recent years there have been speeches made by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister of Education Tharman Shanmugaratnam acknowledging the different definitions and types of success, in a bid to work towards a more inclusive society. However this has mostly been lip service, with little concrete action being taken to give ITE students greater recognition or address the stigmatisation that exists. This is admittedly a difficult job as such views have been ingrained in society for many years. </p>
<p>ITE provides three main levels of certification:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Master National ITE Certificate (Master Nitec)</li>
<li>Higher National ITE Certificate (Higher Nitec)</li>

<p>However, on <a href="/wiki/29_April" id="w">29 April</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, The Ministry of Education permitted two new international schools to be set up and no permission is required of admitting Singapore students.

<a id="Meritocracy" name="Meritocracy"></a><h2>Meritocracy</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Meritocracy" id="w">Meritocracy</a> is a central political concept in Singapore and a fundamental principle in the education system{{Fact}} which aims to identify and groom bright young students for positions of leadership. The system places a great emphasis on academic performance in grading students and granting their admission to special programmes and universities, though this has raised concerns of breeding elitism.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Academic grades are considered as objective measures of the students&#39; ability and effort, irrespective of their social background.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Having good academic credentials is seen as the most important factor for the students&#39; career prospects in the local job market, and their future economic status.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Curricula are therefore closely tied to examinable topics, and the competitiveness of the system led to a proliferation of <i><a href="/wiki/Ten_year_series" id="w">ten year series</a></i>, which are compilation books of past examination papers that students use to prepare for examinations. </p>
<a id="Bilingualism_(Mother_Tongue)" name="Bilingualism_(Mother_Tongue)"></a><h2>Bilingualism (Mother Tongue)</h2>
<p>Bilingualism, or <i>mother tongue policy</i>, is a cornerstone of Singapore education system. While English is the first language and the medium of instruction in schools, most students are required to take a &#34;Mother Tongue&#34; subject, which could be one of the three official languages: Chinese, Malay or Tamil. A non-Tamil Indian may choose to offer Tamil or a non-official language such as <a href="/wiki/Bengali_language" id="w">Bengali</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gujarati" id="w">Gujarati</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hindi" id="w">Hindi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Punjabi" id="w">Punjabi</a> or <a href="/wiki/Urdu" id="w">Urdu</a>. This Mother Tongue is a compulsory examinable subject at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and the GCE &#34;N&#34;, &#34;O&#34; and &#34;A&#34; level examinations. Students are required to achieve a certain level of proficiency in their mother tongue as a pre-requisite for admission to local universities. Students returning from overseas may be exempted from this policy.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The bilingual policy was first adopted in <a href="/wiki/1966" id="w">1966</a>.<sup id="_ref-peopledaily20050513_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-peopledaily20050513" title="">[13]</a></sup> One of its primary objectives is to promote English as the common (and neutral) language among the <a href="/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore" id="w">diverse ethnic groups in Singapore</a>. The designation of English as the <i>first language</i> also serves to expedite Singapore&#39;s integration into the world economy.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In recognition of the linguistic and cultural pluralism in the country, another stated objective of the bilingual policy is to educate students with their &#34;mother tongues&#34; so that they can learn about their culture, identify with their ethnic roots, and to preserve the culture traits and Asian values.<sup id="_ref-peopledaily20050513_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-peopledaily20050513" title="">[13]</a></sup> Within the Chinese population, Mandarin is promoted as a common language in favour of other Chinese dialects, to better integrate the community. In 1979, the <a href="/wiki/Speak_Mandarin_Campaign" id="w">Speak Mandarin Campaign</a> was launched to further advance this goal.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Financial_assistance" name="Financial_assistance"></a><h2>Financial assistance</h2>
<p>The education policies in Singapore ensure that no child is left behind in education even if they do not have the financial capabilities to attend schools. As such, school fees in public schools are heavily subsidized such that students pay as low as $13 for fees.<sup id="_ref-eduoverview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eduoverview" title="">[16]</a></sup> Even with such low fees, there are many possible assistance schemes from either the government, or welfare organisations to help students cope with finances during their studies. Some of these are listed below.</p>
<a id="Financial_Assistance_Scheme" name="Financial_Assistance_Scheme"></a><h4>Financial Assistance Scheme</h4>
<p>The Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) is a MOE programme to provide financial assistance for education to low income families with monthly household income of less than S$1,500 or S$1,800 depending on the number of children in the household.<sup id="_ref-moe_22feb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-moe_22feb" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Students eligible for FAS receive full waiver of miscellaneous fees and partial subsidy on national examination fees. They may also enjoy full or partial fee subsidy if they are in Independent Schools. In 2005, there were 15,000 recipients of FAS; MOE is expecting this number to increase to 33,500 following an enhancement of the FAS in 2006.<sup id="_ref-moe_22feb_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-moe_22feb" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Edusave_Merit_Bursary" name="Edusave_Merit_Bursary"></a><h4>Edusave Merit Bursary</h4>
<p>Each year, the Edusave Merit Bursary (EMB) is given out to about 40,000 students, who are from lower-middle and low-income families and have good academic performance in their schools.<sup id="_ref-moe_22feb_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-moe_22feb" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>About 120 of the 353 primary and secondary schools in Singapore have some form of exchange programmes which allow students to visit overseas schools.

<p>{{EducationalScoresJapan}}
Singapore students took first place in the 1995, 1999 and 2003 <a href="/wiki/TIMSS" id="w">TIMSS</a> Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. They used Singapore Math Primary Mathematics series. The national textbooks have been adapted into a series which has been successfully marketed in North America as a rival to <a href="/wiki/Saxon_math" id="w">Saxon math</a> and an alternative to controversial <a href="/wiki/Standards-based_mathematics" id="w">standards-based mathematics</a> curricula which many parents complained moved too far away from the sort of traditional basic skills instruction exemplified by Singapore&#39;s national curriculum.</p>
<a id="Criticisms" name="Criticisms"></a><h1>Criticisms</h1>
<p>Critics of the education system, including many <a href="/wiki/Parent" id="w">parents</a>, state that the education system is too <a href="/wiki/Specialisation" id="w">specialised</a>, rigid, and <a href="/wiki/Academic_elitism" id="w">elitist</a>. Often, these criticisms state that there is little emphasis on <a href="/wiki/Creativity" id="w">creative</a> thinking, unlike education systems in other societies, such as those in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. Those defending the current education system cite that Singaporean students have regularly ranked top when competing in international science and mathematics <a href="/wiki/Competition" id="w">competitions</a> and <a href="/wiki/Assessment" id="w">assessments</a>, along with <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" id="w">South Korean</a> students. Detractors to the education system would state that this is more an indication of students&#39; skills of using <a href="/wiki/Rote_learning" id="w">rote</a> to prepare for a certain style of competition or examination, than their ability to think critically.</p>
<p>Recently, significant changes implemented by the Ministry of Education have introduced a greater focus on creative and critical thinking, and on learning for life-long skills rather than simply learning to excel in examinations.</p>
<p>There have also been complaints about excessive <a href="/wiki/Educational_streaming" id="w">educational streaming</a> at a young age. A popular local film, <i><a href="/wiki/I_Not_Stupid" id="w">I Not Stupid</a></i>, highlights the competitiveness of the system and <a href="/wiki/Social_stigma" id="w">social stigma</a> that students struggling with studies have to face.</p>
<p>Supporters of the system assert that providing differentiated curriculum according to streams since the late 1970s have allowed students with different abilities and learning styles to develop, and sustain an interest in their studies, since its introduction in the late 1970s. This ability-driven education has since been a key feature behind Singapore&#39;s success in education, and was responsible for bringing drop-out rates down sharply.</p>
<p>In recent years, while streaming still exists, various refinements to the policy have been made. There is now greater flexibility for students to cross over different streams or take subjects in other streams, which alleviates somewhat the stigma attached to being in any single stream. Furthermore, the government is now starting to experiment with ability-banding in other ways - such as subject-based banding in Primary Schools instead of banding by overall academic performance.</p>
<p>By contrast, <a href="/wiki/Standards_based_education_reform" id="w">standards based education reform</a> in the United States seeks to eliminate tracking by setting one high standard and expectation for all. The principle of <a href="/wiki/Continuous_improvement" id="w">continuous improvement</a> is thought to enable success for all students, although in most states, all groups still achieve at different levels in the current and foreseeable future. Mathematics reform in North America was driven by the <a href="/wiki/NCTM_standards" id="w">NCTM standards</a> in a direction away from mastery of basic skills, but by 2006 many districts and parents were choosing <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Math" id="w">Singapore Math</a> national textbooks for their basic skills instruction.</p>
