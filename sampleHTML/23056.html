Faith communities which recognize <a href="/wiki/Apostolic_Succession" id="w">Apostolic Succession</a> acknowledge the Bishop of Rome as successor of <a href="/wiki/Saint_Peter" id="w">St Peter</a>. As such, Catholics believe the pope to be the <a href="/wiki/Vicar_of_Christ" id="w">Vicar of Christ</a>, while the other faith communities disacknowledge Petrine primacy among the bishops. The office of the pope is called the <b>papacy</b>; his ecclesiastical jurisdiction is called the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See" id="w">&#34;Holy See&#34;</a> (<i>Sancta Sedes</i> in Latin) or <a href="/wiki/Apostolic_See" id="w">&#34;Apostolic See&#34;</a> (the latter on the basis that both St. Peter and <a href="/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle" id="w">St. Paul</a> were martyred at <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Rome</a>). Early <a href="/wiki/Bishop_(Catholic_Church)" id="w">bishops</a> occupying the <a href="/wiki/See_of_Rome" id="w">See of Rome</a> were designated <a href="/wiki/Vicar" id="w">&#34;Vicar of Peter&#34;</a>; for later popes the more authoritative Vicar of Christ was substituted; this designation was first used by the Roman <a href="/wiki/Synod" id="w">Synod</a> of 495 to refer to <a href="/wiki/Pope_Gelasius_I" id="w">Pope Gelasius I</a>, an advocate of <a href="/wiki/Primacy_of_the_Roman_Pontiff" id="w">papal supremacy</a> among the <a href="/wiki/Patriarch" id="w">patriarchs</a>. <a href="/wiki/Pope_Marcellinus" id="w">Marcellinus</a> (d. 304) is the first Bishop of Rome whom sources show used the title of pope. In the 11th century, after the <a href="/wiki/East-West_Schism" id="w">East-West Schism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Gregory_VII" id="w">Gregory VII</a> declared the term &#34;Pope&#34; to be reserved for the Bishop of Rome. The current (265th) pope is <b><a href="/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI" id="w">Pope Benedict XVI</a></b>, who was elected <a href="/wiki/April_19" id="w">April 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> in <a href="/wiki/Papal_conclave%2C_2005" id="w">papal conclave</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to his service in this spiritual role, the pope is also <a href="/wiki/Head_of_State" id="w">Head of State</a> of the independent sovereign state of the Vatican City, a <a href="/wiki/City-state" id="w">city-state</a> entirely <a href="/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave" id="w">enclaved</a> by the city of Rome. Before 1870 the pope&#39;s temporal authority extended over a large area of <a href="/wiki/Central_Italy" id="w">central Italy</a>: the territory of the <a href="/wiki/Papal_States" id="w">Papal States</a>. The papacy retained sovereign authority over the Papal States until the <a href="/wiki/Italian_unification" id="w">Italian unification</a> of 1870; a final political settlement with the <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italian</a> government was not reached until the <a href="/wiki/Lateran_Treaty" id="w">Lateran Treaty</a> of 1929.</p>
<p>For over a thousand years, popes have played powerful roles in Western Europe, crowning emperors (<a href="/wiki/Charlemagne" id="w">Charlemagne</a> was the first emperor crowned by a pope) and regulating disputes among secular rulers. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Early popes helped spread Christianity and resolve doctrinal disputes.<sup id="_ref-World History_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-World History" title="">[5]</a></sup> The Bishop of Rome continued to be nominally allied and part of the civil structure of the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" id="w">Byzantine Empire</a> until the 8th century, when the <a href="/wiki/Donation_of_Pepin" id="w">Donation of Pepin</a> gave Rome and the surrounding area to the full sovereignty of the pope, which the popes already had been <i>de facto</i> rulers, creating the Papal States that lasted until 1870. For centuries, the forged <a href="/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine" id="w">Donation of Constantine</a> also provided the basis for the papacy&#39;s claim of political supremacy over the entire former Western Roman Empire.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a>, popes struggled with monarchs over power.<sup id="_ref-World History_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-World History" title="">[5]</a></sup> They instituted the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Reformation" id="w">Catholic Reformation</a>.<sup id="_ref-World History_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-World History" title="">[5]</a></sup> Gradually forced to give up secular power, popes focused on spiritual issues.<sup id="_ref-World History_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-World History" title="">[5]</a></sup> Over the centuries, the pope&#39;s claims of spiritual authority have been ever more clearly expressed since the first centuries, culminating in the proclamation of the <a href="/wiki/Dogma" id="w">dogma</a> of <a href="/wiki/Papal_infallibility" id="w">papal infallibility</a> for those rare occasions the pope speaks <i><a href="/wiki/Ex_cathedra" id="w">ex cathedra</a></i> (literally &#34;from the chair (of Peter)&#34;) when issuing a solemn definition of <a href="/wiki/Dogma" id="w">faith</a> or <a href="/wiki/Morals" id="w">morals</a>.<sup id="_ref-World History_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-World History" title="">[5]</a></sup> The last such occasion was in the year 1950 with the definition of the dogma of the <a href="/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary" id="w">Assumption of Mary</a>.</p>

</p><a id="Early_history" name="Early_history"></a><h2>Early history</h2>

<p>During the first century of the Christian Church, the Roman capital became recognized as a Christian center of exceptional importance; but there are only a few 1st century references to the recognition of the <a href="/wiki/Primacy_of_the_Roman_Pontiff" id="w">authoritative primacy</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See" id="w">Roman See</a> outside of Rome. The fact that <a href="/wiki/Clement_of_Rome" id="w">Clement of Rome</a>&#39;s letter to the Corinthians (written <i>c.</i> 96)<sup id="_ref-fn_2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fn_2" title="">[6]</a></sup> adopted a pastoral tone, and also the fact that <a href="/wiki/St._Ignatius_of_Antioch" id="w">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a> once used the word &#34;preside&#34; in the same sentence that he used the word &#34;Romans&#34; in his letter to the Romans (written <i>c.</i> 105)<sup id="_ref-fn_3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fn_3" title="">[7]</a></sup> are seen by some historians to present proof of the existence of a certain early papal primacy.  Others argue that these documents refer only to a primacy of honor. The <a href="/wiki/Petrine_Doctrine" id="w">Petrine Doctrine</a> is still controversial as an issue of doctrine that continues to divide the eastern and western churches as well as separating Protestants from Rome.</p>
<p>During the second century AD, further manifestations of Roman authority over other churches were clearly evident. In the second century (AD 189), the assertion of the primacy of the Church of Rome may be indicated in <a href="/wiki/Irenaeus_of_Lyons" id="w">Irenaeus of Lyons</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/On_the_Detection_and_Overthrow_of_the_So-Called_Gnosis" id="w">Against Heresies</a></i> (3:3:2): &#34;With [the Church of Rome], because of its superior origin, all the churches must agree... and it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the apostolic tradition.&#34;  This may be the first clear instance of the church in Rome asserting its primacy. Furthermore, in AD 195, <a href="/wiki/Pope_Victor_I" id="w">Pope Victor I</a>, excommunicated the <a href="/wiki/Quartodecimans" id="w">Quartodecimans</a> for observing Easter on the 14th of Nisan, a tradition handed down by <a href="/wiki/John_the_Evangelist" id="w">St. John the Evangelist</a> based on the Jewish <a href="/wiki/Passover" id="w">Passover</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Easter_controversy" id="w">Easter controversy</a>). This exercise of Roman authority over other churches, even of apostolic origin, is still present today in the Western uniformity of calculating the day of Easter (though the Eastern Churches, even those in communion with Rome calculate the date of Easter differently. See <a href="/wiki/Computus" id="w">computus</a>).</p>
<p>After the imperial capital was moved to <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a> in AD 330 the eastern churches, especially the Bishop of Constantinople, started to assert pre-eminence by virtue of its imperial status.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/First_Council_of_Constantinople" id="w">First Council of Constantinople</a> (AD 381) suggested strongly that Roman primacy was already asserted; however, it should be noted that, because of the controversy over this claim, the pope did not personally attend this <a href="/wiki/Ecumenical_council" id="w">ecumenical council</a>, which was held in the eastern capital of the Roman empire, rather than at <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Rome</a>. It was not until 440 that <a href="/wiki/Pope_Leo_I" id="w">Leo the Great</a> more clearly articulated the extension of papal authority as doctrine, promulgating in edicts and in councils his right to exercise &#34;the full range of apostolic powers that Jesus had first bestowed on the apostle Peter&#34;. It was at the ecumenical <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Chalcedon" id="w">Council of Chalcedon</a> in 451 that Leo I (through his emissaries) stated that he was &#34;speaking with the voice of Peter&#34;. At this same council, the Bishop of Constantinople was given a primacy of honour equal to that of the Bishop of Rome, because &#34;Constantinople is the New Rome.&#34;</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Dogma" id="w">dogmas</a> and traditions of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic Church</a> teach that the institution of the papacy was first mandated by Biblical passages:</p>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>The name &#34;Peter&#34; ({{Polytonic}} in Greek) in Matthew 16:18 translates as <i>rock</i> but the masculine form meaning pebble, the word Jesus spoke (being that he spoke Aramaic) is &#34;kepher&#34; meaning rock.  Isaiah 22:22 is used to show the Old Testament connection to the &#34;keys.&#34;  The Bible further explains the position of Eliakim in Isaiah in the following:
</p><blockquote>
<p>&#34;Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was <i>in charge of the palace</i>...&#34; ({{bibleverse}})
</p></blockquote>

<p>Some Jewish commentators of the Old Testament understood {{bibleverse}} in a manner similar to Peter with this commentary from the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Encyclopedia" id="w">Jewish Encyclopedia</a> on Peter regarding Abraham:</p>
<p>&#34;Upon Abraham as top of the rocks God said I shall build my kingdom&#34;</p>
<p>The reference to the &#34;keys of the kingdom of heaven&#34; here are the basis for the symbolic keys often found in Catholic papal symbolism, such as in the Vatican Coat of Arms (see below).</p>
<p>The first Bishop of Rome to style himself <i>pope</i> was <a href="/wiki/Pope_Siricius" id="w">Pope Siricius</a>,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> who occupied that office at the very end of the 4th century. Prior to that, the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Patriarchs_of_Alexandria" id="w">Patriarchs of Alexandria</a> had been titled <i>pope</i> beginning with Pope <a href="/wiki/Heraclas_of_Alexandria" id="w">Heraclas</a> in 232.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>The pope was originally chosen by those senior <a href="/wiki/Clergy" id="w">clergymen</a> resident in and near Rome. In 1059 the electorate was restricted to the <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" id="w">Cardinals</a> of the Holy Roman Church, and the individual votes of all Cardinal Electors were made equal in 1179. <a href="/wiki/Pope_Urban_VI" id="w">Pope Urban VI</a>, elected 1378, was the last pope who was not already a cardinal at the time of his election. <a href="/wiki/Canon_law" id="w">Canon law</a> requires that if a layman or non-bishop is elected, he receives episcopal consecration from the <a href="/wiki/Dean_of_the_College_of_Cardinals" id="w">Dean of the College of Cardinals</a> before assuming the Pontificate. Under present canon law, the pope is elected by the cardinal electors, comprising those cardinals who are under the age of 80.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Second_Council_of_Lyons" id="w">Second Council of Lyons</a> was convened on <a href="/wiki/May_7" id="w">May 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1274" id="w">1274</a>, to regulate the election of the pope. This Council decreed that the cardinal electors must meet within ten days of the pope&#39;s death, and that they must remain in seclusion (see <a href="/wiki/Papal_conclave" id="w">Papal conclave</a>) until a pope has been elected; this was prompted by the three-year <i><a href="/wiki/Sede_Vacante" id="w">Sede Vacante</a></i> following the death of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Clement_IV" id="w">Pope Clement IV</a> in 1268. By the mid-sixteenth century, the electoral process had more or less evolved into its present form, allowing for alteration in the time between the death of the pope and the meeting of the cardinal electors.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the vote was conducted by <a href="/wiki/Acclamation" id="w">acclamation</a>, by selection (by committee), or by plenary vote. Acclamation was the simplest procedure, consisting entirely of a voice vote, and was last used in 1621. <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II" id="w">Pope John Paul II</a> abolished vote by acclamation and by selection by committee, and henceforth all Popes will be elected by full vote of the <a href="/wiki/College_of_Cardinals" id="w">Sacred College of Cardinals</a> by <a href="/wiki/Ballot" id="w">ballot</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Papal_election" id="w">Papal election</a>).</p>

<p>The election of the pope almost always takes place in the <a href="/wiki/Sistine_Chapel" id="w">Sistine Chapel</a>, in a sequestered meeting called a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Papal_conclave" id="w">conclave</a>&#34; (so called because the cardinal electors are theoretically locked in, <i>cum clave</i>, until they elect a new pope). Three cardinals are chosen by lot to collect the votes of absent cardinal electors (by reason of illness), three are chosen by lot to count the votes, and three are chosen by lot to review the count of the votes. The ballots are distributed and each cardinal elector writes the name of his choice on it and pledges aloud that he is voting for &#34;one whom under God I think ought to be elected&#34; before folding and depositing his vote on a plate atop a large chalice placed on the altar (in the 2005 conclave, a special urn was used for this purpose instead of a chalice and plate). The plate is then used to drop the ballot into the chalice, making it difficult for any elector to insert multiple ballots. Before being read, the number of ballots are counted while still folded; if the total number of ballots does not match the number of electors, the ballots are burned unopened and a new vote is held. Otherwise, each ballot is read aloud by the presiding Cardinal, who pierces the ballot with a needle and thread, stringing all the ballots together and tying the ends of the thread to ensure accuracy and honesty. Balloting continues until a Pope is elected by a two-thirds majority (with the promulgation of <i>Universi Dominici Gregis</i> in 1996, a simple majority after a deadlock of twelve days was allowed, but this was revoked by Pope <a href="/wiki/Benedict_XVI" id="w">Benedict XVI</a> by <i><a href="/wiki/Motu_proprio" id="w">motu proprio</a></i> in 2007).</p>
<p>One of the most famous aspects of the papal election process is the means by which the results of a ballot are announced to the world. Once the ballots are counted and bound together, they are burned in a special stove erected in the Sistine Chapel, with the smoke escaping through a small chimney visible from <a href="/wiki/St._Peter%26%2339%3Bs_Square" id="w">St. Peter&#39;s Square</a>. The ballots from an unsuccessful vote are burned along with a chemical compound in order to produce black smoke, or <i>fumata nera</i>. (Traditionally, wet straw was used to help create the black smoke, but a number of &#34;false alarms&#34; in past conclaves have brought about this concession to modern chemistry.) When a vote is successful, the ballots are burned alone, sending white smoke (<i>fumata bianca</i>) through the chimney and announcing to the world the election of a new pope. At the end of the conclave that elected <a href="/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI" id="w">Pope Benedict XVI</a>, church bells were also rung to signal that a new pope had been chosen.</p>
<p>The Dean of the College of Cardinals then asks the cardinal who has been successfully-elected two solemn questions. First he asks, &#34;Do you freely accept your election?&#34; If he replies with the word <i>&#34;Accepto&#34;</i>, his reign as Pope begins at that instant, <i>not</i> at the inauguration ceremony several days afterward. The Dean then asks, &#34;By what name shall you be called?&#34; The new pope then announces the <a href="/wiki/Regnal_name" id="w">regnal name</a> he has chosen for himself. (If the Dean himself is elected pope, the Vice Dean performs this duty).</p>
<p>The new pope is led through the &#34;Door of Tears&#34; to a dressing room in which three sets of white papal vestments (<i>immantatio</i>) await: small, medium, and large. Donning the appropriate vestments and reemerging into the Sistine Chapel, the new pope is given the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Ring_of_the_Fisherman" id="w">Fisherman&#39;s Ring</a>&#34; by the <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_Camerlengo" id="w">Cardinal Camerlengo</a>, whom he first either reconfirms or reappoints. The pope then assumes a place of honor as the rest of the cardinals wait in turn to offer their first &#34;obedience&#34; (<i>adoratio</i>) and to receive his blessing.</p>
<p>The senior <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_Deacon" id="w">Cardinal Deacon</a> then announces from a balcony over St. Peter&#39;s Square the following <a href="/wiki/Habemus_Papam" id="w">proclamation</a>: <i>Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum! Habemus Papam!</i> (&#34;I announce to you a great joy! We have a pope!&#34;). He then announces the new pope&#39;s Christian name along with the new name he has adopted as his regnal name.</p>
<p>Until 1978 the pope&#39;s election was followed in a few days by the <a href="/wiki/Papal_Coronation" id="w">Papal Coronation</a>. A procession with great pomp and circumstance formed from the <a href="/wiki/Sistine_Chapel" id="w">Sistine Chapel</a> to <a href="/wiki/St._Peter%26%2339%3Bs_Basilica" id="w">St. Peter&#39;s Basilica</a>, with the newly elected pope borne in the <i><a href="/wiki/Sedia_gestatoria" id="w">sedia gestatoria</a></i>. There, after a solemn <a href="/wiki/Papal_Mass" id="w">Papal Mass</a>, the new pope was crowned with the <i><a href="/wiki/Papal_Tiara" id="w">triregnum</a></i> (papal tiara) and he gave for the first time as pope the famous blessing <i><a href="/wiki/Urbi_et_Orbi" id="w">Urbi et Orbi</a></i> (&#34;to the City [Rome] and to the World&#34;). Another renowned part of the coronation was the lighting of a bundle of <a href="/wiki/Flax" id="w">flax</a> at the top of a gilded pole, which would flare brightly for a moment and then promptly extinguish, with the admonition <i><a href="/wiki/Sic_transit_gloria_mundi" id="w">Sic transit gloria mundi</a></i> (&#34;Thus passes worldly glory&#34;). A similar sombre warning against papal hubris made on this occasion was the ritual exclamation <i>&#34;Annos Petri non videbis&#34;</i>, reminding the newly crowned Pope that he would not live to see his rule lasting as long as that of St. Peter, who according to tradition headed the church for 35 years and has thus far been the longest reigning Pope in the history of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Traditionalist_Catholic" id="w">traditionalist Catholic</a> belief claims the existence of the <a href="/wiki/Papal_Oath_(Traditionalist_Catholic)" id="w">Papal Oath</a> (not to be confused with the <a href="/wiki/Oath_Against_Modernism" id="w">Oath Against Modernism</a> mandated by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_X" id="w">Pope Pius X</a>), which the popes from <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_I" id="w">John Paul I</a> on are said to have refused to swear, but there is no reliable authority for this claim.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> term <i>sede vacante</i> (&#34;vacant seat&#34;) refers to a papal <a href="/wiki/Interregnum" id="w">interregnum</a>, the period between the death of a pope and the election of his successor. From this term is derived the term <a href="/wiki/Sedevacantism" id="w">sedevacantism</a>, which designates a category of dissident, Catholics who maintain that there is no canonically and legitimately elected Pope, and that there is therefore a <i>Sede Vacante</i>. One of the most common reasons for holding this belief is the idea that the reforms of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council" id="w">Second Vatican Council</a> and especially the replacement of the <a href="/wiki/Tridentine_Mass" id="w">Tridentine Mass</a> with the <i><a href="/wiki/Mass_of_Paul_VI" id="w">Mass of Paul VI</a></i> are heretical, and that, per the dogma of papal infallibility, it is impossible for a valid Pope to have done these things. Secevacantists are considered to be <a href="/wiki/Schism" id="w">schismatics</a> by the mainstream Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>For centuries, the papacy was an institution dominated by <a href="/wiki/Italians" id="w">Italians</a>. Prior to the election of the Polish cardinal <a href="/wiki/Karol_Wojtyla" id="w">Karol Wojtyla</a> as Pope John Paul II in 1978, the last non-Italian was <a href="/wiki/Pope_Adrian_VI" id="w">Pope Adrian VI</a> of the Netherlands, elected in 1522. John Paul II was followed by the German-born Benedict XVI, leading some to believe the Italian domination of the papacy to be over.</p>
<a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h3>Death</h3>
<p>The current regulations regarding a papal <a href="/wiki/Interregnum" id="w">interregnum</a> &#8212; that is, a <i><a href="/wiki/Sede_vacante" id="w">sede vacante</a></i> (&#34;vacant seat&#34;) &#8212; were promulgated by John Paul II in his 1996 document <i><a href="/wiki/Universi_Dominici_Gregis" id="w">Universi Dominici Gregis</a></i>. During the &#34;Sede Vacante&#34;, the <a href="/wiki/College_of_Cardinals" id="w">Sacred College of Cardinals</a>, composed of the pope&#39;s principal advisors and assistants, is collectively responsible for the government of the Church and of the Vatican itself, under the direction of the <a href="/wiki/Camerlengo" id="w">Cardinal Chamberlain</a>; however, canon law specifically forbids the cardinals from introducing any innovation in the government of the Church during the vacancy of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See" id="w">Holy See</a>. Any decision that requires the assent of the pope has to wait until the new pope has been elected and accepts office.</p>
<p>It has long been claimed that a pope&#39;s death is officially determined by the Cardinal Chamberlain by gently tapping the late pope&#39;s head thrice with a silver hammer and calling his birth name three times, though this is disputed and has never been confirmed by the Vatican; there is general agreement that even if this procedure ever actually occurred, it was likely not employed upon the death of John Paul II. A <a href="/wiki/Medical_doctor" id="w">doctor</a> may or may not have already determined that the pope had died before this point. The Cardinal Chamberlain then retrieves the <a href="/wiki/Ring_of_the_Fisherman" id="w">Ring of the Fisherman</a>. Usually the ring is on the pope&#39;s right hand. But in the case of Paul VI, he had stopped wearing the ring during the last years of his reign. In other cases the ring might have been removed for medical reasons. The Chamberlain cuts the ring in two in the presence of the Cardinals. The deceased pope&#39;s seals are defaced, to keep them from ever being used again, and his personal apartment is sealed.</p>
<p>The body then lies in state for a number of days before being interred in the <a href="/wiki/Crypt" id="w">crypt</a> of a leading church or cathedral; the popes of the 20th century were all interred in <a href="/wiki/St._Peter%26%2339%3Bs_Basilica" id="w">St. Peter&#39;s Basilica</a>. A nine-day period of mourning (<i>novem dialis</i>) follows after the interment of the late Pope.

<p>This right has been exercised by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Celestine_V" id="w">Pope Celestine V</a> in 1294 and <a href="/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XII" id="w">Pope Gregory XII</a> in 1409, Gregory XII being the last to do so.</p>
<p>It was widely reported in June and July 2002 that Pope John Paul II firmly refuted the speculation of his resignation using Canon 332, in a letter to the Milan daily newspaper <i>Corriere della Sera</i>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, 332 §2 caused speculation that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pope <a href="/wiki/John_Paul_II" id="w">John Paul II</a> would have resigned as his health failed, or</li>
<li>a properly manifested legal instrument had been prepared which effected his resignation if he could not perform his duties.</li></ul>
<p>Pope John Paul II, however, did not resign. He died on <a href="/wiki/2_April" id="w">2 April</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> after a long period of ill-health and was buried on <a href="/wiki/8_April" id="w">8 April</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>. After his death, it was reported in his <a href="/wiki/Last_will_and_testament" id="w">last will and testament</a> that he considered abdicating in 2000 as he neared his 80th birthday. That portion of the will, however, is unclear and others interpret it differently.</p>

<a id="History" name="History"></a><h3>History</h3>
<p>The title &#34;<b>Vicar of Christ</b>&#34; refers to the Pope&#39;s claims of divine commission. This title came into use in the fifth and sixth centuries. The Christian Church prior to Constantine reserved the titles, &#34;Vicar of Christ&#34; and <b>&#34;Vicar of the Lord</b>&#34; exclusively for the Holy Spirit, whom Jesus sent to His Apostles to complete their training (John 16:12-15). Tertullian demonstrates this fact in the following quotes:</p>
<p>&#34;Grant, then, that all have erred; that the apostle was mistaken in giving his testimony; that the Holy Ghost ... He, the Steward of God, the Vicar of Christ ...<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;For what kind of (supposition) is it, that, while the devil is always operating and adding daily to the ingenuities of iniquity, the work of God should either have ceased, or else have desisted from advancing? whereas the reason why the Lord sent the Paraclete was, that, since human mediocrity was unable to take in all things at once, discipline should, little by little, be directed, and ordained, and carried on to perfection, by that Vicar of the Lord, the Holy Spirit.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>&#34;</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council" id="w">Second Vatican Council</a> confirmed the titles &#34;Vicar of Christ&#34; and &#34;Successor of Peter&#34; as titles of the pope.</p>
<p>The use of the term &#34;<b>Supreme Pontiff</b>&#34; (<i><a href="/wiki/Pontifex_Maximus" id="w">Pontifex Maximus</a></i>) by the pope can be traced back to the end of the fourth century. This ancient title of the Roman High-Priest, whose origins date from the foundation of Rome, was assumed by the Bishops of Rome after being relinquished by the <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Gratian" id="w">Emperor Gratian</a>. The term has also been applied to other metropolitan bishops, although examples are limited (see <i><a href="/wiki/Pontifex_Maximus" id="w">Pontifex Maximus</a></i>). It was in the eleventh century that the title came to be applied exclusively to the Bishop of Rome. The addition of the phrase &#34;of the Universal Church&#34; is a more recent alteration of this title.</p>
<p>Finally, the title attached to the pope, &#34;<b>Servant of the Servants of God</b>&#34;, although used by Church leaders including <a href="/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo" id="w">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="/wiki/St._Benedict" id="w">St. Benedict</a>, was first used by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Gregory_I" id="w">Pope St. Gregory the Great</a> in his dispute with the Patriarch of Constantinople after the latter assumed the title <a href="/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch" id="w">Ecumenical Patriarch</a>. It was not reserved for the pope until the thirteenth century. The documents of Vatican II reinforced the understanding of this title as a reference to the pope&#39;s role as a function of collegial authority, in which the Bishop of Rome serves the world&#39;s bishops.</p>
<p>The titles &#34;<b>Primate of Italy</b>&#34;, &#34;<b>Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman province</b>&#34;, and &#34;<b>Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City</b>&#34; are references to the legal and canonical authority of the pope as defined by the laws of the Church and the <a href="/wiki/Lateran_Treaty" id="w">Lateran Treaty</a> of 1929.</p>
<p>The pope&#39;s signature is usually in the format <i>NN. PP. x</i> (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Pope_Paul_VI" id="w">Pope Paul VI</a> signed his name as &#34;Paulus PP. VI&#34;), the &#34;PP.&#34; standing for <i>Papa</i> (&#34;Pope&#34;), and his name is frequently accompanied in inscriptions by the abbreviation <i>Pont. Max.</i> or <i>P.M.</i> (abbreviation of the Latin title <i>Pontifex Maximus</i>, usually translated as &#34;Supreme Pontiff&#34;).  The signature of <a href="/wiki/Papal_bull" id="w">papal bulls</a> is customarily <i>NN. Episcopus Ecclesiae Catholicae</i> (&#34;NN. Bishop of the Catholic Church&#34;), while the heading is <i>NN. Episcopus <a href="/wiki/Servus_Servorum_Dei" id="w">Servus Servorum Dei</a></i> (&#34;NN. Bishop and Servant of the Servants of God&#34;).  Other titles used in some official capacity in the past include <i>Summus Pontifex</i> (&#34;Highest Pontiff&#34;), <i>Sanctissimus Pater</i> and <i>Beatissimus Pater</i> (&#34;Most Holy Father&#34; and &#34;Most Blessed Father&#34;), <i>Sanctissimus Dominus Noster</i> (&#34;Our Most Holy Lord&#34;), and, in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Medieval period</a>, <i>Dominus Apostolicus</i> (&#34;Apostolic Lord&#34;). This title, however, was not abandoned altogether: the pope is still referred to as &#34;Dominum Apostolicum&#34; in the Latin version of the <a href="/wiki/Litany_of_the_Saints" id="w">Litany of the Saints</a>, a solemn Catholic prayer.  Writing informally, Catholics will often use the abbreviation H.H. (His Holiness), as in H.H., Benedict XVI.</p>
<p>The pope&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Cathedra" id="w">official seat</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cathedral" id="w">cathedral</a> is the <a href="/wiki/Basilica_of_St._John_Lateran" id="w">Basilica of St. John Lateran</a>, and his official residence is the <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_the_Vatican" id="w">Palace of the Vatican</a>. He also possesses a summer palace at <a href="/wiki/Castel_Gandolfo" id="w">Castel Gandolfo</a> (situated on the site of the ancient city-state <a href="/wiki/Alba_Longa" id="w">Alba Longa</a>). Historically, the official residence of the Pope was the <a href="/wiki/Lateran_Palace" id="w">Lateran Palace</a>, donated by the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Emperor" id="w">Roman Emperor</a> <a href="/wiki/Constantine_I_of_the_Roman_Empire" id="w">Constantine the Great</a>. </p>
<p>The Pope&#39;s ecclesiastical jurisdiction (the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See" id="w">Holy See</a>) is distinct from his secular jurisdiction (Vatican City). It is the Holy See which conducts international relations; for hundreds of years, the papal court (the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Curia" id="w">Roman Curia</a>) has functioned as the government of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The name &#34;Holy See&#34; (also &#34;Apostolic See&#34;) is in ecclesiastical terminology the <a href="/wiki/Ordinary_jurisdiction" id="w">ordinary jurisdiction</a> of the Bishop of Rome (including the Roman Curia); the pope&#39;s various honors, powers, and privileges within the Catholic Church and the international community derive from his Episcopate of Rome in lineal succession from the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_apostles" id="w">Apostle</a> <a href="/wiki/St._Peter" id="w">St. Peter</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Apostolic_Succession" id="w">Apostolic Succession</a>). Consequently, Rome has traditionally occupied a central position in the Catholic Church, although this is not necessarily so. The pope derives his Pontificate from being Bishop of Rome but is not required to live there; according to the Latin formula <i>ubi Papa, ibi Curia</i>, wherever the Pope resides is the central government of the Church, provided that the pope is Bishop of Rome. As such, between 1309 and 1378, the popes lived in <a href="/wiki/Avignon" id="w">Avignon</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Avignon_Papacy" id="w">Avignon Papacy</a>), a period often called the <a href="/wiki/Babylonian_Captivity" id="w">Babylonian Captivity</a> in allusion to the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Biblical</a> <a href="/wiki/Exile" id="w">exile</a> of <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a>.</p>
<p>The title &#34;<b>Patriarch of the West</b>&#34; did not appear in the 2006 pontifical yearbook, and this led to considerable media speculation. The title Patriarch of the West was first used by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Theodore" id="w">Pope Theodore</a> in 642, and was only used occasionally. Indeed, it did not begin to appear in the pontifical yearbook until 1863. On <a href="/wiki/22_March" id="w">22 March</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, the Vatican released a statement explaining this omission on the grounds of expressing a &#34;historical and theological reality&#34; and of &#34;being useful to ecumenical dialogue&#34;. The title Patriarch of the West symbolized the pope&#39;s special relationship with, and jurisdiction over, the Latin Church — and the omission of the title neither symbolizes in any way a change in this relationship, nor distorts the relationship between the Holy See and the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Churches" id="w">Eastern Churches</a>, as solemnly proclaimed by Vatican II.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since in the Eastern Churches the title &#34;pope&#34; does not unambiguously refer to the Bishop of Rome, within them the construction &#34;Pope of Rome&#34; is frequently used whether they are in communion with Rome or not.</p>

<li>&#34;<a href="/wiki/Papal_Tiara" id="w">Triregnum</a>&#34;, also called the &#34;tiara&#34; or &#34;triple crown&#34;, represents the pope&#39;s three functions as &#34;supreme pastor&#34;, &#34;supreme teacher&#34; and &#34;supreme priest&#34;. Recent popes have not, however, worn the <i>triregnum</i>, though it remains the symbol of the papacy and has not been abolished. In liturgical ceremonies Popes wear an episcopal <a href="/wiki/Mitre" id="w">mitre</a> (an erect cloth hat).</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Pastoral_Staff" id="w">Pastoral Staff</a> topped by a <a href="/wiki/Crucifix" id="w">crucifix</a>, a custom established before the 13th century (see <a href="/wiki/Papal_cross" id="w">papal cross</a>).</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Pallium" id="w">Pallium</a>, or pall, a circular band of fabric worn around the neck over the <a href="/wiki/Chasuble" id="w">chasuble</a>.  It forms a yoke about the neck, breast and shoulders and has two pendants hanging down in front and behind, and is ornamented with six crosses. Previously, the pallium worn by the pope was identical to those he granted to the <a href="/wiki/Primate_(religion)" id="w">primates</a>, but in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI began to use a distinct papal pallium that is larger than the primatial, and was adorned with red crosses instead of black.</li>

The use of the <i>flabella</i> was discontinued by <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_I" id="w">Pope John Paul I</a>. The use of the <i>sedia gestatoria</i> was discontinued by <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II" id="w">Pope John Paul II</a>, being replaced by the so-called <a href="/wiki/Popemobile" id="w">Popemobile</a>.</li></ul>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Heraldry" id="w">heraldry</a>, each pope has his own <a href="/wiki/Papal_Coat_of_Arms" id="w">Papal Coat of Arms</a>. Though unique for each pope, the arms are always surmounted by the aforementioned two keys in <a href="/wiki/Saltire" id="w">saltire</a> (i.e., crossed over one another so as to form an <i>X</i>) behind the <a href="/wiki/Escutcheon" id="w">escutcheon</a> (shield) (one silver key and one gold key, tied with a red cord), and above them a silver <i>triregnum</i> with three gold crowns and red <i>infulae</i> (<a href="/wiki/Lappet" id="w">lappets</a>—two strips of fabric hanging from the back of the triregnum which fall over the neck and shoulders when worn). This is <a href="/wiki/Blazon" id="w">blazoned</a>: &#34;two keys in saltire or and argent, interlacing in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or&#34;). With the recent election of <a href="/wiki/Benedict_XVI" id="w">Benedict XVI</a> in 2005, his personal coat of arms eliminated the papal tiara; a <a href="/wiki/Mitre" id="w">mitre</a> with three horizontal lines is used in its place, with the pallium, a papal symbol of authority more ancient than the tiara, the use of which is also granted to metropolitan <a href="/wiki/Archbishops" id="w">archbishops</a> as a sign of communion with the See of Rome, was added underneath of the shield. The distinctive feature of the crossed keys behind the shield was maintained. The omission of the tiara in the Pope&#39;s personal coat of arms, however, did not mean the total disappearance of it from papal heraldry, since the coat of arms of the Holy See was kept unaltered.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Flag" id="w">flag</a> most frequently associated with the pope is the yellow and white <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Vatican_City" id="w">flag of Vatican City</a>, with the arms of the Holy See (blazoned: &#34;Gules, two keys in saltire or and argent, interlacing in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or&#34;) on the right-hand side (the &#34;fly&#34;) in the white half of the flag (the left-hand side—the &#34;hoist&#34;—is yellow). The pope&#39;s escucheon does not appear on the flag. This flag was first adopted in 1808, whereas the previous flag had been red and gold, the traditional colors of the papacy. Although Pope Benedict XVI replaced the triregnum with a mitre on his personal coat of arms, it has been retained on the flag.</p>

<p>The Dogmatic Constitution&#39;s second chapter, &#34;On the permanence of the primacy of blessed Peter in the Roman pontiffs&#34;, states that (s.1) &#34;that which our Lord Jesus Christ [...] established in the blessed apostle Peter [...] must of necessity remain forever, by Christ&#39;s authority, in the church which, founded as it is upon a rock, will stand firm until the end of time,&#34; that (s.3) &#34;whoever succeeds to the <a href="/wiki/Chair_of_St._Peter" id="w">Chair of Peter</a> obtains by the institution of Christ Himself, the primacy of Peter over the whole church&#34;, and that (s.5) &#34;if anyone says that it is not by the institution of Christ the Lord Himself (that is to say, by <a href="/wiki/Divine_Law" id="w">Divine Law</a>) that blessed Peter should have perpetual successors in the primacy over the whole church; or that the Roman Pontiff is not the successor of blessed Peter in this primacy: let him be anathema.&#34;</p>
<p>Vatican I&#39;s Dogmatic Constitution&#39;s third chapter, &#34;On the power and character of the <a href="/wiki/Primacy_of_the_Roman_pontiff" id="w">primacy of the Roman pontiff</a>,&#34; states that (s.1) &#34;the definition of the <a href="/wiki/Ecumenical_Council" id="w">Ecumenical Council</a> of <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Florence" id="w">Florence</a>, which must be believed by all faithful <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christians</a>, namely that the apostolic see and the Roman pontiff hold a worldwide primacy, and that the Roman pontiff is the successor of blessed Peter, the prince of the apostles, true vicar of Christ, head of the whole church and father and teacher of all Christian people,&#34; that (s.2) &#34;by divine ordinance, the Roman church possesses a preeminence of ordinary power over every other church, and that the jurisdictional power of the Roman Pontiff is both episcopal and immediate&#34; and that &#34;<a href="/wiki/Clergy" id="w">clergy</a> and faithful, of whatever rite and dignity, both singly and collectively, are bound to submit to this power by the duty of <a href="/wiki/Hierarchy" id="w">hierarchical</a> subordination and true obedience, and this not only in matters concerning faith and morals, but also in those which regard the discipline and government of the church throughout the world.&#34;</p>
<p>The powers of the Pope are defined by the Dogmatic Constitution (ch.3, s.8) such that &#34;he is the supreme judge of the faithful, and that in all cases which fall under ecclesiastical jurisdiction recourse may be had to his judgment&#34; and that &#34;the sentence of the apostolic see (than which there is no higher authority) is not subject to revision by anyone, nor may anyone lawfully pass judgment thereupon&#34; (can. 331 defines the power of the Pope as &#34;supreme, full, immediate and universal ordinary power in the Church, and he can always freely exercise this power&#34;). It also dogmatically defined (ch.4, s.9) the doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Papal_infallibility" id="w">papal infallibility</a>, <i>sc.</i> such that</p>
<dl><dd>when the Roman Pontiff speaks <i><a href="/wiki/Ex_cathedra" id="w">ex cathedra</a></i>, that is, when in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole church, he possesses, by the divine assistance promised to him in blessed Peter, that <a href="/wiki/Infallibility" id="w">infallibility</a> which the divine Redeemer willed His church to enjoy in defining doctrine concerning faith or morals. Therefore, such definitions of the Roman pontiff are of themselves, and not by the consent of the church, irreformable.</dd></dl>
<p>In 1302 the <a href="/wiki/Papal_bull" id="w">papal bull</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Unam_Sanctam" id="w">Unam Sanctam</a></i> stated that &#34;it is absolutely necessary for the <a href="/wiki/Salvation" id="w">salvation</a> of every creature to be united to the Roman Pontiff&#34; (<a href="/wiki/Pope_Boniface_VIII" id="w">Pope Boniface VIII</a>). This teaching is often summarized by the phrase, <i><a href="/wiki/Extra_Ecclesiam_nulla_salus" id="w">extra Ecclesiam nulla salus</a></i> (&#34;outside the Church [exists] no salvation&#34;), which has been reaffirmed by many popes throughout the centuries. <a href="/wiki/Blessed_John_XXIII" id="w">Blessed John XXIII</a> said: &#34;Into this fold of Jesus Christ no man may enter unless he be led by the Sovereign Pontiff, and only if they be united to him can men be saved.&#34;</p>
<p>However, this dogma has been interpreted in many different ways by both Catholics and non-Catholics alike. &#34;Many who are afflicted with <a href="/wiki/Invincible_ignorance" id="w">invincible ignorance</a> with regard to our holy religion, if they carefully keep the precepts of the <a href="/wiki/Natural_Law" id="w">Natural Law</a> that have been written by God in the hearts of all men, if they are prepared to obey God, and if they lead a virtuous and dutiful life, can attain eternal life by the power of divine light and <a href="/wiki/Divine_grace" id="w">grace</a>.&#34;{{Fact}} <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II" id="w">Pope John Paul II</a> wrote in his <a href="/wiki/Encyclical" id="w">encyclical</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Redemptoris_Missio" id="w">Redemptoris Missio</a></i>: &#34;But it is clear that today, as in the past, many people do not have an opportunity to come to know or accept the Gospel revelation or to enter the Church.... For such people, salvation in Christ is accessible by virtue of a grace which, while having a mysterious relationship to the Church, does not make them formally a part of the Church but enlightens them in a way which is accommodated to their spiritual and material situation. This grace comes from Christ; it is the result of his sacrifice and is communicated by the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Spirit" id="w">Holy Spirit</a>. It enables each person to attain salvation through his or her <a href="/wiki/Synergism" id="w">free cooperation</a>.&#34;</p>
<p>Moreover, the Catholic Church teaches that all Christians are united through <a href="/wiki/Baptism" id="w">Baptism</a> and the &#34;invisible Church&#34; (body of believers). However, Christians are not fully / &#34;formally&#34; united due to divisions in beliefs etc.</p>
<p>As stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church:</p>
<p><b>817</b> In fact, &#34;in this one and only Church of God from its very beginnings there arose certain rifts, which the Apostle strongly censures as damnable. But in subsequent centuries much more serious dissensions appeared and large communities became separated from full communion with the Catholic Church- for which often enough, men of both sides were to blame&#34; (UR 3 1). The ruptures that wound the unity of Christ&#39;s Body - here we must distinguish heresy, apostasy and schism-do not occur without human sin:</p>
<dl><dd>Where there are sins, there are also divisions, schisms, heresies and disputes. Where there is virtue, however, there also are harmony and unity, from which arise the one heart and one soul of all believers (Cf. CIC, can.751.).</dd></dl>

<p><b>818</b> &#34;However, one cannot charge with the sin of the separation those who at present are born into these communities [that resulted from such separation] and in them are brought up in the faith of Christ, and the Catholic Church accepts them with respect and affection as brothers... All who have been justified by faith in Baptism are incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right to be called Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers in the Lord by the children of the Catholic Church&#34; (UR 3 1).</p>
<p><b>819</b> &#34;Furthermore, many elements of sanctification and of truth&#34; (LG 8 2) are found outside the visible confines of the Catholic Church: &#34;the written Word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope and charity, with the other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, as well as the visible elements&#34; (UR 3 2; cf. LG 15.). Christ&#39;s Spirit uses these Churches and ecclesial communities as means of salvation, whose power derives from the fullness of grace and truth that Christ has entrusted to the Catholic Church. All these blessings come from Christ and lead to Him, (Cf. UR 3.) and are in themselves calls to &#34;Catholic unity&#34; (Cf. LG 8.).</p>
<p>The pope has many powers which he exercises. He can appoint <a href="/wiki/Bishop" id="w">bishops</a> to <a href="/wiki/Diocese" id="w">dioceses</a>, erect and suppress dioceses, appoint <a href="/wiki/Prefect" id="w">prefects</a> to the Roman <a href="/wiki/Dicastery" id="w">dicasteries</a>, approve or <a href="/wiki/Veto" id="w">veto</a> their acts, modify the <a href="/wiki/Liturgy" id="w">liturgy</a> and issue liturgical laws, revise the <a href="/wiki/Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)" id="w">Code of Canon Law</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canonization" id="w">canonize</a> and <a href="/wiki/Beatification" id="w">beatify</a> individuals, approve and suppress <a href="/wiki/Religious_order" id="w">religious orders</a>, impose canonical <a href="/wiki/Sanctions" id="w">sanctions</a>, act as a judge and hear cases, issue encyclicals, and issue infallible statements on matters pertaining to faith and morals which, according to the Church, must be believed by all Catholics.  (An infallible statement regarding morals has so-far never been issued.) Most of these functions are performed by and through the various dicasteries of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Curia" id="w">Roman Curia</a>, through which the pope administers the church. The actions of the Curia are considered to be the actions of the pope himself, and he must approve their actions prior to their becoming official. While approval is generally granted, it is at the Pope&#39;s discretion.</p>

<p>Though the progressive <a href="/wiki/Christianization" id="w">Christianisation</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Roman Empire</a> in the fourth century did not confer upon bishops civil authority within the state, the gradual withdrawal of imperial authority during the fifth century left the pope the senior imperial civilian official in Rome, as bishops were increasingly directing civil affairs in other cities of the Western Empire. This status as a secular and civil ruler was vividly displayed by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Leo_I" id="w">Pope Leo I</a>&#39;s confrontation with <a href="/wiki/Attila" id="w">Attila</a> in 452. The first expansion of papal rule outside of Rome came in 728 with the <a href="/wiki/Donation_of_Sutri" id="w">Donation of Sutri</a>, which in turn was substantially increased in 754, when the <a href="/wiki/Frankish_people" id="w">Frankish</a> ruler <a href="/wiki/Pippin_the_Younger" id="w">Pippin the Younger</a> gave to the pope the land from his conquest of the <a href="/wiki/Lombards" id="w">Lombards</a>. The pope may have utilized the forged <a href="/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine" id="w">Donation of Constantine</a> to gain this land, which formed the core of the <a href="/wiki/Papal_States" id="w">Papal States</a>. This document, accepted as genuine until the 1400s, states that <a href="/wiki/Constantine_I" id="w">Constantine I</a> placed the entire Western Empire of Rome under papal rule. In 800 <a href="/wiki/Pope_Leo_III" id="w">Pope Leo III</a> <a href="/wiki/Coronation" id="w">crowned</a> the Frankish ruler <a href="/wiki/Charlemagne" id="w">Charlemagne</a> as <a href="/wiki/Roman_Emperor" id="w">Roman Emperor</a>, a major step toward establishing what later became known as the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" id="w">Holy Roman Empire</a>; from that date onward the popes claimed the prerogative to crown the Emperor, though the right fell into disuse after the coronation of <a href="/wiki/Charles_V%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Charles V</a> in 1530.  <a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_VII" id="w">Pope Pius VII</a> was present at the coronation of <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I" id="w">Napoleon I</a> in 1804, but did not actually perform the crowning. As mentioned above, the pope&#39;s sovereignty over the Papal States ended in 1870 with their annexation by <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Popes like <a href="/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI" id="w">Alexander VI</a>, an ambitious if spectacularly corrupt politician, and <a href="/wiki/Pope_Julius_II" id="w">Pope Julius II</a>, a formidable general and statesman, were not afraid to use power to achieve their own ends, which included increasing the power of the papacy. This political and temporal authority was demonstrated through the papal role in the Holy Roman Empire (especially prominent during periods of contention with the Emperors, such as during the Pontificates of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Gregory_VII" id="w">Pope Gregory VII</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pope_Alexander_III" id="w">Pope Alexander III</a>). <a href="/wiki/Papal_bull" id="w">Papal bulls</a>, <a href="/wiki/Interdict_(Roman_Catholic_Church)" id="w">interdict</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Excommunication" id="w">excommunication</a> (or the threat thereof) have been used many times to increase papal power.

<p>The Pope&#39;s claim to hold the position of Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church is recognized as <a href="/wiki/Dogma" id="w">dogmatic</a> and not considered open to debate or dispute within the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Church" id="w">Roman Church</a>. The First Vatican Council <a href="/wiki/Anathema" id="w">anathematized</a> all who dispute the pope&#39;s claims of primacy of honor and of jurisdiction. It is lawful to discuss the precise nature of that primacy, provided that such discussion does not violate the terms of the Council&#39;s Dogmatic Constitution.</p>
<p>The Pope&#39;s claim to authority is disputed outside the [Roman Church] {{Fact}}.  These objections differ from denomination to denomination, but can roughly be outlined as objections to the extent of the primacy of the pope and to the institution of the papacy itself.</p>
<p>Some Christian communities (<a href="/wiki/Assyrian_Church_of_the_East" id="w">Assyrian Church of the East</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Oriental_Orthodoxy" id="w">Oriental Orthodox Church</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" id="w">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Old_Catholic_Church" id="w">Old Catholic Church</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Anglican_Communion" id="w">Anglican Communion</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Independent_Catholic_Churches" id="w">Independent Catholic Churches</a>, some <a href="/wiki/Lutheranism" id="w">Lutherans</a>, etc.) accept the doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Apostolic_Succession" id="w">Apostolic Succession</a>, and to varying extents, Papal claims to a primacy of honour while generally rejecting that the pope is the successor to Peter in any unique sense not true of any other bishop. Primacy is regarded as a consequence of the pope&#39;s position as bishop of the original capital city of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Roman Empire</a>, a definition explicitly spelled out in the 28th <a href="/wiki/Canon_law" id="w">canon</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Chalcedon" id="w">Council of Chalcedon</a>. These churches see no foundation to papal claims of <i>universal immediate jurisdiction</i>, or to claims of <a href="/wiki/Papal_infallibility" id="w">papal infallibility</a>. Because the First Vatican Council is not recognized as authoritive by these churches, they regard its definitions concerning jurisdiction, infallibility and the associated anathematization as the opinions of the followers of the pope. Several of these communities refer to such claims as <i><a href="/wiki/Ultramontanism" id="w">ultramontanism</a></i>.</p>
<p>Some Christian denominations do not accept the doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Apostolic_Succession" id="w">Apostolic Succession</a> {{Fact}}, rejecting the claims of <a href="/wiki/Primacy_of_Simon_Peter" id="w">Petrine primacy</a> of honor, Petrine primacy of jurisdiction, and papal infallibility. The papacy&#39;s complex relationship with the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Roman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" id="w">Byzantine</a> Empires, and other secular states, and the papacy&#39;s territorial claims in Italy, are other objections, as is the <a href="/wiki/Monarch" id="w">monarchical</a> character of the office of pope.

(Cf. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.bookofconcord.com/smalcald.html#article4" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bookofconcord.com/smalcald.html#article4">Smalcald Articles, Triglot, p. 515, Paragraphs 39-41; p. 401, Paragraph 45; M. pp. 336, 258.</a>) Hence we subscribe to the statement of our Confessions that the Pope is &#34;the very Antichrist.&#34; (<a class="externallink" href="http://www.bookofconcord.com/smalcald.html#article4" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bookofconcord.com/smalcald.html#article4">Smalcald Articles, Triglot, p. 475, Paragraph 10; M., p. 308.</a>)</blockquote>

<p>Some objectors to the papacy use <a href="/wiki/Empiricism" id="w">empirical arguments</a>, pointing out that popes <a href="/wiki/Callixtus_III" id="w">Callixtus III</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI" id="w">Alexander VI</a> were so corrupt as to be unfit to wield power to bind and loose on Earth or in Heaven. An <a href="/wiki/Omniscience" id="w">omniscient</a> and <a href="/wiki/Omnibenevolent" id="w">omnibenevolent</a> God, some argue, would not have given those people the powers claimed for them by the Roman Catholic Church. Defenders of the papacy counter that the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a> shows God as willingly giving privileges even to corrupt men, citing examples like some of the kings of Israel, the apostle <a href="/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" id="w">Judas Iscariot</a>, and even Peter after he denied Jesus. They also argue that not even the worst of the corrupt popes used the office to try to rip the doctrine of the Church from its apostolic roots, and that their failure to achieve that goal is evidence that the office is divinely protected.</p>

<p>In the earlier centuries of Christianity, the title &#34;Pope,&#34; meaning &#34;father,&#34; had been used by all bishops. Some popes used the term and others didn&#39;t. Eventually, the title became associated especially with the Bishop of Rome. In a few cases, the term is used for other Christian clerical authorities. However, other religions than Christianity have a Pope - for example, Deanism.</p>

Conversely, there have been a number of popes whose reign lasted less than a month. The number of calendar days includes partial days.  Thus, for example, if a pope&#39;s reign commenced on 1 August and he died on 2 August, this would count as having reigned for two calendar days.</p>
