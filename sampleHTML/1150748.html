For this reason, he is often referred to as <i>Shaheed</i> Bhagat Singh (the word <i><a href="/wiki/Martyrdom_in_Islam" id="w">shaheed</a></i> means &#34;<a href="/wiki/Martyr" id="w">martyr</a>&#34;). He is also believed by some historians, such as <a href="/wiki/K._N._Panikkar" id="w">K. N. Panikkar</a>, to be one of the earliest <a href="/wiki/Marxism" id="w">Marxists</a> in India.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Singh was also one of the leaders and founders of the <a href="/wiki/Hindustan_Socialist_Republican_Association" id="w">Hindustan Socialist Republican Association</a> (HSRA).</p>
<p>Born to a family which had earlier been involved in <a href="/wiki/Revolutionary" id="w">revolutionary</a> activities against the <a href="/wiki/British_Raj" id="w">British Raj</a> in India, Singh, as a teenager, had studied European revolutionary movements and was attracted to <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" id="w">anarchism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">communism</a>.<sup id="_ref-RD_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RD" title="">[3]</a></sup> He became involved in numerous revolutionary organizations. He quickly rose through the ranks of the <a href="/wiki/Hindustan_Socialist_Republican_Association" id="w">Hindustan Republican Association</a> (HRA) and became one of its leaders, converting it to the HSRA. Singh gained support when he underwent a 63-day fast in jail, demanding equal rights for Indian and British political prisoners. He was hanged for shooting a police officer in response to the killing of veteran social activist <a href="/wiki/Lala_Lajpat_Rai" id="w">Lala Lajpat Rai</a>. His legacy prompted youth in India to begin fighting for Indian independence and also increased the rise of socialism in India.<sup id="_ref-whatif_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-whatif" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

He came from a patriotic <a href="/wiki/Sikh" id="w">Sikh</a> family, some of whom had had participated in movements supporting the independence of India and others who had served in <a href="/wiki/Maharaja_Ranjit_Singh_(Punjab)" id="w">Maharaja Ranjit Singh</a>&#39;s army.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> His grandfather, Sardar Kishan Singh, was a follower of <a href="/wiki/Swami_Dayananda_Saraswati" id="w">Swami Dayananda Saraswati</a>&#39;s Hindu reformist movement, <a href="/wiki/Arya_Samaj" id="w">Arya Samaj</a>,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> which would carry a heavy influence on Singh. His uncles, Ajit Singh and Swaran Singh, as well as his father were members of the <a href="/wiki/Ghadar_Party" id="w">Ghadar Party</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Kartar_Singh_Sarabha_Grewal" id="w">Kartar Singh Sarabha Grewal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Har_Dayal" id="w">Har Dayal</a>. Ajit Singh was forced to flee to <a href="/wiki/Persia" id="w">Persia</a> because of pending cases against him while Swaran Singh was hanged on <a href="/wiki/December_19" id="w">December 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1927" id="w">1927</a> for his involvement in the <a href="/wiki/Kakori_train_robbery" id="w">Kakori train robbery</a> of 1925.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike many Sikhs his age, Singh did not attend Khalsa High School in Lahore, because his grandfather did not approve of the school officials&#39; loyalism to the British authorities.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Instead, his father enrolled him in <a href="/wiki/Dayanand_Anglo-Vedic_Schools_System" id="w">Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School</a>, an Arya Samajist school.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> At age 13, Singh began to follow <a href="/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi" id="w">Mahatma Gandhi</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Non-Cooperation_Movement" id="w">Non-Cooperation Movement</a>. At this point he had openly defied the <a href="/wiki/British_Raj" id="w">British</a> and had followed Gandhi&#39;s wishes by burning his government-school books and any British-imported clothing. Following Gandhi&#39;s withdrawal of the movement after the violent murders of policemen by villagers from <a href="/wiki/Chauri_Chaura" id="w">Chauri Chaura</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh" id="w">Uttar Pradesh</a>, Singh, disgruntled with Gandhi&#39;s nonviolence action, joined the Young Revolutionary Movement and began advocating for a violence movement against the British.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1923, Bhagat famously won an essay competition set by the Punjab Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. This grabbed the attention of members of the Punjab Hindi Sahitya Sammelan including its General Secretary Professor Bhim Sen Vidyalankar. At this age, he quoted famous Punjabi literature and discussed the <i>Problems of the Punjab</i>. He read a lot of poetry and literature which was written by Punjabi writers and his favourite poet was an  Indian freedom fighter <a href="/wiki/Allama_Iqbal" id="w">Allama Iqbal</a> from <a href="/wiki/Sialkot" id="w">Sialkot</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In his teenage years, Bhagat Singh started studying at the National College in Lahore,{{fact}} but ran away from home to escape early marriage, and became a member of the organization <i>Naujawan Bharat Sabha</i> (Translated to &#39;Youth Society of India&#39;).{{fact}} In the Naujawan Bharat Sabha, Singh and his fellow revolutionaries grew popular amongst the youth. He also joined the <a href="/wiki/Hindustan__Republican_Association" id="w">Hindustan  Republican Association</a> at the request of Professor Vidyalankar, which was then headed by <a href="/wiki/Ram_Prasad_Bismil" id="w">Ram Prasad Bismil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shahid_Ashfaqallah_Khan" id="w">Ashfaqulla Khan</a>.{{fact}} It is believed that he had knowledge of the <a href="/wiki/Kakori_train_robbery" id="w">Kakori train robbery</a>.

Bhagat Singh was the secretary of the meet. His later <a href="/wiki/Revolutionary" id="w">revolutionary</a> activities were carried out as a leader of this association. The capture and hanging of the main HRA Leaders also allowed him to be quickly promoted to higher ranks in the party, along with his fellow revolutionary <a href="/wiki/Sukhdev_Thapar" id="w">Sukhdev Thapar</a>.{{fact}}</p>

<a id="Lala_Lajpat_Rai's_death_and_the_Saunders_murder" name="Lala_Lajpat_Rai's_death_and_the_Saunders_murder"></a><h3>Lala Lajpat Rai&#39;s death and the Saunders murder</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/British_government" id="w">British government</a> created a <a href="/wiki/Simon_Commission" id="w">commission</a> under <a href="/wiki/John_Simon%2C_1st_Viscount_Simon" id="w">Sir John Simon</a> to report on the current political situation in India in <a href="/wiki/1928" id="w">1928</a>. The Indian political parties boycotted the commission because it did not include a single Indian as its member and it was met with protests all over the country. When the commission visited Lahore on <a href="/wiki/October_30" id="w">October 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1928" id="w">1928</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lala_Lajpat_Rai" id="w">Lala Lajpat Rai</a> led the protest against the commission in a silent non-violent march, but the police responded with violence.{{fact}} The police chief beat Lala Lajpat Rai severely and he later succumbed to his injuries. Bhagat Singh, who was an eyewitness to this event, vowed to take revenge.{{fact}} He joined with other revolutionaries, <a href="/wiki/Shivaram_Rajguru" id="w">Shivaram Rajguru</a>, Jai Gopal and <a href="/wiki/Sukhdev_Thapar" id="w">Sukhdev Thapar</a>, in a plot to kill the police chief. Jai Gopal was supposed to identify the chief and signal for Singh to shoot. However, in a case of mistaken identity, Gopal signalled Singh on the appearance of J. P. Saunders, a Deputy Superintendent of Police. Thus, Saunders, instead of Scott, was shot. Bhagat Singh quickly left <a href="/wiki/Lahore" id="w">Lahore</a> to escape the police. To avoid recognition, he shaved his beard and cut his hair, a violation of one of the sacred tenets of <a href="/wiki/Sikhism" id="w">Sikhism</a>.</p>
<a id="Bomb_in_the_assembly" name="Bomb_in_the_assembly"></a><h3>Bomb in the assembly</h3>
<p>In the face of actions by the revolutionaries, the British government enacted the Defence of India Act to give more power to the police.{{fact}} The purpose of the Act was to combat revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh. The Act was defeated in the council by one vote.{{fact}} However, the Act was then passed under the ordinance that claimed that it was in the best interest of the public. In response to this act, the <a href="/wiki/Hindustan_Socialist_Republican_Association" id="w">Hindustan Socialist Republican Association</a> planned to explode a bomb in the assembly where the ordinance was going to be passed. Originally, Azad attempted to stop Bhagat Singh from carrying out the bombing; however, the remainder of the party forced him to succumb to Singh&#39;s wishes. It was decided that Bhagat Singh and <a href="/wiki/Batukeshwar_Dutt" id="w">Batukeshwar Dutt</a>, another revolutionary, would throw the bomb in the assembly.{{fact}}</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_8" id="w">April 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1929" id="w">1929</a>, Singh and Dutt threw a bomb onto the corridors of the assembly and shouted &#34;<i>Inquilab Zindabad!</i>&#34; (&#34;Long Live the Revolution!&#34;).{{fact}} This was followed by a shower of leaflets stating that it takes a loud voice to make the deaf hear.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The bomb neither killed nor injured anyone; Singh and Dutt claimed that this was deliberate on their part, a claim substantiated both by British <a href="/wiki/Forensics" id="w">forensics</a> investigators who found that the bomb was not powerful enough to cause injury, and by the fact that the bomb was thrown <i>away</i> from people. Singh and Dutt gave themselves up for arrest after the bomb.{{fact}} He and Dutt were sentenced to &#39;<a href="/wiki/Penal_transportation" id="w">Transportation for Life</a>&#39; for the bombing on <a href="/wiki/June_12" id="w">June 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1929" id="w">1929</a>.</p>

 after his arrest and <a href="/wiki/Trial" id="w">trial</a> for the Assembly bombing, the British came to know of his involvement in the murder of J. P. Saunders. Bhagat Singh, <a href="/wiki/Rajguru" id="w">Rajguru</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sukhdev" id="w">Sukhdev</a> were charged with the <a href="/wiki/Murder" id="w">murder</a>. Bhagat Singh decided to use the court as a tool to <a href="/wiki/Propaganda" id="w">publicize</a> his cause for the independence of India.{{fact}} He admitted to the murder and made statements against the British rule during the trial.{{fact}} The case was ordered to be carried out without members of the HSRA present at the hearing. This created an uproar amongst Singh&#39;s supporters as he could no longer publicise his views.</p>
<p>While in jail, Bhagat Singh and other prisoners launched a hunger strike advocating for the rights of prisoners and those facing trial. The reason for the strike was that British murderers and thieves were treated better than Indian political prisoners, who, by law, were meant to be given better rights. The aims in their strike were to ensure a decent standard of food for political prisoners, the availability of books and a daily newspaper, as well as better clothing and the supply of toilet necessities and other hygienic necessities. He also demanded that political prisoners should not be forced to do any labour or undignified work.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> During this hunger strike that lasted 63 days and ended with the British succumbing to his wishes, he gained much popularity among the common Indians. Before the strike his popularity was limited mainly to the <a href="/wiki/Punjab_region" id="w">Punjab region</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bhagat Singh also maintained the use of a diary, which he eventually made to fill 404 pages. In this diary he made numerous notes relating to the quotations and popular sayings of various people whose views he supported. Prominent in his diary were the views of <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" id="w">Karl Marx</a> and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Engels" id="w">Friedrich Engels</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> The comments in his diary led to an understanding of the philosophical thinking of Bhagat Singh.<sup id="_ref-jailquotes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jailquotes" title="">[17]</a></sup> Before dying he also wrote a pamphlet entitled &#34;Why I am an atheist&#34;, as he was being accused of vanity by not accepting God in the face of death.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_23" id="w">March 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1931" id="w">1931</a>, Bhagat Singh was <a href="/wiki/Hanged" id="w">hanged</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lahore" id="w">Lahore</a> with his fellow comrades Rajguru and Sukhdev. His supporters, who had been protesting against the hanging, immediately declared him as a <i>shaheed</i> or martyr.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> According to the Superintendent of Police at the time, V.N. Smith, the hanging was advanced:</p>
<p /><blockquote>Normally execution took place at 8 am, but it was decided to act at once before the public could become aware of what had happened...At about 7 pm shouts of Inquilab Zindabad were heard from inside the jail. This was correctly, interpreted as a signal that the final curtain was about to drop.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Singh was cremated at <a href="/wiki/Hussainiwala" id="w">Hussainiwala</a> on banks of <a href="/wiki/Sutlej" id="w">Sutlej</a> river.

</p><a id="Marxism" name="Marxism"></a><h3>Marxism</h3>
<p>Bhagat Singh&#39;s political thought evolved gradually from Gandhian <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" id="w">nationalism</a> to revolutionary <a href="/wiki/Marxism" id="w">Marxism</a>. By the end of 1928, he and his comrades renamed their organization the <a href="/wiki/Hindustan_Socialist_Republican_Association" id="w">Hindustan Socialist Republican Association</a>. He had read the teachings of <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" id="w">Karl Marx</a>, <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Engels" id="w">Friedrich Engels</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" id="w">Vladimir Lenin</a><sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> and believed that, with such a large and diverse population, India could only survive properly under a <a href="/wiki/Socialist" id="w">socialist</a> regime. These ideals had been introduced to him during his time at the National College at Lahore and he believed that India should re-enact the <a href="/wiki/October_Revolution" id="w">Russian revolution</a>. In the case that India were not <a href="/wiki/Socialist" id="w">socialist</a>, he believed that the rich would only get richer and the poor would only get poorer. This, and his militant methods, put him at odds with Gandhi and members of the Congress. He became the first socialist leader in India to make any gain. Even today, socialist leaders sometimes refer back to him as the founder of Indian socialism.<sup id="_ref-CPIM Surjeet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CPIM Surjeet" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CPIM Front Page_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CPIM Front Page" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Atheism" name="Atheism"></a><h3>Atheism</h3>
<p>While in a condemned cell in 1931, he wrote a pamphlet entitled <i>Why I am an Atheist</i> in which he discusses and advocates the philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Atheism" id="w">atheism</a>. This pamphlet was a result of some criticism by fellow revolutionaries on his failure to acknowledge religion and God while in a condemned cell, the accusation of <a href="/wiki/Vanity" id="w">vanity</a> was also dealt with in this pamphlet. He supported his own beliefs and claimed that he used to be a firm believer in The Almighty, but could not bring himself to believe the myths and beliefs that others held close to their hearts. In this pamphlet, he acknowledged the fact that <a href="/wiki/Religion" id="w">religion</a> made death easier, but also said that unproved <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" id="w">philosophy</a> is a sign of human weakness.<sup id="_ref-Why_I_Am_An_Atheist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Why_I_Am_An_Atheist" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>


<a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h3>Death</h3>
<p>Bhagat Singh was known for his appreciation of <a href="/wiki/Martyr" id="w">martyrdom</a>. His mentor as a young boy was <a href="/wiki/Kartar_Singh_Sarabha" id="w">Kartar Singh Sarabha</a>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Singh is himself considered a <a href="/wiki/Martyr" id="w">martyr</a> by many Indians for acting to avenge the death of <a href="/wiki/Lala_Lajpat_Rai" id="w">Lala Lajpat Rai</a>, also considered a martyr. In the leaflet he threw in the Central Assembly on 8th April 1929, he stated that <i>It is easy to kill individuals but you cannot kill the ideas. Great empires crumbled while the ideas survived</i>.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> After engaging in studies on the Russian Revolution, he wanted to die so that his death would inspire the youth of India to unite and fight the British Empire.</p>
<p>While in prison, Bhagat Singh and two others had written a letter to the Viceroy asking him to treat them as prisoners of war and hence to execute them by <a href="/wiki/Firing_squad" id="w">firing squad</a> and not by <a href="/wiki/Hanging" id="w">hanging</a>. Prannath Mehta, Bhagat Singh&#39;s friend, visited him in the jail on March 20, four days before his execution, with a draft letter for clemency, but he declined to sign it.<sup id="_ref-Frontline_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frontline" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Conspiracy_theories" name="Conspiracy_theories"></a><h2>Conspiracy theories</h2>
<p>Many <a href="/wiki/Conspiracy_theories" id="w">conspiracy theories</a> exist regarding Singh, especially the events surrounding his death. </p>
<a id="Mahatma_Gandhi" name="Mahatma_Gandhi"></a><h3>Mahatma Gandhi</h3>
<p>One of the most popular ones is that <a href="/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi" id="w">Mahatma Gandhi</a> had an opportunity to stop Singh&#39;s execution but did not. This particular theory has spread amongst the public in modern times after the creation of modern films such as <i>The Legend of Bhagat Singh</i>, which portray Gandhi as someone who was strongly at odds with Bhagat Singh and did not oppose his hanging.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> A variation on this theory is that Gandhi actively conspired with the British to have Singh executed. Both theories are highly controversial and hotly contested. Gandhi&#39;s supporters say that Gandhi did not have enough influence with the British to stop the execution, much less arrange it. Furthermore, Gandhi&#39;s supporters assert that Singh&#39;s role in the independence movement was no threat to Gandhi&#39;s role as its leader, and so Gandhi would have no reason to want him dead. </p>
<p>Gandhi, during his lifetime, always maintained that he was a great admirer of Singh&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Patriotism" id="w">patriotism</a>, but that he simply disapproved of his violent methods. He also said that he was opposed to Singh&#39;s execution (and, for that matter, <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment" id="w">capital punishment</a> in general) and proclaimed that he had no power to stop it. On Singh&#39;s execution, Gandhi said, &#34;The government certainly had the right to hang these men. However, there are some rights which do credit to those who possess them only if they are enjoyed in name only.&#34;<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Gandhi also once said, on capital punishment, &#34;I cannot in all conscience agree to anyone being sent to the gallows. God alone can take life because He alone gives it.&#34;</p>
<p>Gandhi had managed to have 90,000 political prisoners who were not members of his <a href="/wiki/Satyagraha" id="w">Satyagraha</a> movement released under the pretext of &#34;relieving political tension,&#34; in the <a href="/wiki/Gandhi-Irwin_Pact" id="w">Gandhi-Irwin Pact</a>. According to a report in the Indian magazine <i><a href="/wiki/Frontline_(magazine)" id="w">Frontline</a></i>, he did plead several times for the commutation of the death sentence of Bhagat Singh, <a href="/wiki/Rajguru" id="w">Rajguru</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sukhdev" id="w">Sukhdev</a>, including a personal visit on March 19, 1931, and in a letter to the Viceroy on the day of their execution, pleading fervently for commutation, not knowing that the letter would be too late.<sup id="_ref-Frontline_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frontline" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lord Irwin, the Viceroy, later said: </p><blockquote>
<p>As I listened to Mr. Gandhi putting the case for commutation before me, I reflected first on what significance it surely was that the apostle of non-violence should so earnestly be pleading the cause of the devotees of a creed so fundamentally opposed to his own, but I should regard it as wholly wrong to allow my judgment to be influenced by purely political considerations. I could not imagine a case in which under the law, penalty had been more directly deserved.<sup id="_ref-Frontline_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frontline" title="">[27]</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>

<a id="Saunders_family" name="Saunders_family"></a><h3>Saunders family</h3>
<p>On October 28, 2005, a book entitled <i>Some Hidden Facts: Martyrdom of Shaheed Bhagat Singh -- Secrets unfurled by an Intelligence Bureau Agent of British-India</i> [<i><a href="/wiki/Sic" id="w">sic</a></i>] by K.S. Kooner and G.S. Sindhra was released. The book asserts that Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev were deliberately hanged in such a manner as to leave all three in a semi-conscious state, so that all three could later be taken outside the prison and shot dead by the Saunders family. The book says that this was a prison operation codenamed &#34;Operation Trojan Horse.&#34; Scholars are skeptical of the book&#39;s claims.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>

To celebrate the centenary of his birth, a group of intellectuals have set up an institution to commemorate Singh and his ideals.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several popular <a href="/wiki/Bollywood" id="w">Bollywood</a> films have been made capturing the life and times of Bhagat Singh.<sup id="_ref-films_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-films" title="">[32]</a></sup> The oldest was <i>Shaheed</i> in <a href="/wiki/1965" id="w">1965</a>, starring <a href="/wiki/Manoj_Kumar" id="w">Manoj Kumar</a> as Singh. Two major films about Singh were released in <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Legend_of_Bhagat_Singh" id="w">The Legend of Bhagat Singh</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/23rd_March_1931:_Shaheed" id="w">23rd March 1931: Shaheed</a></i>. <i>The Legend of Bhagat Singh</i> is <a href="/wiki/Rajkumar_Santoshi" id="w">Rajkumar Santoshi</a>&#39;s adaptation, in which <a href="/wiki/Ajay_Devgan" id="w">Ajay Devgan</a> played Singh and <a href="/wiki/Amrita_Rao" id="w">Amrita Rao</a> was featured in a brief role. <i>23 March 1931: Shaheed</i> was directed by Guddu Dhanoa and starred <a href="/wiki/Bobby_Deol" id="w">Bobby Deol</a> as Singh, with <a href="/wiki/Sunny_Deol" id="w">Sunny Deol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aishwarya_Rai" id="w">Aishwarya Rai</a> in supporting roles.</p>

It covers a lot of Bhagat Singh&#39;s role in the Indian freedom struggle. The movie revolves around a group of college students and how they each play the roles of Bhagat&#39;s friends and family.</p>
<p>The patriotic <a href="/wiki/Urdu_language" id="w">Urdu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hindi_language" id="w">Hindi</a> songs, <i><a href="/wiki/Sarfaroshi_ki_Tamanna" id="w">Sarfaroshi ki Tamanna</a></i> (translated as &#34;the desire to sacrifice&#34;) and <i>Mera Rang De Basanti Chola</i> (&#34;my light-yellow-colored cloak&#34;; Basanti referring to the light-yellow color of the <a href="/wiki/Mustard_plant" id="w">Mustard flower</a> grown in the Punjab and also one of the two main colors of the Sikh religion as per the Sikh <i>rehat meryada</i>(code of conduct of the Sikh Saint-Soldier) ), while created by <a href="/wiki/Ram_Prasad_Bismil" id="w">Ram Prasad Bismil</a>, are largely associated to Bhagat Singh&#39;s martyrdom and have been used in a number of Bhagat Singh-related films.<sup id="_ref-films_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-films" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>In September 2007 the governor of Pakistan&#39;s Punjab province announced that a memorial to Bhagat Singh will be displayed at Lahore museum, according to the governor “Singh was the first martyr of the subcontinent and his example was followed by many youth of the time.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Criticism" name="Criticism"></a><h2>Criticism</h2>
<p>Bhagat Singh was criticized both by his contemporaries and by people after his death because of his violent and revolutionary stance towards the British opposed to the <a href="/wiki/Pacifism" id="w">pacifist</a> stance taken by the <a href="/wiki/Indian_National_Congress" id="w">Indian National Congress</a> and particularly <a href="/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi" id="w">Mahatma Gandhi</a>.<sup id="_ref-Sukhdevletter_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sukhdevletter" title="">[35]</a></sup> The methods he used to make his point&#8212;shooting Saunders and throwing non-lethal bombs&#8212;were quite different to the non-violent <a href="/wiki/Gandhism" id="w">non-cooperation</a> used by Gandhi.<sup id="_ref-Sukhdevletter_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sukhdevletter" title="">[35]</a></sup> He was accused of having knowledge of the <a href="/wiki/Kakori_train_robbery" id="w">Kakori train robbery</a> by the British.<sup id="_ref-Why_I_Am_An_Atheist_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Why_I_Am_An_Atheist" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bhagat Singh has also been accused of being too eager to die, as opposed to staying alive and continuing his movement. It has been alleged that he could have escaped from prison if he so wished, but he preferred that he die and become a legacy for other <a href="/wiki/Youth" id="w">youths</a> in India. Some lament that he may have done much more for India had he stayed alive.<sup id="_ref-whatif_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-whatif" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<li><i>&#34;The aim of life is no more to control the mind, but to develop it harmoniously; not to achieve salvation here after, but to make the best use of it here below; and not to realise truth, beauty and good only in contemplation, but also in the actual experience of daily life; social progress depends not upon the ennoblement of the few but on the enrichment of democracy; universal brotherhood can be achieved only when there is an equality of opportunity - of opportunity in the social, political and individual life.&#34;</i> &#8212; from Bhagat Singh&#39;s prison diary, p. 124</li></ul></dd></dl>
