<p>The <b><a href="/wiki/Republic_Aviation" id="w">Republic</a> F-84 Thunderjet</b> was an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a>-built <a href="/wiki/Turbojet" id="w">turbojet</a> fighter-bomber aircraft. Originating as a 1944 <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" id="w">United States Air Force</a> proposal for a daytime fighter, the F-84 flew in 1946. Although it entered service in 1947, the Thunderjet was plagued by so many structural and engine problems that a 1948 Air Force review declared it unable to execute any aspect of its intended mission and considered cancelling the program. The aircraft was not considered fully operational until the 1949 F-84D model and the design matured only with the definitive F-84G introduced in 1951. In 1954, the straight-wing Thunderjet was joined by the swept-wing <b><a href="/wiki/F-84F_Thunderstreak" id="w">F-84F Thunderstreak</a></b> fighter and <b>RF-84F Thunderflash</b> <a href="/wiki/Photo_reconnaissance" id="w">photo reconnaissance</a> aircraft.</p>
<p>The Thunderjet became the Air Force&#39;s primary strike aircraft during the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" id="w">Korean War</a>, flying 86,408 missions and destroying 60% of all ground targets in the war as well as eight Soviet-built <a href="/wiki/Mikoyan" id="w">MiG fighters</a>. Over half of the 7,524 F-84s produced served with <a href="/wiki/NATO" id="w">NATO</a> nations, and it was the first aircraft to fly with the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Air_Force_Thunderbirds" id="w">U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds</a> demonstration team. The <a href="/wiki/USAF" id="w">USAF</a> <a href="/wiki/Strategic_Air_Command" id="w">Strategic Air Command</a> had F-84 Thunderjets in service from 1948 through 1957. </p>
<p>The F-84 was the first production fighter aircraft to utilize in-flight refueling and the first fighter capable of carrying a nuclear bomb. Modified F-84s were used in several unusual projects, including the <a href="/wiki/FICON_project" id="w">FICON and Tom-Tom</a> dockings to the <a href="/wiki/B-29_Superfortress" id="w">B-29</a> and <a href="/wiki/Convair_B-36" id="w">B-36</a> bomber motherships, and the experimental <a href="/wiki/XF-84H_Thunderscreech" id="w">XF-84H Thunderscreech</a> supersonic <a href="/wiki/Turboprop" id="w">turboprop</a>. </p>

In <a href="/wiki/1944_in_aviation" id="w">1944</a>, <a href="/wiki/Republic_Aviation" id="w">Republic Aviation</a>&#39;s chief designer, <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Kartveli" id="w">Alexander Kartveli</a>, began working on a <a href="/wiki/Turbojet" id="w">turbojet</a>-powered replacement for the <a href="/wiki/P-47_Thunderbolt" id="w">P-47 Thunderbolt</a> piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early <a href="/wiki/Centrifugal_compressor" id="w">centrifugal compressor</a> turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a brand-new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an <a href="/wiki/Axial_compressor" id="w">axial compressor</a> <a href="/wiki/Turbojet" id="w">turbojet</a> engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.<sup id="_ref-knaack_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/11_September" id="w">11 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces" id="w">United States Army Air Forces</a> released General Operational Requirements for a day fighter with a top speed of 600&#160;<a href="/wiki/Mph" id="w">mph</a> (521&#160;<a href="/wiki/Knot_(speed)" id="w">knots</a>, 966&#160;km/h), combat radius of 705&#160;<a href="/wiki/Mile" id="w">miles</a> (612&#160;<a href="/wiki/Nautical_mile" id="w">nmi</a>, 1,135&#160;km), and armament of either six 0.50&#160;<a href="/wiki/Inch" id="w">inch</a> (12.7&#160;mm) or four 0.60&#160;inch (15.2&#160;mm) machine guns. In addition, the new aircraft had to use the <a href="/wiki/General_Electric" id="w">General Electric</a> TG-180 axial turbojet which entered production as <a href="/wiki/Allison_J35" id="w">Allison J35</a>. On <a href="/wiki/11_November" id="w">11 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>, Republic received an order for three prototypes of the new <b>XP-84</b>.<sup id="_ref-knaack_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Since the design promised superior performance to the <a href="/wiki/P-80_Shooting_Star" id="w">P-80 Shooting Star</a> and Republic had extensive experience in building single-seat fighters, no competition was held for the contract. The name <b>Thunderjet</b> was chosen to continue the Republic Aviation tradition started with the P-47 while emphasizing the new method of propulsion. On <a href="/wiki/4_January" id="w">4 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>, even before the aircraft took to the air, the USAAF expanded its order to 25 service test <b>YP-84A</b> and 75 production <b>P-84B</b> (later modified to 15 YP-84A and 85 P-84B). Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Wind_tunnel" id="w">wind tunnel</a> testing by the <a href="/wiki/National_Advisory_Committee_for_Aeronautics" id="w">National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics</a> revealed longitudinal instability and buckling of stabilizer skin at high speeds.<sup id="_ref-knaack_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup> The weight of the aircraft, a great concern given the low thrust of early turbojets, was growing so quickly that the USAAF had to set a gross weight limit of 13,400&#160;<a href="/wiki/Pound_(mass)" id="w">pounds</a> (6,080&#160;kg). The results of preliminary testing were incorporated into the third prototype, designated <b>XP-84A</b>, which was also fitted with a more powerful J35-GE-15 engine with 4,000&#160;<a href="/wiki/Pound-force" id="w">pound-force</a> (17.8&#160;kN) of thrust.<sup id="_ref-knaack_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first prototype XP-84 was transferred to Muroc Army Air Field (present-day <a href="/wiki/Edwards_Air_Force_Base" id="w">Edwards Air Force Base</a>) where it flew for the first time on <a href="/wiki/28_February" id="w">28 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1946_in_aviation" id="w">1946</a> with Major <a href="/wiki/William_A._Lien" id="w">William A. Lien</a> at the controls. It was joined by the second prototype in August; both aircraft flying with J35-GE-7 engines producing 3,745&#160;pound-force (16.66&#160;kN) of thrust. The fifteen YP-84As delivered to Patterson Field (present-day <a href="/wiki/Wright-Patterson_Air_Force_Base" id="w">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a>) for service tests differed from XP-84s in having an upgraded J35-A-15 engine, carrying six 0.50&#160;inch (12.7&#160;mm) <a href="/wiki/M2_Browning_machine_gun" id="w">Browning machine guns</a> (four in the nose and one in each wing root), and having the provision for wingtip fuel tanks holding 226&#160;US&#160;<a href="/wiki/Gallon" id="w">gallon</a> (870&#160;L) each. Due to delays with delivery of jet engines and production of the XP-84A, the Thunderjet had undergone only limited flight testing by the time production P-84Bs began to roll out of the factory in 1947. In particular, the impact of wingtip tanks on aircraft handling was not thoroughly studied which proved problematic later.<sup id="_ref-knaack_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>After creation of <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" id="w">United States Air Force</a> by the <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Act_of_1947" id="w">National Security Act of 1947</a>, the <i>Pursuit</i> designation was replaced with <i>Fighter</i>, and P-84 became the <b>F-84</b>.</p>
<p>F-84s were assigned to the <a href="/wiki/27th_Fighter_Wing" id="w">27th Fighter Wing</a>,  27th Fighter Escort Wing, 27th Strategic Fighter Wing, 31st Fighter Escort Wing, 127th Fighter Day Wing, 127th Fighter Escort Wing,  127th  
Strategic Fighter Wing, 407th Strategic Fighter Wing and the 506th Strategic Fighter Wing of the <a href="/wiki/Strategic_Air_Command" id="w">Strategic Air Command</a> from 1947 through 1958.<sup id="_ref-McLaren_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McLaren" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Operational_history" name="Operational_history"></a><h2>Operational history</h2>

<p>The F-84B, which differed from YP-84A only in having faster-firing M3 machine guns, became operational with <a href="/wiki/14th_Fighter_Group" id="w">14th Fighter Group</a> at <a href="/wiki/Dow_Field" id="w">Dow Field</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bangor%2C_Maine" id="w">Bangor, Maine</a> in December 1947. Flight restrictions followed immediately, limiting maximum speed to <a href="/wiki/Mach_number" id="w">Mach&#160;0.8</a> due to control reversal, and limiting maximum acceleration to 5.5&#160;<a href="/wiki/G_force" id="w">&#39;&#39;g&#39;&#39;</a> (54 m/s²) due to wrinkling of fuselage skin. To compound the problem, parts shortages and maintenance difficulties earned the aircraft the nickname &#34;Mechanic&#39;s Nightmare&#34;.<sup id="_ref-knaack_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/24_May" id="w">24 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1948" id="w">1948</a>, the entire F-84B fleet was grounded due to structural failures. </p>
<p>A 1948 review of the entire F-84 program discovered that none of the F-84B or F-84C aircraft could be considered operational or capable of executing any aspect of their intended mission. The program was saved from cancellation by the fact that the F-84D, whose production was well underway, had satisfactorily addressed the major faults. A fly-off against the F-80 revealed that while the Shooting Star had a shorter takeoff roll, better low altitude climb rate and superior maneuverability, the F-84 could carry a greater warload, was faster, had better high altitude performance and greater range.<sup id="_ref-knaack_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup> As a temporizing measure, the USAF in 1949, committed US$8 million to implement over 100 upgrades to all F-84Bs, most notably reinforcing the wings. Despite the resultant improvements, the F-84B was withdrawn from active duty by 1952.<sup id="_ref-knaack_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <b>F-84C</b> utilized a somewhat more reliable J35-A-13 engine and some engineering refinements. Being virtually identical to the F-84B, the C model suffered from all of the same defects and underwent a similar structural upgrade program in 1949. All F-84Cs were withdrawn from active service by 1952.<sup id="_ref-knaack_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The structural improvements were factory-implemented in the <b>F-84D</b> which entered service in 1949. Wings were covered with thicker aluminum skin, the fuel system was winterized and capable of using <a href="/wiki/JP-4" id="w">JP-4</a> fuel and a more powerful J35-A-17 engine with 5,000&#160;pound-force (22.2&#160;kN)  thrust was fitted. It was discovered that the untested wingtip fuel tanks contributed to wing structural failures by inducing excessive twisting during high-<i>g</i> maneuvers.<sup id="_ref-knaack_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup> To correct this, small triangular fins were added to the outside of the tanks. The F-84D was phased out of USAF service in 1952 and left <a href="/wiki/Air_National_Guard" id="w">Air National Guard</a> service in 1957.<sup id="_ref-knaack_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first effective and fully-capable Thunderjet was the <b>F-84E</b> model which entered service in 1949. The aircraft featured the J35-A-17 engine, further wing reinforcement, a 12&#160;inch (305&#160;mm) fuselage plug in front of the wings and 3&#160;inch (76 mm) plug aft of the wings to enlarge the cockpit and the avionics bay, an A-1C gunsight with APG-30 radar and provision for an additional pair of 230&#160;<a href="/wiki/US_gallon" id="w">US gallon</a> (870&#160;L) fuel tanks to be carried on underwing pylons.<sup id="_ref-knaack_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup> The latter increased the combat radius from 850 to 1,000&#160;miles (740 to 870&#160;nmi, 1,370 to 1,610&#160;km). Despite the improvements, the in-service rates remained poor with less than half of the aircraft operational at any given time.<sup id="_ref-knaack_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup> This was primarily due to severe shortage of spares for the Allison engines. The expectation was that F-84Es would fly 25 hours per month, accumulating 100 hours between engine overhauls. The reality of Korean War and <a href="/wiki/NATO" id="w">NATO</a> deployments rapidly outpaced the supply and Allison&#39;s ability to manufacture new engines.<sup id="_ref-knaack_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup> The F-84E was withdrawn from USAF service in 1956, lingering with ANG units until 1959.</p>
<p>The definitive straight-wing F-84 was the <b>F-84G</b> which entered service in 1951. The aircraft introduced a refueling boom receptacle in the left wing, <a href="/wiki/Autopilot" id="w">autopilot</a>, <a href="/wiki/Instrument_Landing_System" id="w">Instrument Landing System</a>, J35-A-29 engine with 5,560&#160;pound-force (24.7&#160;kN) of thrust, and the ability to carry a single <a href="/wiki/Mark_7_nuclear_bomb" id="w">Mark 7 nuclear bomb</a>.<sup id="_ref-knaack_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup> The F-84G was retired from USAF in the mid-1960s.</p>
<a id="Flying_the_Thunderjet" name="Flying_the_Thunderjet"></a><h3>Flying the Thunderjet</h3>
<p>Typical of most early jets, the Thunderjet&#39;s takeoff performance left much to be desired. In hot Korean summers with a full combat load, the aircraft routinely required 10,000&#160;feet (3,000&#160;m) of runway for takeoff even with the help of <a href="/wiki/JATO" id="w">RATO</a> bottles (two or four of these were carried, each producing 1,000&#160;pound-force (4.4&#160;kN) of thrust for 14 seconds).<sup id="_ref-knaack_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup> All but the lead aircraft had their visibility obscured by the thick smoke from the rockets. Early F-84s had to be pulled off the ground at 140&#160;knots (160&#160;mph, 260&#160;km/h) with the control stick held in the rearmost position. Landings happened at a similar speed (for comparison, the <a href="/wiki/P-51_Mustang" id="w">P-51 Mustang</a> landed at approximately 100&#160;knots (120&#160;mph, 190&#160;km/h)). Despite the &#34;hot&#34; landing speeds, the Thunderjet was easy to fly on instruments and crosswinds did not present much of a problem.<sup id="_ref-Higham_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Higham" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thanks to the thick straight wing, the Thunderjet, which was otherwise blessed with good aerodynamics, rapidly reached its <a href="/wiki/Mach_number" id="w">Mach</a> 0.82 limitation at full throttle and low altitude. The aircraft had sufficient power to fly faster but exceeding the Mach limit at low altitudes resulted in a violent pitch-up and structural failure causing the wings to break off.<sup id="_ref-Higham_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Higham" title="">[3]</a></sup> Above 15,000&#160;feet (4,600&#160;m), the F-84 could be flown faster but at the expense of severe buffeting. Fortunately, the airspeed was sufficiently easy control to make safe dive bombing from 10,000&#160;<a href="/wiki/Foot_(unit_of_length)" id="w">feet</a> (3,000&#160;m) possible.<sup id="_ref-Higham_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Higham" title="">[3]</a></sup> The top speed limitation proved troublesome against Soviet <a href="/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15" id="w">Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s</a> in Korea. Slower than the MiG, the F-84 was also unable to turn tightly with a maximum instantaneous-turn load of only 3&#160;Gs followed by rapid loss of airspeed. One F-84E pilot credited with two MiG kills achieved his second victory by intentionally flying his aircraft into pitch-up.<sup id="_ref-Higham_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Higham" title="">[3]</a></sup> The MiGs chasing him were unable to follow the violent maneuver and one crashed into the ground. Luckily for the pilot, the aircraft did not disintegrate but the airframe did suffer heavy warping. The F-84 was a stable gun platform and the computing gunsight aided in accurate gunnery and bombing. Pilots praised the aircraft for Republic&#39;s legendary ruggedness.<sup id="_ref-Higham_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Higham" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pilots nicknamed the Thunderjet &#34;The Lead Sled.&#34;<sup id="_ref-McLaren_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McLaren" title="">[2]</a></sup> It was also called &#34;The Iron Crowbar,&#34; &#34;a hole sucking air,&#34; &#34;The Hog &#34; (&#34;The Groundhog&#34;), and &#34;The World&#39;s Fastest Tricycle&#34; as a testament to its long takeoff rolls.<sup id="_ref-McLaren_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McLaren" title="">[2]</a></sup>  F-84 lore stated that all aircraft were equipped with a &#34;sniffer&#34; device that, upon passing <a href="/wiki/V_speeds" id="w">&#39;&#39;V&#39;&#39;&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;</a>, would look for the dirt at the end of the runway. As soon as the device could smell the dirt, the controls would turn on and let the pilot fly off the ground. In the same vein, it was suggested a bag of dirt should be carried in the front landing gear well. Upon reaching <i>V</i><sub>2</sub>, the pilot would dump the dirt under the wheels, fooling the sniffer device.<sup id="_ref-McLaren_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McLaren" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Korean_War" name="Korean_War"></a><h3>Korean War</h3>
<p>The Thunderjet had a distinguished record during the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" id="w">Korean War</a>. Although the F-84B and F-84C could not be deployed because their J35 engines had a service life of only 40&#160;hours, the F-84D and F-84E entered combat with <a href="/wiki/27th_Fighter_Escort_Group" id="w">27th Fighter Escort Group</a> on <a href="/wiki/7_December" id="w">7 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1950_in_aviation" id="w">1950</a>.<sup id="_ref-knaack_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knaack" title="">[1]</a></sup> The aircraft were initially tasked with escorting the <a href="/wiki/B-29_Superfortress" id="w">B-29 Superfortress</a> bombers. The first Thunderjet air-to-air victory was scored on <a href="/wiki/21_January" id="w">21 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1951_in_aviation" id="w">1951</a> at the cost of two F-84s.<sup id="_ref-McLaren_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McLaren" title="">[2]</a></sup> The F-84 was a generation behind the swept-wing Soviet <a href="/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15" id="w">Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15</a> and outmatched, especially when the MiGs were flown by Soviet pilots, and the MiG counter-air mission was soon given to the <a href="/wiki/F-86_Sabre" id="w">F-86 Sabre</a>. Like its famous predecessor, the P-47, the F-84 switched to the low-level interdiction role at which it excelled. </p>
<p>The F-84 flew a total of 86,408&#160;missions, dropping 111,171,000&#160;pounds (50,427&#160;<a href="/wiki/Metric_ton" id="w">metric tons</a>) of bombs and 12,258,000&#160;pounds (5,560&#160;metric tons) of <a href="/wiki/Napalm" id="w">napalm</a>.<sup id="_ref-McLaren_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McLaren" title="">[2]</a></sup> The USAF claimed F-84s were responsible for 60&#160;percent of all ground targets destroyed in the war.
