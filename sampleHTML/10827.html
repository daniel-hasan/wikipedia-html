<dl><dd><i>For the comedic team, see <a href="/wiki/The_Film_Crew" id="w">The Film Crew</a>.</i></dd></dl>
<p>A <b>film crew</b> is a group of people hired by a film company for the purpose of producing a <a href="/wiki/Film" id="w">film</a> or motion picture. <i>Crew</i> are distinguished from <i>cast</i>, the <a href="/wiki/Actor" id="w">actors</a> who appear in front of the <a href="/wiki/Camera" id="w">camera</a> or provide voices for characters in the film.  <i>Crew</i> are also separate from <i>producers</i>, those who own a portion of either the film company or the film&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property_rights" id="w">intellectual property rights</a>.
A film crew is divided into different departments, each of which specializes in a specific aspect of the production.</p>
<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h1> Production </h1>
<p>“Production” is generally not considered a department as such, but rather as a series of functional groups. These include the &#34;front office&#34; staff such as the Production Manager, the Production Coordinator, and their assistants; the accounting staff; the various Assistant Directors; and sometimes the Locations Manager and his or her assistants. The Director is considered to be a separate entity, not within the departmental structure.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Film_producer" id="w">Producer</a></b></li></ul><dl><dd>A <b>film producer</b> creates the conditions for making <a href="/wiki/Film" id="w">movies</a>. The producer initiates, coordinates, supervises and controls matters such as raising funding, hiring key personnel, and arranging for distributors. The producer is involved throughout <b>all</b> phases of the filmmaking process from <a href="/wiki/Filmmaking" id="w">development</a> to completion of a project.</dd></dl>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Production_manager" id="w">Production Manager</a></b></li></ul><dl><dd>The <b>production manager</b> supervises the physical aspects of the production (not the creative aspects) including personnel, technology, budget, and scheduling. It is the production manager&#39;s responsibility to make sure the filming stays on schedule and within its budget. The PM also helps manage the day-to-day budget by managing operating costs such as salaries, production costs, and everyday equipment rental costs. The PM often works under the supervision of a <a href="/wiki/Line_producer" id="w">line producer</a> and directly supervises the Production Coordinator.</dd></dl>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Unit_Manager" id="w">Unit Manager</a></b></li></ul><dl><dd>The <b>unit manager</b> fulfills the same role as the production manager but for secondary &#34;unit&#34; shooting. In some functional structures, the unit manager subsumes the role of the Transport Coordinator.</dd></dl>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Production_coordinator" id="w">Production Coordinator</a></b></li></ul><dl><dd>The <b>Production Coordinator</b> is the information nexus of the production, responsible  for organizing all the logistics from hiring crew, renting equipment, and booking talent. The PC is an integral part of film production.</dd></dl>

<ul>
<li><b>Post-production supervisor</b></li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Film_director" id="w">Director</a></b></li></ul><dl><dd>The <b>director</b> is responsible for overseeing the creative aspects of a film, including controlling the content and flow of the film&#39;s plot, directing the performances of actors, organizing and selecting the locations in which the film will be shot, and managing technical details such as the positioning of cameras, the use of lighting, and the timing and content of the film&#39;s soundtrack.  Though the director wields a great deal of power, he or she is ultimately subordinate to the film&#39;s producer or producers.  Some directors, especially more established ones, take on many of the roles of a producer, and the distinction between the two roles is sometimes blurred.</dd></dl>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Assistant_director" id="w">First Assistant Director</a></b></li></ul><dl><dd>The <b>first assistant director</b> (1st AD) assists the production manager and director. The ultimate aim of any 1st AD is to ensure the film comes in on schedule while maintaining a working environment in which the director, principal artists (actors) and crew can be focussed on their work. He or she is in charge of overseeing the day-to-day management of the cast and crew scheduling, equipment, script, and set.  A 1st AD may also be responsible for directing background action for major shots or the entirety of relatively minor shots, at the director&#39;s discretion.</dd></dl>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Assistant_director" id="w">Second Assistant Director</a></b></li></ul><dl><dd>The <b>second assistant director</b> (2nd AD) is the chief assistant of the 1st AD and helps carry out those tasks delegated to the 1st AD.  The 2nd AD may also direct background action and <a href="/wiki/Extra_(drama)" id="w">extras</a> in addition to helping the 1st AD with scheduling, booking, etc. The 2nd AD is responsible for creating Call Sheets that let the crew know the schedule and important details about the shooting day.  In Canadian and British functional structures there are 3rd ADs and even Trainee ADs; in the American system there are 2nd 2nd ADs.</dd></dl>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Production_assistant" id="w">Production Assistant</a></b></li></ul><dl><dd>A <b>production assistant</b> assists the first assistant director with set operations. Production assistants, almost always referred to as PAs, also assist in the production office with general tasks.</dd></dl>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Script_Supervisor" id="w">Script Supervisor</a></b></li></ul><dl><dd>Also known as the &#34;continuity person&#34;, the script supervisor keeps track of what parts of the script have been filmed and makes notes of any deviations between what was actually filmed and what appeared in the script. He or she makes notes on every shot, also keeping track of props, blocking, and other details to ensure that continuity is maintained from shot to shot, and from scene to scene.  The Script Supervisor&#39;s notes are given to the Editor to expedite the editing process.  The script supervisor works very closely with the director on set.</dd></dl>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Production_accountant" id="w">Production Accountant</a></b></li></ul><dl><dd>The production accountant assists the production manager and line producer in keeping track of the film&#39;s budget. The production accountant, together with his or her various assistants, are often considered to be a separate department.</dd></dl>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Location_Manager" id="w">Location Manager</a></b></li></ul><dl><dd>The location manager researches, locates, secures and coordinates the filming locations. He/she creates a location breakdown, identifying the precise locations needed and works hand-in-hand with the <a href="/wiki/Film_director" id="w">director</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Production_designer" id="w">production designer</a></dd></dl>
<p>It has become increasingly more common for productions to approach film commissions before employing a location manager to help source film locations.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Publicist" id="w">Publicist</a></b></li></ul><dl><dd>The publicist handles the <a href="/wiki/Publicity" id="w">publicity</a> of a film.  He promotes the film by issuing press releases and overseeing advertisements.</dd></dl>

It is the responsibility of the loader to manage the inventory of film and communicate with the 1st AC on the film usage and remaining stock throughout the day.
