A <b>handicap</b> in <a href="/wiki/Chess" id="w">chess</a> is a way to equal the chances for players of differing strengths.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> There are many kinds of such handicaps:  Material handicaps, move handicaps, time handicaps, etc. Handicaps were quite popular in 18th and 19th centuries, when chess was often played for money stakes; a weaker player wouldn&#39;t agree to a match without a handicap.  However, in modern times playing with handicaps is much less common.</p>
<a id="Standard_handicap_system" name="Standard_handicap_system"></a><h2> Standard handicap system </h2>

<p>The following system was used by chess players in 18th and 19th centuries when playing for money stakes (in increasing handicap level; the stronger player gets white unless otherwise indicated):</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Move</b>:  Weaker player gets white.</li>
<li><b>Two moves</b>:  Weaker player gets white and starts the game by making two moves.</li>
<li><b>Pawn and move</b>:  Weaker player gets white and the black <a href="/wiki/Pawn_(chess)" id="w">pawn</a> on f7 is removed from the board.</li>
<li><b>Knight odds</b>:  Stronger player plays without a <a href="/wiki/Knight_(chess)" id="w">knight</a>. Usually this is the queen&#39;s knight on b1.</li>
<li><b>Rook odds</b>:  Stronger player plays without a <a href="/wiki/Rook_(chess)" id="w">rook</a>. Usually this is the queen&#39;s rook on a1, with the white pawn on a2 being moved to a3.</li>
<li><b>Queen odds</b>:  Stronger player plays without the <a href="/wiki/Queen_(chess)" id="w">queen</a>.</li></ul>
<p>In modern times, <a href="/wiki/Bobby_Fischer" id="w">Bobby Fischer</a> once claimed that he could give knight odds to any woman player in the world and still win <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>, but never demonstrated this. In 2001, London businessman Terence Chapman played a match against former world champion <a href="/wiki/Garry_Kasparov" id="w">Garry Kasparov</a> with Kasparov giving odds of two pawns in each game (the pawns to be removed being different each time); Kasparov won the match by two games to one, with one drawn.</p>
<a id="Time_handicap" name="Time_handicap"></a><h2> Time handicap </h2>

<p>Time handicaps are most often practiced in <a href="/wiki/Blitz_chess" id="w">blitz</a> games.  The stronger player gets less time.  For example, the stronger player might get 2 minutes per game with the weaker player getting 5 minutes.</p>
<a id="Other_forms_of_handicap" name="Other_forms_of_handicap"></a><h2> Other forms of handicap </h2>
<p>In 16th-19th centuries sometimes <b>pion coiffé</b> (or <i>capped pawn</i>) handicap was used, usually for players of significantly different playing strength. The stronger player has to make the mating move with a particular pawn, which is usually marked at the start of play. It is required that the pawn is not promoted. <a href="/wiki/Pietro_Carrera" id="w">Pietro Carrera</a> proved that in the <a href="/wiki/Endgame" id="w">endgame</a> king, queen and pawn versus king (pion coiffé), a win can be forced unless the pawn lies on a central file. Carrera considered pion coiffé to be about equivalent of giving odds of a queen.</p>
<p>There are other forms of handicap, which however are very rarely used:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Draw odds</b>: a draw is considered as a win for the weaker player.</li>
<li>The stronger player plays the start of the game, for example the first 10-20 moves, <a href="/wiki/Blindfold_chess" id="w">blindfold</a> (without sight of the board).  More commonly, the stronger player plays the whole game this way.</li>
<li>The weaker player can take back any sequence of 3 moves in the course of game, but can only do so two times.</li>
<li>Handicap combinations are used as well.</li></ul>
