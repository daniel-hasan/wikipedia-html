Expedition Everest is often compared to the <a href="/wiki/1959" id="w">1959</a> <a href="/wiki/Matterhorn_Bobsleds" id="w">Matterhorn Bobsleds</a> roller coaster at <a href="/wiki/Disneyland" id="w">Disneyland</a>, which also features a snowy mountain setting and an &#34;abominable snowman&#34; figure throughout the ride.</p>
<p>Although moderate in height and length by contemporary roller coaster standards, Expedition Everest is unique for having its trains travel forward and backward as a result of the yeti&#39;s interference with the journey.  This is accomplished through two sets of rotating track segments on pivot before and after the backwards segment.  In its publicity material, Disney pointedly has described the attraction as a <i>family</i> thrill ride.</p>
<p>Expedition Everest is the tallest of the artificial mountains at Walt Disney World Resort, joining <a href="/wiki/Big_Thunder_Mountain_Railroad" id="w">Big Thunder Mountain Railroad</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mount_Gushmore" id="w">Mount Gushmore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Space_Mountain_(Magic_Kingdom)" id="w">Space Mountain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Splash_Mountain" id="w">Splash Mountain</a> and Mount Mayday on the list of Disney-built peaks.  According to <a href="/wiki/Walt_Disney_Imagineering" id="w">Imagineering</a>, it is Disney&#39;s 18th mountain-themed attraction. If the Expedition Everest mountain were real, it would be ranked fourth on the list of the <a class="externallink" href="http://americasroof.com/highest/fl.shtml" rel="nofollow" title="http://americasroof.com/highest/fl.shtml">highest summits in Florida</a> at 320 feet above sea level. </p>
<p>The artificial mountain is not a reproduction of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Everest" id="w">Mount Everest</a>; it is the fictional &#34;forbidden mountain&#34; guarded by the <a href="/wiki/Yeti" id="w">yeti</a> in the attraction story created by <a href="/wiki/Walt_Disney_Imagineering" id="w">Walt Disney Imagineering</a>.  Everest is represented by the barren background peak on the far right, which is meant to suggest it is far in the distance (an example of <a href="/wiki/Forced_perspective" id="w">forced perspective</a>).  The attraction&#39;s conceit is that the roller coaster is a passenger train offering a speedy route through the <a href="/wiki/Himalayas" id="w">Himalayas</a> to the base of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Everest" id="w">Mount Everest</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" id="w">Disney</a>, the attraction occupies 6.2 <a href="/wiki/Acre" id="w">acres</a> in the park&#39;s Asia section and the mountain itself is just shy of one acre.</p>
<p>Expedition Everest celebrated its grand opening on <a href="/wiki/April_7" id="w">April 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> in ceremonies led by Disney CEO <a href="/wiki/Bob_Iger" id="w">Bob Iger</a> and theme parks chairman <a href="/wiki/Jay_Rasulo" id="w">Jay Rasulo</a>. The attraction first was announced publicly on <a href="/wiki/April_22" id="w">April 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>, during an event to celebrate the fifth anniversary of <a href="/wiki/Disney%26%2339%3Bs_Animal_Kingdom" id="w">Disney&#39;s Animal Kingdom</a>.</p>
<a id="Story" name="Story"></a><h2>Story</h2>
<p>Walt Disney Imagineering spent six years researching, designing and building Expedition Everest, including many trips to the <a href="/wiki/Himalayas" id="w">Himalayas</a> to collect reference material and observations. The resulting attraction is a fictionalized telling of the legend of the yeti, using an imaginary setting created with meticulous re-creations of Himalayan architecture, art and cultural traditions.</p>
<p>Riders approach the attraction through the remote village of Serka Zong in the fictional kingdom of Anandapur, which is located in the foothills of the Himalayas. Several village buildings that had been used by the Royal Anandapur Tea Company have been repurposed by businesses that send trekkers on various expeditions throughout the Himalayas. &#34;Expedition Everest&#34; is the name of a specific trek arranged by the Himalayan Escapes tour company in Serka Zong. </p>
<p>The entrepreneurs behind Himalayan Escapes, Norbu and Bob, have refurbished a steam train that previously had been used to bring harvested tea leaves down from the mountains. It&#39;s these trains the Expedition Everest trekkers board on their way to the base camp of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Everest" id="w">Mount Everest</a>, using a shortcut that passes through the &#34;forbidden mountain&#34; thought to be guarded by the yeti. Among local cultures, the yeti is believed to be a fierce protector of the region&#39;s most pristine mountains, valleys and forests, and violently opposes man&#39;s encroachment in these areas.</p>
<p>As riders wind their way through the attraction&#39;s richly detailed standby queue, half of which is climate controlled, the legend of the yeti is communicated vividly through a <a href="/wiki/Mandir" id="w">mandir</a>, a kind of Himalayan shrine to the yeti, and a makeshift museum that documents yeti sightings, its significance in Himalayan cultures and a so-called &#34;lost&#34; expedition that ran afoul of the creature in 1982 while attempting to reach Everest through the Forbidden Mountain pass. Near the end of the yeti museum, two notices hang on the wall — one written by the museum&#39;s curator, warning against the railroad expeditions, and another by the owner of the expedition company, stating that the curator&#39;s notice &#34;does not represent the opinions or views&#34; of the company. The shorter <a href="/wiki/FASTPASS" id="w">FASTPASS</a> queue contains a similar but abbreviated storyline. The queues merge in the enclosed train station behind the loading area.</p>
<p>One of the attraction&#39;s highlights is an encounter with a large <a href="/wiki/Audio-Animatronics" id="w">Audio-Animatronic</a> <a href="/wiki/Yeti" id="w">yeti</a>, which Disney claims is one of the largest and most complex figures it has ever built.  <a href="/wiki/Joe_Rohde" id="w">Joe Rohde</a>, the lead <a href="/wiki/Imagineer" id="w">Imagineer</a> for Expedition Everest, has noted that the yeti featured in the attraction is extremely lifelike and based on extensive research into the cultural legend.</p>
<a id="Mission_Himalayas" name="Mission_Himalayas"></a><h2>Mission Himalayas</h2>
<p>In 2005, <a href="/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" id="w">Disney</a>, <a href="/wiki/Discovery_Channel" id="w">Discovery Networks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Conservation_International" id="w">Conservation International</a> conducted real-life expeditions to <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nepal" id="w">Nepal</a> as part of the promotion for Expedition Everest. The purpose was to conduct scientific and cultural research in remote areas of the Himalayas where the yeti legend exists. Participants included scientists from <a href="/wiki/Conservation_International" id="w">Conservation International</a> and Disney&#39;s Animal Kingdom, as well as Rohde.</p>
<p>The expeditions — as well as the making of the attraction — were chronicled in three documentaries broadcast on Discovery&#39;s cable television channels in April 2006. Rohde was featured in a <a href="/wiki/Travel_Channel" id="w">Travel Channel</a> program titled &#34;Expedition Everest: Journey to Sacred Lands,&#34; which premiered <a href="/wiki/April_9" id="w">April 9</a> to coincide with the attraction&#39;s grand opening.</p>
<a id="Times_Square_publicity_stunt" name="Times_Square_publicity_stunt"></a><h2>Times Square publicity stunt</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_15" id="w">February 15</a>, 2006, Disney staged an elaborate publicity stunt for Expedition Everest in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Times_Square" id="w">Times Square</a>, according to a report by radio station WINS:</p>
<dl><dd><i>Dangling from ropes hundreds of feet above Times Square, five acrobatic dancers and one of the world&#39;s fastest rock climbers performed cartwheels, flips and gravity-defying leaps Wednesday to promote the opening of a new ride at Walt Disney World.  . . .  Strapped into harnesses and hanging from nylon rope, [Hans] Florine and five other performers from the vertical dance company Project Bandaloop twirled and soared across the face of the billboard, which was done up to look like a mountainside.</i></dd></dl>
<p>The event, known as &#34;Everest in the City&#34;, draped large billboards over sides of the several buildings. The billboards depicted Everest with a coaster car careening down the mountainside, with the Yeti looking on from another peak. </p>
<p>The Yeti&#39;s eyes on the billboard glowed red and would flash when the text message &#34;4YETI&#34; was sent to a Disney-provided phone number.</p>
