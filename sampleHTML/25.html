<b>Autism</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Neurodevelopmental_disorders" id="w">brain development disorder</a> that impairs social interaction and communication, and causes restricted and repetitive behavior, all starting before a child is three years old. This set of signs distinguishes autism from milder <a href="/wiki/Autism_spectrum_disorder" id="w">autism spectrum disorders</a> (ASD) such as <a href="/wiki/Asperger_syndrome" id="w">Asperger syndrome</a>.</p>
<p>Autism is highly <a href="/wiki/Heritable" id="w">heritable</a>, although the <a href="/wiki/Heritability_of_autism" id="w">genetics of autism</a> are complex and it is generally unclear which genes are responsible.<sup id="_ref-Freitag_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Freitag" title="">[1]</a></sup> In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with <a href="/wiki/Teratology" id="w">agents</a> that cause birth defects.<sup id="_ref-Arndt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Arndt" title="">[2]</a></sup> Other proposed <a href="/wiki/Causes_of_autism" id="w">causes</a>, such as childhood vaccines, are <a href="/wiki/Controversies_in_autism" id="w">controversial</a> and the vaccine hypotheses lack convincing <a href="/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine" id="w">scientific evidence</a>.<sup id="_ref-Rutter_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rutter" title="">[3]</a></sup> Most recent reviews estimate a <a href="/wiki/Prevalence" id="w">prevalence</a> of one to two cases per 1,000 people for autism, and about six per 1,000 for ASD, with ASD averaging a 4.3:1 male-to-female ratio.

<p>Autism affects many parts of the brain; how this occurs is poorly understood. Parents usually notice signs in the first year or two of their child&#39;s life. Early intervention may help children gain self-care and social skills, although few of these interventions are supported by scientific studies.

Autism is a <a href="/wiki/Developmental_disorder" id="w">developmental disorder</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Human_brain" id="w">human brain</a> that first gives signs during infancy or childhood and follows a steady course without <a href="/wiki/Remission_(medicine)" id="w">remission</a> or <a href="/wiki/Relapse" id="w">relapse</a>.<sup id="_ref-ICD-10-F84.0_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ICD-10-F84.0" title="">[8]</a></sup> Impairments result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.<sup id="_ref-Penn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Penn" title="">[9]</a></sup> Autism is one of the five <a href="/wiki/Pervasive_developmental_disorder" id="w">pervasive developmental disorders</a> (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.<sup id="_ref-ICD-10-F84.0_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ICD-10-F84.0" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, <a href="/wiki/Developmental_disability" id="w">mentally disabled</a>, and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to less impaired individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- and <a href="/wiki/High-functioning_autism" id="w">high-functioning autism</a> (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on <a href="/wiki/IQ" id="w">IQ</a> thresholds,<sup id="_ref-hypersystem_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hypersystem" title="">[17]</a></sup> or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial.

<p>Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress. Several terms are used for this phenomenon, including <a href="/wiki/Regressive_autism" id="w">regressive autism</a>, setback autism, and developmental stagnation. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype.<sup id="_ref-Landa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Landa" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Volkmar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Volkmar" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Characteristics" name="Characteristics"></a><h1>Characteristics</h1>
<p>Autism is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than one single symptom. The main characteristics are impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.<sup id="_ref-Filipek_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Filipek" title="">[22]</a></sup> Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathological severity from common traits.<sup id="_ref-London_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-London" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Social_development" name="Social_development"></a><h2>Social development</h2>
<p>People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic <a href="/wiki/Temple_Grandin" id="w">Temple Grandin</a> described her inability to understand the social communication of <a href="/wiki/Neurotypical" id="w">neurotypicals</a> as leaving her feeling &#34;like an anthropologist on Mars&#34;.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Social impairments become apparent early in childhood and continue through adulthood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers have more striking social deviance; for example, they have less <a href="/wiki/Eye_contact" id="w">eye contact</a> and anticipatory postures and are less likely to use another person&#39;s hand or body as a tool.<sup id="_ref-Volkmar_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Volkmar" title="">[21]</a></sup> Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form <a href="/wiki/Attachment_(psychology)" id="w">attachments</a> to their primary caregivers.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> They display moderately less <a href="/wiki/Attachment_in_children#Secure attachment" id="w">attachment security</a> than usual, although this feature disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition.<sup id="_ref-Sigman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sigman" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Contrary to common belief, autistic children do not prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they are.<sup id="_ref-Burgess_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Burgess" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that in children with mental retardation, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and tantrums. Dominick <i>et al.</i> interviewed the parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in children with a history of language impairment.<sup id="_ref-Dominick_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dominick" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Communication" name="Communication"></a><h2>Communication</h2>
<p>About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of <a href="/wiki/Babbling" id="w">babbling</a>, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and the desynchronization of vocal patterns with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others&#39; words (<a href="/wiki/Echolalia" id="w">echolalia</a>)<sup id="_ref-Landa_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Landa" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Tager-Flusberg_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tager-Flusberg" title="">[31]</a></sup> or <a href="/wiki/Pronoun_reversal" id="w">reverse pronouns</a>.<sup id="_ref-Kanner1943_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kanner1943" title="">[32]</a></sup> Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.<sup id="_ref-Landa_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Landa" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Tager-Flusberg_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tager-Flusberg" title="">[31]</a></sup> They are more likely to have problems understanding pointing; for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object.<sup id="_ref-Volkmar_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Volkmar" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Tager-Flusberg_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tager-Flusberg" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well, and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.<sup id="_ref-Williams_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Williams" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)<sup id="_ref-RBS-R_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RBS-R" title="">[34]</a></sup> categorizes as follows.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Stereotypy_(psychiatry)" id="w">Stereotypy</a></b> is apparently purposeless movement, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder" id="w">Compulsive behavior</a></b> is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in a certain way.</li>
<li><b>Sameness</b> is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Ritual#Psychology" id="w">Ritualistic behavior</a></b> involves the performance of daily activities the same way each time, such as an unvarying menu or dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Restricted behavior</b> is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Self-injury" id="w">Self-injury</a></b> includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as biting oneself. Dominick <i>et al.</i> reported that self-injury at some point affected about 30% of children with ASD.<sup id="_ref-Dominick_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dominick" title="">[29]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>No single repetitive behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.<sup id="_ref-RBS-R_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RBS-R" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Other_symptoms" name="Other_symptoms"></a><h2>Other symptoms</h2>
<p>Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.<sup id="_ref-Filipek_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Filipek" title="">[22]</a></sup>
A small fraction of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious <a href="/wiki/Autistic_savant" id="w">autistic savants</a>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unusual responses to <a href="/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)" id="w">sensory stimuli</a> are more common and prominent in autistic children, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> The responses may be more common in children: a pair of studies found that autistic children had impaired <a href="/wiki/Tactition" id="w">tactile perception</a> while autistic adults did not. The same two studies also found that autistic individuals had more problems with complex memory and reasoning tasks such as <a href="/wiki/Twenty_Questions" id="w">Twenty Questions</a>; these problems were somewhat more marked among adults.<sup id="_ref-Williams_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Williams" title="">[33]</a></sup>
Several studies have reported associated motor problems that include <a href="/wiki/Poor_muscle_tone" id="w">poor muscle tone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Apraxia" id="w">poor motor planning</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Toe_walking" id="w">toe walking</a>; ASD is not associated with severe motor disturbances.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>Atypical eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur;<sup id="_ref-Dominick_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dominick" title="">[29]</a></sup> this does not appear to result in <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" id="w">malnutrition</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Sleep" id="w">Sleep</a> problems are known to be more common in children with developmental disabilities, and there is some evidence that children with ASD are more likely to have even more sleep problems than those with other developmental disabilities; autistic children may experience problems including difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal <a href="/wiki/Wakefulness" id="w">awakenings</a>, and early morning awakenings. Dominick <i>et al.</i> found that about two-thirds of children with ASD had a history of sleep problems.<sup id="_ref-Dominick_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dominick" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Causes" name="Causes"></a><h1>Causes</h1>
<p>{{main}}
Although many genetic and environmental causes of autism have been proposed, its <a href="/wiki/Etiology" id="w">theory of causation</a> is still incomplete.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Some researchers argue this is because autism is not a single disorder, but rather a triad of core aspects (social impairment, communication difficulties, and repetitive behaviors) that have distinct causes but often co-occur.<sup id="_ref-HappeTime_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HappeTime" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Genetic factors are the most significant cause for autism spectrum disorders. Early studies of twins estimated <a href="/wiki/Heritability" id="w">heritability</a> to be more than 90%; in other words, that genetics explains more than 90% of autism cases.<sup id="_ref-Freitag_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Freitag" title="">[1]</a></sup> This may be an overestimate; new twin data and models with structural genetic variation are needed.<sup id="_ref-Sykes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sykes" title="">[44]</a></sup> When only one identical twin is autistic, the other often has learning or social disabilities. For adult siblings, the risk of having one or more features of the broader autism phenotype might be as high as 30%,<sup id="_ref-Folstein_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Folstein" title="">[45]</a></sup> much higher than the risk in controls.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Heritability_of_autism" id="w">genetics of autism</a> is complex.<sup id="_ref-Freitag_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Freitag" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Genetic_linkage" id="w">Genetic linkage</a> analysis has been inconclusive; many <a href="/wiki/Genetic_association" id="w">association analyses</a> have had inadequate power.<sup id="_ref-Sykes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sykes" title="">[44]</a></sup> For each autistic individual, <a href="/wiki/Mutation" id="w">mutations</a> in more than one gene may be implicated. Mutations in different sets of genes may be involved in different autistic individuals. There may be significant interactions among mutations in several genes, or between the environment and mutated genes. By identifying genetic markers inherited with autism in family studies, numerous candidate genes have been located, most of which encode proteins involved in <a href="/wiki/Neural_development" id="w">neural development</a> and function.<sup id="_ref-Persico_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Persico" title="">[47]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> However, for most of the candidate genes, the actual mutations that increase the risk for autism have not been identified.

Hence, a substantial fraction of autism may be highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome. Although the fraction of autism traceable to a genetic cause may grow to 30–40% as the resolution of array CGH improves,<sup id="_ref-Beaudet_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Beaudet" title="">[50]</a></sup> several results in this area have been described incautiously, possibly misleading the public into thinking that a large proportion of autism is caused by CNVs and is detectable via array CGH, or that detecting CNVs is tantamount to a genetic diagnosis.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> The Autism Genome Project database contains <a href="/wiki/Genetic_linkage" id="w">genetic linkage</a> and CNV data that connect autism to genetic loci and suggest that every human <a href="/wiki/Chromosome" id="w">chromosome</a> may be involved.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>

<p>Interactions between the <a href="/wiki/Immune_system" id="w">immune system</a> and the nervous system begin early during <a href="/wiki/Embryogenesis" id="w">embryogenesis</a>, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response.

<p>Several <a href="/wiki/Neurotransmitter" id="w">neurotransmitter</a> abnormalities have been detected in autism, notably increased blood levels of <a href="/wiki/Serotonin" id="w">serotonin</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Mirror_neuron" id="w">mirror neuron system</a> (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism&#39;s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal of the same species perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual&#39;s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger&#39;s, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD.<sup id="_ref-Iacoboni_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Iacoboni" title="">[66]</a></sup> A variant theory, EP-M, segments the MNS into an indirect route for goal emulation and planning (EP) and a direct route for mimicry (M), and hypothesizes that only the M route is impaired in autism.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> A 2007 study of autistic adults found evidence for altered functional organization of the <a href="/wiki/Task-negative_network" id="w">task-negative network</a>, a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing, with intact organization of the <a href="/wiki/Task-positive_network" id="w">task-positive network</a>, used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Neuropsychology" name="Neuropsychology"></a><h2>Neuropsychology</h2>
<p>Two major categories of <a href="/wiki/Cognitive" id="w">cognitive</a> theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.</p>
<p>The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition. Hyper-systemizing hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle internal events—but are less effective at <a href="/wiki/Empathy" id="w">empathizing</a> by handling events generated by other agents.<sup id="_ref-hypersystem_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hypersystem" title="">[17]</a></sup> It extends the extreme male brain theory, which hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom <a href="/wiki/EQ_SQ_theory" id="w">systemizing is better than empathizing</a>.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> This in turn is related to the earlier <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_mind" id="w">theory of mind</a>, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind is supported by autistic children&#39;s atypical responses to the <a href="/wiki/Sally-Anne_test" id="w">Sally-Anne test</a> for reasoning about others&#39; motivations,<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> and is mapped well from the mirror neuron system theory of autism.<sup id="_ref-Iacoboni_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Iacoboni" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing. <a href="/wiki/Executive_dysfunction" id="w">Executive dysfunction</a> hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in flexibility, planning, and other forms of executive function. A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> a weakness is that executive function deficits are not found in young autistic children.<sup id="_ref-Sigman_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sigman" title="">[27]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Weak_central_coherence_theory" id="w">Weak central coherence theory</a> hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and <a href="/wiki/Perceptual" id="w">perceptual</a> operations in autistic individuals.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.</p>
<p>Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism&#39;s rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.<sup id="_ref-HappeTime_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HappeTime" title="">[43]</a></sup> A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.<sup id="_ref-Rajendran_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rajendran" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Screening" name="Screening"></a><h1>Screening</h1>
<p>Parents are usually the first to notice their child&#39;s unusual behaviors.<sup id="_ref-Strock_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Strock" title="">[14]</a></sup> Deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD; for example, they may not follow when a parent points and says &#34;Look!&#34;<sup id="_ref-Johnson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Johnson" title="">[77]</a></sup> As postponing treatment may affect long-term outcome, any of the following signs is reason to have a child evaluated by a specialist without delay:
</p>
<ul>
<li>No <a href="/wiki/Babbling" id="w">babbling</a> by 12 months.</li>
<li>No <a href="/wiki/Gesture" id="w">gesturing</a> (pointing, waving goodbye, etc.) by 12 months.</li>

<li>No two-word spontaneous phrases (not including <a href="/wiki/Echolalia" id="w">echolalia</a>) by 24 months.</li>
<li>Any loss of any language or social skills, at any age.<sup id="_ref-Filipek_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Filipek" title="">[22]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics" id="w">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> recommends that all children be <a href="/wiki/Screening_(medicine)" id="w">screened</a> for ASD at the 18- and 24-month well-child doctor visits, using autism-specific formal screening tests.<sup id="_ref-Johnson_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Johnson" title="">[77]</a></sup> In contrast, the UK National Screening Committee recommends against screening for ASD in the general population, because screening tools have not been fully validated and interventions lack sufficient evidence for effectiveness.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p>Genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical. As genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge.

<a id="Diagnosis" name="Diagnosis"></a><h1>Diagnosis</h1>

Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. Onset must be prior to age three years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by <a href="/wiki/Rett_syndrome" id="w">Rett syndrome</a> or <a href="/wiki/Childhood_disintegrative_disorder" id="w">childhood disintegrative disorder</a>.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/ICD-10" id="w">ICD-10</a> uses essentially the same definition.<sup id="_ref-ICD-10-F84.0_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ICD-10-F84.0" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the <a href="/wiki/Autism_Diagnostic_Interview-Revised" id="w">Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised</a> (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the <a href="/wiki/Autism_Diagnostic_Observation_Schedule" id="w">Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule</a> (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The <a href="/wiki/Childhood_Autism_Rating_Scale" id="w">Childhood Autism Rating Scale</a> (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.<sup id="_ref-Volkmar_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Volkmar" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Pediatrician" id="w">pediatrician</a> commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions. A <a href="/wiki/Differential_diagnosis" id="w">differential diagnosis</a> for ASD at this stage might also consider <a href="/wiki/Mental_retardation" id="w">mental retardation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hearing_impairment" id="w">hearing impairment</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Specific_language_impairment" id="w">specific language impairment</a><sup id="_ref-Dover_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dover" title="">[82]</a></sup> such as <a href="/wiki/Landau-Kleffner_syndrome" id="w">Landau-Kleffner syndrome</a>.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.<sup id="_ref-Dover_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dover" title="">[82]</a></sup> ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months,<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup> but a 2006 U.S. study found the average age of first evaluation by a qualified professional was 48 months and of formal ASD diagnosis was 61 months, reflecting an average 13-month delay, all far above recommendations.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup></p>
<p>Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the <a href="/wiki/Visually_impaired" id="w">visually impaired</a>, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>
<p>The symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood but are occasionally missed.

Autism&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Incidence_rate" id="w">incidence rate</a>, despite its advantages for assessing risk, is less useful in autism epidemiology, as the disorder starts long before it is diagnosed, and the gap between initiation and diagnosis is influenced by many factors unrelated to risk. Attention is focused mostly on whether prevalence is increasing with time. Earlier prevalence estimates were lower, centering at about 0.5 per 1,000 for autism during the 1960s and 1970s and about 1 per 1,000 in the 1980s, as opposed to today&#39;s 1–2 per 1,000.<sup id="_ref-Newschaffer_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Newschaffer" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
