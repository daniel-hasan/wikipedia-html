<b>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</b>, widely known as the <b>LDS Church</b> or the <b>Mormon Church</b>, is the largest and most well-known <a href="/wiki/Religious_denomination" id="w">denomination</a> originating from the <a href="/wiki/Latter_Day_Saint_movement" id="w">Latter Day Saint movement</a> founded by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr." id="w">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a> The church is headquartered in <a href="/wiki/Salt_Lake_City%2C_Utah" id="w">Salt Lake City, Utah</a>, and has established <a href="/wiki/Ward_(LDS_Church)" id="w">congregations</a> and <a href="/wiki/Temple_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">temples</a> worldwide, reporting approximately 13 million members on its rolls.<sup id="_ref-SLT13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SLT13" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-LDS13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LDS13" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Adherents, usually referred to as <i><a href="/wiki/Latter-day_Saint" id="w">Latter-day Saints</a></i>, <i>LDS</i>, or <i><a href="/wiki/Mormon" id="w">Mormons</a></i>, consider themselves to be <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christians</a>, but do not consider themselves part of the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Church" id="w">Catholic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Christianity" id="w">Orthodox</a> or <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" id="w">Protestant</a> traditions. The church may be considered a <a href="/wiki/Restorationism" id="w">Restorationist</a> organization, because it teaches there was a <a href="/wiki/Great_Apostasy" id="w">Great Apostasy</a>, or loss of the original authority to lead Christ&#39;s church. <a href="/wiki/Jesus" id="w">Jesus</a> is viewed as the head of the church, leading it today through <a href="/wiki/Revelation" id="w">revelations</a> given to a hierarchy of <a href="/wiki/Priesthood_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">priesthood</a> leaders. The highest-ranking leader is the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Church" id="w">President of the Church</a>, who is considered to be a <a href="/wiki/Prophet%2C_seer%2C_and_revelator" id="w">prophet</a> and an <a href="/wiki/Apostle_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">apostle</a>.</p>
<p>Latter-day Saints believe that four books of &#34;scripture&#34; have divine authority; the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a> &#34;as far as it is translated correctly&#34;<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>, the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Mormon" id="w">Book of Mormon</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Doctrine_and_Covenants" id="w">Doctrine and Covenants</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Pearl_of_Great_Price_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Pearl of Great Price</a>. According to their canon, Jesus is the son of God and <a href="/wiki/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)" id="w">Mary</a>, a virgin. They believe Jesus lived a sinless life, and that his suffering and <a href="/wiki/Crucifixion" id="w">crucifixion</a> was an <a href="/wiki/Atonement" id="w">atonement</a> for the sins of all humanity. They believe in Jesus&#39; literal bodily <a href="/wiki/Resurrection" id="w">resurrection</a>, and that he currently sits at the right hand of God the Father. They believe Jesus is united in purpose with the Father, but that they both have separate bodies of &#34;flesh and bone,&#34; rather than solely spirit.</p>
<p>The church has also distinguished itself from other Christian denominations by their belief in modern-day revelation through a prophet, temple <a href="/wiki/Ordinance_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">ceremonies</a> (such as <a href="/wiki/Baptism_for_the_dead" id="w">baptism for the dead</a>, eternal marriage which continues into the after-life and the <a href="/wiki/Endowment_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Endowment</a>), that Jesus visited and preached in the Americas after his resurrection, and its former practice of <a href="/wiki/Plural_marriage" id="w">plural marriage</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The LDS Church is the largest of the denominations from the <a href="/wiki/Latter_Day_Saint_movement" id="w">Latter Day Saint movement</a> that claim to be a continuation of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Christ_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Church of Christ</a>, founded by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr." id="w">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a> on <a href="/wiki/April_6" id="w">April 6</a> <a href="/wiki/1830" id="w">1830</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>Joseph Smith legally established this early church soon after, he claimed, translating the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Mormon" id="w">Book of Mormon</a>. The church rapidly gained a large following of individuals that viewed Joseph Smith as their <a href="/wiki/Prophet" id="w">prophet</a>. The growth of Joseph Smith&#39;s following was attributed to the convincing power of the Book of Mormon{{Fact}}, which Joseph Smith said he translated from a book of <a href="/wiki/Golden_plates" id="w">golden plates</a> that were buried near his home in a place shown to him by a resurrected human named <a href="/wiki/Moroni_(prophet)" id="w">Moroni</a>,<sup id="_ref-JSTestimony_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JSTestimony" title="">[6]</a></sup>, whom the LDS church commonly refers to as &#34;the angel Moroni&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In late 1830, Smith envisioned a <a href="/wiki/Zion_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">&#34;city of Zion&#34;</a> in <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native American</a> lands near <a href="/wiki/Independence%2C_Missouri" id="w">Independence, Missouri</a>. In October 1830, he sent his second-in-command, <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Cowdery" id="w">Oliver Cowdery</a>, and others on a <a href="/wiki/Missionary_(LDS_Church)" id="w">mission</a> to the area.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Passing through <a href="/wiki/Kirtland%2C_Ohio" id="w">Kirtland, Ohio</a>, the missionaries converted a congregation of <a href="/wiki/Disciples_of_Christ" id="w">Disciples of Christ</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Sidney_Rigdon" id="w">Sidney Rigdon</a>, and in 1831, Smith decided to temporarily move his followers to Kirtland until the <a href="/wiki/Missouri" id="w">Missouri</a> area could be colonized. The church headquarters remained in Kirtland from 1831 to 1838; meanwhile, the church built <a href="/wiki/Kirtland_Temple" id="w">its first temple</a> and continued to grow.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/July_20" id="w">July 20</a> <a href="/wiki/1831" id="w">1831</a>, Smith circulated a written revelation that <a href="/wiki/Independence%2C_Missouri" id="w">Independence, Missouri</a> was to be the center place for the city of Zion.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Though many of Smith&#39;s followers attempted to colonize Missouri throughout the 1830s and Smith himself moved there in 1838, the church faced political and military opposition from other Missouri settlers. After a series of raids on Mormon settlements, the church formed its own militia to defend its members and the <a href="/wiki/Mormon_War" id="w">Mormon War</a> of 1838 ensued, culminating in the religion being expelled from the state under an <a href="/wiki/Extermination_Order" id="w">Extermination Order</a> signed by <a href="/wiki/Lilburn_W._Boggs" id="w">the governor of Missouri</a>.</p>
<p>The church then established its new headquarters in <a href="/wiki/Nauvoo%2C_Illinois" id="w">Nauvoo, Illinois</a>, a city they built on drained swampland by the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a>, where Smith served as mayor. There, the church built a <a href="/wiki/Nauvoo_Temple" id="w">new temple</a>, and thrived until Smith and his brother <a href="/wiki/Hyrum_Smith" id="w">Hyrum</a>, who was serving as <a href="/wiki/Assistant_President_of_the_Church" id="w">assistant president</a> and <a href="/wiki/Presiding_Patriarch" id="w">patriarch of the church</a>, were <a href="/wiki/Death_of_Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr." id="w">killed by a mob</a> in 1844. The Smith brothers were awaiting trial after the Nauvoo city council decided to destroy a <a href="/wiki/Nauvoo_Expositor" id="w">local newspaper</a> that accused Smith of practicing a form of <a href="/wiki/Polygamy" id="w">polygamy</a> and intending to establish himself as a <a href="/wiki/Theocracy" id="w">theocratic</a> king. Specific threats against the leadership of the church and violent action against its members were also made{{Fact}}. While the legality of destroying a printing press that published violent threats against a community in 1844 is even today uncertain,<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Hyrum and Joseph were nevertheless promptly charged with disruption of the peace and high treason. Joseph Smith, at the time, was a minor candidate for <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President of the United States</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Sidney_Rigdon" id="w">Sidney Rigdon</a> as his running mate.</p>

</p>
<p>After the murder of the Smiths, a <a href="/wiki/Succession_crisis" id="w">succession crisis</a> ensued whereby a number of church leaders campaigned to lead the church. The majority of adherents voted to accept the succession claims presented by the <a href="/wiki/Quorum_of_the_Twelve_Apostles" id="w">Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Brigham_Young" id="w">Brigham Young</a>. Their claim was based on a March 1844 meeting wherein Joseph committed the &#34;keys of the kingdom&#34; on the twelve apostles with Young as their <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Quorum_of_the_Twelve_Apostles" id="w">leader</a>. After continued difficulties and persecution in Illinois, Young left Nauvoo in 1846 and led <a href="/wiki/Mormon_pioneers" id="w">his followers</a> to what later became the state of <a href="/wiki/Utah" id="w">Utah</a> (then part of <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>), and began to colonize the area with numerous communities.</p>
<p>Young incorporated The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a legal entity under the laws of the <a href="/wiki/Territory_of_Utah" id="w">Territory of Utah</a>. He initially governed his followers as a <a href="/wiki/Theocracy" id="w">theocratic</a> leader serving in both political and religious positions. He openly encouraged the practice of <a href="/wiki/Plural_marriage" id="w">plural marriage</a>. When this practice became known in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>, the United States sent federal troops there in 1857, <a href="/wiki/Utah_War" id="w">deposed Young</a>, and replaced him with <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Cumming_(governor)" id="w">a non-Mormon territorial governor</a>, though Young still wielded significant political power as <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Church" id="w">President of the Church</a>.</p>
<p>Young was followed by other powerful leaders, who defiantly followed the dictates of their personal beliefs in the face of U.S. efforts to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. Political and legal wrangling over the polygamy issue escalated until 1890, when church president <a href="/wiki/Wilford_Woodruff" id="w">Wilford Woodruff</a> issued a <a href="/wiki/1890_Manifesto" id="w">Manifesto</a> that officially suspended the practice.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, and especially after 1904, when church president <a href="/wiki/Joseph_F._Smith" id="w">Joseph F. Smith</a> <a href="/wiki/Reed_Smoot_hearings" id="w">disavowed polygamy</a> before the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" id="w">United States Congress</a> and issued a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Second_Manifesto" id="w">Second Manifesto</a>&#34; calling for all polygamous marriages in the church to cease. Although both these statements were issued it has been estimated that 150 polygamous marriages had been done by the church per year from 1890 to 1904, many of which were performed in Mexico to alleviate the legal issues associated with conducting polygamous marriages in the United States.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Since this time, the church has adopted a policy of <a href="/wiki/Excommunication" id="w">excommunicating</a> its members found practicing polygamy. In 1998, President Gordon B. Hinckley stated, </p><blockquote>
<p>&#34;If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church.&#34;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/20th_century" id="w">twentieth century</a>, the church experienced a period of strong growth resulting from both a high birth rate and extensive <a href="/wiki/Proselytism" id="w">proselytism</a>.{{Fact}} </p>
<p>The church has played, at times, a prominent role in political matters, including opposition to <a href="/wiki/LGM-118A_Peacekeeper" id="w">MX Peacekeeper missile</a> bases in Utah and <a href="/wiki/Nevada" id="w">Nevada</a>,<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> opposing the <a href="/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment" id="w">Equal Rights Amendment</a>,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> opposing legalized <a href="/wiki/Gambling" id="w">gambling</a>,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> support of bans on <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage" id="w">same-sex marriage</a>,<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> and opposition to legalized <a href="/wiki/Euthanasia" id="w">physician-assisted death</a>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Apart from issues that it considers to be ones of morality, however, the church maintains a position of political neutrality.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>The church teaches that <a href="/wiki/God_the_Father" id="w">God the Father</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ" id="w">Jesus Christ</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Spirit" id="w">Holy Ghost</a> are &#34;one God&#34; in the sense that they are one &#34;in purpose&#34;, but does not accept the <a href="/wiki/Nicene_Creed" id="w">Nicene Creed</a>&#39;s definition of <a href="/wiki/Trinity" id="w">Trinity</a>, that the three are &#34;<a href="/wiki/Consubstantiality" id="w">consubstantial</a>&#34;. Rather, the church teaches that the Father and the Son are two distinct beings, both with glorified, perfect bodies of flesh and bone, while the Holy Ghost is a distinct being with only a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Spirit_body" id="w">spirit body</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> God the Father is understood to be the literal father of all the spirits who inhabit this earth<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>.  He is also understood to be the father of Jesus&#39; spirit body and his physical body. Joseph Smith stated, </p><blockquote>
<p>&#34;Many men say there is one God; the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost are only one God. I say that is a strange God [anyhow]--three in one and one in three. . .It is curious organization. . . All are crammed into one God according to sectarianism (Christian faith). It would make the biggest God in all the world. He would be a wonderfully big God--he would be a giant or a monster (monstrosity).&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The church teaches that Jesus is its central focus and emphasizes that his suffering in <a href="/wiki/Gethsemane" id="w">Gethsemane</a> and on the cross <a href="/wiki/Atonement" id="w">paid for the sins</a> of humanity. This Atonement however is also believed to cover not only sin, but pain, suffering, heart ache, or hardship we experience in our life on earth. Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus&#39; status as the son of a mortal woman gave him the ability to suffer temptations and experience physical death; while his status as the Son of God gave him the power to lay down and take up his life again at will. The church also believes in the physical <a href="/wiki/Death_and_Resurrection_of_Jesus" id="w">resurrection</a> of Jesus&#39; body: that his physical body and spirit body were reunited, never again to be separated. Because of its emphasis on Jesus&#39; resurrection and his status as the living head of the church, the church does not officially use the <a href="/wiki/Symbol" id="w">symbol</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Christian_cross" id="w">Christian cross</a>. Instead, the church tends to focus on the belief that Jesus overcame suffering and <a href="/wiki/Death" id="w">death</a> and that he lives today.</p>
<p>The church follows what it understands to be the teachings of Jesus, both in the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a> and in other scriptures, such as the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Mormon" id="w">Book of Mormon</a>. The church also teaches that Jesus is the god <a href="/wiki/Tetragrammaton" id="w">Jehovah</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament" id="w">Old Testament</a>. Because Jesus is thought to be omniscient and have the same purpose as the Father, the church teaches that Jesus Christ often speaks in the scriptures as though he were God the Father, because in so doing he is fulfilling the will of the Father.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Official church materials refer to &#34;Heavenly Parents,&#34; implying to some the existence of a <a href="/wiki/Heavenly_Mother_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Heavenly Mother</a>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Belief in such a figure is common among members, and she has been mentioned in sermons by church officials<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> and in some of the <a href="/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_hymns" id="w">hymns of the church</a>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> However, no specific doctrine on the subject of a Heavenly Mother has been released by the church.

In common with other <a href="/wiki/Restorationism" id="w">Restorationist</a> churches, the church believes in a <a href="/wiki/Great_Apostasy" id="w">Great Apostasy</a>. It teaches that after the death of Jesus and the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Apostles" id="w">Twelve Apostles</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Priesthood_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">priesthood</a> authority was lost and some important doctrinal teachings, including the text of the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a>, were changed from their original form, thus necessitating a <a href="/wiki/Restoration_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Restoration</a> prior to the <a href="/wiki/Second_Coming" id="w">Second Coming</a>. That restoration, according to church doctrine, took place during the life of <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr." id="w">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a></p>
<p>According to church <a href="/wiki/Theology" id="w">theology</a>, the restoration took place through a series of visions and revelations, including Smith&#39;s <a href="/wiki/First_Vision" id="w">First Vision</a> in 1820, visits by various <a href="/wiki/Angel" id="w">angelic</a> messengers including <a href="/wiki/Moroni_(prophet)" id="w">Moroni</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_the_Baptist" id="w">John the Baptist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Moses" id="w">Moses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elijah" id="w">Elijah</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Apostles" id="w">apostles</a> <a href="/wiki/Saint_Peter" id="w">Peter</a>, <a href="/wiki/James%2C_son_of_Zebedee" id="w">James</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_the_Apostle" id="w">John</a>. Smith said these messengers gave him <a href="/wiki/Priesthood_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">priesthood authority</a> (first the <a href="/wiki/Aaronic_priesthood" id="w">Aaronic priesthood</a> and then the <a href="/wiki/Melchizedek_priesthood" id="w">Melchizedek priesthood</a>) and various &#34;keys&#34; of the priesthood that had been lost through the ages, so that Smith finally possessed the &#34;fullness of the Gospel&#34;. The restoration also included the formation of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Christ_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Church of Christ</a>. The LDS Church teaches that it is the successor of this Church of Christ and that the current <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Church_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">President of the Church</a> is Smith&#39;s modern successor.</p>
<p>The priesthood authority is offered (people are free to choose not to receive the priesthood) to all male members ages 12 and older who generally follow the church&#39;s code of morality. Men receive the priesthood by <a href="/wiki/Ordination" id="w">ordination</a>, which consists of other priesthood holders <a href="/wiki/Laying_on_of_hands" id="w">laying their hands</a> on their head and also providing a blessing. After the time of Joseph Smith, <a href="/wiki/Black_people" id="w">black men</a> of sub-Saharan African descent were barred from being ordained to the priesthood and entering the religion&#39;s temples; in 1978, church president <a href="/wiki/Spencer_W._Kimball" id="w">Spencer W. Kimball</a> announced a revelation declaring that all worthy men could be ordained to the priesthood. (See <a href="/wiki/Blacks_and_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" id="w">Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.) Women are not ordained to priesthood offices, although some temple ordinances are performed by women. (see <a href="/wiki/Temple_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Temple (Latter Day Saints)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Endowment_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Endowment (Latter Day Saints)</a> and <a href="/wiki/Women_and_Mormonism" id="w">Women and Mormonism</a>.)</p>
<p>For the most part, ordination to the priesthood is a prerequisite to preside in the church, although women are given un-ordained leadership roles over children and other women, and they perform certain temple ordinances of women. The priesthood is structured in a hierarchical manner, emphasizing obedience. Members are encouraged to avoid public criticism of priesthood leaders; repeated public criticism by an individual may eventually result in <a href="/wiki/Excommunication" id="w">excommunication</a>. (See <a href="/wiki/Mormonism_and_authority" id="w">Mormonism and authority</a>.) Although the church had a paid local clergy in the 1800s,<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> local and regional priesthood leaders currently serve as volunteers. Non-clerical church employees, <a href="/wiki/General_authority" id="w">general authorities</a> (who serve life or five-year terms), and <a href="/wiki/Mission_president" id="w">mission presidents</a> (who serve three-year terms) are paid a stipend from church funds and provided other benefits. A general missionary fund covers the basic living expenses of single <a href="/wiki/Missionary_(LDS_Church)" id="w">Mormon missionaries</a>. Missionaries and their families are asked to contribute to this fund, and in the United States the missionary&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ward_(LDS_Church)" id="w">congregation</a> of origin is ultimately responsible to satisfy the monthly obligation to the general fund. Members volunteer general custodial work for local church facilities.</p>

<p>Latter-day Saint <a href="/wiki/Sacrament" id="w">sacraments</a> are called <a href="/wiki/Ordinance_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">&#39;&#39;ordinances&#39;&#39;</a>, and there are two types: saving ordinances and non-saving ordinances. All ordinances, whether saving or nonsaving, must be performed by a man ordained to the appropriate <a href="/wiki/Priesthood_(LDS_Church)" id="w">priesthood</a> office, with the exception of certain parts of the <a href="/wiki/Endowment_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Endowment</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Initiatory" id="w">initiatory</a> or <a href="/wiki/Washings_and_anointings" id="w">washings and anointings</a>, in which women can perform the ordinance without being ordained to an office.</p>
<p>Saving ordinances are those required for <a href="/wiki/Salvation" id="w">salvation</a>, and include <a href="/wiki/Baptism" id="w">baptism</a> by immersion, with &#34;<a href="/wiki/Sacrament_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">sacrament</a>&#34;, taken each Sunday, to keep in remembrance of and to renew the covenant made at baptism, the <a href="/wiki/Laying_on_of_hands" id="w">laying on of hands</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Gift_of_the_Holy_Ghost" id="w">gift of the Holy Ghost</a> (<a href="/wiki/Confirmation" id="w">confirmation</a>), ordination to an office of the <a href="/wiki/Priesthood_(LDS_Church)" id="w">priesthood</a> (for males), the initiatory or <a href="/wiki/Washing_and_anointing" id="w">washings and anointings</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Endowment_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Endowment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Celestial_marriage" id="w">celestial marriage</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sealing_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">family sealings</a>.

However, the church teaches that they may be performed for a person either during their lifetime or by proxy after the person has died.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> Therefore, church members participate in the saving ordinances on behalf of dead relatives and others whose names have been extracted from historical records. The performance of these proxy ordinances are one of the functions of the church&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Temple_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">temples</a>. There have been certain exceptions to the church&#39;s policy of performing proxy work for all persons who have died: prior to the 1978 revelation admitting blacks to temple ceremonies, the church did not perform proxy ordinances for black men and women who had died, and since 1995, the church has agreed to discontinue performing ordinances for dead victims of the Jewish <a href="/wiki/Holocaust" id="w">Holocaust</a>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> </p>
<p>All the saving ordinances are currently open to all worthy members of the appropriate age. Prior to 1978, <a href="/wiki/Black_people" id="w">black members</a> were barred from all saving ordinances other than baptism and confirmation, but this policy was changed in 1978.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Celestial marriage is open to one man and one woman at a time, but a <a href="/wiki/Widower" id="w">widower</a> may enter a second celestial marriage.</p>
<p>Apart from sealings to parents, the church does not perform saving ordinances for those younger than age eight or for those who have died before the age of eight (when children reach the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Coming_of_age#Age of accountability" id="w">age of accountability</a>&#34;), because young children are deemed &#34;alive in Christ&#34; and not responsible for sin.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Likewise, the church teaches that the saving ordinances are not required for persons age eight or older who are &#34;mentally incapable of knowing right and wrong&#34;.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> </p>

<p>During the pre-earth life, Heavely Father presented a plan to have a Savior make it possible for mankind to be saved.  Jesus Christ stepped forward as the chosen Savior.  However, Lucifer, one of the spirits, proposed a rival plan whereby every soul would be saved, he would receive God&#39;s power, and human <a href="/wiki/Agency_(Mormonism)" id="w">agency</a> would be eliminated.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> When God rejected that plan, the <a href="/wiki/War_of_Heaven" id="w">War in Heaven</a> ensued, resulting in Lucifer and one third part of the spirits being cast out and denied ever receiving physical bodies.

<p>The church&#39;s view of history is informed by the faith&#39;s scriptures. Mormon history begins with the <a href="/wiki/Creation_according_to_Genesis" id="w">creation according to Genesis</a>, but has never endorsed any particular form of <a href="/wiki/Creationism" id="w">creationism</a>. Though it does not officially oppose any particular findings of <a href="/wiki/Natural_history" id="w">natural history</a>, the church regards <a href="/wiki/Adam" id="w">Adam</a> as the first &#34;primal parent of the [human] race&#34;.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>Based on teachings in the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Mormon" id="w">Book of Mormon</a>, the church teaches an expansive form of <a href="/wiki/American_exceptionalism" id="w">American exceptionalism</a>, where the Americas are a special location reserved by God for those who love freedom and <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_religion" id="w">freedom of religion</a>.

<p>The church also teaches an expansive view of God&#39;s covenant with <a href="/wiki/Abraham" id="w">Abraham</a>, which Joseph Smith taught extends not just to <a href="/wiki/Jews" id="w">Jews</a>, but to Mormons, who in most cases are declared by their <a href="/wiki/Patriarchal_blessing" id="w">patriarchal blessings</a> to be literal descendants of the <a href="/wiki/Tribe_of_Ephraim" id="w">tribe of Ephraim</a>, or adopted into this tribe.

The LDS Church has been characterized as a <a href="/wiki/Family" id="w">family</a>-centered religion. The church teaches that every being that lived upon the earth initially had a <a href="/wiki/Spirit_body" id="w">spirit body</a> and that all were born to Heavenly Parents in a <a href="/wiki/Pre-existence" id="w">pre-mortal existence</a>.<sup id="_ref-family_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-family" title="">[56]</a></sup> The church teaches that on earth, families may be &#34;<a href="/wiki/Sealing_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">sealed</a>&#34;—meaning that they are eternally bound as <a href="/wiki/Husband" id="w">husband</a>–<a href="/wiki/Wife" id="w">wife</a>, parents–child—and that these bonds will continue after death.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> Sealings can also include deceased <a href="/wiki/Ancestor" id="w">ancestors</a>, providing much of the church&#39;s rationale for its extensive <a href="/wiki/Family_history" id="w">family history</a> activities.</p>
<p>The church also teaches that each person&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Gender" id="w">gender</a> is eternal and that <a href="/wiki/Gender_role" id="w">gender roles</a> are authorized by God: in general, men are to preside over and provide for their families and women are to nurture children.<sup id="_ref-family_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-family" title="">[56]</a></sup> The church characterizes the man-woman relationship as &#34;equal but different&#34;.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> Nevertheless, LDS women in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> work outside the home in about the same <a href="/wiki/Percentage" id="w">percentage</a> as other American women.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> The church teaches that <a href="/wiki/Gender" id="w">gender</a> is inherently linked to sex, but the church has no official policy on the status of <a href="/wiki/Intersex" id="w">intersex</a> persons. <a href="/wiki/Transgender" id="w">Transgender</a> persons are accepted in the church and may be baptized, but may not receive the priesthood or enter the temple if they are considering or have undergone elective <a href="/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery" id="w">sex reassignment surgery</a>.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Geographic_structure" name="Geographic_structure"></a><h2>Geographic structure</h2>
<p>Church congregations are generally organized geographically. For Sunday services, the church is grouped into either larger (~200 to ~400 people) congregations known as <a href="/wiki/Ward_(Mormonism)" id="w">wards</a>, or smaller congregations known as branches. These neighborhood congregations meet in meetinghouses, also referred to as &#34;chapels&#34; or &#34;stake centers&#34; or just ward buildings, located on property most often owned by the church. In some geographic areas, rental property may be used as a meetinghouse. Although the building may sometimes be referred to as a &#34;chapel&#34;, the room used as a chapel for religious services is actually only one component of the standard meetinghouse.<sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup> The church&#39;s online &#34;Meetinghouse Locator&#34; can be used to find locations of church buildings and meeting times.<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup></p>
<p>Regional church organizations larger than single congregations include <a href="/wiki/Stake_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">stakes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mission_(LDS_Church)" id="w">missions</a>, <a href="/wiki/District_(LDS_Church)" id="w">districts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Area_(LDS_Church)" id="w">areas</a>, and regions.</p>
<a id="Priesthood_hierarchy" name="Priesthood_hierarchy"></a><h2> Priesthood hierarchy </h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The church has a hierarchical structure, with clearly defined stewardships or realms of responsibility for the various offices. Those who hold such offices do not elect to do so but are &#34;called&#34; by someone of a higher authority in the church; all are <a href="/wiki/Laity" id="w">laity</a> and are not paid for their service.</p>
<p>The leader of the church is termed <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Church_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">President</a>, and church members revere him as a <a href="/wiki/Prophet%2C_seer%2C_and_revelator" id="w">prophet, seer, and revelator</a>. The prophet is believed to hold the same divine calling as biblical prophets, and his responsibility is primarily over the church as a whole. His stewardship extends over the whole human family on earth as the Lord&#39;s mouthpiece. He is entitled to guide the church through <a href="/wiki/Revelation_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">revelation</a>, acting as God&#39;s spokesman. The President of the Church serves as such until death. Historically, the senior <a href="/wiki/Apostle_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">apostle</a> of the church has always become the new President of the Church. The current president is <a href="/wiki/Gordon_B._Hinckley" id="w">Gordon B. Hinckley</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/First_Presidency_(LDS_Church)" id="w">First Presidency</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Quorum_of_the_Twelve_Apostles_(LDS_Church)" id="w">Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Presiding_Bishop_(LDS_Church)" id="w">Presiding Bishopric</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">First and Second Quorums of the Seventy</a> are all referred to as <i><a href="/wiki/General_authorities" id="w">general authorities</a></i> because they direct the work of the entire church throughout the world. The members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are accepted by the church as <a href="/wiki/Prophets%2C_seers%2C_and_revelators" id="w">prophets, seers, and revelators</a>. </p>
<p>Other church authorities are referred to as <i>area authorities</i> and <i>local authorities</i> and include all other <a href="/wiki/Quorums_of_the_Seventy" id="w">Quorums of the Seventy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mission_(LDS_Church)" id="w">mission presidents</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stake_(Mormonism)" id="w">stake presidents</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bishop" id="w">bishops</a>, and other <a href="/wiki/Quorum_(Mormonism)" id="w">priesthood quorum</a> presidents. </p>
<p>The church has no salaried ministry; however, general authorities who demonstrate need receive stipends from the church, using income from church-owned investments.<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[103]</a></sup> All area and local authorities are <a href="/wiki/Laity" id="w">unpaid</a> and continue in their normal occupations while serving in leadership positions.</p>
<p>The church teaches that <a href="/wiki/Revelation_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">revelation</a> from God continues today, but only as far as one&#39;s own responsibility is concerned. Accordingly, revelation to direct the entire church comes to the president; revelation to direct a <a href="/wiki/Stake_(Mormonism)" id="w">stake</a> comes to the stake president; for a <a href="/wiki/Ward_(Mormonism)" id="w">ward</a>, to the bishop; and so forth. Latter-day Saints also believe that individuals can receive personal revelation and divine guidance in raising their families and managing their personal affairs. Because of their belief in modern revelation, Latter-day Saints give significant weight to the teachings of their church leaders. They revere the words their prophets and <a href="/wiki/General_authority" id="w">general authorities</a> speak when &#34;moved upon by the Holy Ghost&#34;<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup> as modern-day scripture, and members are encouraged to ponder and pray for revelation regarding the truthfulness of such statements.</p>
<a id="Auxiliary_organizations" name="Auxiliary_organizations"></a><h2>Auxiliary organizations</h2>

<p>Under the control of the priesthood hierarchy are five <a href="/wiki/Auxiliary_organization" id="w">auxiliary organizations</a> that fill various roles in the church: <a href="/wiki/Relief_Society" id="w">Relief Society</a>, <a href="/wiki/Young_Men_Organization" id="w">Young Men Organization</a>, <a href="/wiki/Young_Women_Organization" id="w">Young Women Organization</a>, <a href="/wiki/Primary_(LDS_Church)" id="w">Primary</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sunday_School_(LDS_Church)" id="w">Sunday School</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Relief_Society" id="w">Relief Society</a> is the church&#39;s women&#39;s organization. Founded in 1842 in <a href="/wiki/Nauvoo" id="w">Nauvoo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a>, and with the motto &#34;Charity Never Faileth&#34;, the organization today includes more than 5 million women in over 165 countries.<sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup> Every Latter-day Saint woman age 18 or older is a member of the Relief Society.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Young_Men_Organization" id="w">Young Men</a> and <a href="/wiki/Young_Women_Organization" id="w">Young Women</a> Organizations are composed of adolescents aged 12 to 18. Members often have an additional meeting during the week (referred to as Mutual), which can involve an activity, game, service project, or instruction. The young men and women may meet separately or take part in a combined activities. In the United States and Canada, the young men participate in <a href="/wiki/Scouting" id="w">Scouting</a>, including efforts to gain an award unique to the LDS Church, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Religious_emblems_programs_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" id="w">On my Honor</a>.&#34; Young men throughout the church also work towards earning the church&#39;s &#34;Duty to God&#34; award. Young women participate in a comparable program called <a href="/wiki/Personal_Progress" id="w">Personal Progress</a>. Both the young men and the young women are encouraged to live by the standards outlined in the church&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/For_the_Strength_of_Youth" id="w">For the Strength of Youth</a>&#34; booklet.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Primary_(LDS_Church)" id="w">Primary</a> is an organization for children up to age 12, founded in 1878. It provides classes, music, and activities for children during the second and third hours of the Sunday meeting schedule.</p>
<p>The LDS <a href="/wiki/Sunday_School_(LDS_Church)" id="w">Sunday School</a> organization provides classes for adolescents and adults during the second hour of the Sunday meeting schedule.

Young men between the ages of 19 and 25 who meet minimum standards of worthiness and preparation are encouraged to serve a two-year, full-time proselytizing mission.

Joseph Smith taught that &#34;the glory of God is intelligence.&#34;<sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[107]</a></sup> Accordingly, the church maintains <a href="/wiki/Brigham_Young_University" id="w">Brigham Young University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brigham_Young_University%E2%80%93Idaho" id="w">Brigham Young University–Idaho</a> (formerly Ricks College), <a href="/wiki/Brigham_Young_University_Hawaii" id="w">Brigham Young University Hawaii</a>, and <a href="/wiki/LDS_Business_College" id="w">LDS Business College</a>.

The <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Religion" id="w">Institute of Religion</a> and the <a href="/wiki/LDS_Student_Association" id="w">LDS Student Association</a> programs serve young adults between the ages of 18 and 30 and those enrolled in <a href="/wiki/Post-secondary_education" id="w">post-secondary education</a> institutions with church-owned buildings near university and college campuses designated for the purpose of religious education and cultural socialization.</p>
<p>In addition, the church sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the <a href="/wiki/Perpetual_Education_Fund" id="w">Perpetual Education Fund</a>. This fund is designed to benefit young men and women from less developed parts of the world who have served a <a href="/wiki/Mormon_missionary" id="w">mission</a>, returned to their home, and need further education to become productive citizens in their respective countries.

<p>Members of the church donate <a href="/wiki/Fast_offering" id="w">fast offerings</a> on <a href="/wiki/Fast_Sunday" id="w">Fast Sunday</a> and at other times for the purpose of helping those who are poor or financially struggling.  The <a href="/wiki/Bishop_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">bishop</a> will meet with a family, or the head(s) of a family to determine whether and how much help they need from the church.  The church strongly encourages its members to be self-reliant, so these meetings will usually include a plan on how to get the family back on its own feet.  This welfare program is not only available to members of the church, but to any needy members of the community.  In fact, the church has a very broad <a href="/wiki/Humanitarian_Services" id="w">humanitarian effort</a> of the church, which helps not only those who are going through financial struggles, but also victims of natural disasters or other devastating events.

In addition to these regularly scheduled meetings, additional meetings are frequently held at the meetinghouse. Auxiliary officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes. The ward or branch community may schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations. Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances and various personal improvement classes. Church members may also reserve the building for personal or family use, to accommodate such events as music recitals, family reunions, weddings and receptions, birthdays, or funerals.</p>
<a id="Media_community" name="Media_community"></a><h2>Media community</h2>

The church owns a chain of bookstores called <a href="/wiki/Deseret_Book" id="w">Deseret Book</a> which provide an avenue for much of this media to be sold. This culture also resides outside of heavily Mormon populations and many LDS bookstores exist near temples where members commonly visit. Some of the titles that have become popular outside of the LDS community are <i><a href="/wiki/The_Work_and_the_Glory" id="w">The Work and the Glory</a></i> novels and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Other_Side_of_Heaven" id="w">The Other Side of Heaven</a></i> movie.

<a id="Criticism" name="Criticism"></a><h1>Criticism</h1>
<p>{{main}}
The church has been subject to significant criticism since its early years in New York and Pennsylvania.  The criticism often focused on the church&#39;s rapid growth and unusual doctrines.  Criticism continued after the church settled in Missouri, culminating in the 1838 <a href="/wiki/Mormon_War" id="w">Mormon War</a>. After the church relocated to Illinois, criticism persisted and led to the assassination of <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr." id="w">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a> in 1844. After Smith&#39;s death, the <a href="/wiki/Succession_Crisis" id="w">Succession Crisis</a> ensued, and various denominations of the LDS movement struggled for power, levying criticisms against each other, primarily regarding authority or doctrine. In the late 1800&#39;s, many criticized the LDS church, the largest branch, for its practice of  <a href="/wiki/Criticism_of_LDS#Polygamy" id="w">polygamy</a>, and federal legislators actively began passing laws designed to weaken the LDS church. Throughout the history of the movement, critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith&#39;s revelations, and the historicity of <a href="/wiki/The_Book_of_Mormon" id="w">the Book of Mormon</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Abraham" id="w">Book of Abraham</a>.
