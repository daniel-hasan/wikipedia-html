Nor should it be confused with the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Kansas" id="w">University of Kansas</a>, located in <a href="/wiki/Lawrence%2C_Kansas" id="w">Lawrence, Kansas</a>, though the university and the city take their name from the same person, <a href="/wiki/Amos_Adams_Lawrence" id="w">Amos Adams Lawrence</a>.</p>

<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>Lawrence&#39;s first president, <a href="/wiki/William_Harkness_Sampson" id="w">William Harkness Sampson</a> founded the school with <a href="/wiki/Henry_R._Colman" id="w">Henry R. Colman</a>, using $10,000 provided by famed <a href="/wiki/Philanthropist" id="w">philanthropist</a> <a href="/wiki/Amos_Adams_Lawrence" id="w">Amos Adams Lawrence</a>, and matched by the <a href="/wiki/Methodist" id="w">Methodist</a> church. Both founders were ordained Methodist <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_religion" id="w">ministers</a>, although Lawrence was <a href="/wiki/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America" id="w">Episcopalian</a>. The school was originally named <b>Lawrence Institute</b>, documented in its 1847 charter from the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature.</p>
<p>Lawrence&#39;s first period of major growth came during the tenure of <a href="/wiki/Alumnus" id="w">alumnus</a> <a href="/wiki/Samuel_G._Plantz" id="w">Samuel G. Plantz</a> as president.  From 1894 until 1924, Plantz presided over the school and led its student body to grow from 200 to 800.</p>
<p>From 1913 until 1964, the school was named Lawrence College, to emphasize its small size and <a href="/wiki/Liberal_arts" id="w">liberal arts</a> education focus.  The name was changed back to Lawrence University when it joined with <a href="/wiki/Milwaukee-Downer_College" id="w">Milwaukee-Downer College</a>, symbolizing the two schools united as one.  Initially, the university designated two entities: Lawrence College for Men and Downer College for Women.  This separation has not lasted in any material form, though degrees are still conferred &#34;on the recommendation of the Faculty of Lawrence and Downer Colleges&#34; and the university by-laws still make the distinction.</p>
<p>The <b>Lawrence Conservatory of Music</b>, affectionately referred to as &#34;the Con,&#34; was founded in <a href="/wiki/1894" id="w">1894</a>.  The university confers a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Music" id="w">Bachelor of Music</a> degree and also offers a five-year program leading to a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts" id="w">Bachelor of Arts</a> in addition to the <a href="/wiki/Music" id="w">music</a> degree.</p>
<p>Lawrence University is distinguished by originating the idea of <a href="/wiki/Freshman_studies" id="w">freshman studies</a>.  Freshman Studies at Lawrence is a mandatory two trimester class that panoptically exposes students to notable literature from many fields.  President <a href="/wiki/Nathan_M._Pusey" id="w">Nathan M. Pusey</a> is credited with initiating the program in 1945, although Professor Waples chaired the Freshman Studies Committee and was responsible for actually getting the program off the ground.  The program has continued to this day, despite being temporarily suspended in 1974, and has been adapted by many liberal arts colleges.</p>
<a id="Milwaukee-Downer_traditions" name="Milwaukee-Downer_traditions"></a><h1>Milwaukee-Downer traditions</h1>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Traditions" id="w">traditions</a> and heritage of Milwaukee-Downer are woven into the Appleton campus, from the grove of <a href="/wiki/Crataegus" id="w">hawthorn</a> trees (called Hawthornden) between Brokaw and Colman halls, to the <a href="/wiki/Sundial" id="w">sundial</a> on the back of Main Hall, to the bestowing upon each class year a class color and banner.  Milwaukee-Downer alumnae are generous both financially and spiritually to Lawrence University, attending yearly <a href="/wiki/Class_reunion" id="w">reunions</a> and other events there, and contributing to the school&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Financial_endowment" id="w">endowment</a>.  The State of Wisconsin purchased the Milwaukee-Downer property and buildings to expand the campus of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin-Milwaukee" id="w">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a>.  When the University had separate offices for a &#34;Dean of Women&#34; and a &#34;Dean of Men&#34;, the officer overseeing women students was called the &#34;Dean of Downer.&#34;  That title is still born by the senior woman on the faculty, but her only duty now is carrying the Downer mace in academic processions.  For many years the women&#39;s choir was called the Downer Chorus.  At one time the BA was conferred upon women in the name of &#34;Downer College of Lawrence University&#34; and upon men in the name of &#34;Lawrence College of Lawrence University&#34;; now all BA degrees are conferred in the name of &#34;Lawrence &#38; Downer Colleges of Lawrence University.&#34;</p>

The college is known for its small classes and the emphasis on undergraduate education. Lawrence&#39;s is the only music conservatory devoted solely to the education of undergraduates. </p>
<p>Lawrence is also regarded as a &#34;Best Value&#34; by the Princeton Review; other sources also point out the college&#39;s value when compared to other colleges of its kind. Tuition and room and board fees at Lawrence are far lower than at comparable schools (the comprehensive fee is $38,445, which is not much more than tuition alone at many similar schools). Also, the school has a strong <a href="/wiki/Financial_aid" id="w">financial aid</a> program: it is one of the few colleges in America having <a href="/wiki/Need-blind" id="w">need-blind</a> admissions, and the college awards both need and merit-based financial aid to over 93% of its students.</p>
<p>The College is less selective than most institutions of its kind, admitting over 53% of its applicants. Thus, it is included in <a href="/wiki/Loren_Pope" id="w">Loren Pope</a>&#39;s, <i><a href="/wiki/Colleges_That_Change_Lives" id="w">Colleges That Change Lives</a></i>, a book highlighting schools that are comparable to the most selective colleges in the country in quality, but far less selective. <a href="/wiki/Whitman_College" id="w">Whitman College</a>, <a href="/wiki/Reed_College" id="w">Reed College</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beloit_College" id="w">Beloit College</a>, <a href="/wiki/St._John%26%2339%3Bs_College" id="w">St. John&#39;s College</a> and <a href="/wiki/Clark_University" id="w">Clark University</a> are some of the others included.</p>

Unlike most colleges, Lawrence University operates on a <a href="/wiki/Academic_term" id="w">trimester</a> calendar. A complete academic year runs from late September to mid-June.</p>
<p>The student/faculty ratio at Lawrence is 9:1, much lower than the national average, this allows for small class sizes and individual attention from professors. </p>
<p>Lawrence awards Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Music degrees. A <a href="/wiki/Double_degree" id="w">double degree</a> is possible and double degree students are common. Lawrence offers a number of cooperative degree programs such as <a href="/wiki/Engineering" id="w">engineering</a> and <a href="/wiki/Environmental_studies" id="w">environmental studies</a>.</p>
<p>Lawrence has major programs in most areas of study found at <a href="/wiki/Liberal_arts" id="w">liberal arts</a> colleges in the United States. The school also offers the option of <a href="/wiki/Interdisciplinary" id="w">interdisciplinary</a> majors and allows students to create their own majors.  All students are required to take Freshman Studies, which introduces students to broad areas of knowledge and provides a common academic experience for the entire school.</p>
<p>The school has an independent study option that allows students to design their own courses. The option allows students to explore academic interests not covered by Lawrence’s classes or to explore topics more deeply. Over 90% of the students take advantage of this option.</p>
<p>Academic integrity is maintained by the college’s <a href="/wiki/Honor_code" id="w">honor code</a>. The Honor Code ensures that the focus of students is on learning, not competing with other students.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, Lawrence University began the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.lawrence.edu/dept/fellows/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.lawrence.edu/dept/fellows/">Lawrence Fellows Program</a>, selecting initially eight recent Ph.D.s to teach and research at Lawrence for a period of two to three years. The goal is to expand the program to twenty recent Ph.D.s.</p>
<a id="Athletics" name="Athletics"></a><h1>Athletics</h1>
<p>In 2005/06, the Lawrence University men&#39;s basketball team&#39;s record was 25-1, and was ranked number one in <a href="/wiki/NCAA_Division_III" id="w">NCAA Division III</a> for much of the season after starting the season unranked.  The team was the only undefeated team in all divisions of college basketball for the last six weeks of the season.  Star forward Chris Braier won the Josten&#39;s Award as the top player in the country, an award for both playing ability and community service. Coach John Tharp was named Division III Midwest Coach of the Year.  Excitement among fans caused attendance to increase to capacity for home games, causing local fire officials to demand that Lawrence cap attendance for the NCAA tournament games that Lawrence would host.  The university decided to issue passes to attendees.</p>
