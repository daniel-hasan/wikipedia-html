<p><b>Bruno de Heceta (Hezeta) y Dudagoitia</b> (<a href="/wiki/1744" id="w">1744</a>-<a href="/wiki/1807" id="w">1807</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spanish</a> explorer of the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest" id="w">Pacific Northwest</a>.  Born in <a href="/wiki/Bilbao" id="w">Bilbao</a>, he was sent by the <a href="/wiki/Viceroy" id="w">viceroy</a> of <a href="/wiki/New_Spain" id="w">New Spain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Antonio_Mar%C3%ADa_Bucareli_y_Urs%C3%BAa" id="w">Antonio María Bucareli y Ursúa</a>, to explore the area north of <a href="/wiki/Alta_California" id="w">Alta California</a> in response to rumors that there were <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russian</a> settlements there.</p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h1>Background</h1>
<p>The Spanish claim to Alaska and the Pacific Northwest had dated back to a 1493 papal bull (<a href="/wiki/Inter_caetera" id="w">Inter caetera</a>) and rights contained in the 1494 <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Tordesillas" id="w">Treaty of Tordesillas</a>; these two formal acts gave Spain the exclusive rights to colonize all of the Western Hemisphere (excluding Brazil), including the exclusive rights to colonize all of the <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_west_coast_of_North_America" id="w">the west coast of North America</a>. The first European expedition to actually reach the west coast of North America was led by the Spaniard <a href="/wiki/Vasco_N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez_de_Balboa" id="w">Vasco Núñez de Balboa</a>, which achieved the Pacific coast of <a href="/wiki/Panama" id="w">Panama</a> in 1513. Balboa claimed the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a> for the Spanish Crown, as well as the lands touching it, including all of the west coast of North America. This action of Balboa further solidified the Spanish claim of exclusive control over the entire west coast of North America.</p>
<p>Confident of their claims, the Spanish Empire did not explore or settle the northwest coast of North America in the 250 years after Balboa&#39;s claim.  By the late 1700s, however, learning of <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" id="w">Russian Empire</a> and <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British</a> arrivals along the Pacific coast, Spain finally grew sufficiently concerned about their claims to the Pacific Northwest and set out to learn the extent of the Russian and British encroachment.</p>
<a id="Exploring_expedition" name="Exploring_expedition"></a><h1>Exploring expedition</h1>
<p>A first expedition (with just one ship, a frigate) led by <a href="/wiki/Juan_Jos%C3%A9_P%C3%A9rez_Hern%C3%A1ndez" id="w">Juan José Pérez Hernández</a> in <a href="/wiki/1774" id="w">1774</a> did not reach as far north as planned.  Thus, when a small group of officials from Spain reached the naval base of <a href="/wiki/San_Blas%2C_Nayarit" id="w">San Blas</a>, <a href="/wiki/M%C3%A9xico" id="w">México</a>, the viceroy placed one of these, Heceta, in charge of a second expedition; this second expedition was to have two ships, including one smaller ship that could explore in shallower waters.  </p>
<p>Accompanying Heceta was the escort and supply ship <i>Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe</i> (generally known as the <i>Señora</i>), initially under the command of <a href="/wiki/Juan_Manuel_de_Ayala" id="w">Juan Manuel de Ayala</a>. The 37 foot (11 m) <a href="/wiki/Schooner" id="w">schooner</a> and its crew complement of 16 were to perform coastal reconnaissance and mapping, and could make landfall in places the larger <i>Santiago</i> was unable to approach on its previous voyage; in this way, the expedition could officially lay claim to the lands north of Mexico it visited.</p>
<p>The two ships sailed together as far north as <a href="/wiki/Point_Grenville%2C_Washington" id="w">Point Grenville, Washington</a>, named <i>Punta de los Martires</i> (or &#34;Point of the Martyrs&#34;) by Hezeta in response to an attack by the local <a href="/wiki/Quinault_(tribe)" id="w">Quinault</a> <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Indians</a>.</p>
<p>He was the first European to sight the mouth of the <a href="/wiki/Columbia_River" id="w">Columbia River</a>. On his return journey south, with only the <i>Santiago</i> and a reduced crew, Heceta discovered a large bay penetrating far inland. He tried to sail in but the strong currents prevented it, even under a full press of sails. His crew was so reduced that they could not handle the anchor so he could not easily wait for better conditions. He wrote that the seething currents led him to believe it was the mouth of a great river or a passage to another sea. Later he guessed it to be the <a href="/wiki/Strait_of_Juan_de_Fuca" id="w">Strait of Juan de Fuca</a>. He named the entrance bay <i>Bahia de la Asunciõn</i> and produced a map of what he could discern from outside the <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Bar" id="w">Columbia Bar</a>. Later Spanish maps often showed the Columbia River&#39;s estuary with the name <i>Entrada de Hezeta</i>, <i>Rio de San Roque</i>, and similar variants.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>By design, the vessels parted company on the evening of <a href="/wiki/July_30" id="w">July 30</a>, 1775 with the <i>Santiago</i> continuing to what is today the border between Washington state and <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>. The <i>Señora</i> (now with second officer <a href="/wiki/Juan_Francisco_de_la_Bodega_y_Quadra" id="w">Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra</a> at the helm) moved up the coast according to its orders, ultimately reaching a position at Latitude 59° North on <a href="/wiki/August_15" id="w">August 15</a>, entering <a href="/wiki/Sitka_Sound" id="w">Sitka Sound</a> near the present-day town of <a href="/wiki/Sitka_City_and_Borough%2C_Alaska" id="w">Sitka, Alaska</a>. It is there that the Spaniards performed numerous &#34;acts of <a href="/wiki/Sovereignty" id="w">sovereignty</a>,&#34; naming and claiming Puerto de Bucareli (<a href="/wiki/Bucareli_Sound" id="w">Bucareli Sound</a>), Puerto de los Remedios, and Mount San Jacinto, renamed <a href="/wiki/Mount_Edgecumbe_(Alaska)" id="w">Mount Edgecumbe</a> by <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> explorer <a href="/wiki/James_Cook" id="w">James Cook</a> three years later. </p>
<p>Throughout the voyage, the crews of both vessels endured many hardships, including food shortages and scurvy. On <a href="/wiki/September_8" id="w">September 8</a>, the ships rejoined and headed south for the return trip to San Blas.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Heceta returned to <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>, fighting in various naval battles against <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> and <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">Great Britain</a>.  He died in <a href="/wiki/1807" id="w">1807</a> with the rank of the <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_general" id="w">lieutenant general</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Heceta_Head" id="w">Heceta Head</a>, on the coast of <a href="/wiki/Oregon" id="w">Oregon</a>, is named after him.  It is the location of the <a href="/wiki/Heceta_Head_Light" id="w">Heceta Head Light</a>.</p>
