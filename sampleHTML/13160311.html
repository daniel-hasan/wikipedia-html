The <b>Airborne Real-time Cueing Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance</b>, also known by the acronym <b>ARCHER</b>, is an aerial imaging system that produces ground images far more detailed than plain sight or ordinary <a href="/wiki/Aerial_photography" id="w">aerial photography</a> can.<sup id="_ref-Friess_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Friess" title="">[1]</a></sup>
It is the most sophisticated unclassified hyperspectral imaging system available, according to U.S. Government officials.<sup id="_ref-AFNORTH_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AFNORTH" title="">[2]</a></sup>
ARCHER can automatically scan detailed imaging for a given signature of the object being sought (such as a missing aircraft),<sup id="_ref-Fiorino_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fiorino" title="">[3]</a></sup>
for abnormalities in the surrounding area, or for changes from previous recorded spectral signatures.<sup id="_ref-Goodlin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Goodlin" title="">[4]</a></sup>

<p>ARCHER is a daytime non-invasive technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings.<sup id="_ref-Alexa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alexa" title="">[5]</a></sup> The system uses a special camera facing down through a <a href="/wiki/Quartz_glass" id="w">quartz glass</a> portal in the belly of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500 feet (800 meters) and 100 <a href="/wiki/Knots_(speed)" id="w">knots</a> (50 meters/second) ground speed.<sup id="_ref-Alexa2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alexa2" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The system software was developed by Space Computer Corporation of <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles%2C_California" id="w">Los Angeles, California</a> and the system hardware is supplied by NovaSol Corp. of <a href="/wiki/Honolulu%2C_Hawaii" id="w">Honolulu, Hawaii</a> specifically for CAP.<sup id="_ref-Alexa_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alexa" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Stevenson2005_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stevenson2005" title="">[7]</a></sup>  The ARCHER system is based on hyperspectral technology research and testing previously undertaken by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Naval_Research_Laboratory" id="w">United States Naval Research Laboratory</a> (NRL) and <a href="/wiki/Air_Force_Research_Laboratory" id="w">Air Force Research Laboratory</a> (AFRL).<sup id="_ref-Stevenson2005_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stevenson2005" title="">[7]</a></sup> 
CAP developed ARCHER in cooperation with the NRL, AFRL and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard_Research_%26amp%3B_Development_Center" id="w">United States Coast Guard Research &#38; Development Center</a> in the largest interagency project CAP has undertaken in its 63-year history.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

In searches in Georgia and Maryland during 2007, ARCHER located the aircraft wreckage, but both accidents had no survivors, according to Col. Drew Alexa, director of advanced technology, and the ARCHER program manager at CAP.<sup id="_ref-Friess_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Friess" title="">[1]</a></sup> An ARCHER equipped aircraft from the <a href="/wiki/Utah" id="w">Utah</a> Wing of the Civil Air Patrol was used in the search for adventurer <a href="/wiki/Steve_Fossett" id="w">Steve Fossett</a> in September 2007.<sup id="_ref-Fiorino_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fiorino" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> As of September 11, 2007 it had not located Mr. Fossett, but was instrumental in uncovering eight previously uncharted crash sites in the high desert area of <a href="/wiki/Nevada" id="w">Nevada</a>,<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>

<p>Col. Alexa described the system to the press in 2007: &#34;The human eye sees basically three bands of light. The ARCHER sensor sees 50. It can see things that are anomalous in the vegetation such as metal or something from an airplane wreckage.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Friess_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Friess" title="">[1]</a></sup> Major Cynthia Ryan of the <a href="/wiki/Nevada" id="w">Nevada</a> Civil Air Patrol, while also describing the system to the press in 2007, stated, &#34;ARCHER is essentially something used by the geosciences. It&#39;s pretty sophisticated stuff … beyond what the human eye can generally see,&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>  She elaborated further, &#34;It might see boulders, it might see trees, it might see mountains, sagebrush, whatever, but it goes &#39;not that&#39; or &#39;yes, that&#39;. The amazing part of this is that it can see as little as 10 per cent of the target, and extrapolate from there.&#34;<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the primary search and rescue mission, CAP has also tested additional uses for ARCHER.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> For example, an ARCHER equipped CAP GA8 was used in a pilot project in <a href="/wiki/Missouri" id="w">Missouri</a> in August 2005 to assess the suitability of the system for tracking <a href="/wiki/Hazardous_material" id="w">hazardous material</a> releases into the environment,<sup id="_ref-MoDNR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MoDNR" title="">[18]</a></sup> and one was deployed to track <a href="/wiki/Oil_spill" id="w">oil spills</a> in the aftermath of <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Rita" id="w">Hurricane Rita</a> in <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a> during September 2005.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<p>As the ARCHER aircraft flies over a search area, reflected <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" id="w">sunlight</a> is collected by the HSI camera lens. The collected light passes through a set of lenses that focus the light to form an image of the ground. The imaging system uses a pushbroom approach to image acquisition. With the pushbroom approach, the focusing slit reduces the image height to the equivalent of one pixel. This thin, wide beam is projection onto a diffraction grating, which is a very finely etched reflecting surface that disperses light into its spectra. </p>
<p>The dispersed light is spread across a <a href="/wiki/Charge-coupled_device" id="w">charge-coupled device</a> (CCD) similar to the image receptor in a typical digital camera, except that this CCD is also sensitive to the near infrared wavelengths up to 1100 nm. The CCD collects the spectral intensities of the dispersed light and converts them to electrical signals. The CCD output consists of electrical signals for 52 spectral bands for each of 504 image pixels. The on-board computer records the CCD output signal at a frame rate of sixty times each second. At an aircraft altitude of 2,500 ft AGL and a speed of 100 knots, a 60 Hz frame rate equates to a ground image resolution of approximately one square meter per pixel. Thus, every frame captured from the CCD contains the spectral data for a ground swath that is approximately one meter long and 500 meters wide.<sup id="_ref-test_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-test" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

</p><a id="High-resolution_imager" name="High-resolution_imager"></a><h2>High-resolution imager</h2>
<p>A high-resolution imaging (HRI) black-and-white, or panchromatic, camera is mounted adjacent to the HSI camera to enable both cameras to capture the same reflected light. The HRI camera uses a pushbroom approach just like the HSI camera with a similar lens and slit arrangement to limit the incoming light to a thin, wide beam. However, the HRI camera does not have a diffraction grating to disperse the incoming reflected light. Instead, the light is directed to a wider CCD to capture more image data. Because it captures a single line of the ground image per frame, it is called a line scan camera. The HRI CCD is 6,144 pixels wide and one pixel high. It operates at a frame rate of 720 Hz. At ARCHER search speed and altitude (100 knots over the ground at 2,500 ft AGL) each pixel in the black-and-white image represents a 3 inch by 3 inch area of the ground. This high resolution adds the capability to identify some objects.<sup id="_ref-test_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-test" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Processing" name="Processing"></a><h2>Processing</h2>
<p>A monitor in the cockpit displays detailed images in real time, and the system also logs the image and <a href="/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" id="w">Global Positioning System</a> data at a rate of 30 <a href="/wiki/Gigabyte" id="w">Gigabytes</a> (GB) per hour for later analysis.<sup id="_ref-Friess_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Friess" title="">[1]</a></sup> The on-board data processing system performs numerous real-time processing functions including <a href="/wiki/Data_acquisition" id="w">data acquisition</a> and recording, raw data correction, target detection, cueing and chipping, precision image <a href="/wiki/Georeference" id="w">geo-registration</a>, and display and dissemination of image products and target cue information.<sup id="_ref-Stevenson2005_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stevenson2005" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>ARCHER has three methods for locating targets: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>signature matching</i> where reflected light is matched to spectral signatures</li>
<li><i>anomaly detection</i> using a statistical model of the <a href="/wiki/Pixel" id="w">pixels</a> in the image to determine the probability that a pixel does not match the profile,<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>and </li>
<li><i>change detection</i> which executes a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the current image against ground conditions that were obtained in a previous mission over the same area. </li></ul>
<p>In change detection, scene changes are identified, and new, moved or departed targets are highlighted for evaluation.<sup id="_ref-AFNORTH_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AFNORTH" title="">[2]</a></sup> In spectral signature matching, the system can be programmed with the parameters of a missing aircraft, such as paint colors, to alert the operators of possible wreckage.<sup id="_ref-Fiorino_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fiorino" title="">[3]</a></sup> It can also be used to look for specific materials, such as petroleum products or other chemicals released into the environment,<sup id="_ref-MoDNR_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MoDNR" title="">[18]</a></sup> or even ordinary items like commonly available blue <a href="/wiki/Polyethylene" id="w">polyethylene</a> <a href="/wiki/Tarpaulin" id="w">tarpaulins</a>. In an impact assessment role, information on the location of blue tarps used to temporarily repair buildings damaged in a storm can help direct disaster relief efforts; in a counterdrug role, a blue tarp located in a remote area could be associated with illegal activity.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
