<b>Tropical Storm Keith</b> was the latest <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane" id="w">Atlantic</a> <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical cyclone</a> to strike the continental <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> since a hurricane in <a href="/wiki/1925_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1925</a>.<sup id="_ref-hurdat_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hurdat" title="">[1]</a></sup> The eleventh tropical storm of the <a href="/wiki/1988_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1988 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Keith developed out of a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_17" id="w">November 17</a>. It tracked northwestward, and under generally favorable conditions reached a peak intensity of 70&#160;mph (110&#160;km/h) shortly before striking the northeastern tip of the <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula" id="w">Yucatán Peninsula</a>. It turned northeastward in the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a>, and made <a href="/wiki/Landfall_(meteorology)" id="w">landfall</a> near <a href="/wiki/Sarasota%2C_Florida" id="w">Sarasota, Florida</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_23" id="w">November 23</a>. Keith accelerated its forward motion under the influence of a <a href="/wiki/Surface_weather_analysis" id="w">cold front</a>, and became <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" id="w">extratropical</a> near <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_24" id="w">November 24</a>. The extratropical remnant persisted for two more days.</p>
<p>Early in its duration, Keith produced moderate to heavy rainfall in <a href="/wiki/Honduras" id="w">Honduras</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" id="w">Jamaica</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>. Minimal damage was reported in <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>, which was still recovering from the devastating effects of <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Gilbert" id="w">Hurricane Gilbert</a> two months prior. Keith, the last of four named <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane" id="w">tropical cyclones</a> to hit the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> during the season, produced moderate rainfall, rough storm surge, and gusty winds across central <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>. Overall damage was widespread but fairly minor, totaling about $7.3&#160;million (1988&#160;USD, $12.7&#160;million 2007&#160;USD). Near the coast, damage occurred mainly from storm surge and beach erosion, while further inland, flooding and downed trees and power lines were the extent of the damage. No fatalities were reported.</p>

A <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> moved off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_5" id="w">November 5</a>. It tracked steadily westward across the tropical <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a>, and slowed its forward motion after passing the <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Antilles" id="w">Lesser Antilles</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_12" id="w">November 12</a>. A large and well-defined <a href="/wiki/Anticyclone" id="w">anticyclone</a> persisted across much of the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a>, providing a favorable environment for the system. A low-level circulation gradually became evident on satellite imagery within the disturbance, and based on <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_observation" id="w">ship reports</a> it is estimated the system organized into a tropical depression on <a href="/wiki/November_17" id="w">November 17</a> while located about 280&#160;miles (450&#160;km) south of the western tip of <a href="/wiki/Haiti" id="w">Haiti</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Initially, the depression was disorganized as it continued westward; on <a href="/wiki/November_18" id="w">November 18</a> the center became exposed from the deep <a href="/wiki/Convection" id="w">convection</a>. However, the upper-level environment gradually became more favorable for further development, and deep convection developed closer to the center. On <a href="/wiki/November_19" id="w">November 19</a>, an eastward moving upper-level <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a> turned the depression to the northwest. The next day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm while located a short distance north of <a href="/wiki/Honduras" id="w">Honduras</a>, receiving the name <i><a href="/wiki/Keith_(given_name)" id="w">Keith</a></i>. Keith quickly intensified, and on <a href="/wiki/November_21" id="w">November 21</a> the storm attained its peak strength of 985&#160;<a href="/wiki/Bar_(unit)" id="w">mbar</a> and 70&#160;mph (110&#160;km/h) winds. The trough which turned Keith northwestward rapidly accelerated northeastward; this left the storm moving slowly to the northwest until making <a href="/wiki/Landfall_(meteorology)" id="w">landfall</a> on the northeastern tip of the <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula" id="w">Yucatán Peninsula</a> at 0800&#160;<a href="/wiki/UTC" id="w">UTC</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_21" id="w">November 21</a> just shy of hurricane status.<sup id="_ref-tcr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>After briefly moving over land, Keith turned northward under the influence of a trailing <a href="/wiki/Surface_weather_analysis" id="w">frontal trough</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup> The storm became disorganized while recurving northeastward, both due to the effects of increased vertical <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a> and the circulation absorbing cool, dry air from its north. On <a href="/wiki/November_23" id="w">November 23</a>, Keith struck near <a href="/wiki/Sarasota%2C_Florida" id="w">Sarasota, Florida</a> with winds of 65&#160;mph (100&#160;km/h), while most of its convection was located well to the north of the center. It quickly weakened while crossing the state; within hours the winds dropped to minimal tropical storm status. After reaching the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> 8&#160;hours after moving ashore, Keith began to gradually reintensify, and under the influence of a very large upper-level low over <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)" id="w">Newfoundland</a> the storm accelerated northeastward. On <a href="/wiki/November_24" id="w">November 24</a>, the storm again reached its peak intensity shortly before becoming an <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" id="w">extratropical cyclone</a> a short distance of <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>. Keith restrengthened and deepened into a powerful extratropical cyclone, attaining hurricane force winds and a minimum pressure of 945&#160;<a href="/wiki/Bar_(unit)" id="w">mbar</a>. The extratropical storm turned westward and lost its identity to the northeast of Newfoundland on <a href="/wiki/November_26" id="w">November 26</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

On <a href="/wiki/November_20" id="w">November 20</a>, shortly before the tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm, the government of <a href="/wiki/Honduras" id="w">Honduras</a> issued a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">tropical storm warning</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Swan_Islands%2C_Honduras" id="w">Swan Islands</a>, along with a tropical storm watch for the northwestern coastline and three islands. The watches and warnings were dropped within 10&#160;hours after Keith passed the area.<sup id="_ref-tcr13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr13" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The government of <a href="/wiki/Belize" id="w">Belize</a> briefly issued a tropical storm watch for the entire coastline of the country, though when the motion of Keith became more apparent, the watch was canceled. About 16&#160;hours before the storm made landfall on the <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula" id="w">Yucatán Peninsula</a>, the government of <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a> issued a tropical storm watch for much of the coastline of <a href="/wiki/Quintana_Roo" id="w">Quintana Roo</a>. Six hours later, a tropical storm warning replaced the watch, and was extended along westward to <a href="/wiki/Progreso%2C_Yucat%C3%A1n" id="w">Progreso, Yucatán</a>, with a hurricane watch issued as well.<sup id="_ref-tcr13_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr13" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuban</a> officials issued a bulletin on the night of <a href="/wiki/November_20" id="w">November 20</a>, warning that tropical storm conditions would spread over the western portion of the island. A subsequent bulletin indicated the possibility for hurricane conditions, though as the storm continued further to the northwest the threat diminished.<sup id="_ref-tcr13_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr13" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Two days before the storm struck Florida, emergency management workers first began working to prepare for the storm.<sup id="_ref-spt1121_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt1121" title="">[5]</a></sup> The next day, state water officials ordered to decrease the water levels in five lakes in <a href="/wiki/Hillsborough_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Hillsborough County</a> as a precaution.<sup id="_ref-spt1122_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt1122" title="">[6]</a></sup> Residents prepared sandbags to prevent flooding along coastal areas, while boat owners worked to secure their boats. Some tourists near the southwest Florida coast left for areas further inland, though many stayed despite the storm.<sup id="_ref-spt1123_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt1123" title="">[7]</a></sup> Red Cross officials opened 6 emergency shelters as a precaution.<sup id="_ref-spt1123c_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt1123c" title="">[8]</a></sup> Additionally, police departments in <a href="/wiki/Clearwater%2C_Florida" id="w">Clearwater</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indian_Shores%2C_Florida" id="w">Indian Shores</a> and <a href="/wiki/Largo%2C_Florida" id="w">Largo</a> expanded their workforce to handle storm-related problems.<sup id="_ref-stp1123b_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stp1123b" title="">[9]</a></sup> The passage of the storm resulted in the closure of some private schools as well as the <a href="/wiki/Hillsborough_Community_College" id="w">Hillsborough Community College</a>.<sup id="_ref-spt1123c_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spt1123c" title="">[8]</a></sup> About 21&#160;hours before Keith made its final landfall, the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> issued a tropical storm warning along the <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> west coast from <a href="/wiki/Cape_Sable" id="w">Cape Sable</a> to <a href="/wiki/Cedar_Key%2C_Florida" id="w">Cedar Key</a>. The next day, a tropical storm warning was also posted from <a href="/wiki/Jupiter%2C_Florida" id="w">Jupiter</a> northward to <a href="/wiki/Savannah%2C_Georgia" id="w">Savannah, Georgia</a>. A tropical storm warning was briefly issued for <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>, as well.<sup id="_ref-tcr14_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr14" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
