There are currently five <b>institutions of the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" id="w">European Union</a></b> which govern the Union. They are outlined in the <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union" id="w">treaties of the European Union</a> in the following order: the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" id="w">European Parliament</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union" id="w">Council of the European Union</a> (the Council); the <a href="/wiki/European_Commission" id="w">European Commission</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Court_of_Justice_of_the_European_Communities" id="w">Court of Justice of the European Communities</a> and the <a href="/wiki/European_Court_of_Auditors" id="w">European Court of Auditors</a>.<sup id="_ref-Consolidated Treaty_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Consolidated Treaty" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Most EU institutions were created with the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community" id="w">European Coal and Steel Community</a> (ECSC) in the 1950s. Much change since then has been in the context the shifting of the power balance away from the Council and towards the Parliament. The role of the Commission has often been to mediate between the two or tip the balance.<sup id="_ref-Hoskyns_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hoskyns" title="">[2]</a></sup> However the Commission is becoming more accountable to the Parliament: in 1999 it forced the resignation of the <a href="/wiki/Santer_Commission" id="w">Santer Commission</a><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> and forced a reshuffle of the proposed <a href="/wiki/Barroso_Commission" id="w">Barroso Commission</a> in 2004.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The development of the institutions, with incremental changes from treaties and agreements, is testament to the evolution of the Union&#39;s structures without one clear &#34;master plan&#34;. Some such as Tom Reid of the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Post" id="w">Washington Post</a> said of the institutions that &#34;nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU&#34;.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The new <a href="/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty" id="w">Lisbon Treaty</a> is a further attempt to modify the institutions (see below) after the Constitution, which would have replaced all previous treaties, was rejected.<sup id="_ref-RT BBC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RT BBC" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Establishment" name="Establishment"></a><h3>Establishment</h3>
<p>The first institutions were created at the start of the 1950s with the creation of the ECSC, based on the <a href="/wiki/Schuman_declaration" id="w">Schuman declaration</a>, between <a href="/wiki/European_Union_member_state" id="w">six states</a>. The ECSC was designed to bring the markets of <a href="/wiki/Coal" id="w">Coal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Steel" id="w">Steel</a>, the materials needed to wage war, under the control of a <a href="/wiki/Supranational" id="w">supranational</a> authority with the aim of encouraging peace and economic development. It established the first institutions. At its core was an independent <a href="/wiki/Executive" id="w">executive</a> called the &#34;High Authority&#34; with supranational powers over the Community. The laws made by the Authority would be observed by a Court of Justice in order to ensure they were upheld and to arbitrate.<sup id="_ref-Europa ECSC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa ECSC" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the negotiations, two supervisory institutions were put forward to counter balance the power of the High Authority. The &#34;Common Assembly&#34; proposed by <a href="/wiki/Jean_Monnet" id="w">Jean Monnet</a> to act as a monitor, counterweight and to add democratic legitimacy was composed of 78 national parliamentarians.<sup id="_ref-ENA Parliament_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENA Parliament" title="">[8]</a></sup> The second was the Council of Ministers, pushed by the smaller states also to add an <a href="/wiki/Intergovernmental" id="w">intergovernmental</a> element and harmonise national polices with those of the authority.<sup id="_ref-ENA Council_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENA Council" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Changes" name="Changes"></a><h3>Changes</h3>
<p>In 1957 the <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_Rome" id="w">Treaties of Rome</a> established two, similar, communities creating a common market (<a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community" id="w">European Economic Community</a>) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (<a href="/wiki/Euratom" id="w">Euratom</a>). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however they had a separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in these Communities. The reason for this is the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.<sup id="_ref-ENA Merger_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENA Merger" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ENA Council_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENA Council" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ENA Commission_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENA Commission" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The three communities were later merged in 1967, by the <a href="/wiki/Merger_Treaty" id="w">Merger Treaty</a>, into the European Communities. The institutions were carried over from the European Economic Community (making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor of the current Commission).<sup id="_ref-ENA Merger_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENA Merger" title="">[10]</a></sup> Under the Treaties of Rome, the Common Assembly (which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly, and then the European Parliament) was supposed to become elected. However this was delayed by the Council until 1979. Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties.<sup id="_ref-Hoskyns_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hoskyns" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ENA Parliament_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENA Parliament" title="">[8]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty" id="w">Maastricht Treaty</a> also gave further powers to the Council by giving it a key role in the <a href="/wiki/Three_pillars_of_the_European_Union" id="w">two new pillars</a> of the EU which were based on intergovernmental principles.<sup id="_ref-ENA Council_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ENA Council" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Political_institutions" name="Political_institutions"></a><h2>Political institutions</h2>
<p>There are three political institutions which hold the executive and legislative power of the Union. The Council represents governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest.<sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions Commission_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions Commission" title="">[12]</a></sup> Essentially, the Council, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the Commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Parliament and Council, where in most cases both must give their assent. Although the exact nature of this depends upon the <a href="/wiki/European_Union_legislative_procedure" id="w">legislative procedure</a> in use. Once it is approved and signed by both chambers it becomes law.<sup id="_ref-Parliament's powers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Parliament's powers" title="">[13]</a></sup> The Commission&#39;s duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply.<sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions Commission_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions Commission" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The Parliament is the only directly elected body</div></p>
<p>The <i>European Parliament</i> shares the <a href="/wiki/Legislative_branch" id="w">legislative</a> and budgetary authority of the Union with the Council. The Parliament&#39;s <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Parliament" id="w">President</a> (its <a href="/wiki/Speaker_(politics)" id="w">speaker</a>) is <a href="/wiki/Hans-Gert_P%C3%B6ttering" id="w">Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering</a> (<a href="/wiki/European_People%26%2339%3Bs_Party" id="w">EPP</a>), who was elected from the Parliament&#39;s members in 2007.<sup id="_ref-Parliament's powers_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Parliament's powers" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Its 785 <a href="/wiki/Members_of_the_European_Parliament" id="w">members</a> are elected every five years by <a href="/wiki/Universal_suffrage" id="w">universal suffrage</a> and sit according to the <a href="/wiki/Political_spectrum" id="w">political allegiance</a>. They represent nearly 500 million <a href="/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_European_Union" id="w">citizens</a> (the world&#39;s second largest democratic electorate) and form the only directly elected body in the Union. Despite forming one of the <a href="/wiki/Bicameral" id="w">two legislative chambers</a> of the Union, it has weaker powers than the Council in some areas, and does not have <a href="/wiki/Legislative_initiative" id="w">legislative initiative</a>. It does however have powers over the Commission which the Council does not.

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The Council is the main decision making body</div></p>
<p>The <i>Council of the European Union</i> (informally known as the Council of Ministers or just the Council) is a body holding legislative and executive powers and is thus the main decision making body of the Union. Its <a href="/wiki/Presidency_of_the_Council_of_the_European_Union" id="w">Presidency</a> rotates between the <a href="/wiki/European_Union_member_state" id="w">states</a> every six months, but every three Presidencies now cooperate on a common programme. This body is separate from the <a href="/wiki/European_Council" id="w">European Council</a> which is a similar but is composed of national leaders: see below.<sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions Council_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions Council" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic but essentially it is one national <a href="/wiki/Minister_(government)" id="w">minister</a> per state. For example, if agriculture is being discussed, the Council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems. Votes are taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population. In these various forms they share the legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament, and also lead cooperation in the second and third <a href="/wiki/Three_pillars_of_the_European_Union" id="w">pillars</a>: the <a href="/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy" id="w">Common Foreign and Security Policy</a> along with <a href="/wiki/Police_and_Judicial_Co-operation_in_Criminal_Matters" id="w">Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters</a>.<sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions Council_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions Council" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The Commission forms the executive</div></p>
<p>The <i>Commission of the European Communities</i> is the executive arm of the Union. It is a body composed of one appointee from each state, currently twenty-seven, but is designed to be independent of national interests. The body is responsible for drafting all <a href="/wiki/Law_of_the_European_Union" id="w">law of the European Union</a> and has a monopoly over <a href="/wiki/Legislative_initiative" id="w">legislative initiative</a> within the <a href="/wiki/European_Community" id="w">European Community</a> <a href="/wiki/Three_pillars_of_the_European_Union" id="w">pillar</a>. It also deals with the day-to-day running of the Union and has a duty to uphold the law and <a href="/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_Union" id="w">treaties</a> (in this role it is known as the &#34;Guardian of the Treaties&#34;).<sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions Commission_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions Commission" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Commission is led by a <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission" id="w">President</a> who is nominated by the Council (in practice the <a href="/wiki/European_Council" id="w">European Council</a>) and approved by Parliament. The remaining Commissioners are proposed by member states, in consultation with the President, and then have to be approved by the Parliament as a whole before the Commission can take office. The current President is <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Manuel_Barroso" id="w">JosÃ© Manuel Barroso</a> (<a href="/wiki/European_People%26%2339%3Bs_Party" id="w">EPP</a>), <a href="/wiki/Barroso_Commission" id="w">his commission</a> was elected in 2004 and has a mandate until 2009.<sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions Commission_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions Commission" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Acts_and_procedures" name="Acts_and_procedures"></a><h3>Acts and procedures</h3>
<p>{{main}}
There are a number of types of <a href="/wiki/Legislation" id="w">legislation</a> which can be passed. The strongest is a <a href="/wiki/Regulation_(European_Union)" id="w">regulation</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Parliament" id="w">act</a> or <a href="/wiki/Statutory_law" id="w">law</a> which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are <a href="/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)" id="w">directives</a> which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A <a href="/wiki/European_Union_decision" id="w">decision</a> is an instrument which is focused at a particular person/group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue <a href="/wiki/European_Union_recommendation" id="w">recommendations and opinions</a> which are merely non-binding, declarations.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>For these acts, there are three <a href="/wiki/European_Union_legislative_procedure" id="w">EU legislative procedures</a> which are commonly used. They alter the power balance between the Parliament and Council. The <a href="/wiki/Assent_procedure" id="w">assent procedure</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Consultation_procedure" id="w">consultation procedure</a> give the Parliament less control over the legislation providing for a more <a href="/wiki/Unicameral" id="w">unicameral</a> system centred on the Council. Under assent, the Parliament need only accept or reject the proposal. Under consultation the Parliament, and the other advisory bodies, are asked for their opinion and the Parliament may proposed amendments but it cannot block the proposal.<sup id="_ref-decision making_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-decision making" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The most common system used is the <a href="/wiki/Codecision_procedure" id="w">codecision procedure</a> which provides an equal footing between the two bodies. Under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council. They then send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a &#34;common position&#34;. That proposal may either be approved or further amendments may be tabled by the Parliament. If the Council does not approve those, then a &#34;Conciliation Committee&#34; is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a common position. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament again by an <a href="/wiki/Absolute_majority" id="w">absolute majority</a>.<sup id="_ref-decision making_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-decision making" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Parliament's powers_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Parliament's powers" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The Court of Justice has the last word on Union law</div></p>
<p>The <i>Court of Justice of the European Communities</i> (commonly known as the European Court of Justice) is the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_court" id="w">highest court</a> of the Union on matters of <a href="/wiki/Law_of_the_European_Union" id="w">Union law</a> and is composed of 27 judges (one per state) with a President elected from among them (currently <a href="/wiki/Vassilios_Skouris" id="w">Vassilios Skouris</a>). Its role is to ensure that Union law is allied in the same way across all states and to settle legal disputes between institutions or states. It has become a powerful institution as Union law overrides national law. In 2001 it ruled that parts of the <a href="/wiki/Basic_Law_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany" id="w">German Constitution</a> were illegal according to the treaties and had to be amended. This related to the ban on women participating in military combat.<sup id="_ref-BBC DE CONST_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC DE CONST" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions Justice_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions Justice" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Court of Justice is assisted by a lower court called the <i><a href="/wiki/Court_of_First_Instance" id="w">Court of First Instance of the European Communities</a></i> (CFI) and a <a href="/wiki/Civil_Service_Tribunal" id="w">Civil Service Tribunal</a> which are designed to reduce the workload of the main court.<sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions Justice_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions Justice" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Court_of_Auditors" name="Court_of_Auditors"></a><h3>Court of Auditors</h3>
<p>{{main}}
The fifth institution is the <i>European Court of Auditors</i>, which despite its name has no judicial powers like the Court of Justice. Instead, it ensures that <a href="/wiki/Taxpayer" id="w">taxpayer</a> funds from the <a href="/wiki/Budget_of_the_European_Union" id="w">budget of the European Union</a> have been correctly spent. Notably the court provides an <a href="/wiki/Audit_report" id="w">audit report</a> for each financial year to the Council and Parliament. The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission&#39;s handling of the budget. The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.<sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions Auditors_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions Auditors" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is the only institutions not mentioned in the original treaties, being set up in 1975. It was created as an independent institution due to the sensitivity of the issue of fraud in the Union (the anti-fraud agency, <a href="/wiki/OLAF" id="w">OLAF</a>, is also built on its independence). It is composed of one member from each state appointed by the Council every six years. Every three years one of them is elected to be the president of the court, who is currently <a href="/wiki/Hubert_Weber" id="w">Hubert Weber</a>.<sup id="_ref-Europa Institutions Auditors_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Europa Institutions Auditors" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>{{see}}</p>
<p>The Lisbon Treaty outlines a number of changes to the institutional structure of the Union. Largely following the changes proposed in the <a href="/wiki/European_Constitution" id="w">European Constitution</a>, it brings nearly all policy areas (including the budget) under the codecision procedure (renamed &#34;<i>ordinary legislative procedure</i>&#34;), hence increasing the power of the <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" id="w">Parliament</a>.

<p>The size of the Commission (dropping its extended &#34;<i>of the European Communities</i>&#34; name) will shrink and include the <a href="/wiki/High_Representative_for_the_Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy" id="w">High Representative</a> with the appointment of the President more dependent upon the last <a href="/wiki/Elections_in_the_European_Union" id="w">EU elections</a>.

While the EU&#39;s system of governance is largely unique, elements can be compared to other models.

The Swiss consensus-driven system is seen as successfully uniting a state divided by language and religion, although the EU was not directly modelled on the Swiss system despite bearing a number of similarities. The <a href="/wiki/Voting_in_the_Council_of_the_European_Union" id="w">double majority</a> system in the Council means that for legislation to be passed, a vote of approval must represent both a majority of states and a majority of the EU&#39;s population. This system is also used in Switzerland where legislation requires a majority in the <a href="/wiki/National_Council_of_Switzerland" id="w">National Council</a>, representing the people, and a majority of the <a href="/wiki/Swiss_Council_of_States" id="w">Council of States</a>, representing the <a href="/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland" id="w">cantons</a>. The same is true for <a href="/wiki/Referenda" id="w">referenda</a>, although none are held Union-wide in the EU.<sup id="_ref-Swiss Comparison_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Swiss Comparison" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>The European Commission also has a similarity to the <a href="/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Council" id="w">Swiss Federal Council</a> in that both have <a href="/wiki/National_government" id="w">all-party representation</a>. The President of the Federal Council rotates between its members each year, in a fashion similar to that of the EU&#39;s Council Presidency or the future <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Council" id="w">presidency of the European Council</a>. Due to this system of presidency Swiss leaders, like those of the EU, are relatively unknown with national politics viewed as somewhat <a href="/wiki/Technocratic" id="w">technocratic</a> resulting in low <a href="/wiki/Voter_turnout" id="w">voter turnout</a>, in a similar fashion to that of the European Parliament. Other parallels include the jealously guarded powers of <a href="/wiki/European_Union_member_state" id="w">states</a>, the considerable level of <a href="/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union" id="w">translation</a> and the choice of a lesser city as the <a href="/wiki/Capital_city" id="w">capital</a>.<sup id="_ref-Swiss Comparison_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Swiss Comparison" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Further more, <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_European_Union" id="w">executive power in the EU</a> isn&#39;t concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with the division of the European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the duel executive system found in the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_France" id="w">French republic</a> where there is a <a href="/wiki/President_of_France" id="w">President</a> (the Council President) and <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_France" id="w">Prime Minister</a> (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council President does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power, it would lack the prestige of the former.<sup id="_ref-FG Plan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FG Plan" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

<p>The institutions are not concentrated in a single <a href="/wiki/Capital_city" id="w">capital city</a>, they are instead based across three cities, <a href="/wiki/Brussels" id="w">Brussels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Luxembourg_(city)" id="w">Luxembourg</a> and <a href="/wiki/Strasbourg" id="w">Strasbourg</a>.

However some departments of the Commission and meetings of the Council take place in Luxembourg, while the Parliament has its committees and some sessions in Brussels and its <a href="/wiki/Secretariat_of_the_European_Parliament" id="w">secretariat</a> in Luxembourg.

<p><a href="/wiki/Brussels_and_the_European_Union" id="w">Brussel&#39;s hosting of institutions</a> has made it a major centre for the EU.
