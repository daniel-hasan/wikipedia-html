Sandy Linzer and Denny Randell are American songwriters who wrote numerous pop-rock songs in the 1960s, generally working together.

In 1965, Linzer &amp; Randell wrote and produced most of the songs for a R&amp;B girl group named The Toys, including their Top 20 singles &quot;A Lover's Concerto&quot; and &quot;Attack!&quot;

The duo wrote several Top 20 songs for Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, including &quot;Working My Way Back to You,&quot; &quot;Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me),&quot; and (with Bob Crewe) &quot;Let's Hang On!.&quot;Linzer also co-wrote the group's song &quot;Dawn (Go Away),&quot; and Randell later co-wrote (again with Crewe) Valli's &quot;solo&quot; hit &quot;Swearin' To God.&quot;

Among their lesser-known work, Linzer &amp; Randell wrote two songs recorded by The Monkees.They also wrote &quot;Native New Yorker,&quot; performed by Odyssey on the soundtrack of the 1978 film ''Eyes of Laura Mars''; and &quot;Breakin' Down The Walls Of Heartache&quot;, a major UK hit in 1968 for Johnny Johnson and the Bandwagon.

Linzer later co-wrote (with David Wolfert) &quot;I Believe in You and Me,&quot; originally recorded in 1982 by The Four Tops. The song was covered by Whitney Houston for the soundtrack of the 1996 film ''The Preacher's Wife'' and became a #4 hit single.
