<b>Herne Bay</b> is a seaside town in <a href="/wiki/Kent" id="w">Kent</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_East_England" id="w">South East</a> <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, with a population of 35,188. On the south coast of the <a href="/wiki/Thames_Estuary" id="w">Thames Estuary</a>, it is {{convert}} north of <a href="/wiki/Canterbury" id="w">Canterbury</a> and {{convert}} east of <a href="/wiki/Whitstable" id="w">Whitstable</a>. It neighbours the ancient villages of <a href="/wiki/Herne%2C_Kent" id="w">Herne</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reculver" id="w">Reculver</a> and is part of the <a href="/wiki/City_of_Canterbury" id="w">City of Canterbury</a> local government district. Herne Bay&#39;s seafront is home to the world&#39;s first freestanding purpose-built clock tower, built in 1837; until 1978, the town had the second-longest pier in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The town began as a small shipping community, receiving goods and passengers from London en route to Canterbury and <a href="/wiki/Dover" id="w">Dover</a>. The town rose to prominence as a seaside resort during the early 19th century after the building of a pleasure pier and promenade by a group of London investors, and reached its heyday in the late Victorian era. Its popularity as a holiday destination has declined over the past decades, due to the increase in foreign travel and regular flooding that has prevented the town&#39;s redevelopment. However, the recent renovation of the <a href="/wiki/Sea_defences" id="w">sea defences</a> and seafront is expected to re-establish the town as a popular seaside resort.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>The town of Herne Bay derived its name from the neighbouring village of Herne, two kilometres inland from the bay. The word herne, meaning a place on a corner of land, evolved from the Old English <i>hyrne</i>, meaning corner. The village was first recorded in around 1100 as Hyrnan. The <i>corner</i> may relate to the sharp turn in the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Road" id="w">Roman Road</a> between Canterbury and <a href="/wiki/Reculver" id="w">Reculver</a> at Herne.<sup id="_ref-place names_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-place names" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the oldest buildings in Herne Bay is the late 18th-century inn, The Ship, which served as the focal point for the small shipping and farming community which first inhabited the town. During this time, passenger and cargo boats regularly ran between Herne Bay and London, and boats carrying coal ran from <a href="/wiki/Newcastle" id="w">Newcastle</a>. From Herne there was easy access by road to the city of Canterbury, or to Dover, where further passage by boat could then be obtained across the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel" id="w">English Channel</a> to France.<sup id="_ref-Appraisal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Appraisal" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>

The 1801 census recorded Herne Bay, including Herne, as having a population of 1,232.<sup id="_ref-KAS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KAS" title="">[3]</a></sup> During the early 1800s, a smugglers&#39; gang operated from the town.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The gang were regularly involved in a series of fights with the preventive services until finally being overpowered in the 1820s.<sup id="_ref-KAS_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KAS" title="">[3]</a></sup> In the 1830s, a group of London investors, who recognised Herne Bay&#39;s potential as a seaside resort, built a wooden pier and a promenade on the town&#39;s seafront. This and the subsequent building of a railway station led to the rapid expansion of the town; between 1831 and 1841 the town&#39;s population grew from 1,876 to 3,041.<sup id="_ref-KAS_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KAS" title="">[3]</a></sup> The London businessmen intended to rename the town St Augustine&#39;s, but the name was unpopular with residents and the &#34;Herne Bay&#34; remained.<sup id="_ref-mini_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mini" title="">[5]</a></sup> In 1833, an Act of Parliament established Herne Bay and Herne as separate towns.<sup id="_ref-connecting_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-connecting" title="">[6]</a></sup> Local landowner Sir Henry Oxenden donated a piece of ground for the site of the town&#39;s first church,<sup id="_ref-pigot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pigot" title="">[7]</a></sup> Christ Church, which was opened in 1834.<sup id="_ref-Appraisal_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Appraisal" title="">[2]</a></sup> In 1837, Mrs Ann Thwaytes, a wealthy lady from London, donated around £4,000 to build a {{convert}} clock tower on the town&#39;s seafront.<sup id="_ref-pigot_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pigot" title="">[7]</a></sup> It is believed to be the first freestanding purpose built clock tower in the world.<sup id="_ref-Appraisal_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Appraisal" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the 1840s, steamboats began running between Herne Bay and London. There was a type of beach boat unique to Herne Bay and nearby <a href="/wiki/Thanet" id="w">Thanet</a>, known as the Thanet <a href="/wiki/Wherry" id="w">wherry</a>,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> a narrow pulling boat about {{convert}} long. These boats were mainly used for fishing; however, with the advent of tourism and the decline of fishing, they became mainly used for pleasure trips. A document dated 1840 records the town as having the following schools, all of which are now defunct: Haddington boarding school, Oxenden House, British School, Prospect Place and Herne Street school.<sup id="_ref-pigot_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pigot" title="">[7]</a></sup> The village of Herne was often called Herne Street around this time. The same document also mentions the still-existing Rodney Head, The Ship and Upper Red Lion inns.</p>
<p>The original wooden pier had to be dismantled in 1871 after its owners went into liquidation and sea worms had damaged the wood.<sup id="_ref-hbpier_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbpier" title="">[9]</a></sup> A shorter {{convert}} long iron pier with a theatre and shops at the entrance was built in 1873.<sup id="_ref-heritage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage" title="">[10]</a></sup> However, it was too short for steamboats to land at. The pier proved to be unprofitable and a replacement longer iron pier with an electric tram began to be built in 1896. At {{convert}}, this pier was the second longest in the country, behind only the pier at <a href="/wiki/Southend-on-Sea" id="w">Southend-on-Sea</a>.<sup id="_ref-Appraisal_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Appraisal" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

The town&#39;s heyday as a seaside resort was during the late Victorian era; the population nearly doubled from 4,410 to 8,442 between 1881 and 1901.<sup id="_ref-KAS_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KAS" title="">[3]</a></sup> Much of the resulting late Victorian seafront architecture is still in existence today. In 1910, a pavilion was added to the landward end of the pier.<sup id="_ref-heritage_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage" title="">[10]</a></sup> In 1912, the first &#34;Brides in the Bath&#34; murder by <a href="/wiki/George_Joseph_Smith" id="w">George Joseph Smith</a> was committed in Herne Bay.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> By 1931, the town&#39;s population had grown to 14,533. At the beginning of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, the army cut two gaps between the landward end of the pier and the seaward terminal as a counter-invasion measure. The pier was restored however after the war.<sup id="_ref-hbpier_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbpier" title="">[9]</a></sup> During World War II, a <a href="/wiki/Maunsell_Forts" id="w">sea-fort</a> was built off the coast of Herne Bay and Whitstable, which is still in existence. The coastal village of Reculver, to the east of Herne Bay, was the site of the testing of the <a href="/wiki/Bouncing_bomb" id="w">bouncing bomb</a> used by the &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Dam_Busters_(film)" id="w">Dam Busters</a>&#34; during the war.<sup id="_ref-mini_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mini" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>1963 marked the end of steamboat services from the pier.<sup id="_ref-hbpier_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbpier" title="">[9]</a></sup> In 1970, a fire destroyed the pier&#39;s pavilion and plans began to replace it with a sports centre,<sup id="_ref-hbpier_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbpier" title="">[9]</a></sup> which was opened in 1976 by former Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Edward_Heath" id="w">Edward Heath</a>.<sup id="_ref-hbpier_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbpier" title="">[9]</a></sup> The centre section of the pier was torn down by a storm in 1978, leaving the end of the pier isolated out at sea.<sup id="_ref-heritage_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-heritage" title="">[10]</a></sup> It has not been rebuilt due to the cost; however, residents and businesses in the town have campaigned for its restoration.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Cloud Cover captured off the coast of Herne Bay</div> Herne Bay is located at {{coord}} in northeast Kent, on the coast of the <a href="/wiki/Thames_Estuary" id="w">Thames Estuary</a>. The landscape of the town has been largely influenced by the Plenty <a href="/wiki/Stream" id="w">Brook</a>, which flows northward through the centre of the town and into the sea. It is thought to have been a much larger stream in ancient times. The coastline has two distinct <a href="/wiki/Bay" id="w">bays</a>, separated by a jut of land created by silt from the outflow of the brook into the sea. The first buildings in the town were built along the east bay, a short distance from the brook outflow, where the road from <a href="/wiki/Canterbury" id="w">Canterbury</a> met the sea. The town has since spread across both bays, across the Plenty Brook valley and onto the relatively high land flanking both sides of the valley. The land to the east of the valley reaches a height of twenty-five metres above sea level and to the west reaches ten metres. Cliffs are formed where this high land meets the sea. <sup id="_ref-Appraisal_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Appraisal" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

The rising land beside the coast, between the valley and the eastern cliffs, is known as &#39;The Downs&#39; (no relation to the <a href="/wiki/North_Downs" id="w">North</a> or <a href="/wiki/South_Downs" id="w">South Downs</a>). This area has been named a Site of Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area for Birds. The whole of the north east Kent coast has been designated a <a href="/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest" id="w">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Geology" id="w">geology</a> of the town consists mainly of <a href="/wiki/London_Clay" id="w">London Clay</a>, overlaid with brickearth in the west.

<p>The Plenty Brook now passes through the town&#39;s drainage system, allowing buildings to be built over the top.<sup id="_ref-Appraisal_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Appraisal" title="">[2]</a></sup> The brook has been prone to flooding during heavy rain, especially in inland areas, which regularly causes problems for people living in the Eddington area in southern Herne Bay.<sup id="_ref-brook_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brook" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Stormy weather can cause the sea level by the coast to rise by up to two metres. In the past, this has caused disastrous <a href="/wiki/Flood" id="w">flooding</a> in the town, the worst in the town&#39;s history being in 1953. Coastal defences were subsequently constructed including <a href="/wiki/Groyne" id="w">groynes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sea_wall" id="w">sea walls</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shingle_beach" id="w">shingle beach</a>. In the 1990s, these defences were deemed to be inadequate and an offshore <a href="/wiki/Breakwater_(structure)" id="w">breakwater</a>, now known as Neptune&#39;s Arm, was built to protect the most vulnerable areas of the town.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

The advent of overseas travel and changes to holiday trends eventually caused the town&#39;s economy to decline after the 1960s; regular flooding of the Plenty Brook prevented redevelopment of the town centre.<sup id="_ref-connecting_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-connecting" title="">[6]</a></sup> However, extensive seafront regeneration in the 1990s followed the creation of the Neptune&#39;s Arm sea defence jetty. The jetty has created a small harbour used by leisure boats and from where tourists can take sailing yacht trips to a seal-watching site in the Thames estuary. The Victorian gardens on the seafront were then able to be fully restored. The Central Bandstand, built in 1924, was refurbished after years of disrepair and closure to the public. A swimming pool and cinema were added to the town centre in the early 1990s. In 2005, a wind-farm with thirty 2.75&#160;MW wind turbines was built {{convert}} off the coast of Herne Bay and Whitstable, generating a total of 82.5&#160;MW of electricity. The recent upgrades by the Council have helped improve the image of the town and raise its profile. It is hoped this will attract new investment in tourism and business by the private sector, and lead to the regeneration of the town&#39;s economy.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-planning_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-planning" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2006, Canterbury City Council began a public consultation to discuss the regeneration. A concern raised by the council is that the shopping centre is incoherent and fails to attract the tourists that come for the seafront. Other issues raised are the lack of holiday accommodation, car parks and clear pedestrian routes between the three main attractions in the town: the seafront, Memorial park and shopping centre. The council is considering relocating the sports centre from the pier and replacing it with other tourist attractions.<sup id="_ref-connecting_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-connecting" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-planning_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-planning" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
