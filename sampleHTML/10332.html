<p><b>Educational psychology</b> is the study of how <a href="/wiki/Human" id="w">humans</a> learn in <a href="/wiki/Education" id="w">educational</a> settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the <a href="/wiki/Social_psychology" id="w">social psychology</a> of  <a href="/wiki/School" id="w">schools</a> as <a href="/wiki/Organization" id="w">organizations</a>.  Although the terms &#34;educational psychology&#34; and &#34;school psychology&#34; are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as <a href="/wiki/Category:Educational_psychologists" id="w">educational psychologists</a>, whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as <a href="/wiki/School_psychologist" id="w">school psychologists</a>.  Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment among the general population and sub-populations such as <a href="/wiki/Gifted" id="w">gifted</a> children and those subject to specific <a href="/wiki/Disabilities" id="w">disabilities</a>.

Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by <a href="/wiki/Psychology" id="w">psychology</a>, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between <a href="/wiki/Medicine" id="w">medicine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Biology" id="w">biology</a> and also between <a href="/wiki/Engineering" id="w">Engineering</a> and <a href="/wiki/Physics" id="w">Physics</a>. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including <a href="/wiki/Instructional_design" id="w">instructional design</a>, <a href="/wiki/Educational_technology" id="w">educational technology</a>, curriculum development, <a href="/wiki/Organizational_learning" id="w">organizational learning</a>, <a href="/wiki/Special_education" id="w">special education</a> and <a href="/wiki/Classroom_management" id="w">classroom management</a>. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_science" id="w">cognitive science</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Learning_sciences" id="w">learning sciences</a>. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks.<sup id="_ref-lucas_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lucas" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>To understand the characteristics of learners in <a href="/wiki/Child" id="w">childhood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adolescence" id="w">adolescence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adulthood" id="w">adulthood</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Old_age" id="w">old age</a>, educational psychology develops and applies theories of human <a href="/wiki/Developmental_psychology" id="w">development</a>. Often cast as stages through which people pass as they mature, developmental theories describe changes in mental abilities (<a href="/wiki/Cognition" id="w">cognition</a>), social roles, moral reasoning, and beliefs about the nature of knowledge.</p>
<p>For example, educational psychologists have researched the instructional applicability of <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_Development" id="w">Jean Piaget&#39;s theory of development</a>, according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children need to be taught using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur at the same time in all domains. A child may be able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget&#39;s most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.<sup id="_ref-woolfolk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-woolfolk" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Piaget proposed a developmental theory of <a href="/wiki/Moral_reasoning" id="w">moral reasoning</a> in which children progress from a naive understanding of <a href="/wiki/Morality" id="w">morality</a> based on behavior and outcomes to a more advanced understanding based on intentions. Piaget&#39;s views of moral development were elaborated by <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg" id="w">Kohlberg</a> into a <a href="/wiki/Kohlberg%26%2339%3Bs_stages_of_moral_development" id="w">stage theory of moral development</a>. There is evidence that the moral reasoning described in stage theories is not sufficient to account for moral behavior. For example, other factors such as <a href="/wiki/Modelling_(psychology)" id="w">modeling</a> (as described by the <a href="/wiki/Social_cognitive_theory_of_morality" id="w">social cognitive theory of morality</a>) are required to explain <a href="/wiki/Bullying" id="w">bullying</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner" id="w">Rudolf Steiner</a>&#39;s model of <a href="/wiki/Child_development" id="w">child development</a> interrelates physical, emotional, cognitive, and moral development<sup id="_ref-uwe.ac.uk_RR645_1.5_Findings_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uwe.ac.uk_RR645_1.5_Findings" title="">[3]</a></sup> in developmental stages similar to those later described by <a href="/wiki/Jean_Piaget" id="w">Piaget</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Developmental theories are sometimes presented not as shifts between qualitatively different stages, but as gradual increments on separate dimensions. Development of <a href="/wiki/Epistemological" id="w">epistemological</a> beliefs (beliefs about knowledge) have been described in terms of gradual changes in people&#39;s belief in: certainty and permanence of knowledge, fixedness of ability, and credibility of authorities such as teachers and experts.

<p>Each person has an individual profile of characteristics, abilities and challenges that result from learning and development.

<p>Although theories of intelligence have been discussed by philosophers since <a href="/wiki/Plato" id="w">Plato</a>, intelligence testing is an invention of educational psychology, and is coincident with the development of that discipline. Continuing debates about the nature of intelligence revolve on whether intelligence can be characterized by a single, scalar <a href="/wiki/Factor_analysis" id="w">factor</a> (<a href="/wiki/Charles_Spearman" id="w">Spearman&#39;s</a> <a href="/wiki/General_intelligence_factor" id="w">general intelligence)</a>, multiple factors (as in <a href="/wiki/Robert_Sternberg" id="w">Sternberg&#39;s</a> <a href="/wiki/Triarchic_theory_of_intelligence" id="w">triarchic theory of intelligence</a> and <a href="/wiki/Howard_Gardner" id="w">Gardner&#39;s</a> <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences" id="w">theory of multiple intelligences</a>), or whether it can be measured at all. In practice, standardized instruments such as the <a href="/wiki/Stanford-Binet_IQ_test" id="w">Stanford-Binet IQ test</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Wechsler_Intelligence_Scale_for_Children" id="w">WISC</a> are widely used in economically developed countries to identify children in need of individualized educational treatment.

<a id="Learning_and_cognition" name="Learning_and_cognition"></a><h2> Learning and cognition </h2>
<p>Two fundamental assumptions that underlie formal education systems are that students (a) retain knowledge and skills they acquire in school, and (b) can apply them in situations outside the classroom. But are these assumptions accurate? Research has found that, even when students report not using the knowledge acquired in school, a considerable portion is retained for many years and long term retention is strongly dependent on the initial level of mastery.<sup id="_ref-semb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-semb" title="">[6]</a></sup> One study found that university students who took a child development course and attained high grades showed, when tested 10 years later, average retention scores of about 30%, whereas those who obtained moderate or lower grades showed average retention scores of about 20%.<sup id="_ref-ellis_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ellis" title="">[7]</a></sup> There is much less consensus on the crucial question of how much knowledge acquired in school <a href="/wiki/Transfer_of_learning" id="w">transfers</a> to tasks encountered outside formal educational settings, and how such transfer occurs.<sup id="_ref-perkins1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-perkins1" title="">[8]</a></sup> Some psychologists claim that research evidence for this type of <i>far transfer</i> is scarce,<sup id="_ref-perkins2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-perkins2" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-detterman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-detterman" title="">[10]</a></sup> while others claim there is abundant evidence of far transfer in specific domains.<sup id="_ref-halpern_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-halpern" title="">[11]</a></sup>
Several perspectives have been established within which the theories of learning used in educational psychology are formed and contested. These include <a href="/wiki/Behaviorism" id="w">Behaviorism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cognitivism_(psychology)" id="w">Cognitivism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_Cognitivism" id="w">Social Cognitivism</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Constructivism_(pedagogical)" id="w">Constructivism</a>. This section summarizes how educational psychology has researched and applied theories within each of these perspectives.</p>
<a id="Behavioral_perspective" name="Behavioral_perspective"></a><h3>Behavioral perspective</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Applied_Behavior_Analysis" id="w">Applied behavior analysis</a>, a set of techniques based on the behavioral principles of <a href="/wiki/Operant_conditioning" id="w">operant conditioning</a>, is effective in a range of educational settings.<sup id="_ref-Alberto_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alberto" title="">[12]</a></sup> For example, teachers can improve student behavior by systematically rewarding students who follow classroom rules with praise, stars, or tokens exchangeable for sundry items.<sup id="_ref-mcgoey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcgoey" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-theodore_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-theodore" title="">[14]</a></sup> Despite the demonstrated efficacy of awards in changing behavior, their use in education has been criticized by proponents of <a href="/wiki/Self-Determination_Theory" id="w">self-determination theory</a>, who claim that praise and other rewards undermine <a href="/wiki/Intrinsic_motivation" id="w">intrinsic motivation</a>. There is evidence that tangible rewards decrease intrinsic motivation in specific situations, such as when the student already has a high level of intrinsic motivation to perform the goal behavior.<sup id="_ref-lepper_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lepper" title="">[15]</a></sup> But the results showing detrimental effects are counterbalanced by evidence that, in other situations, such as when rewards are given for attaining a gradually increasing standard of performance, rewards enhance intrinsic motivation.<sup id="_ref-cameron_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cameron" title="">[16]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Cognitive_perspective" name="Cognitive_perspective"></a><h3>Cognitive perspective</h3>
<p>Among current educational psychologists, the cognitive perspective is more widely held than the behavioral perspective perhaps because it flexibly admits causally related mental constructs such as <a href="/wiki/Trait_theory" id="w">traits</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beliefs" id="w">beliefs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Memory" id="w">memories</a>, <a href="/wiki/Motivation" id="w">motivations</a> and <a href="/wiki/Emotions" id="w">emotions</a>. Cognitive theories posit memory structures that are thought to determine how information is <a href="/wiki/Perception" id="w">perceived</a>, <a href="/wiki/Information_processing" id="w">processed</a>, stored, <a href="/wiki/Information_retrieval" id="w">retrieved</a> and <a href="/wiki/Forgetting" id="w">forgotten</a>.

The spaced learning effect, a cognitive phenomenon strongly supported by psychological research, has broad applicability within education.<sup id="_ref-dempster_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dempster" title="">[20]</a></sup> For example, students have been found to perform better on a test of knowledge about a text passage when a second reading of the passage is delayed rather than immediate (see figure).<sup id="_ref-krug_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-krug" title="">[19]</a></sup> Educational psychology research has confirmed the applicability to education of other findings from cognitive psychology, such as the benefits of using <a href="/wiki/Mnemonics" id="w">mnemonics</a> for immediate and delayed retention of information.<sup id="_ref-carney_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carney" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Problem_solving" id="w">Problem solving</a>, regarded by many cognitive psychologists as fundamental to learning, is an important research topic in educational psychology. A student is thought to interpret a problem by assigning it to a <a href="/wiki/Schema_(psychology)" id="w">schema</a> retrieved from long term memory. When the problem is assigned to the wrong schema, the student&#39;s attention is subsequently directed away from features of the problem that are inconsistent with the assigned schema.<sup id="_ref-kalyuga_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kalyuga" title="">[22]</a></sup> The critical step of finding a mapping between the problem and a pre-existing schema is often cited as supporting the centrality of <a href="/wiki/Analogy" id="w">analogical</a> thinking to problem solving.</p>
<a id="Social_cognitive_perspective" name="Social_cognitive_perspective"></a><h3> Social cognitive perspective </h3>
<p>Social cognitive theory is a highly influential fusion of behavioral, cognitive and social elements that was initially developed by educational psychologist <a href="/wiki/Albert_Bandura" id="w">Albert Bandura</a>. In its earlier, neo-behavioral incarnation called <i>social learning theory</i>, Bandura emphasized the process of <a href="/wiki/Observational_learning" id="w">observational learning</a> in which a learner&#39;s behavior changes as a result of observing others&#39; behavior and its consequences. The theory identified several factors that determine whether observing a model will affect behavioral or cognitive change. These factors include the learner&#39;s developmental status, the perceived prestige and competence of the model, the consequences received by the model, the relevance of the model&#39;s behaviors and consequences to the learner&#39;s goals, and the learner&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Self-efficacy" id="w">self-efficacy</a>. The concept of self-efficacy, which played an important role in later developments of the theory, refers to the learner&#39;s belief in his or her ability to perform the modeled behavior.</p>
<p>An <a href="/wiki/Experiment" id="w">experiment</a> by Schunk and Hanson,<sup id="_ref-schunk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-schunk" title="">[23]</a></sup> that studied grade 2 students who had previously experienced difficulty in learning <a href="/wiki/Subtraction" id="w">subtraction</a>, illustrates the type of research stimulated by social learning theory. One group of students observed a subtraction demonstration by a teacher and then participated in an instructional program on subtraction. A second group observed other grade 2 students performing the same subtraction procedures and then participated in the same instructional program. The students who observed peer models scored higher on a subtraction post-test and also reported greater confidence in their subtraction ability. The results were interpreted as supporting the <a href="/wiki/Hypothesis" id="w">hypothesis</a> that perceived similarity of the model to the learner increases self-efficacy, leading to more effective learning of modeled behavior. It is supposed that peer modeling is particularly effective for students who have low self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, much research activity in educational psychology has focused on developing theories of <a href="/wiki/Self-regulated_learning" id="w">self-regulated learning</a> (SRL) and <a href="/wiki/Metacognition" id="w">metacognition</a>. These theories work from the central premise that effective learners are active agents who construct knowledge by setting goals, analysing tasks, planning strategies and monitoring their understanding.  Research has indicated that learners&#39; who are better at goal setting and self-monitoring tend to have greater intrinsic task interest and <a href="/wiki/Self-efficacy" id="w">self-efficacy</a>;<sup id="_ref-zimmerman1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-zimmerman1" title="">[24]</a></sup> and that teaching learning strategies can increase academic achievement.<sup id="_ref-hattie_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hattie" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Constructivist_perspective" name="Constructivist_perspective"></a><h3>Constructivist perspective</h3>
<p>{{main}}
{{main}}</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Constructivism_(learning_theory)" id="w">Constructivism</a> refers to a category of learning theories in which emphasis is placed on the agency and prior knowledge of the learner, and often on the social and cultural determinants of the learning process. Educational psychologists distinguish individual (or psychological) constructivism, identified with Piaget&#39;s learning theory, from <a href="/wiki/Social_Constructivism_(Learning_Theory)" id="w">social constructivism</a>. A dominant influence on the latter type is <a href="/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky" id="w">Lev Vygotsky</a>&#39;s work on sociocultural learning, describing how interactions with adults, more capable peers, and cognitive tools are internalized to form mental constructs. Elaborating on Vygotsky&#39;s theory, <a href="/wiki/Jerome_Bruner" id="w">Jerome Bruner</a> and other educational psychologists developed the important concept of <a href="/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding" id="w">instructional scaffolding</a>, in which the social or information environment offers supports for learning that are gradually withdrawn as they become internalized.</p>
<p>Vygotsky&#39;s version of <a href="/wiki/Constructivist_epistemology" id="w">constructivist</a> theory has led to the view that behavior, skills, attitudes and beliefs are inherently <a href="/wiki/Situated_cognition" id="w">situated</a>, that is, bound to a specific sociocultural setting. According to this view, the learner is enculturated through social interactions within a <a href="/wiki/Community_of_practice" id="w">community of practice</a>. The social constructivist view of learning has spawned approaches to teaching and learning such as <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_apprenticeship" id="w">cognitive apprenticeship</a>, in which the tacit components of a complex skill are made explicit through conversational interactions occurring between expert and novice in the setting in which the skill is embedded.<sup id="_ref-collins_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-collins" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Motivation" name="Motivation"></a><h2>Motivation</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Motivation" id="w">Motivation</a> is an internal state that activates, guides and sustains behavior. Educational psychology research on motivation is concerned with the <a href="/wiki/Volition_(psychology)" id="w">volition</a> or <a href="/wiki/Will_(philosophy)" id="w">will</a> that students bring to a task, their level of interest and <a href="/wiki/Intrinsic_motivation" id="w">intrinsic motivation</a>, the personally held <a href="/wiki/Goal_setting" id="w">goals</a> that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure.</p>
<p>A form of <a href="/wiki/Attribution_theory" id="w">attribution theory</a> developed by <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Weiner" id="w">Bernard Weiner</a><sup id="_ref-weiner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-weiner" title="">[27]</a></sup> describes how students&#39; beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of <a href="/wiki/Shame" id="w">shame</a> and <a href="/wiki/Embarrassment" id="w">embarrassment</a> and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of <a href="/wiki/Guilt" id="w">guilt</a> and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.  </p>
<p>Motivational theories also explain how <a href="/wiki/Goal_Theory" id="w">learners&#39; goals</a> affect the way that they engage with academic tasks.<sup id="_ref-elliot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-elliot" title="">[28]</a></sup> Those who have <i>mastery goals</i> strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have <i>performance approach goals</i> strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have <i>performance avoidance</i> goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence in the face of failure, preference for challenging tasks, <a href="/wiki/Creativity" id="w">creativity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Intrinsic_motivation" id="w">intrinsic motivation</a>. Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor <a href="/wiki/Attention" id="w">concentration</a> while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and <a href="/wiki/Anxiety#Test anxiety" id="w">test anxiety</a>. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.</p>
<a id="Research_methodology" name="Research_methodology"></a><h2>Research methodology</h2>
<p>The research methods used in educational psychology tend to be drawn from psychology and other social sciences. There is also a history of significant methodological innovation by educational psychologists, and psychologists investigating educational problems. Research methods address problems in both <a href="/wiki/Design_of_experiments" id="w">research design</a> and <a href="/wiki/Data_analysis" id="w">data analysis</a>. Research design informs the planning of experiments and observational studies to ensure that their results have <a href="/wiki/Internal_validity" id="w">internal</a>, <a href="/wiki/External_validity" id="w">external</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ecological_validity" id="w">ecological validity</a>. Data analysis encompasses methods for processing both quantitive (numerical) and qualitative (non-numerical) research data. Although, historically, the use of quantitative methods was often considered an essential mark of scholarship, modern educational psychology research uses both <a href="/wiki/Quantitative_research" id="w">quantitative</a> and <a href="/wiki/Qualitative_research" id="w">qualitative</a> methods. 
</p><a id="Quantitative_methods" name="Quantitative_methods"></a><h3>Quantitative methods</h3>
<p><div style="wigth:250px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:250px-The_Normal_Distribution.svg.png" title="Test scores and other educational variables often approximate a [[normal distribution]]."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/250px-The_Normal_Distribution.svg.png" alt="Test scores and other educational variables often approximate a [[normal distribution]]." title="Test scores and other educational variables often approximate a [[normal distribution]]." class="location-right type-thumb" width="250px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Test scores and other educational variables often approximate a <a href="/wiki/Normal_distribution" id="w">normal distribution</a>.</div></div>

Perhaps first among the important methodological innovations of educational psychology was the development and application of <a href="/wiki/Factor_analysis" id="w">factor analysis</a> by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Spearman" id="w">Charles Spearman</a>. Factor analysis is mentioned here as one example of the many <a href="/wiki/Multivariate_statistics" id="w">multivariate statistical methods</a> used by educational psychologists. Factor analysis is used to summarize relationships among a large set of variables or test questions, develop theories about mental constructs such as self-efficacy or anxiety, and assess the reliability and validity of test scores.<sup id="_ref-thompson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thompson" title="">[29]</a></sup> Over one hundred years after its introduction by Spearman, factor analysis has become a research staple figuring prominently in educational psychology journals.</p>
<p>Because educational <a href="/wiki/Assessment" id="w">assessment</a> is fundamental to most quantitative research in the field, educational psychologists have made significant contributions to the field of <a href="/wiki/Psychometrics" id="w">psychometrics</a>. For example, <a href="/wiki/Cronbach%26%2339%3Bs_alpha" id="w">alpha</a>, the widely used measure of test <a href="/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)" id="w">reliability</a> was developed by educational psychologist <a href="/wiki/Lee_Cronbach" id="w">Lee Cronbach</a>. The reliability of assessments are routinely reported in quantitative educational research. Although, originally, educational measurement methods were built on <a href="/wiki/Classical_test_theory" id="w">classical test theory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Item_response_theory" id="w">item response theory</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rasch_model" id="w">Rasch models</a> are now used extensively in educational measurement worldwide. These models afford advantages over classical test theory, including the capacity to produce standard errors of measurement for each score or pattern of scores on assessments and the capacity to handle missing responses.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Meta-analysis" id="w">Meta-analysis</a>, the combination of individual research results to produce a quantitative <a href="/wiki/Literature_review" id="w">literature review</a>, is another methodological innovation with a close association to educational psychology. In a meta-analysis, <a href="/wiki/Effect_size" id="w">effect sizes</a> that represent, for example, the differences between treatment groups in a set of similar experiments, are averaged to obtain a single aggregate value representing the best <a href="/wiki/Estimate" id="w">estimate</a> of the effect of treatment.<sup id="_ref-lipsey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lipsey" title="">[30]</a></sup> Several decades after <a href="/wiki/Karl_Pearson" id="w">Pearson</a>&#39;s work with early versions of meta-analysis, <a href="/wiki/Gene_V._Glass" id="w">Glass</a><sup id="_ref-glass_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-glass" title="">[31]</a></sup> published the first application of modern meta-analytic techniques and triggered their broad application across the social and biomedical sciences. Today, meta-analysis is among the most common types of literature review found in educational psychology research.</p>
<p>Other quantitative research issues associated with educational psychology include the use of nested research designs (e.g., a student nested within a classroom, which is nested within a school, which is nested within a district, etc.) and the use of longitudinal statistical models to measure change.</p>
<a id="Qualitative_methods" name="Qualitative_methods"></a><h3>Qualitative methods</h3>
<p>Qualitative methods are used in educational studies whose purpose is to describe events, processes and situations of theoretical significance. The qualitative methods used in educational psychology often derive from <a href="/wiki/Anthropology" id="w">anthropology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sociology" id="w">sociology</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sociolinguistics" id="w">sociolinguistics</a>. For example, the anthropological method of <a href="/wiki/Ethnography" id="w">ethnography</a> has been used to describe teaching and learning in classrooms. In studies of this type, the researcher may gather detailed field notes as a <a href="/wiki/Participant_observation" id="w">participant observer</a> or passive observer. Later, the notes and other data may be categorized and interpreted by methods such as <a href="/wiki/Grounded_theory" id="w">grounded theory</a>. <a href="/wiki/Triangulation_(social_science)" id="w">Triangulation</a>, the practice of cross-checking findings with multiple data sources, is highly valued in qualitative research.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Case_study" id="w">Case studies</a> are forms of qualitative research focusing on a single person, organization, event, or other entity. In one case study,<sup id="_ref-everall_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-everall" title="">[32]</a></sup> researchers conducted a 150-minute, semi-structured <a href="/wiki/Interview" id="w">interview</a> with a 20-year old woman who had a history of <a href="/wiki/Teenage_suicide" id="w">suicidal</a> thinking between the ages of 14 to 18. They analyzed an audio-recording of the interview to understand the roles of cognitive development, <a href="/wiki/Identity_formation" id="w">identity formation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Attachment_theory" id="w">social attachment</a> in ending her suicidal thinking. </p>
<p>Qualitative analysis is most often applied to verbal data from sources such as conversations, interviews, <a href="/wiki/Focus_group" id="w">focus groups</a>, and personal journals. Qualitative methods are thus, typically, approaches to gathering, processing and reporting verbal data. One of the most commonly used methods for qualitative research in educational psychology is <a href="/wiki/Protocol_analysis" id="w">protocol analysis</a>.<sup id="_ref-ericsson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ericsson" title="">[33]</a></sup> In this method the research participant is asked to <a href="/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol" id="w">&#39;&#39;think aloud&#39;&#39;</a> while performing a task, such as solving a math problem. In protocol analysis the verbal data is thought to indicate which information the subject is attending to, but is explicitly not interpreted as an explanation or justification for behavior. In contrast, the method of verbal analysis<sup id="_ref-chi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chi" title="">[34]</a></sup> does admit learners&#39; explanations as a way to reveal their  <a href="/wiki/Mental_model" id="w">mental model</a> or <a href="/wiki/Misconception" id="w">misconceptions</a> (e.g., of the laws of motion). The most fundamental operations in both protocol and verbal analysis are segmenting (isolating) and categorizing sections of verbal data. <a href="/wiki/Conversation_analysis" id="w">Conversation analysis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Discourse_analysis" id="w">discourse analysis</a>, sociolinguistic methods that focus more specifically on the structure of conversational interchange (e.g., between a teacher and student), have been used to assess the process of conceptual change in science learning.<sup id="_ref-pea_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pea" title="">[35]</a></sup> Qualitative methods are also used to analyse information in a variety of media, such as students&#39; drawings and <a href="/wiki/Concept_maps" id="w">concept maps</a>, video-recorded interactions, and computer log records.</p>

Research on <a href="/wiki/Classroom_management" id="w">classroom management</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pedagogy" id="w">pedagogy</a> is conducted to guide teaching practice and form a foundation for teacher education programs. The goals of classroom management are to create an environment conducive to learning and to develop students&#39; self-management skills. More specifically, classroom management strives to create positive teacher-student and peer relationships, manage student groups to sustain on-task behavior, and use counselling and other psychological methods to aid students who present persistent psychosocial problems.<sup id="_ref-emmer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emmer" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Introductory educational psychology is a commonly required area of study in most North American teacher education programs. When taught in that context, its content varies, but it typically emphasizes learning theories (especially cognitively oriented ones), issues about motivation, assessment of students&#39; learning, and classroom management. A developing <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Contemporary_Educational_Psychology">Wikibook about educational psychology</a> gives more detail about the educational psychology topics that are typically presented in preservice teacher education.</p>

Instead, aspirations of the new discipline rested on the application of the <a href="/wiki/Scientific_methods" id="w">scientific methods</a> of observation and experimentation to educational problems. Even in the earliest years of the discipline, educational psychologists recognized the limitations of this new approach. In his famous series of lectures <i>Talks to Teachers on Psychology</i>, published in 1899 and now regarded as the first educational psychology textbook, the pioneering American psychologist <a href="/wiki/William_James" id="w">William James</a> commented that:</p>

<p>{{globalize}}
A person may be considered an educational psychologist after completing a graduate <a href="/wiki/Academic_degree" id="w">degree</a> in educational psychology or a closely related field.  Universities establish educational psychology graduate programs in either psychology departments or, more commonly, faculties of education. </p>
<p>Educational psychologists work in a variety of settings. Some work in university settings where they carry out research on the cognitive and social processes of human development, learning and education.  Educational psychologists may also work as consultants in designing and creating educational materials, classroom programs and online courses.</p>
<p>Educational psychologists who work in k-12 school settings (called <a href="/wiki/School_psychology" id="w">school psychologists</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>) are trained at the <a href="/wiki/Master%26%2339%3Bs_degree" id="w">masters</a> and <a href="/wiki/Doctorate" id="w">doctoral</a> levels.  In addition to conducting assessments, school psychologists provide services such as academic and behavioral intervention, counseling, teacher consultation, and crisis intervention.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a>, status as a <i>Chartered Educational Psychologist</i> is gained by completing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>an undergraduate degree in psychology permitting registration with the <a href="/wiki/British_Psychological_Society" id="w">British Psychological Society</a></li>
<li>two or three years experience working with children, young people and their families.</li>
<li>a three-year professional doctorate in educational psychology.</li></ul>
<p>The previous requirement to train and work for two years as a teacher has now been abandoned.</p>
<a id="Employment_outlook" name="Employment_outlook"></a><h3>Employment outlook</h3>
<p>Employment for psychologists in the United States is expected to grow faster than most occupations through the year 2014, with anticipated growth of 18-26%. One in four psychologist are employed in educational settings. In the United States, the <a href="/wiki/Median" id="w">median</a> <a href="/wiki/Salary" id="w">salary</a> for psychologists in primary and secondary schools is $58,360 as of May 2004.<sup id="_ref-OOH_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OOH" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>

Female membership on educational psychology journal editorial boards increased from 17% in 1976 to 47% in 2004. Over the same period, the proportion of chief editor positions held by women increased from 22% to 70%.</p>
