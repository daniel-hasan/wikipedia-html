The <b>University of the Witwatersrand</b> (pronounced <i>vit-vaters-rant</i>, with flat vowels; see <a href="/wiki/South_African_English" id="w">South African English</a>) is a leading <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South African</a> <a href="/wiki/University" id="w">university</a> situated in <a href="/wiki/Johannesburg" id="w">Johannesburg</a>.  It is often referred to as &#34;Wits&#34; (pronounced <i>vits</i>).</p>
<p>Due to the 1959 Extension of University Education Act the school was only allowed to register a small number of black students for most of the <a href="/wiki/Apartheid" id="w">apartheid</a> era, even though several notable black anti-apartheid leaders graduated from the university. It became desegregated again in the last few years of apartheid.
It is the home of the <a href="/wiki/Witwatersrand_University_Press" id="w">Witwatersrand University Press</a>, one of <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a>&#39;s leading academic publishers, and also the oldest and largest <a href="/wiki/University_press" id="w">university press</a> in Africa.</p>

The school was founded in <a href="/wiki/Kimberley%2C_South_Africa" id="w">Kimberley</a> in <a href="/wiki/1896" id="w">1896</a> as the &#34;South African School of Mines&#34;.  Eight years later, in <a href="/wiki/1904" id="w">1904</a> the school moved to <a href="/wiki/Johannesburg" id="w">Johannesburg</a> and changed its name to the &#34;Transvaal Technical Institute&#34;.  The school changed its name in <a href="/wiki/1906" id="w">1906</a> to the &#34;Transvaal University College&#34; and in <a href="/wiki/1910" id="w">1910</a>, the school again changed its name to the &#34;South African School of Mines and Technology&#34;.  Finally, in <a href="/wiki/1922" id="w">1922</a>, the school was granted full university status after incorporating the College as the &#34;University of the Witwatersrand&#34;.  The area of Milner Park was identified as the location for the new university <a href="/wiki/Campus" id="w">campus</a>, and construction began in the same year.  There were to be six faculties that offered degrees at the University: Arts, Science, Medicine, Engineering, Law, and Commerce.</p>

</p>
<p>The school experienced significant growth after its incorporation as a university, growing from a mere 6,275 students in <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a> to over 16,400 in <a href="/wiki/1985" id="w">1985</a>.  In <a href="/wiki/1964" id="w">1964</a>, the Medical Library of the Faculty of Medicine moved to Esselen Street, in the <a href="/wiki/Hillbrow" id="w">Hillbrow</a> section of Johannesburg.  During the course of the <a href="/wiki/1960s" id="w">1960s</a>, the university opened many new schools and buildings, and acquired a limestone cave renowned for its archaeological material located at <a href="/wiki/Sterkfontein" id="w">Sterkfontein</a>. The Graduate School of Business was established later in <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a> in <a href="/wiki/Parktown" id="w">Parktown</a>.  A farm next to Sterkfontein named <a href="/wiki/Swartkrans" id="w">Swartkrans</a> rich in archaeological material was purchased in 1968, and excavation rights were obtained for archaeological and palaeontological purposes at Makapansgat, located in <a href="/wiki/Limpopo_province" id="w">Limpopo province</a>.  The next year, the Ernest Oppenheimer Residence opened next to the Business school in Parktown, and later in the same year, clinical departments at the new Medical School opened.  In <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a>, Lawson&#39;s Corner was renamed University Corner.  Senate House, the university&#39;s main administrative building, was occupied in <a href="/wiki/1977" id="w">1977</a>.  The university underwent a significant expansion programme in <a href="/wiki/1984" id="w">1984</a>, acquiring the <a href="/wiki/Milner_Park_Showgrounds" id="w">Milner Park Showgrounds</a> and renaming it the West Campus.  In <a href="/wiki/1984" id="w">1984</a>, the Chamber of Mines building opened.  A walkway &#34;The Amic Deck&#34; was constructed across the motorway bisecting the campus, linking the East and West Campuses.</p>
<a id="Campuses" name="Campuses"></a><h1> Campuses </h1>
