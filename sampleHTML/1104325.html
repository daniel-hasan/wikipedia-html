<b>Eastwood</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Suburb" id="w">suburb</a> of <a href="/wiki/Sydney" id="w">Sydney</a>, in the state of <a href="/wiki/New_South_Wales" id="w">New South Wales</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>. Eastwood is located 17 <a href="/wiki/Kilometres" id="w">kilometres</a> north-west of the <a href="/wiki/Sydney_central_business_district" id="w">Sydney central business district</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Local_Government_Areas_in_Australia" id="w">local government areas</a> of the <a href="/wiki/City_of_Ryde" id="w">City of Ryde</a> and the <a href="/wiki/City_of_Parramatta" id="w">City of Parramatta</a>. Eastwood is also split between the <a href="/wiki/Lower_North_Shore_(Sydney)" id="w">Lower North Shore</a> region and the <a href="/wiki/Hills_District_(Sydney)" id="w">Hills District</a>.</p>
<p>Originally thought to have been inhabited by the Wallumedegal <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" id="w">Aboriginal</a> tribe, who lived in the area between the <a href="/wiki/Lane_Cove_River" id="w">Lane Cove</a> and <a href="/wiki/Parramatta_River" id="w">Parramatta</a> Rivers, the area was first settled by Europeans shortly after the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/First_Fleet" id="w">First Fleet</a> in 1788, from land grants to marines and N.S.W. Corps, and was named &#34;Eastwood&#34; by an early Irish free settler, William Rutledge. Today it is a large urban centre in the north of Sydney of over 14000 people, with  a large shopping area. Over the past few decades Eastwood has become increasingly multicultural and has a large Chinese and Korean community. Eastwood is best known as the place of where the <a href="/wiki/Granny_Smith" id="w">Granny Smith</a> Apple was first grown.</p>
<a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Eastwood is located at the edge of the Hornsby Plateau with the suburbs of <a href="/wiki/Dundas_Valley%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Dundas Valley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Denistone%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Denistone</a> on its southern and western sides as the land falls away down to the <a href="/wiki/Cumberland_Plain" id="w">Cumberland Plain</a>. To the north, Eastwood is bounded by the transport hub of <a href="/wiki/Epping%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Epping</a> and to its east <a href="/wiki/Marsfield%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Marsfield</a> which shares the same postcode of 2122. The suburb is predominantly residential with the main shopping area of Eastwood centred between Rowe Street and Rutledge Street around the railway line.
</p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>Eastwood was named after the property of Irish free settler, William Rutledge. The area was originally heavily timbered. 
</p><a id="Aboriginal_Culture" name="Aboriginal_Culture"></a><h3>Aboriginal Culture</h3>
<p>The Wallumedegal <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" id="w">Aboriginal</a> tribe lived in the area between the <a href="/wiki/Lane_Cove_River" id="w">Lane Cove River</a> and <a href="/wiki/Parramatta_River" id="w">Parramatta River</a>, which was known as Walumetta.</p>
<a id="European_Settlement" name="European_Settlement"></a><h3>European Settlement</h3>
<p>The area was first settled by Europeans shortly after the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/First_Fleet" id="w">First Fleet</a> in 1788 and was part of the <a href="/wiki/Field_of_Mars_Common" id="w">Field of Mars</a>. </p>
<p>The area of Eastwood was originally granted between the years of 1790 and 1803 to marines of the <a href="/wiki/NSW_Corps" id="w">NSW Corps</a>. John Love, a private was granted 90 acres here in 1794, described as <i>North Brush, in the <a href="/wiki/Field_of_Mars_Common" id="w">Field of Mars Common</a></i>. The land was then acquired by William Kent who already held land in what is now <a href="/wiki/Epping%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Epping</a>. The land was purchased by William Rutledge for 288 pounds in 1835, who built Eastwood House in 1840. This house is now part of <a href="/wiki/Marist_College_Eastwood" id="w">Marist College Eastwood</a>. In 1863 Edward Terry purchased the estate and upon his death in 1905, the estate was sub-divided. </p>
<p>In 1886, the railway line from <a href="/wiki/Strathfield%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w"> Strathfield</a> to <a href="/wiki/Hornsby%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Hornsby</a> was opened, with a station here originally called <a href="/wiki/Dundas%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Dundas</a>. This was changed a year later to Eastwood, named after the Eastwood Estate.</p>
<p>The commercial centre underwent a major upgrade in the early 1980s. Rowe Street, which originally ran across the railway line through a <a href="/wiki/Level_crossing" id="w">level crossing</a> was turned into a mall between The Avenue and West Parade, and the 1940s bridge built in First Avenue for crossing traffic was replaced with a six-lane bridge. This bridge was to service the planned County of Cumberland Scheme &#34;County Road&#34; (linking Eastwood with <a href="/wiki/Macquarie_Park" id="w">Macquarie Park</a>), a road project in the local area which has been controversial among locals.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="Commercial_Area" name="Commercial_Area"></a><h2>Commercial Area</h2>
<p>The Eastwood commercial district is located around <a href="/wiki/Eastwood_railway_station%2C_Sydney" id="w">Eastwood Railway Station</a>. The Eastwood Shopping Centre is a <a href="/wiki/Shopping_mall" id="w">shopping mall</a>, which includes major retailer <a href="/wiki/Woolworths_(supermarkets)" id="w">Woolworths</a>, is located in the town centre and opens on to the Eastwood Plaza. The Plaza features a fountain and several cafes with outdoor seating. Eastwood is becoming well known as an Asian shopping precinct, with specialty stores, supermarkets and many restaurants run by Chinese, Korean, Sri Lankan, Vietnamese, Greek, Italian, Cantonese and Indian retailers.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The multicultural background of its residents has created a good collection of <a href="/wiki/Cantonese" id="w">Cantonese</a>, <a href="/wiki/Korean_cuisine" id="w">Korean</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greek_cuisine" id="w">Greek</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italian_cuisine" id="w">Italian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vietnamese_cuisine" id="w">Vietnamese</a> and <a href="/wiki/Singaporean" id="w">Singaporean</a> restaurants and eateries in the area.</p>
<a id="Housing" name="Housing"></a><h2>Housing</h2>
<p>While most of Eastwood is residential, with one or two-storey buildings and villas, the area surrounding the town centre boasts buildings up to seven storeys high. In 2006 the City of Ryde developed a Control Plan for the Eastwood Town Centre, which includes the provision of buildings of up to ten storeys high in the shopping and railway areas.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Former industrial parts of the suburb are also undergoing redevelopment. The former brickworks site is being converted into a housing estate.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2>Transport</h2>
<p>Eastwood is relatively well served by public transport. <a href="/wiki/Eastwood_railway_station%2C_Sydney" id="w">Eastwood Railway Station</a> is located on the <a href="/wiki/Northern_railway_line%2C_Sydney" id="w">Northern Line</a>. The station opened in 1886,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> and journeys take approximately 35 minutes to the CBD. Intercity services also depart the station for the city of <a href="/wiki/Newcastle%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Newcastle</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Central_Coast%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Central Coast</a> region.</p>
<p>Numerous bus services also operate from the small interchange outside the station. These include the 545 route between <a href="/wiki/Parramatta%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Parramatta</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chatswood%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Chatswood</a>, the 544 route between <a href="/wiki/Auburn%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Auburn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Macquarie_University" id="w">Macquarie University</a>, and the 515/X15 service to the <a href="/wiki/Sydney_CBD" id="w">Sydney CBD</a>. Eastwood is also served well by roads, and is located close to the trunk routes of <a href="/wiki/Metroad_6" id="w">Metroad 6</a> (Marsden Road), and <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Road%2C_Sydney" id="w">Victoria Road</a>.</p>
