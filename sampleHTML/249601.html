<p>The <b>Isle of Portland</b> ({{pronEng}}) is a limestone island {{convert}} long by {{convert}} wide in the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel" id="w">English Channel</a>. Portland is {{convert}} south of the resort of <a href="/wiki/Weymouth" id="w">Weymouth</a>, forming the southernmost point of the county of <a href="/wiki/Dorset" id="w">Dorset</a>, in <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>. <a href="/wiki/Chesil_Beach" id="w">Chesil Beach</a> connects the island to the mainland, and the <a href="/wiki/A354_road" id="w">A354 road</a> bridge connects to Weymouth, which together form the borough of <a href="/wiki/Weymouth_and_Portland" id="w">Weymouth and Portland</a>. The population of the island is almost 13,000.</p>
<p>Portland is a central part of the <a href="/wiki/Jurassic_Coast" id="w">Jurassic Coast</a>, a <a href="/wiki/World_Heritage_Site" id="w">World Heritage Site</a> on the Dorset and east Devon coast, important for its geology and landforms. The name of the island is used for one of the <a href="/wiki/British_Sea_Areas" id="w">British Sea Areas</a>, and has been <a href="/wiki/Portland" id="w">exported</a> as the name of North American and Australian towns. <a href="/wiki/Portland_limestone" id="w">Portland limestone</a> is still quarried here, and is used in British architecture, including <a href="/wiki/St_Paul%26%2339%3Bs_Cathedral" id="w">St Paul&#39;s Cathedral</a> and <a href="/wiki/Buckingham_Palace" id="w">Buckingham Palace</a>.</p>
<p>The large, deep artificial <a href="/wiki/Portland_Harbour" id="w">harbour</a> on Portland&#39;s northern shore was an important <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" id="w">Royal Navy</a> base during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> and <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>; the Royal Navy and <a href="/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organisation" id="w">NATO</a> trained in its waters until the 1990s.
