<p>The <b>Battle for Henderson Field</b>, also known as the <b>Battle of Henderson Field</b>, took place <a href="/wiki/October_23" id="w">October 23</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/October_26" id="w">October 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a> on and around <a href="/wiki/Guadalcanal" id="w">Guadalcanal</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Solomon_Islands" id="w">Solomon Islands</a>. The battle was a land, sea, and air <a href="/wiki/Battle" id="w">battle</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_War" id="w">Pacific campaign</a> of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> and was fought between the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army" id="w">Imperial Japanese Army</a> and <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy" id="w">Navy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" id="w">Allied</a> (mainly <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" id="w">United States (U.S.) Marine</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" id="w">U.S. Army</a>) forces.  The battle was the third of the three major land offensives conducted by the Japanese during the <a href="/wiki/Guadalcanal_campaign" id="w">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.</p>
<p>In the battle, U.S. Marine and Army forces, under the overall command of <a href="/wiki/Major_General" id="w">Major General</a> <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Vandegrift" id="w">Alexander Vandegrift</a>, successfully repulsed an attack by the Japanese 17th Army, under the command of Japanese <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_General" id="w">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="/wiki/Harukichi_Hyakutake" id="w">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>.  The U.S. forces were defending the Lunga perimeter, which guarded <a href="/wiki/Honiara_International_Airport" id="w">Henderson Field</a> on Guadalcanal, that had been captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on <a href="/wiki/August_7" id="w">August 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>.  Hyakutake&#39;s force was sent to Guadalcanal in response to the Allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the Allied forces off of the island.  Hyakutake&#39;s soldiers conducted numerous assaults over three days at various locations around the Lunga perimeter, but all were repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese attackers.  At the same time, Allied aircraft operating from Henderson Field successfully defended U.S. positions on Guadalcanal from attacks by Japanese naval air and sea forces.</p>
<p>The battle was the last serious ground offensive conducted by Japanese forces on Guadalcanal.  After an attempt to deliver further reinforcements failed during the <a href="/wiki/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal" id="w">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a> in November 1942, Japan conceded defeat in the struggle for the island and successfully evacuated many of its remaining forces by the first week of February 1943.</p>

<p>{{main}}
On <a href="/wiki/August_7" id="w">August 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="/wiki/Tulagi" id="w">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Florida_Islands" id="w">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Solomon_Islands" id="w">Solomon Islands</a>.  The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as <a href="/wiki/Military_base" id="w">bases</a> for threatening the <a href="/wiki/Materiel" id="w">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, and to secure the islands as starting points for a <a href="/wiki/Military_campaign" id="w">campaign</a> with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at <a href="/wiki/Rabaul" id="w">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea_campaign" id="w">New Guinea campaign</a>.  The landings initiated the six-month-long <a href="/wiki/Guadalcanal_campaign" id="w">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Taking the Japanese by surprise, by nightfall on <a href="/wiki/August_8" id="w">August 8</a>, the 11,000 Allied troops, under the command of <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_General" id="w">Lieutenant General</a> Alexander Vandegrift and mainly consisting of United States Marine Corps units, had <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Tulagi_and_Gavutu-Tanambogo" id="w">secured Tulagi</a> and nearby small islands, as well as an airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal.  The airfield was later named Henderson Field by Allied forces.  The Allied aircraft that subsequently operated out of the airfield became known as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Cactus_Air_Force" id="w">Cactus Air Force</a>&#34; (CAF) after the Allied codename for Guadalcanal.  To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Imperial_General_Headquarters" id="w">Imperial General Headquarters</a> assigned the Imperial Japanese Army&#39;s 17th Army, a <a href="/wiki/Corps" id="w">corps</a>-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant-General Harukichi Hyakutake, with the task of retaking Guadalcanal from Allied forces.  Beginning <a href="/wiki/August_19" id="w">August 19</a>, various units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal with the goal of driving Allied forces from the island.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

</p>
<p>Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island.  Instead, the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the <a href="/wiki/Shortland_Islands" id="w">Shortland Islands</a> to carry their forces to Guadalcanal.  The Japanese warships, mainly light <a href="/wiki/Cruiser" id="w">cruisers</a> or <a href="/wiki/Destroyer" id="w">destroyers</a> from the <a href="/wiki/IJN_8th_Fleet" id="w">Eighth Fleet</a> under the command of <a href="/wiki/Vice_Admiral" id="w">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="/wiki/Gunichi_Mikawa" id="w">Gunichi Mikawa</a>, were usually able to make the round trip down &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Slot" id="w">The Slot</a>&#34; to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers&#39; heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Express" id="w">Tokyo Express</a>&#34; by Allied forces and &#34;Rat Transportation&#34; by the Japanese.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first Japanese attempt to recapture Henderson Field failed when a 917-man force was defeated on <a href="/wiki/August_21" id="w">August 21</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Tenaru" id="w">Battle of the Tenaru</a>. The next attempt took place from <a href="/wiki/September_12" id="w">September 12</a> through <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, with the <a href="/wiki/Kawaguchi_Detachment" id="w">6,000 soldiers</a> under the command of Major General <a href="/wiki/Kiyotake_Kawaguchi" id="w">Kiyotake Kawaguchi</a> being defeated in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Edson%26%2339%3Bs_Ridge" id="w">Battle of Edson&#39;s Ridge</a>. After their defeat at Edson&#39;s Ridge, Kawaguchi and the surviving Japanese troops regrouped west of the <a href="/wiki/Matanikau_River" id="w">Matanikau River</a> on Guadalcanal.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hyakutake immediately began to prepare for another attempt to recapture Henderson Field. The Japanese navy promised to support Hyakutake&#39;s next offensive by delivering the necessary troops, equipment, and supplies to the island, and by stepping-up air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bombard the airfield.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the Japanese regrouped, the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On <a href="/wiki/September_18" id="w">September 18</a>, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the <a href="/wiki/U.S._7th_Marine_Regiment" id="w">U.S. 7th Marine Regiment</a> to Guadalcanal. This regiment had previously formed part of the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade and was fresh from garrison duty in <a href="/wiki/Samoa" id="w">Samoa</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>  These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift, beginning on <a href="/wiki/September_19" id="w">September 19</a>, to establish an unbroken line of defense completely around the Lunga perimeter.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>General Vandegrift and his staff were aware that Kawaguchi&#39;s troops had retreated to the area west of the Matanikau and that numerous groups of Japanese stragglers were scattered throughout the area between the Lunga Perimeter and the Matanikau River.  Vandegrift, therefore, decided to conduct a <a href="/wiki/Actions_along_the_Matanikau" id="w">series of small unit operations</a> around the Matanikau Valley.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

</p>
<p>The first U.S. Marine operation against Japanese forces west of the Matanikau, conducted between <a href="/wiki/September_23" id="w">September 23</a> and <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a> <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a> by elements of three U.S. Marine <a href="/wiki/Battalion" id="w">battalions</a>, was repulsed by Kawaguchi&#39;s troops under Colonel <a href="/wiki/Akinosuke_Oka" id="w">Akinosuke Oka</a>&#39;s local command. In the second action, between <a href="/wiki/October_6" id="w">October 6</a> and <a href="/wiki/October_9" id="w">October 9</a>, a larger force of U.S. Marines successfully crossed the Matanikau River, attacked newly landed Japanese forces from the <a href="/wiki/2nd_Division_(Imperial_Japanese_Army)" id="w">2nd (Sendai) Infantry Division</a> under the command of generals <a href="/wiki/Masao_Maruyama_(Lieutenant_General)" id="w">Masao Maruyama</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yumio_Nasu" id="w">Yumio Nasu</a> and almost completely destroyed the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Aoba_Detachment" id="w">4th Infantry Regiment</a>. The second action forced the Japanese to retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the meantime, Major General Millard F. Harmon, commander of United States Army forces in the South Pacific, convinced Vice Admiral <a href="/wiki/Robert_L._Ghormley" id="w">Robert L. Ghormley</a>, commander of Allied forces in the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean_Areas_(command)" id="w">South Pacific Area</a>, that U.S. Marine forces on Guadalcanal needed to be reinforced immediately if the Allies were to successfully defend the island from the next expected Japanese offensive. Thus on <a href="/wiki/October_13" id="w">October 13</a>, a naval convoy delivered the 2,837-strong <a href="/wiki/164th_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)" id="w">164th U.S. Infantry Regiment</a>, a <a href="/wiki/North_Dakota" id="w">North Dakota</a> <a href="/wiki/Army_National_Guard" id="w">Army National Guard</a> formation from the U.S. Army&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Americal_Division" id="w">Americal Division</a>, to Guadalcanal.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mikawa&#39;s ships continued nocturnal deliveries of men and materiel to Guadalcanal. Between <a href="/wiki/October_1" id="w">October 1</a> and <a href="/wiki/October_17" id="w">October 17</a> Japanese convoys delivered 15,000 Japanese troops, comprising the remainder of the 2nd Infantry Division and one regiment of the 38th Infantry Division, plus artillery, tanks, ammunition, and provisions, to Guadalcanal. One of these, on <a href="/wiki/October_9" id="w">October 9</a>, landed General Hyakutake on the island to personally lead the Japanese forces in the planned offensive. Mikawa also sent heavy cruisers on several occasions to bombard Henderson Field. One of these bombardment missions on the night of <a href="/wiki/October_11" id="w">October 11</a> was intercepted by U.S. naval forces and defeated in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_Esperance" id="w">Battle of Cape Esperance</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_13" id="w">October 13</a>, in order to help protect the transit of an important supply convoy to Guadalcanal that consisted of six slower cargo ships, the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Combined_Fleet" id="w">Combined Fleet</a> commander <a href="/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto" id="w">Isoroku Yamamoto</a> sent a naval force from <a href="/wiki/Chuuk" id="w">Truk</a>, commanded by <a href="/wiki/Takeo_Kurita" id="w">Takeo Kurita</a>, to bombard Henderson Field.  Kurita&#39;s force, consisting of the battleships <a href="/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Kong%C5%8D" id="w">&#39;&#39;Kongō&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Haruna" id="w">&#39;&#39;Haruna&#39;&#39;</a>, escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers, approached Guadalcanal unopposed and opened fire on Henderson Field at 01:33 on <a href="/wiki/October_14" id="w">October 14</a>. Over the next one hour and 23 minutes, they fired 973 14-inch (355mm) shells into the Lunga perimeter, most of them falling in and around the 2,200-meter-square area of the airfield. The bombardment heavily damaged the airfield&#39;s two runways, burned almost all of the available aviation fuel, destroyed 48 of the CAF&#39;s 90 aircraft, and killed 41 men, including six CAF aircrew.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the heavy damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore one of the runways to operational condition within a few hours.  Over the next several weeks, the CAF gradually recovered as Allied forces delivered more aircraft, fuel, and aircrew personnel to Guadalcanal.  Observing the Japanese deliveries of troops and supplies to the island, American forces were expecting an imminent offensive by Japanese ground forces, but they were not sure where and when it would take place.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Troop_movement" name="Troop_movement"></a><h2>Troop movement</h2>
<p>Because of the loss of their positions on the east side of the Matanikau, the Japanese decided that an attack on the U.S. defenses along the coast would be prohibitively difficult.  Thus, after observation of the American defences around Lunga Point by his staff officers, Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field.  His 2nd Division (augmented by troops from the 38th Division), under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama and comprising 7,000 soldiers in three infantry regiments of three battalions each was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defences from the south near the east bank of the Lunga River.  The 2nd Division was split into three units; the Left Wing Unit under Major General Yumio Nasu containing the 29th Infantry Regiment, the Right Wing Unit under Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi consisting of the 230th Infantry Regiment (from the 38th Infantry Division), and the division reserve led by Maruyama comprising the 16th Infantry Regiment.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>  The date of the attack was set for <a href="/wiki/October_22" id="w">October 22</a>.  To distract the Americans from the planned attack from the south, Hyakutake&#39;s heavy artillery plus five battalions of infantry (about 2,900 men) under Major General <a href="/wiki/Tadashi_Sumiyoshi" id="w">Tadashi Sumiyoshi</a> were to attack the American defenses from the west along the coastal corridor.  The Japanese estimated that there were 10,000 American troops on the island, when in fact there were about 23,000.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>At this time, the Lunga perimeter was defended by four American regiments comprising 13 infantry battalions.  The 164th Infantry Regiment guarded the easternmost sector.  Extending from the 164th south and west across Edson&#39;s Ridge to the Lunga River was the <a href="/wiki/7th_Marine_Regiment_(United_States)" id="w">7th Marine Regiment</a>.  Covering the sector west of the Lunga to the coast were the <a href="/wiki/1st_Marine_Regiment_(United_States)" id="w">1st</a> and <a href="/wiki/5th_Marine_Regiment_(United_States)" id="w">5th</a> Marine Regiments.  Defending the mouth of the Matanikau for the Americans were two battalions under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William J. McKelvy:  the <a href="/wiki/3rd_Battalion_1st_Marines" id="w">3d Battalion, 1st Marines</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/3rd_Battalion_7th_Marines" id="w">3d Battalion, 7th Marines</a>.  McKelvy&#39;s force was separated from the Lunga perimeter by a gap that was covered by patrols.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

On <a href="/wiki/October_12" id="w">October 12</a>, a company of Japanese engineers began to break a trail, called the &#34;Maruyama Road&#34;, from the Matanikau towards the southern portion of the U.S. Lunga perimeter.  The {{convert}} long trail traversed some of the most difficult terrain on Guadalcanal, including numerous rivers and streams, deep, muddy ravines, steep ridges, and dense jungle.  Between <a href="/wiki/October_16" id="w">October 16</a> and <a href="/wiki/October_18" id="w">October 18</a>, the 2nd Division began their march along the Maruyama Road, led by Nasu&#39;s unit and followed in order by Kawaguchi and Maruyama.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Early on the morning of <a href="/wiki/October_20" id="w">October 20</a>, Maruyama reached the Lunga River.  Believing that his units were about {{convert}} south of the airfield, he ordered the left and right wing units to advance abreast of each other parallel to the Lunga north towards the American lines and set the time of the attack for 18:00 on <a href="/wiki/October_22" id="w">October 22</a>.  Maruyama, however, was mistaken.  He and his troops were actually {{convert}} south of the airfield.  By the evening of <a href="/wiki/October_21" id="w">October 21</a>, it was clear to Maruyama that his units would not be in position to attack the next day, so he postponed the attack to <a href="/wiki/October_23" id="w">October 23</a>.  At nightfall on <a href="/wiki/October_22" id="w">October 22</a>, much of the 2nd Division still remained strung out along the Murayama Road, but Maruyama ruled out any postponement of the attack.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>During this time Sumiyoshi prepared his command to attack the American forces from the west.  On <a href="/wiki/October_18" id="w">October 18</a>, he began shelling Henderson Field with 15 <a href="/wiki/Type_96_15_cm_Howitzer" id="w">150 mm howitzers</a>.  What remained of the 4th Infantry Regiment under Colonel <a href="/wiki/Nomasu_Nakaguma" id="w">Nomasu Nakaguma</a> began to gather openly near Point Cruz (on the coast just west of the Matanikau).  On <a href="/wiki/October_19" id="w">October 19</a> Colonel Akinosuka Oka led the 1,200 troops of his 124th Infantry Regiment inland across the Matanikau and began moving up the east bank towards high ground east of the river.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_23" id="w">October 23</a>, Maruyama&#39;s forces struggled through the jungle to reach the American lines.  Kawaguchi, on his own initiative, began to shift his right wing unit to the east, believing that the American defenses were weaker in that area.  Maruyama, through one of his staff officers, ordered Kawaguchi to keep to the original attack plan.  When he refused, Kawaguchi was relieved of command and replaced by Colonel <a href="/wiki/Toshinari_Shoji" id="w">Toshinari Shoji</a>, commander of the 230th Infantry Regiment.  That evening, after learning that the left and right wing forces were still struggling to reach the American lines, Hyakutake postponed the attack to 19:00 on <a href="/wiki/October_24" id="w">October 24</a>.  The Americans remained completely unaware of the approach of Maruyama&#39;s forces.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>On this day the Japanese 11th Air Fleet under <a href="/wiki/Jinichi_Kusaka" id="w">Jinichi Kusaka</a> based at Rabaul sent 16 <a href="/wiki/Mitsubishi_G4M" id="w">bombers</a> and 28 <a href="/wiki/A6M_Zero" id="w">zero</a> fighters to attack Henderson Field.

Marine <a href="/wiki/37_mm_Gun_M3" id="w">37 mm</a> anti-tank guns and artillery quickly destroyed all nine tanks.  At the same time, four battalions of Marine artillery, totalling 40 howitzers, fired over 6,000 rounds into the area between Point Cruz and the Matanikau, causing heavy casualties in Nakaguma&#39;s infantry battalions as they tried to approach the Marine lines.  Nakaguma&#39;s attacks ended by 01:15 on <a href="/wiki/October_24" id="w">October 24</a>, inflicting only light casualties on the Marines and gaining no ground.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Partly in response to Nakaguma&#39;s attacks, on <a href="/wiki/October_24" id="w">October 24</a> the <a href="/wiki/2nd_Battalion_7th_Marines" id="w">2nd Battalion, 7th Marines</a> under Lieutenant Colonel Hanneken deployed to the Matanikau.  After Oka&#39;s forces were sighted approaching the Marine Matanikau positions from the south, Hanneken&#39;s battalion was placed on a ridge facing south which formed a continuous extension of the inland flank of the Marine&#39;s horseshoe-shaped Matanikau defenses.  A gap, however, still remained between Hanneken&#39;s left (east) flank and the main perimeter.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

 14:00 on <a href="/wiki/October_24" id="w">October 24</a>, Maruyama&#39;s left and right wing units began to deploy for their attacks.  Maruyama&#39;s troops had very little artillery or mortar support for their upcoming assault, having abandoned most of their heavy cannons along the Maruyama Road.  Between 16:00 and 21:00, heavy rain fell, delaying the Japanese approach and causing &#34;chaos&#34; in the Japanese formations, already exhausted from the long march through the jungle.<sup id="_ref-Frank Guadalcanal 353-4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frank Guadalcanal 353-4" title="">[27]</a></sup>  Shoji&#39;s right wing force accidentally turned parallel to the Marine lines, and all but one battalion failed to make contact with the Marine defenses.  Shoji&#39;s 1st Battalion, 230th Infantry Regiment &#34;stumbled&#34; into Puller&#39;s lines about 22:00 and were driven off by Puller&#39;s men.  For unknown reasons, Maruyama&#39;s staff then reported to Hyakutake that Shoji&#39;s men had overrun Henderson Field.  At 00:50 on <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, Hyakutake signaled Rabaul that, &#34;A little before 23:00 the Right Wing captured the airfield.&#34;<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Frank Guadalcanal 353-4_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frank Guadalcanal 353-4" title="">[27]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Griffith Battle 197-98_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Griffith Battle 197-98" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>At about this time, Nasu&#39;s left wing battalions finally began to reach the Marine defenses.  At 00:30 on <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, the 11th Company of Nasu&#39;s 3rd Battalion under <a href="/wiki/Captain" id="w">Captain</a> Jiro Katsumata found and attacked Company A of Puller&#39;s battalion.  Katsumata&#39;s attack was impeded by heavy <a href="/wiki/Barbed_wire" id="w">barbed wire</a> emplaced in front of the Marine line and then hit heavily by American machine gun, mortar, and artillery fire.  By 01:00, the Marine fire had killed most of Katsumata&#39;s company.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Further west, the 9th Company of Nasu&#39;s 3rd Battalion charged straight into Puller&#39;s Company C at 01:15.  Within five minutes, a Marine machine gun section led by <a href="/wiki/Sergeant" id="w">Sergeant</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Basilone" id="w">John Basilone</a> killed almost every member of the 9th Company.  By 01:25 heavy fire from the Marine divisional artillery was falling into Nasu&#39;s troop assembly and approach routes, causing heavy casualties.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Recognizing that a major Japanese attack was underway, Puller requested reinforcement.  At 03:45, the 3rd Battalion, 164th Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall, which was being held in reserve was fed piecemeal into Puller&#39;s line.  In spite of the darkness and intermittent heavy rain, the Army National Guard troops were successfully placed in Puller&#39;s defences before daybreak.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Just before dawn, Colonel Masajiro Furimiya, the commander of the 29th Infantry, with two companies from his 3rd Battalion plus his headquarters staff was able to penetrate through the Marine artillery fire and reach Puller&#39;s lines about 03:30.  Most of Furimiya&#39;s troops were killed during their assault, but about 100 broke through the American defenses and carved a <a href="/wiki/Salients%2C_re-entrants_and_pockets" id="w">salient</a> {{convert}} in width and {{convert}} deep in the center of Puller&#39;s line.  After sunrise, Furimiya&#39;s 2nd Battalion joined in the assault on Puller, but were thrown back.  At 07:30, Nasu decided to withdraw most of the remainder of his troops back into the jungle and prepare for another attack that night.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the day of <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, Puller&#39;s men attacked and eradicated the salient in their lines and hunted small groups of Japanese infiltrators, killing 104 Japanese soldiers.  More than 300 of Maruyama&#39;s men in total were killed in their first attacks on the Lunga perimeter.  At 04:30, Hyakutake rescinded the message announcing the capture of the airfield, but at 07:00 declared that the results of Maruyama&#39;s attack were unknown.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

The Japanese 8th Fleet had task units ready to support the Army&#39;s attacks on Guadalcanal.  Upon receipt of Hyakutake&#39;s message declaring success at 00:50 on <a href="/wiki/October_24" id="w">October 24</a>, the task units went into action.  The <a href="/wiki/Light_cruiser" id="w">light cruiser</a> <a href="/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Sendai" id="w">&#39;&#39;Sendai&#39;&#39;</a> and three destroyers patrolled west of Guadalcanal to interdict any Allied ships that tried to approach the island.  A First Assault Unit with three destroyers and a Second Assault Unit with the light cruiser <a href="/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Yura" id="w">&#39;&#39;Yura&#39;&#39;</a> and five destroyers approached Guadalcanal to attack any Allied ships off the island&#39;s north or east coast and to provide gunfire support for Hyakutake&#39;s forces.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>At 10:14, the First Assault Unit arrived off Lunga Point and chased away two old U.S. destroyers converted to minesweepers, <a href="/wiki/USS_Zane_(DD-337)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Zane&#39;&#39;</a> and <i>Trevor</i>, which were delivering aviation fuel to Henderson Field.  The Japanese destroyers then sighted and sank the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Tugboat" id="w">tugboat</a> <i><a href="/wiki/USS_Seminole_(AT-65)" id="w">Seminole</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Patrol_boat" id="w">patrol boat</a> <i>YP-284</i> before beginning their bombardment of the U.S. positions around Lunga Point.  At 10:53, a Marine shore gun hit and damaged one of the destroyers, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Akatsuki" id="w">&#39;&#39;Akatsuki&#39;&#39;</a> and all three Japanese destroyers withdrew while being strafed by four CAF Wildcat fighters.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the Second Assault Unit approached Guadalcanal through <a href="/wiki/Indispensable_Strait" id="w">Indispensable Strait</a>, it was attacked by five CAF <a href="/wiki/SBD_Dauntless" id="w">SBD Dauntless</a> (SBD) <a href="/wiki/Dive_bomber" id="w">dive bombers</a>.  Bomb hits caused heavy damage to <i>Yura</i>, and the unit reversed course to try to escape.  More CAF air attacks on <i>Yura</i> throughout the day caused further damage, and the cruiser was abandoned and scuttled at 21:00 that night.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, 82 Japanese bombers and fighters from the 11th Air Fleet and from the <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carriers" id="w">aircraft carriers</a> <a href="/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Juny%C5%8D" id="w">&#39;&#39;Junyō&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Hiy%C5%8D" id="w">&#39;&#39;Hiyō&#39;&#39;</a> attacked Henderson Field in six waves throughout the day and were engaged by CAF fighters and Marine anti-aircraft guns.  By the end of the day the Japanese had lost 11 fighters, 2 bombers, and one reconnaissance aircraft along with most of the aircrews in the downed aircraft.  Two CAF fighters were destroyed in the day&#39;s fighting but both pilots survived.  The Japanese air attacks caused only light damage to Henderson Field and the American defenses.  The Americans later referred to this day as &#34;Dugout Sunday&#34; because the continuous Japanese air, naval, and artillery attacks kept many of the Lunga defenders in their foxholes and shelters throughout the day.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

<p>Throughout the day of <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, the Americans redeployed and improved their defences against the Japanese attack they were expecting that night.  In the west, Hanneken and the 5th Marines closed the gap between their two forces.  Along the southern portion of the perimeter, Puller&#39;s and Hall&#39;s troops disentwined and repositioned.  Puller&#39;s men fortified the western {{convert}} of the sector and the 164th soldiers took the eastern {{convert}} segment.  The division reserve, the <a href="/wiki/3rd_Battalion_2nd_Marines" id="w">3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment</a> was placed directly behind Hall&#39;s and Puller&#39;s positions.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Maruyama committed his reserve force, the 16th Infantry Regiment, to Nasu&#39;s left wing unit.

Nasu was hit by rifle fire and mortally wounded, dying a few hours later.  A few small groups of Nasu&#39;s men broke through the American defenses, including one led by Colonel Furimiya, but were all hunted down and killed over the next several days.

 03:00 on <a href="/wiki/October_26" id="w">October 26</a>, Oka&#39;s unit finally reached and attacked the Marine defenses near the Matanikau.  Oka&#39;s troops assaulted all along an east-west saddle ridge held by Hanneken&#39;s battalion but concentrated particularly on Hanneken&#39;s Company F, which defended the extreme left flank of the Marine positions on the ridge.  A Company F machine gun section under <a href="/wiki/Mitchell_Paige" id="w">Mitchell Paige</a> killed many of the Japanese attackers, but Japanese fire eventually killed or injured almost all the Marine machine gunners.  At 05:00, Oka&#39;s 3rd Battalion, 4th Infantry succeeded in scaling the steep slope of the ridge and pushed the surviving members of Company F off of the crest.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Frank Guadalcanal 363-4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Frank Guadalcanal 363-4" title="">[44]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Griffith Battle 204_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Griffith Battle 204" title="">[45]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Hough Pearl 337_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hough Pearl 337" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>

Conoley&#39;s scratch force was joined by elements of Hanneken&#39;s Company G, Company C, and a few unwounded survivors from Company F and attacked the Japanese before they could consolidate their positions on top of the ridge.  By 06:00, Conoley&#39;s force had pushed the Japanese back off of the ridge, effectively ending Oka&#39;s attack.  The Marines counted 98 Japanese bodies on the ridge and 200 more in the ravine in front of it.

At the same time that Hyakutake&#39;s troops were attacking the Lunga perimeter, Japanese aircraft carriers and other large warships under the overall direction of Isoroku Yamamoto moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands.  From this location, the Japanese naval forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to Hyakutake&#39;s ground offensive.  Allied naval carrier forces in the area, now under the command of <a href="/wiki/William_Halsey%2C_Jr." id="w">William Halsey, Jr.</a> who had replaced Ghormley, also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>The two opposing carrier forces confronted each other on the morning of <a href="/wiki/October_26" id="w">October 26</a>, in what became known as the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Santa_Cruz_Islands" id="w">Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands</a>. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, Allied surface ships were forced to retreat from the battle area with the loss of one carrier sunk and another heavily damaged. The participating Japanese carrier forces, however, also retreated because of high aircraft and aircrew losses and significant damage to two carriers. Although an apparent tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk and damaged, the loss of many irreplaceable, veteran aircrews by the Japanese provided a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>

<p>Although the Japanese army&#39;s attack on the Allied Lunga perimeter was decisively defeated in this battle, the Japanese were not yet ready to give up the struggle for Guadalcanal.  The Japanese army and navy made immediate plans to move the rest of the 38th Division to the island, along with the 51st Infantry Division, to try a further offensive against Henderson Field in November 1942.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Japanese again planned to bombard Henderson Field with battleships in order to allow a convoy of transport ships to deliver the 38th&#39;s troops and heavy equipment.  In contrast, however, to what occurred on <a href="/wiki/October_14" id="w">October 14</a>, this time the U.S. Navy moved to intercept the battleship forces sent by Yamamoto from Truk to shell the airfield.  During the ensuing <a href="/wiki/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal" id="w">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a> from <a href="/wiki/November_13" id="w">November 13</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/November_15" id="w">15</a>, Allied naval and air forces turned back both Japanese attempts to bombard Henderson Field and almost completely destroyed the transport convoy carrying the remainder of the 38th Division.  After this failure to deliver significant additional troops to the island, the Japanese commanders finally conceded defeat in the battle for Guadalcanal and <a href="/wiki/Operation_Ke" id="w">evacuated</a> most of their surviving troops by the first week of February, 1943.  Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in Japan&#39;s defeat and the end of World War II.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>
