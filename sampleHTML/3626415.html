<p>The <a href="/wiki/Cellulose" id="w">cellulose</a> plant conflict between <a href="/wiki/Argentina" id="w">Argentina</a> and <a href="/wiki/Uruguay" id="w">Uruguay</a> is an ongoing conflict between private citizens, organizations, and the governments of these two <a href="/wiki/South_American" id="w">South American</a> countries about the construction of cellulose processing plants on the <a href="/wiki/Uruguay_River" id="w">Uruguay River</a>. As a diplomatic, economic, and public relations conflict between both parties, the dispute has also affected <a href="/wiki/Tourism" id="w">tourism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Transportation" id="w">transportation</a> as well as the otherwise amicable relations between the two countries. The feud is unprecedented between the two countries, which have shared historical and cultural ties. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Origin_of_the_conflict" name="Origin_of_the_conflict"></a><h2>Origin of the conflict</h2>
<p>After twenty years of forest industry development, in October 2003, the <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spanish</a> company ENCE <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>, received permission from the Uruguayan government to build a cellulose pulp mill in <a href="/wiki/Fray_Bentos" id="w">Fray Bentos</a>, on the <a href="/wiki/Uruguay_River" id="w">Uruguay River</a> (which forms the natural border in the north between Brazil and Argentina and in the south between Uruguay and <a href="/wiki/Argentina" id="w">Argentina</a>).</p>
<p>Argentinians residing mainly in <a href="/wiki/Gualeguaych%C3%BA" id="w">Gualeguaychú</a>, <a href="/wiki/Entre_R%C3%ADos_Province" id="w">Entre Ríos</a>, about 35 kilometers from Fray Bentos, had been claiming that ENCE&#39;s paper plant would <a href="/wiki/Pollution" id="w">pollute</a> the river. Also, some demonstrations had been organized against ENCE.</p>
<p>After ENCE received its permit, another company, the <a href="/wiki/Finland" id="w">Finnish</a> Botnia, <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> made public their intention to consider the same area for another pulp mill. Botnia received the environmental authorization to build a mill in February 2005.</p>
<p>The Uruguay River is shared by the two countries and is protected by a Treaty, which requires both parties to inform the other of any project that might affect the river. Besides the issue of pollution, Argentina claimed that the Uruguayan government had not asked for permission to build the plants. Uruguayan authorities counter that the Treaty does not require that permission be obtained, but merely that the other part be appropriately informed, and that conversations had indeed been held and filed, without objections on the Argentinian part. In addition, they claim that the technology used in the plants would avoid polluting the river to the extent claimed by Argentinians. Furthermore, Botnia argues the plant will in fact have a positive impact on the river&#39;s waters as the factory&#39;s state-of-the-art waste cleansing equipment is going to be used for local <a href="/wiki/Sewage_treatment" id="w">sewage treatment</a> as well. Currently <a href="/wiki/Sewage" id="w">sewage</a> from the city of Fray Bentos is not treated. Botnia&#39;s claims are backed by neutral expert statements given to the <a href="/wiki/IFC" id="w">IFC</a>.<sup id="_ref-botniapressrelease_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-botniapressrelease" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

On <a href="/wiki/30_April" id="w">30 April</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, just two months after President Vazquez and his government took power in Uruguay, a large group of 10,000-20,000 people (residents of Gualeguaychú and nearby, as well as environmental groups from Argentina) blocked the international <a href="/wiki/Libertador_General_San_Mart%C3%ADn_Bridge" id="w">Libertador General San Martín Bridge</a> (between Gualeguaychú and Fray Bentos) protesting the installation of the cellulose factories.</p>
<p>The protest gained importance and diplomatic weight, when the governor of Entre Ríos, <a href="/wiki/Jorge_Busti" id="w">Jorge Busti</a>, stated his support for it, and in July the Argentine chancellor <a href="/wiki/Rafael_Bielsa" id="w">Rafael Bielsa</a> went personally to Gualeguaychú to meet the residents.</p>
<p>In September of 2005, the Center for Human Rights and Environment <a href="/wiki/Http://www.cedha.org.ar_CEDHA" id="w">http://www.cedha.org.ar CEDHA</a>, filed a <a class="externallink" href="http://www.cedha.org.ar/en/initiatives/paper_pulp_mills/cao-complaint-letter.doc" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cedha.org.ar/en/initiatives/paper_pulp_mills/cao-complaint-letter.doc">complaint to the Compliance Advisory Ombudsman (CAO)</a> of the World Bank (which oversees IFC project compliance with social and environmental norms). The CAO eventually released two reports <a class="externallink" href="http://www.cedha.org.ar/docs/cao-preliminary-assessment-eng.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cedha.org.ar/docs/cao-preliminary-assessment-eng.pdf">Preliminary Report</a> and <a class="externallink" href="http://www.cedha.org.ar/en/initiatives/paper_pulp_mills/cao-final-audit-report-eng.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cedha.org.ar/en/initiatives/paper_pulp_mills/cao-final-audit-report-eng.pdf">Audit</a>, the audit report was critical of the procedures the IFC followed pertaining to the project.</p>
<p>A draft cumulative impact study of the two mills by the <a href="/wiki/International_Finance_Corporation" id="w">International Finance Corporation</a> (IFC) of the <a href="/wiki/World_Bank_Group" id="w">World Bank</a> was released on <a href="/wiki/19_December" id="w">19 December</a>. According to it, the technical requirements of the plants had been fulfilled and the quality of the water and the air in the region should not be harmed. The IFC said it would wait for further consultations to be made before finalizing the study and thus before financing the projects.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/23_December" id="w">23 December</a>, about 50 Gualeguaychú residents again blocked Route 136 and the General San Martín Bridge, using rubble, logs and vehicles. The block, slated for 8 a.m., started at 5 a.m., angering many drivers who were forced to take a detour to the next bridge, which goes from <a href="/wiki/Col%C3%B3n%2C_Entre_R%C3%ADos" id="w">Colón</a> to <a href="/wiki/Paysand%C3%BA" id="w">Paysandú</a>. Later this bridge was blocked as well. Many Argentinians usually travel to Uruguay in the summer, beginning immediately before <a href="/wiki/Christmas" id="w">Christmas</a>.</p>

On <a href="/wiki/26_December" id="w">26 December</a>, the Uruguayan chancellor <a href="/wiki/Reinaldo_Gargano" id="w">Reinaldo Gargano</a> accused Argentina of violating <a href="/wiki/Mercosur" id="w">Mercosur</a> regulations on freedom of circulation of goods, and spoke to Argentine chancellor <a href="/wiki/Jorge_Taiana" id="w">Jorge Taiana</a>, requesting that measures be taken to avoid harming the tourist season. A few hours later, Argentina ratified the protest, asked to suspend the factories&#39; construction, and threatened to make the matter a legal conflict.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Citizens%26%2339%3B_Environmental_Assembly_of_Gualeguaych%C3%BA" id="w">Citizens&#39; Environmental Assembly of Gualeguaychú</a> simultaneously blocked the three bridges that link the province of Entre Ríos with Uruguay on <a href="/wiki/30_December" id="w">30 December</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>. The following days saw intermittent blockades and protests, with volunteers handing pamphlets and explaining the passers-by the reasons for their rejection of the paper factories.</p>
<p>Argentine Head of Environmental Affairs, <a href="/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Estrada_Oyuela" id="w">Raúl Estrada Oyuela</a>, went on record proposing to <a href="/wiki/Boycott" id="w">boycott</a> the production of the plants. On <a href="/wiki/2_January" id="w">2 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> the Uruguayan government rejected this forcefully.
<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>
The <a href="/wiki/Municipal_intendant_(Uruguay)" id="w">municipal intendant</a> of <a href="/wiki/R%C3%ADo_Negro_Department" id="w">Río Negro Department</a>, <a href="/wiki/Omar_Lafluf" id="w">Omar Lafluf</a>, said that most Uruguayans supported the factories; a survey released on <a href="/wiki/5_January" id="w">5 January</a> showed that only 16% were against them. 
<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>At this point, <a href="/wiki/Greenpeace" id="w">Greenpeace</a> activists met with Uruguayan officials to request suspension of the works. The Uruguayan government prepared a pamphlet to be handed out to Argentine tourists, informing them of the technical aspects of environmental safety of the factories. The road blocks soon became scheduled events. Greenpeace later refused to take any further action, claiming that as long as Botnia does not pollute the river and follows the same conditions requested to build and run a plant of this sort in Europe, there is no problem with the cellulose plant at all. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Chile" id="w">Chile</a> became indirectly involved, as several Chilean trucks carrying equipment and materials for Botnia project across Argentina were detained by the blocks before they could cross the border to Uruguay near the end of their journey.</p>
<p>Upon a request by governor Busti, on <a href="/wiki/25_January" id="w">25 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> the Argentine national government announced it would take the issue to the <a href="/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice" id="w">International Court of Justice</a> in <a href="/wiki/The_Hague" id="w">The Hague</a>, accusing Uruguay of violating the bilateral Treaty of Uruguay River dealing with the conservation of the Uruguay River. Uruguay&#39;s chancellor Gargano called this &#34;a grave step&#34; which bypasses and ignores the institutions of the Mercosur, and said Uruguay will protest the lack of action of the Argentine government with regards to the road blocks at the <a href="/wiki/Mercosur_Controversy_Resolution_Tribunal" id="w">Controversy Resolution Tribunal</a> of <a href="/wiki/Asunci%C3%B3n" id="w">Asunción</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/30_January" id="w">30 January</a> the High Level Technical Group (<i>Grupo Técnico de Alto Nivel</i>, GTAN), a joint Argentine-Uruguayan commission for the study of the impact of the paper factories, ended deliberations with the two countries issuing separate statements. The Argentine Foreign Ministry accuses the Uruguayan members of GTAN of withholding information, while the Uruguayan officials deny it. The GTAN had been gathered 180 days before, as mandated by the Uruguay River Statute. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The government of Entre Ríos, in the meantime, distributed 100,000 pamphlets about the paper factories and their alleged impact among the public of the <a href="/wiki/Cosqu%C3%ADn" id="w">Cosquín</a> music festival in <a href="/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba_Province_(Argentina)" id="w">Córdoba</a>, which ended on <a href="/wiki/29_January" id="w">29 January</a>.</p>
<a id="February_2006" name="February_2006"></a><h2>February 2006</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/6_February" id="w">6 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> Uruguayan President <a href="/wiki/Tabar%C3%A9_V%C3%A1zquez" id="w">Tabaré Vázquez</a> acknowledged that he had spoken on the phone to Argentine President <a href="/wiki/N%C3%A9stor_Kirchner" id="w">Néstor Kirchner</a> the previous week, in order to look for a solution of the conflict. Regardless, he also announced that on any event the construction of the plants would not be halted by the Uruguayan government.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/3_February" id="w">3 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> members of the Gualeguaychú Environmental Assembly had started a long-term blockade of Route 136 that leads to the Libertador General San Martín Bridge and to Fray Bentos. Several votings were since conducted on the issue, in every case resolving to maintain the blockade.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the blockade, <a href="/wiki/Jorge_Eduardo_Lozano" id="w">Jorge Eduardo Lozano</a>, designated bishop of Gualeguaychú, stated that he supported the protesters because theirs was &#34;a just cause&#34;, though he also spoke of the need to look for &#34;reasonable alternatives&#34;. The archbishop of <a href="/wiki/Montevideo" id="w">Montevideo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_Cotugno" id="w">Nicolás Cotugno</a>, offered to mediate.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the citizens of Gualeguaychú, after an assembly, rejected the mediation of Peace Nobel Prize <a href="/wiki/Adolfo_P%C3%A9rez_Esquivel" id="w">Adolfo Pérez Esquivel</a>. Pérez Esquivel had asked them to end the blockades while talks were conducted.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/12_February" id="w">12 February</a> about 400 people, gathered by the <a href="/wiki/Col%C3%B3n%2C_Entre_R%C3%ADos" id="w">Colón</a> Environmental Assembly, went in nearly 100 vehicles from Colón (100 km north of Gualeguaychú) to the international <a href="/wiki/General_Artigas_Bridge" id="w">General Artigas Bridge</a>, demonstrating there and creating a traffic disruption. This temporal measure was followed, on <a href="/wiki/16_February" id="w">16 February</a>, by a blockade of Route 135 and the bridge, which links Colón with <a href="/wiki/Paysand%C3%BA" id="w">Paysandú</a> in Uruguay. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>All these earlier actions were targeted to impact the public hearings of Cumulative Impact Study, held by IFC on 14 and 16 in both Montevideo and Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/20_February" id="w">20 February</a> the Uruguayan government decided to accuse Argentina before the <a href="/wiki/Organization_of_American_States" id="w">Organization of American States</a>, for its lack of action on the matter of the blocks. The same day, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Argentina" id="w">Supreme Court of Argentina</a> rejected the case presented by Argentinians against Uruguay, returning it to Guillermo Quadrini, federal judge of <a href="/wiki/Concepci%C3%B3n_del_Uruguay" id="w">Concepción del Uruguay</a>.</p>
<p>The School of Chemistry of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_the_Republic%2C_Uruguay" id="w">University of the Republic, Uruguay</a>, released an open letter to Uruguayan society on <a href="/wiki/February_22" id="w">February 22</a>.
<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>
They reported that TCF-derived paper can be recycled less times than ECF-derived paper. TCF process is 5% more expensive and needs 10% more fuel and wood to obtain the same quantity of paper than ECF process; therefore, it releases 10% more <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" id="w">greenhouse effect</a> gases. The letter stated that ECF and TCF are accepted as &#34;best available technologies&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Developed_countries" id="w">developed countries</a>, and toxic emissions are minimal (specially <a href="/wiki/Dioxin" id="w">dioxins</a>), which implies that emissions depend on management and controls, not on whether TCF or ECF processes are used.</p>

They jointly asked the participants for the suspension of both the construction of the cellulose plants and the road blocks, in order to discuss the matter. Two new meetings were scheduled, to take place in Anchorena, Uruguay, and Mar del Plata, Argentina. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> In the following days, President Vázquez received harsh criticism from the political opposition, and backtracked publicly stating that Uruguay &#34;will not negotiate under pressure&#34;. <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The Gualeguaychú Environmental Assembly met with Governor Busti to hear the proposal, but then decided to keep the blockade for the moment and reconsider.</p>
<p>16th of March, a demonstration of about 10,000 participants was held in Fray Bentos, Uruguay for the pulp mills. The participants defended their rights and the sovereignty of Uruguay.</p>
<a id="Gualeguaych%C3%BA_lifts_the_blockade" name="Gualeguaych%C3%BA_lifts_the_blockade"></a><h3>Gualeguaychú lifts the blockade</h3>
<p>The Assembly gathered again, with an unusually large attendance, on <a href="/wiki/20_March" id="w">20 March</a>. After discussing several proposals, they voted to lift the blockades on Route 136 and the Libertador General San Martín Bridge (which had lasted 45 days), starting the following day, and wait 7 days for the Uruguayan government to reciprocate (suspending the construction of the plants in order to discuss). Uruguayan Chancellor Gargano had previously stated that freeing the roads was a <i>sine qua non</i> condition to start negotiations. <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The Environmental Assembly of Colón, on the other hand, decided to continue blocking Route 135 and the international pass over the General Artigas Bridge, 80 km north of Gualeguaychú. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Suspension_of_works" name="Suspension_of_works"></a><h3>Suspension of works</h3>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/26_March" id="w">26 March</a> one of the companies building the cellulose plants, Botnia, announced that it would suspend the installation works for 90 days &#34;in order to contribute to the opening of dialogue and answering to the request of Presidents Tabaré Vázquez y Néstor Kirchner.&#34; Botnia is so far the largest private investment in the history of Uruguay, and it had completed 45% of the project, but not started the plants themselves. The news caused concern among European stockholders. <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> ENCE, whose construction had not yet started at all, also informally agreed to suspend the works.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, the ombudsman of the World Bank, Meg Taylor, concluded that the review carried out by the IFC about the cellulose plants had been &#34;incomplete&#34; and its procedures not rigorous enough. These conclusions were delivered to the government of Entre Ríos, which in turn passed them on to President Kirchner to be analyzed in the upcoming presidential meeting in Colonia, Uruguay. <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/30_March" id="w">30 March</a>, Botnia sent the construction workers union (SUNCA) a communique which stated that the suspension had been revised and work should continue normally. The company would halt the works for only ten days. When this was confirmed, the Colonia meeting, which had been postponed once already, was cancelled. On <a href="/wiki/5_April" id="w">5 April</a>, after deliberations, the Gualeguaychú Assembly resumed the blockade of Route 136. <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>

<p>The relationship between the political actors of both countries became tense after the resumption of the blockade. Catholic Church leaders in both vowed to facilitate the dialogue (though specifically not to act as mediators). <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> The governments of Finland and Spain denied the possibility of intervening in the affairs involving Botnia and ENCE. The Finnish Minister of Foreign Trade and Cooperation for Development, <a href="/wiki/Paula_Lehtom%C3%A4ki" id="w">Paula Lehtomäki</a>, cancelled a visit to Argentina citing a concern that she might not be welcome, and stated that the conflict was to be solved among Argentina, Uruguay and the two private companies. <sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Uruguay threatened to resort to the <a href="/wiki/World_Trade_Organization" id="w">World Trade Organization</a>, since the blockades &#34;violate basic principles of international commerce&#34; and were not cleared by the Argentine authorities, thus causing an economic loss to Uruguay (which they estimated at $400 million).

<p>During an official visit to Mexico, Uruguayan president <a href="/wiki/Tabar%C3%A9_V%C3%A1zquez" id="w">Tabaré Vázquez</a> said that &#34;while leaders are talking about an integration process, one of these countries&#34; (Argentina) &#34;is discriminating against another one with a blockade.&#34; He added that that was &#34;a policy of disintegration&#34;, and proposed, once more, to discuss the issue using Mercosur&#39;s established institutions. <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

During their defense at the ICJ, the Uruguayan authorities pointed to the fact that the plants were to use a technology known as Elemental Chlorine-Free (or ECF) <a href="/wiki/Bleach" id="w">bleaching</a> (employing <a href="/wiki/Chlorine_dioxide" id="w">chlorine dioxide</a>), which has been adopted by both the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and the <a href="/wiki/European_Union" id="w">European Union</a> as the &#34;best available technology&#34; in their <a href="/wiki/Wood_pulp" id="w">wood pulp</a> processing environmental regulations, and that an independent <a href="/wiki/World_Bank_Group" id="w">World Bank</a> study has supported their position. As to the alleged violation of the Treaty of the Uruguay River, Uruguay&#39;s legal defense team asserted that discussions over the building of the plants were conducted, and that Argentine officials offered no objections <sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>After two months of calm while the International Court of Justice in The Hague studied the Argentine accusation, the conflict was re-ignited on <a href="/wiki/July_13" id="w">July 13</a>, when the ICJ ruled that Argentina had not convinced the court that Uruguay&#39;s actions at present were enough to grant a provisional measure halting the construction of the two cellulose plants. This judgment did not settle the question of whether Uruguay is ultimately breaching its Treaty obligations to Argentina, but ruled that no imminent danger of irreparable damage exists at the moment, and that Uruguay may still be liable to Argentina if it is later found in the final judgment that Uruguay is indeed in breach of Treaty obligations. Judges at the ICJ voted 14–1 in Uruguay&#39;s favour (the only vote against Uruguay was cast by the judge appointed by Argentina).

<a id="Uruguay's_demands_before_the_Mercosur_Tribunal" name="Uruguay's_demands_before_the_Mercosur_Tribunal"></a><h3>Uruguay&#39;s demands before the Mercosur Tribunal</h3>
<p>Starting in June, Uruguay demanded before the Mercosur Tribunal that Argentina be punished for the blockades, and that it be forced to pay reparations, following the Treaty of Asunción, which guarantees the free circulation of goods and services between Mercosur members. On <a href="/wiki/9_August" id="w">9 August</a>, Uruguayan representatives presented their claims, centered in two points: first, that the blockades during the summer had caused grave economic damage to Uruguay (calculated in $400 million losses); and second, that the Argentine government did not act to prevent or lift the blockades.
<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Argentine witnesses testified, instead, that the Kirchner administration did have an active stance and tried to soften the effects of the blockades, and showed that there had been a 33% increase in the bilateral trade between the period January–May 2005 and the same period of 2006 despite the blocks.</p>
<p>Uruguay also demanded that the Argentine government be forced to act in case of future blockades. The Argentine Foreign Relations Ministry was reportedly confident that the tribunal would not heed such demands, since hypothetical future violations are not subject to it, according to <a href="/wiki/Jurisprudence" id="w">jurisprudence</a>, and moreover, that the tribunal&#39;s dictates would remain symbolical, given that the blockades were discontinued, even before Uruguay&#39;s demands were presented.</p>
<p>The tribunal, an <i>ad hoc</i> assembly formed by three arbiters (one Argentine, one Uruguayan and one Spanish) gathered in <a href="/wiki/Asunci%C3%B3n" id="w">Asunción</a>, heard the allegations and, on <a href="/wiki/7_September" id="w">7 September</a>, ruled that Argentina had acted &#34;on good faith&#34;, and rejected the request for monetary sanctions, but it noted the blockades had caused &#34;undeniable inconveniences to both Uruguayan and Argentine trade, in addition the violation of the free circulation right.&#34; Both governments acknowledged the tribunal&#39;s report as positive to their respective causes.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/20_September" id="w">20 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, the management of ENCE&#39;s plant dismissed 40 of its employees. The implicit cancellation of the project was confirmed the next day, when the company&#39;s president Juan Luis Arregui announced that the construction of the Fray Bentos plant (some earthworks only started) would not be continued, though there are plans to relocate the project to another region in Uruguay. Arregui also said that they &#34;might have made a mistake&#34; and explained why, in his view, &#34;there cannot be two [cellulose] plants in Fray Bentos.&#34;
<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>
<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup>
According to Arregui, Fray Bentos lacks sufficient infrastructure to support the lorries needed. But ENCE has known for years that its factory would be just 6 km (4 miles) from the one being built by Botnia and, as of May 2006, it was still vowing that it would never move from the riverside site. Arregui was known to have met with Argentine officials in June. In a critical report, <i>The Economist</i> proposes that Arregui might actually have come under pressure from the Argentine government, known for its interventionism in economy, maybe as a show of strength by President Néstor Kirchner faced with the upcoming <a href="/wiki/Argentine_general_election%2C_2007" id="w">2007 elections</a>.
<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Botnia&#39;s project is much more advanced than ENCE&#39;s, and employs 4,500 workers. After a strike started on <a href="/wiki/12_September" id="w">12 September</a>, demanding that no more workers be brought from abroad and equal pay for local and foreign workers already in the project, the management decided to pause the construction &#34;due to a lack of guarantees and until the conditions required for the development of this project are re-established.&#34; The construction works restarted <a href="/wiki/7_October" id="w">7 October</a> with a unanimous decision by the construction workers.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/24_September" id="w">24 September</a>, thousands of Gualeguaychú residents marched with cars, motorcycles, and bicycles along Route 136, effectively blocking traffic for more than 3 hours, celebrating ENCE&#39;s withdrawal and demanding that Botnia follow suit. 
<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup>
At the same time, following rumours that ENCE would move the location of the plants to <a href="/wiki/Paysand%C3%BA" id="w">Paysandú</a>, also on the Uruguay River, some 4,000 residents of Colón, opposite Paysandú, gathered before the international bridge to protest that possibility. The mayors of both cities met the following day to discuss the issue.

<p>In reaction to the study, the Gualeguaychú Assembly decided to block the international road again during the following long weekend (Columbus Day Weekend). The leaflets distributed for travellers described dire consequences for the life in Gualeguaychú (dioxin pollution, acid rain, increased incidence of cancer) when the mills start operations (the same accusations available in CEDHA homepages). Meanwhile, activists in Buenos Aires started a campaign calling Argentinians to stay in Argentina for the summer vacations instead of going to Uruguay. <sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> The Argentine government and the provincial Entre Ríos government released a joint statement showing disagreement with the blockade, and laying the blame on the Assembly &#34;for any harm that [the blockade] may cause to Argentine interests&#34;, but did not take any specific measures to prevent the blockade.
