The film is directed by <a href="/wiki/Zack_Snyder" id="w">Zack Snyder</a> with Frank Miller attached as an <a href="/wiki/Executive_producer" id="w">executive producer</a> and consultant, and was shot mostly with <a href="/wiki/Bluescreen" id="w">bluescreen</a> to duplicate the imagery of the original comic book.</p>

<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h2>Plot</h2>
 

<p>A Spartan named Dilios narrates of the young <a href="/wiki/Leonidas_I" id="w">Leonidas</a> undergoing his <a href="/wiki/Agoge" id="w">childhood training</a>, explaining the rigors of Spartan life. Leonidas is cast out into the wild, and survives the harsh winter to return to his home, when he is crowned King. Dilios then tells the story of the Persian messengers arriving at <a href="/wiki/Sparta" id="w">Sparta</a> and demanding Sparta&#39;s submission to King <a href="/wiki/Xerxes_I_of_Persia" id="w">Xerxes</a>. Outraged and offended at their behavior, King <a href="/wiki/Leonidas_I" id="w">Leonidas</a> kicks the messenger into a pit; the other messengers suffer the same fate. Resolving to face the Persians, Leonidas visits <a href="/wiki/Pythia" id="w">the Oracle</a>, proposing a strategy to repel the numerically superior enemy, and offers the priests a customary payment in gold. The priests, called <a href="/wiki/Ephors" id="w">Ephors</a>, having already been bribed by Xerxes, interpret the Oracle&#39;s message to mean that Sparta should not go to war, so as to not interrupt the sacred <a href="/wiki/Carneian_festival" id="w">Carneian festival</a>.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">King Leonidas fighting soldiers of the Persian Empire</div></div>
</p>
<p>Despite the warning, Leonidas gathers 300 of his best soldiers to fight the Persians, selecting only those who have already sired male children, so that their <a href="/wiki/Family_name" id="w">family name</a> can continue even after their death. As they march north, they are joined by a group of <a href="/wiki/Arcadia" id="w">Arcadians</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Greeks" id="w">Greeks</a>. Arriving at the narrow cliffs of <a href="/wiki/Thermopylae" id="w">Thermopylae</a> (referred to as the &#34;Hot Gates&#34;), in sight of the Persian army, they build a wall to contain the Persians&#39; advance immediately in front of their position. <a href="/wiki/Ephialtes_of_Trachis" id="w">Ephialtes</a>, a hunchbacked Spartan whose parents had fled to save him from <a href="/wiki/Sparta#Society" id="w">customary infanticide</a>, approaches Leonidas, requesting to redeem his father&#39;s name in battle, and warning him about a secret goat path that the Persians could use to outflank them, and surround them. Leonidas turns him away because he is unable to properly hold the shield, and would therefore create a weak spot in the <a href="/wiki/Phalanx_formation" id="w">phalanx</a>. </p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Xerxes encourages Leonidas to surrender</div></div>

Before the battle starts, the Persians ask that the 300 drop their arms. Leonidas responds: &#34;Persians! <a href="/wiki/Molon_labe" id="w">Come and get them</a>!&#34; The Spartans use the phalanx formation, the narrow terrain, and their fighting skill with shield, spear and sword to effectively fight off numerically superior waves of attackers, driving the regular Persian infantry off of a cliff and withstanding a cavalry charge without any losses. Xerxes, impressed after the two armies&#39; first engagement, personally approaches Leonidas and attempts to bribe him with wealth and power in exchange for his surrender. The Spartan king declines, saying that he will instead make the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Divine_king" id="w">God King</a>&#34; bleed. The Spartans then face the <a href="/wiki/Persian_Immortals" id="w">Immortals</a>, losing a few of their number to the Persian elite guards but still defeating them, with Leonidas personally killing the Uber-Immortal. The Spartans prevail over other types of troops from the vast reaches of the Persian empire, including Mongolian barbarians and their rhinos, soldiers with explosive grenades, and Indian war elephants. However, their last victory is overshadowed by the death of Captain Artemis&#39; eldest son Astinos. Two days after the fighting begins, an embittered Ephialtes reveals the location of the goat path to Xerxes, having been promised a lucrative and powerful position in the Persian Empire.</p>
<p>Back in Sparta, <a href="/wiki/Gorgo%2C_Queen_of_Sparta" id="w">Queen Gorgo</a>, upon the advice of a loyal councilman, attempts to enlist the influential Theron to help her persuade the Spartan council to send reinforcements to Leonidas. Theron agrees to help, but demands that Gorgo submit sexually to him; Gorgo reluctantly consents to his advances. Meanwhile, the Greeks realize that Ephialtes has betrayed them, and the Arcadians decide to retreat in the face of certain death. The Spartans refuse to follow, <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae#Epitaph of Simonides" id="w">obedient to their law</a>. Leonidas orders only one man, Dilios, to retreat and use his rhetorical skills to tell the story of the 300 to the Spartan people, ensuring that they be remembered. Dilios reluctantly leaves with the Arcadians. At Sparta, Queen Gorgo appears in front of the council, but is not supported by Theron, who furthermore accuses her of adultery. The Queen, enraged at this betrayal, snatches a sword from a nearby soldier and kills Theron. When Persian coins fall from his purse, the Council denounces him as a traitor and unites against Persia.</p>
<p>At Thermopylae, the Persians have surrounded the 300 on all sides. Xerxes&#39;s <a href="/wiki/General_Officer" id="w">general</a> demands their surrender, saying that Leonidas may keep his title as <a href="/wiki/Kings_of_Sparta" id="w">King of Sparta</a> and become <a href="/wiki/Warlord" id="w">warlord</a> of all Greece, answerable only to Xerxes. Ephialtes begs him to do so as well; Leonidas quips back &#34;may you live forever&#34; (the ultimate Spartan insult, as they wish to die in battle). After feinting submission Leonidas orders his man to cut down the general, causing Xerxes to order his troops to attack. The remaining Spartans are killed in the hail of arrows; Leonidas finally falls, but not before delivering on his promise to &#34;make the &#39;God King&#39; bleed&#34;, wounding him on the cheek with a thrown spear. The Persian king is visibly shaken at this reminder of his own mortality. Dilios eventually returns to Sparta and inspires the council with the bravery of the 300.</p>
<p>Dilios finishes his tale on a new battlefield surrounded by raptly listening soldiers. He concludes that the Persian army, who lost countless numbers defeating a mere 300 Spartans a year earlier, must now be terrified to face 10,000 Spartans and 30,000 Greeks from the other <a href="/wiki/City-state" id="w">city-states</a>. The roused Greek host charges the Persian army, beginning the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Plataea" id="w">Battle of Plataea</a>.</p>

<p>Producer Gianni Nunnari was not the only person planning a film about the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae" id="w">Battle of Thermopylae</a>; director <a href="/wiki/Michael_Mann_(film_director)" id="w">Michael Mann</a> already planned a film of the battle based on the book <i><a href="/wiki/Gates_of_Fire" id="w">Gates of Fire</a></i>. Nunnari discovered Frank Miller&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Graphic_novel" id="w">graphic novel</a> <i>300</i>, which impressed him enough to acquire the film rights.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> <i>300</i> was jointly produced by Nunnari and Mark Canton, and Michael B. Gordon wrote the script.<sup id="_ref-review_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-review" title="">[3]</a></sup> Director <a href="/wiki/Zack_Snyder" id="w">Zack Snyder</a> was hired in June 2004<sup id="_ref-commands_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-commands" title="">[4]</a></sup> as he had attempted to make a film on Miller&#39;s novel before making his debut with the remake of <i><a href="/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Dead_(2004_film)" id="w">Dawn of the Dead</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Snyder then got Screenwriter Kurt Johnstad to rewrite Gordon&#39;s script for production<sup id="_ref-commands_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-commands" title="">[4]</a></sup> and Frank Miller was retained as consultant and executive producer.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The film is a <a href="/wiki/Shot-for-shot_adaptation" id="w">shot-for-shot adaptation</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Comic_book" id="w">comic book</a>, similar to the film adaptation of <i><a href="/wiki/Sin_City_(film)" id="w">Sin City</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-attila_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-attila" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Snyder photocopied panels from the comic book, from which he planned the preceding and succeeding shots. &#34;It was a fun process for me... to have a frame as a goal to get to,&#34; he said.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Like the comic book, the adaptation also used the character Dilios as a narrator. Snyder used this narrative technique to show the audience that the surreal &#34;Frank Miller world&#34; of <i>300</i> was related from a subjective perspective. By utilizing Dilios&#39; gift of storytelling, he is able to introduce fantasy elements into the film, explaining that &#34;Dilios is a guy who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth.&#34;<sup id="_ref-scifi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scifi" title="">[9]</a></sup> Snyder also added the <a href="/wiki/Subplot" id="w">sub-plot</a> in which Queen Gorgo attempts to rally support for her husband.<sup id="_ref-sharp_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sharp" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Two months of <a href="/wiki/Pre-production" id="w">pre-production</a> were required to create hundreds of shields, spears and swords, some of which were recycled from <i><a href="/wiki/Troy_(film)" id="w">Troy</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Alexander_(film)" id="w">Alexander</a></i>. An <a href="/wiki/Audio-Animatronics" id="w">animatronic</a> wolf and thirteen animatronic horses were also created. The actors trained alongside the stuntmen, and even Snyder joined in. Upwards of 600 costumes were created for the film, as well as extensive prosthetics for various characters and the corpses of Persian soldiers.<sup id="_ref-SHH set visit_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SHH set visit" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>300</i> entered active production on <a href="/wiki/October_17" id="w">October 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> in <a href="/wiki/Montreal" id="w">Montreal</a>,<sup id="_ref-counts_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-counts" title="">[12]</a></sup> and was shot over the course of sixty days<sup id="_ref-SHH set visit_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SHH set visit" title="">[11]</a></sup> in chronological order<sup id="_ref-sharp_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sharp" title="">[10]</a></sup> with a budget of $60 million.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Employing the <a href="/wiki/Digital_backlot" id="w">digital backlot</a> technique, Snyder shot at the now-defunct Icestorm Studios in Montreal using <a href="/wiki/Bluescreen" id="w">bluescreens</a>. Butler said that while he didn&#39;t feel constrained by Snyder&#39;s direction, fidelity to the comic imposed certain limitations on his performance. Wenham said there were times when Snyder wanted to precisely capture iconic moments from the comic book, and other times when he gave actors freedom &#34;to explore within the world and the confines that had been set&#34;.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Headey said of her experience with the bluescreens, &#34;It&#39;s very odd, and emotionally, there&#39;s nothing to connect to apart from another actor.&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Only one scene, in which horses travel across the countryside, was shot outdoors.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> The film was an intensely physical production, and Butler pulled an arm tendon and developed a <a href="/wiki/Foot_drop" id="w">foot drop</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Post-production" id="w">Post-production</a> was handled by Montreal&#39;s Meteor Studios and Hybride Technologies filled in the bluescreen footage with more than 1500 <a href="/wiki/Visual_effects" id="w">visual effects</a> shots. <a href="/wiki/Visual_effects_supervisor" id="w">Visual effects supervisor</a> Chris Watts and <a href="/wiki/Production_designer" id="w">production designer</a> Jim Bissell created a process dubbed &#34;The Crush,&#34;<sup id="_ref-SHH set visit_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SHH set visit" title="">[11]</a></sup> which allowed the Meteor artists to manipulate the colors by increasing the contrast of light and dark. Certain sequences were <a href="/wiki/Saturation_(color_theory)" id="w">desaturated</a> and tinted to establish different moods.

<a id="Controversy" name="Controversy"></a><h3>Controversy</h3>

<p>Prior to the release of <i>300</i>, Warner Brothers expressed concerns about the political aspects of the film&#39;s theme. Snyder relates that &#34;There was a huge sensitivity about East versus West with the studio.&#34;<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup>
Media speculation about a possible parallel between the Greco-Persian conflict and current events began in an interview with Snyder that was conducted before the Berlin Film Festival.<sup id="_ref-politics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-politics" title="">[81]</a></sup> The interviewer remarked that &#34;everyone is sure to be translating this [film] into contemporary politics.&#34; Snyder replied that, while he was aware that people would read the film through the lens of contemporary events, no parallels between the film and the contemporary world were intended.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Slovenia" id="w">Slovenian</a> philosopher and author <a href="/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek" id="w">Slavoj Žižek</a> defended the movie from those who attacked it as an example of &#34;the worst kind of patriotic militarism with clear allusions to recent tensions with Iran and Iraq.&#34; He wrote that the story represents a &#34;poor, small country (Greece) invaded by the army of a much larger state (Persia),&#34; suggesting that the identification of the Spartans with a modern superpower is flawed. Instead of seeing a &#34;fundamentalist&#34; aspect in the Spartan identity, he stated that &#34;all modern egalitarian radicals, from <a href="/wiki/Rousseau" id="w">Rousseau</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Jacobin_Club" id="w">Jacobins</a>…imagined the republican France as a new Sparta&#34;.<sup id="_ref-The _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The " title="">[111]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In response to the criticisms, a Warner Bros. spokesman stated that the film <i>300</i> &#34;is a work of fiction inspired by the Frank Miller graphic novel and loosely based on a historical event.
