<p><b>Cuba and the United States of America</b>  have had interest in one another since well before either of their independence movements. Plans for purchase of the nearby island have been put forward at various times by the United States. As the <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spanish</a> influence waned in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" id="w">Caribbean</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> gradually gained a position of economic and political dominance over the island, with the vast majority of foreign investment holdings, the bulk of imports and exports in its hands, and a major stake in <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuban</a> political affairs to uphold.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Revolution" id="w">Cuban Revolution</a> of 1959 relations deteriorated substantially, and have since been marked by tension and confrontation. The United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Cuba and has maintained an <a href="/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba" id="w">embargo</a> which makes it illegal for U.S. corporations to do business with Cuba. U.S. diplomatic representation in Cuba is handled by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Interests_Section_in_Havana" id="w">United States Interests Section in Havana</a> and a similar Cuban Interests Section remains in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>; both are officially part of the respective embassies of <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>.

Relations between the <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North American</a> mainland and the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_colony" id="w">Spanish colony</a> of Cuba began in the early 18th century through illicit commercial contracts between the European colonies of the <a href="/wiki/New_World" id="w">New World</a>, trading to elude colonial taxes. As both legal and illegal trade increased, Cuba became a comparatively prosperous trading partner in the region, and a center of <a href="/wiki/Tobacco" id="w">tobacco</a> and <a href="/wiki/History_of_sugar_production" id="w">sugar production</a>. During this period Cuban merchants increasingly traveled to North American ports, establishing trade contracts that endured for many years.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution" id="w">rebellion of the thirteen colonies</a> in <a href="/wiki/1776" id="w">1776</a> provided additional trade opportunities between Cuba and North America. Spain opened Cuban ports to North American commerce officially in November 1776 and the island became increasingly dependent on that trade. </p>
<p>After the opening of the island to world trade in 1818, Cuban-United States trade agreements began to replace Spanish commercial connections. In 1820 <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" id="w">Thomas Jefferson</a> thought Cuba &#34;the most interesting addition which could ever be made to our system of States&#34; and told Secretary of War <a href="/wiki/John_C._Calhoun" id="w">John C.

 a letter to U.S. Minister to Spain Hugh Nelson, Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams" id="w">John Quincy Adams</a> described the likelihood of U.S. &#34;annexation of Cuba&#34; within half a century despite obstacles: &#34;But there are laws of political as well as of physical gravitation; and if an apple severed by the tempest from its native tree cannot choose but fall to the ground, Cuba, forcibly disjoined from its own unnatural connection with Spain, and incapable of self support, can gravitate only towards the North American Union, which by the same law of nature cannot cast her off from its bosom.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Franklin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[2]</a></sup> In 1854 a secret proposal known as the <a href="/wiki/Ostend_Manifesto" id="w">Ostend Manifesto</a> was devised by U.S. diplomats to acquire Cuba from Spain for $130 million.

An agreed condition between Cuba and the United States to secure the withdrawal of <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" id="w">United States troops</a> from the island was Cuba&#39;s adoption of the <a href="/wiki/Platt_Amendment" id="w">Platt Amendment</a>.

It was to define the terms of Cuban-U.S. relations for the following 33 years and was bitterly resented by the majority of Cubans. Another consequence of the amendment gave the United States continued use of the southern portion of Guantánamo Bay, where a <a href="/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_Naval_Base" id="w">United States Naval Station</a> had been established in 1898. The lease of the bay was confirmed by the <a href="/wiki/Cuban-American_treaty" id="w">Cuban-American treaty</a> which was signed by the presidents of both nations in February 1903. </p>

However, internal confrontations between the government of <a href="/wiki/Gerardo_Machado" id="w">Gerardo Machado</a> and political opposition led to a military overthrow by Cuban rebels in 1933. <a href="/wiki/United_States_Ambassadors_to_Cuba" id="w">U.S. Ambassador</a> <a href="/wiki/Sumner_Welles" id="w">Sumner Welles</a> requested <a href="/wiki/Instances_of_Use_of_United_States_Armed_Forces_Abroad" id="w">U.S. military intervention</a>.

<p>U.S. President <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" id="w">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> officially recognized the new Cuban government after the 1959 <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Revolution" id="w">Cuban Revolution</a> which had overthrown the Batista government, but relations between the two governments deteriorated rapidly. Within days <a href="/wiki/Earl_T._Smith" id="w">Earl T. Smith</a>, U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, resigned his post to be replaced by <a href="/wiki/Philip_Bonsal" id="w">Philip Bonsal</a>. The US government became increasingly concerned by Cuba&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Agrarian_Reform_Laws_of_Cuba" id="w">agrarian reforms</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Nationalization" id="w">nationalization</a> of US owned industries. Between April 15 and 26th, 1959, Castro and a delegation of representatives visited the U.S. as guests of the Press Club. This visit was perceived by many as a charm offensive on the part of Castro and his recently initiated government, and his visit included laying a wreath at the Lincoln memorial. After a meeting between Castro and Vice-President <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon" id="w">Richard Nixon</a>, where Castro outlined his reform plans for Cuba,<sup id="_ref-BBCrelations_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBCrelations" title="">[13]</a></sup> the US began to impose gradual trade restrictions on the island.  On September 4 1959, Ambassador Bonsal met with Cuban Premier <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" id="w">Fidel Castro</a> to express “serious concern at the treatment being given to American private interests in Cuba both agriculture and utilities.”<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p> 
<p>As the reforms continued, trade restrictions on Cuba increased. The U.S. stopped buying Cuban sugar and refused to supply its former trading partner with much needed oil, creating a devastating effect on the island&#39;s economy. In March 1960, tensions increased when the freighter <a href="/wiki/La_Coubre_explosion" id="w">La Coubre</a> exploded in Havana harbor, killing over 75 people. Fidel Castro blamed the United States and compared the incident to the sinking of the <a href="/wiki/USS_Maine_(ACR-1)" id="w">Maine</a>, though admitting he could provide no evidence for his accusation.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> That same month, President Eisenhower quietly authorized the <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" id="w">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) to organize, train, and equip Cuban refugees as a guerrilla force to overthrow Castro.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Each time the Cuban government nationalized American properties, the American government took countermeasures, resulting in the prohibition of all exports to Cuba on October 19, 1960. Consequently, Cuba began to consolidate trade <a href="/wiki/Cuban-Soviet_relations" id="w">relations with the Soviet Union</a>, leading the US to break off all remaining official diplomatic relations. Later that year, U.S. diplomats Edwin L. Sweet and William G. Friedman were arrested and expelled from the island having been charged with &#34;encouraging terrorist acts, granting asylum, financing subversive publications and smuggling weapons”. </p>
<p>In 1961 Cuba resisted an armed invasion by about 1,500 CIA trained <a href="/wiki/Cuban_exiles" id="w">Cuban exiles</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion" id="w">Bay of Pigs</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> President <a href="/wiki/John_F_Kennedy" id="w">John F Kennedy</a>&#39;s complete assumption of responsibility for the venture, which provoked a popular reaction against the invaders, proved to be a further propaganda boost for the Cuban government.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> The U.S. began the formulation of new plans aimed at destabilizing the Cuban government. These activities were collectively known as the “<a href="/wiki/The_Cuban_Project" id="w">The Cuban Project</a>” (also known as Operation Mongoose). This was to be a co-ordinated program of political, psychological, and military sabotage, involving intelligence operations as well as assassination attempts on key political leaders. The Cuban project also proposed attacks on mainland US targets, hijackings and assaults on Cuban refugee boats to generate U.S. public support for military action against the Cuban government, these proposals were known collectively as <a href="/wiki/Operation_Northwoods" id="w">Operation Northwoods</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence" id="w">U.S. Senate Select Intelligence Committee</a> report later confirmed over eight attempted plots to kill Castro between 1960 and 1965, as well as additional plans against other Cuban leaders.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> After weathering the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, Cuba observed as U.S. armed forces staged a mock invasion of a Caribbean island in 1962 named <a href="/wiki/Operation_Ortsac" id="w">Operation Ortsac</a>. The purpose of the invasion was to overthrow a leader whose name, Ortsac, was Castro spelled backwards.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Castro soon became convinced that the U.S. was serious about invading Cuba leading to a huge military build up on the island. Tensions between the two nations reached their peak in 1962, after U.S. reconnaissance aircraft photographed the Soviet construction of intermediate-range missile sites. The discovery led to the <a href="/wiki/Cuban_missile_crisis" id="w">Cuban missile crisis</a>. </p>
<p>Trade relations also deteriorated in equal measure. In 1962, President <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" id="w">John F. Kennedy</a> broadened the partial trade restrictions imposed after the revolution by Eisenhower to a ban on all trade with Cuba, except for non-subsidized sale of foods and medicines.

The Helms Burton Act states, among other things, that any non-U.S. company that &#34;knowingly traffics in property in Cuba confiscated without compensation from a U.S. person&#34; can be subjected to litigation and that company&#39;s leadership can be barred from entry into the United States.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Economic_sanctions" id="w">Sanctions</a> may also be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. As a result, multinational companies have to choose between Cuba and the U.S., the latter being a much larger market. One important exception is the German-owned delivery company <a href="/wiki/DHL" id="w">DHL</a>. This restriction also applies to maritime shipping, as ships docking at Cuban ports are not allowed to dock at U.S. ports for six months. On <a href="/wiki/October_10" id="w">October 10</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, the United States announced the creation of a task force made up of officials from several US agencies that will pursue more aggressively violators of the US trade embargo against Cuba, with penalties as severe as 10 years of prison and hundreds of dollars in fines for violators of the embargo.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the new millennium, hopes were raised in both countries for a new period of greater understanding. At the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a> Millennium Summit in September 2000, Fidel Castro and US President <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" id="w">Bill Clinton</a> spoke briefly at a group photo session and shook hands. U.N. Secretary-General <a href="/wiki/Kofi_Annan" id="w">Kofi Annan</a> commented afterwards, “For a U.S. president and a Cuban president to shake hands for the first time in over 40 years—I think it is a major symbolic achievement&#34;. While Castro said it was a gesture of “dignity and courtesy,” the <a href="/wiki/White_House" id="w">White House</a> denied the encounter was of any significance.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> In November 2001 US companies began selling food to the country for the first time since Washington imposed the trade embargo after the revolution, and in the following year, former US President <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" id="w">Jimmy Carter</a> became the highest profile US politician invited to Cuba since the Cuban revolution.

Relations deteriorated again following the election of <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">George W. Bush</a>. Bush declared Cuba to be one of the few &#34;<a href="/wiki/Outposts_of_tyranny" id="w">outposts of tyranny</a>&#34; remaining in the world, and his appointed undersecretary to the U.S. State Department, <a href="/wiki/John_R._Bolton" id="w">John R. Bolton</a>, accused Cuba of maintaining a bioweapons program.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Many in the US, including ex-president Carter, expressed doubts about the claim.  Later, Bolton was criticised for pressuring subordinates who questioned the quality of the intelligence John Bolton had used as the basis for the assertion.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Bolton identified the Castro government as part of America&#39;s &#39;axis of evil&#39;, highlighting the fact that the Cuban leader visited several US foes, including <a href="/wiki/Libya" id="w">Libya</a>, <a href="/wiki/Iran" id="w">Iran</a> and <a href="/wiki/Syria" id="w">Syria</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>   Cuba was also identified as a <a href="/wiki/U.S._list_of_state_sponsors_of_international_terrorism" id="w">State Sponsor of Terror by the United States Department of State</a>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> The Cuban government denies the claim, and in turn has accused the U.S. of engaging in <a href="/wiki/State_terrorism_by_United_States_of_America#Cuba" id="w">state sponsored terrorism against Cuba</a>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In January 2006, <a href="/wiki/United_States_Interests_Section_in_Havana" id="w">United States Interests Section in Havana</a> began displaying messages on a scrolling &#34;electronic billboard&#34; in the windows of their top floor. Following a protest march, the Cuban government erected a large number of poles, carrying black flags with single white stars, obscuring the messages.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>On September 8, 2006, it was revealed that at least ten South Florida journalists received regular payments from the U.S. government for programs on <a href="/wiki/Radio_Mart%C3%AD" id="w">Radio Martí</a> and <a href="/wiki/TV_Mart%C3%AD" id="w">TV Martí</a>, two broadcasters aimed at undermining the Cuban government. The payments totaled thousands of dollars over several years.

The Cuban government has long contended that some South Florida Spanish-language journalists were on the federal payroll.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>On September 12, 2006, the United States announced that it had created five inter agency working groups to monitor Cuba and carry out U.S. policies. The groups, some of which operate in a war-room-like setting, were quietly set up after the July 31 announcement that the ailing Cuban leader had temporarily ceded power to a collective leadership headed by his brother Raúl. U.S. officials say three of the newly created groups are headed by the State Department: diplomatic actions; strategic communications and democratic promotion. Another that coordinated humanitarian aid to Cuba is run by the Commerce Department, and a fifth, on migration issues, is run jointly by the National Security Council and the Department of Homeland Security.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Recently, US Congressional auditors have accused the development agency <a href="/wiki/USAID" id="w">USAID</a> of failing properly to administer its program to allegedly promote democracy in Cuba. They said USAID had channelled tens of millions of dollars through exile groups in Miami, which were sometimes wasteful or kept questionable accounts. The report said the organizations had sent items such as chocolate and cashmere jerseys to Cuba. Their report concludes that 30% of the exile groups who received USAID grants showed questionable expenditures. <a class="externallink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6153848.stm" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6153848.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6153848.stm</a></p>
<p>Fabio Leite, director of the Radio communications Office of the <a href="/wiki/International_Telecommunications_Union" id="w">International Telecommunications Union</a> (ITU), has condemned radio and television transmissions to Cuba from the United States as illegal and inadmissible and more so when they are designed to foment internal subversion on the island.

In 2003 the United States <a href="/wiki/Commission_for_Assistance_to_a_Free_Cuba" id="w">Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba</a> was formed to &#34;explore ways the U.S. can help hasten and ease a democratic transition in Cuba&#34;. The commission immediately announced a series of measures which included a tightening of the travel embargo to the island, a crackdown on illegal cash transfers, and a more robust information campaign aimed at Cuba.<sup id="_ref-BBCrelations_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBCrelations" title="">[13]</a></sup> Since 2005 the commission has been chaired by <a href="/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice" id="w">Condoleezza Rice</a> and seeks to integrate the administration&#39;s Cuba policies with all the agencies of the federal government.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> In response, <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" id="w">Fidel Castro</a> called the Commission a &#34;group of shit-eaters who do not deserve the world&#39;s respect&#34;. Castro also referred to Rice as a &#34;mad&#34; woman and US Chief of Mission in Havana <a href="/wiki/Michael_E._Parmly" id="w">Michael E. Parmly</a> as a &#34;little gangster&#34; and a &#34;bully&#34;. Castro has insisted that, in spite of the formation of the Commission, Cuba is itself &#34;in transition: to <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialism</a> [and] to <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">communism</a>&#34; and that it is &#34;ridiculous for the U.S. to threaten Cuba now&#34;.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In April 2006, the <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">Bush administration</a> appointed <a href="/wiki/Caleb_McCarry" id="w">Caleb McCarry</a> &#34;transition coordinator&#34; for Cuba, providing a budget of $59 million, with the task of overthrowing the Cuban government after Castro&#39;s death. Official Cuban news service <a href="/wiki/Granma" id="w">Granma</a> alleges that these transition plans were created at the behest of <a href="/wiki/Cuban_exile" id="w">Cuban exile</a> groups in <a href="/wiki/Miami" id="w">Miami</a>, and that McCarry was responsible for engineering the overthrow of the <a href="/wiki/Jean-Bertrand_Aristide" id="w">Aristide</a> government in <a href="/wiki/Haiti" id="w">Haiti</a>.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup>

<p>In 2006, The Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba released a 93-page report.  The report included a plan that suggested the United States spend $80 million to overthrow the Cuban Government and ensure that Cuba&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Socialist" id="w">Socialist</a> system does not continue after the death of President <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" id="w">Fidel Castro</a>. The plan also includes a classified annex which Cuban officials claim could be a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro or a United States military invasion of Cuba.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Shortly after, The United States named a special &#34;manager&#34; for its intelligence operations against Cuba and Venezuela.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Iran" id="w">Iran</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_Korea" id="w">North Korea</a> are the only other countries that have been assigned so-called &#34;mission managers&#34;, who supervise intelligence operations against them.</p>
<p>Following the temporary <a href="/wiki/2006_Cuban_transfer_of_presidential_duties" id="w">transfer of presidential duties</a> in July 2006 to <a href="/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Castro" id="w">Raúl Castro</a>, brother of Fidel, U.S. government figures have made a series of statements reiterating the desire for political change in Cuba. Raúl Castro responded to these statements saying: &#34;They should be very clear that it is not possible to achieve anything in Cuba with impositions and threats. On the contrary, we have always been disposed to normalize relations on an equal plane. What we do not accept is the arrogant and interventionist policy frequently assumed by the current administration of that country.&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>During a military parade on December 2, 2006, Raúl Castro stated; &#34;We take this opportunity to once again state that we are willing to resolve at the negotiating table the long-standing dispute between the United States and Cuba.&#34; He said talks were only possible if the U.S. government respected Cuba&#39;s independence and did not interfere in its internal affairs. The United States, however, rejected the offer of talks, stating that &#34;it saw no point in a dialogue with what it called the Caribbean island&#39;s &#34;dictator-in-waiting.&#34; <a class="externallink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20061204/wl_nm/cuba_usa_castro_dc_1" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20061204/wl_nm/cuba_usa_castro_dc_1">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20061204/wl_nm/cuba_usa_castro_dc_1</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20061203/wl_nm/cuba_castro_usa_dc_2" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20061203/wl_nm/cuba_castro_usa_dc_2">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20061203/wl_nm/cuba_castro_usa_dc_2</a></p>

The US continues to operate a naval base at Guantánamo Bay. It is leased to the US and only mutual agreement or US abandonment of the area can terminate the lease. The US pays Cuba annually for its lease, but Cuba does not accept the nominal fee.
