<p><b>MegaDriver</b> is a <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music" title="Heavy metal music">heavy metal</a> <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_band" title="Cover band">cover band</a>. Their covers consist almost entirely of <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_music" title="Video game music">video game music</a>, especially from the <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis" title="Sega Genesis">Genesis</a> system (Mega Drive was the Genesis' name outside of North America). Because of this focus, the band's style has been termed "(Video) Game Metal". In fact, Megadriver's founder, Nino Megadriver, claims that Megadriver is the first "video game metal" band and that others started copying the style soon as it got attention by the media and on the emulation and gaming scene.</p>
<p>The band considers itself to be a "<a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit" title="Non-profit">non-profit</a> <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music" title="Independent music">independent</a> project" and does not charge for its music. Their stated goal is to "pay homage to classic <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game" title="Video game">video games</a>." To this end, they have made their entire <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repertoire" title="Repertoire">repertoire</a> available for free download at their website.</p>
<p>They have released four CDs titled "ACTION METAL", "Push Start Button (Round One)" (a demo CD) and, more recently, "Top Gear" and "Swords, Shurikins &amp; Fists", as well as several singles. In addition, the band has released four full soundtracks for the "Metal <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAME" title="MAME">MAME</a>" project, which reprograms MAME images using heavy metal remixes of the games' original music. They have even gone as far as to making their own music videos with their songs in the background, i.e., the video for Raging Storm is a tribute to Geese Howard, using various footage from Fatal Fury games, artwork of Geese, and also footage from the Fatal Fury anime.</p>

<p>MegaDriver has made several appearances in the media, in both news articles and on music and tech channels (including <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G4_%28TV_channel%29" title="G4 (TV channel)">G4</a> and <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV" title="MTV">MTV</a>). MegaDriver also appeared at the Arena Gamer Experience 2006, performing some of their remixes of well-known game tracks.</p>
<p>In late 2007, controversy arose in the last Video Games Live Brazil, where many fans expected to meet the band, but as far that is known, there hasn´t any contact from the <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGL" title="VGL">VGL</a> staff and the band members. Surprisingly, the unknown band '<a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=8_Bit_Instrumental&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="8 Bit Instrumental">8 Bit Instrumental</a>' (8bitvgm for short - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071227082943/http://www.8bitvgm.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.8bitvgm.net/" rel="nofollow">link</a>), from the Minas Gerais state, got invited to perform at the Brasília VGL presentation and gathered many fans. There still ongoing debate on why the band was not invited.</p>

<p>The band is made up of four members: guitarist, founder and frontman Nino MegaDriver (born Antonio Francisco Tornisiello); Ricardo, the second guitar; Daniel, the bassist of the band; and finally, Jeff, the drummer. There are were also a small number of other members, such as Nettão (also known as "The Butcher") who was once drummer, replaced by Jeff. This also applies to id9, who has left and been replaced by Daniel.</p>
<p>One point of interest is two of the lead guitarist Nino's instruments: a guitar made from an original Mega Drive, and a guitar made in the shape and image of <a href="/web/20071227082943/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28character%29" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (character)">Sonic the Hedgehog's</a> face. These console mods are unique and gave inspiration to several other console mods that are usually shown at Youtube as "new stuff" (a Sega Master System Guitar by instance).</p>
