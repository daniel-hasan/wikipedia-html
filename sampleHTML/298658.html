<p>The Queen and Edward, when Prince of Wales, occasionally intervened in his career—the Queen thought that there was &#34;a belief that the Admiralty are afraid of promoting Officers who are Princes on account of the radical attacks of low papers and scurrilous ones&#34;.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> However, Louis welcomed battle assignments that provided opportunities for him to acquire the skills of war and to demonstrate to his superiors that he was serious about his naval career. Posts on royal yachts and tours actually impeded his progress, as his promotions were perceived as royal favours rather than deserved.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> However, he rose through the command ranks on his own merit and eventually served as <a href="/wiki/First_Sea_Lord" id="w">First Sea Lord</a>, the senior uniformed officer in the Royal Navy, from 1912 to 1914 until he was forced to resign when anti-German feeling was running high at the start of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>.</p>
<p>He was the father of <a href="/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten%2C_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma" id="w">Earl Mountbatten of Burma</a> and <a href="/wiki/Louise_Mountbatten" id="w">Queen Louise of Sweden</a>, and was the maternal grandfather of <a href="/wiki/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh" id="w">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, consort of Queen <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Elizabeth II</a>. One of his younger brothers, <a href="/wiki/Alexander_of_Bulgaria" id="w">Prince Alexander of Battenberg</a>, was selected with the approval of Europe&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Power_(international)" id="w">Great Powers</a> to mount the throne of <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" id="w">Bulgaria</a>, where he reigned as <a href="/wiki/Prince" id="w">sovereign Prince</a> from 1879 to 1886. </p>

<p>Louis returned to Britain in May. In June he joined the <i>Royal Alfred</i>, the flagship of the <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a> and <a href="/wiki/West_Indies" id="w">West Indies</a> station, becoming a <a href="/wiki/Midshipman" id="w">midshipman</a> in October.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> From June to September 1870 he took leave in <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, coinciding with the <a href="/wiki/Franco-Prussian_war" id="w">Franco-Prussian war</a>,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> but he spent the next three-and-a-half years in the Americas, where his tour of duty served to make up for the training he had missed while posted with the Prince of Wales on the <i>Ariadne</i>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Returning to Europe in early 1874, he was posted to the shore establishment <a href="/wiki/HMS_Excellent" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Excellent&#39;&#39;</a>,<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> and passed the Sub-Lieutenant&#39;s examinations—gaining the best marks ever recorded at seamanship and joint best ever at gunnery.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1875, again at the invitation of the Prince of Wales, he joined the <i><a href="/wiki/HMS_Serapis_(1866)" id="w">Serapis</a></i>, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>, 1875–1876.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the <a href="/wiki/Illustrated_London_News" id="w">Illustrated London News</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at <a href="/wiki/Marlborough_House" id="w">Marlborough House</a> for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant onboard the <i><a href="/wiki/HMS_Sultan_(1870)" id="w">Sultan</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-p51_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p51" title="">[18]</a></sup> In addition to acting as the Duke&#39;s equerry, Louis continued his naval duties.

<p>On his penultimate day aboard the Queen&#39;s yacht, <a href="/wiki/30_August" id="w">30 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1885" id="w">1885</a>, he was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Commander" id="w">commander</a>.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> The next four years were spent in <i><a href="/wiki/HMS_Excellent" id="w">Excellent</a></i> and <i>Vernon</i> on half-pay, at HMS <i>Cambridge</i> very briefly at <a href="/wiki/Milford_Haven" id="w">Milford Haven</a> in August 1886, and onboard <a href="/wiki/HMS_Dreadnought_(1875)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Dreadnought&#39;&#39;</a> in the Mediterranean.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Irish_nationalist" id="w">Irish nationalist</a> <a href="/wiki/Member_of_Parliament" id="w">Member of Parliament</a> <a href="/wiki/William_Hoey_Kearney_Redmond" id="w">Willie Redmond</a> questioned the appointment to <i>Dreadnought</i> in the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons" id="w">British House of Commons</a>, suggesting it was due to royal favour—a suggestion denied by the <a href="/wiki/First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty" id="w">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lord_George_Hamilton" id="w">Lord George Hamilton</a>.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/3_October" id="w">3 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1889" id="w">1889</a> he was appointed to his first independent command, HMS <i>Scout</i>, a torpedo-cruiser, which saw service in the <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" id="w">Red Sea</a>.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/31_December" id="w">31 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1891" id="w">1891</a> Prince Louis rose to the rank of <a href="/wiki/Captain" id="w">captain</a><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> and became an aide-de-camp to the Queen, a post he would retain under both King Edward VII and <a href="/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">King George V</a>.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> At the beginning of the following year, he was appointed naval advisor to the inspector-general of fortifications. His role was to act as a liaison between the navy and the army in order to ensure a co-ordinated defence.<sup id="_ref-dnb_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[26]</a></sup> Traditionally, there was a great deal of friction between the two services, but Louis exercised his social skills in the role, leading <a href="/wiki/Prince_George%2C_Duke_of_Cambridge" id="w">Prince George, Duke of Cambridge</a> to write to him, &#34;You have produced a mutual feeling of goodwill and unanimity which I have always wished to see established, and which, by your tact and sound judgement, you have brought about to the fullest extent.&#34;<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1892, Battenberg invented the <a href="/wiki/Battenberg_Course_Indicator" id="w">Battenberg Course Indicator</a>,<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> a <a href="/wiki/Relative_velocity" id="w">relative velocity</a> <a href="/wiki/Analogue_computer" id="w">analogue computer</a> device used by seamen to determine course to steer and speed for changes of position between ships, originally produced in <a href="/wiki/Stainless_steel" id="w">stainless steel</a> by <a href="/wiki/Elliott_Brothers_(computer_company)" id="w">Elliott Brothers Ltd, London</a><sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> and which remains in use today albeit in more modern materials. </p>
<p>By February 1894 his role was further developed when he was appointed joint secretary of the naval and military committee on defence, which was later renamed the <a href="/wiki/Committee_of_Imperial_Defence" id="w">Committee of Imperial Defence</a>.<sup id="_ref-dnb_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[26]</a></sup> Louis captained the <i>Cambrian</i> in the Mediterranean Fleet from October 1894 to May 1897 and the <i><a href="/wiki/HMS_Majestic_(1895)" id="w">Majestic</a></i> in the Channel Fleet from June 1897.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> His careful study of both naval and military defence, as well as its interaction, led to his appointment as Assistant Director of the <a href="/wiki/Naval_Intelligence_Division" id="w">Naval Intelligence Division</a> in June 1899.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> He used his relationships with the royal houses of Europe to gather intelligence on the naval fleets of other nations, which he passed onto the Admiralty in full and detailed reports.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>After a year as captain of <a href="/wiki/HMS_Implacable_(1899)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Implacable&#39;&#39;</a> in the Mediterranean, during which he spectacularly defeated a larger opposing force during naval exercises,<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> Louis was appointed as <a href="/wiki/Naval_Intelligence_Division_(UK)" id="w">Director of Naval Intelligence</a> in November 1902.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> He was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Rear_Admiral" id="w">rear admiral</a> on <a href="/wiki/1_July" id="w">1 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1904" id="w">1904</a>, in which year his family connections to the royal courts of Europe helped resolve the <a href="/wiki/Dogger_Bank_incident" id="w">Dogger Bank incident</a> peacefully.<sup id="_ref-dnb_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[26]</a></sup> The following February, he was given command of the second cruiser squadron, with <a href="/wiki/HMS_Drake_(1901)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Drake&#39;&#39;</a> as his flag ship. During a successful two years the squadron visited <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a>, <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portugal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, where the American press commented favourably on Prince Louis&#39;s courtesy, unassuming manner and democratic nature.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> After two years at the head of the second cruiser squadron, and further visits to <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a> (where his niece <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Eugenie_of_Battenberg" id="w">Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg</a> was Queen), he was appointed second-in-command of the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Fleet_(United_Kingdom)" id="w">Mediterranean fleet</a> as acting vice-admiral with <a href="/wiki/HMS_Venerable" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Venerable&#39;&#39;</a> as his flagship.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>After less than six months in post his flag was transferred to <a href="/wiki/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_(1902)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Prince of Wales&#39;&#39;</a> in August 1907. The following year, he was promoted to Vice-Admiral, and appointed as Commander-in-Chief, <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Fleet_(United_Kingdom)" id="w">Atlantic Fleet</a>. In 1909, he published a translation of Commander Vladimir Semenoff&#39;s <i>Rasplata</i> (The Reckoning), a memoir of the <a href="/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War" id="w">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–5, and witnessed the first crossing of the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel" id="w">English Channel</a> by air by <a href="/wiki/Louis_Bl%C3%A9riot" id="w">Louis Blériot</a>.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> He was appointed as commander of the newly constituted Third and Fourth Divisions of the <a href="/wiki/Home_Fleet" id="w">Home Fleet</a> two years later. The years immediately preceding this appointment were marred by disagreements between Admirals <a href="/wiki/John_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher" id="w">Jacky Fisher</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lord_Charles_Beresford" id="w">Lord Charles Beresford</a> over the direction of the navy and the imposition of reforms. Louis largely supported Fisher&#39;s modernising efforts, although he disapproved of Fisher&#39;s methods, and as a result Fisher&#39;s opponents attempted to prevent Louis&#39;s promotions.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> Eventually, both Beresford and Fisher left active service but Fisher&#39;s reforms were retained. Fisher recommended Louis as <a href="/wiki/First_Sea_Lord" id="w">First Sea Lord</a>: &#34;He is the most capable administrator in the Admiralty&#39;s list by a long way&#34;<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> but elements of the British press were against his appointment on the grounds that he was a German saying it was &#34;a crime against our Empire to trust our secrets of National Defence to any alien-born official&#34;.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> In December 1911, Louis did return to the <a href="/wiki/Admiralty" id="w">Admiralty</a> but as <a href="/wiki/Second_Sea_Lord" id="w">Second</a> rather than First Sea Lord. As Second Sea Lord, Louis pushed through improvements in working conditions for the enlisted men, and created a Naval War Staff that would prepare the navy&#39;s plans in case of war.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, almost a year to the day later, on <a href="/wiki/8_December" id="w">8 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1912" id="w">1912</a>, Prince Louis assumed the post of First Sea Lord in succession to <a href="/wiki/Francis_Charles_Bridgeman_Bridgeman" id="w">Admiral Sir Francis Bridgeman</a>, who had retired in ill-health.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> In that capacity, he was responsible to the <a href="/wiki/First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty" id="w">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" id="w">Winston Churchill</a> for the readiness of the fleet and the preparation of naval strategy, as well as the development of a scheme for state insurance of merchant vessels in times of war, which was to prove essential in preventing prohibitive insurance rates that would have stifled British trade.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> On the eve of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> he unilaterally<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> made the crucial decision to cancel the scheduled dispersal of the British fleet following practice manoeuvres in order to preserve the Royal Navy&#39;s battle readiness.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dnb_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[26]</a></sup> Nonetheless with the outbreak of war, rising anti-German sentiment among the British public, newspapers, and elite <a href="/wiki/Gentlemen%26%2339%3Bs_club_(traditional)" id="w">gentlemen&#39;s clubs</a> (where resentment was inflamed by Admiral <a href="/wiki/Lord_Charles_Beresford" id="w">Lord Charles Beresford</a> despite Churchill&#39;s remonstrances)<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> drove Churchill to ask Prince Louis to resign as <a href="/wiki/First_Sea_Lord" id="w">First Sea Lord</a> on <a href="/wiki/27_October" id="w">27 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a>,<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> which Louis did amidst an outpouring of appreciation from politicians and his naval comrades. <a href="/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">The King</a> swore Louis in as a <a href="/wiki/Privy_Council" id="w">Privy Councillor</a> in a public show of support.<sup id="_ref-dnb_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[26]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" id="w">Labour</a> party politician and <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" id="w">trade union</a> leader, <a href="/wiki/James_Henry_Thomas" id="w">J.

<div class="thumbcaption">A 1917 <i><a href="/wiki/Punch_(magazine)" id="w">Punch</a></i> cartoon depicting King George V sweeping away the German titles held by members of his family.</div></p>
<p>Persistent rumours that the <a href="/wiki/British_Royal_Family" id="w">British Royal Family</a> must be pro-German, given their dynastic origins and many German relatives, prompted the King to abandon his subsidiary German dynastic titles and adopt an <a href="/wiki/House_of_Windsor" id="w">English surname</a>. At the behest of the King, Louis relinquished the title Prince of Battenberg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, and also the style of Serene Highness, on <a href="/wiki/14_July" id="w">14 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1917" id="w">1917</a>. At the same time, Louis anglicized his family name, changing it from &#34;<a href="/wiki/Battenberg_family" id="w">Battenberg</a>&#34; to &#34;<a href="/wiki/Mountbatten" id="w">Mountbatten</a>,&#34; having considered but rejected &#34;Battenhill&#34; as an alternative.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/17_July" id="w">17 July</a>, the King created him <i><a href="/wiki/Marquess_of_Milford_Haven" id="w">Marquess of Milford Haven</a>, Earl of Medina, and Viscount Alderney</i> in the <a href="/wiki/Peerage_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">peerage of the United Kingdom</a>.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> The King&#39;s British relatives in the <a href="/wiki/Teck" id="w">Teck</a>, <a href="/wiki/House_of_Oldenburg" id="w">Schleswig-Holstein</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gleichen" id="w">Gleichen</a> families underwent similar changes. Louis&#39;s wife ceased to use her own title of Princess of Hesse and became known as the Marchioness of Milford Haven. His three younger children ceased to use their princely titles and assumed courtesy titles as children of a British marquess; his eldest daughter, Princess Alice, had married into the Greek royal family in 1903, and never had occasion to use the surname Mountbatten. However, her only son, <a href="/wiki/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh" id="w">Prince Philip</a> of Greece and Denmark, adopted the name when he became a British subject in 1947.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the transition in names and titles was being effected, Louis spent some time at the home of his eldest son, George, who had married <a href="/wiki/Nadejda_Mountbatten%2C_Marchioness_of_Milford_Haven" id="w">Countess Nadejda (Nada) de Torby</a> the year before.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> After anglicizing his surname to <i>Mountbatten</i> and becoming Marquess of Milford Haven, Louis wrote in his son&#39;s guestbook, &#34;Arrived Prince Hyde, Departed Lord <a href="/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde" id="w">Jekyll</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the war, two of Louis&#39;s sisters-in-law (<a href="/wiki/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse)" id="w">Alexandra of Hesse</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Elizabeth_Fyodorovna" id="w">Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna</a>) were murdered by the <a href="/wiki/Bolshevik" id="w">Bolsheviks</a> in Russia. Eventually, in January 1921, after a long and convoluted journey, the body of Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna was interred in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" id="w">Jerusalem</a> in the presence of Louis and his wife.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Final_years_and_death" name="Final_years_and_death"></a><h1>Final years and death</h1>
<p>In 1919, the Mountbattens had to give up their home, Kent House, for financial reasons.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> He sold his collection of naval medals. All of his financial investments in <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" id="w">Russia</a> were seized by the Bolsheviks and his German property became valueless with the collapse of the <a href="/wiki/German_Papiermark" id="w">mark</a>.<sup id="_ref-end_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-end" title="">[81]</a></sup> He sold Heiligenberg Castle, which he had inherited from his father, in 1920.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup></p>
