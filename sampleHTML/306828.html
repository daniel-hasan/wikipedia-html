<b>Domnus II</b>, <a href="/wiki/Patriarch_of_Antioch" id="w">Patriarch of Antioch</a> of the heavily religious <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire" id="w">Eastern Roman Empire</a>, and a friend of the influential <a href="/wiki/Theodoret" id="w">Saint Theodoret Bishop of Cyrrhus</a>. He was nephew of <a href="/wiki/John_of_Antioch" id="w">John I</a>, Patriarch of Antioch, brought up under <a href="/wiki/Euthymius" id="w">Euthymius</a> the famous hermit of <a href="/wiki/Palestine" id="w">Palestine</a>. He was ordained deacon by <a href="/wiki/Juvenal_of_Jerusalem" id="w">Juvenal of Jerusalem</a> on his visit to the Laura of Euthymus in <a href="/wiki/429_AD" id="w">429 AD</a>. On the death of his uncle, in <a href="/wiki/441_AD" id="w">441 AD</a>, he was elected his successor, and almost at once ranked as the chief bishop of the Eastern world.</p> 
<p>In <a href="/wiki/445_AD" id="w">445 AD</a> he summoned a synod of Syrian bishops which confirmed the deposition of <a href="/wiki/Athanasius_of_Perrha" id="w">Athanasius of Perrha</a>. In <a href="/wiki/447_AD" id="w">447 AD</a> he consecrated <a href="/wiki/Irenaeus_of_Tyre" id="w">Irenaeus</a> to the see of <a href="/wiki/Tyre_(Lebanon)" id="w">Tyre</a> (Theodoret, <i>Epistle</i> 110); but emperor <a href="/wiki/Theodosius_II" id="w">Theodosius II</a>, commanded that the appointment should be annulled on the grounds that <a href="/wiki/Irenaeus" id="w">Irenaeus</a> was both a <i>digamus</i> and a supporter of <a href="/wiki/Nestorianism" id="w">Nestorianism</a>. He defended <a href="/wiki/Ibas" id="w">Ibas</a>, bishop of <a href="/wiki/Edessa%2C_Mesopotamia" id="w">Edessa</a>, against charges of promulgating Nestorian doctrines, and summoned a council at Antioch (<a href="/wiki/448" id="w">448</a>) which decided in favor of Ibas and deposed his accusers. Domnus&#39;s sentence, though revoked by <a href="/wiki/Flavian_of_Constantinople" id="w">Flavian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Patriarch_of_Constantinople" id="w">Patriarch of Constantinople</a>, was confirmed by three episcopal commissioners to whom he and the emperor <a href="/wiki/Theodosius" id="w">Theodosius</a> had committed the matter. </p>
<p>As a result, he was deposed at the schismatic <a href="/wiki/Second_Council_of_Ephesus" id="w">Second Council of Ephesus</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_8" id="w">August 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/449" id="w">449</a>. Cowed by the authoritarian spirit of <a href="/wiki/Dioscorus_of_Alexandria" id="w">Dioscorus</a>, and unnerved by the violence of Barsumas and his monks, Domnus revoked his former condemnation of <a href="/wiki/Eutyches" id="w">Eutyches</a>, and voted for the condemnation of <a href="/wiki/Flavian" id="w">Flavian</a>, but in vain. He was the only bishop then deposed and banished who was not reinstated after the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Chalcedon" id="w">Council of Chalcedon</a>&#8212;though this may have been by request so he could retire to his beloved monastery. </p>
<p>At that council <a href="/wiki/Maximus_II_of_Antioch" id="w">Maximus II</a>, his successor in the see of Antioch, obtained permission to assign Domnus a pension from the revenues of the church, and on his recall from exile Domnus returned to the monastic home of his youth, ending his days in the <a href="/wiki/Laura_of_St._Euthymius" id="w">Laura of St. Euthymius</a>, where in <a href="/wiki/452_AD" id="w">452 AD</a>, according to <a href="/wiki/Theophanes" id="w">Theophanes</a>, he afforded a refuge to <a href="/wiki/Juvenal_of_Jerusalem" id="w">Juvenal of Jerusalem</a> when he was driven from his see (Theophanes, p. 92).</p>
