<p>The <b>legal system of Singapore</b> is based on the <a href="/wiki/English_common_law" id="w">English common law</a> system. Major areas of law – particularly <a href="/wiki/Administrative_law" id="w">administrative law</a>, <a href="/wiki/Contract" id="w">contract law</a>, <a href="/wiki/Equity_(law)" id="w">equity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Trust_law#United Kingdom" id="w">trust law</a>, <a href="/wiki/Property_law" id="w">property law</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tort" id="w">tort law</a> – are largely <a href="/wiki/Law_of_Singapore#Judicial precedents" id="w">judge-made</a>, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes. However, other areas of law are almost completely <a href="/wiki/Law_of_Singapore#Legislation" id="w">statutory</a> in nature. These include <a href="/wiki/Criminal_law_of_Singapore" id="w">criminal law</a>, <a href="/wiki/Corporations_law" id="w">company law</a> and <a href="/wiki/Family_law_of_Singapore" id="w">family law</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from referring to relevant Singaporean cases, judges continue to refer to English <a href="/wiki/Case_law" id="w">case law</a> where the issues pertain to a traditional common-law area of law, or involve the interpretation of Singaporean statutes based on English enactments or English statutes applicable in Singapore. These days, there is also a greater tendency to consider decisions of important <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth</a> jurisdictions such as <a href="/wiki/Law_of_Australia" id="w">Australia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Law_of_Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, particularly if they take a different approach from <a href="/wiki/English_law" id="w">English law</a>.</p>
<p>Certain Singapore statutes are not based on English enactments but on legislation from other jurisdictions. In such situations, court decisions from those jurisdictions on the original legislation are often examined. Thus, <a href="/wiki/Indian_law" id="w">Indian law</a> is sometimes consulted in the interpretation of the Evidence Act<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and the <a href="/wiki/Penal_Code_(Singapore)" id="w">Penal Code</a><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> which were based on Indian statutes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, where the interpretation of the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Singapore" id="w">Constitution of Singapore</a> is concerned, courts remain reluctant to take into account foreign legal materials on the basis that a constitution should primarily be interpreted within its own four walls rather than in the light of analogies from other jurisdictions; and because economic, political, social and other conditions in foreign countries are perceived to be different.</p>
<p>Aspects of Singapore law are perceived to be harsh. Certain laws such as the <a href="/wiki/Internal_Security_Act_(Singapore)" id="w">Internal Security Act</a><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> (which authorizes detention without trial in certain circumstances) and the Societies Act<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> (which regulates the formation of associations) that were enacted during British rule in Singapore remain in the statute book, and both <a href="/wiki/Caning_in_Singapore" id="w">corporal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Singapore" id="w">capital punishment</a> are still in use.</p>

<p>Modern Singapore was founded on <a href="/wiki/6_February" id="w">6 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1819" id="w">1819</a> by Sir <a href="/wiki/Stamford_Raffles" id="w">Stamford Raffles</a>, an officer of the <a href="/wiki/British_East_India_Company" id="w">British East India Company</a> and Lieutenant-Governor of <a href="/wiki/Bengkulu" id="w">Bencoolen</a>, in an attempt to counter Dutch domination of trade in the East. Permission for the East India Company to set up a &#34;factory&#34; on the island was obtained from the <a href="/wiki/Sultan_of_Johor" id="w">Sultan of Johor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Temenggung" id="w">Temenggung</a> of Johor on that date, and outright <a href="/wiki/Cession" id="w">cession</a> of Singapore took place in 1824. It has been suggested that prior to British acquisition of the island, the <a href="/wiki/Malay_people" id="w">Malay</a> chief in charge of Singapore was the Temenggung of Johor. The <a href="/wiki/Johor_Sultanate" id="w">Johor Sultanate</a> was the successor of the <a href="/wiki/Malacca_Sultanate" id="w">Malacca Sultanate</a>, both of which had their own codes of law. It is also possible that <a href="/wiki/Adat" id="w">adat law</a>, often inadequately translated as &#34;customary law&#34;, governed the inhabitants of the island prior to its acquisition by the British. However, little, if anything, is known about the laws that were actually applicable. The British have always assumed that no law prevailed on the island of Singapore when it was acquired.</p>
<p>In 1823 Raffles promulgated &#34;Regulations&#34; for the administration of the island. Regulation III of <a href="/wiki/20_January" id="w">20 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1823" id="w">1823</a> established a <a href="/wiki/Magistrate" id="w">magistracy</a> which had jurisdiction over &#34;all descriptions of persons resorting under the British flag&#34;. The magistrates were enjoined to &#34;follow the course of the British magistracy, as far as local circumstances permit, avoiding technicalities and unnecessary forms as much as possible, and executing the duties of their office with temper and discretion, according to the best of their judgment and conscience and the principles of substantial justice&#34;. Raffles&#39; Regulations were most likely illegal as he was acting beyond the scope of his legal powers in making them – although he had power to place the factory at Singapore under the jurisdiction of Bencoolen, he was not vested with power to place the entire island under Bencoolen&#39;s control. In this respect, he had treated Singapore as if the entire island had been ceded to the British when the Treaty with the Sultan and the Temenggung had only permitted the establishment of a trading factory.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The same year, Raffles appointed <a href="/wiki/John_Crawfurd" id="w">John Crawfurd</a> as <a href="/wiki/Resident_(title)#Residents in (British) Asia" id="w">Resident</a> of Singapore. Crawfurd doubted the legitimacy of the judicial system set up by Raffles, and annulled proceedings in which magistrates had ordered the flogging of gamblers and the seizure of their properties. He eventually abolished the magistracy, replacing it with a <a href="/wiki/Court_of_Requests" id="w">Court of Requests</a> overseen by an Assistant Resident which dealt with minor civil cases, and a Resident&#39;s Court hearing all other cases which he himself presided over. Crawfurd had no authoritative guide to the applicable law, so he decided cases on &#34;general principles of English law&#34;, taking into account so far as he could the &#34;character and manners of the different classes&#34; of local inhabitants.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Unfortunately, Crawfurd&#39;s courts also lacked legal foundation, and he had no legal powers over Europeans in Singapore. Serious cases involving British subjects had to be referred to Calcutta; otherwise, all he could do was to banish them from the island.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the dubious legal status of the courts established in Singapore by Raffles and Crawfurd, they indicate that the <i>de facto</i> position was that between 1819 and 1826 English legal principles applied to Singapore.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/24_June" id="w">24 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1824" id="w">1824</a> Singapore and Malacca were formally transferred to the East India Company&#39;s administration by the Transfer of Singapore to East India Company, etc. Act 1824.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> By virtue of the Fort Marlborough in India Act 1802<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> both territories, together with others in the region ceded to Britain by <a href="/wiki/The_Netherlands" id="w">the Netherlands</a>, became subordinate to the <a href="/wiki/Bengal_Presidency" id="w">Presidency</a> of <a href="/wiki/Fort_William%2C_India" id="w">Fort William</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bengal" id="w">Bengal</a>, and under the Government of India Act 1800<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> these territories became subject to the <a href="/wiki/Jurisdiction" id="w">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_court" id="w">Supreme Court</a> of Fort William.</p>

<p>The statute 6 Geo.

<p>Granting the petition, the Crown issued the <a href="/wiki/Second_Charter_of_Justice" id="w">Second Charter of Justice</a> on <a href="/wiki/27_November" id="w">27 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1826" id="w">1826</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The Charter established the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales&#39; Island, Singapore and Malacca, which was conferred &#34;full Power and Authority… to give and pass Judgment and Sentence according to Justice and Right&#34;. This key clause was later judicially interpreted to have introduced English law into the Straits Settlements. The present understanding of this clause is that it made all English statutes and principles of English <a href="/wiki/Common_law" id="w">common law</a> and equity in force as at <a href="/wiki/27_November" id="w">27 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1826" id="w">1826</a> applicable in the Straits Settlements (including Singapore), unless they were both unsuitable to local conditions and could not be modified to avoid causing injustice or oppression.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Charter provided that the Court of Judicature was to be presided over by the <a href="/wiki/Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth" id="w">Governor</a> of the Straits Settlements and <a href="/wiki/Resident_Councillor" id="w">Resident Councillor</a> of the settlement where the court was to be held, and another judge called the <a href="/wiki/Recorder_(judge)" id="w">Recorder</a>. Problems occurred with the first Recorder, Sir <a href="/wiki/John_Thomas_Claridge" id="w">John Thomas Claridge</a>. He complained that the Governor and Resident Councillors had refused to take any judicial business, and so responded by also refusing to take on the full business of the Court. He also bemoaned the lack of a &#34;full, efficient and respectable court establishment of clerks, interpreters. etc.&#34; Although expected to travel from his base at Prince of Wales&#39; Island to Singapore and Malacca, due to disputes over travelling expenses and arrangements, Claridge refused to do so.

<p>The Charter conferred no legislative power on the Governor and Council of Prince of Wales&#39; Island or, indeed, on any other individual or institution.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The general power to make laws was vested with the Supreme Government of India and the British Parliament.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> By the East India Company Act 1813 (also known as the <a href="/wiki/British_East_India_Company#Charter Act 1813" id="w">Charter Act 1813</a>),<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Prince of Wales&#39; Island itself had been conferred an extremely limited power to issue regulations relating to duties and taxes it was empowered to levy; pursuant to this power, it issued nine regulations that applied to the Straits Settlements.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> However, on <a href="/wiki/20_June" id="w">20 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1830" id="w">1830</a> the East India Company reduced the status of Prince of Wales&#39; Island from a Presidency to a Residency.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> The island thus lost power to legislate for the Straits Settlements, which power was assumed by the <a href="/wiki/Governor_General_of_India" id="w">Governor General of Bengal</a>. He issued four such regulations applicable to the Straits Settlements.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Upon the downgrading of the Straits Settlements, the offices of Governor and Resident Councillors were abolished. This led Governor Fullerton to conclude that neither he nor the Resident Councillors were empowered any longer to administer justice under the Second Charter. In late 1830, Fullerton closed the courts and dismissed the judicial establishment before leaving for England. This led to legal chaos. Members of the mercantile community were in an uproar as they felt the ensuing confusion and inconvenience of having no local courts would disrupt commercial activity. In Singapore the Deputy Resident Murchison felt compelled to convene a court. However, the Acting <a href="/wiki/Registrar#Court" id="w">Registrar</a> James Loch<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> took the view that the court was illegal, and it was soon closed again. In September 1831 merchants of the Straits Settlements appealed to the British Parliament. By then, the East India Company had already decided that Fullerton had been mistaken. It decided to restore the titles of Governor and Resident Councillor so that these officers could continue to administer justice pursuant to the Charter. On <a href="/wiki/9_June" id="w">9 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1832" id="w">1832</a> the Court of Judicature reopened at Prince of Wales&#39; Island, and disposed of many outstanding cases that had amassed during the two years when the courts were closed.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1833, the Government of India Act 1833 (also known as the <a href="/wiki/British_East_India_Company#Charter Act 1833" id="w">Charter Act 1833</a>)<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> was passed by the British Parliament for the better government of the East India Company&#39;s possessions. Sole legislative power was transferred to the <a href="/wiki/Governor_General_of_India#Council" id="w">Governor General of India in Council</a>, thus inaugurating the period of Straits Settlements history known as the period of the &#34;Indian Acts&#34;.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Court of Judicature was reorganized by the <a href="/wiki/Third_Charter_of_Justice" id="w">Third Charter of Justice</a> of <a href="/wiki/12_August" id="w">12 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1855" id="w">1855</a>. The Straits Settlements now had two Recorders, one for Prince of Wales&#39; Island, the other for Singapore and Malacca.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1858 the East India Company was abolished, and territories formerly administered by the Company were transferred to the Crown acting through the recently-appointed <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_India" id="w">Secretary of State for India</a>. This was effected by the Government of India Act 1858.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> There was no change to the structure of the legal system – the Governor General of India continued to legislate for the Straits Settlements.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, many Acts passed by the Governor General during this period were not relevant to the Straits Settlements, and it was difficult to determine which were applicable. The situation was remedied by the passing of the Statute Law Revision Ordinance 1889 (No. 8 of 1889) (Ind.), which appointed commissioners to enquire into the matter and empowered them to publish a volume containing the text of any Indian Acts regarded as being in force. Any Acts not included ceased to be applicable forthwith.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>

<p>With effect from <a href="/wiki/1_April" id="w">1 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1867" id="w">1867</a>, the Straits Settlements were detached from India and constituted as a separate <a href="/wiki/British_overseas_territories" id="w">Crown colony</a> by way of the Straits Settlements Act 1866.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> A separate <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_the_Straits_Settlements" id="w">Legislative Council</a> with the authority to make laws was set up for the Straits Settlements. Pieces of legislation passed by the Legislative Council were known as &#34;ordinances&#34;.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the Supreme Court Ordinance 1868 (S.S.),<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> the Court of Judicature of the Straits Settlements was abolished, and in its place the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements was established. The Governor<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> and Resident Councillors<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> ceased to be judges of the Court.</p>
<p>In 1873, the Supreme Court was reconstituted to consist of the <a href="/wiki/Chief_Justice" id="w">Chief Justice</a> and the Judge at Penang as well as a Senior and a Junior <a href="/wiki/Puisne_Judge" id="w">Puisne Judge</a>. There were two divisions of the court, one at Singapore and Malacca and the other at Penang. As Singapore had become the Straits Settlements&#39; centre of government and trade, the Chief Justice and Senior Puisne Judge were required to reside in Singapore, while the Judge of Penang and the Junior Puisne Judge resided in Penang. The Supreme Court was also conferred with jurisdiction to sit as a <a href="/wiki/Court_of_Appeals" id="w">Court of Appeal</a> in <a href="/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)" id="w">civil matters</a>. Following changes in the court structure in England, in 1878 the jurisdiction and residence of judges was made more flexible, thus impliedly abolishing the geographical division of the Supreme Court.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> The first hierarchy of courts was also established, consisting of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements, Courts of Request, Courts of Two Magistrates, Magistrates&#39; Courts, Coroners&#39; Courts and Justices of the Peace. Appeals from decisions of the Supreme Court lay in the first instance to the Court of Appeal, and then to Her Majesty in Council, the latter appeals being heard by the <a href="/wiki/Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council" id="w">Judicial Committee of Her Britannic Majesty&#39;s Privy Council</a>.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also in 1878, a provision later known as section 5 of the Civil Law Act<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> was introduced into Straits Settlements law.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> The provision stated that if a question or issue arose locally with respect to certain named categories of law or with respect to <a href="/wiki/Law_merchant" id="w">mercantile law</a> generally, the law to be administered was to be the same as that administered in England at the corresponding period, unless other provision had been made by any law having force locally. It was felt the provision was needed because the Straits Settlements Supreme Court had a tendency to follow English case law premised on the existence of statutes that were not in force in the Colony. There was also a general sentiment that the common law should be common to the whole Empire.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> However, the manner in which section 5 was worded created much difficulty in determining whether particular English statutes applied locally.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Despite major amendments to the provision in 1979,<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> the problems with it were not resolved until it was finally repealed in 1993 (<a href="/wiki/Law_of_Singapore#1965 to the present: Singapore as a fully-independent nation" id="w">see below</a>).</p>

<p>During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, Singapore fell under Japanese Military Administration on <a href="/wiki/15_February" id="w">15 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>. There is much confusion as to where legislative authority lay, as there were several government or military bodies which had the power to make laws. These were, in order of descending authority, the Supreme Command of the Southern Army Headquarters, the 25th Army Headquarters, the Military Administration Department, the Malay (Malayan) Military Administration Headquarters, and the City Government of Tokubetu-si. Numerous regulations, laws and notices were issued by all these bodies through the Tokubetu-si without adhering to the normal chain of command. Although these laws were often contradictory, the body higher in the hierarchy always prevailed.</p>
<p>When the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore" id="w">Japanese occupation of Singapore</a> began, all existing courts ceased to function. By a decree of <a href="/wiki/7_April" id="w">7 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>, a Military Court of Justice of the Nippon Army was established, and the civil courts were reopened by a proclamation dated <a href="/wiki/27_May" id="w">27 May</a>. This Proclamation made all former British laws applicable so long as they did not interfere with the Military Administration. The highest court was the Syonan Koto-Hoin (Syonan Supreme Court) which was opened on <a href="/wiki/29_May" id="w">29 May</a>. Although a court of appeal was constituted, it never sat.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>There is some disagreement as to the status of judgments handed down by courts during the Japanese Occupation. The view has been taken by some post-Occupation courts that decisions by Japanese tribunals applying the law were valid. Others have held that since the Japanese administration did not set up tribunals in compliance with the requirements of Straits Settlements law, while the law continued to apply there were no proper courts in existence to enforce it.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Japanese surrendered on <a href="/wiki/12_September" id="w">12 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>. By Proclamation No. 1 (1945), the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Allied_Commander" id="w">Supreme Allied Commander</a> <a href="/wiki/South_East_Asia_Command" id="w">South East Asia</a> established the <a href="/wiki/British_Military_Administration" id="w">British Military Administration</a> which assumed full judicial, legislative, executive and administrative powers and responsibilities and conclusive jurisdiction over all persons and property throughout such areas of Malaya as were at any given time under the control of forces under his command.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> The Proclamation also declared that all laws and customs existing immediately prior to the Japanese Occupation would be respected, except that such of the existing law as the Chief Civil Affairs Officer considered practicable to administer during the period of military administration. Otherwise, all proclamations and legislative enactments of whatever kind issued by or under the authority of the Japanese Military Administration ceased to have effect.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>By Proclamation No. 23 (1945), the Deputy Chief Civil Affairs Officer for the Singapore Division provided that every conviction of any offence by a tribunal established by the Japanese Military Administration was quashed, and any judgment convicting or purporting to convict any person or any offence was set aside.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> Civil proceedings were dealt with by the Japanese Judgments and Civil Proceedings Ordinance 1946 (No. 3 of 1946), which had the effect of permitting post-Occupation courts to review the decrees of Japanese tribunals and to confirm, modify or reverse them.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>

<p>During this period, the basic structure of the courts remained much as it had been in the pre-war colonial era, with only minor changes being made such as the redesignation of the Police Courts as Magistrates&#39; Courts in 1955.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>

Article 75 of the Federal Constitution also stated: &#34;If any state law is inconsistent with a federal law, the federal law shall prevail and the state law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.&#34;</p>
<p>During this period, a substantial number of Malaysian laws, including <a href="/wiki/Federated_Malay_States" id="w">Federated Malay States</a> Enactments and <a href="/wiki/Malayan_Union" id="w">Malayan Union</a> and <a href="/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya" id="w">Federation of Malaya</a> Ordinances, were extended to Singapore.

<p>Merger with Malaysia did not last: within two years, on <a href="/wiki/9_August" id="w">9 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1965" id="w">1965</a>, Singapore left the Federation and became a fully-independent <a href="/wiki/Republic" id="w">republic</a>.

<p>At the time of independence, the Singapore Parliament did not make any changes to the judicial system. Thus, for an anomalous four-year period, the High Court in Singapore remained part of the Malaysian court structure. This was remedied in 1969. The Constitution was also amended to reconstitute the Privy Council as Singapore&#39;s court of final appeal,<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> and the highest appellate court within Singapore was organized into two divisions, the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal, which respectively dealt with civil and criminal matters.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1970 the subordinate courts were reorganized.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> Since that time,

<p>Steps to restrict appeals to the Privy Council were first taken in 1989. In that year, the law was changed<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> such that appeals to the Privy Council would only be permitted in a civil case if all the parties agreed to such an appeal prior to the hearing of the case by the Court of Appeal. In criminal cases, an appeal to the Privy Council could only be taken if the death penalty was involved and if the judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal were not unanimous in their decision. In 1993, the previous set-up of a separate Court of Appeal and Court of Criminal Appeal was done away with, and in their place a unified Court of Appeal was constituted for both civil and criminal appeals.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> Judges of Appeal appointed to the Court of Appeal were no longer required to engage in High Court work. The Chief Justice sat as the President of the Court of Appeal. The establishment of the permanent Court of Appeal paved the way for the abolition of all appeals to the Privy Council with effect from <a href="/wiki/8_April" id="w">8 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> Following this, the Court of Appeal issued a Practice Statement dated <a href="/wiki/11_July" id="w">11 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>, stating that while the Court would treat its own prior decisions and those of the Privy Council as normally binding, where it appeared that adherence to such decisions &#34;would cause injustice in a particular case or constrain the development of the law in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore&#34; it would regard itself as free to depart from such decisions. It added that this power would be exercised sparingly, bearing in mind the danger of retrospectively disturbing contractual, proprietary and other legal rights.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup> Today the <a href="/wiki/Judicial_system_of_Singapore" id="w">Singapore Court of Appeal</a> is the highest court in the land.</p>
<p>The independent status of Singapore&#39;s legal system was underlined by the repeal of section 5 of the Civil Law Act (<a href="/wiki/Law_of_Singapore#1867–1942: The Straits Settlements as a Crown colony" id="w">see above</a>) on <a href="/wiki/12_November" id="w">12 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1993" id="w">1993</a> by the Application of English Law Act 1993.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> The Act aims to clarify the extent of the application of English law in Singapore. It states that the common law of England (including the principles and rules of equity), so far as it was part of the law of Singapore immediately before the commencement of the Act, continues to be part of Singapore law so far as it is applicable to the circumstances of Singapore and its inhabitants and subject to such modifications as those circumstances may require.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup> As for English statutes, only those that are listed in the Schedules to the Act apply or continue to apply in Singapore; no other English enactment is part of Singapore law.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup></p>

Major portions of Singapore law, particularly <a href="/wiki/Contract" id="w">contract law</a>, equity and <a href="/wiki/Trust_law#United Kingdom" id="w">trust law</a>, <a href="/wiki/Property_law" id="w">property law</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tort" id="w">tort law</a>, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes. Since 1992, judgments of the High Court, Court of Appeal and Constitutional Tribunal of Singapore have appeared in the <i><a href="/wiki/Singapore_Law_Reports" id="w">Singapore Law Reports</a></i> (SLR), which is published by the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Academy_of_Law" id="w">Singapore Academy of Law</a> under an exclusive licence from the <a href="/wiki/Judicial_system_of_Singapore" id="w">Supreme Court of Singapore</a>. The Academy has also republished cases decided since Singapore&#39;s full independence in 1965 in special volumes of the SLR, and is currently working on a reissue of this body of case law. Cases published in the SLR as well as unreported judgments of the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts are available on-line from a fee-based service called <a class="externallink" href="http://www.lawnet.com.sg" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.lawnet.com.sg">LawNet</a>, which is also managed by the Academy.</p>
<a id="Custom" name="Custom"></a><h3>Custom</h3>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Custom_(law)" id="w">custom</a> is an established practice or course of behaviour that is regarded by the persons engaged in the practice as law. Customs do not have the force of law unless they are recognized in a case. &#34;Legal&#34; or &#34;trade&#34; customs are not given recognition as law unless they are certain and not unreasonable or illegal.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup> In Singapore, custom is a minor source of law as not many customs have been given judicial recognition.</p>

<p>The criminal law of Singapore is largely <a href="/wiki/#Legislation" id="w">statutory</a> in nature. The general principles of criminal law, as well as the elements and penalties of common criminal offences such as homicide, theft and cheating, are set out in the <a href="/wiki/Penal_Code_(Singapore)" id="w">Penal Code</a>.<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup> Other important offences are created by statutes such as the Arms Offences Act,<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup> Kidnapping Act,<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Misuse_of_Drugs_Act_(Singapore)" id="w">Misuse of Drugs Act</a><sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Vandalism_Act_(Singapore)" id="w">Vandalism Act</a>.<sup id="_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[96]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition, there is a perception that Singapore society is highly regulated through the criminalization of many activities which are considered as fairly harmless in other countries. These include failing to flush toilets after use,<sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[97]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Litter" id="w">littering</a>,<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Jaywalking" id="w">jaywalking</a>,<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup> the possession of <a href="/wiki/Pornography" id="w">pornography</a>,<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup> the sale of <a href="/wiki/Chewing_gum_ban_in_Singapore" id="w">chewing gum</a>,<sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup> and sexual activity such as <a href="/wiki/Oral_sex" id="w">oral</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anal_sex" id="w">anal sex</a> between men.<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup> Nonetheless, Singapore is one of the safest countries in the world, with a low incidence of violent crimes.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Singapore retains both <a href="/wiki/Corporal_punishment" id="w">corporal punishment</a> (in the form of <a href="/wiki/Caning_in_Singapore" id="w">caning</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment" id="w">capital punishment</a> (by <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Singapore" id="w">hanging</a>) as punishments for serious offences. For certain offences, the imposition of these penalties is mandatory.</p>
