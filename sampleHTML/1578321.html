<b><i>Internationalist</i></b> is the third <a href="/wiki/Studio_album" id="w">studio album</a> by <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australian</a> <a href="/wiki/Alternative_rock" id="w">alternative rock</a> <a href="/wiki/Rock_band" id="w">band</a>, <a href="/wiki/Powderfinger" id="w">Powderfinger</a>. The album was released on <a href="/wiki/7_September" id="w">7 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a> and was often labelled Powderfinger&#39;s most adventurous work, with greater <a href="/wiki/Experimentation" id="w">experimentation</a> than in previous works.</p>
<p><i>Internationalist</i> followed in the success of its predecessor, <i><a href="/wiki/Double_Allergic" id="w">Double Allergic</a></i>, and was certified <a href="/wiki/Music_recording_sales_certification" id="w">five times platinum</a> in Australia. <i>Internationalist</i> received four <a href="/wiki/ARIA_Music_Awards" id="w">ARIA Music Awards</a>, including &#34;Album of the Year&#34;. The album produced many singles for the band, including &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Day_You_Come" id="w">The Day You Come</a>&#34;, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Don%26%2339%3Bt_Wanna_Be_Left_Out" id="w">Don&#39;t Wanna Be Left Out</a>&#34;, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Good-Day_Ray" id="w">Good-Day Ray</a>&#34;, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Already_Gone_(Powderfinger_song)" id="w">Already Gone</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Passenger_(Powderfinger_song)" id="w">Passenger</a>&#34;, which all appeared on <a href="/wiki/Triple_J" id="w">Triple J</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Triple_J_Hottest_100" id="w">Hottest 100</a> poll in two consecutive years.</p>
<p><i>Internationalist</i> received fairly positive reviewers in the Australian press, and cemented Powderfinger&#39;s position on the local music scene; however, the album failed to launch the band in the overseas market.</p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h1> Background </h1>
<p>Powderfinger spent much of early 1997 <a href="/wiki/Concert" id="w">touring</a>, after the success of <i><a href="/wiki/Double_Allergic" id="w">Double Allergic</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/Songwriter" id="w">Songwriter</a> <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Fanning" id="w">Bernard Fanning</a> then spent much of 1997 writing songs for <i>Internationalist</i> in <a href="/wiki/Brisbane" id="w">Brisbane</a>, drawing on inspiration from a mid-1997 band trip to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The album&#39;s title refers to <a href="/wiki/Escapism" id="w">escapism</a> – namely, the ability that an &#34;<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Internationalist">internationalist</a>&#34; has to escape from <a href="/wiki/Racism" id="w">racial</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sociology" id="w">social</a> tension. When asked in a <i>Juice</i> interview, <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Fanning" id="w">Bernard Fanning</a> summarised the title of the album by stating;

<a id="Recording_and_production" name="Recording_and_production"></a><h1> Recording and production </h1>
<p><i>Internationalist</i> was recorded at <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" id="w">Melbourne</a>&#39;s Sing Sing Studios, with Powderfinger accompanied by <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Record_producer" id="w">producer</a> <a href="/wiki/Nick_DiDia" id="w">Nick DiDia</a> for the first time. As the band had already prepared &#34;about 30 or 40&#34; songs when they entered the studio, DiDia&#39;s task was relatively minor. <a href="/wiki/Bassist" id="w">Bassist</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Collins_(musician)" id="w">John Collins</a> said of DiDia; &#34;Nick was really good. The way Nick based the record was that he wanted to record the band how we were at that particular moment, he didn’t want to play around too much.&#34;<sup id="_ref-TakingFlight_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TakingFlight" title="">[2]</a></sup>  As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was <a href="/wiki/Audio_mixing" id="w">mixed</a> by DiDia soon after.<sup id="_ref-TakingFlight_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TakingFlight" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Collins described the album as not being as easy listening as their previous work,<sup id="_ref-TakingFlight_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TakingFlight" title="">[2]</a></sup> and that it contained numerous experiments in songwriting that they had not put into previous albums.<sup id="_ref-TakingFlight_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TakingFlight" title="">[2]</a></sup> Fanning later said <i>Internationalist</i> was &#34;a better record&#34; than <i><a href="/wiki/Double_Allergic" id="w">Double Allergic</a></i>, but acknowledged that it was not as easily likeable – it was just an improvement in songwriting.<sup id="_ref-Glory_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glory" title="">[3]</a></sup> Collins and Fanning acknowledged that the album&#39;s experimental nature could lose them some old fans, but the pair drew parallels with bands such as <a href="/wiki/U2" id="w">U2</a>, who Collins said had &#34;constantly re-invented themselves, and with success&#34;.<sup id="_ref-TakingFlight_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TakingFlight" title="">[2]</a></sup> He said Powderfinger&#39;s reinvention was as much for the band&#39;s own interest as it was for the &#34;public&#39;s perception&#34;.<sup id="_ref-TakingFlight_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TakingFlight" title="">[2]</a></sup> Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Guitarist" id="w">guitarist</a> <a href="/wiki/Ian_Haug" id="w">Ian Haug</a> described the album as a &#34;moderation&#34; between <i><a href="/wiki/Parables_for_Wooden_Ears" id="w">Parables for Wooden Ears</a></i> (&#34;the complicated beast&#34;) and <i>Double Allergic</i> (&#34;totally simplified&#34;), Powderfinger&#39;s two previous albums.<sup id="_ref-BeckoningFinger_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BeckoningFinger" title="">[4]</a></sup> He also agreed that the album was much more experimental, and described the album as the band&#39;s &#34;most successful&#34;, as well as stating that the album that best replicated &#34;the sound we have live&#34;.<sup id="_ref-AI_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AI" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Numerous songs on <i>Internationalist</i> were <a href="/wiki/Politics" id="w">politically</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sociology" id="w">socially</a> influenced, although the band denied it being a deliberate <a href="/wiki/Motif_(narrative)" id="w">motif</a>.<sup id="_ref-TPolitics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TPolitics" title="">[6]</a></sup> Fanning explaining that the band did not intentionally discuss political issues, saying &#34;we don&#39;t try to do anything in particular&#34;.<sup id="_ref-TPolitics_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TPolitics" title="">[6]</a></sup> He noted, however, that the songs, as his emotional responses to recent events, could inevitably be interpreted as being political.<sup id="_ref-TPolitics_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TPolitics" title="">[6]</a></sup> When &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Day_You_Come" id="w">The Day You Come</a>&#34; was released, there was speculation that it alluded to <a href="/wiki/Pauline_Hanson" id="w">Pauline Hanson</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/One_Nation_(Australia)" id="w">One Nation</a> <a href="/wiki/Political_party" id="w">political party</a>, although the band claimed the song was vague and didn&#39;t specifically refer to one person.

<p>Powderfinger went on a nationwide tour after the release of <i>Internationalist</i>, performing with <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> band <a href="/wiki/Swervedriver" id="w">Swervedriver</a> and fellow Brisbane band <a href="/wiki/Not_From_There" id="w">Not From There</a> in capital cities across Australia.<sup id="_ref-Fish_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fish" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Feted_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Feted" title="">[10]</a></sup> In 1999, the band toured with <a href="/wiki/Something_for_Kate" id="w">Something for Kate</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alex_Lloyd" id="w">Alex Lloyd</a>.<sup id="_ref-Glory_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glory" title="">[3]</a></sup> Collins described the process of choosing who the band would play with as a simple matter of choosing whose music the band preferred, stating &#34;we had played with most of the bands, and if you&#39;re going on tour with someone you may as well go with someone you get along with and whose music you enjoy.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Fish_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fish" title="">[17]</a></sup> Despite being fans of Swervedriver, who were renowned for &#34;their capability to reproduce their album sound perfectly in the live setting&#34; according to interviewer Neala Johnson,<sup id="_ref-TPolitics_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TPolitics" title="">[6]</a></sup> Fanning said Powderfinger would never attempt to replicate them, because he believed live shows to be much more &#34;emotionally powerful&#34; than recordings.<sup id="_ref-TPolitics_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TPolitics" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>With <i>Internationalist</i>, Powderfinger first set their sights overseas, appearing at numerous <a href="/wiki/Music_festival" id="w">music festivals</a> in the U.S., including <a href="/wiki/South_by_Southwest" id="w">South by Southwest</a> in <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>.<sup id="_ref-Dream_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dream" title="">[18]</a></sup> While in the U.S., Powderfinger played several showcase performances to record-label representatives in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" id="w">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>. In a later interview in Australia, Fanning said these shows were difficult due to the lack of any homegrown fan support.  He also said the band were not focused at the shows, and thus they did not go as well as planned.<sup id="_ref-Pulse_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pulse" title="">[19]</a></sup> Coghill, however, described the showcases as &#34;worthwhile&#34; and &#34;fun&#34;, as were the performances in <a href="/wiki/Austin%2C_Texas" id="w">Austin</a>.<sup id="_ref-P2K_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-P2K" title="">[13]</a></sup> After performing in the United States, Powderfinger completed a tour of <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>.

<p>Haug said he was amazed with the highly positive critical response the album had received, stating &#34;even Molly [<a href="/wiki/Molly_Meldrum" id="w">Meldrum</a>] gave it nine out of ten. Because every review has been so good it’s a bit dangerous to believe it, I think.

<p><i>Internationalist</i> was not praised as highly by <a href="/wiki/All_Music_Guide" id="w">All Music Guide</a> reviewer Jonathan Lewis as for Powderfinger&#39;s previous album, <i>Double Allergic</i>.

<p><i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" id="w">Rolling Stone</a></i> reviewer Tracey Grimson also praised the album, stating it had &#34;a heightened sense of subtlety, a pulled-back demeanour and choruses which weave themselves mildly out of the dark&#34;.<sup id="_ref-RollingStone_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RollingStone" title="">[26]</a></sup> Grimson&#39;s main praise was for the album&#39;s cohesion, declaring that it could be identified as a  &#34;solid album&#34; rather than a group of good songs &#34;thrown together&#34;.<sup id="_ref-RollingStone_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RollingStone" title="">[26]</a></sup> She also approved of the &#34;glorious backing vocals&#34; of <a href="/wiki/Tiddas" id="w">Tiddas</a>.<sup id="_ref-RollingStone_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RollingStone" title="">[26]</a></sup> Grimson&#39;s final comment was for Fanning&#39;s lyrical sentiments, stating that they were &#34;obviously strong, but conveyed simplistically, without convolution or being overbearing&#34;,<sup id="_ref-RollingStone_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RollingStone" title="">[26]</a></sup> and that they contributed to &#34;the gelling together of <i>Internationalist</i>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-RollingStone_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RollingStone" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
