<p><b>Gideon Algernon Mantell</b> (<a href="/wiki/February_3" id="w">February 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/1790" id="w">1790</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/November_10" id="w">November 10</a> <a href="/wiki/1852" id="w">1852</a>) was an <a href="/wiki/English_people" id="w">English</a> <a href="/wiki/Obstetrician" id="w">obstetrician</a>, <a href="/wiki/Geologist" id="w">geologist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paleontology" id="w">palaeontologist</a>. He is credited with discovering the first <a href="/wiki/Fossil" id="w">fossils</a> identified as originating from a <a href="/wiki/Dinosaur" id="w">dinosaur</a>, which were <a href="/wiki/Teeth" id="w">teeth</a> belonging to an <i><a href="/wiki/Iguanodon" id="w">Iguanodon</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Early_life_and_medical_career" name="Early_life_and_medical_career"></a><h2> Early life and medical career </h2>
<p>Mantell was born in <a href="/wiki/Lewes" id="w">Lewes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sussex" id="w">Sussex</a> as the fifth-born child of Thomas Mantell, a shoemaker,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and Sarah Austen.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> He was raised in a small cottage in St. Mary&#39;s Lane with his two sisters and four brothers. As a youth, he showed a particular interest in the field of geology. He explored pits and quarries in the surrounding areas, discovering <a href="/wiki/Ammonite" id="w">ammonites</a>, shells of <a href="/wiki/Sea_urchin" id="w">sea urchins</a>, fish bones, coral, and worn out remains of dead animals.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The Mantell children could not study at local grammar schools because the elder Mantell was a follower of the <a href="/wiki/Methodism" id="w">Methodist church</a> and the 12 free schools were reserved for only those who had been brought up in the <a href="/wiki/Anglicanism" id="w">Anglican</a> faith. As a result, Gideon was educated at a <a href="/wiki/Dame_school" id="w">dame school</a> in St. Mary&#39;s Lane, and learned basic reading and writing from an old woman. After the death of his teacher, Mantell was schooled by John Button, a philosophically radical <a href="/wiki/British_Whig_Party" id="w">Whig</a> who shared similar political beliefs with Mantell&#39;s father.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Mantell spent two years with Button, before being sent to his uncle, a Baptist minister, in <a href="/wiki/Swindon" id="w">Swindon</a>, for a period of private study. </p>
<p>Mantell returned to Lewes at age 15. With the help of a local Whig party leader, Mantell secured an <a href="/wiki/Apprenticeship" id="w">apprenticeship</a> with a local surgeon named James Moore.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> He served as an apprentice to Moore in Lewes for a period of five years, in which he took care of Mantell&#39;s dining, lodging and medical issues. Mantell&#39;s early apprenticeship duties included cleaning vials, as well as separating and arranging <a href="/wiki/Medication" id="w">drugs</a>. Soon, he learned how to make pills and other <a href="/wiki/Pharmaceutical_company" id="w">pharmaceutical products</a>. He delivered Moore&#39;s medicines, kept his accounts, wrote out bills and extracted teeth from his patients.<sup id="_ref-Deanp14_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Deanp14" title="">[6]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/July_11" id="w">July 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1807" id="w">1807</a>, Thomas Mantell died at the age of 57.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> He willed his son with some money for his future studies.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> As his time with the apprenticeship began to wind down, he began to anticipate his medical education. He began to teach himself <a href="/wiki/Human_anatomy" id="w">human anatomy</a>, and he ultimately detailed his newfound knowledge in a volume entitled <i>The Anatomy of the Bones, and the Circulation of Blood</i>, which contained dozens of detailed drawings of fetal and adult skeletal features.<sup id="_ref-Deanp14_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Deanp14" title="">[6]</a></sup> Soon, Mantell began his formal medical education in London. He received his diploma as a Member of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England" id="w">Royal College of Surgeons</a> in 1811.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Four days later, he received a certificate from the Lying-in Charity for Maried Women at Their Own Habitations that allowed him to act in <a href="/wiki/Midwifery" id="w">midwifery</a> duties. </p>
<p>He returned to Lewes, and immediately formed a partnership with his former master, James Moore. In the wake of the cholera, typhoid and smallpox epidemics, Mantell found himself quite busy attending to more than 50 patients a day and delivering between 200 and 300 babies a year.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> As he later recalled, he would have to stay up for &#34;six or seven nights in succession&#34; due to his overwhelming doctoral duties. He was also able to increase his practice&#39;s profits from ₤250 to ₤750 a year.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Although mainly occupied with running his busy country medical practice, he spent his little free time pursuing his passion, <a href="/wiki/Geology" id="w">geology</a>, often working into the early hours of the morning, identifying fossil specimens he found at the marl pits in <a href="/wiki/Hamsey" id="w">Hamsey</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>  In 1813, Mantell began to correspond with James Sowerby, a naturalist who cataloging fossil shells, and sent him many of the fossilized specimens he had found. In appreciation for the perfect specimens Mantell had provided, Sowerby named one of the species <i>Ammonites mantelli</i>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a>, he was elected as a fellow of the <a href="/wiki/Linnean_Society_of_London" id="w">Linnean Society of London</a>. Two years later, he published his first paper, on the characteristics of the fossils found in the Lewes area.<sup id="_ref-Deanp31_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Deanp31" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1816, he married Mary Ann Woodhouse, the 20-year-old daughter of one of his former patients who had died three years earlier. Since she was not 21 and still technically a minor under English law, she had to obtain permission from her mother and a special license to marry Mantell. After obtaining consent and the license, she married Mantell on <a href="/wiki/May_4" id="w">May 4</a> at St. Marylebone Church.<sup id="_ref-Deanp31_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Deanp31" title="">[14]</a></sup> That year, he purchased his own medical practice and took up an appointment at the Royal Artillery Hospital, at <a href="/wiki/Ringmer" id="w">Ringmer</a>, Lewes.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Gideon Mantell - Early portrait</div>
Inspired by <a href="/wiki/Mary_Anning" id="w">Mary Anning</a>&#39;s sensational discovery of a fossilised animal resembling a huge <a href="/wiki/Crocodile" id="w">crocodile</a> (later identified as an <a href="/wiki/Ichthyosaur" id="w">ichthyosaur</a>) at <a href="/wiki/Lyme_Regis" id="w">Lyme Regis</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dorset" id="w">Dorset</a>, Mantell became passionately interested in the study of the fossilised animals and plants found in his area. The fossils he had collected from the region, known as <a href="/wiki/The_Weald" id="w">The Weald</a> in Sussex, were from the <a href="/wiki/Southern_England_Chalk_Formation" id="w">chalk downlands</a> covering the county. The chalk is part of the Upper <a href="/wiki/Cretaceous" id="w">Cretaceous</a> <a href="/wiki/Period_(geology)" id="w">Period</a> and the fossils it contains are <a href="/wiki/Ocean" id="w">marine</a> in origin. But by 1819, Mantell had begun acquiring fossils from a quarry, at <a href="/wiki/Whiteman%26%2339%3Bs_Green" id="w">Whiteman&#39;s Green</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Cuckfield" id="w">Cuckfield</a>. These included the remains of <a href="/wiki/Terrestrial_ecoregion" id="w">terrestrial</a> and <a href="/wiki/Freshwater" id="w">freshwater</a> <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" id="w">ecosystems</a>, at a time when all the known fossil remains from Cretaceous England, hitherto, were marine in origin. He named the new strata the <i>Strata of <a href="/wiki/Tilgate" id="w">Tilgate</a> <a href="/wiki/Forest" id="w">Forest</a></i>, after an historical wooded area and it was later shown to belong to the Lower Cretaceous.</p>
<p>By 1820, he had started to find very large bones at Cuckfield, even larger than those discovered by <a href="/wiki/William_Buckland" id="w">William Buckland</a>, at <a href="/wiki/Stonesfield" id="w">Stonesfield</a> in <a href="/wiki/Oxfordshire" id="w">Oxfordshire</a>. Then, in 1822, shortly before finishing his first book (<i>The Fossils of South Downs</i>), he found several large teeth (although some <a href="/wiki/History" id="w">historians</a> contend that they were in fact discovered by his wife), the origin of which he could not identify. In 1821 Mantell planned his next book on the geology of Sussex. It was an immediate success with two hundred subscribers including a letter from king <a href="/wiki/George_IV" id="w">George IV</a> at Carlton house palace which read <i>&#34;His majesty is pleased to command that his name should be placed at the head of the subscription list for four copies.&#34;</i></p>  
<p>How the king heard of Mantell is unknown, but Mantell&#39;s response is. Galvanised and encouraged, Mantell showed the teeth to other scientists but they were dismissed as belonging to a <a href="/wiki/Fish" id="w">fish</a> or <a href="/wiki/Mammal" id="w">mammal</a> and from a more recent rock layer than the other Tilgate Forest fossils. The eminent <a href="/wiki/French_people" id="w">French</a> <a href="/wiki/Anatomist" id="w">anatomist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Georges_Cuvier" id="w">Georges Cuvier</a>, identified the teeth as those of a <a href="/wiki/Rhinoceros" id="w">rhinoceros</a>. </p>
<p>Although according to <a href="/wiki/Charles_Lyell" id="w">Charles Lyell</a>, Cuvier made this statement after a late party and apparently had some doubts when reconsidering the matter when he awoke, fresh in the morning. <i>&#34;The next morning he told me that he was confident that it was something quite different.&#34;</i> Strangely, this change of opinion did not make it back to Britain where Mantell was mocked for his error. Mantell was still convinced that the teeth had come from the <a href="/wiki/Mesozoic" id="w">Mesozoic</a> strata and finally recognized that they resembled those of the <a href="/wiki/Iguana" id="w">iguana</a>, but were twenty times larger. He surmised that the owner of the remains must have been at least 60&#160;<a href="/wiki/Foot_(unit_of_length)" id="w">feet</a> (18&#160;<a href="/wiki/Metre" id="w">metres</a>) in length.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Illustration of fossil <i>Iguanodon</i> teeth with a modern iguana jaw from Mantell&#39;s 1825 paper describing <i>Iguanodon</i>.</div>
He tried in vain to convince his peers that the fossils were from Mesozoic strata, by carefully studying rock layers. Sir <a href="/wiki/Richard_Owen" id="w">Richard Owen</a> famously disputed Mantell&#39;s assertion, by claiming that the teeth were of mammalian origins. </p>
<p>When it was proved Mantell was correct the only question was what to call his new reptile. His original name was <i>Iguanasaurus</i> but he then received a letter from <a href="/wiki/William_Daniel_Conybeare" id="w">William Daniel Conybeare</a>, <i>&#34;Your discovery of the analogy between the Iguana and the fossil teeth is very interesting but the name you propose will hardly do, because it is equally applicable to the recent iguana. Iguanoides or Iguanodon would be better.&#34;</i> Mantell took this advice to heart and called his creature <i>Iguanodon</i>.  </p>
<p>Years later, Mantell had acquired enough fossil evidence to show that the dinosaur&#39;s forelimbs were much shorter than its hind legs, therefore ruling out any mammal. Mantell went on to demonstrate that fossil <a href="/wiki/Vertebra" id="w">vertebrae</a>, which Owen had attributed to a variety of different species, all belonged to <i>Iguanodon</i>. He also named a new species of dinosaur called <i><a href="/wiki/Hylaeosaurus" id="w">Hylaeosaurus</a></i> and as a result became an authority on prehistoric reptiles.</p>
<a id="Later_years" name="Later_years"></a><h2> Later years </h2>
<p>In 1833, Mantell relocated to <a href="/wiki/Brighton" id="w">Brighton</a> but his medical practice suffered.  He was almost rendered destitute, but for the town&#39;s council who promptly transformed his house into a <a href="/wiki/Museum" id="w">museum</a>. The museum in Brighton ultimately failed as a result of Mantell&#39;s habit of waiving the entrance fee. Finally destitute, Mantell offered to sell the entire collection to the British Museum, in 1838, for <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" id="w">£5</a>,000, accepting the counter-offer of £4,000. He moved to <a href="/wiki/Clapham_Common" id="w">Clapham Common</a> in South London, where he continued his work as a doctor.</p>
<p>Mary Mantell left her husband in 1839. That same year, Gideon&#39;s son <a href="/wiki/Walter_Mantell" id="w">Walter</a> emigrated to <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a>. Walter later sent his father some important fossils from New Zealand. Gideon &#38; Mary&#39;s daughter Hannah died in 1840.</p>
<p>Mantell suffered a terrible carriage accident on Clapham Common, in 1841 and was left with a debilitating spinal injury. Despite being bent over with crippling deformity and in constant pain, he continued to work with fossilized reptiles and published a number of scientific books and papers, until his death.  He moved to <a href="/wiki/Pimlico" id="w">Pimlico</a> in 1844 and began to take <a href="/wiki/Opium" id="w">opium</a>, as a <a href="/wiki/Painkiller" id="w">painkiller</a>, in 1845.</p>
<a id="Death_and_legacy" name="Death_and_legacy"></a><h2> Death and legacy</h2>
<p>In 1852, Mantell took an <a href="/wiki/Overdose" id="w">overdose</a> of opium and later lapsed into a coma. He died that afternoon. His <a href="/wiki/Post-mortem" id="w">post-mortem</a> showed that he had been suffering from <a href="/wiki/Scoliosis" id="w">scoliosis</a>. Richard Owen, his long-time nemesis, had a section of Mantell&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Vertebral_column" id="w">spine</a> removed, pickled and stored on a shelf at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. It remained there until <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> when it was lost, presumably destroyed, during a <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> bombing raid.</p>
<p>Mantell&#39;s surgery, on the south side of Clapham Common, is now a dental surgery.</p>
<p>In 2000, in commemoration of Mantell&#39;s discovery and his contribution to the science of palaeontology, <i>The Mantell Monument</i> was unveiled at Whiteman&#39;s Green, Cuckfield. The monument has been confirmed as the location of the <i>Iguanodon</i> fossils that Mantell first described in 1822.
He is buried at <a href="/wiki/West_Norwood_Cemetery" id="w">West Norwood Cemetery</a> within a <a href="/wiki/Sarcophagus" id="w">sarcophagus</a> attributed to <a href="/wiki/Amon_Henry_Wilds" id="w">Amon Henry Wilds</a> that replicates the sanctuary of <a href="/wiki/Natakamani" id="w">Natakamani</a>&#39;s Temple of <a href="/wiki/Amun" id="w">Amun</a> (Coincidentally the name ammonite is derived from Amun).</p>
