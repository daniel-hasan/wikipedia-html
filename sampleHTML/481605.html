<p>After a series of <a href="/wiki/Batman_film_series#Failed projects" id="w">unsuccessful projects</a> to resurrect Batman on screen following the critical and commercial failure of <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_and_Robin_(film)" id="w">Batman and Robin</a></i> (1997), Nolan and Goyer began work on this film in 2003. Aiming for a dark and realistic tone, the filmmakers created a new interpretation of the <a href="/wiki/Batmobile" id="w">Batmobile</a>, here a military vehicle called the &#34;Tumbler&#34;. The film was primarily shot in <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a>, and relied on traditional stunts and <a href="/wiki/Miniatures" id="w">miniatures</a>; <a href="/wiki/Computer-generated" id="w">computer-generated</a> imagery was used minimally. <i>Batman Begins</i> was critically and commercially successful, and a sequel titled <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_(film)" id="w">The Dark Knight</a></i> was commissioned for a <a href="/wiki/2008_in_film" id="w">2008</a> release with both Nolan and Bale returning.</p>
<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h2>Plot</h2>
<p>Age eight, Bruce Wayne falls into a cave where he is attacked by a swarm of bats. Bruce develops a <a href="/wiki/Fear_of_bats" id="w">fear of bats</a>, and later urges his parents to leave an opera featuring bat-like creatures. Outside the theater, Bruce Wayne&#39;s parents are both killed in a robbery by mugger <a href="/wiki/Joe_Chill" id="w">Joe Chill</a>. Bruce blames himself for his parents&#39; murder: had he not been frightened, the Waynes would not have encountered Chill.</p>
<p>After coming of age, Bruce returns to <a href="/wiki/Gotham_City" id="w">Gotham City</a> from <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton University</a> intent on killing Chill, whose prison sentence is being <a href="/wiki/Suspended_sentence" id="w">suspended</a> in exchange for testifying against mob boss <a href="/wiki/Carmine_Falcone" id="w">Carmine Falcone</a>. One of Falcone&#39;s henchmen kills Chill. Bruce tells his childhood friend <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Dawes" id="w">Rachel Dawes</a> about his foiled plan, and she expresses disgust for his blind vengeance without regard for justice. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that he is ignorant of the nature of crime, so Bruce decides to travel the world for nearly seven years to understand the criminal mind. He is eventually detained in China for theft (ironically of <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Enterprises" id="w">Wayne Enterprises</a> cargo), where he meets <a href="/wiki/Henri_Ducard" id="w">Henri Ducard</a>. He invites Bruce to join an elite vigilante group, the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Assassins" id="w">League of Shadows</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Ra%26%2339%3Bs_al_Ghul" id="w">Ra&#39;s al Ghul</a>. Bruce is freed and travels to a mountaintop to begin his combat training with the League, who intend to use him to destroy Gotham. Bruce passes all the League&#39;s training, overcoming his childhood phobia in the process, but when ordered to execute a criminal, he turns on the League, destroying their headquarters and accidentally killing Ra&#39;s al Ghul. Bruce rescues an unconscious Ducard from the wreckage and leaves his mentor at a nearby village.

Bruce Wayne returns to a Gotham City that is mostly ruled by Falcone and begins plotting a one-man war against the corrupt system. He seeks the help of Rachel, now an assistant <a href="/wiki/District_attorney" id="w">district attorney</a>, and police sergeant <a href="/wiki/James_Gordon_(comics)" id="w">Jim Gordon</a>, who consoled him in the aftermath of his parents&#39; murder. After reestablishing his connections to his father&#39;s company, <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Enterprises" id="w">Wayne Enterprises</a>, Bruce is able to acquire, with the help of former board member <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Fox" id="w">Lucius Fox</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Batmobile#Batman Begins.2C 2005" id="w">prototype armored car</a> and an experimental <a href="/wiki/Batsuit#Batman Begins" id="w">armored suit</a>. In his new Batman costume, he disrupts a drug shipment by Falcone and leaves the mob boss tied to a searchlight, forming a makeshift <a href="/wiki/Bat-Signal" id="w">Bat-Signal</a>. He also disrupts an assassination attempt on Dawes, leaving her with evidence against a judge who has previously gone soft on Falcone. While investigating the &#34;unusual&#34; drugs in the shipment, Batman is stunned by sinister psychopharmacologist <a href="/wiki/Scarecrow_(comics)" id="w">Dr. Jonathan Crane</a>, who sprays him with a powerful hallucinogen. Bruce&#39;s butler <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" id="w">Alfred Pennyworth</a> rescues Bruce, who receives an anti-toxin developed by Fox. Crane later poisons Rachel after showing her that the toxin, which is harmful only in vapor form, is being piped into Gotham&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Water_supply_network" id="w">water supply</a>. Batman saves her. The police enter <a href="/wiki/Arkham_Asylum" id="w">Arkham Asylum</a> and arrest Crane while Batman escapes with Rachel.  After administering the antidote to Rachel in the <a href="/wiki/Batcave" id="w">batcave</a>, he gives her two vials of it for Gordon &#8211; one for the detective to inoculate himself, and another to mass produce for the city&#39;s population.</p>
<p>At a party held at <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Manor" id="w">Wayne Manor</a>, Bruce is confronted by a group of League of Shadows ninjas led by Ducard, who reveals himself to be the real Ra&#39;s al Ghul, the man killed earlier being a decoy. Ra&#39;s, who had been conspiring with Crane, plans to destroy Gotham by distributing the toxin undetected via Gotham&#39;s water supply and then vaporizing it with a microwave emitter stolen from Wayne Enterprises. Bruce, tricking his guests into leaving, fights briefly with Ra&#39;s while the League of Shadows set fire to Wayne Manor. Bruce escapes the inferno with Alfred&#39;s help just as the manor is destroyed. Batman arrives at the &#34;Narrows&#34; section of Gotham to aid the police in battling psychotic criminals, including Crane, who the League set free from the asylum. Rachel is confronted by but wards off Crane; Batman rescues Rachel when more criminals go after her. Batman intimates his identity to her while leaving Gordon in control of the Batmobile to stop the <a href="/wiki/Elevated_train" id="w">elevated train</a> that is being used to transport the vaporizer to the city&#39;s central water hub. Batman battles Ra&#39;s aboard the train, then escapes just as Gordon topples the elevated line using the Batmobile&#39;s missiles, leaving Ra&#39;s to crash to the ground with the train.</p>
<p>Following the battle, Batman becomes a public hero. Bruce gains control of Wayne Enterprises and installs Fox as CEO, firing Earle. However, he is unable to hold onto Rachel, who cannot reconcile her love for Bruce Wayne with his dual life as Batman. Gordon, newly promoted to lieutenant, unveils a <a href="/wiki/Bat-Signal" id="w">Bat-Signal</a> for Batman. Gordon mentions <a href="/wiki/Joker_(comics)" id="w">a criminal</a> who, like Batman, has &#34;a taste for the theatrical&#34;, leaving a <a href="/wiki/Joker_playing_card" id="w">Joker playing card</a> at his crime scenes.  Batman promises to investigate it. As Batman is leaving, Gordon mentions that he hasn&#39;t thanked Batman for what he has done. Batman replies that Gordon will never have to, and flies off into Gotham.</p>
<a id="Cast" name="Cast"></a><h2>Cast</h2>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Christian_Bale" id="w">Christian Bale</a></b> stars as <b><a href="/wiki/Batman" id="w">Bruce Wayne / Batman</a></b>, a billionaire industrialist whose parents were killed by a mugger when he was eight-years-old. Traveling the world for several years to seek the means to fight injustice, he returns to Gotham. At night, Wayne becomes Batman, Gotham City&#39;s secret vigilante protector. Bale was cast on <a href="/wiki/September_11" id="w">September 11</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>,<sup id="_ref-dynamic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dynamic" title="">[1]</a></sup> having expressed interest in playing Batman since <a href="/wiki/Darren_Aronofsky" id="w">Darren Aronofsky</a> was planning his own film adaptation.<sup id="_ref-originalpsycho_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-originalpsycho" title="">[2]</a></sup> Nolan was also considering <a href="/wiki/Billy_Crudup" id="w">Billy Crudup</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jake_Gyllenhaal" id="w">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Dancy" id="w">Hugh Dancy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joshua_Jackson" id="w">Joshua Jackson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eion_Bailey" id="w">Eion Bailey</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cillian_Murphy" id="w">Cillian Murphy</a> for the role.<sup id="_ref-dynamic_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dynamic" title="">[1]</a></sup> Bale felt the previous films underused Batman&#39;s character, overplaying the villains instead.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> To best pose as Batman, Bale studied graphic novels and illustrations of the superhero.<sup id="_ref-batsuit_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-batsuit" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Director Nolan said of Bale, &#34;He has exactly the balance of darkness and light that we were looking for.&#34;<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Goyer stated that while some actors could play a great Bruce Wayne or a great Batman, Bale could portray both radically different personalities.<sup id="_ref-journeybegins_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-journeybegins" title="">[6]</a></sup> Bale described the part as playing four characters: the raging Batman persona; the idiotic playboy façade Bruce uses to ward off suspicion; the vengeful young man; and the older, angrier Bruce who is discovering his purpose in life.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Bale&#39;s dislike of his costume, which heated up regularly, helped him get into a necessarily foul mood. He said, &#34;Batman&#39;s meant to be fierce, and you become a beast in that suit, as Batman should be – not a man in a suit, but a different creature.&#34;<sup id="_ref-batsuit_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-batsuit" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since he had lost a great deal of weight in preparation for his role in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Machinist" id="w">The Machinist</a></i>, Bale hired a personal trainer to help him gain one hundred pounds in the span of only a couple of months to help him physically prepare for the role. At first he went well over the weight required, creating concern over whether he&#39;d look right for the part. Bale recognized that his large physique was not appropriate for Batman, who relies on speed and strategy. He managed to lose the excess muscle by the time filming began.<sup id="_ref-journeybegins_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-journeybegins" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nolan wanted an all-star supporting cast, like <a href="/wiki/Richard_Donner" id="w">Richard Donner</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Superman_(1978_film)" id="w">Superman</a></i> film, which lend a more epic feel and credibility to the story.<sup id="_ref-journeybegins_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-journeybegins" title="">[6]</a></sup> These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Michael_Caine" id="w">Michael Caine</a></b> as <b><a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" id="w">Alfred Pennyworth</a></b>: The trusted butler to Bruce Wayne&#39;s parents, who continues his loyal service to their son after their deaths. He is Bruce Wayne&#39;s closest confidante. Nolan felt Caine would effectively portray the <a href="/wiki/Foster_father" id="w">foster father</a> element of the character.<sup id="_ref-journeybegins_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-journeybegins" title="">[6]</a></sup> Though Alfred&#39;s family is depicted in the film as having served the Wayne family for generations, Caine created his own backstory, in that before becoming Wayne&#39;s butler, Alfred served in the <a href="/wiki/Special_Air_Service" id="w">Special Air Service</a>. After being wounded, Thomas Wayne invited him because, &#34;He wanted a butler, but someone a bit tougher than that, you know?&#34;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> </li></ul>

Nolan considered <a href="/wiki/Viggo_Mortensen" id="w">Viggo Mortensen</a> for the role.<sup id="_ref-mortensen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mortensen" title="">[9]</a></sup> Writer David Goyer said he felt Ra&#39;s was the most complex Batman villain, comparing him to <a href="/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden" id="w">Osama bin Laden</a> as, &#34;He&#39;s not crazy in the way that all the other Batman villains are. He&#39;s not bent on revenge; he&#39;s actually trying to heal the world. He&#39;s just doing it by very draconian means.&#34;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Having played many mentor characters, the character of Ducard was considered by Goyer to be a twist on the Neeson archetype, being that he turns out to be a villain.<sup id="_ref-journeybegins_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-journeybegins" title="">[6]</a></sup></li></ul>

He takes on the persona of the Scarecrow to intimidate others. Nolan decided against Murphy for Batman, before casting him as Scarecrow.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Murphy read numerous comics featuring the Scarecrow, and discussed making the character look less theatrical with Nolan. Murphy explained, &#34;I wanted to avoid the <a href="/wiki/Worzel_Gummidge" id="w">Worzel Gummidge</a> look. Because he&#39;s not a very physically imposing man he&#39;s more interested in the manipulation of the mind and what that can do.&#34;<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></li></ul>

The director screened <i>Blade Runner</i> to cinematographer <a href="/wiki/Wally_Pfister" id="w">Wally Pfister</a> and two others to show the attitude and style that he wanted to draw from the film. Nolan described the film&#39;s world as &#34;an interesting lesson on the technique of exploring and describing a credible universe that doesn&#39;t appear to have any boundaries&#34;, a lesson that he applied to the production of <i>Batman Begins</i>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Director Christopher Nolan worked with production designer Nathan Crowley to create the look of <a href="/wiki/Gotham_City" id="w">Gotham City</a>. Nolan designed Gotham City to be a large, modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through.

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The Tumbler—the <a href="/wiki/Batmobile" id="w">Batmobile</a> used in <i>Batman Begins</i></div>
Nathan Crowley, one of the production designers for <i>Batman Begins</i>, started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by <a href="/wiki/Kitbashing" id="w">model bashing</a>. One of the parts that Crowley used to create the vehicle was the nose cone of a <a href="/wiki/P-38_Lightning" id="w">P-38 Lightning</a> model to serve as the chassis for the Tumbler&#39;s jet engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of <a href="/wiki/Styrofoam" id="w">Styrofoam</a>, which was a process that lasted two months.<sup id="_ref-batmobile_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-batmobile" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Styrofoam model was used to create a steel &#34;test frame&#34;, which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over 100 <a href="/wiki/Miles_per_hour" id="w">mph</a>, go from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds, possess a <a href="/wiki/Steering" id="w">steering</a> system to make sharp turns at city corners, and to withstand a self-propelled launch of up to 30 feet. On the very first jump test, the Tumbler&#39;s front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt. The basic configuration of the newly designed Tumbler included a 5.7-liter Chevy <a href="/wiki/V8_engine" id="w">V8 engine</a>, a truck axle for the rear axle, front racing tires by Hoosier, rear 4x4 mud tires by Interco., and the <a href="/wiki/Suspension_(vehicle)" id="w">suspension</a> system of Baja racing trucks. The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars.<sup id="_ref-batmobile_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-batmobile" title="">[31]</a></sup>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The rear of the Tumbler, showing the flaps and engine</div>
With the design process completed, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle possessing 65 <a href="/wiki/Carbon_fiber" id="w">carbon fiber</a> panels and costing $250,000 each to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six <a href="/wiki/Propane" id="w">propane</a> tanks.  Due to the poor visibility inside the vehicle by the driver, monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film&#39;s scenes.<sup id="_ref-batmobile_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-batmobile" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>The interior of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was over-sized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a <a href="/wiki/Radio-controlled_car" id="w">miniature model</a> that was 1:5 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual race car was used for the waterfall sequence.<sup id="_ref-batmobile_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-batmobile" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Batsuit" name="Batsuit"></a><h4>Batsuit</h4>
<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Batman_bale_small.jpg" title="The Batsuit of &#39;&#39;[[Batman Begins]]&#39;&#39;, worn by [[Christian Bale]]."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_bale_small.jpg" alt="The Batsuit of &#39;&#39;[[Batman Begins]]&#39;&#39;, worn by [[Christian Bale]]." title="The Batsuit of &#39;&#39;[[Batman Begins]]&#39;&#39;, worn by [[Christian Bale]]." class="location-right type-thumb" />

<div class="thumbcaption">The Batsuit of <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_Begins" id="w">Batman Begins</a></i>, worn by <a href="/wiki/Christian_Bale" id="w">Christian Bale</a>.</div>
The filmmakers intended to create a very mobile Batsuit that would allow the wearer to move easily in order to fight and crouch. Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restricted full head movement. Lindy Hemming, the costume designer for <i>Batman Begins</i>, and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed &#34;Cape Town&#34;, a secured compound located at <a href="/wiki/Shepperton_Studios" id="w">Shepperton Studios</a> in London. The Batsuit&#39;s basic design was a <a href="/wiki/Neoprene" id="w">neoprene</a> undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections. Batman actor <a href="/wiki/Christian_Bale" id="w">Christian Bale</a> was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast. To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface. In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black. The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam&#39;s durability.<sup id="_ref-batsuit_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-batsuit" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>For the cape, director Christopher Nolan wanted to have a &#34;flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels&#34;. Hemming&#39;s team created the cape out of their own version of <a href="/wiki/Parachute" id="w">parachute</a> <a href="/wiki/Nylon" id="w">nylon</a> that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)" id="w">British Ministry of Defense</a>. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection. The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard. The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show &#34;a man who has angst&#34;, so his character would be revealed through the mask.<sup id="_ref-batsuit_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-batsuit" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Special_effects" name="Special_effects"></a><h3>Special effects</h3>
<p>In making <i>Batman Begins</i>, Nolan preferred using traditional stuntwork to <a href="/wiki/Computer_generated_imagery" id="w">computer generated imagery</a>.<sup id="_ref-originalpsycho_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-originalpsycho" title="">[2]</a></sup> There were, however, several establishing shots that were CG composite images, that is, an image composed of multiple images. Some examples are Gotham&#39;s skyline, exterior shots of Wayne Tower, and some of the exterior monorail shots. The monorail sequence was actually a mix of live-action footage, model work, and CGI.

<a id="Film_score" name="Film_score"></a><h3>Film score</h3>
<p>{{seealso}}
The film score for <i>Batman Begins</i> was composed by <a href="/wiki/Hans_Zimmer" id="w">Hans Zimmer</a> and <a href="/wiki/James_Newton_Howard" id="w">James Newton Howard</a>. Director Christopher Nolan originally invited Zimmer to compose the film score, and Zimmer asked the director if he could invite Howard to compose as well, as they had always planned a collaboration.<sup id="_ref-knightmusic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knightmusic" title="">[32]</a></sup> The two composers collaborated on separate themes for the &#34;split personality&#34; of Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Batman. Zimmer and Howard began composing in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles%2C_California" id="w">Los Angeles</a> and moved to <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> where they stayed for 12 weeks to complete most of their writing.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Zimmer and Howard sought inspiration for shaping the score by making set visits to <i>Batman Begins</i>.<sup id="_ref-zimmer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-zimmer" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Zimmer wanted to avoid composing a film score that had been done before, so the score became an amalgamation of <a href="/wiki/Orchestra" id="w">orchestra</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electronic_music" id="w">electronic music</a>. The film&#39;s ninety-piece orchestra<sup id="_ref-knightmusic_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knightmusic" title="">[32]</a></sup> was developed from members of various London orchestras, and Zimmer chose to use more than the normal amount of <a href="/wiki/Cello" id="w">cellos</a>. Zimmer enlisted a <a href="/wiki/Choir" id="w">choir</a> boy to help reflect the music in the film&#39;s scene where Bruce Wayne&#39;s parents are killed. &#34;He&#39;s singing a fairly pretty tune and then he gets stuck, it&#39;s like froze, arrested development&#34;, Zimmer said. Zimmer also attempted to add human dimension to Batman, whose behavior would typically be seen as &#34;psychotic&#34;, through the music. Both composers collaborated to create 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of music for the film.<sup id="_ref-zimmer_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-zimmer" title="">[34]</a></sup> Zimmer composed the action sequences, while Howard focused on the film&#39;s drama.<sup id="_ref-knightmusic_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knightmusic" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>

<p>Comic book writer and author Danny Fingeroth argued a strong theme in the film was Bruce&#39;s search for a father figure; &#34;[Alfred] is the good father that Bruce comes to depend on. Bruce’s real father died before they could establish an adult relationship, and Liam Neeson’s Ducard is stern and demanding, didactic and challenging, but not a father figure with any sympathy. If Bruce Wayne is anyone’s son, it is Alfred’s. [Morgan] Freeman’s Lucius is cool and imperturbable, another steady anchor in Bruce’s life.&#34;<sup id="_ref-fingerothvfx_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fingerothvfx" title="">[66]</a></sup> English professor Mark Fisher of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Florida" id="w">University of Florida</a> stated Bruce&#39;s search for justice requires him to learn from a proper father figure, with Thomas Wayne and Ra&#39;s al Ghul being the two counterpoints. Alfred provides a maternal figure of unconditional love, despite the overall lack of focus on a mother figure in Bruce&#39;s life.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fingeroth also argued a major theme in the film is <a href="/wiki/Fear" id="w">fear</a>, which supports the story of Bruce Wayne becoming a hero. Director <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Nolan" id="w">Christopher Nolan</a> stated that the idea behind the film was &#34;a person who would confront his innermost fear and then attempt to become it.&#34; Fingeroth referred to this film&#39;s depiction as &#34;the man with fear — but who rises above it.&#34; The theme of fear is further personified by the choice of antagonist &#8212; the Scarecrow.<sup id="_ref-fingerothvfx_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fingerothvfx" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
