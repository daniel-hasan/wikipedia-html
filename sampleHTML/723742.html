The <b>2004 Atlantic hurricane season</b> officially began on <a href="/wiki/June_1" id="w">June 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, and lasted until <a href="/wiki/November_30" id="w">November 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical cyclones</a> form in the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_basin" id="w">Atlantic basin</a>. However, the 2004 season exceeded these conventional limits slightly, as Tropical Storm Otto formed on the last day of the season and lasted two days into December.  The season was well above average in activity, with fifteen named storms and one of the highest <a href="/wiki/Accumulated_Cyclone_Energy" id="w">Accumulated Cyclone Energy</a> totals ever observed.</p>
<p>The season was notable as one of the deadliest and most costly Atlantic hurricane seasons on record, with at least 3,132 deaths and roughly $42 billion (2004 <a href="/wiki/US_dollars" id="w">US dollars</a>) in damage. The most notable storms for the season were the four hurricanes that made landfall in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">U.S. state</a> of <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, three of them with at least 115 mph (185&#160;km/h) sustained winds: <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Charley" id="w">Charley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Frances" id="w">Frances</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Ivan" id="w">Ivan</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Jeanne" id="w">Jeanne</a>. Jeanne wreaked havoc in <a href="/wiki/Haiti" id="w">Haiti</a>, killing approximately 3,000 people, while Ivan raged through <a href="/wiki/Grenada" id="w">Grenada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" id="w">Jamaica</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Cayman_Islands" id="w">Cayman Islands</a>; Frances and Jeanne both hit the <a href="/wiki/Bahamas" id="w">Bahamas</a> at full force, while Charley caused significant damage in <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>. Furthermore, all four of these hurricanes, as well as one tropical storm, hit the <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">U.S. state</a> of <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, with Frances and Jeanne hitting nearly the exact same location within three weeks of each other; floodwaters in the <a href="/wiki/Southeastern_United_States" id="w">southeastern United States</a> were brought to near-record levels.</p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_17" id="w">May 17</a>, prior to the start of the season, <a href="/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration" id="w">NOAA</a> forecasters predicted a 50% probability of activity above the normal range, with 12&#8211;15 tropical storms, 6&#8211;8 of those becoming hurricanes, and 2&#8211;4 of those hurricanes reaching at least Category 3 strength on the <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale</a>.<sup id="_ref-NOAA May_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NOAA May" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Noted hurricane expert Dr. <a href="/wiki/William_Gray" id="w">William Gray</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/May_28" id="w">May 28</a> prediction was similar, with 14 named storms, 8 reaching hurricane strength, and 3 reaching Category 3 strength.<sup id="_ref-Gray May_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gray May" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Mid-season_outlook" name="Mid-season_outlook"></a><h3>Mid-season outlook</h3>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_6" id="w">August 6</a>, Dr. Gray announced he had revised his predictions slightly downwards, citing mild <a href="/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o" id="w">El Niño</a> conditions, to 13 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 reaching category 3.<sup id="_ref-Gray Aug_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gray Aug" title="">[4]</a></sup> Several days later, NOAA released an updated prediction as well, with a 90% probability of above-to-near normal activity, but the same number of storms forecast.<sup id="_ref-NOAA Aug_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NOAA Aug" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Records_and_notable_events" name="Records_and_notable_events"></a><h2>Records and notable events</h2>
<p>The 2004 season had numerous unusual occurrences. The first named storm of the season formed on <a href="/wiki/August_1" id="w">August 1</a>, giving the season the fifth-latest start since the <a href="/wiki/1952_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1952 season</a>. <a href="/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Bonnie_(2004)" id="w">Tropical Storm Bonnie</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Charley" id="w">Hurricane Charley</a> became the first storms to sequentially hit the same <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">U.S. state</a> — <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> — within 24 hours of each other in recorded history. For the remainder of the season, Florida was hit by three more hurricanes: <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Frances" id="w">Frances</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Ivan" id="w">Ivan</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Jeanne" id="w">Jeanne</a>. It was the first time four hurricanes have hit one state in one season since four hurricanes hit the <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a> coast in the <a href="/wiki/1886_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1886 season</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/Indianola_Hurricane_of_1886" id="w">Indianola Hurricane of 1886</a> that destroyed the city of <a href="/wiki/Indianola%2C_Texas" id="w">Indianola</a>.
{{Most intense hurricanes}}
Other storms were individually unusual. <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Alex_(2004)" id="w">Hurricane Alex</a> was the strongest hurricane on record to intensify north of 38°N latitude. One storm, Tropical Storm Earl, died out, and its remains crossed over into the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a>, regenerated, and became Hurricane Frank in the eastern Pacific.</p>
<p>The most unusual storm of the season was <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Ivan" id="w">Hurricane Ivan</a>. Ivan first impressed meteorologists by becoming the first major <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane" id="w">Atlantic hurricane</a> (Category 3 or above) on record to form as low as 10ºN latitude. Ivan was also recorded as the sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record up to that point (since pushed down to tenth), with a minimum central pressure of 910 <a href="/wiki/Mbar" id="w">mbar</a> (<a href="/wiki/HPa" id="w">hPa</a>).  One very unusual occurrence in relation to Ivan happened on <a href="/wiki/September_22" id="w">September 22</a>, when a remnant <a href="/wiki/Low_pressure_area" id="w">low</a> from Ivan — which had traveled in a circular motion over the southeastern United States — was reclassified as a tropical depression as it moved over the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a>. The system was given the name Ivan and eventually strengthened into a respectable <a href="/wiki/Tropical_storm" id="w">tropical storm</a> with winds of 65 mph (100&#160;km/h) before making landfall along the coast of <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>, causing minimal flooding and damage.</p>
<p>Although not part of the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane" id="w">Atlantic hurricane</a> season, one event in the <a href="/wiki/South_Atlantic" id="w">South Atlantic</a> was so unusual as to merit mention. On <a href="/wiki/March_25" id="w">March 25</a>, a tropical cyclone (unofficially named <a href="/wiki/Cyclone_Catarina" id="w">Cyclone Catarina</a>) formed in the <a href="/wiki/South_Atlantic" id="w">South Atlantic</a>. Catarina is considered to be the first tropical cyclone of hurricane strength to have formed in the South Atlantic since satellite observations began. It made landfall late on <a href="/wiki/March_27" id="w">March 27</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Brazil" id="w">Brazilian</a> state of <a href="/wiki/Santa_Catarina_(state)" id="w">Santa Catarina</a>. The storm killed at least three and caused over $350 million (2004 <a href="/wiki/USD" id="w">USD</a>) in damage.</p>

<p>{{hurricane main}}
{{infobox hurricane small}}
The first storm of the season formed at the end of July off the coast of <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina" id="w">South Carolina</a>. Alex strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane, and on <a href="/wiki/August_3" id="w">August 3</a> came within 10 miles (16&#160;km) of the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Banks" id="w">Outer Banks</a> of <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> without making landfall. Damage was limited to flooding and wind damage, and in <a href="/wiki/Dare_County%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Dare County, North Carolina</a>, was estimated at $2.4 million. There were several injuries and one death reported.<sup id="_ref-AlexTCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AlexTCR" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Alex later headed out to sea and strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane, making it only the second hurricane on record to have reached Category 3 strength north of 38° N latitude, before becoming extratropical over the north Atlantic. </p>

<a id="Tropical_Storm_Bonnie" name="Tropical_Storm_Bonnie"></a><h3>Tropical Storm Bonnie</h3>
<p>{{hurricane main}}
{{infobox hurricane small}}
On <a href="/wiki/August_3" id="w">August 3</a>, a tropical wave approaching the <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Antilles" id="w">Lesser Antilles</a> organized into Tropical Depression Two. As the storm traveled west over the islands, it dissipated on <a href="/wiki/August_4" id="w">August 4</a>. The remnants of Tropical Depression Two continued westward and, on <a href="/wiki/August_9" id="w">August 9</a>, had strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonnie in the <a href="/wiki/Yucatan_Channel" id="w">Yucatan Channel</a>. Although appearing disorganized, Bonnie showed unusual structure, with a closed eye wall and a ten-mile (16&#160;km) wide eye being reported by <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_hunters" id="w">hurricane hunters</a> late on August 9 and early on <a href="/wiki/August_10" id="w">August 10</a>, a feature almost unheard of in tropical cyclones of that intensity. Bonnie was a very small storm, with tropical storm-force winds extending only 30 miles (50&#160;km) out from the center. Upper level shear weakened the storm, and Bonnie made landfall as a 45 mph tropical storm just south of <a href="/wiki/Apalachicola%2C_Florida" id="w">Apalachicola, Florida</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_12" id="w">August 12</a>. It accelerated northeastward, and became a remnant area of low pressure on <a href="/wiki/August_14" id="w">August 14</a> to the southeast of <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a>.<sup id="_ref-BonnieTCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BonnieTCR" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bonnie caused minor to moderate damage across its path. In the southeast <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, the storm caused a tornado outbreak that caused $500,000 (2004 USD) in damage and 3 deaths. In <a href="/wiki/New_Brunswick" id="w">New Brunswick</a>, slick rains from the remnants of Bonnie caused an indirect fatality. </p>

<a id="Hurricane_Charley" name="Hurricane_Charley"></a><h3>Hurricane Charley</h3>
<p>{{hurricane main}}
{{infobox hurricane small}}
Hurricane Charley formed east of the <a href="/wiki/Windward_Islands" id="w">Windward Islands</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_9" id="w">August 9</a> and moved rapidly west across the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean</a>. As it neared Jamaica, it became a hurricane and grazed that island on <a href="/wiki/August_11" id="w">August 11</a>, passing through the <a href="/wiki/Cayman_Islands" id="w">Cayman Islands</a> the next morning. On <a href="/wiki/August_12" id="w">August 12</a>, Charley passed over mainland <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a> as a Category 3 hurricane just west of <a href="/wiki/Havana" id="w">Havana</a>.<sup id="_ref-CharleyTCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CharleyTCR" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_13" id="w">August 13</a>, Charley unexpectedly underwent rapid strengthening, jumping from a Category 2 to a powerful Category 4 storm in a few hours, while at the same time taking a sharp turn to the northeast. Charley made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane near <a href="/wiki/Port_Charlotte%2C_Florida" id="w">Port Charlotte, Florida</a>. Although the storm caused serious damage, much of this was limited to a narrow swath associated with the hurricane&#39;s eye wall. Charley was a very fast-moving, compact storm, and so much of its damage was attributed to high winds rather than heavy rain, as is the case in most hurricanes. Charley remained a hurricane across the entire Florida peninsula and passed near <a href="/wiki/Orlando%2C_Florida" id="w">Orlando</a> and <a href="/wiki/Daytona_Beach" id="w">Daytona Beach</a>. It later made a second landfall near <a href="/wiki/North_Myrtle_Beach%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina</a>, on <a href="/wiki/August_14" id="w">August 14</a>. Charley dissipated near <a href="/wiki/Cape_Cod" id="w">Cape Cod</a>, <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Massachusetts</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_15" id="w">August 15</a>. </p>
<p>Charley caused approximately $14 billion in damage to the United States, making it the fourth costliest hurricane in U.S. history. Fifteen deaths were directly attributed to Charley; four in <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" id="w">Jamaica</a>, one in <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>, and ten in <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>.</p>

<p>{{hurricane main}}
{{infobox hurricane small}}
At 11 a.m. AST on <a href="/wiki/August_13" id="w">August 13</a>, a tropical wave formed into Tropical Depression Four around 275 miles (440&#160;km) southeast of <a href="/wiki/Cape_Verde" id="w">Cape Verde</a>. It was the first of five <a href="/wiki/Cape_Verde-type_hurricane" id="w">Cape Verde-type hurricanes</a> of 2004. Twelve hours later, TD4 strengthened and was named Tropical Storm Danielle. Late on <a href="/wiki/August_14" id="w">August 14</a>, Danielle&#39;s wind speeds increased, and it was classified as a hurricane. Danielle moved northwest, peaking at Category Two. It was predicted to curve towards the <a href="/wiki/Azores" id="w">Azores</a>, but on <a href="/wiki/August_18" id="w">August 18</a> lost motion and slackened to a tropical storm.

<a id="Tropical_Storm_Earl" name="Tropical_Storm_Earl"></a><h3>Tropical Storm Earl</h3>
<p>{{hurricane main}}
{{infobox hurricane small}}
Earl formed initially as the fifth tropical depression of the season on <a href="/wiki/August_13" id="w">August 13</a> east of the <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Antilles" id="w">Lesser Antilles</a>. After traveling west, it reached tropical storm strength on <a href="/wiki/August_14" id="w">August 14</a> around 375 miles (605&#160;km) southeast of <a href="/wiki/Barbados" id="w">Barbados</a>. On <a href="/wiki/August_15" id="w">August 15</a>, Earl passed just south of <a href="/wiki/Grenada" id="w">Grenada</a> and entered the Caribbean. The storm had degenerated by that point, and that night would have been classified as a tropical wave. However, the government of <a href="/wiki/Venezuela" id="w">Venezuela</a> denied access to their airspace for storm <a href="/wiki/Reconnaissance" id="w">reconnaissance</a> aircraft. An on-site assessment of Earl&#39;s circulation was needed, since satellite observations are inaccurate for that purpose. Earl also posed a threat to land, so advisories continued for another 12 hours.<sup id="_ref-EarlTCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EarlTCR" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The next morning a reconnaissance aircraft was able to reach the storm. It found no closed circulation, and Earl was reclassified as a tropical wave at 11 a.m. AST on <a href="/wiki/August_16" id="w">August 16</a>. Remnants of the storm continued across the Caribbean and into <a href="/wiki/Central_America" id="w">Central America</a>, later becoming Tropical Depression 8E and then Hurricane Frank in the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a> (the first time since 1996, when Hurricane Cesar became Douglas in the Pacific). Earl caused minor damage to <a href="/wiki/Grenada" id="w">Grenada</a> and <a href="/wiki/St._Vincent_and_the_Grenadines" id="w">St. Vincent and the Grenadines</a>.</p>

<a id="Hurricane_Frances" name="Hurricane_Frances"></a><h3>Hurricane Frances</h3>
<p>{{hurricane main}}
{{infobox hurricane small}}
Frances began as Tropical Depression Six on <a href="/wiki/August_24" id="w">August 24</a>, and it became a named storm on <a href="/wiki/August_25" id="w">August 25</a> while well east of the <a href="/wiki/Windward_Islands" id="w">Windward Islands</a>. Frances strengthened rapidly, reaching Category 4 intensity by <a href="/wiki/August_27" id="w">August 27</a>. Initially forecast to turn north and potentially threaten <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>, conditions changed and Frances&#39;s predicted track shifted westward. After grazing the <a href="/wiki/Turks_and_Caicos_Islands" id="w">Turks and Caicos Islands</a>, it plowed through the <a href="/wiki/Bahamas" id="w">Bahamas</a>. From <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a> through <a href="/wiki/September_4" id="w">September 4</a>, Frances slowly ground its way across the Bahamas. Its slow movement allowed a record 2.5 to 3 million Floridians to evacuate their homes. However, as it ground its way across the Bahamas, it weakened to a Category 2 hurricane due to wind shear, although it was still a very large storm.<sup id="_ref-FrancesTCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FrancesTCR" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>After sitting stationary off the coast of Florida for nearly 24 hours, Frances finally moved onto the coast of <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> in the early hours of <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">September 5</a>. It traveled northwest over land, briefly emerging over the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a> and striking the Florida panhandle. As it passed over <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)" id="w">Georgia</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_6" id="w">September 6</a>, it caused heavy rainfall across the southern U.S. Over 15 inches of rain were recorded in some places in <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> and <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>, causing heavy flooding. Frances was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated over <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_9" id="w">September 9</a>.</p>
<p>Damage to the United States was approximately $9 billion, making it the 10th costliest hurricane in U.S. history. Most of Hurricane Frances&#39;s damage occurred in Florida as a result of the storm&#39;s slow movement, large size, and long duration of winds. The storm is directly responsible for seven deaths; one in the Bahamas and six in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. Hurricane Frances also produced a record-setting 123 tornadoes as it moved its way through the United States.</p>

<a id="Hurricane_Gaston" name="Hurricane_Gaston"></a><h3>Hurricane Gaston</h3>
<p>{{hurricane main}}
{{infobox hurricane small}}
Tropical Depression Seven formed at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 UTC) on <a href="/wiki/August_27" id="w">August 27</a>, around 140 miles (225&#160;km) southeast of <a href="/wiki/Charleston%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. The depression meandered off the coast for the rest of the day, strengthening into Tropical Storm Gaston by midday <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a>. 
At 10 a.m. EDT (1400 UTC) on <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>, Gaston made landfall on the coast of <a href="/wiki/Bulls_Bay%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Bulls Bay, South Carolina</a>, near the towns of <a href="/wiki/McClellanville%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">McClellanville</a> and <a href="/wiki/Awendaw%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Awendaw</a>. It was downgraded to a tropical depression later that day. The storm made landfall in almost the same location as <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Hugo" id="w">Hurricane Hugo</a> in 1989.<sup id="_ref-GastonTCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GastonTCR" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>At landfall the storm was originally classified as just shy of hurricane strength. While wind damage in South Carolina was minimal, the slow-moving storm produced five to ten inches (125 to 250 mm) of rain along its path, causing extensive flooding. Gaston moved north over land, weakening to a tropical depression but still bringing torrential rain to central <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>, where at least eight people were killed in the ensuing floods. The <a href="/wiki/Shockoe_Bottom" id="w">Shockoe Bottom</a> entertainment district near downtown <a href="/wiki/Richmond%2C_Virginia" id="w">Richmond</a> was devastated by the flooding. Total damage was estimated at about $130 million.</p>
<p>Late on <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a>, as Tropical Depression Gaston crossed <a href="/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay" id="w">Chesapeake Bay</a>, its winds strengthened, and it was again classified as a tropical storm. It headed out over the Atlantic and became extratropical on <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a>, about 185 miles (300&#160;km) southeast of <a href="/wiki/Halifax_Regional_Municipality%2C_Nova_Scotia" id="w">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_19" id="w">November 19</a>, after a detailed analysis by the NHC, surface-level winds were determined to be about 75 mph (120&#160;km/h) at landfall, and Gaston was reclassified as a Category 1 hurricane.</p>

<a id="Hurricane_Ivan" name="Hurricane_Ivan"></a><h3>Hurricane Ivan</h3>
<p>{{hurricane main}}
{{infobox hurricane small}}
Ivan was a <a href="/wiki/Cape_Verde-type_hurricane" id="w">Cape Verde-type hurricane</a> that began as Tropical Depression Nine on <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a>. It became a tropical storm on <a href="/wiki/September_3" id="w">September 3</a>, and a hurricane on <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">September 5</a> while 1,040 miles (1670&#160;km) east of the Windward Islands, at 9.9° N. Later that day, while at 10.6° N, it unexpectedly underwent rapid strengthening, reaching Category 4 intensity by that evening. It was the strongest storm to have ever been known to intensify that far south. Ivan weakened slightly while continuing westward, and struck <a href="/wiki/Grenada" id="w">Grenada</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_7" id="w">September 7</a>.<sup id="_ref-IvanTCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IvanTCR" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>While moving westward through the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a>, Ivan quickly intensified to a Category 5 hurricane. It fluctuated in strength over the next few days, and passed within 30 miles (50&#160;km) of <a href="/wiki/Grand_Cayman" id="w">Grand Cayman</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_11" id="w">September 11</a>. Ivan grazed western <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a> as a Category 5, and moved into the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane turned northward over cooler waters, and made landfall in southern <a href="/wiki/Alabama" id="w">Alabama</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a> as a 130 mph (210&#160;km/h) hurricane. Ivan weakened rapidly to a tropical depression over Alabama, accelerated to the northeast, and became extratropical over the <a href="/wiki/Delmarva_Peninsula" id="w">Delmarva Peninsula</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_18" id="w">September 18</a>. Ivan&#39;s remnants turned to the southeast then southwest, and gradually re-organized over the warm Gulf Stream waters. After crossing southern <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_21" id="w">September 21</a> the system regained tropical characteristics over the Gulf of Mexico, and became a tropical storm on <a href="/wiki/September_23" id="w">September 23</a> while 140 miles (220&#160;km) south of <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a>. Ivan moved to the northwest, and reached winds of 60 mph (95&#160;km/h) before making landfall near <a href="/wiki/Cameron%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Cameron, Louisiana</a>. Ivan quickly deteriorated over <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>, and dissipated on <a href="/wiki/September_24" id="w">September 24</a>.</p>
<p>Hurricane Ivan directly killed 92 people throughout the Caribbean and United States and caused approximately $13 billion in damage to the United States, making it the fifth costliest hurricane in United States history. The hurricane destroyed 90% of Grenada&#39;s structures and devastated the island&#39;s economy, and destroyed 85% of the buildings on Grand Cayman. The combination of Hurricane Ivan with the previous rains of Frances  brought many rivers in the Southeastern U.S. to near-record flood levels. Ivan was the strongest storm of the season, and the only 2004 Atlantic hurricane to reach Category 5 intensity. Its low pressure reading of 910 mbar made it the sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record at the time.</p>

<a id="Hurricane_Jeanne" name="Hurricane_Jeanne"></a><h3>Hurricane Jeanne</h3>
<p>{{hurricane main}}
{{infobox hurricane small}}
Jeanne formed as a tropical depression east-southeast of <a href="/wiki/Guadeloupe" id="w">Guadeloupe</a> on the evening of <a href="/wiki/September_13" id="w">September 13</a>. Having strengthened to a tropical storm, Jeanne crossed <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" id="w">Puerto Rico</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_15" id="w">September 15</a>. It then moved toward <a href="/wiki/Hispaniola" id="w">Hispaniola</a>, barely reaching hurricane strength before making landfall on <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>. It tracked slowly across the northern coast of the <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" id="w">Dominican Republic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Haiti" id="w">Haiti</a>, its heavy rains bringing mudslides and flooding. Jeanne&#39;s unusually slow journey was actually caused by a weakening Hurricane Ivan. Ivan broke up a trough that was fueling Jeanne&#39;s steering currents. Interaction with Hispaniola caused it to degenerate into a tropical depression.<sup id="_ref-JeanneTCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JeanneTCR" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>After wreaking havoc on Hispaniola, Jeanne struggled to reorganize. However, it eventually began strengthening and headed north. After performing a complete loop over the open Atlantic, it headed westwards, strengthening into a Category 3 hurricane and passing over the islands of <a href="/wiki/Great_Abaco" id="w">Great Abaco</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grand_Bahama" id="w">Grand Bahama</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Bahamas" id="w">Bahamas</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_25" id="w">September 25</a>. Jeanne made landfall later in the day in Florida just 2 miles (3 kilometers) from where Frances had struck 3 weeks earlier. Building on the rainfall of <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Frances" id="w">Frances</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Ivan" id="w">Ivan</a>, Jeanne brought near-record flood levels as far north as <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia" id="w">West Virginia</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a> before its remnants turned east into the open Atlantic.</p>
<p>Jeanne is blamed for at least 3,006 deaths in <a href="/wiki/Haiti" id="w">Haiti</a> with about 2,800 in <a href="/wiki/Gona%C3%AFves" id="w">Gonaïves</a> alone, which was nearly washed away by floods and mudslides. The storm also caused 7 deaths in <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" id="w">Puerto Rico</a>, 18 in the <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" id="w">Dominican Republic</a> and at least 4 in <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, bringing the total number of deaths to at least 3,025.

It became Tropical Storm Lisa at 8 a.m. AST on <a href="/wiki/September_20" id="w">September 20</a> with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80&#160;km/h). A very small storm, its development was hindered by its proximity to Hurricane Karl. On <a href="/wiki/September_22" id="w">September 22</a>, Lisa began merging with a large tropical disturbance to its east and weakened to a tropical depression for a couple of days before regaining tropical storm strength on <a href="/wiki/September_25" id="w">September 25</a>. By then it was heading generally northwards in the mid-Atlantic.

<p>The tropical storms of 2004 ranked from highest to lowest <a href="/wiki/Accumulated_cyclone_energy" id="w">Accumulated Cyclone Energy</a> (ACE) given to three <a href="/wiki/Significant_figures" id="w">significant figures</a>. The total for the season was 225. This makes it the fourth most energetic season since 1950.<sup id="_ref-NCDC ACE_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NCDC ACE" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>ACE measures the strength and duration of a tropical cyclone. Hurricane Ivan, because it was such a long lasting and strong Cape Verde-type hurricane, contributed almost one-third of the ACE value for 2004. Ivan had the second-highest ACE of any tropical cyclone recorded in the Atlantic, behind only <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_San_Ciriaco" id="w">Hurricane San Ciriaco</a> of 1899.
