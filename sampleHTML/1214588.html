<b>John Henry Cound Brunt</b> <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Cross" id="w">VC</a>, <a href="/wiki/Military_Cross" id="w">MC</a> (<a href="/wiki/1922-12-06" id="w">1922-12-06</a>-<a href="/wiki/1944-12-10" id="w">1944-12-10</a>) was an <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> recipient of the <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Cross" id="w">Victoria Cross</a>, the most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> and <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth</a> forces. He served in Italy during the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a> and was twice decorated for bravery in action before being killed by <a href="/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)" id="w">mortar</a> fire. </p>
<p>As a young man, he had a reputation for mischief and daring, but was always respected due to his consideration for others&#8212;traits that continued in his military career and would earn him the respect of his comrades and superiors. The actions that won him the Victoria Cross exemplified this behaviour, as despite being wounded he single-handedly held off enemy troops, allowing his men to reach safety.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h1>Early life</h1>
<p>John Henry Cound Brunt was born on Wednesday <a href="/wiki/1922-12-06" id="w">1922-12-06</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Priest_Weston" id="w">Priest Weston</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shropshire" id="w">Shropshire</a> to Thomas Henry Brunt and Nesta Mary Brunt (<a href="/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" id="w">n√©e</a> Cound).  He had an elder sister named Dorothy (born <a href="/wiki/1920-05-13" id="w">1920-05-13</a>) and a younger sister Isobel (born <a href="/wiki/1923-10-05" id="w">1923-10-05</a>.  When Dorothy was eight, the family moved to a farm near <a href="/wiki/Whittington%2C_Shropshire" id="w">Whittington, Shropshire</a> where John grew up. As he became older, his fearless nature became more apparent; every week, he read the comic <i>&#34;Tiny Tots&#34;</i>, which featured instructions on &#34;How to teach yourself to swim&#34;.  One day, he asked Dorothy to take him to the Shropshire <a href="/wiki/Canal" id="w">Canal</a> which went through their farmland.  Before his sister could stop him, John had taken off all his clothes and jumped into the canal.  When they finally arrived home, their mother wanted to know why he had no clothes on, and John responded that he had been teaching himself to swim.  As he got older, his daredevil attitude became even more serious; on one occasion, he was found swinging himself along the guttering of a <a href="/wiki/Dutch_barn" id="w">dutch barn</a> sixty feet above the farmyard.<sup id="_ref-All for Valour_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-All for Valour" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>When old enough, John was enrolled at <a href="/wiki/Ellesmere_College" id="w">Ellesmere College</a> where his mischievous streak became quickly apparent through pranks and dares; once, while in the <a href="/wiki/Sanatorium" id="w">sanatorium</a> with <a href="/wiki/Mumps" id="w">mumps</a>, he slipped a laxative into the matron&#39;s tea. Nevertheless, he is fondly remembered at the school.  It was while he was at Ellesmere that he contracted <a href="/wiki/Measles" id="w">measles</a>, resulting in his need to wear glasses.<sup id="_ref-All for Valour_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-All for Valour" title="">[1]</a></sup> An enthusiastic sportsman, John played <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricket</a>, <a href="/wiki/Field_hockey" id="w">hockey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rugby_football" id="w">rugby</a>, <a href="/wiki/Water_polo" id="w">water polo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wrestling" id="w">wrestling</a>.  He was the only pupil at the school to tackle the headmaster while playing rugby, injuring the older man&#39;s knee in the process.<sup id="_ref-All for Valour_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-All for Valour" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1934, the Brunt family moved to <a href="/wiki/Paddock_Wood" id="w">Paddock Wood</a> in <a href="/wiki/Kent" id="w">Kent</a> and, in his school holidays &#34;Young John&#34; (as he was known in the village) would come home.  Although he was still a reckless individual, he was thought of very highly, and helped train the Paddock Wood <a href="/wiki/British_Home_Guard" id="w">Home Guard</a> between 1940 and 1943, assisted by his father.  He spent his last days in Paddock Wood helping with the <a href="/wiki/Hops" id="w">hop</a> harvest.<sup id="_ref-All for Valour_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-All for Valour" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>John Brunt joined the army when he left school, training as a Private with the <a href="/wiki/Queen%26%2339%3Bs_Own_Royal_West_Kent_Regiment" id="w">Queen&#39;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment</a> in 1941, and got his <a href="/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)#Commissioned officers" id="w">commission</a> on the <a href="/wiki/1943-01-02" id="w">1943-01-02</a><sup id="_ref-Gazette35997_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette35997" title="">[2]</a></sup> and was posted to North Africa.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/1943-09-09" id="w">1943-09-09</a>, Brunt&#39;s regiment landed at <a href="/wiki/Salerno" id="w">Salerno</a> in Italy and Lieutenant Brunt was given command of No.9 Platoon in A Company.

<p>Between December 1943 and January 1944, Lieutenant John Brunt commanded a Battle Patrol and saw near-constant action.  In the early hours of <a href="/wiki/15_December" id="w">15 December</a>, they received orders to destroy an enemy post based in some houses 200 yards North of the <a href="/wiki/River_Peccia" id="w">River Peccia</a>.  In efforts to break the enemy line, he crossed and re-crossed the river so many times that the troops took to calling it &#34;Brunt&#39;s Brook&#34;.  After an intense five-minute bombardment, Lieutenant Brunt led a section into an assault.  The first two houses contained two enemy soldiers, but it was the third house that provided the most resistance.  Using grenades and <a href="/wiki/Thompson_submachine_gun" id="w">Tommy guns</a>, they managed to kill eight enemy troops outside the house, as well as those inside, all belonging to the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion, 2<sup>nd</sup> <a href="/wiki/Herman_Goering_PanzerGrenadier_Regiment" id="w">Herman Goering PanzerGrenadier Regiment</a>.  After thirty minutes of intense fighting, the patrol withdrew, having had one man killed and six wounded.  While the rest of the section pulled back, Lieutenant Brunt remained behind with his Sergeant and a Private to retrieve a wounded soldier.  For his actions, he was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Military_Cross" id="w">Military Cross</a> (MC).<sup id="_ref-All for Valour_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-All for Valour" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the <a href="/wiki/1944-01-05" id="w">1944-01-05</a>, Lieutenant Brunt was in a sick bed in a rear hospital.  He pleaded with doctors to be allowed to leave to take part in an attack, and was given permission, leading his patrol under heavy fire.  He was back in the hospital twenty-four hours later with concussion after a piece of shrapnel almost split his helmet, but would have carried on fighting if it had not been for an <a href="/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer" id="w">N.C.O.</a> who forcibly led him away from the front line.<sup id="_ref-All for Valour_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-All for Valour" title="">[1]</a></sup> At the end of the campaign, Brunt is said to have commented to his friends, &#34;I&#39;ve won the M.C., now for the V.C.!&#34;<sup id="_ref-All for Valour_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-All for Valour" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>After resting in <a href="/wiki/Syria" id="w">Syria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>, John Brunt returned to Italy on <a href="/wiki/1944-07-03" id="w">1944-07-03</a>, having been promoted to temporary <a href="/wiki/Captain_(UK)" id="w">Captain</a> and second in command of &#34;D&#34; Company.  By early December 1944, the regiment was operating near <a href="/wiki/Ravenna" id="w">Ravenna</a> fighting German troops who were retreating North through Italy and on the night of <a href="/wiki/3_December" id="w">3 December</a>, the regiment began their attack on the town of <a href="/wiki/Faenza" id="w">Faenza</a>.  On the evening of <a href="/wiki/6_December" id="w">6 December</a>, they took the village of <a href="/wiki/Ragazzina" id="w">Ragazzina</a> near Faenza, and after heavy fighting the Lincolns had established defensive positions in Faenza itself.<sup id="_ref-All for Valour_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-All for Valour" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The next morning, having won the battle and the acclaim of his regiment, Captain Brunt was as eager to return to the offensive, keeping alert for more trouble as breakfast was being prepared for the men, their first meal in 48 hours.  He was standing in the doorway of the platoon headquarters, having a mug of tea and chatting with friends, when a stray German mortar bomb landed at his feet, killing him outright.  He had celebrated his 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday just four days before.<sup id="_ref-All for Valour_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-All for Valour" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
