The <b>music of the United States</b> reflects the country&#39;s multi-ethnic population through a diverse array of styles. <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" id="w">Rock and roll</a>, <a href="/wiki/Country_music" id="w">country</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues" id="w">rhythm and blues</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jazz" id="w">jazz</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_music" id="w">hip hop</a> are among the country&#39;s most internationally-renowned <a href="/wiki/Music_genre" id="w">genres</a>. Since the beginning of the 20th century, popular recorded <a href="/wiki/Music" id="w">music</a> from the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> has become increasingly known across the world, to the point where some forms of <a href="/wiki/American_popular_music" id="w">American popular music</a> are listened to almost everywhere.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The earliest inhabitants of the United States were <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native Americans</a> who played the first music in the area. Beginning in the 17th century, <a href="/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States" id="w">immigrants</a> from the <a href="/wiki/British_Isles" id="w">British Isles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>, and <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments. <a href="/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_the_United_States" id="w">African slaves</a> brought musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributed to a <a href="/wiki/Melting_pot" id="w">melting pot</a>.</p>
<p>Much of modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the late 19th century of <a href="/wiki/African_American_music" id="w">African American</a> <a href="/wiki/Blues" id="w">blues</a> and the growth in the 1920s of <a href="/wiki/Gospel_music" id="w">gospel music</a>. African American music formed a basis for popular music, which used elements derived from European and indigenous musics. The United States has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Ukraine" id="w">Ukraine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Ireland" id="w">Irish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Scotland" id="w">Scottish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Poland" id="w">Polish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latin_music" id="w">Hispanic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jewish_music" id="w">Jewish</a> communities, among others. Many American cities and towns have vibrant music scenes which, in turn, support a number of regional musical styles. Aside from cities such as <a href="/wiki/Detroit" id="w">Detroit</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Illinois" id="w">Chicago</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nashville%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Nashville</a> and <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles%2C_California" id="w">Los Angeles</a>, many smaller cities have produced distinctive styles of music. The <a href="/wiki/Cajun_music" id="w">Cajun</a> and <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Creole_music" id="w">Creole</a> traditions in <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana music</a>, the folk and popular styles of <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_music" id="w">Hawaiian music</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Bluegrass_music" id="w">bluegrass</a> and <a href="/wiki/Old_time_music" id="w">old time music</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Southeastern_United_States" id="w">Southeastern</a> states are a few examples of diversity in American music.

<a id="Characteristics" name="Characteristics"></a><h1>Characteristics</h1>
<p>The music of the United States can be characterized by the use of <a href="/wiki/Syncopation" id="w">syncopation</a> and asymmetrical rhythms, long, irregular <a href="/wiki/Melody" id="w">melodies</a>, which are said to &#34;reflect the wide open geography of (the American landscape)&#34; and the &#34;sense of personal freedom characteristic of American life&#34;.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Some distinct aspects of American music, like the <a href="/wiki/Call-and-response_(music)" id="w">call-and-response</a> format, are derived from African techniques and instruments. </p>
<p>Throughout the early part of American history, and into modern times, the relationship between American and European music has been a discussed topic among scholars of American music.  Some have urged for the adoption of more purely European techniques and styles, which are sometimes perceived as more refined or elegant, while others have pushed for a sense of musical nationalism that celebrates distinctively American styles.  Modern classical music scholar John Warthen Struble has contrasted American and European, concluding that the music of the United States is inherently distinct because the United States has not had centuries of musical evolution as a nation. Instead, the music of the United States is that of dozens or hundreds of indigenous and immigrant groups, all of which developed largely in regional isolation until the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>, when people from across the country were brought together in army units, trading musical styles and practices. Struble deemed the ballads of the Civil War &#34;the first American folk music with discernible features that can be considered unique to America: the first &#39;American&#39; sounding music, as distinct from any regional style derived from another country.&#34;<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>
{{Usculture}}
The Civil War, and the period following it, saw a general flowering of <a href="/wiki/Art_of_the_United_States" id="w">American art</a>, <a href="/wiki/Literature_of_the_United_States" id="w">literature</a> and music. Amateur musical ensembles of this era can be seen as the birth of American popular music. Music author David Ewen describes these early amateur bands as combining &#34;the depth and drama of the classics with undemanding technique, eschewing complexity in favor of direct expression. If it was vocal music, the words would be in English, despite the snobs who declared English an unsingable language. In a way, it was part of the entire awakening of America that happened after the Civil War, a time in which American painters, writers and &#39;serious&#39; composers addressed specifically American themes.&#34;<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> During this period the roots of blues, gospel, jazz and country music took shape; in the 20th century, these became the core of <a href="/wiki/American_popular_music" id="w">American popular music</a>, which further evolved into the styles like <a href="/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues" id="w">rhythm and blues</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" id="w">rock and roll</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_music" id="w">hip hop music</a>.</p>
<a id="Social_identity" name="Social_identity"></a><h2>Social identity</h2>

<p>Music intertwines with aspects of American social and cultural identity, including through <a href="/wiki/Social_structure_of_the_United_States" id="w">social class</a>, <a href="/wiki/Race" id="w">race</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maps_of_American_ancestries" id="w">ethnicity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Geography_of_the_United_States" id="w">geography</a>, <a href="/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States" id="w">religion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Languages_in_the_United_States" id="w">language</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gender" id="w">gender</a> and <a href="/wiki/Human_sexuality" id="w">sexuality</a>. The relationship between music and race is perhaps the most potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States.  The development of an <a href="/wiki/African_American_music" id="w">African American musical</a> identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the <a href="/wiki/Music_history_of_the_United_States" id="w">music history of the United States</a>.  Little documentation exists of <a href="/wiki/Colonial_America" id="w">colonial</a>-era African American music, when styles, songs and instruments from across West Africa commingled in the melting pot of slavery.  By the mid-19th century, a distinctly African American folk tradition was well-known and widespread, and African American musical techniques, instruments and images became a part of mainstream American music through <a href="/wiki/Spiritual_(music)" id="w">spirituals</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minstrel_show" id="w">minstrel shows</a> and slave songs.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through <a href="/wiki/Blues" id="w">blues</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jazz" id="w">jazz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues" id="w">rhythm and blues</a>, and then <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" id="w">rock and roll</a>, <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" id="w">soul</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_music" id="w">hip hop</a>; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created in African American styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines. In contrast, <a href="/wiki/Country_music" id="w">country music</a> derives from both African and European, as well as Native American and Hawaiian, traditions and yet has long been perceived as a form of <a href="/wiki/White_(people)" id="w">white</a> music.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Economic and social class separates American music through the creation and consumption of music, such as the upper-class patronage of <a href="/wiki/Symphony" id="w">symphony</a>-goers, and the generally poor performers of rural and ethnic folk musics.  Musical divisions based on class are not absolute, however, and are sometimes as much perceived as actual;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> popular American country music, for example, is a commercial genre designed to &#34;appeal to a working-class identity, whether or not its listeners are actually working class&#34;.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>  Country music is also intertwined with geographic identity, and is specifically rural in origin and function; other genres, like R&#38;B and hip hop, are perceived as inherently urban.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> For much of American history, music-making has been a &#34;feminized activity&#34;.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>  In the 19th century, amateur piano and singing were considered proper for middle- and upper-class women, who were, nevertheless, frequently barred from orchestras and symphonies.  Women were also a major part of early popular music performance, though recorded traditions quickly become more dominated by men.  Most male-dominated genres of popular music include female performers as well, often in a niche appealing primarily to women; these include <a href="/wiki/Gangsta_rap" id="w">gangsta rap</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metal_music" id="w">heavy metal</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Diversity" name="Diversity"></a><h2>Diversity</h2>

<p>The United States is often said to be a cultural <a href="/wiki/Melting_pot" id="w">melting pot</a>, taking in influences from across the world and creating distinctively new methods of cultural expression.  Though aspects of American music can be traced back to specific origins, claiming any particular original culture for a musical element is inherently problematic, due to the constant evolution of American music through transplanting and hybridizing techniques, instruments and genres. Elements of foreign musics arrived in the United States both through the formal sponsorship of educational and outreach events by individuals and groups, and through informal processes, as in the incidental transplantation of <a href="/wiki/Music_of_West_Africa" id="w">West African music</a> through slavery, and <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Ireland" id="w">Irish music</a> through immigration.  The most distinctly American musics are a result of cross-cultural hybridization through close contact.  Slavery, for example, mixed persons from numerous tribes in tight living quarters, resulting in a shared musical tradition that was enriched through further hybridizing with elements of indigenous, Latin and European music.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>  American ethnic, religious and racial diversity has also produced such intermingled genres as the French-African music of the <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Creole" id="w">Louisiana Creoles</a>, the Native, Mexican and European fusion <a href="/wiki/Tejano_music" id="w">Tejano music</a> and the thoroughly hybridized <a href="/wiki/Slack-key_guitar" id="w">slack-key guitar</a> and other styles of modern <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_music" id="w">Hawaiian music</a>.</p>
<p>The process of transplanting music between cultures is not without criticism.  The folk revival of the mid-20th century, for example, appropriated the musics of various rural peoples, in part to promote certain political causes, which has caused some to question whether the process caused the &#34;commercial commodification of other peoples&#39; songs... and the inevitable dilution of mean&#34; in the appropriated musics.  The issue of cultural appropriation has also been a major part of racial relations in the United States.  The use of African American musical techniques, images and conceits in popular music largely by and for white Americans has been widespread since at least the mid-19th century songs of <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Foster" id="w">Stephen Foster</a> and the rise of <a href="/wiki/Minstrel_show" id="w">minstrel shows</a>.  The American music industry has actively attempted to popularize white performers of African American music because they are more palatable to mainstream and middle-class Americans.  This process has produced such varied stars as <a href="/wiki/Benny_Goodman" id="w">Benny Goodman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eminem" id="w">Eminem</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" id="w">Elvis Presley</a>, as well as popular styles like <a href="/wiki/Blue-eyed_soul" id="w">blue-eyed soul</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rockabilly" id="w">rockabilly</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Folk_music" name="Folk_music"></a><h1>Folk music</h1>
<p>{{Main}}
Folk music in the United States is varied across the country&#39;s numerous ethnic groups. The Native American tribes each play their own varieties of folk music, most of it spiritual in nature. African American music includes <a href="/wiki/Blues" id="w">blues</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gospel_music" id="w">gospel</a>, descendants of <a href="/wiki/Music_of_West_Africa" id="w">West African music</a> brought to the Americas by slaves and mixed with Western European music. During the colonial era, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_England" id="w">English</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_France" id="w">French</a> and <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Spain" id="w">Spanish</a> styles and instruments were brought to the Americas. By the early 20th century, the United States had become a major center for folk music from around the world, including <a href="/wiki/Polka" id="w">polka</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_people" id="w">Ukrainian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polish_people" id="w">Polish</a> <a href="/wiki/Fiddle" id="w">fiddling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ashkenazi" id="w">Ashkenazi</a> <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jewish</a> <a href="/wiki/Klezmer" id="w">klezmer</a> and several kinds of <a href="/wiki/Latin_music" id="w">Latin music</a>.</p>
<p>The Native Americans played the first folk music in what is now the United States, using a wide variety of styles and techniques. Some commonalities are near universal among Native American traditional music, however, especially the lack of <a href="/wiki/Harmony" id="w">harmony</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polyphony" id="w">polyphony</a>, and the use of <a href="/wiki/Vocable" id="w">vocables</a> and descending melodic figures.

Spirituals were primarily expressions of religious faith, sung by slaves on southern plantations.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> In the mid to late 19th century, spirituals spread out of the U.S. South.

Many American composers of this period worked exclusively with European models, while others, such as <a href="/wiki/William_Billings" id="w">William Billings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Supply_Belcher" id="w">Supply Belcher</a> and <a href="/wiki/Justin_Morgan" id="w">Justin Morgan</a>, also known as the <i>First New England School</i>, developed a style almost entirely independent of European models.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Of these composers, Billings is the most well-remembered; he was also influential &#34;as the founder of the American church choir, as the first musician to use a <a href="/wiki/Pitch-pipe" id="w">pitch-pipe</a>, and as the first to introduce a <a href="/wiki/Violoncello" id="w">violoncello</a> into church service&#34;.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Many of these composers were amateur singers who developed new forms of sacred music suitable for performance by amateurs, and often using harmonic methods which would have been considered bizarre by contemporary European standards.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> These composers&#39; styles were untouched by &#34;the influence of their sophisticated European contemporaries&#34;, using modal or pentatonic scales or melodies and eschewing the European rules of harmony.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the early 19th century, America produced diverse composers such as <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Philip_Heinrich" id="w">Anthony Philip Heinrich</a>, who composed in an idiosyncratic, intentionally &#34;American&#34; style and was the first American composer to write for a symphony orchestra. Many other composers, most famously <a href="/wiki/William_Henry_Fry" id="w">William Henry Fry</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_Frederick_Bristow" id="w">George Frederick Bristow</a>, supported the idea of an American classical style, though their works were very European in orientation. It was <a href="/wiki/John_Knowles_Paine" id="w">John Knowles Paine</a>, however, who became the first American composer to be accepted in Europe. Paine&#39;s example inspired the composers of the <i>Second New England School</i>, which included such figures as <a href="/wiki/Amy_Beach" id="w">Amy Beach</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edward_MacDowell" id="w">Edward MacDowell</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Horatio_Parker" id="w">Horatio Parker</a>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Louis_Moreau_Gottschalk" id="w">Louis Moreau Gottschalk</a> is perhaps the best-remembered American composer of the 19th century, said by music historian Richard Crawford to be known for &#34;bringing indigenous or folk, themes and rhythms into music for the concert hall&#34;.

<p>The New York classical music scene included <a href="/wiki/Charles_Griffes" id="w">Charles Griffes</a>, originally from <a href="/wiki/Elmira%2C_New_York" id="w">Elmira, New York</a>, who began publishing his most innovative material in 1914. His early collaborations were attempts to use non-Western musical themes. The best-known New York composer was <a href="/wiki/George_Gershwin" id="w">George Gershwin</a>. Gershwin was a songwriter with <a href="/wiki/Tin_Pan_Alley" id="w">Tin Pan Alley</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" id="w">Broadway theatres</a>, and his works were strongly influenced by <a href="/wiki/Jazz" id="w">jazz</a>, or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time. Gershwin&#39;s work made American classical music more focused, and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention. Following Gershwin, the first major composer was <a href="/wiki/Aaron_Copland" id="w">Aaron Copland</a> from Brooklyn, who used elements of American folk music, though it remained European in technique and form.

The melody dates back to 1755 and was sung by both American and British troops.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> Patriotic songs were mostly based on English melodies, with new lyrics added to denounce British colonialism; others, however, used tunes from Ireland, Scotland or elsewhere, or did not utilize a familiar melody.

<p>Following the Civil War, minstrel shows became the first distinctively American form of music expression. The minstrel show was an indigenous form of American entertainment consisting of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music, usually performed by white people in <a href="/wiki/Blackface" id="w">blackface</a>.

The blues is a genre of African American folk music that is the basis for much of modern American popular music. Blues can be seen as part of a continuum of musical styles like country, jazz, ragtime, and gospel; though each genre evolved into distinct forms, their origins were often indistinct. Early forms of the blues evolved in and around the Mississippi Delta in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The earliest blues-like music was primarily <a href="/wiki/Call-and-response_(music)" id="w">call-and-response</a> vocal music, without harmony or accompaniment and without any formal musical structure. Slaves and their descendants created the blues by adapting the field shouts and hollers, turning them into passionate solo songs.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> When mixed with the Christian <a href="/wiki/Spiritual_(music)" id="w">spiritual</a> songs of African American churches and revival meetings, blues became the basis of <a href="/wiki/Gospel_music" id="w">gospel music</a>. Modern gospel began in African American churches in the 1920s, in the form of worshipers proclaiming their faith in an improvised, often musical manner (<i>testifying</i>). Composers like <a href="/wiki/Thomas_A._Dorsey" id="w">Thomas A. Dorsey</a> composed gospel works that used elements of blues and jazz in traditional hymns and spiritual songs.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ragtime was a style of music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and <a href="/wiki/Chromaticism" id="w">chromaticisms</a>.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> It is primarily a form of dance music utilizing the <a href="/wiki/Walking_bass" id="w">walking bass</a>, and is generally composed in <a href="/wiki/Sonata_form" id="w">sonata form</a>. Ragtime is a refined and evolved form of the African American <a href="/wiki/Cakewalk" id="w">cakewalk</a> dance, mixed with styles ranging from European marches<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> and popular songs to <a href="/wiki/Jig" id="w">jigs</a> and other dances played by large African American bands in northern cities during the end of the 19th century. The most famous ragtime performer and composer was <a href="/wiki/Scott_Joplin" id="w">Scott Joplin</a>, known for works such as &#34;Maple Leaf Rag&#34;.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>

By the end of the 1940s, however, pure blues was only a minor part of popular music, having been subsumed by offshoots like rhythm &#38; blues and the nascent rock and roll style. Some styles of electric, piano-driven blues, like the <a href="/wiki/Boogie-woogie_(music)" id="w">boogie-woogie</a>, retained a large audience.

<a href="/wiki/Jazz" id="w">Jazz</a> is a kind of music characterized by <a href="/wiki/Swung_note" id="w">swung</a> and <a href="/wiki/Blue_note" id="w">blue notes</a>, call and response vocals, <a href="/wiki/Polyrhythm" id="w">polyrhythms</a> and <a href="/wiki/Improvisation" id="w">improvisation</a>. Though originally a kind of dance music, jazz has been a major part of popular music, and has also become a major element of Western classical music. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> Early jazz was closely related to ragtime, with which it could be distinguished by the use of more intricate rhythmic improvisation. The earliest jazz bands adopted much of the vocabulary of the blues, including bent and blue notes and instrumental &#34;growls&#34; and smears otherwise not used on European instruments. Jazz&#39;s roots come from the city of <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana" id="w">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, populated by Cajuns and black Creoles, who combined the French-Canadian culture of the Cajuns with their own styles of music in the 19th century.

Though jazz had long since achieved some limited popularity, it was <a href="/wiki/Louis_Armstrong" id="w">Louis Armstrong</a> who became one of the first popular stars and a major force in the development of jazz, along with his friend pianist <a href="/wiki/Earl_Hines" id="w">Earl Hines</a>.

Armstrong also popularized <a href="/wiki/Scat_singing" id="w">scat singing</a>, an improvisational vocal technique in which nonsensical syllables (<a href="/wiki/Vocable" id="w">vocables</a>) are sung. Armstrong and Hines were influential in the rise of a kind of pop big band jazz called <i><a href="/wiki/Swing_(genre)" id="w">swing</a></i>. Swing is characterized by a strong rhythm section, usually consisting of <a href="/wiki/Double_bass" id="w">double bass</a> and drums, medium to fast tempo, and rhythmic devices like the swung note, which is common to most jazz. Swing is primarily a fusion of 1930s jazz fused with elements of the blues and Tin Pan Alley.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> Swing used bigger bands than other kinds of jazz, leading to bandleaders tightly arranging the material which discouraged improvisation, previously an integral part of jazz. Swing became a major part of African American dance, and came to be accompanied by a popular dance called the <a href="/wiki/Swing_dance" id="w">swing dance</a>.</p>
<p>Jazz influenced many performers of all the major styles of later popular music, though jazz itself never again became such a major part of American popular music as during the swing era. The later 20th century American jazz scene did, however, produce some popular crossover stars, such as <a href="/wiki/Miles_Davis" id="w">Miles Davis</a>. In the middle of the 20th century, jazz evolved into a variety of subgenres, beginning with <a href="/wiki/Bebop" id="w">bebop</a>.

R&#38;B, an abbreviation for <i>rhythm and blues</i>, is a style that arose in the 1930s and 1940s. Early R&#38;B consisted of large rhythm units &#34;smashing away behind screaming blues singers (who) had to shout to be heard above the clanging and strumming of the various electrified instruments and the churning rhythm sections&#34;.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> R&#38;B was not extensively recorded and promoted because record companies felt that it was not suited for most audiences, especially middle-class whites, because of the suggestive lyrics and driving rhythms.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> Bandleaders like <a href="/wiki/Louis_Jordan" id="w">Louis Jordan</a> innovated the sound of early R&#38;B, using a band with a small horn section and prominent rhythm instrumentation. By the end of the 1940s, he had had several hits, and helped pave the way for contemporaries like <a href="/wiki/Wynonie_Harris" id="w">Wynonie Harris</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Lee_Hooker" id="w">John Lee Hooker</a>. Many of the most popular R&#38;B songs were not performed in the rollicking style of Jordan and his contemporaries; instead they were performed by white musicians like <a href="/wiki/Pat_Boone" id="w">Pat Boone</a> in a more palatable mainstream style, which turned into pop hits.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> By the end of the 1950s, however, there was a wave of popular black blues-rock and country-influenced R&#38;B performers like <a href="/wiki/Chuck_Berry" id="w">Chuck Berry</a> gaining unprecedented fame among white listeners.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p>Soul music is a combination of rhythm and blues and gospel which began in the late 1950s in the United States. It is characterized by its use of gospel-music devices, with a greater emphasis on vocalists and the use of secular themes. The 1950s recordings of <a href="/wiki/Ray_Charles" id="w">Ray Charles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sam_Cooke" id="w">Sam Cooke</a>, and <a href="/wiki/James_Brown_(musician)" id="w">James Brown</a> are commonly considered the beginnings of soul. The <a href="/wiki/Motown_Records" id="w">Motown Record Corporation</a> of <a href="/wiki/Detroit%2C_Michigan" id="w">Detroit, Michigan</a> became highly successful during the early and mid 1960s by releasing soul recordings with heavy pop influences to make them palatable to white audiences, allowing black artists to more easily crossover to white audiences.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup></p>

The social and political ferment of the 1960s inspired artists like <a href="/wiki/Marvin_Gaye" id="w">Marvin Gaye</a> and <a href="/wiki/Curtis_Mayfield" id="w">Curtis Mayfield</a> to release albums with hard-hitting social commentary, while another variety became more dance-oriented music, evolving into <a href="/wiki/Funk" id="w">funk</a>. During the &#39;70s some highly slick and commercial bands like <a href="/wiki/The_O%26%2339%3BJays" id="w">The O&#39;Jays</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hall_%26amp%3B_Oates" id="w">Hall &#38; Oates</a> achieved mainstream success with styles like <a href="/wiki/Philly_soul" id="w">Philly soul</a> and <a href="/wiki/Blue-eyed_soul" id="w">blue-eyed soul</a>. By the end of the &#39;70s, soul, funk, rock and most other genres were dominated by tracks influenced by <a href="/wiki/Disco" id="w">disco</a>, a kind of popular dance music. With the introduction of influences from <a href="/wiki/Electro_music" id="w">electro music</a> and funk in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul music became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre of music that was once again called <i>R&#38;B</i>, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as <i>contemporary R&#38;B</i>.</p>

Rock and roll is a kind of popular music, developed out of country, blues and R&#38;B. <a href="/wiki/Origins_of_rock_and_roll" id="w">Rock&#39;s exact origins</a> and early influences have been hotly debated, and are the subjects of much scholarship.

<p>The 1960s saw several important changes in popular music, especially rock. Many of these changes took place through the <a href="/wiki/British_Invasion" id="w">British Invasion</a> where bands such as <a href="/wiki/The_Who" id="w">The Who</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" id="w">The Beatles</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones" id="w">The Rolling Stones</a>, and later <a href="/wiki/Led_Zeppelin" id="w">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Black_Sabbath" id="w">Black Sabbath</a> became immensely popular and had a profound effect on American culture and music. These changes included the move from professionally composed songs to the <a href="/wiki/Singer-songwriter" id="w">singer-songwriter</a>, and the understanding of popular music as an <a href="/wiki/Art" id="w">art</a>, rather than a form of commerce or pure entertainment.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup> These changes led to the rise of musical movements connected to political goals, such as <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955-1968)" id="w">civil rights</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Opposition_to_the_Vietnam_War" id="w">opposition to the Vietnam War</a>. Rock was at the forefront of this change. In the early 60s, rock spawned several subgenres, beginning with <a href="/wiki/Surf_music" id="w">surf</a>.  Surf was an instrumental guitar genre characterized by a distorted sound, associated with the Southern California <a href="/wiki/Surfing" id="w">surfing</a> youth culture.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup> Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf, <a href="/wiki/The_Beach_Boys" id="w">The Beach Boys</a> began recording in 1961 with an elaborate, pop-friendly and harmonic sound.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup> As their fame grew, The Beach Boys&#39; songwriter <a href="/wiki/Brian_Wilson" id="w">Brian Wilson</a> experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with the <a href="/wiki/Counterculture" id="w">counterculture</a>. The counterculture was a movement that embraced political activism, was closely connected to the <a href="/wiki/Hippie" id="w">hippie</a> subculture. The hippies were associated with <a href="/wiki/Folk_rock" id="w">folk rock</a>, <a href="/wiki/Country_rock" id="w">country rock</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Psychedelic_rock" id="w">psychedelic rock</a>. Folk and country rock were associated with the rise of politicized folk music, led by <a href="/wiki/Pete_Seeger" id="w">Pete Seeger</a> and others, especially at the <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Village" id="w">Greenwich Village</a> music scene in New York.  Folk rock entered the mainstream in the middle of the 1960s, when the singer-songwriter <a href="/wiki/Bob_Dylan" id="w">Bob Dylan</a> began his career. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands and soft, folky singer-songwriters. Psychedelic rock was a hard-driving kind of guitar-based rock, closely associated with the city of <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco%2C_California" id="w">San Francisco</a>.

<p>Following the turbulent political, social and musical changes of the 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly a discrete genre known as <i>rock and roll</i> evolved into a catchall category called simply <i><a href="/wiki/Rock_(music)" id="w">rock music</a></i>, which came to include diverse styles like <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metal_music" id="w">heavy metal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Punk_rock" id="w">punk rock</a>. During the &#39;70s most of these styles were evolving in the underground music scene, while mainstream audiences began the decade with a wave of <a href="/wiki/Singer-songwriter" id="w">singer-songwriters</a> who drew on the deeply emotional and personal lyrics of 1960s folk rock. The same period saw the rise of bombastic <a href="/wiki/Arena_rock" id="w">arena rock</a> bands, bluesy <a href="/wiki/Southern_rock" id="w">Southern rock</a> groups and mellow <a href="/wiki/Soft_rock" id="w">soft rock</a> stars. Beginning in the later 1970s, the rock singer and songwriter <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen" id="w">Bruce Springsteen</a> became a major star, with anthemic songs and dense, inscrutable lyrics that celebrated the poor and working class.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup></p>
<p>Punk was a form of rebellious rock that began in the 1970s, and was loud, aggressive and often very simple. Punk began as a reaction against the popular music of the period, especially <a href="/wiki/Disco" id="w">disco</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arena_rock" id="w">arena rock</a>. American bands in the field included, most famously, <a href="/wiki/The_Ramones" id="w">The Ramones</a> and <a href="/wiki/Talking_Heads" id="w">Talking Heads</a>, the latter playing a more avant-garde style that was closely associated with punk before evolving into mainstream <a href="/wiki/New_Wave_music" id="w">New Wave</a>.<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup> In the 1980s some punk fans and bands became disillusioned with the growing popularity of the style, resulting in an even more aggressive style called <a href="/wiki/Hardcore_punk" id="w">hardcore punk</a>. Hardcore was a form of sparse punk, consisting of short, fast, and intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth, with such influential bands as <a href="/wiki/Bad_Brains" id="w">Bad Brains</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Dead_Kennedys" id="w">Dead Kennedys</a>. Hardcore began in metropolises like <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>, though most major American cities had their own local scenes in the 1980s.<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup> Hardcore, punk, and garage rock were the roots of <i><a href="/wiki/Alternative_rock" id="w">alternative rock</a></i>, a diverse grouping of rock subgenres that were explicitly opposed to mainstream music, and that arose from the punk and post-punk styles. In the United States, many cities developed local alternative rock scenes, including Minneapolis and Seattle.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup> Seattle&#39;s local scene produced <a href="/wiki/Grunge_music" id="w">grunge music</a>, a dark and brooding style inspired by hardcore, <a href="/wiki/Psychedelia" id="w">psychedelia</a>, and alternative rock.<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup> With the addition of a more melodic element to the sound of bands like <a href="/wiki/Nirvana_(band)" id="w">Nirvana</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pearl_Jam" id="w">Pearl Jam</a>, grunge became wildly popular across the United States<sup id="_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[96]</a></sup> in 1991.</p>

<p>Heavy metal is characterized by aggressive, driving rhythms, amplified and distorted guitars, grandiose lyrics and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal&#39;s origins lie in the hard rock bands who took blues and rock and created a heavy sound centered around the guitar and drums. Most of the pioneers in the field were British; the first major American bands came in the early 1970s, like <a href="/wiki/Blue_%C3%96yster_Cult" id="w">Blue Öyster Cult</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aerosmith" id="w">Aerosmith</a>. Heavy metal remained, however, a largely underground phenomenon. During the 1980s the first major pop-metal style arose and dominated the charts for several years; this was <a href="/wiki/Glam_metal" id="w">glam metal</a>, a hard rock and pop fusion with a raucous spirit and a <a href="/wiki/Glam" id="w">glam</a>-influenced visual aesthetic. Some of these bands, like <a href="/wiki/Bon_Jovi" id="w">Bon Jovi</a>, became international stars. The band <a href="/wiki/Guns_N%26%2339%3B_Roses" id="w">Guns N&#39; Roses</a> rose to fame near the end of the decade with an image that was a reaction against the glam metal aesthetic. By the mid-1980s heavy metal had branched in so many different directions that fans, record companies, and fanzines created numerous subgenres.  The United States was especially known for one of these subgenres, <a href="/wiki/Thrash_metal" id="w">thrash metal</a>, which was innovated by bands like <a href="/wiki/Anthrax_(band)" id="w">Anthrax</a>, <a href="/wiki/Megadeth" id="w">Megadeth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Metallica" id="w">Metallica</a> and <a href="/wiki/Slayer" id="w">Slayer</a>, with Metallica being the most commercially successful.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_culture" id="w">Hip hop</a> is a cultural movement, of which music is a part. <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_music" id="w">Hip hop music</a> is itself composed of two parts: <a href="/wiki/Rapping" id="w">rapping</a>, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals; and <a href="/wiki/DJ" id="w">DJing</a>, the production of instrumentation either through <a href="/wiki/Sampling_(music)" id="w">sampling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Musical_instrument" id="w">instrumentation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Turntablism" id="w">turntablism</a> or <a href="/wiki/Beatboxing" id="w">beatboxing</a>.<sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[97]</a></sup> Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in <a href="/wiki/The_Bronx" id="w">The Bronx</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>. Jamaican immigrant <a href="/wiki/DJ_Kool_Herc" id="w">DJ Kool Herc</a> is widely regarded as the progenitor of hip hop; he brought with him from Jamaica the practice of <a href="/wiki/Toasting" id="w">toasting</a> over the rhythms of popular songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce the soul, funk and R&#38;B songs that the DJs played, and to keep the crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion break of songs (when the rhythm climaxes), producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over. By the beginning of the 1980s, there were popular hip hop songs, and the celebrities of the scene, like <a href="/wiki/LL_Cool_J" id="w">LL Cool J</a>, gained mainstream renown. Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness, or fused hip hop with jazz, heavy metal, <a href="/wiki/Techno" id="w">techno</a>, funk and soul. New styles appeared in the latter part of the 1980s, like <a href="/wiki/Alternative_hip_hop" id="w">alternative hip hop</a> and the closely related <a href="/wiki/Jazz_rap" id="w">jazz rap</a> fusion, pioneered by rappers like <a href="/wiki/De_La_Soul" id="w">De La Soul</a>.</p>
<p>The crews <a href="/wiki/Public_Enemy" id="w">Public Enemy</a> and <a href="/wiki/N.W.A." id="w">N.W.A.</a> did the most to bring hip hop to national attention, beginning in the late 1980s; the former did so with incendiary and politically charged lyrics, while the latter became the first prominent example of <a href="/wiki/Gangsta_rap" id="w">gangsta rap</a>. Gangsta rap is a kind of hip hop, most importantly characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality and a dangerous criminal image.<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup> Though the origins of gangsta rap can be traced back to the mid-1980s style of Philadelphia&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Schoolly_D" id="w">Schoolly D</a> and the West Coast&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ice-T" id="w">Ice-T</a>, the style broadened and came to apply to many different regions in the country, to rappers from New York, such as <a href="/wiki/Notorious_B.I.G" id="w">Notorious B.I.G</a>, and to rappers on the West Coast, such as <a href="/wiki/Too_%24hort" id="w">Too $hort</a> and <a href="/wiki/N.W.A" id="w">N.W.A</a>. A distinctive <a href="/wiki/West_Coast_rap" id="w">West Coast rap</a> scene spawned the early 1990s <a href="/wiki/G-funk" id="w">G-funk</a> sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy sound, often from 1970s funk <a href="/wiki/Sampling_(music)" id="w">samples</a>; the best-known proponents were the rappers <a href="/wiki/2Pac" id="w">2Pac</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dr._Dre" id="w">Dr. Dre</a> and <a href="/wiki/Snoop_Dogg" id="w">Snoop Dogg</a>.

<p>The American music industry is dominated by large companies that produce, market and distribute certain kinds of music.

Many small music industries are built around a core fanbase who may be based largely in one region, such as <a href="/wiki/Tejano_music" id="w">Tejano</a> or <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Hawaii" id="w">Hawaiian music</a>, or they may be widely dispersed, such as the audience for Jewish <a href="/wiki/Klezmer" id="w">klezmer</a>.</p>
<p>The single largest niche industry is based on Latin music. Latin music has long influenced American popular music, and was an especially crucial part of the development of jazz. Modern pop Latin styles include a wide array of genres imported from across Latin America, including Colombian <a href="/wiki/Cumbia" id="w">cumbia</a>, Puerto Rican <a href="/wiki/Reggaeton" id="w">reggaeton</a> and the Mexican <a href="/wiki/Corrido" id="w">corrido</a>.  Latin popular music in the United States began with a wave of dance bands in the 1930s and &#39;50s. The most popular styles included the <a href="/wiki/Conga" id="w">conga</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Rumba" id="w">rumba</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mambo" id="w">mambo</a>. In the &#39;50s <a href="/wiki/Perez_Prado" id="w">Perez Prado</a> made the <a href="/wiki/Cha-cha-cha" id="w">cha-cha-cha</a> famous, and the rise of <a href="/wiki/Afro-Cuban_jazz" id="w">Afro-Cuban jazz</a> opened many ears to the harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic possibilities of Latin music. The most famous American form of Latin music, however, is <a href="/wiki/Salsa_music" id="w">salsa</a>. Salsa incorporates many styles and variations; the term can be used to describe most forms of popular Cuban-derived genres. Most specifically, however, <i>salsa</i> refers to a particular style that was developed by mid-1970s groups of New York City-area Cuban and Puerto Rican immigrants, and stylistic descendants like 1980s <a href="/wiki/Salsa_romantica" id="w">salsa romantica</a>.<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup> Salsa rhythms are complicated, with several patterns played simultaneously.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Government_of_the_United_States" id="w">government of the United States</a> regulates the music industry, enforces <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" id="w">intellectual property</a> laws and promotes and collects certain kinds of music.  Under <a href="/wiki/United_States_copyright_law" id="w">American copyright law</a>, musical works, including recordings and compositions, are protected as intellectual property as soon as they are fixed in a tangible form.  Copyright holders often register their work with the <a href="/wiki/Library_of_Congress" id="w">Library of Congress</a>, which maintains a collection of the material.  In addition, the Library of Congress has actively sought out culturally and musicologically significant materials since the early 20th century, such as by sending researchers to record folk music.  These researchers include the pioneering American folk song collector <a href="/wiki/Alan_Lomax" id="w">Alan Lomax</a>, whose work helped inspire the <a href="/wiki/Roots_revival" id="w">roots revival</a> of the mid-20th century.

<p>Music has long affected the <a href="/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States" id="w">politics of the United States</a>.  Political parties and movements frequently use music and song to communicate their ideals and values, and to provide entertainment at political functions.  The presidential campaign of <a href="/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison" id="w">William Henry Harrison</a> was the first to greatly benefit from music, after which it became standard practice for major candidates to use songs to create public enthusiasm.  In more recent decades, politicians often chose <a href="/wiki/Theme_song" id="w">theme songs</a>, some of which have become iconic; the song &#34;Happy Days Are Here Again&#34;, for example, has been associated with the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic Party</a> since the 1932 campaign of <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" id="w">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>.  Since the 1950s, however, music has declined in importance in politics, replaced by televised campaigning with little or no music.  Certain forms of music became more closely associated with political protest, especially in the 1960s.  <a href="/wiki/Gospel_music" id="w">Gospel</a> stars like <a href="/wiki/Mahalia_Jackson" id="w">Mahalia Jackson</a> became important figures in the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955-1968)" id="w">Civil Rights Movement</a>, while the American folk revival helped spread the <a href="/wiki/Counterculture" id="w">counterculture</a> of the 1960s and <a href="/wiki/Opposition_to_the_Vietnam_War" id="w">opposition to the Vietnam War</a>.<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup></p>

The American music industry includes a number of fields, ranging from record companies to <a href="/wiki/Radio_in_the_United_States" id="w">radio stations</a> and community orchestras. Total industry revenue is about $40 billion worldwide, and about $12 billion in the United States.<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[103]</a></sup>  Most of the world&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Major_label" id="w">major record companies</a> are based in the United States; they are represented by the <a href="/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America" id="w">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA). The major record companies produce material by artists that have signed to one of their <a href="/wiki/Record_label" id="w">record labels</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Brand_name" id="w">brand name</a> often associated with a particular genre or <a href="/wiki/Record_producer" id="w">record producer</a>. Record companies may also promote and market their artists, through advertising, public performances and concerts, and television appearances. Record companies may be affiliated with other music media companies, which produce a product related to popular recorded music. These include television channels like <a href="/wiki/MTV" id="w">MTV</a>, magazines like <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" id="w">Rolling Stone</a></i> and radio stations. In recent years the music industry has been embroiled in turmoil over the rise of the Internet downloading of <a href="/wiki/Copyright" id="w">copyrighted</a> music; many musicians and the RIAA have sought to punish fans who illegally download copyrighted music.<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup></p>
<p>Radio stations in the United States often broadcast popular music. Each music station has a <a href="/wiki/Radio_format" id="w">format</a>, or a category of songs to be played; these are generally similar to but not the same as ordinary generic classification. Many radio stations in the United States are locally owned and operated, and may offer an eclectic assortment of recordings; many other stations are owned by large companies like <a href="/wiki/Clear_Channel" id="w">Clear Channel</a>, and are generally based around a small, repetitive <a href="/wiki/Playlist" id="w">playlist</a>.  Commercial sales of recordings are tracked by <i><a href="/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)" id="w">Billboard</a></i> magazine, which compiles a number of <a href="/wiki/Music_chart" id="w">music charts</a> for various fields of recorded music sales.  The <a href="/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100" id="w">Billboard Hot 100</a> is the top <a href="/wiki/Pop_music" id="w">pop music</a> chart for <a href="/wiki/Single_(music)" id="w">singles</a>, a recording consisting of a handful of songs; longer pop recordings are <a href="/wiki/Album" id="w">albums</a>, and are tracked by the <a href="/wiki/Billboard_200" id="w">Billboard 200</a>.<sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup> Though recorded music is commonplace in American homes, many of the music industry&#39;s revenue comes from a small number of devotees; for example, 62% of album sales come from less than 25% of the music-buying audience.<sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[106]</a></sup>  Total CD sales in the United States topped 705 million units sold in 2005, and singles sales just under three million.<sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[107]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though the major record companies dominate the American music industry, an <a href="/wiki/Indie_music" id="w">independent music industry</a> (<i>indie music</i>) does exist. Indie music is mostly based around local record labels with limited, if any, retail distribution outside a small region. Artists sometimes record for an indie label and gain enough acclaim to be signed to a major label; others choose to remain at an indie label for their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release some or all of their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen.<sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[108]</a></sup>  In addition to recording artists of many kinds, there are numerous fields of professional musicianship in the United States, many of whom rarely record, including community orchestras, wedding singers and bands, lounge singers and nightclub DJs.  The <a href="/wiki/American_Federation_of_Musicians" id="w">American Federation of Musicians</a> is the largest American <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" id="w">labor union</a> for professional musicians.  However, only 15% of the Federation&#39;s members have steady music employment.<sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[109]</a></sup></p>

Music is an important part of <a href="/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States" id="w">education in the United States</a>, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools, and is an elective in later years.<sup id="_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#_note-110" title="">[110]</a></sup> High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large <a href="/wiki/School_band" id="w">school band</a>. Music may also be a part of theatrical productions put on by a school&#39;s drama department. Many public and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the <a href="/wiki/Marching_band" id="w">marching band</a> that performs at high school sports games, a trend that began with the wide popularity of Sousa&#39;s bands in the 1880s and 1890s.</p>
<p>Higher education in the field of music in the United States is mostly based around large <a href="/wiki/Universities_in_the_United_States" id="w">universities</a>, though there are important small music <a href="/wiki/Academy" id="w">academies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Music_school" id="w">conservatories</a>. University <a href="/wiki/College_or_university_school_of_music" id="w">music departments</a> may sponsor bands ranging from marching bands that are an important part of collegiate sporting events, prominently featuring <a href="/wiki/Fight_song" id="w">fight songs</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Barbershop_music" id="w">barbershop</a> groups, <a href="/wiki/Glee_club" id="w">glee clubs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jazz_band" id="w">jazz ensembles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Symphony" id="w">symphonies</a>, and may additionally sponsor musical outreach programs, such as by bringing foreign performers to the area for concerts.

<a id="Scholarship" name="Scholarship"></a><h1>Scholarship</h1>

<p>The scholarly study of music in the United States includes work relating music to social class, racial, ethnic and religious identity, gender and sexuality, as well as studies of music history, musicology and other topics.  The academic study of American music can be traced back to the late 19th century, when researchers like <a href="/wiki/Alice_Fletcher" id="w">Alice Fletcher</a> and <a href="/wiki/Francis_La_Flesche" id="w">Francis La Flesche</a> studied the music of the <a href="/wiki/Omaha_(tribe)" id="w">Omaha peoples</a>, working for the <a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_American_Ethnology" id="w">Bureau of American Ethnology</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Peabody_Museum_of_Archaeology_and_Ethnology" id="w">Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology</a>.  In the 1890s and into the early 20th century, musicological recordings were made among indigenous, Hispanic, African-American and Anglo-American peoples of the United States.  Many worked for the <a href="/wiki/Library_of_Congress" id="w">Library of Congress</a>, first under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Sonneck" id="w">Oscar Sonneck</a>, chief of the Library&#39;s Music Divisions.<sup id="_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#_note-111" title="">[111]</a></sup>  These researchers included <a class="externallink" href="http://nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu/findaid/ark:/80444/xv07188" rel="nofollow" title="http://nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu/findaid/ark:/80444/xv07188">Robert W.

<p>Early 20th scholarly analysis of American music tended to interpret European-derived classical traditions as the most worthy of study, with the folk, religious and traditional musics of the common people denigrated as low-class and of little artistic or social worth.  American music history was compared to the much longer historical record of European nations, and was found wanting, leading writers like the composer <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Farwell" id="w">Arthur Farwell</a> to ponder what sorts of musical traditions might arise from American culture, in his 1915 <i>Music in America</i>.  In 1930, <a href="/wiki/John_Tasker_Howard" id="w">John Tasker Howard</a>&#39;s <i>Our American Music</i> became a standard analysis, focusing on largely on concert music composed in the United States.<sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[113]</a></sup>  Since the analysis of musicologist <a href="/wiki/Charles_Seeger" id="w">Charles Seeger</a> in the mid-20th century, American music history has often been described as intimately related to perceptions of race and ancestry.  Under this view, the diverse racial and ethnic background of the United States has both promoted a sense of musical separation between the races, while still fostering constant acculturation, as elements of European, African and indigenous musics have shifted between fields.<sup id="_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#_note-114" title="">[114]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_Chase" id="w">Gilbert Chase</a>&#39;s <i>America&#39;s Music, from the Pilgrims to the Present</i>, was the first major work to examine the music of the entire United States, and recognize folk traditions as more culturally significant than music for the concert hall.  Chase&#39;s analysis of a diverse American musical identity has remained the dominant view among the academic establishment.<sup id="_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#_note-115" title="">[115]</a></sup>  Until the 1960s and 70s, however, most musical scholars in the United States continued to study European music, limiting themselves only to certain fields of American music, especially European-derived classical and operatic styles, and sometimes African American jazz.  More modern musicologists and ethnomusicologists have studied subjects ranging from the national musical identity to the individual styles and techniques of specific communities in a particular time of American history.<sup id="_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#_note-116" title="">[116]</a></sup>  Prominent recent studies of American music include <a href="/wiki/Charles_Hamm" id="w">Charles Hamm</a>&#39;s <i>Music in the New World</i> from 1983, and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Crawford" id="w">Richard Crawford</a>&#39;s <i>America&#39;s Musical Life</i> from 2001.<sup id="_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#_note-117" title="">[117]</a></sup></p>

Music is an important part of several American holidays, especially playing a major part in the wintertime celebration of <a href="/wiki/Christmas" id="w">Christmas</a>. <a href="/wiki/Christmas_music" id="w">Music of the holiday</a> includes both religious songs like &#34;<a href="/wiki/O_Holy_Night" id="w">O Holy Night</a>&#34; and secular songs like &#34;<a href="/wiki/Jingle_Bells" id="w">Jingle Bells</a>&#34;.
