<p>When asked about the government&#39;s response to the incident, State Department spokesman <a href="/wiki/Richard_Boucher" id="w">Richard Boucher</a> said the U.S. government has been &#34;very consistently critical of the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, we&#39;re very concerned about the outbreak of violence in Andijan, in particular the escape of prisoners, including possibly members of the <a href="/wiki/Islamic_Movement_of_Uzbekistan" id="w">Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan</a>, an organization we consider a terrorist organization. I think at this point we&#39;re looking to all the parties involved to exercise restraint to avoid any unnecessary loss of life.&#34; At another point Boucher said, &#34;It&#39;s becoming increasingly clear that very large numbers of civilians were killed by the indiscriminate use of force by Uzbek forces. There needs to be a credible and a transparent accounting to establish the facts of the matter of what occurred in Andijon. At the same time I think it is clear that the episode began by an armed attack on the prison and on other government facilities. there are reports of hostage-taking and other claims that should be investigated.

<a id="Clan_struggle_theory" name="Clan_struggle_theory"></a><h1>Clan struggle theory</h1>
<p>One interpretation of the unrest and the preceding trial mainly espoused by Central Asian scholars is an inter-clan struggle between the <a href="/wiki/Tashkent_clan" id="w">Tashkent-Ferghana clan alliance</a> and the rival <a href="/wiki/Samarqand_clan" id="w">Samarqand clan</a>.<sup id="_ref-CLANTHEORY_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CLANTHEORY" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CLANALLIANCE_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CLANALLIANCE" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/25_May" id="w">25 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a> the legislative chamber of Andijan&#39;s regional government voted to impeach Kobiljon Obidov, the Governor of Andijan and a leading member of the <a href="/wiki/Ferghana_clan" id="w">Ferghana clan</a>, replacing him with Saydullo Begaliyev, the former Minister of Agriculture and Water in the national government. Governor Obidov&#39;s involvement in several political scandals lost him favor with President Karimov, who personally attended his impeachment proceedings. According to an anonymous source who spoke with <i>EurasiaNet</i> Obidov &#34;was the province&#39;s master ... businesses favored by the hokim got the green light for everything. All the entrepreneurs who enjoyed [Obidov&#39;s] patronage,&#34; including the 23 businessmen, &#34;grew rich.&#34; In late 2004 Karimov appointed Ikromkhon Nazhmiddinov, who succeeded Begaliyev as the Minister of Agriculture and Water, Governor of <a href="/wiki/Ferghana_province" id="w">Ferghana province</a>.<sup id="_ref-CLAN_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CLAN" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The source said, &#34;Criminal proceedings were started against many of his [Obidov&#39;s] administration members. The new hokim also decided to re-divide the businesses in the province; he cracked down on the entrepreneurs who had been supported by Obidov. They were told to sell their businesses for a pittance either to him [Begaliyev] or his people, or face legal proceedings.&#34;<sup id="_ref-CLAN_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CLAN" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Prior to the Andijan massacre the Samarqand clan maintained control over the Interior Ministry under the leadership of Zakir Almatov and the <a href="/wiki/Tashkent_clan" id="w">Tashkent clan</a> controlled the National Security Service under the leadership of Rustam Innoyatov. Rustam Burnashev and Irina Chernykh of the Central Asia-Institute argue that rumors of Karimov&#39;s resignation due to ill-health prompted the two leaders to try to seize power. Both leaders considered <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%E2%80%99%C3%A9tat" id="w">coup d’états</a> in 2004, early 2005, and in mid-2005.<sup id="_ref-CLANTHEORY_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CLANTHEORY" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the unrest security forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense acted as police forces. Ministry of Interior troops were abolished and counter-terrorism divisions were put under the command of the Ministry of Defense or the National Security Service, run by the Tashkent clan. Karimov fired Defense Minister Kadyr Gulyamov, Interior Minister Almatov, Head of the Joint Headquarters of the Armed Forces Ismail Ergashev, and Commander of the Eastern military district Kosimali Akhmedov. Karimov replaced Almatov with the deputy director of the Uzbek National Security Service, a member of the Tashkent clan. This greatly shifted control of security to the Tashkent clan which has traditionally controlled the National Security Service.<sup id="_ref-CLANTHEORY_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CLANTHEORY" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-IM_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IM" title="">[61]</a></sup> Analysts had previously suggested that the Interior Ministry, under Almatov&#39;s leadership, had organized the 1999 Tashkent bombings. Others have suggested the bombings were done by the SNB under the leadership of Rustam Inoyatov, who at the time led the Tashkent clan. Analysts suggested a series of bombings in 2004 in Tashkent and <a href="/wiki/Bukhara" id="w">Bukhara</a> may have been done by the SNB against the MVD.<sup id="_ref-BOMBINGS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BOMBINGS" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dilyor Jumabayev, a prominent member of Hizb ut-Tahrir, later said in an interview in Kara-Suu, Kyrgyzstan that in February 2005 agents of Uzbekistan&#39;s secret police offered to pay Hizb ut-Tahrir members to overthrow Andijan&#39;s government; &#34;But we refused. They said they were sick and tired of Karimov&#39;s regime. But we said, &#39;After Karimov will come another Karimov.&#39; We said such things are sin.
