<p>Hubbard was a highly controversial public figure during his lifetime. Many details of his life remain disputed, with official and unofficial biographies depicting Hubbard in radically different ways.

<p>L. Ron Hubbard was born in 1911 in <a href="/wiki/Tilden%2C_Nebraska" id="w">Tilden, Nebraska</a> to Ledora May Hubbard (née Waterbury) and Harry Ross Hubbard. His father was born Henry August Wilson in <a href="/wiki/Fayette%2C_Iowa" id="w">Fayette, Iowa</a>, but was <a href="/wiki/Orphan" id="w">orphaned</a> as an infant and adopted by the Hubbards, a farming family from <a href="/wiki/Fredericksburg%2C_Iowa" id="w">Fredericksburg, Iowa</a>. Harry joined the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" id="w">United States Navy</a> in <a href="/wiki/1904" id="w">1904</a>, leaving the service in <a href="/wiki/1908" id="w">1908</a>, then re-enlisted in <a href="/wiki/1917" id="w">1917</a> when the United States <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">declared war on Germany</a>. He served in the Navy until 1946, reaching the rank of <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-Commander" id="w">Lieutenant-Commander</a> in <a href="/wiki/1934" id="w">1934</a>.<sup id="_ref-Bare-faced_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bare-faced" title="">[10]</a></sup> Ledora  was a <a href="/wiki/Feminist" id="w">feminist</a> who had trained to become a <a href="/wiki/High_school" id="w">high school</a> teacher and married Harry in 1909. </p>
<p>The Hubbards moved first to <a href="/wiki/Kalispell%2C_Montana" id="w">Kalispell, Montana</a> and then to <a href="/wiki/Helena%2C_Montana" id="w">Helena</a>, the state capital. Church biographies have stated that during this period Hubbard became the protegé of &#34;Old Tom, a <a href="/wiki/Blackfoot" id="w">Blackfoot</a> Indian medicine man ... [who] passe[d] on much of the tribal lore to his young friend&#34; and that at the age of four, he was &#34;honored with the status of blood brother of the Blackfeet in a ceremony that is still recalled by tribal elders.&#34;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Hubbard&#39;s interest in the Blackfeet took literary form in his 1937 novel, &#34;Buckskin Brigades&#34;, a &#34;novel of one man&#39;s courageous struggle to save the Blackfoot Nation from destruction by the Northwestern fur traders&#34;.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> In 1985, members of Blackfeet Nation, Montana, commemorated &#34;the seventieth anniversary of [L.

The white Blackfeet historian Hugh Dempsey has commented that the act of <a href="/wiki/Blood_brother" id="w">blood brotherhood</a> was &#34;never done among the Blackfeet&#34;, and Blackfeet Nation officials have disavowed attempts to &#34;re-establish&#34; Hubbard as a &#34;blood brother&#34; of the Blackfeet. Former vice president of the tribe&#39;s executive committee, John Yellow Kidney has also said of the letter claiming to re-establish Hubbard as a blood brother, &#34;You should not give it (the document) very much credibility, I don&#39;t.&#34;<sup id="_ref-LATstaking_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LATstaking" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Harry&#39;s naval career led to the family moving several more times, first to <a href="/wiki/San_Diego" id="w">San Diego</a>, then to <a href="/wiki/Oakland%2C_California" id="w">Oakland, California</a> followed by <a href="/wiki/Puget_Sound" id="w">Puget Sound</a>, <a href="/wiki/Washington" id="w">Washington</a> and finally to <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>. During this period L.

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">One of Hubbard&#39;s controversial journal entries during his visit to China in 1928</div></p>
<p>Hubbard sometimes displayed attitudes that were at odds with the picture his followers try to present of him.  For instance, during his visit to China at the age of seventeen, he made diary entries such as: &#34;As a <a href="/wiki/Chinaman" id="w">Chinaman</a> can not live up to a thing, he always drags it down.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Bare-faced_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bare-faced" title="">[10]</a></sup> and &#34;They smell of all the baths they didnt {{sic}} take. The trouble with China is, there are too many <a href="/wiki/Chink" id="w">chinks</a> here.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Bare-faced_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bare-faced" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>  Similarly, Hubbard described the Tibetan Buddhist temples as &#34;miserably cold and very shabby . . . The people worshiping have voices like bull-frogs and beat a drum and play a brass horn to accompany their singing (?)&#34;<sup id="_ref-Bare-faced_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bare-faced" title="">[10]</a></sup> and called them &#34;very odd and heathenish&#34;.<sup id="_ref-MBTR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup>  He also wrote about <a href="/wiki/Colored" id="w">colored</a> people in <i>Scientology: Fundamentals of Thought</i> : &#34;Unlike the yellow and brown people, the white does not usually believe he can get attention from matter or objects. The yellow and brown believe for the most part ... that rocks, trees, walls, etc., can give them attention&#34;<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> and &#34;...so we see the African tribesman, with his complete contempt for the truth, and his emphasis on brutality and savagery...&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> In the 2007 edition of the book, &#34;primitive&#34; is substituted for &#34;African&#34; in the passage just mentioned.</p>
<p>While such attitudes might not be especially surprising for a white teenager born in <a href="/wiki/1911" id="w">1911</a>, they are vastly at odds with the stories he would later tell and his followers would repeat:</p>
<dl><dd>Among other wonders, Ron told of watching monks meditate for weeks on end, contemplating higher truths ... he took advantage of this unique opportunity to study Far Eastern culture. ... he befriended and learned ... a thoroughly insightful Beijing magician who represented the last of the line of Chinese magicians from the court of <a href="/wiki/Kublai_Khan" id="w">Kublai Khan</a>.  ... Old Mayo was also well versed in China’s ancient wisdom that had been handed down from generation to generation. Ron passed many evenings in the company of such wise men, eagerly absorbing their words ... he closely examined the surrounding culture. In addition to the local Tartar tribes, he spent time with nomadic bandits originally from <a href="/wiki/Mongolia" id="w">Mongolia</a> ... [t]hese sojourns in Asia and the Pacific islands had a profound effect, giving Ron a subjective understanding of <a href="/wiki/Eastern_philosophy" id="w">Eastern philosophy</a> ... the world itself was his classroom, and he studied in it voraciously, recording what he saw and learned in his ever-present diaries, which he carefully preserved for future reference.<sup id="_ref-WiS98_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WiS98" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Hubbard said that he was made a lama priest himself by Old Mayo.<sup id="_ref-MBTR_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup>  Hubbard&#39;s &#34;ever-present diaries&#34; were introduced into evidence in <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Scientology_v._Gerald_Armstrong" id="w">the Armstrong trial</a>; they make no mention of Old Mayo the Beijing magician or nomad bandits and no reflection on Eastern philosophy.<sup id="_ref-Blue Sky_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blue Sky" title="">[9]</a></sup> Similarly, L. Ron Hubbard expressed support for creating <a href="/wiki/Township_(South_Africa)" id="w">townships in South Africa</a>:  &#34;Having viewed slum clearance projects in most major cities of the world may I state that you have conceived and created in the Johannesburg townships what is probably the most impressive and adequate resettlement activity in existence.&#34;<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>While in Guam,<sup id="_ref-aapsa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aapsa" title="">[27]</a></sup> Hubbard was befriended by Commander <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Cressman_Thompson" id="w">Joseph &#34;Snake&#34; Thompson</a> (1874-1943), who had recently returned from Vienna and studies with <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" id="w">Sigmund Freud</a>, and was stationed as a member of the Naval Medical Corps.<sup id="_ref-aapsa_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aapsa" title="">[27]</a></sup> Through the course of their friendship, the commander spent many an afternoon teaching Ron what he knew of the human mind.<sup id="_ref-chronicle01_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chronicle01" title="">[14]</a></sup> Thompson is an important figure in official Church accounts of Hubbard&#39;s life and was referred to in many of Hubbard&#39;s works in support of his assertions of possessing expertise in Freudian <a href="/wiki/Psychoanalysis" id="w">psychoanalysis</a>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2>Education</h2>
<p>After studies at Swavely Preparatory School in Manassas, Virginia, and graduating from Woodward School for Boys in 1930, Hubbard enrolled at <a href="/wiki/The_George_Washington_University" id="w">The George Washington University</a> in September of 1930, where he began studying a major in <a href="/wiki/Civil_engineering" id="w">civil engineering</a>. There he became one of eight assistant editors of the University newspaper <i>&#34;The University Hatchet&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> and was a member of several of the university&#39;s clubs and societies, including the Twentieth Marine Corps Reserve and the George Washington College Company.<sup id="_ref-bio77_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bio77" title="">[31]</a></sup> His grades were poor, and university records show that he attended for only two semesters after which he was placed on academic probation &#34;for deficiency in scholarship&#34; in September of 1931, leaving the university without a degree and &#34;entitled to a statement of honorable dismissal.&#34;</p>
<p>Observers have questioned assertions that Hubbard and the Church of Scientology later made about his study at The George Washington University. In the preface for his 1951 book <i><a href="/wiki/Science_of_Survival" id="w">Science of Survival</a></i>, Hubbard thanks &#34;my instructors in atomic and molecular phenomena, mathematics and the humanities at George Washington University and at <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton</a>&#34; (Hubbard attended a four-month course in military government at the Naval Training School, located at Princeton during the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a>.<sup id="_ref-Bare-faced_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bare-faced" title="">[10]</a></sup>).

In June 1932 Hubbard headed the &#34;Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition&#34;, a two-and-a-half-month, 5,000-mile voyage aboard a chartered 200-foot, four-masted schooner called &#34;Doris Hamlin&#34; with over fifty fellow college students. Its purpose was to collect floral and reptilian specimens for the University of Michigan and to film recreations of pirate activity and haunts. The voyage was a disappointment, with only three of the sixteen planned ports of call visited.

In a <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a> interview for <a href="/wiki/Penthouse_(magazine)" id="w">Penthouse magazine</a> that he later retracted, DeWolf said, &#34;according to him and my mother&#34;, he was the result of a failed abortion and recalls at six years old seeing his father performing an abortion on his mother with a coat hanger. In the same interview, he said &#34;Scientology is a power-and-money-and-intelligence-gathering game&#34; and described his father as &#34;only interested in money, sex, booze, and drugs.&#34;<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Later, in a sworn affidavit, DeWolf stated that he had

<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>From the summer of 1941 to late 1945, during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, Hubbard served in the United States Navy. Based on the representations of his experience overseas and as a writer,<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> he was able to skip the initial officer rank of <a href="/wiki/Ensign_(rank)#United States" id="w">Ensign</a> and was commissioned a <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant%2C_Junior_Grade" id="w">Lieutenant, Junior Grade</a> for service in the <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Intelligence" id="w">Office of Naval Intelligence</a>. He was unsuccessful there, and after some difficulty with other assignments found himself in charge of a 173-foot submarine chaser.<sup id="_ref-navsource_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-navsource" title="">[46]</a></sup> In May 1943, while taking the <a href="/wiki/USS_PC-815" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;PC-815&#39;&#39;</a> on her <a href="/wiki/Shakedown_cruise" id="w">shakedown cruise</a> to San Diego, Hubbard attacked what he believed to be two enemy submarines, ten miles off the coast of Oregon.

He further erred by conducting gunnery practice there.  An official complaint from Mexican authorities, coupled with his failure to return to base as ordered, led to a Board of Investigation.

While convalescing after the war, Hubbard met <a href="/wiki/Jack_Parsons" id="w">Jack Parsons</a>, an aeronautics professor at <a href="/wiki/Caltech" id="w">Caltech</a> and an associate of the British <a href="/wiki/Occultist" id="w">occultist</a> <a href="/wiki/Aleister_Crowley" id="w">Aleister Crowley</a>.<sup id="_ref-strange_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-strange" title="">[48]</a></sup> Hubbard and Parsons were allegedly engaged in the practice of ritual <a href="/wiki/Magick" id="w">magick</a> in 1946, including an extended set of sex magic rituals called the <a href="/wiki/Babalon_Working" id="w">Babalon Working</a>, intended to summon a goddess or &#34;moonchild.&#34; The Church says Hubbard was a working as an <a href="/wiki/ONI" id="w">ONI</a> agent on a mission to end Parsons&#39; supposed magical activities and to &#34;rescue&#34; a girl Parsons was &#34;using&#34; for supposedly magical purposes. In a 1952 lecture series, Hubbard recommended a book of Crowley&#39;s and referred to him as &#34;Mad Old Boy&#34;<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> and as &#34;my very good friend&#34;.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> Hubbard later married the girl he said that he rescued from Parsons, <a href="/wiki/Sara_Northrup" id="w">Sara Northrup</a>.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> Hubbard also described Parsons as his friend in his Scientology lectures rather than a person he was investigating.

<p>Hubbard returned to writing fiction briefly for a few years, his best-remembered work from this period being the <i><a href="/wiki/Ole_Doc_Methuselah" id="w">Ole Doc Methuselah</a></i> series for Campbell&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Astounding_Science_Fiction" id="w">Astounding Science Fiction</a></i> magazine. It was in the pages of this magazine that the first article on Dianetics appeared; while some fiction works appeared after that (including &#34;Masters of Sleep,&#34; which promotes Dianetics and features as a villain &#34;a mad psychiatrist, Doctor Dyhard, who persists in rejecting Dianetics after all his abler colleagues have accepted it {{interp}} believes in prefrontal lobotomies for everyone&#34;)<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> most of Hubbard&#39;s output thereafter was related to Dianetics or Scientology.  Hubbard did not make a major return to non-Dianetics fiction until the 1980s.</p>
<p>In 1948 Hubbard was working as a &#34;Special Officer&#34; for the Metropolitan Detective Agency, licensed by the Los Angeles Police Department. According to Scientology, he performed the duties of an armed security guard:<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> &#34;The guarding of particular properties, e.g., banks and warehouses, and the patrolling of a general neighborhood on behalf of local merchants.

<a id="Dianetics" name="Dianetics"></a><h2>Dianetics</h2>
<p>{{main}}
Beginning in late 1949, Hubbard sought to publicize <a href="/wiki/Dianetics" id="w">Dianetics</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Self-help" id="w">self-improvement</a> technique. Unable to elicit interest from mainstream publishers or medical professionals,<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> Hubbard turned to the legendary 
science fiction editor <a href="/wiki/John_W._Campbell" id="w">John W. Campbell</a>, who had for years published Hubbard&#39;s science fiction. The first article on Dianetics was published in <i><a href="/wiki/Astounding_Science_Fiction" id="w">Astounding Science Fiction</a></i>.  The science fiction community was divided about the merits of Hubbard&#39;s offering. Campbell&#39;s star author <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" id="w">Isaac Asimov</a> criticized Dianetics&#39; unscientific aspects, and veteran author <a href="/wiki/Jack_Williamson" id="w">Jack Williamson</a> described Dianetics as &#34;a lunatic revision of <a href="/wiki/Freudian" id="w">Freudian</a> psychology&#34; that &#34;had the look of a wonderfully rewarding scam.&#34; But Campbell and novelist <a href="/wiki/A._E._van_Vogt" id="w">A. E. van Vogt</a> enthusiastically embraced Dianetics: Campbell became Hubbard&#39;s treasurer, and van Vogt—convinced his wife&#39;s health had been transformed for the better by <a href="/wiki/Auditing_(Scientology)" id="w">auditing</a>—interrupted his writing career to run the first Los Angeles Dianetics center.<sup id="_ref-Bare-faced_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bare-faced" title="">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In April 1950, Hubbard and several others established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Elizabeth, New Jersey</a> to coordinate work related for the forthcoming publication of a book on Dianetics. The book, entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Dianetics:_The_Modern_Science_of_Mental_Health" id="w">Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health</a></i>, was published in May 1950 by <a href="/wiki/Hermitage_House" id="w">Hermitage House</a>, whose head was also on the Board of Directors of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation.<sup id="_ref-Blue Sky_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blue Sky" title="">[9]</a></sup> With <i>Dianetics,</i> Hubbard introduced the concept of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Auditing_(Scientology)" id="w">auditing</a>,&#34; a two-person question-and-answer therapy that focused on painful memories. According to Hubbard, dianetic auditing could eliminate emotional problems, cure physical illnesses, and increase intelligence. In his introduction to <i>Dianetics</i>, Hubbard declared that &#34;the creation of dianetics is a milestone for man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his inventions of the wheel and arch.&#34;</p>
<p><i>Dianetics</i> sold 150,000 copies within a year of publication.<sup id="_ref-Blue Sky_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blue Sky" title="">[9]</a></sup> Upon becoming more widely available, Dianetics became an object of critical scrutiny by the press and the medical establishment. In September 1950, <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">The New York Times</a></i> published a cautionary statement on the topic by the <a href="/wiki/American_Psychological_Association" id="w">American Psychological Association</a> that read in part, &#34;the association calls attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by empirical evidence,&#34; and went on to recommend against use of &#34;the techniques peculiar to Dianetics&#34; until such time it had been validated by scientific testing. <i><a href="/wiki/Consumer_Reports" id="w">Consumer Reports</a>,</i> in an August 1951 assessment of Dianetics,<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> dryly noted &#34;one looks in vain in <i>Dianetics</i> for the modesty usually associated with announcement of a medical or scientific discovery,&#34; and stated that the book had become &#34;the basis for a new cult.&#34; The article observed &#34;in a study of L. Ron Hubbard&#39;s text, one is impressed from the very beginning by a tendency to generalization and authoritative declarations unsupported by evidence or facts.&#34; <i>Consumer Reports</i> warned its readers against the &#34;possibility of serious harm resulting from the abuse of intimacies and confidences associated with the relationship between auditor and patient,&#34; an especially serious risk, they concluded, &#34;in a cult without professional traditions.&#34;</p>
<p>The Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation was incorporated in <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Elizabeth, New Jersey</a>. Branch offices were opened in five other US cities before the end of 1950 (though most folded within a year). Hubbard soon abandoned the Foundation, denouncing a number of his former associates as <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">communists</a> to the <a href="/wiki/FBI" id="w">FBI</a>.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>

In mid-1952, Hubbard expanded Dianetics into an &#34;applied religious philosophy&#34; which he called <a href="/wiki/Scientology" id="w">Scientology</a>. That year, Hubbard also married his third wife, <a href="/wiki/Mary_Sue_Whipp" id="w">Mary Sue Whipp</a>, to whom he remained married until his death (though separated by the early 70s). With Mary Sue, Hubbard fathered four more children—Diana, <a href="/wiki/Quentin_Hubbard" id="w">Quentin</a>, Suzette and Arthur—over the next six years.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Quentin_Hubbard" id="w">Quentin Hubbard</a>, born in 1954, was groomed to one day replace him as head of the Scientology organization.<sup id="_ref-Blue Sky_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blue Sky" title="">[9]</a></sup> Quentin was uninterested in his father&#39;s plans and had preferred to become a pilot. He was also deeply depressed, allegedly because he was homosexual and Hubbard was <a href="/wiki/Homophobic" id="w">homophobic</a>.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> Quentin attempted suicide in 1974, then in 1976 died under circumstances that might have been a suicide or murder.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>On February 10, 1953 Hubbard was awarded an <a href="/wiki/Honoris_causa" id="w">honorary</a> <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy" id="w">Ph.D.</a> by <a href="/wiki/Sequoia_University" id="w">Sequoia University</a>, California, &#34;in recognition of his outstanding work and contributions in the fields of Dianetics and Scientology.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Now Religion_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Now Religion" title="">[68]</a></sup> (This non-accredited body was closed by the California state courts some 30 years later <sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> after it was investigated by California authorities on the grounds of being a mail-order &#34;<a href="/wiki/Degree_mill" id="w">degree mill</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup>) In December of that year, Hubbard declared Scientology a religion and the first <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Scientology" id="w">Church of Scientology</a> was founded in <a href="/wiki/Camden%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Camden, New Jersey</a>. He moved to <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> at about the same time, and during the remainder of the 1950s he supervised the growing organization from an office in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>. In 1959, he bought <a href="/wiki/Saint_Hill_Manor" id="w">Saint Hill Manor</a> near the <a href="/wiki/Sussex%2C_England" id="w">Sussex</a> town of <a href="/wiki/East_Grinstead" id="w">East Grinstead</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Georgian_architecture" id="w">Georgian</a> manor house owned by the <a href="/wiki/Maharajah" id="w">Maharajah</a> of <a href="/wiki/Jaipur" id="w">Jaipur</a>. This became the world headquarters of Scientology. Hubbard says he conducted years of intensive research into the nature of human existence; to describe his findings, he developed an elaborate vocabulary with many newly coined terms.<sup id="_ref-glossary_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-glossary" title="">[71]</a></sup> He codified a set of <a href="/wiki/Scientology_0-8:_The_Book_of_Basics" id="w">Scientology axioms</a> and an &#34;applied religious philosophy&#34; that promised to improve the condition of the human <a href="/wiki/Spirit" id="w">spirit</a>, which he called the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Thetan" id="w">Thetan</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> The bulk of Scientology focuses on the &#34;rehabilitation&#34; of the thetan.</p>
<p>Hubbard&#39;s followers believed his &#34;technology&#34; gave them access to their past lives, the traumas of which led to failures in the present unless they were audited. By this time, Hubbard had introduced a biofeedback device to the auditing process, which he called a &#34;Hubbard Electropsychometer&#34; or &#34;<a href="/wiki/E-meter" id="w">E-meter</a>.&#34; It was invented in the 1940s by a <a href="/wiki/Chiropractor" id="w">chiropractor</a> and Dianetics enthusiast named <a href="/wiki/Volney_Mathison" id="w">Volney Mathison</a>. This machine is used by Scientologists in auditing to evaluate &#34;mental masses&#34; surrounding the thetan. These &#34;masses&#34; are said to impede the thetan from realizing its full potential.</p>
<p>Hubbard also said a good deal of physical disease was <a href="/wiki/Psychosomatic" id="w">psychosomatic</a>, and one who, like himself, had attained the enlightened state of &#34;clear&#34; and become an &#34;<a href="/wiki/Operating_Thetan" id="w">Operating Thetan</a>&#34; would be relatively disease free. According to biographers, Hubbard went to great lengths to suppress his recourse to modern medicine, attributing symptoms to attacks by malicious forces, both spiritual and earthly. Hubbard insisted humanity was imperiled by such forces, which were the result of negative memories (or &#34;engrams&#34;) stored in the unconscious or &#34;reactive&#34; mind, some carried by the immortal thetans for billions of years. Thus, Hubbard asserts, the only possibility for spiritual salvation was a concerted effort to &#34;clear the planet,&#34; that is, to bring the benefits of Scientology to all people everywhere, and attack all forces, social and spiritual, hostile to the interests of the movement.</p>
<p>Church members were expected to pay fixed donation rates for courses, auditing, books and E-meters, all of which proved very lucrative for the Church, which paid <a href="/wiki/Emolument" id="w">emoluments</a> directly to Hubbard and his family.<sup id="_ref-Blue Sky_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blue Sky" title="">[9]</a></sup> In a case fought by the Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.C. over its tax-exempt status (revoked in 1958 because of these emoluments) the findings of fact in the case included that Hubbard had personally received over $108,000 from the Church and affiliates over a four-year period, over and above the percentage of <a href="/wiki/Gross_income" id="w">gross income</a> (usually 10%) he received from Church-affiliated organizations.<sup id="_ref-Foster Report_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Foster Report" title="">[73]</a></sup> However, Hubbard denied such emoluments many times in writing, proclaiming he never received any money from the Church.<sup id="_ref-Blue Sky_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blue Sky" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>L. Ron Hubbard&#39;s philosophy, Scientology, and the Church of Scientology that he founded are controversial. Some documents written by Hubbard himself suggest he regarded Scientology as a business, not a religion. In one letter dated <a href="/wiki/April_10" id="w">April 10</a> <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>, he says calling Scientology a religion solves &#34;a problem of practical business,&#34; and status as a religion achieves something &#34;more equitable...with what we&#39;ve got to sell.&#34; In a 1962 official policy letter, he said &#34;Scientology 1970 is being planned on a religious organization basis throughout the world. This will not upset in any way the usual activities of any organization. It is entirely a matter for accountants and solicitors.&#34;<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> A Reader&#39;s Digest article of May 1980 quoted Hubbard as saying in the 1940s &#34;Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really wants to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion.&#34;<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to <i>The Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction</i>, ed. Brian Ash, Harmony Books, 1977: &#34;... [Hubbard] began making statements to the effect that any writer who really wished to make money should stop writing and develop [a] religion, or devise a new psychiatric method. <a href="/wiki/Harlan_Ellison" id="w">Harlan Ellison</a>&#39;s version (<i>Time Out</i>, UK, No 332) is that Hubbard is reputed to have told <a href="/wiki/John_W._Campbell" id="w">{{interpolation}} Campbell</a>, &#39;I&#39;m going to invent a religion that&#39;s going to make me a fortune. I&#39;m tired of writing for a penny a word.&#39; <a href="/wiki/Sam_Moskowitz" id="w">Sam Moskowitz</a>, a chronicler of science fiction, has reported that he himself heard Hubbard make a similar statement, but there is no first-hand evidence.&#34; Though Hubbard himself was also quoted driving his people toward financial results. For example, in one of his bulletins to officials Hubbard implored:{{quotation}}</p>

In 1967, L.

<p>In 1978, as part of a case against three French Scientologists, Hubbard was convicted of &#34;making fraudulent promises&#34; and given a four year prison sentence and a 35,000₣ fine by a French court.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> Hubbard was not in the country at the time of the trial, and didn&#39;t retain legal assistance. The case was subsequently appealed by one of the other convicts in 1980. Fraud charges against the appellant were dropped, and Scientology was recognized as a religion by the court.{{Fact}} During this appeal, the court indicated that all those who had been convicted could be pardoned, if they filed their own appeals against the original ruling. A second defendant did in 1981, and the fraud charges were canceled by judgment on November 9, 1981. Hubbard himself never took any action, and the fine was never enforced.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Hubbard&#39;s refusal to speak with British immigration officials about this conviction is said to have later caused the British <a href="/wiki/Home_Office" id="w">Home Office</a> to re-affirm an earlier decision to bar him from the UK.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> In 1989 however the then Home Office Minister of State, <a href="/wiki/Tim_Renton%2C_Baron_Renton_of_Mount_Harry" id="w">Tim Renton</a>, confirmed in writing that from 1980 until the date of his death, Hubbard had been free to apply for entry to the United Kingdom under the ordinary immigration rules and that any ban had been lifted on 16 July 1980.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup></p>
<p>The accuracy of Hubbard&#39;s self-representations were challenged in court during a 1984 custody case of a Scientologist and his former wife about two of their children. The judgment of the <a href="/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice" id="w">High court</a> of London (Family Division) quotes the single judge, Latey, that Scientology is &#34;dangerous, immoral, sinister and corrupt&#34; and &#34;has its real objective money and power for Mr. Hubbard.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Blue Sky_s" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blue Sky" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 1965 <a href="/wiki/Anderson_Report" id="w">Anderson Report</a>, an inquiry on Hubbard and Scientology held in Australia, presented Hubbard as a man who made &#34;pretentious and completely misleading pronouncements on scientific matters of which he is ignorant&#34; based on knowledge that was &#34;fragmentary and inaccurate and sometimes positively incorrect.&#34;</p>
<p /><blockquote><tt>All that he writes and says is either accepted by his followers or, at the very least, it is not rejected. They are taught that they are entitled to question his pronouncements, but they are conditioned to the belief that whatever he says is right.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup></tt> </blockquote> A later finding in the report addresses his assertion of medical knowledge and ability by saying:<blockquote><tt>Hubbard&#39;s claims to have found the only known cure for atomic radiation effects is not only unsubstantiated, but, in view of its obvious military value, hardly likely to have been left uninvestigated by military authorities if it was of any value whatever.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup></tt></blockquote>

<p>&#34;<a href="/wiki/Fair_Game_(Scientology)" id="w">Fair Game</a>&#34; was introduced by Hubbard as a policy against people or groups that &#34;actively seeks to suppress or damage Scientology or a Scientologist by Suppressive Acts.&#34; He defined it as: <i>ENEMY — SP Order. Fair game. May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed</i>.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hubbard revised this definition to a milder wording in July 1968,<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup> and the use of the term &#34;Fair Game&#34; was canceled altogether in October 1968, with Hubbard stating that {{quotation}} Hubbard later explained that: {{quotation}}While the number of incidents involving so-called dirty tricks or unethical actions dropped in the years that followed,<sup id="_ref-JGM36_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JGM36" title="">[93]</a></sup> several judges and juries have through their decisions or comments asserted that the tactics continued beyond Hubbard&#39;s order canceling use of the term Fair Game in 1968. <sup id="_ref-Offensive5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Offensive5" title="">[94]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>In the mid-1970s Hubbard decided to end his life at sea and covertly returned to the United States, living for a while in <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>.<sup id="_ref-Blue Sky_t" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blue Sky" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>During the 1980s, Hubbard returned to science fiction, publishing 
<i><a href="/wiki/Battlefield_Earth_(novel)" id="w">Battlefield Earth</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Mission_Earth_(novel)" id="w">Mission Earth</a></i>, the latter being an enormous book, published as a ten volume series.

<p>The Church of Scientology announced Hubbard had deliberately <a href="/wiki/Scientology_and_sex#MEST and meat" id="w">discarded his body</a> to do &#34;higher level spiritual research,&#34; unencumbered by mortal confines, and was now living &#34;on a planet a galaxy away.&#34;<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup> In May 1987, <a href="/wiki/David_Miscavige" id="w">David Miscavige</a>, one of Hubbard&#39;s former personal assistants, assumed the position of Chairman of the <a href="/wiki/Religious_Technology_Center" id="w">Religious Technology Center</a> (RTC), a corporation that owns the trademarked names and symbols of Dianetics and Scientology. Although Religious Technology Center is a separate corporation from the Church of Scientology International, Miscavige is also the <a href="/wiki/Ecclesiology" id="w">ecclesiastical</a> leader of the religion.<sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Heber_Jentzsch" id="w">Heber Jentzsch</a> is the President of Church of Scientology International.<sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[106]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Personality" name="Personality"></a><h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Publicly, Hubbard was sociable and charming.<sup id="_ref-SHRINKING_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SHRINKING" title="">[107]</a></sup> Privately, he wrote entries in his notebook like &#34;All men are your slaves,&#34; and &#34;You can be merciless whenever your will is crossed and you have the right to be merciless.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MBTR_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup> After a 1940 sailing trip that ended with engine trouble on his yacht, he began a three-month stay in <a href="/wiki/Ketchikan%2C_Alaska" id="w">Ketchikan, Alaska</a>. Hubbard worked as the host of a popular maritime radio show where he was known as a &#34;charismatic storyteller&#34;. He also incurred a debt from First National Bank in the amount of $350 which was not repaid.<sup id="_ref-ketchikan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ketchikan" title="">[108]</a></sup>. Hubbard was also apparently interested in and talented at <a href="/wiki/Hypnosis" id="w">hypnosis</a><sup id="_ref-MBTR_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ketchikan_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ketchikan" title="">[108]</a></sup>. In a 1948 demonstration for a gathering of science fiction buffs in Los Angeles, Hubbard successfully convinced one person he was cradling a baby kangaroo<sup id="_ref-MBTR_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But during this same period, Hubbard was financially destitute<sup id="_ref-MBTR_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup>, and suffered from feelings of depression as well as suicidal thoughts, according to a letter he wrote in 1947 requesting assistance from Veterans Affairs<sup id="_ref-Time2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Time2" title="">[109]</a></sup>. {{quotation}} </p>
<p>Hubbard was prone to self-aggrandizement and exaggeration<sup id="_ref-ketchikan_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ketchikan" title="">[108]</a></sup>, and in 1938, he wrote a letter to then-wife Margaret &#34;Polly&#34; Grubb reading, &#34;I have high hopes of smashing my name into history so violently that it will take a legendary form, even if all the books are destroyed. That goal is the real goal as far as I am concerned.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MBTR_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup> In 1984, during the Church of Scientology&#39;s lawsuit against <a href="/wiki/Gerry_Armstrong" id="w">Gerry Armstrong</a>, Judge Paul G. Breckenridge Jr. described Hubbard as &#34;charismatic and highly capable of motivating, organizing, controlling, manipulating and inspiring his adherents.&#34; However, the judge ruled against the Church, and in so doing said, &#34;The evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history, background and achievements.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MBTR_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hubbard was regarded as abusive by some family members and former associates. He married his second wife, Sara Northrup, on Aug. 10, 1946, without revealing his existing marriage and children<sup id="_ref-MBTR_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-SFGate01_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SFGate01" title="">[55]</a></sup>. This was one reason for her later divorce from Hubbard. During those legal proceedings, Northrup alleged abuse by Hubbard, and produced a letter she received from Margaret &#34;Polly&#34; Grubb during the proceedings recounting her treatment by him<sup id="_ref-MBTR_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup>. It reads, in part, {{cquote}}</p>
<p>And several of those trusted to be near him say Hubbard was prone to emotional fits when he became upset, using insults and obscenities. Former Scientologist Adelle Hartwell once described such an outburst: &#34;I actually saw him take his hat off one day and stomp on it and cry like a baby.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MBTR_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>But the financial windfall that came with the success of Scientology allowed Hubbard to hide this and other aspects of his personality that contrasted with the image of himself currently celebrated by Scientologists<sup id="_ref-MBTR_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup>, who regard Hubbard as &#34;mankind&#39;s greatest friend&#34;<sup id="_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#_note-110" title="">[110]</a></sup>. The few who worked at his side saw personality flaws and quirks not reflected in the staged photographs or in Hubbard&#39;s Church-produced biographies<sup id="_ref-MBTR_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBTR" title="">[21]</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="Writing_career" name="Writing_career"></a><h2> Writing career </h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Hubbard was an unusually prolific author and lecturer. Because the majority of Hubbard&#39;s writings of the 1950s through to the 1970s were aimed exclusively at Scientologists, the Church of Scientology founded its own companies to publish his works - <a href="/wiki/Bridge_Publications" id="w">Bridge Publications</a> for the US and Canadian market and <a href="/wiki/New_Era_Publications" id="w">New Era Publications</a>, based in <a href="/wiki/Denmark" id="w">Denmark</a>, for the rest of the world. New volumes of his transcribed lectures continue to be produced; that series alone will ultimately total a projected 110 large volumes. Hubbard also wrote a number of works of fiction during the 1930s and 1980s, which are published by the Scientology-owned <a href="/wiki/Galaxy_Press" id="w">Galaxy Press</a>. All three of these publishing companies are subordinate to <a href="/wiki/Author_Services_Inc." id="w">Author Services Inc.</a>, another Scientology corporation.</p>
<p>Hubbard was awarded the 1994 <a href="/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize" id="w">Ig Nobel Prize</a> in Literature for &#34;his crackling Good Book, <i>Dianetics,</i> which is highly profitable to mankind – or to a portion thereof.&#34;<sup id="_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#_note-111" title="">[111]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 2006, <a href="/wiki/Guinness_World_Records" id="w">Guinness World Records</a> declared Hubbard the world&#39;s most published and most translated author, having published 1,084 fiction and non-fiction works that have been translated into 71 languages.<sup id="_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#_note-112" title="">[112]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[113]</a></sup></p>
