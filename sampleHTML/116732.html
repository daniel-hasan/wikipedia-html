<p>Taunton&#39;s nicknames are derived from its history.

<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>Taunton was founded in 1637 by <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Pole" id="w">Elizabeth Pole</a>, and officially <a href="/wiki/Incorporation_(municipal_government)" id="w">incorporated</a> as a <a href="/wiki/New_England_town" id="w">town</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_3" id="w">September 3</a> <a href="/wiki/1639" id="w">1639</a>. Most of the town&#39;s settlers were originally from <a href="/wiki/Taunton%2C_England" id="w">Taunton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Somerset" id="w">Somerset</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, which led early settlers to name the settlement after that town. At the time of Taunton&#39;s incorporation, they explained their choice of name as being, <i>in honor and love to our dear native country... and owning it a great mercy of God to bring us to this place, and settling of us, on lands of our own bought with our money in peace, in the midst of the heathen, for a possession for ourselves and for our posterity after us.</i>{{Fact}} Prior to 1640, the Taunton area was called Cohannet. </p>

<p>In October 2005, the nearby <a href="/wiki/Whittenton_Pond_Dam" id="w">Whittenton Pond Dam</a> threatened to fail following a week that brought nine inches of rain to the city.

It is estimated that if the dam had failed, the Mill River would have inundated the downtown area with up to six feet of water. In response, Governor <a href="/wiki/Mitt_Romney" id="w">Mitt Romney</a> ordered an immediate inspection of high-risk dams throughout the Commonwealth.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

The <a href="/wiki/Taunton_Branch_Railroad" id="w">Taunton Railway</a> began in 1838 (201 years after its founding by Elizabeth Pole from Dorchester, The <a href="/wiki/Dorchester_Company" id="w">Dorchester Company</a> started in 1623 as part of the <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Patent" id="w">Sheffield Patent</a> settling at Stage Point, Gloucester, Cape Anne) as the main rail transportation system both industrial and passenger connecting Taunton with points south, east, north, and west including New Bedford and Cape Cod, Fall River and Newport, Somerset and Providence, Attleboro and Providence, Mansfield and Boston, Stoughton and Boston, Raynham Middleborough and Wareham as time went on.  Taunton is the central highway hub of southeastern Massachusetts. Much of the eastern part of the state&#39;s major highways intersect and/or runs through the city, especially at its center. <a href="/wiki/U.S._Highway_44" id="w">US 44</a>, <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Route_138" id="w">MA 138</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Route_140" id="w">MA 140</a> intersect at a square at Taunton&#39;s center, which is called the Taunton Green. MA 140 is also accessible from the eastern neighborhood of the city, popularly referred to as &#34;East Taunton.&#34; Additionally, <a href="/wiki/Route_24_(Massachusetts)" id="w">MA 24</a> and MA 140 intersect near East Taunton, and it is at that junction that Route 140 ceases to be a 2-lane divided freeway from the south and becomes a smaller state highway to the north. <a href="/wiki/Interstate_495_(Massachusetts)" id="w">Interstate 495</a> runs through the northern portion of Taunton, unofficially referred to as &#34;North Taunton&#34;, and parallel to Myles Standish Industrial Park, Taunton&#39;s main industrial park.</p>
<p>Various smaller routes run through other parts of the city. These include a small portion of <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Route_104" id="w">MA 104</a>, close to the Taunton-Raynham city limits, and <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Route_79" id="w">MA 79</a>, close to the Taunton-Berkley-Lakeville (<a href="/wiki/Plymouth_County%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Plymouth County</a>) city-town-county limits. Taunton is the western terminus of MA 104. It merges into US 44 after entering the city. </p>
<p>Several freight rails pass through the city on their way towards Fall River, New Bedford and a link-up with the line in Middleborough. There are plans being worked on to link up parts of this rail with the Stoughton line of the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Transportation_Authority" id="w">MBTA</a> commuter rail system to Boston. The <a href="/wiki/Greater_Attleboro_Taunton_Regional_Transit_Authority" id="w">Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority</a>, or GATRA, provides bus <a href="/wiki/Public_transport" id="w">mass transit</a>.</p>
<p>Taunton also has its own <a href="/wiki/Taunton_Municipal_Airport" id="w">municipal airport</a>, serving mostly smaller craft and occasional commuter jets. The nearest airport with national airline service is at <a href="/wiki/T.F._Green_Airport" id="w">T.F. Green Airport</a> in Rhode Island, and the nearest international service is at <a href="/wiki/Logan_International_Airport" id="w">Logan International Airport</a> in Boston.</p>
