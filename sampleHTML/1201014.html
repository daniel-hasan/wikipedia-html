Smith, the first living Jewish recipient of the Victoria Cross, was also awarded the French <a href="/wiki/Croix_de_Guerre" id="w">Croix de Guerre</a> (with palm) and Russian <a href="/wiki/Cross_of_St._George" id="w">Cross of St. George</a> (4th class).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Born Ishroulch Shmeilowitz (and other renderings), to parents residing in Egypt, Smith travelled to Britain as a child stowaway and first volunteered to serve in the British Army in 1904. He emigrated to Australia after discharge, where he remained until mobilised as a reservist in 1914. As a corporal in the 1st Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, Smith was engaged in the <a href="/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres" id="w">Second Battle of Ypres</a>. On <a href="/wiki/26_April" id="w">26 April</a> 1915, Smith, on his own initiative, recovered wounded soldiers while exposed to sustained fire and attended to them &#34;with the greatest devotion to duty regardless of personal risk&#34;.<sup id="_ref-LG_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LG" title="">[3]</a></sup> His conduct secured a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, which was awarded to Smith in August 1915.<sup id="_ref-LG_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LG" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>After his demobilisation, Smith returned to Australia with his wife and daughter. He became a prominent figure in <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" id="w">Melbourne</a>&#39;s Jewish community, was appointed a <a href="/wiki/Justice_of_the_Peace" id="w">Justice of the Peace</a>, and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the <a href="/wiki/United_Australia_Party" id="w">United Australia Party</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Australian_federal_election%2C_1931" id="w">1931 general election</a>.<sup id="_ref-Times 1931_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Times 1931" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Smith was born in <a href="/wiki/Alexandria" id="w">Alexandria</a>, the son of French citizens Moses and Eva Shmeilowitz, who were of Polish origin.<sup id="_ref-ADB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ADB" title="">[5]</a></sup> His father was employed by the French Consulate-General as a clerk. Aged 11, Smith embarked as a stowaway aboard a vessel proceeding to London. Undaunted by this unfamiliar environment, Smith attended Berner Street School, Commercial Street, and worked as a deliverer in the <a href="/wiki/East_End_of_London" id="w">East End</a>, then an impoverished <a href="/wiki/Ghetto" id="w">ghetto</a> where <a href="/wiki/Yiddish" id="w">Yiddish</a> was the predominant spoken language.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Persecution and extreme deprivation had compelled millions of Eastern European Jews to migrate to Western Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. By the time of Issy Smith&#39;s arrival, Jewish immigration to Britain had peaked and was further curtailed by the enactment of the <a href="/wiki/Aliens_Act_1905" id="w">Aliens Act</a> in 1905.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>He joined the British Army in 1904, becoming a private in the Manchester Regiment. The pseudonym Issy Smith was adopted in the process of enlisting at the behest of a recruiting sergeant. Smith completed his training, serving in <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a> and <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> with the 1st Battalion. He boxed competitively, winning the British Army&#39;s middleweight championship, and played <a href="/wiki/Soccer" id="w">football</a>. While in India, Smith was present at the <a href="/wiki/Delhi_Durbar" id="w">Delhi Durbar</a> parade, in which the 1st Manchesters participated, and thus awarded the Delhi Durbar Medal.<sup id="_ref-ADB_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ADB" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Accepting his discharge in 1912, Smith emigrated to Australia after brief employment in London. He lived in the Melbourne suburb of <a href="/wiki/Ascot_Vale%2C_Victoria" id="w">Ascot Vale</a> while working for the city&#39;s gas company. Retained as a reservist, Smith was mobilised by the British Army after the commencement of hostilities in August 1914. Some sources state that Smith was present at the capture of <a href="/wiki/German_New_Guinea" id="w">German New Guinea</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Naval_and_Military_Expeditionary_Force" id="w">Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force</a>.<sup id="_ref-DNW_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DNW" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

The 1st Manchester Regiment, stationed in India, sailed from <a href="/wiki/Karachi" id="w">Karachi</a> for France on <a href="/wiki/29_August" id="w">29 August</a> 1914 as the constituent British battalion of the Jullundur Brigade, 3rd (<a href="/wiki/Lahore" id="w">Lahore</a>) Indian Division. The battalion disembarked at <a href="/wiki/Marseilles" id="w">Marseilles</a> in late September, but was not deployed to the front until <a href="/wiki/26_October" id="w">26 October</a> 1914, when it occupied trenches east of <a href="/wiki/Festubert" id="w">Festubert</a>.<sup id="_ref-James_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-James" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Actively engaged in the battles of <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Givenchy" id="w">Givenchy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Neuve_Chapelle" id="w">Neuve Chapelle</a>, the 1st Manchesters had incurred hundreds of casualties by the beginning of <a href="/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres" id="w">&#34;Second Ypres&#34;</a> on <a href="/wiki/22_April" id="w">22 April</a> 1915.<sup id="_ref-Mileham_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mileham" title="">[11]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Chemical_warfare" id="w">Chemical warfare</a> first emerged on the Western Front during the German offensive, and Smith himself would be temporarily incapacitated by gas. The 1st Manchesters were involved in an initially successful counter-attack conducted by the Jullundur and Ferozepore brigades on <a href="/wiki/26_April" id="w">26 April</a> 1915, near Wieltje, in conjunction with other  Allied units.<sup id="_ref-Wyrall_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wyrall" title="">[12]</a></sup> Rudimentary forms of protection against the <a href="/wiki/Chlorine_gas" id="w">chlorine gas</a> proved ineffectual, limiting the advance and causing many soldiers to succumb to its effects.<sup id="_ref-Mileham_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mileham" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Wyrall_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wyrall" title="">[12]</a></sup> </p>
<p>During the Allied counter-attack, Smith, of his own volition, ventured towards a German position to attend to a severely wounded soldier. He carried him some {{convert}} to relative safety while exposed to intense German fire. According to the Victoria Cross citation, he brought in &#34;many more wounded men&#34; throughout the day under similarly perilous conditions &#34;regardless of personal risk&#34;.<sup id="_ref-LG_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LG" title="">[3]</a></sup> Recounting his own rescue by Smith to a <a href="/wiki/Daily_Mail" id="w">Daily Mail</a> correspondent, Sergeant Rooke said of the corporal: &#34;He behaved with wonderful coolness and presence of mind the whole time, and no man deserved a Victoria Cross more thoroughly than he did&#34;.<sup id="_ref-DNW_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DNW" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Demobilised after the war, Smith returned to London. As a war hero, he was intermittently invited to social functions.

<p>Despite his fame and popularity, like many former servicemen contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially &#8211; a predicament compounded by illness.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> As a consequence he pawned his medals for <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" id="w">£20</a>, only for them to be recovered by the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Historical_Society_of_England" id="w">Jewish Historical Society</a> on the urging of the wife of Chief Rabbi <a href="/wiki/Joseph_H._Hertz" id="w">Joseph H.
