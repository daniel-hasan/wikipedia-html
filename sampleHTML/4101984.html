<b><i>The Chaser&#39;s War on Everything</i></b> is an Australian <a href="/wiki/Television" id="w">television</a> comedy series broadcast on the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" id="w">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (ABC) television station <a href="/wiki/ABC_TV" id="w">ABC TV</a>. The series is produced by the Australian satirical group, <a href="/wiki/The_Chaser" id="w">The Chaser</a>, consisting of <a href="/wiki/Chris_Taylor_(comedian)" id="w">Chris Taylor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Julian_Morrow" id="w">Julian Morrow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Craig_Reucassel" id="w">Craig Reucassel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Hansen" id="w">Andrew Hansen</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Chas_Licciardello" id="w">Chas Licciardello</a>. Fellow Chaser members <a href="/wiki/Dominic_Knight" id="w">Dominic Knight</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charles_Firth" id="w">Charles Firth</a> are not part of the regular on-screen cast. However, Knight is a writer, and Firth compiled roving reports for the show from the United States, until he left the group to start a satirical newspaper in mid-2007.</p>
<p>The show premiered on <a href="/wiki/17_February" id="w">17 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> and has since produced 50 <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Chaser%26%2339%3Bs_War_on_Everything_episodes" id="w">episodes</a>, broadcast over two seasons between 2006 and 2007. The 2006 season was broadcast at an unstable late timeslot on Friday nights. The 2007 season was broadcast in a more favourable timeslot of Wednesdays at {{nowrap}} for all 24 episodes.<sup id="_ref-primetime_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-primetime" title="">[1]</a></sup> The show will not return in the first half of 2008, and The Chaser are yet to announce if a third season will be made.</p>
<p>The program has often attracted controversy for The Chaser because of the stunts displayed on the show. On <a href="/wiki/14_July" id="w">14 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, Licciardello was charged after a stunt concerning <a href="/wiki/Rugby_league" id="w">rugby league</a> team the <a href="/wiki/Bulldogs_(NRL_team)" id="w">Bulldogs</a>.  Licciardello was again arrested, alongside Morrow and nine crew members, on <a href="/wiki/6_September" id="w">6 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> after <a href="/wiki/The_Chaser_APEC_pranks#Breach of APEC restricted zone" id="w">breaching security</a> at the <a href="/wiki/APEC_Australia_2007" id="w">2007 APEC summit</a>.</p>

<a href="/wiki/The_Chaser" id="w">The Chaser</a> was formed by <a href="/wiki/Dominic_Knight" id="w">Dominic Knight</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Firth" id="w">Charles Firth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Craig_Reucassel" id="w">Craig Reucassel</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Julian_Morrow" id="w">Julian Morrow</a>, and in 1999 ran a fortnightly newspaper entitled <i><a href="/wiki/The_Chaser_(newspaper)" id="w">The Chaser</a></i>.

Through the help of <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Denton" id="w">Andrew Denton</a>, the Chaser team produced various shows for the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" id="w">ABC</a>: most notably <i><a href="/wiki/CNNNN" id="w">CNNNN</a></i>. In 2005, The Chaser began filming a pilot for a new television series for the ABC, with the working title <i>The Age of Terror Variety Hour</i>.<sup id="_ref-gibberish_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gibberish" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Chaser team signed a contract with the ABC to produce 27 half hour episodes for 2006, which would be based on news reviews, studio monologues and confrontations with politicians, celebrities, and business leaders.<sup id="_ref-rejectnames_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rejectnames" title="">[3]</a></sup> The show was to be presented by Morrow, Hansen, Reucassel, Taylor and Licciardello.<sup id="_ref-gibberish_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gibberish" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The ABC rejected the name <i>The Age of Terror Variety Hour</i> and other names including <i>Thank Allah It&#39;s Friday</i>.

The show was to be performed in front of a live audience, in a more relaxed format than <i>CNNNN</i> and other Chaser productions.<sup id="_ref-rejectnames_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rejectnames" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

New segments had been developed and the opening sequence was reworked. The move to prime time resulted in a ratings increase, reaching almost 1.5 million viewers each week. This was despite direct competition against well rated programs on commercial networks.<sup id="_ref-ratings1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ratings1" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ratings2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ratings2" title="">[10]</a></sup> The Chaser finished their 24th and final episode of the show for the 2007 season on <a href="/wiki/November_14" id="w">November 14</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.

<p>After the last episode of <i>The Chaser Decides</i>, The Chaser ruled out doing any television productions in the first half of 2008.

<a id="Primary_segments" name="Primary_segments"></a><h3>Primary segments</h3>

<p>The primary segments form the backbone of the show. These segments normally focus on key issues in a range of topics. They are normally presented by the cast members, live in front of the audience, and may be accompanied with pre-produced stunts and sketches relating to the topics. </p>

The pair discuss the major events of the past week, present their opinions, and show a pre-produced stunt or sketch. On occasion other cast members may join them.

From the beginning of season 2 onwards, the credits of names as displayed during the program have been replaced in various manners.</li></ul>

<li><b>&#34;What Have We Learnt from <a href="/wiki/Current_affairs_(news_format)" id="w">Current Affairs</a> This Week?&#34;</b> – Presented by Hansen and Licciardello, the segment pokes fun at the sensationalism used in competing weeknight current affair programs <i><a href="/wiki/Today_Tonight" id="w">Today Tonight</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/A_Current_Affair" id="w">A Current Affair</a></i>. All segments feature a lesson on their reporting techniques, such as how to spot &#39;dodgy&#39; guys and how to identify the different types of experts Both shows are regularly criticised for their tendency to come to fast and inaccurate conclusions. The tallyboard, featured in Season One, of the different types of stories presented, such as &#34;Menaces To Society&#34;, has been all but abandoned in Season Two.</li></ul>

<a id="Supporting_segments" name="Supporting_segments"></a><h3> Supporting segments </h3>

<ul>
<li><b>&#34;Citizens&#39; Infringement Officer&#34;</b> – Morrow acts as an officer who hands out fake fines on behalf of general citizens.

<ul>
<li><b>&#34;Clive The Slightly-Too-Loud Commuter&#34;</b> – Hansen plays Clive who goes onto <a href="/wiki/Public_transport" id="w">public transport</a> and begins to talk loudly on his <a href="/wiki/Mobile_phone" id="w">mobile phone</a> about very personal or taboo issues.</li></ul>

<li><b>&#34;Anna Coren&#39;s Segue/Meaningless Gibberish of the Week&#34;</b> – Integrated into <b>&#34;What Have We Learnt from Current Affairs This Week?&#34;</b>, this segment looks at either <a href="/wiki/Anna_Coren" id="w">Coren</a>&#39;s extremely complicated transitions between unrelated stories, or the strange and meaningless introductions she says on <i>Today Tonight</i>.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>&#34;Nut Job of the Week&#34;</b> – Licciardello and Taylor take a look at the &#34;special people in our society&#34;; people who have &#34;alternative views&#34;.

<ul>
<li><b>Stunts</b> - A staple of the show, stunts can vary from confronting celebrities or politicians to testing staff reactions in shops and department stores. The stunts must be approved by the ABC Legal Department, to prevent breach of the law. In the 2007 DVD of the first half of the season, it is stated that the basic formula for the stunts is &#34;go in, get our footage and get kicked out&#34;.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Sketches</b> - There are a few stunts performed on the show that are shot in controlled conditions, with either hired actors or by setting up people. The Chaser team refer to these controlled stunts as &#39;sketches&#39;.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Songs</b> – Hansen, or sometimes other members, perform songs with a humorous theme.

Stott&#39;s lawyer said his client felt intimidated by the stunt, and the footage of the stunt was not shown in the first episode as scheduled due to &#34;legal reasons&#34;. In the first episode to go to air, Morrow responded by raising the point that Charles Stott has done business with Saddam Hussein, a brutal dictator, yet he is intimidated by a large novelty cheque. The footage of this stunt does appear as a bonus on the show&#39;s first DVD.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

On the ninth episode of the show, Taylor announced that he planned to break-up with his partner of seven years, but he didn&#39;t want to ask her &#34;the usual boring way&#34;, but do &#34;something special, something she&#39;ll remember&#34;. The segment shows several of Taylor&#39;s attempts to &#34;pop the question&#34;, including hanging a sign over a freeway, and &#34;proposing&#34; on a big screen at an outdoor festival. For the finale, Taylor introduces the interview of him on the morning television program, <i><a href="/wiki/Sunrise_(TV_program)" id="w">Sunrise</a></i>. In the interview, Taylor asks the host if he can send a quick message to his partner, he then proceeds to tell her to &#34;get the fuck out of my life&#34;. This finale from the segment was leaked onto the internet and has been widely distributed by email. Many viewers believed the segment was actually real but Taylor admitted on national radio station <a href="/wiki/Triple_J" id="w">Triple J</a> that it was set up. It was actually filmed after <i>Sunrise</i> went to air, with Channel Seven editing on screen graphics for realism.  The hosts of <i>Sunrise</i> admitted it was a set up. However, they did not know what Taylor was going to say because he only asked if he could do a bit for the show.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<dl><dt>Chas Licciardello&#39;s Bulldogs incident</dt></dl>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/14_July" id="w">14 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, Licciardello was charged with offensive conduct after attempting to sell fake <a href="/wiki/Canterbury_Bulldogs" id="w">Canterbury Bulldogs</a> merchandise outside an <a href="/wiki/National_Rugby_League" id="w">NRL</a> game.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> The merchandise included plastic <a href="/wiki/Knuckledusters" id="w">knuckledusters</a> and <a href="/wiki/Balaclava" id="w">balaclavas</a> in the Bulldogs&#39; colours, and was supposed to satirise the anti-social and hooligan behaviour of some Bulldogs fans. Several Bulldogs fans took offence and as a result he was charged for offensive behaviour.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> On the broadcast following his arrest, Licciardello appeared onstage in handcuffs and within an iron cage. On that same episode, he apologised for his actions, claiming to understand why the Bulldogs fans were offended: because Canterbury Bulldogs fans much prefer to use their fists. This statement was accompanied by footage of Bulldog&#39;s supporters assaulting opposing team supporters during a match. After appearing in court with Morrow, Licciardello pleaded not guilty and the matter was adjourned.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/January_23" id="w">January 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, Licciardello was found <a href="/wiki/Not_guilty" id="w">not guilty</a> of the offensive behaviour charge.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> He was interviewed after the case draped in an <a href="/wiki/Australian_flag" id="w">Australian flag</a>, and said he would appeal &#34;to the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_New_South_Wales" id="w">Supreme Court</a>, to the <a href="/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" id="w">High Court</a>, to the <a href="/wiki/UN" id="w">UN</a>, to the <a href="/wiki/Jedi_Council" id="w">Jedi Council</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Snickometer" id="w">Snickometer</a>.&#34; After being reminded he had won, he said &#34;I didn&#39;t actually prepare any material for the off-chance that we won.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Chaser court victory hailed as triumph for free speech_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chaser court victory hailed as triumph for free speech" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/2_August" id="w">2 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, Reucassel responded to a news story about a private school student who had hugged Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/John_Howard" id="w">John Howard</a> while holding a <a href="/wiki/Screwdriver" id="w">screwdriver</a> during one of the PM&#39;s morning walks.  To test the Prime Minister&#39;s security arrangements, he approached John Howard during a morning walk and asked for a hug while holding a large plastic <a href="/wiki/Battle_axe" id="w">battle axe</a>.  Reucassel did receive the hug, but a later approach while holding a running <a href="/wiki/Chainsaw" id="w">chainsaw</a> was not so successful.  There was much debate surrounding whether or not to turn on the chainsaw and whether they would be shot at for doing this.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Cut out from this segment was an unsuccessful attempt that took place between the axe and the chainsaw, in which Reucassel was holding a four-point-star mace.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<dl><dt>Julian Morrow&#39;s ticket prank</dt></dl>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/16_August" id="w">16 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, Morrow purchased two airline tickets on the <a href="/wiki/Virgin_Blue" id="w">Virgin Blue</a> airline under the names &#34;<a href="/wiki/Al-Qaeda" id="w">Al Kyder</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Terrorist" id="w">Terry Wrist</a>&#34;, checked in using the automated check-in at <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Airport" id="w">Sydney Airport</a>, and then did not show up for boarding, so that the names would be read out in a final boarding call over the public address system. The prank was acknowledged by Virgin Blue who criticised the use of taxpayer dollars in the &#34;childish humour&#34;.<sup id="_ref-virginblue_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-virginblue" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<dl><dt>Craig Reucassel&#39;s speedos</dt></dl>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/19_March" id="w">19 March</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, during a campaign appearance for the <a href="/wiki/New_South_Wales_general_election%2C_2007" id="w">New South Wales State Election</a>, the then <a href="/wiki/Opposition_(Australia)" id="w">opposition leader</a> <a href="/wiki/Peter_Debnam" id="w">Peter Debnam</a> was confronted by Reucassel wearing nothing but <a href="/wiki/Speedos" id="w">Speedos</a> and a baseball cap,<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> making fun of Debnam&#39;s campaign appearances in the swimwear.  When TV cameras remained focused on Reucassel rather than Mr Debnam, he said, &#34;Sorry, I&#39;m not Peter Debnam, he&#39;s over there. Just because I&#39;m wearing this doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m Peter Debnam&#34;.  Reucassel stuck around for the press conference but failed to draw a response from the opposition leader, and was again ignored when he went to shake Mr Debnam&#39;s hand.</p>

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/APEC_Australia_2007" id="w">APEC Leaders Summit</a> in <a href="/wiki/Sydney" id="w">Sydney</a>, on <a href="/wiki/6_September" id="w">6 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, Morrow and Licciardello along with nine other production crew members were arrested after they drove a fake <a href="/wiki/Canadian" id="w">Canadian</a> <a href="/wiki/Motorcade" id="w">motorcade</a> down <a href="/wiki/Macquarie_Street%2C_Sydney" id="w">Macquarie Street</a> and successfully breached the APEC restricted zone.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> Police only realised that the motorcade was a hoax when Licciardello, dressed as <a href="/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden" id="w">Osama bin Laden</a>, stepped out of the car replete with bonnet-mounted Canadian flag and complained in-character about not being invited.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Licciardello, Morrow and the nine crew members were immediately detained by <a href="/wiki/NSW_Police" id="w">NSW Police</a>, questioned and charged with <i>entering a restricted area without special justification</i> under the <i>APEC Meeting (Police Powers) Act 2007</i>.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup>.

<p>The stunt was planned and approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that the motorcade would be stopped and discovered at the first security checkpoint.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> However, they managed to pass through two police security checkpoints, using a fake convoy of hired limousines.<sup id="_ref-AGE-070907_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AGE-070907" title="">[46]</a></sup>  According to Licciardello, he &#34;never intended to get that far&#34; but played along with it to make their stunt better.  The footage of the prank, which was seized by the police, was returned to the ABC and featured in their next episode the following week.</p>
<p>Despite condemnations by various public officials, the Sydney correspondent to the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a> reported that the <i>Chaser</i> team had become &#39;folk heroes&#39; following the stunt.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> Furthermore, 87% of some 28,451 respondents to a web poll conducted by the <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald" id="w">Sydney Morning Herald</a> found the stunt funny.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> Indeed, <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Downer" id="w">Alexander Downer</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" id="w">Minister for Foreign Affairs</a>, appeared amused when asked to comment.<sup id="_ref-AGE-070907_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AGE-070907" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>

<dl><dt>&#34;The Eulogy Song&#34;</dt></dl>
<p>On the <a href="/wiki/17_October" id="w">17 October</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> episode, Hansen sang a song that was written by Taylor which satirised the lives of several deceased celebrities, including <a href="/wiki/Peter_Brock" id="w">Peter Brock</a>, <a href="/wiki/Princess_Diana" id="w">Princess Diana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Donald_Bradman" id="w">Donald Bradman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Steve_Irwin" id="w">Steve Irwin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Buckley" id="w">Jeff Buckley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kerry_Packer" id="w">Kerry Packer</a>, expressing the view that people with flaws during life are often disproportionately hailed as &#34;top blokes&#34; after death. The song became the target of significant media attention, with several radio and television personalities saying the song was in &#34;bad taste&#34;, and both <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Australia" id="w">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Howard" id="w">John Howard</a> and opposition leader <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" id="w">Kevin Rudd</a> expressing negative views. A few days later, the team approached John Howard on his morning walk, dressed as rabbits, and sparked a reaction from the Prime Minister, with him saying: &#34;You blokes are a lot funnier when you pick on someone who&#39;s alive&#34;.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>A number of news programs reported that the ABC&#39;s switchboard was jammed with calls from &#34;disgusted viewers&#34; immediately following the show. It was later revealed that only six calls had been made that night about the show, three of them in a positive light. Although a number of complaints were received the next day the ABC alleged that a large number were listeners of a <a href="/wiki/Neil_Mitchell_(radio_announcer)" id="w">Melbourne radio show</a>, and that when asked many said they hadn&#39;t seen the show. In response some shows such as <i>Today Tonight</i> claimed many more complaints would follow.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>In response to the attention, Taylor supported the message, stating that it was a legitimate skit and that although the song mentioned recently deceased breast cancer victim <a href="/wiki/Belinda_Emmett" id="w">Belinda Emmett</a>, the rest of the cast pretending to cut off Hansen before he completed his verse was &#34;making a joke about the inappropriateness of making a joke about Belinda Emmett.&#34;<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> He also revealed it was a &#34;watered down&#34; version of the song which was previously performed twice on stage in his musical <i>Dead Caesar</i>.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<dl><dt>Seven Network Injunction</dt></dl>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/14_November" id="w">14 November</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, The Chaser made an attempt to poke fun at <i>Today Tonight</i> and the way that they re-enact procedures and events which they base their stories on. As they had done several times before, they infiltrated the Seven Network&#39;s news headquarters at <a href="/wiki/Martin_Place" id="w">Martin Place</a> and requested for the <i>Today Tonight</i> presenter <a href="/wiki/Anna_Coren" id="w">Anna Coren</a>, where they came dressed as pretend cameos for the re-enactment segments. However, within the headquarters, they were confronted by the staff off the building for <a href="/wiki/Trespass" id="w">trespassing</a> and had their footage seized. Both <i>Today Tonight</i> and their rival <i>A Current Affair</i> broadcast reports of the stunt, the <i>Today Tonight</i> broadcast claiming that they had finally caught the Chaser red-handed. However <i>A Current Affair</i> did a relatively lighter report on the incident, seeming to take side with the Chaser. Channel Seven got an injunction to stop The Chaser showing the segment, however, The Chaser plans on challenging the injunction.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> In place of their planned stunt, they shot a &#34;hasty and dubious&#34; reenactment of it. 
Channel 7 boss <a href="/wiki/David_Leckie" id="w">David Leckie</a> exclaimed in an outburst at waiting photographers outside Channel 7&#39;s offices that The Chaser were &#34;...nothing but a bunch of tossers, they&#39;re fucking wankers&#34;<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup>, Morrow responded &#34;I interpret those comments as David making overtures to us. Calling us wankers and tossers must mean he wants [to hire] us&#34;</p>
