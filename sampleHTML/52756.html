As the story progresses, conflicts escalate and the world&#39;s safety becomes a major concern.</p>
<p>A major critical and commercial success, the game remains arguably the most popular title in the series,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-mainstream_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mainstream" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-mainstream2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mainstream2" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-GamespostBestAllTime_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GamespostBestAllTime" title="">[8]</a></sup> and is often credited with allowing console-style RPGs to achieve mainstream success outside <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>.<sup id="_ref-mainstream_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mainstream" title="">[6]</a></sup> The ongoing popularity of the title led Square Enix to produce a series of <a href="/wiki/Sequel" id="w">sequels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prequel" id="w">prequels</a> under the collective title &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII#Related media and merchandise" id="w">Compilation of Final Fantasy VII</a></i>&#34;.

</p>
<p>Like previous installments of the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series, <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> consists of three basic gameplay modes: an <a href="/wiki/Overworld" id="w">overworld</a> map, town and <a href="/wiki/Dungeon_(games)" id="w">dungeon</a> field maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down simplified version of the game&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Fictional_universe" id="w">fictional world</a>,<sup id="_ref-ignreview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignreview" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-travel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-travel" title="">[10]</a></sup> which the player navigates to travel between the game&#39;s locations. It is the first <i>Final Fantasy</i> game to have character models with fully-rendered polygons, rather than flat two-dimensional sprites. As with the preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, by <a href="/wiki/Chocobo" id="w">chocobo</a>, by <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_airships#Final Fantasy VII" id="w">airship</a>, or by other means of transportation.<sup id="_ref-travel_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-travel" title="">[10]</a></sup> On field maps, the game&#39;s 3D <a href="/wiki/Player_character" id="w">playable characters</a> are directed across realistically scaled environments, consisting of <a href="/wiki/2D_computer_graphics" id="w">2D</a> pre-rendered backgrounds that represent locations such as towns or forests.<sup id="_ref-ignreview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignreview" title="">[2]</a></sup> The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area such as a building interior or grassland, in which the player commands the game&#39;s characters in battles against <a href="/wiki/Central_processing_unit" id="w">CPU</a>-controlled enemies through a menu-driven interface.<sup id="_ref-ignreview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignreview" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-menuinterface_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-menuinterface" title="">[11]</a></sup> While characters are miniaturised on maps, in combat their renderings are more realistic and normal-scaled.</p>
<p>Initially, the player is restricted to travel within a single city, but as the game continues, more areas become accessible, and the scripted adventure sequences gradually yield more freedom to explore.<sup id="_ref-travel_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-travel" title="">[10]</a></sup> Progression through the game&#39;s storyline is largely developed by way of scripted sequences, which cannot be skipped, and require frequent player interaction to proceed. At other times, pre-rendered cinematic <a href="/wiki/Cut_scene" id="w">cut scenes</a> advance the story.</p>
<a id="Combat" name="Combat"></a><h2>Combat</h2>
<p>During its turn-based battle sequences, the game uses the same <a href="/wiki/Square_Enix_battle_systems#Active Time Battle" id="w">Active Time Battle</a> (ATB) system designed by <a href="/wiki/Hiroyuki_Ito" id="w">Hiroyuki Ito</a> and first featured in <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV" id="w">Final Fantasy IV</a></i>. Unlike previous games in the series, which allow 4–5 playable characters to participate in battle, <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> allows for only up to three characters to be present in the party at any one time.<sup id="_ref-ignreview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignreview" title="">[2]</a></sup><div style="wigth:250px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:250px-FFVIIbattlexample.jpg" title="A battle in &#39;&#39;Final Fantasy VII&#39;&#39;"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/250px-FFVIIbattlexample.jpg" alt="A battle in &#39;&#39;Final Fantasy VII&#39;&#39;" title="A battle in &#39;&#39;Final Fantasy VII&#39;&#39;" class="location-left type-thumb" width="250px" />

<p><i>Final Fantasy VII</i>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Statistic_(role-playing_games)#Skills" id="w">skill system</a> is built around the use of <a href="/wiki/Materia" id="w">materia</a>, magical orbs that are placed in special slots on weapons and armor, allowing players to customize their characters&#39; access to <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_magic" id="w">magic spells</a>, summons, and special abilities. In addition to their individual traits, materia can be used together in a fixed number of ways to enhance their effects or produce other abilities.<sup id="_ref-materiause_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-materiause" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-materiause2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-materiause2" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

When the bar is completely filled, the character is able to unleash his or her Limit Break, a special attack which generally inflicts significantly more damage on enemies than normal attacks, or otherwise aids the party in battle.<sup id="_ref-ignreview_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ignreview" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-menuinterface_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-menuinterface" title="">[11]</a></sup> Character designer and battle director <a href="/wiki/Tetsuya_Nomura" id="w">Tetsuya Nomura</a> implemented this advanced form of Desperation Attacks in response to the low probability of their occurrence in <i>Final Fantasy VI</i>, where they would randomly become available as an attack substitution only when a character&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Hit_point" id="w">hit points</a> (a numerically based <a href="/wiki/Life_bar" id="w">life bar</a>) were low.<sup id="_ref-Khosla_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Khosla" title="">[14]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>Nomura decided to incorporate elaborately animated <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_magic#Summon Magic" id="w">summon spells</a> in the game, one of which lasts more than a minute.<sup id="_ref-Khosla_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Khosla" title="">[14]</a></sup> This idea became popular with <i>Final Fantasy</i> fans, and they were incorporated into the development of future games in the series.<sup id="_ref-Khosla_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Khosla" title="">[14]</a></sup> However, critics have described these animations as tedious.<sup id="_ref-summons_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-summons" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

The game&#39;s setting follows in the footsteps of <i>Final Fantasy VI</i> by presenting a world with considerably more advanced technology than the first five games in the series. Overall, the game&#39;s technology and society approximates that of modern or near-future <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a>.<sup id="_ref-scifisetting_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scifisetting" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-scifi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scifi" title="">[17]</a></sup> The world of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>, retroactively named &#34;Gaia&#34;<sup id="_ref-gaia_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gaia" title="">[18]</a></sup> but referred to in the game as The Planet, is composed of three land masses. The <a href="/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_locations#Eastern continent" id="w">eastern continent</a> features the city of <a href="/wiki/Midgar" id="w">Midgar</a>, an industrial <a href="/wiki/Metropolis" id="w">metropolis</a> that serves as the headquarters of the <a href="/wiki/Shinra" id="w">Shinra Electric Power Company</a>, a ruthless mega corporation that operates as the <a href="/wiki/De_facto" id="w">de facto</a> <a href="/wiki/World_government" id="w">world government</a>. Shinra&#39;s major military base, Junon, is also located on the continent, along with a chocobo ranch and a small town called Kalm.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_locations#Western continent" id="w">western continent</a> features most of the playable areas, which include the Gold Saucer(an amusement park), a seaside resort, and a settlement constructed on a plateau called &#34;Cosmo Canyon&#34;. The tribe inhabiting the canyon places a strong emphasis on living in harmony with nature and dedicate great consideration to the planet&#39;s well-being.<sup id="_ref-cosmo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cosmo" title="">[19]</a></sup> Their settlement features an <a href="/wiki/Observatory" id="w">observatory</a> and serves as a research facility for those who wish to participate in a philosophy known as &#34;the Study of Planet Life&#34;, an environmentally conscious way of life that encourages utmost deference for nature, and teaches that the planet has a life of its own.<sup id="_ref-cosmo_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cosmo" title="">[19]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_locations#Northern continent" id="w">northernmost continent</a> is a heavily <a href="/wiki/Glacier" id="w">glaciated</a> wasteland covered in snow and ice, with its few settlements largely concerned with excavation or research.

<p>All of the game&#39;s main characters have had significant ties to the Shinra Company in their past, and all harbor disapproval or outright hatred for the corporation and its activities. Although the antagonists for the first portion of the game are the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_characters#Executives" id="w">Shinra executives</a>, a mysterious man named &#34;<a href="/wiki/Sephiroth_(Final_Fantasy)" id="w">Sephiroth</a>&#34; — once hailed as the greatest SOLDIER — reappears several years after disappearing in a battle in which he was concluded to have died.<sup id="_ref-sephiroth_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sephiroth" title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-sephiroth2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sephiroth2" title="">[33]</a></sup> He is soon revealed to be the most immediate threat to the planet, prompting both AVALANCHE and the Shinra Company to take up the position of defending it, though their methods differ significantly.<sup id="_ref-defendingtheplanet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-defendingtheplanet" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>The game&#39;s character designer, Tetsuya Nomura, has expressed feeling that <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> was hindered by graphical limitations, and that his designs were, consequently, very plain in comparison to his &#34;true&#34; style.<sup id="_ref-Khosla_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Khosla" title="">[14]</a></sup> However, he was able to find other means of expressing some of his ideas. Cloud&#39;s original character design called for slicked back black hair with no spikes, intended to serve as a contrast to Sephiroth&#39;s long, flowing silver hair. To give Cloud a unique feature that would emphasize his role in the game as the main character, Nomura changed the design to feature Cloud&#39;s now trademark shock of spiky, bright blond hair.<sup id="_ref-Khosla_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Khosla" title="">[14]</a></sup> For Tifa&#39;s design, Nomura has admitted to facing a difficult decision in choosing to give her a miniskirt or pants. With input from other members of the game&#39;s development staff, he eventually selected a dark miniskirt, contrasted by Aeris&#39; long, pink dress.<sup id="_ref-Khosla_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Khosla" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Vincent&#39;s character developed from horror researcher to detective, then to chemist, and finally to the figure of a former Turk with a tragic past. It has been explained that his crimson mantle was added to symbolize the idea of carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders associated with death. Nomura has indicated that Cid Highwind&#39;s fighting style resembles that of a <a href="/wiki/Dragon_Knight_(character_class)" id="w">Dragon Knight</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Character_class" id="w">character class</a> so chosen because his last name is the same as that of two previous Dragon Knights featured in the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series, <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Final_Fantasy_II#Ricard Highwind" id="w">Ricard Highwind</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_II" id="w">Final Fantasy II</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Kain_Highwind" id="w">Kain Highwind</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV" id="w">Final Fantasy IV</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Khosla_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Khosla" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Story" name="Story"></a><h2>Story</h2>
<p><i>Final Fantasy VII</i> begins with Cloud joining <a href="/wiki/AVALANCHE" id="w">AVALANCHE</a> in a raid on one of eight Mako reactors that surround the city of Midgar. The Mako reactor is destroyed and the group makes their way back to their base. During their next mission at another reactor, AVALANCHE is trapped by <a href="/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_characters#President Shinra" id="w">President Shinra</a> before they can escape. Although they defeat the Shinra&#39;s machine, the reactor&#39;s explosion sends Cloud flying from the upper levels of Midgar into the slums below. Falling through the roof of a derelict church in Sector 5, he lands on a flower bed unharmed, where he is formally introduced to Aeris.<sup id="_ref-secondmeetingwithaeris_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-secondmeetingwithaeris" title="">[37]</a></sup> Cloud agrees to work for Aeris as her bodyguard, an agreement prompted by the arrival of operatives of the Shinra Company&#39;s Turks organization, who have been ordered to capture Aeris.<sup id="_ref-secondmeetingwithaerith_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-secondmeetingwithaerith" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Cloud defends Aeris from her would-be kidnappers, Aeris offers to show him the way back to Sector 7. Along the way, she reveals that her first boyfriend had been a 1<sup>st</sup> Class SOLDIER, as Cloud claims to have been. The two spot Tifa entering Wall Market, an area of Sector 6 infamous for criminal activity, to which they follow her. After infiltrating the mansion of crime boss <a href="/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_characters#Don Corneo" id="w">Don Corneo</a>, the three learn that Shinra has discovered the location of AVALANCHE&#39;s hideout and plans to collapse the upper level of Sector 7 onto the slums below.<sup id="_ref-platecrush_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-platecrush" title="">[39]</a></sup> Despite AVALANCHE&#39;s efforts to prevent it, Shinra successfully destroys Sector 7, killing its population and three members of AVALANCHE. The Turks finally capture Aeris, who the player learns is the last living member of the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Races_of_Final_Fantasy#Ancients" id="w">Cetra</a>&#34; race.<sup id="_ref-cetra_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cetra" title="">[40]</a></sup> The Cetra, it is explained, are closely attuned with the planet. Therefore, President Shinra believes that Aeris can lead him to a mythical land of fertility known as the &#34;Promised Land&#34;, which he expects to be ripe with Mako energy that can be easily harvested.<sup id="_ref-cetra2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cetra2" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the only remaining members of AVALANCHE, Tifa, Barret and Cloud infiltrate Shinra&#39;s headquarters to rescue Aeris. After freeing her and Red XIII, who joins the party, they escape when most of the personnel in the building — including President Shinra — are killed. Finding the body of the president skewered by a long sword, Cloud suspects a man called Sephiroth who has returned from his presumed death. These suspicions are confirmed by an executive spared during the massacre, who claims to have witnessed Sephiroth murder the president and state that he would never allow Shinra to claim the Promised Land.<sup id="_ref-sephirothreturns_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sephirothreturns" title="">[42]</a></sup> The party also learns that during Sephiroth&#39;s attack on Shinra, the headless body of a creature named &#34;<a href="/wiki/Jenova" id="w">Jenova</a>&#34; disappeared from the building&#39;s research facility.<sup id="_ref-jenovagone_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jenovagone" title="">[43]</a></sup> </p>
<p>While <a href="/wiki/Rufus_Shinra" id="w">Rufus Shinra</a>, the president&#39;s son, assumes control of the Shinra Company, AVALANCHE pursues Sephiroth across the planet, fearing his intentions for the Promised Land may be more destructive than Shinra&#39;s. During this pursuit, the party is joined by Yuffie, Cait Sith, Vincent and Cid. As the journey progresses, each member of the group must come to terms with personal conflicts from their past, and the full scope of Sephiroth&#39;s plan is eventually revealed to the player: if the planet is significantly damaged, the Lifestream within will gather at the point of injury, attempting to heal the wound. Sephiroth explains that he intends to use a powerful spell known as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Materia#Meteor" id="w">Meteor</a>&#34; to fatally injure the planet, inciting a reaction in the Lifestream to heal the wound before it can cause the planet&#39;s destruction. Entering the fissure created by the meteor&#39;s impact, Sephiroth would merge with all the energy of the planet, granting him god-like power over it.<sup id="_ref-agodtorule_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-agodtorule" title="">[44]</a></sup> At an ancient temple erected by the Cetra, AVALANCHE attempts to undermine Sephiroth&#39;s plot by claiming the <a href="/wiki/Materia#Black materia" id="w">Black Materia</a> needed to activate Meteor, but Sephiroth displays a mysterious power over Cloud, forcing him to relinquish it.</p>

Fearing that Sephiroth may cast Meteor, and having gained a greater understanding of her heritage from scholars in Cosmo Canyon and the memories of her ancestors in the Cetra&#39;s temple, Aeris sets off to stop him on her own. Concerned for her safety, AVALANCHE follows her to the northern continent, where the player must enter an ancient Cetra city. After finding Aeris praying to the planet for aid, Sephiroth, unseen, begins affecting Cloud&#39;s behavior once again, and attempts to force him to kill her. Cloud resists Sephiroth&#39;s command, but Sephiroth himself appears and kills Aeris.<sup id="_ref-sephboss1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sephboss1" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-development3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-development3" title="">[46]</a></sup> After laying her body to rest, the surviving characters resolve to defeat Sephiroth and avenge her.</p>
<p>Later, Sephiroth begins causing Cloud to doubt his memories and insists that he is not a real human, but rather a specimen created from Jenova&#39;s genetic material by <a href="/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_characters#Professor Hojo" id="w">Professor Hojo</a>. Jenova, the player learns, was an interstellar creature who crashlanded on the planet approximately two thousand years earlier, arriving via travel on a meteor. This collision formed a large <a href="/wiki/Impact_crater" id="w">impact crater</a>, grievously harming the planet.<sup id="_ref-meteor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-meteor" title="">[47]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-meteor2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-meteor2" title="">[48]</a></sup> Jenova soon emerged from the crater, intending to infect all living organisms on the planet with a virus that would induce insanity and incite monstrous transformations.<sup id="_ref-jenova_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jenova" title="">[49]</a></sup> Among its victims were most of the Cetra, who were approached when Jenova used its <a href="/wiki/Mimic" id="w">mimic</a> abilities to appear as their relatives. Attempting to defend itself, the planet created giant monsters called &#34;<a href="/wiki/WEAPON_(Final_Fantasy)#Final Fantasy VII" id="w">WEAPONs</a>&#34;, while the majority of humans fled rather than fight Jenova. However, a small group of Cetra survivors fought to defend the planet and managed to defeat Jenova, confining it within the fissure created by its landing.<sup id="_ref-defense_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-defense" title="">[50]</a></sup> Afterward, the WEAPONs entered hibernation to await any future threat that could harm the planet. Eventually, the mummified remains of Jenova would be unearthed by <a href="/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_characters#Professor Gast" id="w">Professor Gast</a>, a researcher for the Shinra Company. Mistaking the creature for a Cetra, Gast was given authorization to conduct an experiment to artificially produce a Cetra by combining cells from Jenova with the fetus of an unborn child.<sup id="_ref-jenova_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jenova" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>Five years before the present-day events seen by the player, Sephiroth learned that he was the product of this experiment while on a Shinra mission in Nibelheim, the hometown of Cloud and Tifa. However, unaware of all details involved, he concluded that he was a Cetra who had been produced solely from Jenova&#39;s genetic material. Enraged, he burned down the town, intending to kill all descendants of those he believed had abandoned his ancestors in the defense of the planet. According to Cloud, he confronted Sephiroth during this massacre, after which  Sephiroth vanished under unknown circumstances and was presumed dead until his reappearance in the Shinra building. When AVALANCHE reaches the Northern Crater, Sephiroth tells Cloud that he was not in Nibelheim, showing him images of a 1<sup>st</sup> Class SOLDIER with dark hair who occupies Cloud&#39;s place in his memories.<sup id="_ref-puppet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-puppet" title="">[51]</a></sup> With Tifa unable to refute Sephiroth&#39;s claims, Cloud breaks down and allows him to cast Meteor, resulting in the WEAPONs&#39; awakening. During the earthquake that follows, Cloud is separated from his companions and falls into the Lifestream.</p>
<p>As the meteor summoned by Sephiroth slowly approaches the planet, the Shinra Company focuses its efforts on protecting humanity from the WEAPONs,<sup id="_ref-defendingtheplanet_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-defendingtheplanet" title="">[34]</a></sup> who have begun to perceive everything as a threat to the planet. Meanwhile, AVALANCHE searches for Cloud, eventually locating him on a tropical resort island where he washed up following the casting of Meteor; he is in a <a href="/wiki/Catatonia" id="w">catatonic</a> state. The WEAPONs&#39; destructive activity quickly causes the island to split open, depositing Cloud and Tifa into the Lifestream below. There, she reconstructs Cloud&#39;s memories and learns the truth about his past. Although the player learns that he is a real human being and had actually been in Nibelheim during Sephiroth&#39;s attack, he never actually succeeded in joining SOLDIER and only managed to attain the rank of <a href="/wiki/Private_(rank)" id="w">private</a> in Shinra&#39;s military. The player learns that the previously-seen dark-haired SOLDIER is named &#34;<a href="/wiki/Zack_Fair" id="w">Zack</a>&#34;, and was Aeris&#39; first boyfriend. During Sephiroth&#39;s destruction of Nibelheim, Zack, Tifa and Cloud fought Sephiroth in Nibelheim&#39;s Mako reactor. Although Tifa and Zack were defeated, Cloud and Sephiroth severely wounded one another. After decapitating the body of Jenova, which had been stored in the Mako reactor, Sephiroth is thrown into the Lifestream by Cloud, taking the creature&#39;s head with him. Rather than dying, however, his body and consciousness were preserved in Mako inside Jenova&#39;s crater.</p>
<p>While Tifa was taken to safety in Midgar, Cloud and Zack were among the wounded survivors who were apprehended by Shinra as part an elaborate <a href="/wiki/Cover-up" id="w">cover-up</a> of Sephiroth&#39;s massacre. Professor Hojo subjected these survivors to an experiment, in which he performed the same enhancements given to members of SOLDIER. However, because Hojo conducted the experiment without any concern for the subjects&#39; mental capacities to handle the procedure, all but Zack entered a <a href="/wiki/Coma" id="w">comatose</a> state. Nearly five years later, Zack broke free from his confinement and took Cloud with him. The player learns that the procedure used to enhance members of SOLDIER involved both Mako showers and the injection of cells from Jenova. The alien cells inhabiting Cloud&#39;s body allowed his mind to construct a false persona, built around Zack&#39;s behavior, fighting style, and description of Sephiroth&#39;s destruction in Nibelheim, but they also allowed Sephiroth to modulate his behavior. The cells&#39; inherent ability to duplicate information led Cloud to believe that he had been the 1<sup>st</sup> Class SOLDIER in Nibelheim, as Zack was shot and killed outside Midgar by pursuing Shinra soldiers, shortly before the beginning of the game. Afterward, Tifa discovered Cloud, who was wearing Zack&#39;s spare uniform, and offered him a job with AVALANCHE.<sup id="_ref-jenova_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jenova" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the truth revealed, Cloud awakens and rejoins AVALANCHE. The player learns that, in her final moments, Aeris was casting a spell known as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Materia#Holy" id="w">Holy</a>&#34;, the only means of opposing Meteor. Though she succeeds, Sephiroth&#39;s focused will prevents the spell from taking effect and has been restraining it since. Deciding that humanity must be protected from the WEAPONs before Sephiroth can be approached, Shinra and AVALANCHE destroy the WEAPONs, but nearly all of Shinra&#39;s executives are killed in the process. Among the few survivors are <a href="/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_VII_characters#Reeve Tuesti" id="w">Reeve Tuesti</a>, revealed to be the repentant controller of Cait Sith,<sup id="_ref-reeve_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reeve" title="">[52]</a></sup> and Professor Hojo, who is revealed to be Sephiroth&#39;s father. He explains that he and his wife were assistants to Professor Gast, and offered up their unborn child as a test subject to research involving Jenova.<sup id="_ref-jenova_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jenova" title="">[49]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-wife_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wife" title="">[53]</a></sup> When Hojo attempts to help Sephiroth to gain mastery over the Lifestream afterward, AVALANCHE is given no choice but to fight and kill him.</p>
<p>With each member of AVALANCHE at peace with his or her past and all other opponents defeated, the group travels through the <a href="/wiki/Mantle_(geology)" id="w">mantle</a> of the planet to its core, where they defeat Sephiroth and free Holy. However, due to Meteor&#39;s already close proximity to the planet&#39;s surface, Holy is unable to destroy it alone. Selected as Meteor&#39;s target, Midgar is almost completely destroyed by the storms that spawn from its presence. However, sent by Aeris&#39; spirit, the Lifestream itself rises from the planet to aid Holy by pushing Meteor away, allowing Holy to destroy it.<sup id="_ref-aerithsavestheday_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aerithsavestheday" title="">[54]</a></sup> During the epilogue that follows, the ruins of Midgar are shown five hundred years later. While the landscape had once been desolate due to Shinra&#39;s operations, it is now a land of lush greenery.</p>

According to Kitase, &#34;Right from the time the decision to go with CD was made he [<a href="/wiki/Game_producer" id="w">producer</a> <a href="/wiki/Hironobu_Sakaguchi" id="w">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a>] set down a ground rule for the team saying, &#39;If the player becomes aware of the access times, we have failed&#39;&#34;, demanding that an immersive atmosphere be upheld, which led to the programming of various animations to activate while the game loaded data.<sup id="_ref-development3_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-development3" title="">[46]</a></sup> While the extra storage capacity and computer graphics to which the team now had access gave them the means to implement more than 40 minutes of <a href="/wiki/Full_motion_video" id="w">full motion video</a> movies<sup id="_ref-development3_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-development3" title="">[46]</a></sup> — an unprecedented undertaking in the genre at the time<sup id="_ref-development3_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-development3" title="">[46]</a></sup> — this innovation brought with it the added difficulty of ensuring that the inferiority of the in-game graphics in comparison to the FMV sequences was not too obvious.

<p>Among the difficulties faced was the potential inability to render 3D polygon models based on the designs of <a href="/wiki/Yoshitaka_Amano" id="w">Yoshitaka Amano</a>, the series&#39; long-time character designer. As his style was considered too exquisite to be compatible with the visual format of the project, this issue was addressed by bringing Tetsuya Nomura onboard as the project&#39;s main artist, while Amano aided in the design of the game&#39;s world map. Previously a monster designer for <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_V" id="w">Final Fantasy V</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-nomurain_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nomurain" title="">[62]</a></sup> Nomura&#39;s style was more reminiscent of <a href="/wiki/Manga" id="w">manga</a>, and considered easier to adapt.

Instead of recorded music and sound effects for the game, Uematsu opted for <a href="/wiki/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface" id="w">MIDIs</a>, using the PlayStation&#39;s own internal <a href="/wiki/Sound_chip" id="w">sound chip</a>. He has explained that he chose this method because it allowed the console&#39;s CPU to process audio data more quickly, which in turn allowed it to focus more on processing the game&#39;s 3D engine and to prevent noticeable load times. The game was originally intended to feature a <a href="/wiki/Vocal_music" id="w">vocal piece</a>, but this was cut due to the limitations imposed by recorded audio. However, a song with full choral backing is heard in &#34;<a href="/wiki/One-Winged_Angel" id="w">One-Winged Angel</a>&#34;.</p>

<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h1>Reception</h1>
<p><i>Final Fantasy VII</i> was both a critical and commercial success, and set several sales records. Within three days of its January 1997 release in Japan, the game had sold 2.3 million copies. This popularity inspired thousands of retailers in North America to break <a href="/wiki/Street_date" id="w">street dates</a> in September to meet public demand for the title.<sup id="_ref-streetdates_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-streetdates" title="">[85]</a></sup> In the game&#39;s debut weekend in North America, it sold 330,000 copies,<sup id="_ref-330k_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-330k" title="">[86]</a></sup> and had reached sales of 500,000 units in less than three weeks.<sup id="_ref-500k_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-500k" title="">[87]</a></sup> The momentum built in the game&#39;s opening weeks continued for several months; Sony announced that the game had sold one million copies on the continent by early December,<sup id="_ref-1mil_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1mil" title="">[88]</a></sup> prompting one business analyst to comment that &#34;Sony redefined the role-playing game (RPG) category and expanded the conventional audience with the launch of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-1mil_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1mil" title="">[88]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Although Square&#39;s announcement that <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> would be produced for Sony rather than Nintendo and that it would not be based on the <i>Final Fantasy SGI</i> demo was initially met with discontent among gamers,<sup id="_ref-development6_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-development6" title="">[57]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-development7_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-development7" title="">[58]</a></sup> the game continues to maintain a strong following.

<a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2>Legacy</h2>
<p><i>Final Fantasy VII</i> is regarded as one of the most influential titles in the history of video games.

Citing its &#34;beautiful cut-scenes and a deep, introspective narrative&#34;, they claimed that &#34;Square’s game was ... the first RPG to surpass, instead of copy, movie like storytelling&#34;, and that, without it, &#34;Aeris wouldn’t have died, and gamers wouldn’t have learned how to cry&#34;.<sup id="_ref-egmclaim_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-egmclaim" title="">[100]</a></sup> As well, in late 2007, <a href="/wiki/Dengeki_PlayStation" id="w">Dengeki PlayStation</a> named <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> as the best story, best RPG, and best overall game in their retrospective awards feature about the original <a href="/wiki/PlayStation" id="w">PlayStation</a>.<sup id="_ref-dengeki-awards_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dengeki-awards" title="">[101]</a></sup> The game&#39;s popularity and open-ended nature also led the director and writer to establish a plot-related connection between <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X" id="w">Final Fantasy X</a></i>, another popular <i>Final Fantasy</i> title.<sup id="_ref-development12_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-development12" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>

<i>Compilation of Final Fantasy VII</i> is the formal title for a series of games and animated features developed by Square Enix based in the world and continuity of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>.

Though not under the <i>Compilation</i> label, two novellas set within <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>&#39;s continuity have been produced, while a third <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> mobile game has also been developed. The first of the two novellas is <i><a href="/wiki/Aerith_Gainsborough#Maiden who Travels the Planet" id="w">Maiden who Travels the Planet</a></i>. It follows Aeris&#39; journey in the Lifestream following her death at the hands of Sephiroth, taking place concurrently with the second half of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>.<sup id="_ref-maiden_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-maiden" title="">[111]</a></sup> The second novella, <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_Advent_Children#On the Way to a Smile" id="w">On the Way to a Smile</a></i>, is a 3 part story based on the events that immediately followed the end of the game, with one part narrated from Tifa&#39;s perspective, one narrated from Barret&#39;s perspective, and the other narrated from that of a boy named &#34;Denzel&#34;, orphaned after Shinra crushed Sector 7.<sup id="_ref-otwtas_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-otwtas" title="">[112]</a></sup> Finally, <i>Final Fantasy VII Snowboarding</i>, released in North America in <a href="/wiki/2005_in_video_gaming" id="w">2005</a>, is a mobile <a href="/wiki/Porting" id="w">port</a> of the snowboarding <a href="/wiki/Minigame" id="w">minigame</a> featured in the original game.<sup id="_ref-snowboard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-snowboard" title="">[113]</a></sup> The game is playable on the LG VX8000, LG VX8100, Audiovox 8940 and Samsung A890 <a href="/wiki/Mobile_phone" id="w">mobile phone</a> and contains different tracks than the original minigame.</p>
<p>Some speculate that the <i>Compilation</i> will also include an <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_remake" id="w">enhanced remake</a> of the original <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> for the PlayStation 3. This speculation was sparked at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo by the release of a <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> <a href="/wiki/Technology_demo" id="w">technology demo</a> featuring the opening sequence of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> recreated using the PlayStation 3&#39;s graphical capabilities.<sup id="_ref-demo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-demo" title="">[114]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-demo2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-demo2" title="">[115]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-demo3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-demo3" title="">[116]</a></sup> The demo was created by Yoshinori Kitase&#39;s team with help from Koji Sugimoto, the main programmer for <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X" id="w">Final Fantasy X</a></i>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Motomu_Toriyama" id="w">Motomu Toriyama</a>, and was completed in one and a half month to Kitase&#39;s surprise and satisfaction, who nevertheless noted that it does not use the PlayStation 3&#39;s full capacities and could have been of even higher quality if more time had been given.<sup id="_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#_note-117" title="">[117]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Yōichi Wada explained that the presentation was intended only for technological demonstration purposes<sup id="_ref-demo3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-demo3" title="">[116]</a></sup> — claims echoed by Kitase in an interview in <i>Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω</i><sup id="_ref-demo_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-demo" title="">[114]</a></sup> — the June 2006 issue of <i>Electronic Gaming Monthly</i> stated that the video was actually a &#34;sneak peak at a next-gen revival&#34; of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>.<sup id="_ref-demo4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-demo4" title="">[118]</a></sup> An official statement from Square Enix later debunked this claim, reiterating that the company had not announced such a project.<sup id="_ref-remakerefuted_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-remakerefuted" title="">[119]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-remakerefuted2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-remakerefuted2" title="">[120]</a></sup> Further fueling the rumors, Kaz Hirai said at the Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Gallery in Tokyo: &#34;Congratulations on 10 fantastic years!
