The <b>effect of Hurricane Isabel on North Carolina</b> was the worst from a hurricane since <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Floyd" id="w">Hurricane Floyd</a> made <a href="/wiki/Landfall_(meteorology)" id="w">landfall</a> in 1999. <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Isabel" id="w">Hurricane Isabel</a> formed from a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_6" id="w">September 6</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a> in the tropical <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a>. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165&#160;mph (265&#160;km/h) on <a href="/wiki/September_11" id="w">September 11</a>. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Banks" id="w">Outer Banks</a> of <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> with winds of 105&#160;mph (165&#160;km/h) on <a href="/wiki/September_18" id="w">September 18</a>. It quickly weakened over land and became <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" id="w">extratropical</a> over western <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a> the next day.</p>
<p>Isabel produced moderate to heavy damage across eastern North Carolina, totaling $450&#160;million (2003&#160;<a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">USD</a>, $495&#160;million 2006&#160;USD). Damage was heaviest in <a href="/wiki/Dare_County%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Dare County</a>, where storm surge flooding and strong winds damaged thousands of houses. The storm surge produced a 2,000&#160;foot (600&#160;m) wide inlet on <a href="/wiki/Hatteras_Island" id="w">Hatteras Island</a>, isolating <a href="/wiki/Hatteras%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Hatteras</a> by road for two months. Strong winds downed hundreds of trees of across the state, leaving up to 700,000&#160;residents without power. Most areas with power outages had power restored within a few days. The hurricane directly killed one person and indirectly killed two in the state.</p>

By four days before Isabel made landfall, most <a href="/wiki/Global_climate_model" id="w">computer models</a> predicted Isabel to make landfall between North Carolina and <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> consistently forecasted a landfall on North Carolina.<sup id="_ref-avila33_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-avila33" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-archive_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-archive" title="">[2]</a></sup> Initially, forecasters predicted a landfall in the northeastern portion of the state,<sup id="_ref-avila33_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-avila33" title="">[1]</a></sup> though as the hurricane neared land the predicted landfall position was much closer to where it ultimately was. From three days in advance, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36&#160;miles (58&#160;km), and for 48 hours in advance the average track error was 18&#160;miles (29&#160;km). Strong confidence in Isabel&#39;s final landfall prompted the National Hurricane Center to issue a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">hurricane watch</a> for the entire North Carolina coastline about 50 hours before Isabel struck land. 38 hours before the hurricane made landfall, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the landfall area.<sup id="_ref-tcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[3]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Newport%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Newport</a> <a href="/wiki/National_Weather_Service" id="w">Weather Forecast Office</a> issued a flood potential statement two days before landfall, which indicated a threat for flash flooding. The office began preparing for the hurricane one week before landfall, and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties.<sup id="_ref-nws_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nws" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Emergency_evacuation" id="w">Evacuation</a> orders began on <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>, when officials issued a voluntary evacuation for portions of four counties and one entire county. By around 24 hours before landfall, mandatory evacuations were ordered for eight counties, all of which but one were for the entire counties. All coastal counties from <a href="/wiki/Cape_Fear" id="w">Cape Fear</a> northward were under a mandatory evacuation. A survey of 603 residents in northeastern North Carolina indicated 57% of residents along the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Banks" id="w">Outer Banks</a> and 77% of residents in <a href="/wiki/Storm_surge" id="w">storm surge</a>-prone areas of the <a href="/wiki/Pamlico_Sound" id="w">Pamlico Sound</a> did not evacuate despite being under a mandatory evacuation. The two primary reasons stated for the residents&#39; evacuation decisions were the hurricane&#39;s strength and track. The media and statements from officials were two other reasons. 70% of people along the Outer Banks heard the official evacuation notices, though only 30% of residents near the Pamlico Sound heard the notices. A majority of the respondents to the survey who heard the evacuation notices left the area. None of the surveyed evacuees from the Outer Banks went to a public shelter; 60% went to a friend or a relative&#39;s house and 24% went to a motel. Evacuees on the Outer Banks generally went elsewhere in North Carolina or to <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>. For evacuees around the Pamlico Sound, only 9% left for a public shelter, while 75% left for a friend or relative&#39;s house. Most near the Pamlico Sound remained in their own neighborhood or own county. Of the 19 North Carolina counties issuing evacuation orders, the duration of the evacuation process varied between 3 hours to 12 hours in <a href="/wiki/Dare_County%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Dare County</a>. Five counties reported heavy amounts of traffic, while traffic problems included stalled cars along roads, inadequate route signing, and flooded or damaged roads.<sup id="_ref-assess_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-assess" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the morning of the hurricane&#39;s landfall, 65 shelters were prepared with a capacity of 95,000 people. The <a href="/wiki/American_Red_Cross" id="w">American Red Cross</a> prepared 100 feeding vehicles in staging areas, and deployed two mobile kitchens each with the capacity to provide 10,000 meals per day. Additionally, five <a href="/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention" id="w">Southern Baptist Convention</a> kitchens were on standby, in total being able to provide 20,000 meals per day.<sup id="_ref-shelters1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shelters1" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

Hurricane Isabel first began affecting North Carolina about 15 hours before it struck land. Upon making landfall along the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Banks" id="w">Outer Banks</a>, the hurricane produced strong waves of 15 to 25&#160;feet (4.5 to 6&#160;m) in height and a storm surge of about 6 to 8&#160;feet (1.8 to 2.4&#160;m).<sup id="_ref-nws_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nws" title="">[4]</a></sup> Waters reached a height of 7.15 feet in <a href="/wiki/Hatteras%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Hatteras</a>.<sup id="_ref-chfp_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chfp" title="">[9]</a></sup> Storm tides along the coast peaked at 7.7&#160;feet (2.3&#160;m) in <a href="/wiki/Cape_Hatteras" id="w">Cape Hatteras</a>, though the total could be higher there due to the tide gage being destroyed by the hurricane.<sup id="_ref-nws_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nws" title="">[4]</a></sup> The surge and waves created a new <a href="/wiki/Inlet" id="w">inlet</a> by washing out a portion of <a href="/wiki/Hatteras_Island" id="w">Hatteras Island</a> between Hatteras and <a href="/wiki/Frisco%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Frisco</a>. Unofficially named <a href="/wiki/Isabel_Inlet" id="w">Isabel Inlet</a>, the break was 2,000&#160;foot (600&#160;m) wide and 15&#160;foot (3&#160;m) deep, and consisted of three distinct channels. The formation of the inlet destroyed a portion of <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_Highway_12" id="w">North Carolina Highway 12</a>,<sup id="_ref-natgeo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-natgeo" title="">[10]</a></sup> and also washed out three homes,<sup id="_ref-nws_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nws" title="">[4]</a></sup> dunes, power lines, and utility pipes.<sup id="_ref-outban_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-outban" title="">[11]</a></sup> The new inlet destroyed all utility connections to Hatteras Village, isolating the residents there. The storm surge and waves from Isabel also resulted in a breach between Hatteras and <a href="/wiki/Hatteras_Inlet" id="w">Hatteras Inlet</a>. The breach, which nearly became an inlet, formed from the flow of ocean water across the island, though it was not deep enough for a constant water flow. The breach occurred in an area without roads or houses, and had little impact on Hatteras residents.<sup id="_ref-outban_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-outban" title="">[11]</a></sup> Rough surf and storm surge caused overwash and severe beach erosion throughout the Outer Banks, with flooding in <a href="/wiki/Ocracoke%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Ocracoke</a> reportedly being up to waist-high.<sup id="_ref-newportnws_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newportnws" title="">[12]</a></sup> The hurricane produced an estimated 4&#160;inches (100&#160;mm) of rain throughout most of the Outer Banks, with <a href="/wiki/Duck%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Duck</a> reporting a peak of 4.72&#160;inches (120&#160;mm). Wind gusts in association with the hurricane peaked at 105&#160;mph (170&#160;km/h) in <a href="/wiki/Ocracoke%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Ocracoke</a>, with several other locations reporting hurricane force gusts.<sup id="_ref-newportnws_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newportnws" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wind and water damage across the Outer Banks was extensive.

Local rescue was unable to reach them; however, they were ultimately able to reach safety.<sup id="_ref-nws_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nws" title="">[4]</a></sup> The rough waves greatly affected piers in <a href="/wiki/Nags_Head%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Nags Head</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rodanthe%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Rodanthe</a>, and Frisco, with three being completely destroyed. Several locations along North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed out or covered with debris, and 15&#160;foot (4.5&#160;m) sections of pavement on both sides of a bridge near Ocracoke were washed away. Strong waves destroyed a beach access ramp, as well.<sup id="_ref-newportnws_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newportnws" title="">[12]</a></sup> Several thousand homes and businesses were damaged by the passage of the hurricane, and damage in Dare County totaled nearly $350&#160;million (2003&#160;USD, $384&#160;million 2006&#160;USD).

The large circulation of Isabel dropped moderate rainfall across the area, peaking at 4.51&#160;inches (115&#160;mm) in <a href="/wiki/Whiteville%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Whiteville</a>. Additionally, weather radars estimated over 5&#160;inches (125&#160;mm) of precipitation fell in portions of <a href="/wiki/New_Hanover_County%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">New Hanover County</a>. The rainfall resulted in ponding on roadways, though no severe flooding was reported. Storm tides were generally around 1&#160;foot (0.3&#160;m) above normal,<sup id="_ref-wilnws_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wilnws" title="">[13]</a></sup> though Wilmington reported a storm tide of 3.22&#160;feet (1&#160;m).<sup id="_ref-nws_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nws" title="">[4]</a></sup> Rough waves resulted in moderate beach erosion near <a href="/wiki/Cape_Fear" id="w">Cape Fear</a> and minor erosion along eastward-facing beaches north of Cape Fear.<sup id="_ref-wilnws_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wilnws" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

Isabel produced strong winds throughout inland areas of eastern North Carolina. <a href="/wiki/Plymouth%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Plymouth</a>, located 75&#160;miles (120&#160;km) from where the hurricane made landfall, reported gusts to 95&#160;mph (155&#160;km/h). Sustained winds were lighter, with only a few locations receiving tropical storm strength winds. The passage of the hurricane resulted in moderate rainfall of up to 6.02&#160;inches (153&#160;mm) in <a href="/wiki/Havelock%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Havelock</a>. Upon making landfall, Isabel produced moderate to severe storm surges along the <a href="/wiki/Pamlico_River" id="w">Pamlico</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neuse_River" id="w">Neuse Rivers</a>, with a location in <a href="/wiki/Craven_County%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Craven County</a> reporting a storm tide of 10.5&#160;feet (3.2&#160;m) above normal.<sup id="_ref-newportnws_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newportnws" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

Several eyewittnesses reported high velocity, waist deep water moving homes, trailers, and other objects many yards inland. As the water retreated, these objects were then dragged back towards the sound. A 5 to 8&#160;foot (1.5 to 2.4&#160;m) storm surge struck the western portion of the <a href="/wiki/Albemarle_Sound" id="w">Albemarle Sound</a>, with significant surge flooding occurring to the west of <a href="/wiki/Edenton%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Edenton</a>.
