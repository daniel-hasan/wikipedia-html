<b>Sheffield</b> ({{Audio}}) is a <a href="/wiki/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">city</a> and <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_borough" id="w">metropolitan borough</a> in <a href="/wiki/South_Yorkshire" id="w">South Yorkshire</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>. It is so named because of its origins in a field on the <a href="/wiki/River_Sheaf" id="w">River Sheaf</a> that runs through the city. </p>
<p>The city has grown from its largely industrial roots to encompass a wide economic base. The population of the City of Sheffield is estimated at 525,800 people (2006),<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and it is one of the eight largest <a href="/wiki/England#Geography" id="w">English</a> cities outside <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, which form the <a href="/wiki/English_Core_Cities_Group" id="w">English Core Cities Group</a>. The wider <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Urban_Area" id="w">Sheffield Urban Area</a>, which extends beyond the city proper, has a population of 640,720.</p>
<p>Sheffield obtained world-wide recognition during the 19th century for its production of <a href="/wiki/Steel" id="w">steel</a>. Many innovations in the industry were developed locally, including <a href="/wiki/Crucible_steel" id="w">crucible</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stainless_steel" id="w">stainless steel</a>. This fuelled an almost tenfold increase in the population during the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" id="w">Industrial Revolution</a>. It gained its <a href="/wiki/Municipal_charter" id="w">city charter</a> in 1893 and became officially titled the City of Sheffield. International competition caused a decline in local industry during the 1970s and 1980s, and at the same time the nearby national coal industry collapsed, affecting Sheffield&#39;s population. </p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The area that is now the City of Sheffield has been occupied since at least the last <a href="/wiki/Ice_age" id="w">ice age</a>,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> but the settlements that grew to form Sheffield date from the second half of the 1st millennium, and are of <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxons" id="w">Anglo-Saxon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Danelaw" id="w">Danish</a> origin.<sup id="_ref-VICKERS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VICKERS" title="">[3]</a></sup> In Anglo-Saxon times the Sheffield area straddled the border between the kingdoms of <a href="/wiki/Mercia" id="w">Mercia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Northumbria" id="w">Northumbria</a>. The <i><a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle" id="w">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a></i> reports that <a href="/wiki/Eanred_of_Northumbria" id="w">King Eanred</a> of <a href="/wiki/Northumbria" id="w">Northumbria</a> submitted to <a href="/wiki/Egbert_of_Wessex" id="w">King Egbert</a> of <a href="/wiki/Wessex" id="w">Wessex</a> at the hamlet of <a href="/wiki/Dore" id="w">Dore</a> (now a suburb of Sheffield) in 829.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> This event made Egbert the first Saxon to claim to be king of all of England. After the <a href="/wiki/Norman_conquest" id="w">Norman conquest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Castle" id="w">Sheffield Castle</a> was built to control the local settlements, and a small town developed that is the nucleus of the modern city.</p>
<p>By 1296 a market had been established at what is now known as <a href="/wiki/Castle_Square%2C_Sheffield" id="w">Castle Square</a>,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> and Sheffield subsequently grew into a small market town. In the 14th century Sheffield was already noted for the production of knives, as mentioned in <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer" id="w">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales" id="w">The Canterbury Tales</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> and by 1600 it had become the main centre of cutlery production in England, overseen by <a href="/wiki/Company_of_Cutlers_in_Hallamshire" id="w">The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire</a>. From 1570 to 1584 <a href="/wiki/Mary_I_of_Scotland" id="w">Mary, Queen of Scots</a> was held as a prisoner in Sheffield Castle and <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Manor" id="w">Sheffield Manor</a>.<sup id="_ref-VICKERS_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VICKERS" title="">[3]</a></sup>

<p>In the 1740s a form of the <a href="/wiki/Crucible_steel" id="w">crucible steel</a> process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of a better quality of <a href="/wiki/Steel" id="w">steel</a> than had previously been available. At about the same time a technique for fusing a thin sheet of <a href="/wiki/Silver" id="w">silver</a> onto a <a href="/wiki/Copper" id="w">copper</a> ingot to produce silver plating was invented and became widely known as <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_plate" id="w">Sheffield plate</a>. These innovations spurred the growth of Sheffield as an industrial town. However, the loss of some important export markets led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a <a href="/wiki/Cholera" id="w">cholera</a> epidemic that killed 402 people in 1832.<sup id="_ref-VICKERS_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VICKERS" title="">[3]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" id="w">Industrial Revolution</a> saw a resurgence of Sheffield through the 19th century. As a result of its growing population, the town was incorporated as a <a href="/wiki/Borough" id="w">borough</a> in 1842 and granted a <a href="/wiki/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">city charter</a> in 1893.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed on the outskirts of the town. The collapse of the dam wall of one of these reservoirs in 1864 resulted in <a href="/wiki/Great_Sheffield_Flood" id="w">the Great Sheffield Flood</a>, which killed 270 people and devastated large parts of the town. The growing population also led to the construction of a large number of back-to-back slums, which, along with severe pollution from the factories, inspired <a href="/wiki/George_Orwell" id="w">George Orwell</a>, writing in 1937, to declare, &#34;Sheffield, I suppose, could justly claim to be called the ugliest town in the Old World&#34;.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>

A recession in the 1930s was only halted by the increasing international tension as <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> loomed. The steel factories of Sheffield were set to work making weapons and ammunition for the war. As a result, once war was declared, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred over the nights of <a href="/wiki/12_December" id="w">12 December</a> and <a href="/wiki/15_December" id="w">15 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a> (now known as the <i><a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Blitz" id="w">Sheffield Blitz</a></i>). More than 660 lives were lost and numerous buildings were destroyed.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, many of the slums were demolished and replaced with housing schemes such as the <a href="/wiki/Park_Hill%2C_Sheffield" id="w">Park Hill flats</a>. Large parts of the city centre were also cleared to make way for a new system of roads.<sup id="_ref-VICKERS_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VICKERS" title="">[3]</a></sup> Increased automation and competition from abroad resulted in the closure of many steel mills. The 1980s saw the worst of this run-down of Sheffield&#39;s industries (along with those of many other areas in the UK). The 1984/5 <a href="/wiki/UK_miners%26%2339%3B_strike_(1984-1985)" id="w">miners&#39; strike</a> affected the coal mining areas to the east and north east of Sheffield, though it is unlikely to have had a major impact upon Sheffield&#39;s economy. The building of the <a href="/wiki/Meadowhall" id="w">Meadowhall</a> shopping centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much needed jobs but speeding the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started when the city hosted the 1991 <a href="/wiki/Universiade" id="w">World Student Games, WSG</a>, which saw the construction of new sporting facilities such as the <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Arena" id="w">Sheffield Arena</a>, <a href="/wiki/Don_Valley_Stadium" id="w">Don Valley Stadium</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Ponds_Forge" id="w">Ponds Forge</a> complex.<sup id="_ref-VICKERS_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VICKERS" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The city is now changing rapidly as new projects aim to regenerate some of the more run-down parts of the city. One such project, the <i>Heart of the City Project</i>, has seen a number of public works in the city centre: the <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Town_Hall" id="w">Peace Gardens</a> were renovated in 1998, the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Galleries" id="w">Millennium Galleries</a> opened in April 2001, the <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Winter_Gardens" id="w">Winter Gardens</a> were opened on <a href="/wiki/22_May" id="w">22 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>, and a public space to link these two areas, the Millennium Square, was opened in May 2006. Further developments included the remodelling of <a href="/wiki/Sheaf_Square" id="w">Sheaf Square</a> in front of the recently refurbished railway station. The new square contains <i>The Cutting Edge</i> a sculpture designed by Si Applied Ltd<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> made of Sheffield steel. </p>
<a id="Governance" name="Governance"></a><h1>Governance</h1>
<p>The city currently returns six <a href="/wiki/Member_of_Parliament" id="w">Members of Parliament</a> to the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons" id="w">House of Commons</a>, but this will be reduced to five at the next election as one constituency, <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Hillsborough_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" id="w">Hillsborough</a>, will be abolished and merged with three other constituencies<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>.

<p>Sheffield is governed by the elected <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_City_Council" id="w">Sheffield City Council</a>. For most of the council&#39;s history it has been controlled by the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" id="w">Labour Party</a>, and has historically been noted for its <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" id="w">leftist</a> sympathies; during the 1980s administration under <a href="/wiki/David_Blunkett" id="w">David Blunkett</a>, the area earned the sarcastic and rather derogatory appellation &#34;<a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_South_Yorkshire" id="w">People&#39;s Republic of South Yorkshire</a>&#34; from the British Right. However, the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Democrats" id="w">Liberal Democrats</a> controlled the Council briefly at the turn of the 21st century. There are 84 councillors; the current council leader is <a href="/wiki/Jan_Wilson" id="w">Jan Wilson</a>. The city also has a <a href="/wiki/Lord_Mayor" id="w">Lord Mayor</a>. In the past the Office of Mayor had considerable authority, and carried with it executive powers over the finances and affairs of the city council. Today it is simply a ceremonial role. The current (2007/08) Lord Mayor is Arthur Dunworth.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> During the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_local_elections%2C_2007" id="w">English Local Election 2007</a> the Labour Party lost the council to <a href="/wiki/No_overall_control" id="w">NOC</a>, with the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Democrats" id="w">Liberal Democrats</a> gaining enough seats to make it a joint control council, one of 80 that year. The tacit support of the Green party ensured Labour remains in control.</p>
<p>The majority of council-owned facilities are now operated by independent charitable trusts. <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_International_Venues" id="w">Sheffield International Venues</a> runs many of the cities sporting and leisure facilities, including <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Arena" id="w">Sheffield Arena</a> and <a href="/wiki/Don_Valley_Stadium" id="w">Don Valley Stadium</a>. <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Galleries_and_Museums_Trust" id="w">Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Industrial_Museums_Trust" id="w">Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust</a> take care of galleries and museums owned by the council.

Sheffield is located at {{coor dm}}. It lies directly beside <a href="/wiki/Rotherham" id="w">Rotherham</a>, from which it is separated by the <a href="/wiki/M1_motorway" id="w">M1 motorway</a>. Although <a href="/wiki/Barnsley_(borough)" id="w">Barnsley Metropolitan Borough</a> also borders Sheffield to the north, the town itself is a few miles further away. The southern and western borders of the city are shared with <a href="/wiki/Derbyshire" id="w">Derbyshire</a>; in the first half of the 20th century Sheffield extended its borders south into Derbyshire, annexing a number of villages,<sup id="_ref-derbyshire_expansion_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-derbyshire_expansion" title="">[15]</a></sup> including <a href="/wiki/Totley" id="w">Totley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dore" id="w">Dore</a> and the area now known as <a href="/wiki/Mosborough" id="w">Mosborough</a> Townships. Directly to the west of the city is the <a href="/wiki/Peak_District_National_Park" id="w">Peak District National Park</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Pennines" id="w">Pennine</a> hill range.</p>
<p>Sheffield is a geographically diverse city.<sup id="_ref-GEO_diverse_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GEO_diverse" title="">[16]</a></sup> The city nestles in a natural amphitheatre created by several hills<sup id="_ref-number of hills_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-number of hills" title="">[17]</a></sup> and the confluence of five rivers: <a href="/wiki/River_Don%2C_England" id="w">Don</a>, <a href="/wiki/River_Sheaf" id="w">Sheaf</a>, <a href="/wiki/River_Rivelin" id="w">Rivelin</a>, <a href="/wiki/River_Loxley" id="w">Loxley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Porter_Brook" id="w">Porter</a>. As such, much of the city is built on hillsides with views into the city centre or out to the countryside.

<p>With an estimated total of over two million trees,<sup id="_ref-GEO_treecount_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GEO_treecount" title="">[18]</a></sup> Sheffield has more trees per person than any other city in Europe. It has over 170 woodlands (covering {{convert}} ), 78 public parks (covering {{convert}}) and 10 public gardens. Added to the  {{convert}} of national park and {{convert}} of water this means that 61% of the city is <a href="/wiki/Greenspace" id="w">greenspace</a>.</p>
<p>Sheffield also has a very wide variety of <a href="/wiki/Habitat_(ecology)" id="w">habitat</a>, comparing favourably with any city in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>: urban, parkland and woodland, agricultural and arable land, moors, meadows and freshwater-based habitats. Large parts of the city are designated as <a href="/wiki/SSSI" id="w">sites of special scientific interest</a> including several urban areas.</p>
<p>The present city boundaries were set in 1974 (with slight modification in 1994), when the former <a href="/wiki/County_borough" id="w">county borough</a> of Sheffield merged with <a href="/wiki/Stocksbridge" id="w">Stocksbridge</a> <a href="/wiki/Urban_District" id="w">Urban District</a> and two parishes from the <a href="/wiki/Wortley_Rural_District" id="w">Wortley Rural District</a>. This area includes a significant part of the countryside surrounding the main urban region. Roughly a third of Sheffield lies in the <a href="/wiki/Peak_District_National_Park" id="w">Peak District National Park</a> (no other English city includes parts of a <a href="/wiki/National_park" id="w">national park</a> within its boundary), and Sheffield often boasts of being Europe&#39;s greenest city, a claim that was reinforced when it won the 2005 <a href="/wiki/Entente_Florale" id="w">Entente Florale</a> competition.

<p>Sheffield is made up of numerous suburbs and neighbourhoods, many of which developed from villages or <a href="/wiki/Hamlet_(place)" id="w">hamlets</a> that were absorbed into Sheffield as the city grew.

After many years of decline, the Sheffield economy is going through a strong revival. The 2004 <a href="/wiki/Barclays_Bank" id="w">Barclays Bank</a> Financial Planning study<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> revealed that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Hallam_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" id="w">Hallam</a> was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside of <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> for office and residential space and rents during the second half of 2004. Some £250 million was also invested in the city during 2005. The Sheffield economy is worth £7.4 billion (2003 GVA).<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>  This can be seen by the current surge of redevelopments, including the <a href="/wiki/St._Pauls_Tower" id="w">City Lofts Tower</a> and accompanying <a href="/wiki/St._Pauls_Place" id="w">St. Pauls Place</a>, Velocity Living, and <a href="/wiki/The_Moor" id="w">the Moor</a> redevelopment,<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> the forthcoming <a href="/wiki/New_Retail_Quarter" id="w">NRQ</a> and the recently completed <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Winter_Gardens" id="w">Winter Gardens</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peace_Gardens" id="w">Peace Gardens</a>, <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Galleries" id="w">Millennium Galleries</a>, many project under the <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_One" id="w">Sheffield One</a> redevelopment agency.</p>
<p>Sheffield has an international reputation for metallurgy and <a href="/wiki/Steel" id="w">steel</a>-making.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Many innovations in these fields have been made in Sheffield. <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Huntsman" id="w">Benjamin Huntsman</a> discovered the <a href="/wiki/Crucible_technique" id="w">crucible technique</a> in the 1740s at his workshop in <a href="/wiki/Handsworth%2C_South_Yorkshire" id="w">Handsworth</a>.

B. Pickering</a> and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, &#39;70s, and &#39;80s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels. Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the <a href="/wiki/Advanced_Manufacturing_Park" id="w">Advanced Manufacturing Park</a> by Sheffield&#39;s universities and other independent research organisations. 
Organisations currently located on the AMP include; the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between The Boeing Company and The University of Sheffield), Castings Technology International (Cti) and TWI.</p>
<p>While iron and steel have long been the main industries of Sheffield, <a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" id="w">coal mining</a> has also been a major industry, particularly in the outlying areas, and the <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster" id="w">Palace of Westminster</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> was built using <a href="/wiki/Limestone" id="w">limestone</a> from <a href="/wiki/Quarry" id="w">quarries</a> in the nearby village of <a href="/wiki/Anston" id="w">Anston</a>.

<p>Sheffield has a District Energy system which exploits the city&#39;s domestic waste, converting it to electricity. It also provides hot water, which is distributed through over {{convert}} of pipes under the city, via two networks. These networks supply heat and hot water for many buildings throughout the city. These include not only cinemas, hospitals, shops, and offices, but also universities, residential properties<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup>. Energy generated in a waste plant produces 36MW of thermal energy and up to 6.8MW electrical energy from 115,000 tonnes of waste. It is claimed <sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> that for every 100,000MWh of energy supplied by district energy 31,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide is displaced and that for every 100,000MWh of useful energy delivered 154,000MWh of fossil fuel energy is displaced..</p>

<p>The hilly topography of Sheffield and its former nature as a centre of industry rather than commerce meant that the city did not develop as extensive a suburban and inter-urban railway network as other comparable British cities.
