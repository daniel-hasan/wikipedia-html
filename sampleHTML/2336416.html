<b>William McIntosh</b> (<a href="/wiki/1775" id="w">1775</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/April_30" id="w">April 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1825" id="w">1825</a>), also known as White Warrior, was the son of <a href="/wiki/Captain_William_McIntosh" id="w">Captain William McIntosh</a>, a member of a prominent <a href="/wiki/Savannah%2C_Georgia" id="w">Savannah, Georgia</a> family sent into the Creek Nation to recruit them to fight for the British during the Revolutionary War (Captain McIntosh&#39;s mother was a sister of <a href="/wiki/Lachlan_McGillivray" id="w">Lachlan McGillivray</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Clan_MacGillivray" id="w">Clan MacGillivray</a> Chiefs Lineage). His mother, a <a href="/wiki/Creek_(people)" id="w">Creek</a> named <a href="/wiki/Senoya" id="w">Senoya</a> (also spelled Senoia), was a member of the prominent Wind Clan. Raised as an Indian, he never knew his <a href="/wiki/Tory#American Revolution" id="w">Tory</a> father. Because among the Creeks, descent was determined through one&#39;s mother; the fact that his father was white was of little importance. To put this more clearly, in the Muskogean mind McIntosh&#39;s father was not the one who begot him, but was in fact the eldest brother of his mother. McIntosh was a cousin of <a href="/wiki/William_Weatherford" id="w">William Weatherford</a> and Georgia Governor <a href="/wiki/George_Troup" id="w">George M. Troup</a>.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" id="w">War of 1812</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Creek_War" id="w">civil war</a> between the Upper and Lower Creeks broke out, and McIntosh was selected to head a kind of national police force established by <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Hawkins" id="w">Benjamin Hawkins</a>, an Indian agent, to deal with the nativistic Creek <a href="/wiki/Red_Sticks" id="w">Red Sticks</a>. He gained the enmity of (Alabama&#39;s) the Upper Creek Indians by leading General <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" id="w">Andrew Jackson&#39;s</a> Indian troops during the <a href="/wiki/Creek_War" id="w">Creek Indian War</a> of <a href="/wiki/1813" id="w">1813</a> - <a href="/wiki/1814" id="w">1814</a>, during which the Upper Creeks were defeated. For his services at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Horseshoe_Bend" id="w">Battle of Horseshoe Bend</a> and elsewhere, he was commissioned a <a href="/wiki/Brigadier_General" id="w">Brigadier General</a> in the United States Army.</p>
<p>After the Creek Indian War, McIntosh built a plantation on the <a href="/wiki/Chattahoochee_River" id="w">Chattahoochee River</a> in <a href="/wiki/Carroll_County%2C_Georgia" id="w">Carroll County</a> called Lockchau Talofau (Acorn Bluff) that was worked by 72 slaves. (It is near <a href="/wiki/Whitesburg%2C_Georgia" id="w">Whitesburg</a> and is today maintained as a park by Carroll County.)</p>
<p>In an <a href="/wiki/1817" id="w">1817</a> letter written to President <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" id="w">Madison</a> and signed by McIntosh, Madison was told that, while the more influential Cherokees of mixed blood wanted to swap their land, the &#34;not so much civilized&#34; pure bloods feared the mixed-bloods would&#8212;as they did&#8212;swap all their land, leaving them &#34;without any land to walk on.&#34; The Creeks feared that these Cherokees might&#8212;as they already had&#8212;take land from the Creeks.</p>
<p>McIntosh also fought for the United States in the <a href="/wiki/First_Seminole_War" id="w">First Seminole War</a>. He gained fame during this war by playing a major role in the capture of the so-called <a href="/wiki/Fort_Gadsden" id="w">Negro Fort</a> located on the lower <a href="/wiki/Apalachicola_River" id="w">Apalachicola</a>. (Georgia slaves escaped and took refuge with the Seminoles in Spanish-held <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>.) The fort was occupied by about 300 black men, women, and children, 20 renegade Choctaws, and a few Seminole warriors. Its defenders were led by a black named Garcon. The downfall of the fort was brought about by an American cannon ball heated red hot setting off a tremendous explosion when it landed in the fort&#39;s magazine.</p>
<p>Despite the fact the Upper Creeks (including McIntosh) had vowed to kill anyone who signed away any more Indian land, McIntosh, along with eight other chiefs, on <a href="/wiki/February_12" id="w">February 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1825" id="w">1825</a> signed the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Indian_Springs" id="w">Treaty of Indian Springs</a>; thus relinquishing all the Creeks&#39; land in Georgia in exchange for $400,000. </p>
<p>According to the fifth article of the treaty it stipulated, &#34;That the treaty commissioners pay the first $200,000 directly to the McIntosh party.&#34;</p>
<p>Whether he signed the treaty for personal gain or because he believed signing it was in the best interests of the Creek Nation is still argued.</p>
<p>Despite Governor Troup&#39;s promise to protect him, just before daybreak on April 30th about 200 Creeks lead by <a href="/wiki/Menawa" id="w">Menawa</a>, one of the few Red Stick leaders who had survived the Creek War, set fire to McIntosh&#39;s plantation and executed him. After having been stabbed in the heart by the point of a long knife, shot an estimated 50 times, McIntosh was scalped and his body thrown in the river. If his enemies had waited much longer, McIntosh wouldn&#39;t have been there, as he was planning to leave that morning to look over land promised him along the <a href="/wiki/Arkansas_River" id="w">Arkansas River</a>.</p>
