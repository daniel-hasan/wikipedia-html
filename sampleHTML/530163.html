<a id="Fictional_character_biography" name="Fictional_character_biography"></a><h2>Fictional character biography</h2>
<p>In the days of <a href="/wiki/Prehistory" id="w">prehistory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic" id="w">50,000 BC</a>, Savage was a <a href="/wiki/Caveman" id="w">caveman</a> named Vandar Adg, leader of the Blood Tribe. He was bathed in the <a href="/wiki/Radiation" id="w">radiation</a> of a mysterious <a href="/wiki/Meteorite" id="w">meteorite</a>, which gave him incredible intellect and immortality. An observer from the Bear Tribe would later approach that same meteorite and become Savage&#39;s eternal nemesis, the <a href="/wiki/Immortal_Man" id="w">Immortal Man</a>, possessing the power to <a href="/wiki/Resurrection" id="w">resurrect</a> as a new persona every time he is killed.</p>
<p>Savage&#39;s first mark in the &#34;history&#34; of the DC Universe came when he and a select group of people successfully undermined and destroyed the lost city of <a href="/wiki/Atlantis" id="w">Atlantis</a>. That group of people became known as the <a href="/wiki/Illuminati" id="w">Illuminati</a>, with Savage serving as its leader, then and ever since.</p>
<p>He claims to have ruled hundreds of civilizations under hundreds of names: <a href="/wiki/Khafra" id="w">Khafre</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" id="w">Alexander the Great</a>, <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar" id="w">Julius Caesar</a> (though he has also claimed to have participated in the murder of Julius Caesar), <a href="/wiki/Genghis_Khan" id="w">Genghis Khan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Blackbeard" id="w">Blackbeard</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Vlad_III_the_Impaler" id="w">Vlad the Impaler</a>, to name a few. He has also worked as close friends and advisers to the likes of <a href="/wiki/Erik_the_Red" id="w">Erik the Red</a>, <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" id="w">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ra%26%2339%3Bs_al_Ghul" id="w">Ra&#39;s al Ghul</a>, <a href="/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck" id="w">Otto von Bismarck</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a>.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Comic_Books" id="w">Golden Age</a>, Savage battled the <a href="/wiki/Justice_Society_of_America" id="w">Justice Society of America</a>.  He attempted to capture the members of the Justice Society out of revenge, but was thwarted by the Golden and Silver Age Flashes (<a href="/wiki/Flash_(Jay_Garrick)" id="w">Jay Garrick</a> and <a href="/wiki/Flash_(Barry_Allen)" id="w">Barry Allen</a>). <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Savage would continue to make various attacks on the Justice Society in later stories. He was also one of the founding members of The <a href="/wiki/Injustice_Society" id="w">Injustice Society</a>, and briefly formed a group of villains called <a href="/wiki/Tartarus_(DC_comics)" id="w">Tartarus</a>.
He is one of the main villains in the <i><a href="/wiki/Justice_League_of_America:Year_One" id="w">JLA: Year One</a></i> storyline, working against the recently-formed JLA, and harboring a deep hatred towards superheroes and the invading alien <a href="/wiki/Appelaxians" id="w">Appelaxians</a>. During one confrontation with the aliens, Savage claims to have designed <a href="/wiki/Stonehenge" id="w">Stonehenge</a> itself, which the aliens have just partially demolished. Savage also mentions that he shut down the Justice Society with &#34;a few well-placed senators.&#34;</p>
<a id="Immortal_Man" name="Immortal_Man"></a><h4>Immortal Man</h4>
<p>Ultimately, Savage&#39;s enemy the Immortal Man erased himself from existence to save the world during the <i><a href="/wiki/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths" id="w">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>,</i> and Mitch Shelley, the <a href="/wiki/Resurrection_Man" id="w">Resurrection Man</a>, an amnesiac with similar powers, took over as Savage&#39;s nemesis. However, Savage&#39;s list of foes is not limited to those two characters. Having lived so long, Savage has butted heads with possibly every single <a href="/wiki/Hero" id="w">hero</a> featured in the DC Universe, past, present, and future, most notably the Justice Society of America and the <a href="/wiki/Justice_League" id="w">Justice League of America</a>. At present, in DC universe, Savage is about 52,000 years old. </p>
<a id="DC_One_Million" name="DC_One_Million"></a><h4>DC One Million</h4>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>In this series, it is learned Savage has a base deep inside the Egyptian <a href="/wiki/Sphinx" id="w">Sphinx</a>. A confrontation with <a href="/wiki/Martian_Manhunter" id="w">Martian Manhunter</a> leaves him with a burnt out eye, which seemingly afflicts him far into the future.</p>
<p>Savage will possibly meet his end in the year 85,271 A.D. (as seen in the <i><a href="/wiki/DC_One_Million" id="w">DC One Million</a></i> storyline), when he is unwillingly sent back in time to <a href="/wiki/20th_century" id="w">20th century</a> <a href="/wiki/Montevideo" id="w">Montevideo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uruguay" id="w">Uruguay</a>, seconds before it is obliterated by a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" id="w">nuclear weapon</a>, an action that was, ironically, ordered by Savage himself. At this point, the time jumping hero <a href="/wiki/Chronos_(comics)" id="w">Chronos</a> is seen in the background. This is, however, only one possible future for Savage.
These events may change due to the tampering with the forces of the universe by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Luthor%2C_Jr." id="w">Alexander Luthor, Jr.</a> and <a href="/wiki/Superboy-Prime" id="w">Superboy-Prime</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Infinite_Crisis" id="w">Infinite Crisis</a>.</p>
<a id="Villains_United" name="Villains_United"></a><h4>Villains United</h4>
<p>{{main}}
Vandal Savage was seen in the final two issues of <i><a href="/wiki/Villains_United" id="w">Villains United</a></i>.  Originally Savage was a member of <a href="/wiki/Lex_Luthor" id="w">Lex Luthor</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Secret_Society_of_Super_Villains" id="w">Society</a>, but he quit the Society and told Lex not to contact him for any reason.  While no reason was given it is likely Vandal quit because his daughter <a href="/wiki/Scandal_(comics)" id="w">Scandal Savage</a> was working against the Society as part of the <a href="/wiki/Secret_Six_(comics)" id="w">Secret Six</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> When the Society lodged a final ambush against the Six, Savage threatened to kill Luthor if he didn&#39;t call off the attack, saying that he couldn&#39;t allow anyone to harm his daughter. This was shown to be due more to ulterior motives than fatherly love, as in issue three of the Secret Six miniseries it was revealed Savage wants his daughter to produce an heir with <a href="/wiki/Catman_(comics)" id="w">Catman</a>, and he&#39;s been putting bounties on the Secret Six&#39;s heads as a warning of what will happen to her lover if she refuses him.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Flash_and_JSA" name="Flash_and_JSA"></a><h4>Flash and JSA</h4>
<p>{{main}}
Savage was seen as leader of a <a href="/wiki/Doomsday_cult" id="w">doomsday cult</a>. He attempted to use a device to pull an asteroid into the Earth, but was thrown into space with the asteroid itself when the <a href="/wiki/Wally_West" id="w">Flash</a> reversed the polarity of the device. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Eventually the asteroid fell back on Earth with Savage, who found his power greatly diminished and having lived through what he called the worst year of his life. His immortality completely drained, he&#39;s still able to survive otherwise fatal wounds, but a brain tumor and a strong decay of his biological function are leading him to a fast death, with an estimated life span of eleven days. Savage tried to capture <a href="/wiki/Alan_Scott" id="w">Alan Scott</a> by baiting him with a grotesque (and disguised) <a href="/wiki/Sandman_(Wesley_Dodds)" id="w">Wesley Dodds</a> clone, who, in fact, was his own clone. After a failed attempt to steal Scott&#39;s DNA, Savage was left alone in the rubble of his former secret base. Realizing that his clone could be considered his own offspring, and that the blood of his descendants has always renewed his strength, Savage cooked and ate his clone, renewing his energies at least for another year.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Savage returns in the first story arc of the new <i>Justice Society of America</i>, the mastermind behind a group of <a href="/wiki/Neonazi" id="w">Neonazi</a> superpowered villains targeting the heirs of several <a href="/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Comic_Books" id="w">Golden Age</a> superhero bloodlines. In issue #4, after a battle with <a href="/wiki/Wildcat_(comics)" id="w">Wildcat</a> &#38; his son, Savage is defeated when hit by a fire truck. He later reappears in Atlantis where he&#39;s revealed to have been behind the atrocities in <a href="/wiki/Sub_Diego" id="w">Sub Diego</a> and <a href="/wiki/Black_Manta" id="w">Black Manta</a>&#39;s occupation of the city. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Elseworlds" name="Elseworlds"></a><h2>Elseworlds</h2>
<p>Vandal Savage was the villain in the 1997 Elseworld <a href="/wiki/Limited_series" id="w">limited series</a> <i>Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty</i>.  In this story, Savage is obsessed with recovering the meteor that gave him his immortality, believing that it will reveal why he has become what he became. Over the centuries, he finds himself opposing the members of the Wayne family throughout history, starting with medieval knight Sir Joshua of Wainwright, to contemporary Bruce Wayne (Vandal saved Bruce&#39;s parents, but killed them when Bruce was an adult. He did this in order to ensure they did not stop him from reacquiring the meteor. He and Bruce died after a battle in space), to futuristic Vice President Brenda Wayne. At the conclusion of this last battle, Vandal was left drifting through space on the meteor, determined to learn the purpose of his life.</p>
<p>Another Elseworld story, <i>Flashpoint</i>, had Savage running a space-exploration corporation with the help of the crippled Barry Allen. He tried to use technology stolen from <a href="/wiki/Martian_Manhunter" id="w">J&#39;onn J&#39;onzz</a> to kill humanity (he wanted to commit suicide in the grandest manner possible), but was killed by <a href="/wiki/Flash_(Barry_Allen)" id="w">Barry Allen</a>, who sacrificed his life to stop the alien device.</p>
<p>In the limited series <i><a href="/wiki/Kingdom_Come_(comic_book)" id="w">Kingdom Come</a></i>, Vandal Savage is a member of <a href="/wiki/Lex_Luthor" id="w">Lex Luthor</a>&#39;s Mankind Liberation Front, but is captured by Batman and his allies when he gets mauled by that timeline&#39;s version of Wildcat.</p>

<a id="''Justice_League''" name="''Justice_League''"></a><h3> &#39;&#39;Justice League&#39;&#39; </h3>
<p>Savage is seen in several episodes of the <a href="/wiki/List_of_animated_television_series" id="w">animated series</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Justice_League_(TV_series)" id="w">Justice League</a></i>, where he is voiced by <a href="/wiki/Phil_Morris" id="w">Phil Morris</a>. This version of Savage, in addition to being an immortal, has enhanced healing properties in the style of <a href="/wiki/Wolverine_(comics)" id="w">Wolverine</a>. His origin is the same as that of his comic book counterpart, except it is revealed in the episode &#34;Maid of Honor&#34; his age is half of that in the comics - 25,000 years.</p>
<p>The League first encounters Savage in the three-part episode &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Savage_Time_(Justice_League)" id="w">The Savage Time</a>,&#34; when he manages to alter history and cause <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Nazi Germany</a> to win <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>.  The League (minus <a href="/wiki/Batman" id="w">Batman</a>, who was in the Watchtower at the time) is unaffected by the temporal change, as they are protected by <a href="/wiki/Green_Lantern" id="w">Green Lantern</a>&#39;s energy while he guides their space ship in for docking). They arrive back on Earth to find it ruled by Savage&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Fascist" id="w">fascist</a> dictatorship. With the aid of this timeline&#39;s version of Batman, the League travels back in time to learn that Savage sent to his younger self a laptop containing schematics for advanced weapons technology, as well as information on the future plans of the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" id="w">Allies</a>. This allowed Savage to catapult himself to the top of the Axis authority, deposing <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Hitler</a> and assuming the title of <a href="/wiki/F%C3%BChrer" id="w">Führer</a>. When Savage mounts a jet-powered aerial invasion of America, the League manages to stop his invasion force, with Savage&#39;s plane crashing into the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a>. Hitler is restored to power in time for <a href="/wiki/D-Day" id="w">D-Day</a> to succeed.</p>
<p>Savage&#39;s second appearance was in <i><a href="/wiki/Maid_of_Honor_(Justice_League_episode)" id="w">Maid of Honor</a></i>, masquerading as his own grandson, Vandall Savage III, and acting as administrator of <a href="/wiki/Kasnia" id="w">Kasnia</a>&#39;s space program. He became affianced to Princess Audrey, the heir to the throne. After marrying Audrey, he used Kasnia&#39;s involvement with an international space station to set up a <a href="/wiki/Railgun" id="w">rail gun</a> that shoots meteors with pinpoint accuracy. With this, he hoped to threaten the world into bowing to his authority. The League (in particular, <a href="/wiki/Wonder_Woman" id="w">Wonder Woman</a>, who had become a good friend of Audrey&#39;s) dismantles Savage&#39;s plot yet again. It is in this episode that Savage explains his origins, and the secret of his immortality.  At his plot&#39;s thwarting, Princess Audrey arrests him and when he brags how executing him will be impossible, she quietly hints that he will be effectively tortured instead in the ensuing attempts to kill him.</p>
<p>His final appearance was in the episode &#34;<a href="/wiki/Hereafter_(Justice_League)" id="w">Hereafter</a>&#34;.  <a href="/wiki/Superman" id="w">Superman</a>, having been thrown forward to a time when the Earth&#39;s sun is red (leaving him powerless) meets Savage, the sole surviving human. Savage was responsible for the destruction of the human race, having stolen the <a href="/wiki/Atom_(Ray_Palmer)" id="w">Atom</a>&#39;s piece of dwarf star, and using it to build a machine that would allow him to control the force of gravity. In Superman&#39;s absence he slaughtered the Justice League, but the side effects of his gravity manipulation shifted the balance of the entire solar system, killing all human life. The centuries of loneliness and isolation have caused him to regret his mad pursuit of power. He has built a time machine similar to the one he used in <i>The Savage Time</i>, but explains to Superman that he can&#39;t go back to any time where he already exists. When Superman points out that he, Superman, can, he and Savage work together to retrieve a <a href="/wiki/Zero-point_energy" id="w">Zero-point energy</a> generator to power the machine. The radiation from the power source also has the effect of restoring Superman to his full abilities (like a miniature yellow sun). Savage sends Superman back, giving him information to stop his old self&#39;s plan. Superman returns to the present. </p>
<p>In the episode&#39;s last scene, Savage is sitting among the ruins of Metropolis, and watches as the future restores itself. As he sees himself slowly fade from existence, his last words are &#34;<i>Thank you, my friend...</i>&#34;.</p>
<a id="''Smallville''" name="''Smallville''"></a><h3> &#39;&#39;Smallville&#39;&#39; </h3>
<p>In the seventh season of <i><a href="/wiki/Smallville_(TV_Series)" id="w">Smallville</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Dean_Cain" id="w">Dean Cain</a>, who portrayed Superman in <i><a href="/wiki/Lois_%26amp%3B_Clark:_The_New_Adventures_of_Superman" id="w">Lois &#38; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman</a></i>, guest stars as Dr. Curtis Knox, an immortal character very similar to (if not actually in secret) Vandal Savage. Like his comic-book counterpart he has used many different names over his centuries of life, one of which was <a href="/wiki/Napoleon" id="w">Napoleon</a>. When Lex Luthor uses a photo recognition program to track Dr. Knox&#39;s previous identities, he is shown in a photo with Adolf Hitler during World War II, again a nod to the comic book version. Finally, the photos of Knox&#39;s past identities show him with a beard identical to that of Savage. Towards the end of the episode, when he is about to perform surgery on Chloe, she says to him: &#34;I came here for help, not to be cut open by some <a href="/wiki/Jack_The_Ripper" id="w">Jack The Ripper</a> wannabe.&#34; Knox replies: &#34;I <i>was</i> Jack The Ripper.&#34;</p>
