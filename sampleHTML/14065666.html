The <b>Great French Wine Blight</b> was a severe <a href="/wiki/Blight" id="w">blight</a> of the mid-19th century that destroyed many of the <a href="/wiki/Vineyard" id="w">vineyards</a> in <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> and laid to waste the <a href="/wiki/Wine" id="w">wine</a> industry. It was caused by an <a href="/wiki/Aphid" id="w">aphid</a> (the actual genus of the aphid is still debated, although it is largely considered to have been a species of <i><a href="/wiki/Daktulosphaira_vitifoliae" id="w">Daktulosphaira vitifoliae</a></i>, commonly known as <a href="/wiki/Grape_phylloxera" id="w">grape phylloxera</a>) that originated in <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a> and was carried across the Atlantic sometime around the late 1850s. While France is considered to  have been worst affected, the blight also did a great deal of damage to vineyards in other European countries.</p>
<p>How the <i>Phylloxera</i> aphid was introduced to Europe remains debated: American vines had been taken to Europe many times before, for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, without consideration of the possibility of the introduction of pestilence. While the <i>Phylloxera</i> was thought to have arrived sometime around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of <a href="/wiki/Languedoc" id="w">Languedoc</a>. It is argued by some that the introduction of such pests as phylloxera was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed durable pests, such as the <i>Phylloxera</i>, to survive.</p>
<p>Eventually, following <a href="/wiki/Jules-Emile_Planchon" id="w">Jules-Emile Planchon</a>&#39;s discovery of the <i>Phylloxera</i> as the cause of the blight, and <a href="/wiki/Charles_Valentine_Riley" id="w">Charles Valentine Riley</a>&#39;s confirmation of Planchon&#39;s theory, <a href="/wiki/Leo_Laliman" id="w">Leo Laliman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gaston_Bazille" id="w">Gaston Bazille</a>, two French wine growers, proposed that the European vines be <a href="/wiki/Grafting" id="w">grafted</a> to the resistant American rootstock that were not susceptible to the <i>Phylloxera</i>. While many of the French wine growers disliked this idea, many found themselves with no other option. The method proved to be an effective remedy. The following &#34;Reconstitution&#34; (as it was termed) of the many vineyards that had been lost was a slow process, but eventually the wine industry in France was able to return to relative normality.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The grape phylloxera responsible for the failure of the French colonist&#39;s plantations in Florida, and probably the later destroyer of the French wine industry.</div>
The aphid that was the central source of the damage in France was first noted following the growing of the European <a href="/wiki/Vine" id="w">vine</a> <i>Vitis vinifera</i> by French colonists in <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>,<sup id="_ref-vine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vine" title="">[2]</a></sup> in the 16th century. These plantations were a failure, and later experiments with related species of vine also failed, although the reason for these failures appears to have been a mystery to the French colonists. It is known today that it was a species of North American grape phylloxera that caused these early vineyards to fail; the venom injected by the <i>Phylloxera</i> causes a disease that is quickly fatal to the European varieties of vine.<sup id="_ref-vine_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vine" title="">[2]</a></sup> The aphids went relatively unnoticed by the colonists, despite their great numbers, and the pressure and difficulty of successfully starting a vineyard in America at the time.<sup id="_ref-web_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-web" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>It became common knowledge among the settlers that their European vines, of the <i>vinifera.</i> variety, simply would not grow in American soil, and they resorted to growing native American plants, and established plantations of these native vines. Exceptions did exist; <i>vinifera</i> plantations were well-established in <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a> before the aphids found their way there.</p>
<a id="Phylloxera" name="Phylloxera"></a><h2> Phylloxera </h2>
<p>There have been several theories proposed for why the phylloxera was ignored as the possible cause of the disease that resulted in the failure of so many vineyards, most of which involve the feeding behaviour of the insect, and the way it attacks the roots.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Proboscis" id="w">proboscis</a> of the grape phylloxera has both a venom canal from which it injects its deadly venom and a feeding tube through which it takes in vine <a href="/wiki/Sap" id="w">sap</a> and nutrients. As the <a href="/wiki/Toxin" id="w">toxin</a> from the venom corrodes the <a href="/wiki/Root" id="w">root</a> structure of a vine, the sap pressure falls and, as a result, the <i>Phylloxera</i> quickly withdraws its feeding tube and searches for another source of food. Thus, anyone digging up a diseased and dying vine will not find <i>Phylloxera</i> clinging to the roots of the plant.<sup id="_ref-ordish_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ordish" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Journey_to_Europe" name="Journey_to_Europe"></a><h2> Journey to Europe </h2>
<p>For a few centuries, Europeans had experimented with American vines and plants in their soil, and many varieties were imported from America without regulation, disregarding the possibility of pest transfer, and related problems. <a href="/wiki/Jules-Emile_Planchon" id="w">Jules-Emile Planchon</a>, a French <a href="/wiki/Biologist" id="w">biologist</a>, who identified the <i>Phylloxera</i> in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, and this is how the <i>Phylloxera</i> was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-web2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-web2" title="">[7]</a></sup> although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863.<sup id="_ref-viti_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-viti" title="">[8]</a></sup> It is believed that the introduction of the blight-causing <i>Phylloxera</i> was not a problem before the advent of steamships, which were faster and hence allowed the <i>Phylloxera</i> to survive the quicker ocean voyage.<sup id="_ref-web_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-web" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

</p><a id="Initial_appearance" name="Initial_appearance"></a><h2> Initial appearance </h2>
<p>The first known documented instance of an attack by the <i>Phylloxera</i> in France was in a department of the former <a href="/wiki/Province" id="w">province</a> of <a href="/wiki/Languedoc" id="w">Languedoc</a>,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> some time around 1863.<sup id="_ref-viti_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-viti" title="">[8]</a></sup>  The wine makers there did not notice the aphids, just as the French colonists in America had not, but they noted the mysterious blight that was damaging their vines. The only description of the disease that was given by these wine growers was that it &#39;reminded them distressingly of &#34;consumption&#34;&#39;.<sup id="_ref-web_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-web" title="">[3]</a></sup> The blight quickly spread throughout France, but it was several years before the cause of the disease was determined.<sup id="_ref-web_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-web" title="">[3]</a></sup>
<a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Charles_Valentine_Riley_1.jpg" title="Charles Valentine Riley in 1870 confirmed the theory proposed by Planchon."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Valentine_Riley_1.jpg" alt="Charles Valentine Riley in 1870 confirmed the theory proposed by Planchon." title="Charles Valentine Riley in 1870 confirmed the theory proposed by Planchon." class="location-left type-thumb" />

<a id="Damage" name="Damage"></a><h2> Damage </h2>
<p>Over 40% of French grape vines and vineyards were devastated over a 15 year period, from the late 1850s to the mid 1870s. The French economy was badly hit by the blight; many businesses were lost, and wages in the wine industry were cut less than half. There was also a noticeable trend of migration to, among other places, <a href="/wiki/Algiers" id="w">Algiers</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">America</a>. The production of cheap <a href="/wiki/Raisin" id="w">raisins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sugar" id="w">sugar</a> wines caused problems for the domestic industry that threatened to persist even after the blight itself. The damage to the French economy, is estimated to have been slightly over 10 billion <a href="/wiki/Francs" id="w">Francs</a>.<sup id="_ref-web_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-web" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Discovery" name="Discovery"></a><h2> Discovery </h2>
<p>It was not until 1868 that the French biologist <a href="/wiki/Jules-Emile_Planchon" id="w">Jules-Emile Planchon</a> and two colleagues, chanced upon a group of <i>Phylloxera</i> sucking from the roots of a plant that a theory on the blight&#39;s cause by the <i>Phylloxera</i> was formed, and it was not until 1870 that American <a href="/wiki/Entomologist" id="w">entomologist</a> <a href="/wiki/Charles_Valentine_Riley" id="w">Charles Valentine Riley</a> confirmed Planchon&#39;s theory.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Riley was feted as a hero by the French,<sup id="_ref-Allan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Allan" title="">[11]</a></sup> but the reaction to the discovery itself was mixed. Some met the news with optimism: now that the cause had been discovered, and the species identified, it would only be a matter of finding a method of eliminating the aphid. Others disagreed, saying that the insects were an effect of the blight, rather than the source. To complicate matters, the aphid&#39;s life-cycle proved difficult to study, as its lifespan differed from Europe to America.<sup id="_ref-web_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-web" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Solution" name="Solution"></a><h2> Solution </h2>
<p>Many growers resorted to their own methods in attempt to resolve the issue. Chemicals and pesticides were used to no avail. In desperation, some growers positioned toads under each vine, and others allowed their poultry to roam free in the hope they would eat the insects.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> None of these methods was successful.</p>
<p>After Charles Valentine Riley confirmed Planchon&#39;s theory, <a href="/wiki/Leo_Laliman" id="w">Leo Laliman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gaston_Bazille" id="w">Gaston Bazille</a>, two French wine growers, both suggested the possibility that if <i>vinifera</i> vines could be combined, by means of <a href="/wiki/Grafting" id="w">grafting</a>, with the aphid-resistant American vines, then the problem might be solved.</p>
<p>The method was tested, and proved a success.<sup id="_ref-Allan_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Allan" title="">[11]</a></sup> The process was colloquially termed &#34;reconstitution&#34; by French wine growers. The cure for the disease caused a great division in the wine industry: some, who became known as the &#34;chemists&#34;, rejected the grafting solution and persisted with the use of pesticides and chemicals. Those who became grafters were known as &#34;Americanists&#34;, or &#34;wood merchants&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ordish_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ordish" title="">[5]</a></sup> Following the demonstrated success of grafting in the 1870s and 1880s the immense task of &#34;reconstituting&#34; the majority of France&#39;s vineyards began.</p>
<a id="Prize" name="Prize"></a><h4> Prize </h4>
<p>The French government had offered over 320,000 Francs as a reward to whoever could discover a cure for the blight. Having reportedly been the first to suggest the possibility of using the resistant American rootstock, Leo Laliman tried to claim the money, but the French government refused to award it, with the rationale that he had not cured the blight, but rather stopped it from occurring. However, there may have been other reasons for the government denying Laliman the prize: he was mistrusted by several notable parties, and he was thought by many to have originally introduced the pest.<sup id="_ref-web_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-web" title="">[3]</a></sup> It should also be noted that the idea of grafting American rootstock into European vines and other plants was certainly not an original notion by Laliman; according to <a href="/wiki/George_Ordish" id="w">George Ordish</a>, in his 1987 <i>The Great Wine Blight</i>, a <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spanish</a> Ordinance from 1524 had experimented with grafting their vines with <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexican</a> rootstock, to achieve agricultural gain.<sup id="_ref-ordish_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ordish" title="">[5]</a></sup>

<p>There is still no remedy, as such, for the <i>Phylloxera</i>, or the disease it brings with it, and it still poses a substantial threat to any vineyard not planted with grafted rootstock.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> In fact, there is only one European grape vine known to be resistant to the <i>Phylloxera</i>, the <a href="/wiki/Assyrtiko" id="w">Assyrtiko</a> vine, which grows on the <a href="/wiki/Volcano" id="w">volcanic</a> <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greek</a> island of <a href="/wiki/Santorini" id="w">Santorini</a>; it is speculated that the volcanic ash is the source of this resistance.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The events of the Great Wine Blight, and the need for European-American grafting has brought rise to a debate that remains unresolved today: whether self-rooted vines produce better wine than those that are grafted.</p>
