<p>Albrecht Altdorfer made significant developments in <a href="/wiki/Landscape_art" id="w">landscape</a> and <a href="/wiki/Etching" id="w">etching</a>.<sup id="_ref-mus_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mus" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-brit_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brit" title="">[3]</a></sup> He was also an <a href="/wiki/Architect" id="w">architect</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Engraving" id="w">engraver</a>, and the leader of the <a href="/wiki/Danube_school" id="w">Danube school</a> of German painting.<sup id="_ref-mus_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mus" title="">[2]</a></sup>  
He was a near contemporary of <a href="/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer" id="w">Albrecht Dürer</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Matthias_Gr%C3%BCnewald" id="w">Grünewald</a>&#39;s, with the influence of the latter more evident in his art.  The <i>Heavenly Host above the Virgin and Child</i> (see Gallery) in the <a href="/wiki/Isenheim_Altarpiece" id="w">Isenheim Altarpiece</a> has been compared to <i>The Battle of Alexander at Issus</i>. This is shown in <i>The Battle of Alexander at Issus</i> by the strange night sky.<sup id="_ref-mus_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mus" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Altdorfer was one of the first to paint pure landscapes with no figures, though most of his output was more conventional religious scenes.  The <i>Battle of Issus</i>, is atypical in his work, in both its size and subject-matter; both being dictated by the <a href="/wiki/Commission" id="w">commission</a> he was given. However, his style here is a development of that of a number of miniatures of battle-scenes he had done much earlier for <a href="/wiki/Maximilian_I%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor</a> in his <a href="/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript" id="w">illuminated manuscript</a> <i>Triumphal Procession</i> in 1512-14.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>

He signed the painting with a <a href="/wiki/Monogram" id="w">monogram</a> in the lower left hand corner, dating it 1529, and also inscribed it: &#34;<small>ALBRECHT ALTORFER ZU REGENSPVRG FECIT</small>&#34; on the bottom edge of the banner panel in the sky.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

The city of <a href="/wiki/Issus" id="w">Issus</a> was located in southeast <a href="/wiki/Asia_Minor" id="w">Asia Minor</a>, close to where <a href="/wiki/Iskenderum" id="w">Iskenderum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Turkey" id="w">Turkey</a> is situated today.<sup id="_ref-mus_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mus" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Even though the battle took place in modern Turkey, in the painting the <a href="/wiki/Alps" id="w">Alps</a> and what are obviously <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> cities can be clearly made out,<sup id="_ref-mus_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mus" title="">[2]</a></sup> as the amount of the earth that could be seen from a very high view-point is hugely exaggerated.  The battle itself was a tactical triumph for Alexander, and probably his most famous victory.  Modern historians estimate that his Macedonian army lost 7,000 (perhaps 16%) against 30,000 deaths in Darius III&#39;s Persian army. However, the inscriptions on the painting, probably supplied by Aventin, the Bavarian court historian, refer to much larger numbers (see below).<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

The subject is explained in the banner sign hanging down from the sky in the painting, originally in German but replaced at an unknown date by a Latin inscription (presumably with the same text) that translates as: &#34;Alexander the Great defeating the last Darius, after 100,000 infantry and more than 10,000 cavalrymen had been killed amongst the ranks of the Persians. Whilst King Darius was able to flee with no more than 1,000 horsemen, his mother, wife, and children were taken prisoner&#34;.  In addition Alexander and Darius are identified by tiny inscriptions on their harness and chariot respectively, and banners carried by the armies have further inscriptions.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>   The painting was ordered by Duke <a href="/wiki/William_IV%2C_Duke_of_Bavaria" id="w">William IV of Bavaria</a>.<sup id="_ref-Svanberg_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Svanberg" title="">[8]</a></sup> as one of the initial three in a series of eight depicting battles during classical antiquity ordered by William IV (the other two being <a href="/wiki/Hans_Burgkmair" id="w">Hans Burgkmair</a>&#39;s painting of <i><a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Cannae" id="w">Battle of Cannae</a></i>, 216 BC, and <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B6rg_Breu_the_Elder" id="w">Jörg Breu</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Zama" id="w">Battle of Zama</a></i>, 202 BC.)  Five of these paintings are still found in the Pinakothek, while the remaining three are today located in the <a href="/wiki/National_Museum_of_Fine_Arts" id="w">Nationalmuseum</a> in <a href="/wiki/Stockholm" id="w">Stockholm</a>, having been looted by the <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Swedish</a> army in the <a href="/wiki/Thirty_Years_War" id="w">Thirty Years War</a>.  These eight paintings celebrating male heroes were eventually accompanied by eight other paintings celebrating female heroes from both the Bible and antiquity.<sup id="_ref-Svanberg_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Svanberg" title="">[8]</a></sup>  Altdorfer took the commission very seriously, and renounced the office of Major of Regensburg to finish it.  Large scale history painting was very new to Germany at this date, and the great originality of Altdorfer&#39;s vision may benefit from his lack of models to follow.  </p>
<p>The painting was one of many taken back to <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> by <a href="/wiki/Napoleon" id="w">Napoleon</a>, and its fame largely dates from this period.  Supposedly it was hanging in his bathroom at <a href="/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Saint-Cloud" id="w">Saint-Cloud</a> when the <a href="/wiki/Prussia" id="w">Prussians</a> captured it in 1814.  As late as 1740 a German critic had considered it to be by  Albrecht Dürer, despite the two signatures of Altdorfer. The German writer <a href="/wiki/Karl_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Schlegel" id="w">Schlegel</a> was one of many who saw it in the <a href="/wiki/Louvre" id="w">Louvre</a> and marvelled; he called it a &#34;small painted <a href="/wiki/Iliad" id="w">Iliad</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p><div style="wigth:180px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:180px-Albrecht_Altdorfer_002.jpg" title="Detail of the setting sun"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180px-Albrecht_Altdorfer_002.jpg" alt="Detail of the setting sun" title="Detail of the setting sun" class="location-right type-thumb" width="180px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Detail of the setting sun</div></div>

Behind the huge armies are the mountains of <a href="/wiki/Asia_Minor" id="w">Asia Minor</a> in front of the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea" id="w">Mediterranean Sea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cyprus" id="w">Cyprus</a>.  In the background are <a href="/wiki/Palestine" id="w">Palestine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sinai" id="w">Sinai</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" id="w">Red Sea</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a> with the meandering <a href="/wiki/Nile" id="w">Nile River</a> heading for the <a href="/wiki/Nile_Delta" id="w">Nile Delta</a> in front of the gently bent horizon and the dramatic setting sun. In the upper left corner is the <a href="/wiki/Crescent_moon" id="w">crescent moon</a> hanging over the Persian king fleeing the scene in his chariot, a reference to the &#34;people of the crescent moon&#34;, e.g. the <a href="/wiki/Turkish_people" id="w">Turks</a>.  The presence of the two celestial bodies reflects the cosmic dimensions ascribed to the battle, and supported by a Biblical quote (<a href="/wiki/Book_of_Daniel" id="w">Daniel 7</a>) describing the event as a part of God&#39;s plan for mankind - where the kingdom of Alexander the Great was succeeded by the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Roman Empire</a>, in turn succeeded by  the German <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" id="w">Holy Roman Empire</a>.  The entire painting is thus an exhortation to the <a href="/wiki/German_Emperor" id="w">German Emperor</a> in the 16th century to crush the Turks <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Vienna" id="w">then threatening Vienna</a>.<sup id="_ref-Svanberg_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Svanberg" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Altdorfer has attempted to represent the historical accounts he had of the number of soldiers present at the battle, and the two armies become masses of people, so that the two opposing forces cannot be told apart.  The <a href="/wiki/Armour" id="w">armour</a> that most or all of the soldiers wear is unmistakably that of the 16th century.<sup id="_ref-mus_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mus" title="">[2]</a></sup> The work uses a complex and impossible <a href="/wiki/Bird%26%2339%3Bs-eye_view" id="w">bird&#39;s-eye view</a>, which starts relatively close to the ground at the front of the painting, but is clearly at <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle" id="w">Space Shuttle</a> height for the background.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Though the <a href="/wiki/Tower_of_Babel" id="w">Tower of Babel</a> (near left edge), the <a href="/wiki/Pyramids_of_Egypt" id="w">Pyramids of Egypt</a> and probably the <a href="/wiki/Temple_of_Jerusalem" id="w">Temple of Jerusalem</a> are represented, most of the buildings make no attempt to reflect ancient architecture, and are extravagant imaginary buildings in a German Renaissance style.</p>
