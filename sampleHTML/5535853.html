The <b>East Norwalk</b> <a href="/wiki/Metro-North_Railroad" id="w">Metro-North Railroad</a> station is one of three <a href="/wiki/New_Haven_Line_(Metro-North)" id="w">New Haven Line</a> stations serving the residents of <a href="/wiki/Norwalk%2C_Connecticut" id="w">Norwalk, Connecticut</a>.  It is located in the neighborhood of <a href="/wiki/East_Norwalk" id="w">East Norwalk</a>, from which it derives its name.</p>
<p>East Norwalk is 42 miles from <a href="/wiki/Grand_Central_Terminal" id="w">Grand Central Terminal</a> and the average travel time from Grand Central is 63 minutes though this varies depending on run and time of day.</p>
<p>The station has 231 parking spaces, 147 owned by the state.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The small station lies between the much larger <a href="/wiki/Westport_(Metro-North_station)" id="w">Westport</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Norwalk_(Metro-North_station)" id="w">South Norwalk</a> stations. Like many train stations, access from one side of the tracks to the other is under a bridge that crosses a nearby street. Unlike other stations, the sides of the station are also across that street (busy East Avenue), making the walk a bit more difficult, slow and dangerous. The walkway under the East Avenue railroad bridge is narrow, making it difficult for people walking in opposite directions to pass each other. (See: <a href="/wiki/Image:NorwalkCTEaNorRRstaBridge11172007.JPG" id="w">Image:NorwalkCTEaNorRRstaBridge11172007.JPG</a>)</p>
<p>An inscribed stone on the sidewalk by the station entrance states: &#34;Norwalk Founded A.D. 1648. Its earliest homes were planted in the near vicinity of this stone. First meeting house directly opposite. West. Erected by the Norwalk chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. 1895.&#34; The meeting house would have been across the street from the station entrance, where a gray house stands today.</p>
