<a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" id="w">Immanuel Kant</a>, writing in 1790, observes of a man  &#34;If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to <i>me</i>,&#34; because &#34;Everyone has his own (sense of) taste&#34;. The case of &#34;beauty&#34; is different from mere &#34;agreeableness&#34; because, &#34;If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things.&#34;<sup id="_ref-kant_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kant" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Aesthetic judgments usually go beyond sensory discrimination. For <a href="/wiki/David_Hume" id="w">David Hume</a>, delicacy of taste is not merely &#34;the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition&#34;, but also our sensitivity &#34;to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind.&#34;<sup id="_ref-hume_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hume" title="">[2]</a></sup> Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for pleasure. For Kant &#34;enjoyment&#34; is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but judging something to be &#34;beautiful&#34; has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation.<sup id="_ref-kant_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kant" title="">[1]</a></sup> Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional, and intellectual all at once.</p>
<p>Viewer interpretations of beauty possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste.  Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty.  Taste is a result of education and awareness of elite cultural values; therefore taste can be learned.  Taste varies according to class, cultural background, and education.  Poor taste is usually seen as a product of ignorance.  According to Kant beauty is objective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone.  The contemporary view of beauty is not based on innate qualities, but rather on cultural specifics and individual interpretations.  Therefore, beauty is in the eye of the beholder according to contemporary views.    
</p><a id="What_factors_are_involved_in_an_aesthetic_judgment%3F" name="What_factors_are_involved_in_an_aesthetic_judgment%3F"></a><h2>What factors are involved in an aesthetic judgment?</h2>
<p>Judgments of aesthetic value seem to often involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in instinctual ways to facial expressions, and even behaviors like the gag reflex. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man&#39;s beard is disgusting even though neither soup nor beards are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. Seeing a <a href="/wiki/Sublime_(philosophy)" id="w">sublime</a> view of a landscape may give us a reaction of awe, which might manifest physically as an increased heart rate or widened eyes. These subconscious reactions may even be partly constitutive of what makes our judgment a judgment that the landscape is sublime.</p>
<p>Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. Victorians in Britain often saw African sculpture as ugly, but just a few decades later, Edwardian audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful.<sup id="_ref-danto_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-danto" title="">[3]</a></sup> Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to sexual desirability. Thus, judgments of aesthetic value can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or moral value.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> We might judge a <a href="/wiki/Lamborghini" id="w">Lamborghini</a> to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.<sup id="_ref-aestbq_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aestbq" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem to often be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that will and desire were almost dormant in aesthetic experience<sup id="_ref-date1911_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-date1911" title="">[7]</a></sup> yet preference and choice have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th century thinkers.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behavior, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.<sup id="_ref-aestbq_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aestbq" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Anthropology" id="w">Anthropology</a>, especially the <i><a href="/wiki/Savanna_theory" id="w">savanna hypothesis</a></i> proposed by <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Orians" id="w">Gordon Orians</a> and others, predicts that some of the positive aesthetics that people have are based on innate knowledge of productive human habitats. The Savanna hypothesis
is confirmed by evidence. It had been shown that people prefer and feel happier looking at trees with spreading forms much more than looking at trees with other forms, or non-tree objects; also Bright <a href="/wiki/Green" id="w">green</a> colors, linked with healthy plants with good nutrient qualities, were more calming than other tree colors, including less bright greens and oranges.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Are_different_art_forms_beautiful%2C_disgusting%2C_or_boring_in_the_same_way%3F" name="Are_different_art_forms_beautiful%2C_disgusting%2C_or_boring_in_the_same_way%3F"></a><h2>Are different art forms beautiful, disgusting, or boring in the same way?</h2>
<p>A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgment is how they are unified across art forms. We can call a person, a house, a symphony, a fragrance, and a <a href="/wiki/Mathematical_proof" id="w">mathematical proof</a> beautiful. What characteristics do they share which give them that status? What possible feature could a proof and a fragrance both share in virtue of which they both count as beautiful? What makes a painting beautiful may be quite different from what makes music beautiful, which suggests that each art form has its own system for the judgement of aesthetics.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, there is seemingly quite a lack of words to express oneself accurately when making a judgement of such proportions. Therefore, due to impossibility for precision, there is much confusion about what interpretations should be so officially excepted. In the inaccuracy of the English language, two completely different feelings derived from two extraordinarily different people are likely to represented by an identical expression.</p>
<p>A collective identification of beauty, in the willing participants found in a given social spectrum, is at times perhaps a conditioned response, built into a culture or context. Is there some underlying unity to aesthetic judgment and is there some way to articulate the similarities of a beautiful house, beautiful proof, and beautiful sunset?<sup id="_ref-kant_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kant" title="">[1]</a></sup> Likewise there has been long debate on how perception of beauty in the natural world, especially including perceiving the human form as beautiful, is supposed to relate to perceiving beauty in <a href="/wiki/Art" id="w">art</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cultural_artifact" id="w">artifacts</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

It is not uncommon to find aesthetics used as a synonym for the philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Art" id="w">art</a>, although it is also not uncommon to find thinkers insisting that we distinguish these two closely related fields. In practise we distinguish between aesthetic and artistic judgements, one refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an art object), whilst the other refers to the appreciation or criticism of an art work.</p>
<a id="What_counts_as_%22art%3F%22" name="What_counts_as_%22art%3F%22"></a><h2>What counts as &#34;art?&#34;</h2>
<p>How best to define the term “art” is a subject of much contention; many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the basics of what we mean by the term “art”.<sup id="_ref-davies_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-davies" title="">[12]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Theodor_Adorno" id="w">Theodor Adorno</a> claimed in 1969 “It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident any more.”<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists and programmers all use the notion of art in their respective fields, and give it operational definitions that are not very similar to each other. Further it is clear that even the basic meaning of the term &#34;<a href="/wiki/Art" id="w">art</a>&#34; has changed several times over the centuries, and has changed within the 20th century as well. </p>
<p>The main recent sense of the word “art” is roughly as an abbreviation for <b><i>creative art</i></b> or “<a href="/wiki/Fine_art" id="w">fine art</a>.” Here we mean that skill is being used to express the artist’s creativity, or to engage the audience’s aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of the “finer” things. Often, if the skill is being used in a lowbrow or practical way, people will consider it a <a href="/wiki/Craft" id="w">craft</a> instead of art, yet many thinkers have defended practical and lowbrow forms as being just as much art as the more lofty forms. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way it may be considered <a href="/wiki/Design" id="w">design</a> instead of art, or contrariwise these may be defended as art forms, perhaps called <a href="/wiki/Applied_art" id="w">applied art</a>. Some thinkers, for instance, have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even as late as 1912 it was normal in the West to assume that all art aims at beauty, and thus that anything that wasn&#39;t trying to be beautiful couldn&#39;t count as art. The <a href="/wiki/Cubism" id="w">cubists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dada" id="w">dadaists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky" id="w">Stravinsky</a>, and many later art movements struggled against this conception that beauty was central to the definition of art, with such success that, according to <a href="/wiki/Danto" id="w">Danto</a>, “Beauty had disappeared not only from the advanced art of the 1960’s but from the advanced philosophy of art of that decade as well.”<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Perhaps some notion like “expression” (in <a href="/wiki/Benedetto_Croce" id="w">Croce’s</a> theories) or “counter-environment” (in <a href="/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan" id="w">McLuhan’s</a> theory) can replace the previous role of beauty. </p>
<p>Perhaps (as in <a href="/wiki/William_Kennick" id="w">Kennick&#39;s</a> theory) no definition of art is possible anymore. Perhaps art should be thought of as a cluster of related concepts in a <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein" id="w">Wittgensteinian</a> fashion (as in <a href="/wiki/Morris_Weitz" id="w">Weitz</a> or <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Beuys" id="w">Beuys</a>). Another approach is to say that “art” is basically a sociological category, that whatever art schools and museums and artists get away with is considered art regardless of formal definitions. This &#34;institutional definition of art&#34; (see also <a href="/wiki/Institutional_Critique" id="w">Institutional Critique</a>) has been championed by <a href="/wiki/George_Dickie" id="w">George Dickie</a>. Most people did not consider the depiction of a <a href="/wiki/Brillo" id="w">Brillo Box</a> or a store-bought <a href="/wiki/Urinal" id="w">urinal</a> to be art until <a href="/wiki/Andy_Warhol" id="w">Andy Warhol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp" id="w">Marcel Duchamp</a> (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the <a href="/wiki/Art_gallery" id="w">art gallery</a>), which then provided the association of these objects with the values that define art. </p>
<p>Proceduralists often suggest that it is the process by which a work of art is created or viewed that makes it art, not any inherent feature of an object, or how well received it is by the institutions of the art world after its introduction to society at large. For <a href="/wiki/John_Dewey" id="w">John Dewey</a>, for instance, if the writer intended a piece to be a poem, it is one whether other poets acknowledge it or not. Whereas if exactly the same set of words was written by a journalist, intending them as shorthand notes to help him write a longer article later, these would not be a poem. <a href="/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy" id="w">Leo Tolstoy</a>, on the other hand, claims that what makes something art or not is how it is experienced by its audience, not by the intention of its creator. Functionalists like <a href="/wiki/Monroe_Beardsley" id="w">Monroe Beardsley</a> argue that whether or not a piece counts as art depends on what function it plays in a particular context; the same Greek vase may play a non-artistic function in one context (carrying wine), and an artistic function in another context (helping us to appreciate the beauty of the human figure). &#39;</p>

Art can be tricky at the metaphysical and <a href="/wiki/Ontological" id="w">ontological</a> levels as well as at the <a href="/wiki/Value_theory" id="w">value theory</a> level. When we see a performance of <i><a href="/wiki/Hamlet" id="w">Hamlet</a></i>, how many works of art are we experiencing, and which should we judge? Perhaps there is only one relevant work of art, the whole performance, which many different people have contributed to, and which will exist briefly and then disappear. Perhaps the manuscript by Shakespeare is a distinct work of art from the play by the troupe, which is also distinct from the performance of the play by this troupe on this night, and all three can be judged, but are to be judged by different standards. </p>
<p>Perhaps every person involved should be judged separately on his or her own merits, and each costume or line is its own work of art (with perhaps the director having the job of unifying them all). Similar problems arise for music, film and even painting. Am I to judge the painting itself, the work of the painter, or perhaps the painting in its context of presentation by the museum workers?</p>
<p>These problems have been made even thornier by the rise of <a href="/wiki/Conceptual_art" id="w">conceptual art</a> since the 1960s. Warhol’s famous <a href="/wiki/Brillo" id="w">Brillo Boxes</a> are nearly indistinguishable from actual Brillo boxes at the time. It would be a mistake to praise Warhol for the design of his boxes (which were designed by Steve Harvey), yet the conceptual move of exhibiting these boxes as art in a museum together with other kinds of paintings is Warhol&#39;s. Are we judging Warhol’s concept? His execution of the concept in the medium? The <a href="/wiki/Curator" id="w">curator</a>’s insight in letting Warhol display the boxes? The overall result? Our experience or interpretation of the result? Ontologically, how are we to think of the work of art? Is it a physical object? Several objects? A class of objects? A mental object? A fictional object? An abstract object? An event?</p>
<a id="What_should_art_be_like%3F" name="What_should_art_be_like%3F"></a><h2>What should art be like?</h2>
<p>Many goals have been argued for art, and aestheticians often argue that some goal or another is superior in some way. <a href="/wiki/Clement_Greenberg" id="w">Clement Greenberg</a>, for instance, argued in 1960 that each artistic medium should seek that which makes it unique among the possible mediums and then purify itself of anything other than expression of its own uniqueness as a form.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Dada" id="w">Dadaist</a> <a href="/wiki/Tristan_Tzara" id="w">Tristan Tzara</a> on the other hand saw the function of art in 1918 as the destruction of a mad social order. “We must sweep and clean. Affirm the cleanliness of the individual after the state of madness, aggressive complete madness of a world abandoned to the hands of bandits.”<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Formal goals, creative goals, self-expression, political goals, spiritual goals, philosophical goals, and even more perceptual or aesthetic goals have all been popular pictures of what art should be like.</p>
<a id="What_is_the_value_of_art%3F" name="What_is_the_value_of_art%3F"></a><h2>What is the value of art?</h2>
<p>Closely related to the question of what art should be like is the question of what its value is. Is art a means of gaining knowledge of some special kind? Does it give insight into the human condition? How does art relate to <a href="/wiki/Science" id="w">science</a> or <a href="/wiki/Religion" id="w">religion</a>? Is art perhaps a tool of education, or indoctrination, or enculturation? Does art make us more moral? Can it uplift us spiritually? Is art perhaps politics by other means? Is there some value to sharing or expressing emotions? Might the value of art for the artist be quite different than it is for the audience? </p>
<p>Might the value of art to society be quite different than its value to individuals? Do the values of arts differ significantly from form to form? Working on the intended value of art tends to help define the relations between art and other endeavors. Art clearly does have spiritual goals in many settings, but then what exactly is the difference between religious art and religion <i>per se</i>? Is every religious ritual a piece of performance art, so that religious ritual is simply a subset of art?</p>

<a id="Aesthetic_universals" name="Aesthetic_universals"></a><h1>Aesthetic universals</h1>
<p>The philosopher <a href="/wiki/Denis_Dutton" id="w">Denis Dutton</a> identified seven universal signatures in human aesthetics:<sup id="_ref-Dutton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dutton" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

<ol>
<li>Expertise or virtuosity.  Technical artistic skills are cultivated, recognized, and admired.</li>
<li>Nonutilitarian pleasure.  People enjoy art for art&#39;s sake, and don&#39;t demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.</li>
<li>Style.  Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.</li>
<li>Criticism.  People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.</li>
<li>Imitation.  With a few important exceptions like music and abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.</li>
<li>Special focus.  Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.</li>
<li>Imagination.  Artists and their audiences entertain hypothetical worlds in the theater of the imagination.</li></ol>
<p>It might be objected, however, that there are rather too many exceptions to Dutton&#39;s categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hirschhorn" id="w">Thomas Hirschhorn</a> deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance Madonna for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. &#39;Rules of composition&#39; that might be read into <a href="/wiki/Duchamp" id="w">Duchamp</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Fountain" id="w">Fountain</a></i> or <a href="/wiki/John_Cage" id="w">John Cage</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/4%26%2339%3B33%26quot%3B" id="w">4&#39;33&#34;</a></i> do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works&#39; realisation). Moreover, some of Dutton&#39;s categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory.</p>
<p>Increasingly, academics in both the sciences and the humanities are looking to <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology" id="w">evolutionary psychology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_science" id="w">cognitive science</a> in an effort to understand the connection between psychology and aesthetics.

</p><a id="Ancient_aesthetics" name="Ancient_aesthetics"></a><h2>Ancient aesthetics</h2>
<p>We have examples of <a href="/wiki/Pre-historic_art" id="w">pre-historic art</a>, but they are rare, and the context of their production and use is not very clear, so we can little more than guess at the aesthetic doctrines that guided their production and interpretation.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ancient_art" id="w">Ancient art</a> was largely, but not entirely, based on the six great ancient civilizations: <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" id="w">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" id="w">Greece</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Rome</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Persia" id="w">Persia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a>. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Greece had the most influence on the development of aesthetics in the West. This period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of corresponding skills to show musculature, poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. Furthermore, in many Western and Eastern cultures alike, traits such as body hair are rarely depicted in art that addresses physical beauty and can therefore be said to be somewhat universal in issues of taste in relation to beauty.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" id="w">Greek</a> philosophers initially felt that aesthetically appealing objects were beautiful in and of themselves. <a href="/wiki/Plato" id="w">Plato</a> felt that beautiful objects incorporated proportion, <a href="/wiki/Harmony" id="w">harmony</a>, and unity among their parts. Similarly, in the <i><a href="/wiki/Metaphysics_(Aristotle)" id="w">Metaphysics</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" id="w">Aristotle</a> found that the universal elements of beauty were order, <a href="/wiki/Symmetry" id="w">symmetry</a>, and definiteness.</p>
<a id="Aesthetics_by_origin" name="Aesthetics_by_origin"></a><h1> Aesthetics by origin </h1>
<a id="Islamic_aesthetics" name="Islamic_aesthetics"></a><h2>Islamic aesthetics</h2>

<p>Islamic art is not, properly speaking, an art pertaining to religion only. The term &#34;<a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Islamic</a>&#34; refers not only to the religion, but to any form of art create in an Islamic culture or in an Islamic context. It would also be a mistake to assume that all Muslims are in agreement on the use of art in religious observance, the proper place of art in society, or the relation between secular art and the demands placed on the secular world to conform to religious precepts.  Islamic art frequently adopts secular elements and elements that are frowned upon, if not forbidden, by some Islamic theologians.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> </p>
<p>According to Islam, human works of art are inherently flawed compared to the work of Allah; thus, it is believed that to attempt to depict in a realistic form any animal or person is insolence to Allah. This tendency, enforced by often strict religious authority, has had the effect of narrowing the field of artistic possibility to such forms of art as mosaic, calligraphy, and architecture, as well as more generally any form of abstraction that can claim the status of non-representational art. </p>
<p>This negative restriction of possibilities has been explored by artists as an outlet to artistic expression, and has been cultivated to become a positive style and tradition, emphasizing the decorative function of art, or its religious functions via non-representational forms such as Geometric patterns, floral patterns, <a href="/wiki/Arabesques" id="w">arabesques</a>.  </p>
<p>It is a common myth that human or animal depiction is forbidden altogether in Islamic cultures. In fact, human portrayals can be found in all Islamic cultures with varying degrees of acceptance by religious authorities. It is only human representation for the purpose of worship that is uniformly considered <a href="/wiki/Idolatry" id="w">idolatry</a> as forbidden in <i><a href="/wiki/Sharia" id="w">Sharia</a></i> law. There are also many <a href="/wiki/Depictions_of_Muhammad" id="w">depictions of Muhammad</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mohammed" id="w">Islam&#39;s chief prophet</a>, in historical Islamic art.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The calligraphic arts grew out an effort to devote oneself to the study of the Koran. By patiently transcribing each word of the text, the writer was made to contemplate the meaning of it. As time passed, these calligraphic works began to be prized as works of art, growing increasingly elaborate in the illumination and stylizing of the text. These illuminations were applied to other works besides the Koran, and it became a respected art form in and of itself.</p>
<a id="Indian_aesthetics" name="Indian_aesthetics"></a><h2>Indian aesthetics</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Indian_art" id="w">Indian art</a> evolved with an emphasis on inducing special spiritual or philosophical states in the audience, or with representing them symbolically. According to <a href="/wiki/Kapila_Vatsyayan" id="w">Kapila Vatsyayan</a>, &#34;Classical <a href="/wiki/Indian_architecture" id="w">Indian architecture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indian_sculpture" id="w">sculpture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indian_painting" id="w">painting</a>, <a href="/wiki/Indian_literature" id="w">literature</a> (kaavya), <a href="/wiki/Music_of_India" id="w">music</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Indian_dance" id="w">dancing</a> evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail.&#34; In an <a href="/wiki/Ancient_India" id="w">ancient Indian</a> work <a href="/wiki/N%C4%81tyas%C4%81stra" id="w">Nātyasāstra</a> by <a href="/wiki/Bharata_Muni" id="w">Bharata Muni</a>, 9 forms of artistic expression are defined as <a href="/wiki/Navarasa" id="w">navarasas</a>.</p>
<a id="Chinese_aesthetics" name="Chinese_aesthetics"></a><h2>Chinese aesthetics</h2>

<p><a href="/wiki/Chinese_art" id="w">Chinese art</a> has a long history of varied styles and emphases. In ancient times philosophers were already arguing about aesthetics. <a href="/wiki/Confucius" id="w">Confucius</a> emphasized the role of the arts and humanities (especially music and poetry) in broadening human nature and aiding “li” (etiquette, the rites) in bringing us back to what is essential about humanity. His opponent <a href="/wiki/Mozi" id="w">Mozi</a>, however, argued that music and fine arts were classist and wasteful, benefiting the rich but not the common people. </p>
<p>By the 4th century CE, artists were debating in writing over the proper goals of art as well. <a href="/wiki/Gu_Kaizhi" id="w">Gu Kaizhi</a> has 3 surviving books on this theory of painting, for example, and it&#39;s not uncommon to find later artist/scholars who both create art and write about the creating of art. Religious and philosophical influence on art was common (and diverse) but never universal; it is easy to find art that largely ignores philosophy and religion in almost every Chinese time period.</p>

<a href="/wiki/African_art" id="w">African art</a> existed in many forms and styles, and with fairly little influence from outside <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a>. Most of it followed traditional forms and the aesthetic norms were handed down orally as well as written. <a href="/wiki/Sculpture" id="w">Sculpture</a> and <a href="/wiki/Performance_art" id="w">performance art</a> are prominent, and abstract and partially abstracted forms are valued, and were valued long before influence from the Western tradition began in earnest.

<a id="Western_medieval_aesthetics" name="Western_medieval_aesthetics"></a><h2>Western medieval aesthetics</h2>

<p>Surviving <a href="/wiki/Medieval_art" id="w">medieval art</a> is highly religious in focus, and typically was funded by the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Church</a>, powerful ecclesiastical individuals, or wealthy secular patrons. Often the pieces have an intended liturgical function, such as altar pieces or statuary. Figurative examination was typically not an important goal, but being religiously uplifting was. </p>
<p>Reflection on the nature and function of art and aesthetic experiences follows similar lines. St. <a href="/wiki/Bonaventure" id="w">Bonaventure</a>’s “Retracing the Arts to Theology” is typical and discusses the skills of the artisan as gifts given by God for the purpose of disclosing God to mankind via four “lights”: the light of skill in mechanical arts which discloses the world of artifacts, as guided by the light of sense perception which discloses the world of natural forms, as guided by the light of philosophy which discloses the world of intellectual truth, as guided by the light of divine wisdom which discloses the world of saving truth.</p>

As the medieval world shifts into the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" id="w">Renaissance</a>, art again returns to focus on this world and on secular issues of human life. The philosophy of art of the ancient Greeks and Romans is re-appropriated.</p>
<a id="Modern_aesthetics" name="Modern_aesthetics"></a><h1>Modern aesthetics</h1>
<p>From the late 17th to the early 20th century Western aesthetics underwent a slow revolution into what is often called <a href="/wiki/Modernism" id="w">modernism</a>. <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> thinkers emphasised <a href="/wiki/Beauty" id="w">beauty</a> as the key component of art and of the aesthetic experience, and saw art as necessarily aiming at beauty. </p>
<p>For <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Gottlieb_Baumgarten" id="w">Baumgarten</a> aesthetics is the science of the sense experiences, a younger sister of logic, and beauty is thus the most perfect kind of knowledge that sense experience can have. For <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" id="w">Kant</a> the aesthetic experience of beauty is a judgment of a subjective but universal truth, since all people should agree that “this <a href="/wiki/Rose" id="w">rose</a> is beautiful” if it in fact is. However, beauty cannot be reduced to any more basic set of features. For <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Schiller" id="w">Schiller</a> aesthetic appreciation of beauty is the most perfect reconciliation of the sensual and rational parts of human nature. </p>
<p>For <a href="/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" id="w">Hegel</a> all culture is a matter of &#34;absolute spirit&#34; coming to be manifest to itself, stage by stage. Art is the first stage in which the absolute spirit is manifest immediately to sense-perception, and is thus an objective rather than subjective revelation of beauty. For <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" id="w">Schopenhauer</a> aesthetic contemplation of beauty is the most free that the pure intellect can be from the dictates of will; here we contemplate perfection of form without any kind of worldly agenda, and thus any intrusion of utility or politics would ruin the point of the beauty. </p>
<p>The British were largely divided into intuitionist and analytic camps. The intuitionists believed that aesthetic experience was disclosed by a single mental faculty of some kind. For the <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Shaftesbury" id="w">Earl of Shaftesbury</a> this was identical to the moral sense, beauty just is the sensory version of moral goodness. </p>
<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:William_Hogarth_006.jpg" title="[[William Hogarth]], self-portrait, 1745"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hogarth_006.jpg" alt="[[William Hogarth]], self-portrait, 1745" title="[[William Hogarth]], self-portrait, 1745" class="location-none type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption"><a href="/wiki/William_Hogarth" id="w">William Hogarth</a>, self-portrait, 1745</div>
For <a href="/wiki/Francis_Hutcheson_(philosopher)" id="w">Hutcheson</a> beauty is disclosed by an inner mental sense, but is a subjective fact rather than an objective one. Analytic theorists like <a href="/wiki/Lord_Kames" id="w">Lord Kames</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Hogarth" id="w">William Hogarth</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Burke" id="w">Edmund Burke</a> hoped to reduce beauty to some list of attributes. Hogarth, for example, thinks that beauty consists of (1) fitness of the parts to some design; (2) variety in as many ways as possible; (3) uniformity, regularity or symmetry, which is only beautiful when it helps to preserve the character of fitness; (4) simplicity or distinctness, which gives pleasure not in itself, but through its enabling the eye to enjoy variety with ease; (5) intricacy, which provides employment for our active energies, leading the eye &#34;a wanton kind of chase&#34;; and (6) quantity or magnitude, which draws our attention and produces admiration and awe. Later analytic aestheticians strove to link beauty to some scientific theory of psychology (such as <a href="/wiki/James_Mill" id="w">James Mill</a>) or biology (such as <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Spencer" id="w">Herbert Spencer</a>).</p>
<a id="Post-modern_aesthetics_and_Psychoanalysis" name="Post-modern_aesthetics_and_Psychoanalysis"></a><h1>Post-modern aesthetics and Psychoanalysis</h1>
<p>Early twentieth century artists, poets and composers challenged the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics. Various attempts have been made since then to define Post-modern aesthetics.</p>
<p>This challenge, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify &#34;beauty&#34; into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the Rococo.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Benedetto_Croce" id="w">Croce</a> suggested that “expression” is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. <a href="/wiki/George_Dickie" id="w">George Dickie</a> suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities. <a href="/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan" id="w">Marshall McLuhan</a> suggested that art always functions as a &#34;counter-environment&#34; designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society. <a href="/wiki/Theodor_Adorno" id="w">Theodor Adorno</a> felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. <a href="/wiki/Hal_Foster_(art_critic)" id="w">Hal Foster (art critic)</a> attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in <i>The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture</i>. <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Danto" id="w">Arthur Danto</a> has described this reaction as &#34;kalliphobia&#34; (after the Greek word for beauty - &#39;kalos&#39;).<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Brian_Massumi" id="w">Brian Massumi</a> suggests to reconsider <a href="/wiki/Beauty" id="w">beauty</a> following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Deleuze" id="w">Deleuze</a> and <a href="/wiki/Guattari" id="w">Guattari</a>.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Film" id="w">Film</a> combines many diverse disciplines, each of which may have their own rules of aesthetics. The aesthetics of <a href="/wiki/Cinematography" id="w">cinematography</a> are closely related to still <a href="/wiki/Photography" id="w">photography</a>, but the movement of the subject(s), or the camera and the intensities, colors, and placement of the <a href="/wiki/Lighting" id="w">lighting</a> are highly important. <a href="/wiki/Sound_recording" id="w">Sound recording</a>, editing, and mixing are other, highly important areas of film, often closely related with the <a href="/wiki/Musical_score" id="w">musical score</a>. As in <a href="/wiki/Theatre" id="w">Theatre</a>, <a href="/wiki/Art_direction" id="w">art direction</a>, in the design of the sets and shooting locations also applies, as well as <a href="/wiki/Costume_design" id="w">costume design</a> and <a href="/wiki/Makeup" id="w">makeup</a>. All of these disciplines are closely inter-twined and must be brought together by the aesthetic sensibilities of the <a href="/wiki/Film_director" id="w">director</a>. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Montage_sequence" id="w">Montage</a>, or editing is probably the one discipline unique to film, video, and television. The timing, rhythm and progression of shots form the ultimate composition of the film. This procedure is one of the most critical element of <a href="/wiki/Post_production" id="w">post production</a>, and incorporates sound editing and mixing, as well as the design and execution of digital <a href="/wiki/Special_effects" id="w">special effects</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of a <a href="/wiki/Video_installation" id="w">video installation</a>, the method of presentation becomes critical. The work may be screened on a simple <a href="/wiki/Monitor" id="w">monitor</a>, projected on a wall or other surface, or incorporated into a larger sculptural installation. A video installation may also involve sound, with similar considerations to be made based on speaker design and placement, volume, and tone.</p>
<a id="Two-Dimensional_and_Plastic_Arts" name="Two-Dimensional_and_Plastic_Arts"></a><h2>Two-Dimensional and Plastic Arts</h2>
<p>Aesthetic considerations within the <a href="/wiki/Visual_arts" id="w">visual arts</a> are usually associated with the sense of <a href="/wiki/Visual_perception" id="w">vision</a>. A painting or sculpture, however, is also perceived spatially by recognized associations and context, and even to some extent by the senses of smell, hearing, and touch. The form of the work can be subject to an aesthetic as much as the content.</p>
<p>In painting, the aesthetic convention that we see a three-dimensional representation rather than a two-dimensional canvas is so well understood that most people do not realize that they are making an aesthetic interpretation. This notion is the basis of <a href="/wiki/Abstract_impressionism" id="w">abstract impressionism</a>. </p>
<p>In the United States during the postwar period, the &#34;push-pull&#34; theories of <a href="/wiki/Hans_Hofmann" id="w">Hans Hofmann</a>, positing a relation between color and perceived depth, strongly influenced a generation of prominent abstract painters, many of whom studied under Hofmann and were generally associated with <a href="/wiki/Abstract_expressionism" id="w">abstract expressionism</a>. Hofmann&#39;s general attitude toward abstraction as virtually a moral imperative for the serious painter was also extremely influential.</p>
<p>Some aesthetic effects available in visual arts include variation, juxtaposition, repetition, field effects, symmetry/asymmetry, perceived mass, subliminal structure, linear dynamics, tension and repose, pattern, contrast, perspective, 3 dimensionality, movement, rhythm, unity/Gestalt, matrixiality and proportion.</p>
<a id="Digital_Art" name="Digital_Art"></a><h2>Digital Art</h2>

<p>A new art form struggling for acceptance is <a href="/wiki/Digital_art" id="w">digital art</a>, a by-product of computer programming that raises new questions about what truly constitutes art.  Although paralleling many of the aesthetics in traditional media, digital art can additionally draw upon the aesthetic qualities of cross-media tactile relationships; interactivity; autonomous generativity; complexity and interdependence of relationships; suspense; and playfulness. </p>
<p>Artists working in this type of art are often forced to justify their use of a computer rather than a traditional medium, leading to, like the debate over Warhol&#39;s &#34;Brillo Pad Boxes&#34;, a question of what constitutes art.</p>
<p>The criticisms of digital art are many. For example, graphics programs allow perfect shading to be achieved with little to no effort. In other types of programs, there is a sense that because of the variety of tools, filters, distortions, ect, that an artist has a veritable image factory at their disposal. The various criticisms ultimately come down to the issue of &#34;what effort is the artist putting into their work?&#34;</p>
<p>The 3d art community frequently references that while the programs they utilize render and shade the objects, their efforts are more akin to the sculptor or architect, presenting an aesthetically arranged, lighted, and textured scene. The users of the other programs such as Photoshop or Gimp point out that while they may have many tools at their disposal, the art itself must be that much more detailed and imaginative to stand out. In both cases there is the challenge of overcoming the barriers of limited technology and the lack of direct contact with one&#39;s medium.</p>
<a id="Maps" name="Maps"></a><h2>Maps</h2>
<p>Aesthetics in cartography relates to the visual experience of map reading and can take two forms: responses to the map itself as an aesthetic object (e.g., through detail, colour, and form) and also the subject of the map symbolised, often the landscape (e.g., a particular expression of terrain which forms an imagined visual experience of the aesthetic). </p>
<p>Cartographers make aesthetic judgments when designing maps to ensure that the content forms a clear expression of the theme(s). Antique maps are perhaps especially revered due to their aesthetic value, which may seem to be derived from their styles of ornamentation. As such, aesthetics are often wrongly considered to be a by-product of design. If it is taken that aesthetic judgments are produced within a certain social context, they are fundamental to the cartographer&#39;s symbolisation and as such are integral to the function of maps.</p>
<a id="Marketing" name="Marketing"></a><h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>As opposed to Industrial Design which focuses on the aesthetic qualities of consumer products (see below), the use of aesthetics in marketing concerns itself with the &#34;trade dress&#34; of a product, such as its branding, its commercial representation, or the reputation of its producer. Marketing professionals may tickle the consumer&#39;s aesthetic appreciation of sassyness, sophistication, color harmony, stylishness, catchy jingles, slogans, craftsmanship, soothingness, attentiveness, authenticity, or the related perceived experiences associated with product consumption.</p>
<p>Marketing compiles of intriguing the human mind to think in a direction where they would have not previously, or without outside input. Human curiosity, self gain or mental adjustment is what drives Marketing development itself.</p>

Whereas live stage performance is usually constrained by the physical reality at hand, film performance can further add the aesthetic elements of large-scale action, fantasy, and a complex interwoven musical <a href="/wiki/Film_score" id="w">score</a>. <a href="/wiki/Performance_art" id="w">Performance art</a> often consciously mixes the aesthetics of several forms. <a href="/wiki/Role-playing_games" id="w">Role-playing games</a> are sometimes seen as a performing art with an aesthetic structure of their own, called <a href="/wiki/Role-playing_game_theory" id="w">RPG theory</a>.</p>

In <a href="/wiki/Poetry" id="w">poetry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Short_story" id="w">short stories</a>, <a href="/wiki/Novel" id="w">novels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Non-fiction" id="w">non-fiction</a>, authors use a variety of techniques to appeal to our aesthetic values. Depending on the type of writing an author may employ rhythm, illustrations, structure, time shifting, juxtaposition, dualism, imagery, fantasy, suspense, analysis, humor/cynicism, and thinking aloud.</p>
<p>In literary aesthetics, the study of &#34;effect&#34; illuminates the deep structures of reading and receiving literary works. These effects may be broadly grouped by their modes of writing and the relationship that the reader assumes with time. <a href="/wiki/Catharsis" id="w">Catharsis</a> is the effect of dramatic completion of action in time. <a href="/wiki/Kairosis" id="w">Kairosis</a> is the effect of novels whose characters become integrated in time. <a href="/wiki/Kenosis" id="w">Kenosis</a> is the effect of lyric poetry which creates a sense of emptiness and timelessness.</p>

<div class="framecaption">A selection of desserts</div>
Although <a href="/wiki/Culinary" id="w">food</a> is a basic and frequently experienced commodity, careful attention to the aesthetic possibilities of foodstuffs can turn eating into <a href="/wiki/Gastronomy" id="w">gastronomy</a>. Chefs inspire our aesthetic enjoyment through the visual sense using colour and arrangement; they inspire our senses of taste and smell using <a href="/wiki/Spices" id="w">spices</a>, diversity/contrast, anticipation, seduction, and decoration/garnishes. In regard to <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" id="w">drinking water</a>, there are formal criteria for aesthetic value including <a href="/wiki/Odour" id="w">odour</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colour" id="w">colour</a>, <a href="/wiki/Total_dissolved_solids" id="w">total dissolved solids</a> and clarity. There are numerical standards in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">U.S.</a> for aesthetic acceptability of these parameters.</p>
<p>Note, however, a use of a word translated to &#34;culinary&#34; in Adorno&#39;s aesthetics. Adorno distinguishes between technically accurate and &#34;beautiful&#34; musical interpretation, and an interpretation higher which brings out the &#34;truth&#34; in the musical text: interpretations more rehearsed, with more time for rehearsal, but which might sound strange to audiences pandered-to by popular conductors (perhaps in the way Glenn Gould enstranges the music of Beethoven).</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the ordinary reader of Adorno, this isn&#39;t something technical such as &#34;original instruments&#34;. It is instead the work of art that doesn&#39;t pander to what the audience &#34;wants&#34;...its whims.</p>
<p>This is linked to a Marxist interpretation which instead of treating the audience as an all-powerful &#34;customer&#34; adopts a teacherly or even priestly stance &#34;above&#34; the mere audience, something only the most &#34;snobbish&#34; of French chefs would dare, proposing to teach it to like Higher Things.</p>
<p>There are rarefied forms of *haute* cuisine; but note that common sense usually has a horselaugh about precious Yuppies eating designer food which it withholds about concert-goers listening to Berg; your man in the street merely thinks the latter crowd to be odd jobs, and doesn&#39;t resent them, meaning that ethical judgements play a role in aesthetic judgements that specialists in ethics, and specialists in aesthetics, systematically disregard...but which artists such as Tolstoy regarded as central.</p>
<p>Based on Adorno&#39;s theory of the (merely) culinary as not being &#34;art&#34;, this would seem to mean that it&#39;s a joke, for an Adornoite (if such a person exists meaningfully), to treat cooking as an art form or eating as art appreciation. </p>
<p>Monty Python would often reverberate with this sort of arcana in a strange way: in the Mr. Creosote passage of The Meaning of Life, an enormously fat man is persuaded by the fawning waiter to have one more sweet whereupon Mr. Creosote throws up (in one of the most disgusting scenes ever filmed) all over the dining room. Note that the scene has more claims to be art, despite being nauseating, than designer food.</p>
<p>This MAY be an unconscious comment on any theory of art that blindly equates &#34;fine dining&#34; and a visit to the picture galleries, a sort of tourist equation in which picture galleries are overrun in fact by post-prandial Mr. Creosotes. Even the ordinary man in the street would say that the starving artist visiting the gallery has a &#34;better&#34; apprehension of the higher, more inner, more elusive aura of the art work than Mr. Creosote, which means that for some authors, including Adorno, there is a nexus between ethics (which nearly tracks aesthetics polyphonically, where we use &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; in ethics to characterise people and their deeds, and in aesthetics to judge what to buy).</p>
<p>The possibility of a rejection of the culinary in art starts with Kant&#39;s theory of the sublime but does not end there; post Holocaust (with its Nazis playing Bach: with Adorno&#39;s questions about poetry after Auschwitz) the culinary, and whether the German officer enjoying a &#34;fine&#34; meal has much of anything to do with art, become important aesthetic questions.</p>
<p>A Marxist theory of art would probably conclude that the chef cannot be an artist, lacking autonomy and beholden to the customer, Mr. Creosote, in all regards.</p>
<a id="Information_technology" name="Information_technology"></a><h2>Information technology</h2>

<p>Aesthetics in <a href="/wiki/Information_technology" id="w">information technology</a> has focused upon the study of <a href="/wiki/Human-computer_interaction" id="w">human-computer interaction</a> and creating <a href="/wiki/User-friendly" id="w">user-friendly</a> devices and <a href="/wiki/Software_applications" id="w">software applications</a>. <a href="/wiki/Software" id="w">Software</a> itself has aesthetic dimensions (&#34;<a href="/wiki/Software_aesthetics" id="w">software aesthetics</a>&#34;), as do information-technology-mediated processes and experiences such as computer <a href="/wiki/Video_games" id="w">video games</a> and <a href="/wiki/Virtual_reality" id="w">virtual reality</a> simulations. <a href="/wiki/Digital_culture" id="w">Digital culture</a> is a distinct aesthetic to judge the appeal of digital environments such as <a href="/wiki/Web_browser" id="w">Web browsers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Website" id="w">websites</a>, and icons, as well as visual and aural art produced exclusively with digital technologies. The notion of <a href="/wiki/Cyberspace" id="w">cyberspace</a> has sometimes been linked to the concept of the <a href="/wiki/Sublime_(philosophy)" id="w">sublime</a>.</p>
<p>Aesthetics in information technology do also apply to the act of designing <a href="/wiki/Software" id="w">software</a> itself. Numerous <a href="/wiki/Programmers" id="w">programmers</a> profess to experiencing a dimension of <a href="/wiki/Elegance" id="w">elegance</a> in the functionality and structuring of software at the <a href="/wiki/Source_code" id="w">source code</a> level.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> For example, a very short, powerful expression using all in-depth professional knowledge available to the programmer conveys a different sense of aesthetics and style than a functionally equivalent yet more simple expression. Such an expression might span more lines but is much more easy to understand and maintain. Aesthetics in programming also have a practical level: In general, elegant code runs faster, <a href="/wiki/Compiler" id="w">compiles</a> better, is more resource efficient and is less prone to <a href="/wiki/Software_bugs" id="w">software bugs</a>. Therefore, elegance in programming is often equivalent to good <a href="/wiki/Design" id="w">design</a>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critics of this would say that the need to justify &#34;good design&#34; by reference to &#34;cost savings&#34; mean that &#34;good design&#34; isn&#39;t &#34;art&#34; insofar as art is autonomous, and many aestheticians would have to say that art emerges in applications only in excess of cost savings. In information technology, theorists of &#34;user friendliness&#34; have to justify their &#34;user friendly&#34; applications and often disregard basic statistics when most users like a system, but a significant minority hate it.</p>
<p>That is, they may discard the standard deviation of their data in order to sell a good design for the best price, and this has nothing to do with art insofar as art is a useful signifier (if you cost-justify everything you are a businessman and not an artist).</p>
<p>A folk phenomenon among real programmers is in fact their frequent hatred of practice described in books as best practice and good design. A Marxist theory of industrial &#34;art&#34; would ascribe this to alienation, in which subaltern programmers never produce code they own in any meaningful sense, with the problem that the same sort of alienation, soldiering, and bloody-mindedness appeared, it seems, in Soviet computing shops.</p>
<p>The most sophisticated writings on the topic of aesthetics are to be found in the late Edsger Wybe Dijkstra&#39;s corpus of papers and notes on computing: in Dijsktra, the art is real, but Ying with respect to the Yang of applications; Dijkstra seemed to have refused any analysis of programming as other than applied mathematics and, strange to say, never pursued what Adorno (the midcentury theoretician of whom Dijkstra was apparently unaware) called a purely culinary elegance...despite the protests of others that his work was &#34;hard to digest&#34;, in Adorno&#39;s words not very culinary.</p>
<p>Dijkstra&#39;s beauty refused the notion of accessibility as do many &#34;artistic&#34; works ancient and modern: it was hard as is the Grosse Fuge, Beethoven&#39;s syncopated and neo-primitive late movement. In fact, no aesthetician makes &#34;user friendliness&#34; canonical and necessary in a work of art, strange to say in an era when supposedly the masses rule through the market; for most art theorists, it&#39;s nice if the canaille can enjoy some pretty rondo of Mozart and whistle it on the street, but would deny that this property must be shared by the Masonic prelude and fugue or the Requiem mass.</p>
<p>This makes strange any claim that a programmer making his work &#34;user friendly&#34; to all comers is some sort of artist by virtue of that. For Dijsktra, truth was primary, and beauty the automatic result.</p>
<a id="Mathematics" name="Mathematics"></a><h2>Mathematics</h2>
<p>{{main}}
The aesthetics of <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" id="w">mathematics</a> are often compared with music and poetry. Hungarian mathematician <a href="/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s" id="w">Paul Erdős</a> expressed his views on the indescribable beauty of mathematics when he said &#34;Why are numbers beautiful? It&#39;s like asking why is <a href="/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Beethoven)" id="w">Beethoven&#39;s Ninth Symphony</a> beautiful.&#34; Math appeals to the &#34;senses&#34; of logic, order, novelty, elegance, and discovery. Some concepts in math with specific aesthetic application include sacred ratios in <a href="/wiki/Geometry" id="w">geometry</a>, the intuitiveness of axioms, the complexity and intrigue of fractals, the solidness and regularity of <a href="/wiki/Polyhedra" id="w">polyhedra</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Serendipity" id="w">serendipity</a> of relating theorems across disciplines.</p>
<a id="Neuroesthetics" name="Neuroesthetics"></a><h2>Neuroesthetics</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cognitive_science" id="w">Cognitive science</a> has also considered aesthetics, with the advent of <a href="/wiki/Neuroesthetics" id="w">neuroesthetics</a>, pioneered by <a href="/wiki/Semir_Zeki" id="w">Semir Zeki</a>, which seeks to explain the prominence of great art as an embodiment of biological principles of the brain, namely that great works of art capture the essence of things just as vision and the brain capture the essentials of the world from the ever-changing stream of sensory input. <i>See also</i> <a href="/wiki/Vogelkop_Bowerbird" id="w">Vogelkop Bowerbird</a>.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Industrial_Design" id="w">Industrial Design</a>: Designers heed many aesthetic qualities to improve the marketability of manufactured products: smoothness, shininess/reflectivity, texture, pattern, curviness, color, simplicity, usability, velocity, symmetry, naturalness, and modernism.
The staff of the Design Aesthetics section focuses on design, appearance and the way people perceive products. Design aesthetics is interested in the appearance of products; the explanation and meaning of this appearance is studied mainly in terms of social and cultural factors. The distinctive focus of the section is research and education in the field of sensory modalities in relation to product design. These fields of attention generate design baggage that enables engineers to design products, systems, and services, and match them to the correct field of use.</p>
<a id="Architecture_and_interior_design" name="Architecture_and_interior_design"></a><h2>Architecture and interior design</h2>
<p>Although structural integrity, cost, the nature of building materials, and the functional utility of the building contribute heavily to the design process, architects can still apply aesthetic considerations to buildings and related <a href="/wiki/Architecture" id="w">architectural</a> structures. Common aesthetic design principles include ornamentation, edge delineation, texture, flow, solemnity, symmetry, color, granularity, the interaction of sunlight and shadows, transcendence, and harmony.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Interior_design" id="w">Interior designers</a>, being less constrained by structural concerns, have a wider variety of applications to appeal to aesthetics. They may employ color, color harmony, wallpaper, ornamentation, furnishings, fabrics, textures, lighting, various floor treatments, as well as adhere to aesthetic concepts such as <a href="/wiki/Feng_shui" id="w">feng shui</a>.</p>

Nearly half of mankind lives in cities; although it represents a lofty goal, <a href="/wiki/Urban_planning" id="w">planning</a> and achieving urban aesthetics (<a href="/wiki/Beautification" id="w">beautification</a>) involves a good deal of historical luck, happenstance, and indirect gestalt. Nevertheless, aesthetically pleasing cities share certain traits: ethnic and cultural variety, numerous microclimates that promote a diversity of vegetation, sufficient public transportation, Public art and freedom of expression in the community in the forms of sculpture, <a href="/wiki/Graffiti" id="w">graffiti</a> and <a href="/wiki/Street_art" id="w">street art</a>, a range of build-out (or zoning) that creates both densely and sparsely populated areas, scenic neighboring geography (oceans or mountains), public spaces and events such as <a href="/wiki/Park" id="w">parks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Parade" id="w">parades</a>, musical variety through local radio or street musicians, and enforcement of laws that abate noise, crime, and pollution.</p>
<a id="Landscape_design" name="Landscape_design"></a><h2>Landscape design</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Landscape_architecture" id="w">Landscape designers</a> draw upon design elements such as axis, line, landform, horizontal and vertical planes, texture, and scale to create aesthetic variation within the landscape. They may additionally make use of aesthetic elements such as pools or fountains of water, plants, seasonal variance, stonework, fragrance, exterior lighting, statues, and lawns.</p>
<a id="Fashion_Design" name="Fashion_Design"></a><h2>Fashion Design</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Fashion_design" id="w">Fashion designers</a> use a variety of techniques to allow people to express the truth about their unconscious minds by way of their clothing. To create wearable personality designers use fabric, cut, colour, scale, references to the past, texture, color harmony, distressing, transparency, insignia, accessories, beading and embroidery.
It is also used to find the average size of things, to make a product suitable for a high number of customers.</p>
