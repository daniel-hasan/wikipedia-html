<b>Typhoon Paka</b> (international designation: <i>9728</i>, JTWC designation: <i>05C</i>, <a href="/wiki/PAGASA" id="w">PAGASA</a> designation: <b>Rubing</b>, also known as <i>Super Typhoon Paka</i>) was the last <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical cyclone</a> in the <a href="/wiki/1997_Pacific_hurricane_season" id="w">1997 Pacific hurricane</a> and <a href="/wiki/1997_Pacific_typhoon_season" id="w">typhoon</a> season, and was among the strongest Pacific typhoons in the month of December.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Paka, which is the <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_language" id="w">Hawaiian</a> name for Pat,<sup id="_ref-cphc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cphc" title="">[2]</a></sup> developed on <a href="/wiki/November_28" id="w">November 28</a> in the central Pacific Ocean from a <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a> near the <a href="/wiki/Equator" id="w">equator</a> well to the southwest of <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaii</a>. After initially tracking northward, the storm turned to the west due to a strong <a href="/wiki/Ridge_(meteorology)" id="w">high pressure area</a> to its north, and on <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a> it crossed into the western Pacific Ocean. The cyclone intensified into a typhoon as it crossed the <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Islands" id="w">Marshall Islands</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_10" id="w">December 10</a>, and continuing to intensify Paka struck <a href="/wiki/Guam" id="w">Guam</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rota_(island)" id="w">Rota</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_16" id="w">December 16</a> with winds of 230&#160;km/h (145&#160;mph). The typhoon strengthened further and reached its peak intensity by <a href="/wiki/December_18" id="w">December 18</a> over open waters. Subsequently it underwent a steady weakening trend, and on <a href="/wiki/December_23" id="w">December 23</a> Paka dissipated.</p>
<p>Typhoon Paka first impacted the <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Islands" id="w">Marshall Islands</a>, where it dropped heavy rainfall and resulted in $80&#160;million in damage (1997&#160;USD, $100&#160;million 2007&#160;USD). Later, it passed just north of Guam, where strong winds destroyed about 1,500&#160;buildings and damaged 10,000&#160;more; 5,000&#160;people were left homeless, and the island experienced a complete power outage following the typhoon. Damage on the island totaled $500&#160;million (1997&#160;USD, $645&#160;million 2007&#160;USD), which warranted the <a href="/wiki/List_of_retired_Pacific_hurricane_names" id="w">retirement of its name</a>. Paka also caused light damage in the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Marianas_Islands" id="w">Northern Marianas Islands</a>. The typhoon resulted in no fatalities.</p>

As the weather synoptics of the northern <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a> transitioned into a late-fall to early winter-type pattern, <a href="/wiki/Convection" id="w">convection</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Monsoon_trough" id="w">monsoon trough</a> extended to the east of the <a href="/wiki/International_Date_Line" id="w">International Date Line</a>. During late November, an equatorial westerly wind system developed into twin <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">troughs</a> on opposite sides of the <a href="/wiki/Equator" id="w">equator</a>; the one in the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" id="w">Southern Hemisphere</a> ultimately developed into <a href="/wiki/1997-98_South_Pacific_cyclone_season#Tropical Storm Pam" id="w">Tropical Storm Pam</a>, while the one in the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" id="w">Northern Hemisphere</a> formed into an area of convection about 2000&#160;km (1240&#160;mi) southwest of <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaii</a>. The disturbance gradually organized as it drifted north-northeastward, and on <a href="/wiki/November_28" id="w">November 28</a> it developed into Tropical Depression Five-C about 465&#160;km (290&#160;mi) west-northwest of <a href="/wiki/Palmyra_Atoll" id="w">Palmyra Atoll</a>. Operationally, the <a href="/wiki/Central_Pacific_Hurricane_Center" id="w">Central Pacific Hurricane Center</a> (CPHC) did not begin issuing warnings on the system until <a href="/wiki/December_2" id="w">December 2</a>.<sup id="_ref-summary_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-summary" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-pakatcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pakatcr" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-epachurdat_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-epachurdat" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-cphc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cphc" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The tropical depression continued drifting north-northeastward, and initially failed to strengthen significantly. It turned to the west on <a href="/wiki/December_1" id="w">December 1</a>, due to the presence of a strong <a href="/wiki/Anticyclone" id="w">anticyclone</a> to its north with a <a href="/wiki/Ridge_(meteorology)" id="w">ridge</a> extending westward past the <a href="/wiki/International_Date_Line" id="w">International Date Line</a>. On <a href="/wiki/December_2" id="w">December 2</a>, based on satellite estimates, the CPHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Paka while located about 1000&#160;km (625&#160;mi) south-southeast of <a href="/wiki/Johnston_Atoll" id="w">Johnston Atoll</a>. Due to the presence of high <a href="/wiki/Cloud" id="w">clouds</a> across the area, forecasters had difficulty at times in locating the low-level circulation. After becoming a tropical storm, Paka remained nearly stationary for about 2 days before resuming a slow motion to the west-southwest. It steadily intensified due to warm water temperatures, and from <a href="/wiki/December_3" id="w">December 3</a> through the following day, the storm attained winds of 105&#160;km/h (65&#160;mph) before encountering dry air and weakening. By <a href="/wiki/December_6" id="w">December 6</a>, the winds had decreased to minimal tropical storm status for about 12 hours. Subsequently, Paka began to re-intensity, and on <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a> the storm crossed the <a href="/wiki/International_Date_Line" id="w">International Date Line</a> into the western North Pacific Ocean with winds of 80&#160;km/h (50&#160;mph).<sup id="_ref-epachurdat_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-epachurdat" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-cphc_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cphc" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Upon entering the western North Pacific Ocean, tropical cyclone warning duties transferred from the CPHC to the <a href="/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency" id="w">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA), and the JMA first assessed Paka as a 65&#160;km (40&#160;mph <small>10-min sustained</small>) storm.<sup id="_ref-jma_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jma" title="">[6]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Joint_Typhoon_Warning_Center" id="w">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) unofficially assumed warning duties for interests in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" id="w">United States Department of Defense</a>, as well. Paka continued to intensify after crossing the date line, and from late on <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a> through early the following day the storm maintained winds of 115&#160;km/h (70&#160;mph <small>1-min sustained</small>), according to analysis by JTWC. However, upper-level <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a> increased shortly thereafter, and it again weakened. At 1200&#160;UTC on <a href="/wiki/December_9" id="w">December 9</a>, the JTWC assessed Paka as an 85&#160;km/h (50&#160;mph) tropical storm, and forecasted it to continue weakening due to strong wind shear would remain. By <a href="/wiki/December_10" id="w">December 10</a>, the shear had begun to decrease as the storm moved through the <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Islands" id="w">Marshall Islands</a>, and that night the JTWC upgraded Paka to typhoon status.<sup id="_ref-pakatcr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pakatcr" title="">[4]</a></sup> Paka was officially upgraded to typhoon status when JMA classified it with winds of 120&#160;km/h (75&#160;mph <small>10-min sustained</small>) at 0000&#160;UTC on <a href="/wiki/December_11" id="w">December 11</a>.<sup id="_ref-jma_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jma" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Following the passage of the typhoon in the <a href="/wiki/Ailinglaplap_Atoll" id="w">Ailinglaplap Atoll</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Islands" id="w">Marshall Islands</a>, which was most damaged by Paka, residents experienced severe food shortages due to damaged crops and little rainfall. Experts estimated the entire redevelopment of its fauna would require more than a decade. As a result of the crop shortage, large-scale evacuations of the islands&#39; residents were considered. Officials in the nation requested assistance from the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency" id="w">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>,<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> and on <a href="/wiki/March_20" id="w">March 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a>, the area was declared a disaster area; the declaration allowed for the usage of emergency funds.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/December_17" id="w">December 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>, <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" id="w">Bill Clinton</a> declared <a href="/wiki/Guam" id="w">Guam</a> a federal disaster area, making it eligible for federal assistance.<sup id="_ref-1217fem_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1217fem" title="">[20]</a></sup> One week later, a disaster declaration was ordered for the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Mariana_Islands" id="w">Northern Mariana Islands</a>.<sup id="_ref-1224fem_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1224fem" title="">[21]</a></sup> Ultimately, <a href="/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency" id="w">FEMA</a> received 14,770&#160;Individual Assistance Applications from residents on Guam. In turn, FEMA provided the residents with over $27&#160;million in assistance (1997&#160;USD, $35&#160;million 2007&#160;USD).<sup id="_ref-fempongsona_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fempongsona" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>The entire island of Guam was left without power after Paka. Water and sewage systems on Guam were directly affected minimally by the typhoon. With the usage of power generators, most areas of the island had <a href="/wiki/Water_pumping" id="w">water pumping</a> capabilities within a few days after the typhoon. The <a href="/wiki/Antonio_B._Won_Pat_International_Airport" id="w">Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport</a> was partially reopened to daytime flights a day after the typhoon, and by a week after the passage of Paka the airport was fully re-opened.<sup id="_ref-eqe_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eqe" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Due to the heavy damage from the typhoon, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center requested the retirement of the name in April 2006; the name <b>Paka</b> was replaced with <b>Pama</b>.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
