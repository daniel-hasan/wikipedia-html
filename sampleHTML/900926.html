<p><b>Mona &#34;Mo&#34; Best</b>, (<a href="/wiki/3_January" id="w">3 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1924" id="w">1924</a>-<a href="/wiki/9_September" id="w">9 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1988" id="w">1988</a>) was born in <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>, and is best known as the mother of <a href="/wiki/Pete_Best" id="w">Pete Best</a> (b.1941) who was an early member of <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" id="w">The Beatles</a>. Mona also had two other sons, Rory (b.1944) and Roag Best (b.1962). It was later confirmed that Roag&#39;s father is The Beatles&#39; associate <a href="/wiki/Neil_Aspinall" id="w">Neil Aspinall</a>, although he was not registered as the father on Roag&#39;s birth certificate. </p>
<p>After moving to <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" id="w">Liverpool</a> from India, the Best family claim that Mona pawned all of her jewellery in 1954, and used the money to place a 33-1 <a href="/wiki/Gambling" id="w">bet</a> on a horse named &#34;Never Say Die&#34;, and used her winnings to buy a house in 1957. Mona later opened <a href="/wiki/The_Casbah_Coffee_Club" id="w">The Casbah Coffee Club</a> in the cellar of the house as a venue for <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" id="w">Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll</a> music. It was planned as a members-only club for her sons and their friends. The club was often referred to as The Casbah Club, or The Casbah.</p>

The Casbah Club cellar—with its original decoration—still exists. In 2006, the property was accorded a <a href="/wiki/Grade_II" id="w">Grade II</a> Heritage listing.

<p>Being a part of Best&#39;s family meant Mona was accorded respect on Merseyside, which included meeting well-known sports personalities of the time and receiving preferential treatment when booking a table in a restaurant, or a seat in the theatre.<sup id="_ref-BestRoagPetep18_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BestRoagPetep18" title="">[9]</a></sup> The Bests lived for a short time at the Best family&#39;s large home in <a href="/wiki/West_Derby" id="w">West Derby</a>, which was called &#34;Ellerslie Manor&#34;, but Mona fell out with John Best&#39;s sister, Edna, who resented her brother&#39;s choice of wife.<sup id="_ref-BestRoagPetep21_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BestRoagPetep21" title="">[10]</a></sup> The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool (above Ma Edgerton&#39;s public house) but Mona was always looking for a large house—as she had been used to in India—instead of a smaller <a href="/wiki/Semi-detached" id="w">semi-detached</a> house, which were prevalent in the area. After moving to a three-bedroomed house in Princess Drive, Mona persuaded her parents, Thomas and Mary Shaw, to leave India and live with them in Liverpool.<sup id="_ref-BestRoagPetep22_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BestRoagPetep22" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>After moving to 17 Queenscourt Road in 1948—where the Bests lived for nine years—Rory saw a large Victorian house for sale at 8 Hayman&#39;s Green, in 1957, and told Mona about it.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The Best family claim that Mona then pawned all her jewellery and placed a bet on a horse that was ridden by <a href="/wiki/Lester_Piggott" id="w">Lester Piggott</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Epsom_Derby" id="w">Epsom Derby</a> called, &#34;Never Say Die&#34;, which won at 33-1, and used her winnings to buy a house in 1957.<sup id="_ref-BestHappyMan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BestHappyMan" title="">[14]</a></sup> 8 Hayman&#39;s Green had previously been owned by the West Derby <a href="/wiki/Association_of_Conservative_Clubs" id="w">Conservative Club</a>, and was unlike many other family houses in Liverpool, as the house (built around 1860) was set back from the road, had 15 bedrooms and an <a href="/wiki/Acre" id="w">acre</a> of land.<sup id="_ref-BestRoagPetep16_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BestRoagPetep16" title="">[15]</a></sup> All the rooms were painted dark green or brown, and the garden was totally overgrown.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp161_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp161" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-MilesPage57_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MilesPage57" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-TheCasbahClub_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TheCasbahClub" title="">[18]</a></sup> Mona decorated the living room in an <a href="/wiki/Oriental" id="w">Oriental</a> style, which reflected her own upbringing in India.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp326_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp326" title="">[19]</a></sup> She had previously tried to interest her husband in other houses, including a <a href="/wiki/Formby" id="w">Formby</a> lighthouse, a windmill in <a href="/wiki/St._Helens" id="w">St. Helens</a> and a circular house in <a href="/wiki/Southport" id="w">Southport</a>, which were all rejected by Best as not being to his liking.<sup id="_ref-BestRoagPetep16_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BestRoagPetep16" title="">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>During 1961-1962, Aspinall became good friends with Pete and subsequently rented a room in the Best&#39;s house. During one of the extended business trips of Pete&#39;s father, Aspinall became romantically involved with Mona, who was 20 years his senior. During this period, Aspinall fathered a child by Mona: Vincent &#34;Roag&#34; Best.<sup id="_ref- CynthiaJohnp44_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- CynthiaJohnp44" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Roag was born in late July 1962, and just three weeks later, on August 16, 1962, Pete was dismissed from The Beatles.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp331_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp331" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-MerseyBeatNeilAspinall_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MerseyBeatNeilAspinall" title="">[23]</a></sup> Roag&#39;s birth certificate was registered on <a href="/wiki/31_August" id="w">31 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a>, stating his name to be Vincent Rogue [sic] Best, and his father as being John Best.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp331_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp331" title="">[22]</a></sup> Mona and Best separated in the early 1960s.<sup id="_ref-Liverpoolcradle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Liverpoolcradle" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

Mona came up with the idea of the club after watching a TV report about <a href="/wiki/The_2i%26%2339%3Bs_Coffee_Bar" id="w">The 2i&#39;s Coffee Bar</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Soho" id="w">Soho</a> where several singers had been discovered.

<p>Mona had booked the <a href="/wiki/The_Quarrymen" id="w">Les Stewart Quartet</a> to play the opening night with Harrison on guitar, but they cancelled the booking after Stewart and Brown had a quarrel. Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal, because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp161_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp161" title="">[16]</a></sup> As 300 membership cards had already been sold, Harrison said that he had two friends in a band called The Quarrymen who would play instead.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp161_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp161" title="">[16]</a></sup> Lennon, McCartney, <a href="/wiki/Stuart_Sutcliffe" id="w">Stuart Sutcliffe</a> and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish painting the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows and stars, but as Lennon was <a href="/wiki/Short-sighted" id="w">short-sighted</a>, he mistook <a href="/wiki/Gloss_(paint)" id="w">gloss</a> for <a href="/wiki/Paint" id="w">emulsion</a> paint, which took a long time to dry in the dark, damp cellar. <a href="/wiki/Cynthia_Lennon" id="w">Cynthia Powell</a>, later the wife of Lennon, painted a silhouette of him on the wall, which is also still there.<sup id="_ref-CynthiaJohnp43-44_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CynthiaJohnp43-44" title="">[30]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CasbahListedStatus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CasbahListedStatus" title="">[31]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The Quarrymen played a series of seven Saturday night concerts in The Casbah for 15 <a href="/wiki/Shillings" id="w">shillings</a> each, starting on <a href="/wiki/29_August" id="w">29 August</a> to October 1959, featuring Brown, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, but without a drummer, or a <a href="/wiki/Public_address" id="w">PA</a> system.<sup id="_ref-Milesp51_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp51" title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CasbahPhotos_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CasbahPhotos" title="">[33]</a></sup> The opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air-conditioning, and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe.<sup id="_ref-CynthiaJohnp44_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CynthiaJohnp44" title="">[34]</a></sup> As there was no amplification, Lennon later persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short set before The Quarrymen, but this was only so they could use his <a href="/wiki/Amplifier" id="w">40-Watt amplifier</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp163_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp163" title="">[35]</a></sup> After the success of the first night, Mona gave The Quarrymen a residency, and paid the whole group <a href="/wiki/£" id="w">£3</a> a night.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp162_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp162" title="">[36]</a></sup> Every Saturday thereafter, queues lengthened onto the street, which was financially good for Mona, as she charged one shilling admission on top of the annual membership fee.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp164_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp164" title="">[37]</a></sup>   </p>
<p>Pete was studying at the Collegiate Grammar School when he decided he wanted to be in a music group, so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler&#39;s music store and Best formed his own band; The Black Jacks.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp161_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp161" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left The Quarrymen.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp4-5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp4-5" title="">[40]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CasbahPhotos_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CasbahPhotos" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> The reason for Brown&#39;s exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the <a href="/wiki/Influenza" id="w">flu</a>, so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best&#39;s living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel with the rest of the group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown&#39;s money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp164-165_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp164-165" title="">[42]</a></sup> Colin Manley from The Remo Four was also given a booking to play in the club, which was the only venue that young amateur bands could play at the time.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp162_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp162" title="">[36]</a></sup> Other groups like <a href="/wiki/The_Searchers_(band)" id="w">The Searchers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gerry_%26amp%3B_The_Pacemakers" id="w">Gerry &#38; The Pacemakers</a> later played in the club.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> The Black Jacks became the resident group at The Casbah, although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited.<sup id="_ref-CynthiaJohnp44_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CynthiaJohnp44" title="">[34]</a></sup> It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney convinced Sutcliffe to use the prize money he had been given after winning an art competition to buy a <a href="/wiki/Hofner" id="w">Hofner</a> President bass guitar and join The Quarrymen.<sup id="_ref-Torontosun_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Torontosun" title="">[44]</a></sup>  </p>

When Pete became a member of The Beatles, Mona repeatedly tried to get the group a lunchtime residency in The Cavern Club by talking to the owner, Ray McFall, but was turned down, as The Cavern had a jazz-only policy at the time.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp238_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp238" title="">[47]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Brian_Epstein" id="w">Brian Epstein</a> later wanted to manage the group, and Mona was asked for her advice, and although she had her own plans for the group, she concluded that Epstein would be good for them over time.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp274_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp274" title="">[48]</a></sup> After The Beatles signed a management contract with Epstein, Mona did not relinquish her control over them, as they had been using her telephone to call agents, and frequently slept over in her living room between concerts.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp326_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp326" title="">[19]</a></sup> She constantly harassed Epstein about the quality of their bookings, and his management of them, which led to Epstein never referring to her by name, but always calling her &#34;<i>that woman</i>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp231_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp231" title="">[49]</a></sup> One musician commented that if Mona said it was a Sunday when it was Tuesday, one would be forced to agree with her.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp326_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp326" title="">[19]</a></sup> </p>
<p>After Best, McCartney and Harrison were <a href="/wiki/Deportation" id="w">deported</a> from Hamburg in November 1960, Mona made numerous phone calls to Hamburg to recover the group&#39;s equipment, which she eventually managed to do.<sup id="_ref-MilesPage72-73_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MilesPage72-73" title="">[50]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-”TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD”_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-”TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD”" title="">[52]</a></sup> Mona wrote to <a href="/wiki/Granada_Television" id="w">Granada Television</a> in 1961, in an attempt to get the group a television appearance on the programme called &#34;People And Places&#34;, but was sent a letter telling her that they would contact her in the future.<sup id="_ref-HarryBeatlesEncyclopedia_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HarryBeatlesEncyclopedia" title="">[53]</a></sup> After her son had been dismissed from The Beatles on <a href="/wiki/16_August" id="w">16 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a>, Mona was later quoted by biographer <a href="/wiki/Hunter_Davies" id="w">Hunter Davies</a> as saying: {{cquote}}</p>
