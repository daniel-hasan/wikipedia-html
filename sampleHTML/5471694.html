<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Carlo  di Rudio was born in <a href="/wiki/Belluno" id="w">Belluno</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>.  He was the son of Count and Countess Aquila di Rudio. (Shortly before his death, he was interviewed by <a href="/wiki/Walter_Mason_Camp" id="w">Walter Mason Camp</a>, and showed him family records going back to 1680.) As a teenager, he attended an Austrian military academy in <a href="/wiki/Milan" id="w">Milan</a>. At the age of 15, di Rudio left to join the Italian patriots during the uprising in 1848, and participated in the defense of <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Rome</a> and, later, of <a href="/wiki/Venice" id="w">Venice</a> against the Austrians. He was shipwrecked off <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a> in an aborted attempt to sail to America. By 1855, he was living in <a href="/wiki/East_London%2C_England" id="w">East London</a> (England) and had married Eliza, the 15-year-old daughter of a <a href="/wiki/Confection" id="w">confectionist</a>. They eventually had three daughters and one son.</p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/January_14" id="w">January 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1858" id="w">1858</a>, during a visit to the <a href="/wiki/Paris_Opera" id="w">Paris Opera</a>, three bombs were thrown at the royal precession of Emperor <a href="/wiki/Louis_Napoleon" id="w">Louis Napoleon</a> (Napoleon III). Three or four people and a horse were killed and many injured. Four men were arrested: <a href="/wiki/Felice_Orsini" id="w">Felice Orsini</a>, the leader of the plot, Giuseppi Pieri, Antonio Gomez, and a Portuguese beer salesman named &#34;Da Selva,&#34; which turned out to be di Rudio. (See <a href="/wiki/Felice_Orsini" id="w">Felice Orsini</a> for details). Orsini and Pieri were <a href="/wiki/Guillotine" id="w">guillotined</a> on <a href="/wiki/March_14" id="w">March 14</a> and Gomez was acquitted.  di Rudio was sentenced for execution with Orsini and Pieri, but someone pled <a href="/wiki/Clemency" id="w">clemency</a> for him and the sentence was commuted to <a href="/wiki/Life_imprisonment" id="w">life imprisonment</a> on <a href="/wiki/Devil%26%2339%3Bs_Island" id="w">Devil&#39;s Island</a>. Several months later, he was with twelve others who escaped from the prison and made their way to <a href="/wiki/British_Guiana" id="w">British Guiana</a>. From there, di Rudio made his way back to London and his wife and went on the lecture circuit. His name was <a href="/wiki/Anglicized" id="w">anglicized</a> as &#39;Charles DeRudio&#39;.</p>
<a id="American_Civil_War" name="American_Civil_War"></a><h2>American Civil War</h2>
<p>DeRudio immigrated to <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> in 1864. He became a private in the <a href="/wiki/79th_New_York_Volunteer_Infantry" id="w">79th &#34;Highlanders,&#34; New York Volunteers</a>, serving about two months with them. In October 1864, he was commissioned <a href="/wiki/Second_lieutenant" id="w">second lieutenant</a>, <a href="/wiki/U.S._Colored_Troops" id="w">2nd U. S. Colored Infantry</a>. DeRudio was honorably mustered out of service in January 1866.</p>
<a id="Seventh_Cavalry" name="Seventh_Cavalry"></a><h2>Seventh Cavalry</h2>
<p>After his Civil War service, DeRudio joined the <a href="/wiki/Regular_Army" id="w">Regular Army</a> and was appointed <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant" id="w">lieutenant</a> by August 1867. Three weeks later, he failed a physical and his appointment was canceled. (Also, the <a href="/wiki/U.S._War_Department" id="w">U.S. War Department</a> discovered his previous &#39;political activity&#39;.) But about a month later, he was back in uniform.</p>
<p>DeRudio was assigned to the Seventh Cavalry in July 1869. Initially, he was in Company H, commanded by Captain <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Benteen" id="w">Frederick Benteen</a>. DeRudio was promoted to <a href="/wiki/First_lieutenant" id="w">first lieutenant</a> early in 1876 as part of the reorganization of the Seventh Cavalry. As he was in Company E, he should have received command of it when promoted. However, E Company was one of Custer&#39;s, and Custer had DeRudio trade places with a favorite of his, <a href="/wiki/Algernon_Smith" id="w">Algernon Smith</a> of Company A. DeRudio and Captain <a href="/wiki/Myles_Moylan" id="w">Myles Moylan</a> of Company A, apparently did not get along and DeRudio became Benteen&#39;s Adjutant. The transfer was to doom Smith to an early death and spare DeRudio&#39;s life.</p>
<p>Benteen nicknamed DeRudio &#34;Count No Account&#34; because of his boastful story-telling and haughty manner. Few respected his military abilities as an Indian fighter.</p>

<p>Years later, in an interview with <a href="/wiki/Walter_Mason_Camp" id="w">Walter Mason Camp</a>, DeRudio claimed that he had had the only <a href="/wiki/Saber" id="w">saber</a> at the Little Bighorn. (Perhaps unknown to him, Lt. <a href="/wiki/Edward_Mathey" id="w">Edward Mathey</a> with the pack train had kept his also, using it to kill snakes. And at least two Indians had sabers, having obtained them at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Rosebud" id="w">Battle of the Rosebud</a>.) He showed Camp a golden saber that had been a gift given to him by Company G in 1870. He had been scolded by Custer for accepting the present, and, perhaps as a matter of spite, had not surrendered his issued saber when the others had been packed up at the <a href="/wiki/Powder_River" id="w">Powder River</a> Depot. </p>
<p>In the fall of 1876, a rather damaging story attributed to DeRudio appeared in the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Herald" id="w">New York Herald</a>. DeRudio later claimed he had not written the story, but had given information to Major <a href="/wiki/James_Brisbin" id="w">James (&#39;Grasshopper Jim&#39;) Brisbin</a>, who had elaborated his story and published it without his (DeRudio&#39;s) consent. </p>
<p>In 1879, he testified at the <a href="/wiki/Reno_Court_of_Inquiry" id="w">Reno Court of Inquiry</a>.</p>

<p>DeRudio was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Captain" id="w">captain</a> in December, 1882. He retired on <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1896" id="w">1896</a>, to <a href="/wiki/San_Diego%2C_California" id="w">San Diego, California</a>. </p>
<p>Charles DeRudio died in 1910 in <a href="/wiki/Pasadena%2C_California" id="w">Pasadena, California</a>.</p>
