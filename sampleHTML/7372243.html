<b>Hurricane Paul</b> was a hurricane that ultimately struck <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a> as a tropical depression in October of 2006. It developed from an area of disturbed weather on <a href="/wiki/October_21" id="w">October 21</a>, and slowly intensified as it moved into an area of warm waters and progressively decreasing wind shear. Paul attained hurricane status on <a href="/wiki/October_23" id="w">October 23</a>, and later that day it reached its peak intensity of {{convert}}, a strong <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 2</a> hurricane. A strong trough turned the hurricane to the north and northeast into an area of strong vertical shear, and Paul weakened to a tropical storm on <a href="/wiki/October_24" id="w">October 24</a>. It accelerated northeastward, and after passing a short distance south of <a href="/wiki/Baja_California_Sur" id="w">Baja California Sur</a> the low level circulation became decoupled from the rest of the convection. Paul weakened to a tropical depression on <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a> a short distance off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>, and after briefly turning away from the coast it made landfall on northwestern <a href="/wiki/Sinaloa" id="w">Sinaloa</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_26" id="w">October 26</a>.</p>
<p>Paul was the third hurricane to threaten western Mexico in the season, the others being <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_John_(2006)" id="w">Hurricanes John</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Lane_(2006)" id="w">Lane</a>. Rough surf killed two people along <a href="/wiki/Baja_California_Sur" id="w">Baja California Sur</a>, while flooding was reported in <a href="/wiki/Sinaloa" id="w">Sinaloa</a>.</p>

A <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> moved off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_4" id="w">October 4</a>. It moved westward across the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> without development, and entered the eastern <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_18" id="w">October 18</a>. The next day, it combined with a previously existing area of disturbed weather, resulting in a large area of convection extending northward into southern <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The broad and disorganized system moved westward at 10 to 15 mph (16 to 24 km/h).<sup id="_ref-stds_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stds" title="">[2]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/October_20" id="w">October 20</a>, the system developed an <a href="/wiki/Low_pressure_area" id="w">area of low pressure</a>, and began to show signs of organization.<sup id="_ref-oct20two_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oct20two" title="">[3]</a></sup> It continued to organize, and developed into Tropical Depression Seventeen-E on <a href="/wiki/October_21" id="w">October 21</a> while located about 265 miles (425 km) south-southwest of <a href="/wiki/Manzanillo%2C_Colima" id="w">Manzanillo</a>. Upon forming, the depression possessed a small, tight low-level circulation beneath a well-defined mid-level circulation. Easterly <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a> initially restricted upper-level outflow as the cyclone moved to the west, a motion due to a <a href="/wiki/Subtropical_ridge" id="w">subtropical ridge</a> to its north.<sup id="_ref-td17disc1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-td17disc1" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The cloud pattern of the depression quickly became better organized as a curved band developed around intensifying deep convection, and it is estimated the system intensified into Tropical Storm Paul just six hours after forming. Easterly <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a> exposed the low level circulation to the east of the area of deep convection, though Paul continued to intensify as it moved through an area of warm waters and progressively weakening wind shear.<sup id="_ref-pauldisc2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pauldisc2" title="">[5]</a></sup> The low level circulation gradually became more embedded within the convection as the cloud pattern improved. Computer models had troubles in forecasting the future of the storm early in its life; the <a href="/wiki/Geophysical_Fluid_Dynamics_Laboratory" id="w">GFDL model</a> forecasted Paul to reach winds of 119 mph (191 km/h), while <a href="/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction#Global models" id="w">global models</a> expected the system to dissipate in 48 to 72 hours.<sup id="_ref-paul3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul3" title="">[6]</a></sup> Early on <a href="/wiki/October_22" id="w">October 22</a>, wind shear began to decrease, which coincided with an increase of outflow on its eastern side.<sup id="_ref-paul4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul4" title="">[7]</a></sup> The storm temporarily degraded in appearance<sup id="_ref-paul5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul5" title="">[8]</a></sup> as it turned to the northwest.<sup id="_ref-paul6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul6" title="">[9]</a></sup> However, shear sharply abated over Paul late on October 22, resulting in the storm quickly gaining organization and intensifying. An <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)" id="w">eye</a> began to develop within the convection,<sup id="_ref-paul7_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul7" title="">[10]</a></sup> and Paul intensified into a hurricane early on <a href="/wiki/October_23" id="w">October 23</a>.<sup id="_ref-paul8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul8" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>Located in an area of warm <a href="/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature" id="w">water temperatures</a> and light wind shear, Hurricane Paul continued to intensify and organize;<sup id="_ref-paul8_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul8" title="">[11]</a></sup> its well-defined eye was surrounded by a ring of deep convection while outflow remained strong to the north and south.<sup id="_ref-paul9_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul9" title="">[12]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/October_23" id="w">October 23</a>, while located 465 miles (750 km) south-southwest of <a href="/wiki/Cabo_San_Lucas" id="w">Cabo San Lucas</a>, Paul reached its peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h), a Category 2 hurricane on the <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Saffir-Simpson Scale</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> A large <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a> located off the west coast of <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a> turned the hurricane to the north-northwest,<sup id="_ref-paul10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul10" title="">[13]</a></sup> and later to the north. The combination of increasing shear and dry air quickly weakened Paul<sup id="_ref-paul11_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul11" title="">[14]</a></sup> to a tropical storm on <a href="/wiki/October_24" id="w">October 24</a> as its low-level circulation became detached from the diminishing convection.<sup id="_ref-paul14_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul14" title="">[15]</a></sup> The storm then turned to the northeast after passing near <a href="/wiki/Socorro_Island" id="w">Socorro Island</a>.<sup id="_ref-paul15_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul15" title="">[16]</a></sup> Despite increasing wind shear of over 50 mph (80 km/h), Paul remained a tropical storm while its circulation remained on the southwest side of its developing deep convection. Early on <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, the storm passed about 100 miles (160 km) south of the southern tip of <a href="/wiki/Baja_California_Sur" id="w">Baja California</a>.<sup id="_ref-paul17_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The circulation briefly became involved with the deep convection as it accelerated northeastward, though as it approached the coast of <a href="/wiki/Sinaloa" id="w">Sinaloa</a>, the center again decoupled from the upper level circulation.<sup id="_ref-paul19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul19" title="">[18]</a></sup> Later that day, Paul weakened to a tropical depression a short distance off the coast of Mexico, and turned to the north.<sup id="_ref-disco20_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disco20" title="">[19]</a></sup> Early the next day, the depression, devoid of any deep convection, made landfall near <a href="/wiki/Isla_Altamura" id="w">Isla Altamura</a> in northwestern <a href="/wiki/Sinaloa" id="w">Sinaloa</a>. Hours later, the National Hurricane Center issued the last advisory on the dissipating tropical depression.<sup id="_ref-paul22_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paul22" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-tcr_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Preparations" name="Preparations"></a><h2>Preparations</h2>
<p>As Paul became a hurricane, the government of <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a> issued a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">hurricane watch</a> for <a href="/wiki/Baja_California_Sur" id="w">Baja California Sur</a> from <a href="/wiki/Agua_Blanca%2C_Baja_California_Sur" id="w">Agua Blanca</a> on the west coast to <a href="/wiki/La_Paz%2C_Baja_California_Sur" id="w">La Paz</a> on the east coast.<sup id="_ref-avila8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-avila8" title="">[21]</a></sup> When a weakening trend was evident as the storm turned to the northeast, the hurricane watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning.<sup id="_ref-avila13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-avila13" title="">[22]</a></sup> 
45 hours before the storm struck land, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from <a href="/wiki/Mazatl%C3%A1n" id="w">Mazatlán</a> to <a href="/wiki/San_Evaristo" id="w">San Evaristo</a> along the coast of <a href="/wiki/Sinaloa" id="w">Sinaloa</a>.<sup id="_ref-avila13_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-avila13" title="">[22]</a></sup> When Paul was expected to weaken to a tropical depression before landfall, the tropical storm watch for mainland Mexico was discontinued.<sup id="_ref-bevenlandsea16_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bevenlandsea16" title="">[23]</a></sup> When Paul retained tropical storm status for longer than expected, and was now expected to make landfall as a tropical storm, a tropical storm warning was issued from Mazatlán to <a href="/wiki/Atlata" id="w">Atlata</a>,<sup id="_ref-bevenlandsea18_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bevenlandsea18" title="">[24]</a></sup> which was later discontinued as Paul weakened to a tropical depression.<sup id="_ref-disco20_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disco20" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Emergency officials near the southern tip of Baja California closed schools,<sup id="_ref-fjdreu_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fjdreu" title="">[25]</a></sup>  while rescue workers ordered for the evacuation of more than 1,500 people from <a href="/wiki/Shanty_town" id="w">shanty towns</a>.
