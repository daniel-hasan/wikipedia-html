The <b>1960 New York air disaster</b> was a collision on December 16, 1960, between two <a href="/wiki/Airliner" id="w">airliners</a> over <a href="/wiki/Staten_Island" id="w">Staten Island</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, in which one plane crashed into Staten Island and the other airliner crashed into a <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn" id="w">Brooklyn</a> neighborhood.  The crash killed all 84 people aboard Flight 826 and 44 on Flight 266 as well as six people on the ground.</p>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/United_Airlines" id="w">United Airlines</a> Flight 826</b>, <i>Mainliner Will Rogers</i>, registration N8031U, was a <a href="/wiki/Douglas_DC-8" id="w">Douglas DC-8</a> en route from <a href="/wiki/O%26%2339%3BHare_Airport" id="w">O&#39;Hare Airport</a> in <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Illinois" id="w">Chicago</a> to <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport" id="w">New York International (Idlewild) Airport</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City%2C_New_York" id="w">New York City, New York</a>, on <a href="/wiki/December_16" id="w">December 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1960" id="w">1960</a>. <b><a href="/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines" id="w">Trans World Airlines</a> Flight 266</b>, <i>Star of Sicily</i>, registration N6907C, was a <a href="/wiki/Lockheed_Constellation" id="w">Lockheed Super Constellation</a> en route from <a href="/wiki/Dayton%2C_Ohio" id="w">Dayton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Columbus%2C_Ohio" id="w">Columbus, Ohio</a>, to New York&#39;s <a href="/wiki/LaGuardia_Airport" id="w">LaGuardia Airport</a>. The two aircraft collided in mid-air in heavy clouds a mile west of <a href="/wiki/Miller_Field_(Staten_Island)" id="w">Miller Field</a>, a military airfield on <a href="/wiki/Staten_Island" id="w">Staten Island</a>, at 10:33 AM <a href="/wiki/North_American_Eastern_Time_Zone" id="w">Eastern Time</a>. All 84 people aboard Flight 826, 44 on Flight 266 and six people on the ground were killed.</p>
<p>Weather conditions at the time were light rain and fog (which had been preceded by a snowfall)</p>
<p>According to information from the United&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Flight_recorder" id="w">flight recorder</a> (the first time a &#34;black box&#34; had been used to provide extensive details in a crash investigation) the United plane was 12 miles off course and in 81 seconds had dove 3,600 feet a minute and dropped its speed from more than 500 miles per hour to 363 miles per hour when it slammed into the right side of the TWA plane at between 5,250 and 5,175 feet.<sup id="_ref-TimesHighSpeed_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TimesHighSpeed" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The collision occurred about a mile west of Miller Field.  The TWA plane spiraled down disintegrating and dropping at least one passenger into a tree in the <a href="/wiki/New_Dorp" id="w">New Dorp</a> neighborhood.  The TWA plane crashed into an empty field at the northwest corner of the field -- although within a few feet of the neighborhood.<sup id="_ref-TimesHighSpeed_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TimesHighSpeed" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The United plane was supposed to have been circling a point called &#34;Preston&#34; off the New Jersey coast, was supposed to have been at 5,000 feet (and not diving down from 8,700 feet) and not traveling more than 240 miles per hour.  United was to say the ground beacon was not working (pilots testified on both sides of the issue).<sup id="_ref-TimesHighSpeed_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TimesHighSpeed" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>At 10:21 AM, Flight 826 advised its company radio operator that one of its VOR receivers had stopped working (although they did not notify air traffic controllers of the problem) but it made it difficult to fly on <a href="/wiki/Instrument_flight_rules" id="w">instrument conditions</a>. At 10:25 AM, <a href="/wiki/Air_traffic_control" id="w">air traffic control</a> issued a revised clearance for the flight to shorten its course to the Preston holding point by 12 miles. </p>
<p>The United Plane overshot the Preston holding point and at 10:33 AM they collided.</p>
<p>Following the collision, the crippled United DC-8 careened into the <a href="/wiki/Park_Slope%2C_Brooklyn" id="w">Park Slope</a> section of <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn" id="w">Brooklyn</a>, setting fire to 10 brownstone apartment buildings, the <a href="/wiki/Pillar_of_Fire_Church" id="w">Pillar of Fire Church</a>, the McCaddin Funeral Home, a Chinese laundry and a deli.  Wreckage was spewed over the <a class="externallink" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;geocode=&#38;q=Seventh+Avenue+at+Sterling+Place,+Brooklyn,+New+York&#38;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#38;sspn=26.951033,59.765625&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;ll=40.678409,-73.973694&#38;spn=0.050251,0.11673&#38;z=13&#38;om=1" rel="nofollow" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;geocode=&#38;q=Seventh+Avenue+at+Sterling+Place,+Brooklyn,+New+York&#38;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#38;sspn=26.951033,59.765625&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;ll=40.678409,-73.973694&#38;spn=0.050251,0.11673&#38;z=13&#38;om=1">Seventh  Avenue at Sterling Place</a> intersection, killing six people on the ground including a sanitation worker shoveling snow.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Although witnesses speculated at the time that United attempted an emergency landing in <a href="/wiki/Prospect_Park_(Brooklyn)" id="w">Prospect Park</a> or at <a href="/wiki/LaGuardia_Airport" id="w">LaGuardia Airport</a>, there is no evidence that the pilots had control of the DC-8 at any time after the mid-air collision.  There was no audible voice radio contact with traffic controllers from either plane after the collision although LaGuardia had begun tracking an incoming fast moving unidentified plane from Preston toward the LaGuardia &#34;Flatbush&#34; outer marker <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>TWA Flight 266 crashed into <a class="externallink" href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&#38;ll=40.568002,-74.099436&#38;spn=0.012584,0.029182&#38;z=15&#38;om=1" rel="nofollow" title="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&#38;ll=40.568002,-74.099436&#38;spn=0.012584,0.029182&#38;z=15&#38;om=1">Miller Army Field</a>, with some sections of the aircraft landing in <a href="/wiki/New_York_Harbor" id="w">New York Harbor</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> side.</p>
<p>The only initial survivor of the tragedy was 11-year-old <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Baltz" id="w">Stephen Baltz</a> of <a href="/wiki/Wilmette%2C_Illinois" id="w">Wilmette, Illinois</a>, a passenger on the United jet, who was thrown into a snowbank at impact.  He later died in Park Slope&#39;s New York Methodist Hospital a few blocks from crash.  Baltz told rescuers that moments before the collision he had looked out the window at the snow falling on the city.</p>
<dl><dd>It looked like a picture out of a fairy book.  It was a beautiful sight.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Pictures of Baltz appeared on many front pages around the world such as the <a href="/wiki/Syracuse_Post-Standard" id="w">Syracuse Post-Standard</a> repeating a story from the Associated Press in which he expressed concern about his mother who was waiting for him at the airport.  He gave the only description of the crash:</p>
<dl><dd>I heard a big noise while we were flying.  The last thing I remember was the plane falling.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>With a death toll of 134, the accident was the deadliest U.S. commercial aviation disaster at the time, topping the 1956 midair collision between <a href="/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_718" id="w">United Airlines Flight 718</a> and Trans World Airlines Flight 2 over <a href="/wiki/Arizona" id="w">Arizona</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Grand_Canyon" id="w">Grand Canyon</a> that killed 128.  </p>
<p>Filmmaker and critic <a href="/wiki/Hollis_Frampton" id="w">Hollis Frampton</a> was scheduled to be on the flight, but decided to leave the next day in order to see a retrospective of the work of <a href="/wiki/Edward_Weston" id="w">Edward Weston</a> in Minneapolis; he said of this decision that he was &#34;never...able to decide whether Weston tried to kill me, or saved my life.&#34; <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>United has not retired the use of 826 as a flight number.  However, as of October 2006 no United flights currently carry the designation.  The most recent route of United Flight 826 was on a San Francisco to Los Angeles route, and was last used on September 5, 2006.</p>
<p>United had named the ill-fated DC-8 after well known American entertainer <a href="/wiki/Will_Rogers" id="w">Will Rogers</a>. Along with <a href="/wiki/Wiley_Post" id="w">Wiley Post</a> he was killed in a plane crash near <a href="/wiki/Barrow%2C_Alaska" id="w">Barrow, Alaska</a> in 1935.</p>
<p>Within two months there would be two more major air disasters involving Idlewild Airport.</p>
<p>On January 19, 1961, an <a href="/wiki/Aeronaves_de_Mexico" id="w">Aeronaves de Mexico</a> DC-8 crashed on takeoff  into <a href="/wiki/Rockaway_Beach_Boulevard" id="w">Rockaway Beach Boulevard</a> from Idlewild in a snow storm killing four  – although 102 of the 106 passengers and crew escaped.</p>
<p>On January 28, 1961 an <a href="/wiki/American_Airlines" id="w">American Airlines</a> <a href="/wiki/Boeing_707" id="w">Boeing 707</a> Flight 1502 (Flagship Oklahoma) from Idlewild on a training mission nosedived 300 yards off Atlantic coast at <a href="/wiki/Napeague%2C_New_York" id="w">Napeague, New York</a> killing all six aboard.
