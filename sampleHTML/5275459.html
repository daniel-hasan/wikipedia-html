<p>{{History of Singapore}}
The <b>history of Singapore</b> began as early as the <a href="/wiki/3rd_Century" id="w">3rd Century</a> when a <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">Chinese</a> 
account described the island at the tip of the <a href="/wiki/Malay_peninsula" id="w">Malay peninsula</a>. Singapore rose in importance during the <a href="/wiki/14th_century" id="w">14th century</a> under the rule of Srivijayan prince <a href="/wiki/Parameswara_(sultan)" id="w">Parameswara</a> and became an important port until it was destroyed by Portuguese raiders in 1613. The modern history of Singapore began in 1819 when <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">Englishman</a> <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Stamford_Raffles" id="w">Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles</a> established a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Port" id="w">port</a> on the island. Under British <a href="/wiki/Colonialism" id="w">colonial</a> rule, it grew in importance as a centre for both the <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>-<a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> <a href="/wiki/Trade" id="w">trade</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Entrep%C3%B4t" id="w">entrepôt</a> trade in Southeast Asia, rapidly becoming a major port city. </p>
<p>During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, Singapore was conquered and occupied by the <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" id="w">Japanese Empire</a> from 1942 to 1945. When the war ended, Singapore reverted to British control, with increasing levels of <a href="/wiki/Self-governance" id="w">self-government</a> being granted, culminating in <a href="/wiki/Singapore_in_Malaysia" id="w">Singapore&#39;s merger</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya" id="w">Federation of Malaya</a> to form <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" id="w">Malaysia</a> in 1963. However, social unrest and disputes between Singapore&#39;s ruling <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Action_Party" id="w">People&#39;s Action Party</a> and Malaysia&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Barisan_Nasional" id="w">Alliance Party</a> resulted in Singapore&#39;s expulsion from Malaysia. Singapore became an <a href="/wiki/Independence" id="w">independent</a> <a href="/wiki/Republic" id="w">republic</a> on <a href="/wiki/9_August" id="w">9 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1965" id="w">1965</a>. </p>
<p>Facing severe unemployment and a housing crisis, Singapore embarked on a modernisation programme that focused on establishing a manufacturing industry, developing large public housing estates and investing heavily on public education. Since independence, Singapore&#39;s economy has grown by an average of nine percent each year. By the 1990s, the country has become one of the world&#39;s most prosperous nations, with a highly-<a href="/wiki/Economic_development" id="w">developed</a> <a href="/wiki/Free_market_economy" id="w">free market economy</a>, strong <a href="/wiki/International_trade" id="w">international trading</a> links, and the highest <a href="/wiki/Per_capita" id="w">per capita</a> <a href="/wiki/Gross_domestic_product" id="w">gross domestic product</a> in Asia outside of <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

When he saw a strange creature, which he mistakenly thought was a <a href="/wiki/Asiatic_lion" id="w">lion</a>, the prince took this as an auspicious sign and founded a settlement called Singapura, which means &#34;Lion City&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Sanskrit" id="w">Sanskrit</a>.<sup id="_ref-uslcPrecolonial_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcPrecolonial" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

The <a href="/wiki/Nagarakretagama" id="w">Nagarakretagama</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Java_(island)" id="w">Javanese</a> epic poem written in 1365, also referred to a settlement on the island called <a href="/wiki/Temasek" id="w">Temasek</a> (<i>Sea Town</i>). <a href="/wiki/Archaeology_in_Singapore" id="w">Recent excavations</a> in <a href="/wiki/Fort_Canning" id="w">Fort Canning</a> found evidences indicating that Singapore was an important port in the 14th century.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the <a href="/wiki/Malay_archipelago" id="w">Malay archipelago</a> was gradually taken over by the <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> <a href="/wiki/Colonialism" id="w">colonial</a> powers, beginning with the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_Empire" id="w">Portuguese</a> at <a href="/wiki/Malacca" id="w">Malacca</a> in 1509. The early dominance of the Portuguese was challenged during the 17th century by the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_colonial_empire" id="w">Dutch</a>, who came to control most of the ports in the region. The Dutch established a <a href="/wiki/Monopoly" id="w">monopoly</a> over trade within the archipelago, particularly in <a href="/wiki/Spice" id="w">spices</a>, then the region&#39;s most important product. Other colonial powers, including the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British</a>, were limited to a relatively minor presence.<sup id="_ref-uslcFounding_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcFounding" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1818, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Stamford_Raffles" id="w">Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles</a> was appointed as the Lieutenant Governor of the British colony at <a href="/wiki/Bencoolen" id="w">Bencoolen</a>. He was determined that British should replace the Dutch as the dominant power in the archipelago, since the trade route between <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> and <a href="/wiki/British_Raj" id="w">British India</a>, which had become vitally important with the institution of the <a href="/wiki/Opium" id="w">opium</a> trade with China, passed through the archipelago. The Dutch had been stifling British trade in the region by prohibiting the British from operating in Dutch-controlled ports or by subjecting them with high tariff. Raffles hoped to challenge the Dutch by establishing a new port along the <a href="/wiki/Straits_of_Malacca" id="w">Straits of Malacca</a>, the main ship passageway for the India-China trade. He convinced <a href="/wiki/Francis_Rawdon-Hastings%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Hastings" id="w">Lord Hastings</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Governor-General_of_India" id="w">Governor-General of India</a> and his superior at the <a href="/wiki/British_East_India_Company" id="w">British East India Company</a>, to fund an expedition to seek a new British base in the region.<sup id="_ref-uslcFounding_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcFounding" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>

<p>Raffles arrived in Singapore on <a href="/wiki/29_January" id="w">29 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1819" id="w">1819</a> and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port. It lay at the southern tip of the Malay peninsula, near the Straits of Malacca, and possessed a natural deep harbour, fresh water supplies, and timber for repairing ships. Raffles found a small Malay settlement, with a population of a few hundreds, at the mouth of the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_River" id="w">Singapore River</a>, headed by <a href="/wiki/Temenggong" id="w">Temenggong</a> <a href="/wiki/Abdu%26%2339%3Br_Rahman" id="w">Abdu&#39;r Rahman</a>. The island was nominally ruled by the <a href="/wiki/Sultan_of_Johor" id="w">Sultan of Johor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tengku_Rahman" id="w">Tengku Rahman</a>, who was controlled by the Dutch and the <a href="/wiki/Bugis" id="w">Bugis</a>. However, the Sultanate was weakened by factional division and Temenggong Abdu&#39;r Rahman and his officials were loyal to Tengku Rahman&#39;s elder brother <a href="/wiki/Hussein_Shah_of_Johor" id="w">Tengku Hussein</a> (or Tengku Long) who was living in exile in <a href="/wiki/Riau_Islands" id="w">Riau</a>. With the Temenggong&#39;s help, Raffles managed to smuggle Hussein back into Singapore. He offered to recognise Hussein as the rightful Sultan of Johor and provide him with a yearly payment; in return, Hussein would grant the British the right to establish a trading post on Singapore.<sup id="_ref-uslcFounding_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcFounding" title="">[6]</a></sup> A formal treaty was signed on <a href="/wiki/6_February" id="w">6 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1819" id="w">1819</a> and modern Singapore was born.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Raffles returned to Bencoolen soon after the signing of the treaty and left <a href="/wiki/William_Farquhar" id="w">Major William Farquhar</a> in charge of the new settlement, with some artillery and a small regiment of Indian soldiers. Establishing a trading port from scratch was a daunting endeavour.  Farquhar&#39;s administration was poorly funded and was prohibited from collecting port duties to raise revenue as Raffles had decided that Singapore would be a <a href="/wiki/Free_port" id="w">free port</a>. In spite of these difficulties, the new colony grew rapidly. As news of the free port spread across the archipelago, <a href="/wiki/Bugis" id="w">Bugis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peranakan" id="w">Peranakan Chinese</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Arab" id="w">Arab</a> traders flocked to the island, seeking to circumvent the Dutch trade restrictions. During the first year of operation, $400,000 (<a href="/wiki/Spanish_dollar" id="w">Spanish dollars</a>) worth of trade passed through Singapore. By 1821, the island&#39;s population had increased to around 5,000, and the trade volume was $8 million. The population reached the 10,000 mark in 1825, and with a trade volume of $22 million, Singapore surpassed the long-established port of <a href="/wiki/Penang" id="w">Penang</a>.<sup id="_ref-uslcFounding_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcFounding" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Raffles returned to Singapore in 1822 and became critical of many of Farquhar&#39;s decisions, despite Farquhar&#39;s success in leading the settlement through its difficult early years.  In order to generate much-needed revenue, Farquhar had resorted to selling licenses for <a href="/wiki/Gambling" id="w">gambling</a> and the sale of opium, which Raffles saw as social evils. Shocked at the disarray of the colony, Raffles set about drafting a set of new policies for the settlement. He also organised Singapore into functional and ethnic subdivisions under the <i><a href="/wiki/Raffles_Plan_of_Singapore" id="w">Raffles Plan of Singapore</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-uslcFounding_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcFounding" title="">[6]</a></sup> Today, remnants of this organisation can still be found in the <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_Singapore" id="w">ethnic neighbourhoods</a>.  </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/7_June" id="w">7 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1823" id="w">1823</a>, Raffles signed a second treaty with the Sultan and Temenggong, which extended British possession to most of the island. The Sultan and Temenggong gave up most of their administrative rights of the island, including the collection of port taxes, in return for lifelong monthly payments of $1500 and $800 respectively. This agreement brought the island under the British law, with the provison that it would take into account Malay customs, traditions and religion.<sup id="_ref-uslcFounding_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcFounding" title="">[6]</a></sup> Raffles replaced Farquhar with <a href="/wiki/John_Crawfurd" id="w">John Crawfurd</a>, an efficient and frugal administrator, as the new governor.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  In October 1823, Raffles departed for Britain and would never return to Singapore as he died in 1826, at the age of 44.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>The establishment of a British outpost in Singapore was initially in doubt as the Dutch government soon protested to Britain for violating their sphere of influence. But as Singapore rapidly emerged as an important trading post, Britain consolidated its claim on the island. The status of Singapore as a British possession was cemented by the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Dutch_Treaty_of_1824" id="w">Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824</a>, which carved up the Malay archipelago between the two colonial powers with the area north of the Straits of Malacca, including Singapore, falling under British&#39;s sphere of influence. In 1826, Singapore was grouped together with Penang and Malacca to form the <a href="/wiki/Straits_Settlements" id="w">Straits Settlements</a>, administrated by the <a href="/wiki/British_East_India_Company" id="w">British East India Company</a>. In 1830, the Straits Settlements became a <i>residency</i>, or subdivision, of the <a href="/wiki/Bengal_Presidency" id="w">Presidency of Bengal</a> in <a href="/wiki/British_India" id="w">British India</a>.<sup id="_ref-uslcFlourishing_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcFlourishing" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the subsequent decades, Singapore grew to become an important port in the region. Its success was due to several reasons including the opening of market in China, the advent of ocean-going <a href="/wiki/Steamboat" id="w">steamships</a>, and the production of <a href="/wiki/Rubber" id="w">rubber</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tin" id="w">tin</a> in Malaya.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Its status as a free port provided crucial advantage over other colonial port cities in Batavia (<a href="/wiki/Jakarta" id="w">Jakarta</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Manila" id="w">Manila</a> where tariffs were levied, and it drew many Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Arab traders operating in South-East Asia to Singapore. The later opening of the <a href="/wiki/Suez_Canal" id="w">Suez Canal</a> in 1869 would further boost trade in Singapore. By 1880, over 1.5 million tons of goods were passing through Singapore each year, with around 80% of the cargo transported by steamships.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The main commercial activity was <a href="/wiki/Entrep%C3%B4t" id="w">entrepôt</a> trade which flourished under no taxation and little restriction. Many merchant houses were set up in Singapore mainly by European trading firms, but also by Jewish, Chinese, Arab, Armenian, American and Indian merchants. There were also many Chinese middlemen who handled most of the trade between the European and Asian merchants.<sup id="_ref-uslcFlourishing_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcFlourishing" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>By 1827, the Chinese became the largest ethnic group in Singapore. They consisted of <a href="/wiki/Peranakan" id="w">Peranakans</a>, who were descendants of early Chinese settlers, and Chinese <a href="/wiki/Coolie" id="w">coolies</a> who flocked to Singapore to escape the economic hardship in southern China due to the <a href="/wiki/Opium_Wars" id="w">Opium Wars</a>. Many arrived in Singapore as impoverished <a href="/wiki/Indentured_servant" id="w">indentured labourers</a> and they were predominantly males. The Malays were the second largest ethnic group until the 1860s and they worked as fishermen, craftsmen, or as wage earners while continued to live mostly in <a href="/wiki/Kampung" id="w">kampungs</a>. By 1860, the <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">Indians</a> became the second largest ethnic group. They consisted of unskilled labourers, traders, and convicts who were sent to carry out public works projects such as clearing jungles and laying out roads. There were also Indian <a href="/wiki/Sepoy" id="w">Sepoy</a> troops garrisoned at Singapore by the British.<sup id="_ref-uslcFlourishing_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcFlourishing" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite Singapore&#39;s growing importance, the administration governing the island was understaffed, ineffectual and were unconcerned with the welfare of the populace. Administrators were usually posted from India and were unfamiliar with local culture and languages. While the population had quadrupled during 1830 to 1867, the size of the civil service in Singapore had remained unchanged. Most people had no access to public health services and diseases such as <a href="/wiki/Cholera" id="w">cholera</a> and <a href="/wiki/Smallpox" id="w">smallpox</a> caused severe health problem, especially in overcrowded working-class areas.<sup id="_ref-uslcFlourishing_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcFlourishing" title="">[11]</a></sup> As a result of the administration&#39;s ineffectiveness and the predominantly male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the society was lawless and chaotic. In 1850 there were only twelve police officers in the city of nearly 60,000 people. <a href="/wiki/Prostitution" id="w">Prostitution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gambling" id="w">gambling</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Drug_abuse" id="w">drug abuse</a> (particularly of opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal <a href="/wiki/Secret_societies_in_Singapore" id="w">secret societies</a> (analogous to modern-day <a href="/wiki/Triad_society" id="w">triads</a>) were extremely powerful, and some had tens of thousands of members. Turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to hundreds of deaths and attempts to suppress them had limited success.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/7_December" id="w">7 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, Japan <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" id="w">attacked Pearl Harbor</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_War" id="w">Pacific War</a> began in earnest. One of Japan&#39;s objectives was to capture <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" id="w">Southeast Asia</a> and secure the rich supply of <a href="/wiki/Natural_resource" id="w">natural resources</a> to feed its military and industry needs. Singapore, the main Allied base in the region, was an obvious military target. The British military commanders in Singapore had believed that the Japanese attack would come by sea from the south, since the dense Malayan jungle in the north would serve as a natural barrier against invasion. Although the British had drawn up a plan for dealing with an attack on northern Malaya, preparations were never completed. The military was confident that &#34;Fortress Singapore&#34; would withstand any Japanese attack and this confidence was further reinforced by the arrival of Force Z, a squadron of British warships dispatched to the defense of Singapore, including the <a href="/wiki/Battleship" id="w">battleship</a> <i><a href="/wiki/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_(1939)" id="w">HMS Prince of Wales</a></i>, and <a href="/wiki/Cruiser" id="w">cruiser</a> <i><a href="/wiki/HMS_Repulse_(1916)" id="w">HMS Repulse</a></i>.

On the social front, an aggressive and well-funded <a href="/wiki/Housing_and_Development_Board" id="w">public housing program</a> was launched to solve the long-standing housing problem.

<p>Despite their successes in governing Singapore, the PAP leaders, including Lee and Goh, believed that Singapore&#39;s future lay with Malaya. They felt that the historical and economic ties between Singapore and Malaya were too strong for them to continue as separate nations, and they campaigned vigorously for a merger. On the other hand, the sizeable pro-communist wing of the PAP were strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence as the ruling party of Malaya, <a href="/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation" id="w">United Malays National Organisation</a>, was staunchly anti-communist and would support the non-communist faction of PAP against them. The UMNO leaders were also skeptical of the merger idea due to their distrust of the PAP government and concerns that the large Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended. The issue came to a head in 1961 when pro-communist PAP minister <a href="/wiki/Ong_Eng_Guan" id="w">Ong Eng Guan</a> defected from the party and beat a PAP candidate in a subsequent <a href="/wiki/By-election" id="w">by-election</a>, a move that threatened to bring down Lee&#39;s government. Faced with the prospect of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO did an about-face on the merger. On <a href="/wiki/27_May" id="w">27 May</a>, Malaya&#39;s Prime Minister, <a href="/wiki/Tunku_Abdul_Rahman" id="w">Tunku Abdul Rahman</a>, mooted the idea of a <a href="/wiki/Federation_of_Malaysia" id="w">Federation of Malaysia</a>, comprised of the existing Federation of Malaya, Singapore, <a href="/wiki/Brunei" id="w">Brunei</a> and the British Borneo territories of <a href="/wiki/Sabah" id="w">Sabah</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sarawak" id="w">Sarawak</a>.

<p>The Malaysia proposal ignited the long-brewing conflict between the moderates and pro-communists within the PAP. The pro-communists, led by <a href="/wiki/Lim_Chin_Siong" id="w">Lim Chin Siong</a>, left the PAP to form a new opposition party, the <a href="/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis" id="w">Barisan Sosialis</a> (Socialist Front), to campaign against entry into Malaysia under the PAP&#39;s plan. In response, Lee <a href="/wiki/1962_Merger_Referendum_of_Singapore" id="w">called for a referendum</a> on the merger and campaigned vigorously for his proposal, aided by the government&#39;s strong influence over the media.

</p><a id="Merger" name="Merger"></a><h2>Merger</h2>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/16_September" id="w">16 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>, Malaya, Singapore, <a href="/wiki/Sabah" id="w">Sabah</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sarawak" id="w">Sarawak</a> were formally merged and Malaysia was formed.  For Singapore, the merger was thought to benefit the economy by creating a common free market, eliminating trade tariffs, and solving unemployment woes. The British government approved the merger, convinced that Singapore&#39;s security would be safeguarded within the much larger Malaysia. </p>
<p>The union was rocky from the start. During the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_general_election%2C_1963" id="w">1963 Singapore state elections</a>, a local branch of <a href="/wiki/United_Malays_National_Organisation" id="w">UMNO</a> took part in the election despite an earlier UMNO&#39;s agreement with the PAP not to participate in the state&#39;s politics during Malaysia&#39;s formative years. Although UMNO lost all its bids, relations between PAP and UMNO worsened as the PAP, in a tit-for-tat, challenged UMNO candidates in the 1964 federal election as part of the <a href="/wiki/Malaysian_Solidarity_Convention" id="w">Malaysian Solidarity Convention</a>, winning one seat in Malaysian Parliament.</p>
<a id="Racial_tension" name="Racial_tension"></a><h2>Racial tension</h2>
<p>Racial tensions increased dramatically within a year and was fuelled by <a href="/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis" id="w">Barisan Sosialis</a>&#39;s tactics of stirring up communal sentiment to discredit the government of Singapore and the federal government of Malaysia.{{Fact}} In particular, the Chinese in Singapore disdained being discriminated against by the federal policies of <a href="/wiki/Affirmative_action" id="w">affirmative action</a>, which granted special privileges to the Malays guaranteed under <a href="/wiki/Article_153_of_the_Constitution_of_Malaysia" id="w">Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia</a>. There were also other financial and economic benefits that were preferentially given to Malays. Lee Kuan Yew and other political leaders began advocating for the fair and equal treatment of all races in Malaysia, with a rallying cry of <i>&#34;<a href="/wiki/Malaysian_Malaysia" id="w">Malaysian Malaysia</a>!&#34;</i>. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Malays in Singapore were being increasingly incited by the federal government&#39;s accusations that the PAP was mistreating the Malays. The external political situation was also tense when <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" id="w">Indonesian</a> President <a href="/wiki/Sukarno" id="w">Sukarno</a> declared a state of <i><a href="/wiki/Indonesia-Malaysia_confrontation" id="w">Konfrontasi</a></i> (Confrontation) against Malaysia and initiated military and other actions against the new nation, including the <a href="/wiki/MacDonald_House_bombing" id="w">bombing of MacDonald House</a> in Singapore in March 1965 by Indonesian commandos, killing three people.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Indonesia also conducted sedition activities to provoke the Malays against the Chinese.<sup id="_ref-uslcRoadToIndependence_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcRoadToIndependence" title="">[29]</a></sup> Numerous racial riots resulted and curfews were frequently imposed to restore order. The most notorious riots were the <a href="/wiki/1964_Race_Riots" id="w">1964 Race Riots</a> that first took place on Prophet <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" id="w">Muhammad</a>&#39;s birthday on <a href="/wiki/21_July" id="w">21 July</a> with twenty three people killed and hundreds injured. During the unrest, the price of food skyrocketed when transport system was disrupted, causing further hardship for the people. </p>
<p>The state and federal governments also had conflicts on the economic front. UMNO leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore would inevitably shift political power away from <a href="/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur" id="w">Kuala Lumpur</a>. Despite earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans previously agreed to for the economic development of the two eastern states. The situation escalated to such intensity that talks soon broke down and abusive speeches and writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the <a href="/wiki/Arrest" id="w">arrest</a> of <a href="/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew" id="w">Lee Kuan Yew</a>.</p>

<p>After gaining independence abruptly, the future of Singapore was filled with uncertainties. The <a href="/wiki/Konfrontasi" id="w">Konfrontasi</a> was on-going and conservative UMNO faction strongly opposed the separation; Singapore faced the danger of being attacked by Indonesian military or forcibly re-absorbed into the Malaysia Federation in unfavourable terms.

<p>As a small island nation, Singapore was seen as inadequate to be a viable country and much of the international <a href="/wiki/Mass_media" id="w">media</a> was skeptical of prospects for Singapore&#39;s survival. Besides the issue of sovereignty, the pressing problems were unemployment, housing, education, and the lack of <a href="/wiki/Natural_resource" id="w">natural resources</a> and <a href="/wiki/Landform" id="w">land</a>.<sup id="_ref-uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence" title="">[35]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Unemployment_rate" id="w">Unemployment rate</a> was ranging between 10-12% threatening to trigger civil unrest. </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Economic_Development_Board" id="w">Economic Development Board</a> was set up in 1961 to formulate and implement national economic strategies, focusing on promoting Singapore&#39;s manufacturing sector.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Industrial_estate" id="w">Industrial estates</a> were set up, especially in <a href="/wiki/Jurong" id="w">Jurong</a>, and foreign <a href="/wiki/Investment" id="w">investment</a> was attracted to the country with tax incentives. The <a href="/wiki/Industrialization" id="w">industrialisation</a> transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The <a href="/wiki/Service_industry" id="w">service industry</a> also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. These progresses helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like <a href="/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell" id="w">Shell</a> and <a href="/wiki/Esso" id="w">Esso</a> to establish <a href="/wiki/Oil_refineries" id="w">oil refineries</a> in Singapore which, by the mid 1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world.<sup id="_ref-uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence" title="">[35]</a></sup> The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised on practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry. </p>
<p>The lack of good public housing, poor <a href="/wiki/Sanitation" id="w">sanitation</a>, and high unemployment led to social problems from crime to health issues.

<p>Further economic success continued through the 1980s onwards, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% during this time until 1999.
