<b><i>The Answer</i></b> is the fifty-third book in the <b><a href="/wiki/Animorphs" id="w">Animorphs</a></b> series.</p>
<a id="Plot_summary" name="Plot_summary"></a><h1>Plot summary</h1>
<p>Sensing that the end is near after the destruction of the <a href="/wiki/Yeerk" id="w">Yeerk</a> pool, <a href="/wiki/Jake_Berenson" id="w">Jake</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marco_(Animorphs)" id="w">Marco</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tobias_(Animorphs)" id="w">Tobias</a> watch as the Pool Ship lands amidst the crater. Tobias, however, learns of another Yeerk pool under construction, and Jake decides to delay its progress by taking out the <a href="/wiki/Taxxon" id="w">Taxxons</a>.  Tom acquires a jaguar morph, and both Jake and James lead their teams to battle.</p>
<p>In the ensuing confusion, Jake finds himself underground and at the mercy of a trio of Taxxons. To his astonishment, however, one turns out to be the <i>nothlit</i> <a href="/wiki/Arbron" id="w">Arbron</a>, missing since the enslaving of the Taxxon homeworld. Arbron, the newly-appointed leader of the Taxxons, tells Jake to return to him the next night with the promise that the Taxxons may become nothlits themselves, and the Taxxons will fight alongside the Animorphs. Jake goes to <a href="/wiki/Cassie_(Animorphs)" id="w">Cassie</a> for help in choosing a morph, and she selects an anaconda. Jake, with his friends in tow, returns to Arbron and makes his pact with the Taxxons. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, the Yeerk infesting Jake&#39;s brother <a href="/wiki/List_of_minor_humans_(Animorphs)#Tom Berenson" id="w">Tom</a> appears as well, claiming he and some of his followers will also aid the Animorphs, in exchange for the Blade Ship and safe passage after the war&#39;s end. Suspecting a trap, Jake agrees while setting his own plan into motion. Arbron&#39;s Taxxons are set to destroy the new Yeerk pool. Marco and Cassie capture <a href="/wiki/List_of_minor_humans_(Animorphs)#Hedrick Chapman" id="w">Chapman</a> and bring <a href="/wiki/Erek_King" id="w">Erek King</a> to Jake, who tells the android that Chapman will be killed if Erek does not help them. <a href="/wiki/Rachel_(Animorphs)" id="w">Rachel</a> is sent on a mysterious mission. </p>
<p>Jake also enlists the help of an army general in the area, General Doubleday, and the auxiliary Animorphs, to form a distraction. Tom betrays them to <a href="/wiki/Esplin_9466" id="w">Esplin 9466</a>, but the Animorphs had anticipated this, and manage to avoid the trap.  This is done through Erek; when Tom delivers &#34;Cassie&#34; to Visser Three, a Taxxon (Tobias in morph) &#34;eats&#34; her, which is actually a projection by Erek.  He is then &#34;taken&#34; away by Hork-Bajir, who are actually Toby and her allies.  Tom is given command of the Blade Ship to put the Taxxons back in line.</p>
<p>On the Pool Ship, the Animorphs and Erek set about disabling systems.  Erek disables the laser cannon, but by then much of Doubleday&#39;s division and the <a href="/wiki/Auxiliary_Animorphs" id="w">auxiliary Animorphs</a> have been annihilated.  Tom betrays the Visser yet again and swings to battle the Pool Ship.  The Animorphs drain the Yeerk Pool to provide a distraction.  Erek disables the engines, and the ship becomes effectively useless. </p>
<p>The Visser, battle-weary and apathetic, confronts them on the bridge and warns of Tom&#39;s danger.  Tom hails the Blade Ship and crows about his apparent victory.  However, when he sees Jake in morph, he realizes that he has been tricked, and orders the Blade Ship to aim and fire.  Jake orders Rachel, who is hiding on the Blade Ship, to attack.</p>
