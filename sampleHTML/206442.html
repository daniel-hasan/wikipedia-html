<b>Aaron Benjamin Sorkin</b> (born <a href="/wiki/June_9" id="w">June 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/1961" id="w">1961</a>) is an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Screenwriter" id="w">screenwriter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Television_producer" id="w">producer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Playwright" id="w">playwright</a>. After graduating from <a href="/wiki/Syracuse_University" id="w">Syracuse University</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Fine_Arts" id="w">Bachelor of Fine Arts</a> degree in <a href="/wiki/Musical_Theatre" id="w">Musical Theatre</a> in 1983, Sorkin spent much of the 1980s in New York as a struggling, largely unemployed actor.<sup id="_ref-syracuse-interview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-syracuse-interview" title="">[1]</a></sup> He found his passion in writing plays, and quickly established himself as a young promising playwright. His stageplay <i><a href="/wiki/A_Few_Good_Men" id="w">A Few Good Men</a></i> caught the attention of Hollywood producer <a href="/wiki/David_Brown_(producer)" id="w">David Brown</a>, who bought the film rights before the play even premiered.<sup id="_ref-MovieMoguls_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MovieMoguls" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Castle_Rock_Entertainment" id="w">Castle Rock Entertainment</a> hired Sorkin to adapt <i>A Few Good Men</i> for the big screen. The movie, directed by <a href="/wiki/Rob_Reiner" id="w">Rob Reiner</a>, became a box office success. Sorkin spent the early 1990s writing two other screenplays at Castle Rock for the films <i><a href="/wiki/Malice_(film)" id="w">Malice</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_American_President_(film)" id="w">The American President</a></i>. In the mid-1990s he worked as a <a href="/wiki/Script_doctor" id="w">script doctor</a> on films such as <i><a href="/wiki/Schindler%26%2339%3Bs_List" id="w">Schindler&#39;s List</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Bulworth" id="w">Bulworth</a></i>. In 1998 his television career began when he created the TV comedy series <i><a href="/wiki/Sports_Night" id="w">Sports Night</a></i> for the <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" id="w">ABC</a> network. <i>Sports Night<b>s second season was its last, and in 1999 overlapped with the debut of Sorkin&#39;s next TV series, the multiple-<a href="/wiki/Emmy_Award" id="w">Emmy</a>-award-winning political drama <i><a href="/wiki/The_West_Wing_(TV_series)" id="w">The West Wing</a></i>, this time for the <a href="/wiki/NBC" id="w">NBC</a> network. He left <i>The West Wing</i> at the end of its fourth season in <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>, after which it continued three more seasons without him. He returned to television in 2006 with a <a href="/wiki/Dramedy" id="w">dramedy</a> called <i><a href="/wiki/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip" id="w">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a></i>, about the backstage drama at a late night sketch comedy show, once again for the NBC network. While Sorkin&#39;s return was met with high expectations and a lot of early online buzz before <i> Studio 60&#39;s</i> premiere,  NBC did not renew it after its first season in which it suffered from low ratings and mixed reception in the press and on the Internet. His most recent feature film screenplay is <i><a href="/wiki/Charlie_Wilson%26%2339%3Bs_War" id="w">Charlie Wilson&#39;s War</a></i><sup id="_ref-HR-Grove_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HR-Grove" title="">[3]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>After more than a decade away from the theatre, Sorkin returned to adapt for the stage his screenplay <i><a href="/wiki/The_Farnsworth_Invention" id="w">The Farnsworth Invention</a></i>, which started a workshop run at <a href="/wiki/La_Jolla_Playhouse" id="w">La Jolla Playhouse</a> in <a href="/wiki/February_2007" id="w">February 2007</a> and which is slated to open on <a href="/wiki/Broadway_Theatre" id="w">Broadway</a> in <a href="/wiki/November_2007" id="w">November 2007</a>.<sup id="_ref-Back-to-Broadway_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Back-to-Broadway" title="">[4]</a></sup> He has battled with a cocaine addiction for many years, but after a highly publicized arrest he received treatment in a drug diversion program and rid himself of the drug dependence. In television, Sorkin is known as a controlling writer, who rarely shares the job of penning the <a href="/wiki/Screenplay#Television" id="w">teleplays</a> with other writers. His writing staff are more likely to do research and come up with stories for him to tell. His trademark is writing rapid-fire dialogue and extended <a href="/wiki/Monologue#Soliloquy (monologue in drama)" id="w">soliloquies</a>, and in television, this penchant is complemented by frequent collaborator <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Schlamme" id="w">Thomas Schlamme</a>&#39;s characteristic visual technique called the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Walk_and_talk" id="w">Walk and Talk</a>&#34;.</p>
<a id="Early_years" name="Early_years"></a><h1>Early years</h1>
<p>Sorkin was born in the <a href="/wiki/Borough_(New_York_City)" id="w">borough</a> of <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" id="w">Manhattan</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> to <a href="/wiki/American_Jews" id="w">Jewish</a> parents, and was raised in the wealthy suburb of <a href="/wiki/Scarsdale%2C_New_York" id="w">Scarsdale, New York</a>.<sup id="_ref-USWeekly-Jones_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USWeekly-Jones" title="">[5]</a></sup> Sorkin&#39;s mother was a school teacher and his father a lawyer; he had an older sister and brother who both went on to become lawyers.<sup id="_ref-DeJonge-interview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DeJonge-interview" title="">[6]</a></sup> Sorkin took an early interest in acting. Before he reached his teenage years, his parents regularly took him to the theatre to see shows such as <i><a href="/wiki/Who%26%2339%3Bs_Afraid_of_Virginia_Woolf%3F" id="w">Who&#39;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/That_Championship_Season" id="w">That Championship Season</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-CharlieRose-2000_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CharlieRose-2000" title="">[7]</a></sup> At that age, Sorkin did not always comprehend the plot of the plays; nevertheless he enjoyed the sound of the dialogue.<sup id="_ref-TheAge-Forrest_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TheAge-Forrest" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sorkin attended <a href="/wiki/Scarsdale_High_School" id="w">Scarsdale High School</a> where he became involved in his high school drama and theatre club. In eighth grade he played General Bullmoose in the musical <i><a href="/wiki/Li%26%2339%3Bl_Abner_(musical)" id="w">Li&#39;l Abner</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-syracuse-interview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-syracuse-interview" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1979 Sorkin attended <a href="/wiki/Syracuse_University" id="w">Syracuse University</a>. In his <a href="/wiki/Student#Years" id="w">freshman year</a> he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback because he wanted to be an actor, and the Drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. He returned in his sophomore year determined to do better, and graduated in 1983 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Musical Theatre.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>After graduation, Sorkin moved to New York City where he worked odd jobs ranging from delivering <a href="/wiki/Singing_telegram" id="w">singing telegrams</a>,<sup id="_ref-syracuse-interview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-syracuse-interview" title="">[1]</a></sup> driving a limousine, touring Alabama with the children’s theatre company Traveling Playhouse,<sup id="_ref-DeJonge-interview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DeJonge-interview" title="">[6]</a></sup> handing out fliers promoting a hunting-and-fishing show,<sup id="_ref-syracuse-interview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-syracuse-interview" title="">[1]</a></sup> to bartending on <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" id="w">Broadway</a> at theatres such as the <a href="/wiki/Palace_Theatre%2C_New_York" id="w">Palace Theatre</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> One weekend, while house sitting at a friend&#39;s place he found an <a href="/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter" id="w">IBM Selectric typewriter</a>, started typing, and &#34;felt a phenomenal confidence and a kind of joy that [he] had never experienced before in [his] life.&#34;<sup id="_ref-DeJonge-interview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DeJonge-interview" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>He continued writing and eventually put together his first play <i>Removing All Doubt</i> which he sent to his old theatre teacher, Arthur Storch, who was impressed.  In 1984, <i>Removing All Doubt</i> was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University.<sup id="_ref-Yahoo-Bio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yahoo-Bio" title="">[11]</a></sup>  After that, he wrote <i><a href="/wiki/Hidden_in_this_Picture" id="w">Hidden in this Picture</a></i> which debuted <a href="/wiki/Off-Off-Broadway" id="w">off-off-Broadway</a> at Steve Olsen&#39;s West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> in 1988.  The contents of his first two plays got him a <a href="/wiki/Talent_agent#Writer&#39;s Agents" id="w">theatrical agent</a>.<sup id="_ref-Weiss-seminar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weiss-seminar" title="">[12]</a></sup>  Producer John A. McQuiggan saw the production of <i>Hidden in this Picture</i> and commissioned Sorkin to turn the one-act into a full-length play called <i>Making Movies</i>.<sup id="_ref-Yahoo-Bio_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yahoo-Bio" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NYT-review3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT-review3" title="">[13]</a></sup>  His reputation as a playwright was quickly gaining stature on the New York theatre scene.</p>
<a id="''A_Few_Good_Men''" name="''A_Few_Good_Men''"></a><h2>&#39;&#39;A Few Good Men&#39;&#39;</h2>
<p>Sorkin got the inspiration to write his next play, a courtroom drama called <i><a href="/wiki/A_Few_Good_Men" id="w">A Few Good Men</a></i>, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah, who had graduated from <a href="/wiki/Boston_University_School_of_Law" id="w">Boston University Law School</a> and signed up for a 3-year stint with the <a href="/wiki/Judge_Advocate_General%26%2339%3Bs_Corps%2C_U.S._Navy" id="w">Navy Judge Advocate General&#39;s Corps</a>.  She was going to <a href="/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_Naval_Base" id="w">Guantanamo Bay</a> to defend a group of <a href="/wiki/Marine_corps" id="w">marines</a> who came close to killing a fellow marine in a <a href="/wiki/Hazing" id="w">hazing</a> ordered by a superior officer.  Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre on Broadway.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1988 Sorkin sold the film rights for his play <i>A Few Good Men</i> to producer <a href="/wiki/David_Brown_(producer)" id="w">David Brown</a> before it even premiered, for a deal possibly worth a sum well into six-figures.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  Brown had read an article in <i>The New York Times</i> about Sorkin&#39;s one-act play <i>Hidden in this Picture</i> and found out Sorkin also had a play called <i>A Few Good Men</i> that was having off-Broadway readings.<sup id="_ref-MovieMoguls_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MovieMoguls" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Brown produced <i>A Few Good Men</i> on Broadway at the <a href="/wiki/Music_Box_Theatre" id="w">Music Box Theatre</a>. It starred <a href="/wiki/Tom_Hulce" id="w">Tom Hulce</a> and was directed by <a href="/wiki/Don_Scardino" id="w">Don Scardino</a>. After opening in late 1989, it ran for 497 performances.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sorkin continued writing <i>Making Movies</i> and in 1990 it debuted <a href="/wiki/Off-Broadway" id="w">off-Broadway</a> at the Promenade Theatre, produced by John A. McQuiggan and directed by Don Scardino.<sup id="_ref-NYT-review3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT-review3" title="">[13]</a></sup>  Meanwhile, David Brown was producing a few projects at <a href="/wiki/TriStar_Pictures" id="w">TriStar Pictures</a> and tried to interest them in making <i>A Few Good Men</i> into a film but his proposal was declined due to the lack of star actor involvement.  Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at <a href="/wiki/Castle_Rock_Entertainment" id="w">Castle Rock Entertainment</a> who was anxious to make the film.  <a href="/wiki/Rob_Reiner" id="w">Rob Reiner</a>, a producing partner at Castle Rock, opted to direct it.<sup id="_ref-MovieMoguls_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MovieMoguls" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Working_under_contract_for_Castle_Rock_Entertainment" name="Working_under_contract_for_Castle_Rock_Entertainment"></a><h2>Working under contract for Castle Rock Entertainment</h2>
<p>Sorkin worked under contract for some years at <a href="/wiki/Castle_Rock_Entertainment" id="w">Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc.</a> and had an office at their headquarters near <a href="/wiki/Santa_Monica_Boulevard" id="w">Santa Monica Boulevard</a> in <a href="/wiki/Beverly_Hills%2C_California" id="w">Beverly Hills, California</a>.  These were formative years in which he wrote the scripts for <i>A Few Good Men</i>, <i>Malice</i>, and <i>The American President</i>.  While writing for Castle Rock, between 1991 and 1995, he made friends with colleagues such as <a href="/wiki/William_Goldman" id="w">William Goldman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rob_Reiner" id="w">Rob Reiner</a> and met his future wife, Julia Bingham, who was an in-house entertainment lawyer.</p>
<p>The screenplay for <i><a href="/wiki/A_Few_Good_Men" id="w">A Few Good Men</a></i> was still in an unsatisfactory early draft when he started working under contract at Castle Rock.  Sorkin had purchased a book about <a href="/wiki/Screenwriting#Example of proper formatting" id="w">screenplay format</a> and was learning the craft.<sup id="_ref-Weiss-seminar_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weiss-seminar" title="">[12]</a></sup>  William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him adapt his stageplay into a <a href="/wiki/Screenplay" id="w">screenplay</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the meantime, William Goldman approached Sorkin with a premise, which would later become the screenplay for <i><a href="/wiki/Malice_(film)" id="w">Malice</a></i>. Goldman oversaw the project as <a href="/wiki/Creative_consultant" id="w">creative consultant</a> while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts of <i>Malice</i>.  Subsequently, Sorkin left the project to finish up the screenplay for <i>A Few Good Men</i>.<sup id="_ref-Malice-goldman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Malice-goldman" title="">[19]</a></sup>  Rob Reiner directed <i>A Few Good Men</i>, which starred Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, and Kevin Bacon, and was produced by David Brown.  The film was a box office success.</p>
<p>In Sorkin&#39;s absence, screenwriter <a href="/wiki/Scott_Frank" id="w">Scott Frank</a> was hired to write two drafts of the <i>Malice</i> screenplay.  Sorkin returned after delivering on his commitments to <i>A Few Good Men</i> and wrote the final <a href="/wiki/Shooting_script" id="w">shooting script</a> for <i>Malice</i>.<sup id="_ref-Malice-goldman_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Malice-goldman" title="">[19]</a></sup>  Harold Becker directed <i>Malice</i>, a medical thriller, with actors Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin playing lead roles.</p>
<p>Sorkin&#39;s last produced screenplay for Castle Rock was <i><a href="/wiki/The_American_President_(film)" id="w">The American President</a></i> and once again he worked with William Goldman, who contributed as a consultant, and Rob Reiner, who served as director and one of the producers.<sup id="_ref-TheAge-Forrest_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TheAge-Forrest" title="">[8]</a></sup>  It took Sorkin a few years to write the screenplay, due to an increasing consumption of <a href="/wiki/Cocaine#Freebase" id="w">freebase cocaine</a>, which he started using in New York.  He eventually turned in a massive 385-page screenplay for <i>The American President</i>, which ultimately was whittled down to a standard shooting script of around 120 pages.<sup id="_ref-SeattlePI_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SeattlePI" title="">[20]</a></sup>  The film was made and shown in North American movie theaters in late 1995.</p>
<p>Worldwide, the three films grossed about $400 million for Castle Rock.<sup id="_ref-SeattlePI_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SeattlePI" title="">[20]</a></sup>  By this time, Sorkin had developed a full-fledged addiction to freebase cocaine and was advised by his then-girlfriend Julia Bingham to enter rehab.  Rob Reiner had spoken to Bingham about his own concerns for Sorkin.  In late 1995 Sorkin entered rehab at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota.  Five months later, on <a href="/wiki/April_13" id="w">April 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a>, Sorkin married Bingham;<sup id="_ref-USWeekly-Jones_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USWeekly-Jones" title="">[5]</a></sup> they divorced in <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>.</p>

Sorkin came up with the idea to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the screenplay for <i>The American President</i>.

Sorkin is best known for his <a href="/wiki/Political" id="w">political</a> TV drama, <i>The West Wing</i>, starring <a href="/wiki/Martin_Sheen" id="w">Martin Sheen</a> as the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President of the United States</a>.  Sorkin initially got <i><a href="/wiki/The_West_Wing_(TV_series)" id="w">The West Wing</a></i> going with leftover dialogue from his bloated 385-page screenplay for <i>The American President</i>.  The opportunity to do the TV series presented itself in 1997 when Sorkin, at the urging of his agent, got together with producer <a href="/wiki/John_Wells_(TV_producer)" id="w">John Wells</a> for lunch at the Pinot Bistro, a French restaurant on <a href="/wiki/Ventura_Boulevard" id="w">Ventura Boulevard</a>.<sup id="_ref-SeattlePI_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SeattlePI" title="">[20]</a></sup>  Sorkin came unprepared and, in a panic, pitched the idea of doing a show about the senior staff of the White House.

<p><i>The West Wing</i> was honored with 9 <a href="/wiki/Emmy_Award" id="w">Emmy Awards</a> for its debut season, making the show a record holder for most Emmys won by a series in a single season.  The Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series was awarded to each of the first four <i>West Wing</i> seasons.

<p>In early 1998, Aaron Sorkin began a collaboration with <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Schlamme" id="w">Thomas Schlamme</a> when they found they shared common creative ground on the soon to be produced <i>Sports Night</i>.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CC-interview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CC-interview" title="">[26]</a></sup>  Their successful partnership has endured for nearly a decade so far with Aaron Sorkin writing the scripts and Thomas Schlamme <a href="/wiki/Executive_producer#Television" id="w">exec producing</a> and occasionally <a href="/wiki/Television_director" id="w">directing</a>.  They have developed a reputation for producing quality stories with mainstream appeal in a variety of media though they have only worked together in Television.<sup id="_ref-NewLine-press_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NewLine-press" title="">[45]</a></sup>  They each contribute an equal amount of effort to the projects they&#39;ve collaborated on: <i>Sports Night</i>, <i>The West Wing</i>, and <i>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</i>.  Schlamme creates the look of the shows, works with the other directors who come in when he is not directing, discusses the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, makes design and <a href="/wiki/Casting_(performing_arts)" id="w">casting decisions</a>, and attends the <a href="/wiki/Film_budgeting" id="w">budget meetings</a>.  Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing the scripts of which he writes almost all of them in their entirety with other writers frequently appearing in the &#34;Story by&#34; credit and occasionally the &#34;Written by&#34; credit.<sup id="_ref-CC-interview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CC-interview" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

<p>One of Schlamme&#39;s trademarks is <i>The West Wing</i>&#39;s style of continuously tracking in front of characters as they walk side by side while talking at the same time, usually while on their way to a meeting or conference directly related to the substance of the discussion, a visual technique called the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Walk_and_talk" id="w">Walk and Talk</a>&#34;.  Schlamme did not want to have scene cuts that relocated characters without any explanation of how they got there so he developed the &#34;Walk and Talk&#34; device to work with Sorkin&#39;s dialogue.<sup id="_ref-HR-westwingfinale_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HR-westwingfinale" title="">[37]</a></sup>  Fans at <a href="/wiki/Television_Without_Pity" id="w">Television Without Pity</a> have coined the term &#34;pedeconference&#34; to describe the &#34;Walk and Talk&#34; and the term&#39;s usage has widened to describe other TV shows.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2004, it was announced that Thomas Schlamme would direct Sorkin&#39;s script <i>The Farnsworth Invention</i> for <a href="/wiki/New_Line_Cinema" id="w">New Line Cinema</a>.<sup id="_ref-NewLine-press_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NewLine-press" title="">[45]</a></sup>  Schlamme was set to produce the project through his company Shoe Money Productions located on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank but the film production was eventually canceled.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup>  The Sorkin-Schlamme collaboration continued on the NBC TV series <i><a href="/wiki/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip" id="w">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a></i> which was produced by Shoe Money Productions.</p>
