<b>Hurricane Bob</b> was a minimal <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">hurricane</a> that affected the <a href="/wiki/Southeastern_United_States" id="w">southeast United States</a> in July, 1985. The second tropical storm and first hurricane of the <a href="/wiki/1985_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1985 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Bob developed from a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_21" id="w">July 21</a> in the eastern <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a>. Afterwards, Bob began moving eastward, finally striking southwestern <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> as a minimal tropical storm. Bob then turned to the north, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status on <a href="/wiki/July_24" id="w">July 24</a>. The next day, it made landfall near <a href="/wiki/Beaufort%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Beaufort, South Carolina</a>, becoming one of a record-tying six hurricanes to hit the United States in a hurricane season, something that had not happened since <a href="/wiki/1916_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1916</a>.<sup id="_ref-hurdat_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hurdat" title="">[1]</a></sup> Bob quickly weakened over land, and was absorbed by a frontal <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a> over eastern <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia" id="w">West Virginia</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_26" id="w">July 26</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout its path, Bob caused $20&#160;million in damage (1985 <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">USD</a>, $37.6&#160;million 2006 USD) and five indirect deaths from traffic fatalities. In Florida, the storm produced heavy rainfall, including over 20&#160;inches (500&#160;mm) in <a href="/wiki/Everglades_City%2C_Florida" id="w">Everglades City</a>. Along most of its path, the rainfall was beneficial due to lower than normal rainfall throughout the year. Damage was minimal in South Carolina where the hurricane made landfall. In Virginia, the storm spawned three <a href="/wiki/Tornado" id="w">tornadoes</a>, one of which destroyed two houses.</p>

The remnants of a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> entered the southeastern <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_20" id="w">July 20</a>. An <a href="/wiki/Low_pressure_area" id="w">area of low pressure</a> formed, and following the formation of a low-level circulation, it developed into a tropical depression on <a href="/wiki/July_21" id="w">July 21</a>, while located 200&#160;miles (320&#160;km) west-northwest of <a href="/wiki/Naples%2C_Florida" id="w">Naples, Florida</a>. Under weak steering currents, the tropical depression drifted to the southeast, then turned to the northeast, and later to the east. Based on reports from <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Hunters" id="w">Hurricane Hunters</a>, it is estimated the system intensified into Tropical Storm <i><a href="/wiki/Bob" id="w">Bob</a></i> late on <a href="/wiki/July_22" id="w">July 22</a>, while located 125&#160;miles (200&#160;km) west-northwest of Naples. Bob failed to organize significantly while tracking eastward through the Gulf of Mexico, and made landfall between Naples and <a href="/wiki/Fort_Myers%2C_Florida" id="w">Fort Myers, Florida</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_23" id="w">July 23</a> as a 45&#160;mph (70&#160;km/h) tropical storm, with most of the convection located to the south and east of the center.<sup id="_ref-tcr1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>While moving across Florida, Bob turned to the northeast, then to the north; subsequently, it left the peninsula, moving into the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> early on <a href="/wiki/July_24" id="w">July 24</a> near <a href="/wiki/Vero_Beach%2C_Florida" id="w">Vero Beach</a>. As it moved over the warm waters of the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Stream" id="w">Gulf Stream</a>, it quickly strengthened and organized, and Bob intensified into a <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 1 hurricane</a> late on the 24th, while located 70&#160;miles (115&#160;km) east of <a href="/wiki/Jacksonville%2C_Florida" id="w">Jacksonville, Florida</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Because it was embedded within the western extension of the <a href="/wiki/Subtropical_ridge" id="w">subtropical ridge</a>, Bob retained higher than normal pressures throughout its lifespan, and its minimum central pressure was 1002&#160;<a href="/wiki/Bar_(unit)" id="w">mbar</a> (29.59&#160;<a href="/wiki/InHg" id="w">inHg</a>).<sup id="_ref-mwr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mwr" title="">[3]</a></sup> The hurricane continued northward, and made landfall near <a href="/wiki/Beaufort%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Beaufort, South Carolina</a> early on <a href="/wiki/July_25" id="w">July 25</a>, carrying winds of 75&#160;mph (120&#160;km/h). Bob quickly weakened over land, decaying into a tropical storm three hours after landfall, and degenerating into a tropical depression after the passage of another 12&#160;hours, near the <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a>/<a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a> border. It turned to the north-northeast, and was absorbed by a frontal <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a> over eastern <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia" id="w">West Virginia</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_26" id="w">July 26</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Its area of disturbed weather remained separate from the trough, and continued northeastward through the <a href="/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_States" id="w">Mid-Atlantic</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_England" id="w">New England</a> while moving around a <a href="/wiki/Ridge_(meteorology)" id="w">ridge</a> to its southeast.<sup id="_ref-rain_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rain" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Preparations" name="Preparations"></a><h2>Preparations</h2>
<p>When Bob became a tropical storm, the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> issued gale warnings for the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Keys" id="w">Florida Keys</a> west of <a href="/wiki/Craig_Key" id="w">Craig Key</a>, and also from <a href="/wiki/Flamingo%2C_Florida" id="w">Flamingo</a> to <a href="/wiki/Venice%2C_Florida" id="w">Venice</a>. Gale warnings were later issued for the Atlantic coast of Florida northward through <a href="/wiki/St._Augustine%2C_Florida" id="w">St. Augustine</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Small craft were advised to remain at port south of St. Augustine.<sup id="_ref-flstuff_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-flstuff" title="">[6]</a></sup> While located off the east-central coast of Florida, the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> issued a gale warning and a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">hurricane watch</a> from <a href="/wiki/Savannah%2C_Georgia" id="w">Savannah, Georgia</a> to <a href="/wiki/Little_River%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Little River, South Carolina</a>. After Bob intensified into a hurricane, the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning.<sup id="_ref-tcr1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr1" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Thousands of people evacuated coastal areas of South Carolina, many of which stayed at inland hotels. 850&#160;people stayed at shelters, including 500 at an elementary school in <a href="/wiki/Horry_County%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Horry County</a> and 240 in a shelter in the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Strand" id="w">Grand Strand</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Beaufort_County%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Beaufort County</a>, where the storm came ashore, officials closed city and county offices early, and advised businesses to send their workers home early on the day of Bob&#39;s landfall. Officials in <a href="/wiki/Chatham_County%2C_Georgia" id="w">Chatham County, Georgia</a> evacuated nursing homes on <a href="/wiki/Tybee_Island%2C_Georgia" id="w">Tybee Island</a>, and recommended others to leave, due to high <a href="/wiki/Tide" id="w">tides</a> potentially isolating the island by cutting off <a href="/wiki/U.S._Highway_80" id="w">U.S. Highway 80</a>.
