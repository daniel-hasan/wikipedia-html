SBS Transit Service 225 is a feeder bus service operated by SBS Transit. It operates in two directions, a Green Plate, which goes from Bedok Bus Interchange to Bedok North Street 3 and loops back to Bedok Bus Interchange via Bedok North Avenue 2. The other, a white plate, also goes from Bedok Bus Interchange to Bedok North Street 3 and loops back via Bedok North Avenue 1. The difference is that Service 225 Green (Thus dubbed as 225G) goes in the east while service 225 White (Thus dubbed as 225W) goes in the west direction, so residents living in areas in Bedok have a more convienent choice. Passengers normally board this bus at Bedok Bus InterchangeBerth B4, which also serves for Service 35 travelling to Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal.

History
The then SBS introduced a service 225 in the mid-1970s to link the residents of Bedok North to the major city centre of Bedok from Bedok Bus Interchange. It started out by using non aircon buses. Since then, it has been a popular service, with the white plate having a higher ridership than the green plate.

When SBS converted the non aircon Scania N113CRB buses in year 2000, its status changed from non-aircon to partially aircon service. In its rebranding of the name from SBS to SBS Transit, the buses were painted with the new SBS Transit livery. The process only began in early 2005 for the 225 fleet and ended on early November in 2006. The first bus was believed to be SBS 3721J and the last bus in the 225 fleet to be painted in its new livery was SBS 3687A.

Even though there was a change in Berth in 2005, from its original B4 to B6, thus exchanging with service 17, 38 and Express 506, it moved back to its original berth soon after. Since then, it stands to be one of the longest serving service, with no route changes since the mid-1970s.

Permanent buses on Service 225
Nine buses were deployed on the service. This service has the majority of Scania N113CRB buses, and only one is a Volvo B10M Mark III. The bus, SBS 0857X, is a permanent on Service CT18 and only does a crossover during early morning or during the evening.

The permanent buses on 225 include:

White Plate: SBS 3683K, SBS 3684H, SBS 3685E and SBS 3721J

Green Plate: SBS 0857X (X-Over from CT18), SBS 3687A, SBS 3688Y, SBS 3692J and SBS 3701S

Since this service is a partial aircon service because of the inheritance from its fully non-aircon service previously, there are chances where SBS Transit takes Non Airconditioned buses to be used on this service. Also, SBS Transit takes some Volvo B10M Mark III's to replace the existing fleet. Sometimes, rarer Mark IV buses are also seen on the fleet.
