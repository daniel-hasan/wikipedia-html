The <b>Talbot Tagora</b> was an <a href="/wiki/Executive_car" id="w">executive car</a> developed by <a href="/wiki/Chrysler_Europe" id="w">Chrysler Europe</a> and produced by <a href="/wiki/PSA_Peugeot_Citro%C3%ABn" id="w">Peugeot Société Anonyme</a> (PSA). The Tagora was marketed under the <a href="/wiki/Talbot" id="w">Talbot</a> <a href="/wiki/Marque" id="w">marque</a> after PSA took over <a href="/wiki/Chrysler" id="w">Chrysler</a>&#39;s European operations in 1979. PSA presented the first production vehicle in 1980 and launched it commercially in 1981. The Tagora fell far short of sales expectations, and PSA cancelled the model only two years later. Fewer than 20,000 Tagoras were ever built, all of them at the former <a href="/wiki/Simca" id="w">Simca</a> factory in the <a href="/wiki/Poissy" id="w">Poissy</a> <a href="/wiki/Commune_in_France" id="w">commune</a> near <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>.</p>
<a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h1> Development </h1>
<p>Chrysler Europe began the development of the Tagora in 1976, under the <a href="/wiki/Code_name" id="w">code name</a> <i>C9</i>, with the goal of replacing the unsuccessful <a href="/wiki/Chrysler_180" id="w">Chrysler 180</a> series. Following the same development pattern as with the <a href="/wiki/Chrysler_Horizon" id="w">Horizon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Simca_1307" id="w">Alpine</a> models, the responsibility for the Tagora&#39;s technical development remained in France, while the styling was devised at Chrysler&#39;s design centre in the United Kingdom.<sup id="_ref-rootes-development_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-development" title="">[1]</a></sup> An early proposal for the name of the car was &#34;Simca 2000&#34;.<sup id="_ref-club_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-club" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Design" name="Design"></a><h2> Design </h2>
<p>The original <i>C9</i> prototype was a modern-styled <a href="/wiki/Sedan" id="w">saloon</a> with a low beltline, ample glazing and a generous interior made possible by the rather large <a href="/wiki/Wheelbase" id="w">wheelbase</a>. The <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> design team initially proposed some stylistic features inspired by the <a href="/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn_SM" id="w">Citroën SM</a>, including a front glass panel between the headlights to accommodate the <a href="/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plate" id="w">license plate</a>, round front wheelarches and rear <a href="/wiki/Fender_skirts" id="w">fender skirts</a>. However, Chrysler management in the United States deemed these features too extravagant, so the design of the <i>C9</i> became more conventional: front and rear wheelarches were squared off and the skirts lost, and the license plate was placed on the front bumper as on most cars. To better balance the rather tall silhouette, the beltline was raised. Over the course of development, the <i>C9</i> also lost its vertical taillights in favour of more &#34;fashionable&#34; horizontal ones.<sup id="_ref-rootes-development_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-development" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-rootes-prototype_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-prototype" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Engine_dilemma" name="Engine_dilemma"></a><h2> Engine dilemma </h2>
<p>The main competitors in the executive vehicle market offered engines bigger than the biggest two-litre <a href="/wiki/Straight-4" id="w">straight-4</a> used by Chrysler Europe, and a six-<a href="/wiki/Cylinder_(engine)" id="w">cylinder</a> engine was generally expected. Consequently, the company had to seek a new engine for the Tagora. One candidate was the <a href="/wiki/Mitsubishi_Motors" id="w">Mitsubishi</a> <a href="/wiki/Straight-6" id="w">straight-6</a>, but it proved unsuitable for a car of this class. The other proposal was the <a href="/wiki/PRV_engine" id="w">Douvrin V6 engine</a> (the &#34;PRV&#34;), a joint development of PSA, <a href="/wiki/Renault" id="w">Renault</a> and <a href="/wiki/Volvo_Cars" id="w">Volvo</a>. Since the Tagora would be in direct competition with PSA models that used the PRV, it seemed unlikely that Chrysler would be able to procure that engine.<sup id="_ref-rootes-development_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-development" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Sales_projections" name="Sales_projections"></a><h2> Sales projections </h2>
<p>Chrysler Corporation approved the development of the model on the assumption that Chrysler Europe would sell 60,000 <i>C9</i>s per year, which translated into a projected 5 percent share of the executive car market. This estimate seemed achievable because Chrysler had a 7 percent market share in Europe overall. The projected sales would have covered the car&#39;s tooling costs, with the development costs accounted for separately, as part of an independent annual budget.<sup id="_ref-rootes-development_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-development" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="PSA_takeover" name="PSA_takeover"></a><h2> PSA takeover </h2>
<p>During the development of the <i>C9</i>, the management of the <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy" id="w">bankruptcy</a>-threatened Chrysler Corporation decided to divest itself of its debt-ridden European operations. The buyer was the French <a href="/wiki/PSA_Peugeot_Citro%C3%ABn" id="w">PSA Group</a>, formed in 1976 after <a href="/wiki/Peugeot" id="w">Peugeot</a> took over <a href="/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn" id="w">Citroën</a>. The deal was finalized in 1978, with the buyer paying a mere $1 for the entirety of Chrysler Europe and its <a href="/wiki/Liability" id="w">obligations</a>. The take-over was effective as of <a href="/wiki/1_January" id="w">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1979" id="w">1979</a>.<sup id="_ref-rootes-PSA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-PSA" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the <i>C9</i> project was well advanced, PSA already had a rather crowded lineup in the large vehicle segment, including the legendary <a href="/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn_CX" id="w">Citroën CX</a>, the slow-selling <a href="/wiki/Peugeot_604" id="w">Peugeot 604</a> and the newly-launched <a href="/wiki/Peugeot_505" id="w">Peugeot 505</a>. Nevertheless, PSA decided to move forward with the <i>C9</i> project, making a few significant changes that enabled the use of their own parts. The Simca <a href="/wiki/Double_wishbone_suspension" id="w">double wishbone</a> front suspension gave way to <a href="/wiki/MacPherson_strut" id="w">MacPherson struts</a> adopted from the Peugeot 505 and 604, and the rear <a href="/wiki/Axle" id="w">axle</a> was replaced with that of the 505, much narrower than the one originally planned, as it was designed with respect to the 505 body width. The <i>C9</i> front end was extended to accommodate the optional PRV engine: now that the model belonged to PSA, using the PRV presented no problems.<sup id="_ref-rootes-development_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-development" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-club_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-club" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

Following the renaming of Chrysler Europe&#39;s models to the <a href="/wiki/Talbot" id="w">Talbot</a> marque, the <i>C9</i> was christened the Talbot Tagora, and the first batch of cars rolled out of the former Simca plant in Poissy in 1980. The same year, PSA presented the Tagora at the <a href="/wiki/Mondial_de_l%26%2339%3BAutomobile" id="w">Salon de l&#39;Automobile</a> in Paris. Following a hands-on demonstration of the model to the press in <a href="/wiki/Morocco" id="w">Morocco</a> in March 1981, the car went on sale in France in April and in the United Kingdom in May.<sup id="_ref-rootes-development_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-development" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-rootes-gallery_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-gallery" title="">[5]</a></sup> The British <a href="/wiki/Billboard_advertising" id="w">billboard advertising</a> campaign boasted <i>&#34;The new Talbot Tagora. Luxury and performance redefined.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-club_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-club" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Tagora was priced to overlap with high-end Peugeot 505s and low-end Citroën CXs, while slotting in beneath the Peugeot 604. Its pricing was also comparable to the <a href="/wiki/Renault_20/30" id="w">Renault 20/30</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ford_Granada" id="w">Ford Granada</a>. (The Tagora was in the 20,000–30,000 <a href="/wiki/German_mark" id="w">Deutschmark</a> bracket in <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>.)<sup id="_ref-Auto Katalog2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Auto Katalog2" title="">[6]</a></sup> The initial production run in 1981 (combined with some <a href="/wiki/Pre-production_car" id="w">pre-production</a> runs from 1980) was only one quarter of Chrysler&#39;s initial projections. Sales proved insufficient even for this production level, and production continued to sharply decline throughout 1982 and 1983, prompting PSA to cancel the model altogether. By the time the Tagora met its fate, only about 20,000 had been built; by comparison, over 116,000 Peugeot 505s and 74,000 Citroën CXs were made in 1981 alone.<sup id="_ref-Auto Katalog3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Auto Katalog3" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-rootes-development_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-development" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-club_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-club" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Powertrains_and_versions" name="Powertrains_and_versions"></a><h1> Powertrains and versions </h1>
<p>As with most large cars of its time, the Tagora was a <a href="/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive" id="w">rear-wheel drive</a> vehicle, with a longitudinally-mounted engine. There were three engine choices, mated to four- and five-speed <a href="/wiki/Manual_transmission" id="w">manual transmissions</a> or an optional three-speed <a href="/wiki/Automatic_transmission" id="w">automatic</a> in the case of the four-cylinder engines.<sup id="_ref-Auto Katalog_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Auto Katalog" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-brochure_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brochure" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>In terms of engineering, the Tagora had no major flaws (except perhaps for the poor cabin ventilation). The <a href="/wiki/1979_energy_crisis" id="w">1979 energy crisis</a>, however, dealt a blow to the European automotive market: the large car segment contracted significantly, making Chrysler&#39;s initial sales projections unrealistic. The Tagora was ultimately launched under the Talbot brand, which was relatively unestablished in the marketplace and had a questionable pedigree, which was an unfavorable trait in the executive car market ruled by established names like the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Granada" id="w">Ford Granada</a>.<sup id="_ref-rootes-development_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-development" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-club_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-club" title="">[2]</a></sup>

<p>As the British automobile magazine <i><a href="/wiki/What_Car%3F" id="w">What Car?</a></i> opined, the Tagora &#34;has such a complete blandness of style as to disqualify it instantly in a market where character and status count for so much.&#34;<sup id="_ref-rootes-development_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-development" title="">[1]</a></sup> The design of the Tagora was focused on practicality, providing exceptional cabin space at the expense of style. The loss of some of the original design elements at the hands of Chrysler left the Tagora rather featureless. The steep windshield formed a quite strange angle with the relatively short, wedge-shaped <a href="/wiki/Hood_(vehicle)" id="w">bonnet</a>. The car was wider and taller than most of its competitors, and buyers were unaccustomed to such proportions. The PSA-sourced axles had very narrow tracks relative to the width of the body, which provided an awkward look, especially at the rear. Nor did the plain, plastic <a href="/wiki/Dashboard" id="w">dashboard</a> stir enthusiasm among reviewers and prospective customers.<sup id="_ref-rootes-development_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rootes-development" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-club_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-club" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
