<p><b>Witold Lutosławski</b> ({{IPA2}}; <a href="/wiki/January_25" id="w">January 25</a> <a href="/wiki/1913" id="w">1913</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/February_7" id="w">February 7</a> <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>) was one of the major <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> <a href="/wiki/Composer" id="w">composers</a> of the 20th century, and one of the pre-eminent <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Polish</a> musicians during his last three decades. During his lifetime, Lutosławski earned many international awards and prizes, including the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_White_Eagle" id="w">Order of the White Eagle</a>, Poland&#39;s highest honour.</p>
<p>During his youth, Lutosławski studied piano and composition in <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" id="w">Warsaw</a>. His early works were influenced by Polish <a href="/wiki/Folk_music" id="w">folk music</a>. His style demonstrates a wide range of rich atmospheric <a href="/wiki/Texture_(music)" id="w">textures</a>. He began to develop his own characteristic composition techniques in the late 1950s.  His music from this period onwards incorporates his own methods of building <a href="/wiki/Harmony" id="w">harmonies</a> from small groups of <a href="/wiki/Interval_(music)" id="w">musical intervals</a>.  It also uses <a href="/wiki/Aleatoric_music" id="w">aleatory</a> processes, in which the rhythmic coordination of parts is subject to an element of chance.  His compositions (of which he was a notable <a href="/wiki/Conducting" id="w">conductor</a>) include four <a href="/wiki/Symphony" id="w">symphonies</a>, a <i><a href="/wiki/Concerto_for_Orchestra_(Lutos%C5%82awski)" id="w">Concerto for Orchestra</a></i>, and several instrumental <a href="/wiki/Concerto" id="w">concertos</a> and orchestral <a href="/wiki/Song_cycle" id="w">song cycles</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stalinism" id="w">Stalinist</a> authorities banned Lutosławski&#39;s compositions for being &#34;<a href="/wiki/Formalism_(music)" id="w">formalist</a>&#34;&#8212;and thus accessible only to a perceived elite&#8212;but he always opposed the demands of <a href="/wiki/Socialist_realism" id="w">Socialist realism</a>. In the 1980s, Lutosławski used his international stature to support the <a href="/wiki/Solidarity" id="w">Solidarity</a> movement, which won the 1989 legislative election and broke the Soviet hold over Poland.</p>

<a id="Postwar_years" name="Postwar_years"></a><h3> Postwar years </h3>

<p>During the postwar years, Lutosławski worked on his first symphony&#8212;sketches of which he had salvaged from Warsaw&#8212;which he had started in 1941<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> and which was first performed in 1948, conducted by Fitelberg.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> To provide for his family, he also composed music that he termed <i>functional</i>, such as the <i>Warsaw Suite</i> (written to accompany a silent film depicting the city&#39;s reconstruction<sup id="_ref-Rae20_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rae20" title="">[22]</a></sup>), sets of <i>Polish Carols</i>, and the study pieces for piano, <i>Melodie Ludowe</i> (&#34;Folk Melodies&#34;).<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1945, Lutosławski was elected as secretary and treasurer of the newly constituted <a href="/wiki/Union_of_Polish_Composers" id="w">Union of Polish Composers</a> (ZKP&#8212;<i>Związek Kompozytorów Polskich</i>).<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> In 1946, he married Danuta Bogusławska.<sup id="_ref-Rae20_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rae20" title="">[22]</a></sup> The marriage was a lasting one, and Maria&#39;s drafting skills were of great value to the composer: she became his copyist,<sup id="_ref-Rae20_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rae20" title="">[22]</a></sup> and she solved some of the notational challenges of his later works.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1947, the <a href="/wiki/Stalinism" id="w">Stalinist</a> political climate led to the adoption and imposition by the ruling <a href="/wiki/Polish_United_Workers%26%2339%3B_Party" id="w">Polish United Workers&#39; Party</a> of the tenets of <a href="/wiki/Socialist_realism" id="w">Socialist realism</a>, and the authorities&#39; condemnation of modern music which was deemed to be non-conformist. This artistic censorship, which ultimately came from <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" id="w">Stalin</a> personally, was to some degree prevalent over the whole <a href="/wiki/Eastern_bloc" id="w">Eastern bloc</a>, and was reinforced by the 1948 <a href="/wiki/Zhdanov_Doctrine" id="w">Zhdanov decree</a>.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> By 1948, the ZKP was taken over by musicians willing to follow the party line on musical matters, and Lutosławski was dropped from the committee.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> He was implacably opposed to the ideas of Socialist realism.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> His <i>First Symphony</i> was proscribed as &#34;formalist&#34;,<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> and he found himself shunned by the Soviet authorities, a situation that continued throughout the era of <a href="/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev" id="w">Khrushchev</a>, <a href="/wiki/Leonid_Brezhnev" id="w">Brezhnev</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yuri_Andropov" id="w">Andropov</a> and <a href="/wiki/Konstantin_Chernenko" id="w">Chernenko</a>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> In 1954, the climate of musical oppression drove his friend Andrzej Panufnik to <a href="/wiki/Defector" id="w">defect</a> to the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>. Against this background, he was happy to compose pieces for which there was social need,<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> but in 1954 this earned Lutosławski&#8212;much to the composer&#39;s chagrin&#8212;the Prime Minister&#39;s Prize, for a set of children&#39;s songs.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> As he commented, &#34;[&#8230;] it was for those functional compositions of mine that the authorities decorated me [&#8230;] I realised that I was not writing indifferent little pieces, only to make a living, but was carrying on an artistic creative activity in the eyes of the outside world.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was his substantial and original <i>Concerto for Orchestra</i> of 1954 that established Lutosławski as an important composer of art music.  The work, commissioned in 1950 by the conductor <a href="/wiki/Witold_Rowicki" id="w">Witold Rowicki</a> for the newly reconstituted Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, earned the composer two state prizes in the following year.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <i>Second Symphony</i>, and <i>Livre pour orchestre</i> and the <i>Cello Concerto</i> which followed, were composed during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski’s life. His mother died in 1967,<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> and the period 1967&#8211;70 saw a great deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production <i><a href="/wiki/Dziady_(poem)" id="w">Dziady</a></i>, which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovakia" id="w">Czechoslovakia</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Prague_Spring" id="w">Prague Spring</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk_Shipyard" id="w">Gdańsk Shipyards</a> strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the <i>Cello Concerto</i> of 1968&#8211;70<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> for <a href="/wiki/Rostropovich" id="w">Rostropovich</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Philharmonic_Society" id="w">Royal Philharmonic Society</a>. Indeed, Rostropovich&#39;s own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident <a href="/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn" id="w">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a>).<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a direct effect on his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> In any case, the <i>Cello Concerto</i> was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades.

These latter pieces were proving difficult to complete<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> as Lutosławski struggled to introduce greater fluency into his sound world and to reconcile tensions between the harmonic and melodic aspects of his style,<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> and between foreground and background.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> The <i>Double Concerto</i> for oboe, harp and chamber orchestra—commissioned by Paul Sacher—was finally finished in 1980,<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> and the <a href="/wiki/Symphony_No._3_(Lutos%C5%82awski)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Third Symphony&#39;&#39;</a> in 1983.</p>

<p>Through the mid-1980s, Lutosławski composed three pieces called <i>Łańcuch</i> (&#34;Chain&#34;), which refers to the way the music is constructed from contrasting strands which overlap like the links of a chain.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> <i>Chain 2</i> was written for <a href="/wiki/Anne-Sophie_Mutter" id="w">Anne-Sophie Mutter</a> (commissioned by Paul Sacher), and for Mutter he also orchestrated his slightly earlier <i>Partita</i> for violin and piano, providing a new linking Interlude,<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> so that when played together the Partita, Interlude and <i>Chain 2</i> form his longest work.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>

The intention of the award is to remove recipients&#39; financial concerns for a period to allow them to concentrate on serious composition. In a gesture of <a href="/wiki/Altruism" id="w">altruism</a>, Lutosławski announced that he would use the fund to set up a scholarship to enable young Polish composers to study abroad; Lutosławski also directed that his fee from the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Symphony_Orchestra" id="w">San Francisco Symphony Orchestra</a> for <i>Chain 3</i> should go to this scholarship fund.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Folk_influence" name="Folk_influence"></a><h3> Folk influence </h3>

<p>Lutosławski&#39;s works up until and including the <i>Dance Preludes</i> clearly show the influence of Polish <a href="/wiki/Folk_music" id="w">folk music</a>, both harmonically and melodically. Part of his art was in transforming folk music, rather than quoting it exactly. In some cases, folk music is unrecognisable as such without careful analysis, for example, in the <i>Concerto for Orchestra</i>.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> As Lutosławski developed the techniques of his mature compositions, he stopped using folk material explicitly, although its influence remained as subtle features until the end. As he said, &#34;[in those days] I could not compose as I wished, so I composed as I was able&#34;,<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup> and about this change of direction he said, &#34;I was simply not so interested in it [using folk music]&#34;.  Also, Lutosławski was dissatisfied with composing in a &#34;post-tonal&#34; idiom: while composing the first symphony, he felt that this was for him a <i>cul-de-sac</i>.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Pitch_organisation" name="Pitch_organisation"></a><h3> Pitch organisation </h3>

<p>In <i>Five Songs</i> (1956-57) and <i>Muzyka żałobna</i> (1958) Lutosławski introduced his own brand of <a href="/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique" id="w">twelve-tone music</a>, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup> His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in <i>Muzyka żałobna</i>, <a href="/wiki/Augmented_fourth" id="w">augmented fourths</a> and <a href="/wiki/Semitone" id="w">semitones</a>). This system also gave him the means to write dense <a href="/wiki/Chord_(music)" id="w">chords</a> without resorting to <a href="/wiki/Tone_cluster" id="w">tone clusters</a>, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup> Lutosławski&#39;s twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from <a href="/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg" id="w">Arnold Schoenberg</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Tone-row" id="w">tone-row</a> system,<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup> although <i>Muzyka żałobna</i> does happen to be based on a tone row. <sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup>  This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and <i>Paganini Variations</i>.<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Aleatory_technique" name="Aleatory_technique"></a><h3> Aleatory technique </h3>
<p>Although <i>Muzyka żałobna</i> was internationally acclaimed, his new harmonic techniques led to something of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup> Then he happened to hear some music by <a href="/wiki/John_Cage" id="w">John Cage</a> (his <i>Concert for Piano and Orchestra</i>). Although he was not influenced by the sound or the philosophy of Cage&#39;s music, Cage&#39;s explorations of <a href="/wiki/Aleatory_music" id="w">aleatory music</a> set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching.<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup> His <i>Three Postludes</i> were hastily rounded off<sup id="_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[96]</a></sup> (he originally intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.</p>
<p>In works from <i>Jeux vénitiens</i>, Lutosławski wrote long passages in which the parts of the ensemble are not to be <a href="/wiki/Synchronization" id="w">synchronised</a> exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random element implied by the term <i>aleatory</i> is carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski <a href="/wiki/Musical_notation" id="w">notated</a> the music exactly, there is no <a href="/wiki/Improvisation" id="w">improvisation</a>, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.<sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[97]</a></sup></p>
<p>For his <i>String</i> Quartet (1964), Lutosławski originally produced only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind them in a full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, as is the case with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance.<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup>  His wife Danuta solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called <i>mobiles</i>), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile.<sup id="_ref-Stucky87_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stucky87" title="">[48]</a></sup> In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the <a href="/wiki/Conducting" id="w">conductor</a>.</p>
<p>Lutosławski&#39;s called this technique of his mature period &#34;limited aleatorism&#34;.<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup>  This controlled freedom given to the individual musicians is contrasted with passages where the orchestra is asked to synchronise their parts; the score for these passages is notated conventionally using <a href="/wiki/Bar_(music)" id="w">bars (measures)</a> and <a href="/wiki/Time_signature" id="w">time signatures</a>.</p>
<p>{{Wide image}}</p>
<p>Both Lutosławski&#39;s harmonic and aleatory processes are illustrated by <i>example 1</i>, an excerpt from <i>Hésitant</i>, the first movement of the Symphony No. 2.  At number 7, the conductor gives a cue to the flutes, celesta and percussionist, who then play their parts in their own time, without any attempt to synchronise with the other instrumentalists.  The harmony of this section is based on a 12-note chord built from <a href="/wiki/Major_second" id="w">major seconds</a> and <a href="/wiki/Perfect_fourth" id="w">perfect fourths</a>.  After all the instrumentalists have finished their parts, a two-second general pause is indicated.  The conductor then gives a cue at number 8 (and indicates the tempo of the following section) for two oboes and the cor anglais.  They each play their part, again with no attempt to synchronise with the other players.  The harmony of this part is based on the hexachord F#&#8211;G&#8211;A♭&#8211;C&#8211;D♭&#8211;D, arranged in such a way that the harmony of the section never includes any sixths or thirds.  When the conductor gives another cue at number 9, the players each continue until they reach the <a href="/wiki/Repeat_sign" id="w">repeat sign</a>, and then stop: they are unlikely to end the section at the same time.  This &#34;refrain&#34; (from numbers 8 to 9) recurs throughout the movement, slightly altered each time, but always played by double-reed instruments which do not play elsewhere in the movement: Lutoslawski thus also carefully controls the orchestral palette.<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup></p>

<p>The combination of Lutosławski&#39;s aleatory techniques and his harmonic discoveries allowed him to build up complex <a href="/wiki/Texture_(music)" id="w">musical textures</a>.  In his later works Lutosławski evolved a more mobile, simpler, harmonic style, in which less of the music is played with an <i>ad libitum</i> coordination.<sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup> This development first appeared in the brief <i>Epitaph</i> for oboe and piano,<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup> around the time Lutosławski was struggling to find the technical means to complete his Third Symphony.  In chamber works for just two instrumentalists the scope for aleatory counterpoint and dense harmonies is significantly less than for orchestra,<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[103]</a></sup> but these developments also influenced his orchestral style in late works including the <i>Piano Concerto</i>, <i>Chantefleurs et Chantefables</i>, <i>Chain 2</i> and the <i>Fourth Symphony</i>, which require mostly conventional coordination.</p>
<p>Lutosławski&#39;s formidable technical developments grew out of his creative imperative; that he left a lasting body of major compositions is a testament to his resolution of purpose in the face of the anti-<a href="/wiki/Formalism_(music)" id="w">formalist</a> authorities under which he formulated his methods.<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup></p>
<p>A detailed and thorough discussion of Lutosławski&#39;s music and compositional techniques can be found in both Stucky (1981) and Rae (1999).</p>
