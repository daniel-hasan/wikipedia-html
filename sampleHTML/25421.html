<b>Rapping</b> (also known as <b>emceeing</b>, <b>MCing</b>, <b>spitting</b>, or just <b>rhyming</b>) is the <a href="/wiki/Rhythm" id="w">rhythmic</a> spoken delivery of <a href="/wiki/Rhyme" id="w">rhymes</a> and wordplay, one of the elements of <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_music" id="w">hip hop music</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_culture" id="w">culture</a>. Although the word <i>rap</i> has sometimes been claimed to be a <a href="/wiki/Backronym" id="w">backronym</a> of the phrase &#34;Rhythmic African Poetry&#34;, &#34;Rhythm and Poetry&#34;, &#34;Rhythmically Applied Poetry&#34;, &#34;Rapping About Poetry,&#34; &#34;Racing Always Pacing,&#34; or &#34;Rhythmically Associated Poetry&#34;, use of the word to describe quick speech or repartee long predates the musical form<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>, and is abbreviated from the English word &#34;rapid&#34;, which is from <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> <i>rapidus</i>.</p>
<p>Rapping can be delivered over a <a href="/wiki/Beats_(music)" id="w">beat</a> or without accompaniment.  Stylistically, rap occupies a grey area among speech, prose, poetry, and song. Rap is derived from the <a href="/wiki/Griot" id="w">griots</a> (folk poets) of <a href="/wiki/African_music" id="w">West Africa</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Music" id="w">Caribbean</a>-style <a href="/wiki/Toasting" id="w">toasting</a>.  It also has precedents in traditional <a href="/wiki/Gaelic" id="w">Gaelic</a> music.  modern Rap battles, for instance, bear a striking resemblance to the <a href="/wiki/Limerick_Game" id="w">Limerick Game</a>, a traditional Gaelic <a href="/wiki/Drinking_game" id="w">Drinking game</a> in which people compete for notoriety by making up insulting limericks about each other the the loser having to buy the next round of drinks.  Likewise, <a href="/wiki/Puirt_a_beul" id="w">Puirt a beul</a>, a form of Scottish <a href="/wiki/Mouth_music" id="w">Mouth music</a> was incorporated into Appalachian music and is an early ancestor of modern mouth percussion, or <a href="/wiki/Beatboxing" id="w">Beatboxing</a>.  The influence of Scottish and Irish music on hip hop is not direct since virtually all of the originators of hip hop culture were <a href="/wiki/African_American" id="w">African American</a>, but were transfered indirectly by way of <a href="/wiki/Old-time_music" id="w">American Roots Music</a>.  Roots Music   was created out of the fusion of African and Celtic music in the American south and is typified by the combination of African rhythms, Gaelic melodies, and (occasionally) vocal improvisation.  It forms the basis of virtually all American musical styles from bluegrass to the blues, jazz, rock, funk, and country.  Hip hop grew out of this same tradition; stripping down the melody, emphasizing the rhythm, and incorporating mouth music, battling, and vocal improvisation.</p>
<p>Rapping developed both inside and outside of hip hop culture, and began with the street parties thrown in the Bronx neighborhood of New York in the 70&#39;s by Jamaican expatriate <a href="/wiki/Kool_Herc" id="w">Kool Herc</a> and others.  The parties introduced <a href="/wiki/Dancehall" id="w">dancehall</a> and the practice of having a &#39;Master of Ceremonies,&#39; or MC, get up on stage with the DJ and shout encouragements to the crowd in a practice known as  &#39;toasting&#39;.  Over time, those shouts of encouragement became more longer and more complex and cross-pollinated with the spoken-word poetry scene to evolve into rap.  From the beginning hip hop culture has been syncretic, incorporating sounds and elements from radically divergent sources.  While <a href="/wiki/Funk" id="w">Funk</a> breaks formed the backbone of early hip hop, <a href="/wiki/Kraftwerk" id="w">Kraftwerk</a> and other early techno artists were widely sampled as well.  </p>
<p>In the 1980s, the success of groups like <a href="/wiki/Run-DMC" id="w">Run-DMC</a> led to a huge wave of commercialized rap music. By the end of the 1990s, hip hop became widely accepted in mainstream music. Underground Hip-hop rapping from the 2000s has complex rhythms, <a href="/wiki/Cadence_(music)" id="w">cadences</a>, an intricate <a href="/wiki/Poetic" id="w">poetic form</a>, and inventive <a href="/wiki/Wordplay" id="w">wordplay</a>. Rap lyrics convey the street life from which hip hop originally emerged with references to popular culture and hip-hop slang. Many types of rap also deal with issues such as <a href="/wiki/Race" id="w">race</a>, <a href="/wiki/Socioeconomics" id="w">socioeconomic class</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Gender" id="w">gender</a>.</p>
