The <b>Flood</b> are fictional <a href="/wiki/Parasite" id="w">parasitic</a> <a href="/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" id="w">alien</a> life forms in the <i><a href="/wiki/Halo_(series)" id="w">Halo</a></i> video game series. They are introduced in <i><a href="/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved" id="w">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></i> as a secondary enemy to the game&#39;s protagonist, <a href="/wiki/Master_Chief_(Halo)" id="w">Master Chief</a>, and return in <i><a href="/wiki/Halo_2" id="w">Halo 2</a></i>  and <i><a href="/wiki/Halo_3" id="w">Halo 3</a></i> to fill the same role. The Flood are driven by a desire to infest sentient life they encounter, and are depicted as such a threat that the ancient <a href="/wiki/Forerunner_(Halo)" id="w">Forerunner</a> were forced to kill most of themselves and all other sentient life nearly 100,000 years before the beginning of <i>Halo</i> in an effort to starve the Flood to death.</p>
<p>The player&#39;s discovery of the Flood in <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> is a major plot twist that is kept suspenseful and tense, and was one of the surprises reviewers noted positively upon release. The Flood&#39;s return in <i>Halo 2</i> and <i>Halo 3</i> was less enthusiastically praised. Reaction to the faction varied; while some publications found the Flood too derivative and a clich√©d element of science fiction, <i><a href="/wiki/Wizard_(magazine)" id="w">Wizard Magazine</a></i> rated them among the greatest villains of all time.</p>
<a id="Game_development" name="Game_development"></a><h1>Game development</h1>
<p>The Flood were added early in the game development stage of <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i>, before the game had made its jump from the <a href="/wiki/Apple_Macintosh" id="w">Macintosh</a> platform and Bungie was bought by <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" id="w">Microsoft</a>; a design for one Flood form appeared as early as 1997.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The early design for the Flood was done by Bungie artist and writer Robert McLees, who considers himself &#34;the architect&#34; of the Flood;<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> the Flood&#39;s roots are reflected in some concept art of a &#34;fungal zombie&#34; that McLees did for the earlier Bungie game <i><a href="/wiki/Marathon_2:_Durandal" id="w">Marathon 2: Durandal</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> At one point, the ringworld <i>Halo</i> featured dinosaur-like terrestrial creatures, but due to gameplay constraints, these were dropped. An additional consideration was that Bungie felt the presence of other native species would dilute the impact and surprise of the Flood.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Commenting upon the inception of the Flood, Bungie staff member Chris Butcher noted that &#34;the idea behind the Flood as the forgotten peril that ended a galaxy-spanning empire is a pretty fundamental tenet of good sci-fi. Yeah, and bad sci-fi too.&#34;<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The &#34;Infection&#34; stage of the Flood.</div>
The Flood are depicted as having a complicated lifecycle; small, base forms of Flood infect and mutate hosts into other forms, which ultimately repeat the cycle by spawning the smaller forms. The largest self-contained form that the Flood can produce itself, without using other biomasses,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> is an &#34;Infection form&#34;. As its name suggests, the Infection form homes in on hosts (living or dead), attempting to drive sharp spines into the host and tap into the nervous system. This tap causes the host to be incapacitated, while the Infection form burrows into the host&#39;s body and begins the mutation process, bringing the host under Flood control.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Depending on the size or condition of the body, the Infection form mutates the hapless host into various specialized forms in the continual drive for more food. </p>          
<p>The Flood are also seen to create forms for tasks other than finding sustenance. In <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i>, the Flood create &#34;Brain forms&#34;; these spongy creatures, resembling a large bag of flesh with tentacles, can be used to interrogate victims, stripping information from the mind of the host before eventually assimilating the host into itself entirely.<sup id="_ref-tf200_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tf200" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> In the <i><a href="/wiki/Halo_Graphic_Novel" id="w">Halo Graphic Novel</a></i>, Flood are seen piling dead matter together in order to form a <a href="/wiki/Gravemind" id="w">Gravemind</a>; this form serves as a central intelligence for the infection, and is first encountered in <i><a href="/wiki/Halo_2" id="w">Halo 2</a></i>.</p>

The Flood make their surprise appearance more than halfway through <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i>&#39;s campaign, during the mission &#34;343 Guilty Spark&#34;. The <a href="/wiki/Master_Chief_(Halo)" id="w">Master Chief</a> is sent on an extraction mission by Cortana to try and find Captain <a href="/wiki/Characters_in_the_Halo_series#Jacob Keyes" id="w">Jacob Keyes</a>, who disappears in a swamp while looking for a weapons cache.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The Master Chief finds that the Covenant have released the Flood accidentally, and the sheer numbers of the parasite overwhelm Keyes and his squad. While most of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Space_Command" id="w">UNSC</a> Marines are converted to Combat forms, Keyes is interrogated by the Flood in an attempt to learn the location of Earth. Keyes successfully resists,<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> but is assimilated into a Brain form before the Master Chief can rescue him. The emergence of the Flood prompts Halo&#39;s &#34;Monitor&#34;, <a href="/wiki/343_Guilty_Spark" id="w">343 Guilty Spark</a>, to enlist the help of the Master Chief in activating Halo&#39;s defenses and preventing a Flood outbreak.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> When Master Chief learns of the devastation that Halo would cause if activated, he detonates the <i><a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Space_Command#Pillar of Autumn" id="w">Pillar of Autumn</a></i>&#39;s engines, destabilizing the ring and preventing the Flood from escaping.</p>
<p>In <i>Halo</i>, the Flood appear in three main forms. The largest hosts, namely humans and <a href="/wiki/Covenant_Elite" id="w">Covenant Elites</a>, are turned by the Infection forms into &#34;Combat forms&#34;, which are described as extremely powerful and resilient warriors. Combat forms are able to resist extreme punishment while utilizing either the weapons of their hosts or the long, whip-like tentacles developed during their mutation.<sup id="_ref-h295_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-h295" title="">[13]</a></sup> If a host is unsuitable for combat it will mutate into a &#34;Carrier form&#34;, which transports and spreads more Infection forms. The upper-body of Carrier form swells into a bulbous sac while the legs remain intact. When it moves close enough to a potential host, the Carrier form explodes like a <a href="/wiki/Grenade" id="w">grenade</a>, both releasing its contents and killing anything within range.</p>

The Flood reappear in the <i><a href="/wiki/Halo_3" id="w">Halo 3</a></i> mission &#34;Floodgate&#34;, on board a damaged ship that managed to escape from the quarantine around Delta Halo.

Johnson proceed to Halo&#39;s control room; despite Gravemind&#39;s best efforts, the ring fires. This ends the threat of the Flood- for a time; Gravemind confidently predicts that the Flood&#39;s progress has only been temporarily slowed.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Flood appear in <i>Halo 3</i> with new abilities and forms. A new, mutable Flood combat form appears, called the &#34;Pure Form.&#34; Depending on the situation, these forms can mutate into even more specialized types. According to Bungie, these creatures are formed when the Flood gain access to large enough stocks of calcium, which it uses to form a framework for biomass collected from other species.</p>

<p>The surprise appearance of the Flood during <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> was seen as an important plot twist.<sup id="_ref-gamespot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespot" title="">[29]</a></sup> Actress <a href="/wiki/Aisha_Tyler" id="w">Aisha Tyler</a> said that &#34;[every time the Flood appear], even though I&#39;ve played it a million times, is a totally terrifying moment.&#34;<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Gamasutra" id="w">Gamasutra</a>, writing about video game plots, gives the example of the Flood not only as an important reversal to the story of <i>Halo</i>, but a textbook example of how games and their stories are made more interesting by twists in the plot.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite this, the response to the presence of the Flood in <i>Halo 2</i> and <i>Halo 3</i> was mixed. A panel of online reviewers noted that the Flood appeared in <i>Halo 2</i> for no obvious reasons, and were simply described as &#34;aggravating&#34; to play against.<sup id="_ref-free_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-free" title="">[32]</a></sup> Similarly, reviewers including Victor Godinez of <i>Dallas News</i> felt that the Flood were too derivative of other <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">sci-fi</a> stereotypes, and functioned as &#34;space <a href="/wiki/Zombie" id="w">zombies</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-free_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-free" title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> <i>Gamecritics.com</i> noted in their review of <i>Halo 3</i> that even though the Flood looked better than ever, their single strategy of rushing the player proved tedious.<sup id="_ref-gamecritics review_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamecritics review" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lee Hammock, writer of the <i><a href="/wiki/Halo_Graphic_Novel" id="w">Halo Graphic Novel</a></i> story <i>The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor</i>, described the basis of the story as a way to showcase the true danger of the Flood as an intelligent menace, rather than something the player happens upon and shoots.
