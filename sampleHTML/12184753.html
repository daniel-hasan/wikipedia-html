<p>The <b>Cape Fear Shiner</b>, <i>Notropis mekistocholas</i>, is a species of <a href="/wiki/Ray-finned_fish" id="w">ray-finned fish</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Cyprinidae" id="w">Cyprinidae</a> family. It is <a href="/wiki/Endemism" id="w">endemic</a> to the central part of the state of <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> in the southeastern <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and is only found in the shallow streams of the <a href="/wiki/Cape_Fear_River" id="w">Cape Fear River</a> Basin. The fish is small and yellow with black lips and a black stripe which runs down the middle of the fish&#39;s side. This shiner is normally found in mixed schools with other minnow species. It is unique amongst its <a href="/wiki/Genus" id="w">genus</a> because it has elongated intestines that are specifically adapted to a primarily herbivorous diet. It can breed twice a year and normally lives for only two or three years in the wild. The males and females are normally similar in appearance but become different colors in the spawning season. This species of shiner was not discovered until 1962.</p>
<p>The shiner is <a href="/wiki/Critically_endangered" id="w">critically endangered</a> due to its small population size and threats to its <a href="/wiki/Habitat_destruction" id="w">habitat</a> from <a href="/wiki/Dam" id="w">dam</a> construction and pollution. It was first recognized as threatened in 1987. The species has since undergone a successful captive breeding program and its status has been a significant factor in the destruction of a dam that destroyed part of the shiner&#39;s habitat. However, the species is still limited to just five  populations in the wild and some experts believe that a single toxic chemical spill into the Cape Fear River could wipe out all of these.</p>
<a id="Taxonomy" name="Taxonomy"></a><h2> Taxonomy </h2>
<p>The Cape Fear Shiner was only discovered in 1962<sup id="_ref-Hewitt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hewitt" title="">[1]</a></sup> and described as a distinct species by Franklin F. Snelson, Jr. in 1971.<sup id="_ref-Rabon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rabon" title="">[2]</a></sup> The specific epithet is derived from the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" id="w">Greek</a> <i>mēkistos</i>/μηκιστος - &#39;longest/tallest&#39; or &#39;very long&#39; (a superlative from <i>mēkos</i>/μηκος - length) and...<i>cholas</i>/χολας &#39;intestines&#39; or &#39;bile&#39;.<sup id="_ref-Liddell 1980_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Liddell 1980" title="">[3]</a></sup> This fish belongs to the carp and minnow family <a href="/wiki/Cyprinidae" id="w">Cyprinidae</a>,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> and within this family, it belongs to the genus <i><a href="/wiki/Notropis" id="w">Notropis</a></i>, which includes a large number of eastern North American minnows. The Cape Fear Shiner is unusual in its genus because its intestines are elongated and more convoluted than those of other <i>Notropis</i> species. This feature better adapts the shiner to a diet primarily of plant material.<sup id="_ref-Rabon_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rabon" title="">[2]</a></sup> It is superficially different from similar members of its genus because of the angle and size of its mouth, head shape, eight anal fin rays,<sup id="_ref-Snelson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Snelson" title="">[5]</a></sup> and black edge on its lower lip.<sup id="_ref-Pottern_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pottern" title="">[6]</a></sup> Its closest relatives are the <a href="/wiki/Swallowtail_Shiner" id="w">Swallowtail Shiner</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Sand_Shiner" id="w">Sand Shiner</a>.<sup id="_ref-Snelson_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Snelson" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Description" name="Description"></a><h2> Description </h2>
<p>The Cape Fear Shiner is a small but stocky minnow of about 5 centimeters (2 in) long with a maximum length of 7.7 centimeters (3 in).<sup id="_ref-Fact1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fact1" title="">[7]</a></sup> It is mostly a silvery yellowish shade with a black stripe running down the middle of the fish’s side to its <a href="/wiki/Caudal_peduncle" id="w">caudal peduncle</a> and a lighter stripe above this one.<sup id="_ref-Atlas_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Atlas" title="">[8]</a></sup>  The shiner&#39;s fins are yellowish and moderately pointed.<sup id="_ref-VT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VT" title="">[9]</a></sup> During the spawning season, the males become more golden in color while the females become more silvery.<sup id="_ref-Fact1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fact1" title="">[7]</a></sup> The Cape Fear Shiner&#39;s snout is acute and rounded<sup id="_ref-Snelson_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Snelson" title="">[5]</a></sup> and has a black upper lip and a lower lip that has a thin black bar stretching across its margin.<sup id="_ref-Rabon_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rabon" title="">[2]</a></sup> The upper lip always overhangs above the lower lip.<sup id="_ref-Snelson_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Snelson" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>This minnow typically lives in clean streams over gravel, cobble, and boulder substrates, especially where nearby <a href="/wiki/Justicia_americana" id="w">water willows</a> and <a href="/wiki/Riverweed" id="w">riverweed</a> are available to provide protection from predators.<sup id="_ref-Rabon_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rabon" title="">[2]</a></sup> The shiner rarely ventures into water deeper than 0.5 meters (1.6 ft).<sup id="_ref- Malindzak _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- Malindzak " title="">[12]</a></sup> It has been observed in slow runs, riffles, and slow pools.</p>
<a id="Ecology_and_behavior" name="Ecology_and_behavior"></a><h2>Ecology and behavior</h2>
<p>The Cape Fear Shiner is often found swimming in mixed <a href="/wiki/Swarm" id="w">schools</a> with other minnow species; however, it is never the most numerous minnow in a mixed school.<sup id="_ref-Rabon_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rabon" title="">[2]</a></sup> It has been known to survive for six years in captivity but are only believed to survive for two or three years in the wild.<sup id="_ref-Fact1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fact1" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Cape Fear Shiner&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Intestine" id="w">intestines</a> are adapted to help the fish digest plants and they were initially suggested to be primarily herbivorous because of this adaptation. However, recent studies have shown that the shiner eats a variety of both plant and animal matter.<sup id="_ref-Zoo_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zoo" title="">[10]</a></sup> It is known to eat <a href="/wiki/Detritus" id="w">detritus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" id="w">bacteria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phytoplankton" id="w">phytoplankton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diatom" id="w">diatoms</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Algae" id="w">algae</a>.<sup id="_ref-VT_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VT" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The shiner is threatened by numerous predators, such as <a href="/wiki/Crappie" id="w">crappie</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bass_(fish)" id="w"> bass</a>, and the introduced <a href="/wiki/Flathead_Catfish" id="w">Flathead Catfish</a>.<sup id="_ref-Rabon_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rabon" title="">[2]</a></sup> However, the adult Flathead Catfish does not pose a significant threat because of the differences in habitats of the two species within the river; the juvenile catfish, which share the same habitat as the shiner, may pose a larger threat.<sup id="_ref- Malindzak _b" class="reference"><a href="#_note- Malindzak " title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>This shiner <a href="/wiki/Spawn_(biology)" id="w">spawns</a> around May 15 when the water temperature reaches 19 <a href="/wiki/Celsius" id="w">°C</a> (66.2 <a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit" id="w">°F</a>).<sup id="_ref-Atlas_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Atlas" title="">[8]</a></sup> A second spawning may occur in the late summer.<sup id="_ref-Fact1_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fact1" title="">[7]</a></sup> Both male and female change color while spawning and the male develops a number of small <a href="/wiki/Tubercle" id="w">tubercles</a> along its upper body.<sup id="_ref-Atlas_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Atlas" title="">[8]</a></sup> The shiner generally moves to slower-flowing pools to lay its <a href="/wiki/Egg_(biology)" id="w">eggs</a> in rocky substrates.

The Cape Fear Shiner is only known from five different populations, two of which are extremely small and run a high risk of extinction. The other three populations are more stable and are estimated to number between 1500 and 3000 individual fish that are reproductively viable.<sup id="_ref-Rabon_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rabon" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Cape Fear Shiner was recognized as &#34;Endangered with Critical Habitat&#34; on September 25, 1987 under the <a href="/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act" id="w">Endangered Species Act</a> of 1973. Since 1987, the shiner has dwindled both in range and population.<sup id="_ref-Rabon_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rabon" title="">[2]</a></sup> This fish is also protected from being captured and traded by the <a href="/wiki/Lacey_Act" id="w">Lacey Act</a>.<sup id="_ref-VT_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VT" title="">[9]</a></sup> The shiner is not believed to have had historically large populations.<sup id="_ref-Zoo_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zoo" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>This minnow has been endangered by <a href="/wiki/Dam" id="w">dam</a> construction on the Cape Fear River, which has led to the flooding and destruction of the its shallow water habitat. The small number of geographically separated populations may also threaten the species’ genetic health, although a 2004 study concluded that genetic diversity was still relatively high.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> A deterioration of water quality due to <a href="/wiki/Pollution" id="w">pollution</a> at some of the sites has also threatened the shiner.<sup id="_ref-Rabon_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rabon" title="">[2]</a></sup> Experiments have shown that the shiner is highly sensitive to contaminating chemicals,<sup id="_ref-Hewitt_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hewitt" title="">[1]</a></sup> and experts believe that the wild population of this species can be wiped out by a single toxic chemical spill.<sup id="_ref-VT_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VT" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service" id="w">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</a> has been working to protect this species. Some of the conservation methods used to protect this species include studying its biology in the wild and donating $16,000 in 1998 to help maintain a captive population at the <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_Zoo" id="w">North Carolina Zoo</a>.<sup id="_ref-Zoo_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zoo" title="">[10]</a></sup> Since the first successful captive breeding in 1997, this species has bred easily in captivity. An experiment was carried out in 2001 in which 900 captive-bred shiners were released temporarily into the wild to judge water quality at potential reintroduction sites.<sup id="_ref-Hewitt_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hewitt" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the fall of 2005, work crews began removing the Carbonton Dam, which had destroyed part of the shiner&#39;s habitat. After the work that removed the dam finished in February 2006, the lake fell back to its historic creek levels, allowing the Cape Fear Shiner to expand its range back into the area that was previously unsuitable for inhabitation because of the dam.<sup id="_ref-Dam_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dam" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
