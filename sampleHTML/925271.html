<p>Chaco Canyon&#39;s flora is typical of that found in the high deserts of North America: <a href="/wiki/Artemisia_tridentata" id="w">sagebrush</a> and several species of <a href="/wiki/Cactus" id="w">cactus</a> are interspersed with dry scrub forests of <a href="/wiki/Pinyon_pine" id="w">piñon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Juniper" id="w">juniper</a>, the latter primarily on mesa tops. The canyon receives less precipitation than many other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations; consequently, it does not have the <a href="/wiki/Temperate_coniferous_forests" id="w">temperate coniferous forests</a> that are plentiful in areas to the east. The prevailing sparseness of both plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game.<sup id="_ref-Fagan_2000_222_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fagan_2000_222" title="">[14]</a></sup> As such, even during wet periods, the canyon was only able to sustain around 2,000 people.<sup id="_ref-Fagan_1998_177_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fagan_1998_177" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1949, Chaco Canyon National Monument was expanded with lands deeded from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_New_Mexico" id="w">University of New Mexico</a>. In return, the university maintained scientific research rights to the area. By 1959, the <a href="/wiki/National_Park_Service" id="w">National Park Service</a> had constructed a park visitor center, staff housing, and campgrounds. As a historic property of the National Park Service, the National Monument was listed on the <a href="/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places" id="w">National Register of Historic Places</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_15" id="w">October 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1966" id="w">1966</a>. In 1971, researchers Robert Lister and James Judge established the Chaco Center, a division for cultural research that functioned as a joint project between the <a href="/wiki/University_of_New_Mexico" id="w">University of New Mexico</a> and the National Park Service. A number of multi-disciplinary research projects, archaeological surveys, and limited excavations began during this time. The Chaco Center extensively surveyed the Chacoan roads, well-constructed paths radiating from the central canyon.<sup id="_ref-Strutin_1994_32_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Strutin_1994_32" title="">[37]</a></sup> The results from such research conducted at Pueblo Alto and other sites dramatically altered accepted academic interpretations of both the Chacoan culture and the Four Corners region of the American Southwest.</p>
<p>The richness of the cultural remains at park sites led to the expansion of the small National Monument into the Chaco Culture National Historical Park on <a href="/wiki/December_19" id="w">December 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1980" id="w">1980</a>, when an additional 13,000&#160;acres (53&#160;km²) were added to the protected area. In 1987, the park was designated a <a href="/wiki/World_Heritage_Site" id="w">World Heritage Site</a> by <a href="/wiki/UNESCO" id="w">UNESCO</a>. To safeguard Chacoan sites on adjacent <a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Land_Management" id="w">Bureau of Land Management</a> and <a href="/wiki/Navajo_Nation" id="w">Navajo Nation</a> lands, the Park Service developed the multi-agency Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Site program. These initiatives have detailed the presence of more than 2,400 archeological sites within the current park&#39;s boundaries; only a small percentage of these have been excavated.<sup id="_ref-Strutin_1994_32_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Strutin_1994_32" title="">[37]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Fagan_2005_6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fagan_2005_6" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Management" name="Management"></a><h1> Management </h1>

<p>Chaco Culture National Historical Park is managed by the <a href="/wiki/National_Park_Service" id="w">National Park Service</a>, a federal agency within the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_the_Interior" id="w">Department of the Interior</a>; neighboring federal lands hosting Chacoan roads are under the control of the <a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Land_Management" id="w">Bureau of Land Management</a>. In the 2002–2003 <a href="/wiki/Fiscal_year" id="w">fiscal year</a>, the park&#39;s total annual operating budget was <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$1</a>,434,000.<sup id="_ref-NPS_2005_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NPS_2005" title="">[39]</a></sup> Prior to the 1980s, archeological excavations within the current park were intensive, involving the partial dismantling or demolition of compound walls and extraction of thousands of artifacts. Starting in 1981, a new approach informed by traditional Hopi and Pueblo beliefs led to restrictions on such intrusive excavations, preferring instead methods—including <a href="/wiki/Remote_sensing" id="w">remote sensing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cultural_anthropology" id="w">anthropological</a> research into Indian <a href="/wiki/Oral_tradition" id="w">oral traditions</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dendrochronology" id="w">dendrochronology</a>—that leave the Chacoan sites relatively undisturbed. In this vein, the Chaco American Indian Consultation Committee was established in 1991 in order to allow Navajo, Hopi, Pueblo, and other Indian representatives a voice in the park’s management.<sup id="_ref-NPS_2007_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NPS_2007" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Current park policy mandates partial restoration of excavated sites. &#34;Backfilling&#34;, which involves the use of sand to re-bury excavated sites, is one such technique.<sup id="_ref-NPS_2007_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NPS_2007" title="">[4]</a></sup> Other initiatives include the Chaco Night Sky Program, which seeks to eliminate the impact of <a href="/wiki/Light_pollution" id="w">light pollution</a> on the park&#39;s acclaimed night skies; under the program, some 14,000 visitors make use of the Chaco Observatory (inaugurated in 1998), park telescopes, and astronomy-related programs.<sup id="_ref-NPS_2007_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NPS_2007" title="">[4]</a></sup> However, Chacoan relics outside the current park&#39;s boundaries have been threatened by development: an example was the proposed competitive leasing of federal lands in the San Juan Basin for <a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" id="w">coal mining</a> beginning in 1983. Since ample coal deposits immediately abut the park, the strip mining would have threatened the web of ancient Chacoan roads.

<p>The Chacoans built their complexes along a nine-mile (14&#160;km) stretch of canyon floor, with the walls of some structures aligned cardinally and others aligned with the 18.6&#160;year cycle of minimum and maximum moonrise and moonset. Nine Great Houses are positioned along the north side of Chaco Wash, at the base of massive sandstone mesas. Other Great Houses are found on mesa tops or in nearby washes and drainage areas. There are 14 recognized Great Houses, which are grouped below according to geographic positioning with respect to the canyon.</p>
<a id="Central_canyon" name="Central_canyon"></a><h2> Central canyon </h2>

<p>The central portion of the canyon contains the largest Chacoan complexes. The most studied is <a href="/wiki/Pueblo_Bonito" id="w">Pueblo Bonito</a> (&#34;Beautiful Village&#34;); covering almost 2&#160;acres (8,000&#160;m²) and comprising at least 650 rooms, it is the largest Great House; in parts of the complex, the structure was four stories high. The builders&#39; use of core-and-veneer architecture and multi-story construction necessitated massive masonry walls up to 3&#160;feet (1&#160;m) thick. Pueblo Bonito is divided into two sections by a wall precisely aligned to run north-south, bisecting the central plaza. A Great Kiva was placed on either side of the wall, creating a symmetrical pattern common to many Chacoan Great Houses. The complex, upon completion, was roughly the size of the <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Roman</a> <a href="/wiki/Colosseum" id="w">Colosseum</a>.<sup id="_ref-Sofaer_1997_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sofaer_1997" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

<p>Nearby is <a href="/wiki/Pueblo_del_Arroyo" id="w">Pueblo del Arroyo</a>; founded between AD 1050 and 1075 and completed in the early 12th century, it is located near Pueblo Bonito at a drainage outlet known as South Gap. Casa Rinconada, hosting a Great Kiva and relatively isolated from other sites in Chaco Canyon, sits to the south side of Chaco Wash, adjacent to a Chacoan road leading to a set of steep stairs that reached the top of Chacra Mesa. The kiva stands alone, with no residential or support structures; it once had a 39-foot (12&#160;m) passageway leading from the underground kiva to several above-ground levels. <a href="/wiki/Chetro_Ketl" id="w">Chetro Ketl</a>, located near Pueblo Bonito, bears the typical D-shape of many other central complexes, but is slightly smaller. Begun between AD 1020 and 1050, its 450–550 rooms shared just one Great Kiva. Scientists estimate that it took 29,135&#160;person-hours of construction to erect Chetro Ketl alone; Hewett estimated that it required the wood of 5,000 trees and 50 million stone blocks.<sup id="_ref-Strutin_1994_26_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Strutin_1994_26" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>

Its rectangular shape and design is related to the Pueblo II cultural group, rather than the Pueblo III style or its Chacoan variant. It contains around 55 rooms, four ground-floor kivas, and a two-story cylindrical tower that may have functioned as a kiva or religious center.

Its location made the community visible to most of the inhabitants of the San Juan Basin; indeed, it was only 2.3&#160;miles (3.7&#160;km) north of Tsin Kletsin, on the opposite side of the canyon. The community was the center of a <a href="/wiki/Bead" id="w">bead</a>- and <a href="/wiki/Turquoise" id="w">turquoise</a>-processing industry that influenced the development of all villages in the canyon; <a href="/wiki/Chert" id="w">chert</a> tool production was also common. Research conducted by archaeologist Tom Windes at the site suggests that only a handful of families, perhaps as few as five to twenty, actually lived in the complex; this may imply that Pueblo Alto served a primarily non-residential role.<sup id="_ref-Fagan_2005_10-11_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fagan_2005_10-11" title="">[44]</a></sup> Another Great House, <a href="/wiki/Nuevo_Alto" id="w">Nuevo Alto</a>, was built on the north mesa near Pueblo Alto; it was founded in the late 1100s, a time when the Chacoan population was declining in the canyon.</p>

<p>Immense complexes known as &#34;Great Houses&#34; were key centers exemplifying Chacoan architectural and worship styles. Although forms evolved as the centuries passed, the houses maintained several core characteristics. Most notable is their sheer bulk; most complexes in Chaco Canyon averaged more than 200 rooms each, with some reaching up to 700 rooms.<sup id="_ref-Sofaer_1997_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sofaer_1997" title="">[41]</a></sup> The sizes of individual rooms were also substantial, with high ceilings when compared to buildings erected in preceding Anasazi periods. They were also well-planned, with vast sections or wings erected in a single stage, rather than in increments. Houses are generally oriented to face the south, with plaza areas almost always enclosed by edifices of sealed-off rooms or high walls. The predominantly multistory constructions often stood four to five stories tall, with single-story rooms facing directly onto the plaza; room blocks were terraced so that the tallest sections composed the pueblo&#39;s rear edifice. Rooms were often organized into suites, with front rooms larger than rear, interior, and storage rooms or areas.</p>
<p>Ceremonial structures known as <a href="/wiki/Kiva" id="w">kivas</a> were built in proportion to the number of rooms in a pueblo. On average, one small kiva was built for every 29 rooms. Nine complexes also each hosted an oversized Great Kiva, which could range up to 63&#160;feet (19&#160;m) in diameter. All Chacoan kivas share distinctive architectural features, including T-shaped doorways and stone <a href="/wiki/Lintel" id="w">lintels</a>. Though simple and compound walls were also built, Great Houses were primarily constructed of <a href="/wiki/Core-and-veneer" id="w">core-and-veneer</a> walls: two parallel load-bearing walls comprising dressed, flat <a href="/wiki/Sandstone" id="w">sandstone</a> blocks bound in <a href="/wiki/Clay" id="w">clay</a> mortar were erected.

<p>The meticulously designed buildings characterizing the larger Chacoan complexes did not emerge until around AD 1030. The Chacoan people combined pre-planned architectural designs, astronomical alignments, geometry, landscaping, and engineering to create an ancient urban center of unique public architecture. Researchers have concluded that the complex may have had a relatively small residential population, with larger groups assembling only temporarily for annual events and ceremonies.<sup id="_ref-Sofaer_1999_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sofaer_1999" title="">[5]</a></sup> Smaller sites, apparently more residential in character, are scattered near the Great Houses in and around Chaco Canyon. The canyon itself runs along one of the lunar alignment lines, suggesting the location was originally chosen for its astronomical significance. If nothing else, this facilitated alignment with several other key structures in the canyon.<sup id="_ref-Sofaer_1997_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sofaer_1997" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Around this time, the extended Ancestral Puebloan (<a href="/wiki/Anasazi" id="w">Anasazi</a>) community also experienced a population and construction boom. Throughout the 10th century, Chacoan construction techniques gradually spread from the canyon to neighboring regions.<sup id="_ref-Fagan_2005_204_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fagan_2005_204" title="">[56]</a></sup> By AD 1115, at least 70 outlying pueblos with characteristic Chacoan architecture had been built within the 25,000&#160;square miles (65,000&#160;sq.&#160;km) that compose the San Juan Basin. Researchers debate the function of the buildings, some of which are large enough to be considered Great Houses in their own right. Some suggest they may have been more than agricultural communities, perhaps functioning as trading posts or ceremonial sites.<sup id="_ref-Fagan_2005_202-208_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fagan_2005_202-208" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
