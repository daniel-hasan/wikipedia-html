<p><b>USS <i>Tracy</i> (DD-214/DM-19)</b> was a <a href="/wiki/Clemson_class_destroyer" id="w">&#39;&#39;Clemson&#39;&#39;-class</a> <a href="/wiki/Destroyer" id="w">destroyer</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" id="w">United States Navy</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>. She was the only ship named for <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Navy" id="w">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin_Tracy" id="w">Benjamin Franklin Tracy</a>.</p>
<p><i>Tracy</i> was laid down on <a href="/wiki/3_April" id="w">3 April</a> and launched on <a href="/wiki/13_August" id="w">13 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1919" id="w">1919</a> by the <a href="/wiki/William_Cramp_and_Sons" id="w">William Cramp and Sons</a>&#39; Shipyard; sponsored by Mrs. Frank B. Tracy; and commissioned on <a href="/wiki/9_March" id="w">9 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a>, Commander Lawrence P. Treadwell in command.</p>
<a id="1920_%E2%80%93_1941" name="1920_%E2%80%93_1941"></a><h1>1920 – 1941</h1>

<p>Following commissioning, <i>Tracy</i> cruised on shakedown to the <a href="/wiki/Dry_Tortugas" id="w">Dry Tortugas</a> before returning to Philadelphia. She steamed with Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 39 for duty in the Near East, arriving at <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a>, <a href="/wiki/Turkey" id="w">Turkey</a>, in early June 1920.</p>
<p>With the troubled international situation in the Near East, American naval forces &#34;showed the flag&#34; and stood ready to protect American lives and property. <i>Tracy</i> touched at principal <a href="/wiki/Black_Sea" id="w">Black Sea</a> ports and also visited cities along the coasts of <a href="/wiki/Palestine" id="w">Palestine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>, as well as Mediterranean Turkey.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War" id="w">Russian Civil War</a> the <a href="/wiki/Bolsheviks" id="w">Bolsheviks</a> began to overwhelm the <a href="/wiki/White_Russian" id="w">White Russian</a> forces and many felt compelled to evacuate. <i>Tracy</i> was one of the ships which embarked hundreds of refugees at <a href="/wiki/Sevastopol" id="w">Sevastopol</a> and carried them to Constantinople.</p>
<p>In June 1921, she sailed with her division for the <a href="/wiki/Far_East" id="w">Far East</a>, transiting the <a href="/wiki/Suez_Canal" id="w">Suez Canal</a> and touching at ports in <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ceylon" id="w">Ceylon</a>, <a href="/wiki/French_Indochina" id="w">French Indochina</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Java_(island)" id="w">Java</a> before finally reaching <a href="/wiki/Manila" id="w">Manila</a> late in August 1921.</p>
<p><i>Tracy</i> initially operated independently with the <a href="/wiki/South_China_Patrol" id="w">South China Patrol</a>, &#34;showing the flag&#34; at the ports upon which she called. Detached from this duty in the spring of 1923, she steamed to <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> for a goodwill cruise before proceeding to <a href="/wiki/Chefoo" id="w">Chefoo</a> for summer maneuvers.</p>
<p>Anchored at <a href="/wiki/Dairen" id="w">Dairen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manchuria" id="w">Manchuria</a>, in early September 1923, <i>Tracy</i> received orders to get underway immediately for <a href="/wiki/Yokohama" id="w">Yokohama</a>, Japan, which had been rocked by a severe earthquake. Upon arrival, she participated in the initial relief work there and carried refugees from Yokohama to Tokyo. She sent repair parties ashore to assist in laying fresh water lines and remained in the Yokohama area for two weeks before heading for <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" id="w">Shanghai</a>.</p>
<p>There, her landing party went ashore to guard the American-owned <a href="/wiki/Shanghai_Light_and_Power_Company" id="w">Shanghai Light and Power Company</a> until relieved on <a href="/wiki/12_October" id="w">12 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a> by a force from armored <a href="/wiki/Cruiser" id="w">cruiser</a> <a href="/wiki/USS_South_Dakota_(ACR-9)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Huron&#39;&#39;</a>. Proceeding to Manila, she spent some time in that port before commencing a cruise to southern Philippine ports on <a href="/wiki/26_November" id="w">26 November</a>. For the remainder of her tour in the <a href="/wiki/Asiatic_Fleet" id="w">Asiatic Fleet</a>, she carried out flag-showing cruises and exercises before departing for the United States on <a href="/wiki/8_May" id="w">8 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1925" id="w">1925</a>. At <a href="/wiki/Midway_Atoll" id="w">Midway</a>, her division was relieved by DesDiv 39.</p>
<p>Arriving in <a href="/wiki/San_Diego%2C_California" id="w">San Diego, California</a>, on <a href="/wiki/17_June" id="w">17 June</a>, <i>Tracy</i> was refitted and received new fire-control instruments. She departed the west coast on <a href="/wiki/24_June" id="w">24 June</a> and proceeded, via the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Canal" id="w">Panama Canal</a>, to <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>. Spending the next two years with the <a href="/wiki/Scouting_Fleet" id="w">Scouting Fleet</a>, <i>Tracy</i> wound up her tour by taking part in the reinforcement operations for the <a href="/wiki/Special_Service_Squadron" id="w">Special Service Squadron</a> in Nicaraguan waters during the revolution and civil strife which had broken out in that country in November and December 1926.</p>
<p>Following overhaul by the <a href="/wiki/Norfolk_Navy_Yard" id="w">Norfolk Navy Yard</a>, <i>Tracy</i> returned briefly to Nicaraguan waters in March 1927 and then proceeded north. Steaming from <a href="/wiki/Newport%2C_Rhode_Island" id="w">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, on <a href="/wiki/1_June" id="w">1 June</a> with DesDiv 38, she visited <a href="/wiki/Queenstown%2C_Northern_Ireland" id="w">Queenstown, Northern Ireland</a> before touching at ports in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portugal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Algeria" id="w">Algeria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tunisia" id="w">Tunisia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>. Departing <a href="/wiki/Gibraltar" id="w">Gibraltar</a> on <a href="/wiki/28_January" id="w">28 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1928" id="w">1928</a>, she operated in the Atlantic for one month before orders transferred DesDiv 38 to the <a href="/wiki/Battle_Fleet" id="w">Battle Fleet</a>. Based at San Diego from <a href="/wiki/1_April" id="w">1 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1928" id="w">1928</a> until the spring of 1929, <i>Tracy</i> served on occasion as plane guard destroyer with <a href="/wiki/USS_Lexington_(CV-2)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Lexington&#39;&#39;</a> (CV-2) and <a href="/wiki/USS_Saratoga_(CV-3)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Saratoga&#39;&#39;</a> (CV-3) before preparing at <a href="/wiki/Mare_Island_Navy_Yard" id="w">Mare Island Navy Yard</a>, in June and July 1929, for duty in the Far East.</p>
<p>DesDiv 38 relieved DesDiv 45 at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and then proceeded to Japan for a goodwill visit, arriving at Yokohama on <a href="/wiki/26_August" id="w">26 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1929" id="w">1929</a>.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Asiatic Fleet&#39;s routine, <i>Tracy</i> alternated duty in China ports in the summer with operations in the Philippines during the winter. The months in between were spent in cruises along the Chinese coast, engaged in &#34;showing the flag&#34; and exercises. During the fall of 1930, after a cruise to the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands_East_Indies" id="w">Netherlands East Indies</a>, she was fitted out for extended independent duties as station ship, Chefoo, China.</p>
<p>Japan&#39;s seizure of Manchuria in September 1931 and the fighting between Japanese and Chinese forces around Shanghai in February 1932 enlivened the Asiatic Fleet&#39;s duty at this juncture, but <i>Tracy<b>s activities were limited to keeping a watchful eye on American interests. Later in the year, the destroyer received orders assigning her once again to the Battle Force, and she left the Asiatic Fleet for the last time.</b></i></p>
<p><i>Tracy</i> took part in maneuvers and exercises in the Pacific and off the west coast before being reclassified as a destroyer minelayer and redesignated <b>DM-19</b> on <a href="/wiki/30_June" id="w">30 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1937" id="w">1937</a>. <i>Tracy</i> was then assigned to Mine Division 1 and operated out of Pearl Harbor with the Battle Force.</p>
<a id="World_War_II" name="World_War_II"></a><h1>World War II</h1>

<p>In late 1941, her division entered the navy yard at Pearl Harbor for overhaul. On <a href="/wiki/7_December" id="w">7 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, <i>Tracy</i> lay at berth 15 of the yard with her machinery, boilers, and guns dismantled. Most of her complement were living in the receiving barracks ashore, and only a skeleton crew was on board. As <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" id="w">Japanese planes swept overhead</a>, <i>Tracy<b>s crew boarded their ship and sought to find ways to fight back.</b></i></p>
<p>Some sailors went to <a href="/wiki/USS_Cummings_(DD-376)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Cummings&#39;&#39;</a> (DD-376) and helped to man her guns, others boarded <a href="/wiki/USS_Pennsylvania_(BB-38)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Pennsylvania&#39;&#39;</a> (BB-38) and assisted in operating the battleship&#39;s antiaircraft batteries. Meanwhile, back on board <i>Tracy</i>, the remaining sailors, after assembling three .30-caliber Lewis guns and two .50-caliber Brownings, did their best to drive off the attackers. When the raid ended, a party of 10 men from the destroyer minesweeper assisted in fighting the fires raging onboard stricken <a href="/wiki/USS_California_(BB-44)" id="w">&#39;&#39;California&#39;&#39;</a> (BB-44).</p>
<p>Following the interrupted overhaul at the navy yard, <i>Tracy</i> went to sea to commence wartime operations. On <a href="/wiki/31_March" id="w">31 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>, she assisted in laying a minefield near <a href="/wiki/French_Frigate_Shoals" id="w">French Frigate Shoals</a> before returning to Pearl Harbor and conducting local operations. She then headed for <a href="/wiki/Suva" id="w">Suva</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/Fiji_Islands" id="w">Fiji Islands</a>, on <a href="/wiki/23_July" id="w">23 July</a>. Seven days later, in company with <a href="/wiki/USS_Breese_(DM-18)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Breese&#39;&#39;</a> (DM-18) and <a href="/wiki/USS_Gamble_(DM-15)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Gamble&#39;&#39;</a> (DM-15), <i>Tracy</i> arrived at Suva before proceeding from there to <a href="/wiki/Espiritu_Santo" id="w">Espiritu Santo</a>.</p>
<p>At bases in the Southwest Pacific, American forces prepared for their first amphibious assault of the war, the <a href="/wiki/Solomon_Islands" id="w">Solomon Islands</a>. <i>Tracy</i>, in Task Force (TF) 62, arrived off the beaches of <a href="/wiki/Guadalcanal" id="w">Guadalcanal</a> on <a href="/wiki/7_August" id="w">7 August</a>, as the guns of US cruisers and destroyers conducted a shore bombardment. She took part in the hard fought campaign for the islands, engaged in the unglamorous but vital tasks of escort duty and antisubmarine patrol. She operated between Espiritu Santo and the battle zones through the summer and fall of 1942 before returning to Pearl Harbor in December for a brief refit. On <a href="/wiki/18_December" id="w">18 December</a> she set out for <a href="/wiki/New_Caledonia" id="w">New Caledonia</a>, escorting a west-bound convoy, and arrived with her charges at <a href="/wiki/Noum%C3%A9a" id="w">Nouméa</a> on <a href="/wiki/2_January" id="w">2 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a>.</p>
<p>Designated a unit in TF 66, she operated out of Nouméa and <a href="/wiki/Nadi" id="w">Nadi</a>, on occasion engaged in laying minefields around the American and Allied bases. She also delivered much-needed gasoline to <a href="/wiki/Henderson_Field_(Guadalcanal)" id="w">Henderson Field</a>, on Guadalcanal, for the aircraft of the <a href="/wiki/Cactus_Air_Force" id="w">Cactus Air Force</a>.</p>
<p>By late January 1943, the Japanese had decided to abandon Guadalcanal and had begun to evacuate as many men as possible. Increased Japanese surface activity, and corresponding air cover, tipped off the Americans that major Japanese troop movements were taking place, and orders went out to try to derail the <a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Express" id="w">Tokyo Express</a> by any means possible including mines, <a href="/wiki/PT-boat" id="w">PT-boats</a>, and air strikes.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/1_February" id="w">1 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a>, a large force of Japanese destroyers was sighted heading for &#34;Ironbottom Sound.&#34; <i>Tracy</i>, as task group leader, led <a href="/wiki/USS_Montgomery_(DM-17)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Montgomery&#39;&#39;</a> (DM-17) and <a href="/wiki/USS_Preble_(DM-20)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Preble&#39;&#39;</a> (DM-20) in laying a field of 300 mines between <a href="/wiki/Doma_Reef" id="w">Doma Reef</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cape_Esperance" id="w">Cape Esperance</a>. That night, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Makigumo_(1942)" id="w">Japanese destroyer &#39;&#39;Makigumo&#39;&#39;</a> struck one of these mines and was damaged so badly that she was scuttled. Nevertheless, the Japanese managed to extricate their garrison from Guadalcanal.</p>
<p>Following this action, <i>Tracy</i> rejoined TF 62 for escort duty and touched at Nouméa, <a href="/wiki/Tulagi" id="w">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Efate" id="w">Efate</a> before heading for <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaii</a> on <a href="/wiki/19_April" id="w">19 April</a>. She reached Pearl Harbor on <a href="/wiki/1_May" id="w">1 May</a> and, 11 days later, headed toward <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco%2C_California" id="w">San Francisco, California</a> for a much needed overhaul at Mare Island.</p>
<p>After refitting, <i>Tracy</i> departed San Francisco on <a href="/wiki/22_May" id="w">22 May</a> and spent the next few months engaged in &#34;milk run&#34; convoys between the Hawaiian islands and the west coast. On <a href="/wiki/10_August" id="w">10 August</a>, she departed Pearl Harbor and steamed to Samoa and thence set her course toward Espiritu Santo and the South Pacific.</p>
<p>At the end of November 1943, <i>Tracy</i> led a division of minelayers in placing an offensive minefield near <a href="/wiki/Bougainville_Island" id="w">Bougainville</a> in preparations for the landings there.</p>
<p>Next, operating out of Noumea for the remainder of 1943, <i>Tracy</i> called at <a href="/wiki/Funafuti" id="w">Funafuti</a>, Espiritu Santo, and Guadalcanal through December. On <a href="/wiki/1_January" id="w">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a> she steamed in convoy with <a href="/wiki/USS_President_Jackson_(AP-37)" id="w">&#39;&#39;President Jackson&#39;&#39;</a> (AP-37), <a href="/wiki/USS_President_Hayes_(AP-39)" id="w">&#39;&#39;President Hayes&#39;&#39;</a> (AP-39), <a href="/wiki/USS_President_Adams_(AP-38)" id="w">&#39;&#39;President Adams&#39;&#39;</a> (AP-38), <a href="/wiki/USS_Titania_(AK-55)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Titania&#39;&#39;</a> (AK-55), and <a href="/wiki/USS_Athena_(AK-26)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Athena&#39;&#39;</a> (AK-26) to the Fiji Islands, arriving at Nandi on <a href="/wiki/5_January" id="w">5 January</a>.</p>
<p>Underway again the following day, <i>Tracy</i> escorted another convoy to Guadalcanal, conducting gunnery exercises en route, and arrived on the 10th. Later in the month, she departed Efate, <a href="/wiki/New_Hebrides" id="w">New Hebrides</a>, bound for New Caledonia in company with <i>President Hayes</i>. During the passage, they fought through a storm before arriving at Noumea on the 19th. Upon the completion of refueling there, she proceeded to <a href="/wiki/Wellington%2C_New_Zealand" id="w">Wellington, New Zealand</a>. For the remainder of January and continuing into May, she threaded her way among the Pacific Isles, escorting convoys and carrying out exercises en route.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/3_June" id="w">3 June</a>, she arrived in San Francisco to commence overhaul at Hunters Point. Upon conclusion of the yard work, <i>Tracy</i> underwent refresher training off the west coast, ranging as far north as <a href="/wiki/Seattle%2C_Washington" id="w">Seattle</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bremerton%2C_Washington" id="w">Bremerton, Washington</a>. On <a href="/wiki/31_August" id="w">31 August</a>, she departed Seattle in company with SS <i>Cushman K. Davis</i> bound for <a href="/wiki/Oahu" id="w">Oahu</a>, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on <a href="/wiki/9_September" id="w">9 September</a>.</p>
<p>After a navy yard availability from 12 to <a href="/wiki/24_September" id="w">24 September</a>, she got underway on the 29th, bound for the Marshalls in company with Convoy BD-110T. Arriving at Eniwetok on <a href="/wiki/8_October" id="w">8 October</a>, she commenced further convoy runs between Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, and Pearl Harbor and San Francisco.</p>
<p>With <a href="/wiki/Iwo_Jima" id="w">Iwo Jima</a> secured, the Navy then turned its attention to <a href="/wiki/Okinawa" id="w">Okinawa</a>. <i>Tracy</i> served as  a buoy-laying and mine disposal vessel, arriving off the island on <a href="/wiki/1_April" id="w">1 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>. In support of the Okinawa invasion, she engaged in antisubmarine and antismall boat patrols off the Fleet anchorages and while conducting screening duty, she rescued survivors from <i>LCI(G)-82</i> which had been hit by a Japanese suicide motorboat. <i>Tracy</i> herself came through this sustained and effective period of <a href="/wiki/Kamikaze" id="w">Kamikaze</a> assault on the US Fleet unscathed. She departed for <a href="/wiki/Ulithi" id="w">Ulithi</a> on <a href="/wiki/16_April" id="w">16 April</a> and arrived on <a href="/wiki/22_April" id="w">22 April</a> at the atoll to commence a period of upkeep and availability which lasted until <a href="/wiki/2_May" id="w">2 May</a>. Continuing operations in the western Pacific, she took part in convoy escort duties through July, when she escorted an LST convoy from Okinawa to <a href="/wiki/Leyte_(island)" id="w">Leyte</a>, anchoring in San Pedro Bay, Leyte, P.I., on <a href="/wiki/3_July" id="w">3 July</a>. From 5 to <a href="/wiki/17_July" id="w">17 July</a>, she underwent tender availability before entering floating drydock ARD-2 for hull repairs.</p>
<p>Under the operational control of Minecraft, <a href="/wiki/U.S._Pacific_Fleet" id="w">Pacific Fleet</a>, she anchored at San Pedro Bay through the middle of August. On <a href="/wiki/10_August" id="w">10 August</a>, her radio picked up an unofficial Japanese broadcast which announced that Japan had agreed to accept unconditional surrender terms. <i>Tracy<b>s log noted &#34;much blowing of whistles and searchlight displays by Fleet units present.&#34;</b></i></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/15_August" id="w">15 August</a>, she got underway as part of the screen for TU 72.5.38, and, while en route to Okinawa she received word to cease all offensive activities. Entering <a href="/wiki/Buckner_Bay" id="w">Buckner Bay</a>, Okinawa, on <a href="/wiki/20_August" id="w">20 August</a>, she lay at anchor for five days before transferring Mark VI buoys from <a href="/wiki/USS_Weehawken_(CM-12)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Weehawken&#39;&#39;</a> (CM-12) to various other fast <a href="/wiki/Minesweeper_(ship)" id="w">minesweepers</a> gathering to commence the job of sweeping up the mines sown during the war.</p>
<p>The end of the war in the Pacific in August marked only the beginning of <i>Tracy<b>s participation in the gigantic minesweeping efforts in Japanese home waters. From Buckner Bay, the ship proceeded to Japan and she arrived in <a href="/wiki/Nagasaki_Wan" id="w">Nagasaki Wan</a> on <a href="/wiki/11_September" id="w">11 September</a> one of the first Allied ships to enter that expanse of water. She served as buoy-laying and mine-disposal vessel during the minesweeping operations which cleared the sea lanes outside of that key seaport and continued these duties until late in October, when she sailed for home.</b></i></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/25_October" id="w">25 October</a> she departed for Pearl Harbor, calling briefly at Buckner Bay en route. Arriving at the Hawaiian base in mid-November, she departed there on the 18th, bound via San Diego, California, and <a href="/wiki/Salina_Cruz" id="w">Salina Cruz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a> for the Panama Canal. </p>
<p>She arrived at New York in December 1945 and was decommissioned on <a href="/wiki/19_January" id="w">19 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1946" id="w">1946</a>. Struck from the <a href="/wiki/Naval_Vessel_Register" id="w">Navy list</a> on <a href="/wiki/7_February" id="w">7 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1946" id="w">1946</a>, she was sold to the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Metals_Company" id="w">Northern Metals Company</a> of Philadelphia, and scrapped later in the year.</p>
