<p>The <b>1918 Swan by-election</b> was a <a href="/wiki/By-election" id="w">by-election</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Division_of_Swan" id="w">Division of Swan</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Australian_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Australian House of Representatives</a>, following the death of the sitting member Sir <a href="/wiki/John_Forrest" id="w">John Forrest</a>. Held on <a href="/wiki/26_October" id="w">26 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a>, the by-election not only led to the election of the youngest person ever to be elected to the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia" id="w">Parliament of Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Corboy" id="w">Edwin Corboy</a>, but saw the conservative vote split by the <a href="/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia" id="w">Country Party</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Nationalist_Party_of_Australia" id="w">Nationalist Party</a>, directly prompting the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting" id="w">instant-runoff voting</a> in <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>.</p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h2>Background</h2>

<p>Sir <a href="/wiki/John_Forrest" id="w">John Forrest</a>, who had been the first <a href="/wiki/Premier_of_Western_Australia" id="w">Premier of Western Australia</a>, was elected to the <a href="/wiki/Australian_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Australian House of Representatives</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Division_of_Swan" id="w">Division of Swan</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Australian_federal_election%2C_1901" id="w">first federal election</a> on <a href="/wiki/29_March" id="w">29 March</a> 1901.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/6_February" id="w">6 February</a> 1918, Forrest was offered a place in the British peerage (he was to be created Baron Forrest of <a href="/wiki/Bunbury%2C_Western_Australia" id="w">Bunbury</a>), though the relevant <a href="/wiki/Letters_patent" id="w">letters patent</a> had not at the time been issued. Forrest set out for England to accept the offer and take up his place in the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords" id="w">House of Lords</a>, but he died en route on <a href="/wiki/2_September" id="w">2 September</a> 1918, off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Leone" id="w">Sierra Leone</a>, from <a href="/wiki/Cancer" id="w">cancer</a>. Thus, a by-election was called to replace Forrest as the representative for Swan.</p>
<a id="Electoral_system_and_political_parties_in_Australia" name="Electoral_system_and_political_parties_in_Australia"></a><h3>Electoral system and political parties in Australia</h3>

<p>By 1909, Australia had a stable <a href="/wiki/Two-party_system" id="w">two-party system</a> at the federal level, with the conservative <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_Liberal_Party" id="w">Commonwealth Liberal Party</a> and the progressive <a href="/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" id="w">Australian Labor Party</a> alternating terms in power. This system was upset in November 1916, when the Labor party split over the issue of <a href="/wiki/Conscription_in_Australia" id="w">conscription</a>; then <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Australia" id="w">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Billy_Hughes" id="w">Billy Hughes</a> and his pro-conscription supporters leaving the Labor party and forming a <a href="/wiki/Minority_government" id="w">minority government</a> as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/National_Labor_Party" id="w">National Labor Party</a>&#34;, before merging with the Liberals in February 1917 to form the <a href="/wiki/Nationalist_Party_of_Australia" id="w">Nationalist Party of Australia</a> with Hughes as their leader.<sup id="_ref-green_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-green" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, Hughes was distrusted by some on the conservative side of politics for his past involvement in <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialist</a> politics as Labor leader, and disaffected conservative farmers were moved to support the new Country Party, now known as the <a href="/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia" id="w">National Party of Australia</a>, which had been formed in Western Australia in 1913 (and would be formed federally in 1922 from an amalgamation of state-based parties).<sup id="_ref-green_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-green" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the time of the 1918 Swan by-election, Australia used a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Plurality_voting_system" id="w">first past the post</a>&#34; <a href="/wiki/Voting_system" id="w">voting system</a>, as was used in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>, in all elections at the federal level.<sup id="_ref-green_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-green" title="">[1]</a></sup> Under this system, the winner was simply the candidate with the greatest number of votes.</p>
<a id="Election" name="Election"></a><h2>Election</h2>

<p>Candidates from both the conservative parties contested the election — <a href="/wiki/William_Hedges_(Australian_politician)" id="w">William Hedges</a> from the Nationalist Party and Basil Murray from the Country Party — against <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Corboy" id="w">Edwin Corboy</a> from Labor and <a href="/wiki/Independent_(politician)" id="w">independent</a> candidate <a href="/wiki/William_Watson_(Australian_politician)" id="w">William Watson</a>. Hedges was previously a member of the House of Representatives for the <a href="/wiki/Division_of_Fremantle" id="w">Division of Fremantle</a>, from 1906 to 1913.<sup id="_ref-curtin hedges_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-curtin hedges" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Results" name="Results"></a><h3>Results</h3>

<p>In the end, the Nationalist and Country candidates split the conservative vote, Hedges achieving 29.6% and Murray gathering 31.4% of the total; however, both were beaten by the Labor candidate Corboy, who received 34.4% of the total vote.<sup id="_ref-election archive 1917by_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-election archive 1917by" title="">[3]</a></sup> Corboy was duly elected as the member for Swan.</p>

<p>Corboy, who at the time of the by-election was just twenty-two years and two months old, remains the youngest person ever to be elected to either house of the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia" id="w">Parliament of Australia</a>.<sup id="_ref-election archive records_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-election archive records" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-aph selected records_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aph selected records" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shocked by the loss of a previously safe Nationalist seat to Labor, the Nationalist government was moved to initiate electoral reform and replace the first past the post system with <a href="/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting" id="w">instant-runoff voting</a> (typically referred to as preferential voting in Australia), as part of a rewrite of the electoral legislation with the <i><a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_Electoral_Act_1918" id="w">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-aec history_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aec history" title="">[6]</a></sup> While preferential voting had already been introduced at the <a href="/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia" id="w">state level</a> in <a href="/wiki/Western_Australia" id="w">Western Australia</a> (1907) and <a href="/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)" id="w">Victoria</a> (1911), and had been considered at the federal level by Sir <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Cook" id="w">Joseph Cook</a>&#39;s government (1913-1914), it was only these &#34;considerations of partisan advantage [and not] the finer points of electoral theory&#34; which provided the impetus for the change.<sup id="_ref-reilly_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reilly" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Preferential voting was first put to use in the <a href="/wiki/Corangamite_by-election%2C_1918" id="w">Corangamite by-election</a> for the Victorian seat of <a href="/wiki/Division_of_Corangamite" id="w">Corangamite</a> two months later, where Labor candidate and future Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/James_Scullin" id="w">James Scullin</a> topped the primary vote, only to be defeated after distribution of preferences by <a href="/wiki/William_Gibson_(Australian_politician)" id="w">William Gibson</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Victorian_Farmers_Union" id="w">Victorian Farmers Union</a>.<sup id="_ref-green_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-green" title="">[1]</a></sup> The preferential voting system remains in place to this day, and has helped to support a fairly stable three-party system, albeit with the non-Labor parties (presently the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" id="w">Liberal Party of Australia</a> and the since-renamed National Party) regularly forming coalition governments.<sup id="_ref-green_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-green" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/Australian_federal_election%2C_1919" id="w">1919 election</a>, Corboy once again polled the highest percentage of the primary vote, with two conservative candidates again splitting the conservative vote; yet with the introduction of preferential voting, Corboy was easily defeated by <a href="/wiki/John_Prowse" id="w">John Prowse</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Farmers%26%2339%3B_and_Settlers%26%2339%3B_Association" id="w">Farmers&#39; and Settlers&#39; Association</a> on preferences.<sup id="_ref-election archive 1919_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-election archive 1919" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a twist of fate <a href="/wiki/William_Watson_(Australian_politician)" id="w">William Watson</a>, who finished a distant fourth in this by-election with just 4.6% of the vote, was successfully elected to the House of Representatives for the <a href="/wiki/Division_of_Fremantle" id="w">Division of Fremantle</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Australian_federal_election%2C_1922" id="w">1922 election</a> on the back of preferences from Nationalist candidate William Hedges, the same man who had also contested this by-election, and who had previously been the member for Fremantle.<sup id="_ref-curtin watson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-curtin watson" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
