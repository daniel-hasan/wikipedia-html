The Chicago Area Radio Monitoring Association (CARMA) is a scanner radio listeners club based in the Chicago, Illinois, area. Over 1400 members meet via the CARMA website at http://www.carmachicago.com [http://www.carmachicago.com] or the CARMA Yahoo Groups system at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/carmachicago/ [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/carmachicago/]. The main focus is Public Safety scanner listening although many members are experts in HF and other types of monitoring. Many members are amateur radio operators, police officers, firefighters, dispatchers, public safety and EMA volunteers or others involved in public safety radio while others are private citizens with an interest in the hobby of scanner listening.

CARMA supports the hobby by collecting and distributing information about radio systems to assist scanner listeners in finding and understanding radio systems. CARMA fully supports the responsible use of scanner radios and will aggressively counter improper use of these items. CARMA has a long history of assistance to public safety agencies in tracking interference and assisting in frequency coordination.
