<p>A <b>battleship</b> is a large, heavily <a href="/wiki/Armour" id="w">armored</a> <a href="/wiki/Warship" id="w">warship</a> with a main <a href="/wiki/Artillery_battery" id="w">battery</a> consisting of the largest <a href="/wiki/Caliber" id="w">caliber</a> of <a href="/wiki/Gun" id="w">guns</a>.

<p>Battleship design continually evolved to incorporate and adapt technological advances to maintain an edge. The word <i>battleship</i> was coined around 1794 and is a shortened form of <i><a href="/wiki/Ship_of_the_line" id="w">line-of-battle ship</a></i>, the dominant warship in the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Sail" id="w">Age of Sail</a>.<sup id="_ref-OED_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OED" title="">[1]</a></sup> The term came into formal use in the late 1880s to describe a type of <a href="/wiki/Ironclad_warship" id="w">ironclad warship</a>,<sup id="_ref-Stoll_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stoll" title="">[2]</a></sup> whose design culminated in the 1890s with the generation of ships now known as <a href="/wiki/Pre-dreadnought_battleship" id="w">pre-dreadnought battleships</a>.  In 1906, <a href="/wiki/HMS_Dreadnought_(1906)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Dreadnought&#39;&#39;</a> heralded a revolution in battleship design, and for many years modern battleships were referred to as <a href="/wiki/Dreadnought" id="w">dreadnoughts</a>.</p>
<p>Battleships were a potent symbol of <a href="/wiki/Navy" id="w">naval</a> dominance and national might, and for decades, the battleship was a major factor in both <a href="/wiki/Diplomacy" id="w">diplomacy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Military_strategy" id="w">military strategy</a>.<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup>  The global <a href="/wiki/Arms_race" id="w">arms race</a> in battleship construction in the early 20th century was one of the causes of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, which saw a clash of huge battle fleets at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Jutland" id="w">Battle of Jutland</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_for_the_Limitation_of_Naval_Armament" id="w">Naval Treaties</a> of the 1920s and 1930s limited the number of battleships but did not end the evolution of design. Both the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" id="w">Allies</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Axis_Powers" id="w">Axis Powers</a> deployed battleships of old construction and new during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some historians and naval theorists question the value of the dreadnought.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Apart from Jutland, there were few great dreadnought clashes. Despite their great firepower and protection, dreadnoughts remained vulnerable to much smaller, cheaper ordnance and craft: initially the <a href="/wiki/Torpedo" id="w">torpedo</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Naval_mine" id="w">naval mine</a>, and later <a href="/wiki/Aircraft" id="w">aircraft</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Guided_missile" id="w">guided missile</a>.<sup id="_ref-Lenton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lenton" title="">[5]</a></sup> The growing range of engagement led to the battleship&#39;s replacement as the leading type of warship by the <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" id="w">aircraft carrier</a> during World War II; battleships were retained by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" id="w">United States Navy</a> into the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a> only for <a href="/wiki/Fire_support" id="w">fire support</a> purposes.

<p>A <a href="/wiki/Ship_of_the_line" id="w">ship of the line</a> was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship on which was mounted a <a href="/wiki/Artillery_battery" id="w">battery</a> of up to 120 <a href="/wiki/Smoothbore" id="w">smoothbore</a> <a href="/wiki/Gun" id="w">guns</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carronade" id="w">carronades</a>. The ship of the line was a gradual evolution of a basic design that dates back to the 1400s, and apart from growing in size it changed little between the adoption of <a href="/wiki/Line_of_battle" id="w">line of battle</a> tactics in the early 17th century and the end of the sailing battleship&#39;s heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term &#39;line of battle ship&#39; was contracted (informally at first) to &#39;battle ship&#39; or &#39;battleship&#39;.<sup id="_ref-OED_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OED" title="">[1]</a></sup>

The sheer number of guns fired <a href="/wiki/Broadside" id="w">broadside</a> meant that a sailing battleship could wreck any wooden vessel, smashing its <a href="/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)" id="w">hull</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mast_(sailing)" id="w">masts</a> and killing its crew. However, the effective range of the guns was as little as a few hundred yards, and the battle tactics of sailing ships depended entirely on the wind.</p>
<p>The first major change to the ship of the line concept was the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Steam_power" id="w">steam power</a> as an auxiliary <a href="/wiki/Marine_propulsion" id="w">propulsion system</a>. Steam power was gradually introduced to the navy in the first half of the 19th century, initially for small craft and later for <a href="/wiki/Frigate" id="w">frigates</a>.

The introduction of steam accelerated the growth in size of battleships. France and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" id="w">United Kingdom</a> were the only two countries to develop fleets of wooden steam screw battleships, although several other navies made some use of a mixture of screw battleships and paddle-steamer frigates.

The adoption of steam power was only one of a number of technological advances which revolutionized warship design in the 19th century.

<a id="Explosive_shells" name="Explosive_shells"></a><h4>Explosive shells</h4>
<p>Wooden-hulled ships stood up comparatively well to solid <a href="/wiki/Lead_shot" id="w">shot</a>, as shown in the 1866 <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Lissa_(1866)" id="w">battle of Lissa</a>, where the old Austrian steam battleship <i>Kaiser</i> ranged across a confused battlefield, rammed an <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861%E2%80%931946)" id="w">Italian</a> ironclad and took a pounding of several 300&#160;<a href="/wiki/Pound_(mass)" id="w">pound</a> shots at point blank range.

<p>By the 1890s, there was an increasing similarity between battleship designs, and the type now known as the &#39;pre-dreadnought battleship&#39; emerged. These were heavily armored ships, mounting a mixed battery of guns in turrets, and without sails. The typical first-class battleship of the pre-dreadnought era displaced 15,000 to 17,000&#160;<a href="/wiki/Ton" id="w">tons</a>, had a speed of {{convert}}, and an armament of four {{convert}} guns in two turrets fore and aft with a mixed-caliber secondary battery amidships around the superstructure.<sup id="_ref-Stoll_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stoll" title="">[2]</a></sup> An early design with superficial similarity to the pre-dreadnought is the British <a href="/wiki/Devastation_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Devastation&#39;&#39;-class</a> of 1871.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> However, it was not until the 1890s that the widespread adoption of steel construction and hardened steel armor meant that a turret-ship could combine heavy armament and protection with high speed and good seakeeping.</p>
<p>The slow-firing {{convert}} main guns were the principal weapons for battleship-to-battleship combat. The intermediate and secondary batteries had two roles. Against major ships, it was thought a &#39;hail of fire&#39; from quick-firing secondary weapons could distract enemy gun crews by inflicting damage to the superstructure, and they would be more effective against smaller ships such as <a href="/wiki/Cruiser" id="w">cruisers</a>. Smaller guns (12-pounders and smaller) were reserved for protecting the battleship against the threat of torpedo attack from <a href="/wiki/Destroyer" id="w">destroyers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Torpedo_boat" id="w">torpedo boats</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The beginning of the pre-dreadnought era coincided with an attempt by Britain to re-assert her naval dominance. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted. Expensive naval projects were criticised by political leaders of all inclinations.<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup> However, in 1888 a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain&#39;s navy should be more powerful than the two next most powerful fleets combined was also enshrined. This policy was designed to deter France and Russia from building more battleships, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with more and better pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th, the escalation in the building of battleships became defined by conflict between Britain and <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" id="w">Germany</a>. The German naval laws of 1890 and 1898 authorised a fleet of 38 battleships, a vital threat to the balance of naval power.<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup> Britain answered with further shipbuilding, but by the end of the pre-dreadnought era, British supremacy at sea had markedly weakened. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, twice as many as France and almost as many as the rest of the world put together. By 1897, Britain&#39;s lead was far smaller due to competition from France, Germany, and Russia, as well as the development of pre-dreadnought fleets in Italy, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" id="w">Japan</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, <a href="/wiki/Norway" id="w">Norway</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chile" id="w">Chile</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brazil" id="w">Brazil</a> all had second-rate fleets led by <a href="/wiki/Armored_cruiser" id="w">armored cruisers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Panzership" id="w">coast service battleships</a> or <a href="/wiki/Monitor_(warship)" id="w">monitors</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Pre-dreadnoughts continued the technical innovations of the ironclad. Turrets, armor plate, and <a href="/wiki/Steam_engine" id="w">steam engines</a> were all improved over the years, and <a href="/wiki/Torpedo" id="w">torpedo</a> tubes were introduced. A small number of designs, including the American <a href="/wiki/Kearsarge_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Kearsarge&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/Virginia_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Virginia&#39;&#39;</a> classes, experimented with all or part of the 8-inch intermediate battery superimposed over the 12-inch primary. Results were poor: recoil factors and blast effects resulted in the 8-inch battery being completely unusable, and the inability to train the primary and intermediate armaments on different targets led to significant tactical limitations. Even though such innovative designs saved weight (a key reason for their inception), they proved too cumbersome in practice.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the first years of the 20th century, several navies worldwide experimented with the idea of a new type of battleship with a uniform armament of very heavy guns.</p>
<p>General <a href="/wiki/Vittorio_Cuniberti" id="w">Vittorio Cuniberti</a>, the Italian Navy&#39;s chief naval architect, articulated the concept of an all-big-gun battleship in 1903. When the <i><a href="/wiki/Regia_Marina" id="w">Regia Marina</a></i> did not pursue his ideas, Cuniberti wrote an article in <a href="/wiki/Jane%26%2339%3Bs_Fighting_Ships" id="w">&#39;&#39;Jane&#39;s&#39;&#39;</a> proposing an &#34;ideal&#34; future British battleship, a large armored warship of 17,000&#160;tons, armed solely with a single caliber main battery (twelve 12-inch {305 mm} guns), carrying {{convert}} <a href="/wiki/Belt_armor" id="w">belt armor</a>, and capable of 24 <a href="/wiki/Knot_(speed)" id="w">knots</a> (44 km/h).<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy" id="w">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>&#39;s battleship <a href="/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Satsuma" id="w">&#39;&#39;Satsuma&#39;&#39;</a> was the first ship in the world designed (1904) and laid down (1905) as an all-big-gun battleship, although she was never armed up to specification due to shortages of the British 12-inch <a href="/wiki/Armstrong_Gun" id="w">Armstrong guns</a>. <i>Satsuma</i> retained triple-expansion engines, though her sister ship <a href="/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Aki" id="w">&#39;&#39;Aki&#39;&#39;</a>, completed in 1911, used turbines.</p>
<p>An American design, <a href="/wiki/USS_South_Carolina_(BB-26)" id="w">&#39;&#39;South Carolina&#39;&#39;</a>, authorized in 1905, also makes the claim for &#34;first dreadnought&#34;, but she and her sister, <i><a href="/wiki/USS_Michigan_(BB-27)" id="w">Michigan</a></i>, were not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines, but had superior layout of their main battery, dispensing with <i>Dreadnought</i>&#39;s wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War" id="w">Russo-Japanese War</a> (1904–1905) provided operational experience to validate the &#39;all-big-gun&#39; concept. At the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Yellow_Sea" id="w">Battle of the Yellow Sea</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Tsushima" id="w">Battle of Tsushima</a>, pre-Dreadnought fleets exchanged 12-inch volleys at ranges of 7,600–12,000 <a href="/wiki/Yard" id="w">yd</a> (7 to 11&#160;<a href="/wiki/Kilometre" id="w">km</a>), beyond the range of the secondary batteries. It is often held that these engagements demonstrated the importance of the {{convert}} gun over its smaller counterparts, though some historians take the view that secondary batteries of the pre-dreadnoughts were just as decisive as the larger weapons.<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup> None of this was lost on <a href="/wiki/First_Sea_Lord" id="w">First Sea Lord</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Fisher%2C_1st_Baron_Fisher" id="w">Sir John A. &#34;Jackie&#34; Fisher</a>. As early as 1904, Fisher had been convinced of the need for fast, powerful ships with an all-big-gun armament. If Tsushima influenced his thinking, it was to persuade him of the need to standardise on {{convert}} guns.<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup> Fisher&#39;s concern was <a href="/wiki/Submarine" id="w">submarines</a> and <a href="/wiki/Destroyer" id="w">destroyers</a> equipped with torpedoes that outranged battleship guns, making speed imperative for <a href="/wiki/Capital_ship" id="w">capital ships</a>.<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup> Fisher&#39;s preferred option was his brainchild, the <a href="/wiki/Battlecruiser" id="w">battlecruiser</a>: lightly armored but heavily armed with eight {{convert}} guns and propelled to a remarkable {{convert}} by <a href="/wiki/Steam_turbine" id="w">steam turbines</a>.

<p>It was to prove this revolutionary technology that <i>Dreadnought</i> was laid down in 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten {{convert}} guns, had an 11-inch armour belt, and was the first large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the <a href="/wiki/Wing_turrets" id="w">wings</a>, giving her at her launch twice the <a href="/wiki/Broadside" id="w">broadside</a> of anything else afloat. She retained a number of 12-pounder (3-inch/76 mm) <a href="/wiki/British_ordnance_terms#QF" id="w">quick-firing</a> guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy enough for her to go head-to-head with any other ship afloat in a gun battle, and conceivably win.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Dreadnought</i> was to have been followed by three <a href="/wiki/Invincible_class_battlecruiser" id="w">&#39;&#39;Invincible&#39;&#39;</a>-class battlecruisers, their construction delayed to allow lessons from <i>Dreadnought</i> to be used in their design. While Fisher may have intended <i>Dreadnought</i> to be the last Royal Navy battleship,<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup> the design was so successful he found little support for his plan to switch to a battlecruiser navy. Although there were some problems with the ship (the wing turrets strained the hull when firing a full broadside, and the top of the thickest armor belt lay below the waterline at full load), the Royal Navy promptly commissioned another six ships to a similar design in the <i><a href="/wiki/Bellerophon_class_battleship" id="w">Bellerophon</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/St._Vincent_class_battleship" id="w">St Vincent</a></i> classes.</p>
<a id="The_dreadnought_arms_race" name="The_dreadnought_arms_race"></a><h3>The dreadnought arms race</h3>
<p>In 1897, before the revolution in design brought about by <i>Dreadnought</i>, the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building, a lead of 26 over France and of 50 over Germany.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> In 1906, the Royal Navy now had a lead of one: <i>Dreadnought</i>. The new class of ship prompted an arms race with major strategic consequences. Major naval powers raced to build their own dreadnoughts to catch up with the United Kingdom. Possession of modern battleships was not only vital to naval power, but as with nuclear weapons today, represented a nation&#39;s standing in the world.<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup> Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Austria and the United States all began dreadnought programmes; and second-rank powers including Turkey, <a href="/wiki/Argentina" id="w">Argentina</a>, Brazil and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

<p>The First World War was an anticlimax for the great dreadnought fleets. There was no decisive clash of modern battlefleets to compare with the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Tsushima" id="w">Battle of Tsushima</a>. The role of battleships was marginal to the great land struggle in France and Russia; and it was equally marginal to the <a href="/wiki/First_Battle_of_the_Atlantic" id="w">First Battle of the Atlantic</a>, the battle between <a href="/wiki/U-boat" id="w">German submarines</a> and British merchant shipping.</p>
<p>By virtue of geography, the Royal Navy could keep the <a href="/wiki/High_Seas_Fleet" id="w">German High Seas Fleet</a> bottled up in the <a href="/wiki/North_Sea" id="w">North Sea</a> with relative ease. Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would likely result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly fields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>

<div class="thumbcaption">German <a href="/wiki/High_Seas_Fleet" id="w">High Seas Fleet</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a></div>
The first two years of war saw conflict in the North Sea limited to skirmishes by <a href="/wiki/Battlecruiser" id="w">battlecruisers</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Heligoland_Bight" id="w">Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Dogger_Bank_(1915)" id="w">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> and raids on the English coast. In the summer of 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on German terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Jutland" id="w">Battle of Jutland</a>: an indecisive engagement.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the other naval theatres there were no decisive pitched battles. In the <a href="/wiki/Black_Sea" id="w">Black Sea</a>, engagement between <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" id="w">Russian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Turkish</a> battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Sea" id="w">Baltic</a>, action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Moon_Sound" id="w">Battle of Moon Sound</a> at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The <a href="/wiki/Adriatic_Sea" id="w">Adriatic</a> was in a sense the mirror of the North Sea: the <a href="/wiki/Austria-Hungary" id="w">Austro-Hungarian</a> dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by the British and French blockade. And in the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea" id="w">Mediterranean</a>, the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Gallipoli" id="w">Gallipoli</a>.</p>
<p>The course of the war also illustrated the vulnerability of battleships to cheaper weapons. In September 1914, the potential threat posed to <a href="/wiki/Capital_ship" id="w">capital ships</a> by German U-boats was confirmed by successful attacks on British cruisers, including the sinking of three British armored cruisers by the German submarine <a href="/wiki/Unterseeboot_9_(1910)" id="w">U-9</a> in less than an hour. Sea mines proved a threat the next month, when the recently commissioned British super-dreadnought <a href="/wiki/HMS_Audacious_(1912)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Audacious&#39;&#39;</a> struck a mine. By the end of October, the British had changed their strategy and tactics in the North Sea to reduce the risk of U-boat attack.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> While Jutland was the only major clash of battleship fleets in history, the German plan for the battle relied on U-boat attacks on the British fleet; and the escape of the German fleet from the superior British firepower was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers closing on British battleships, causing them to turn away to avoid the threat of torpedo attack. Further near-misses from submarine attacks on battleships and casualties amongst cruisers led to growing paranoia in the Royal Navy about the vulnerability of battleships. By October 1916, the Royal Navy had essentially abandoned the North Sea, instructing the Grand Fleet not to go south of the <a href="/wiki/Farne_Islands" id="w">Farne Islands</a> unless adequately protected by destroyers. </p>
<p>The German High Seas Fleet, for their part, were determined not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines; and since the submarines were needed more for raiding commercial traffic, the fleet stayed in port for the remainder of the war.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Other theatres equally showed the role of small craft in damaging or destroying dreadnoughts. The two Austrian dreadnoughts lost in 1918 were the casualties of torpedo boats and of <a href="/wiki/Frogman" id="w">frogmen</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I" id="w">Allied</a> capital ships lost in Gallipoli were sunk by mines and torpedo,<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> while a Turkish pre-dreadnought was caught in the <a href="/wiki/Dardanelles" id="w">Dardanelles</a> by a British submarine.</p>
<a id="The_inter-war_period" name="The_inter-war_period"></a><h2>The inter-war period</h2>
<p>The inter-war period saw the battleship subjected to strict international limitations to prevent a costly arms race breaking out.</p>
<p>For many years, <a href="/wiki/Weimar_Republic" id="w">Germany</a> simply had no battleships. The <a href="/wiki/Armistice_with_Germany_(Compi%C3%A8gne)" id="w">Armistice with Germany</a> required that most of the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in <a href="/wiki/Scapa_Flow" id="w">Scapa Flow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" id="w">Treaty of Versailles</a> specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were <a href="/wiki/Scuttling" id="w">scuttled</a> by their German crews on <a href="/wiki/21_June" id="w">21 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1919" id="w">1919</a> just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any <a href="/wiki/Capital_ship" id="w">capital ships</a>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the victors were not limited by the Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were crippled after the war. Faced with the prospect of a naval arms race against Great Britain and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Naval_Treaty" id="w">Washington Naval Treaty</a> of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the <a href="/wiki/Geneva_Naval_Conference" id="w">First Geneva Naval Conference</a> (1927), the <a href="/wiki/London_Naval_Treaty" id="w">First London Naval Treaty</a> (1930), the <a href="/wiki/Second_Geneva_Naval_Conference" id="w">Second Geneva Naval Conference</a> (1932), and finally the <a href="/wiki/Second_London_Naval_Treaty" id="w">Second London Naval Treaty</a> (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on <a href="/wiki/1_September" id="w">1 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1939" id="w">1939</a> at the beginning of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched from 1919&#8211;1939 than from 1905&#8211;1914. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British <a href="/wiki/N3_battleship" id="w">N3 battleship</a>, the first American <a href="/wiki/South_Dakota_class_battleship_(1920)" id="w">&#39;&#39;South Dakota&#39;&#39;-class</a>, and the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Kii_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Kii&#39;&#39;-class</a>&#8212;all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor&#8212;never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as <b>treaty battleships</b>.</p>

<p>As early as 1914, the British Admiral <a href="/wiki/Percy_Scott" id="w">Percy Scott</a> predicted that battleships would soon be made irrelevant by <a href="/wiki/Military_aviation" id="w">aeroplanes</a>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> By the end of World War I, aeroplanes had successfully adopted the torpedo as a weapon.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> A proposed attack on the German fleet at anchor in 1918 using the <a href="/wiki/Sopwith_Cuckoo" id="w">Sopwith Cuckoo</a> carrier-borne torpedo-bomber was considered and rejected&#8212;but it was not long before such a technique was adopted.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, General <a href="/wiki/Billy_Mitchell" id="w">Billy Mitchell</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Corps" id="w">United States Army Air Corps</a>, believing that air forces had rendered navies around the world obsolete, testified in front of Congress that &#34;1,000 bombardment airplanes can be built and operated for about the price of one battleship&#34; and that a squadron of these bombers could sink a battleship, making for more efficient use of government funds.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell was nevertheless allowed to conduct a careful series of bombing tests alongside Navy and <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" id="w">Marine</a> bombers. In 1921, he bombed and sank numerous ships, including the &#34;unsinkable&#34; German World War I battleship <a href="/wiki/USS_Ostfriesland" id="w">&#39;&#39;Ostfriesland&#39;&#39;</a> and the American pre-dreadnought <a href="/wiki/USS_Alabama_(BB-8)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Alabama&#39;&#39;</a>.</p>
<p>Although Mitchell had required &#34;war-time conditions&#34;, the ships sunk were obsolete, stationary, defenseless and had no damage control. The sinking of <i>Ostfriesland</i> was accomplished by violating an agreement that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of various munitions: Mitchell&#39;s airmen disregarded the rules, and sank the ship within minutes in a coordinated attack. The stunt made headlines, and Mitchell declared, &#34;No surface vessels can exist wherever air forces acting from land bases are able to attack them.&#34; While far from conclusive, Mitchell&#39;s test was significant because it put proponents of the battleship against naval aviation on the back foot.<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup> Rear Admiral <a href="/wiki/William_A._Moffett" id="w">William A.

Among new features were tower height and stability such that optical rangefinder equipment for gunnery control could be used. Some British ships received a large block superstructure nicknamed the &#34;Queen Anne&#39;s castle&#34;, such as in the <i><a href="/wiki/HMS_Queen_Elizabeth_(1913)" id="w">Queen Elizabeth</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/HMS_Warspite_(03)" id="w">Warspite</a></i>, which would be used in the new conning towers of the <i><a href="/wiki/King_George_V_class_battleship_(1939)" id="w">King George V</a></i> fast battleships. The Japanese rebuilt all of their battleships, plus their battlecruisers, with distinctive &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pagoda" id="w">pagoda</a>&#34; structures, though the <i><a href="/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Hiei" id="w">Hiei</a></i> received a more modern bridge tower that would influence the new <i><a href="/wiki/Yamato_class_battleship" id="w">Yamato</a></i> battleships.

<p>Even when war threatened again in the late 1930s, battleship construction did not regain the level of importance which it had held in the years before World War I. The &#34;building holiday&#34; imposed by the naval treaties meant that the building capacity of dockyards worldwide was relatively reduced, and the strategic position had changed. The development of the <a href="/wiki/Strategic_bomber" id="w">strategic bomber</a> meant that the navy was no longer the only method of projecting power overseas, and the development of the <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" id="w">aircraft carrier</a> meant that battleships had a rival for the resources available for capital ship construction.

In <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, the ambitious <a href="/wiki/Plan_Z" id="w">Plan Z</a> for naval rearmament was abandoned in favour of a strategy of submarine warfare supplemented by the use of battlecruisers and <a href="/wiki/Bismarck_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Bismarck&#39;&#39;</a>-class battleships as commerce raiders. In Britain, the most pressing need was for air defenses and convoy escorts to safeguard the civilian population from bombing or starvation, and re-armament construction plans consisted of five ships of the <a href="/wiki/King_George_V_class_battleship_(1939)" id="w">&#39;&#39;King George V&#39;&#39;</a> class. It was in the Mediterranean that navies remained most committed to battleship warfare. France intended to build six battleships of the <a href="/wiki/Dunkerque_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Dunkerque&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/Richelieu_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Richelieu&#39;&#39;</a> classes, and the Italians two powerful <a href="/wiki/Littorio_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Littorio&#39;&#39;</a>-class ships. Neither navy built significant aircraft carriers. The U.S. preferred to spend limited funds on aircraft carriers until the <a href="/wiki/South_Dakota_class_battleship_(1939)" id="w">&#39;&#39;South Dakota&#39;&#39;</a> class. Japan, also prioritising aircraft carriers, nevertheless began work on three mammoth <a href="/wiki/Yamato_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Yamato&#39;&#39;</a> class ships (although one of these was later completed as a carrier).<sup id="_ref-Lenton_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lenton" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the outbreak of the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" id="w">Spanish Civil War</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic" id="w">Spanish</a> navy consisted of only two small dreadnought battleships, <i>España</i> and <i>Jaime I</i>. <i>España</i> (originally named <i>Alfonso XIII</i>), by then in reserve at the northwestern naval base of El Ferrol, fell into <a href="/wiki/Spain_under_Franco" id="w">Nationalist</a> hands in July 1936. The crew aboard <i>Jaime I</i> murdered their officers, mutinied, and joined the Republican Navy. Thus each side had one battleship; however, the Republican Navy generally lacked experienced officers. The Spanish battleships mainly restricted themselves to mutual blockades, convoy escort duties, and shore bombardment, rarely in direct fighting against other surface units.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> In April 1937, <i>España</i> ran onto a mine laid by friendly forces, and sank with little loss of life. In May 1937, <i>Jaime I</i> was damaged by Nationalist air attacks and a grounding incident. The ship was forced to go back to port to be repaired. There she was again hit by several aerial bombs. It was then decided to tow the battleship to a more secure port, but during the transport she suffered an internal explosion that caused 300 deaths and her total loss. Several Italian and German capital ships participated in the non-intervention blockade. On <a href="/wiki/May_29" id="w">May 29</a> <a href="/wiki/1937" id="w">1937</a>, two Republican aircraft managed to bomb the German pocket battleship <a href="/wiki/German_battleship_Deutschland" id="w">&#39;&#39;Deutschland&#39;&#39;</a> outside <a href="/wiki/Ibiza" id="w">Ibiza</a>, causing severe damage and loss of life. <a href="/wiki/German_battleship_Admiral_Scheer" id="w">&#39;&#39;Admiral Scheer&#39;&#39;</a> retaliated two days later by bombarding <a href="/wiki/Almer%C3%ADa" id="w">Almería</a>, causing much destruction, and the resulting <a href="/wiki/Deutschland_incident" id="w">&#39;&#39;Deutschland&#39;&#39; incident</a> meant the end of German and Italian support for non-intervention.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<a id="World_War_II" name="World_War_II"></a><h2>World War II</h2>
<p>German battleships&#8212;obsolete pre-dreadnoughts&#8212;fired the first shots of World War II with the bombardment of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic" id="w">Polish</a> garrison at <a href="/wiki/Westerplatte" id="w">Westerplatte</a>;<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> and the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_Instrument_of_Surrender" id="w">final surrender</a> of the Japanese Empire took place aboard a United States Navy battleship, the <a href="/wiki/USS_Missouri_(BB-63)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Missouri&#39;&#39;</a>. Between the two events, it became clear that battleships were now essentially auxiliary craft, and <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" id="w">aircraft carriers</a> were the new principal ships of the fleet.</p>
<p>Still, battleships played a part in major engagements in <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic_(1939%E2%80%931945)" id="w">Atlantic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pacific_War" id="w">Pacific</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Mediterranean" id="w">Mediterranean theatres</a>. In the Atlantic, the Germans experimented with taking the battleship beyond conventional fleet action, using their pocket battleships as independent commerce raiders. Although there were a few battleship-on-battleship engagements, battleships had little impact on the destroyer and submarine <a href="/wiki/Second_Battle_of_the_Atlantic" id="w">Battle of the Atlantic</a>, and aircraft carriers determined the outcome of most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific War.</p>
<p>In the first year of the war, battleships and battlecruisers defied predictions that aircraft would dominate naval warfare. <a href="/wiki/German_battlecruiser_Scharnhorst" id="w">&#39;&#39;Scharnhorst&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/German_battlecruiser_Gneisenau" id="w">&#39;&#39;Gneisenau&#39;&#39;</a> surprised and sank the aircraft carrier <a href="/wiki/HMS_Glorious" id="w">&#39;&#39;Glorious&#39;&#39;</a> off western <a href="/wiki/Norway" id="w">Norway</a> in June 1940.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> The vulnerability of unescorted carriers to attack by other ships meant that carriers almost always had escorts, so this engagement marked the last time surface gunnery sank a fleet carrier. In the <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir" id="w">Attack on Mers-el-Kébir</a>, British capital ships opened fire on the French battleships harboured in <a href="/wiki/Algeria" id="w">Algeria</a> with their own heavy guns, and later pursued fleeing French ships with planes from aircraft carriers.</p>

In late 1940 and 1941, a range of engagements saw battleships harassed by carrier aircraft.</p>
<p>The first example of the power of naval aviation was the British air attack on the Italian naval base at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Taranto" id="w">Taranto</a> that took place on the night of 11&#8211;12 November 1940. A small number of Royal Navy aircraft attacked the Italian fleet at harbour, succeeding in sinking one Italian battleship and damaging two others. Importantly, the attack forced the Italian navy to change tactics and seek battle against the superior British navy, which resulted in their defeat at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_Matapan" id="w">Battle of Cape Matapan</a>.</p>
<a id="Bismarck" name="Bismarck"></a><h3>Bismarck</h3>
<p>{{main}}
The battleship war in the Atlantic was driven by the attempts of German capital ship <a href="/wiki/Commerce_raider" id="w">commerce raiders</a>&#8212;two battleships, the <a href="/wiki/German_battleship_Bismarck" id="w">&#39;&#39;Bismarck&#39;&#39;</a> and the <a href="/wiki/German_battleship_Tirpitz" id="w">&#39;&#39;Tirpitz&#39;&#39;</a>, and two battlecruisers&#8212;to influence the <a href="/wiki/Second_Battle_of_the_Atlantic" id="w">Battle of the Atlantic</a> by destroying Atlantic <a href="/wiki/Convoy" id="w">convoys</a> supplying the United Kingdom. The superior numbers of British surface units devoted themselves to protecting the convoys, and to seek-and-destroy missions against the German ships, assisted by both naval and land-based aircraft and by sabotage attacks. On <a href="/wiki/24_May" id="w">24 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, during its attempt to break out into the North Atlantic, the commerce raider <a href="/wiki/German_battleship_Bismarck" id="w">&#39;&#39;Bismarck&#39;&#39;</a> engaged the British battleship HMS <a href="/wiki/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_(53)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Prince of Wales&#39;&#39;</a> and the battlecruiser <a href="/wiki/HMS_Hood_(51)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Hood&#39;&#39;</a>. Due primarily to the <i>Bismarck</i>&#39;s superior range-finding and accuracy, it soon sank <i>Hood</i> with a hit to her magazines. <i>Bismarck</i> and <i>Prince of Wales</i> hit each other three times, the damage compelling the German battleship to withdraw.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup>  While the <i>Bismarck</i> was heading for home, the Royal Navy continued to hunt it, and eventually an attack by <a href="/wiki/Fairey_Swordfish" id="w">Swordfish</a> <a href="/wiki/Biplane" id="w">biplane</a> torpedo-bombers from the aircraft carrier <a href="/wiki/HMS_Ark_Royal_(91)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Ark Royal&#39;&#39;</a> disabled <i>Bismarck&#39;s</i> rudder.

In many of the crucial battles of the Pacific, for instance <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Coral_Sea" id="w">Coral Sea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Midway" id="w">Midway</a>, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. The primary tasks for battleships in the Pacific became shore bombardment and anti-aircraft defense for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan&#39;s <i>Yamato</i> class, which carried a main battery of nine 18.1-<a href="/wiki/Inch" id="w">inch</a> (460 <a href="/wiki/Millimetre" id="w">millimetre</a>) guns and were designed to be a principal strategic weapon, were seldom given a chance to fulfill their potential. They were hampered by technical deficiencies (slow battleships were incapable of operating with fast carriers), faulty military <a href="/wiki/Doctrine" id="w">doctrine</a> (the Japanese waited for a &#34;decisive battle&#34;, which never came), and defective dispositions (as at Midway).</p>
<a id="Pearl_Harbor" name="Pearl_Harbor"></a><h4>Pearl Harbor</h4>
<p>Before hostilities broke out in the Pacific Theatre, extensive pre-war planning centered around dreadnoughts. The <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" id="w">Royal Navy</a> could not achieve parity with the estimated nine Japanese <a href="/wiki/Capital_ship" id="w">capital ships</a> in Southeast Asia, since doing so would leave only a handful of ships to use against Nazi Germany. However, Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" id="w">Winston Churchill</a> was optimistic about the improving situation in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean and <a href="/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse" id="w">allocating two ships</a> to the defense of <a href="/wiki/Singapore_in_the_Straits_Settlements" id="w">Singapore</a> was seen as a compromise. Furthermore, the U.S. Navy later agreed to send its <a href="/wiki/United_States_Pacific_Fleet" id="w">Pacific Fleet</a> with its eight battleships to Singapore in the event of hostilities with Japan.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/7_December" id="w">7 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a> the Japanese launched a surprise <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" id="w">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. Five out of eight U.S. battleships were quickly either sunk or sinking, with the rest damaged. The Japanese thus neutralized the U.S. battleship force in the Pacific by an air attack, and thereby proved Mitchell&#39;s theory, and showed the vulnerability of warships lying at anchor, as at Taranto. The American aircraft carriers were however at sea and evaded detection. They in turn took up the fight, eventually turning the tide of the war in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse" id="w">sinking of the British battleship &#39;&#39;Prince of Wales&#39;&#39;</a> and her escort, the battlecruiser HMS <i>Repulse</i>, further demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack, in this case while at sea without air cover. Both ships were on their way to assist in the defense of Singapore when Japanese land-based <a href="/wiki/Bomber" id="w">bombers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fighter_aircraft" id="w">fighters</a> found and sank them on <a href="/wiki/10_December" id="w">10 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>. <i>Prince of Wales</i> has the distinction of being the first modern battleship sunk by aircraft while underway and able to defend herself.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Midway" name="Midway"></a><h4>Midway</h4>
<p>Commonly understood as a victory of carriers, <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Midway" id="w">Midway</a> showed up deficiencies in Japanese operational planning. <a href="/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto" id="w">Yamamoto</a>, considering them his most valuable units, kept his battleships far to the rear, in line with traditional practice. This placed them too far away to assist <a href="/wiki/Chuichi_Nagumo" id="w">Nagumo</a> (and they would have been too slow to keep up with him in any case). Yet, when Nagumo&#39;s carriers were sunk, Yamamoto lost an opportunity to salvage something. Carriers, for all their evident potency, were virtually defenseless at night, and <a href="/wiki/Frank_Jack_Fletcher" id="w">Fletcher</a> might have been dealt a crushing blow by <a href="/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Yamato" id="w">&#39;&#39;Yamato&#39;&#39;</a> the night of 6–<a href="/wiki/7_June" id="w">7 June</a>, had Yamamoto stayed closer.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Guadalcanal" name="Guadalcanal"></a><h4>Guadalcanal</h4>
<p>Initially, when the U.S. entered the war in December 1941, it had no battleships available in the Pacific Theatre. Eight of them were sunk or crippled at Pearl Harbor and were sent home for repairs and reconstruction; they would not have been able to keep up with the carriers in any case. The new <a href="/wiki/Fast_battleship" id="w">fast battleships</a> of <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;North Carolina&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_Dakota_class_battleship_(1939)" id="w">&#39;&#39;South Dakota&#39;&#39;</a> classes were still undergoing trials. <i>North Carolina</i> and <i>South Dakota</i> were ready by summer of 1942 and provided crucial anti-aircraft defense during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Solomons" id="w">Eastern Solomons</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Santa_Cruz_Islands" id="w">Santa Cruz Islands</a> carrier battles.</p>

<p>By contrast, the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy" id="w">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> had the advantage of a dozen operational battleships early in the war, but chose not to deploy them in any significant engagements. The <a href="/wiki/Fuso_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Fusō&#39;&#39;s</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ise_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Ise&#39;&#39;s</a>, despite their extensive modernization and respectable speeds, were relegated to training and home defense, while the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Nagato" id="w">&#39;&#39;Nagato&#39;&#39;s</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yamato_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Yamato&#39;&#39;s</a> were being saved for <a href="/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto" id="w">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Thayer_Mahan" id="w">&#34;Decisive Battle&#34;</a> which never came to fruition on Japanese terms. In fact, the only Japanese battleships to see much action in the early stages were <a href="/wiki/Kong%C5%8D_class_battlecruiser" id="w">&#39;&#39;Kongō&#39;&#39;s</a>, which served mostly as carrier escorts due to their high speed.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the later part of the <a href="/wiki/Guadalcanal_campaign" id="w">Guadalcanal campaign</a> in fall 1942, Japan and the U.S. were both forced to commit their battleships to surface combat, due to the need to carry out night operations, and because of the exhaustion of their carrier forces.

Several USN ships were lost and others were crippled, but they inflicted critical damage on <i>Hiei</i>, which was abandoned after being subject to repeated air attacks that made salvage impossible. The following evening, at the <a href="/wiki/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal" id="w">Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a> on <a href="/wiki/15_November" id="w">15 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>, the United States battleships <a href="/wiki/USS_South_Dakota_(BB-57)" id="w">&#39;&#39;South Dakota&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/USS_Washington_(BB-56)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Washington&#39;&#39;</a> fought and destroyed the surviving <i>Kirishima</i>.</p>

At the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Philippine_Sea" id="w">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a>, heavy aircraft losses made the carriers ineffectual and forced the Japanese to finally commit their dreadnoughts, both old and new, to the upcoming <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf" id="w">Leyte Campaign</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse" id="w">sinking of &#39;&#39;Prince of Wales&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Repulse&#39;&#39;</a> off the coast of <a href="/wiki/British_Malaya" id="w">Malaya</a> in 1941 demonstrated that even the most modern battleships could not hold off aerial attacks without decent aerial defenses. The British <a href="/wiki/HACS" id="w">HACS</a> fire control system had proven useless against the Japanese attackers, and the <a href="/wiki/Anti-aircraft_artillery" id="w">anti-aircraft artillery</a> had managed to shoot down only a handful of attackers. Afterwards, an aircraft carrier&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Combat_air_patrol" id="w">combat air patrol</a> proved to be the most effective form of defense against enemy bombers; nonetheless a modern <a href="/wiki/Fast_battleship" id="w">fast battleship</a> could provide a vital point defense against attackers that broke through the fighter screen. The <i>North Carolina</i> and <i>South Dakota</i> demonstrated just that in the battles of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Solomons" id="w">Eastern Solomons</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Santa_Cruz_Islands" id="w">Santa Cruz Islands</a>, respectively, with <i>North Carolina</i> downing between 7 and 14 planes, while <i>South Dakota</i> shot down between 26 and 32. The battleships&#39; presence was crucial during these 1942 battles, as the U.S. were still months from being able to realize their material advantage, with too few planes and ships to interdict enough of the skilled Japanese pilots. No American battleships were lost or seriously damaged by aerial attacks in open seas in the World War II.</p>
<p>By 1944, Admiral <a href="/wiki/Raymond_A._Spruance" id="w">Raymond A. Spruance</a> had arrayed his forces. The first line of defense was a radar-vectored <a href="/wiki/Combat_air_patrol" id="w">combat air patrol</a>, and any attackers who managed to get through would face anti-aircraft fire from a line of screening battleships and cruisers. This exacted such a heavy toll on the Japanese during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Philippine_Sea#Japanese raids: The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot" id="w">Battle of the Philippine Sea</a> that they failed to cause any significant damage to their targets, the aircraft carriers.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> Circumstances were vastly different from 1942 as the Japanese aircrews were inexperienced, and they were up against veteran U.S. pilots as well as many new carriers and battleships.</p>
<a id="AA_guns" name="AA_guns"></a><h4>AA guns</h4>
<p>At the outbreak of World War II, most battleships had large anti-aircraft batteries. The battleships used the same light AA guns (the Allies used autocannons such as the <a href="/wiki/Bofors_40_mm_gun" id="w">Bofors 40 mm gun</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oerlikon_20_mm_cannon" id="w">Oerlikon 20 mm cannon</a>) as those on smaller ships, but in greater number. The later development of <a href="/wiki/Proximity_fuse" id="w">proximity fuses</a> and <a href="/wiki/Radar" id="w">radar</a> vastly increased the effectiveness of these batteries. </p>
<p>Post-WWI battleships, particularly British and American, had discarded the <a href="/wiki/Casemate" id="w">casemates</a> in favour of turret-mounted dual purpose secondary batteries (<a href="/wiki/5%26quot%3B/38_caliber_gun" id="w">5-inch</a> or 6-inch caliber). Secondaries were initially designed to deal with rushing destroyers and torpedo boats, but there arose a need for heavy anti-aircraft armament as the potency of aircraft grew, particularly torpedo planes. The rationale was that it is unlikely that a battleship would be simultaneously facing both destroyers and aircraft, but it would take up too much space to have separate types of guns to deal with both threats. Both weapons had similar calibers and so they could be merged into a single battery type, and the turret mountings were less susceptible to flooding and had a better firing arc than casemates. The space saved from combining the two types of guns added to simplification of supply, increased deck armour coverage, stowage of other equipment, more light anti-aircraft batteries, and other needs. </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Nelson_class_battleship" id="w">Nelson class battleship</a>, incorporating many concepts from the <a href="/wiki/G3_battlecruiser" id="w">G3 battlecruiser</a>, was the first design to include a dual-purpose secondary battery, useful against both surface and airborne attacks. Compared to light AA they had a slower rate of fire, but they had a greater range and sufficient punch to knock enemy planes out of the sky. This proved a crucial defense against Japanese <a href="/wiki/Kamikaze" id="w">kamikazes</a> in the latter years of WWII. They could also fire into the sea to create waterspouts that slapped low-flying torpedo planes with tonnes of water. Battleships could mount many more of these DP batteries than cruisers or carriers.</p>
<p>German vessels such as the <i>Bismarck</i> class possessed dedicated secondary anti-ship batteries as well as dedicated heavy anti-aircraft batteries, rather than adopting the dual-purpose secondaries like the British or Americans. <i>Bismarck</i> for instance had a battery of twelve 5.9&#160;inch (150&#160;mm) cannon and another sixteen 4.1&#160;inch (105&#160;mm) battery was mounted to deal with air threats. The cannon could be used against ships only, as they could not be elevated to fire on high-level targets. This tended to complicate ammunition supplies, take up more space, and reduce the numbers of both guns (reducing the anti-ship <i>or</i> anti-aircraft broadside). The <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy" id="w">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> suffered similar problems to the Germans&#39;, as their secondaries were too slow to track aircraft.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Japanese even used the &#34;San Shiki&#34; (the Beehive) Model 13 anti-aircraft shell for the main gun armament of the <a href="/wiki/Yamato_class_battleship" id="w">Yamato class battleships</a>, which would have in theory functioned as a super-sized &#34;shotgun&#34;, though this was not considered a success.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Armour" name="Armour"></a><h4>Armour</h4>
<p>In the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Jutland" id="w">Battle of Jutland</a> and post-WWI era, designers began drawing up <a href="/wiki/Vehicle_armour" id="w">armour</a> schemes that protected against ordnance dropped by aircraft or submarines. The five ships of the American <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Tennessee&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/Colorado_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Colorado&#39;&#39;</a> classes had considerably improved underwater hull protection over previous battleships, as the result of extensive experimentation and testing. The proposed <a href="/wiki/G3_battlecruiser" id="w">G3 battlecruiser</a> was planned to incorporate a thoroughly tested <a href="/wiki/Torpedo_belt" id="w">torpedo defense scheme</a>, which was later used in the <i>Nelson</i>-class. Not surprisingly, as many WWI battleships lacked such a protection system, they fared poorly against torpedoes, which in WWII were increasingly being delivered by submarines and aircraft.</p>
<p>Battleships had an <a href="/wiki/Torpedo_belt" id="w">armoured belt</a> for underwater protection against torpedoes or shells which hit below the waterline. From the lessons of Jutland, the protection scheme incorporated a sophisticated torpedo defense system (TDS).<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> By adopting a turbo-electric drive, this allowed a wholesale rearrangement and fine subdivision of the machinery spaces, while simultaneously narrowing them and permitting more space outboard for a layered system of voids, liquid-filled tanks and thin armored bulkheads.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> By contrast, &#34;thin-skinned&#34; cruisers and carriers relied only on numerous compartments to prevent flooding from spreading. Some were upgraded with <a href="/wiki/Anti-torpedo_bulge" id="w">anti-torpedo blisters</a>, though these were much inferior to the battleship&#39;s armoured belt. During <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" id="w">Pearl Harbor</a>, TDS and damage control counterflooding saved <a href="/wiki/USS_West_Virginia_(BB-48)#7 December 1941" id="w">&#39;&#39;West Virginia&#39;&#39;</a> from nine torpedo hits, while <a href="/wiki/USS_Oklahoma_(BB-37)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Oklahoma&#39;&#39;</a>, which lacked it, capsized after just three.</p>
<p>During the attack on <a href="/wiki/IJN_Yamato" id="w">&#39;&#39;Yamato&#39;&#39;</a>, according to a <a href="/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service" id="w">PBS documentary</a>, U.S. torpedo bombers were taught to aim for either the bow or the stern, where the protective belt did not extend. In order for torpedo planes to make their runs successfully, it was the job of fighters to strafe the battleship to suppress the AA guns, and for dive bombers to wreak havoc on the upper decks, destroying AA weapons and fire control systems. Pilots were also instructed to focus on one side of the ship, causing massive flooding which was difficult to counteract, leading to the ship capsizing. A bow hit was deadly, since the onrushing water from the battleship&#39;s high speed could wrench the hole open wider and collapse compartment bulkheads, which was why <i>Yamato</i>&#39;s sister, <a href="/wiki/IJN_Musashi" id="w">&#39;&#39;Musashi&#39;&#39;</a>, foundered at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf#Sibuyan Sea" id="w">Sibuyan Sea</a>.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> The stern attacks are best demonstrated by the cases of <i>Bismarck</i> and <i>Prince of Wales</i>; the rudders and screws were similarly vulnerable.</p>
<p>As the armour decks of battleships were also of sufficient thickness, the <a href="/wiki/Fleet_Air_Arm" id="w">Fleet Air Arm</a> planned to release their armour-piercing bombs from a certain height in order to penetrate <i>Tirpitz</i>&#39;s armor during <a href="/wiki/Operation_Tungsten" id="w">Operation Tungsten</a>.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> As the British pilots did not release their ordnance from the optimal altitude, <i>Tirpitz</i> suffered extensive damage to her upperworks but her deck armor remained intact.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> While the <a href="/wiki/Suicide_attacks" id="w">suicide air attacks</a>&#8212;the so-called kamikaze&#8212;struck many U.S. battleships, none were seriously damaged due to their thick armor. <i>Kamikaze</i> were much more successful against lesser-armored ships.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>There were limits to the battleship&#39;s protection scheme, since it could not keep pace with the quicker developments in ordnance. For instance, the TDS in the <a href="/wiki/South_Dakota_class_battleship_(1939)" id="w">&#39;&#39;South Dakota&#39;&#39;</a> and <i>Iowa</i> battleships were designed to absorb the energy from an underwater explosion equivalent to 700 pounds (317 kg) of <a href="/wiki/Trinitrotoluene" id="w">TNT</a> &#8212; the Navy&#39;s best guess in the 1930s about Japanese weapons. But unbeknownst to U.S. Naval Intelligence, the Japanese 24-inch (60 cm) <a href="/wiki/Type_93_torpedo" id="w">Type 93 torpedo</a>, carried a charge equivalent to 891 pounds (405 kg) of TNT. And no amount of armour that could be practically incorporated would have saved the <a href="/wiki/German_battleship_Tirpitz" id="w">&#39;&#39;Tirpitz&#39;&#39;</a> from the massive 12,000 lb (5.4t) <a href="/wiki/Tallboy_bomb" id="w">Tallboys</a> dropped by RAF Lancaster bombers during <a href="/wiki/German_battleship_Tirpitz#Operations Paravane.2C Obviate and Catechism" id="w">Operation Catechism</a>.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Coordination_and_waves" name="Coordination_and_waves"></a><h4>Coordination and waves</h4>
<p>In a well-planned attack, fighter planes strafed the battleship to suppress the AA guns, while dive bombers used their armour-piercing bombs to cause topside damage and havoc. The fighters and dive bombers, however, were diversions in order to allow the torpedo planes to deliver their ordnance.</p>
<p>Battleships were able to sustain more punishment and had fewer vulnerable spots than cruisers and carriers, so it was difficult to rely upon scoring a critical hit (the cases of the <i>Bismarck</i> and <i>Prince of Wales</i> are considered exceptional). Instead, the way to defeat battleships was by attrition, inflicted accumulating damage, by overwhelming them with repeated waves of attacks. This is best demonstrated at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf" id="w">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>; at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf#Battle of the Sibuyan Sea" id="w">Sibuyan Sea</a> where the super-dreadnought <i><a href="/wiki/IJN_Musashi" id="w">Musashi</a></i> eventually succumbed to her damage, after being beset by waves of U.S. carrier aircraft and with her being the primary focus of their attacks. The U.S. planes would have accomplished less if they spread out to attack the rest of the ships in Kurita&#39;s powerful force. By contrast, the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf#Battle of Surigao Strait" id="w">October 24 air attack</a> on Nishimura&#39;s southern pincer did little damage, even though both of his <a href="/wiki/Fuso_class_battleship" id="w">battleships</a> were slow WWI-era dreadnoughts and his force had far fewer screening ships, as he only faced a single wave from U.S. carriers <i><a href="/wiki/USS_Franklin_(CV-13)" id="w">Franklin</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(CV-6)" id="w">Enterprise</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Innovative_Attacks" name="Innovative_Attacks"></a><h4>Innovative Attacks</h4>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Axis_Powers" id="w">Axis Powers</a> implemented some unconventional methods. The Italians used with success their tested method of having <a href="/wiki/Frogman" id="w">frogmen</a> delivering explosive charges to the ships, and managed to sink <a href="/wiki/HMS_Valiant_(1914)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Valiant&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/HMS_Queen_Elizabeth_(1913)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Queen Elizabeth&#39;&#39;</a> in the shallow waters of the harbor of <a href="/wiki/Alexandria" id="w">Alexandria</a>, putting them out of action until 1942. Other more or less successful Italian methods included <a href="/wiki/Human_torpedo" id="w">manned torpedoes</a> and small <a href="/wiki/MTM" id="w">motor assault boats</a>, which were filled with explosives, aimed at the target, sped up to full speed, while the pilot catapulted himself out from the dashing craft.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Germans developed a series of stand-off weapons, <i>e.g.</i> the <a href="/wiki/Precision-guided_munition" id="w">guided bomb</a> <a href="/wiki/Fritz_X" id="w">Fritz X</a>, which scored some early successes. On <a href="/wiki/9_September" id="w">9 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a>, the Germans managed to sink the Italian battleship <a href="/wiki/Italian_battleship_Roma_(1940)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Roma&#39;&#39;</a> and severely damage her sister ship, the <a href="/wiki/Italian_battleship_Littorio" id="w">&#39;&#39;Italia&#39;&#39;</a>, while they were underway to surrender. The first one hit <i>Roma</i> amidship between 90 mm AA gun mounts, piercing deck and side, then exploded, halving her speed; the other one hit above deck between turret #2 and the conning tower. It caused an explosion that threw the turret outboard and affected the boilers, starting a major fire that detonated the main magazines. 1353 lives were lost; only 596 survivors, most badly burned, were rescued. Among those killed was the Italian Commander in Chief of Naval Battle Forces, <a href="/wiki/Carlo_Bergamini_(admiral)" id="w">Admiral Carlo Bergamini</a>. One week later, the Germans scored another hit with a Fritz X on the British battleship <a href="/wiki/HMS_Warspite_(1913)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Warspite&#39;&#39;</a>. The bomb penetrated six decks before exploding against the bottom of the ship, blowing a large hole in her. The ship took in a total of 5,000 tonnes of water, lost steam (and thus all power, both to the ship herself and to all her systems), and had to be taken in tow. She reached Malta but was out of action for the next 12 months.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The British further developed their ability to sink battleships in harbour with minisubs and very heavy bombs dropped by strategic bombers. The last active German battleship, <a href="/wiki/German_battleship_Tirpitz" id="w">&#39;&#39;Tirpitz&#39;&#39;</a>, lurked until late into the war in Norwegian <a href="/wiki/Fjord" id="w">fjords</a> protected by <a href="/wiki/Anti-submarine_weapon" id="w">anti-submarine weapons</a> and shore based anti-aircraft guns. She was severely damaged in September 1943 during <a href="/wiki/Operation_Source" id="w">Operation Source</a>, a daring covert attack by <a href="/wiki/X_class_submarine" id="w">British mini-subs</a>. After several air strikes, including <a href="/wiki/Operation_Tungsten" id="w">Operation Tungsten</a> which was made with carrier aircraft, <i>Tirpitz</i> was finally sunk in harbour by <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" id="w">RAF</a> heavy bombers carrying massive <a href="/wiki/Tallboy_bomb" id="w">tallboy bombs</a>. During that action, codenamed <a href="/wiki/German_battleship_Tirpitz#Operations Paravane.2C Obviate and Catechism" id="w">Operation Catechism</a>, two of the bombs penetrated her armour, one holing her portside and the other starting a fire that eventually detonated her magazines and blew off her Caesar turret, causing her to capsize and killing 1000 of the 1700 men aboard.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>

<p>After World War II, several navies retained battleships, but it became clear that they were not worth the considerable cost. During the war it had become clear that battleship-on-battleship engagements like Leyte Gulf or the sinking of the <i>Hood</i> were the exception and not the rule, and that engagement ranges were becoming longer and longer, making heavy gun armament irrelevant. The armor of a battleship was equally irrelevant in the face of a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_warfare" id="w">nuclear attack</a>, and nuclear missiles with a range of {{convert}}or more could be mounted on the Soviet <a href="/wiki/Kildin_class_destroyer" id="w">&#39;&#39;Kildin&#39;&#39; class destroyer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Whiskey_class_submarine" id="w">&#39;&#39;Whiskey&#39;&#39; class submarine</a> by the end of the 1950s.</p> 
<p>The remaining battleships met a variety of ends. <a href="/wiki/USS_Arkansas_(BB-33)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Arkansas&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Nagato" id="w">&#39;&#39;Nagato&#39;&#39;</a> were sunk during the testing of nuclear weapons in <a href="/wiki/Operation_Crossroads" id="w">Operation Crossroads</a> in 1946. Both battleships proved resistant to nuclear air burst but vulnerable to underwater nuclear explosions. The Italian <a href="/wiki/Italian_battleship_Giulio_Cesare" id="w">&#39;&#39;Giulio Cesare&#39;&#39;</a> was taken by the Soviets as reparations and renamed <i>Novorossiysk</i>; it was sunk by a German mine in the <a href="/wiki/Black_Sea" id="w">Black Sea</a> on <a href="/wiki/29_October" id="w">29 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1955" id="w">1955</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Iowa_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Iowa&#39;&#39; class battleships</a> gained a new lease of life in the U.S. Navy as fire support ships.

On several occasions, battleships were support ships in <a href="/wiki/Carrier_battle_group" id="w">carrier battle groups</a>, or led their own battle groups in a <a href="/wiki/Battleship_battle_group" id="w">battleship battle group</a>. These were modernized to carry <a href="/wiki/Tomahawk_missile" id="w">Tomahawk missiles</a>, with <i>New Jersey</i> seeing action bombarding <a href="/wiki/Lebanon" id="w">Lebanon</a> in 1983 and 1984, while <a href="/wiki/USS_Missouri_(BB-63)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Missouri&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/USS_Wisconsin_(BB-64)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Wisconsin&#39;&#39;</a> fired their 16&#160;inch (406&#160;mm) guns at land targets and launched missiles in the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_War" id="w">Gulf War</a> of 1991. <i>Wisconsin</i> served as the <a href="/wiki/Tomahawk_missile" id="w">TLAM</a> strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of <a href="/wiki/Operation_Desert_Storm" id="w">Operation Desert Storm</a> and fired a total of 24 TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. This will most likely be the last combat action ever by a battleship. The primary threat to the battleships were Iraqi shore based surface-to-surface missiles; <i>Missouri</i> was targeted by two <a href="/wiki/Iraq" id="w">Iraqi</a> <a href="/wiki/Silkworm_missile" id="w">Silkworm missiles</a>, with one missing and another being intercepted by the British destroyer <a href="/wiki/HMS_Gloucester_(D96)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Gloucester&#39;&#39;</a>.</p>
<p>All four <i>Iowas</i> were decommissioned in the early 1990s, making them the last battleships to see active service.

<a id="Battleships_in_strategy_and_doctrine" name="Battleships_in_strategy_and_doctrine"></a><h2>Battleships in strategy and doctrine</h2>
<a id="Doctrine" name="Doctrine"></a><h3>Doctrine</h3>
<p>Battleships were the embodiment of <a href="/wiki/Sea_power" id="w">sea power</a>. For <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Thayer_Mahan" id="w">Alfred Thayer Mahan</a> and his followers, a strong navy was vital to the success of a nation, and control of the seas was vital for the projection of force on land and overseas. Mahan&#39;s theory dictated that the role of the battleship was to sweep the enemy from the seas.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> While the work of escorting, <a href="/wiki/Blockade" id="w">blockading</a> and raiding might be done by <a href="/wiki/Cruiser" id="w">cruisers</a> or smaller vessels, the presence of the battleship was a potential threat. (This came to be known as a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Fleet_in_being" id="w">fleet in being</a>&#34;.) Mahan went on to say victory could only be achieved by engagements between battleships<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> (which came to be known as the &#34;decisive battle&#34; doctrine in <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy" id="w">some navies</a>), while <i><a href="/wiki/Guerre_de_course" id="w">guerre de course</a></i> (developed by the <i><a href="/wiki/Jeune_Ecole" id="w">Jeune Ecole</a></i>) could never succeed.</p>
<p>Mahan was highly influential in naval and political circles throughout the age of the battleship,<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup> and it called for a large fleet of the most powerful battleships possible. Mahan&#39;s work developed in the late 1880s, and by the end of the 1890s it had a massive international impact,<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup> in the end adopted by many major navies (notably the British, American, German, and Japanese). The strength of Mahanian opinion was important in the development of the battleships arms races, and equally important in the agreement of the Powers to limit battleship numbers in the interwar era.</p>
<p>A related concept was a &#34;fleet in being&#34;: the idea a fleet of battleships could simply by its presence tie down superior enemy resources. This in turn was believed to be able to tip the balance of a conflict even without a decisive battle. This suggested even for inferior naval powers a battleship fleet could have important strategic impact.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Tactics" name="Tactics"></a><h3>Tactics</h3>
<p>While the role of battleships in both World Wars reflected Mahanian doctrine, the details of battleship deployment were more complex. Unlike the <a href="/wiki/Ship-of-the-line" id="w">ship-of-the-line</a>, the battleships of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had significant vulnerability to torpedoes and mines, weapons which could be used by relatively small and inexpensive craft. The <a href="/wiki/Jeune_Ecole" id="w">Jeune Ecole</a> school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s recommended the placing of <a href="/wiki/Torpedo_boat" id="w">torpedo boats</a> alongside battleships; the boats would hide behind the battleships until gun-smoke obscured visibility enough for them to dart out and fire their torpedoes.<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup> While this concept was vitiated by the development of smokeless propellant, the threat from more capable torpedo craft (later including submarines) remained. By the 1890s the Royal Navy had developed the first <a href="/wiki/Destroyer" id="w">destroyers</a>, small ships designed to intercept and drive off any attacking torpedo boats. During the First World War and subsequently, battleships were rarely deployed without a protective screen of destroyers.</p>
<p>Battleship doctrine emphasised the concentration of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force to be able to bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, <a href="/wiki/Airship" id="w">airships</a>, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of <a href="/wiki/Radio" id="w">radio</a>, <a href="/wiki/Direction_finding" id="w">direction finding</a> and <a href="/wiki/Traffic_analysis" id="w">traffic analysis</a> would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup>) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques,<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.</p>
<a id="Strategic_and_diplomatic_impact" name="Strategic_and_diplomatic_impact"></a><h3>Strategic and diplomatic impact</h3>
<p>The presence of battleships had a great psychological and diplomatic impact. Similar to possessing <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" id="w">nuclear weapons</a> today, the ownership of battleships made a country count for something.<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even during the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a>, the psychological impact of a battleship was significant. In 1946, USS <i>Missouri</i> was dispatched to deliver the remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greek</a> waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the <a href="/wiki/Balkans" id="w">Balkan</a> region.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> In September 1983, when <a href="/wiki/Druze" id="w">Druze</a> militia in <a href="/wiki/Lebanon" id="w">Lebanon</a>&#39;s Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS <i>New Jersey</i> stopped the firing. Gunfire from <i>New Jersey</i> later killed militia leaders.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Value_for_money" name="Value_for_money"></a><h3>Value for money</h3>
<p>Battleships were the largest and most complex, and hence the most expensive warships of their time; as a result, the value of investment in battleships has always been contested. As the French politician Etienne Lamy wrote in 1879, <i>The construction of battleships is so costly, their effectiveness so uncertain and of such short duration, that the enterprise of creating an armored fleet seems to leave fruitless the perseverance of a people</i>.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> The <i><a href="/wiki/Jeune_Ecole" id="w">Jeune Ecole</a></i> school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s sought alternatives to the crippling expense and debatable utility of a conventional battlefleet. It proposed what would nowadays be termed a <a href="/wiki/Sea_denial" id="w">sea denial</a> strategy, based on fast, long-ranged cruisers for commerce raiding and torpedo boat flotillas to attack enemy ships attempting to blockade French ports. The ideas of the <i>Jeune Ecole</i> were ahead of their time; it was not until the 20th century that efficient mines, torpedoes, submarines, and aircraft were available that allowed similar ideas to be effectively implemented.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup></p>
<p>The determination of powers such as the <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" id="w">German Empire</a> to build battlefleets with which to confront much stronger rivals has been criticised by historians, who emphasise the futility of investment in a battlefleet which has no chance of matching its opponent in an actual battle.<sup id="_ref-Sondhaus_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sondhaus" title="">[3]</a></sup> According to this view, attempts by a weaker navy to compete head-to-head with a stronger one in battleship construction simply wasted resources which could have been better invested in attacking the enemy&#39;s points of weakness. In Germany&#39;s case, the British dependence on massive imports of food and raw materials proved to be a near-fatal weakness, once Germany had accepted the political risk of <a href="/wiki/Unrestricted_submarine_warfare" id="w">unrestricted submarine warfare</a> against commercial shipping. Although the U-boat offensive in 1917–18 was ultimately defeated, it was successful in causing huge material loss and forcing the Allies to divert vast resources into <a href="/wiki/Anti-submarine_warfare" id="w">anti-submarine warfare</a>. This success, though not ultimately decisive, was nevertheless in sharp contrast to the inability of the German battlefleet to challenge the supremacy of Britain&#39;s far stronger fleet.</p>
<p>The problem for a maritime nation that does not maintain a balanced fleet, with at least some ability to contest a set-piece battle, is that it surrenders the use of the sea for its own purposes, whether economic or military. In addition, such a nation lacks the ability to interdict enemy shipping movements which are protected by a sufficient escort. Such a strategy exposes the nation to blockade or even, in the worst case, invasion. In addition, while a navy optimised for sea denial operations may maximise its potential against a stronger opponent, it will be at a disadvantage against nations of similar strength of its own, but which have invested their resources in a more conventional fleet. For this reason, maritime nations which are unable to compete with the dominant naval power have usually sought to achieve an accommodation with that power, thereby allowing them to resource a balanced fleet with which to deal with their more direct rivals. Examples of this strategy are the French <a href="/wiki/Entente_cordiale" id="w">&#39;&#39;entente&#39;&#39;</a> with Britain in the decade preceding the First World War; and the British withdrawal in 1921 from its <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Japanese_Alliance" id="w">alliance with Japan</a>, in order to avoid a confrontation with the United States.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> </p>

K. Edmonds, flying a <a href="/wiki/Short_Type_184" id="w">Short 184</a> seaplane from HMS <i>Ben-My-Chree</i> on <a href="/wiki/12_August" id="w">12 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1915" id="w">1915</a>, against a 5,000 ton (5,080 tonne) Turkish supply ship in the <a href="/wiki/Sea_of_Marmara" id="w">Sea of Marmara</a>. Although the enemy ship was hit and sunk, the captain of a British submarine claimed to have fired a torpedo simultaneously and sunk the ship. It was further stated that the British submarine E14 had attacked and immobilised the ship four days earlier.

However, on 17 August 1915, another Turkish ship was sunk by a torpedo of whose origin there can be no doubt. On this occasion Flight Commander C. H. Edmonds, flying a Short 184, torpedoed a Turkish steamer a few miles north of the Dardanelles. His formation colleague, Flight Lieutenant G. B. Dacre, was forced to land on the water owing to engine trouble but, seeing an enemy tug close by, taxied up to it and released his torpedo. The tug blew up and sank. Thereafter, Dacre was able to take off and return to the <i>Ben-My-Chree</i></li><li id="_note-34"><b><a href="#_ref-34" title="">&uarr;</a></b> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.afa.org/magazine/June1996/0696mitchell.asp" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.afa.org/magazine/June1996/0696mitchell.asp">Boyne, Walter J.
