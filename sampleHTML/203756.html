<p>Although Bhumibol is a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" id="w">constitutional monarch</a>, he has several times made decisive interventions in <a href="/wiki/Politics_of_Thailand" id="w">Thai politics</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/2005-2006_Thai_political_crisis" id="w">2005-2006 Thai political crisis</a>.

A <a href="/wiki/Billionaire" id="w">billionaire</a> and one of the wealthiest men in the world, Bhumibol used part of his great wealth to fund development projects, particularly in rural areas. He is immensely popular in Thailand, and is revered as a semi-divine figure by many Thais. Critics, mostly outside Thailand, attribute this status to the <a href="/wiki/Censorship_in_Thailand" id="w">suppression of criticism</a> of the monarchy.<sup id="_ref-criticism_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-criticism" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bhumibol was born in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and educated primarily in <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>. Bhumibol is also an accomplished musician, artist, and sailor.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2> Early life </h2>
<p>Bhumibol was born at the Mount Auburn Hospital in <a href="/wiki/Cambridge%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Cambridge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Massachusetts</a>, in the United States. He was the younger son of HRH Prince <a href="/wiki/Mahidol_Adulyadej" id="w">Mahidol Adulyadej</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thai_royal_and_noble_titles#Mom (wife)" id="w">Mom</a> <a href="/wiki/Srinagarindra" id="w">Sangwal</a> (later Somdej Phra Sri Nakarindhara Boromaratchachonnani). At the time of his birth, he was known in Thailand as Phra Worawongse Ther Phra Ong Chao Bhumibol Adulyadej (พระวรวงศ์เธอ พระองค์เจ้าภูมิพลอดุลยเดช) , reflecting the fact that his mother was a commoner. Had he been born a few years earlier, before his uncle <a href="/wiki/Prajadhipok" id="w">King Prajadhipok</a> passed a law allowing children of a prince and a commoner to be called <a href="/wiki/Thai_royal_and_noble_titles#Phra Ong Chao" id="w">Phra Ong Chao</a> (a prince of a lesser status than <a href="/wiki/Thai_royal_and_noble_titles#Chao Fa" id="w">Chao Fa</a>) , he would have been called <a href="/wiki/Thai_royal_and_noble_titles#Mom Chao" id="w">Mom Chao</a> (the most junior class of the Thai princes) , as were his <a href="/wiki/Ananda_Mahidol" id="w">older brother</a> and <a href="/wiki/Galyani_Vadhana" id="w">sister</a>.<sup id="_ref-chakridynastyranks_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chakridynastyranks" title="">[3]</a></sup>  His name, Bhumibol Adulyadej, means &#34;Strength of the Land, Incomparable Power&#34;.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

Bhumibol finished his primary schooling at <a href="/wiki/Mater_Dei_Institute" id="w">Mater Dei</a> school in <a href="/wiki/Bangkok" id="w">Bangkok</a> and then left with his family in 1933 for <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>, where he received his secondary education at the <a href="/wiki/École_Nouvelle_de_la_Suisse_Romande" id="w">École Nouvelle de la Suisse Romande</a> in Chailly-sur-Lausanne.

He was studying science at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Lausanne" id="w">University of Lausanne</a> when his elder brother, Phra Ong Chao <a href="/wiki/Ananda_Mahidol" id="w">Ananda Mahidol</a>, was crowned King of Thailand in 1935. King <a href="/wiki/Ananda_Mahidol" id="w">Ananda Mahidol</a> then elevated his brother and sister to <a href="/wiki/Chao_Fa" id="w">Chao Fa</a> status, the most senior class of the Thai princes and princesses. They came to Thailand briefly in 1938, but returned to Switzerland for further study, remaining there until the end of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> in 1945.<sup id="_ref-kingjubnet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kingjubnet" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Succession_and_marriage" name="Succession_and_marriage"></a><h2> Succession and marriage </h2>
<p>Bhumibol ascended to the throne following the death of his brother, King <a href="/wiki/Ananda_Mahidol" id="w">Ananda Mahidol</a>, on <a href="/wiki/June_9" id="w">June 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/1946" id="w">1946</a>.

Bhumibol switched over his field of study to law and <a href="/wiki/Political_science" id="w">political science</a> in order to prepare himself more effectively for his new position as ruler.</p>
<p>While finishing his degree in Switzerland, Bhumibol visited <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> frequently. It was in Paris that he first met a <a href="/wiki/First_cousin_once_removed" id="w">first cousin once removed</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thai_royal_and_noble_titles#Mom Rajawongse" id="w">Mom Rajawongse</a> <a href="/wiki/Sirikit" id="w">Sirikit</a> Kitiyakara, daughter of the Thai ambassador to <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> He was 21 and she was 15.

While he was hospitalized in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, <a href="/wiki/Riante_Rive" id="w">Riante Rive</a>. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on <a href="/wiki/July_19" id="w">July 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a>, and the couple were married on <a href="/wiki/April_28" id="w">April 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1950" id="w">1950</a>, just a week before his coronation.</p>

<p>On the same day, he made his consort Queen (<a href="/wiki/Thai_royal_and_noble_titles#Somdej Phra Boromarajini" id="w">Somdej Phra Boromarajini</a>). The date of his coronation is celebrated each <a href="/wiki/May_5" id="w">May 5</a> in Thailand as <a href="/wiki/Coronation_Day_(Thailand)" id="w">Coronation Day</a>, a public holiday. On <a href="/wiki/June_9" id="w">June 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, Bhumibol celebrated his 60th anniversary as the King of Thailand, becoming the longest reigning monarch in Thai history.<sup id="_ref-longestthai_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-longestthai" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following the death of his grandmother Queen <a href="/wiki/Savang_Vadhana" id="w">Savang Vadhana</a> (สว่างวัฒนา, Sawang Watthana Phra Phanvasa Aiyeekajao) , Bhumibol entered a 15-day monkhood (<a href="/wiki/October_22" id="w">October 22</a> -<a href="/wiki/November_5" id="w">November 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1956" id="w">1956</a>) at <a href="/wiki/Wat_Bowonniwet" id="w">Wat Bowonniwet</a>, as is customary at the death of elder relatives.<sup id="_ref-monkhood_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-monkhood" title="">[13]</a></sup> During this time, Sirikit was appointed his regent.

<p>Although Bhumibol is sometimes referred to as King Rama IX in English, the name &#34;<a href="/wiki/Rama_(King_of_Thailand)" id="w">Rama</a>&#34; is never used in Thai. The name is used to approximate &#34;<b>Ratchakal ti Kao</b>&#34; (รัชกาลที่ 9, literally &#34;the Ninth Reign&#34;). More commonly, Thais refer to him as <b>Nai Luang</b> or <b>Phra Chao Yu Hua</b> (ในหลวง or พระเจ้าอยู่หัว: both mean &#34;the King&#34; or &#34;Lord Upon our Heads). He is also called <b>Chao Chiwit</b> (Lord of Life)<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>.

<a id="Plaek_Pibulsonggram_era" name="Plaek_Pibulsonggram_era"></a><h3> Plaek Pibulsonggram era </h3>
<p>In the early years of his reign, during the government of military dictator <a href="/wiki/Plaek_Pibulsonggram" id="w">Plaek Pibulsonggram</a>, Bhumibol had no real power and was little more than a ceremonial figure under the military-dominated government.  In August 1957, 6 months after parliamentary elections, General <a href="/wiki/Sarit_Dhanarajata" id="w">Sarit Dhanarajata</a> accused the government of Field Marshal <a href="/wiki/Plaek_Pibulsonggram" id="w">Pibulsonggram</a> of <a href="/wiki/L%C3%A8se_majest%C3%A9" id="w">lèse majesté</a> due to its conduct of the 2,500th anniversary celebration of <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" id="w">Buddhism</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  On <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1957" id="w">1957</a>, Pibulsonggram went to Bhumibol to seek support for his government.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>  Bhumibol told the Field Marshal to resign to avoid a coup; Pibulsonggram refused.  That evening, Sarit Dhanarajata seized power, and two hours later Bhumibol decreed martial law, named Sarit as &#34;defender of the capital&#34;, and allowed Sarit to countersign royal decrees.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Sarit_Dhanarajata_era" name="Sarit_Dhanarajata_era"></a><h3> Sarit Dhanarajata era </h3>
<p>During Sarit&#39;s dictatorship, the monarchy was revitalised.  Bhumibol attended public ceremonies, toured the provinces and patronised development projects. Under Sarit, the practice of crawling in front of royalty during audiences, banned by King <a href="/wiki/Chulalongkorn" id="w">Chulalongkorn</a>, was revived in certain situations and the royal-sponsored <a href="/wiki/Thammayut_Nikaya" id="w">Thammayut Nikaya</a> order was revitalised. For the first time since the absolute monarchy was overthrown, a king was conveyed up the <a href="/wiki/Chao_Phraya_River" id="w">Chao Phraya River</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Thailand%26%2339%3Bs_Royal_Barge_Procession" id="w">Royal Barge Procession</a> to offer robes at temples.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Other disused ceremonies from the classical period of the <a href="/wiki/Chakri_dynasty" id="w">Chakri dynasty</a>, such as the royally-patronised ploughing ceremony (Thai: พิธีพืชมงคล) , were also revived.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>  Upon Sarit&#39;s death in <a href="/wiki/8_December" id="w">8 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>, an unprecedented 21 days of mourning was declared in the palace.  A royal five-tier umbrella shaded his body while it lay in state. Long-time royal advisor Phraya Srivisarn Vacha later noted that no Prime Minister ever had such an intimate relation with Bhumibol as Sarit.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Contemporary thinkers differ in their views about the relationship between Bhumibol and Sarit. Paul Handley, writer of <a href="/wiki/The_King_Never_Smiles" id="w">The King Never Smiles</a> views Sarit as Bhumibol&#39;s tool, whereas political scientist Thak Chaloemtiarana asserts that Sarit used Bhumibol in order to build his own credibility.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Thanom_Kittikachorn_era" name="Thanom_Kittikachorn_era"></a><h3> Thanom Kittikachorn era </h3>
<p>Field Marshal <a href="/wiki/Thanom_Kittikachorn" id="w">Thanom Kittikachorn</a> was appointed premier a day after Sarit&#39;s death in 1963.  He continued most of Sarit&#39;s policies for a decade.  During the 1970s, Bhumibol was a key figure in the <a href="/wiki/Village_Scouts" id="w">Village Scouts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Red_Gaur" id="w">Red Gaur</a> paramilitary organizations. In October 1973 after massive protests and the deaths of a large number of pro-democracy demonstrators, Bhumibol opened the gates of the <a href="/wiki/Chitralada_Palace" id="w">Chitralada Palace</a> to fleeing protestors, and held an audience with student leaders. Bhumibol subsequently appointed the <a href="/wiki/Thammasat_University" id="w">Thammasat University</a> Rector <a href="/wiki/Sanya_Dharmasakti" id="w">Sanya Dharmasakti</a> as the new Prime Minister, replacing Thanom.  Thanom subsequently moved to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and <a href="/wiki/Singapore" id="w">Singapore</a>.  A succession of civilian governments followed, but the return of Field Marshal Thanom and his ordination as a novice monk at <a href="/wiki/Wat_Bowonniwet" id="w">Wat Bowonniwet</a> in 1976 led to renewed conflict. Protests against the ex-dictator escalated and came to a head when two newspapers (one English language and one Thai) published doctored photographs allegedly depicting Thammasat students hanging the Crown Prince <a href="/wiki/Vajiralongkorn" id="w">Vajiralongkorn</a> in effigy.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> With the public convinced that <i><a href="/wiki/L%C3%A8se_majest%C3%A9" id="w">lèse majesté</a></i> had been committed, military and paramilitary forces attacked the University, leading to a <a href="/wiki/6_October_1976_Massacre" id="w">bloody massacre</a> on <a href="/wiki/6_October" id="w">6 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a>.</p>
<a id="Prem_Tinsulanond_era" name="Prem_Tinsulanond_era"></a><h3> Prem Tinsulanond era </h3>
<p>The ensuing chaos was used as a pretext for a military coup that same evening.  The junta submitted three names to the king to choose from to become the next Premier: Deputy President of the king&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Privy_Council" id="w">Privy Council</a> <a href="/wiki/Prakob_Hutasingh" id="w">Prakob Hutasingh</a>, right-wing Bangkok Governor <a href="/wiki/Thamnoon_Thien-ngern" id="w">Thamnoon Thien-ngern</a>, and conservative Supreme Court judge <a href="/wiki/Thanin_Kraivixien" id="w">Thanin Kraivixien</a>.<sup id="_ref-nationgracious_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nationgracious" title="">[26]</a></sup>  Bhumibol chose Thanin as the most suitable.  However, Thanin proved to be very right-wing himself, causing student protestors to flee to join the Communists in the jungle. Thanin was himself overthrown in a military coup in October 1977 led by General <a href="/wiki/Kriangsak_Chomanan" id="w">Kriangsak Chomanan</a>. Kriangsak was succeeded in 1980 by the popular Army Commander-in-Chief, General <a href="/wiki/Prem_Tinsulanond" id="w">Prem Tinsulanond</a>, later the <a href="/wiki/Privy_Council_(Thailand)" id="w">Privy Council</a> President.  </p>

The coups led many to believe that Bhumibol had misjudged Thai society and that his credibility as an impartial mediator between various political and military factions had been compromised.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Crisis_of_1992" name="Crisis_of_1992"></a><h3> Crisis of 1992 </h3>
<p>{{main}}
In 1992, Bhumibol played a key role in Thailand&#39;s transition to a democratic system. A coup on <a href="/wiki/February_23" id="w">February 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a> returned Thailand back under military dictatorship. After a general election in 1992, the majority parties invited General <a href="/wiki/Suchinda_Kraprayoon" id="w">Suchinda Kraprayoon</a>, a leader of the coup group, to be the Prime Minister. This caused much dissent, which escalated into demonstrations that led to a large number of deaths when the military was brought in to control the protesters. The situation became increasingly critical, as neither side would back down and the violence escalated.<sup id="_ref-bloodymay_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bloodymay" title="">[30]</a></sup> Many university students and political activists in Bangkok were shot and killed when attacked by army and paramilitary forces loyal to the army and monarchy.</p>
<p>Bhumibol summoned Suchinda and the leader of the pro-democracy movement, retired Major General <a href="/wiki/Chamlong_Srimuang" id="w">Chamlong Srimuang</a>, to a televised audience. At the height of the crisis, the sight of both men appearing together on their knees (in accordance with royal protocol) made a strong impression on the nation, and led to Suchinda&#39;s resignation soon afterwards. According to the book &#34;The King Never Smiles&#34;, the audio portion of what Bhumibol actually said has never been broadcast. 
It is reputed to have been a severe royal reprimand to the pro-democracy movement for &#34;making trouble for Thailand&#34; and dividing the peace of Thai society. Suchinda was reprimanded for failing to control &#34;the mob.&#34; It was one of the few public occasions in which Bhumibol directly intervened in a political conflict directly and publicly. A general election was held shortly afterward, leading to a civilian government.<sup id="_ref-srimuang_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-srimuang" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

<p>Weeks before the <a href="/wiki/Thailand_legislative_election%2C_April_2006" id="w">April 2006 legislative election</a>, a coalition opposed to Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Thaksin_Shinawatra" id="w">Thaksin Shinawatra</a>, (including the <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Alliance_for_Democracy" id="w">People&#39;s Alliance for Democracy</a>) , petitioned Bhumibol to appoint a replacement prime minister and cabinet to resolve the <a href="/wiki/Thailand_political_crisis_2005-2006" id="w">political crisis</a>. However, demands for royal intervention met with much criticism from the public. Bhumibol, in a speech on <a href="/wiki/April_26" id="w">April 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, responded, &#34;Asking for a Royally-appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational&#34;.<sup id="_ref-invalidate_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-invalidate" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>After publicly claiming victory in the boycotted <a href="/wiki/Thailand_legislative_election%2C_April_2006" id="w">April parliamentary elections</a>, Thaksin Shinawatra had a private audience with the king. A few hours later, Thaksin appeared on national television to announce that he would not accept the premiership and would be taking a leave from politics.</p>
<p>In May 2006, the <a href="/wiki/Sondhi_Limthongkul" id="w">Sondhi Limthongkul</a>-owned <a href="/wiki/Manager_Daily" id="w">Manager Daily</a> newspaper published a series of articles describing the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Finland_Plot" id="w">Finland Plot</a>&#34;, alleging that Thaksin and former members of the <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Thailand" id="w">Communist Party of Thailand</a> planned to overthrow the king and seize control of the nation. No evidence was ever produced to verify the existence of such a plot, and Thaksin and his <a href="/wiki/Thai_Rak_Thai" id="w">Thai Rak Thai</a> party vehemently denied the accusations and sued the accusers.</p>
<p>In a rare, televised speech to senior judges, Bhumibol requested that the judiciary take action to resolve the political crisis.<sup id="_ref-invalidate_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-invalidate" title="">[32]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/May_8" id="w">May 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Thailand" id="w">Constitutional Court</a> invalidated the results of the April elections and ordered <a href="/wiki/Thailand_legislative_election%2C_October_2006" id="w">new elections scheduled for October 15, 2006</a>.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup>  The Criminal Court later jailed the Election Commissioners.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

<p>On July 20, Bhumibol signed a royal decree endorsing new <a href="/wiki/Thailand_legislative_election%2C_October_2006" id="w">House elections for October 15, 2006</a>. In an unprecedented act, the King wrote a note on the royal decree calling for a clean and fair election. That very day, Bhumibol underwent spinal surgery.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_coup" name="The_coup"></a><h4> The coup </h4>
<p>On the evening of <a href="/wiki/September_19" id="w">September 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, the Thai military overthrew the interim government and seized control of Bangkok in a bloodless coup. The junta, led by the <a href="/wiki/Sonthi_Boonyaratglin" id="w">Commander of the Army</a>, called itself the <a href="/wiki/Council_for_Democratic_Reform_under_the_Constitutional_Monarchy" id="w">Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarchy</a> and pledged its loyalty to the King.  Martial law was declared, the Constitution repealed and the October elections cancelled.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/20_September" id="w">20 September</a>, the King endorsed the coup, and asked the civil servants to take orders from Gen. Sonthi, the leader of the military coup.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/2006_Thailand_coup_d%26%2339%3B%C3%A9tat#Role and position of the King" id="w">King&#39;s role in the coup</a> was the subject of much speculation among Thai analysts and the international media.  The King had an audience with <a href="/wiki/Privy_Council_(Thailand)" id="w">Privy Council</a> President <a href="/wiki/Prem_Tinsulanonda" id="w">Prem Tinsulanonda</a> at the same time as the First Special Forces were ordered mobilized.<sup id="_ref-Timeline_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Timeline" title="">[39]</a></sup>  In a BBC interview, <a href="/wiki/Thitinan_Pongsudhirak" id="w">Thitinan Pongsudhirak</a> of <a href="/wiki/Chulalongkorn_University" id="w">Chulalongkorn University</a> noted, &#34;This coup was nothing short of Thaksin versus the King...  He is widely seen as having implicitly endorsed the coup.&#34;  In the same interview, social critic <a href="/wiki/Sulak_Sivaraksa" id="w">Sulak Sivaraksa</a> claimed, &#34;Without his involvement, the coup would have been impossible.&#34;  Sulak added that the King is &#34;very skillful. He never becomes obviously involved. If this coup goes wrong, <a href="/wiki/Sonthi_Boonyaratglin" id="w">Sonthi</a> will get the blame, but whatever happens, the King will only get praise.&#34;<sup id="_ref-kate_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kate" title="">[40]</a></sup>  On Saturday <a href="/wiki/September_23" id="w">September 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, the junta warned they would &#34;urgently retaliate against foreign reporters whose coverage has been deemed insulting to the monarchy.&#34;<sup id="_ref-abcnews1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abcnews1" title="">[41]</a></sup>  The President of Bhumibol&#39;s Privy Council, General Prem Tinsulanonda, supported the coup.  The junta later appointed Privy Council member General <a href="/wiki/Surayud_Chulanont" id="w">Surayud Chulanont</a> as Prime Minister.</p>
<a id="After_the_coup" name="After_the_coup"></a><h4> After the coup </h4>
<p>The junta appointed a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Thailand" id="w">Constitutional Tribunal</a> to rule on the alleged poll fraud cases concerning the <a href="/wiki/Thai_Rak_Thai" id="w">Thai Rak Thai</a> and <a href="/wiki/Democrat_Party_(Thailand)" id="w">Democrat</a> political parties.  Guilty rulings would have dissolved both parties, Thailand&#39;s largest and oldest, respectively, and banned the parties&#39; leadership from politics for five years.  The weeks leading up to the verdicts saw rising political tensions.  On <a href="/wiki/24_May" id="w">24 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, about a week before the scheduled verdict, Bhumibol gave a rare speech to the Supreme Administrative Court (the President of which is also a member of the Constitutional Tribunal).  &#34;You have the responsibility to prevent the country from collapsing,&#34; he warned them in the speech, which was shown on all national television channels simultaneously during the evening.  “The nation needs political parties.”   The actual meaning of Bhumibol&#39;s advice was not clear, and interpretations varied.  Some observers saw it as suggesting the judges should not make a compromise ruling.  Others saw it as a warning against dissolving the two major parties.  Bhumibol, who spoke standing but in a weak, rasping voice, was careful not to say where he stood on the merits of the case.  &#34;In my mind, I have a judgment but I cannot say,&#34; he said.  &#34;Either way the ruling goes, it will be bad for the country, there will be mistakes.&#34;<sup id="_ref-chinapost1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chinapost1" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-gulftimes1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gulftimes1" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-bbcxyz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbcxyz" title="">[44]</a></sup>  The Tribunal later acquitted the Democrat Party but dissolved the Thai Rak Thai party and banned over 100 of its executives from politics for five years.</p>
<p>The junta-appointed Constitution Drafting Assembly later tried to use the King in a <a href="/wiki/Propaganda" id="w">propaganda</a> campaign to increase public support for its widely criticized <a href="/wiki/Next_constitution_of_Thailand" id="w">draft constitution</a>.  The CDA placed billboards saying, <i>&#34;Love the King. Care about the King. Vote in the referendum. Accept the 2007 draft charter.&#34;</i> throughout the <a href="/wiki/Isaan" id="w">Northeast of Thailand</a>, where opposition to the junta was greatest.<sup id="_ref-reutersusb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reutersusb" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>

Bhumibol retains enormous powers, partly because of his immense popularity and partly because his powers  - although clearly defined in the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Thailand" id="w">Thai Constitution</a> - are often subject to conflicting interpretations.  This was highlighted by the controversy surrounding the appointment of a new Auditor-General. The Constitution Court ruled in July 2004 that the appointment of <a href="/wiki/Jaruvan_Maintaka" id="w">Jaruvan Maintaka</a> to this post by the State Audit Commission was unconstitutional. But Jaruvan refused to leave her position without an explicit order from Bhumibol. When the Senate approved of a replacement for Jaruvan, Bhumibol, in a very rare move, refused to approve the replacement.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> The Senate declined to vote to override his veto.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> Finally in February 2006 the Audit Commission reinstated Jaruvan when it became clear from a memo from the Office of the King&#39;s Principal Private Secretary that Bhumibol supported her appointment, even if it was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Senator <a href="/wiki/Kaewsan_Atibhodi" id="w">Kaewsan Atibhodi</a>, a former member of the Constitution Drafting Committee, noted that under Article Seven of the 1997 Constitution said that: &#34;whenever no provision under this Constitution is applicable to any case, it shall be decided in accordance with the constitutional practice in the democratic regime of government with the King as Head of the State”. Kaewsan interpreted this as giving Bhumibol veto powers over the Senate&#39;s appointment of Wisut Montriwat to replace Jaruvan: &#34;Whenever [the King] considers [something as being] not beneficial to the people and being unjust, His Majesty has a veto power&#34;.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bhumibol had vetoed legislation very rarely. In 1976, when the Parliament voted 149-19 to extend democratic elections down to the lowest local levels, Bhumibol refused to sign the law.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup>  The Parliament refused to vote to overturn the King&#39;s veto.  In 1954, Bhumibol vetoed parliamentary-approved land reform legislation twice before consenting to sign it.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup>  The law limited the maximum land an individual could hold to a very small 50 rai (20 acres) , at a time when the Crown Property Bureau was the itself Kingdom&#39;s largest land-owner. The law was repealed after General Sarit overthrew the elected government in a coup.</p>
<p>Bhumibol&#39;s hold over Thai public opinion was demonstrated following the <a href="/wiki/2003_Phnom_Penh_riots" id="w">2003 Phnom Penh riots</a> in Cambodia, when hundreds of Thai protesters, enraged by the burning of the Thai embassy in <a href="/wiki/Phnom_Penh" id="w">Phnom Penh</a>, gathered outside the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok, ripped the Cambodian seal out of the front wall, and tried to break into the embassy. The situation was resolved peacefully when Police General Sant Sarutanonda told the crowd that he had received a call from royal secretary Arsa Sarasin conveying Bhumibol&#39;s request for calm. The crowd dispersed.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bhumibol has the constitutional <a href="/wiki/Prerogative" id="w">prerogative</a> to <a href="/wiki/Pardon" id="w">pardon</a> criminals.  The 2006 pardoning of several convicted <a href="/wiki/Paedophiles" id="w">paedophiles</a>, including an Australian rapist and <a href="/wiki/Child_pornography" id="w">child pornographer</a>, caused controversy.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Royal_projects" name="Royal_projects"></a><h2> Royal projects </h2>
<p>Bhumibol has been involved in many social and economic development projects, although the nature of his involvement has varied by political regime.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>The military regime of <a href="/wiki/Plaek_Pibulsonggram" id="w">Plaek Pibulsonggram</a> (1951–1957) suppressed the monarchy. However, during that period Bhumibol managed to initiate a few projects using his own personal funds.  These projects included the Royal Film and Radio Broadcasting Projects.</p>
<p>In the military governments of <a href="/wiki/Sarit_Dhanarajata" id="w">Sarit Dhanarajata</a> and his successors (1958–1980), Bhumibol was reportrayed as the &#34;Development King&#34; and the source of the economic and political goals of the regime.  Royally-initiated projects were implemented under the financial and political support of the government, including projects in rural areas and communities under the influence of the <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Thailand" id="w">Communist Party of Thailand</a>.  Bhumibol&#39;s visits to these projects were heavily promoted by the Sarit government and broadcast on the state-controlled media.</p>
<p>During the civilian governments of General <a href="/wiki/Prem_Tinsulanond" id="w">Prem Tinsulanond</a> (1981–1987), the relationship between the Thai state and the monarch was at its closest.  Prem, later to become President of Bhumibol&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Privy_Council_(Thailand)" id="w">Privy Council</a>, officially allocated government budgets and manpower to support royal projects.  Most activities in this period involved the development of large scale irrigation projects.</p>
<p>During the modern period (post-1988) , the structured development of the Royal Projects reached its apex. Bhumibol&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Chaipattana_Foundation" id="w">Chaipattana Foundation</a> was established, promoting the <a href="/wiki/Sufficiency_Economy" id="w">Sufficiency Economy</a> theory, an alternative to the <a href="/wiki/Export-oriented_industrialization" id="w">export-oriented policies</a> adopted by the period&#39;s elected governments.</p>

<p>Bhumibol is the only Thai monarch —and possibly the only monarch in the world, to hold a patent;<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> obtaining one in 1993 for a waste water aerator named &#34;Chai Pattana&#34; and several patents on <a href="/wiki/Rainmaking" id="w">rainmaking</a> since 1955: the &#34;sandwich&#34; rainmaking patent in 1999 and lately the &#34;supersandwich&#34; patent in 2003.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Wealth" name="Wealth"></a><h2> Wealth </h2>
<p>Bhumibol is one of the wealthiest men in the world. Estimates of the <a href="/wiki/Asian_economic_crisis" id="w">post-devaluation</a> (circa 1997–1998) wealth of the royal household range from 2 billion to 8 billion USD.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup>  The wealth and properties of Bhumibol and his family are managed by the <a href="/wiki/Crown_Property_Bureau" id="w">Crown Property Bureau</a> (CPB) and the Privy Purse.  The CPB was established by law but is independent of the Thai Government. However, similar to other foreign royalty, the royal property (i.e. CPB) is a separate entity unto itself legally, and his true wealth could not be ranked in most publications.   </p>
<p>Through the CPB, Bhumibol owns massive amounts of land and equity in many companies.  The CPB is the majority shareholder of <a href="/wiki/Siam_Cement" id="w">Siam Cement</a> (the largest Thai industrial conglomerate) , <a href="/wiki/Christiani_%26amp%3B_Nielsen" id="w">Christiani &#38; Nielsen</a> (one of the largest construction firms) , <a href="/wiki/Deves_Insurance" id="w">Deves Insurance</a> (which has monopoly on government properties and contracts) , <a href="/wiki/Siam_Commercial_Bank" id="w">Siam Commercial Bank</a> (one of the largest banks) , and <a href="/wiki/Shin_Corporation" id="w">Shin Corporation</a> (a major telecommunications firm, through the CPB&#39;s holdings in Siam Commercial Bank).   The CPB also rents or leases about 36,000 properties to third parties, including the sites of the <a href="/wiki/Four_Seasons_Hotel_Bangkok" id="w">Four Seasons Hotel Bangkok</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Suan_Lum_Night_Bazaar" id="w">Suan Lum Night Bazaar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Siam_Paragon" id="w">Siam Paragon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Central_World_Plaza#Central World Tower" id="w">Central World Tower</a>.  The CPB spearheaded a plan to turn Bangkok’s historical <a href="/wiki/Rajadamnoen" id="w">Rajadamnoen</a> Avenue into a shopping street known as the “<a href="/wiki/Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es" id="w">Champs-Élysées</a> of Asia” and in 2007, shocked longtime residents of traditional marketplace districts by giving them eviction notices.<sup id="_ref-sentinel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sentinel" title="">[75]</a></sup> Bhumibol&#39;s substantial income from the CPB, at least five billion <a href="/wiki/Baht" id="w">baht</a> in 2004 alone, is exempt from taxes.<sup id="_ref-crownact_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-crownact" title="">[76]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-sentinel_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sentinel" title="">[75]</a></sup>  The CPB receives many state privileges.  Although the Ministry of Finance technically runs the CPB, in reality the decisions are made by Bhumibol.  The CPB&#39;s annual report is for the eyes of Bhumibol alone.<sup id="_ref-sentinel_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sentinel" title="">[75]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the King has numerous personal investments independent of the CPB.  He is personally the majority shareholder of the Thai Insurance Company and Sammakorn, as well as many other companies.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> He also receives fees from public appearances and his presence in university graduation ceremonies.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the king&#39;s use are three aircraft: the primary carrier being a model of <a href="/wiki/Boeing_737-800" id="w">Boeing 737-800</a>, also two <a href="/wiki/Airbus_A319-100" id="w">Airbus A319-100</a>&#39;s are in his personal fleet. The &#34;Air Force One&#34;, as named by the media,
had been purchased by the <a href="/wiki/Thaksin_Shinawatra" id="w">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> government for government use but the junta donated to the King after the 2006 coup.  Both Airbuses are used by other members of the royal family.<sup id="_ref-afone_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-afone" title="">[79]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Scope_of_the_law" name="Scope_of_the_law"></a><h3> Scope of the law </h3>
<p>Although Bhumibol is held in great respect by many Thais, he is also protected by <a href="/wiki/L%C3%A8se_majest%C3%A9" id="w">lèse majesté</a> laws which allow critics to be jailed for three to 15 years.<sup id="_ref-reuters1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reuters1" title="">[80]</a></sup>  The laws were toughened during the dictatorship of royalist Premier <a href="/wiki/Tanin_Kraivixien" id="w">Tanin Kraivixien</a>, such that criticism of any member of the royal family, the royal development projects, the royal institution, the Chakri Dynasty, or any previous Thai King was also banned.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> Jail terms for Thai citizens committing lèse majesté are usually harsher than for foreigners.  Social critic <a href="/wiki/Sulak_Sivaraksa" id="w">Sulak Sivaraksa</a> has been charged several times with lèse majesté, but has always been acquitted.  Politician Veera Musikapong was jailed and banned from politics for lèse majesté, despite the palace&#39;s opinion that the remarks were harmless.  Frenchman <a href="/wiki/Lech_Tomacz_Kisielwicz" id="w">Lech Tomacz Kisielwicz</a> refused to switch off a reading light on a <a href="/wiki/Thai_Airways" id="w">Thai Airways</a> flight he shared with two Thai princesses and was jailed under lèse majesté for two weeks after his flight landed in Bangkok.<sup id="_ref-timesonline1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timesonline1" title="">[82]</a></sup>  He was acquitted after apologizing to the King.  </p>
<p>There is controversy over whether criticism of members of Bhumibol&#39;s Privy Council also qualifies as criticism of Bhumibol.<sup id="_ref-foes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-foes" title="">[83]</a></sup>  Police Special Branch Commander Lt-General Theeradech Rodpho-thong refused to file charges of lèse majesté against activitists who launched a petition to oust Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda, claiming that the law only  applied to members of the royal family.<sup id="_ref-nationxyz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nationxyz" title="">[84]</a></sup>  Two days later, he was demoted by Police Commander <a href="/wiki/Seripisut_Temivavej" id="w">Seripisut Temivavej</a>.<sup id="_ref-nationabc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nationabc" title="">[85]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bhumibol himself stated that he was not above criticism in his 2005 birthday speech. &#34;Actually, I must also be criticised. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know. Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, it means that the king is not human,&#34; he said. Irritated of the website Manusaya.com that criticized him with a column titled The king can do no wrong, he answered &#34;If the King can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the King is not being treated as a human being. But the King can do wrong.&#34;<sup id="_ref-wrong_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wrong" title="">[86]</a></sup> Despite this, few have dared to call for the repeal of the law.  Any doing so have been accused of disloyalty and could also be charged with lèse majesté.<sup id="_ref-jazeerax_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jazeerax" title="">[87]</a></sup> Political scientist <a href="/wiki/Giles_Ungpakorn" id="w">Giles Ungpakorn</a> noted that &#34;the lèse majesté laws are not really designed to protect the institution of the monarchy.  In the past the laws have been used to protect governments, to protect military coups. This whole [royal] image is created to bolster a conservative elite well beyond the walls of the palace.&#34;<sup id="_ref-frenchmanjail_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-frenchmanjail" title="">[88]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Political_use_of_the_l%C3%A8se_majest%C3%A9_law" name="Political_use_of_the_l%C3%A8se_majest%C3%A9_law"></a><h3> Political use of the lèse majesté law </h3>
<p>Accusations of lese majesty are often politically motivated. Premier <a href="/wiki/Thaksin_Shinawatra" id="w">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> and his political opponent <a href="/wiki/Sondhi_Limthongkul" id="w">Sondhi Limthongkul</a> both filed charges of lèse majesté against each other during the <a href="/wiki/Thailand_political_crisis_2005-2006" id="w">2005–2006 political crisis</a>. Thaksin&#39;s alleged lèse majesté was one of the stated reasons for the Thai military&#39;s <a href="/wiki/2006_Thai_coup_d%26%2339%3B%C3%A9tat" id="w">2006 coup</a>.<sup id="_ref-protlaw_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-protlaw" title="">[89]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-murphy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-murphy" title="">[90]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-turkish_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-turkish" title="">[91]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-worldnotes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-worldnotes" title="">[92]</a></sup> Inappropriate use of lèse majesté-related accusations can also put the accuser at risk of defamation claims. </p>
<p>In 2005, the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) issued arrest warrants for two <a href="/wiki/Swedish_people" id="w">Swedish</a> citizens, Abdulrosa Jehngoh and Chipley Putra Jehngoh, claiming that their Manusaya.com website contained content insulting to Bhumibol.<sup id="_ref-specinv_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-specinv" title="">[93]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-mediazyx_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mediazyx" title="">[94]</a></sup> Chipley Putra Jehngoh also held Malaysian and Thai citizenship and at the time lived in the Middle East. Abdulrosa Jehngoh was granted Swedish citizenship and lives in <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a>. The website was hosted in Canada and was linked to separatist organization in southern Thailand or more specifically the website &#39;www.pulo.org&#39; which incited separatist movement.<sup id="_ref-crimemanager_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-crimemanager" title="">[95]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Sondhi, a vocal opposition of Prime Minister Thaksin, often accused Thaksin and his affiliates of lese majeste. In April 2007, A Bangkok criminal court sentenced Sondhi for defamation for claiming on his <a href="/wiki/Muang_Thai_Rai_Sapda" id="w">Muang Thai Rai Sapda</a> talk show that Thaksin&#39;s Deputy Transport Minister, Phumtham Vejjayachai, was linked to the anti-royal Manusaya.com website.<sup id="_ref-newswatch1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newswatch1" title="">[96]</a></sup></p>
<p>Academics have been investigated for lèse majesté for even questioning the role of the monarchy in Thai society.  In 2007, Assistant Professor Boonsong Chaisingkananon of <a href="/wiki/Silpakorn_University" id="w">Silpakorn University</a> was investigated for lese majesty for asking students in an exam if the institution of the monarchy was necessary for Thai society and how it may be reformed to be consistent with the democratic system.  The University cooperated with the police investigation, and even turned over students&#39; answer sheets and the marks the professor gave them.<sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[97]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Insults_to_Bhumibol's_image" name="Insults_to_Bhumibol's_image"></a><h3> Insults to Bhumibol&#39;s image </h3>
<p>Acts deemed insulting to Bhumibol&#39;s image are also criminal offenses in Thailand.  Charges may be filed by anybody, except for Bhumibol himself.  In 2007, Oliver Jufer, a <a href="/wiki/Swiss" id="w">Swiss</a> man, was sentenced to 10 years in jail for daubing black paint on portraits of Bhumibol while drunk.<sup id="_ref-bbcjailed_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbcjailed" title="">[98]</a></sup>  The Thai press was requested not to publish any information about the case.  &#34;This is a delicate issue and we don&#39;t want the public to know much about it,&#34; noted chief prosecutor Manoon Moongpanchon.<sup id="_ref-swissmantry_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-swissmantry" title="">[99]</a></sup> The man originally pleaded innocent, but eventually pleaded guilty to five acts of lèse majesté.

<p>American journalist Paul Handley, who spent thirteen years in Thailand, wrote the biography <i><a href="/wiki/The_King_Never_Smiles" id="w">The King Never Smiles</a></i>. The <a href="/wiki/Thailand_Ministry_of_Information_and_Communication_Technology" id="w">Information and Communications Ministry</a> banned the book and blocked the book&#39;s page on the Yale University Press website in January 2006.  In a statement dated <a href="/wiki/19_January" id="w">19 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, Thai National Police Chief General <a href="/wiki/Kowit_Wattana" id="w">Kowit Wattana</a> said the book has &#34;contents which could affect national security and the good morality of the people.&#34;<sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup>  The book provides a detailed discussion of Bhumibol&#39;s role in Thai political history and also analyzes the factors behind Bhumibol&#39;s popularity, though it is sometimes based on rumors which cannot be confirmed.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/William_Stevenson_(Canadian_writer)" id="w">William Stevenson</a>, who had access to the Royal Court and the Royal Family, wrote the biography <i>The Revolutionary King</i> in 2001.<sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[106]</a></sup> An article in <i><a href="/wiki/Time_(magazine)" id="w">Time</a></i> says the idea for the book was suggested by Bhumibol.<sup id="_ref-Time magazine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Time magazine" title="">[107]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Critics noted that the book displays intimate knowledge about personal aspects of Bhumibol. However, the book has been unofficially banned in Thailand and the Royal Household Bureau has warned the Thai media about even referring to it in print. (An official ban was not possible as it was written with the Royal blessing.) The book has been criticized for factual inaccuracies (geographical and historical) , disrespecting  Bhumibol (it refers to Bhumibol by his family nickname &#34;Lek&#34;) , and proposing a controversial theory explaining the death of King Ananda. Stevenson said, &#34;The King said from the beginning the book would be dangerous for him and for me.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Time magazine_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Time magazine" title="">[107]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Succession_to_the_throne" name="Succession_to_the_throne"></a><h2> Succession to the throne </h2>
<p>Bhumibol&#39;s only son, Prince <a href="/wiki/Vajiralongkorn" id="w">Vajiralongkorn</a>, was given the title &#34;Somdej Phra Boroma Orasadhiraj Chao Fah Maha Vajiralongkorn Sayam Makutrajakuman&#34; (Crown Prince of Siam) on <a href="/wiki/December_28" id="w">December 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1972" id="w">1972</a> and made heir apparent to the throne in accordance with the <a href="/wiki/Palace_Law_on_Succession_of_1924" id="w">Palace Law on Succession of 1924</a>.  </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/December_5" id="w">December 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1977" id="w">1977</a>, Princess <a href="/wiki/Sirindhorn" id="w">Sirindhorn</a> was given the title, &#34;Sayam Boromrajakumari&#34; (Royal Princess of Siam).  Her title is often translated by the English-language press as &#34;Crown Princess&#34;, although her official English-language title is simply &#34;Princess&#34;.<sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[108]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Thailand" id="w">constitution</a> was later amended to allow the <a href="/wiki/Privy_Council_(Thailand)" id="w">Privy Council</a> to appoint a princess as successor to the throne, this would only occur in the absence of an heir apparent.  This amendment is retained in Section 23 of the current <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Thailand" id="w">1997 &#34;People&#39;s Constitution.&#34;</a>  This effectively signalled Princess <a href="/wiki/Sirindhorn" id="w">Sirindhorn</a> as second in line to the throne, but did not affect Prince <a href="/wiki/Vajiralongkorn" id="w">Vajiralongkorn</a>&#39;s status as heir apparent.</p>
<p>Recent constitutions of Thailand have made the amendment of the <a href="/wiki/1924_Palace_Law_of_Succession" id="w">Palace Law of Succession</a> the sole prerogative of the reigning King.  According to Gothom Arya, former Election Commissioner, this allows the reigning King, if he so chooses, to appoint his son or any of his daughters to the Throne.<sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[109]</a></sup></p>
