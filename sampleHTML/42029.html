He was concurrently <a href="/wiki/Hanover_(state)" id="w">Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>, and thus Elector (and later King) of Hanover. The Electorate became the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hanover" id="w">Kingdom of Hanover</a> on <a href="/wiki/12_October" id="w">12 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1814" id="w">1814</a>. He was the third British monarch of the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Hanover" id="w">House of Hanover</a>, and the first of Hanover to be born in <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain" id="w">Britain</a> and speak <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> as his first language.<sup id="_ref-rh_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rh" title="">[2]</a></sup> In fact, he never visited <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>.</p>
<p>George III&#39;s long reign was marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdom and much of the rest of Europe. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Seven_Years%26%2339%3B_War" id="w">Seven Years&#39; War</a>, becoming the dominant European power in <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a> and <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>. However, many of its American colonies were soon lost in the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" id="w">American Revolutionary War</a>, which led to the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. Later, the kingdom became involved in a series of wars against <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" id="w">revolutionary</a> and <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" id="w">Napoleonic</a> France, which finally concluded in the defeat of Napoleon in <a href="/wiki/1815" id="w">1815</a>. In addition, during George&#39;s reign the realms of Great Britain and <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a> were joined, forming the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>. </p>
<p>Later in his reign George III suffered from recurrent and, eventually, permanent <a href="/wiki/Mental_illness" id="w">mental illness</a>. This baffled medical science at the time, although it is now generally thought that he suffered from the blood disease <a href="/wiki/Porphyria" id="w">porphyria</a>. Recently, owing to studies showing high levels of the poison <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" id="w">arsenic</a> in locks of King George&#39;s hair, arsenic is also thought to be a possible cause of King George&#39;s insanity and health problems. After a final relapse in 1810, his eldest son, <a href="/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George, Prince of Wales</a> ruled as <a href="/wiki/Prince_Regent" id="w">Prince Regent</a>. On George III&#39;s death the Prince of Wales succeeded his father, as George IV.  George III was the grandfather of <a href="/wiki/Queen_Victoria" id="w">Queen Victoria</a>.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h1>Early life</h1>
<p><b>Prince George of Wales</b> was born in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> at <a href="/wiki/Norfolk_House" id="w">Norfolk House</a> and was the son of <a href="/wiki/Frederick%2C_Prince_of_Wales" id="w">Frederick, Prince of Wales</a>, and the grandson of <a href="/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain" id="w">George II</a>. Prince George&#39;s mother was <a href="/wiki/Augusta_of_Saxe-Gotha" id="w">Augusta of Saxe-Gotha</a>. As Prince George was born two months premature and was thought unlikely to survive, he was baptised the same day by the Rector of St James&#39;s.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> He was publicly baptised by the <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Oxford" id="w">Bishop of Oxford</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Secker" id="w">Thomas Secker</a>, at Norfolk House on <a href="/wiki/4_July" id="w">4 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1738" id="w">1738</a> (New Style). His godparents were the <a href="/wiki/Frederick_I_of_Sweden" id="w">King of Sweden</a> (for whom <a href="/wiki/Charles_Calvert%2C_5th_Baron_Baltimore" id="w">Lord Baltimore</a> stood proxy), the <a href="/wiki/Frederick_III%2C_Duke_of_Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg" id="w">Duke of Saxe-Gotha</a> (for whom the <a href="/wiki/James_Brydges%2C_1st_Duke_of_Chandos" id="w">Duke of Chandos</a> stood proxy) and the <a href="/wiki/Sophia_Dorothea_of_Hanover" id="w">Queen of Prussia</a> (for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin, a daughter of the <a href="/wiki/James_Douglas%2C_4th_Duke_of_Hamilton" id="w">Duke of Hamilton</a>, stood proxy).</p>
<p>George grew into a healthy child but his grandfather George II disliked the Prince of Wales and took little interest in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury, and Prince George became <a href="/wiki/Heir_apparent" id="w">heir apparent</a> to the throne. He inherited one of his father&#39;s titles and became the <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh" id="w">Duke of Edinburgh</a>. Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George <a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Wales" id="w">Prince of Wales</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> In the spring of 1756, as George approached his eighteenth birthday, the King offered him a grand establishment at <a href="/wiki/St_James%26%2339%3Bs_Palace" id="w">St James&#39;s Palace</a>, but George refused the offer, guided by his mother and her confidante, <a href="/wiki/John_Stuart%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Bute" id="w">Lord Bute</a>, who would later serve as <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister" id="w">Prime Minister</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> George&#39;s mother, now the Dowager Princess of Wales, mistrusted her father-in-law and preferred to keep George separate from his company.</p>
<a id="Marriage" name="Marriage"></a><h1>Marriage</h1>
<p>In 1759 George was smitten with <a href="/wiki/Lady_Sarah_Lennox" id="w">Lady Sarah Lennox</a>,<sup id="_ref-dnb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[6]</a></sup> daughter of the <a href="/wiki/Charles_Lennox%2C_2nd_Duke_of_Richmond" id="w">Duke of Richmond</a>, but Lord Bute advised against the match and George abandoned his thoughts of marriage. &#34;I am born for the happiness and misery of a great nation,&#34; he wrote, &#34;and consequently must often act contrary to my passion.&#34; Nevertheless, attempts by the King to marry George to Princess <a href="/wiki/Sophia_Caroline_of_Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel" id="w">Sophia Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a> were resisted by him and his mother.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The following year, George succeeded to the Crown when his grandfather, George II, died suddenly on <a href="/wiki/25_October" id="w">25 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1760" id="w">1760</a>. The search for a suitable wife intensified, and the following year <a href="/wiki/Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz" id="w">Duchess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz</a> was chosen (though George first met her on their wedding day).  She was collected at <a href="/wiki/Cuxhaven" id="w">Cuxhaven</a> by a squadron of British yachts and warships under <a href="/wiki/Admiral_Anson" id="w">Admiral Anson</a> (including the specially renamed <a href="/wiki/HMY_Royal_Charlotte" id="w">HMY &#39;&#39;Royal Charlotte&#39;&#39;</a>), but on its return the squadron was three times blown over to the Norwegian coast by westerly gales and took ten days to reach Harwich, which it did in early September 1761.  Charlotte then travelled to London where, on <a href="/wiki/8_September" id="w">8 September</a>, <a href="/wiki/1761" id="w">1761</a>, she and the King married in the <a href="/wiki/Chapel_Royal" id="w">Chapel Royal</a>, <a href="/wiki/St_James%26%2339%3Bs_Palace" id="w">St James&#39;s Palace</a>. A fortnight later, both were crowned at <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Abbey" id="w">Westminster Abbey</a>. George remarkably never took a <a href="/wiki/Mistress_(lover)" id="w">mistress</a> (in contrast with both his Hanoverian predecessors and his sons), and the couple enjoyed a genuinely happy marriage.<sup id="_ref-rh_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rh" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dnb_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[6]</a></sup> They had 15 children – nine sons and six daughters.</p>
<a id="Early_reign" name="Early_reign"></a><h1>Early reign</h1>
<p>The first years of George&#39;s reign were marked by political instability, largely generated as a result of disagreements over the <a href="/wiki/Seven_Years%26%2339%3B_War" id="w">Seven Years&#39; War</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> The favouritism which George initially showed towards <a href="/wiki/Tory" id="w">Tory</a> ministers led to his denunciation by the <a href="/wiki/British_Whig_Party" id="w">Whigs</a> as an autocrat in the manner of <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" id="w">Charles I</a>.<sup id="_ref-rh_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rh" title="">[2]</a></sup> In May 1762, George replaced the incumbent Whig ministry of <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Pelham-Holles%2C_1st_Duke_of_Newcastle" id="w">the Duke of Newcastle</a> with one led by the Tory Lord Bute. The following year, after concluding the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)" id="w">Peace of Paris</a> ending the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under <a href="/wiki/George_Grenville" id="w">George Grenville</a> to return to power. Later that year, the British government under George III issued the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_of_1763" id="w">Royal Proclamation of 1763</a> that placed a boundary upon the westward expansion of the American colonies. The Proclamation&#39;s goal was to force colonists to negotiate with the Native Americans for the lawful purchase of the land and, therefore, to reduce the costly frontier warfare that had erupted over land conflicts. The Proclamation Line, as it came to be known, was extremely unpopular with the Americans and ultimately became another wedge between the colonists and the British government that would eventually lead to war. With the American colonists generally unburdened by British taxes, the government found it increasingly difficult to pay for the defence of the colonies against native uprisings and the possibility of French incursions.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> In 1765, Grenville introduced the <a href="/wiki/Stamp_Act_1765" id="w">Stamp Act</a>, which levied a <a href="/wiki/Stamp_duty" id="w">stamp duty</a> on all documents in the British colonies in North America. Meanwhile, the King had become exasperated at Grenville&#39;s attempts to reduce the King&#39;s prerogatives, and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade <a href="/wiki/William_Pitt%2C_1st_Earl_of_Chatham" id="w">William Pitt the Elder</a> to accept the office of Prime Minister.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> After a brief illness, which may have presaged his illnesses to come, George settled on <a href="/wiki/Charles_Watson-Wentworth%2C_2nd_Marquess_of_Rockingham" id="w">Lord Rockingham</a> to form a ministry, and dismissed Grenville.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lord Rockingham, with the support of Pitt, repealed Grenville&#39;s unpopular Stamp Act, but his government was weak and he was replaced in 1766 by Pitt, whom George created <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Chatham" id="w">Earl of Chatham</a>. The actions of Lord Chatham and George III in repealing the Act were so popular in America that statues of them both were erected in <a href="/wiki/History_of_New_York_City_(1665-1783)" id="w">New York City</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Lord Chatham fell ill in 1767, allowing the <a href="/wiki/Augustus_FitzRoy%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Grafton" id="w">Duke of Grafton</a> to take over the government, although he did not formally become Prime Minister until 1768. His government disintegrated in 1770, allowing the Tories to return to power.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The government of the new Prime Minister, <a href="/wiki/Frederick_North%2C_Lord_North" id="w">Lord North</a>, was chiefly concerned with discontent in America. To assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn, with the exception of the tea duty, which in George&#39;s words was &#34;one tax to keep up the right [to levy taxes]&#34;.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> In 1773, a <a href="/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Boston</a> mob threw 342 crates of <a href="/wiki/Tea" id="w">tea</a>, costing approximately £10,000, into Boston Harbour as a political protest, an event that became known as the <a href="/wiki/Boston_tea_party" id="w">Boston tea party</a>. In Britain, opinion hardened against the colonists, with Chatham now agreeing with North that the destruction of the tea was &#34;certainly criminal&#34;.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Lord North introduced the <a href="/wiki/Intolerable_Acts" id="w">Punitive Acts</a>, known as the Coercive Acts or the Intolerable Acts by the colonists: the Port of Boston was shut down and legislative elections in the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Colony of Massachusetts Bay</a> were suspended. Up to this point, in the words of Professor Peter Thomas, George&#39;s &#34;hopes were centred on a political solution, and he always bowed to his cabinet&#39;s opinions even when sceptical of their success. The detailed evidence of the years from 1763 to 1775 tends to exonerate George III from any real responsibility for the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution" id="w">American Revolution</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>

<p>On George&#39;s accession, he ended hereditary revenues of <a href="/wiki/Crown_land" id="w">Crown lands</a> when he surrendered the <a href="/wiki/Crown_Estate" id="w">Crown Estate</a> to <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain" id="w">Parliament</a> in return for a fixed <a href="/wiki/Civil_list" id="w">civil list</a> payment - the income retained from the <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Lancaster" id="w">Duchy of Lancaster</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup>  The King surrendered to Parliamentary control the hereditary excise duties, post office revenues, and ‘the small branches’ of Hereditary Revenue including rents of the Crown lands in England, (which amounted to about £11,000) and was granted a <a href="/wiki/Civil_List" id="w">Civil List</a> annuity of £800,000 for the support of his household and the expenses of Civil Government, subject to the payment of certain annuities to members of the royal family. Although the King had retained large Hereditary Revenues, his income proved insufficient for his charged expenses because he used the privilege to reward supporters with bribes and gifts.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Debts amounting to over £3 million over the course of George&#39;s reign were paid by Parliament, and the Civil List annuity was then increased from time to time.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="American_Revolutionary_War" name="American_Revolutionary_War"></a><h1>American Revolutionary War</h1>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" id="w">American Revolutionary War</a> began when armed conflict between British regulars and colonial militiamen broke out in New England in April 1775. A month later, <a href="/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress" id="w">delegates of the thirteen British colonies</a> drafted a peace proposal known as the <a href="/wiki/Olive_Branch_Petition" id="w">Olive Branch Petition</a>. The proposal was quickly rejected in London because fighting had already erupted. A year later, on <a href="/wiki/July_2" id="w">July 2</a> <a href="/wiki/1776" id="w">1776</a>, the colonies declared their independence from the Crown and became a new nation, the &#34;United States of America&#34;. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence" id="w">Declaration</a> was a long list of grievances against the British King, legislature, and populace. Amongst George&#39;s other offences, the Declaration charged, &#34;He has abdicated Government here... He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.&#34; George was indignant when he learned of the opinions of the colonists. In the war the British captured New York City in 1776, but the grand strategic plan of invading from <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> failed with the surrender of the British Lieutenant-General <a href="/wiki/John_Burgoyne" id="w">John Burgoyne</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Saratoga" id="w">Battle of Saratoga</a>. In 1778, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> (Great Britain&#39;s chief rival) signed a treaty of friendship with the new United States. <a href="/wiki/Lord_North" id="w">Lord North</a> asked to transfer power to <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chatham" id="w">Lord Chatham</a>, whom he thought more capable. George, however, would hear nothing of such suggestions; he suggested that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North&#39;s administration. Chatham refused to cooperate, and died later in the same year.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Great Britain was then at war with France, and in 1779 it was also at war with <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>.</p>
<p>George III obstinately tried to keep Great Britain at war with the revolutionaries in America, despite the opinions of his own ministers. <a href="/wiki/Granville_Leveson-Gower%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Stafford" id="w">Lord Gower</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Thynne%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Bath" id="w">Lord Weymouth</a> both resigned rather than suffer the indignity of being associated with the war. <a href="/wiki/Lord_North" id="w">Lord North</a> advised George III that his (North&#39;s) opinion matched that of his ministerial colleagues, but stayed in office. Eventually, George gave up hope of subduing America by more armies. &#34;It was a joke,&#34; he said, &#34;to think of keeping Pennsylvania&#34;. There was no hope of ever recovering New England. But the King was determined &#34;never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal.&#34;<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> His plan was to keep the 30,000 men garrisoned in New York, Rhode Island, in Canada, and in Florida; other forces would attack the French and Spanish in the West Indies. To punish the Americans the King planned to destroy their coasting-trade, bombard their ports, sack and burn towns along the coast (like <a href="/wiki/New_London%2C_Connecticut" id="w">New London</a>, <a href="/wiki/Connecticut" id="w">Connecticut</a>), and turn loose the Indians to attack civilians in frontier settlements. These operations, the King felt, would inspire the Loyalists; would splinter the Congress; and &#34;would keep the rebels harassed, anxious, and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse&#34; and they would beg to return to his authority.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> The plan meant destruction for the Loyalists and loyal Indians, and indefinite prolongation of a costly war, as well as the risk of disaster as the French and Spanish were assembling an armada to invade the British isles and seize London.</p>
<p>In 1781, the news of <a href="/wiki/Charles_Cornwallis%2C_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis" id="w">Lord Cornwallis&#39;s</a> surrender at the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown" id="w">Siege of Yorktown</a> reached London; <a href="/wiki/Lord_North" id="w">Lord North</a>&#39;s parliamentary support ebbed away and he subsequently resigned in 1782. After Lord North persuaded the king against abdicating,<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> George III finally accepted the defeat in North America, and authorised the negotiation of a peace. The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)" id="w">Treaty of Paris</a> and the associated <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles_(1783)" id="w">Treaty of Versailles</a> were ratified in 1783. The former treaty provided for the recognition of the United States by Great Britain. The latter required Great Britain to give up <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> to Spain and to grant access to the waters of <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)" id="w">Newfoundland</a> to France. When <a href="/wiki/John_Adams" id="w">John Adams</a> was appointed American Minister to Britain in 1785, George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the United States, &#34;I was the last to consent to the separation; but&#34; he told Adams, &#34;I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power.&#34;<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Constitutional_struggle" name="Constitutional_struggle"></a><h1>Constitutional struggle</h1>
<p>With the collapse of <a href="/wiki/Lord_North" id="w">Lord North</a>&#39;s ministry in 1782, the Whig Lord Rockingham became Prime Minister for the second time, but died within months. The King then appointed <a href="/wiki/William_Petty%2C_2nd_Earl_of_Shelburne" id="w">Lord Shelburne</a> to replace him. <a href="/wiki/Charles_James_Fox" id="w">Charles James Fox</a>, however, refused to serve under Shelburne, and demanded the appointment of the <a href="/wiki/William_Cavendish-Bentinck%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Portland" id="w">Duke of Portland</a>. In 1783, the House of Commons forced Lord Shelburne from office and his government was replaced by the <a href="/wiki/Fox-North_Coalition" id="w">Fox-North Coalition</a>. The Duke of Portland became Prime Minister; Fox and Lord North, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary respectively, really held power, with Portland acting as a figurehead.<sup id="_ref-dnb_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>George III was distressed by the attempts to force him to appoint ministers not of his liking, but the Portland ministry quickly built up a majority in the House of Commons, and could not easily be displaced. He was, moreover, extremely dissatisfied when the government introduced the India Bill, which proposed to reform the government of India by transferring political power from the <a href="/wiki/Honourable_East_India_Company" id="w">Honourable East India Company</a> to Parliamentary commissioners.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Immediately after the House of Commons passed it George authorised <a href="/wiki/George_Nugent-Temple-Grenville%2C_1st_Marquess_of_Buckingham" id="w">Lord Temple</a> to inform the House of Lords that he would regard any peer who voted for the bill as his enemy. The bill was rejected by the Lords; three days later, the Portland ministry was dismissed, and <a href="/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger" id="w">William Pitt the Younger</a> was appointed Prime Minister, with Temple as his Secretary of State. On <a href="/wiki/17_December" id="w">17 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1783" id="w">1783</a>, Parliament voted in favour of a motion condemning the influence of the monarch in parliamentary voting as a &#34;high crime&#34; and Temple was forced to resign. Temple&#39;s departure destabilised the government, and three months later the government lost its majority and Parliament was dissolved; the subsequent <a href="/wiki/British_general_election%2C_1784" id="w">election</a> gave Pitt a firm mandate.<sup id="_ref-dnb_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>For George III, Pitt&#39;s appointment was a great victory. The King felt that the scenario proved that he still had the power to appoint Prime Ministers without having to rely on any parliamentary group. Throughout Pitt&#39;s ministry, George eagerly supported many of his political aims. To aid Pitt, George created new peers at an unprecedented rate. The new peers flooded the House of Lords and allowed Pitt to maintain a firm majority. During Pitt&#39;s ministry, George III was extremely popular. The public supported the exploratory voyages to the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a> that he sanctioned. George also aided the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Academy" id="w">Royal Academy</a> with large grants from his private funds. The British people admired their King for remaining faithful to his wife, unlike the two previous Hanoverian monarchs. Great advances were made in fields such as in <a href="/wiki/Science" id="w">science</a> and <a href="/wiki/Industry" id="w">industry</a>.</p>
<p>However, by this time George III&#39;s health was deteriorating. He suffered from a mental illness, now widely believed to be a symptom of <a href="/wiki/Porphyria" id="w">porphyria</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> A study of samples of the King&#39;s hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" id="w">arsenic</a>, a possible trigger for the disease.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> The King may have previously suffered a brief episode of the disease in 1765, but a longer episode began in the summer of 1788. George was sufficiently sane to <a href="/wiki/Prorogation" id="w">prorogue</a> Parliament on <a href="/wiki/25_September" id="w">25 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1788" id="w">1788</a>, but his condition worsened and in November he became seriously deranged, sometimes speaking for many hours without pause. With his doctors largely at a loss to explain his illness, spurious stories about his condition spread, such as the claim that he shook hands with a tree in the mistaken belief that it was the King of Prussia.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> When Parliament reconvened in November, the King could not, as was customary, communicate to them the agenda for the upcoming legislative session. According to long-established practice, Parliament could not begin the transaction of business until the King had made the <a href="/wiki/Speech_from_the_Throne" id="w">Speech from the Throne</a>. Parliament, however, ignored the custom and began to debate provisions for a regency.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Charles_James_Fox" id="w">Charles James Fox</a> and William Pitt wrangled over the terms of which individual was entitled to take over government during the illness of the Sovereign. Although both parties agreed that it would be most reasonable for George III&#39;s eldest son and <a href="/wiki/Heir_apparent" id="w">heir apparent</a>, the Prince of Wales, to act as Regent, they disagreed over the basis of a regency. Fox suggested that it was the Prince of Wales&#39;s absolute right to act on his ill father&#39;s behalf; Pitt argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a Regent.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Proceedings were further delayed as the authority for Parliament to merely meet was questioned, as the session had not been formally opened by the Sovereign. Pitt proposed a remedy based on an obscure <a href="/wiki/Legal_fiction" id="w">legal fiction</a>. As was well-established at the time, the Sovereign could delegate many of his functions to Lords Commissioners by <a href="/wiki/Letters_patent" id="w">letters patent</a>, which were validated by the attachment of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_Realm" id="w">Great Seal</a>. It was proposed that the custodian of the Great Seal, the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" id="w">Lord Chancellor</a>, affix the Seal without the consent of the Sovereign. Although such an action would be unlawful, it would not be possible to question the validity of the letters patent, as the presence of the Great Seal would be deemed conclusive in court. George III&#39;s second son, the <a href="/wiki/Prince_Frederick%2C_Duke_of_York" id="w">Prince Frederick, Duke of York</a>, denounced Pitt&#39;s proposal as &#34;unconstitutional and illegal&#34;. Nonetheless, the Lords Commissioners were appointed and then opened Parliament. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the Prince of Wales to act as Prince Regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons. But before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered from his illness under the treatment of Dr <a href="/wiki/Francis_Willis" id="w">Francis Willis</a>. He confirmed the actions of the Lords Commissioners as valid, but resumed full control of government.</p>
<a id="French_Revolutionary_and_Napoleonic_Wars" name="French_Revolutionary_and_Napoleonic_Wars"></a><h1>French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars</h1>
<p>After George recovered from his illness, his popularity, and that of Pitt, greatly increased at the expense of Fox and the Prince of Wales.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" id="w">French Revolution</a> of 1789, in which the <a href="/wiki/French_monarchy" id="w">French monarchy</a> had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> declared war on Great Britain in 1793; George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and suspend the right of <i><a href="/wiki/Habeas_corpus" id="w">habeas corpus</a></i>.</p>
<p>As well-prepared as Great Britain may have been, France was stronger. The <a href="/wiki/First_coalition" id="w">First Coalition</a> to oppose revolutionary France, which included <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prussia" id="w">Prussia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>, was defeated in 1798. The <a href="/wiki/Second_Coalition" id="w">Second Coalition</a>, which included Austria, <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Ottoman Empire</a>, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" id="w">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, the <a href="/wiki/First_Consul" id="w">First Consul</a> of the <a href="/wiki/French_First_Republic" id="w">French Republic</a>. </p>
<p>A failed attempt to <a href="/wiki/Assassination" id="w">assassinate</a> the King on <a href="/wiki/May_15" id="w">May 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1800" id="w">1800</a> was not political in origin but motivated by the <a href="/wiki/Religion" id="w">religious</a> <a href="/wiki/Delusion" id="w">delusions</a> of <a href="/wiki/James_Hadfield" id="w">James Hadfield</a>, who shot at the King in the <a href="/wiki/Theatre_Royal%2C_Drury_Lane" id="w">Drury Lane Theatre</a> during the playing of the <a href="/wiki/National_anthem" id="w">national anthem</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after 1800, a brief lull in hostilities allowed Pitt to concentrate on <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a>, where there had been an uprising in 1798. Parliament then passed the <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Union_1800" id="w">Act of Union 1800</a>, which, on <a href="/wiki/1_January" id="w">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1801" id="w">1801</a>, united Great Britain and Ireland into a single nation, known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. George used the opportunity to drop <a href="/wiki/English_claims_to_the_French_throne" id="w">the claim to the Throne of France</a>, which English and British Sovereigns had maintained since the reign of <a href="/wiki/Edward_III_of_England" id="w">Edward III</a>. It was suggested that George adopt the title &#34;<a href="/wiki/Emperor_of_the_British_and_Hanoverian_Dominions" id="w">Emperor of the British and Hanoverian Dominions</a>&#34;, but he refused. <a href="/wiki/A._G._Stapleton" id="w">A. G. Stapleton</a> writes that George III &#34;felt that his true dignity consisted in his being known to Europe and the world by the appropriated and undisputed style belonging to the British Crown.&#34;</p>
<p>As part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism" id="w">Roman Catholics</a> after the Union. George III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which Sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism.<sup id="_ref-rh_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rh" title="">[2]</a></sup> The King declared, </p>
<p /><blockquote>&#34;Where is the power on Earth to absolve me from the observance of every sentence of that oath, particularly the one requiring me to maintain the Protestant Reformed Religion? … No, no, I had rather beg my bread from door to door throughout Europe, than consent to any such measure. I can give up my crown and retire from power. I can quit my palace and live in a cottage. I can lay my head on a block and lose my life, but I cannot break my oath.&#34;</blockquote> 

<p>Faced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> At about the same time, the King suffered a relapse of his previous illness, which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/14_March" id="w">14 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1801" id="w">1801</a>, Pitt was formally replaced by the <a href="/wiki/Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons" id="w">Speaker of the House of Commons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Addington%2C_1st_Viscount_Sidmouth" id="w">Henry Addington</a>. As Addington was his close friend, Pitt remained as a private advisor. Addington&#39;s ministry was particularly unremarkable, as almost no reforms were made or measures passed. In fact, the nation was strongly against the very idea of reform, having just witnessed the bloody French Revolution. Although they called for passive behaviour in the United Kingdom, the public wanted strong action in Europe, but Addington failed to deliver. In October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens.</p>
<p>George did not consider the peace with France as &#34;real&#34;; in his view it was an &#34;experiment&#34;. In 1803, the two nations once again declared war on each other. In 1804, George was again affected by his recurrent illness; on his recovery, he discovered that public opinion distrusted Addington to lead the nation in war, and instead favoured Pitt. Pitt sought to appoint Fox to his ministry, but George III refused as the King disliked Fox, who had encouraged the Prince of Wales to lead an extravagant life. <a href="/wiki/William_Wyndham_Grenville%2C_1st_Baron_Grenville" id="w">Lord Grenville</a> perceived an injustice to Fox, and refused to join the new ministry.<sup id="_ref-dnb_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pitt concentrated on forming a coalition with Austria, Russia, and <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a>. This <a href="/wiki/Third_Coalition" id="w">Third Coalition</a>, however, met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, collapsing in 1805. An invasion of England by Napoleon seemed imminent, but the possibility was extinguished after <a href="/wiki/Horatio_Nelson%2C_1st_Viscount_Nelson" id="w">Admiral Lord Nelson</a>&#39;s famous naval victory at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Trafalgar" id="w">Battle of Trafalgar</a>.</p>
<p>The setbacks in Europe took a toll on William Pitt&#39;s health. Pitt died in 1806, once again reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry. Lord Grenville became Prime Minister, and his &#34;<a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_All_the_Talents" id="w">Ministry of All the Talents</a>&#34; included Charles James Fox. The King was conciliatory towards Fox, after being forced to capitulate over his appointment. After Fox&#39;s death in September 1806, the King and ministry were in open conflict. The ministry had proposed a measure whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in all ranks of the Armed Forces. George instructed them not only to drop the measure, but also to agree never to set up such a measure again. The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending, but refused to bind themselves in the future. In 1807 they were dismissed and replaced by the Duke of Portland as the nominal Prime Minister, with actual power being held by the <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer" id="w">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spencer_Perceval" id="w">Spencer Perceval</a>. Parliament was dissolved; the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1807" id="w">subsequent election</a> gave the ministry a strong majority in the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons" id="w">House of Commons</a>. George III made no further major political decisions during his reign; the replacement of the Duke of Portland by Perceval in 1809 was of little actual significance.</p>

<p>In 1810, already virtually blind with cataracts and in pain from rheumatism, George III became dangerously ill.

<p>Meanwhile, George&#39;s health deteriorated, and eventually he became completely blind and increasingly deaf.

Over <a href="/wiki/Christmas" id="w">Christmas</a> 1819, he spoke nonsense for 58 hours, and for the last few weeks of his life was unable to walk.

George III lived for 81 years and 239 days and reigned for 59 years and 96 days &#8212; both his life and his reign were longer than any previous English or British monarch. Only George&#39;s granddaughter <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Victoria</a> exceeded his record, although <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Elizabeth II</a> has lived longer. George III&#39;s reign was longer than the total reign of his three immediate predecessors (<a href="/wiki/Anne_of_Great_Britain" id="w">Queen Anne</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_I_of_Great_Britain" id="w">King George I</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain" id="w">King George II</a>) combined. </p>
<p>While very popular in Britain, George was hated by revolutionary American colonists (about a third of the population of the American colonies). The grievances in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence" id="w">United States Declaration of Independence</a> were presented as &#34;repeated injuries and usurpations&#34; that he had committed to establish &#34;an absolute Tyranny&#34; over the colonies. The Declaration&#39;s wording has contributed to the American public&#39;s perception of George as a tyrant. American resentment toward George was exacerbated by his failure to intercede personally on the colonists&#39; behalf after the <a href="/wiki/Olive_Branch_Petition" id="w">Olive Branch Petition</a>. George was hated in Ireland for the atrocities carried out in his name during the suppression of the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Rebellion_of_1798" id="w">1798 rebellion</a>. In light of these concerns, British historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as <a href="/wiki/Sir_George_Trevelyan%2C_2nd_Baronet" id="w">Trevelyan</a>, promoted hostile interpretations of George III&#39;s life. However, scholars of the later twentieth century, such as <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Butterfield" id="w">Butterfield</a> and Pares, and Macalpine and Hunter, are more inclined to be sympathetic, seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness. Today, the long reign of George III is perceived as a continuation of the reduction in the political power of monarchy, and its growth as the embodiment of national morality.<sup id="_ref-dnb_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[6]</a></sup>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/British_Agricultural_Revolution" id="w">British Agricultural Revolution</a> reached its peak under George III.

From the time of his coronation until 1800, George&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Heraldry" id="w">arms</a> were: <i>Quarterly, I Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>) impaling Or a lion rampant within a double-tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>); II Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or (for <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a>); IV tierced per pale and per chevron (for <a href="/wiki/Hanover" id="w">Hanover</a>), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for <a href="/wiki/Brunswick_(city)" id="w">Brunswick</a>), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for <a href="/wiki/L%C3%BCneburg" id="w">Lüneburg</a>), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for <a href="/wiki/Westfalen" id="w">Westfalen</a>), overall an escutcheon Gules charged with the crown of <a href="/wiki/Charlemagne" id="w">Charlemagne</a> Or (for the dignity of Arch<a href="/wiki/Treasurer" id="w">treasurer</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" id="w">Holy Roman Empire</a>)</i>.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Union_1800" id="w">Act of Union 1800</a>, his arms were amended, dropping the French quartering. They became: <i>Quarterly, I and IV Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland); overall an escutcheon tierced per pale and per chevron (for Hanover), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for Lunenburg), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for Westfalen), the whole inescutcheon surmounted by an electoral bonnet.</i> In 1816, two years after the <a href="/wiki/Hanover_(state)" id="w">Electorate of Hanover</a> became a Kingdom, the electoral bonnet was changed to a crown.</p>
