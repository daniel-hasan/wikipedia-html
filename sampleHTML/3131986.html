<p>Prior to the release of <i>Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000</i>, there was some talk of the idea that a <a href="/wiki/Best_of" id="w">best of</a> album would be a mistake by the band, as they were generally seen to &#34;end of an artist&#39;s creative haul&#34;.<sup id="_ref-AMO_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AMO" title="">[1]</a></sup> Australian Music Online, publishing a <a href="/wiki/Universal_Music_Australia" id="w">Universal Music Australia</a> press release, said these fears were not justified, and that the album would be &#34;a Powderfinger biography that really tells the story better than anyone can on paper&#34;.<sup id="_ref-AMO_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AMO" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/MTV" id="w">MTV Scene</a> writer Craig Tangsley also commented on fears about the &#34;death&#34; of the band, stating that he spoke to <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Fanning" id="w">Bernard Fanning</a> about the band&#39;s death as &#34;it&#39;s inevitable to talk when someone releases a best of album&#34;.<sup id="_ref-HSMTV_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HSMTV" title="">[2]</a></sup> Fanning denied that the band was finished, instead claiming that <i>Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000</i> was spawned due to a deal with the band&#39;s record label. He also assured readers that the band had another album planned.<sup id="_ref-HSMTV_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HSMTV" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Ciao</i> reviewer cocoklo agreed with Universal&#39;s assessment, stating that &#34;If there ever was a band, in my opinion, that needed a greatest hits album, it&#39;s Powderfinger&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Ciao_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ciao" title="">[3]</a></sup> However, he noted another issue which had some influence on the production of the album - the issue of which songs to include. As the band had only released five albums, they were forced to mostly include the singles they had previously released.<sup id="_ref-Ciao_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ciao" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Throughout production stages, the album was not referred to as <i>Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994 - 2000</i>, but rather by its alternative title; <i>From Heavy Metal to Centenary Medal</i>. It is unknown when the band decided on the final title of the album.<sup id="_ref-Fingerprints_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fingerprints" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Sputrev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sputrev" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
