<p>The <b>Battle of Dyrrhachium</b> or <b>Siege of Durazzo</b> took place on <a href="/wiki/October_18" id="w">October 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1081" id="w">1081</a> between the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" id="w">Byzantine Empire</a>, led by the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Emperor" id="w">Emperor</a> <a href="/wiki/Alexius_I_Comnenus" id="w">Alexius I</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Normans" id="w">Normans</a> of Southern Italy under <a href="/wiki/Robert_Guiscard" id="w">Robert Guiscard</a>, <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Apulia_%26amp%3B_Calabria" id="w">Duke of Apulia &#38; Calabria</a>. The battle was fought outside the city of <a href="/wiki/Durres" id="w">Dyrrhachium</a>, the Byzantine capital of <a href="/wiki/Illyria" id="w">Illyria</a>, and ended in a Norman victory.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_southern_Italy" id="w">Norman conquest of Byzantine Italy and Saracen Sicily</a>, the Byzantine Emperor, <a href="/wiki/Michael_VII" id="w">Michael VII</a> betrothed his son to <a href="/wiki/Robert_Guiscard" id="w">Robert Guiscard</a>&#39;s daughter. When Michael was deposed, Robert took this as an excuse to invade the Byzantine Empire in 1081. His army laid siege to Dyrrhachium but his fleet was defeated by the <a href="/wiki/Venetians" id="w">Venetians</a>. On October 18, the Normans engaged a Byzantine army under Alexius I Comnenus outside Dyrrhachium. The battle began with the Byzantine right wing routing the Norman left wing which broke and fled. <a href="/wiki/Varangians" id="w">Varangians</a> mercenaries joined in the pursuit of the fleeing Normans but became separated from the main force and were massacred. Norman <a href="/wiki/Knights" id="w">knights</a> in the centre attacked the Byzantine centre and routed it, causing the Byzantines to flee. </p>
<p>After the capture of Dyrrhachium in February 1082, the Normans advanced inland capturing most of <a href="/wiki/Macedonia_(region)" id="w">Macedonia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thessaly" id="w">Thessaly</a>. However, Robert was forced to leave <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a> following an attack on his ally, the <a href="/wiki/Pope" id="w">Pope</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" id="w">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_IV%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Henry IV</a>. Robert left his son <a href="/wiki/Bohemond_of_Taranto" id="w">Bohemond</a> in charge of the army in Greece. Bohemond was initially successful defeating Alexius in several battles. However, he was defeated by Alexius outside <a href="/wiki/Larissa" id="w">Larissa</a> and was forced to retreat to Italy losing all the Norman conquests.</p>

By the next year, they conquered all of Sicily ending the Islamic <a href="/wiki/Emirate_of_Sicily" id="w">Emirate of Sicily</a>. In 1073, the Byzantine Emperor <a href="/wiki/Michael_VII" id="w">Michael VII</a> sent an envoy to Robert offering the hand of his son <a href="/wiki/Constantine" id="w">Constantine</a> to Robert&#39;s daughter <a href="/wiki/Helena" id="w">Helena</a>.<sup id="_ref-N14-J_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N14-J" title="">[4]</a></sup> Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a>.

<p>Robert conscripted all men of a fighting age into the army, which he refitted.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Meanwhile, he sent an ambassador to the Byzantine court with orders to demand proper treatment for Helena and to win over the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_aristocracy_and_bureaucracy" id="w">Domestic of the Schools</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alexius_I_Comnenus" id="w">Alexius I Comnenus</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The results of these attempts remain unknown, but the ambassador fell under Alexios&#39; charm and as he was returning to Italy, he heard of Alexios&#39; successful coup against Botaneiates.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

The Norman fleet of 150 ships including 60 horse transports set off towards the Byzantine Empire at the end of May 1081. The army numbered 30,000 men, backed up by 1,300 Norman knights.<sup id="_ref-N17-J_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N17-J" title="">[10]</a></sup> The fleet sailed to <a href="/wiki/Vlor%C3%AB" id="w">Avalona</a> in Byzantine territory; they were joined by several ships from <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ragusa" id="w">Ragusa</a>, a republic in the <a href="/wiki/Balkans" id="w">Balkans</a> who hated the Byzantines.<sup id="_ref-Norwich17_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Norwich17" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Robert soon left Avalona and sailed to the island of <a href="/wiki/Corfu" id="w">Corfu</a>, which surrendered due to a small garrison. Having won a bridgehead and a clear path for reinforcements from Italy, he advanced on the city of <a href="/wiki/Durres" id="w">Dyrrhachium</a>, the capital and chief port of <a href="/wiki/Illyria" id="w">Illyria</a>.<sup id="_ref-Gravett and Nicolle108_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gravett and Nicolle108" title="">[12]</a></sup> The city was well defended, on a long, narrow peninsula running parallel to the coast but separated by marshlands.

<p>Meanwhile, when Alexius heard that the Normans were preparing to invade Byzantine territory, he sent an ambassador to the <a href="/wiki/Doge" id="w">Doge</a> of <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Venice" id="w">Venice</a>, <a href="/wiki/Domenico_Selvo" id="w">Domenico Selvo</a>, requesting aid and offering trading rights in return.<sup id="_ref-Norwich17_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Norwich17" title="">[11]</a></sup> The Doge, alarmed by Norman control of the <a href="/wiki/Strait_of_Otranto" id="w">Strait of Otranto</a>, took command of the Venetian fleet and sailed at once, surprising the Norman fleet under the command of Bohemond as night was falling.

<p>Robert was not discouraged by this naval defeat, and began his siege of Dyrrhachium. In command of the garrison at Dyrrhachium was the experienced general <a href="/wiki/George_Palaeologus" id="w">George Palaeologus</a>, sent by Alexius with orders to hold out at all costs while Alexius himself mustered an army to relieve the city.<sup id="_ref-Norwich18_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Norwich18" title="">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Byzantine fleet arrived and – after joining with the Venetian fleet – attacked the Norman fleet, which was again routed. The garrison at Dyrrhachium managed to hold out all summer, despite Robert&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Catapults" id="w">catapults</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ballistae" id="w">ballistae</a> and <a href="/wiki/Siege_tower" id="w">siege tower</a>. The garrison made continuous sallies from the city; on one occasion, Palaeologus fought all day with an arrowhead in his skull. Another sally succeeded in destroying Robert&#39;s siege tower.<sup id="_ref-Norwich18_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Norwich18" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Robert&#39;s camp was struck by disease; according to contemporary historian <a href="/wiki/Anna_Comnena" id="w">Anna Comnena</a> up to 10,000 men died, including 500 knights.<sup id="_ref-Anna Comnena4.3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anna Comnena4.3" title="">[16]</a></sup> Even so, the situation of the Dyrrhachium garrison grew desperate due to the effects of Norman siege weapons. Alexius learned of this while he was in <a href="/wiki/Salonica" id="w">Salonica</a> with his army so he advanced in full force against the Normans. According to Comnena, Alexius had about 20,000 men; historian John Haldon puts the army&#39;s size between 18,000 to 20,000 men. It consisted of <a href="/wiki/Thrace" id="w">Thracian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Macedonia_(region)" id="w">Macedonian</a> <a href="/wiki/Tagma" id="w">tagmata</a>, which numbered about 5,000 men; the elite <a href="/wiki/Excubitors" id="w">excubitors</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vestiaritae" id="w">vestiaritae</a> units, which numbered around 1,000 men; a force of so-called Manichaeans (<a href="/wiki/Bogomil" id="w">Bogomil</a> heretics organized into military units), which comprised 2,800 men, <a href="/wiki/Thessaly" id="w">Thessalian</a> <a href="/wiki/Cavalry" id="w">cavalry</a>, Balkan <a href="/wiki/Conscription" id="w">conscripts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Armenia" id="w">Armenian</a> <a href="/wiki/Infantry" id="w">infantry</a> and other light troops. As well as the native troops, the Byzantines were joined by 2,000 <a href="/wiki/Seljuk_Turks" id="w">Turkish</a> and 1,000 Frankish <a href="/wiki/Mercenary" id="w">mercenaries</a>, about 1,000 <a href="/wiki/Varangian" id="w">Varangians</a> and 7,000 Turkish <a href="/wiki/Auxiliary" id="w">auxiliaries</a> sent by the <a href="/wiki/Seljuk_Sultanate_of_R%C3%BBm" id="w">Seljuk Sultan of Rum</a>. Alexius also withdrew the tagmas from <a href="/wiki/Heraclea_Pontica" id="w">Heraclea Pontica</a> and the remaining Byzantine holdings in <a href="/wiki/Asia_Minor" id="w">Asia Minor</a> and by doing so, he effectively left them to be over run by the Turks.<sup id="_ref-N18-J_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N18-J" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>Alexius advanced from Salonica and pitched camp on the river <a href="/wiki/Charzanes" id="w">Charzanes</a> near Dyrrhachium on <a href="/wiki/October_15" id="w">October 15</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> He held a war council there and sought advice from his senior officers; among them was George Palaeologus, who had managed to sneak out of the city.<sup id="_ref-Haldon134_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haldon134" title="">[18]</a></sup> A majority of the senior officers, including Palaeologus, urged caution, noting that time was with the Emperor. Alexius, however, favoured an immediate assault, hoping to catch Guiscard&#39;s army from the rear, while they were still besieging the city. Alexius moved his army to the hills opposite the city, planning to attack the Normans the next day.<sup id="_ref-H134-J_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H134-J" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Guiscard, however, had been informed of Alexius&#39; arrival by his scouts and on the night of the <a href="/wiki/October_17" id="w">October 17</a>, he moved his army from the peninsula to the mainland. Upon learning of Guiscard&#39;s move, Alexius revised his battle plan. He split his army into three divisions, with the left wing under the command of <a href="/wiki/Gregorios_Pakourianios" id="w">Gregorios Pakourianios</a>, the right wing under the command of <a href="/wiki/Nikephoros_Melissenos" id="w">Nicephorus Melissenus</a>, and himself in command of the centre. Guiscard formed his battle line opposite Alexius&#39;, with the right wing under the command of the <a href="/wiki/Count_of_Giovinazzo" id="w">Count of Giovinazzo</a>, the left under Bohemond and Guiscard facing Alexius in the centre.<sup id="_ref-H134-J_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H134-J" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Varangians had been ordered to march just in front of the main line with a strong division of archers a little behind them.<sup id="_ref-Haldon134_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haldon134" title="">[18]</a></sup> The archers had been commanded to move in front of the Varangians and fire a <a href="/wiki/Volley" id="w">volley</a> before retreating behind them. The archers continued this tactic until the army neared contact.<sup id="_ref-H134-J_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H134-J" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the opposing armies closed in, Guiscard sent a detachment of cavalry positioned in the centre to feint an attack on the Byzantine positions. Guiscard hoped the feint would draw up the Varangians; however, this plan failed when the cavalry was forced back by the archers. The Norman right wing suddenly charged forward to the point where the Byzantine left and centre met, directing its attack against the Varangian left flank. The Varangians stood their ground while the Byzantine left, including some of Alexius&#39; elite troops, attacked the Normans. The Norman formation disintegrated and the routed Normans fled towards the beach. There, according to Comnena, they were rallied by Guiscard&#39;s wife, <a href="/wiki/Sikelgaita" id="w">Sikelgaita</a>, described as &#34;like another <a href="/wiki/Pallas" id="w">Pallas</a>, if not a second <a href="/wiki/Athena" id="w">Athena</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-H134-J_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H134-J" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The Varangian guard.</div></p>
<p>In the meantime, the Byzantine right and centre had been engaging in <a href="/wiki/Skirmish" id="w">skirmishes</a> with the Normans opposite them. However, with the collapse of the Norman right, the knights were danger of being outflanked. At this point, the Varangians (mainly <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxons" id="w">Anglo-Saxons</a> who had left <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> after the <a href="/wiki/Norman_Conquest" id="w">Norman Conquest</a>) joined in the pursuit of the Norman right. With their massive <a href="/wiki/Battle_axe" id="w">battle axes</a>, the Varangians attacked the Norman knights, who were driven away after their horses panicked. The Varangians soon became separated from the main force and exhausted so they were in no position to resist an assault. Guiscard sent a strong force of <a href="/wiki/Spearman" id="w">spearmen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Crossbowmen" id="w">crossbowmen</a> against the Varangian flank and inflicted heavy casualties on them. The few remaining Varangians fled into the church of the <a href="/wiki/Archangel_Michael" id="w">Archangel Michael</a>. The Normans immediately set the church on fire, and all Varangians perished in the blaze.<sup id="_ref-H135-J_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H135-J" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, George Palaeologus <a href="/wiki/Sortie" id="w">sortied</a> out of Dyrrhachium but failed to save the situation. Worse, Alexius&#39; <a href="/wiki/Vassal" id="w">vassal</a>, King <a href="/wiki/Constantine_Bodin" id="w">Constantine Bodin</a> of <a href="/wiki/Zeta" id="w">Zeta</a>, betrayed him.

<p>Deprived of his left wing (still in pursuit of the Norman right), Alexius was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before breaking into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. This charge broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which had been left unguarded, fell to the Normans.<sup id="_ref-H135-J_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H135-J" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Alexius and his guards resisted as long as they could before retreating. As they retreated, Alexius was separated from his guard and was attacked by Norman soldiers. While escaping he was wounded in his forehead and lost a lot of blood, but eventually made it back to <a href="/wiki/Ochrid" id="w">Ochrid</a>, where he regrouped his army.<sup id="_ref-H135-J_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H135-J" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>George Palaeologus had not been able to re-enter the city after the battle and left with the main force.
