<p><b><i>Casino Royale</i></b> (<a href="/wiki/2006_in_film" id="w">2006</a>) is the 21st film in the <a href="/wiki/James_Bond" id="w">James Bond</a> <a href="/wiki/James_Bond_(films)" id="w">series</a> and the first to star <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Craig" id="w">Daniel Craig</a> as <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" id="w">MI6</a> agent <a href="/wiki/James_Bond_(character)" id="w">James Bond</a>. Based on the <a href="/wiki/1953_in_literature" id="w">1953</a> <a href="/wiki/Casino_Royale_(novel)" id="w">novel of the same name</a> by <a href="/wiki/Ian_Fleming" id="w">Ian Fleming</a>, it was adapted by screenwriters <a href="/wiki/Neal_Purvis" id="w">Neal Purvis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Wade_(screenwriter)" id="w">Robert Wade</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Paul_Haggis" id="w">Paul Haggis</a> and directed by <a href="/wiki/Martin_Campbell" id="w">Martin Campbell</a>. </p>
<p>It is the third screen adaptation of the <i>Casino Royale</i> novel, which was previously produced as a <a href="/wiki/Casino_Royale_(Climax!)" id="w">1954 television episode</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Casino_Royale_(1967_film)" id="w">1967 satirical film</a>. However, the 2006 film is the only <a href="/wiki/EON_Productions" id="w">EON Productions</a> adaptation of Fleming&#39;s novel. It is a <a href="/wiki/Reboot_(continuity)" id="w">reboot</a> of the Bond franchise, establishing a new timeline and narrative framework not meant to precede any previous film.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> This not only frees the Bond franchise from more than forty years of continuity, but allows the film to show a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The film is set at the beginning of James Bond&#39;s career as Agent 007, having earned his <a href="/wiki/Licence_to_kill_(concept)" id="w">licence to kill</a>. After preventing a terrorist attack at Miami Airport, Bond falls for <a href="/wiki/Vesper_Lynd" id="w">Vesper Lynd</a>, the treasury agent assigned to provide the money he needs to foil a high-stakes poker tournament organized by <a href="/wiki/Le_Chiffre" id="w">Le Chiffre</a>.</p>
<p>The casting for the movie involved a widespread search for a new actor to portray James Bond, and significant controversy over Daniel Craig when he was eventually selected. Some <a href="/wiki/Pierce_Brosnan" id="w">Pierce Brosnan</a> fans threatened to boycott the film in protest.<sup id="_ref-Location2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Location2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Despite this, the film, and Daniel Craig&#39;s performance in particular, earned critical acclaim. <i>Casino Royale</i> was produced by EON Productions for <a href="/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" id="w">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" id="w">Columbia Pictures</a>, marking the first official Bond film to be co-produced by the latter studio, which had produced and originally distributed the 1967 <a href="/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" id="w">non-canonical</a> film version.
<i>Casino Royale</i> is the highest grossing James Bond film to date,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> the <a href="/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films" id="w">38th highest-grossing film of all time</a>,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> and the 6th highest grossing film of all time in the <a href="/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h1>Plot</h1>
<p>In the opening sequence, James Bond corners and kills corrupt <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" id="w">MI6</a> section chief <a href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_henchmen_in_Casino_Royale#Dryden" id="w">Dryden</a> in his office in <a href="/wiki/Prague" id="w">Prague</a>, having already killed Dryden&#39;s contact <a href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_henchmen_in_Casino_Royale#Fisher" id="w">Fisher</a>. With his first two kills on his record, Bond secures his double-0 status. Elsewhere in Africa, <a href="/wiki/Mr._White_(James_Bond)" id="w">Mr. White</a> arranges a meeting between a banker, <a href="/wiki/Le_Chiffre" id="w">Le Chiffre</a>, and the leader of a guerrilla group seeking a safe haven for his funds. Le Chiffre assures the leader that there is &#34;no risk in the portfolio&#34;, but his investments actually involve considerable risk: he <a href="/wiki/Short_(finance)" id="w">short sells</a> successful companies and then engineers terrorist attacks to sink their stock values.</p>
<p>In his first mission as Agent 007, Bond goes to Madagascar in pursuit of an international bomb-maker named <a href="/wiki/Mollaka" id="w">Mollaka</a>. After a <a href="/wiki/Free_running" id="w">free running</a><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> chase across the city to the <a href="/wiki/List_of_fictional_countries" id="w">Nambutu</a> embassy, Bond kills his target and blows up a part of the embassy to enable his escape. He obtains Mollaka&#39;s mobile phone and discovers that it has received calls from <a href="/wiki/Alex_Dimitrios" id="w">Alex Dimitrios</a>, an associate of Le Chiffre in the Bahamas. Bond travels there and seduces Dimitrios&#39; wife, <a href="/wiki/Solange_Dimitrios" id="w">Solange</a>, who reveals that her husband is flying to Miami on business. Bond follows him to Miami, where he kills Dimitrios before noticing Le Chiffre&#39;s henchman <a href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_henchmen_in_Casino_Royale#Carlos" id="w">Carlos</a> leaving for the Miami Airport. There, Bond foils Le Chiffre&#39;s plan to destroy the prototype <a href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_vehicles#Aircraft" id="w">&#39;&#39;Skyfleet&#39;&#39; airliner</a>, leaving the banker with a major financial loss, since he had shorted and bought <a href="/wiki/Put_options" id="w">put options</a> on Skyfleet stock which expired worthless.</p>
<p>Now under pressure to recoup his clients&#39; money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes <a href="/wiki/Texas_hold_%26%2339%3Bem" id="w">Texas hold &#39;em</a> tournament at the Casino Royale in <a href="/wiki/Montenegro" id="w">Montenegro</a>. Hoping that a defeat would force Le Chiffre to aid the British government in exchange for protection from his creditors, MI6 enters Bond into the tournament. He meets up with Mathis, his ally in Montenegro, and Vesper Lynd, a treasury agent, who is assigned to look after his handling of the $10 million <a href="/wiki/Buy-in" id="w">buy-in</a>. As the tournament progresses, Bond loses his initial stake and becomes enraged when Vesper refuses to authorize his subsequent buy-in because of his reckless style of play.

<div class="thumbcaption">Bond (right) and Le Chiffre (left) gamble at the Casino Royale.</div>
Distraught over his failure, Bond prepares to assassinate Le Chiffre when he is intercepted by <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" id="w">CIA</a> officer <a href="/wiki/Felix_Leiter" id="w">Felix Leiter</a>, also playing in the tournament. Leiter offers to supply Bond with the funds to re-enter the tournament in exchange for allowing the CIA custody of Le Chiffre. Back in the game, Bond rapidly recoups his losses when Le Chiffre and his associates attempt to poison him, an attempt Bond narrowly survives before winning the tournament. Following her celebratory dinner with Bond, Vesper is abducted by Le Chiffre, who uses her to lure Bond into a near-fatal car chase and ultimate capture. Le Chiffre tortures Bond for the access code to the game&#39;s winnings and when it becomes clear that Bond will not yield, Le Chiffre prepares to castrate him when Mr. White enters and kills Le Chiffre and his associates for their failure. Bond and Vesper are left alive.</p>
<p>Bond awakens in a hospital on <a href="/wiki/Lake_Como" id="w">Lake Como</a> and orders Mathis, whom Le Chiffre identified as a <a href="/wiki/Double_agent" id="w">double agent</a> working for him, arrested. Bond admits his love for Vesper and vows to quit the service before it strips him of his humanity. Accordingly, he posts his resignation to M and goes on a romantic holiday in Venice with Vesper. However, Bond soon learns that his poker winnings were never deposited into the Treasury&#39;s account. Realizing that Vesper has stolen them, he pursues her and members of the organization she is working for into a building under renovation. After killing the henchmen in the building, Bond finds Vesper imprisoned in an elevator. Apologizing to him tearfully, she locks the inside door and the elevator plunges underwater. Bond dives in and attempts to rescue her, but she resists him and <a href="/wiki/Suicide" id="w">drowns</a>. Mr. White, watching from a balcony, walks away with the money.</p>
<p>Bond, feeling betrayed, learns from <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" id="w">M</a> that Vesper had a French-Algerian boyfriend who was kidnapped and held for ransom by the organization behind Le Chiffre and Mr White. Bond learns that she agreed to deliver the ransom money (his winnings) only if they would consent to leave Bond alive as well as her boyfriend. He discovers White&#39;s name and number in Vesper&#39;s mobile phone. White, arriving at a palatial estate near <a href="/wiki/Lake_Como" id="w">Lake Como</a>, receives a phone call. A voice on the line says, &#34;Mr. White? We need to talk.&#34; Upon asking &#34;Who is this?&#34;, Mr. White is shot in the leg. As he crawls painfully towards the villa, Bond appears, gun in hand, and responds, &#34;The name&#39;s Bond, James Bond.&#34;</p>

<p>Two major exclusions from the film are the characters of <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" id="w">Q</a> and <a href="/wiki/Miss_Moneypenny" id="w">Miss Moneypenny</a>. Their exclusion makes <i>Casino Royale</i> the second film in the series without Q (<i><a href="/wiki/Live_and_Let_Die_(film)" id="w">Live and Let Die</a></i> being the first), and the first without Moneypenny. In October 2005, producer Michael G. Wilson stated that the characters were not in the movie because they were not in the book, though Moneypenny was mentioned by Bond in the novel. The decision to leave Moneypenny&#39;s character out from the film coincided with the announcement by actress <a href="/wiki/Samantha_Bond" id="w">Samantha Bond</a>, who had portrayed the character in the previous four films, that she would not be reprising the role.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

He explained, &#34;the draft that was there was very faithful to the book. And there was a confession. So in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself.

In the June 2007 issue of <i><a href="/wiki/GQ" id="w">GQ</a></i> (UK) Tarantino confirmed his desire to make <i>Casino Royale</i> after <i><a href="/wiki/Pulp_Fiction" id="w">Pulp Fiction</a></i>. Tarantino claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believes that this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with <i>Casino Royale</i>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> In February 2005, Martin Campbell was announced as the film&#39;s director.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Later in 2005, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with this film.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>EON admitted that they had relied too heavily on <a href="/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" id="w">CGI</a> effects in the more recent films, particularly <i>Die Another Day</i>, and were keen to accomplish the stunts in <i>Casino Royale</i> &#34;the old fashioned way&#34;.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> In keeping with this drive for more realism, screenwriters Purvis, Wade, and Haggis wanted the script to follow as closely as possible to the original 1953 novel, keeping Fleming&#39;s darker storyline and characterization of Bond.<sup id="_ref-cinematographer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cinematographer" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Casino Royale</i> became the first Bond film to take its title from a Fleming novel or short story since 1987&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Living_Daylights" id="w">The Living Daylights</a></i>.

<a id="Casting" name="Casting"></a><h2>Casting</h2>
<p>Throughout 2004 and 2005, a whole legion of potential new actors to portray James Bond were speculated on by the media, ranging from established Hollywood actors, such as <a href="/wiki/Eric_Bana" id="w">Eric Bana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Jackman" id="w">Hugh Jackman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Goran_Vi%C5%A1nji%C4%87" id="w">Goran Višnjić</a> and <a href="/wiki/Clive_Owen" id="w">Clive Owen</a>, to many unknown actors from a number of different countries.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> At one point producer <a href="/wiki/Michael_G._Wilson" id="w">Michael G. Wilson</a> claimed there was a list of over 200 names being considered.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> English actor <a href="/wiki/Colin_Salmon" id="w">Colin Salmon</a>, who had played the role of MI6 operative <a href="/wiki/Charles_Robinson_(James_Bond)" id="w">Charles Robinson</a> in earlier Bond films alongside Pierce Brosnan, was also considered for the role and raised speculation that he might become the first black Bond.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> According to Martin Campbell, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Cavill" id="w">Henry Cavill</a> was the only actor in serious contention for the role. But being only 22 years old at the time, he was considered too young.<sup id="_ref-cast2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cast2" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>In May 2005, Daniel Craig announced that MGM and producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured him that he would get the role of Bond, and <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Vaughn" id="w">Matthew Vaughn</a> told reporters that MGM offered him the opportunity to direct, but EON Productions at that point had not approached either of them.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Later, Craig stated that the producers had indeed offered him the role, but he had declined until a script was available for him to read.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>By August 2005, speculation was high that the 37-year-old Daniel Craig was being seriously considered, although full casting for the role was not actually done until September. Then, on <a href="/wiki/October_14" id="w">October 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, EON Productions and Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed to the public at a press conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray James Bond.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Significant controversy followed the decision, as it was doubted if the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period Internet campaigns such as &#34;danielcraigisnotbond.com&#34; expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed.<sup id="_ref-Location2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Location2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The next important casting was that of the lead <a href="/wiki/Bond_girl" id="w">Bond girl</a>, Vesper Lynd.

<p>In designing the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Kleinman" id="w">Daniel Kleinman</a> was inspired by the cover of the 1953 British first edition of <i>Casino Royale</i>, which featured Ian Fleming&#39;s original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood.<sup id="_ref-book_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-book" title="">[40]</a></sup> Kleinman said, &#34;The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond&#39;s love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles,&#34; like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitized the footage of Craig and the film&#39;s stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at the Framestore CFC in London; the actors&#39; silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns.<sup id="_ref-cfc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cfc" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>For the rest of the film, Special Effects and Miniature Effects Supervisor <a href="/wiki/Chris_Corbould" id="w">Chris Corbould</a>, as with the producers, wanted to return to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduce digital effects. According to Corbould, “CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It’s the best way to go”.<sup id="_ref-Real_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Real" title="">[31]</a></sup> Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the Miami Airport chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios.<sup id="_ref-Real_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Real" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>First on the schedule were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i>.<sup id="_ref-Real_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Real" title="">[31]</a></sup> In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger, and reinforced with steel.<sup id="_ref-Real_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Real" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>The sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports.<sup id="_ref-Real_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Real" title="">[31]</a></sup> In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden, and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.<sup id="_ref-Real_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Real" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>The sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film.<sup id="_ref-Real_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Real" title="">[31]</a></sup> For the scene involving Bond following Vesper into the house undergoing renovation supported by inflatable balloons, a tank was constructed at the 007 stage at Pinewood, consisting of a Venetian piazza and the interior of the three-story dilapidated house. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves which were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model which the effects team built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model elevator within the rig could be immersed in 19 feet of water, and utilized banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.<sup id="_ref-Real_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Real" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>The scene involving the car crash was devised using an <a href="/wiki/Aston_Martin_DBS_V12" id="w">Aston Martin DBS V12</a>, specially modified and reinforced to withstand the impact. Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450 mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at <a href="/wiki/General_Motors_Proving_Grounds#Millbrook Proving Grounds" id="w">Millbrook Proving Grounds</a> and stunt driver Adam Kirley had to use an air cannon located behind the driver&#39;s seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding <span style="white-space:nowrap">70&#160;mph&#160;(113&#160;km/h)</span>, the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the <a href="/wiki/Guinness_Book_of_Records" id="w">Guinness Book of Records</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_5" id="w">November 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> as a new <a href="/wiki/World_Record" id="w">World Record</a>.<sup id="_ref-Real_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Real" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

<p>Only two days following the premiere, pirated copies appeared for sale in London. “The rapid appearance of this film on the streets shows the sophistication and organisation behind film piracy in the UK,” said Kieron Sharp, from the Federation Against Copyright Theft.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> Pirated copies of the DVD were selling for less than £1. Craig himself was offered such a DVD while walking anonymously through the streets of <a href="/wiki/Beijing" id="w">Beijing</a> wearing a hat and glasses in order to avoid being identified.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>The film achieved <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" id="w">GB£1</a>.7 million of ticket sales in the UK on its first day of release, grossing more than twice as much as the former record-holder <i>Die Another Day</i>, and becoming the highest UK take for any Bond film.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> Weekend opening total in the UK was GB£13,400,000, surpassing the previous record of GB£9,100,000 held by <i>Die Another Day</i>. It claimed the third biggest opening weekend and became the sixth highest grossing film of all time in the UK with a box office total of approximately $108-$109 million.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> (the total USA box office was approximately US$170 million).The film also had the biggest Bond opening in the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" id="w">Republic of Ireland</a> with over <a href="/wiki/Euro" id="w">€1</a>,100,000 in the first 2 weeks.

<p>Opening day estimates in the United States and Canada showed <i>Casino Royale</i> on top with $14,750,000, while opening weekend estimates showed it in the second place with $40,600,000,<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> as well as earning another $42,000,000 internationally. Although <i><a href="/wiki/Happy_Feet" id="w">Happy Feet</a></i> won the overall weekend box office contest, such a comparison in earnings is problematic, as <i>Happy Feet</i> has little more than half the running time of <i>Casino Royale</i>, and therefore had significantly more screenings per day, which translates into more potential gross. A better indication of the film&#39;s relative performances is that <i>Casino Royale</i>, per theatre, outperformed <i>Happy Feet</i>, which was released in 370 more theatres.

<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h1>Reception</h1>
<p>Critics gave the film a positive response, in particular Craig&#39;s performance and credibility. During production this had been subject to debate by the media and the public, as Craig did not appear to fit Ian Fleming&#39;s original portrait of the character as tall, dark, and suave. <i>The Daily Mirror</i>, which had once run a front page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, <i>The Name&#39;s Bland &#8212; James Bland</i>,<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" id="w">The Daily Telegraph</a></i> compared the quality of Craig&#39;s characterization of Bond to <a href="/wiki/Sean_Connery" id="w">Sean Connery</a>&#39;s; while the Telegraph praised the script as smartly written, noting how the film departed from the series&#39; conventions. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" id="w">The Times</a></i> compared the more assertive portrayal by Craig to <a href="/wiki/Timothy_Dalton" id="w">Timothy Dalton</a>, and praised the action as edgy,<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> with another reviewer citing in particular the action sequence involving the cranes in Madagascar.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> Critic Paul Arendt of BBC Films,<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Kim_Newman" id="w">Kim Newman</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Empire_(magazine)" id="w">Empire</a></i><sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> and Todd McCarthy of <i><a href="/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" id="w">Variety</a></i><sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> all described Craig as the first actor to truly embody Ian Fleming&#39;s James Bond from the original novel: ironic, brutal, and cold.</p>
<p>The film was similarly well received in North America. <a href="/wiki/MSNBC" id="w">MSNBC</a> gave the movie a perfect <a href="/wiki/5_star" id="w">5 star</a> rating.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> The film was described as taking James Bond &#34;back to his roots&#34;, similar to <i>From Russia with Love</i>,<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> where the focus was on character and plot rather than the high-tech gadgets and visual effects that were strongly criticised in <i>Die Another Day</i>.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" id="w">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gave the movie an aggregate rating of 94%, the highest rating for a wide-release of the year.
