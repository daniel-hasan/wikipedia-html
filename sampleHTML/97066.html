<p>The <b>National Flag of Canada</b>, popularly known as the <b>Maple Leaf</b> and <b>l&#39;Unifolié</b> (<a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a> for &#34;the one-leafed&#34;) , is a base red <a href="/wiki/Flag" id="w">flag</a> with a white square in its centre featuring a stylized, 11-pointed, red <a href="/wiki/Maple_leaf" id="w">maple leaf</a>. Before this flag, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> used variants of the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Red_Ensign" id="w">Red Ensign</a> with the shield of Canada charged in the fly. The Red Ensign that took familiar shape in Canada was introduced by <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada" id="w">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King" id="w">Mackenzie King</a> after the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">First World War</a>. From the 1940s until 1965, Canada made several attempts to create its own flag by holding national contests, but the Red Ensign still flew for Canada. A serious <a href="/wiki/Great_Flag_Debate" id="w">debate about a flag change</a> did not occur until 1964, when a committee was picked by Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson" id="w">Lester B. Pearson</a>. Out of three choices, the maple leaf design by <a href="/wiki/George_Stanley" id="w">George F.G. Stanley</a> was chosen as the winner. The flag made its first appearance on <a href="/wiki/February_15" id="w">February 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1965" id="w">1965</a>, which is now celebrated annually as <a href="/wiki/National_Flag_of_Canada_Day" id="w">Flag Day</a>.</p>
<p>Other than the Maple Leaf flag, several other flags have been created to be used by Canadian officials, government bodies, and military forces. Most of these flags contain the Maple Leaf motif in some fashion; either by having the Canadian flag charged in the canton or by inclusion of maple leaves in the design.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Union_Flag" id="w">Royal Union Flag</a> is also an official flag in Canada, used as a symbol of Canada&#39;s membership in the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth of Nations</a> and of her allegiance to the Crown. The Royal Union Flag forms a component of the flags of several <a href="/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada" id="w">provinces</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Quebec" id="w">Quebec</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Quebec" id="w">provincial flag</a> (a blue cross with four <a href="/wiki/Fleurs-de-lis" id="w">fleurs-de-lis</a>) is often considered a national flag along with the Maple Leaf flag, as is the <a href="/wiki/Acadian" id="w">Acadian</a> flag in the Acadian regions of the <a href="/wiki/Maritime_provinces" id="w">Maritime provinces</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The current flag of Canada was approved by the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons" id="w">House of Commons</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_15" id="w">December 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1964" id="w">1964</a>, and by the <a href="/wiki/Senate_of_Canada" id="w">Senate</a> two days later. The flag was later approved by <a href="/wiki/Monarch" id="w">Queen</a> <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Elizabeth II</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_monarchy" id="w">Queen of Canada</a>, an order which took effect on <a href="/wiki/February_15" id="w">February 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1965" id="w">1965</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The national flag is also employed as the naval ensign for Canadian ships and military vessels. </p>
<p>In 1921, King <a href="/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George V</a> proclaimed the official colours of Canada as red, from <a href="/wiki/Saint_George%26%2339%3Bs_Cross" id="w">Saint George&#39;s Cross</a>, and white, from the <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> royal emblem since King <a href="/wiki/Charles_VII_of_France" id="w">Charles VII</a>.</p>
<p>As early as 1700, the maple leaf served as a symbol celebrating the nature and environment of what is now Canada. The number of points on the leaf has no significance; they do not, for instance, represent the ten provinces plus one point for the territories such as the Australian <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_Star" id="w">Commonwealth Star</a> denotes. In fact, some of the very first Canadian flags made had maple leaves of variously 13 and 15 points or more. The points of the maple leaf were determined by taking various designs and putting them in a wind tunnel to see what looks the best while moving.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The length of the flag is twice the width of the flag.  The white field is a <a href="/wiki/Canadian_pale" id="w">Canadian pale</a> (a square central band in a vertical triband flag, named after this flag) , and each bordering red field is exactly half its size.  </p>

The Royal Union Flag, called the <a href="/wiki/Union_Flag" id="w">Union Flag</a> (or, commonly, Union Jack) in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>, was used as a <i>de jure</i> flag until the adoption of the current flag in 1965.  It remains an official Canadian flag, being flown on certain specific occasions.</p>
<p>Currently, regulations require federal installations to fly the Union Flag beside the Maple Leaf where physical arrangements exist (i.e., a second flagpole) on the following days: <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_Day" id="w">Commonwealth Day</a> (the second Monday in March) , <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Day" id="w">Victoria Day</a> (which is also the Sovereign&#39;s official birthday in Canada) , and the anniversary of the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster" id="w">Statute of Westminster</a> (<a href="/wiki/December_11" id="w">December 11</a>). The Union Flag can also be flown at the National War Memorial or at other locations during ceremonies that honour Canadian involvement with forces of other Commonwealth nations during times of war.  The Maple Leaf Flag always precedes the Union Flag, the former occupying the place of honour.</p>
<p>The Union Flag is also part of the provincial <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Ontario" id="w">flags of Ontario</a> and <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Manitoba" id="w">Manitoba</a>, forming the canton of these flags. A modified version is used on the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_British_Columbia" id="w">flag of British Columbia</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Newfoundland_and_Labrador" id="w">flag of Newfoundland and Labrador</a> is a stylized version of the Union Jack.</p>
<p>Several of the provincial <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-governor" id="w">lieutenant-governors</a> formerly used a modified Union Flag as their personal standard, but the <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-Governors_of_Nova_Scotia" id="w">Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia</a> is the only one who retains this design.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Union Flag and Canadian Red Ensign are still sometimes flown in Canada by veterans&#39; groups and others who continue to stress the importance of Canada&#39;s British heritage and the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth</a> connection.

<p>In 1963, the minority <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Liberal</a> government of <a href="/wiki/Lester_B._Pearson" id="w">Lester B. Pearson</a> gained power, and decided to adopt an official Canadian flag, through parliamentary debate.  The idea of an official national flag had been discussed for decades in the 20th century, particularly during the Liberal governments of <a href="/wiki/William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King" id="w">Mackenzie King</a>; indeed, during the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">Second World War</a> there was for a time an effort to create a national flag for Canadian troops to carry into battle, but in Pearson&#39;s words, &#34;It was a ridiculous design by some heraldic expert in National Defence, with all sorts of symbols on it.&#34; But it was not until the 1960s that the debate intensified and became a subject of considerable controversy culminating in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Flag_Debate" id="w">Great Flag Debate</a> of 1964.  The principal political proponent of the change was <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada" id="w">Prime Minister</a> Lester Pearson.  Pearson had been a significant broker during the Suez Crisis of 1956 (for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize). Pearson was disturbed when the Egyptian government objected to Canadian peacekeeping forces on the grounds that the Canadian flag (the Red Ensign) contained the flag (Union Jack) of the United Kingdom, one of the belligerents.  According to <i>Mike: The Memoirs of the Right Honourable Lester B. Pearson</i>, Pearson&#39;s principal concern was for the Canadian flag to be distinctive and unmistakably Canadian.  The main opponent to changing the flag was the <a href="/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Canada)" id="w">leader of the opposition</a> and former prime minister, <a href="/wiki/John_Diefenbaker" id="w">John Diefenbaker</a>, who eventually made the subject a personal crusade.</p>
<p>Pearson was leader on a minority Government and risked losing power over the issue; however, Pearson knew the Red Ensign with the Union Jack was unpopular in Quebec, a Liberal base of support. The Red Ensign was strongly favoured by rural English Canada, the heart of <a href="/wiki/Tory" id="w">Tory</a> support. On May 27, 1964, Pearson&#39;s minority Liberal government introduced a motion to Parliament for adoption of his personal favourite design of a  &#34;sea to sea&#34;  (Canada&#39;s motto) flag with blue borders and three conjoined red maple leaves on a white field.  This motion led to weeks of acrimonious debate in Parliament, and the design came to be known as the <i>Pearson Pennant</i>.  Diefenbaker demanded a referendum be held on the flag issue, but Pearson instead formed a 15-member multi-party parliamentary committee to select a new design. Through a period of study with some political manoeuvring, the committee chose the current design, which was created by <a href="/wiki/George_Stanley" id="w">George F.G. Stanley</a>, inspired by the flag of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Military_College_of_Canada" id="w">Royal Military College of Canada</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Kingston%2C_Ontario" id="w">Kingston, Ontario</a>. The ultimately favoured design with red bars and a single maple leaf was voted unanimously by the committee on <a href="/wiki/October_29" id="w">October 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/1964" id="w">1964</a>.  The new flag was passed by a majority vote in the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons" id="w">House of Commons</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_15" id="w">December 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1964" id="w">1964</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Senate" id="w">Senate</a> added its approval two days later.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Elizabeth II</a> proclaimed the new flag on <a href="/wiki/January_28" id="w">January 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1965" id="w">1965</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> It was inaugurated on <a href="/wiki/February_15" id="w">February 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1965" id="w">1965</a>, at an official ceremony held on <a href="/wiki/Parliament_Hill" id="w">Parliament Hill</a> in Ottawa in the presence of <a href="/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada" id="w">Governor General</a> Major-General <a href="/wiki/Georges_P._Vanier" id="w">Georges P. Vanier</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada" id="w">prime minister</a>, the members of the Cabinet, and Canadian parliamentarians. Since 1996, February 15 has been commemorated as <a href="/wiki/National_Flag_of_Canada_Day" id="w">National Flag of Canada Day</a>.<sup id="_ref-flagfest_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-flagfest" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Canadian Red Ensign, bearing the Union Jack and the shield of the royal arms of Canada, was lowered at the stroke of noon, and the new maple leaf flag was raised. The crowd sang the &#34;<a href="/wiki/O_Canada" id="w">O Canada</a>&#34; followed by the royal anthem, &#34;<a href="/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen" id="w">God Save the Queen</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-flagfest_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-flagfest" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Maurice_Bourget" id="w">Maurice Bourget</a>, Speaker of the Senate, said &#34;The flag is the symbol of the nation&#39;s unity, for it, beyond any doubt, represents all the citizens of Canada without distinction of race, language, belief or opinion.<sup id="_ref-flagfest_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-flagfest" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the preceding acrimony, the new flag was quickly embraced by the Canadian public, and internationally the flag quickly became a welcome and easily recognizable marker of Canada worldwide.</p>
<p>Attachment to the old Canadian Red Ensign persisted for quite a while for many people, especially veterans. In 1967 the Canadian government first used the Canadian coat of arms (whose shield was used on the red ensign) on a red flag for the nation&#39;s centennial celebrations.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> It was designed to appeal to those who were used to the Red Ensign and had not yet become accustomed to the Maple Leaf Flag. The Canadian Red Ensign itself can be frequently seen today across Canada, usually in connection to veteran&#39;s associations.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the Pearson Pennant itself can still be seen as a Canadian cultural marker. Most notably, in the 1990s <a href="/wiki/Martin_Tielli" id="w">Martin Tielli</a> of the Canadian rock band <a href="/wiki/Rheostatics" id="w">Rheostatics</a> often played a <a href="/wiki/Double_neck_guitar" id="w">double neck guitar</a> with a modified Pearson pennant painted on it. This guitar is pictured on the cover of the band&#39;s album <i><a href="/wiki/Double_Live_(Rheostatics_album)" id="w">Double Live</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Fate_of_the_first_Maple_Leaf_Flag" name="Fate_of_the_first_Maple_Leaf_Flag"></a><h2> Fate of the first Maple Leaf Flag </h2>

<p>The first Maple Leaf flag was sewn by Joan O&#39;Malley in November 1964.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> After this flag was first raised in February 1965, it was said that Prime Minister Pearson gave it to the Liberal caucus. On February 15, 2000, a ceremony was held in which the Chair of the National Liberal Caucus presented <a href="/wiki/Sheila_Copps" id="w">Sheila Copps</a>, then <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_Canadian_Heritage" id="w">Minister of Canadian Heritage</a>, with that flag.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> However, what is also said to be the first Maple Leaf Flag was discovered in 2005. That Maple Leaf Flag had been given to then <a href="/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Canadian_House_of_Commons" id="w">Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lucien_Lamoureux" id="w">Lucien Lamoureux</a>. Mr. Lamoureux was later appointed as Canada&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ambassador" id="w">ambassador</a> to <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a>. After his death and some delay, the flag was returned to Canada.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Protocol" name="Protocol"></a><h1> Protocol </h1>

<p>Officially, there is no law that dictates the proper use of the Canadian flag. However, <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Heritage" id="w">Canadian Heritage</a> released guidelines on how to correctly display the flag alone or with other flags. The guidelines deal with the order of precedence the Canadian flag is placed, where the flag can be used and how it is used and what people should do to honour the flag. The suggestions, titled <i>Flag Etiquette in Canada,</i> were published by Canadian Heritage in a book and online format, which had a last update at April of 2003.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> 
Canada follows guidelines set forth by the United Nations. With the weather permitting, the flag itself can be displayed on any day at buildings operated by the Canadian government, airports, military bases and diplomatic offices, as well as by citizens, during any time of the day. When flying the flag, it must be flown using its own pole and must not be inferior to other flags, save for, in descending order, the <a href="/wiki/Queen%26%2339%3Bs_Personal_Canadian_Flag" id="w">Queen&#39;s Personal Standard</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_the_Governor_General_of_Canada" id="w">Governor General&#39;s Standard</a>, any of the Personal Standards of members of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_monarchy#Canadian Royal Family" id="w">Canadian Royal Family</a>, or flags of the <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-Governor_(Canada)" id="w">Lieutenant Governors</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>When a flag is placed at the <a href="/wiki/Half-staff" id="w">half-mast</a> (or half-staff) position, it indicates <a href="/wiki/Mourning" id="w">mourning</a>. To raise a flag in this position, the flag must be flown to the top of the pole first, then brought down halfway before the flag is secured for flying. When such mourning occurs, all flags should be flown at that position or not be flown at all, with the exception of flags permanently attached to poles.</p>
<p>In Canada, the decision to fly the flag at half-mast on federal buildings rests with Canadian Heritage. For the flag to be half-masted nationwide, one of the following deaths must be announced:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Canadian_monarchy" id="w">Canadian monarch</a> – from the time of announcement of the death up to and including the <a href="/wiki/Funeral" id="w">funeral</a>. This clause includes members of the Royal Family related to the Sovereign by the first degree, such as a spouse, children, parents or siblings.</li>
<li>The current or former <a href="/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada" id="w">Governor General of Canada</a> </li>
<li>The current or former <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada" id="w">Prime Minister of Canada</a></li>
<li>A current minister of the federal cabinet</li></ul>
<p>Each province can make its own determination of when to half-mast the flag when provincial leaders or honoured citizens pass away. Canadian Heritage has the right to half-mast the flag under extraordinary circumstances, such as honouring former American President <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" id="w">Ronald Reagan</a> or for international events as the <a href="/wiki/September_11th_attacks" id="w">September 11th attacks</a> in 2001. </p>
<p>There are certain days every year that will call for the national flag to be flown at half-mast. These include:</p>

<p>A controversy surfaced in April 2006 when the newly-elected <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Conservative</a> government discontinued the practice, initiated by the previous <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Liberal</a> government, of flying the flag at half-mast on all government buildings whenever a Canadian soldier was killed in action in <a href="/wiki/Canada%26%2339%3Bs_role_in_the_invasion_of_Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The policy of half-masting upon every death had been initiated after the <a href="/wiki/Tarnak_Farm_incident" id="w">Tarnak Farm incident</a>.</p>
<p>The issue divided veterans&#39; groups and military families, some of whom supported the return to the original tradition of using Remembrance Day to honour all soldiers killed in action, while others who felt that it was an appropriate way to honour the fallen and to remind the population of the costs of war.</p>
<p>In spite of the federal government&#39;s policy, local authorities have often decided to half-mast the national flag since then to honour fallen soldiers who were from their jurisdiction. Examples include <a href="/wiki/Toronto" id="w">Toronto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saskatchewan" id="w">Saskatchewan</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Government_promotion" name="Government_promotion"></a><h1> Government promotion </h1>
<p>Ever since the adoption of the Canadian flag in 1965, there have been programs sponsored by the Canadian government to promote the flag to their citizens and to the world at large. Two of the most famous examples is the Heritage Department&#39;s Parliamentary Flag Program and the flag program run by the <a href="/wiki/Public_Works_and_Government_Services_Canada" id="w">Department of Public Works</a>. The flag has also been featured on several <a href="/wiki/Definitive_stamp" id="w">definitive stamp</a> series issued by <a href="/wiki/Canada_Post" id="w">Canada Post</a> since 1989.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>
This increased exposure of the Canadian flag and the flag as part of the Canadian identity at home and abroad through the circulation of postage stamps. </p>
<p>To increase awareness of the new flag, the Parliamentary Flag Program was set up in December 1972 by the Cabinet. The purpose of this program was to allow members of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons" id="w">Canadian House of Commons</a> to distribute flags and lapel pins in the shape of the Canadian flag to their constituents. The program has been in operation since 1973.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Flags that are flown from the <a href="/wiki/Peace_Tower" id="w">Peace Tower</a>, the East and West blocks of <a href="/wiki/Parliament_Hill" id="w">Parliament Hill</a> are packaged by the Department of Public Works and can be obtained free of charge. However, the program has a waiting list that lasts about 11 years for East and West block flag and an 20-year waiting list for a Peace Tower flag.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1996, <a href="/wiki/Sheila_Copps" id="w">Sheila Copps</a>, as the Minister of <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Heritage" id="w">Canadian Heritage</a> instituted the &#34;One in a Million National Flag&#34; Challenge<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>. This program was intended to provide Canadians with one million new Maple Leaf flags in time for Flag Day, 1997. The program was controversial in that the program cost approximately <a href="/wiki/Canadian_dollar" id="w">CDN</a>$45 million and the flags had no means to be hoisted or flown. The official numbers from Canadian Heritage put the expenses around $15.5 million, with approximately 1/7th of the cost being off-set by donations.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
