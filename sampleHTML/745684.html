<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>The earliest known residents of the area that would become Douglaston were the <a href="/wiki/Matinecock_(tribe)" id="w">Matinecock</a> <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native Americans</a>. Early <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Dutch</a> settlers were drawn to the area by the rich land and abundant fishing. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hicks" id="w">Thomas Hicks</a> settled the area in 1656 on a peninsula first called <b>Little Madnan&#39;s Neck</b>. In 1796, his estate passed to <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Wickes" id="w">Thomas Wickes</a>, and in 1819, to Wyant Van Zandt, a wealthy merchant, who built a large <a href="/wiki/Greek_Revival" id="w">Greek Revival</a> mansion in the area. (Today, this mansion houses the <a href="/wiki/Douglaston_Yacht_Club" id="w">Douglaston Yacht Club</a>.)<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> In 1835, George Douglas bought 240 <a href="/wiki/Acre" id="w">acres</a> of land along with Van Zandt&#39;s mansion. Upon Douglas&#39; death in 1862, the land was inherited by his son, William Douglas. Four years later, the North Shore Railroad extended its service to the area. William Douglas donated an outbuilding for use as the station house, and in thanks, the railroad named its new stop &#34;Douglaston&#34;, which soon was taken on as the name of the community.</p>
<p>Douglaston Hill is the oldest area of the community, and is characterized by turn-of-the-20th-century homes in <a href="/wiki/Queen_Anne_Style_architecture" id="w">Queen Anne</a> and <a href="/wiki/Victorian_architecture" id="w">Victorian</a> styles. It was laid out with very large lots in 1853, at the very beginning of a movement in the United States to create suburban gardens. The area was recognized as an Historic District of New York City in December 2004 by the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Landmarks_Preservation_Commission" id="w">New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the early 20th century, the Rickert-Finlay Realty Company of <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" id="w">Manhattan</a> purchased 175 acres of the Douglas&#39; family holdings, and formed the Douglas Manor Association, creating a planned community. Many of the houses in this area were built in architectural styles popular at the time, such as <a href="/wiki/Tudor_Style_architecture" id="w">Tudor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Revival_Style_architecture" id="w">Mediterranean</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colonial_Revival_architecture" id="w">Colonial Revival</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement" id="w">Arts and Crafts</a>. In 1997, New York City&#39;s Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Douglas Manor as the Douglaston Historic District, ensuring that no new buildings or external alterations could be made without the commission&#39;s approval.{{fact}}</p>
<p>Other areas of Douglaston were developed during the latter half of the 20th Century. Douglaston Park contains a mixture of large, older homes as well as <a href="/wiki/Cape_Cod_(house)" id="w">Capes</a>, Tudors, and <a href="/wiki/Ranch_house" id="w">ranch-style</a> homes dating from the 1960s. The areas adjacent to the <a href="/wiki/Douglaston%2C_Queens#Local economy" id="w">Douglaston Shopping Center</a> are comprised mainly of attached single-family homes built in the early-1970s, as well as four-story <a href="/wiki/Condominium" id="w">condominiums</a> added in the mid-1980s.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Because northern Douglaston is surrounded by water many residents take advantage of the waterfront.
