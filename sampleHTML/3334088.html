It is the home ground of the <a href="/wiki/National_Rugby_League" id="w">National Rugby League</a> club the <a href="/wiki/North_Queensland_Cowboys" id="w">North Queensland Cowboys</a>.

<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> History </h2>
<a id="Willows_Sporting_Complex" name="Willows_Sporting_Complex"></a><h3>Willows Sporting Complex</h3>
<p>Prior to <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a> the stadium site was occupied by the Willows Sporting Complex. It hosted trotting paceway nights, and was the main pacing venue for the Townsville and Thuringowa District. With the admission of the North Queensland Cowboys to the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Rugby_League" id="w">Australian Rugby League</a> competition in 1995, the Willows site was transformed into a basic rugby league venue with a western and eastern grandstand as well as eastern side terraces. The northern and southern ends were sloped grass hills.</p>
<a id="Stockland_Stadium" name="Stockland_Stadium"></a><h3>Stockland Stadium</h3>

<p>The Willows Sports Complex was renamed &#39;Stockland Stadium&#39; in 1995 through sponsorship linked with the <a href="/wiki/North_Queensland_Cowboys" id="w">North Queensland Cowboys</a>. A contract was signed by the Stockland Trust Group for three years giving them the naming rights of the venue. The Joint Board of the old Willows Sports Complex (<a href="/wiki/City_of_Townsville" id="w">Townsville City Council</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thuringowa" id="w">Thuringowa</a> City Council) sub-leased the facility to the Cowboys Rugby League Football Limited, who manage the venue on a day to day basis. The first stage of development was funded by a combination of borrowings by the Joint Board, the <a href="/wiki/Queensland_Government" id="w">Queensland Government</a> Grants and a considerable amount of Community and Business donations.</p>
<p>The stadium was first used for any type of football for the North Queensland Cowboys first home game which attracted a crowd of 23,156, a good crowd by <a href="/wiki/Australian_Rugby_League" id="w">Australian Rugby League</a> (now <a href="/wiki/National_Rugby_League" id="w">National Rugby League</a>) standards. Crowds continued to push the capacity of the stadium and in <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a> the Stoackland Stadium was renovated to include both northern and southern seating, where previously there had been only standing room.</p>
<p>Stockland discontinued their sponsorship after three years of support which paved the way for the current sponsor, &#39;Dairy Farmers Limited&#39; who have badged the venue &#39;Malanda Stadium&#39;.</p>
<a id="Malanda_Stadium" name="Malanda_Stadium"></a><h3>Malanda Stadium</h3>

<p>Season <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a> saw the stadium renamed with a new sponsorship deal &#39;Malanda Stadium&#39;. But after its opening season the Dairy Milk corporation felt it more appropriate to rename the stadium &#39;Dairy Farmers Stadium&#39; (1998-current) after Dairy Farmers bought out the Malanda Milk corporation.</p>

<p>Many stages of redevelopment were taken on and gradually completed over the Cowboys growing success. The venue had changed from a disused Harness Racing facility to the current complex. The management and operation of the stadium was handed over to the Major Sports Facilities Authority in December 2003 in the hope for more cash inflow and government spending.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> the eastern terraces were extended, a new replay screen invested, public address system installed, 30 more corporate boxes and upgraded catering facilities as part of the funding injection. The lighting facilities were upgraded for night time broadcasts and the money didn&#39;t stop there. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> saw the eastern, northern and southern grandstands receiving even further upgrades with the fitting of extra seating and the eastern terrace was extended completely taking over the old eastern hill.</p>
