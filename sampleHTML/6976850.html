<b><i>Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/2000_in_film" id="w">2000</a> film adaptation of the <a href="/wiki/Battlefield_Earth_(novel)" id="w">novel of the same name</a> by <a href="/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard" id="w">L. Ron Hubbard</a>. The film is produced by and stars <a href="/wiki/John_Travolta" id="w">John Travolta</a>. It was a notorious commercial and critical disaster and has been widely criticized as one of the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Films_considered_the_worst_ever" id="w">worst films ever made</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Cult classic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cult classic" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Travolta Sets Sights_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Travolta Sets Sights" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h2> Plot </h2>

<p>The film depicts a greedy alien security chief, Terl (Travolta), who enslaves human prisoners to mine gold for his people. Barry Pepper plays Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, a human (or &#34;man-animal&#34;, as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Psychlo" id="w">Psychlos</a>&#34; named them) who decides to liberate his people by fighting the &#34;Psychlos&#34;. The plot follows roughly the same lines as the original book, though with some major omissions and simplifications. The film ends approximately one half of the way through the book, with the destruction of Psychlo and liberation of the Earth. </p>
<p>Travolta originally saw himself in the role of Tyler, but by the time the movie was actually made, Travolta felt he was too old to play the role, and took the role of the main villain instead.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2> Development </h2>

<p>Plans for a film version of <i>Battlefield Earth</i> appear to have been hatched not long after the publication of the book. In February <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a> L. Ron Hubbard gave an interview to the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> in which he told the reporter:
</p><dl><dd>&#34;I&#39;ve recently written three screenplays and some interest has been expressed in <i>Battlefield Earth</i>, so I suppose I&#39;ll be right back in Hollywood one of these days and probably on location in the Denver area for <i>Battlefield Earth</i> when they film it.&#34; <sup id="_ref-lamont_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lamont" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Hubbard&#39;s comments suggest that he saw himself being directly involved in the film; author <a href="/wiki/Stewart_Lamont" id="w">Stewart Lamont</a> suggests that Hubbard may even have envisioned directing it, given his previous work on <a href="/wiki/Scientology" id="w">Scientology</a> training films.<sup id="_ref-lamont_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lamont" title="">[4]</a></sup> In October 1983, the film rights were sold by the Church of Scientology&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Author_Services_Inc." id="w">Author Services Inc.</a> to <a href="/wiki/Salem_Productions" id="w">Salem Productions</a> of <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" id="w">Los Angeles</a>. Two films were envisaged, covering each half of the book and tentatively budgeted at $15 million each.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The veteran screenwriter <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Polonsky" id="w">Abraham Polonsky</a> and the British director <a href="/wiki/Ken_Annakin" id="w">Ken Annakin</a> were hired to produce a film breakdown, with production scheduled to begin in 1985.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> However, the project never started and Hubbard&#39;s death in January 1986 may have played a part in bringing it to a halt.</p>
<p>After his success in the 1994 movie <i><a href="/wiki/Pulp_Fiction_(film)" id="w">Pulp Fiction</a>,</i> <a href="/wiki/Hollywood" id="w">Hollywood</a> star John Travolta worked hard for a movie adaptation of <i>Battlefield Earth</i>. Travolta, a devoted Scientologist and one of the organization&#39;s most vocal supporters, described the book in interviews as &#34;like <i>Pulp Fiction</i> for the year 3000&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> and &#34;like <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" id="w">Star Wars</a></i>, only better.&#34; Travolta reportedly lobbied a variety of Hollywood figures, apparently enlisting the aid of other Scientologists. According to <a href="/wiki/Bill_Mechanic" id="w">Bill Mechanic</a>, the former head of <a href="/wiki/Twentieth_Century_Fox" id="w">Twentieth Century Fox</a>, &#34;He had Scientologists all over me. They come up to you and they know who you are.&#34; This did not impress Mechanic: &#34;Do you think in any way, shape, or form that weirding me out is going to make me want to make this movie?&#34; <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Travolta&#39;s involvement in <i>Battlefield Earth</i> was first publicised in late 1995.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> It was assumed that he would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by <a href="/wiki/MGM" id="w">MGM</a>; <a href="/wiki/J.D._Shapiro" id="w">J.D. Shapiro</a> would write the screenplay.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> In 1997, Travolta&#39;s long-time manager <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Krane" id="w">Jonathan Krane</a> signed a two-year deal with Twentieth Century Fox under which that studio, rather than MGM, would release <i>Battlefield Earth</i>. However, the deal with Fox also fell through. The author James Robert Parish comments that both studios regarded the project as too risky, on several grounds. Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100 million; Hubbard&#39;s narrative was seen as naive and outdated; and the &#34;Scientology factor&#34; could work against the film, negating Travolta&#39;s star power. <sup id="_ref-fiasco_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fiasco" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, in 1999, the project ended up with <a href="/wiki/Franchise_Entertainment" id="w">Franchise Entertainment</a>, as an independent production for <a href="/wiki/Morgan_Creek_Productions" id="w">Morgan Creek Productions</a> which would, in turn, release the film through <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros." id="w">Warner Bros.</a> in the U.S. under an existing distribution agreement. Franchise retained the foreign rights. Travolta&#39;s company <a href="/wiki/JTP_Films" id="w">JTP Films</a> was also involved in the production.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Roger_Christian_(filmmaker)" id="w">Roger Christian</a>, a protégé of <a href="/wiki/George_Lucas" id="w">George Lucas</a>, was signed to direct <i>Battlefield Earth</i>. He had most recently been the <a href="/wiki/Second_unit" id="w">second unit</a> director on Lucas&#39; <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace" id="w">Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</a></i>. The cast included Travolta, <a href="/wiki/Barry_Pepper" id="w">Barry Pepper</a>, <a href="/wiki/Forest_Whitaker" id="w">Forest Whitaker</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kim_Coates" id="w">Kim Coates</a>, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Tyson" id="w">Richard Tyson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sabine_Karsenti" id="w">Sabine Karsenti</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Byrne_(actor)" id="w">Michael Byrne</a>. Travolta&#39;s wife <a href="/wiki/Kelly_Preston" id="w">Kelly Preston</a> also appeared; her role is often incorrectly described as &#34;starring&#34; even though she only appears in one scene.</p>
<p>Even before the film&#39;s release, it faced a barrage of unfavorable publicity. The media noted the unusually tight security around the production, though this did not prevent <i>Mean Magazine</i> obtaining a copy of the screenplay. In an experiment, the magazine&#39;s staffers changed its title to &#34;Dark Forces&#34; by &#34;Desmond Finch&#34; and circulated it to readers at a number of major Hollywood film production companies. The comments that came back were universally unfavorable: &#34;a thoroughly silly plotline is made all the more ludicrous by its hamfisted dialog and ridiculously shallow characterizations&#34;, &#34;a completely predictable story that just isn&#39;t written well enough to make up for its lack of originality.&#34; One reviewer labeled the screenplay &#34;as entertaining as watching a fly breathe.&#34; <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Battlefield Earth</i> was finally released in May <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a>, just three days after the 50th anniversary of the publication of Hubbard&#39;s book <i><a href="/wiki/Dianetics:_The_Modern_Science_of_Mental_Health" id="w">Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health</a></i>, a date celebrated by Scientologists worldwide as a major <a href="/wiki/Scientology_holidays" id="w">holiday</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The original book was also re-released with a new cover based on the film&#39;s poster. However, the film met poor box-office results and abysmal reviews.</p>
<a id="Box_office" name="Box_office"></a><h2> Box office </h2>

<p>Released in 3,307 theaters, <i>Battlefield Earth</i> grossed $21,471,685 in the United States and a total of $29,725,663 worldwide, falling well short of its $73 million production budget and $30 million in estimated marketing costs. Financially, it is regarded as one of the greatest box office failures.</p>
<p>The film&#39;s exceptionally bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth led to a precipitous falling-off in its weekend grosses. Having grossed $11,548,898 from 3,307 theaters on its opening weekend, its take collapsed to $3,924,921 the following weekend, prompting theaters to abandon the film in droves. The film made 95% of its entire domestic gross in the first two weekends and flatlined thereafter. By its sixth weekend on release, the film was showing at only 95 theaters and had made only $18,993 in a week - less than $200 per theater. <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Critical_reception" name="Critical_reception"></a><h2> Critical reception </h2>

<p>Critically, the movie was also a disaster and reviews were nearly unanimously bad. Film critic <a href="/wiki/Roger_Ebert" id="w">Roger Ebert</a> described it as &#34;something historic, a film that for decades to come will be the punch line of jokes about bad movies.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Ebert_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ebert" title="">[16]</a></sup>  Ebert gave the film the rating of half a star out of four<sup id="_ref-Ebert_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ebert" title="">[16]</a></sup>.  Rita Kempley of the <i><a href="/wiki/Washington_Post" id="w">Washington Post</a></i> commented that: &#34;<a href="/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem" id="w">A million monkeys</a> with a million <a href="/wiki/Crayons" id="w">crayons</a> would be hard-pressed in a million years to create anything as cretinous as <i>Battlefield Earth</i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Kempley_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kempley" title="">[17]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Mitchell" id="w">Elvis Mitchell</a>, in the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" id="w">New York Times</a></i>, wrote that &#34;it may be a bit early to make such judgments, but <i>Battlefield Earth</i> may well turn out to be the worst movie of this century&#34; and called it &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/Plan_Nine_From_Outer_Space" id="w">Plan Nine From Outer Space</a></i> for a new generation.&#34; The British film critic <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Ross_(television_presenter)" id="w">Jonathan Ross</a> offered a particularly unsparing critique:</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Critics noted <i>Battlefield Earth&#39;s</i> overuse of odd camera angles and luridly tinted scenes</div></div>

Particular points that critics held up for censure included its overuse of <a href="/wiki/Dutch_angle" id="w">angled camera shots</a> <sup id="_ref-Without a clue_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Without a clue" title="">[18]</a></sup> (which, according to the director himself in different reports, are used in all but one frame of the film<sup id="_ref-What on Earth_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-What on Earth" title="">[19]</a></sup> or even in every single frame<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>), derivative special effects, and unbelievable plotting. The <a href="/wiki/Rhode_Island" id="w">Rhode Island</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Providence_Journal" id="w">Providence Journal</a></i> newspaper also highlighted the film&#39;s odd colour scheme:</p>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>The film frequently appears on worst film lists, such as the <a href="/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database" id="w">Internet Movie Database</a>&#39;s &#34;Bottom 100&#34; list, where patron voting has continuously kept it listed as one of the <a class="externallink" href="http://us.imdb.com/bottom_100_films" rel="nofollow" title="http://us.imdb.com/bottom_100_films">100 worst films of all time</a>. As of <a href="/wiki/26_December" id="w">26 December</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, it held the position of #63 on the list. Further insults came in <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>, when the movie received seven <a href="/wiki/2000_Golden_Raspberry_Awards" id="w">Razzie Awards</a>, including Worst Movie of the Year, Worst Actor (Travolta), and Worst Screen Couple (Travolta and &#34;anyone sharing the screen with him&#34;). As Travolta did not attend to collect his trophies, an action figure of Terl, his character, accepted them in his place. This tied for the highest number of Razzies &#34;won&#34; by a single film at that time, with <i><a href="/wiki/Showgirls" id="w">Showgirls</a></i> seven &#34;wins&#34; in <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a>.  <i>Battlefield Earth</i> was later awarded an eighth Razzie for &#34;Worst Drama&#34; of our First 25 Years&#34;. It received an exceptionally low 3% <a href="/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" id="w">Rotten Tomatoes</a> ranking <sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> (by comparison, 60% is considered &#34;Fresh&#34;, i.e. good), and hit #14 on their 100 worst list<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>. Although Travolta wished to follow up the film with a sequel,<sup id="_ref-Travolta Sets Sights_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Travolta Sets Sights" title="">[2]</a></sup> no plans to do so have materialized.</p>
<p>By the time the film was released on DVD, it had been drastically edited from the original theatrical version. <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Controversies" name="Controversies"></a><h2>Controversies</h2>

<p>In 1999, <a href="/wiki/Author_Services_Inc." id="w">Author Services Inc.</a> said that it was &#34;donating its share of the profits from the film to charitable organizations that direct drug education and drug rehabilitation programs around the world&#34;.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> It was reported that the merchandising revenues would be passed on to the Scientology-linked &#34;social betterment&#34; groups <a href="/wiki/Narconon" id="w">Narconon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Applied_Scholastics" id="w">Applied Scholastics</a>, with movie-related sales of the book funding the marketing of Hubbard&#39;s fiction books and the L.

<p>Following the failure of <i>Battlefield Earth</i> and other films independently produced by Franchise Pictures, the <i><a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" id="w">Wall Street Journal</a></i> reported that the <a href="/wiki/FBI" id="w">FBI</a> was probing &#34;the question of whether some independent motion picture companies have vastly inflated the budget of films in an effort to scam investors.&#34;<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> A $100 million lawsuit was filed against Franchise Pictures by the German-based Intertainment AG alleging that the production company had fraudulently inflated budgets in pictures, including <i>Battlefield Earth</i>, that Intertainment had helped to finance.

<a id="Followups_and_sequels" name="Followups_and_sequels"></a><h2>Followups and sequels</h2>

<p>The disastrous performance of <i>Battlefield Earth</i> and the collapse of its financial backers has made it very unlikely that a sequel will be produced as Travolta originally intended.<sup id="_ref-fiasco_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fiasco" title="">[11]</a></sup> However, Author Services announced in 2001 that Pine Com International, a <a href="/wiki/Tokyo" id="w">Tokyo</a>-based animation studio, would produce thirteen one-hour animated television segments based on the book and rendered in a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Manga" id="w">magna</a>&#34; {{sic}} style. <sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Dan_Haggerty" id="w">Dan Haggerty</a> was signed to provide the voice of Terl and Tim Kearns was to play Ker.

<p>The MTV short was the first time <i>South Park</i> had satirized Scientology, in a piece entitled: &#34;The Gauntlet&#34;.
