<b>Tropical Storm Zeta</b> was a late-developing <a href="/wiki/Tropical_storm" id="w">tropical storm</a> over the central <a href="/wiki/Atlantic" id="w">Atlantic</a> which formed after the <a href="/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a> had officially ended, and continued into January. It extended the record number of storms in a season to twenty-eight.</p>
<p>Zeta developed late on <a href="/wiki/December_29" id="w">December 29</a> and headed to the west. Throughout the storm&#39;s lifetime, the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> continually predicted it would weaken rapidly. Like the previous tropical cyclone <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Epsilon_(2005)" id="w">Hurricane Epsilon</a>, Zeta defied these predictions. The storm reached its peak strength on <a href="/wiki/January_2" id="w">January 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> before finally dissipating on <a href="/wiki/January_6" id="w">January 6</a>. As Zeta never approached land there was no impact from the storm.</p>

Late on <a href="/wiki/December_29" id="w">December 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, a tropical depression developed in the east-central Atlantic from a <a href="/wiki/Weather_front" id="w">frontal</a> <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a> and became a tropical storm early the next day. As this was more than four weeks after the official end of the season, the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> didn&#39;t operationally notice the system until after it had already become a tropical storm.<sup id="_ref-ZetaTCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ZetaTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup> Initially the storm headed to the northwest but stalled late on <a href="/wiki/December_31" id="w">December 31</a> before heading westwards, gradually strengthening to winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) as it did so. As with the previous storm, <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Epsilon_(2005)" id="w">Hurricane Epsilon</a>, the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> continuously forecast that Zeta would weaken in response to high level shear but Zeta held onto its strength, like Epsilon had done.<sup id="_ref-NHC-disc11_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHC-disc11" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Tropical Storm Zeta weakened slightly on <a href="/wiki/January_2" id="w">January 2</a>, before intensifying further to its peak strength with 65&#160;mph (100&#160;km/h) winds. One of the models suggested that Zeta could strengthen further and become a hurricane but this did not occur.<sup id="_ref-NHC-disc16_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHC-disc16" title="">[3]</a></sup> Tropical Storm Zeta continued to defy forecasts of weakening and on <a href="/wiki/January_4" id="w">January 4</a> increasing frustration led NHC forecaster, Dr. <a href="/wiki/Lixion_Avila" id="w">Lixion Avila</a> to say that he had &#34;run out [of] things to say&#34;.<sup id="_ref-NHC-disc21_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHC-disc21" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The effects of wind shear finally took their toll late on <a href="/wiki/January_4" id="w">January 4</a>, and Zeta&#39;s convection began to die down. This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm. The NHC continued to overestimate how quickly Zeta would dissipate and early on <a href="/wiki/January_5" id="w">January 5</a> they operationally downgraded Zeta to a depression, which was later confirmed to have been an error.<sup id="_ref-NHC-disc24_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHC-disc24" title="">[5]</a></sup> Zeta continued to move west-northwestward, barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on <a href="/wiki/January_6" id="w">January 6</a> and dissipated into a remnant later that day, finally ending the 2005 season. The remnant low retained its identity for a further day before it dissipated 660 miles (1060 km) southeast of <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>.<sup id="_ref-ZetaTCR_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ZetaTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Impact_and_records" name="Impact_and_records"></a><h2>Impact and records</h2>
<p>Several of the crews that were taking part in the 2005 <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Rowing_Race" id="w">Atlantic Rowing Race</a> were affected with heavy seas and strong adverse winds from Tropical Storm Zeta.<sup id="_ref-Rowing_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rowing" title="">[6]</a></sup> The ship <i>Liberty Star</i> made several reports of strong winds from Tropical Storm Zeta, including one of 40&#160;mph (65&#160;km/h) winds early on <a href="/wiki/December_31" id="w">December 31</a>, when the ship was about 45&#160;miles (75&#160;km) north of the center of the storm.</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Zeta never threatened land so no coastal <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">watches or warnings</a> were issued.<sup id="_ref-ZetaTCR_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ZetaTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup> There was no reported damage or fatalities from Zeta.<sup id="_ref-ZetaTCR_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ZetaTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Tropical Storm Zeta formed at 0600 <a href="/wiki/UTC" id="w">UTC</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_31" id="w">December 31</a>, it became the second latest-forming tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic, forming about six hours earlier than <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Alice_(December_1954)" id="w">Hurricane Alice</a> did in 1954. Zeta is only the second <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane" id="w">Atlantic tropical cyclone</a> on record to have existed in two calendar years (after Alice).<sup id="_ref-ZetaTCR_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ZetaTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup> However, lasting seven full days (six of them in 2006), Zeta is the longest-lasting tropical storm on record for the month of January. Tropical Storm Zeta also extended the record number of storms to form in the 2005 season to twenty-eight, seven more than the previous record held by the <a href="/wiki/1933_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1933 season</a>. It was the only Atlantic storm to have a name beginning with the letter &#34;Z&#34;, since the lists of names for Atlantic storms stop at &#34;W&#34;.</p>
