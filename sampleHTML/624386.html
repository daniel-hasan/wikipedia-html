<p><b>Aleksandr Mikhaylovich Vasilevsky</b> ({{lang-ru}}, <a href="/wiki/September_30" id="w">September 30</a> <a href="/wiki/1895" id="w">1895</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/December_5" id="w">December 5</a> <a href="/wiki/1977" id="w">1977</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet</a> military commander, promoted to <a href="/wiki/Marshal_of_the_Soviet_Union" id="w">Marshal of the Soviet Union</a> in 1943. He was the Soviet Chief of the General Staff and Deputy <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_Defense" id="w">Minister of Defense</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, as well as Minister of Defense from 1949 to 1953. As the Chief of the General Staff, Vasilevsky was responsible for the planning and coordination of almost all decisive Soviet offensives, from the <a href="/wiki/Operation_Uranus" id="w">Stalingrad counteroffensive</a> to the assault on <a href="/wiki/East_Prussia" id="w">East Prussia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kaliningrad" id="w">Königsberg</a>.</p>
<p>Vasilevsky started his military career during the <a href="/wiki/First_World_War" id="w">First World War</a>, earning the rank of captain by 1917. At the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/October_Revolution" id="w">October Revolution</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War" id="w">Civil War</a> he was conscripted into the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a>, taking part in the <a href="/wiki/Polish-Soviet_War" id="w">Polish-Soviet War</a>. After the war, he quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a regimental commander by 1930. In this position, he showed great skill in the organization and training of his troops. Vasilevsky&#39;s talent did not go unnoticed, and in 1931 he was appointed a member of the Directorate of Military Training. In 1937, following <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" id="w">Stalin</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Great_Purge" id="w">Great Purge</a>, he was promoted to <a href="/wiki/General_Staff" id="w">General Staff</a> officer.</p>
<p>At the start of the 1943 Soviet counteroffensive of the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a>, Vasilevsky coordinated and executed the Red Army&#39;s offensive on the upper <a href="/wiki/Don_River_(Russia)" id="w">Don</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/Donets_Basin" id="w">Donbass</a>, <a href="/wiki/Crimea" id="w">Crimea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belarus" id="w">Belarus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Baltic_states" id="w">Baltic states</a>, ending the war with the capture of <a href="/wiki/K%C3%B6nigsberg" id="w">Königsberg</a> in April 1945. In July 1945, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of Soviet forces in the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Far_East" id="w">Far East</a>, executing <a href="/wiki/Operation_August_Storm" id="w">Operation August Storm</a> and subsequently accepting <a href="/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan" id="w">Japan&#39;s surrender</a>. After the war, he became the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Defense_Minister" id="w">Soviet Defense Minister</a>, a position he held until Stalin&#39;s death in 1953. With <a href="/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev" id="w">Khrushchev</a>&#39;s rise, Vasilevsky started to lose power and was eventually pensioned off. After his death, he was buried in the <a href="/wiki/Kremlin_Wall_Necropolis" id="w">Kremlin Wall Necropolis</a> in recognition of his past service and contributions to his nation.</p>
<a id="Biography" name="Biography"></a><h2> Biography </h2>
<a id="Childhood_and_early_years" name="Childhood_and_early_years"></a><h3> Childhood and early years </h3>
<p>Vasilevsky was born on <a href="/wiki/September_30" id="w">September 30</a> <small>[<a href="/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates" id="w">O.S.</a> September 18]</small>, <a href="/wiki/1895" id="w">1895</a> in Novaya Golchikha in the <a href="/wiki/Kineshma" id="w">Kineshma</a> <a href="/wiki/Uyezd" id="w">Uezd</a> (now part of the city of <a href="/wiki/Vichuga" id="w">Vichuga</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Kostroma_Oblast" id="w">Kostroma Oblast</a>). Vasilevsky was the fourth of eight children.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> His father, Mikhail Aleksandrovich Vasilevsky, was a priest to the nearby St. Nicholas Church. His mother, Nadezhda Ivanovna Sokolova, was the daughter of a priest in the nearby village of Ugletz. Vasilevsky reportedly broke off all contact with his parents after 1926 because of his <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" id="w">VKP(b)</a> membership and his military duties in the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a>; three of his brothers did so as well. However, the family resumed relations in 1940, following <a href="/wiki/Stalin" id="w">Stalin</a>&#39;s suggestion that they do so.</p>
<p>According to Vasilevsky himself, his family was extremely poor. His father spent most of his time working to earn money, while the children assisted by working in the fields. In 1897, the family moved to Novopokrovskoe, where his father became a priest to the newly-built Ascension Church,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> and where Aleksandr began his education in the church school. In 1909, he entered Kostroma seminary,<sup id="_ref-Zaless_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zaless" title="">[3]</a></sup> which required considerable financial sacrifice on the part of his parents.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The same year, a ministerial directive preventing former seminarists from starting university studies initiated a nationwide seminarist movement, with classes stopping in most Russian seminaries. Vasilevsky, among others, was expelled from Kostroma, and only returned several months later, after the seminarists&#39; demands had been satisfied.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>After completing his studies in the seminary and spending a few years working as a teacher, Vasilevsky intended to become an <a href="/wiki/Agronomy" id="w">agronomist</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Surveyor_(surveying)" id="w">surveyor</a>, but the outbreak of the First World War changed his plans. According to his own words, he was &#34;overwhelmed with patriotic feelings&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> and decided to become a soldier instead. Vasilevsky took his exams in January 1915 and entered the <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Military_Law_Academy" id="w">Alexander Military Law Academy</a> in February. As he recalls, &#34;<i>I did not decide to become an officer to start a military career. I still wanted to be an agronomist and work in some remote corner of Russia after the war. I could not suppose that my country would change, and I would</i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> After four months of courses that he later considered to be completely outdated, theoretical, and inappropriate for modern warfare,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> he was sent to the front with the rank of <a href="/wiki/Praporshchik" id="w">praporshchik</a> (the highest non-commissioned rank in the Russian infantry) in May 1915.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>From June to September, Vasilevsky was assigned to a series of reserve regiments, and finally arrived at the front in September as a half-company commander (<i>polurotny</i>) in the 409th Novokhopersky regiment, 109th division, 9th Army.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> In the spring of 1916, Vasilevsky took command of a company, which eventually became one of the most recognized in the regiment.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> In May 1916, he led his men during the <a href="/wiki/Brusilov_offensive" id="w">Brusilov offensive</a>, becoming a battalion commander after heavy casualties among officers, and gaining the rank of captain by age 22.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Shikman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shikman" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In November 1917, just after the <a href="/wiki/October_Revolution" id="w">Russian Revolution</a>, Vasilevsky decided to end his military career. As he wrote in his memoirs, &#34;<i>There was a time when I led soldiers to battle, thinking I was doing my duty as a Russian patriot. However, I understood that we have been cheated, that people needed peace. . . . Therefore, my military career had to end. With no remorse, I could go back to my favorite occupation, working in the field.</i>&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> He travelled from Romania, where his unit was deployed in 1917, back to his own village.</p>
<p>In December 1917, while back at home, Vasilevsky learned that the men of the 409th regiment, which had been relocated to Ukraine, had elected him as their commander (at the beginning of the Russian Revolution, commanders were elected by their own men). However, the local military authorities recommended that he decline the proposal because of the heavy fighting taking place in Ukraine between pro-Soviet forces and the pro-independence Ukrainian government (the <a href="/wiki/Central_Rada" id="w">Central Rada</a>). He followed this advice and became a drill instructor in his own Kineshma uezd.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> He retired in September 1918 and became a school teacher in the <a href="/wiki/Tula_Oblast" id="w">Tula Oblast</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>In April 1919, Vasilevsky was again conscripted into the Red Army and sent to command a company fighting against peasant uprisings and assisting in the emergency Soviet policy of <a href="/wiki/Prodrazvyorstka" id="w">prodrazvyorstka</a>, which required peasants to surrender agricultural surplus for a fixed price. Later that year, Vasilevsky took command of a new reserve battalion, and, in October 1919, of a regiment. However, his regiment never took part in the battles of the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War" id="w">Russian Civil War</a>, as <a href="/wiki/Denikin" id="w">Denikin</a>&#39;s troops never got close to Tula.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> In December 1919, Vasilevsky was sent to the Western front as a deputy regimental commander, participating in the <a href="/wiki/Polish-Soviet_War" id="w">Polish-Soviet War</a>.<sup id="_ref-Zaless_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zaless" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-WIW20S_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WIW20S" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>As deputy regimental commander of the 427th regiment, 32nd brigade, 11th division, Vasilevsky participated at the battle of <a href="/wiki/Berezina_river" id="w">Berezina</a>, pulling back as the Polish forces had been slowly but steadily advancing eastward, and in the subsequent counterattack that started on <a href="/wiki/May_14" id="w">May 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a>, breaking through Polish lines before being stopped by cavalry counterattacks.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Later, starting from <a href="/wiki/July_4" id="w">July 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a>, he took part at the Soviet offensive towards <a href="/wiki/Wilno" id="w">Wilno</a>, advancing to <a href="/wiki/Neman_River" id="w">Neman river</a> despite heavy Polish resistance and German fortifications erected in the region during World War I. Vasilevsky&#39;s regiment arrived near Wilno by mid-July and stayed there on a garrison duty until the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Riga" id="w">Treaty of Riga</a>.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_interwar_period" name="The_interwar_period"></a><h3> The interwar period </h3>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Riga" id="w">Treaty of Riga</a>, Vasilevsky fought against remaining <a href="/wiki/White_Army" id="w">white</a> forces and peasant uprisings in Belarus and in the <a href="/wiki/Smolensk_Oblast" id="w">Smolensk Oblast</a> until August 1921.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> By 1930, he had served as the regimental commander of the 142nd, 143rd, and 144th rifle regiments,<sup id="_ref-Zaless_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zaless" title="">[3]</a></sup> where he showed great skill in the organization and training of his troops.

Vasilevsky&#39;s connections and good performance earned him an appointment to the Directorate of Military Training in 1931.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>While at the Directorate of Military Training, Vasilevsky supervised the Red Army&#39;s training and worked on military manuals and field books.

<p>By mid-1937, Stalin&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Great_Purge" id="w">Great Purge</a> eliminated a significant number of senior military commanders, vacating a number of positions on the General Staff. To his amazement, Vasilevsky was appointed to the General Staff in October 1937 and held &#34;<i>responsible for operational training of senior officers</i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Zaless_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zaless" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> In 1938, he was made a member of the <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" id="w">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a> (a sine qua non condition for a successful career in the Soviet Union); in 1939, he was appointed Deputy Commander of the Operations Directorate of the General Staff, while holding the rank of divisional commander.<sup id="_ref-Zaless_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zaless" title="">[3]</a></sup> While in this position he and Shaposhnikov were responsible for the planning of the <a href="/wiki/Winter_War" id="w">Winter War</a>, and after the <a href="/wiki/Moscow_Peace_Treaty_(1940)" id="w">Moscow peace treaty</a>, for setting the demarcation line with Finland.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a senior officer, Vasilevsky met frequently with <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" id="w">Joseph Stalin</a>. During one of these meetings, Stalin asked Vasilevsky about his family. Since Vasilevsky&#39;s father was a priest and thus a potential &#34;<a href="/wiki/Enemy_of_the_people" id="w">enemy of the people</a>,&#34; Vasilevsky said that he had ended his relationship with them in 1926. Stalin, surprised, suggested that he reestablish his family ties at once, and help his parents with whatever needs they might have.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

<p>By June 1941, Vasilevsky was working around the clock in his General Staff office.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/June_22" id="w">June 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, he learned of the German bombing of several important military and civilian objectives,<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> starting the <a href="/wiki/Great_Patriotic_War" id="w">Great Patriotic War</a>. In August 1941, Vasilevsky was appointed Commander of Operations, Directorate of the General Staff and Deputy Chief of the General Staff,<sup id="_ref-SovMilEnc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SovMilEnc" title="">[39]</a></sup> making him one of the key figures in the Soviet military leadership. At the end of September 1941, Vasilevsky gave a speech before the General Staff, describing the situation as extremely difficult, but pointing out that the northern part of the front was holding, that Leningrad still offered resistance, and that such a situation would potentially allow some reserves to be gathered in the northern part of the front.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>In October 1941, the situation at the front was becoming critical, with German forces advancing towards Moscow during <a href="/wiki/Operation_Typhoon" id="w">Operation Typhoon</a>. As a representative of the Soviet General Staff (<a href="/wiki/STAVKA" id="w">STAVKA</a>), Vasilevsky was sent to the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Western_Front" id="w">Western Front</a> to coordinate the defense and guarantee a flow of supplies and men towards the region of <a href="/wiki/Mozhaisk" id="w">Mozhaisk</a>,<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> where Soviet forces were attempting to contain the German advance. During heavy fighting near the outskirts of Moscow, Vasilevsky spent all of his available time both in the STAVKA and on the front line trying to coordinate the three fronts committed to Moscow&#39;s defense.<sup id="_ref-Shtemenko27_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shtemenko27" title="">[42]</a></sup> When most of the General Staff (including its chief Marshal <a href="/wiki/Shaposhnikov" id="w">Shaposhnikov</a>) was evacuated from Moscow, Vasilevsky remained in the city as liaison between the Moscow Staff and the evacuated members of the General Staff.<sup id="_ref-Shtemenko27_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shtemenko27" title="">[42]</a></sup> In his memoirs, <a href="/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev" id="w">Nikita Khrushchev</a> described Vasilevsky as an &#34;able specialist&#34; even so early in the war.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/October_28" id="w">October 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, Vasilevsky was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_General" id="w">Lieutenant General</a>.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Moscow" id="w">Battle of Moscow</a> was a very difficult period in Vasilevsky&#39;s life, with the Wehrmacht approaching close enough to the city for German officers to make out some of Moscow&#39;s buildings through their field glasses. As he recalls, his workday often ended at four a.m.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> Moreover, with Marshal Shaposhnikov having fallen ill, Vasilevsky had to make important decisions by himself.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/October_29" id="w">October 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, a bomb exploded in the courtyard of the General Staff. Vasilevsky was slightly wounded but continued working. The kitchen was damaged by the explosion, and the General Staff was relocated underground without hot food. Nevertheless, the Staff continued to function.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> In December 1941, Vasilevsky coordinated the Moscow counteroffensive, and by early 1942, the general counteroffensive in the Moscow and Rostov directions, further motivated in his work by the return of his evacuated family to Moscow.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> In April 1942, he coordinated the unsuccessful elimination of the <a href="/wiki/Demyansk_pocket" id="w">Demyansk pocket</a>, the encirclement of the German 2nd Army Corps near Leningrad. On <a href="/wiki/April_24" id="w">April 24</a>, with Shaposhnikov seriously ill again, Vasilevsky was appointed as acting Chief of Staff and promoted to <a href="/wiki/Colonel_General" id="w">Colonel General</a> on <a href="/wiki/April_26" id="w">April 26</a>.</p>

<p>In May 1942 one of the most controversial episodes in Vasilevsky&#39;s career occurred: the <a href="/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Kharkov" id="w">Second Battle of Kharkov</a>, a failed counteroffensive that led to a stinging Red Army defeat, and ultimately to a successful German offensive (<a href="/wiki/Operation_Blue" id="w">Operation Blue</a>) in the south. After repelling the enemy from Moscow, Soviet morale was high and Stalin was determined to launch another general counteroffensive during the summer. However, Vasilevsky recognized that <i>&#34;the reality was more harsh than that.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> Following Stalin&#39;s orders, the Kharkov offensive was launched on <a href="/wiki/May_12" id="w">May 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>. When the threat of encirclement became obvious, Vasilevsky and Zhukov asked for permission to withdraw the advancing Soviet forces.

<p>In June 1942, Vasilevsky was briefly sent to Leningrad to coordinate an attempt to break the encirclement of the 2nd Shock Army led by General <a href="/wiki/Andrei_Vlasov" id="w">Vlasov</a>.

<p>During the 1944 summer offensive, Stalin announced that he would appoint Vasilevsky Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Forces in the Far East once the war against Germany was over.

</p>
<p>Vasilevsky was regarded by his peers as a kind and soft military commander. General Shtemenko, a member of the General Staff during the war, described Vasilevsky as a brilliant, yet modest officer with outstanding experience in staff work. Shtemenko pointed out Vasilevsky&#39;s prodigious talent for strategic and operational planning. Vasilevsky also showed his respect for subordinates and demonstrated an acute sense of diplomacy and politeness, which Stalin appreciated. As a result, Vasilevsky enjoyed almost unlimited trust from Stalin.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> Several years before the war, Zhukov described Vasilevsky as &#34;<i>a man who knew his job as he spent a long time commanding a regiment and who earned great respect from everybody.</i>&#34;<sup id="_ref-Zhukov110_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zhukov110" title="">[29]</a></sup> During the war, Zhukov described Vasilevsky as an able commander, enjoying exceptional trust from Stalin, and able to persuade him even during heated discussions.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> Vasilevsky never mentioned his awards (including the two orders of Victory) in his memoirs, attesting to his modesty.</p>
<p>This being said, Vasilevsky&#39;s actions and personality were sometimes the object of dispute, while less controversial than those of Zhukov. In particular, Nikita Khrushchev defined Vasilevsky in his memoirs as a passive commander completely under the control of Stalin, and blamed him for the Kharkov failure in Spring 1942.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> Among Vasilevsky&#39;s strongest critics was Rokossovsky, who criticized Vasilevsky&#39;s decisions during the Stalingrad counteroffensive, especially his refusal to commit the 2nd Army to the annihilation of the encircled German divisions, and for general interference with his own work.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> Rokossovsky even wrote in his memoirs: <i>&#34;I do not even understand what role could Zhukov and Vasilevsky play on Stalingrad front.&#34;</i>.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> In fairness to Vasilevsky it needs noting that he only diverted the 2nd army from the assault on the Stalingrad pocket in order to commit it against a dangerous German counter-attack from Kotelnikovo, designed to deblockade the pocket, which was enjoying great numerical superiority. Vasilevsky, it seems, was dismayed by Rokossovsky&#39;s opposition to the transfer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the controversial historian <a href="/wiki/Victor_Suvorov" id="w">Victor Suvorov</a> held up Vasilevsky over Zhukov. According to him, Vasilevsky was the only officer responsible for the successful planning and execution of the Soviet counteroffensive at Stalingrad, and Zhukov played no role whatsoever in it. He claimed that Vasilevsky was the best Soviet military commander and that Soviet victory was mainly due to his actions as the Chief of Staff. According to Suvorov, Zhukov and the Soviet propaganda machine tried, after the war, to reduce the role of the General Staff (and thus Vasilevsky&#39;s importance) and to increase the role of the Party and Zhukov.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>
<p>A more balanced post-1991 view on Vasilevsky was elaborated by Mezhiritzky in his book, <i>Reading Marshal Zhukov</i>. Mezhiritzky points out Vasilevsky&#39;s timidity and his inability to defend his opinions before Stalin. Reportedly, Vasilevsky was appointed to such high military positions because he was easy to manage.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> However, Mezhiritzky recognizes Vasilevsky&#39;s intelligence and assumes that Vasilevsky was indeed the main author of the Stalingrad counteroffensive. He also points out that Vasilevsky and Zhukov probably deliberately under-reported the estimated strength of the 6th Army in order to have Stalin&#39;s approval for that risky operation.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
