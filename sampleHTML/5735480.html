<a id="Steam" name="Steam"></a><h3>Steam</h3>
<p>Cardiff Canton opened in June <a href="/wiki/1882" id="w">1882</a> as a six road, 240 feet long shed was built to replace Long Dyke, 1.5 miles east of Cardiff General station. The facility was extended in <a href="/wiki/1897" id="w">1897</a> when a 55ft diameter turntable was installed in a square building with 28 roads radiating of off the turntable. In <a href="/wiki/1925" id="w">1925</a> a locomotive repair and lifting shed was built together with a new coaling stage by the GWR. In <a href="/wiki/1931" id="w">1931</a> the original 55ft. turntable was removed and replaced by a larger 65ft. diameter table at the west end of the yard.  At this time, around the peak of GWR operation, the depot had allocated 50 main line passenger locomotives, 40 heavy goods/mineral locomotives and 30 smaller local passenger/goods and shunting locomotives. The depot closed to steam traction on <a href="/wiki/8_September" id="w">8 September</a>, <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a>.</p>
