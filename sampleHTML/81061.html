The <b>Victoria Cross</b> (<b>VC</b>) is a <a href="/wiki/Military_decoration" id="w">military decoration</a> awarded for valour &#34;in the face of the enemy&#34; to members of armed forces of some <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth</a> countries and previous <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British Empire</a> territories. It takes precedence over all other <a href="/wiki/Post-nominal_letters" id="w">postnominals</a> and medals. It may be awarded to a person of any <a href="/wiki/Military_rank" id="w">rank</a> in any service and civilians under military command, and is presented to the recipient by the <a href="/wiki/British_monarchy" id="w">British monarch</a> during an investiture held at <a href="/wiki/Buckingham_Palace" id="w">Buckingham Palace</a>. It is the joint highest award for bravery in the United Kingdom with the <a href="/wiki/George_Cross" id="w">George Cross</a>, which is the equivalent honour for valour not <i>in the face of the enemy.</i><sup id="_ref-Modclub_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Modclub" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The VC was introduced on <a href="/wiki/5_February" id="w">5 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1856" id="w">1856</a> by <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Victoria</a> to reward acts of valour during the <a href="/wiki/Crimean_War" id="w">Crimean War</a>. Since then the medal has been awarded 1,356 times to 1,353 individual recipients. Only 14 medals have been awarded since the end of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">Second World War</a>. The traditional explanation of the source of the <a href="/wiki/Gunmetal" id="w">gunmetal</a> from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian <a href="/wiki/Cannon" id="w">cannon</a> captured at the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1854-1855)" id="w">siege of Sevastopol</a>. Recent research has thrown doubt on this story, suggesting a variety of origins.<sup id="_ref-Glanfield_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glanfield" title="">[2]</a></sup> Due to its rarity, the VC is highly prized and the medal can reach over <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" id="w">£200</a>,000 at auction and there are a number of public and private collections devoted to it, most notably that of <a href="/wiki/Michael_Ashcroft%2C_Baron_Ashcroft" id="w">Lord Ashcroft</a>, which contains over one-tenth of the total VCs awarded.<sup id="_ref-Ashcroftweb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ashcroftweb" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Origin" name="Origin"></a><h2> Origin </h2>
<p>In 1854, after 40 years of peace, Britain found itself fighting a major war against Russia. The <a href="/wiki/Crimean_War" id="w">Crimean War</a> was one of the first wars with modern reporting, and the dispatches of <a href="/wiki/William_Howard_Russell" id="w">William Howard Russell</a> described many acts of bravery and valour by British servicemen that went unrewarded.<sup id="_ref-Ashcroft_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ashcroft" title="">[4]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Before the Crimean War, there was no official standardised system for recognition of gallantry within the British armed forces. Officers were eligible for an award of one of the junior grades of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath" id="w">Order of the Bath</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brevet_rank" id="w">Brevet promotions</a> whilst a <a href="/wiki/Mention_in_Despatches" id="w">Mention in Despatches</a> existed as an alternative award for acts of lesser gallantry. This structure was actually very limited; in actual practice awards of the Order of the Bath were confined to officers of <a href="/wiki/Field_officer" id="w">field rank</a><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Brevet promotions or Mentions in Despatches were largely confined to those who were under the immediate notice of the commanders in the field, generally members of the commander&#39;s own staff.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Other European countries had awards that did not discriminate against class or rank; <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> awarded the <a href="/wiki/L%C3%A9gion_d%26%2339%3Bhonneur" id="w">Légion d&#39;honneur</a> (Legion of Honour) and <a href="/wiki/The_Netherlands" id="w">The Netherlands</a> gave the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_William" id="w">Order of William</a>. There was a growing feeling amongst the public and in the Royal Court that a new award was needed to recognise incidents of gallantry that were unconnected with a man&#39;s lengthy or meritorious service. Queen Victoria signed a Royal Warrant on <a href="/wiki/29_January" id="w">29 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1856" id="w">1856</a><sup id="_ref-Ashcroft_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ashcroft" title="">[4]</a></sup> that officially recognised the VC. The order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the <a href="/wiki/Crimean_War" id="w">Crimean War</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Victoria</a> had instructed the <a href="/wiki/War_Office" id="w">War Office</a> to strike a new medal that would not recognise birth or class. The medal was meant to be a simple decoration that would be highly prized and eagerly sought after by those in the military services.<sup id="_ref-vvaa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vvaa" title="">[8]</a></sup> To maintain its simplicity, Queen Victoria, under the guidance of <a href="/wiki/Albert%2C_Prince_Consort" id="w">Prince Albert</a>, vetoed the suggestion that the award be called <i>The Military Order of Victoria</i> and instead suggested the name <i>Victoria Cross</i>. The original warrant stated that the Victoria Cross would only be awarded to soldiers who have served in the presence of the enemy and had performed some signal act of valour or devotion.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> The first ceremony was held on <a href="/wiki/26_June" id="w">26 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1857" id="w">1857</a> where Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park.<sup id="_ref-Ashcroft_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ashcroft" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was originally intended that the VCs would be cast from the <a href="/wiki/Bronze" id="w">bronze</a> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Cascabel">cascabels</a> of two <a href="/wiki/Cannon" id="w">cannons</a> that were captured from the <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russians</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1854-1855)" id="w">siege of Sevastopol</a>.<sup id="_ref-beharry359_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beharry359" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Navalmuseum_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Navalmuseum" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The historian John Glanfield has since proven through the use of x-rays of older Victoria Crosses that the metal used for VCs is in fact from antique Chinese guns and not of Russian origin.<sup id="_ref-Glanfield_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glanfield" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Navalmuseum_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Navalmuseum" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> One theory is that the guns were originally Chinese weapons but the Russians captured them and reused them at Sevastopol. It was also thought that some medals made during the <a href="/wiki/First_World_War" id="w">First World War</a> were composed of metal captured from different Chinese guns during the <a href="/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion" id="w">Boxer Rebellion</a> but the original metal was used after the war. It is also believed that another source of metal was used between 1942 and 1945 to create five <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a> VCs when the Sevastopol metal went missing.<sup id="_ref-Glanfield_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glanfield" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The barrels of the cannon in question are stationed outside the Officers&#39; Mess at the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Artillery_Barracks" id="w">Royal Artillery Barracks</a> at <a href="/wiki/Woolwich" id="w">Woolwich</a>. The remaining portion of the only remaining cascabel, weighing 358 oz (10 kg), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment <a href="/wiki/Royal_Logistic_Corps" id="w">Royal Logistic Corps</a> at <a href="/wiki/Donnington%2C_Telford" id="w">Donnington, Telford</a>. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, <a href="/wiki/Hancocks" id="w">Hancocks</a> of London, has been responsible for the production of every VC awarded since its inception.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>The cross is suspended by a ring from a <a href="/wiki/Serif" id="w">seriffed</a> &#34;V&#34; to a bar ornamented with laurel leaves, through which the ribbon passes.

<p>Originally, the VC could not be awarded posthumously, and could not be awarded to Indian or African troops (although it could be awarded to their European officers).<sup id="_ref-vcfivetv_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vcfivetv" title="">[22]</a></sup> Colonial troops were not eligible for the VC during the <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand_Land_Wars_Victoria_Cross_recipients" id="w">New Zealand land wars</a>, so the <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand_Cross_(1869)" id="w">New Zealand Cross (1869)</a> was created.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> One colonial soldier, Major <a href="/wiki/Charles_Heaphy" id="w">Charles Heaphy</a> was awarded the VC for his actions in 1864, as he was under British command.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> In 1905 it was made available to be awarded posthumously.<sup id="_ref-vcfivetv_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vcfivetv" title="">[22]</a></sup> In the twentieth century it was made available to all troops in the service of the Crown (the first Indian soldier, <a href="/wiki/Khudadad_Khan" id="w">Khudadad Khan</a>, received it in 1914).<sup id="_ref-vcfivetv_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vcfivetv" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Between 1858 and 1881 the Victoria Cross could be awarded for actions taken &#34;under circumstances of extreme danger&#34; not in the face of the enemy.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Six such awards were made during this period - five of them for a single incident (a shipwreck off the <a href="/wiki/Andaman_Islands" id="w">Andaman Islands</a> in 1867).<sup id="_ref-Wargravescomm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wargravescomm" title="">[26]</a></sup> In 1881, the criteria were changed again and the VC was only awarded for acts of valour &#34;in the face of the enemy&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Wargravescomm_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wargravescomm" title="">[26]</a></sup> Due to this it has been suggested by many historians including Lord Ashcroft that the changing nature of warfare will result in fewer VCs being awarded.<sup id="_ref-vcfivetv_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vcfivetv" title="">[22]</a></sup> The prevalence of more remote fighting techniques has meant that the opportunity to carry out acts of bravery are diminishing.

In recent years, several <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth</a> countries have introduced their own honours systems, separate from the <a href="/wiki/British_Honours_System" id="w">British Honours System</a>. This began with the <a href="/wiki/Partition_of_India" id="w">Partition of India</a> in 1947, when the new countries of India and Pakistan introduced their own systems of awards. The VC was replaced by the MVC and Nishan-e-Haider respectivly, although the new countries continued to permit winners of British honors to wear their awards. Indeed, several Pakistani soldiers and officers were notable in being authorised to wear both the British medals and the ones earned in the later <a href="/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars" id="w">Indo-Pakistani wars</a>. The &#34;white&#34; dominions  <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a><sup id="_ref-nzgovdept_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nzgovdept" title="">[27]</a></sup> have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the <a href="/wiki/Military_Cross" id="w">Military Cross</a> with their own. Most Commonwealth countries, however, still recognise some form of the VC as their highest decoration for valour.<sup id="_ref-gazetteOofP_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gazetteOofP" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Australia was the first Commonwealth nation to create its own VC, on <a href="/wiki/15_January" id="w">15 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a>. Although it is a separate award, its appearance is identical to its British counterpart.<sup id="_ref-ozvc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ozvc" title="">[29]</a></sup>  Canada followed suit when in 1993 Queen Elizabeth signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian VC, which is also similar to the British version, except that the legend has been changed from <small>FOR VALOUR</small> to the <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> <small>PRO VALORE</small> This was to accommodate both French and English, the two official languages of Canada.<sup id="_ref-CTVVChist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CTVVChist" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>New Zealand was the third country to adapt the VC into its own honours system. While the New Zealand and Australian VCs are technically separate awards, the decoration is identical to the British design, including being cast from the same Crimean War gunmetal as the British VC.<sup id="_ref-nzgovdept_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nzgovdept" title="">[27]</a></sup> As of July 2007, only one of the separate VCs has been awarded, to a New Zealand serviceman, <a href="/wiki/Bill_Apiata" id="w">Bill Apiata</a>, on <a href="/wiki/2_July" id="w">2 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, for his actions in conflict in <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a> in 2004.  </p>
<p>A Canadian version has been cast though that was originally to be awarded to the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Tomb_of_the_Unknown_Soldier" id="w">Unknown Soldier</a> at the rededication of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_National_Vimy_Memorial" id="w">Vimy Memorial</a> on <a href="/wiki/7_April" id="w">7 April</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.

<p>While the New Zealand and Australian<sup id="_ref-ozvc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ozvc" title="">[29]</a></sup> awards are still made from the gunmetal captured during the Crimean War, the Canadian VC is not, and it is currently made of metal from an unspecified source.<sup id="_ref-CTVVChist_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CTVVChist" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
