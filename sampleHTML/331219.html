<p><b>Du Fu</b> ({{zh-cw}}, <a href="/wiki/712_in_poetry" id="w">712</a>–<a href="/wiki/770_in_poetry" id="w">770</a>) was a prominent <a href="/wiki/Chinese_poet" id="w">Chinese poet</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Tang_Dynasty" id="w">Tang Dynasty</a>.
Along with <a href="/wiki/Li_Bai" id="w">Li Bai</a> (Li Po), he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese <a href="/wiki/Poet" id="w">poets</a>.<sup id="_ref-ebrey 103_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey 103" title="">[1]</a></sup>  His own greatest ambition was to help his country by becoming a successful <a href="/wiki/Civil_servant" id="w">civil servant</a>, but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations.  His life, like the whole country, was devastated by the <a href="/wiki/An_Lushan_Rebellion" id="w">An Lushan Rebellion</a> of 755, and the last 15 years of his life were a time of almost constant unrest.</p>
<p>Initially little known, his works came to be hugely influential in both <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_China" id="w">Chinese</a> and <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> culture.  Of his poetic writing, nearly fifteen hundred poems written by Du Fu have been handed down over the ages.<sup id="_ref-ebrey 103_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey 103" title="">[1]</a></sup>  He has been called <b>Poet-Historian</b> and the <b>Poet-Sage</b> by Chinese critics, while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to <a href="/wiki/Western_culture" id="w">Western</a> readers as &#34;the Chinese <a href="/wiki/Virgil" id="w">Virgil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Horace" id="w">Horace</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ovid" id="w">Ovid</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shakespeare" id="w">Shakespeare</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Milton" id="w">Milton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Burns" id="w">Burns</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Wordsworth" id="w">Wordsworth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pierre-Jean_de_B%C3%A9ranger" id="w">Béranger</a>, <a href="/wiki/Victor_Hugo" id="w">Hugo</a> or <a href="/wiki/Baudelaire" id="w">Baudelaire</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-hung 1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hung 1" title="">[2]</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Traditionally, Chinese <a href="/wiki/Literary_criticism" id="w">literary criticism</a> has placed great emphasis on knowledge of the <a href="/wiki/Biography" id="w">life</a> of the author when interpreting a work, a practice which Watson attributes to &#34;the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between <a href="/wiki/Art" id="w">art</a> and <a href="/wiki/Morality" id="w">morality</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Hung xvii_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hung xvii" title="">[3]</a></sup>  This becomes all the more important in the case of a writer such as Du Fu, in whose poems morality and <a href="/wiki/History" id="w">history</a> are so prominent.   Another reason, identified by the Chinese historian William Hung, is that Chinese poems are typically extremely concise, omitting circumstantial factors which may be relevant, but which could be reconstructed by an informed contemporary.  For modern <a href="/wiki/Western_culture" id="w">western</a> readers therefore, &#34;The less accurately we know the time, the place and the circumstances in the background, the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly, and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether&#34;.<sup id="_ref-hung 5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hung 5" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="Early_years" name="Early_years"></a><h2>Early years</h2>
   
<p>Most of what is known of Du Fu’s life comes from his own poems.   Like many other Chinese poets, he came from a noble family (they claimed descent from the <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Yao" id="w">emperor Yao</a>) which had fallen into relative poverty (although Hung estimates that his family income was still eleven times that of an averagely comfortable family).  He was born in 712: the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province (Gong county is a favourite candidate).   In later life he considered himself to belong to the capital city of <a href="/wiki/Chang%26%2339%3Ban" id="w">Chang&#39;an</a>.</p>
<p><div style="wigth:250px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:250px-_Dufuschina.jpg" title="Du Fu&#39;s China"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/250px-_Dufuschina.jpg" alt="Du Fu&#39;s China" title="Du Fu&#39;s China" class="location-left type-thumb" width="250px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Du Fu&#39;s China</div></div>
 Fu&#39;s mother died shortly after he was born, and he was partially raised by his aunt.  He had an elder brother, who died young.   He also had three half brothers and one half sister, to whom he frequently refers in his poems, although he never mentions his stepmother.  </p>
<p>As the son of a minor scholar-official, his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant: study and memorisation of the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_classic_texts" id="w">Confucian classics</a> of <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" id="w">philosophy</a>, history and poetry.  He later claimed to have produced creditable poems by his early teens, but these have been lost.</p>
<p>In the early 730s he travelled in the <a href="/wiki/Jiangsu" id="w">Jiangsu</a>/<a href="/wiki/Zhejiang" id="w">Zhejiang</a> area; his earliest surviving poem, describing a poetry contest, is thought to date from the end of this period, around 735.  
In that year he travelled to <a href="/wiki/Chang%26%2339%3Ban" id="w">Chang&#39;an</a> to take the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_examination" id="w">civil service exam</a> but was unsuccessful, to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics.  Hung concludes that he probably failed because his <a href="/wiki/Prose" id="w">prose</a> style at the time was too dense and obscure, while Chou suggests that his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame.  After this failure he went back to travelling, this time around <a href="/wiki/Shandong" id="w">Shandong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hebei" id="w">Hebei</a>.</p>
<p>His father died around 740.  Du Fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father&#39;s rank, but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers.   He spent the next four years living in the Luoyang area, fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 744 he met <a href="/wiki/Li_Bai" id="w">Li Bai</a> (Li Po) for the first time, and the two poets formed a somewhat one-sided friendship: Du Fu was by some years the younger, while Li Bai was already a poetic star.  We have twelve poems to or about Li Bai from the younger poet, but only one in the other direction.  They met again only once, in 745.  </p>
<p>In 746 he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career.   He participated in a second exam the following year, but all the candidates were failed by the <a href="/wiki/Prime_minister" id="w">prime minister</a> (apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals).   Thereafter he never again attempted the examinations, instead petitioning the emperor directly in 751, 754 and probably again in 755.  He married around 752, and by 757 the couple had had five children—three sons and two daughters—but one of the sons died in infancy in 755.  From 754 he began to have lung problems (probably <a href="/wiki/Asthma" id="w">asthma</a>), the first of a series of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life. It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region.<sup id="_ref-ebrey 103_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey 103" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 755 he finally received an appointment as Registrar of the Right Commandant&#39;s office of the Crown Prince&#39;s Palace.  Although this was a minor post, in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career.  Even before he had begun work, however, the position was swept away by events.</p>
<a id="War" name="War"></a><h2>War</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/An_Lushan_Rebellion" id="w">An Lushan Rebellion</a> began in December 755, and was not completely crushed for almost eight years.  It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society: the census of 754 recorded 52.9 million people, but that of 764 just 16.9 million, the remainder having been killed or displaced.
During this time, Du Fu led a largely itinerant life, being kept unsettled by <a href="/wiki/War" id="w">wars</a>, associated <a href="/wiki/Famine" id="w">famines</a> and <a href="/wiki/Emperor_of_China" id="w">imperial</a> displeasure.  This period of unhappiness, however, was the making of Du Fu as a poet: Eva Shan Chou has written that, &#34;What he saw around him&#8211; the lives of his family, neighbors, and strangers&#8211; what he heard, and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns&#8211; these became the enduring themes of his poetry&#34;.<sup id="_ref-chou 62_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 62" title="">[5]</a></sup> Even when he learned of the death of his youngest child, he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own misfortunes.<sup id="_ref-ebrey 103_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey 103" title="">[1]</a></sup> Du Fu wrote:</p>
<dl><dd>&#34;<i>Brooding on what I have lived through, if even I know such suffering, the common man must surely be rattled by the winds.</i>&#34;<sup id="_ref-ebrey 103_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey 103" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>In 756 <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Xuanzong_of_Tang_China" id="w">Emperor Xuanzong</a> was forced to flee the capital and abdicate.  Du Fu, who had been away from the city, took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join up with the <a href="/wiki/Royal_court" id="w">court</a> of the new emperor (<a href="/wiki/Emperor_Suzong_of_Tang_China" id="w">Suzong</a>), but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang’an. In the autumn, his youngest son Du Zongwu (Baby Bear) was born.  Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted <a href="/wiki/Malaria" id="w">malaria</a>.  </p>
<p>He escaped from Chang&#39;an the following year, and was appointed Reminder when he rejoined the court in May 757.  This post gave access to the emperor, but was largely ceremonial.   Du Fu&#39;s conscientiousness compelled him to try to make use of it: he soon caused trouble for himself by protesting against the removal of his friend and patron <a href="/wiki/Fang_Guan" id="w">Fang Guan</a> on a petty charge; he was then himself arrested, but was <a href="/wiki/Pardon" id="w">pardoned</a> in June.  He was granted leave to visit his family in September, but he soon rejoined the court and on <a href="/wiki/December_8" id="w">December 8</a> <a href="/wiki/757" id="w">757</a>, he returned to Chang’an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces.   However, his advice continued to be unappreciated, and in the summer of 758 he was demoted to a post as Commissioner of Education in Huazhou.  The position was not to his taste: in one poem, he wrote:</p>
<dl><dd>&#34;<i>I am about to scream madly in the office/Especially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk</i>.&#34;</dd></dl>
<p>He moved on again in the summer of 759; this has traditionally been ascribed to famine, but Hung believes that frustration is a more likely reason.   He next spent around six weeks in Qinzhou (now <a href="/wiki/Tianshui" id="w">Tianshui</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gansu" id="w">Gansu</a> province), where he wrote over sixty poems.</p>
<a id="Chengdu" name="Chengdu"></a><h2>Chengdu</h2>
<p>In 760 he arrived in <a href="/wiki/Chengdu" id="w">Chengdu</a> (<a href="/wiki/Sichuan" id="w">Sichuan</a> province), where he based himself for most of the next five years.   By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble, and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances.  He was relieved by Yan Wu, a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu.  Despite his financial problems, this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life, and many of his poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life in his famous &#34;<a href="/wiki/Du_Fu_Cao_Tang" id="w">thatched hut</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ebrey 103_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey 103" title="">[1]</a></sup>
In 762 he left the city to escape a rebellion, but he returned in the summer of 764 and was appointed military advisor to Yan, who was involved in campaigns against the <a href="/wiki/Tibet" id="w">Tibetans</a>.</p>
<a id="Last_years" name="Last_years"></a><h2>Last years</h2>
<p>Luoyang, the region of his birthplace, was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the <a href="/wiki/Yangtze_River" id="w">Yangtze</a>, apparently with the intention of making their way back there.  They travelled slowly, held up by his ill-health (by this time he was suffering from poor <a href="/wiki/Eyesight" id="w">eyesight</a>, <a href="/wiki/Deafness" id="w">deafness</a> and general <a href="/wiki/Old_age" id="w">old age</a> in addition to his previous ailments).  They stayed in Kuizhou (now <a href="/wiki/Baidicheng" id="w">Baidicheng</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chongqing" id="w">Chongqing</a>) at the entrance to the <a href="/wiki/Three_Gorges" id="w">Three Gorges</a> for almost two years from late spring 766.  This period was Du Fu&#39;s last great poetic flowering, and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense, late style. 
In autumn 766 Bo Maolin became governor of the region: he supported Du Fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary.  </p>
<p>In March 768 he began his journey again and got as far as <a href="/wiki/Hunan" id="w">Hunan</a> province, where he died in Tanzhou (now <a href="/wiki/Changsha" id="w">Changsha</a>) in November or December 770, in his 59th year. He was survived by his wife and two sons, who remained in the area for some years at least.   His last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from <a href="/wiki/Yuan_Zhen" id="w">Yuan Zhen</a> in 813.</p>
<p>Hung summarises his life by concluding that, &#34;He appeared to be a filial son, an affectionate father, a generous brother, a faithful husband, a loyal friend, a dutiful official, and a patriotic subject.&#34;</p>

Criticism of Du Fu&#39;s works has focused on his strong sense of history, his moral engagement, and his technical excellence.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>

<p>Since the <a href="/wiki/Song_dynasty" id="w">Song dynasty</a> Du Fu has been called by critics the &#34;poet <a href="/wiki/Historian" id="w">historian</a>&#34; (詩史 <i>shī shǐ</i>).  The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on <a href="/wiki/Military_tactic" id="w">military tactics</a> or the successes and failures of the government, or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor.  Indirectly, he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself, and on the ordinary people of China.  As Watson notes, this is information &#34;of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era&#34;.<sup id="_ref-chou xvii_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou xvii" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Du Fu&#39;s political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation: his prescriptions have been paraphrased as, &#34;Let us all be less selfish, let us all do what we are supposed to do&#34;.<sup id="_ref-chou 16_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 16" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Since his views were impossible to disagree with, however, his forcefully expressed truisms enabled his installation as the central figure of Chinese poetic history.</p>
<a id="Moral_engagement" name="Moral_engagement"></a><h2>Moral engagement</h2>

<p>A second favourite <a href="/wiki/Epithet" id="w">epithet</a> of Chinese critics is that of &#34;poet sage&#34; (詩聖 <i>shī shèng</i>), a counterpart to the philosophical sage, <a href="/wiki/Confucius" id="w">Confucius</a>.  One of the earliest surviving works, <i>The Song of the Wagons</i> (from around 750), gives voice to the sufferings of a <a href="/wiki/Conscription" id="w">conscript</a> soldier in the imperial army, even before the beginning of the rebellion; this poem brings out the tension between the need of acceptance and fulfilment of one&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Duty" id="w">duties</a>, and a clear-sighted consciousness of the suffering which this can involve.  These themes are continuously articulated in the poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians which Du Fu produced throughout his life.</p>
<p>Although Du Fu&#39;s frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all-consuming <a href="/wiki/Solipsism" id="w">solipsism</a>, Hawkes argues that his &#34;famous compassion in fact includes himself, viewed quite objectively and almost as an afterthought&#34;.  He therefore &#34;lends grandeur&#34; to the wider picture by comparing it to &#34;his own slightly comical triviality&#34;.<sup id="_ref-chou 204_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 204" title="">[8]</a></sup>   </p>
<p>Du Fu&#39;s compassion, for himself and for others, was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry: he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment.   Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu, &#34;everything in this world is poetry&#34;,<sup id="_ref-chou 67_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 67" title="">[9]</a></sup> and he wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life, calligraphy, paintings, animals and other poems.</p>
<a id="Technical_excellence" name="Technical_excellence"></a><h2>Technical excellence</h2>

<p>Du Fu&#39;s work is notable above all for its range. Chinese critics traditionally used the term 集大成 (jídàchéng- &#34;complete symphony&#34;), a reference to <a href="/wiki/Mencius" id="w">Mencius</a>&#39; description of <a href="/wiki/Confucius" id="w">Confucius</a>.  <a href="/wiki/Yuan_Zhen" id="w">Yuan Zhen</a> was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu&#39;s achievement, writing in 813 that his predecessor, &#34;united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly&#34;.<sup id="_ref-chou 42_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 42" title="">[10]</a></sup> He mastered all the forms of <a href="/wiki/Chinese_poetry" id="w">Chinese poetry</a>: Chou says that in every form he &#34;either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples&#34;.<sup id="_ref-chou 56_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 56" title="">[11]</a></sup> Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of <a href="/wiki/Register_(linguistics)" id="w">registers</a>, from the direct and <a href="/wiki/Colloquial" id="w">colloquial</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Allusion" id="w">allusive</a> and self-consciously literary. The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings (&#34;<a href="/wiki/Chameleon" id="w">chameleon</a>-like&#34; according to Watson): his earliest works are in a relatively derivative, courtly style, but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion.  Owen comments on the &#34;grim simplicity&#34; of the Qinzhou poems, which mirrors the desert landscape;<sup id="_ref-chou 425_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 425" title="">[12]</a></sup> the works from his Chengdu period are &#34;light, often finely observed&#34;;<sup id="_ref-chou 427_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 427" title="">[13]</a></sup> while the poems from the late Kuizhou period have a &#34;density and power of vision&#34;.<sup id="_ref-chou 433_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 433" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although he wrote in all poetic forms, Du Fu is best known for his <i><a href="/wiki/Shi_(poetry)#Jintishi" id="w">lǜshi</a></i>, a type of poem with strict constraints on the form and content of the work. About two thirds of his 1500 extant works are in this form, and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent. His best <i>lǜshi</i> use the parallelisms required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions.  Hawkes comments that, &#34;it is amazing that Tu Fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner&#34;.<sup id="_ref-chou 46_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 46" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Influence" name="Influence"></a><h1>Influence</h1>

<p>In his lifetime, and immediately following his death, Du Fu was not greatly appreciated.  In part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations, some of which are still &#34;considered extremely daring and bizarre by Chinese critics&#34;.<sup id="_ref-hawkes 4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hawkes 4" title="">[16]</a></sup>  There are few contemporary references to him—only eleven poems from six writers—and these describe him in terms of affection, but not as a paragon of poetic or moral ideals.<sup id="_ref-chou 30_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 30" title="">[17]</a></sup>  Du Fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry.</p>
<p>However, as Hung notes, he &#34;is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time&#34;,<sup id="_ref-chou 1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 1" title="">[18]</a></sup> and in the ninth century he began to increase in popularity.   Early positive comments came from <a href="/wiki/Bai_Juyi" id="w">Bai Juyi</a>, who praised the moral sentiments of some of Du Fu&#39;s works (although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems), and from <a href="/wiki/Han_Yu" id="w">Han Yu</a>, who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and <a href="/wiki/Li_Bai" id="w">Li Bai</a> on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them.   By the beginning of the 10th century, <a href="/wiki/Wei_Zhuang" id="w">Wei Zhuang</a> had constructed the first replica of his thatched cottage in Sichuan.</p>
<p>It was in the 11th century, during the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Song" id="w">Northern Song</a> era that Du Fu&#39;s reputation reached its peak.   In this period a comprehensive re-evaluation of earlier poets took place, in which <a href="/wiki/Wang_Wei_(8th_century_poet)" id="w">Wang Wei</a>, Li Bai and Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" id="w">Buddhist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Taoism" id="w">Taoist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Confucianism" id="w">Confucian</a> strands of Chinese culture.<sup id="_ref-chou 26_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 26" title="">[19]</a></sup>  At the same time, the development of <a href="/wiki/Neo-Confucianism" id="w">Neo-Confucianism</a> ensured that Du Fu, as its poetic exemplar, occupied the paramount position.<sup id="_ref-ch'en 265_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ch'en 265" title="">[20]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Su_Shi" id="w">Su Shi</a> famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was &#34;preeminent... because... through all his vicissitudes, he never for the space of a meal forgot his sovereign&#34;.<sup id="_ref-chou 23_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 23" title="">[21]</a></sup>  His influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites: political <a href="/wiki/Conservatism" id="w">conservatives</a> were attracted by his loyalty to the established order, while political <a href="/wiki/Radicalism_(historical)" id="w">radicals</a> embraced his concern for the poor.  Literary conservatives could look to his technical mastery, while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations.  Since the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_China" id="w">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>, Du Fu&#39;s loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism, and he has been praised for his use of simple, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Vernacular_Chinese" id="w">people&#39;s language</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-chou 66_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chou 66" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Du Fu&#39;s popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>: it was hard for any Chinese poet <i>not</i> to be influenced by him.  While there was never another Du Fu, individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work: <a href="/wiki/Bai_Juyi" id="w">Bai Juyi</a>&#39;s concern for the poor, <a href="/wiki/Lu_You" id="w">Lu You</a>&#39;s patriotism, and <a href="/wiki/Mei_Yaochen" id="w">Mei Yaochen</a>&#39;s reflections on the quotidian are a few examples.  More broadly, Du Fu&#39;s work in transforming the <i>lǜshi</i> from mere <a href="/wiki/Word_play" id="w">word play</a> into &#34;a vehicle for serious poetic utterance&#34;<sup id="_ref-watson 270_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-watson 270" title="">[23]</a></sup> set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre.</p>
<p>Du Fu has also been influential beyond China, although in common with the other High Tang poets, his reception into the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_literature" id="w">Japanese</a> literary culture was relatively late.  It was not until the 17th century that he was accorded the same respect in Japan as in China, but he then had a particular influence on <a href="/wiki/Matsuo_Bash%C5%8D" id="w">Matsuo Bashō</a>.  In the 20th century, he was the favourite poet of <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Rexroth" id="w">Kenneth Rexroth</a>, who has described him as &#34;the greatest non-<a href="/wiki/Epic_poetry" id="w">epic</a>, non <a href="/wiki/Drama" id="w">dramatic</a> poet who has survived in any language&#34;, and commented that, &#34;he has made me a better man, as a moral agent and as a perceiving organism&#34;.<sup id="_ref-rexroth 135 137_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rexroth 135 137" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Translation" name="Translation"></a><h1>Translation</h1>

<p>There have been a number of notable translations of Du Fu’s work into English. The translators have each had to contend with the same problems of bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding laboured to the western ear (particularly when translating <i>lǜshi</i>), and of dealing with the allusions contained particularly in the later works (Hawkes writes that &#34;his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation&#34;—p. ix). One extreme on each issue is represented by <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Rexroth" id="w">Kenneth Rexroth</a>’s <i><a href="/wiki/One_Hundred_Poems_From_the_Chinese" id="w">One Hundred Poems From the Chinese</a></i>. His are free translations, which seek to conceal the parallelisms through <a href="/wiki/Enjambement" id="w">enjambement</a> and expansion and contraction of the content; his responses to the allusions are firstly to omit most of these poems from his selection, and secondly to “translate out” the references in those works which he does select.</p>
<p>An example of the opposite approach is <a href="/wiki/Burton_Watson" id="w">Burton Watson</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Selected_Poems_of_Du_Fu" id="w">The Selected Poems of Du Fu</a></i>. Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly, persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa. Similarly, he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive <a href="/wiki/Annotation" id="w">annotation</a>.</p>
