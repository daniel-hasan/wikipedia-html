<a id="Plot_summary" name="Plot_summary"></a><h2>Plot summary</h2>
<p>The film begins with Alice (<a href="/wiki/Milla_Jovovich" id="w">Milla Jovovich</a>) recalling the key events from the first film. On <a href="/wiki/September_29" id="w">September 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, exactly thirteen hours after the <a href="/wiki/T-Virus" id="w">T-Virus</a> <a href="/wiki/Outbreak" id="w">outbreak</a> in The Hive, the <a href="/wiki/Umbrella_Corporation" id="w">Umbrella Corporation</a> sends in a research team to re-open the <a href="/wiki/Complex" id="w">complex</a>. The team enters The Hive through a secret insertion point beneath <a href="/wiki/Raccoon_City" id="w">Raccoon City</a>. Shortly after entering the <a href="/wiki/Research" id="w">research</a> <a href="/wiki/Facility" id="w">facility</a>, the entire team is then slaughtered by the T-Virus <a href="/wiki/Zombie" id="w">zombies</a> that had been sealed within the complex. With the entrance now open, Umbrella realizes that the highly infectious zombies will make their way to the surface and begin a full-scale <a href="/wiki/Outbreak" id="w">outbreak</a> on <a href="/wiki/Raccoon_City" id="w">Raccoon City</a>.</p>
<p>Some four hours later, much of Raccoon City lies in devastation after the outbreak. Umbrella has established a security perimeter around the city to keep the zombies in the quarantine area. As civilians reach the local checkpoints around the city, Umbrella operatives check them for infection. Soon, the infection reaches the quarantined gates, and <a href="/wiki/Major_Timothy_Cain" id="w">Major Timothy Cain</a> (<a href="/wiki/Thomas_Kretschmann" id="w">Thomas Kretschmann</a>), Umbrella&#39;s security general, orders all checkpoints closed for good, leaving no exceptions. All civilians are ordered to return to the city or Umbrella will open fire on them. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alice wakes up in a downtown <a href="/wiki/Hospital" id="w">hospital</a>, and recalls her recent memories. After surviving The Hive, Alice was recovered by Umbrella and used for experimentation. She has gained superhuman powers because the T-virus bonded with her on a cellular level. Outside, she sees the devastated streets and makes her way to a police car and after a quick search finds a shotgun and grabs it to face the coming apocalypse.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Olivera" id="w">Carlos Olivera</a> (<a href="/wiki/Oded_Fehr" id="w">Oded Fehr</a>) and two other Umbrella soldiers link up with multiple <a href="/wiki/S.T.A.R.S._(Resident_Evil)" id="w">S.T.A.R.S.</a> units and attempt to hold against an onslaught of zombies in the street. There are too many zombies to handle and they are eventually overrun. Carlos and his team fall back, but one is bitten and the group realize Umbrella had betrayed them.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jill_Valentine_(Resident_Evil_film)" id="w">Jill Valentine</a> (<a href="/wiki/Sienna_Guillory" id="w">Sienna Guillory</a>) (a Raccoon S.T.A.R.S. unit member) together with <a href="/wiki/Terri_Morales" id="w">Terri Morales</a> (a news reporter) and <a href="/wiki/Peyton_Wells" id="w">Peyton Wells</a> retreat to a church, where they are attacked by <a href="/wiki/Licker" id="w">Lickers</a>. They are saved by Alice, who informs them that Umbrella&#39;s next step will be to nuke Raccoon City to stop the infection and silence any survivors. They decide to join together to try and escape the city. </p>
<p>Umbrella immediately sends their latest project, <a href="/wiki/Nemesis_(Resident_Evil)" id="w">Nemesis</a> to kill all S.T.A.R.S. operatives. He encounters <a href="/wiki/L.J._(Resident_Evil)" id="w">L.J.</a> (<a href="/wiki/Mike_Epps" id="w">Mike Epps</a>), a cab driver, and thirteen other members of S.T.A.R.S, who begin to attack it. Nemesis shrugs off their small-arms fire and easily kills them all, but spares L.J. when he drops his weapons.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Dr._Charles_Ashford" id="w">Dr. Charles Ashford</a>, a key Umbrella scientist and creator of the T-virus, has refused extraction by Umbrella until he has located and rescued his daughter <a href="/wiki/Angela_Ashford" id="w">Angela</a>. He hacks into Raccoon City&#39;s network of security cameras, and determines that she is at a school building. He also notices Alice and her group and contacts them, offering to arrange for an evacuation in exchange for rescuing Angela. Inside the school, the group encounters Carlos and his men, who have been given the same offer. After various encounters with <a href="/wiki/List_of_Resident_Evil_creatures#Cerberus or Zombie Dog" id="w">zombie dogs</a> and infected children who eventually kill Terri, Carlos becomes the last survivor of his men and Alice loses an ally as well, but they manage to find Angela, and the remaining survivors escape the school. </p>
<p>Ashford gives them the location to the evacuation helicopter. Unfortunately Major Cain has been aware of the plan, and captures them, killing Ashford and sends Nemesis to fight Alice. She defeats Nemesis, but realizes  his true identity (her former friend, <a href="/wiki/Matt_Addison" id="w">Matt Addison</a>) and refuses to deliver the killing blow. Her mercy appears to rekindle a trace of Nemesis&#39;s former humanity, and they join forces and attack the Umbrella troops. Nemesis is killed in the ensuing fight, and Alice and the others escape in the helicopter, leaving Major Cain (unable to commit suicide because he has used up the available rounds in his handgun fending off the zombies) to be eaten just before the city is nuked.</p>
<p>The helicopter is caught up in the blast radius and crashes into the Arklay Mountains. Alice is impaled by a loose metal pole, presumably fatally, but she is found and recovered by Umbrella. She is taken to another Umbrella research station, where, after several weeks, she awakens in a giant water tank, completely healed of her injuries. Led by Umbrella scientist <a href="/wiki/Dr._Isaacs" id="w">Dr. Isaacs</a>, the doctors release and begin to question her. At first, she appears to have no memory, but soon a rapid series of images of recent events come flashing back in her mind, and she states with contempt &#34;<i>My name is Alice… and I remember everything.</i>&#34; She fights her way out of the facility showing some of her darkest powers yet, only to be surrounded by dozens of armed guards. Suddenly, Jill, Carlos, and L.J. pull up in a SUV, disguised as Umbrella employees. Carlos shows the guards a written order placing her in his custody. They allow Alice to go, and as she enters the waiting vehicle, she sees Angela in the back seat. As they drive away, Angela asks Alice if she is alright. Alice doesn&#39;t respond, and Dr. Isaacs is shown saying, &#34;Program Alice Activated.&#34; A close-up of her eye shows a flashing Umbrella logo as the film comes to an end.</p>

<p>Prior to filming, just as in the first movie, actors playing zombies were trained at a zombie &#34;<a href="/wiki/Boot_camp" id="w">boot camp</a>.&#34; Actors were coached to act as zen-zombies (a creature that relentlessly follows its target) and <i>liquid</i> zombies. Anderson and other crew members were tempted to make the zombies move faster but decided that it would be breaking with a fundamental element of the games. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Nemesis_(Resident_Evil)" id="w">Nemesis</a> was an actor in a suit, <a href="/wiki/Matthew_G._Taylor" id="w">Matthew G. Taylor</a>, with only special-effects applied to certain parts of the characters body (such as the eye of the creature). Despite Taylor being 1.98 metres (approx. 6 feet, 6 inches) in height he was still considered too short, to hide this the character wears large boots and in many scenes the Nemesis was stretched to appear taller.</p>
<p>The same dog-team was used for the zombie-dogs as in the first. The look of the <a href="/wiki/Dobermann" id="w">dogs</a> was achieved through a combination of make-up and computer-effects. Due to the dogs&#39; reluctance to dive through a sugar-glass window as they had done before, the window in the scene was done in CGI. </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/List_of_Resident_Evil_creatures#Licker" id="w">Lickers</a> were fully computer-generated this time, though the use of physical puppets was considered for a while. To avert the problems faced during the production of the first film, the CGI work of the lickers began early in production.</p>

<p>The <i>Regenerate</i> &#34;commercial&#34;, directed by <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Nispel" id="w">Marcus Nispel</a>, was a teaser trailer for the second <i>Resident Evil</i> movie, and can be seen in the movie on a <a href="/wiki/TV" id="w">TV</a> screen in the female scientist&#39;s house.

<i>Apocalypse</i> received even more negative reactions from the critics than the first film. The film appears only 20% fresh on <a href="/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" id="w">Rotten Tomatoes</a> (22 out of 112 reviews are counted fresh).<sup id="_ref-Rotten Tomatoes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rotten Tomatoes" title="">[23]</a></sup> Tim Cogshell from the <i>Box Office Magazine</i> stated that <i>Apocalypse</i> is <i>&#34;superior to the original film.&#34;</i> Robert Dominguez, from <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Daily_News" id="w">New York Daily News</a></i> stated that the film <i>&#34;should please the target audience.&#34;</i> Walter Chaw from <i>Film Freak Central</i> states that <i>Apocalypse</i> is <i>&#34;An awful sequel to an awful film.&#34;</i></p>
<p>Film critic Victoria Alexander (from FilmsInReview.com) said “If you like tough chicks killing zombies, RE:A is for you,” although she nonetheless noted that “Screenwriter Paul W.S. Anderson doesn’t bog down the film with philosophical subtext or explain the zombies,” which she acknowledges are probably not “questions ...suitable for the demographics targeted.”<sup id="_ref-Rotten Tomatoes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rotten Tomatoes" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critic Sean Axmaker gave the film a grade of C+, and said that the director’s “headlong pace that favors action over spectacle... helps distract from all but the most contrived and absurd turns of Anderson&#39;s slapdash script.” Critic Dragan Antulovbigger gave the film 5/10. He noted the more spectacular setting (made possible by the bigger budget than the initial film), “deadlier weapons...[an] increased number of explosions[, and an] increased body count.” He said that despite the “shallowness of the content” there was “interesting production design and energetic direction.”<sup id="_ref-Rotten Tomatoes_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rotten Tomatoes" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Reviewer Roger Ebert gave the film one half of a star, calling it an “utterly meaningless waste of time”, “a dead zone, a film without interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and special effects.”  Chris Alexander of Rue Morgue Magazine said that “RE2 is a dreary, incoherent mess of a movie, failing on almost every conceivable level and having the dubious distinction of rendering hordes of shambling, screaming cannibalistic zombies boring.” Alexander stated that the director “Witt can’t stage an action sequence,” said that the lead actress “looks bored,” called the score “useless” and said that the “effects are more like defects.”<sup id="_ref-Rotten Tomatoes_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rotten Tomatoes" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Film critic Rob Blackwelder called  &#34;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&#34; “inept, unoriginal, [and] asinine”, and stated that it is “on the Worst of 2004 list.” Blackwelder criticized the film as a
a “braindead disaster” with “pathetic... leaden mindlessness,” with “impossibly stupid and nonsensical plot defects.” He stated that the film was “overflowing with off-the-shelf action-hack staples” and “tiresome stereotypes,” and directed with a lack of “narrative or cinematic sense.”<sup id="_ref-Rotten Tomatoes_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rotten Tomatoes" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Walter Chaw of Film Freak Central, who gave the film half a star out of four, criticized the “shoddiness of the make-up” and the lack of “critical biographical/geographical details.” He states that the editing seems like it was “edited with a weed whacker.” Chaw notes that “an entire sequence” was “lifted whole from La Femme Nikita.” While Chaw admits to loving genre films, he states that films like this “lowe[r] the conversation even lower than it already is.” In all, Chaw says “no artistry[–] it ain&#39;t good.” Reviewer Anthony Del Valle calls the film “yawn of the dead,” and laments “how little the writer develops the idea, and how the director turns his back on every opportunity to creatively exploit the situation.<sup id="_ref-Rotten Tomatoes_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rotten Tomatoes" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Box_office" name="Box_office"></a><h3>Box office</h3>
<p>The film grossed <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">$23</a>,036,273 on its opening weekend (<a href="/wiki/September_10" id="w">September 10</a>-<a href="/wiki/September_12" id="w">12</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>).

<p>The film&#39;s success spawned one sequel, <i><a href="/wiki/Resident_Evil:_Extinction" id="w">Extinction</a></i>, the official web-site of which claims it will be the last film in the series, although a fourth film is rumoured if Extinction does well at the box office.</p>

</p><a id="Introduction_Scenes" name="Introduction_Scenes"></a><h4>Introduction Scenes</h4>

<ul>
<li><i>Apocalypse</i> re-enacts certain scenes from the games (particularly the intro scenes):</li></ul><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>The car crash scene that leaves Angela Ashford stuck in Raccoon City is reminiscent to the intro of <i>Resident Evil 2</i> , which forces <a href="/wiki/Leon_S._Kennedy" id="w">Leon S. Kennedy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Claire_Redfield" id="w">Claire Redfield</a> to separate on their way to the police station.</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>The scene where Alice runs through the building with an Umbrella helicopter firing at her, up to the point where she drops her gun, falls, re-grabs it and fires, is reminiscent to the intro scene of <i><a href="/wiki/Resident_Evil_Code:_Veronica" id="w">Resident Evil Code: Veronica</a></i> in which <a href="/wiki/Claire_Redfield" id="w">Claire Redfield</a> does the same thing.</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>The scene in which <a href="/wiki/Raccoon_City" id="w">Raccoon City</a> is being overrun by zombies, and the police and <a href="/wiki/Umbrella_Corporation" id="w">Umbrella</a> mercenaries are fighting back, up to the point in which a zombie reflects off a fallen police helmet, is reminiscent to the intro scene of <i>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.</i> The launching of the missile to complete sanitation is also a scene similar to that of one in the game.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<a id="Resident_Evil" name="Resident_Evil"></a><h4>Resident Evil</h4>

<ul>
<li>The crash site of the helicopter is located in the <a href="/wiki/Arklay_Mountains" id="w">Arklay Forest</a> near the Arklay Mountains, where the <i><a href="/wiki/Resident_Evil_(series)" id="w">Resident Evil</a></i> series first began.</li>
<li>In the abandoned church and school, Jill moves and points the gun the exact same way she does in the game.</li>
<li>Terri&#39;s death is similar to Kenneth&#39;s death (<i>RE1</i> remake) which is also recorded, though the latter was mauled by the zombie, not children.</li>
<li>A white goddess statue can be seen in the church. Artwork of goddesses has a large role within the puzzles in the <i>Resident Evil</i> series.</li>
<li>On the <i>Arklay Overpass</i>, Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, as if the whole thing were some sort of sick game. <i>Resident Evil: Apocalypse</i> is, of course, an adaptation of a series of games and the fixed camera perspective in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera&#39;s perspective.</li>
<li>The scene were Jill finds a gun under the church is mirroring when you play the game you find ammo or guns in certain areas</li></ul>
<a id="Resident_Evil_2" name="Resident_Evil_2"></a><h4>Resident Evil 2</h4>

<ul>
<li>Alice&#39;s visit to the gun shop at the start of <i>Apocalypse</i> is a reference to <i>Resident Evil 2</i>, where Leon takes shelter in a gun shop.</li>
<li>The character Angela Ashford may be a concept borrowed from <a href="/wiki/Sherry_Birkin" id="w">Sherry Birkin</a>, as they are both children, dressed in school uniforms, in need of rescue. Both of their fathers are also researchers working for Umbrella. The Ashford name, however, comes from the founders of Umbrella revealed in <i>Resident Evil : Code Veronica</i>.</li></ul>
<a id="Resident_Evil_3:_Nemesis" name="Resident_Evil_3:_Nemesis"></a><h4>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</h4>

<ul>
<li>Jill wears the same outfit from <i><a href="/wiki/Resident_Evil_3:_Nemesis" id="w">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></i> with only minor changes.</li>
<li>Like his video game counterpart, Nemesis only speaks one word (&#34;S.T.A.R.S.&#34;). Unlike his video game counterpart, he only speaks this line once whereas in the game, Nemesis speaks this line constantly during every encounter.</li>
<li>The graveyard scene is a reference to the <i>Resident Evil Remake</i>, <i>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</i>, and <i>Resident Evil Code: Veronica</i>, where zombies also pop out of their graves.</li>
<li>The nuclear weapon approach and explosion is a shot-for-shot recreation of the equivalent scene in the videogame&#39;s finale.</li>
<li>There is, what seems to be a clocktower in the background in the movie. This could possibly be linked to the clocktower that is seen in the game.</li></ul>

<td><a href="/wiki/Raccoon_City" id="w">Raccoon City</a> is nuked by Umbrella in an effort to cover up the outbreak. With <a href="/wiki/Umbrella_Corporation" id="w">Umbrella</a>&#39;s marketing and economic muscle, they are able to manipulate the media into reporting it as an incident at the nuclear plant.</td>
<td>The <a href="/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" id="w">US government</a> orders a missile strike on Raccoon City after a group of Tyrants defeated elements of the armed forces in a battle near an abandoned factory on the outskirts of the town (the aftermath of this battle can be seen in <i>Resident Evil 3</i>). Despite the political maneuvering of Umbrella, who wanted to study the effects of the city-wide infection, the strike is initiated. Later on in <i><a href="/wiki/Resident_Evil_4" id="w">Resident Evil 4</a></i>, it is known that the US government suspended the activities of Umbrella.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>The <a href="/wiki/T-Virus" id="w">T-Virus</a> can be used for medical applications. It helped Angie to walk.</td>
<td>In the games the virus is said to regenerate body cells, but it is unknown whether it works correctly to all body cells and can actually create a &#39;cure&#39; for (muscle) disease, and if it can be controlled by an anti-virus. The only proven application of the T-Virus is to create bioweapons. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Lickers are created by injecting the T-Virus directly into living tissue. When they taste fresh blood, they mutate.</td>
<td>Lickers are created when people infected by the T-Virus are exposed to a second dose. These creatures are accidental and were created due to the circumstances of the outbreak. They do not mutate after tasting blood.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/wiki/Nemesis_(Resident_Evil)" id="w">Nemesis</a> is killed after defending Alice from gunfire. It might be possible that the damage it received wasn&#39;t bad enough to make it mutate, but this is only a suggestion from the game. Though its  mutations from <a href="/wiki/Nemesis_(Resident_Evil)" id="w">Nemesis</a> did not really show.
</td>
<td>Nemesis is killed after being dodged by Jill for a majority of the outbreak. After a series of battles, the Nemesis is reduced to a nebulous blob finally put to rest by one shot from the &#34;Paracelsus Sword&#34; weapon, a fixed magnetic coil gun brought in by US armed forces to fight off a squad of Tyrants; and if so chosen by the player, five rounds from Jill&#39;s magnum revolver.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Nemesis does not have tentacles, but does have a Gatling Gun and Rocket Launcher.</td>
<td>Nemesis uses his T- infected tentacles (Actually the &#39;roots&#39; of the Nemesis-parasite coming out through the host&#39;s body) to attack enemies as well as a Rocket Launcher. S.T.A.R.S. member <a href="/wiki/Brad_Vickers" id="w">Brad Vickers</a> was killed with his tentacles, and later resumed animation as a zombie (only to be killed by either <a href="/wiki/Leon_S._Kennedy" id="w">Leon S. Kennedy</a> or <a href="/wiki/Claire_Redfield" id="w">Claire Redfield</a>).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>The outbreak in Raccoon occurred as a result of Umbrella researchers re-opening the Hive. The city is infected within hours.</td>
<td>The outbreak occurs as a combination of monsters left over from the mansion incident and an assassination attempt on William Birkin for his G-Virus sample. As the assassin escaped with his work, Birkin injects himself with the G-Virus and wreaks havoc. In the process, the T-Virus is spilled and the rodent population in the sewer are infected, slowly spreading the virus to the citizens. The city is infected in less than a week.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>The T-Virus is said to cause uncontrolled mutation.</td>
<td>The G-Virus is the only virus that mutates uncontrollably and it cannot be passed by bites, but according to Anette Birkin (William Birkin&#39;s wife) &#34;it is able to revitalize cellular functions&#34;. It requires direct inoculation or embryos implanted on a genetically compatible host. However in <i>Resident Evil 2</i> the T-Virus is described as &#34;a mutagenic toxin&#34;, and even though most of its victims turn into zombies, other creatures such as the lickers, the Tyrant and (possibly) Nemesis, giant spiders, mutated sharks, and oversized lampreys are products of infection. No positive effects of the T-virus have been observed in the games.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>The Umbrella Corporation publicly flaunts their wealth and power. They funded the construction of Raccoon City and have great power worldwide.</td>
<td>The Umbrella Corporation is a powerful company, yet they deal mostly in secret. Though their contributions have led to the development of Raccoon City, they do not flaunt their international power openly. To the public, they&#39;re known as a simple medical/health corporation, akin to <a href="/wiki/Pfizer" id="w">Pfizer</a>.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Nemesis was created as part of the &#34;Nemesis Program&#34;, a project to create the ultimate bioweapon. It was created in <a href="/wiki/The_USA" id="w">America</a>. It was unleashed by Umbrella within Raccoon City to test its abilities such as wiping out S.T.A.R.S.</td>
<td>The Nemesis was an experimental bio-weapon created by the European branch by implanting a new kind of parasitic  organism into an ordinary mass-produced <a href="/wiki/Tyrant_(Resident_Evil)" id="w">Tyrant</a>. In the first game it is revealed that the real reason for S.T.A.R.S involvement in the mansion incident was Albert Wesker&#39;s intention to test the bioweapons against &#34;realistic targets&#34; (armed, trained paramilitaries/military personnel). Nemesis takes time to train and perfect, since they are programmed to hunt specific targets. In <i>Resident Evil 3</i>, its mission was to hunt down and kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. due to their involvement in the &#34;Mansion Incident.&#34;</td></tr>

<td>Alice is forced to battle the <a href="/wiki/Nemesis_(Resident_Evil)" id="w">Nemesis</a> as a final &#34;test&#34; by <a href="/wiki/Major_Timothy_Cain" id="w">Major Timothy Cain</a> to determine which bioweapon is the most powerful.  This takes place before the Nemesis&#39; death while trying to save Alice and the survivors after decidingly revolting against his creators.</td>

During the events of <i>Resident Evil 3</i>, however, Brad Vickers, the pilot of Alpha Team, is killed by Nemesis in front of the R.P.D. Precinct.
