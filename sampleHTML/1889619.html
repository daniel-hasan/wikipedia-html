<b><i>Doctor Who</i></b><b>&#39;s missing episodes</b> are the many instalments  of the long-running <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television" id="w">science fiction television</a> programme <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who" id="w">Doctor Who</a></i> that are missing, with no known <a href="/wiki/Film" id="w">film</a> or <a href="/wiki/Videotape" id="w">videotape</a> copies existing. They were <a href="/wiki/Wiping" id="w">erased</a> (or &#34;junked&#34;) by the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a> during the 1960s and 1970s for a variety of economic and space-saving reasons. In all, there are <a href="/wiki/List_of_incomplete_Doctor_Who_serials" id="w">27 serials</a> that do not exist in complete form in the BBC&#39;s archives, because 108 of  253 episodes produced during the first six years of the programme are missing, with many more thought to have been so in the past before episodes were recovered from a variety of sources, most notably overseas broadcasters.</p>
<p><i>Doctor Who</i> is not unique in this respect, as thousands of hours of programming from across all genres were destroyed up until 1978, when the BBC&#39;s archiving policies were changed. Other high-profile series affected included <i><a href="/wiki/Dad%26%2339%3Bs_Army_missing_episodes" id="w">Dad&#39;s Army</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Z-Cars" id="w">Z-Cars</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wednesday_Play" id="w">The Wednesday Play</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Steptoe_and_Son" id="w">Steptoe and Son</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Not_Only..._But_Also" id="w">Not Only... But Also</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-hunt2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hunt2" title="">[1]</a></sup> In addition, the BBC was not the only British broadcaster to carry out this practice, with <a href="/wiki/ITV" id="w">ITV</a> companies also destroying programmes; <i><a href="/wiki/The_Avengers_(TV_series)" id="w">The Avengers</a></i>, another series initiated by <i>Doctor Who</i> creator <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Newman" id="w">Sydney Newman</a>, is a high-profile ITV victim of junking.<sup id="_ref-avengers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-avengers" title="">[2]</a></sup> Unlike other series, <i>Doctor Who</i> is unique in having all of its missing episodes surviving in audio form, recorded off-air by fans at home. Additionally, every 1970s episode exists in some form, which is not the case for several other series.</p>
<p>Efforts to locate missing episodes continue, both by the BBC and by fans of the series. Extensive restoration has been carried out on many surviving and recovered 1960s and 1970s episodes for release on <a href="/wiki/VHS" id="w">VHS</a> and more recently on <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVD</a>. The surviving soundtracks of missing episodes have been released on cassette and more recently <a href="/wiki/Compact_disc" id="w">CD</a>.</p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h1>Background</h1>
<p>Between approximately 1967 and 1978, large amounts of material stored in the BBC&#39;s videotape and film libraries were destroyed or wiped to make way for newer programmes.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup> This happened for a number of reasons, the primary one being that agreements with the actors&#39; union <a href="/wiki/British_Actors%26%2339%3B_Equity_Association" id="w">Equity</a> and other trade bodies limited the number of times a single programme could be broadcast.<sup id="_ref-years3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-years3" title="">[4]</a></sup> These showings were also limited to within a set time period.<sup id="_ref-fiddy1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fiddy1" title="">[5]</a></sup> This was due to the unions&#39; fear that if the channels filled their schedules with repeats, it could lead to lower levels of production, putting actors and other staff out of work. This attitude by the unions had the unintentional side effect of causing many programmes to be junked after their repeat rights had expired, as they were considered to be of no further use to the broadcasters.<sup id="_ref-hunt1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hunt1" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Most <i>Doctor Who</i> episodes were made on <a href="/wiki/2%26quot%3B_Quadruplex_videotape" id="w">two-inch quad videotape</a> for initial broadcast and then <a href="/wiki/Telerecording" id="w">telerecorded</a> onto <a href="/wiki/16_mm_film" id="w">16 mm film</a> by <a href="/wiki/BBC_Enterprises" id="w">BBC Enterprises</a> for further commercial exploitation.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup> Enterprises used 16 mm for overseas sales as it was far cheaper to buy and easier to transport than videotape. It also circumvented the problem of different countries using different video standards, as film was a universal medium whereas videotape was not.<sup id="_ref-2book_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2book" title="">[7]</a></sup> The BBC had no central archive at the time â€” the Film Library kept programmes that had been made on <a href="/wiki/Filmstock" id="w">film</a>, while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup> BBC Enterprises kept only copies of programmes they deemed commercially exploitable. They also had little dedicated storage space and tended to keep piles of film canisters wherever they could find space for them at their Villiers House property.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p><div style="wigth:250px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:250px-Missingwho02.JPG" title="The can containing a BBC Enterprises 16 mm film telerecording print of Episode 2 of &#39;&#39;[[The Evil of the Daleks]]&#39;&#39;."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/250px-Missingwho02.JPG" alt="The can containing a BBC Enterprises 16 mm film telerecording print of Episode 2 of &#39;&#39;[[The Evil of the Daleks]]&#39;&#39;." title="The can containing a BBC Enterprises 16 mm film telerecording print of Episode 2 of &#39;&#39;[[The Evil of the Daleks]]&#39;&#39;." class="location-left type-thumb" width="250px" />

</p>
<p>The Engineering Department had no mandate to archive the programme videotapes they held, although they would not normally be wiped or junked until the relevant production department and / or BBC Enterprises had indicated that they had no further use for the tapes.<sup id="_ref-interest_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interest" title="">[8]</a></sup> The first <i>Doctor Who</i> master videotapes to be junked were those for the serial <i><a href="/wiki/The_Highlanders_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">The Highlanders</a></i>, which were erased on <a href="/wiki/March_9" id="w">March 9</a> <a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a>, only a very short time after their original transmission.<sup id="_ref-2book_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2book" title="">[7]</a></sup> Further erasing and junking of <i>Doctor Who</i> master videotapes by the Engineering Department continued into the 1970s. Eventually every single master videotape of the programme&#39;s 253 1960s episodes was destroyed or wiped, with the final 1960s mastertapes to be erased being those for the 1968 serial <i><a href="/wiki/Fury_from_the_Deep" id="w">Fury from the Deep</a></i>, which were authorised for wiping in late 1974.<sup id="_ref-interest_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interest" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the destruction of these masters, up until approximately 1972 BBC Enterprises held an almost complete archive of the series in the form of their 16 mm film telerecording copies.<sup id="_ref-withdrawn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-withdrawn" title="">[9]</a></sup> From around 1972 until 1978, BBC Enterprises also disposed of much of their older material, including many episodes of <i>Doctor Who</i>, until their <i>Doctor Who</i> junkings ceased following the intervention of <a href="/wiki/Ian_Levine" id="w">Ian Levine</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Record_producer" id="w">record producer</a> and fan of the programme.<sup id="_ref-withdrawn_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-withdrawn" title="">[9]</a></sup> Enterprises&#39; episodes were usually junked because their rights agreements with the actors and writers to sell the programmes abroad had expired.<sup id="_ref-withdrawn_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-withdrawn" title="">[9]</a></sup> With many broadcasters around the world now switching to colour transmission, it was not deemed worthwhile extending agreements to sell this older black and white material.<sup id="_ref-lion99_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lion99" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The BBC Film Library had no responsibility for storing programmes that had not been made on film, and there were conflicting views between the Film Library and BBC Enterprises over who had the responsibility of archiving programmes.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup> These combined factors resulted in the erasure of enormous quantities of older black and white programming from the BBC&#39;s various libraries. While thousands of other programmes have been destroyed in this way, the missing <i>Doctor Who</i> episodes are probably the best-known example of how the lack of a consistent programme archiving policy can have long-term effects.<sup id="_ref-fiddy1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fiddy1" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The degree of incompleteness varies, and is concentrated on the <a href="/wiki/First_Doctor" id="w">First</a> and <a href="/wiki/Second_Doctor" id="w">Second Doctor</a> stories. Although some stories have only one episode missing, others are lost altogether, with <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Troughton" id="w">Patrick Troughton</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Second_Doctor" id="w">Second Doctor</a> being particularly badly affected. From the first two seasons of the Troughton Doctor, only one story, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tomb_of_the_Cybermen" id="w">The Tomb of the Cybermen</a></i>, is complete, and this only exists due to a copy being returned from <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a>.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup> All stories starring <a href="/wiki/Jon_Pertwee" id="w">Jon Pertwee</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Third_Doctor" id="w">Third Doctor</a> are complete in the sense that all the episodes are present, but some only survive as black and white telerecordings or <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">US</a>-standard <a href="/wiki/NTSC" id="w">NTSC</a> copies.<sup id="_ref-dwm256_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm256" title="">[11]</a></sup> In order of original transmissions, the very last <i>Doctor Who</i> master videotapes to be wiped were the first episodes of the 1974 serials <i><a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Dinosaurs" id="w">Invasion of the Dinosaurs</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Death_to_the_Daleks" id="w">Death to the Daleks</a></i>.

<p>For a few years episode one of <i><a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Dinosaurs" id="w">Invasion of the Dinosaurs</a></i> was the only Pertwee episode to be entirely missing from the archives, until a black and white 16 mm copy was returned to the BBC in the early 1980s.<sup id="_ref-dwm256_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm256" title="">[11]</a></sup> Archival holdings from <i>Death to the Daleks</i> episode two onwards are complete on the original broadcast videotapes, with the exception of the final shot of episode three of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Deadly_Assassin" id="w">The Deadly Assassin</a></i> (1976).

The wiping policy officially came to an end in 1978, when the means to further exploit programmes by taking advantage of the new market in home <a href="/wiki/Videocassette_recorder" id="w">video cassette recordings</a> was beginning to become apparent. In addition, the attitude became that vintage programmes should, in any case, be preserved for posterity and historical and cultural reasons. The BBC Film Library was turned into a combined Film &#38; Videotape Library for the preservation of both media.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup> The Film Library at the time held only 47 episodes of 1960s <i>Doctor Who</i>; they had once held 53, but six episodes had either been junked or gone missing.<sup id="_ref-revisited_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-revisited" title="">[12]</a></sup> Following the transfer of episodes still held by Enterprises, there were 152 episodes of <i>Doctor Who</i> no longer held by the BBC, although subsequent efforts have reduced that number to 108, <a href="/wiki/As_of_2007" id="w">as of 2007</a>.</p>
<p>The most sought-after lost episode is episode four of the last William Hartnell serial <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tenth_Planet" id="w">The Tenth Planet</a></i>, which ends with the First Doctor <a href="/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)#Changing faces" id="w">transforming</a> into the Second. The only portion of the regeneration sequence still in existence, bar a few poor-quality silent 8 mm clips, is the few seconds of the scene which had been rebroadcast as part of a 1973 episode of <i><a href="/wiki/Blue_Peter" id="w">Blue Peter</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Compared with many BBC series broadcast in the 1960s, <i>Doctor Who</i> is comparatively well-off in terms of missing episodes.<sup id="_ref-miseps_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-miseps" title="">[13]</a></sup> 145 of the 253 episodes broadcast during the 1960s are still in existence. This is mainly due to wide overseas sales which have aided in recovery of episodes (see <a href="/wiki/#Recovery" id="w">below</a>). This is reflected in the nature of the surviving episodes&#8212;<a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season 1 (1963&amp;ndash;64)" id="w">Seasons 1</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season 2 (1964&amp;ndash;65)" id="w">2</a>, the most widely sold abroad of the 1960s episodes, are missing only nine and two episodes, respectively. Most of the episodes probably survive due to a late sale in 1973 to <a href="/wiki/Algeria" id="w">Algeria</a>; Algeria are believed to have returned their copies to BBC Enterprises after their rights to broadcast them had expired, shortly before the end of the junkings.<sup id="_ref-revisited_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-revisited" title="">[12]</a></sup> By contrast <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season 4 (1966&amp;ndash;67)" id="w">Seasons 4</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season 5 (1967&amp;ndash;68)" id="w">5</a>, which sold to fewer countries, have only one complete serial in existence between them.</p>
<p>Of all the series shown by the Corporation throughout the 1960s which had runs of significant length, only <i><a href="/wiki/Steptoe_and_Son" id="w">Steptoe and Son</a></i> can be said to have a better survival record, with all episodes existing, albeit some only in the form of early domestic videotape copies created by the writers of the programme.<sup id="_ref-steptoe_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-steptoe" title="">[14]</a></sup> Other programmes have few or no episodes in existence; <i><a href="/wiki/United!" id="w">United!</a></i>, a <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">football</a>-based <a href="/wiki/Soap_opera" id="w">soap opera</a> which broadcast 147 episodes between 1965 and 1967, has no episodes surviving at all.<sup id="_ref-united_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-united" title="">[15]</a></sup> <i>Doctor Who<b>s popularity and high profile has also helped to ensure the return of episodes which, for other less well-remembered programmes, might never have occurred.<sup id="_ref-fiddy1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fiddy1" title="">[5]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p><i>Doctor Who</i> is also comparatively rare amongst contemporaries in that all of the 1970s episodes exist in one format or another, whilst other series such as <i>Z-Cars</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Dixon_of_Dock_Green" id="w">Dixon of Dock Green</a></i> have episodes from as late as 1975 missing.<sup id="_ref-zcars_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-zcars" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dixon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dixon" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

</p>
<p>Since the archive was first audited in 1978, a number of episodes thought missing have been returned from various sources. An appeal to broadcasters in other countries who had shown the programme (notably <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">African</a> nations such as <a href="/wiki/Nigeria" id="w">Nigeria</a>) produced &#34;missing&#34; episodes from the archives of those television companies.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tomb_of_the_Cybermen" id="w">The Tomb of the Cybermen</a></i>, for example, was recovered in this manner from a television company in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a> in 1992.<sup id="_ref-tomb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tomb" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some portions of these overseas copies were physically excised prior to transmission in the 1960s by the Australian and <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a> censors for being too violent or frightening for the programme&#39;s early time slot and younger audience. This posed a problem because episodes recovered from these sources were missing these segments. However, in October 1996 Australian <i>Doctor Who</i> fans Damian Shanahan and Ellen Parry discovered a collection of the censored clips &#8212; several from missing episodes which do not exist in their entirety &#8212; in the archives of the Australian government censor.<sup id="_ref-revisited_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-revisited" title="">[12]</a></sup> The clips had been sent by the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" id="w">ABC</a> to the archives as evidence of the required edits having been made. Similarly, in 2002 New Zealand fan Graham Howard uncovered censored clips from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wheel_in_Space" id="w">The Wheel in Space</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Web_of_Fear" id="w">The Web of Fear</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-revisited_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-revisited" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Episodes have also been returned by private film collectors who had acquired 16 mm copies from various sources. For example, 16 mm film telerecording prints of episode two of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Evil_of_the_Daleks" id="w">The Evil of the Daleks</a></i> and episode three of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Faceless_Ones" id="w">The Faceless Ones</a></i> were returned to the BBC by film collector Gordon Hendry. These episodes (the only one from <i>Evil</i> and one of only two from <i>The Faceless Ones</i> to exist) had been purchased by Hendry for Â£8 each at a <a href="/wiki/Car_boot_sale" id="w">car boot sale</a> in December 1983. At the time of purchase he had been completely unaware of their rarity, and bought them out of mild curiosity and childhood memories of the programme.<sup id="_ref-years_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-years" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The unlikeliest story from which episodes have been recovered is <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daleks%26%2339%3B_Master_Plan" id="w">The Daleks&#39; Master Plan</a></i>, a serial which was never sold abroad.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup> Only Australia ever requested viewing copies (except for episode seven: <a href="/wiki/The_Daleks%26%2339%3B_Master_Plan#The Christmas episode" id="w">&#34;The Feast of Steven&#34;</a>), eventually electing not to purchase the serial.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup> What happened to these viewing copies is a mystery, as no records of their eventual disposition &#8212; whether they were retained in the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" id="w">ABC</a> archives or returned to the BBC &#8212; have been found.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, 16 mm copies of three episodes from <i>The Daleks&#39; Master Plan</i> have been recovered. Two came from an ex-BBC property which had been purchased by a <a href="/wiki/Mormon" id="w">Mormon</a> church group in the early 1980s who had come across the films when tidying the basement and subsequently offered them back to the Corporation.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup> The third was returned in 2004 by former BBC engineer Francis Watson. Watson had taken the film home in the early 1970s after being instructed to dispose of junk material from a projector testing room at the BBC&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ealing_Studios" id="w">Ealing Studios</a>. Instead of throwing the film away, Watson kept it, eventually returning it when he realised the value of the material.<sup id="_ref-watson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-watson" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after the junking process came to an end and the BBC was first taking stock of how much material was missing from its archives, enquiries were made to the <a href="/wiki/National_Film_and_Television_Archive" id="w">National Film and Television Archive</a>, held by the <a href="/wiki/British_Film_Institute" id="w">British Film Institute</a>, as to whether they held any copies of BBC programmes which the BBC did not. These enquiries resulted in the return of three complete Second Doctor serials: <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dominators" id="w">The Dominators</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Krotons" id="w">The Krotons</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_War_Games" id="w">The War Games</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-withdrawn_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-withdrawn" title="">[9]</a></sup> These were all standard 16 mm film telerecordings except for Episode 3 of <i>The Dominators</i>, which was a 35 mm print. Episodes four and five of that serial originated from a foreign broadcaster and had been slightly edited. However the missing material has subsequently been restored, either from a copy held by a private collector or through the discovery of the censor clips.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some of the surviving episodes were always held at the BBC, although the Corporation was not necessarily aware of this. In August 1988, episodes one, four, five and six of the six-part story <i><a href="/wiki/The_Ice_Warriors" id="w">The Ice Warriors</a></i> were discovered in a cupboard at Villiers House when the organisation was in the process of moving out of the building.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup> Also, when the archive was first checked in 1978, forty-seven episodes were held by the BBC Film Library, in addition to those still held by BBC Enterprises. These Film Library copies were a combination of random viewing prints created for various episodes down the years which had subsequently found their way into the library&#39;s holdings, and some of the few episodes that had originally been telerecorded onto film for transmission rather than recorded onto videotape. These film-recorded masters had been stored in the Film Library rather than in the Engineering Department with the videotapes.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, despite the Film Library&#39;s remit, not all of these originally film-recorded episodes exist. On the other hand, there were also some unexplained items in the library, such as 16 mm copies of the first three episodes of <i>The Tenth Planet</i>, presumably viewing prints which were mistakenly returned to them at some point instead of BBC Enterprises.<sup id="_ref-withdrawn_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-withdrawn" title="">[9]</a></sup> Most surprisingly of all, they also still held a 16 mm telerecording copy of the original untransmitted pilot episode of the programme, presumably a viewing print made in 1963 and subsequently lodged at the library.<sup id="_ref-interest_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interest" title="">[8]</a></sup> The Film Library also held high-quality original film sequences made for insertion into videotaped episodes. Some of these, such as those from the opening two episodes of <i>The Daleks&#39; Master Plan</i>, survive to this day, but there is evidence to suggest that some film inserts were considered to be of lesser value than complete programmes and were junked as late as the early 1980s.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

Small excerpts have also been recovered on 8 mm <a href="/wiki/Cine_film" id="w">cine film</a> taken by a fan in Australia, who filmed certain scenes directly from the television screen during repeat showings of various episodes.<sup id="_ref-cine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cine" title="">[21]</a></sup> Clips from some missing episodes also survive where they were used in other programmes, with these other shows surviving. For example, scenes from the missing episode four of <i>The Daleks&#39; Master Plan</i> exist in a 1973 edition of <i>Blue Peter</i>, and an Australian programme called <i>Perspectives: C for Computer</i> yielded otherwise-missing extracts from the first Second Doctor story <i><a href="/wiki/The_Power_of_the_Daleks" id="w">The Power of the Daleks</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-dwm257_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm257" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>A lengthy excerpt from the 1965 serial <i><a href="/wiki/Galaxy_4" id="w">Galaxy 4</a></i> was returned by <i>Doctor Who</i> fan Jan Vincent-Rudzki in the 1990s. The sequence had originally been taken from a viewing print of the first episode of that serial by the production team working on a 1977 <i>Doctor Who</i> documentary, <i>Whose Doctor Who</i>. After they had selected the short clip they wished to use from the extract they discarded the rest, and Vincent-Rudzki, who was working as an adviser to the production team, was allowed to keep the film.<sup id="_ref-years2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-years2" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2005 two further short clips from <i>The Power of the Daleks</i> &#8212; along with a higher-quality version of one of the extant scenes &#8212; were discovered in an episode of the BBC science series <i><a href="/wiki/Tomorrow%26%2339%3Bs_World" id="w">Tomorrow&#39;s World</a></i> from 1966. The clips, lasting less than 10 seconds each and on film (as opposed to film recordings), only came to light when the <i>Tomorrow&#39;s World</i> segment was broadcast as part of the <a href="/wiki/11_September" id="w">11 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> edition of the clip-based nostalgia show <i>Sunday Past Times</i> on <a href="/wiki/BBC_Two" id="w">BBC Two</a>. Several sharp-eyed fans noticed that these clips were not among those already known to be extant in the archives and informed the BBC.<sup id="_ref-past-times_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-past-times" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though numerous episodes are still missing, full-length audio soundtracks for all missing episodes are held by the BBC.<sup id="_ref-miseps_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-miseps" title="">[13]</a></sup> These come from off-air recordings made by fans, often made by use of a microphone placed close to the television set.<sup id="_ref-offair_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-offair" title="">[24]</a></sup> While the quality of these off-air recordings varies greatly, multiple fan recordings exist for every episode; this has allowed groups such as the <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_Restoration_Team" id="w">Doctor Who Restoration Team</a> to compile &#34;remastered&#34; soundtracks for CD releases of the missing episodes. BBC Audio has also released a number of these recordings since the early 1990s, with added narration to describe visual sequeneces.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/20_April" id="w">20 April</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> it was announced on <i>Blue Peter</i> that a life-sized <a href="/wiki/Dalek" id="w">Dalek</a> would be given away to anyone that could find and return one of the missing episodes.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Restoration" name="Restoration"></a><h1>Restoration</h1>
<p>While the original 625-line PAL videotapes of some serials starring Jon Pertwee were wiped for reuse and a few episodes are only held as 16 mm black and white telerecordings, some colour versions survived in the form of 525-line NTSC colour videotapes that were sent for broadcasting overseas. In the early 1980s, some of these tapes were returned to the UK from the BBC&#39;s office in <a href="/wiki/Toronto" id="w">Toronto</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, including all seven episodes of <i><a href="/wiki/Inferno_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Inferno</a></i> (1970) just after it was aired in colour by <a href="/wiki/CKVU" id="w">CKVU</a> in <a href="/wiki/Vancouver" id="w">Vancouver</a>; other colour material had been aired in the late 1970s by Toronto-based <a href="/wiki/TV_Ontario" id="w">TV Ontario</a>.<sup id="_ref-dwm256_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dwm256" title="">[11]</a></sup> As well as this, some off-air colour videotape copies recorded by an American fan in the late 1970s were recovered in the early 1990s, and their colour signals were used (along with traditional <a href="/wiki/Film_colorization" id="w">colourisation</a> techniques where necessary) to colourise the higher-quality 16 mm monochrome film copies.<sup id="_ref-colour_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colour" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>The serials that were restored in this way, and thus no longer incomplete, were <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_and_the_Silurians" id="w">Doctor Who and the Silurians</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Terror_of_the_Autons" id="w">Terror of the Autons</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_D%C3%A6mons" id="w">The DÃ¦mons</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-colour_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colour" title="">[28]</a></sup> Off-air NTSC colour tapes are held for all the episodes of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Ambassadors_of_Death" id="w">The Ambassadors of Death</a></i>, but are too badly damaged to permit anything more than a partial restoration, with the cost of repair being prohibitive.<sup id="_ref-ambassadors_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ambassadors" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>A new &#34;Reverse Standards Conversion&#34; process was used for the first time on the 2005 DVD release of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Claws_of_Axos" id="w">The Claws of Axos</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-claws_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-claws" title="">[30]</a></sup> This process can be used on NTSC version master tapes to restore them to something closer to their original PAL colour state.<sup id="_ref-claws_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-claws" title="">[30]</a></sup> Another digital image processing technique used for the DVD releases is <a href="/wiki/VidFIRE" id="w">VidFIRE</a>, which restores the fluid video look to telerecorded episodes only held on film.<sup id="_ref-clapperton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clapperton" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

In addition to recovered short video clips and audio soundtracks, there also exist still photographs taken off-screen by photographer <a href="/wiki/John_Cura" id="w">John Cura</a>. Cura was hired by the BBC, and independently by many actors and production staff, to document the transmission of many of their most popular programmes from the 1940s to the 1960s, including <i>Doctor Who</i>.<sup id="_ref-miseps_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-miseps" title="">[13]</a></sup> These &#34;<a href="/wiki/Tele-snaps" id="w">tele-snaps</a>&#34; were generally used to promote BBC programmes and for actors, directors and other production crew members to keep a visual record of their own work in the days before home video recorders. In many cases, they form the only visual record remaining of several <i>Doctor Who</i> serials and other missing episodes of many programmes.<sup id="_ref-cura_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cura" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since the late 1990s, reconstructions of the missing serials have been made by fan groups such as Loose Cannon Productions, who distribute them for free.<sup id="_ref-carbon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carbon" title="">[33]</a></sup> These &#34;recons&#34; are based on the directors&#39; original camera scripts, and use a combination of the surviving soundtracks, surviving footage, photographs, still images (especially Cura&#39;s tele-snaps) and specially recreated material.<sup id="_ref-carbon_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carbon" title="">[33]</a></sup> Although technically infringing <a href="/wiki/Copyright" id="w">copyright</a>, these recons have been tolerated by the BBC, provided they are not sold for profit and are only distributed in degradeable, non-<a href="/wiki/Digital" id="w">digital</a> formats such as <a href="/wiki/VHS" id="w">VHS</a>.<sup id="_ref-carbon_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carbon" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

<p>Starting in the early 1990s, the BBC began to release existing audio recordings of serials with all or a majority of episodes missing on audio cassette and compact disc, with linking narration provided by former series actors such as <a href="/wiki/Jon_Pertwee" id="w">Jon Pertwee</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Baker" id="w">Tom Baker</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colin_Baker" id="w">Colin Baker</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Purves" id="w">Peter Purves</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Frazer_Hines" id="w">Frazer Hines</a>.

Some serials (such as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Evil_of_the_Daleks" id="w">The Evil of the Daleks</a></i>) were re-released during this time with improved audio restoration, changed linking narration, and in some instances with scenes unavailable in the first release.  Music clearance problems did however result in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Evil_of_the_Daleks" id="w">The Evil of the Daleks</a></i> release not having some background songs which played on its original soundtrack.

<p>As of February 2006, the soundtracks for all of the missing episodes have been released<sup id="_ref-terror_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-terror" title="">[41]</a></sup> albeit with copyright-uncleared music replacements where necessary, slightly rejigged sequences for reasons of clarity and with overdubbed narration.</p>
