 the 1700s and early 1800s, the City of Philadelphia was considered the land between the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers and between Vine and South Streets. In 1854, the <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Consolidation%2C_1854" id="w">Act of Consolidation</a> incorporated the rest of Philadelphia County and created Philadelphia&#39;s modern border. This resulted in a large population increase, evident in the 1860 census.</p>
<p>Philadelphia experienced steady growth between 1860 and 1950, except for a brief lull in 1930, which was in part due to the Great Depression. Its population peaked at 2,071,605 in <a href="/wiki/1950" id="w">1950</a>. Between 1950 and 2000, the city lost 554,055 people, or 26.7% of its population. To put this into context, <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a> lost 20.0% of its population during the same timeframe, and <a href="/wiki/Baltimore" id="w">Baltimore</a> lost 31.4%, according to US Census data. This nationwide trend is often referred to as <a href="/wiki/White_flight" id="w">white flight</a> because upper and middle class families, enabled by nationwide improvements to infrastructure, left cities in favor of their surrounding suburbs.</p>
<p>Recent estimates predict that the city will experience <a href="/wiki/Population_growth" id="w">growth</a> slightly before or after 2010. These estimates, and the reasons behind them, are sources of great debate. Possible reasons for the turnaround include increases in immigration from foreign countries and migration from more expensive cities in the <a href="/wiki/Northeast_Corridor" id="w">Northeast Corridor</a>. Both wealthy transplants and <a href="/wiki/Asian_American" id="w">Asian American</a> investors from <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> escaping high housing costs have received media attention for setting their sights on Philadelphia.<a class="externallink" href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B1FFC3A580C778DDDA10894DD404482" rel="nofollow" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B1FFC3A580C778DDDA10894DD404482">http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B1FFC3A580C778DDDA10894DD404482</a> The ten-year tax abatement, a historically-undervalued housing market, improvements to the waterfront, and continuing redevelopment throughout the city are thought to be factors drawing people to the city.</p>
<a id="Ethnography" name="Ethnography"></a><h2>Ethnography</h2>
<p>The ethnic makeup of the city was 32.5% <a href="/wiki/African_American" id="w">African American</a>, 13.6% <a href="/wiki/Irish-American" id="w">Irish</a>, 9.2% <a href="/wiki/Italian-American" id="w">Italian</a>, 6.6% <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" id="w">Puerto Rican</a>, 6.4% <a href="/wiki/German-American" id="w">German</a>, 4.3% <a href="/wiki/Polish-American" id="w">Polish</a>, 2.9% <a href="/wiki/English-American" id="w">English</a>, 1.7% <a href="/wiki/Russian-American" id="w">Russian</a>, 1.6% <a href="/wiki/Subsaharan_Africa" id="w">Subsaharan African</a>, 1.2% <a href="/wiki/Chinese-American" id="w">Chinese</a>, and 1.2% <a href="/wiki/West_Indies" id="w">West Indian</a>.

<p>The number of foreign-born increased by 34,000 between 1990 and 2000. Of foreign-born Philadelphians, 38.5% were from Asia, 30.3% were from Europe, 23.4% were from <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" id="w">Latin America</a>, and 6.7% were from <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a>. </p>

<a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Christianity is the dominant religion in the city of Philadelphia.

<p>Since the early 1800s, there has been a large and significant <a href="/wiki/Jewish" id="w">Jewish</a> population. Today, the city has one of the largest in America, and unlike many other places, it is continuing to grow as Eastern European Jews immigrate to the city. Historically, many Jewish communities left the city for the suburbs between the 1950s and 2000. A number of former <a href="/wiki/Synagogue" id="w">synagogues</a> in the city have been converted to <a href="/wiki/Mosque" id="w">mosques</a> and <a href="/wiki/Baptist" id="w">Baptist</a> churches, reflecting this change.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.sacredplaces.org/PSP-InfoClearingHouse/articles/Reuse%20for%20Other%20Religious%20Uses.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.sacredplaces.org/PSP-InfoClearingHouse/articles/Reuse%20for%20Other%20Religious%20Uses.htm">http://www.sacredplaces.org/PSP-InfoClearingHouse/articles/Reuse%20for%20Other%20Religious%20Uses.htm</a> </p>
