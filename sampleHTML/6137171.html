Most sociologists, such as Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson, James Henslin and Joseph Hickey, divide the middle class into two groups. The middle class thereby consists of an upper middle class, made up of professionals distinguished by exceptionally high educational attainment as well as high economic security; and a lower middle class, consisting of semi-professionals. While the groups overlap, differences between those at the center of both groups are considerable. The lower middle class has lower educational attainment, considerably less workplace autonomy and lower incomes than the upper middle class. With the emergence of a two-tier labor market, the economic benefits and life chances of upper middle class professionals have grown considerably compared to those of the lower middle class.<sup id="_ref-The American Class Structure_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The American Class Structure" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Society in Focus_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society in Focus" title="">[2]</a></sup> The lower middle class also commonly needs two income earners in order to sustain a comfortable standard of living, while many upper middle class households maintain a similar standard of living with just one income earner.<sup id="_ref-Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Washington Post on the Middle class squeeze_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Washington Post on the Middle class squeeze" title="">[10]</a></sup> Both groups, depending on definition, are believed to be growing.

<a id="The_professional/managerial_middle_class" name="The_professional/managerial_middle_class"></a><h3>The professional/managerial middle class</h3>
<p>The <b>professional class</b>, also called the <b>upper middle class</b>, consists mostly of white collar professionals, most of whom are highly educated, salaried professionals whose work is largely self-directed. Many have graduate degrees, with educational attainment serving as the main distinguishing feature of this class. Household incomes commonly exceed $100,000, with some smaller one-income-earner households having incomes in the high 5-figure range<sup id="_ref-Society in Focus_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society in Focus" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-The American Class Structure_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The American Class Structure" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Occupation and Class Consciousness in America_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Occupation and Class Consciousness in America" title="">[11]</a></sup>.

As a result, upper middle class employees enjoy great autonomy in the work place and are more satisfied with their careers than non-professional middle class individuals. The <a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">educational attainment</a> among the members of this class lends the professional middle class its immunity against economic downturns and above-average lifestyle, and also serves as the main entrance barrier into this class.<sup id="_ref-The Inner Life of the Middle Class_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Inner Life of the Middle Class" title="">[8]</a></sup> This class, partially due to its occupations, does have a great influence on American society and is often seen as social standard despite its relatively small size.<sup id="_ref-The Inner Life of the Middle Class_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Inner Life of the Middle Class" title="">[8]</a></sup> In terms of <a href="/wiki/Wealth_in_the_United_States" id="w">financial wealth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">income</a>, the professional middle class fits in the <a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">top third</a>, when excluding the <a href="/wiki/Income_quintiles" id="w">top 5%</a> of American society.<sup id="_ref-US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data" title="">[13]</a></sup> According to sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, Joseph Hickey and William Thompson, the upper middle class constitutes 15% of the population.<sup id="_ref-Society in Focus_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society in Focus" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Values and mannerisms are difficult to pinpoint for an intellectual concept encompassing millions of persons. Naturally, any large group of people will feature social diversity to some extent or another. Some generalizations, however, can be made using education and income as class defining criteria. William Thompson and Joseph Hickey noted that upper middle class individual possess a more direct and confident manner of speech.<sup id="_ref-Society in Focus_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society in Focus" title="">[2]</a></sup> In her 1989 publication <i>Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech</i>, Erica Hoff-Ginsberg found that among her surveyed subjects, &#34;Upper-middle class mothers talked more per unit of time and sustained longer interactions with children.&#34; She also found that the speech of upper middle class mothers differs &#34;in its functional, discourse, and lexico-syntactic properties,&#34; from those in the working class.<sup id="_ref-Education resource information center, Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Education resource information center, Effects of Social Class and Interactive Setting on Maternal Speech" title="">[14]</a></sup> Upper middle class manners tend to require individuals engaging in conversational discourse with rather distant associates, and to abstain from sharing excessive personal information. This contradicts umer working class speech patterns, which often include frequent mentions of one&#39;s personal life.<sup id="_ref-What's Class Got To Do With It, American Society in the Twenty-First Century_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-What's Class Got To Do With It, American Society in the Twenty-First Century" title="">[15]</a></sup> Further research also suggests that working class parents emphasize conformity, traditional gender roles, and the adherence to external standards in their children, such as being neat and clean and &#34;[believing] in strict leadership.&#34; (Gilbert, 1998) This contrasted with professional class households, where gender roles were more egalitarian and loosely defined. Upper middle class children were largely thought to adhere to internal standards, with curiosity, individuality, self-direction and openness to new ideas being emphasized.<sup id="_ref-American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality" title="">[16]</a></sup> While a recent gallup survey showed mass affluent households to be conservative on economic issues while liberal on social issues, the upper middle class seems to be relatively politically polarized. In the 2006 mid-term elections both Democrats and Republicans received over 40% of the vote from those with advanced degrees and those in households with six figure incomes. While households with incomes exceeding $100,000 tend to favor Republicans slightly, they are also the only income demographic where Ralph Nader won more than 1% of the vote. Among those with graduate degrees, a smaller group than those with six figure incomes, the majority tends to vote Democrat<sup id="_ref-CNN exit poll, 2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN exit poll, 2006" title="">[17]</a></sup> with roughly 1% having voted for Nader in 2004.<sup id="_ref-CNN exit poll, 2004_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN exit poll, 2004" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson and Joseph Hickey estimate the upper middle class to constitute roughly 15% of the population.

<a id="Lower_middle_class" name="Lower_middle_class"></a><h3>Lower middle class</h3>
<p>According to sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University, the middle class is divided into only two groups: the upper middle and lower middle class.<sup id="_ref-Class, A Guide through the American status system_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Class, A Guide through the American status system" title="">[25]</a></sup> As mentioned above, the upper middle class, according to Gilbert as well as Thompson &#38; Hickey, constitutes roughly 15% of the population. The lower middle class is the second most populous according to both models, constituting roughly one third of the population, the same percentage as the working class. However, according to James M. Henslin, who also divides the middle class into two sub-groups, the lower middle class is the most populous, constituting 34% of the population.<sup id="_ref-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships" title="">[5]</a></sup> In all three class models the lower middle class is said to consist of &#34;semi-professionals&#34; and lower level white collar employees. An adaptation by sociologists Brian K. William, Stacy C. Sawyer and Carl M. Wahlstrom of Dennis Gilbert&#39;s class model gave the following description of the lower middle class:<sup id="_ref-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>{{quote}}</p>
<p>Taking into account the percentages provided in the six class model by Gilbert, as well as the model of Thompson and Hickey, one can apply US Census Bureau statistics regarding <a href="/wiki/Income_in_the_United_States" id="w">income</a>. According to these class models the lower middle class is located roughly between the 52<sup>nd</sup> and 84<sup>th</sup> percentile of society. In terms of personal income distribution in 2005, that would mean <a href="/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">gross annual personal incomes</a> from about $32,500 to $60,000.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, distribution of personal income, 2006_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, distribution of personal income, 2006" title="">[20]</a></sup> As 42% of all households, and the majority of those in the top 40%, had two <a href="/wiki/Income_earner" id="w">income earners</a>, <a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">household income figures</a> would be significantly higher, ranging from roughly $50,000 to $100,000 annually.<sup id="_ref-US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data" title="">[13]</a></sup> In terms of <a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">educational attainment</a>, 27% of persons had a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor%26%2339%3Bs_degree_or_higher" id="w">Bachelor&#39;s degree or higher</a>. If the upper middle and upper class combined are to constitute 16% of the population, it becomes clear that some of those in the lower middle class boast college degrees or some college education.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Working_class_majority" name="Working_class_majority"></a><h3>Working class majority</h3>
<p>According to some, the majority of Americans may also be correctly referred to as being members of the working class.<sup id="_ref-The American Perception of Class_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The American Perception of Class" title="">[27]</a></sup>
This use of the term &#34;working class&#34; is largely applicable if the nature of work becomes the main determinant of social class. After all, social class is the distribution of individuals among positions within society whose influence and importance differ. Thus the nature of a person&#39;s work and the associated degrees of influence, responsibility, and complexity determine, to a large degree, a person&#39;s social class. The more influence and responsibility a person has and the more complex his or her work, the higher his or her status in society.<sup id="_ref-Social Class and Stratification_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Social Class and Stratification" title="">[28]</a></sup> As qualified personnel for relatively important, responsible, and complex occupations are scarce, <a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">income</a> increases as well, following the economic principle of scarcity resulting in value. According to this approach, occupation becomes more essential in determining class than income.<sup id="_ref-Social Class and Stratification_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Social Class and Stratification" title="">[28]</a></sup> Whereas professionals tend to create, conceptualize, consult and instruct, most Americans do not enjoy a high degree of independence in their work, as they merely follow set instructions.<sup id="_ref-The Inner Life of the Middle Class_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Inner Life of the Middle Class" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-The American Perception of Class_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The American Perception of Class" title="">[27]</a></sup>
Many of these working class workers are most commonly, due to their income, called middle-middle or statistical middle class. Class models such as the ones brought forth by Dennis Gilbert or Thompson and Hickey estimate that roughly 53% of Americans are members of the working or lower classes.<sup id="_ref-Society in Focus_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society in Focus" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is the nature of their work and lack of influence that leads some to come to the conclusion that most Americans are working class. The majority of workers are not paid to share their thoughts and ideas as much as professionals. They are commonly closely supervised and do not enjoy a great deal of independence in their jobs. They are also not commonly paid to think, and their thoughts are not often sought by their employer organizations or clients, which leads to a lack of influence. A dentist&#39;s office offers itself as an example.<sup id="_ref-The Inner Life of the Middle Class_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Inner Life of the Middle Class" title="">[8]</a></sup> In May 2004, dentists had a median income of $129,920, indicating a high degree of scarcity for qualified personnel. The opinions and thoughts of dentists, much like those of other professionals, are sought after by their organizations and clients. The <a href="/wiki/Dentist" id="w">dentist</a> creates a diagnosis, consults the patient, and conceptualizes a treatment.<sup id="_ref-Income and nature of work of dentists_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Income and nature of work of dentists" title="">[29]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Dental_hygienist" id="w">Dental hygienists</a> made roughly $28 an hour, about $56,000 annually, or $36,000 in the common case of sub-forty hour work weeks.

<a id="Vernacular_middle_class" name="Vernacular_middle_class"></a><h3>Vernacular middle class</h3>
<p>The term middle class in more colloquial language use may refer to all those individuals who might at one point or another be identified as middle class, as they occupy neither extreme of the socio-economic strata. Most of those with households income between $40,000 and $95,000 identify as &#34;middle class.&#34; The term can also be used to describe those at the actual center of the income strata, who may also be referred to as the middle-middle class. There are many different theories on the middle-middle class. The middle-middle class may be composed of those households with annual incomes of 80% to 120% of the national median household income. Persons in this income range could, in accordance to solely economic reasoning, be referred to as the American average. Such households would boast annual incomes ranging from $35,200 to $52,800, and thus be located in the middle of the income range.<sup id="_ref-US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data" title="">[13]</a></sup> Some of these households, while actually being in the middle and thus sometimes referred to as being middle class, cannot, however, afford the middle class lifestyle.<sup id="_ref-Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle" title="">[9]</a></sup> Yet another definition states that the statistical middle class includes all those households with income ranging from $25,000 to $100,000.<sup id="_ref-Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy" title="">[1]</a></sup> This is, however, a very vague definition, as it includes persons from all but the lowest quintile. Using this definition creates a class so economically fragmented that it would lump together those who are struggling to make ends meet with two incomes and those who are able to live the iconic middle class lifestyle with just one income and are <a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">highly educated</a>.</p>
<a id="Weberian_definition" name="Weberian_definition"></a><h3>Weberian definition</h3>
<p>Some modern theories of <a href="/wiki/Political_economy" id="w">political economy</a> consider a large middle class to be a beneficial, stabilizing influence on <a href="/wiki/Society" id="w">society</a>, because it has neither the possibly explosive <a href="/wiki/Revolution" id="w">revolutionary</a> tendencies of the <a href="/wiki/Lower_class" id="w">lower class</a>, nor the <a href="/wiki/Political_absolutism" id="w">absolutist</a> tendencies of an entrenched <a href="/wiki/Upper_class" id="w">upper class</a>.  Most <a href="/wiki/Sociology" id="w">sociological</a> definitions of middle class follow <a href="/wiki/Max_Weber" id="w">Max Weber</a>.  Here the middle class is defined as consisting of <a href="/wiki/Professional" id="w">professionals</a> or <a href="/wiki/Business" id="w">business</a> owners who share a <a href="/wiki/Culture" id="w">culture</a> of domesticity and sub-urbanity and a level of relative security against social crisis, in the form of socially desired skill or wealth. Thus the theory on the middle class by Max Weber can be cited as one that supports the notion of the middle class being composed of a quasi-elite of professionals and managers, who are largely immune to economic downturns and trends such as out-sourcing which affect the statistical middle class.<sup id="_ref-Washington Post on the Middle class squeeze_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Washington Post on the Middle class squeeze" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

Sociologist Leonard Beeghley identifies a male making $57,000 and a female making $40,000 with a combined households income of $97,000 as a typical middle class family.<sup id="_ref-The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States" title="">[31]</a></sup> Sociologists William Thompson and Joseph Hickey estimate an income range of roughly $35,000 to $75,000 for the lower middle class and $100,000 or more for the upper middle class. Many social scientists including economist Micheal Zweig and sociologist Dennis Gilbert contend that middle class persons usually have above median incomes.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">Educational attainment</a> is one of the most prominent determinants of class status. As <a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">educational attainment</a> represents expertise, which is a necessary component of the capitalistic market system, its ownership may be seen as the ownership of one of the factors of production.<sup id="_ref-Occupation and Class Consciousness in America_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Occupation and Class Consciousness in America" title="">[11]</a></sup> In other words, those with <a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">advanced degrees</a> already own one of the essential buttresses of the economy: expertise. Additionally <a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">educational attainment</a> is basis for occupational selection. Those with higher educational attainment tend to be positioned in occupations with greater autonomy, influence over the organizational process, and better <a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">financial compensation</a>. While <a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">economic compensation</a> is merely the result of scarcity, educational attainment may be related to that very economic principle as well. The attainment of a <a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">graduate degree</a> represents the acquisition of expertise, a factor of production, that in itself may be scarce; thus leading to better financial compensation for the owner.<sup id="_ref-Occupation and Class Consciousness in America_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Occupation and Class Consciousness in America" title="">[11]</a></sup> As stated above, the upper middle class features a strong reliance on <a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">educational attainment</a> (the ownership of expertise) for much of its social and economic well-being.<sup id="_ref-Household income according to the educational attainment of householder_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Household income according to the educational attainment of householder" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-The Inner Life of the Middle Class_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Inner Life of the Middle Class" title="">[8]</a></sup> The following chart further explains the strong correlation between educational attainment and personal as well as household income.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, personal income by education_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, personal income by education" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">Income</a> is one of a household&#39;s attributes most commonly used to determine its class status. Yet, <a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">income</a> may not always accurately reflect a household&#39;s position within society or the economy.<sup id="_ref-Social Class and Stratification_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Social Class and Stratification" title="">[28]</a></sup> Unlike personal income, household income does not reflect occupational achievement as much as it measures the number of income earners. Sociologist Dennis Gilbert acknowledges that a working class household with two income earners may out-earn a single-income upper middle class household, as the number of income earners has evolved into one of the most important variables in determining household income. For example, according to the US Department of Labor, two registered nurses could quite easily command a household income of $126,000 annually,<sup id="_ref-US Department of Labor, Median income of registered nurses_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Department of Labor, Median income of registered nurses" title="">[32]</a></sup> while the median income for a lawyer was $94,930.<sup id="_ref-US Department of Labor, Median income of lawyers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Department of Labor, Median income of lawyers" title="">[33]</a></sup> Furthermore, household income fails to recognize household size. For example, a single attorney, earning $95,000, may have a higher standard of living than a family of four with an income of $120,000. Yet household income is still a commonly used class indicator, as household members share the same economic fate and class position.<sup id="_ref-American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Influence" name="Influence"></a><h2>Influence</h2>
<p>The influence of the middle class depends on which theory one utilizes. If the middle class is defined as a modern <a href="/wiki/Bourgeoisie" id="w">bourgeoisie</a>, the &#34;middle class&#34; has great influence. If middle class is used in a manner that includes all persons who are at neither extreme of the <a href="/wiki/Social_structure" id="w">social strata</a>, it might still be influential, as such definition may include the &#34;professional middle class,&#34; which is then commonly referred to as the &#34;upper middle class.&#34; Despite the fact that the professional (upper) middle class is a privileged minority, it is the perhaps the most influential class in the United States.<sup id="_ref-The Inner Life of the Middle Class_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Inner Life of the Middle Class" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>{{quote}}</p>
<p>Several reasons can be cited as to why the <a href="/wiki/Professional_class" id="w">professional middle class</a> is so influential. One is that <a href="/wiki/Journalists" id="w">journalists</a>, commentators, <a href="/wiki/Writer" id="w">writers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Professor" id="w">professors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Economist" id="w">economists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Political_Scientist" id="w">political scientists</a>, who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle class persons in <a href="/wiki/Post_secondary_education" id="w">post secondary education</a>, another essential instrument in regards to shaping <a href="/wiki/Public_opinion" id="w">public opinion</a>, it should come as no surprise that the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker.<sup id="_ref-The Inner Life of the Middle Class_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Inner Life of the Middle Class" title="">[8]</a></sup> Yet another reason is the economic clout generated by this class. In 2005, according to <a href="/wiki/US_Census" id="w">US Census</a> statistics, the <a href="/wiki/Income_quintiles" id="w">top third</a> of society, excluding the <a href="/wiki/Income_quintiles" id="w">top 5%</a>, controlled the largest share of <a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States#Aggregate income distribution" id="w">income</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>.<sup id="_ref-US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census 2005 Economic Survey, income data" title="">[13]</a></sup>  Although some in the statistical middle class (for example, police officers and fire fighters in the more affluent suburbs in the San Francisco Bay Area) may have lifestyles as comfortable as those found among the ranks of the professional middle class, only few have the same degree of autonomy and influence over society as those in the professional middle class.<sup id="_ref-The Inner Life of the Middle Class_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Inner Life of the Middle Class" title="">[8]</a></sup>  Other white collar members of the statistical middle class may not only be unable to afford the middle class lifestyle<sup id="_ref-Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle" title="">[9]</a></sup> but also lack the influence found in the professional middle class.<sup id="_ref-Class, A Guide through the American status system_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Class, A Guide through the American status system" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<p>As mentioned above, typical occupations for members of the middle class are those identified as being part of &#34;the professions&#34; and often include managerial duties as well, with all being <a href="/wiki/White_collar" id="w">white collar</a>. There is great diversity among the occupations found among those living the middle class lifestyle, and the appropriateness of some occupations being placed here will depend on each individual’s personal outlook.

Even though some working class employees might also enjoy largely self-directed work, large degrees of autonomy in the work place, as well as influence over the organizational process, which are commonly the results of obtained expertise, these can still be seen as hallmarks of upper middle class or professional middle class professions.<sup id="_ref-Occupation and Class Consciousness in America_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Occupation and Class Consciousness in America" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>As for the lower middle class, other less prestigious occupations (such as <a href="/wiki/Realtor" id="w">real estate agent</a>), many less-paid sales positions, entry-level management, higher paying <a href="/wiki/Blue_collar" id="w">blue collar</a> positions, etc., would be included.<sup id="_ref-New York Times, guidelines for determining class in America_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-New York Times, guidelines for determining class in America" title="">[35]</a></sup> In addition to professionals whose work is largely self-directed and includes managerial duties, many other less privileged members of the statistical middle class would find themselves in <a href="/wiki/White_collar" id="w">white collar</a> positions without much influence and with somewhat strict supervision.

The American middle class, at least those living the lifestyle, has become known around the world for <a href="/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption" id="w">conspicuous consumption</a>. To this day, the professional middle class in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> holds the world record for having the largest homes, most appliances and most <a href="/wiki/Passenger_vehicles_in_the_United_States" id="w">automobiles</a>. In 2005, the average <a href="/wiki/McMansion" id="w">new home</a> had a square footage of 2,434 square feet (roughly 226 square meters) with 58% of these homes having ceilings with heights in excess of nine feet on the first floor. As new homes only represent a small portion of the housing stock in the US, with most <a href="/wiki/Suburb" id="w">suburban</a> homes having been built in the 1970s when the <a href="/wiki/Real_estate_pricing" id="w">average square footage</a> was 1,600,<sup id="_ref-Realty Times, the increasing size of American homes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Realty Times, the increasing size of American homes" title="">[36]</a></sup> it is fair to assume that these large new suburban homes will be inhabited by members of the professional middle class. Overall, many social critics and <a href="/wiki/Intellectuals" id="w">intellectuals</a>, most of whom are members of the professional middle class themselves, have commented on the extravagant consumption habits of the professional middle class. It is also often pointed out that the suburban lifestyle of the American professional middle class is a major reason for its record consumption. Many members of this class have feared that this consumption will lead to a gradual erosion of moral and ethical values. The increasing materialism, even among such a <a href="/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" id="w">highly-educated</a> class, is also often claimed to be connected to the notion of rugged individualism which gained popularity among the ranks of the professional middle class in the 1970s and 80s.<sup id="_ref-The Inner Life of the Middle Class_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Inner Life of the Middle Class" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Professional Occupations according to the US Department of Labor_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Professional Occupations according to the US Department of Labor" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

This topic is controversial because the economic boundaries that define the middle class vary.  <a href="/wiki/Household" id="w">Households</a> that earn between $25,000 and $75,000 represent approximately the middle half of the <a href="/wiki/Income" id="w">income</a> distribution tables provided by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau" id="w">U.S. Census Bureau</a>.  Over the past two decades, the number of households in those brackets decreased from 48.2% to 44.3% while at the same time the number of households overall increased almost 30%.  During the same time period, the number of households with incomes below $25,000 decreased slightly from 28.7% to 25.2% while the number of households with incomes above $75,000 increased over 7%, from 23.2% to 30.4%.<sup id="_ref-Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006" title="">[39]</a></sup>  A possible explanation for the increase in the higher earnings categories is the fact that many households contain two wage earners.<sup id="_ref-Is America Becoming More of a Class Society?_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Is America Becoming More of a Class Society?" title="">[40]</a></sup>  However, a closer analysis reveals all of the 7% increase can be found in households who earn over $100,000 and in particular the people that constitute the <a href="/wiki/Elite" id="w">elite</a> class.<sup id="_ref-Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006" title="">[39]</a></sup>  This is not surprising given the fact that average <a href="/wiki/Executive_compensation" id="w">compensation</a> for <a href="/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" id="w">CEOs</a> increased by 79% from 1989-2000.  Also, over the past 10 years, American’s with over $5 million has multiplied by four.<sup id="_ref-The State of Working America 2004/2005_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The State of Working America 2004/2005" title="">[41]</a></sup>  In addition, the <a href="/wiki/Net_worth" id="w">net worth</a> of the individuals of the 2007 <a href="/wiki/Forbes" id="w">Forbes</a> 400 list increased by $290 billion and the amount needed to even make the list increased by $300 million from the previous year.<sup id="_ref-The Forbes 400_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Forbes 400" title="">[42]</a></sup>  More people appear to be shifting upwards from the middle class which is good.  But as the rich continue to get richer, the poor keep getting poorer.  Several mass layoffs have contributed to this including 16,000 different layoffs involving about 1.6 million employees in 2004 with the majority being in the <a href="/wiki/Manufacturing" id="w">manufacturing</a> industry.<sup id="_ref-The State of Working America 2004/2005_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The State of Working America 2004/2005" title="">[41]</a></sup>  This continues to be a long term trend as the <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States" id="w">United States’ economy</a> becomes more and more service-oriented.  Industries are also moving out of the <a href="/wiki/Inner_city" id="w">inner cities</a> which are predominantly <a href="/wiki/Working_class" id="w">lower class</a>.  As these jobs leave, Americans are left with lower paying jobs.  The burst of the <a href="/wiki/Dot-com_bubble" id="w">high-tech bubble</a> in 2000 as well as an increase in the use of less-expensive foreign labor have also contributed to a decline in the middle class.  The <a href="/wiki/Gini_coefficient" id="w">Gini ratio</a> for 2006 is 0.470 and has steadily increased over the past 5 years which further illustrates the growing gap in <a href="/wiki/Economic_inequality" id="w">income inequality</a>.<sup id="_ref-Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006" title="">[39]</a></sup>  A study by <a href="/wiki/Brookings_Institution" id="w">Brookings Institution</a> in June 2006 revealed that middle-income neighborhoods have dropped 17% from 1970 to 2000.  As housing costs increase, the middle class is squeezed and forced to live in less desirable areas making upward mobility more difficult.  Safety, school systems, and even jobs are all linked to neighborhood types.<sup id="_ref-Where Did They Go? the Decline of Middle-Income Neighborhoods in Metropolitan America_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Where Did They Go? the Decline of Middle-Income Neighborhoods in Metropolitan America" title="">[43]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Poverty" id="w">Poverty</a> rates also influence the middle class.  Rates increased early in the 1980s until late in the 1990s when they started to go back down.  Since 2000, the percent of all people living in poverty is up from 11.3% to 12.3% in 2006.<sup id="_ref-Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2006" title="">[39]</a></sup>  The rise in poverty as well as the large growth among the top income earners in the United States illustrates a reduction in the number of people considered middle class.</p>
