<p>Gilbert, who wrote the words, created fanciful topsy-turvy worlds for these operas, where each absurdity is taken to its logical conclusion—fairies rub elbows with British lords, flirting is a capital offence, gondoliers ascend to the monarchy, and pirates turn out to be noblemen who have gone wrong.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[2]</a></sup> Sullivan, seven years younger than Gilbert, composed the music, contributing memorable melodies<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> that could convey both humour and pathos.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

Gilbert was born in London on <a href="/wiki/November_18" id="w">November 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1836" id="w">1836</a>.  His father <a href="/wiki/William_Gilbert_(author)" id="w">William</a> was a naval surgeon who later wrote novels and short stories, some of which included illustrations by his son.<sup id="_ref-CrowtherLife_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CrowtherLife" title="">[8]</a></sup> In 1861, the younger Gilbert began to write illustrated stories, poems and articles of his own to supplement his income.  Many of these would later be mined as a source of ideas for his plays and operas, particularly his series of illustrated poems called the <a href="/wiki/Bab_Ballads" id="w">Bab Ballads</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>

In the Bab Ballads and his early plays, Gilbert developed a unique &#34;topsy-turvy&#34; style, where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd. <a href="/wiki/Mike_Leigh" id="w">Mike Leigh</a> describes the &#34;Gilbertian&#34; style as follows:

Sullivan was born in London on <a href="/wiki/May_13" id="w">May 13</a> <a href="/wiki/1842" id="w">1842</a>.  His father was a military bandmaster, and by the time Arthur had reached the age of 8, he was proficient with all the instruments in the band.  In school he began to compose <a href="/wiki/Anthem" id="w">anthems</a> and songs. In 1856, he received the first Mendelssohn Prize and studied at the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Music" id="w">Royal Academy of Music</a> and at <a href="/wiki/Leipzig" id="w">Leipzig</a>, where he also took up <a href="/wiki/Conducting" id="w">conducting</a>.  His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of <a href="/wiki/The_Tempest_(Sullivan)" id="w">incidental music</a> to <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" id="w">Shakespeare&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tempest" id="w">The Tempest</a></i>. Revised and expanded, it was performed at <a href="/wiki/The_Crystal_Palace" id="w">the Crystal Palace</a> in 1862 and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England&#39;s most promising young composer, composing a symphony, a concerto, and several overtures, among them the <i><a href="/wiki/Overture_di_Ballo" id="w">Overture di Ballo</a></i>, in 1870.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>

<p>His early major works for the voice included <i><a href="/wiki/The_Masque_at_Kenilworth" id="w">The Masque at Kenilworth</a></i> (1864); an <a href="/wiki/Oratorio" id="w">oratorio</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Prodigal_Son_(Sullivan)" id="w">The Prodigal Son</a></i> (1869); and a dramatic <a href="/wiki/Cantata" id="w">cantata</a>, <i>On Shore and Sea</i> (1871).

 1871, producer <a href="/wiki/John_Hollingshead" id="w">John Hollingshead</a> brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to produce a Christmas entertainment, <i><a href="/wiki/Thespis_(opera)" id="w">Thespis</a></i>, at his <a href="/wiki/Gaiety_Theatre%2C_London" id="w">Gaiety Theatre</a>, a large <a href="/wiki/West_End_theatre" id="w">West End</a> house.  The piece was an <a href="/wiki/Extravaganza" id="w">extravaganza</a> in which the classical Greek gods, grown elderly, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th-century actors and actresses, one of whom is the eponymous <a href="/wiki/Thespis" id="w">Thespis</a>, the Greek father of the drama.

<p><i>Thespis</i> opened on <a href="/wiki/Boxing_Day" id="w">Boxing Day</a> and ran for 63 performances. It outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season, but no one at the time anticipated that this was the beginning of a great collaboration. Unlike the later G&#38;S works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqué, like Gilbert&#39;s earlier <a href="/wiki/Travesty" id="w">travesties</a>, with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors.  Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned. The musical score to <i>Thespis</i> was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Pirates_of_Penzance" id="w">The Pirates of Penzance</a></i>, and the Act II ballet.</p>
<p>Over the next four years, Gilbert and Sullivan did not have occasion to work together again, but each man became more eminent in his field. Gilbert worked with Clay on <i><a href="/wiki/Happy_Arcadia" id="w">Happy Arcadia</a></i> (1872) and with <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Cellier" id="w">Alfred Cellier</a> on <i><a href="/wiki/Topsyturveydom" id="w">Topsyturveydom</a></i> (1874), as well as writing several other libretti, farces, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, dramas, adaptations from novels, and translations from the French. Sullivan completed his <i>Festival <a href="/wiki/Te_Deum" id="w">Te Deum</a></i> (1872); another oratorio, <i>The Light of the World</i> (1873); his only <a href="/wiki/Song_cycle" id="w">song cycle</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Window%3B_or%2C_The_Song_of_the_Wrens" id="w">The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens</a></i> (1871); <a href="/wiki/Incidental_music" id="w">incidental music</a> to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Merry_Wives_of_Windsor" id="w">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a></i> (1874); and more songs, parlour ballads, and <a href="/wiki/Hymn" id="w">hymns</a>, including &#34;<a href="/wiki/Onward%2C_Christian_Soldiers" id="w">Onward, Christian Soldiers</a>&#34; (1872).</p>
<dl><dt><i>Trial by Jury</i></dt></dl>
<p>In 1874, Gilbert wrote a short libretto on commission from producer–composer <a href="/wiki/Carl_Rosa" id="w">Carl Rosa</a>, whose wife would have played the leading role, but her death in childbirth cancelled the project and left the libretto an orphan. Not long afterwards, <a href="/wiki/Richard_D%26%2339%3BOyly_Carte" id="w">Richard D&#39;Oyly Carte</a> was managing the <a href="/wiki/Royalty_Theatre" id="w">Royalty Theatre</a>, and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Offenbach" id="w">Offenbach</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/La_P%C3%A9richole" id="w">La Périchole</a></i>. Gilbert already had available the libretto he had written for Rosa, and Carte suggested that Sullivan write the score. The composer was delighted with it, and <i><a href="/wiki/Trial_by_Jury" id="w">Trial by Jury</a></i> was composed in a matter of weeks.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>  </p>

 piece is one of Gilbert’s humorous spoofs of the law and the legal profession, based on his brief experience as a <a href="/wiki/Barrister" id="w">barrister</a>. It concerns a <a href="/wiki/Breach_of_promise" id="w">breach of promise</a> of marriage suit. The defendant argues that damages should be slight, since &#34;he is such a very bad lot,&#34; while the plaintiff argues that she loves the defendant fervently and seeks &#34;substantial damages.&#34; After much argument, the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself. With Sullivan&#39;s brother, <a href="/wiki/Fred_Sullivan" id="w">Fred</a>, as the Learned Judge, the opera was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of <i>La Périchole</i>. Provincial tours and productions at other theatres quickly followed.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fred Sullivan was the prototype for the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Patter_song" id="w">patter</a>&#34; (comic) <a href="/wiki/Baritone" id="w">baritone</a> roles in the later operas. <a href="/wiki/F._C._Burnand" id="w">F. C. Burnand</a> wrote that he &#34;was one of the most naturally <i>comic little men</i> I ever came across. He, too, was a first-rate practical musician.... As he was the most absurd person, so was he the very kindliest....&#34;<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>  Fred&#39;s creation would serve as a model for the rest of the collaborators&#39; works, and each of them has a crucial <i>comic little man</i> role, as Burnand had put it.  The &#34;patter&#34; baritone (or &#34;principal comedian&#34;, as these roles later were called) would often assume the leading role in Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s comic operas, and was usually allotted the speedy <a href="/wiki/Patter_song" id="w">patter songs</a>.</p>
<p>After the success of <i>Trial by Jury</i>, Gilbert and Sullivan were suddenly in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D&#39;Oyly Carte was one of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte also proposed a revival of <i>Thespis</i> for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but he was unable to obtain financing for the project.

<p>Carte&#39;s real ambition was to develop an English form of light opera that would displace the bawdy <a href="/wiki/Burlesque_(genre)" id="w">burlesques</a> and badly translated French <a href="/wiki/Operetta" id="w">operettas</a> then dominating the London stage.

 found a subject in one of his own short stories, &#34;The Elixir of Love,&#34; which concerned the complications arising when a love potion is distributed to all the residents of a small village. The leading character was a <a href="/wiki/Cockney" id="w">Cockney</a> businessman who happened to be a sorcerer, a purveyor of blessings (not much called for) and curses (very popular). Gilbert and Sullivan were tireless taskmasters, seeing to it that <i>The Sorcerer</i> opened as a fully polished production, in marked contrast to the under-rehearsed <i>Thespis</i>.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>  While <i>The Sorcerer</i> won critical acclaim, it did not duplicate the success of <i>Trial by Jury</i>.  Nevertheless, Carte and his syndicate were sufficiently encouraged to commission another full-length opera from the team.</p>
<dl><dt><i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i></dt></dl>
<p>Gilbert and Sullivan scored their first international hit with <i><a href="/wiki/H.M.S._Pinafore" id="w">H.M.S. Pinafore</a></i> (1878), satirising the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in <i>The Sorcerer</i>, love between members of different social classes).  As with many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically near the end of the story.</p>
<p>Gilbert oversaw the designs of sets and costumes, and he directed the performers on stage.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> He sought realism in acting, shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a standard of characterisation where the characters were never aware of their own absurdity.<sup id="_ref-Cox_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cox" title="">[24]</a></sup>  Gilbert insisted that his actors know their words perfectly and obey his stage directions, which was something new to many actors of the day.<sup id="_ref-Cox_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cox" title="">[24]</a></sup> Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation.  The result was a new crispness and polish in the English musical theatre.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i> ran in London for 571 performances, the second longest run of any musical theatre piece in history up to that time (after the <a href="/wiki/Operetta" id="w">operetta</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Les_cloches_de_Corneville" id="w">Les cloches de Corneville</a></i>).<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>  Hundreds of unauthorized, or &#34;pirated&#34;, productions of <i>Pinafore</i> appeared in America.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup>  During the run of <i>Pinafore</i>, Richard D&#39;Oyly Carte split up with his former investors. The disgruntled former partners, who had each invested in the production with no return, staged a public fracas, sending a group of thugs to seize the scenery during a performance. Stagehands successfully managed to ward off their backstage attackers.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>  This event cleared the way for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan to form the D&#39;Oyly Carte Opera Company, which then produced all of their succeeding operas.</p>
<p>The libretto of <i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i> relied on <a href="/wiki/Stock_character" id="w">stock character</a> types, many of which were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert&#39;s earlier association with the German Reeds): the heroic protagonist (<a href="/wiki/Tenor" id="w">tenor</a>) and his love-interest (<a href="/wiki/Soprano" id="w">soprano</a>); the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue (<a href="/wiki/Contralto" id="w">contralto</a>); the baffled lyric <a href="/wiki/Baritone" id="w">baritone</a>&#8212;the girl&#39;s father; and a classic villain (<a href="/wiki/Bass-baritone" id="w">bass-baritone</a>).  Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic <a href="/wiki/Patter_song" id="w">patter-singing character</a>.  With the success of <i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i>, the D&#39;Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types.  Before <i>The Sorcerer</i>, Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with <i>Thespis</i> and <i>Trial by Jury</i>. Building on the team he had assembled for <i>The Sorcerer</i>, Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.</p>
<p>The repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen&#39;s navy as Sir Joseph Porter in <i><a href="/wiki/H.M.S._Pinafore" id="w">H.M.S. Pinafore</a></i>, then join the army as Major-General Stanley in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Pirates_of_Penzance" id="w">The Pirates of Penzance</a></i>, and so on.  Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in <i>The Sorcerer</i> transformed into Little Buttercup in <i>Pinafore</i>, then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in <i>Pirates</i>. Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage.  These included <a href="/wiki/George_Grossmith" id="w">George Grossmith</a>, the principal comic; <a href="/wiki/Rutland_Barrington" id="w">Rutland Barrington</a>, the lyric baritone; <a href="/wiki/Richard_Temple_(opera_singer)" id="w">Richard Temple</a>, the bass-baritone; and <a href="/wiki/Jessie_Bond" id="w">Jessie Bond</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mezzo-soprano" id="w">mezzo-soprano</a> <a href="/wiki/Soubrette" id="w">soubrette</a>.</p>

<p>In 1880, Sullivan wrote the <a href="/wiki/Cantata" id="w">cantata</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Martyr_of_Antioch" id="w">The Martyr of Antioch</a></i>, presented at the <a href="/wiki/Leeds" id="w">Leeds</a> Triennial Music Festival, with a libretto modified by Gilbert from an 1822 epic poem by <a href="/wiki/Henry_Hart_Milman" id="w">Henry Hart Milman</a> concerning the martyrdom of <a href="/wiki/Margaret_the_Virgin" id="w">St. Margaret of Antioch</a> in the 3rd century.

<i><a href="/wiki/Patience_(operetta)" id="w">Patience</a></i> (1881) satirised the <a href="/wiki/Aesthetic_movement" id="w">aesthetic movement</a> in general and its colourful poets, in particular, combining aspects of <a href="/wiki/Algernon_Charles_Swinburne" id="w">Algernon Charles Swinburne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti" id="w">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Wilde" id="w">Oscar Wilde</a>, <a href="/wiki/James_McNeill_Whistler" id="w">James McNeill Whistler</a> and others in the rival poets Bunthorne and Grosvenor.  Grossmith, who created the role of Bunthorne, based his makeup, wig and costume on Swinburne and especially Whistler, as seen in the adjacent photo.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> The work also lampoons male vanity and chauvinism in the military.  The story concerns two rival &#34;aesthetic&#34; poets, who attract the attention of the young ladies of the village, who had been engaged to the members of a cavalry regiment.  But the two poets are each in love with Patience, the village milkmaid, who detests one of them and feels that it is her duty to avoid the other despite her love for him.  Richard D&#39;Oyly Carte was the booking manager for <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Wilde" id="w">Oscar Wilde</a>, a then lesser-known proponent of aestheticism, and dispatched Wilde on an American lecture tour in conjunction with the opera&#39;s U.S. run, so that American audiences might better understand what the satire was all about.  </p>
<p>During the run of <i>Patience</i>, Carte built the large, modern <a href="/wiki/Savoy_Theatre" id="w">Savoy Theatre</a>, which became the partnership&#39;s permanent home. It was the first theatre (indeed the world&#39;s first public building) to be lit entirely by electric lighting.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup>  <i>Patience</i> moved into the Savoy after six months at the Opera Comique and ran for a total of 578 performances, surpassing the run of <i><a href="/wiki/H.M.S._Pinafore" id="w">H.M.S.

<dl><dt><i>Iolanthe</i></dt></dl>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Iolanthe" id="w">Iolanthe</a></i> (1882) was the first of the operas to open at the Savoy. The fully electric Savoy made possible numerous special effects, such as sparkling magic wands for the female chorus of fairies. The opera poked fun at English law and the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords" id="w">House of Lords</a> and made much of the war between the sexes.  The critics felt that Sullivan&#39;s work in <i>Iolanthe</i> had taken a step forward.  <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" id="w">The Daily Telegraph</a></i> wrote, &#34;The composer has risen to his opportunity, and we are disposed to account <i>Iolanthe</i> his best effort in all the Gilbertian series.&#34;<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>  Similarly, the <i>Theatre</i> asserted that &#34;the music of <i>Iolanthe</i> is Dr Sullivan&#39;s <i>chef d&#39;oeuvre</i>. The quality throughout is more even, and maintained at a higher standard, than in any of his earlier works....&#34;<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Iolanthe</i> is one of a number of Gilbert&#39;s works, including <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wicked_World" id="w">The Wicked World</a></i> (1873), <i><a href="/wiki/Broken_Hearts" id="w">Broken Hearts</a></i> (1875), <i><a href="/wiki/Princess_Ida" id="w">Princess Ida</a></i> (1884) and <i><a href="/wiki/Fallen_Fairies" id="w">Fallen Fairies</a></i> (1909), where the introduction of men and &#34;mortal love&#34; into a tranquil world of women wreaks havoc with the status quo.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>  Gilbert had created several &#34;fairy comedies&#34; at the <a href="/wiki/Haymarket_Theatre" id="w">Haymarket Theatre</a> in the early 1870s.

 1882, Gilbert had a telephone installed in his home and at the prompt desk at the Savoy Theatre so that he could monitor performances and rehearsals from his home study.  Gilbert had referred to the new technology in <i>Pinafore</i> in 1878, only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service.  Sullivan had one installed as well, and on <a href="/wiki/May_13" id="w">May 13</a> <a href="/wiki/1883" id="w">1883</a>, at a party to celebrate the composer&#39;s 41st birthday, the guests, including the <a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Wales" id="w">Prince of Wales</a> (later <a href="/wiki/Edward_VII" id="w">Edward VII</a>), heard a direct relay of parts of <i>Iolanthe</i> from the Savoy.  This was probably the first live &#34;broadcast&#34; of an opera.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the run of <i>Iolanthe</i>, in 1883, Sullivan was <a href="/wiki/British_honours_system" id="w">knighted</a> by <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Victoria</a>.  Although it was the operas with Gilbert that had earned him the broadest fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera&#8212;that a musical <a href="/wiki/Knighthood" id="w">knight</a> should not stoop below oratorio or <a href="/wiki/Grand_opera" id="w">grand opera</a>.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup>  Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills, and repetitious.  Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert&#39;s words could be heard. But paradoxically, in  February 1883, just after <i>Iolanthe</i> opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months&#39; notice.<sup id="_ref-Carpet_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carpet" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

The opera is based on <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Tennyson%2C_1st_Baron_Tennyson" id="w">Tennyson</a>&#39;s poem <i>The Princess: A Medley</i>. Gilbert had written a <a href="/wiki/Blank_verse" id="w">blank verse</a> farce based on the same material in 1870, called <i><a href="/wiki/The_Princess_(play)" id="w">The Princess</a></i>, and he reused a good deal of the dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of <i>Princess Ida</i>.  <i>Ida</i> is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts.  <a href="/wiki/Lillian_Russell" id="w">Lillian Russell</a> had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, she was dismissed.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Princess Ida</i> was the first of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that, by the partnership&#39;s previous standards, was not a success. A particularly hot summer in London did not help ticket sales.  The piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances and was not revived in London until 1919. Sullivan had been satisfied with the libretto, but two months after <i>Ida</i> opened, Sullivan told Carte that &#34;it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Carpet_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carpet" title="">[5]</a></sup>  As <i>Princess Ida</i> showed signs of flagging, Carte realized that, for the first time in the partnership&#39;s history, no new opera would be ready when the old one closed.  On <a href="/wiki/22_March" id="w">22 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1884" id="w">1884</a>, he gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required in six months&#39; time.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup>  In the meantime, when <i>Ida</i> closed, Carte produced a revival of <i>The Sorcerer</i>.</p>

<p>The most successful of the Savoy Operas was <i><a href="/wiki/The_Mikado" id="w">The Mikado</a></i> (1885), which made fun of English bureaucracy, thinly diguised by a Japanese setting.

 story focuses on a &#34;cheap tailor,&#34; Ko-Ko, who is promoted to the position of Lord High Executioner of the town of Titipu.  Ko-Ko loves his ward, Yum-Yum, but she loves a musician, who is really the son of the emperor of Japan (the Mikado), and who is in disguise to escape the attentions of the elderly and amorous Katisha.  The Mikado has decreed that executions must resume without delay in Titipu.  When news arrives that the Mikado will be visiting the town, Ko-Ko assumes that he is coming to ascertain whether Ko-Ko has carried out the executions.  Too timid to execute anyone, Ko-Ko cooks up a conspiracy to misdirect the Mikado, which goes awry.  Eventually, Ko-Ko must persuade Katisha to marry him, in order to save his own life and the lives of the other conspirators.</p>
<p>With the opening of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable in London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan.  Gilbert said, {{cquote}}</p>
<p>Setting the opera in <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>, an exotic locale far away from Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British politics and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings.  Gilbert wrote, &#34;The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution.&#34;<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/G._K._Chesterton" id="w">G.

<p><i>The Mikado</i> became the partnership&#39;s longest-running hit, enjoying 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, which was the second longest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup>  <i>The Mikado</i> remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup>  It has been translated into numerous languages and is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup>  </p>
<dl><dt><i>Ruddigore</i></dt></dl>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Ruddigore" id="w">Ruddigore</a></i> (1887), a topsy-turvy take on Victorian <a href="/wiki/Melodrama" id="w">melodrama</a>, was less successful than most of the earlier collaborations with a run of 288 performances.  The original title, <i>Ruddygore</i>, together with some of the plot devices, including the revivification of ghosts, drew negative comments from critics.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup>  Gilbert and Sullivan respelled the title and made a number of changes and cuts.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup>  Nevertheless, the piece was profitable,<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> and the reviews were not all bad.  For instance, the <i><a href="/wiki/Illustrated_London_News" id="w">Illustrated London News</a></i> praised the work and both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: &#34;Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun.&#34;<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup>  Further changes were made, including a new overture, when <a href="/wiki/Rupert_D%26%2339%3BOyly_Carte" id="w">Rupert D&#39;Oyly Carte</a> revived <i>Ruddigore</i> after the <a href="/wiki/First_World_War" id="w">First World War</a>, and the piece was regularly performed by the D&#39;Oyly Carte Opera Company thereafter.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> </p>

When Ruddigore closed, no new opera was ready.  Gilbert again proposed a version of the &#34;lozenge&#34; plot for their next opera, and Sullivan reiterated his desire to leave the partnership.

The critics, who had recently lauded the composer for his successful oratorio, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Golden_Legend_(oratorio)" id="w">The Golden Legend</a></i>, considered the score to <i>Yeomen</i> to be Sullivan&#39;s finest, including its overture, which was written in <a href="/wiki/Sonata_form" id="w">sonata form</a>, rather than as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as in most of his other overtures.  The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> wrote:

<p><i>Yeomen</i> was a hit, running for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions.  During the run, on 12 March 1889, Sullivan wrote to Gilbert, {{cquote}}  Sullivan insisted that the next opera must be a <a href="/wiki/Grand_opera" id="w">grand opera</a>.  Gilbert did not feel that he could write a grand opera libretto, but he offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted.  The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan a grand opera (<i><a href="/wiki/Ivanhoe_(opera)" id="w">Ivanhoe</a></i>) for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera.

Gilbert and Sullivan sometimes had a strained working relationship, partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself allowing his work to be subjugated to the other&#39;s, and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two—Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned (though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness), while Sullivan eschewed conflict.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup>   In addition, Gilbert imbued his <a href="/wiki/Libretto" id="w">libretti</a> with &#34;topsy-turvy&#34; situations in which the social order was turned upside down.  After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan&#39;s desire for realism and emotional content.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup>  Also, Gilbert&#39;s political satire often poked fun at the wealthy and powerful whom Sullivan sought out for friendship and patronage.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gilbert and Sullivan quarrelled several times over the choice of a subject.  After both <i>Princess Ida</i> and <i>Ruddigore</i>, which were less successful than the seven other operas from <i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i> to <i>The Gondoliers</i>, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert&#39;s plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him.  While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works.  On each occasion, after a few months&#39; pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan&#39;s objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.<sup id="_ref-Carpet_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carpet" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the run of <i>The Gondoliers</i>, however, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained:
{{cquote}}</p>
<p>Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building a theatre in London for the production of new English grand operas, with Sullivan&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Ivanhoe_(opera)" id="w">Ivanhoe</a></i> as the inaugural work. While the protracted quarrel worked itself out in the courts and in public, Gilbert wrote <i><a href="/wiki/The_Mountebanks_(opera)" id="w">The Mountebanks</a></i> with <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Cellier" id="w">Alfred Cellier</a> and the flop <i><a href="/wiki/Haste_to_the_Wedding" id="w">Haste to the Wedding</a></i> with <a href="/wiki/George_Grossmith" id="w">George Grossmith</a>,<sup id="_ref-PlayList_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PlayList" title="">[64]</a></sup> and Sullivan also wrote <i><a href="/wiki/Haddon_Hall_(opera)" id="w">Haddon Hall</a></i> with Sidney Grundy.</p>
<p>In 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation by the pair and their producer, Richard D&#39;Oyly Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s music publisher, <a href="/wiki/William_Chappell" id="w">Tom Chappell</a>, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>

<i><a href="/wiki/Utopia%2C_Limited" id="w">Utopia, Limited</a></i> (1893), their penultimate opera, was a very modest success, and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Grand_Duke" id="w">The Grand Duke</a></i> (1896) was an outright failure.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> Neither work entered the &#34;canon&#34; of regularly-performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D&#39;Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert also offered Sullivan <i><a href="/wiki/His_Excellency_(opera)" id="w">His Excellency</a></i> (1894), but Gilbert&#39;s insistence on casting <a href="/wiki/Nancy_McIntosh" id="w">Nancy McIntosh</a>, his protégée from <i>Utopia</i>, led to Sullivan&#39;s refusal, and it was instead composed by <a href="/wiki/F._Osmond_Carr" id="w">F. Osmond Carr</a>.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>After <i>The Grand Duke</i>, the partners saw no reason to work together again. Sullivan, by this time in exceedingly poor health, died four years later, although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists, most successfully with <a href="/wiki/Basil_Hood" id="w">Basil Hood</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Rose_of_Persia" id="w">The Rose of Persia</a></i> (1899), and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Emerald_Isle" id="w">The Emerald Isle</a></i> (1901) (finished by <a href="/wiki/Edward_German" id="w">Edward German</a> after Sullivan&#39;s death).  By the time of Sullivan&#39;s death, Gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been &#34;completely bridged over,&#34; and &#34;the most cordial relations existed between us.&#34;  He stated that Sullivan was <i>&#34;A composer of the rarest genius — who, because he was a composer of the rarest genius, was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be, but seldom is....  I remember all that he has done for me in allowing his genius to shed some of its lustre upon my humble name.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup>  Gilbert went into semi-retirement, although he continued to direct revivals of the Savoy Operas and wrote new plays occasionally. He wrote only one more comic opera, <i><a href="/wiki/Fallen_Fairies" id="w">Fallen Fairies</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1909" id="w">1909</a>; music by <a href="/wiki/Edward_German" id="w">Edward German</a>), which was not a success.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Richard_D%26%2339%3BOyly_Carte" id="w">Richard D&#39;Oyly Carte</a> died in 1901, and his widow, <a href="/wiki/Helen_Carte" id="w">Helen</a>, and then his son, <a href="/wiki/Rupert_D%26%2339%3BOyly_Carte" id="w">Rupert</a>, followed by his granddaughter, <a href="/wiki/Bridget_D%26%2339%3BOyly_Carte" id="w">Bridget</a>, continued to direct the activities of the D&#39;Oyly Carte Opera Company, which staged revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas until it closed in 1982.  </p>

<p>Because of the unusual success of the operas, the D&#39;Oyly Carte Opera Company were able, from the start, to license the works to other professional companies, such as the <a href="/wiki/J._C._Williamson_Gilbert_and_Sullivan_Opera_Company" id="w">J.
