<p>The bridge was one of the two major river crossings of <a href="/wiki/I-35W_(Minnesota)" id="w">I-35W</a> in Minnesota, (the western branch of <a href="/wiki/Interstate_35" id="w">Interstate 35</a> through the <a href="/wiki/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul" id="w">Minneapolis-Saint Paul</a> metropolitan area). The other major bridge is the <a href="/wiki/I-35W_Minnesota_River_bridge" id="w">I-35W Minnesota River bridge</a> located 15&#160;miles (24&#160;km) to the south over the <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_River" id="w">Minnesota River</a>.</p>
<a id="Site_history" name="Site_history"></a><h2>Site history</h2>
<p>The I-35W Mississippi River bridge was located in the area where Minneapolis began, located just downstream from <a href="/wiki/Saint_Anthony_Falls" id="w">Saint Anthony Falls</a>, which is the only natural waterfall in the Upper Mississippi River.  Completed in 1956, the lower Saint Anthony Falls dam is a gravity type <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" id="w">hydro-electric dam</a> {{convert}} in height.  In November of 1987 the Saint Anthony Lower Hydro-Electric Plant experienced an undermining failure and on <a href="/wiki/August_19" id="w">August 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1988" id="w">1988</a> the facility was razed; it had been very near the north bank foundation pier of the I-35W bridge. </p>
<p>The area of the bridge&#39;s south abutment was a site of industrial chemical pollution. For 90 years prior to the bridge&#39;s construction, <a href="/wiki/History_of_Minneapolis%2C_Minnesota#Hydroelectric power" id="w">Minnegasco&#39;s</a> predecessor, Minneapolis Gas Works,<sup id="_ref-burned_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-burned" title="">[13]</a></sup> operated a <a href="/wiki/Coal_gas" id="w">coal-to-gas</a> processing plant on a 20-acre (8 <a href="/wiki/Hectare" id="w">ha</a>) tract on the south bank of the river at the later site of the bridge.<sup id="_ref-toxic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-toxic" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-legacy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-legacy" title="">[15]</a></sup> Minnegasco, which became part of <a href="/wiki/CenterPoint_Energy" id="w">CenterPoint Energy</a>,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> demolished the plant in the 1960s, since the wide availability of natural gas made the coal-to-gas processing plant obsolete.<sup id="_ref-toxic_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-toxic" title="">[14]</a></sup> Half the site was sold to Continental Oil Company (<a href="/wiki/Conoco" id="w">Conoco</a>), which stored and processed petroleum products on the site for 20 years.<sup id="_ref-toxic_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-toxic" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The tract&#39;s long-term industrial use effectively resulted in a toxic-waste dump below the bridge. The legal wrangling over the bill for the riverfront cleanup led to a 1991 lawsuit.<sup id="_ref-toxic_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-toxic" title="">[14]</a></sup> 15,000&#160;tons (13,600 <a href="/wiki/Tonne" id="w">t</a>) of contaminated soil were removed from below the bridge, ground up with wood chips and burned as a fuel additive for a power plant between 1993 and 1998 at a cost of <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$30</a> million.<sup id="_ref-burned_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-burned" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> No causal relationship has been proven between the prior use and subsequent bridge failure.</p>

In its entirety, the bridge was over 1,900&#160;feet (580&#160;m) long. It consisted of fourteen spans: five south approach spans, three main spans, and six north approach spans. The three main spans were of <a href="/wiki/Truss_bridge" id="w">deck truss</a> construction while all but two of the approach spans were <a href="/wiki/Girder_bridge" id="w">steel multi-girder</a> construction with the remaining two approach spans being <a href="/wiki/Concrete_slab" id="w">concrete slab</a> construction. The bridge had no <a href="/wiki/Deep_foundation" id="w">piers</a> built into the <a href="/wiki/Stream_bed" id="w">river bed</a>; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140&#160;m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119&#160;m) wide navigation channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river.<sup id="_ref-WCCO_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WCCO" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CJAD_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CJAD" title="">[24]</a></sup> The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main trusses.

<a id="Black_ice" name="Black_ice"></a><h3>Black ice</h3>
<p>In February and in December 1996, the bridge was identified as the single most treacherous cold-weather spot in the <a href="/wiki/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul" id="w">Twin Cities</a> freeway system, because of the almost frictionless thin layer of <a href="/wiki/Black_ice" id="w">black ice</a> which regularly forms as temperatures drop to 30s Fahrenheit (−1°C to 4°C) and below. The bridge&#39;s proximity to Saint Anthony Falls contributed significantly to the icing problem and the site was noted for frequent spinouts and collisions<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> By January 1999, Mn/DOT began testing <a href="/wiki/Magnesium_chloride" id="w">magnesium chloride</a> solutions and a mixture of magnesium chloride and a corn-processing byproduct to see whether either would reduce the black ice that appeared on the bridge during the winter months.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> In October 1999, the state embedded temperature-activated nozzles in the bridge deck to spray the bridge with <a href="/wiki/Potassium_acetate" id="w">potassium acetate</a> solution to keep the area free of winter black ice.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> The system came into operation in 2000.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> It has been raised as a possibility that the potassium acetate may have contributed to the collapse of the 35W bridge.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">I-35W bridge (left) in 2006</div>
Since 1993, the bridge was inspected annually by Mn/DOT, although no inspection report was completed in 2007, due to the construction work.<sup id="_ref-cp0809_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cp0809" title="">[20]</a></sup> In the years prior to the collapse, several reports cited problems with the bridge structure. In 1990, the federal government gave the I-35W bridge a rating of &#34;structurally deficient,&#34; citing significant corrosion in its bearings. &#34;Structurally deficient&#34; is a classification term which does not in itself indicate a lack of safety. Approximately 75,000 other U.S. bridges had this classification in 2007.<sup id="_ref-cp0809_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cp0809" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to a 2001 study by the civil engineering department of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Minnesota" id="w">University of Minnesota</a>, cracking had been previously discovered in the cross girders at the end of the approach spans. The main trusses connected to these cross girders and resistance to motion at the connection point bearings was leading to unanticipated out-of-plane distortion of the cross girders and subsequent stress cracking. The situation was addressed prior to the study by drilling the cracks to prevent further propagation and adding supports struts to the cross girder to prevent further distortion. The report also noted a concern about lack of redundancy in the main <a href="/wiki/Truss" id="w">truss</a> system, which meant the bridge had a greater risk of collapse in the event of any single structural failure. Although the report concluded that the bridge should not have any problems with <a href="/wiki/Fatigue_(material)" id="w">fatigue cracking</a> in the foreseeable future, the bridge instrumentation by strain gages and continuous <a href="/wiki/Structural_health_monitoring" id="w">structural health monitoring</a> had been suggested<sup id="_ref-fatigue_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fatigue" title="">[21]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The federal National Bridge Inventory database of inspection records show that the I-35W bridge ranked near the bottom of federal inspection ratings nationwide. The scale used was a &#34;sufficiency rating&#34; which ranges from the highest score, 100, to the lowest score, zero. A score below 80 indicates that some rehabilitation may be needed, while a score of 50 or less shows that replacement may be in order. This measure includes safety elements (such as structural integrity) and factors in elements such as the bridge&#39;s size with respect to its current traffic. The I-35W bridge was given a rating of 50 in the year 2005. Out of 104,348 heavily used bridge structures (those with more than 10,000 vehicles traveling on them per day), only 4,227, or 4%, scored below 50, according to an analysis of federal records by MSNBC. Although, on a separate measure, the I-35W bridge was rated &#34;structurally deficient,&#34; it was deemed to have met &#34;minimum tolerable limits to be left in place as it is.&#34;<sup id="_ref-mndot061005_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mndot061005" title="">[41]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-mndot061506_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mndot061506" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>In December 2006, a steel reinforcement project was planned for the bridge. However, the project was canceled in January 2007 in favor of periodic safety inspections, after it was revealed that drilling for the retrofitting would in fact weaken the bridge. In internal Mn/DOT documents, bridge officials talked about the possibility of the bridge collapsing and worried that it might have to be condemned.<sup id="_ref-Phone call_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phone call" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>The construction taking place for the few weeks prior to the collapse was minor and cosmetic, focusing on replacing lighting, concrete and <a href="/wiki/Guard_rail" id="w">guard rails</a> and some work on joints.
