<p>The <b>District Municipality of Tumbler Ridge</b> is a small town in the foothills of the <a href="/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" id="w">Rocky Mountains</a> in northeastern <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, and a member <a href="/wiki/Municipality" id="w">municipality</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_Regional_District" id="w">Peace River Regional District</a>. The municipality of {{km2 to sq mi}}, with its population of 2,454&#160;people, incorporates a townsite and a large area of mostly <a href="/wiki/Crown_land" id="w">Crown land</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The housing and municipal infrastructure, along with regional infrastructure connecting the <a href="/wiki/New_town" id="w">new town</a> to other municipalities, were built simultaneously in 1981 by the provincial government to service the coal industry as part of the <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia_Resources_Investment_Corporation" id="w">BCRIC Northeast Coal project</a>.</p>
<p>In 1981, a consortium of Japanese steel mills agreed to purchase 100 million tonnes of coal over 15 years for US$7.5 billion from two mining companies, <a href="/wiki/Denison_Mines" id="w">Denison Mines Inc.</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Teck_Cominco" id="w">Teck Corporation</a> who were to operate the Quintette mine and the Bullmoose mine, respectively, from Tumbler Ridge. Declining global coal prices after 1981, and <a href="/wiki/East_Asian_financial_crisis" id="w">weakening Asian markets</a> in the late-1990s, made the town&#39;s future uncertain and kept it from achieving its projected population of 10,000 people. The uncertainty dissuaded investment and kept the economy from diversifying. When price reductions were forced onto the mines, production was shifted entirely to the lower-cost Bullmoose mine, closing the Quintette mine in 2000 before exhausting its supply of coal. Since 2000 rising coal prices have led to the opening of new mines in and near the municipality, including Northern Energy &#38; Mining Inc.&#39;s Trend mine and <a href="/wiki/Western_Canadian_Coal" id="w">Western Canadian Coal</a>&#39;s Dillon, Wolverine, and Brule mines.</p>
<p>After dinosaur footprints, fossils, and bones were discovered in the municipality, along with fossils of <a href="/wiki/Triassic" id="w">Triassic</a> fishes and <a href="/wiki/Cretaceous" id="w">cretaceous</a> plants, the Peace Region Paleontology Research Centre opened in 2003. The research centre and a dinosaur museum were funded in part by the federal <a href="/wiki/Western_Economic_Diversification_Canada" id="w">Western Economic Diversification Canada</a> to decrease economic dependence on the coal industry. Economic diversification has also occurred with oil and gas exploration, forestry, and recreational tourism. Nearby recreational destinations include numerous trails, mountains, waterfalls, snowmobiling areas and <a href="/wiki/List_of_British_Columbia_Provincial_Parks" id="w">provincial parks</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/Monkman_Provincial_Park" id="w">Monkman Provincial Park</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bearhole_Lake_Provincial_Park_and_Protected_Area" id="w">Bearhole Lake Provincial Park</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Gwillim_Lake_Provincial_Park" id="w">Gwillim Lake Provincial Park</a>.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>Archaeological evidence show a human presence dating back 3,000 years.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The nomadic <a href="/wiki/Sekani" id="w">Sekani</a>, followed by the <a href="/wiki/Dunneza" id="w">Dunneza</a> and then the <a href="/wiki/Cree" id="w">Cree</a>, periodically lived in temporary settlements around future municipality.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Formal exploratory and surveying expeditions were conducted by S. Prescott Fay, with Robert Cross and Fred Brewster in 1914, J.C. Gwillim in 1919, Edmund Spieker in 1920, and John Holzworth in 1923. Spieker coined the name <i>Tumbler Ridge</i>, referring to the mountains northwest of the future town, by altering Gwillim&#39;s map which named them <i>Tumbler Range</i>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Permanent settlers, five families by 1920, were squatters who maintained trap lines. In the 1950s and 1960s some logging and oil and natural gas exploration was conducted through the area and 15 significant coal deposits were discovered.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Coal prices rose after from the <a href="/wiki/1973_oil_crisis" id="w">1973 oil crisis</a> leading to 40 government studies to assess the viability of accessing the coal given the mountainous barrier to the south and west and the distance to the nearest port.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>With these coal deposits in mind, a purchasing agreement was signed in 1981 by two Canadian mining companies, a consortium of Japanese steel mills, and the governments of British Columbia and Canada. As part of the deal the provincial government committed, under the North East Coal Development plan, to build a <a href="/wiki/New_town" id="w">new town</a> near the deposits, extend two highways off <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia_Highway_97#John Hart Highway" id="w">Highway 97</a>, a power line from the <a href="/wiki/W._A._C._Bennett_Dam" id="w">W. A. C. Bennett Dam</a> at <a href="/wiki/Hudson%26%2339%3Bs_Hope%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Hudson&#39;s Hope</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Branch_line" id="w">branch rail line</a> through the Rocky Mountains. An alternative of using work camps staffed by people bussed in from Dawson Creek and Chetwynd was also considered. Planning for the new town began in 1976 with the objective to have a fully functioning town ready before residents arrived which required massive initial investments.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Coordinated through the provincial Ministry of Municipal Affairs the town, regional infrastructure, and mining plants were all built simultaneously. When the municipality was incorporated in January 1981 the area was completely forested.<sup id="_ref-AHN30Dec81_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AHN30Dec81" title="">[8]</a></sup> During that year building sites and roadways were cleared<sup id="_ref-AHN30Dec81_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AHN30Dec81" title="">[8]</a></sup> and in the winter the water and sewerage system was built. In 1982 houses and other buildings were constructed. Full production at the mines was reached the following year.</p>
<p>In 1984, as the Tumbler Ridge&#39;s secondary school and recreation centre opened, world coal prices were dropping and the Japanese consortium requested a reduction in the price of coal from the Tumbler Ridge mines. As price reduction requests continued, the concern over the viability of the mines led the BC Assessment Review Board to lower the 1987 property assessments for the Quintette mine from <a href="/wiki/CAD%24" id="w">CAD$156</a> million to $89 million and the Bullmoose mine $70 million to $43 million, so that they could pay less tax. The purchasing agreement was taken to the Supreme Court which issued a ruling in 1990 requiring the Quintette Operations Company to reduce coal prices and reimburse the Japanese consortium $4.6 million. The company responded by reducing production, cutting employment, and appling for court protection from creditors. This allowed Teck to acquire 50% interest and take over management of the Quintette mine but it was unable to stop further job losses.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> As most residents left town apartment blocks were closed and the mine companies bought back all but 11 houses in the town. After 30% of the workforce had been laid off, new contracts with the Japanese consortium were signed in 1997, allowing re-hirings to begin, but with lower export levels.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The North East Coal Development was projected to create a net benefit of $0.9 billion (2000 <a href="/wiki/CAD%24" id="w">CAD$</a>) but incurred a net loss of $2.8 billion and half the expected regional employment.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The population declined as many residents were not able to find other work in the town, even with the opening of a sawmill for specialty woods in 1999. After Teck closed the Quintette mine in August 2000 and shifted production to the lower cost Bullmoose mine, the town council established the Tumbler Ridge Revitalization Task Force to investigate ways to boost and diversify the economy. The Task Force negotiated the return of the housing stock from the mines to the free market, grants from the province to become debt-free,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> and stabilized funds from the province for healthcare and education.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since the Bullmoose mine exhausted its supply of coal in 2003, world coal prices have increased again making exploration and mining in Tumbler Ridge economically feasible again. Western Canadian Coal opened new open-pit mining operations creating the Dillon mine using Bullmoose mining infrastructure, the Brule mine using new infrastructure (projected 11 year life span),<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> the Wolverine mine.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Hillsborough_Resources_Limited" id="w">Hillsborough Resources Limited</a> and AESWapiti Energy Corporation are constructing a combined coal mining plant and <a href="/wiki/Thermal_power_station" id="w">thermal</a> <a href="/wiki/Fossil_fuel_power_plant" id="w">coal-fired power station</a> north of the townsite.</p>

<p>While the town and mines were being constructed crews numbering from 200 to 2,000 workers lived in work camps. Population projections made in 1977 estimated there to be 3,568 residents in 1981, 7,940 in 1985, and 10,584 in 1987, after which the level was expected to stabilize.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>  However, requests for lower coal prices shortly after the production began placed a peristent insecurity over the viability of the mines, and therefore the town, discouraging long term investments. By 1984, the population was estimated to be 3,833 people, nearly half the projected level.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Canada_1986_Census" id="w">1986 Canadian census</a>, the first census to include Tumbler Ridge, recorded 4,566 residents after which in-migration ended and the population level began to fluctuate. The population peaked in 1991 with 4,794 people but then declined to a low of 1,932 people in 2001. Since then, population growth has been led by increased exploration and mining activities due to higher world energy prices.

<a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Tumbler Ridge was built to provide a labour force for the coal mining industry, which has remained the dominant employer throughout the town&#39;s history. The mining companies had a contract to sell 100 million tons of coal to a consortium of Japanese steel mills over 15 years for US$7.5 billion (1981). The Quintette Operating Corporation was formed by partnership between <a href="/wiki/Denison_Mines" id="w">Denison Mines</a> (50%), <a href="/wiki/Mitsui" id="w">Mitsui Mining</a> (20%), Tokyo Boeki (20%), and other smaller firms, and began blasting at the Quintette mine in October 1982. The Bullmoose Operating Corporation was formed by the <a href="/wiki/Teck_Cominco" id="w">Teck Corporation</a> (51%), Lornex (39%), <a href="/wiki/Nissho_Iwai" id="w">Nissho Iwai</a> (10%) and worked the smaller Bullmoose mine. The economic viability of the mining companies were in question since the world coal prices began falling in the early-1980s and the Japanese consortium requested reduced prices. After the Supreme Court ruled that the coal prices must be reduced, the QOC filed for court protection from its creditors allowing the Teck Corporation to take over management in 1992. By 1996, even with continuing lay-offs, over half of the town&#39;s labour force were employed at one of the two mines.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> New contracts with the Japanese consortium signed 1997 moved production to the lower cost Bullmoose mine but guaranteed production until 2003 when that mine was expected to be exhausted. The Quintette mine was closed altogether on <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>, 2000.</p>
<p>While there was an intent by the town&#39;s planners to move to a more diversified economy, the few initiatives in this direction were not supported by the industries or local decision-makers.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> Uncertainty about the town&#39;s future was a serious concern to residents since the 1984 price reduction demands, it was not until the closure of the Quintette mine did the town seriously investigate a diversification. Since then employment has been generated in tourism (attractions from dinosaur fossil discoveries, outdoor recreation, and nearby provincial parks), forestry, and oil and gas exploration.</p>
<p>Increasing world energy prices have brought mining back to Tumbler Ridge. In 2003 Western Canadian Coal opened the Dillon mine using the infrastructure from the Bullmoose mine and is constructing new infrastructure for the larger Brule mine, next to the Dillon mine. WCC is also opening the Wolverine mine between the former Bullmoose and Quintette plants. <a href="/wiki/Hillsborough_Resources_Limited" id="w">Hillsborough Resources Limited</a> will be opening the Horizon mine north of town and using the coal in a thermal coal power plant, B.C.&#39;s first coal power plant.</p>
