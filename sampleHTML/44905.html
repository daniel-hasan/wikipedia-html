<b>Asthma</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Chronic_(medicine)" id="w">chronic</a> <a href="/wiki/Condition" id="w">condition</a> involving the <a href="/wiki/Respiratory_system" id="w">respiratory system</a> in which the <a href="/wiki/Lung" id="w">airway</a> occasionally constricts, becomes <a href="/wiki/Inflammation" id="w">inflamed</a>, and is lined with excessive amounts of <a href="/wiki/Mucus" id="w">mucus</a>, often in response to one or more triggers. These episodes may be triggered by such things as exposure to an environmental stimulant (or <a href="/wiki/Allergen" id="w">allergen</a>) such as cold air, warm air, moist air, <a href="/wiki/Exercise" id="w">exercise</a> or exertion, or emotional <a href="/wiki/Stress_(medicine)" id="w">stress</a>. In children, the most common triggers are viral illnesses such as those that cause the <a href="/wiki/Common_cold" id="w">common cold</a>.<sup id="_ref-Zhao_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zhao" title="">[1]</a></sup>  This airway narrowing causes <a href="/wiki/Symptom" id="w">symptoms</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Wheezing" id="w">wheezing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dyspnea" id="w">shortness of breath</a>, chest tightness, and <a href="/wiki/Cough" id="w">coughing</a>. The airway constriction responds to <a href="/wiki/Bronchodilators" id="w">bronchodilators</a>. Between episodes, most patients feel well but can have mild symptoms and they may remain short of breath after exercise for longer periods of time than the unaffected individual. The symptoms of asthma, which can range from mild to life threatening, can usually be controlled with a combination of <a href="/wiki/Medication" id="w">drugs</a> and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Public attention in the <a href="/wiki/Developed_country" id="w">developed world</a> has recently focused on asthma because of its rapidly increasing <a href="/wiki/Prevalence" id="w">prevalence</a>, affecting up to one in four urban children.<sup id="_ref-Lilly_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lilly" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h1>Etymology</h1>
<p>The word &#39;asthma&#39; is derived from the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" id="w">Greek</a> <i>aazein</i>, meaning &#34;sharp breath.&#34; The word first appears in Homer&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Iliad" id="w">Iliad</a></i>;<sup id="_ref-Marketos_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marketos" title="">[3]</a></sup>
<a href="/wiki/Hippocrates" id="w">Hippocrates</a> was the first to use it in reference to the medical condition, in 450 BC. Hippocrates thought that the spasms associated with asthma were more likely to occur in tailors, anglers, and metalworkers. Six centuries later, <a href="/wiki/Galen" id="w">Galen</a> wrote much about asthma, noting that it was caused by partial or complete bronchial obstruction. In 1190 AD, <a href="/wiki/Moses_Maimonides" id="w">Moses Maimonides</a>, an influential medieval <a href="/wiki/Rabbi" id="w">rabbi</a>, philosopher, and physician, wrote a treatise on asthma, describing its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.<sup id="_ref-Rosner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rosner" title="">[4]</a></sup>
In the 17th century, <a href="/wiki/Bernardino_Ramazzini" id="w">Bernardino Ramazzini</a> noted a connection between asthma and <a href="/wiki/Organic_compound" id="w">organic</a> dust. The use of <a href="/wiki/Bronchodilator" id="w">bronchodilators</a> started in 1901, but it was not until the 1960s that the inflammatory component of asthma was recognized, and <a href="/wiki/Anti-inflammatory" id="w">anti-inflammatory</a> medications were added to the regimens.</p>
<a id="Signs_and_symptoms" name="Signs_and_symptoms"></a><h1>Signs and symptoms</h1>
<p>In some individuals asthma is characterized by chronic respiratory impairment.  In others it is an intermittent illness marked by episodic symptoms that may result from a number of triggering events, including upper respiratory infection, stress, airborne allergens, air pollutants (such as smoke or traffic fumes), or exercise. Some or all of the following symptoms may be present in those with asthma: <a href="/wiki/Dyspnea" id="w">dyspnea</a>, wheezing, <a href="/wiki/Stridor" id="w">stridor</a>, coughing, an inability for physical exertion. Some asthmatics that have severe shortness of breath and tightening of the lungs never wheeze or have stridor and their symptoms may be confused with a <a href="/wiki/COPD" id="w">COPD</a>-type disease. </p>   
<p>An acute exacerbation of asthma is referred to as an <i>asthma attack</i>. The clinical hallmarks of an attack are shortness of breath (<a href="/wiki/Dyspnea" id="w">dyspnea</a>) and either <a href="/wiki/Wheeze" id="w">wheezing</a> or <a href="/wiki/Stridor" id="w">stridor</a>.<sup id="_ref-McFadden_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McFadden" title="">[5]</a></sup> Although the former is &#34;often regarded as the <i><a href="/wiki/Sine_qua_non" id="w">sine qua non</a></i> of asthma&#34;,<sup id="_ref-McFadden_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McFadden" title="">[5]</a></sup> some patients present primarily with <a href="/wiki/Cough" id="w">coughing</a>, and in the late stages of an attack, air motion may be so impaired that no wheezing may be heard. When present the cough may sometimes produce clear <a href="/wiki/Sputum" id="w">sputum</a>. The onset may be sudden, with a sense of constriction in the chest, breathing becomes difficult, and wheezing occurs (primarily upon expiration, but can be in both <a href="/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)" id="w">respiratory</a> phases). </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sign_(medicine)" id="w">Signs</a> of an asthmatic episode include wheezing (<a href="/wiki/Tachypnea" id="w">tachypnea</a>), prolonged expiration, a rapid heart rate (<a href="/wiki/Tachycardia" id="w">tachycardia</a>), <a href="/wiki/Rhonchus" id="w">rhonchous</a> lung sounds (audible through a <a href="/wiki/Stethoscope" id="w">stethoscope</a>), and over-inflation of the chest. During a serious asthma attack, the accessory <a href="/wiki/Muscle" id="w">muscles</a> of respiration (sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles of the neck) may be used, shown as in-drawing of <a href="/wiki/Biological_tissue" id="w">tissues</a> between the ribs and above the <a href="/wiki/Sternum" id="w">sternum</a> and <a href="/wiki/Clavicle" id="w">clavicles</a>, and the presence of a <a href="/wiki/Paradoxical_pulse" id="w">paradoxical pulse</a> (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation).</p>
<p>During very severe attacks, an asthma sufferer can <a href="/wiki/Cyanosis" id="w">turn blue</a> from lack of oxygen, and can experience <a href="/wiki/Chest_pain" id="w">chest pain</a> or even loss of <a href="/wiki/Consciousness" id="w">consciousness</a>.  Just before loss of consciousness, there is a chance that the patient will feel numbness in the limbs and palms may start to sweat. Feet may become icy cold.  Severe asthma attacks, which may not be responsive to standard treatments (<i><a href="/wiki/Status_asthmaticus" id="w">status asthmaticus</a></i>), are life-threatening and may lead to respiratory arrest and death.  Despite the severity of symptoms during an asthmatic episode, between attacks an asthmatic may show few or even no signs of the disease.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Diagnosis" name="Diagnosis"></a><h1>Diagnosis</h1>
<p>Asthma is defined simply as reversible airway obstruction.  Reversibility occurs either spontaneously or with treatment.  The basic measurement is <a href="/wiki/Peak_expiratory_flow_rate" id="w">peak flow rates</a> and the following diagnostic criteria are used by the <a href="/wiki/British_Thoracic_Society" id="w">British Thoracic Society</a>:<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul>
<li>≥20% difference on at least three days in a week for at least two weeks;</li>
<li>≥20% improvement of peak flow following treatment, for example:
<ul>
<li>10 minutes of inhaled β-agonist (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Salbutamol" id="w">salbutamol</a>);</li>
<li>six week of inhaled <a href="/wiki/Corticosteroid" id="w">corticosteroid</a> (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Beclometasone" id="w">beclometasone</a>);</li>
<li>14 days of 30mg <a href="/wiki/Prednisolone" id="w">prednisolone</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>≥20% decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger (e.g., exercise).</li></ul>
<p>In many cases, a physician can <a href="/wiki/Diagnosis" id="w">diagnose</a> asthma on the basis of typical findings in a patient&#39;s clinical history and examination. Asthma is strongly suspected if a patient suffers from <a href="/wiki/Eczema" id="w">eczema</a> or other <a href="/wiki/Allergy" id="w">allergic</a> conditions—suggesting a general <a href="/wiki/Atopy" id="w">atopic constitution</a>—or has a <a href="/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)" id="w">family history</a> of asthma. While measurement of airway function is possible for adults, most new cases are diagnosed in children who are unable to perform such tests. Diagnosis in children is based on a careful compilation and analysis of the patient&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Medical_history" id="w">medical history</a> and subsequent improvement with an inhaled <a href="/wiki/Bronchodilator" id="w">bronchodilator</a> medication. In adults, diagnosis can be made with a <a href="/wiki/Peak_flow_meter" id="w">peak flow meter</a> (which tests airway restriction), looking at both the diurnal <a href="/wiki/Circadian_rhythm" id="w">variation</a> and any reversibility following inhaled <a href="/wiki/Bronchodilator" id="w">bronchodilator</a> <a href="/wiki/Asthma#Rapid relief" id="w">medication</a>. </p>
<p>Testing peak flow at rest (or baseline) and after exercise can be helpful, especially in young asthmatics who may experience only <a href="/wiki/Exercise-induced_asthma" id="w">exercise-induced asthma</a>. If the diagnosis is in doubt, a more formal <a href="/wiki/Spirometry" id="w">lung function test</a> may be conducted. Once a diagnosis of asthma is made, a patient can use <a href="/wiki/Peak_flow_meter" id="w">peak flow meter</a> testing to monitor the severity of the disease.</p>
<p>Monitoring asthma with a peak flow meter on an ongoing basis assists with self monitoring of asthma. Peak flow readings can be charted on <a href="/wiki/Graph_paper" id="w">graph paper</a> charts together with a record of symptoms or use peak flow charting software<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>. This allows patients to track their peak flow readings and pass information back to their doctor or nurse.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Emergency Department doctors may use a <a href="/wiki/Capnography" id="w">capnography</a> which measures the amount of exhaled <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" id="w">carbon dioxide</a>,<sup id="_ref-pmid-16187465_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pmid-16187465" title="">[10]</a></sup> along with <a href="/wiki/Pulse_oximetry" id="w">pulse oximetry</a> which shows the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood, to determine the severity of an asthma attack as well as the response to treatment.  </p>
<a id="Differential_diagnosis" name="Differential_diagnosis"></a><h2>Differential diagnosis</h2>
<p>Before diagnosing someone as asthmatic, <a href="/wiki/Differential_diagnosis" id="w">alternative possibilities</a> should be considered. A clinician taking a history should check whether the patient is using any known bronchoconstrictors (substances that cause narrowing of the airways, e.g., certain <a href="/wiki/Anti-inflammatory" id="w">anti-inflammatory</a> agents or <a href="/wiki/Beta-blockers" id="w">beta-blockers</a>).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease" id="w">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>, which closely resembles asthma, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older patient, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration (as measured by <a href="/wiki/Spirometry" id="w">spirometry</a>), and decreased likelihood of family history of <a href="/wiki/Atopy" id="w">atopy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration" id="w">Pulmonary aspiration</a>, whether <b>direct</b> due to <a href="/wiki/Dysphagia" id="w">dysphagia</a> (swallowing disorder) or <b>indirect</b> (due to acid reflux), can show similar symptoms to asthma. However, with aspiration, fevers might also indicate <a href="/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia" id="w">aspiration pneumonia</a>. Direct aspiration (dysphagia) can be diagnosed by performing a Modified Barium Swallow test and treated with feeding therapy by a qualified <a href="/wiki/Speech_therapist" id="w">speech therapist</a>. If the aspiration is indirect (from acid reflux) then treatment directed at this is indicated.</p>
<p>A majority of children who are asthma sufferers have an identifiable <a href="/wiki/Allergy" id="w">allergy</a> trigger. Specifically, in a 2004 study, 71% had positive test results for more than 1 allergen, and 42% had positive test results for more than 3 allergens.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The majority of these triggers can often be identified from the history; for instance, asthmatics with <a href="/wiki/Hay_fever" id="w">hay fever</a> or <a href="/wiki/Pollen" id="w">pollen</a> allergy will have seasonal symptoms, those with allergies to <a href="/wiki/Pet" id="w">pets</a> may experience an abatement of symptoms when away from home, and those with <a href="/wiki/Occupational_asthma" id="w">occupational asthma</a> may improve during leave from work. <a href="/wiki/Allergy#Diagnosis" id="w">Allergy tests</a> can help identify avoidable symptom triggers. </p>
<p>After a <a href="/wiki/Pulmonary_function_test" id="w">pulmonary function test</a> has been carried out, radiological tests, such as a <a href="/wiki/Chest_X-ray" id="w">chest X-ray</a> or <a href="/wiki/Computed_tomography" id="w">CT scan</a>, may be required to exclude the possibility of other lung diseases. In some people, asthma may be triggered by <a href="/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease" id="w">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a>, which can be treated with suitable <a href="/wiki/Antacid" id="w">antacids</a>. Very occasionally, specialized tests after inhalation of <a href="/wiki/Methacholine_challenge_test" id="w">methacholine</a> — or, even less commonly, <a href="/wiki/Histamine" id="w">histamine</a> — may be performed.</p>
<p>Asthma is categorized by the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> <a href="/wiki/National_Heart%2C_Lung_and_Blood_Institute" id="w">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute</a> as falling into one of four categories: intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent and severe persistent.  The diagnosis of &#34;severe persistent asthma&#34; occurs when symptoms are continual with frequent exacerbations and frequent night-time symptoms, result in limited physical activity and when lung function as measured by PEV or FEV<sub>1</sub> tests is less than 60% predicted with PEF variability greater than 30%.</p>
<p>There is no cure for asthma. Doctors have only found ways to prevent attacks and relieve the symptoms such as tightness of the chest and trouble breathing.</p>

<a id="Bronchoconstriction" name="Bronchoconstriction"></a><h2>Bronchoconstriction</h2>
<p>During an asthma episode, inflamed <a href="/wiki/Bronchiole" id="w">airways</a> react to environmental triggers such as smoke, dust, or pollen. The airways narrow and produce excess <a href="/wiki/Mucus" id="w">mucus</a>, making it difficult to breathe.
In essence, asthma is the result of an <a href="/wiki/Immune_response" id="w">immune response</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Bronchial" id="w">bronchial</a> airways.<sup id="_ref-Maddox_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Maddox" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The airways of asthmatics are &#34;<a href="/wiki/Hypersensitivity" id="w">hypersensitive</a>&#34; to certain triggers, also known as <i>stimuli</i> (see below). In response to exposure to these triggers, the <a href="/wiki/Bronchi" id="w">bronchi</a> (large airways) contract into <a href="/wiki/Spasm" id="w">spasm</a> (an &#34;asthma attack&#34;). <a href="/wiki/Inflammation" id="w">Inflammation</a> soon follows, leading to a further narrowing of the airways and excessive <a href="/wiki/Mucus" id="w">mucus</a> production, which leads to coughing and other breathing difficulties.</p>

<a id="Bronchial_inflammation" name="Bronchial_inflammation"></a><h2>Bronchial inflammation</h2>
<p>The mechanisms behind allergic asthma—i.e., asthma resulting from an <a href="/wiki/Immune_response" id="w">immune response</a> to inhaled <a href="/wiki/Allergen" id="w">allergens</a>—are the best understood of the causal factors. In both asthmatics and non-asthmatics, inhaled allergens that find their way to the inner <a href="/wiki/Bronchiole" id="w">airways</a> are <a href="/wiki/Phagocytosis" id="w">ingested</a> by a type of cell known as <a href="/wiki/Antigen_presenting_cell" id="w">antigen presenting cells</a>, or APCs. APCs then &#34;present&#34; pieces of the allergen to other <a href="/wiki/Immune_system" id="w">immune system</a> cells. In most people, these other immune cells (<a href="/wiki/T_helper_cell" id="w">T&#60;sub&#62;H&#60;/sub&#62;0 cells</a>) &#34;check&#34; and usually ignore the allergen molecules. In asthmatics, however, these cells <a href="/wiki/Differentiation" id="w">transform</a> into a different type of cell (T<sub>H</sub>2), for reasons that are not well understood. The resultant T<sub>H</sub>2 cells activate an important arm of the immune system, known as the <a href="/wiki/Humoral_immunity" id="w">humoral immune system</a>. The humoral immune system produces <a href="/wiki/Antibody" id="w">antibodies</a> against the inhaled allergen. Later, when an asthmatic inhales the same allergen, these antibodies &#34;recognize&#34; it and activate a <a href="/wiki/Humoral_immune_response" id="w">humoral response</a>. <a href="/wiki/Inflammation" id="w">Inflammation</a> results: chemicals are produced that cause the airways to constrict and release more mucus, and the cell-mediated arm of the immune system is activated. The inflammatory response is responsible for the clinical manifestations of an asthma attack. The following section describes this complex series of events in more detail.</p>
<a id="Pathogenesis" name="Pathogenesis"></a><h2>Pathogenesis</h2>
<p>The fundamental problem in asthma appears to be <a href="/wiki/Immunology" id="w">immunological</a>: young children in the early stages of asthma show signs of excessive inflammation in their airways. <a href="/wiki/Epidemiology" id="w">Epidemiological findings</a> give clues as to the <a href="/wiki/Pathogenesis" id="w">pathogenesis</a>: the incidence of asthma seems to be increasing worldwide, and asthma is now very much more common in affluent countries.</p>
<p>In 1968 <a href="/wiki/Andor_Szentivanyi" id="w">Andor Szentivanyi</a> first described <i>The Beta Adrenergic Theory of Asthma</i>; in which blockage of the Beta-2 receptors of pulmonary smooth muscle cells causes asthma.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>
Szentivanyi&#39;s Beta Adrenergic Theory is a citation classic<sup id="_ref-Tribute_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tribute" title="">[17]</a></sup> and has been cited more times than any other article in the history of the Journal of Allergy.</p>
<p>In 1995 Szentivanyi and colleagues demonstrated that IgE blocks beta-2 receptors.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup>
Since overproduction of IgE is central to all atopic diseases, this was a watershed moment in the world of allergy.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Beta-Adrenergic Theory has been cited in the scholarship of such noted investigators as <a href="/wiki/Richard_F._Lockey" id="w">Richard F. Lockey</a> (former President of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology),<sup id="_ref-Richard_F_Lockey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Richard_F_Lockey" title="">[20]</a></sup> Charles Reed (Chief of Allergy at Mayo Medical School),<sup id="_ref-Charles_Reed_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Charles_Reed" title="">[21]</a></sup> and Craig Venter (Human Genome Project).<sup id="_ref-Craig_Venter_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Craig_Venter" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Causes" name="Causes"></a><h4>Causes</h4>
<p>Many studies have linked asthma, <a href="/wiki/Bronchitis" id="w">bronchitis</a>, and acute respiratory illnesses to <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" id="w">air quality</a> experienced by children.<sup id="_ref-asthma_air_quality_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-asthma_air_quality" title="">[23]</a></sup> One of the largest of these studies is the California Children&#39;s Health Study.<sup id="_ref-childrens_health_study_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-childrens_health_study" title="">[24]</a></sup> From the press release <a class="externallink" href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/nr013102.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/nr013102.htm">http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/nr013102.htm</a></p><blockquote>The study showed that children in the high ozone communities who played three or more sports developed asthma at a rate three times higher than those in the low ozone communities.

<p>Another theory of <a href="/wiki/Pathogenesis" id="w">pathogenesis</a> is that asthma is a disease of hygiene. In nature, babies are exposed to <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" id="w">bacteria</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Antigen" id="w">antigens</a> soon after birth, &#34;switching on&#34; the T<sub>H</sub>1 <a href="/wiki/Lymphocyte" id="w">lymphocyte</a> cells of the <a href="/wiki/Immune_system" id="w">immune system</a> that deal with bacterial infection. If this stimulus is insufficient, as it may be in modern, clean environments, then T<sub>H</sub>2 cells predominate, and asthma and other allergic diseases may develop. This &#34;<a href="/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis" id="w">hygiene hypothesis</a>&#34; may explain the increase in asthma in affluent populations. Support is provided by a recent European study which linked the of use cleaning sprays and air fresheners to asthma. <sup id="_ref-europe_study_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-europe_study" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>The T<sub>H</sub>2 lymphocytes and <a href="/wiki/Eosinophil" id="w">eosinophil</a> cells that protect us against <a href="/wiki/Parasite" id="w">parasites</a> and other infectious agents are the same cells responsible for the allergic reaction. <a href="/wiki/Charcot-Leyden_crystals" id="w">Charcot-Leyden crystals</a> are formed when crystalline material in eosinophils coalesce. These crystals are significant in sputum samples of people with asthma. In the developed world, the <a href="/wiki/Parasite" id="w">parasites</a> that eosinophils are programmed to combat are now rarely encountered, but the immune response remains and is wrongly triggered in some individuals by certain allergens.</p>
<p>It has been postulated that some forms of asthma may be related to infection, in particular by <i><a href="/wiki/Chlamydophila_pneumoniae" id="w">Chlamydia pneumoniae</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Thorax2006-Terttu_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Thorax2006-Terttu" title="">[26]</a></sup>

<p>The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as pets or aspirin, and limiting or eliminating exposure to them. <a href="/wiki/Desensitization_(medicine)" id="w">Desensitization</a> is currently the only known &#34;cure&#34; to the disease.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>As is common with respiratory disease, <a href="/wiki/Tobacco_smoking" id="w">smoking</a> is believed to adversely affect asthmatics in several ways, including an increased severity of symptoms, a more rapid decline of lung function, and decreased response to preventive medications.<sup id="_ref-thomson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thomson" title="">[38]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Automobile_emissions_control" id="w">Automobile emissions</a> are considered an even more significant cause and aggravating factor. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.ewg.org/sites/asthmaindex/youcan/regulators.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.ewg.org/sites/asthmaindex/youcan/regulators.php">http://www.ewg.org/sites/asthmaindex/youcan/regulators.php</a>

Furthermore, exposure of both non-smokers and smokers to wood smoke, gas stove fumes and <a href="/wiki/Second-hand_smoke" id="w">second-hand smoke</a> is detrimental, resulting in more severe asthma, more <a href="/wiki/Emergency_room" id="w">emergency room</a> visits, and more asthma-related hospital admissions.<sup id="_ref-eisner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eisner" title="">[39]</a></sup>

<p>The specific medical treatment recommended to patients with asthma depends on the severity of their illness and the frequency of their symptoms. Specific treatments for asthma are broadly classified as relievers, preventers and emergency treatment. The <i>Expert Panel Report 2: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma</i> (EPR-2)<sup id="_ref-epr2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-epr2" title="">[40]</a></sup>
of the U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, and the <i>British Guideline on the Management of Asthma</i><sup id="_ref-SIGN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SIGN" title="">[41]</a></sup>
are broadly used and supported by many doctors. On August 29, 2007 the final <i>Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma</i> was officially released. Bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief in all patients. For those who experience occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. For those with mild persistent disease (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled glucocorticoids or alternatively, an oral leukotriene modifier, a mast-cell stabilizer, or theophylline may be administered. For those who suffer daily attacks, a higher dose of glucocorticoid in conjunction with a long-acting inhaled β-2 agonist may be prescribed; alternatively, a leukotriene modifier or theophylline may substitute for the β-2 agonist. In severe asthmatics, oral glucocorticoids may be added to these treatments during severe attacks.</p>
<p>For those in whom exercise can trigger an asthma attack (<a href="/wiki/Exercise-induced_asthma" id="w">exercise-induced asthma</a>), higher levels of ventilation and cold, dry air tend to exacerbate attacks. For this reason, activities in which a patient breathes large amounts of cold air, such as skiing and running, tend to be worse for asthmatics, whereas swimming in an indoor, heated pool, with warm, humid air, is less likely to provoke a response.<sup id="_ref-McFadden_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McFadden" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Researchers at Harvard Medical School (HMS) have come up with convincing evidence that the answer to what causes asthma lies in a special type of natural &#34;killer&#34; cell. This finding means that physicians may not be treating asthma sufferers with the right kinds of drugs. For example, natural killer T cells seem to be resistant to the corticosteroids in widely used inhalers.<sup id="_ref-Harvard_cracks_asthma_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harvard_cracks_asthma" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Relief_medication" name="Relief_medication"></a><h2>Relief medication</h2>
<p>Symptomatic control of episodes of wheezing and shortness of breath is generally achieved with fast-acting <a href="/wiki/Bronchodilator" id="w">bronchodilators</a>. These are typically provided in pocket-sized, metered-dose <a href="/wiki/Inhaler" id="w">inhalers</a> (MDIs). In young sufferers, who may have difficulty with the coordination necessary to use inhalers, or those with a poor ability to hold their breath for 10 seconds after inhaler use (generally the elderly), an <a href="/wiki/Asthma_spacer" id="w">asthma spacer</a> (see top image) is used. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air in a simple tube, making it easier for patients to receive a full dose of the drug and allows for the active agent to be dispersed into smaller, more fully inhaled bits. A <a href="/wiki/Nebulizer" id="w">nebulizer</a> which provides a larger, continuous dose can also be used. Nebulizers work by vaporizing a dose of medication in a saline solution into a steady stream of foggy vapour, which the patient inhales continuously until the full dosage is administered. There is no clear evidence, however, that they are more effective than inhalers used with a spacer. Nebulizers may be helpful to some patients experiencing a severe attack. Such patients may not be able to inhale deeply, so regular inhalers may not deliver medication deeply into the lungs, even on repeated attempts. Since a nebulizer delivers the medication continuously, it is thought that the first few inhalations may relax the airways enough to allow the following inhalations to draw in more medication.  </p>
<p>Relievers include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Short-acting, selective <a href="/wiki/Beta2-adrenergic_receptor_agonist" id="w">beta&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;-adrenoceptor agonists</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Salbutamol" id="w">salbutamol</a> (<i>albuterol</i> <a href="/wiki/United_States_Adopted_Name" id="w">USAN</a>), <a href="/wiki/Levalbuterol" id="w">levalbuterol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Terbutaline" id="w">terbutaline</a> and  <a href="/wiki/Bitolterol" id="w">bitolterol</a>.<br/><a href="/wiki/Tremor" id="w">Tremors</a>, the major side effect, have been greatly reduced by inhaled delivery, which allows the drug to target the lungs specifically; oral and injected medications are delivered throughout the body. There may also be <a href="/wiki/Cardiac" id="w">cardiac</a> side effects at higher doses (due to Beta-1 agonist activity), such as elevated heart rate or blood pressure; with the advent of selective agents, these side effects have become less common. Patients must be cautioned against using these medicines too frequently, as with such use their efficacy may decline, producing <a href="/wiki/Desensitization" id="w">desensitization</a> resulting in an exacerbation of symptoms which may lead to refractory asthma and death.</li>
<li>Older, less selective <a href="/wiki/Adrenergic_receptor" id="w">adrenergic agonists</a>, such as inhaled <a href="/wiki/Epinephrine" id="w">epinephrine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ephedrine" id="w">ephedrine</a> tablets, have also been used.

<a id="Prevention_medication" name="Prevention_medication"></a><h2>Prevention medication</h2>
<p>Current treatment protocols recommend prevention medications such as an inhaled <a href="/wiki/Corticosteroid" id="w">corticosteroid</a>, which helps to suppress <a href="/wiki/Inflammation" id="w">inflammation</a> and reduces the swelling of the lining of the airways, in anyone who has frequent (greater than twice a week) need of relievers or who has severe symptoms. If symptoms persist, additional preventive drugs are added until the asthma is controlled. With the proper use of prevention drugs, asthmatics can avoid the complications that result from overuse of relief medications.</p>
<p>Asthmatics sometimes stop taking their preventive medication when they feel fine and have no problems breathing. This often results in further attacks, and no long-term improvement.</p>
<p>Preventive agents include the following.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Inhaled <a href="/wiki/Glucocorticoid" id="w">glucocorticoids</a> are the most widely used of the prevention medications and normally come as inhaler devices (<a href="/wiki/Ciclesonide" id="w">ciclesonide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beclomethasone" id="w">beclomethasone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Budesonide" id="w">budesonide</a>,  <a href="/wiki/Flunisolide" id="w">flunisolide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fluticasone" id="w">fluticasone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mometasone_furoate" id="w">mometasone</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Triamcinolone" id="w">triamcinolone</a>).<br/>Long-term use of corticosteroids can have many side effects including a redistribution of fat, increased <a href="/wiki/Appetite" id="w">appetite</a>, blood <a href="/wiki/Glucose" id="w">glucose</a> problems and weight gain. In particular high doses of steroids may cause <a href="/wiki/Osteoporosis" id="w">osteoporosis</a>. For this reasons inhaled steroids are generally used for prevention, as their smaller doses are targeted to the lungs unlike the higher doses of oral preparations. Nevertheless, patients on high doses of inhaled steroids may still require prophylactic treatment to prevent osteoporosis.<br/>Deposition of steroids in the mouth may cause a <a href="/wiki/Dysphonia" id="w">hoarse voice</a> or <a href="/wiki/Oral_thrush" id="w">oral thrush</a> (due to decreased immunity). This may be minimised by rinsing the mouth with water after inhaler use, as well as by using a <a href="/wiki/Asthma_spacer" id="w">spacer</a> which increases the amount of drug that reaches the lungs.</li>

<li>Methylxanthines (<a href="/wiki/Theophylline" id="w">theophylline</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aminophylline" id="w">aminophylline</a>), which are sometimes considered if sufficient control cannot be achieved with inhaled glucocorticoids and long-acting β-agonists alone.</li>

Long-acting bronchodilators (LABD) are similar in structure to short-acting selective beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists, but have much longer side chains resulting in a 12-hour effect, and are used to give a smoothed symptomatic relief (used morning and night). While patients report improved symptom control, these drugs do not replace the need for routine preventers, and their slow onset means the short-acting dilators may still be required. In November of 2005, the American <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" id="w">FDA</a> released a health advisory alerting the public to findings that show the use of long-acting β<sub>2</sub>-agonists could lead to a worsening of symptoms, and in some cases death.<sup id="_ref-FDA"LABD"_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FDA"LABD"" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>Currently available <a href="/wiki/Long_acting_beta-adrenoceptor_agonist" id="w">long-acting beta&#60;sub&#62;2&#60;/sub&#62;-adrenoceptor agonists</a> include <a href="/wiki/Salmeterol" id="w">salmeterol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Formoterol" id="w">formoterol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bambuterol" id="w">bambuterol</a>, and sustained-release oral <a href="/wiki/Albuterol" id="w">albuterol</a>. Combinations of inhaled steroids and long-acting bronchodilators are becoming more widespread; the most common combination currently in use is fluticasone/salmeterol (<a href="/wiki/Advair" id="w">Advair</a> in the United States, and <a href="/wiki/Seretide" id="w">Seretide</a> in the United Kingdom). Another combination is <a href="/wiki/Budesonide" id="w">budesonide</a>/<a href="/wiki/Formoterol" id="w">formoterol</a> which is commercially known as <a href="/wiki/Symbicort" id="w">symbicort</a>.</p>
<p>A recent meta-analysis of the roles of long-acting beta-agonists may indicate a danger to asthma patients. &#34;These agents can improve symptoms through bronchodilation at the same time as increasing underlying inflammation and bronchial hyper-responsiveness, thus worsening asthma control without any warning of increased symptoms,&#34; said Shelley Salpeter in a Cornell study. The study goes on to say that &#34;Three common asthma inhalers containing the drugs salmeterol or formoterol may be causing four out of five US asthma-related deaths per year and should be taken off the market&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Down_with_Serevent_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Down_with_Serevent" title="">[47]</a></sup> This assertion has drawn criticism from many asthma specialists for being inaccurate.  As Dr. Hal Nelson points out in a recent letter to the Annals of Internal Medicine,<br/><br/><i>&#34;Salpeter and colleagues also assert that salmeterol may be responsible for 4000 of the 5000 asthma-related deaths that occur in the United States annually. However, when salmeterol was introduced in 1994, more than 5000 asthma-related deaths occurred per year. Since the peak of asthma deaths in 1996, salmeterol sales have increased about 5-fold, while overall asthma mortality rates have decreased by about 25%, despite a continued increase in asthma diagnoses. In fact, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Health Statistics, U.S. asthma mortality rates peaked in 1996 (with 5667 deaths) and have decreased steadily since. The last available data, from 2004, indicate that 3780 deaths occurred. Thus, the suggestion that a vast majority of asthma deaths could be attributable to LABA use is inconsistent with the facts.&#34;</i></p>
<p>Dr. Salpeter has since tempered her comments regarding LABAs.{{Fact}}</p>

A similar review of <a href="/wiki/Air_ioniser" id="w">air ionisers</a> found no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.<sup id="_ref-blackhall_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blackhall" title="">[53]</a></sup>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Buteyko_method" id="w">Buteyko method</a>, a Russian therapy based on breathing exercises, has been investigated. A randomized, controlled trial of just 39 patients in 1998 showed a substantial reduction in the need for beta-agonists and a 50% reduction in the need for inhaled steroids. Quality of life scores improved significantly as people were less afraid of their condition and more confident of the future. Lung function remained the same despite the decrease in medication.<sup id="_ref-bowler_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bowler" title="">[59]</a></sup>

However, Buteyko has stated that the body has enough oxygen even during an asthmatic attack and to refuse oxygen if offered. This is simply not true. Tests plainly show that the oxygen level is extremely low during asthmatic attacks. The mainstream medical community regards the practice as extremely dangerous and it is frowned upon hugely.{{Fact}}

<p>In November 2007 <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">The New York Times</a></i> reported a review of more than 500 studies finding that independently backed studies on inhaled corticosteroids are up to four times more likely to find adverse effects than studies paid for by drug companies.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup>
<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Prognosis" name="Prognosis"></a><h1>Prognosis</h1>
<p>The prognosis for asthmatics is good; especially for children with mild disease. For asthmatics diagnosed during childhood, 54% will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade. The extent of permanent lung damage in asthmatics is unclear. Airway remodelling is observed, but it is unknown whether these represent harmful or beneficial changes.<sup id="_ref-Maddox_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Maddox" title="">[12]</a></sup> Although conclusions from studies are mixed, most studies show that early treatment with glucocorticoids prevents or ameliorates decline in lung function as measured by several parameters.<sup id="_ref-beckett_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beckett" title="">[67]</a></sup>
For those who continue to suffer from mild symptoms, corticosteroids can help most to live their lives with few <a href="/wiki/Disabilities" id="w">disabilities</a>. The mortality rate for asthma is low, with around 6000 deaths per year in a population of some 10 million patients in the United States.<sup id="_ref-McFadden_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McFadden" title="">[5]</a></sup>
Better control of the condition may help prevent some of these deaths.</p>

</p><a id="Epidemiology" name="Epidemiology"></a><h1>Epidemiology</h1>
<p>More than 6% of children in the United States have been diagnosed with asthma, a 75% increase in recent decades. The rate soars to 40% among some populations of urban children.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Asthma is usually diagnosed in childhood. The risk factors for asthma include:{{Facts}}
</p>
<ul>
<li>A personal or family <a href="/wiki/History" id="w">history</a> of asthma or <a href="/wiki/Atopy" id="w">atopy</a></li>
<li>Triggers (see <i><a href="/wiki/Asthma#Pathophysiology" id="w">Pathophysiology</a></i> above)</li>
<li>Premature birth or low birth weight</li>
<li>Viral <a href="/wiki/URTI" id="w">respiratory infection</a> in early childhood</li>
<li>Maternal smoking</li>
<li>Being male, for asthma in prepubertal children</li>
<li>Being female, for persistence of asthma into adulthood</li></ul>
<p>There is a reduced occurrence of asthma in people who were breast-fed as babies. Current research suggests that the <a href="/wiki/Prevalence" id="w">prevalence</a> of childhood asthma has been increasing. According to the <a href="/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention" id="w">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>&#39;s National Health Interview Surveys, some 9% of US children below 18 years of age had asthma in 2001, compared with just 3.6% in 1980 (see figure). The <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" id="w">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) reports that some 8% of the Swiss population suffers from asthma today, compared with just 2% some 25–30 years ago.<sup id="_ref-WHO_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WHO" title="">[68]</a></sup>
Although asthma is more common in affluent countries, it is by no means a problem restricted to the affluent; the WHO estimate that there are between 15 and 20 million asthmatics in India. In the U.S., urban residents, Hispanics, and African Americans are affected more than the population as a whole. Globally, asthma is responsible for around 180,000 deaths annually.<sup id="_ref-WHO_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WHO" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the remote South Atlantic island <a href="/wiki/Tristan_da_Cunha" id="w">Tristan da Cunha</a>, 50% of the population are asthmatics due to heredity transmission of a mutation in the gene CC16.{{Fact}}</p>
<a id="Socioeconomic_factors" name="Socioeconomic_factors"></a><h2>Socioeconomic factors</h2>
<p>The incidence of asthma is higher among low-income populations within a society (it is less common in <a href="/wiki/Developed_countries" id="w">developed countries</a> than <a href="/wiki/Developing_countries" id="w">developing countries</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/</a>), which in the western world are disproportionately ethnic minorities<sup id="_ref-AAAAAI_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AAAAAI" title="">[69]</a></sup>, and more likely to live near industrial areas.  Additionally, asthma has been strongly associated with the presence of cockroaches in living quarters, which is more likely in such neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Asthma incidence and quality of treatment varies among different racial groups, though this may be due to correlations with income (and thus affordability of health care) and geography. For example, Black Americans are less likely to receive outpatient treatment for asthma despite having a higher prevalence of the disease. They are much more likely to have emergency room visits or hospitalization for asthma, and are three times as likely to die from an asthma attack compared to whites.  The prevalence of &#34;severe persistent&#34; asthma is also greater in low-income communities compared with communities with better access to treatment.<sup id="_ref-NIH2004_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIH2004" title="">[70]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CDC2002_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CDC2002" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Asthma_and_athletics" name="Asthma_and_athletics"></a><h2>Asthma and athletics</h2>
<p>Asthma appears to be more prevalent in athletes than in the general population. One survey of participants in the 1996 <a href="/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games" id="w">Summer Olympic Games</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Atlanta%2C_Georgia" id="w">Atlanta, Georgia</a>, U.S., showed that 15% had been diagnosed with asthma, and that 10% were on asthma medication. <sup id="_ref-olympics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-olympics" title="">[72]</a></sup>
These statistics have been questioned on at least two bases. Athletes with mild asthma may be more likely to be diagnosed with the condition than non-athletes, because even subtle symptoms may interfere with their performance and lead to pursuit of a diagnosis. It has also been suggested that some professional athletes who do not suffer from asthma claim to do so in order to obtain special permits to use certain performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
<p>There appears to be a relatively high incidence of asthma in sports such as <a href="/wiki/Cycling" id="w">cycling</a>, mountain biking, and long-distance <a href="/wiki/Running" id="w">running</a>, and a relatively lower incidence in weightlifting and diving. It is unclear how much of these disparities are from the effects of training in the sport, and from self-selection of sports that may appear to minimize the triggering of asthma.<sup id="_ref-olympics_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-olympics" title="">[72]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-athletes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-athletes" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition, there exists a variant of asthma called <a href="/wiki/Exercise-induced_asthma" id="w">exercise-induced asthma</a> that shares many features with allergic asthma. It may occur either independently, or concurrent with the latter.  Exercise studies may be helpful in diagnosing and assessing this condition.</p>
