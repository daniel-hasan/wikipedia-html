<p>Astrid Kirchherr was born in 1938 in <a href="/wiki/Hamburg" id="w">Hamburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, and is the daughter of a former <a href="/wiki/Executive" id="w">executive</a> of the German branch of the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company" id="w">Ford Motor Company</a>. During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> she was evacuated to the safety of the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Sea" id="w">Baltic Sea</a>, where she remembered seeing dead bodies on the shore after the ships <a href="/wiki/Cap_Arcona" id="w">Cap Arcona</a> and the <a href="/wiki/SS_Deutschland_(1923)" id="w">SS Deutschland</a> had been bombed and sunk, and the destruction in Hamburg when she returned.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Following her father&#39;s death she was raised by her mother, Nielsa Kirchherr, in Eimsbütteler Strasse in the wealthy Hamburg suburb of <a href="/wiki/Altona%2C_Hamburg" id="w">Altona</a>.  </p>
<p>After her <a href="/wiki/Graduation" id="w">graduation</a> Kirchherr enrolled in the Meisterschule für Mode, Textil, Graphik und Werbung in Hamburg, as she wanted to study <a href="/wiki/Fashion_design" id="w">fashion design</a>, but demonstrated a talent for black-and-white photography.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Reinhard Wolf, the school&#39;s main photographic tutor, convinced her to switch courses and promised that he would hire her as his assistant when she graduated.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Kirchherr worked for Wolf as his assistant from 1959 until 1963.<sup id="_ref-Milesp64_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp64" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Astridwebpage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Astridwebpage" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the late 1950s and early &#39;60s Kirchherr and her art school friends were involved with the European <a href="/wiki/Existentialist" id="w">existentialist</a> movement, whose followers were nicknamed <a href="/wiki/Exy" id="w">Exies</a> by <a href="/wiki/John_Lennon" id="w">John Lennon</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp222_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp222" title="">[7]</a></sup> In 1995, she told <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radio_Merseyside" id="w">BBC Radio Merseyside</a>:{{cquote}}</p>

Kirchherr, Voormann, and Vollmer were friends who had all attended the Meisterschule, and shared the same ideas about fashion, culture and music. In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the <a href="/wiki/Reeperbahn" id="w">Reeperbahn</a> (in the St.Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the <a href="/wiki/Kaiserkeller" id="w">Kaiserkeller</a> club. Voormann walked in and watched a performance by a group called <a href="/wiki/The_Silver_Beetles" id="w">The Silver Beetles</a>.<sup id="_ref-KlausVoormannBio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KlausVoormannBio" title="">[8]</a></sup> Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer to listen to this new music, and after visiting the Kaiserkeller the next day, Kirchherr decided that all she wanted to do was to be as close to The Beatles as she could.<sup id="_ref-Milesp61_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp61" title="">[9]</a></sup> They had never heard this new music called <a href="/wiki/Rock_n%26%2339%3B_Roll" id="w">Rock n&#39; Roll</a> before, having previously only listened to <a href="/wiki/Trad_jazz" id="w">Trad jazz</a>, with some <a href="/wiki/Nat_King_Cole" id="w">Nat King Cole</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Platters" id="w">The Platters</a> mixed in.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp222_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp222" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Milesp62_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp62" title="">[10]</a></sup> The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night—arriving at 9 o&#39;clock and sitting by the front of the stage.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp221_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp221" title="">[11]</a></sup>  Kirchherr later said: {{cquote}}   </p>
<p>Kirchherr later said that her, Voormann, and Vollmer felt guilty about being German, and about Germany&#39;s recent history. Meeting The Beatles was something very special for her, although she knew that English people would think that she ate sauerkraut, and would comment on her heavy German accent, but they made jokes about it together.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Sutcliffe was fascinated by the trio, but especially Kirchherr, and thought they looked like &#34;real <a href="/wiki/Bohemian_style" id="w">bohemians</a>&#34;. <a href="/wiki/Bill_Harry" id="w">Bill Harry</a> later said that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way, and that she always captivated the whole room.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp222_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp222" title="">[7]</a></sup> Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her, and had tried to talk to Kirchherr during the next break, but she had already left the club. This was due to the strict German law at the time which prohibited young people from frequenting bars after 10 o&#39;clock at night.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp221_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp221" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>Sutcliffe managed to meet them eventually, and learned that all three had attended the Meisterschule, which was the same type of art college that Lennon and Sutcliffe had attended in Liverpool.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp222_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp222" title="">[7]</a></sup> Kirchherr asked The Beatles if they would mind letting her take photographs of them in a photo session, which impressed them, as other groups only had <a href="/wiki/Snapshot_(photography)" id="w">snapshots</a> that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs in a municipal park called &#34;der Dom&#34; which was close to the Reeperbahn, and in the afternoon she took them all (minus Best who decided not to go) to her mother&#39;s house in Altona.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp223_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp223" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD" title="">[14]</a></sup> Kirchherr&#39;s bedroom (which was all in black, including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch suspended from the ceiling) was decorated especially for Voormann, whom she had a relationship with, although after the visits to the Kaiserkeller their relationship became purely platonic. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained close friends with Voormann.<sup id="_ref-Milesp64_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp64" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Spitzp224_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp224" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>After meeting Kirchherr, Lennon filled his letters to <a href="/wiki/Cynthia_Lennon" id="w">Cynthia Powell</a> (his girlfriend at the time) with &#34;Astrid said this, Astrid did that&#34; which made Powell jealous, until she read that Sutcliffe was in a relationship with Kirchherr.<sup id="_ref-lennonp78_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lennonp78" title="">[16]</a></sup> When Powell visited Hamburg with Dot Rhone (<a href="/wiki/Paul_McCartney" id="w">Paul McCartney</a>&#39;s girlfriend at the time) in April 1961, they stayed at Kirchherr&#39;s house.<sup id="_ref-lennonp91_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lennonp91" title="">[17]</a></sup> In August 1963, Kirchherr met Lennon and Cynthia Lennon in Paris while they both there for a belated <a href="/wiki/Honeymoon" id="w">honeymoon</a>, as Kirchherr was there with a girlfriend for a few days holiday. The four of them went from wine bar to wine bar, and finally ended up back at Kirchherr&#39;s lodgings, where all four fell asleep on Kirchherr&#39;s single bed.<sup id="_ref-lennonp162-163_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lennonp162-163" title="">[18]</a></sup> The Beatles met Kirchherr again in Hamburg in 1966, when they were touring Germany. Kirchherr gave Lennon the letters he had written to Sutcliffe during 1961 and 1962, and Lennon said that it was, &#34;The best present I&#39;ve had in years&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp614_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp614" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

Stuart Sutcliffe wrote to friends that he was infatuated with Kirchherr, and asked her friends which colours, films, books and painters she liked, and who she fancied. Best commented that the beginning of their relationship was, &#34;like one of those fairy stories&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp225_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp225" title="">[20]</a></sup> Kirchherr and Sutcliffe got engaged in November 1960, and exchanged rings, as is the German custom.<sup id="_ref-Milesp65_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milesp65" title="">[21]</a></sup> Sutcliffe later wrote to his parents that he was engaged to Kirchherr, which they were shocked to learn, as they thought he would give up his career as an artist.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp235_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp235" title="">[22]</a></sup> Sutcliffe later borrowed money from Kirchherr for the airfare to fly back to Liverpool in February 1961, although he returned to Hamburg in March.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp230_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp230" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Spitzp242_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp242" title="">[24]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Kirchherr and Sutcliffe went to Liverpool in the summer of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe&#39;s family (and to see Liverpool) before their marriage. Everybody was expecting a strange <a href="/wiki/Beatnik" id="w">beatnik</a> artist from Hamburg, but Kirchherr turned up at the Sutcliffe&#39;s house in <a href="/wiki/Aigburth" id="w">Aigburth</a>, Liverpool, bearing a single long-stemmed <a href="/wiki/Orchid" id="w">orchid</a> in her hand as a present, and dressed in a round-necked <a href="/wiki/Cashmere_wool" id="w">cashmere</a> sweater and tailored skirt.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp278_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp278" title="">[25]</a></sup> In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed in the middle of an art class in Hamburg. He was suffering from intense headaches, and Kirchherr&#39;s mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, although they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches. While living at the Kirchherrs&#39; house in Hamburg his condition got worse. On <a href="/wiki/10_April" id="w">10 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a>, Sutcliffe was taken to a hospital—Kirchherr rode with him in the ambulance—but Sutcliffe died before the ambulance reached the hospital.<sup id="_ref-lennonp110_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lennonp110" title="">[26]</a></sup> Three days later Kirchherr met The Beatles at the Hamburg airport, and told them that Sutcliffe had died from a <a href="/wiki/Brain_haemorrhage" id="w">brain haemorrhage</a>.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp305_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp305" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Photography" name="Photography"></a><h2>Photography</h2>
<p>In 1964 Kirchherr became a <a href="/wiki/Freelance" id="w">freelance</a> photographer, and with her colleague Max Scheler she took &#34;behind the scenes&#34; photographs of The Beatles during the filming of &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/A_Hard_Day%26%2339%3Bs_Night_(film)" id="w">A Hard Day&#39;s Night</a></i>&#34;, as an assignment for the German STERN magazine.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Harrison later asked Kirchherr to arrange the cover of his <i><a href="/wiki/Wonderwall_Music" id="w">Wonderwall Music</a></i> album in 1969.<sup id="_ref-AstridonLife_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AstridonLife" title="">[29]</a></sup> Kirchherr and Scheler put an advertisement in the <i><a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Echo" id="w">Liverpool Echo</a></i> in 1964, stating that any group who wanted their photograph taken in front of <a href="/wiki/St._George%26%2339%3Bs_Hall%2C_Liverpool" id="w">St. George&#39;s Hall</a> would be paid £1 per musician, but over 200 groups turned up on the day, which meant Kirchherr and Scheler soon ran out of money.<sup id="_ref-InterviewBBCLiverpool_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-InterviewBBCLiverpool" title="">[30]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Kirchherr didn&#39;t publish the photographs until 1995, in a book called <i>Liverpool Days</i>, which is a limited edition collection of black-and-white photographs.<sup id="_ref-InterviewBBCLiverpool_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-InterviewBBCLiverpool" title="">[30]</a></sup> In 1999, a companion book called <i>Hamburg Days</i> was published (a two-volume limited edition) containing a set of photographs by Kirchherr and &#34;memory drawings&#34; by Voormann. The drawings are recollections of places and situations that Voormann clearly remembers, but Kirchherr had never photographed, or had lost the photographs.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kirchherr described how difficult it was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s:{{cquote}}</p>
<p>Kirchherr was quoted as saying that <i>When We Was Fab</i> (<a href="/wiki/Genesis_Publications" id="w">Genesis Publications</a> 2007) would be her last book of photographs:{{cquote}}     </p>
<p>Kirchherr has expressed respect for other photographers, such as <a href="/wiki/Annie_Leibovitz" id="w">Annie Leibovitz</a> (because of the humour in her work) <a href="/wiki/Irving_Penn" id="w">Irving Penn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Avedon" id="w">Richard Avedon</a>, Jim Rakete and Reinhard Wolf (German Wikipedia) and French film-makers <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut" id="w">François Truffaut</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jean_Cocteau" id="w">Jean Cocteau</a>.<sup id="_ref-Astridretrosellers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Astridretrosellers" title="">[33]</a></sup> Kirchherr said that her favourite photos are the ones she took of Sutcliffe by the Baltic sea, and of Lennon and George Harrison in her attic room at Eimsbütteler Strasse. She has expressed reservations about digital photography, saying that a photographer should concentrate on the art of photography and not on the technical results, although admitting that she knows nothing about computers, and is &#34;afraid of the internet&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Astridretrosellers_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Astridretrosellers" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kirchherr admits that she is not good at business as she is not organised enough, and has never really looked after the negatives of her photographs to prove ownership.<sup id="_ref-AstridonLife_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AstridonLife" title="">[29]</a></sup> Her business partner Ulf Krüger—a songwriter and record producer—successfully found many of Astrid&#39;s negatives and photographs and had them copyrighted, although he believes that Kirchherr has lost £500,000 over the years because of people using her photographs without permission.<sup id="_ref-AstridonLife_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AstridonLife" title="">[29]</a></sup> In July 2001 Kirchherr visited Liverpool to open an exhibition of her work at the <a href="/wiki/Mathew_Street" id="w">Mathew Street</a> art gallery, which is  close to the former site of the <a href="/wiki/Cavern_Club" id="w">Cavern Club</a>.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> She appeared as a guest at the city&#39;s Beatles&#39; Week Festival during the <a href="/wiki/August_Bank_Holiday" id="w">August Bank Holiday</a>.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> Kirchherr&#39;s work has been exhibited internationally in places such as, Hamburg, Bremen, London, Liverpool, New York City, Washington, D.C., Tokyo, Vienna, and at the Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Hall of Fame.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1967, Kirchherr married English drummer Gibson Kemp, who had replaced <a href="/wiki/Ringo_Starr" id="w">Ringo Starr</a> in <a href="/wiki/Rory_Storm_and_the_Hurricanes" id="w">Rory Storm and the Hurricanes</a>.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> The marriage ended in divorce after seven years.<sup id="_ref-Spitzp222_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spitzp222" title="">[7]</a></sup> Astrid subsequently married a German businessman, but they divorced in 1985.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Kirchherr worked as an advisor on the film <i><a href="/wiki/Backbeat_(film)" id="w">Backbeat</a></i>, which portrayed Kirchherr, Sutcliffe and The Beatles during their early days in Hamburg.<sup id="_ref-InterviewBBCLiverpool_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-InterviewBBCLiverpool" title="">[30]</a></sup> She was especially impressed with <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Dorff" id="w">Stephen Dorff</a> (who played Sutcliffe in the film) commenting that he was the right age (19-years-old at the time) 
and the way he smoked, talked and gestures were so like Sutcliffe&#39;s that she had <a href="/wiki/Goose_pimples" id="w">goose pimples</a>.
