<p>Flight SR-111 departed JFK at 20:18 (<a href="/wiki/Eastern_Daylight_Time" id="w">EDT</a>) with 215 passengers, 2 pilots and 12 flight attendants en route to <a href="/wiki/Geneva" id="w">Geneva</a>.</p>
<p>Delta sold the tickets of 53 of the Swissair passengers as part of a codeshare arrangement <sup id="_ref-FromEuropeAndNewYork_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FromEuropeAndNewYork" title="">[7]</a></sup>. Since <a href="/wiki/Air_Canada" id="w">Air Canada</a> was on strike at the time, some passengers who would have flown on Air Canada instead flew Swissair 111 <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At 22:10 <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Time" id="w">Atlantic Time</a>, cruising at <a href="/wiki/Flight_level" id="w">FL330</a>, or {{convert}}, the flight crew Captain Urs Zimmermann and First Officer Stephan Loew, smelled an odour in the cockpit and determined it to be smoke in the air conditioning system.  Four minutes later, the smoke was visible and the pilots began considering a diversion to a nearby airport for the purpose of a quick landing.  At 22:14 AT the flight crew made a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pan-pan" id="w">pan-pan</a>&#34; radio call, indicating that an emergency exists but there is no immediate danger to the aircraft, and requested a diversion to <a href="/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Boston</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Logan_International_Airport" id="w">Logan International Airport</a> (300 nautical miles away), but was instead directed to the closer <a href="/wiki/Halifax_International_Airport" id="w">Halifax International Airport</a> in <a href="/wiki/Enfield%2C_Nova_Scotia" id="w">Enfield, Nova Scotia</a>, 66 nm (104 km) away.  The crew then put on their oxygen masks and began descending.</p>
<p>At 22:19 AT the plane was 30 <a href="/wiki/Nautical_mile" id="w">nautical miles</a> away from Halifax airport, but required more time to descend from its current altitude of 21,000 feet.  At 22:20 AT the crew informed <a href="/wiki/Air_traffic_control" id="w">ATC</a> that it needed to dump fuel, and was subsequently diverted away from the airport. According to the <a href="/wiki/Checklist" id="w">checklist</a> <i>In case of smoke of unknown origin</i>, the crew shut-off the power supply in the cabin, which caused the recirculating fans to shut off. This induced the fire, by a vacuum phenomenon, to spread back into the cockpit. At 22:24 AT, the crew declared an emergency. Aircraft systems, such as lighting, flight instruments, and the autopilot began to fail and as a result the crew slowly lost any means of successfully flying the aircraft. According to readings from <a href="/wiki/Seismometer" id="w">seismographic recorders</a> in <a href="/wiki/Halifax_Regional_Municipality" id="w">Halifax</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moncton" id="w">Moncton</a>, the aircraft struck the ocean at 22:31 AT.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> The crash location was approximately {{coor at dms}}, with 300 metres&#39; uncertainty.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Recovery_and_investigation" name="Recovery_and_investigation"></a><h1>Recovery and investigation</h1>

<p>The aircraft broke apart on impact with the water, and most of the debris sank to the ocean floor (a depth of 55 m or 180 ft). Some debris was found floating in the crash area, and over the following weeks debris washed up on the nearby shorelines.<sup id="_ref-recovery_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-recovery" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The initial focus of the recovery was on finding and identifying human remains, and finding the <a href="/wiki/Flight_recorder" id="w">flight recorders</a>, but this proved difficult as the force of impact was &#34;in the order of at least 350 <a href="/wiki/G-force" id="w">&#39;&#39;g&#39;&#39;</a>,&#34;
<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> 
and the environmental conditions, only allowed recovery along with wreckage.
<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> 
Only one of the victims was visually identifiable. 147 were identified by fingerprint, dental records, and X-ray comparisons. The remaining 81 were identified through DNA tests.

The survey and recovery, dubbed <i>Operation Persistence</i> was TSB guided with resources from the military, CCG, RCMP, and many others.  The area was surveyed using route survey sonar, laser line scanners, and <a href="/wiki/Remotely__operated_vehicle" id="w">remotely  operated vehicles</a> to locate items, then recovered (initially by divers and ROV&#39;s, later by dredging and trawling).<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_2" id="w">October 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a> the <a href="/wiki/Transportation_Safety_Board_of_Canada" id="w">Transportation Safety Board of Canada</a> (TSB) initiated a heavy lift operation to retrieve the major portion of the wreckage from the deep water before the expected winter storms began. By <a href="/wiki/October_21" id="w">October 21</a>, 27% of the wreckage was recovered.
<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>At this point in the investigation, the cause of the crash was generally believed to be due to faulty wiring in the cockpit, after the entertainment system in the plane started to overheat. Certain groups issued Aviation Safety Recommendations. The TSB released its preliminary report <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a>, but the final report was not completed until 2003.

An estimated 2 million pieces of debris were recovered and brought ashore for inspection at a secure handling facility in a marine industrial park at <a href="/wiki/Sheet_Harbour%2C_Nova_Scotia" id="w">Sheet Harbour</a> where small material was hand inspected by teams of RCMP officers looking for human remains, personal effects and valuables from the aircraft&#39;s cargo hold.  The material was then transported to <a href="/wiki/CFB_Shearwater" id="w">CFB Shearwater</a> where it was assembled and inspected by over 350 investigators from multiple organizations such as TSB, <a href="/wiki/NTSB" id="w">NTSB</a>, <a href="/wiki/FAA" id="w">FAA</a>, <a href="/wiki/AAIB" id="w">AAIB</a>, <a href="/wiki/Boeing_Commercial_Airplanes" id="w">Boeing</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pratt_%26amp%3B_Whitney" id="w">Pratt &#38; Whitney</a>.

<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>As each piece of wreckage was brought in, it was carefully cleaned with freshwater, sorted, and weighed. The item was then placed in a specific area of a Hangar at CFB Shearwater, based on a grid system representing the various sections of the plane. All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was then weighed and moved to a custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the item was documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination hangar.
<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks. </p>
<a id="Cockpit" name="Cockpit"></a><h4>Cockpit</h4>
<p>The front 10m (33 feet) of the aircraft, from the front of the cockpit to near the front of the first-class passenger cabin, was reconstructed. Information gained by this allowed investigators to determine the severity and limits of the fire damage, its possible origins and progression.

<a id="TSB_Findings" name="TSB_Findings"></a><h2>TSB Findings</h2>
<p>The investigation identified eleven causes and contributing factors of the crash in their final report. The first and most important was:</p>
<p /><blockquote>
<p>Aircraft certification standards for material flammability were inadequate in that they allowed the use of materials that could be ignited and sustain or propagate fire. Consequently, flammable material propagated a fire that started above the ceiling on the right side of the cockpit near the cockpit rear wall. The fire spread and intensified rapidly to the extent that it degraded aircraft systems and the cockpit environment, and ultimately led to the loss of control of the aircraft.<sup id="_ref-TSB3.1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSB3.1" title="">[28]</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="/wiki/Electric_arc" id="w">Arcing</a> from wiring of the <a href="/wiki/In-flight_entertainment" id="w">in-flight entertainment</a> system network did not trip the <a href="/wiki/Circuit_breaker" id="w">circuit breakers</a>. While suggestive, the investigation was unable to confirm if it was this arc that ignited the flammable covering on insulation blankets that quickly spread across other flammable materials.<sup id="_ref-TSB3.1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSB3.1" title="">[28]</a></sup> The crew did not recognize that a fire had started and were not warned by instruments. Once they became aware of the fire, the uncertainty of the problem made it difficult to address. The rapid spread of the fire led to the failure of key display systems, and the crew&#39;s ability to control the aircraft was soon overcome. Because he had no light by which to see his controls after the displays failed, the pilot was forced to steer the plane blindly; as a result, the plane swerved off course and headed back out into the Atlantic. Recovered fragments of the plane show that the heat inside the cockpit became so great that the ceiling started to melt.</p>
<p>The recovered <a href="/wiki/Attitude_indicator" id="w">standby attitude indicator</a> and <a href="/wiki/Airspeed_indicator" id="w">airspeed indicator</a> showed that the aircraft struck the water at 300 <a href="/wiki/Knot_(speed)" id="w">knots</a> in a 20 degrees nose down and 110 degree bank turn, or almost upside down.
<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> 
Upon impact, in less than a second, the plane would have been crushed, killing all aboard almost instantly.</p>
<p>The TSB concluded that even if they had been aware of the nature of the problem, the rate of spread of the fire would have precluded a safe landing at Halifax even if an approach had begun as soon as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pan-pan" id="w">pan-pan</a>&#34; was declared.</p>
<a id="TSB_Recommendations" name="TSB_Recommendations"></a><h2>TSB Recommendations</h2>
<p>The TSB made nine recommendations relating to changes in aircraft materials (testing, certification, inspection and maintenance), electrical systems, and flight data capture. (Both flight recorders stopped when they lost power six minutes before impact.) General recommendations were also made regarding improvements in checklists and in fire-detection and fire-fighting equipment and training.  These recommendations have led to widespread changes in FAA standards, principally impacting wiring and fire hardening.</p>
<p>The lack of flight recorder data for the last six minutes of the flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was a major factor in its duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the last six minutes of flight entirely from the physical evidence. The plane was broken into millions of small pieces by the impact, making this process time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the longest (five years) and most expensive (57 million CAD) transport accident investigation in Canadian history.</p>

Two memorials to the victims have been established by the government of Nova Scotia. One is located east of the crash site at The Whalesback, a <a href="/wiki/Headlands_and_bays" id="w">promontory</a> 1&#160;km north of <a href="/wiki/Peggys_Cove%2C_Nova_Scotia" id="w">Peggys Cove</a>. The second memorial is a more private but much larger commemoration located west of the crash site near Bayswater Beach Provincial Park on the <a href="/wiki/Aspotogan_Peninsula" id="w">Aspotogan Peninsula</a>. Here, the unidentified remains of the victims are interred.</p>
<p>In September 1999 Swissair and <a href="/wiki/Boeing" id="w">Boeing</a> offered the families of the passengers full compensatory damages. This was rejected in favor of a $19.8 billion suit against Swissair and <a href="/wiki/DuPont" id="w">DuPont</a>, the supplier of <a href="/wiki/Mylar" id="w">Mylar</a> insulation sheathing. A US federal court rejected the claim in February 2002.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>A number of notable individuals died in this accident, including <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Mann" id="w">Jonathan Mann</a>, former head of the <a href="/wiki/WHO" id="w">WHO</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/AIDS" id="w">AIDS</a> program; Mann&#39;s wife,  AIDS researcher Mary-Lou Clements-Mann; Pierce J. Gerety Jr., <a href="/wiki/UNHCR" id="w">UNHCR</a> Director of  Operations for the <a href="/wiki/Great_Lakes_Region_of_Africa" id="w">Great Lakes Region of Africa</a>, who was on a special mission for U.N.

<p>After the crash, the flight route designator for Swissair&#39;s New York-Geneva route was changed to Flight 139.</p>
<p>Since the crash there have been many television documentaries on Flight 111, including episodes of disaster shows like <a href="/wiki/History_Channel" id="w">History Channel</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Disasters_of_the_Century" id="w">Disasters of the Century</a>, <a href="/wiki/National_Geographic" id="w">National Geographic</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Air_Crash_Investigation" id="w">Air Crash Investigation</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Service" id="w">PBS&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/NOVA_(TV_series)" id="w">NOVA</a></i> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/aircrash/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/aircrash/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/aircrash/</a>. <i>NOVA</i> created a classroom activity kit for teachers at schools using the crash as an example of an airplane crash investigation <a class="externallink" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/pdf/3105_aircrash.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/pdf/3105_aircrash.pdf">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/pdf/3105_aircrash.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>In May 2007 the TSB released copies of the audio recordings of the air traffic control transmissions associated with the flight. One of the pilots was reported to have spoken in a heavy Swiss-German accent.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> The transcripts of these recordings had been released in 1998 (within days of the crash), but the TSB had refused to release the audio on privacy grounds. The TSB argued that under Canada&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Access_to_Information_Act" id="w">Access to Information Act</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Privacy_Act_(Canada)" id="w">Privacy Act</a></i>, the audio recordings constituted personal information and were thus not disclosable. Canada&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Appeal_(Canada)" id="w">Federal Court of Appeal</a> rejected this argument in 2006, in a legal proceeding concerned with air traffic control recordings in four other air accidents.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada" id="w">Supreme Court of Canada</a> did not grant leave to appeal that decision, and consequently the TSB released a copy of the Swissair 111 air traffic control audio recordings to <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Press" id="w">Canadian Press</a>, which had requested them under the <i><a href="/wiki/Access_to_Information_Act" id="w">Access to Information Act</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> Several key minutes of the air traffic control audio can be found on the <i><a href="/wiki/Toronto_Star" id="w">Toronto Star</a></i> web site.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
