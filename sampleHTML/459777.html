<b>DevilDriver</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Death_metal" id="w">death metal</a>-influenced <a href="/wiki/Groove_metal" id="w">groove metal</a> band from <a href="/wiki/Santa_Barbara%2C_California" id="w">Santa Barbara</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>. <a href="/wiki/Coal_Chamber" id="w">Coal Chamber</a> vocalist <a href="/wiki/Dez_Fafara" id="w">Dez Fafara</a> was not happy with the direction Coal Chamber was going in musically, and met musicians who had a similar music interest at a barbecue and bar. Fafara, guitarists <a href="/wiki/Evan_Pitts" id="w">Evan Pitts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Kendrick" id="w">Jeff Kendrick</a>, bassist <a href="/wiki/Jon_Miller_(guitarist)" id="w">Jon Miller</a>, and then-guitarist <a href="/wiki/John_Boecklin" id="w">John Boecklin</a> formed Deathride. Due to copyright issues and the name being taken by several bands, Deathride changed its name to DevilDriver, which refers to bells Italian witches used to drive evil forces away.</p>
<p>The band&#39;s <a href="/wiki/DevilDriver_(album)" id="w">self-titled</a> album was not well received by some music critics. The primary writer of the album, Pitts, left the band and was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Mike_Spreitzer" id="w">Mike Spreitzer</a>.

<p>At the age of 15, <a href="/wiki/Bassist" id="w">bassist</a> <a href="/wiki/Jon_Miller_(bassist)" id="w">Jon Miller</a> had formed a band with drummer <a href="/wiki/John_Boecklin" id="w">John Boecklin</a> and guitarist <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Kendrick" id="w">Jeff Kendrick</a> in high school. The band was called Area-51 and played <a href="/wiki/Cover_versions" id="w">cover versions</a> of <a href="/wiki/Metallica" id="w">Metallica</a>, <a href="/wiki/Slayer" id="w">Slayer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sepultura" id="w">Sepultura</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pantera" id="w">Pantera</a>.<sup id="_ref-DevilDriver interview with Jon Miller_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DevilDriver interview with Jon Miller" title="">[1]</a></sup> Miller, Boecklin and Kendrick met <a href="/wiki/Coal_Chamber" id="w">Coal Chamber</a> vocalist <a href="/wiki/Dez_Fafara" id="w">Dez Fafara</a> while he was in the process of recording the album <i><a href="/wiki/Dark_Days" id="w">Dark Days</a></i> with Coal Chamber in 2002. The three were playing in a local band and talked to Fafara who said he was thinking about leaving Coal Chamber. Fafara said &#34;Hey you guys write some heavy shit, and I want to get out of Coal Chamber&#34;.<sup id="_ref-DevilDriver: Interview with Jon Miller_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DevilDriver: Interview with Jon Miller" title="">[2]</a></sup> Fafara hosted several barbecues after moving from <a href="/wiki/Orange_County" id="w">Orange County</a> to Santa Barbara and would <a href="/wiki/Jam_(music)" id="w">jam</a> with musicians he met, which lead to the formation of the band.<sup id="_ref-BZ_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BZ" title="">[3]</a></sup> Guitarist <a href="/wiki/Evan_Pitts" id="w">Evan Pitts</a> met Fafara in a restaurant and gave him his phone number for a jam session, while John Boecklin who originally played guitar then played drums, met Fafara at a bar.<sup id="_ref-DevilDriver is the new creation of Dez Fafara_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DevilDriver is the new creation of Dez Fafara" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The band was originally known as Deathride, which was changed as Fafara felt there were too many bands with that name; a band in Norfolk, Virginia, and a bicycle racing team.<sup id="_ref-Interview with Dez Farfara of DevilDriver_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview with Dez Farfara of DevilDriver" title="">[5]</a></sup> Another problem was that the band&#39;s label, <a href="/wiki/Roadrunner_Records" id="w">Roadrunner Records</a> were unable to secure copyright.<sup id="_ref-Interview with DevilDriver_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Interview with DevilDriver" title="">[6]</a></sup> The members compiled a list of roughly two hundred names to go for a more original approach. Fafara&#39;s wife had a book by Italian witchcraft author <a href="/wiki/Raven_Grimassi" id="w">Raven Grimassi</a> on <a href="/wiki/Stregheria" id="w">Stregheria</a>, and came across the term &#39;devil driver&#39;. The term &#39;devil driver&#39; refers to bells Italian witches used to drive evil forces away. Fafara thought it was appropriate because it sounded &#34;evil&#34;, and thought the term &#34;suits his life&#34;.<sup id="_ref-TARTAREAN DESIRE WEBZINE_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TARTAREAN DESIRE WEBZINE" title="">[7]</a></sup> The band&#39;s logo is the Cross of Confusion, which has existed for thousands of years and refers to &#34;question religion, question authority, question everything around you&#34;.
