<p>The <b>Mark Twain House</b> was the home of <a href="/wiki/Mark_Twain" id="w">Mark Twain</a> (a.k.a. Samuel Langhorne Clemens) from <a href="/wiki/1871" id="w">1871</a> to <a href="/wiki/1891" id="w">1891</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hartford%2C_Connecticut" id="w">Hartford, Connecticut</a>, <a href="/wiki/USA" id="w">USA</a>. Before 1871, Twain had lived in <a href="/wiki/Hannibal%2C_Missouri" id="w">Hannibal, Missouri</a>. The architectural style of the 19-room house itself is <a href="/wiki/Victorian_Gothic" id="w">Victorian Gothic</a>.</p>
<p>The house is also notable for the major works written during his residency, including <i><a href="/wiki/The_Gilded_Age:_A_Tale_of_Today" id="w">The Gilded Age</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer" id="w">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Prince_and_the_Pauper" id="w">The Prince and the Pauper</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Life_on_the_Mississippi" id="w">Life on the Mississippi</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn" id="w">Huckleberry Finn</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/A_Tramp_Abroad" id="w">A Tramp Abroad</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur%26%2339%3Bs_Court" id="w">A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#39;s Court</a></i>. </p>
<p>Bad financial investments caused the Twain family to move to Europe. When they returned to Connecticut in 1900 he lived in a house built for him in Stormfield, Connecticut, where he died on <a href="/wiki/April_21" id="w">April 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1910" id="w">1910</a>. It functioned as a school, an apartment building, and a library after that.  In 1962 it was declared a <a href="/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark" id="w">National Historic Landmark</a>.<sup id="_ref-nhlsum_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nhlsum" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-nrhpinv2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nrhpinv2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Since 1974 it has had a multi-million dollar renovation and an expansion dedicated to showcasing his life and work.</p>

</p><a id="Life_in_the_house" name="Life_in_the_house"></a><h1> Life in the house </h1>
<p>Mark Twain moved to Hartford in 1871 and purchased the property for his new house in north Hartford. He did so to be closer to his publisher, American Publishing Company.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> When the house was being built, the Hartford <i>Daily Times</i> noted, &#34;The novelty displayed in the architecture of the building, the oddity of its internal arrangement and the fame of its owner will all conspire to make it a house of note for a long time to come.&#34;<sup id="_ref-NYT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT" title="">[4]</a></sup> The total cost of the house was $40,000, paid out of Mrs. Clemens&#39; inheritance.<sup id="_ref-NYT_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT" title="">[4]</a></sup> While in Connecticut, the family remarked &#34;[the house] had a heart, and a soul, and eyes to see us with.&#34; </p>
<p>The house was built on 3.5 acres of land and designed with seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a carriage house, and plant-filled <a href="/wiki/Conservatory_(greenhouse)" id="w">conservatory</a>. <a href="/wiki/Bay_window" id="w">Bay windows</a> extend up to form <a href="/wiki/Turret" id="w">turrets</a> that were topped with porches, allowing Twain and guests a view of what was a very pastoral area of Hartford.</p>
<p>The top floor was the <a href="/wiki/Billiards" id="w">billiards</a> room and his private study, where Twain would write late at night; the room was strictly off limits to all but the cleaning staff. It was also used for entertaining male guests with cigars and liquor. Twain had said &#34;There ought to be a room in this house to swear in&#34; and &#34;It&#39;s dangerous to have to repress an emotion like that.&#34;</p>
<p>The children had their own area, with a nursery and a playroom/classroom. And Twain played with his children in the conservatory, pretending to be an elephant in an imaginary <a href="/wiki/Safari" id="w">safari</a>. Twain noted the house &#34;was of us, and we were in its confidence and lived in its grace and in the peace of its benediction.&#34;<sup id="_ref-GAM_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GAM" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Twain loved living in the house, partly because he knew many different authors from his Hartford neighborhood, such as <a href="/wiki/Harriet_Beecher_Stowe" id="w">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a> who lived next door and <a href="/wiki/Isabella_Beecher_Hooker" id="w">Isabella Beecher Hooker</a>.<sup id="_ref-NYT_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT" title="">[4]</a></sup> Also, he would stop in to visit his friend, actor <a href="/wiki/William_Gillette" id="w">William Gillette</a> at Gillette Castle (today <a href="/wiki/Gillette_Castle_State_Park" id="w">Gillette Castle State Park</a>).</p>
<p>In 1881, with the success of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>, Twain had <a href="/wiki/Louis_Comfort_Tiffany" id="w">Louis Comfort Tiffany</a> supervise the interior decoration of the house.<sup id="_ref-HGTV_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HGTV" title="">[6]</a></sup> Twain was also fascinated with new technologies, leading to the installation of an early <a href="/wiki/Telephone" id="w">telephone</a> in the entrance hall.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> In that same year, Twain formed the firm Charles L. Webster &#38; Company, which published Twain&#39;s writings along with <a href="/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant" id="w">Ulysses S. Grant</a>&#39;s memoirs.<sup id="_ref-Hannibal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hannibal" title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>

</a>

The company went bankrupt in 1894 because of the automated typesetting machine, leaving Twain with a large amount of debt.<sup id="_ref-Hannibal_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hannibal" title="">[8]</a></sup> After enduring several bank panics and losses from investments in a typesetting machine, the Twains moved to Europe in 1891 where living was cheaper.<sup id="_ref-NYT_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Twain began lecturing across the continent to recoup some money for their family, but tragedy prevented their return to the house. In 1893 Twain&#39;s publishing company went bankrupt, Susy Clemens died of <a href="/wiki/Meningitis" id="w">meningitis</a> in 1896 after a visit to Hartford, and Olivia refused to ever visit the house again.<sup id="_ref-GAM_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GAM" title="">[5]</a></sup> In 1903 the house was sold.<sup id="_ref-NYT_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Post-Twain" name="Post-Twain"></a><h1> Post-Twain </h1>
<p>In 1905 the house was significantly repaired, but it was also significantly altered, deviating from its original design. This was known to have caused marked uproar among the northeastern Missouri intelligentsia. The chimneys and brick work were also altered. The house was used as a private home, a boys&#39; school, and an apartment building.</p>
<p>In 1929, a group of preservationists &#8212; the Friends of Hartford &#8212; formed the Mark Twain Memorial and Library Commission and purchased the building to prevent its demolition and rented the ground floor to meet expenses. During this period, doors were added to the building, further deviating from the original design. The house was restored in the 1950s and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1963.<sup id="_ref-NYT_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The house was opened as a museum in the 1960s. The process of paying off the mortgage, raising money to restore the deteriorating property, and retrieving artifacts, furnishings, and personal possessions took many decades and ended in 1974, just in time for the 100th anniversary of the house.<sup id="_ref-NYT_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT" title="">[4]</a></sup> The house earned the David E. Finley Award in 1977 for &#34;exemplary restoration&#34; from the <a href="/wiki/National_Trust_for_Historic_Preservation" id="w">National Trust for Historic Preservation</a>.<sup id="_ref-restoration_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-restoration" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>

Restoration and preservation at the Mark Twain House helped bring the house and grounds back to the years between 1881 and 1891, when the Twains most loved the house. The marble floor in the front hallway underwent a historic restoration, and specialists re-stenciled and painted the walls and ceilings and refinishing the woodwork to recover the Tiffany-decorated interiors. Restoration was funded in part by two federal <a href="/wiki/Save_America%E2%80%99s_Treasures" id="w">Save America’s Treasures</a> grants totaling $3 million. Scanning computers were also used in the restoration.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The home today contains 50,000 artifacts; manuscripts, historic photographs, family furnishings, and <a href="/wiki/Louis_Comfort_Tiffany" id="w">Tiffany Glass</a>. Many of the original furnishings, including Twain&#39;s ornate <a href="/wiki/Venice" id="w">Venetian</a> bed, an intricately carved mantel from a Scottish castle, and a billiard table, remain at the house.</p>
<p>With the number of admissions leveling off around 53,000, the house&#39;s trustees decided that they must expand or be forced to shrink their operations. They commissioned <a href="/wiki/Robert_A._M._Stern" id="w">Robert A. M. Stern</a>, the founder of the Manhattan architectural firm that bears his name and the dean of the <a href="/wiki/Yale_School_of_Architecture" id="w">Yale School of Architecture</a>, to design a visitor&#39;s center that would not draw attention away from the house.<sup id="_ref-NYT_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Education and Visitors Center was built adjacent to Twain’s Carriage House. The center is a $16.3 million, 35,000-square-foot facility that will house artifacts from the museum’s collection that cannot now be shown in the House itself. It contains a lecture hall and classroom facilities.<sup id="_ref-HGTV_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HGTV" title="">[6]</a></sup> The house will receive $1 million from the state government to meet expenses related to the construction of the museum and restoration of the house. Since the museum opened in November 2003, attendance has increased by 15%.<sup id="_ref-State money_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-State money" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The house generates $5 million in tourism from 50,000 visitors.<sup id="_ref-Fed money_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fed money" title="">[12]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Aetna" id="w">Aetna</a> foundation gave $500,000 to the campaign.<sup id="_ref-Aetna_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Aetna" title="">[13]</a></sup>  The National Endowment for the Humanities also granted $800,000 in challenge grants for teacher development programs, a student writing contest, and an educational website.<sup id="_ref-humanities money_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-humanities money" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
