<b><i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i></b>, also known as <b><i>Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark</i></b>, is a <a href="/wiki/1981_in_film" id="w">1981</a> <a href="/wiki/Adventure_film" id="w">adventure film</a> directed by <a href="/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" id="w">Steven Spielberg</a>, produced by <a href="/wiki/George_Lucas" id="w">George Lucas</a> and starring <a href="/wiki/Harrison_Ford" id="w">Harrison Ford</a>. It is the first in the <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Jones" id="w">Indiana Jones</a> film and television series, and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_appearances" id="w">the twenty-fourth in internal chronology</a>. In the film, the <a href="/wiki/Nazis" id="w">Nazis</a> are searching for the lost <a href="/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant" id="w">Ark of the Covenant</a> to make their army invincible, as it did for the Israelites of the Old Testament, and it is up to <a href="/wiki/Archaeology" id="w">archaeologist</a> and adventurer Indiana Jones to find it first. </p>
<p>When released on <a href="/wiki/June_12" id="w">June 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1981" id="w">1981</a>, the $20 million (USD) film was a huge success, easily the highest grossing film of 1981, earning $384 million worldwide, and, at the time, one of the highest-grossing movies ever made. It was nominated for eight <a href="/wiki/Academy_Awards" id="w">Academy Awards</a>, including Best Picture, in 1982 and won four (Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration). The film was a hit with audiences and critics alike leading to two more films, <i><a href="/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom" id="w">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade" id="w">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Young_Indiana_Jones_Chronicles" id="w">The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</a></i> television series, and a fourth film, <i><a href="/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Kingdom_of_the_Crystal_Skull" id="w">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a></i>, in production for release in <a href="/wiki/2008" id="w">2008</a>.</p>
<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h1>Plot</h1>
<p>In 1936, in the <a href="/wiki/Peru" id="w">Peruvian</a> <a href="/wiki/Jungle" id="w">jungle</a>, archaeologist/treasure hunter Indiana Jones braves several booby traps to retrieve a golden idol from an ancient temple. After escaping, he finds rival archaeologist <a href="/wiki/Rene_Belloq" id="w">Rene Belloq</a> waiting outside with a group of Hovitos, the local natives. Surrounded and outnumbered, Jones is forced to give up the artifact to Belloq. Jones manages to escape from Belloq and the Hovitos by flying away on a waiting <a href="/wiki/Seaplane" id="w">seaplane</a>. <div style="wigth:250px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:250px-Indianagrabsidol.jpg" title="Indiana Jones attempts to take the idol in the opening of the film."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/250px-Indianagrabsidol.jpg" alt="Indiana Jones attempts to take the idol in the opening of the film." title="Indiana Jones attempts to take the idol in the opening of the film." class="location-left type-thumb" width="250px" />

</p>
<p>At the American college where he teaches archaeology, Jones meets with two Army intelligence agents. They explain that the <a href="/wiki/Nazi" id="w">Nazis</a>, in their quest to gain occult power, are searching for Abner Ravenwood, Jones’s former mentor. Ravenwood is the foremost expert on the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">ancient Egyptian</a> city of <a href="/wiki/Tanis%2C_Egypt" id="w">Tanis</a>, which has been rediscovered by the Nazis and is believed to be the location of the <a href="/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant" id="w">Ark of the Covenant</a>, a chest the Israelites built to hold the <a href="/wiki/Ten_Commandments" id="w">Ten Commandments</a>. Jones surmises that the Nazis seek Ravenwood because he possesses the headpiece to the Staff of Ra, a key artifact which is essential in pinpointing the Ark’s resting place. His colleague <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Brody" id="w">Marcus Brody</a> explains that, according to legend, the power of the Ark can make any army invincible.</p>
<p>Jones flies to <a href="/wiki/Nepal" id="w">Nepal</a>, only to find that Ravenwood has died; his daughter <a href="/wiki/Marion_Ravenwood" id="w">Marion</a>, Jones&#39;s embittered former lover, has the headpiece, which she wears as a medallion. As a result of a gunfight between Jones and a sadistic <a href="/wiki/Nazi" id="w">Nazi</a> agent named <a href="/wiki/Toht" id="w">Toht</a>, Marion&#39;s tavern is burned down. Toht&#39;s hand is scarred with the face of the medallion, whereas Jones ends up in possession of both the headpiece and Marion, who decides to travel with him. The two fly to <a href="/wiki/Cairo" id="w">Cairo</a> and meet up with <a href="/wiki/Sallah" id="w">Sallah</a>, a skilled Egyptian digger, who says that he knows where the Nazis, with the assistance of Belloq, are digging for the Ark. Nazi operatives kidnap Marion and fake her death in front of Jones. That evening, Sallah and Jones decipher the carvings on the headpiece. Based on their translation, they realize the Nazis used the wrong length for the Staff of <a href="/wiki/Ra" id="w">Ra</a>, and are digging in the wrong place.

<div class="thumbcaption">Indiana and Sallah lift up the Ark of the Covenant</div></div>

Infiltrating the dig, Indy sneaks into the map room, which contains a complete to-scale model of the city of Tanis. According to legend, the headpiece would reveal the exact location of the <a href="/wiki/Well_of_Souls" id="w">Well of Souls</a>, the actual chamber containing the Ark, by focusing daylight onto the city mock-up at a certain time of day. Although Sallah is nearly exposed and captured in the attempt, Indy successfully acquires the location. He and Sallah gather a small crew and begin to dig at the correct location. After several hours, they break through the roof of the buried Well of Souls. Jones is lowered to the floor of the temple and finds it infested with multitudes of poisonious snakes, of which he is deathly afraid. After he and Sallah hoist the Ark out of the temple, Belloq and the Nazis appear and take control of the Ark. Marion is tossed into the Well with Jones, and they are sealed in. The duo manage to escape, emerging aboveground in time to find a <a href="/wiki/Luftwaffe" id="w">Luftwaffe</a> <a href="/wiki/Flying_wing" id="w">flying wing</a> being prepared to transport the Ark to <a href="/wiki/Berlin" id="w">Berlin</a>. They accidentally blow up the plane, therefore the Ark is put on a <a href="/wiki/Truck" id="w">truck</a> to Cairo, where it will be shipped to Berlin. Stealing a <a href="/wiki/Horse" id="w">horse</a>, Jones pursues the convoy escorting the truck, seizes control of the vehicle, and, after an extended pursuit, escapes with the Ark. That evening, Jones and Marion leave Sallah to escort the Ark to <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> onboard the <a href="/wiki/Tramp_steamer" id="w">tramp steamer</a> <i>Bantu Wind</i>.</p>
<p>The next morning, a Nazi <a href="/wiki/U-boat" id="w">U-boat</a> commanded by Belloq and Nazi officer Dietrich stops the ship. Marion and the Ark are removed, while Jones covertly boards the U-boat. He follows Belloq and the Ark to an isolated island, where they plan to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to the Führer. Threatening to destroy the Ark with a rocket launcher, Jones demands that the Nazis free Marion. Belloq calls his bluff, claiming that Indy, as an archaeologist, wants to see it opened as badly as Belloq; Jones is forced to surrender. Marion and Jones are tied up while Belloq and the Nazis perform a ceremonial opening of the Ark. Spirits emerge from within; Jones, aware of the supernatural danger of looking at the open Ark, warns Marion to close her eyes. The group of Nazis, who do not look away, are destroyed in the Ark&#39;s awesome display, and the Ark closes itself once more with a crack of thunder. Back in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>, the two Army intelligence men tell a suspicious Jones that &#34;top men&#34; are carefully studying the Ark. In reality, the artifact is sealed in a wooden crate and stored in a giant <a href="/wiki/Government_Warehouse" id="w">government warehouse</a>, filled with countless similar crates.</p>

The project was stalled when <a href="/wiki/Clint_Eastwood" id="w">Clint Eastwood</a> hired Kaufman to direct <i><a href="/wiki/The_Outlaw_Josey_Wales" id="w">The Outlaw Josey Wales</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-smith_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-smith" title="">[3]</a></sup> In late May 1977, Lucas was in <a href="/wiki/Maui" id="w">Maui</a>, trying to escape the enormous success of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" id="w">Star Wars</a></i>. Friend and colleague <a href="/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" id="w">Steven Spielberg</a> was also there, holidaying from work on <i><a href="/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" id="w">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></i>. While building a sand castle at <a href="/wiki/Mauna_Kea" id="w">Mauna Kea</a>,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Spielberg expressed an interest in directing a <a href="/wiki/James_Bond" id="w">James Bond</a> film. Lucas convinced his friend Spielberg that he had conceived a character &#34;better than James Bond&#34; and explained the concept of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>. Spielberg loved it, calling it &#34;a James Bond film without the hardware&#34;,<sup id="_ref-mcbride_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcbride" title="">[5]</a></sup> though he had the character&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Surname" id="w">surname</a> changed to &#34;<a href="/wiki/Jones_(surname)" id="w">Jones</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The following year, Lucas focused on developing <i>Raiders</i> and the <i>Star Wars</i> sequel <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back" id="w">The Empire Strikes Back</a></i>, during which <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_Kasdan" id="w">Lawrence Kasdan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frank_Marshall_(movie_producer)" id="w">Frank Marshall</a> joined the project as screenwriter and producer respectively. Between <a href="/wiki/January_23" id="w">January 23</a>-<a href="/wiki/January_27" id="w">January 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1978" id="w">1978</a> for nine hours a day, Lucas, Kasdan and Spielberg discussed the story and visual ideas. Spielberg came up with Jones being chased by a boulder, <sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup> and Lucas came up with a submarine, a monkey giving the <a href="/wiki/Nazi_salute" id="w">Nazi salute</a>, and a girl slugging Jones in <a href="/wiki/Nepal" id="w">Nepal</a>.<sup id="_ref-mcbride_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcbride" title="">[5]</a></sup> Kasdan used a 100 page transcript of their conversations for his first script draft,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> working for six months.<sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup> Ultimately some of their ideas were too grand and had to be cut: a mine chase,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> an escape in <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" id="w">Shanghai</a> using a rolling gong as a shield,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> and a jump from an airplane in a raft, all of which made it into the sequel.<sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Spielberg and Lucas disagreed on the character: although Lucas saw him as a Bondian playboy, Kasdan and Spielberg felt the professor and adventurer elements of the character made him complex enough. Spielberg had darker visions of Jones, interpreting him as an <a href="/wiki/Alcoholic" id="w">alcoholic</a> similar to <a href="/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart" id="w">Humphrey Bogart</a>&#39;s character Fred C. Dobbs in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Treasure_of_the_Sierra_Madre_(film)" id="w">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a></i>. This characterization fell away during the later drafts.<sup id="_ref-mcbride_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcbride" title="">[5]</a></sup> Spielberg also initially conceived of Toht with a robotic arm, which Lucas rejected as falling into science-fiction. Comic book artist <a href="/wiki/Jim_Steranko" id="w">Jim Steranko</a> was also commissioned to produce original illustrations for pre-production, which heavily influenced Spielberg&#39;s decisions in both the look of the film and the character of Indiana Jones himself.<sup id="_ref-twenty-five_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-twenty-five" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>As <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> began post-production in September 1979, Lucas began to find a <a href="/wiki/Distribution" id="w">distribution</a> deal for <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>.<sup id="_ref-lucas prod_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lucas prod" title="">[10]</a></sup> Studios were reluctant following Spielberg&#39;s flop <i><a href="/wiki/1941_(film)" id="w">1941</a></i>, unable to believe he could bring the film for $20 million which they would have to pay for.<sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup> They also balked at simply distributing the film while the filmmakers took a larger share of box office receipts<sup id="_ref-lucas prod_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lucas prod" title="">[10]</a></sup> and full ownership of the film.<sup id="_ref-mcbride_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcbride" title="">[5]</a></sup> Despite a concern that the first sequence alone would cost $20 million,<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" id="w">Paramount Pictures</a> under <a href="/wiki/Michael_Eisner" id="w">Michael Eisner</a> accepted<sup id="_ref-lucas prod_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lucas prod" title="">[10]</a></sup> on condition of making at least four sequels with <a href="/wiki/Lucasfilm" id="w">Lucasfilm</a>.<sup id="_ref-mcbride_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcbride" title="">[5]</a></sup> By April 1980, Kasdan&#39;s fifth draft was produced, and production was getting ready to shoot at <a href="/wiki/Elstree_Studios" id="w">Elstree Studios</a>, with Lucas trying to keep costs down.<sup id="_ref-lucas prod_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lucas prod" title="">[10]</a></sup> With four illustrators, <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> was Spielberg&#39;s most <a href="/wiki/Storyboard" id="w">storyboarded</a> film of his career to date, further helping the film economically, and he and Lucas agreed on a tight schedule to stylistically follow the &#34;quick and dirty&#34; feel of the Saturday matinée serials.<sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h1>Production</h1>
<p>Filming began on <a href="/wiki/June_23" id="w">June 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1980" id="w">1980</a> at <a href="/wiki/La_Rochelle" id="w">La Rochelle</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, for scenes involving the Nazi submarine,<sup id="_ref-lucas prod_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lucas prod" title="">[10]</a></sup> which was rented from the movie <i><a href="/wiki/Das_Boot" id="w">Das Boot</a></i>.

However, one crew member was bitten by a python on set.<sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup> To shoot the scene where Indiana comes face-to-face with the cobra, a glass sheet was put between Ford and the animal, partially visible when the light hits it at a certain <a href="/wiki/Angle" id="w">angle</a>.<sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup> Unlike the character he portrayed, Ford does not actually have a fear of snakes; Spielberg was not afraid either, but seeing all the snakes on the set writhing around made him &#34;want to puke&#34;.<sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup> The opening sequence featured live <a href="/wiki/Tarantulas" id="w">tarantulas</a>: <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Molina" id="w">Alfred Molina</a> had to have many put on him, but they did not move until a female was placed there.

A <a href="/wiki/Fibreglass" id="w">fibreglass</a> boulder 22 feet in diameter was made for the scene where Indiana escapes the temple, but Spielberg rejected it and had it made 50 feet (15.2 m) larger.<sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>All of the scenes set in <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a> and the canyon where Indiana threatens to blow up the Ark were filmed in <a href="/wiki/Tunisia" id="w">Tunisia</a>; many of the locations were repeated from <i>Star Wars</i>, since many people in the location crew were the same for both films.<sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup> Notably, that canyon was the exact same location wherein <a href="/wiki/R2-D2" id="w">R2-D2</a> was attacked by <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_races_(F-J)#Jawa" id="w">Jawas</a>.<sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Filming there was a harsh experience due to the <a href="/wiki/Heat" id="w">heat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Disease" id="w">disease</a>.

Much was improvised there: the scene wherein Marion puts on her dress and attempts to leave Belloq&#39;s tent was improvised, as was the entire plane fight. During shooting of that scene, Ford tore his <a href="/wiki/Cruciate_ligament" id="w">cruciate ligament</a> in his left leg as a wheel went over his knee, but he did not accept medical help and simply put <a href="/wiki/Ice" id="w">ice</a> over it.<sup id="_ref-makingthetrilogy_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makingthetrilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup> The fight scenes in the town were filmed in <a href="/wiki/Kairouan" id="w">Kairouan</a>; by then Ford was suffering from <a href="/wiki/Dysentery" id="w">dysentery</a>. He had enough, and did not want to shoot a fight scene between Indiana and a swordsman. He said to Spielberg &#34;Why don&#39;t we just shoot the sucker?&#34; Spielberg agreed, scrapped the rest of the fight scene, and filmed the gag of Indiana quickly shooting the swordsman.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The truck chase was shot entirely by the second-unit who mostly followed Spielberg&#39;s storyboards, though they decided to add Indiana being dragged by the truck.

<p>Special effects were provided by <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26amp%3B_Magic" id="w">Industrial Light &#38; Magic</a>. These largely featured in the climactic sequence wherein the <a href="/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant" id="w">Ark of the Covenant</a> was opened and spirits come out to attack the Nazis. The melting of Toht&#39;s head was done by exposing a wax model of Ronald Lacey&#39;s head to a heat lamp with an under cranked camera, while Dietrich&#39;s crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. To avoid an <a href="/wiki/R_rating" id="w">R rating</a>, fire was double exposed over Belloq&#39;s exploding head. The spirits were shot underwater for a ghostly look.<sup id="_ref-magic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-magic" title="">[15]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Ben_Burtt" id="w">Ben Burtt</a> was sound effects supervisor, picking a <a href="/wiki/30-30_Winchester" id="w">30-30 Winchester</a> rifle for the sound of Jones&#39; gun; for the various punching noises throughout the film, leather jackets and baseball gloves were whacked by a baseball bat to continue the <a href="/wiki/Comic-book" id="w">comic-bookish</a> feel of the film. For the snakes in the Well of Souls sequence, cheese casserole and sponges were used for the slithering, while lifting a toilet tank was used for the sound of opening the Ark.

<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark<b>s score is most notable for featuring the rousing and iconic composition &#34;The Raiders March&#34; that came to symbolize Indiana Jones. The tune was composed by <a href="/wiki/John_Williams" id="w">John Williams</a>. The score also featured three other prominent themes: the grand yet mysterious &#34;Ark Theme&#34;, a theme associated with Marion, and the loud, pompous Nazi March, which harkens back to 1940s film scores. The score had received an Oscar nomination for best original score, but lost to <a href="/wiki/Vangelis" id="w">Vangelis</a>&#39;s electro-synth based score for <i><a href="/wiki/Chariots_of_Fire" id="w">Chariots of Fire</a></i>. John Williams composed the march in the two separate segments. When he played them for Steven Spielberg he told Williams that he liked them both, which led to the combined theme people know today.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></b></i></p>

<p>In 1998, the <a href="/wiki/American_Film_Institute" id="w">American Film Institute</a> placed the film at number 60 on its top 100 films of the first century of cinema.

Several sequences from the film are reproduced (the boulder run and the showdown with the Cairo Swordsman among them); however, several inconsistencies with the film are present in the game, such as Nazi soldiers and bats being present in the Well of Souls sequence, for example. The game was developed by <a href="/wiki/LucasArts" id="w">LucasArts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Factor_5" id="w">Factor 5</a>.</p>
