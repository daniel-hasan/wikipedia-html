<p><b>Harrogate Town F.C.</b> is an <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> semi-professional <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">football</a> club from <a href="/wiki/Harrogate%2C_North_Yorkshire" id="w">Harrogate, North Yorkshire</a>. The club was founded in <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a> and currently competes in the <a href="/wiki/Conference_North" id="w">Conference North</a> division of the Football Conference.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>The club was founded as <b>Harrogate AFC</b> in 1914. Previously the town of <a href="/wiki/Harrogate" id="w">Harrogate</a> had tried to put together a football team as far back as <a href="/wiki/1907" id="w">1907</a> but nothing emerged until 1914. They were entered into the <a href="/wiki/Northern_League_(football)" id="w">Northern League</a> upon their year of founding, and were set to play their home fixtures at the County Ground. However, due to <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> all fixtures were postponed.</p>
<p>After World War I ended, a meeting was held around the idea of putting the club back together. A man named Robert Ackrill Breare instigated this, and he later became the Secretary of the club. Harrogate were entered into the <a href="/wiki/West_Riding_League" id="w">West Riding League</a>. </p>
<a id="Early_years" name="Early_years"></a><h3>Early years</h3>
<p>Harrogate AFC finally played in their first competitive fixture on <a href="/wiki/30_August" id="w">30 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1919" id="w">1919</a> at Starbeck Lane Ground against Horsforth FC. They won the name 1-0 and the scorer was L. Craven with a headed goal. They were entered into the <a href="/wiki/FA_Cup" id="w">FA Cup</a> the same year. Harrogate also won their first trophy; the Whitworth Cup with a 4-0 victory against Ripon City.</p>
<p>For the 1920/21 season they were one of the founding teams in the new <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire_League" id="w">Yorkshire League</a>, yet they also continued to field a team in the <a href="/wiki/West_Riding_League" id="w">West Riding League</a>. The club had relocated to a new ground; Wetherby Lane. Around the holiday periods, they took part in friendlies against higher league opposition including <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_F.C." id="w">Liverpool</a> at their <a href="/wiki/Anfield" id="w">Anfield</a> ground, and another at fellow Yorkshire side <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_United" id="w">Sheffield United</a> in front of 15,000 fans.</p>
<p>They moved league once again for their third season, leaving the West Riding League and moving into the <a href="/wiki/Midland_Football_League" id="w">Midland Football League</a>. It included the reserve teams of <a href="/wiki/Nottingham_Forest" id="w">Nottingham Forest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday" id="w">Sheffield Wednesday</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barnsley_F.C." id="w">Barnsley</a>. The club remained in the Yorkshire League, fielding a reserve team. However, the club resigned from the Midland&#39;s league after only one season and reverting to fielding a first team in the Yorkshire League. The West Riding County Challenge Cup was won by Harrogate in <a href="/wiki/1925" id="w">1925</a>, with their 3-1 victory against Fryston Colliery at <a href="/wiki/Elland_Road" id="w">Elland Road</a>.</p>
<p>League victory was secured in 1926/27, as Harrogate became the <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire_League" id="w">Yorkshire League</a> champions, with Bob Morphet scoring 44 goals. The club then moved into the <a href="/wiki/Northern_League_(football)" id="w">Northern League</a>. Their second West Riding County Challenge Cup was won the same season against against <a href="/wiki/Selby" id="w">Selby Town</a>. The team disbanded in <a href="/wiki/1932" id="w">1932</a>.</p>
<a id="Climbing_the_Pyramid" name="Climbing_the_Pyramid"></a><h3>Climbing the Pyramid</h3>
<p>The town&#39;s club was brought back in <a href="/wiki/1935" id="w">1935</a> as <b>Harrogate Hotspurs</b>. After <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, the club was renamed as <b>Harrogate Town</b> and played in the <a href="/wiki/West_Yorkshire_League" id="w">West Yorkshire League</a>. Harrogate Town joined the <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire_League" id="w">Yorkshire League</a> again in <a href="/wiki/1957" id="w">1957</a>. They spent many years in the Yorkshire Leagues during the 1960s and 1970s, and then became a founding member of the new <a href="/wiki/Northern_Counties_East_Football_League" id="w">Northern Counties East Football League</a> in 1982. The club was looking to climb the newly instated <a href="/wiki/English_football_league_system" id="w">football pyramid</a> and so began to improve their ground, installing <a href="/wiki/Floodlight" id="w">floodlights</a>. They played a friendly to mark the occasion against <a href="/wiki/Leeds_United" id="w">Leeds United</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Eddie_Gray_(footballer)" id="w">Eddie Gray</a> being the first to switch the lights on.</p>
<p>After a West Riding County Cup win in 1986, and five seasons in the Northern Counties East league, they became founding members of the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Premier_League_First_Division" id="w">Northern Premier League First Division</a> in 1987-88, after having been invited to join the new league. In 1990 the club became a Limited Company in order to fund the construction of a new main stand, and in the same year the club won the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Premier_League_First_Division_Cup" id="w">Northern Premier League First Division Cup</a> under the captaincy of club stalwart Paul Williamson. They would spend fifteen seasons in this league, and on two occasions the club only narrowly avoided relegation back to the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Counties_East_Football_League" id="w">Northern Counties East Football League</a>.  Finally being promoted after the 2001-02 season, Manager John Reed led the club into the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Premier_League_Premier_Division" id="w">Northern Premier League Premier Division</a>. During their first season in that division they finished sixth, and for the first time in the club&#39;s history they reached the First Round proper of the <a href="/wiki/FA_Cup" id="w">FA Cup</a>, bowing out 5-1 to Farnborough Town of the Football Conference. Town also won the West Riding County Cup in both the 2001-02 and 2002-03 seasons.</p>
<p>They became founders of the newly established <a href="/wiki/Conference_North" id="w">Conference North</a> League, which feeds into the Conference National League, in 2004. During the first seaon they finished an impressive sixth, and the following season in 2005-06 they finished fifth winning entry into the Conference North play-offs; they lost the Play-Off Semi-Final 1-0 to the eventual Play-Off winners <a href="/wiki/Stafford_Rangers_F.C." id="w">Stafford Rangers</a>. </p>
<p>During their FA Cup run in the 2005-06 season, Harrogate were drawn to play away at <a href="/wiki/Torquay_United" id="w">Torquay United</a>, their first ever cup game against Football League opposition. The game was played on Saturday <a href="/wiki/5_November" id="w">5 November</a> and Harrogate achieved a 1-1 draw at Plainmoor to reach the 2nd round draw for the first ever time. In the replay on Tuesday <a href="/wiki/15_November" id="w">15 November</a> at Wetherby Road, Torquay United won 6-5 on penalties after the game finished 0-0 after extra-time. The crowd was a record with a capacity 3,300 packing into the ground.</p>
