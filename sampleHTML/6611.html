<p>The <b>Chicago Bears</b> are a professional <a href="/wiki/American_football" id="w">American football</a> team based in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a>. They are members of the North Division of the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_Conference" id="w">National Football Conference</a> (NFC) in the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" id="w">National Football League</a> (NFL). They are currently the <a href="/wiki/List_of_NFC_Championship_Game_winners" id="w">National Football Conference Champions</a>, after winning the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League_playoffs%2C_2006-07#NFC: Chicago Bears 39, New Orleans Saints 14" id="w">2006 NFC Championship Game</a>.</p>
<p>The Bears have won nine <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League_championships_history" id="w">Professional American Football league championships</a> (eight <a href="/wiki/List_of_NFL_champions" id="w">NFL Championships</a> and <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XX" id="w">Super Bowl XX</a>), trailing only the <a href="/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers" id="w">Green Bay Packers</a>, who have twelve. The Bears have the most enshrinees in the <a href="/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> with 26 members. </p>
<p>The club was founded in <a href="/wiki/Decatur%2C_Illinois" id="w">Decatur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a>, in 1919 and moved to Chicago in 1921.  Along with the <a href="/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals" id="w">Arizona Cardinals</a>, it is one of the two remaining franchises existing since the NFL&#39;s founding. The team played home games at Wrigley Field on Chicago&#39;s North Side through the 1970 season. With the exception of the 2002 season, they have played their home games at Chicago&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Soldier_Field" id="w">Soldier Field</a>  every year since 1971. The stadium is located next to <a href="/wiki/Lake_Michigan" id="w">Lake Michigan</a> and was recently remodeled in a modernization intended to bring stadium amenities up-to-date while preserving a historic Chicago building. The team has a fierce, <a href="/wiki/Bears-Packers_rivalry" id="w">long-standing rivalry</a> with the Packers, whom they have played in over 170 games.</p>
<p>The team headquarters, <a href="/wiki/Halas_Hall" id="w">Halas Hall</a>, is actually located in the Chicago suburb of <a href="/wiki/Lake_Forest%2C_Illinois" id="w">Lake Forest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a>.  The team practices at adjoining practice facilities there during the season.  Currently, the team holds its annual training camp from late July to mid-August on the campus of <a href="/wiki/Olivet_Nazarene_University" id="w">Olivet Nazarene University</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bourbonnais%2C_Illinois" id="w">Bourbonnais</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a>.</p>

<p>Originally named the <b>Decatur Staleys</b>, the club was established by the <a href="/wiki/A._E._Staley" id="w">A. E. Staley</a> Company of <a href="/wiki/Decatur%2C_Illinois" id="w">Decatur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a> in 1919 as a company team. This was the typical start for several of the early professional football franchises. The company hired <a href="/wiki/George_Halas" id="w">George Halas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edward_Sternaman" id="w">Edward &#34;Dutch&#34; Sternaman</a> in 1920 to run the team, and turned full control of the team over to them in 1921.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> However, official team and league records cite Halas as the founder as he took over the team in 1920 when it became a charter member of the NFL.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Along with the <a href="/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals" id="w">Arizona Cardinals</a> (originally from Chicago themselves), the Bears are one of only two charter members of the NFL still in existence. The team relocated to Chicago in 1921, where the club was renamed the <b>Chicago Staleys</b>. Under an agreement that was reached by Halas and Sternaman with Staley, Halas purchased the rights to the club from Staley for <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$100</a>.</p>
<p>The Bears dominated the league in the early years. Their rivalry with the Cardinals, the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rivalry from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles (see <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Chicago_Bears" id="w">History of the Chicago Bears</a>). During the league&#39;s first six years, the Bears lost twice to the <a href="/wiki/Canton_Bulldogs" id="w">Canton Bulldogs</a> (who took two league titles over that span) and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4&#8211;4&#8211;2 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. Over that span, the Bears posted an incredible 34 shutouts.</p>
<p>The Bears&#39; rivalry with the Green Bay Packers is one of the oldest, fiercest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921. In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent them from signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1922, Halas changed the team name from the Staleys to the Bears. The team moved into Wrigley Field, which was home to the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Cubs" id="w">Chicago Cubs</a> <a href="/wiki/Baseball" id="w">baseball</a> franchise. As with several early NFL franchises, the Bears derived their nickname from their city&#39;s baseball team. Halas liked the bright orange-and-blue colors of his alma mater, the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign" id="w">University of Illinois</a>, and the Bears adopted those colors as their own, albeit in a darker shade of each (the blue is a Navy Blue, and the orange is <a href="/wiki/Pantone" id="w">Pantone</a> 1665, similar to burnt orange).</p>

 franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in <a href="/wiki/1921_NFL_season" id="w">1921</a> and remaining competitive throughout the decade. In 1924 the Bears claimed the Championship after defeating the <a href="/wiki/Cleveland_Bulldogs" id="w">Cleveland Bulldogs</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a>, even putting the title &#34;World&#39;s Champions&#34; on their 1924 team photo. But the NFL had ruled that games after <a href="/wiki/November_30" id="w">November 30</a> did not count towards league standings, and the Bears had to settle for second place behind Cleveland.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Their only losing season came in <a href="/wiki/1929_NFL_season" id="w">1929</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1920s the club was responsible for triggering the NFL&#39;s long-standing rule that a player could not be signed until his college&#39;s senior class had graduated. The NFL took that action as a consequence of the Bears&#39; aggressive signing of famous University of Illinois player <a href="/wiki/Red_Grange" id="w">Red Grange</a> within a day of his final game as a collegian.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the financial losses of the <a href="/wiki/1932_NFL_season" id="w">1932</a> Championship season, Halas&#39; partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record. In the <a href="/wiki/NFL_Playoff_Game%2C_1932" id="w">1932 &#34;Unofficial&#34; NFL Championship</a>, the Bears defeated the <a href="/wiki/Portsmouth_Spartans" id="w">Portsmouth Spartans</a> in the first indoor American football game at <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Stadium" id="w">Chicago Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>The success of the playoff game led the NFL to institute a championship game. In the very first <a href="/wiki/History_of_NFL_Championships" id="w">NFL Championship</a>, the Bears played against the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Giants" id="w">New York Giants</a>, defeating them 23&#8211;21. The teams met again in the <a href="/wiki/NFL_Championship_Game%2C_1934" id="w">1934 NFL Championship</a> where the Giants, wearing sneakers<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> defeated the Bears 30&#8211;13 on a cold, icy day at the <a href="/wiki/Polo_Grounds" id="w">Polo Grounds</a>.</p>

 1940&#8211;1947, <a href="/wiki/Quarterback" id="w">quarterback</a> <a href="/wiki/Sid_Luckman" id="w">Sid Luckman</a> led the Bears to victories in four out of the five NFL Championship Games in which they appeared. The team acquired the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" id="w">University of Chicago</a>&#39;s discarded nickname &#34;<a href="/wiki/Monsters_of_the_Midway" id="w">Monsters of the Midway</a>&#34; and their now-famous helmet &#34;C&#34;, as well as a newly-penned <a href="/wiki/Bear_Down%2C_Chicago_Bears" id="w">theme song</a> that declared them &#34;The Pride and Joy of Illinois&#34;. One famous victory during that period was their 73&#8211;0 victory over the favored <a href="/wiki/Washington_Redskins" id="w">Washington Redskins</a> at <a href="/wiki/Griffith_Stadium" id="w">Griffith Stadium</a> in the <a href="/wiki/NFL_Championship_Game%2C_1940" id="w">1940 NFL Championship Game</a>; the score is still an NFL record for lopsided results.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> The secret behind the one-sided outcome was the introduction of a new offensive formation by Halas. The <a href="/wiki/T-formation" id="w">T-formation</a>, as Halas named it, involved two <a href="/wiki/Running_back" id="w">running backs</a> instead of the traditional one in the backfield. Luckman&#39;s success at the quarterback position for the Bears has not been matched, as he still holds club records for passing.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>After declining throughout the 1950s, the team rebounded in <a href="/wiki/1963_NFL_season" id="w">1963</a> to capture their 8th NFL Championship, which would be their last until 1985. The late 1960s and early 1970s produced notable players like <a href="/wiki/Dick_Butkus" id="w">Dick Butkus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gale_Sayers" id="w">Gale Sayers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Brian_Piccolo" id="w">Brian Piccolo</a>, who died of <a href="/wiki/Embryonal_carcinoma" id="w">Embryonal carcinoma</a> in 1970. The American television network <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" id="w">ABC</a> aired a movie about Piccolo in 1971 entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Brian%26%2339%3Bs_Song" id="w">Brian&#39;s Song</a></i>, starring <a href="/wiki/James_Caan" id="w">James Caan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Billy_Dee_Williams" id="w">Billy Dee Williams</a> in the roles of Piccolo and Sayers respectively; <a href="/wiki/Jack_Warden" id="w">Jack Warden</a> won an <a href="/wiki/Emmy_Award" id="w">Emmy Award</a> for his performance as Halas. The movie was later released for theater screenings after first being shown on television.</p>
<p>Halas retired as coach in 1967 and spent the rest of his days in the front office. He became the only person to be involved with the NFL throughout the first 60 years of its existence. He was also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame&#39;s first induction class in 1963. As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 merger between the NFL and the <a href="/wiki/American_Football_League" id="w">American Football League</a>, the owners honored Halas by electing him the first President of the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_Conference" id="w">National Football Conference</a>, a position that he held until his death in 1983. In his honor, the NFL named the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_Conference" id="w">National Football Conference</a> Championship trophy as the <a href="/wiki/NFC_Championship" id="w">George Halas Memorial Trophy</a>.</p>
<a id="1970%E2%80%93present" name="1970%E2%80%93present"></a><h2>1970–present</h2>
<p>After the merger, the Bears finished the 1970 season with a last-place finish in the division, a repeat of their placing in the 1969 season. In 1975 the Bears <a href="/wiki/1975_NFL_Draft" id="w">drafted</a> <a href="/wiki/Walter_Payton" id="w">Walter Payton</a> from <a href="/wiki/Jackson_State_University" id="w">Jackson State University</a> with their first pick, and he made an immediate impact on the football landscape. He won the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" id="w">NFL Most Valuable Player Award</a> in the <a href="/wiki/1977_NFL_season" id="w">1977–78 season</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Payton would go on to eclipse <a href="/wiki/Jim_Brown" id="w">Jim Brown</a>&#39;s NFL career <a href="/wiki/Rush_(American_football)" id="w">rushing</a> record in 1984 before retiring in 1987, and would hold the mark until <a href="/wiki/2002_NFL_season" id="w">2002</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Emmitt_Smith" id="w">Emmitt Smith</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys" id="w">Dallas Cowboys</a> surpassed it.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Payton&#39;s career and great personality would capture the hearts of Bear fans, who called him &#34;Sweetness&#34;. He died from a rare liver cancer in 1999 at the age of 45.</p>
<p>From 1977 through 1985 the club&#39;s official cheerleaders were the Honey Bears, who were hired by then General Manager <a href="/wiki/Jim_Finks" id="w">Jim Finks</a>. They cheered at Soldier Field during all Bears home games and performed at <a href="/wiki/Halftime_show" id="w">halftime</a> for the viewing public. The group&#39;s founder and choreographer, Cathy Core, was contacted by Finks on the topic of organizing the cheerleading squad, but as she didn&#39;t believe that Finks was actually calling she hung up. When she later found out the call was genuine, she apologized.<sup id="_ref-Honey Bears_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Honey Bears" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The idea of a cheerleading squad was thought up by Halas himself, who called them &#34;dancing girls&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Honey Bears_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Honey Bears" title="">[12]</a></sup> Halas was quoted as saying that the Honey Bears would be around as long as he was alive.<sup id="_ref-Honey Bears_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Honey Bears" title="">[12]</a></sup> After his death in 1983, his heirs in the McCaskey family decided to end their relationship with the Honey Bears, declining to renew their contract following the Bears&#39; championship season of <a href="/wiki/1985_NFL_season" id="w">1985</a>. Word has it that as long as the McCaskey family owns the team, the Honey Bears will remain a memory.<sup id="_ref-Honey Bears_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Honey Bears" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_1" id="w">November 1</a> <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a>, a day after the death of George Halas, his oldest daughter, Virginia McCaskey, took over as the majority owner of the team. Her husband, Ed McCaskey, succeeded her father as the Chairman of the Board.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Their son Michael became the third president in team history.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Mrs. McCaskey holds the honorary title of &#34;secretary of the board of directors&#34;, but the 82&#8211;year&#8211;old <a href="/wiki/Matriarch" id="w">matriarch</a> has been called the glue that holds the franchise together.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Mrs. McCaskey&#39;s reign as the owner of the Bears was not planned, as her father originally earmarked her brother, <a href="/wiki/George_Halas%2C_Jr." id="w">George &#34;Mugs&#34; Halas, Jr.</a> as the heir apparent to the franchise. However, he died of a massive heart attack in 1979, and four years later she inherited the team upon George Halas&#39; death. Her impact on the team is well-noted as her own family has dubbed her &#34;The First Lady of Sports&#34;, and the <i><a href="/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" id="w">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i> has listed her as one of Chicago&#39;s most powerful women.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Mike_Ditka" id="w">Mike Ditka</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Tight_end" id="w">tight end</a> for the Bears from 1961 to 1966, was hired to coach the team in 1982. In the 1985 season the fire in the Bears&#8211;Packers rivalry was relit when Ditka used 350&#8211;plus pound <a href="/wiki/American_football_positions#Offense" id="w">lineman</a> <a href="/wiki/William_Perry_(football)" id="w">&#34;Refrigerator&#34; Perry</a> as a truly <a href="/wiki/Wide_receiver" id="w">&#34;wide&#34; receiver</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Touchdown" id="w">touchdown</a> play at <a href="/wiki/Lambeau_Field" id="w">Lambeau Field</a>, flagrantly taunting the Packers. The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the <a href="/wiki/AFL-NFL_merger" id="w">AFL-NFL merger</a>, in Super Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary <a href="/wiki/46_defense" id="w">46 defense</a> and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Super_Bowl_Shuffle" id="w">The Super Bowl Shuffle</a>&#34;. The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the &#34;unlucky 13th&#34; game of the season, a <a href="/wiki/Monday_Night_Football" id="w">Monday night</a> affair in which they were defeated by the <a href="/wiki/Miami_Dolphins" id="w">Miami Dolphins</a>. At the time, much was made of the fact that the <a href="/wiki/1972_NFL_season" id="w">1972</a> Dolphins were the only franchise in history to have had an undefeated season and post-season. The Dolphins came close to setting up a rematch in the Super Bowl, but lost to the <a href="/wiki/New_England_Patriots" id="w">New England Patriots</a> in the <a href="/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game" id="w">AFC title game</a>. &#34;The Super Bowl Shuffle&#34; was videotaped the day after that Monday night loss in Miami.</p>
<p>After the 1985 Championship season, the Bears remained competitive throughout the 1980s but failed to return to the <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl" id="w">Super Bowl</a> under Mike Ditka. Since the firing of Ditka at the end of the 1992 season, the Bears have only made the playoffs five times&#8211;. The club has also gone through three coaching changes since 1993. <a href="/wiki/Dave_Wannstedt" id="w">Dave Wannstedt</a> was the head coach from 1993 through 1998. <a href="/wiki/Dick_Jauron" id="w">Dick Jauron</a> succeeded Wannstedt after the 1998 season. After having his contract extended through 2004 after the Bears went 13-3 in 2001, Jauron was fired at the end of the 2003 season. Before the Bears hired Jauron in January 1999, <a href="/wiki/Dave_McGinnis" id="w">Dave McGinnis</a> (Arizona&#39;s defensive coordinator, and a former Bears assistant under Ditka and Wannstedt) backed out of taking the head coaching position. The Bears scheduled a press conference to announce the hiring before McGinnis agreed to contract terms.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Incidentally, soon after Jauron&#39;s hiring, Mrs. McCaskey fired her son Michael as president, replacing him with <a href="/wiki/Ted_Phillips" id="w">Ted Phillips</a> and promoting Michael to <a href="/wiki/Chairman_of_the_board" id="w">chairman of the board</a>.

<p>The club has had few official logos throughout their history. The first was introduced in the early 1950s as a black bear on top of a football. The team kept this until 1962, when the Bears trademark &#39;C&#39; logo was first introduced by the team.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>

<div class="thumbcaption">One of the original logos (1962–1973)</div></div>

The change in their logo from the black bear was due to the addition of logos on <a href="/wiki/Football_helmet" id="w">helmets</a>, which pro football teams started adding in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Unlike some NFL franchises that have had many different looks over time, the Bears have kept the wishbone &#39;C&#39; for over 40 years.</p>
<p>In 1974, the team decided to keep the same white &#39;C&#39; logo but to change the color of it from white to orange with a white trim. This is the current logo to this date; however, the club has experimented with some alternative logos throughout the past decade, including a black bear inside of the orange wishbone &#39;C&#39;, introduced in 1995, and an orange bear head, introduced in 1999.</p>

<p>In 1920 the team introduced the official team uniforms containing brown and blue stripes. In the 1930s, the franchise&#39;s team uniform underwent some substantial alterations. After many subtle and not-so-subtle changes, by 1933 the Bears donned all-orange jerseys with navy numbers and matching black helmets. In 1936, they modified this design into &#34;an early version of <a href="/wiki/Psychedelic_art" id="w">psychedelia</a>&#34; by adding three orange stripes to their helmets, changing the color of the jerseys from orange to white, complementing the new white jerseys with fourteen navy and orange alternating stripes on the sleeves, and introducing socks with a similar striped pattern extending from ankle to knee. Due to poor response from the fans and the media, this design lasted only one season.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>

By 1949, the team was wearing the familiar navy blue shirts with white, rounded numbers. In 1956, the team added &#34;TV numbers&#34; to the sleeves. The Bears &#39;C&#39; logo first appeared on the helmets in 1962. The logo changed from white to a white-bordered orange logo eleven years later, and has remained unchanged ever since. The Bears added the initials <i>GSH</i> to the left sleeve of their jerseys in 1984 in memory of <a href="/wiki/George_Halas" id="w">George Halas</a>.</p>
<p>Other variations to the Bears uniforms over the years include the addition of navy blue pants as a part of the road kit in 1984. During the 1994 season, the Bears &#8211; with most of the other NFL franchises &#8211; introduced <a href="/wiki/Throwback_uniform" id="w">throwback uniforms</a> to be worn in the honor of the NFL&#39;s 75th Anniversary.

On <a href="/wiki/October_7" id="w">October 7</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a> the Bears wore navy blue pants with their navy blue home jerseys for the first time, and lost at home to Green Bay before a national Monday Night Football audience.

The Bears previously wore orange jerseys as part of a throwback uniform in a <a href="/wiki/Thanksgiving" id="w">Thanksgiving Day</a> game at the Dallas Cowboys in 2004.

Soldier Field, located on <a href="/wiki/Lake_Shore_Drive" id="w">Lake Shore Drive</a> in Chicago, is the current home to the Bears. The Bears moved into Soldier Field in 1971 after Wrigley Field, the Bears&#39; home for 50 years, became too small to hold an NFL event, and neighbors to Northwestern University objected to the team&#39;s playing in at Dyche Stadium, now called Ryan Field. After the <a href="/wiki/AFL-NFL_Merger" id="w">AFL-NFL Merger</a>, the newly merged league wanted their teams to play in stadiums that could hold at least 50,000 fans. Even with the portable bleachers that the team brought into Wrigley, the stadium could still only hold 46,000.<sup id="_ref-Wrigley Field_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wrigley Field" title="">[34]</a></sup> The stadium&#39;s playing turf was changed from <a href="/wiki/AstroTurf" id="w">astroturf</a> to natural grass in time for the start of the 1988 season. The stadium was the site of the infamous <a href="/wiki/Fog_Bowl_(American_football)" id="w">Fog Bowl</a> playoff game between the Bears and <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles" id="w">Philadelphia Eagles</a>.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2002, the stadium was closed and rebuilt with only the exterior wall of the stadium being preserved. It was closed on Sunday, <a href="/wiki/January_20" id="w">January 20</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, a day after the Bears lost in the <a href="/wiki/NFL_playoffs%2C_2001-02" id="w">playoffs</a>.
