{{History of Turkish Literature}}
<b>Turkish literature</b> (<a href="/wiki/Turkish_language" id="w">Turkish</a>: <i>Türk edebiyatı</i> or <i>Türk yazını</i>) is the collection of written and oral texts composed in the <a href="/wiki/Turkish_language" id="w">Turkish language</a>, either in its <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Turkish_language" id="w">Ottoman</a> form or in less exclusively literary forms, such as that spoken in the <a href="/wiki/Turkey" id="w">Republic of Turkey</a> today. The Ottoman Turkish language, which forms the basis of much of the written corpus, was heavily influenced by <a href="/wiki/Persian_language" id="w">Persian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arabic_language" id="w">Arabic</a> and used a variant of the <a href="/wiki/Perso-Arabic_alphabet" id="w">Perso-Arabic script</a>.</p>
<p>The history of Turkish literature spans a period of nearly 1,500 years. The oldest extant records of written <a href="/wiki/Turkic_languages" id="w">Turkic</a> are the <a href="/wiki/Orkhon_script" id="w">Orhon inscriptions</a>, found in the <a href="/wiki/Orkhon_Valley" id="w">Orhon River valley</a> in central <a href="/wiki/Mongolia" id="w">Mongolia</a> and dating to the 8th century. Subsequent to this period, between the 9th and 11th centuries, there arose among the <a href="/wiki/Nomad" id="w">nomadic</a> <a href="/wiki/Turkic_peoples" id="w">Turkic peoples</a> of <a href="/wiki/Central_Asia" id="w">Central Asia</a> a tradition of <a href="/wiki/Oral_literature" id="w">oral</a> <a href="/wiki/Epic_poetry" id="w">epics</a>, such as the <i><a href="/wiki/Book_of_Dede_Korkut" id="w">Book of Dede Korkut</a></i> of the <a href="/wiki/Oghuz_Turks" id="w">Oghuz Turks</a>—the linguistic and cultural ancestors of the modern <a href="/wiki/Turkish_people" id="w">Turkish people</a>—and the <a href="/wiki/Manas_(epic)" id="w">Manas epic</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Kyrgyz" id="w">Kyrgyz</a> people.</p>
<p>Beginning with the victory of the <a href="/wiki/Seljuq_dynasty" id="w">Seljuks</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Manzikert" id="w">Battle of Manzikert</a> in the late 11th century, the Oghuz Turks began to settle in <a href="/wiki/Anatolia" id="w">Anatolia</a>, and in addition to the earlier oral traditions there arose a written literary tradition issuing largely—in terms of themes, genres, and styles—from <a href="/wiki/Arabic_literature" id="w">Arabic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Persian_literature" id="w">Persian</a> literature. For the next 900 years, until shortly before the fall of the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Ottoman Empire</a> in 1922, the oral and written traditions would remain largely separate from one another. With the founding of the <a href="/wiki/Turkey" id="w">Republic of Turkey</a> in 1923, the two traditions came together for the first time. </p>
<a id="The_two_traditions_of_Turkish_literature" name="The_two_traditions_of_Turkish_literature"></a><h2>The two traditions of Turkish literature</h2>
<p>Throughout most of its history, Turkish literature has been rather sharply divided into two rather different traditions, neither of which exercised much influence upon the other until the 19th century. The first of these two traditions is Turkish folk literature, and the second is Turkish written literature.</p>
<p>For most of the history of Turkish literature, the salient difference between the folk and the written traditions has been the variety of language employed. The folk tradition, by and large, was oral and remained free of the influence of Persian and Arabic literature, and consequently of those literatures&#39; respective languages. In folk poetry—which is by far the tradition&#39;s dominant <a href="/wiki/Genre" id="w">genre</a>—this basic fact led to two major consequences in terms of poetic style:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a href="/wiki/Meter_(poetry)" id="w">poetic meters</a> employed in the folk poetic tradition were different, being quantitative (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Syllabic_verse" id="w">syllabic</a>) verse, as opposed to the qualitative verse employed in the written poetic tradition;</li>
<li>the basic structural unit of folk poetry became the <a href="/wiki/Quatrain" id="w">quatrain</a> (Turkish: <i>dörtlük</i>) rather than the <a href="/wiki/Couplet" id="w">couplets</a> (Turkish: <i>beyit</i>) more commonly employed in written poetry.</li></ul>
<p>Furthermore, Turkish folk poetry has always had an intimate connection with <a href="/wiki/Song" id="w">song</a>—most of the poetry was, in fact, expressly composed so as to be sung—and so became to a great extent inseparable from the tradition of <a href="/wiki/Turkish_folk_music" id="w">Turkish folk music</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast to the tradition of Turkish folk literature, Turkish written literature—prior to the <a href="/wiki/Single-Party_Period_of_Republic_of_Turkey" id="w">founding</a> of the Republic of Turkey in 1923—tended to embrace the influence of Persian and Arabic literature. To some extent, this can be seen as far back as the <a href="/wiki/Sultanate_of_R%C3%BCm" id="w">Seljuk</a> period in the late 11th to early 14th centuries, where official business was conducted in the Persian language, rather than in Turkish, and where a court poet such as Dehhanî—who served under the 13th century <a href="/wiki/Sultan" id="w">sultan</a> Ala ad-Din Kay Qubadh I—wrote in a language highly inflected with Persian.</p>
<p>When the Ottoman Empire arose early in the 14th century, in northwestern Anatolia, it continued this tradition. The standard poetic forms—for poetry was as much the dominant genre in the written tradition as in the folk tradition—were derived either directly from the Persian literary tradition (the <i><a href="/wiki/Ghazal" id="w">gazel</a></i> غزل; the <i><a href="/wiki/Masnavi_(poetic_form)" id="w">mesnevî</a></i> مسنوى), or indirectly through Persian from the Arabic (the <i><a href="/wiki/Qasida" id="w">kasîde</a></i> قصيده). However, the decision to adopt these poetic forms wholesale led to two important further consequences:<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li>the <a href="/wiki/Meter_(poetry)#Ottoman Turkish" id="w">poetic meters</a> (Turkish: <i>aruz</i>) of Persian poetry were adopted;</li>
<li>Persian- and Arabic-based words were brought into the Turkish language in great numbers, as Turkish words rarely worked well within the system of Persian poetic meter.</li></ul>
<p>Out of this confluence of choices, the Ottoman Turkish language—which was always highly distinct from standard Turkish—was effectively born. This style of writing under Persian and Arabic influence came to be known as &#34;Divan literature&#34; (Turkish: <i>divan edebiyatı</i>), <i><a href="/wiki/Deewan" id="w">dîvân</a></i> (ديوان) being the Ottoman Turkish word referring to the collected works of a poet.</p>
<p>Just as Turkish folk poetry was intimately bound up with Turkish folk music, so did Ottoman Divan poetry develop a strong connection with <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_classical_music" id="w">Turkish classical music</a>, with the poems of the Divan poets often being taken up to serve as song lyrics.</p>
<a id="Folk_literature" name="Folk_literature"></a><h2>Folk literature</h2>
<p>{{Main}}
Turkish folk literature is an <a href="/wiki/Oral_tradition" id="w">oral tradition</a> deeply rooted, in its form, in Central Asian nomadic traditions. However, in its themes, Turkish folk literature reflects the problems peculiar to a settling (or settled) people who have abandoned the nomadic lifestyle. One example of this is the series of <a href="/wiki/Folklore" id="w">folktales</a> surrounding the figure of Keloğlan, a young boy beset with the difficulties of finding a wife, helping his mother to keep the family house intact, and dealing with the problems caused by his neighbors. Another example is the rather mysterious figure of <a href="/wiki/Nasreddin" id="w">Nasreddin</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Trickster" id="w">trickster</a> who often plays jokes, of a sort, on his neighbors.</p>
<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Ozan.jpg" title="An &#39;&#39;aşık&#39;&#39; performing in Anatolia, from an 18th-century Western engraving"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozan.jpg" alt="An &#39;&#39;aşık&#39;&#39; performing in Anatolia, from an 18th-century Western engraving" title="An &#39;&#39;aşık&#39;&#39; performing in Anatolia, from an 18th-century Western engraving" class="location-left type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">An <i>aşık</i> performing in Anatolia, from an 18th-century Western engraving</div></p>
<p>Nasreddin also reflects another significant change that had occurred between the days when the Turkish people were nomadic and the days when they had largely become settled in Anatolia; namely, Nasreddin is a <a href="/wiki/Muslim" id="w">Muslim</a> <a href="/wiki/Imam" id="w">imam</a>. The Turkic peoples had first become an <a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Islamic</a> people sometime around the 9th or 10th century, as is evidenced from the clear Islamic influence on the 11th century <a href="/wiki/Kara-Khanid_Khanate" id="w">Karakhanid</a> work the <i><a href="/wiki/Kutadgu_Bilig" id="w">Kutadgu Bilig</a></i> (&#34;<i>Wisdom of Royal Glory</i>&#34;), written by <a href="/wiki/Yusuf_Has_Hajib" id="w">Yusuf Has Hajib</a>. The religion henceforth came to exercise an enormous influence on Turkish society and literature, particularly the heavily <a href="/wiki/Mysticism" id="w">mystically oriented</a> <a href="/wiki/Sufism" id="w">Sufi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shi%26%2339%3Ba_Islam" id="w">Shi&#39;a</a> varieties of Islam. The Sufi influence, for instance, can be seen clearly not only in the tales concerning Nasreddin but also in the works of <a href="/wiki/Yunus_Emre" id="w">Yunus Emre</a>, a towering figure in Turkish literature and a poet who lived at the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century, probably in the <a href="/wiki/Karamanid" id="w">Karamanid</a> <a href="/wiki/Anatolian_beyliks" id="w">state</a> in south-central Anatolia. The Shi&#39;a influence, on the other hand, can be seen extensively in the tradition of the <i>aşık</i>s, or <i>ozan</i>s,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> who are roughly akin to medieval European <a href="/wiki/Minstrel" id="w">minstrels</a> and who traditionally have had a strong connection with the <a href="/wiki/Alevi" id="w">Alevi</a> faith, which can be seen as something of a homegrown Turkish variety of Shi&#39;a Islam. It is, however, important to note that in Turkish culture, such a neat division into Sufi and Shi&#39;a is scarcely possible: for instance, Yunus Emre is considered by some to have been an Alevi, while the entire Turkish <i>aşık</i>/<i>ozan</i> tradition is permeated with the thought of the <a href="/wiki/Bektashi" id="w">Bektashi</a> Sufi <a href="/wiki/Tarika" id="w">order</a>, which is itself a blending of Shi&#39;a and Sufi concepts. The word <i>aşık</i> (literally, &#34;lover&#34;) is in fact the term used for first-level members of the Bektashi order.</p>
<p>Because the Turkish folk literature tradition extends in a more or less unbroken line from about the 10th or 11th century to today, it is perhaps best to consider the tradition from the perspective of genre. There are three basic genres in the tradition: epic; folk poetry; and folklore.</p>
<a id="The_epic_tradition" name="The_epic_tradition"></a><h3>The epic tradition</h3>
<p>The Turkish epic has its roots in the Central Asian epic tradition that gave rise to the <i><a href="/wiki/Book_of_Dede_Korkut" id="w">Book of Dede Korkut</a></i>, which is in a language recognizably similar to modern Turkish and which developed from the oral traditions of the <a href="/wiki/Oghuz_Turks" id="w">Oghuz Turks</a>, that branch of the Turkic peoples which migrated towards <a href="/wiki/Southwest_Asia" id="w">western Asia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Europe" id="w">eastern Europe</a> through <a href="/wiki/Transoxiana" id="w">Transoxiana</a> beginning in the 9th century. The <i>Book of Dede Korkut</i> continued to survive in the oral tradition after the Oghuz Turks had, by and large, settled in Anatolia.</p>
<p>The <i>Book of Dede Korkut</i> was the primary element of the Turkish epic tradition in Anatolia for several centuries. Another epic circulating at the same time, however, was the so-called <i><a href="/wiki/Epic_of_K%C3%B6ro%C4%9Flu" id="w">Epic of Köroğlu</a></i>, which concerns the adventures of Rüşen Ali (&#34;Köroğlu&#34;, or &#34;son of the blind man&#34;) to exact revenge for the blinding of his father. The origins of this epic are somewhat more mysterious than those of the <i>Book of Dede Korkut</i>: many believe it to have arisen in Anatolia sometime between the 15th and 17th centuries; more reliable testimony,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> though, seems to indicate that the story is nearly as old as that of the <i>Book of Dede Korkut</i>, dating from around the dawn of the 11th century. Complicating matters somewhat is the fact that Köroğlu is also the name of a poet of the <i>aşık</i>/<i>ozan</i> tradition.</p>
<p>That the epic tradition in Turkish literature may not have died out entirely can be seen from the <i>Epic of <a href="/wiki/Shaikh" id="w">Shaykh</a> <a href="/wiki/Bedreddin" id="w">Bedreddin</a></i> (<i>Şeyh Bedreddin Destanı</i>), published in 1936 by the poet <a href="/wiki/Naz%C4%B1m_Hikmet" id="w">Nâzım Hikmet Ran</a> (1901–1963). This long poem—which concerns an Anatolian shaykh&#39;s rebellion against the Ottoman <a href="/wiki/Sultan" id="w">Sultan</a> <a href="/wiki/Mehmed_I" id="w">Mehmed I</a>—is a sort of modern, written epic that nevertheless draws upon the same independent-minded traditions of the Anatolian people that can be seen in the <i>Epic of Köroğlu</i>. Also, many of the works of the 20th-century novelist <a href="/wiki/Ya%C5%9Far_Kemal" id="w">Yaşar Kemal</a> (1923– ), such as his long 1955 novel <i><a href="/wiki/Memed%2C_My_Hawk" id="w">Memed, My Hawk</a></i> (<i>İnce Memed</i>), can be considered modern <a href="/wiki/Prose" id="w">prose</a> epics.</p>
<a id="Folk_poetry" name="Folk_poetry"></a><h3>Folk poetry</h3>
<p>The folk poetry tradition in Turkish literature, as indicated above, was strongly influenced by the Islamic Sufi and Shi&#39;a traditions. Furthermore, as partly evidenced by the prevalence of the still existent <i>aşık</i>/<i>ozan</i> tradition, the dominant element in Turkish folk poetry has always been song. The development of folk poetry in Turkish—which began to emerge in the 13th century with such important writers as Yunus Emre, Sultan Veled, and Şeyyâd Hamza—was given a great boost when, on <a href="/wiki/13_May" id="w">13 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1277" id="w">1277</a>, Karamanoğlu Mehmet Bey declared Turkish the official state language of Anatolia&#39;s powerful Karamanid state;<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> subsequently, many of the tradition&#39;s greatest poets would continue to emerge from this region. </p>
<p>There are, broadly speaking, two traditions of Turkish folk poetry:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <i>aşık</i>/<i>ozan</i> tradition, which—although much influenced by religion, as mentioned above—was for the most part a secular tradition;</li>
<li>the explicitly religious tradition, which emerged from the gathering places (<i><a href="/wiki/Tekkes" id="w">tekke</a></i>s) of the Sufi religious orders and Shi&#39;a groups.</li></ul>
<p>Much of the poetry and song of the <i>aşık</i>/<i>ozan</i> tradition, being almost exclusively oral until the 19th century, remains anonymous. There are, however, a few well-known <i>aşık</i>s from before that time whose names have survived together with their works: the aforementioned Köroğlu (16th century); Karacaoğlan (1606?–1689?), who may be the best-known of the pre-19th century <i>aşık</i>s; Dadaloğlu (1785?–1868?), who was one of the last of the great <i>aşık</i>s before the tradition began to dwindle somewhat in the late 19th century; and several others. The <i>aşık</i>s were essentially minstrels who travelled through Anatolia performing their songs on the <i><a href="/wiki/Baglama" id="w">bağlama</a></i>, a <a href="/wiki/Mandolin" id="w">mandolin</a>-like instrument whose paired strings are considered to have a symbolic religious significance in Alevi/Bektashi culture. Despite the decline of the <i>aşık</i>/<i>ozan</i> tradition in the 19th century, it experienced a significant revival in the 20th century thanks to such outstanding figures as <a href="/wiki/A%C5%9F%C4%B1k_Veysel_%C5%9Eat%C4%B1ro%C4%9Flu" id="w">Aşık Veysel Şatıroğlu</a> (1894–1973), <a href="/wiki/A%C5%9F%C4%B1k_Mahzuni_%C5%9Eerif" id="w">Aşık Mahzuni Şerif</a> (1938–2002), Neşet Ertaş (1943– ), and many others.</p>
<p><div style="wigth:90px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:90px-Kaygusuz_Abdal.jpg" title="Kaygusuz Abdal"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90px-Kaygusuz_Abdal.jpg" alt="Kaygusuz Abdal" title="Kaygusuz Abdal" class="location-left type-thumb" width="90px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Kaygusuz Abdal</div></div>

The explicitly religious folk tradition of <i>tekke</i> literature shared a similar basis with the <i>aşık</i>/<i>ozan</i> tradition in that the poems were generally intended to be sung, generally in religious gatherings, making them somewhat akin to Western <a href="/wiki/Hymn" id="w">hymns</a> (Turkish <i>ilahi</i>). One major difference from the <i>aşık</i>/<i>ozan</i> tradition, however, is that—from the very beginning—the poems of the <i>tekke</i> tradition were written down. This was because they were produced by revered religious figures in the literate environment of the <i>tekke</i>, as opposed to the milieu of the <i>aşık</i>/<i>ozan</i> tradition, where the majority could not read or write. The major figures in the tradition of <i>tekke</i> literature are: Yunus Emre (1240?–1320?), who is one of the most important figures in all of Turkish literature; Süleyman Çelebi (?–1422), who wrote a highly popular long poem called <i>Vesîletü&#39;n-Necât</i> (وسيلة النجاة &#34;The Means of Salvation&#34;, but more commonly known as the <i>Mevlid</i>), concerning the <a href="/wiki/Mawlid" id="w">birth</a> of the Islamic <a href="/wiki/Prophet" id="w">prophet</a> <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" id="w">Muhammad</a>; Kaygusuz Abdal (1397–?), who is widely considered the founder of Alevi/Bektashi literature; and <a href="/wiki/Pir_Sultan_Abdal" id="w">Pir Sultan Abdal</a> (?–1560), whom many consider to be the pinnacle of that literature.</p>
<a id="Folklore" name="Folklore"></a><h3>Folklore</h3>
<p>{{Main}}
<a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Nasreddin.jpg" title="Nasreddin Hoca"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasreddin.jpg" alt="Nasreddin Hoca" title="Nasreddin Hoca" class="location-none type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Nasreddin Hoca</div></p>
<p>The tradition of folklore—folktales, jokes, legends, and the like—in the Turkish language is very rich. Perhaps the most popular figure in the tradition is the aforementioned <a href="/wiki/Nasreddin" id="w">Nasreddin</a> (known as <i>Nasreddin Hoca</i>, or &#34;teacher Nasreddin&#34;, in Turkish), who is the central character of thousands of jokes. He generally appears as a person who, though seeming somewhat stupid to those who must deal with him, actually proves to have a special wisdom all his own:
</p><blockquote>
<p><i>One day, Nasreddin&#39;s neighbor asked him, &#34;Teacher, do you have any forty-year-old vinegar?&#34;—&#34;Yes, I do,&#34; answered Nasreddin.—&#34;Can I have some?&#34; asked the neighbor. &#34;I need some to make an ointment with.&#34;—&#34;No, you can&#39;t have any,&#34; answered Nasreddin. &#34;If I gave my forty-year-old vinegar to whoever wanted some, I wouldn&#39;t have had it for forty years, would I?&#34;</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Similar to the Nasreddin jokes, and arising from a similar religious milieu, are the <a href="/wiki/Bektashi_jokes" id="w">Bektashi jokes</a>, in which the members of the Bektashi religious order—represented through a character simply named <i>Bektaşi</i>—are depicted as having an unusual and unorthodox wisdom, one that often challenges the values of Islam and of society.</p>
<p>Another popular element of Turkish folklore is the <a href="/wiki/Theatre_of_shadows" id="w">shadow theater</a> centered around the two characters of <a href="/wiki/Karag%C3%B6z_and_Hacivat" id="w">Karagöz and Hacivat</a>, who both represent <a href="/wiki/Stock_character" id="w">stock characters</a>: Karagöz—who hails from a small village—is something of a country bumpkin, while Hacivat is a more sophisticated city-dweller. Popular legend has it that the two characters are actually based on two real persons who worked either for <a href="/wiki/Osman_I" id="w">Osman I</a>—the founder of the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Dynasty" id="w">Ottoman dynasty</a>—or for his successor <a href="/wiki/Orhan_I" id="w">Orhan I</a>, in the construction of a palace or possibly a mosque at <a href="/wiki/Bursa%2C_Turkey" id="w">Bursa</a> in the early 14th century. The two workers supposedly spent much of their time entertaining the other workers, and were so funny and popular that they interfered with work on the palace, and were subsequently <a href="/wiki/Decapitation" id="w">beheaded</a>. Supposedly, however, their bodies then picked up their severed heads and walked away.</p>
<a id="Ottoman_literature" name="Ottoman_literature"></a><h2>Ottoman literature</h2>
<p>The two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are poetry and <a href="/wiki/Prose" id="w">prose</a>. Of the two, poetry—specifically, Divan poetry—was by far the dominant stream. Moreover, it should be noted that, until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of <a href="/wiki/Fiction" id="w">fiction</a>; that is, there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European <a href="/wiki/Romance_(genre)" id="w">romance</a>, <a href="/wiki/Short_story" id="w">short story</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Novel" id="w">novel</a> (though analogous genres did, to some extent, exist in both the Turkish folk tradition and in Divan poetry).</p>
<a id="Divan_poetry" name="Divan_poetry"></a><h3>Divan poetry</h3>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">An Ottoman garden party, with poet, guest, and winebearer; from the 16th-century <i>Dîvân-ı Bâkî</i></div></div>

Ottoman Divan poetry was a highly <a href="/wiki/Ritual" id="w">ritualized</a> and <a href="/wiki/Symbolism" id="w">symbolic</a> art form. From the Persian poetry that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of <a href="/wiki/Symbol" id="w">symbols</a> whose meanings and interrelationships—both of similitude (مراعات نظير <i>mura&#39;ât-i nazîr</i> / تناسب
<i>tenâsüb</i>) and opposition (تضاد <i>tezâd</i>)—were more or less prescribed. Examples of prevalent symbols that, to some extent, oppose one another include, among others:</p>

<ul>
<li>the nightingale (بلبل <i>bülbül</i>) — the rose (ﮔل <i>gül</i>)</li>
<li>the world (جهان <i>cihan</i>; عالم <i>‘âlem</i>) — the rosegarden (ﮔﻠﺴﺘﺎن <i>gülistan</i>; ﮔﻠﺸﻦ <i>gülşen</i>)</li>
<li>the ascetic (زاهد <i>zâhid</i>) — the <a href="/wiki/Dervish" id="w">dervish</a> (درويش <i>derviş</i>)</li></ul>
<p>As the opposition of &#34;the ascetic&#34; and &#34;the dervish&#34; suggests, Divan poetry—much like Turkish folk poetry—was heavily influenced by <a href="/wiki/Sufism#Basic beliefs" id="w">Sufi thought</a>. One of the primary characteristics of Divan poetry, however—as of the Persian poetry before it—was its mingling of the mystical Sufi element with a profane and even erotic element. Thus, the pairing of &#34;the nightingale&#34; and &#34;the rose&#34; simultaneously suggests two different relationships:</p>

<ul>
<li>the relationship between the fervent lover (&#34;the nightingale&#34;) and the inconstant beloved (&#34;the rose&#34;)</li>
<li>the relationship between the individual Sufi practitioner (who is often characterized in Sufism as a lover) and <a href="/wiki/Allah" id="w">God</a> (who is considered the ultimate source and object of love)</li></ul>
<p>Similarly, &#34;the world&#34; refers simultaneously to the physical world and to this physical world considered as the abode of sorrow and impermanence, while &#34;the rosegarden&#34; refers simultaneously to a literal garden and to <a href="/wiki/Heaven#In Islam" id="w">the garden of Paradise</a>. &#34;The nightingale&#34;, or suffering lover, is often seen as situated—both literally and figuratively—in &#34;the world&#34;, while &#34;the rose&#34;, or beloved, is seen as being in &#34;the rosegarden&#34;.</p>
<p>Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. A brief example is the following line of verse, or <i>mısra</i> (مصراع), by the 18th-century <a href="/wiki/Qadi" id="w">judge</a> and poet Hayatî Efendi:</p>
<dl><dd>بر گل مى وار بو گلشن ﻋالمدﻪ خارسز</dd></dl><dl><dd><i>Bir gül mü var bu gülşen-i ‘âlemde hârsız</i><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><br/></dd></dl><dl><dd>(&#34;Does any rose, in this rosegarden world, lack thorns?&#34;)</dd></dl>
<p>Here, the nightingale is only implied (as being the poet/lover), while the rose, or beloved, is shown to be capable of inflicting pain with its thorns (خار <i>hâr</i>). The world, as a result, is seen as having both positive aspects (it is a rosegarden, and thus analogous to the garden of Paradise) and negative aspects (it is a rosegarden full of thorns, and thus different to the garden of Paradise).</p>
<p>As for the development of Divan poetry over the more than 500 years of its existence, that is—as the Ottomanist Walter G. Andrews points out—a study still in its infancy;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> clearly defined movements and periods have not yet been decided upon. Early in the history of the tradition, the Persian influence was very strong, but this was mitigated somewhat through the influence of poets such as the <a href="/wiki/Azerbaijani_people" id="w">Azerbaijani</a> <a href="/wiki/Nes%C3%AEm%C3%AE" id="w">Nesîmî</a> (?–1417?) and the <a href="/wiki/Uyghur_people" id="w">Uyghur</a> <a href="/wiki/Alisher_Navoi" id="w">Ali Şîr Nevâî</a> (1441–1501), both of whom offered strong arguments for the poetic status of the Turkic languages as against the much-venerated Persian. Partly as a result of such arguments, Divan poetry in its strongest period—from the 16th to the 18th centuries—came to display a unique balance of Persian and Turkish elements, until the Persian influence began to predominate again in the early 19th century.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of certainty regarding the stylistic movements and periods of Divan poetry, however, certain highly different styles are clear enough, and can perhaps be seen as exemplified by certain poets:

<li><a href="/wiki/B%C3%A2k%C3%AE" id="w">Bâkî</a> (1526–1600); a poet of great rhetorical power and linguistic subtlety whose skill in using the pre-established <a href="/wiki/Trope_(linguistics)" id="w">tropes</a> of the Divan tradition is quite representative of the poetry in the time of <a href="/wiki/Suleiman_the_Magnificent" id="w">Süleyman the Magnificent</a></li>
<li>Nef‘î (1570?–1635); a poet considered the master of the <i>kasîde</i> (a kind of <a href="/wiki/Panegyric" id="w">panegyric</a>), as well as being known for his harshly satirical poems, which led to his <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment" id="w">execution</a></li>

<p>The vast majority of Divan poetry was <a href="/wiki/Lyric_poetry" id="w">lyric</a> in nature: either <i>gazel</i>s (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or <i>kasîde</i>s.

<a id="Early_Ottoman_prose" name="Early_Ottoman_prose"></a><h3>Early Ottoman prose</h3>
<p>{{further}}
Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose never managed to develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of <i>sec<b> (سجع, also transliterated as <i>seci</i>), or <a href="/wiki/Rhymed_prose" id="w">rhymed prose</a>,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> a type of writing descended from the Arabic <i><a href="/wiki/Saj%26%2339%3B" id="w">saj&#39;</a></i> and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a <a href="/wiki/Rhyme" id="w">rhyme</a>.</b></i></p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time. This tradition was exclusively <a href="/wiki/Non-fiction" id="w">nonfictional</a> in nature—the <a href="/wiki/Fiction" id="w">fiction</a> tradition was limited to narrative poetry.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> A number of such nonfictional prose genres developed:

<p>{{further}}
By the early 19th century, the Ottoman Empire had become <a href="/wiki/Sick_man_of_Europe" id="w">moribund</a>. Attempts to right this situation had begun during the reign of <a href="/wiki/Selim_III" id="w">Sultan Selim III</a>, from 1789 to 1807, but were continuously thwarted by the powerful <a href="/wiki/Janissary" id="w">Janissary corps</a>. As a result, only after <a href="/wiki/Mahmud_II" id="w">Sultan Mahmud II</a> had abolished the Janissary corps in 1826 was the way paved for truly effective reforms (Ottoman Turkish: تنظيمات <i>tanzîmât</i>).</p>
<p>These reforms finally came to the empire during the <a href="/wiki/Tanzimat" id="w">Tanzimat period</a> of 1839–1876, when much of the Ottoman system was reorganized along largely <a href="/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)" id="w">French lines</a>. The Tanzimat reforms &#34;were designed both to modernize the empire and to forestall foreign intervention&#34;.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Along with reforms to the Ottoman system, serious reforms were also undertaken in the literature, which had become nearly as moribund as the empire itself. Broadly, these literary reforms can be grouped into two areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>changes brought to the language of Ottoman written literature;</li>
<li>the introduction into Ottoman literature of previously unknown genres.</li></ul>
<p>The reforms to the literary language were undertaken because the Ottoman Turkish language was thought by the reformists to have effectively lost its way. It had become more divorced than ever from its original basis in Turkish, with writers using more and more words and even grammatical structures derived from Persian and Arabic, rather than Turkish.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Meanwhile, however, the Turkish folk literature tradition of Anatolia, away from the capital <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" id="w">Constantinople</a>, came to be seen as an ideal. Accordingly, many of the reformists called for written literature to turn away from the Divan tradition and towards the folk tradition; this call for change can be seen, for example, in a famous statement by the poet and reformist Ziya <a href="/wiki/Pasha" id="w">Pasha</a> (1829–1880):
<div style="wigth:100px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:100px-Ziya.jpg" title="Ziya Pasha (1829–1880), Ottoman poet and reformist"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100px-Ziya.jpg" alt="Ziya Pasha (1829–1880), Ottoman poet and reformist" title="Ziya Pasha (1829–1880), Ottoman poet and reformist" class="location-left type-thumb" width="100px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Ziya Pasha (1829–1880), Ottoman poet and reformist</div></div>

</p><blockquote><i>Our language is not Ottoman; it is Turkish. What makes up our poetic canon is not </i>gazel<i>s and </i>kasîde<i>s, but rather </i>kayabaşı<i>s, </i>üçleme<i>s, and </i>çöğür<i>s</i><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup><i>, which some of our poets dislike, thinking them crude. But just let those with the ability exert the effort on this road [of change], and what powerful personalities will soon be born!</i><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>At the same time as this call—which reveals something of a burgeoning <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" id="w">national consciousness</a>—was being made, new literary genres were being introduced into Ottoman literature, primarily the novel and the short story. This trend began in 1861, with the translation into Ottoman Turkish of <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_F%C3%A9nelon" id="w">François Fénelon</a>&#39;s 1699 novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Telemachus" id="w">Les aventures de Télémaque</a></i>, by Yusuf Kâmil Pasha, <a href="/wiki/Vizier" id="w">Grand Vizier</a> to <a href="/wiki/Abd-ul-Aziz" id="w">Sultan Abdülaziz</a>. What is widely recognized as the first Turkish novel, <i>Taaşuk-u Tal&#39;at ve Fitnat</i> (تعشق طلعت و فطنت; &#34;Tal&#39;at and Fitnat In Love&#34;) by Şemsettin Sami (1850–1904), was published just ten years later, in 1872.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The introduction of such new genres into Turkish literature can be seen as part of a trend towards <a href="/wiki/Western_culture" id="w">Westernization</a> that continues to be felt in Turkey to this day.</p>
<p>Due to historically close ties with <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>—strengthened during the <a href="/wiki/Crimean_War" id="w">Crimean War</a> of 1854–1856—it was <a href="/wiki/French_literature" id="w">French literature</a> that came to constitute the major Western influence on Turkish literature throughout the latter half of the 19th century. As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their equivalents in the Ottoman Empire: in the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of <a href="/wiki/Romanticism" id="w">Romanticism</a> can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the <a href="/wiki/Realism_(arts)" id="w">Realist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Naturalism_(literature)" id="w">Naturalist</a> movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the <a href="/wiki/Symbolism_(arts)" id="w">Symbolist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Parnassian_poets" id="w">Parnassian</a> movements that became paramount.</p>
<p>Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet <a href="/wiki/Namik_Kemal" id="w">Nâmık Kemal</a> (1840–1888) also wrote the important 1876 novel <i>İntibâh</i> (انتباه; &#34;Awakening&#34;), while the <a href="/wiki/Journalist" id="w">journalist</a> Şinasi (1826–1871) is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish <a href="/wiki/Play" id="w">play</a>, the <a href="/wiki/One_act_play" id="w">one-act</a> <a href="/wiki/Comedy" id="w">comedy</a> &#34;<i>Şair Evlenmesi</i>&#34; (شاعر اولنمسى; &#34;The Poet&#39;s Marriage&#34;). In a similar vein, the novelist Ahmed Midhat Efendi (1844–1912) wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (حسن ملاح ياخود سر ايچيكده اسرار <i>Hasan Mellâh yâhud Sırr İçinde Esrâr</i>, 1873; &#34;<i>Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery</i>&#34;), Realism (هﻨﻮز اون يدى يشکده <i>Henüz On Yedi Yaşında</i>, 1881; &#34;<i>Just Seventeen Years Old</i>&#34;), and Naturalism (مشاهدات <i>Müşâhedât</i>, 1891; &#34;<i>Observations</i>&#34;). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers&#39; wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman <a href="/wiki/Social_structure" id="w">social structures</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

Most of the roots of modern Turkish literature were formed between the years 1896—when the first collective literary movement arose—and 1923, when the Republic of Turkey was officially founded. Broadly, there were three primary literary movements during this period:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <i>Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde</i> (ادبيات جدیده; &#34;New Literature&#34;) movement</li>
<li>the <i>Fecr-i Âtî</i> (فجر آتى; &#34;Dawn of the Future&#34;) movement</li>
<li>the <i>Millî Edebiyyât</i> (ملى ادبيات; &#34;National Literature&#34;) movement</li></ul>

<div class="thumbcaption">Tevfik Fikret (1867–1915), poet and editor of <i>Servet-i Fünûn</i></div></div>

The <i>Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde</i>, or &#34;New Literature&#34;, movement began with the founding in 1891 of the magazine <i>Servet-i Fünûn</i> (ﺛﺮوت ﻓﻨﻮن; &#34;Scientific Wealth&#34;), which was largely devoted to progress—both intellectual and scientific—along the Western model. Accordingly, the magazine&#39;s literary ventures, under the direction of the poet <a href="/wiki/Tevfik_Fikret" id="w">Tevfik Fikret</a> (1867–1915), were geared towards creating a Western-style &#34;<a href="/wiki/High_culture" id="w">high art</a>&#34; in Turkey. The poetry of the group—of which Tevfik Fikret and <a href="/wiki/Cen%C3%A2b_%C5%9Eeh%C3%A2bedd%C3%AEn" id="w">Cenâb Şehâbeddîn</a> (1870–1934) were the most influential proponents—was heavily influenced by the French Parnassian movement and the so-called &#34;<a href="/wiki/Decadence" id="w">Decadent</a>&#34; poets. The group&#39;s prose writers, on the other hand—particularly <a href="/wiki/Halid_Ziya_U%C5%9Fakl%C4%B1gil" id="w">Halid Ziya Uşaklıgil</a> (1867–1945)—were primarily influenced by Realism, although the writer Mehmed Rauf (1875–1931) did write the first Turkish example of a <a href="/wiki/Psychological_novel" id="w">psychological novel</a>, 1901&#39;s <i>Eylül</i> (ايلول; &#34;September&#34;). The language of the <i>Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde</i> movement remained strongly influenced by Ottoman Turkish.</p>
<p>In 1901, as a result of the article &#34;<i>Edebiyyât ve Hukuk</i>&#34; (ادبيات و ﺣﻘﻮق; &#34;Literature and Law&#34;), translated from French and published in <i>Servet-i Fünûn</i>, the pressure of <a href="/wiki/Censorship" id="w">censorship</a> was brought to bear and the magazine was closed down by the government of the Ottoman sultan <a href="/wiki/Abdul_Hamid_II" id="w">Abdülhamid II</a>. Though it was closed for only six months, the group&#39;s writers each went their own way in the meantime, and the <i>Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde</i> movement came to an end.</p>
<a id="The_Dawn_of_the_Future_movement" name="The_Dawn_of_the_Future_movement"></a><h3>The Dawn of the Future movement</h3>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/February_24" id="w">24 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1909" id="w">1909</a> edition of the <i>Servet-i Fünûn</i> magazine, a gathering of young writers—soon to be known as the <i>Fecr-i Âtî</i> (&#34;Dawn of the Future&#34;) group—released a <a href="/wiki/Manifesto" id="w">manifesto</a> in which they declared their opposition to the <i>Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde</i> movement and their adherence to the credo, &#34;<i>Sanat şahsî ve muhteremdir</i>&#34; (صنعت شخصى و محترمدر; &#34;Art is personal and sacred&#34;).<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Though this credo was little more than a variation of the French writer <a href="/wiki/Th%C3%A9ophile_Gautier" id="w">Théophile Gautier</a>&#39;s doctrine of &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/Art_for_art%26%2339%3Bs_sake" id="w">l&#39;art pour l&#39;art</a></i>&#34;, or &#34;art for art&#39;s sake&#34;, the group was nonetheless opposed to the blanket importation of Western forms and styles, and essentially sought to create a recognizably Turkish literature. The <i>Fecr-i Âtî</i> group, however, never made a clear and unequivocal declaration of its goals and principles, and so lasted only a few years before its adherents each went their own individual way. The two outstanding figures to emerge from the movement were, in poetry, <a href="/wiki/Ahmed_Ha%C5%9Fim" id="w">Ahmed Hâşim</a> (1884–1933), and in prose, <a href="/wiki/Yakup_Kadri_Karaosmano%C4%9Flu" id="w">Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu</a> (1889–1974).</p>

In 1908, Sultan Abdülhamid II had instituted a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" id="w">constitutional government</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Era_(Ottoman_Empire)" id="w">parliament</a> subsequently elected was composed almost entirely of members of the Committee of Union and Progress (also known as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Young_Turks" id="w">Young Turks</a>&#34;). The Young Turks (ژون تورکلر <i>Jön Türkler</i>) had opposed themselves to the increasingly <a href="/wiki/Authoritarianism" id="w">authoritarian</a> Ottoman government, and soon came to identify themselves with a specifically Turkish national identity. Along with this notion developed the idea of a Turkish and even <a href="/wiki/Pan-Turkism" id="w">pan-Turkish</a> <a href="/wiki/Nation" id="w">nation</a> (Turkish: <i>millet</i>), and so the literature of this period came to be known as &#34;National Literature&#34; (Turkish: <i>millî edebiyyât</i>). It was during this period that the Persian- and Arabic-inflected Ottoman Turkish language was definitively turned away from as a vehicle for written literature, and that literature began to assert itself as being specifically Turkish, rather than Ottoman.</p>
<p>At first, this movement crystallized around the magazine <i>Genç Kalemler</i> (کنج قلملر; &#34;Young Pens&#34;), which was begun in the city of <a href="/wiki/Thessaloniki" id="w">Selânik</a> in 1911 by the three writers who were most representative of the movement: <a href="/wiki/Ziya_G%C3%B6kalp" id="w">Ziya Gökalp</a> (1876–1924), a sociologist and thinker; <a href="/wiki/Ömer_Seyfettin" id="w">Ömer Seyfettin</a> (1884–1920), a short-story writer; and Ali Canip Yöntem (1887–1967), a poet. In <i>Genç Kalemler<b>s first issue, an article entitled &#34;New Language&#34; (Turkish: &#34;<i>Yeni Lisan</i>&#34;) pointed out that Turkish literature had previously looked for inspiration either to the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_world" id="w">East</a> as in the Ottoman Divan tradition, or to the <a href="/wiki/Western_world" id="w">West</a> as in the <i>Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde</i> and <i>Fecr-i Âtî</i> movements, without ever turning to Turkey itself.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> This latter was the National Literature movement&#39;s primary aim.</b></i></p>
<p>The intrinsically nationalistic character of <i>Genç Kalemler</i>, however, quickly took a decidedly <a href="/wiki/Chauvinism" id="w">chauvinistic</a> turn,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> and other writers—many of whom, like Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu, had been a part of the <i>Fecr-i Âtî</i> movement—began to emerge from within the matrix of the National Literature movement to counter this trend. Some of the more influential writers to come out of this less <a href="/wiki/Far_right" id="w">far-rightist</a> branch of the National Literature movement were the poet Mehmet Emin Yurdakul (1869–1944), the early <a href="/wiki/Feminism" id="w">feminist</a> novelist <a href="/wiki/Halide_Edip" id="w">Halide Edip Adıvar</a> (1884–1964), and the short-story writer and novelist Reşat Nuri Güntekin (1889–1956).</p>
<a id="Post-independence_literature" name="Post-independence_literature"></a><h2>Post-independence literature</h2>
<p>Following the Ottoman Empire&#39;s defeat in the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">First World War</a> of 1914–1918, the victorious <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I" id="w">Entente Powers</a> began the process of carving up the empire&#39;s lands and placing them under their own <a href="/wiki/Sphere_of_influence" id="w">spheres of influence</a>. In opposition to this process, the military leader <a href="/wiki/Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk" id="w">Mustafa Kemal</a> (1881–1938), in command of the growing <a href="/wiki/Turkish_National_Movement" id="w">Turkish national movement</a> whose roots lay partly in the Young Turks, organized the 1919–1923 <a href="/wiki/Turkish_War_of_Independence" id="w">Turkish War of Independence</a>. This war ended with the official ending of the Ottoman Empire, the expulsion of the Entente Powers, and the founding of the Republic of Turkey.</p>
<p>The literature of the new republic emerged largely from the pre-independence National Literature movement, with its roots simultaneously in the Turkish folk tradition and in the Western notion of progress. One important change to Turkish literature was enacted in 1928, when Mustafa Kemal initiated the creation and dissemination of a <a href="/wiki/Turkish_alphabet" id="w">modified version</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Latin_alphabet" id="w">Latin alphabet</a> to replace the Arabic-based Ottoman script. Over time, this change—together with changes in Turkey&#39;s system of education—would lead to more widespread <a href="/wiki/Literacy" id="w">literacy</a> in the country.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

Stylistically, the prose of the early years of the Republic of Turkey was essentially a continuation of the National Literature movement, with Realism and Naturalism predominating. This trend culminated in the 1932 novel <i>Yaban</i> (&#34;<i>The Wilds</i>&#34;), by Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu. This novel can be seen as the precursor to two trends that would soon develop:<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Social_realism" id="w">social realism</a>, and the &#34;village novel&#34; (<i>köy romanı</i>).</p>
<p>The social realist movement is perhaps best represented by the short-story writer <a href="/wiki/Sait_Faik" id="w">Sait Faik Abasıyanık</a> (1906–1954), whose work sensitively and realistically treats the lives of cosmopolitan Istanbul&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Working_class" id="w">lower classes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minority" id="w">ethnic minorities</a>, subjects which led to some criticism in the contemporary nationalistic atmosphere.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The tradition of the &#34;village novel&#34;, on the other hand, arose somewhat later. As its name suggests, the &#34;village novel&#34; deals, in a generally realistic manner, with life in the villages and small towns of Turkey. The major writers in this tradition are Kemal Tahir (1910–1973), Orhan Kemal (1914–1970), and Yaşar Kemal (1923– ). Yaşar Kemal, in particular, has earned fame outside of Turkey not only for his novels—many of which, such as 1955&#39;s <i>İnce Memed</i> (&#34;<i>Memed, My Hawk</i>&#34;), elevate local tales to the level of epic—but also for his firmly leftist political stance. In a very different tradition, but evincing a similar strong political viewpoint, was the <a href="/wiki/Satire" id="w">satirical</a> short-story writer <a href="/wiki/Aziz_Nesin" id="w">Aziz Nesin</a> (1915–1995).

Another novelist contemporary to, but outside of, the social realist and &#34;village novel&#34; traditions is <a href="/wiki/Ahmet_Hamdi_Tanpinar" id="w">Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar</a> (1901–1962). In addition to being an important <a href="/wiki/Essay" id="w">essayist</a> and poet, Tanpınar wrote a number of novels—such as <i>Huzur</i> (&#34;<i>Tranquillity</i>&#34;, 1949) and <i>Saatleri Ayarlama Enstitüsü</i> (&#34;<i>The Time Regulation Institute</i>&#34;, 1961)—which dramatize the clash between East and West in modern Turkish culture and society. Similar problems are explored by the novelist and short-story writer <a href="/wiki/O%C4%9Fuz_Atay" id="w">Oğuz Atay</a> (1934–1977). Unlike Tanpınar, however, Atay—in such works as his long novel <i><a href="/wiki/Tutunamayanlar" id="w">Tutunamayanlar</a></i> (&#34;<i>Losers</i>&#34;, 1971–1972) and his short story &#34;<i>Beyaz Mantolu Adam</i>&#34; (<a class="externallink" href="http://www.turkish-lit.boun.edu.tr/work.asp?CharSet=English&#38;ID=1452" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.turkish-lit.boun.edu.tr/work.asp?CharSet=English&#38;ID=1452">&#34;Man in a White Coat&#34;</a>, 1975)—wrote in a more <a href="/wiki/Modernist_literature" id="w">modernist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Existentialism" id="w">existentialist</a> vein. On the other hand, <a href="/wiki/Onat_Kutlar" id="w">Onat Kutlar</a>&#39;s <i>İshak</i> (&#34;<i>Isaac</i>&#34;, 1959), comprised of nine short stories which are written mainly from a child&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Point_of_view_(literature)" id="w">point of view</a> and are often surrealistic and mystical, represent a very early example of <a href="/wiki/Magic_realism" id="w">magic realism</a>.</p>
<p>The tradition of literary modernism also informs the work of novelist Adalet Ağaoğlu (1929– ). Her trilogy of novels collectively entitled <i>Dar Zamanlar</i> (&#34;<i>Tight Times</i>&#34;, 1973–1987), for instance, examines the changes that occurred in Turkish society between the 1930s and the 1980s in a formally and technically innovative style. <a href="/wiki/Orhan_Pamuk" id="w">Orhan Pamuk</a> (1952– ), winner of the 2006 <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature" id="w">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>, is another such innovative novelist, though his works—such as 1990&#39;s <i>Beyaz Kale</i> (&#34;<i><a href="/wiki/The_White_Castle" id="w">The White Castle</a></i>&#34;) and <i>Kara Kitap</i> (&#34;<i><a href="/wiki/The_Black_Book_(Orhan_Pamuk_novel)" id="w">The Black Book</a></i>&#34;) and 1998&#39;s <i>Benim Adım Kırmızı</i> (&#34;<i><a href="/wiki/My_Name_is_Red" id="w">My Name is Red</a></i>&#34;)—are influenced more by <a href="/wiki/Postmodern_literature" id="w">postmodernism</a> than by modernism. This is true also of <a href="/wiki/Latife_Tekin" id="w">Latife Tekin</a> (1957– ), whose first novel <i>Sevgili Arsız Ölüm</i> (&#34;<i>Dear Shameless Death</i>&#34;, 1983) shows the influence not only of postmodernism, but also of magic realism.</p>
<a id="Poetry" name="Poetry"></a><h3>Poetry</h3>
<p>{{Main}}
In the early years of the Republic of Turkey, there were a number of poetic trends. Authors such as Ahmed Hâşim and Yahyâ Kemâl Beyatlı (1884–1958) continued to write important formal verse whose language was, to a great extent, a continuation of the late Ottoman tradition. By far the majority of the poetry of the time, however, was in the tradition of the folk-inspired &#34;syllabist&#34; movement (<i>Beş Hececiler</i>), which had emerged from the National Literature movement and which tended to express <a href="/wiki/Patriotism" id="w">patriotic</a> themes couched in the syllabic meter associated with Turkish folk poetry.</p>
<p>The first radical step away from this trend was taken by <a href="/wiki/Naz%C4%B1m_Hikmet" id="w">Nâzım Hikmet Ran</a>, who—during his time as a student in the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> from 1921 to 1924—was exposed to the modernist poetry of <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Mayakovsky" id="w">Vladimir Mayakovsky</a> and others, which inspired him to start writing verse in a less formal style. At this time, he wrote the poem &#34;<i>Açların Gözbebekleri</i>&#34; (&#34;Pupils of the Hungry&#34;), which introduced <a href="/wiki/Free_verse" id="w">free verse</a> into the Turkish language for, essentially, the first time.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Much of Nâzım Hikmet&#39;s poetry subsequent to this breakthrough would continue to be written in free verse, though his work exerted little influence for some time due largely to <a href="/wiki/Censorship" id="w">censorship</a> of his work owing to his <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">Communist</a> political stance, which also led to his spending several years in prison. Over time, in such books as <i>Simavne Kadısı Oğlu Şeyh Bedreddin Destanı</i> (&#34;<i>The Epic of Shaykh Bedreddin, Son of Judge Simavne</i>&#34;, 1936) and <i>Memleketimden İnsan Manzaraları</i> (&#34;<i>Human Landscapes from My Country</i>&#34;, 1939), he developed a voice simultaneously proclamatory and subtle.
<div style="wigth:125px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:125px-Garip.jpg" title="&#39;&#39;Garip&#39;&#39; (1941) revolutionized modern Turkish poetry"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/125px-Garip.jpg" alt="&#39;&#39;Garip&#39;&#39; (1941) revolutionized modern Turkish poetry" title="&#39;&#39;Garip&#39;&#39; (1941) revolutionized modern Turkish poetry" class="location-left type-thumb" width="125px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption"><i>Garip</i> (1941) revolutionized modern Turkish poetry</div></div>

Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the publication of a small volume of verse preceded by an essay and entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Garip" id="w">Garip</a></i> (&#34;<i>Strange</i>&#34;). The authors were <a href="/wiki/Orhan_Veli" id="w">Orhan Veli Kanık</a> (1914–1950), Melih Cevdet Anday (1915–2002), and <a href="/wiki/Oktay_Rifat" id="w">Oktay Rifat</a> (1914–1988). Explicitly opposing themselves to everything that had gone in poetry before, they sought instead to create a popular art, &#34;to explore the people&#39;s tastes, to determine them, and to make them reign supreme over art&#34;.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> To this end, and inspired in part by contemporary French poets like <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Pr%C3%A9vert" id="w">Jacques Prévert</a>, they employed not only a variant of the free verse introduced by Nâzım Hikmet, but also highly <a href="/wiki/Colloquialism" id="w">colloquial language</a>, and wrote primarily about mundane daily subjects and the ordinary man on the street. The reaction was immediate and polarized: most of the <a href="/wiki/Academia" id="w">academic establishment</a> and older poets vilified them, while much of the Turkish population embraced them wholeheartedly. Though the movement itself lasted only ten years—until Orhan Veli&#39;s death in 1950, after which Melih Cevdet Anday and Oktay Rifat moved on to other styles—its effect on Turkish poetry continues to be felt today.</p>
<p>Just as the Garip movement was a reaction against earlier poetry, so—in the 1950s and afterwards—was there a reaction against the Garip movement. The poets of this movement, soon known as <i>İkinci Yeni</i> (&#34;Second New&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>), opposed themselves to the social aspects prevalent in the poetry of Nâzım Hikmet and the Garip poets, and instead—partly inspired by the disruption of language in such Western movements as <a href="/wiki/Dada" id="w">Dada</a> and <a href="/wiki/Surrealism" id="w">Surrealism</a>—sought to create a more abstract poetry through the use of jarring and unexpected language, complex images, and the association of ideas. To some extent, the movement can be seen as bearing some of the characteristics of postmodern literature. The most well-known poets writing in the &#34;Second New&#34; vein were Turgut Uyar (1927–1985), Edip Cansever (1928–1986), <a href="/wiki/Cemal_S%C3%BCreya" id="w">Cemal Süreya</a> (1931–1990), Ece Ayhan (1931–2002), Sezai Karakoç (1933- ) and <a href="/wiki/Ilhan_Berk" id="w">İlhan Berk</a> (1918– ).</p>
<p>Outside of the Garip and &#34;Second New&#34; movements also, a number of significant poets have flourished, such as Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca (1914– ), who wrote poems dealing with fundamental concepts like life, death, God, time, and the cosmos; Behçet Necatigil (1916–1979), whose somewhat <a href="/wiki/Allegory" id="w">allegorical</a> poems explore the significance of <a href="/wiki/Middle_class" id="w">middle-class</a> daily life; Can Yücel (1926–1999), who—in addition to his own highly colloquial and varied poetry—was also a translator into Turkish of a variety of world literature; and <a href="/wiki/Ismet_%C3%96zel" id="w">İsmet Özel</a> (1944– ), whose early poetry was highly <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" id="w">leftist</a> but whose poetry since the 1970s has shown a strong <a href="/wiki/Mysticism" id="w">mystical</a> and even <a href="/wiki/Islamism" id="w">Islamist</a> influence.</p>
