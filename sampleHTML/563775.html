<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>

<p>Many <a href="/wiki/Australian_Aborigine" id="w">Aboriginal</a> people lived around the site of Mildura because of the abundant food. Local tribes included the <a href="/wiki/Latje_Latje" id="w">Latje Latje</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yerre_Yerre" id="w">Yerre Yerre</a>. Europeans noticed this abundance and decided to harness it, so they brought sheep to graze the natural pastures.

<p>A major <a href="/wiki/Drought_in_Australia" id="w">drought</a> in Victoria from 1877 to 1884 prompted <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Deakin" id="w">Alfred Deakin</a>, then a minister in the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_Victoria" id="w">State Government</a> and chairman of a <a href="/wiki/Royal_Commission" id="w">Royal Commission</a> on water supply to visit the <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" id="w">irrigation</a> areas of California.  There he met <a href="/wiki/George_Chaffey" id="w">George</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Chaffey" id="w">William Chaffey</a>. </p>
<p>In 1886 George Chaffey came to Australia and selected a derelict sheep station at Mildura as the site for his first irrigation settlement signing an agreement with the Victorian government to spend at least £300,000 on permanent improvements at Mildura in the next twenty years.<sup id="_ref-WChaffeyADB"_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WChaffeyADB"" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>After much political wrangling, the settlement of Mildura was established in 1887. It was named after the Mildura sheep station that provided most of the land. The name is of Aboriginal origin, and means either &#34;red sand&#34; or &#34;sore eyes&#34; <sup id="_ref-smhtravelmildura_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-smhtravelmildura" title="">[2]</a></sup>.

The number of Aboriginal people started to decrease {{Fact}}.</p>
<p>In the 1890s came the scourge of the <a href="/wiki/Rabbits_in_Australia" id="w">rabbit</a>. This devastated the <a href="/wiki/Sheep" id="w">sheep</a> farmers, especially south of the Murray. There was also a financial recession at this time. Combined, these factors restricted growth of the new settlement.</p>
<p>After this period, the new settlement grew and grew. It was soon the main town of the district. Suburbs and new satellite towns sprang up. In 1934 it officially became a city <sup id="_ref-smhtravelmildura_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-smhtravelmildura" title="">[2]</a></sup>. Today, Mildura is a bright, thriving regional centre, and the surrounding Sunraysia district has a population of over 50,000.</p>

<a id="Nowingi_toxic_waste_proposal" name="Nowingi_toxic_waste_proposal"></a><h1>Nowingi toxic waste proposal</h1>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a> there was a controversial proposal by the <a href="/wiki/Victorian_Government" id="w">Victorian Government</a> to build a state-level Long Term Containment Facility (LTCF) for Industrial Waste in <a href="/wiki/Nowingi%2C_Victoria" id="w">Nowingi</a>, approximately 50 km south of Mildura. The site is a small enclave of <a href="/wiki/State_forest" id="w">state forest</a> surrounded by <a href="/wiki/National_park" id="w">national park</a>, and contains habitat important to a number of threatened species. </p>
<p>Its hydrological composition is disputed, the Environmental Effects Statement (EES) investigations and subsequent evidence predicted that contaminated moisture would take greater than 1000 years to move though the LTCF barrier system. Transport modelling of groundwater contaminants predicted that if contaminants did enter the groundwater, they would move slowly through the Blanchetown Clay and then in a westerly to north-westerly direction towards the Raak Plains, taking thousands of years to finally discharge within the Raak Boinkas in the <a href="/wiki/Murray-Sunset_National_Park" id="w">Murray-Sunset National Park</a>, while local opponents claimed it would flow east through <a href="/wiki/Hattah-Kulkyne_National_Park" id="w">Hattah-Kulkyne National Park</a> into the <a href="/wiki/Murray_River" id="w">Murray River</a>.</p>
<p>The site is around 500 km away from <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" id="w">Melbourne</a>, where most of the waste is generated.  Local opponents to the LTCF argued that transporting the waste will incur higher costs and create more opportunity for accident than a LTCF closer to Melbourne.</p>
<p>Local opponents, a group called &#34;Save the Food Bowl Alliance&#34; and local media branded the LTCF the &#34;Mallee Toxic Waste Dump&#34;.  The chairman of the &#34;Save the Food Bowl Alliance&#34;, Peter Crisp, was elected to Victorian Parliament in 2006, campaigning on this issue.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Grape vines growing in Mildura during December 2006.</div>
In January <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, the Victorian Government announced that it was abandoning its proposal to build the Long Term Containment Facility at Nowingi.  </p>
<p>It could be argued that its reasoning was that enabling legislation would have had trouble passing both houses of Parliament, with the <a href="/wiki/Steve_Bracks" id="w">Bracks</a> <a href="/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" id="w">Labor</a> Government losing control of the reformed <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Council" id="w">Legislative Council</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Victorian_legislative_election%2C_2006" id="w">2006 State Election</a>.  The parties holding the balance of power in the Legislative Council - the <a href="/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia" id="w">Nationals</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Greens" id="w">Australian Greens</a> and <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" id="w">Liberals</a> all stating during the election campaign their opposition to the LTCF.  </p>
<p>The Panel Inquiry report found the proposal to be environmentally feasible but recommended against granting approval on strategic planning grounds.  Specifically because it:
• Could fill too soon to provide a sustainable solution for Victoria’s Category B wastes;
• Cannot be reasonably or readily expanded because of its surrounds;
• Would be between two National Parks;
• Would be located in high conservation value remnant vegetation which is habitat of threatened species;
• Would be too distant from waste producers; and
• Would be as a lesser but relevant consideration, constrained by the need to suspend construction during the breeding period of Mallee Emu-wren and Malleefowl.</p>
<p>The abandoning of the LTCF proposal was received with jubilation by opponents of the LTCF not only in the Mildura area and elsewhere in Victoria, but also across the border in <a href="/wiki/South_Australia" id="w">South Australia</a> where there were fears that in reputation, if not in substance, the toxic waste could effect the water supply via the <a href="/wiki/Murray_River" id="w">Murray River</a> and thereby the fruit-growing industries of the <a href="/wiki/Riverland" id="w">Riverland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Murraylands" id="w">Murraylands</a>. </p> 
<p>The Mildura Rural City Council and residents spent almost $2 million fighting the Government&#39;s proposal for the LTCF at Nowingi.  On <a href="/wiki/10_January" id="w">10 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> the Victorian Government did not rule out some form of reimbursement for the <a href="/wiki/Rural_City_of_Mildura" id="w">Rural City of Mildura</a> council&#39;s legal and other costs in opposing the LTCF.  &#34;The general rule is that people bear their own costs, that is most likely to apply in this case ... but I&#39;ve indicated and I am prepared to talk to the council and mayor about the whole issue of how Mildura moves forward and I&#39;ll do that,&#34; John Thwaites said.<sup id="_ref-REIMBURSE-2M-MILDURA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-REIMBURSE-2M-MILDURA" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
