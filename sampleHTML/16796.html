</p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>Since the discovery of Pluto, many have speculated that it might not be alone. The region now called the Kuiper belt had been hypothesized in various forms for decades. It was only in 1992 that the first direct evidence for its existence was found. The number and variety of prior speculations on the nature of the Kuiper belt have led to continued uncertainty as to who deserves credit for first proposing it.</p>  
<p>The first <a href="/wiki/Astronomer" id="w">astronomer</a> to suggest the existence of a trans-Neptunian population was <a href="/wiki/Frederick_C._Leonard" id="w">Frederick C. Leonard</a>. In 1930, soon after Pluto&#39;s discovery, he pondered whether it was &#34;not likely that in Pluto there has come to light the <i>first</i> of a <i>series</i> of ultra-Neptunian bodies, the remaining members of which still await discovery but which are destined eventually to be detected&#34;.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Astronomer <a href="/wiki/Gerard_Kuiper" id="w">Gerard Kuiper</a>, after whom the Kuiper belt is named</div>
In 1943, in the <i>Journal of the British Astronomical Association</i>, <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Edgeworth" id="w">Kenneth Edgeworth</a> hypothesised that, in the region beyond <a href="/wiki/Neptune" id="w">Neptune</a>, the material within the primordial <a href="/wiki/Solar_nebula" id="w">solar nebula</a> was too widely spaced to condense into planets, and so rather condensed into a myriad of smaller bodies. From this he concluded that “the outer region of the solar system, beyond the orbits of the planets, is occupied by a very large number of comparatively small bodies&#34;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> and that, from time to time, one of their number &#34;wanders from its own sphere and appears as an occasional visitor to the inner solar system,”<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  becoming what we call a <a href="/wiki/Comet" id="w">comet</a>.   </p>
<p>In 1951, in an article for the journal <i>Astrophysics</i>, <a href="/wiki/Gerard_Kuiper" id="w">Gerard Kuiper</a> speculated on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System&#39;s evolution, however, he did not believe that such a belt still existed today. Kuiper was operating on the assumption common in his time, that <a href="/wiki/Pluto" id="w">Pluto</a> was the size of the Earth, and had therefore scattered these bodies out toward the Oort cloud or out of the Solar System. By Kuiper&#39;s formulation, there would not be a Kuiper belt where we now see it.<sup id="_ref-Jewitt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jewitt" title="">[12]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The hypothesis took many other forms in the following decades: in 1962, physicist <a href="/wiki/Alastair_GW_Cameron" id="w">Al G.W. Cameron</a> postulated the existence of “a tremendous mass of small material on the outskirts of the solar system,”<sup id="_ref-Davies2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davies2" title="">[13]</a></sup> while in 1964, <a href="/wiki/Fred_Whipple" id="w">Fred Whipple</a>, who popularised the famous &#34;<a href="/wiki/Dirty_snowball" id="w">dirty snowball</a>&#34; hypothesis for cometary structure, thought that a &#34;comet belt&#34; might be massive enough to cause the purported discrepancies in the orbit of <a href="/wiki/Uranus" id="w">Uranus</a> that had sparked the search for <a href="/wiki/Planet_X" id="w">Planet X</a>, or at the very least, to affect the orbits of known comets.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Observation, however, ruled out this hypothesis.<sup id="_ref-Davies2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davies2" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1977, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Kowal" id="w">Charles Kowal</a> discovered <a href="/wiki/2060_Chiron" id="w">2060 Chiron</a>, an icy planetoid with an orbit between Saturn and Uranus. He used a <a href="/wiki/Blink_comparator" id="w">blink comparator</a>; the same device that had allowed <a href="/wiki/Clyde_Tombaugh" id="w">Clyde Tombaugh</a> to discover <a href="/wiki/Pluto" id="w">Pluto</a> nearly 50 years before.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>  In 1992, another object <a href="/wiki/5145_Pholus" id="w">5145 Pholus</a>, was discovered in a similar orbit.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, the <a href="/wiki/Centaur_(planetoid)" id="w">centaurs</a>, is known to exist in the region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs&#39; orbits are unstable over periods longer than roughly 100 million years, a relatively short span when compared to the age of the Solar System. From the time of Chiron&#39;s discovery, astronomers  speculated that they therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Further evidence for the belt&#39;s existence later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their <a href="/wiki/Volatility_(physics)" id="w">volatile</a> surfaces to sublimate into space, eating them gradually away. In order to still be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be frequently replenished.<sup id="_ref-matter_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-matter" title="">[18]</a></sup> One such area of replenishment is the <a href="/wiki/Oort_cloud" id="w">Oort cloud</a>; the spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_unit" id="w">AU</a> from the Sun first hypothesised by astronomer <a href="/wiki/Jan_Oort" id="w">Jan Oort</a> in 1950.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> It is believed to be the point of origin for <a href="/wiki/Long_period_comet" id="w">long period comets</a>, those, like <a href="/wiki/Hale-Bopp" id="w">Hale-Bopp</a>, with orbits lasting thousands of years. </p>
<p>There is however another comet population, known as <a href="/wiki/Short-period_comet" id="w">short period</a> or <a href="/wiki/Periodic_comet" id="w">periodic comets</a>; those with orbits lasting less than 200 years. By the 1970s, the rate at which short-period comets were being discovered was becoming increasingly inconsistent with them having emerged solely from the <a href="/wiki/Oort_cloud" id="w">Oort cloud</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> For an Oort cloud object to become a short-period comet, it would first have to be captured by the giant planets. In 1980, in the monthly notice of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Astronomical_Society" id="w">Royal Astronomical Society</a>, <a href="/wiki/Julio_Fernandez_(astronomer)" id="w">Julio Fernandez</a> stated that for every short period comet to be sent into the inner solar system from the Oort cloud, 600 would have to be ejected into interstellar space. He speculated that a comet belt from between 35 and 50 <a href="/wiki/Astronomical_Unit" id="w">AU</a> would be required to account for the observed number of comets.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Following up on Fernandez&#39;s work, in 1988 the Canadian team of Martin Duncan, Tom Quinn and <a href="/wiki/Scott_Tremaine" id="w">Scott Tremaine</a> ran a number of computer simulations to determine if all observed comets could have arrived from the Oort cloud. They found that the Oort cloud could not account for short-period comets, particularly as short-period comets are clustered near the plane of the Solar System, whereas Oort cloud comets tend to arrive from any point in the sky. With a belt as Fernandez described it added to the formulations, the simulations matched observations.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>  Reportedly because the words &#34;Kuiper&#34; and &#34;comet belt&#34; appeared in the opening sentence of Fernandez&#39;s paper, Tremaine named this region the &#34;Kuiper belt.&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

Today, CCDs form the basis for most astronomical detectors.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> In 1988, Jewitt moved to the Institute of Astronomy at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Hawaii" id="w">University of Hawaii</a>. He was later joined by Jane Luu to work at the University of Hawaii’s 2.24 m telescope at Mauna Kea.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Eventually, the field of view for CCDs had increased to 1024 by 1024 pixels, which allowed searches to be conducted far more rapidly.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Finally, after five years of searching, on <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1992" id="w">1992</a>, Jewitt and Luu announced the &#34;Discovery of the candidate Kuiper belt object&#34; {{mpl}};<sup id="_ref-qbee_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-qbee" title="">[24]</a></sup> Six months later, they discovered a second object in the region, 1993 FW.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Name" name="Name"></a><h2>Name</h2>
<p>Astronomers sometimes use alternative name <b>Edgeworth-Kuiper belt</b> to credit Edgeworth, and KBOs are occasionally referred to as EKOs.

<p>Since the year 2000, a number of KBOs with diameters of between 500 and 1200 km (about half that of Pluto) have been discovered. <a href="/wiki/50000_Quaoar" id="w">50000 Quaoar</a>, a classical KBO discovered in 2002, is over 1200 km across. {{mpl}} (nicknamed &#34;Easterbunny&#34;) and {{mpl}} (nicknamed &#34;Santa&#34;), both announced on <a href="/wiki/29_July" id="w">29 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, are larger still. Other objects, such as <a href="/wiki/28978_Ixion" id="w">28978 Ixion</a> (discovered in 2001) and <a href="/wiki/20000_Varuna" id="w">20000 Varuna</a> (discovered in 2000) measure roughly 500 km across.<sup id="_ref-beyond_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beyond" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="Pluto" name="Pluto"></a><h2>Pluto</h2>
<p>The discovery of these large KBOs in similar orbits to Pluto led many to conclude that, bar its relative size, <a href="/wiki/Pluto" id="w">Pluto</a> was not particularly different from other members of the Kuiper belt. Not only did these objects approach Pluto in size, but many also possessed satellites, and were of similar composition (methane and carbon monoxide have been found both on Pluto and on the largest KBOs<sup id="_ref-beyond_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beyond" title="">[4]</a></sup>). <a href="/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)" id="w">Ceres</a> was considered a planet before the discovery of its fellow <a href="/wiki/Asteroid" id="w">asteroids</a>, and, based on this precedent, many astronomers concluded that Pluto should also be reclassified.</p>
<p>The issue was brought to a head by the discovery of <a href="/wiki/Eris_(dwarf_planet)" id="w">Eris</a>, an object in the <a href="/wiki/Scattered_disc" id="w">scattered disc</a> far beyond the Kuiper belt, that is now known to be 27 percent more massive than Pluto.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> In response, the <a href="/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union" id="w">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU), was forced to <a href="/wiki/Definition_of_planet" id="w">define a planet</a> for the first time, and in so doing included in their definition that a planet must have &#34;<a href="/wiki/Clearing_the_neighborhood" id="w">cleared the neighbourhood</a> around its orbit.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> As Pluto shared its orbit with so many KBOs, it was deemed not to have cleared its orbit, and was thus reclassified from a planet to a member of the Kuiper belt. </p>
<p>Though Pluto is the largest KBO, a number of objects outside the Kuiper belt which may have begun their lives as KBOs are larger. Eris is the most obvious example, but Neptune&#39;s moon <a href="/wiki/Triton_(moon)" id="w">Triton</a>, which, as explained above, is probably a captured KBO, is also larger than Pluto.</p>
<p>As of 2007, only three objects in the Solar System, Ceres, Pluto and Eris, are considered dwarf planets. However, a number of other Kuiper belt objects are also large enough to be spherical and could be classified as dwarf planets in the future.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Satellites" name="Satellites"></a><h2>Satellites</h2>
<p>Of the four largest TNOs, three (Eris, Pluto, and <a href="/wiki/2003_EL61" id="w">2003 EL61</a>) possess satellites, and two have more than one.

The precise origins of the Kuiper belt and its complex structure are still unclear, and astronomers are awaiting the completion of the <a href="/wiki/Pan-STARRS" id="w">Pan-STARRS</a> survey telescope, which should reveal many currently unknown KBOs, to determine more about this.<sup id="_ref-beyond_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beyond" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Kuiper belt is believed to consist of <a href="/wiki/Planetesimals" id="w">planetesimals</a>; fragments from the original <a href="/wiki/Protoplanetary_disc" id="w">protoplanetary disc</a> around the <a href="/wiki/Sun" id="w">Sun</a> that failed to fully coalesce into planets and instead formed into smaller bodies, the largest less than 3000 km in diameter. </p>
<p>Modern <a href="/wiki/Computer" id="w">computer</a> <a href="/wiki/Simulation" id="w">simulations</a> show the Kuiper belt to have been strongly influenced by <a href="/wiki/Jupiter_(planet)" id="w">Jupiter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neptune" id="w">Neptune</a>, and  also suggest that neither <a href="/wiki/Uranus" id="w">Uranus</a> nor <a href="/wiki/Neptune" id="w">Neptune</a> could have formed <i>in situ</i> beyond Saturn, as too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are believed to have formed closer to Jupiter, but to have been flung outwards during the course of the Solar System&#39;s early evolution. Work in 1984 by Fernandez and Ip suggests that exchange of <a href="/wiki/Angular_momentum" id="w">angular momentum</a> with the scattered objects can cause the planets to drift.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>   Eventually, the orbits shifted to the point where Jupiter and Saturn existed in an exact 2:1 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The gravitational pull from such a resonance ultimately disrupted the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, causing them to switch places and for Neptune to travel outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, sending it into temporary chaos.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> As Neptune traveled outward, it excited and scattered many TNOs into higher and more eccentric orbits.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>

<p>At its fullest extent, including its outlying regions, the Kuiper belt stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. However, the main body of the belt  is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 resonance (<a href="/wiki/#Resonances" id="w">see below</a>) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The Kuiper belt is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the <a href="/wiki/Ecliptic_plane" id="w">ecliptic plane</a> and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a <a href="/wiki/Torus" id="w">torus</a> or doughnut than a belt.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>

The presence of <a href="/wiki/Neptune" id="w">Neptune</a> has a profound effect on the Kuiper belt&#39;s structure due to <a href="/wiki/Orbital_resonance" id="w">orbital resonances</a>. Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, Neptune&#39;s gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects which happen to lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System or out into the <a href="/wiki/Scattered_disc" id="w">Scattered disc</a> or interstellar space. This causes the Kuiper belt to possess pronounced gaps in its current layout, similar to the <a href="/wiki/Kirkwood_gap" id="w">Kirkwood gaps</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Asteroid_belt" id="w">Asteroid belt</a>. In the region between 40 and 42 AU, for instance, no objects can retain a stable orbit over such times, and any observed in that region must have migrated there relatively recently.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup>  </p>
<a id="Classical_belt" name="Classical_belt"></a><h2>Classical belt</h2>

Between ~42 ~48 AU, however, the gravitational influence of Neptune is negligible, and objects can exist with their orbits pretty much unmolested. This region is known as the <a href="/wiki/Classical_Kuiper_belt_object" id="w">classical Kuiper belt</a>, and its members comprise roughly two thirds of KBOs observed to date.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup>  Because the first modern KBO discovered, <a href="/wiki/1992_QB1" id="w">1992 QB1</a>, is considered the prototype of this group, classical KBOs are often referred to as <a href="/wiki/Cubewanos" id="w">cubewanos</a> (&#34;Q-B-1-os&#34;).<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>The classical Kuiper belt appears to be a composite of two separate populations. The first, known as &#34;dynamically cold&#34; population, has orbits much like the planets; nearly circular, with an <a href="/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity" id="w">orbital eccentricity</a> of less than 0.1, and with relatively low inclinations up to about 10° (they lie close to the plane of the Solar System rather than at an angle). The second, the &#34;dynamically hot&#34; population, has orbits much more inclined to the ecliptic, by up to 30°. The two populations have been named this way not because of any major difference in temperature, but from analogy to particles in a gas, which increase their relative velocity as they become heated up.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> The two populations not only possess different orbits, but different compositions; the cold population is markedly redder than the hot, suggesting it formed in a different region. The hot population is believed to have formed near Jupiter, and to have been ejected out by movements among the gas giants. The cold population, on the other hand, is believed to have formed more or less in its current position although it may  also have been later swept outwards by Neptune during its migration.<sup id="_ref-beyond_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beyond" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>

When an object&#39;s orbital period is an exact ratio of Neptune&#39;s (a situation called a <a href="/wiki/Orbital_resonance" id="w">mean motion resonance</a>), then it can become locked in a synchronised motion with Neptune and avoid being perturbed away if their relative alignments are appropriate. If, for instance, an object is in just the right kind of orbit so that it orbits the Sun two times for every three Neptune orbits, then whenever it returns to its original position, Neptune will always be half an orbit away from it, since it will have completed 1½ orbits in the same time. This is known as the 2:3 (or 3:2) resonance, and it corresponds to a characteristic <a href="/wiki/Semi-major_axis" id="w">semi-major axis</a> of ~39.4AU. This 2:3 resonance is populated by about 200 known objects,<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup>  including <a href="/wiki/Pluto" id="w">Pluto</a> together with its moons. In recognition of this, the other members of this family are known as <a href="/wiki/Plutinos" id="w">Plutinos</a>.  Many Plutinos, including Pluto, often have orbits which cross that of Neptune, though their resonance means they can never collide. Many others, such as <a href="/wiki/90482_Orcus" id="w">90482 Orcus</a> and <a href="/wiki/28978_Ixion" id="w">28978 Ixion</a>, are over half of Pluto&#39;s size.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-albedo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-albedo" title="">[52]</a></sup> Plutinos have high orbital eccentricities, suggesting that they are not native to their current positions but were instead thrown haphazardly into their orbits by the migrating Neptune.<sup id="_ref-trojan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trojan" title="">[53]</a></sup>  The 1:2 resonance (whose objects complete half an orbit for each of Neptune&#39;s) corresponds to semi-major axes of ~47.7AU, and is sparsely populated.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> Its residents are sometimes referred to as <a href="/wiki/Twotino" id="w">twotinos</a>.

<p>Additionally, there is a relative absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU which cannot apparently be explained by the present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>

The 1:2 resonance appears to be an edge beyond which few objects are known. It is not clear whether it is actually the outer edge of the Classical belt or just the beginning of a broad gap. Objects have been detected at the 2:5 resonance  at roughly 55 AU, well outside the classical belt; however, predictions of a large number of bodies in classical orbits between these resonances have not been verified through observation.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>

Bernstein and Trilling et al. have found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100&#160;km or more in radius beyond 50 AU is real, and not due to observational bias.

The scattered disc is a sparsely populated region beyond the Kuiper belt, extending as far as 100 AU and farther. <a href="/wiki/Scattered_disc_object" id="w">Scattered disc objects</a> (SDOs) travel in highly elliptical orbits, usually also highly inclined to the ecliptic. Most models of solar system formation show icy planetoids first forming in the Kuiper belt, while later gravitational interactions, particularly with Neptune, displaced some of them outwards into the scattered disc. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Minor_Planet_Center" id="w">Minor Planet Center</a>, which officially catalogues all trans-Neptunian objects, a KBO, strictly speaking, is any object that orbits exclusively within the defined Kuiper belt region regardless of origin or composition. Objects found outside the belt are classed as scattered objects.<sup id="_ref-scattered_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scattered" title="">[61]</a></sup> However, in some scientific circles the term &#34;Kuiper belt object&#34; has become synonymous with any icy planetoid native to the outer solar system believed to have been part of that initial class, even if its orbit during the bulk of solar system history has been beyond the Kuiper belt (e.g. in the scattered disk region).

During its period of migration, Neptune is thought to have captured one of the larger KBOs and set it in orbit around itself. This is its moon <a href="/wiki/Triton_(moon)" id="w">Triton</a>, which is the only large moon in the Solar System to have a <a href="/wiki/Retrograde_orbit" id="w">retrograde orbit</a>; it orbits in the opposite direction to Neptune&#39;s rotation. This suggests that, unlike the large moons of Jupiter and Saturn, which are thought to have coalesced from spinning discs of material encircling their young parent planets, Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy; it requires that some force act upon the object to slow it down enough to be snared by the larger object&#39;s gravity. How this happened to Triton is not well understood, though it does suggest that Triton formed as part of a large population of similar objects whose gravity could impede its motion enough to be captured.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> Triton is only slightly larger than Pluto, and spectral analysis of both worlds shows that they are largely composed of similar materials, such as <a href="/wiki/Methane" id="w">methane</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide" id="w">carbon monoxide</a>.

Comets in the solar system can be loosely divided into two categories: short-period and long period. Long period comets are believed to originate in the <a href="/wiki/Oort_cloud" id="w">Oort cloud</a>. There are two recognised categories of short-period comets: Jupiter-family comets and Halley-family comets. The latter group, which is named for its prototype, <a href="/wiki/Halley%26%2339%3Bs_Comet" id="w">Halley&#39;s Comet</a>, are believed to have emerged from the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets.<sup id="_ref-matter_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-matter" title="">[18]</a></sup> It is the former type, the Jupiter family, that are believed to have originated from the Kuiper belt (technically, because the scattered disc is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt proper is mostly dynamically stable, the vast majority of Jupiter family comets are believed to have originated in the scattered disc, but since scattered disc objects are thought to have originally been KBOs, the Jupiter family&#39;s ultimate origin remains the Kuiper belt).<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> </p>

<p>Studies of the Kuiper belt since its discovery have generally indicated that its members are primarily composed of ices; a mixture of light hydrocarbons (such as <a href="/wiki/Methane" id="w">methane</a>), <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" id="w">ammonia</a>, and water <a href="/wiki/Ice" id="w">ice</a>, a composition they share with <a href="/wiki/Comets" id="w">comets</a>.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup>  The temperature of the belt is only about 50K,<sup id="_ref-Quaoar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Quaoar" title="">[68]</a></sup> so many compounds that would remain gaseous closer to the Sun are solid. </p> 
<p>Due to their small size and extreme distance from Earth, the chemical makeup of KBOs is very difficult to determine. The principal method by which astronomers determine the composition of a celestial object is <a href="/wiki/Spectroscopy" id="w">spectroscopy</a>. When an object&#39;s light is broken into its component colours, an image akin to a rainbow is formed. This image is called a <a href="/wiki/Spectrum" id="w">spectrum</a>. Different substances absorb light at different wavelengths, and when the spectrum for a specific object is unravelled, dark lines (called <a href="/wiki/Absorption_line" id="w">absorption lines</a>) appear where the substances within it have absorbed that particular wavelength of light. Every <a href="/wiki/Element_(chemistry)" id="w">element</a> or <a href="/wiki/Compound_(chemistry)" id="w">compound</a> has its own unique spectroscopic signature, and by reading an object&#39;s full spectral &#34;fingerprint&#34;, astronomers can determine what it is made of.</p>
<p>Initially, such detailed analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup, primarily their colour.<sup id="_ref-KBOKBO_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KBOKBO" title="">[69]</a></sup> These first data showed a broad range of colours among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red.<sup id="_ref-colour_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colour" title="">[70]</a></sup>  This suggested that their surfaces were composed of a wide range of compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons.<sup id="_ref-colour_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-colour" title="">[70]</a></sup> This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of their volatile ices to the effects of cosmic rays.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing.<sup id="_ref-KBOKBO_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KBOKBO" title="">[69]</a></sup> However, Jewitt and Luu&#39;s spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in colour was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>

<p>Water ice has been detected in several KBOs, including <a href="/wiki/1996_TO66" id="w">1996 TO66</a>,<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/38628_Huya" id="w">2000 EB173</a> and <a href="/wiki/2000_WR106" id="w">2000 WR106</a>.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> In 2004, Mike Brown <i>et al</i> determined the existence of crystalline water ice and <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" id="w">ammonia</a> <a href="/wiki/Hydrate" id="w">hydrate</a> on one of the largest known KBOs, <a href="/wiki/50000_Quaoar" id="w">50000 Quaoar</a>.

Despite its vast extent, the collective mass of the Kuiper belt is relatively low; estimated at roughly a tenth the mass of the Earth.<sup id="_ref-beyond_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beyond" title="">[4]</a></sup> Conversely, models of the Solar System&#39;s formation predict a collective mass for the Kuiper belt of 30 Earth masses.<sup id="_ref-beyond_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beyond" title="">[4]</a></sup> This missing &#62;99% of the mass can hardly be dismissed, as it is required for the accretion of any KBOs larger than 100&#160;km in diameter. At the current low density, these objects simply should not exist. Moreover, the eccentricity and inclination of current orbits makes the encounters quite &#34;violent,&#34; resulting in destruction rather than accretion. 
It appears that either the current residents of the Kuiper belt have been created closer to the Sun or some mechanism dispersed the original mass. Neptune’s influence is too weak to explain such a massive &#34;vacuuming&#34;. While the question remains open, the conjectures vary from a passing star scenario to grinding of smaller objects, via collisions, into dust small enough to be affected by solar radiation.<sup id="_ref-Morbidelli 2005_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Morbidelli 2005" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bright objects are rare compared with the dominant dim population, as expected from accretion models of origin, given that only some objects of a given size would have grown further. This relationship N(D), the population expressed as a function of the diameter, referred to as brightness slope, has been confirmed by observations. The slope is inversely proportional to some power of the diameter D.

<p>Less formally, there is for instance 8 (=2³) times more objects in 100–200&#160;km range than objects in 200–400&#160;km range. In other words, for every object with the diameter of 1000&#160;km there should be around 1000 (=10³) objects with diameter of 100&#160;km.</p>
<p>The law is expressed in this differential form rather than as a cumulative cubic relationship, because only the middle part of the slope can be measured; the law must break at smaller sizes, beyond the current measure.</p>
<p>Of course, only the magnitude is actually known, the size is inferred assuming <a href="/wiki/Albedo" id="w">albedo</a> (not a safe assumption for larger objects)

<a href="/wiki/As_of_2006" id="w">As of 2006</a>, nine stars other than the Sun are known to be circled by Kuiper belt-like structures. They appear to fall into two categories: wide belts, with radii of over 50 AU, and narrow belts (like our own Kuiper belt) with diameters of between 20 and 30 AU and relatively sharp boundaries. Most <a href="/wiki/Debris_disk" id="w">debris discs</a> around other stars are fairly young, but the two imaged at right, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in January, 2006, are old enough (roughly 300 million years) to have settled into stable configurations. The left image is a &#34;top view&#34; of a wide belt, and the right image is an &#34;edge view&#34; of a narrow belt. The black central circle is produced by the camera&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Coronagraph" id="w">coronagraph</a> which hides the central star to allow the much fainter disks to be seen.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
