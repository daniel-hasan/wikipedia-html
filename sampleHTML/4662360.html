<p><a href="/wiki/Square_Enix" id="w">Square Enix</a>&#39;s and <a href="/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" id="w">Disney</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_(series)" id="w">&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Kingdom Hearts&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;</a> series of video games takes place in an unnamed <a href="/wiki/Outer_space" id="w">outer space</a>-like fictional universe with numerous self-contained worlds to explore over the course of play. Many of these worlds are based on animated <a href="/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" id="w">Disney</a> movies, though <i><a href="/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_II" id="w">Kingdom Hearts II</a></i> introduced some worlds based on live action Disney films. In addition to the Disney worlds, Square included original worlds over the course of the series. The concept of the games and setting was developed by <a href="/wiki/Tetsuya_Nomura" id="w">Tetsuya Nomura</a>, the series&#39; director. The series centers around the main character <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Sora" id="w">Sora&#39;s</a> search for his friends and his encounters with Disney and Final Fantasy characters on their worlds. Sora&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts" id="w">first journey</a> takes him through each world to lock their keyholes and prevent the <a href="/wiki/#Heartless and Nobody" id="w">Heartless</a> from destroying them. On <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts:_Chain_of_Memories" id="w">his trip</a> through Castle Oblivion, he revisits memory based versions of many of these worlds. In <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>, Sora helps the residents of these worlds again in search of his friend Riku. The <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> games have been both critically acclaimed and commercially successful. The worlds used in the games have received praise from reviewers.

<a id="Concept_and_design" name="Concept_and_design"></a><h2>Concept and design</h2>
<p>The universe of <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> is a collection of various <a href="/wiki/Level_(computer_and_video_games)" id="w">levels</a>, referred to as &#34;worlds&#34;, that the player progresses through. Each world varies in appearance and setting, depending on the Disney world that it is based on. The graphics of the world and characters were meant to resemble the artwork style of the environments and characters from their respective Disney film. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from their respective Disney film; <a href="/wiki/Hercules_(Disney_character)" id="w">Hercules</a> and <a href="/wiki/Philoctetes" id="w">Philoctetes</a> inhabit Olympus Coliseum, and <a href="/wiki/Aladdin_(Disney_character)" id="w">Aladdin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Princess_Jasmine" id="w">Princess Jasmine</a>, and the Magic Carpet inhabit Agrabah.<sup id="_ref-KH-StrategyGuide_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KH-StrategyGuide" title="">[1]</a></sup> Each world is also disconnected from the others and exists separately. With a few exceptions, most characters in the worlds are unaware of the existence of the other worlds. Worlds are made up of interconnected field maps where battles and events take place. Players travel from one world to another via a Gummi Ship.<sup id="_ref-KH-Instructions_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KH-Instructions" title="">[2]</a></sup> The worlds created specifically for the game mirror the overall appearance of the other worlds and feature either new characters or characters from several <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy" id="w">Final Fantasy</a></i> games.</p>
<p>Though Disney gave director <a href="/wiki/Tetsuya_Nomura" id="w">Tetsuya Nomura</a> freedom in the characters and worlds used for the games, he and his staff tried to stay within the established roles of characters and boundaries of the worlds.<sup id="_ref-NI-TechTV_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NI-TechTV" title="">[3]</a></sup> Nomura stated that managing and keeping multiple worlds was problematic.<sup id="_ref-NI-IGN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NI-IGN" title="">[4]</a></sup> After determining the number of worlds in the universe, Nomura then picked the worlds he felt would fit into the scenario. The list was then evaluated by his team and then finally by Disney representatives.<sup id="_ref-KHII-NI-PlayStation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KHII-NI-PlayStation" title="">[5]</a></sup> Nomura also tried to keep the same number of worlds in each game<sup id="_ref-NI-Dengeki1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NI-Dengeki1" title="">[6]</a></sup> and made an effort to minimize any overlap in the overall look and feel of each world. He and his staff accomplished this by categorizing various Disney worlds by appearance and setting. For example, the <a href="/wiki/The_Jungle_Book_(1967_film)" id="w">Jungle Book</a> was considered for the first game, but was omitted due to the similarity between it and the Deep Jungle from <a href="/wiki/Tarzan_(1999_film)" id="w">Tarzan</a>.<sup id="_ref-KHII-NI-PlayStation_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KHII-NI-PlayStation" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-KHII-TN-interview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KHII-TN-interview" title="">[7]</a></sup> They also tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting.<sup id="_ref-Insider-KHU-NI_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Insider-KHU-NI" title="">[8]</a></sup> The inclusion of specific Final Fantasy characters was based on the opinions of both fans and staff.<sup id="_ref-RPGamer-NI_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RPGamer-NI" title="">[9]</a></sup> Initially, Nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design, because he was unfamiliar with the background work of those characters.<sup id="_ref-KH-NI-Dengeki2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KH-NI-Dengeki2" title="">[10]</a></sup> For <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>, he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff.<sup id="_ref-RPGamer-NI_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RPGamer-NI" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Cosmology" name="Cosmology"></a><h2>Cosmology</h2>
<p>In the fictional universe of the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> series, beings are composed of three parts: the body, the soul, and the heart. The body is a vessel for the heart and soul, and the soul gives life.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The heart gives a being emotion, light, and darkness. Seven maidens, called the &#34;Princesses of Heart&#34;, possess no darkness in their hearts. Worlds also possess hearts,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> and all hearts originate from Kingdom Hearts. Beings are corrupted when darkness takes their heart, producing the <a href="/wiki/Heartless" id="w">Heartless</a> from their hearts and sometimes producing a <a href="/wiki/Organization_XIII#Nobody" id="w">Nobody</a> from the remaining body and soul. Heartless act as forces of darkness, seeking to consume more hearts, including those of worlds. The &#34;heart of all worlds&#34; and the source of hearts is Kingdom Hearts. An object of immense power, it is desired by many forces of darkness and a path to it is opened by the unison of the Princesses of Heart. Nomura tried to convey a common theme of &#34;hearts&#34; and the strengths and connections of the heart in all three of the Square Enix games.<sup id="_ref-KHII-TN-interview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KHII-TN-interview" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The fictional universe of the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> series is divided into planes of existence called &#34;realms&#34;. Most of the series takes place in the &#34;realm of light&#34;. Opposite the realm of light is the &#34;realm of darkness&#34;, where Kingdom Hearts resides. There is also an &#34;in-between realm&#34;, a plane where Nobodies, as well as the worlds they reside in, come into existence. There are four worlds that are currently known to be found exclusively within this &#34;in-between realm&#34;.<sup id="_ref-AnotherReport_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AnotherReport" title="">[13]</a></sup> Each world found within the in-between plane are tied more closely to either the realm of light or the realm of darkness by varying degrees. As well as these known realms, <a href="/wiki/DiZ" id="w">Ansem the Wise</a> was banished to a &#34;realm of nothingness&#34;,<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> which he described as a realm &#34;where all existence has been disintegrated&#34;.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

{{nihongo}} are hearts corrupted by darkness and without a body or a soul. They serve as most of the battles and challenges that the player must go through in the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> games. They come in a large variety of types, categorized by being Pureblood or Emblem, both reproducing by taking more hearts and transforming them into other Heartless. Emblem Heartless were artificially created and are labeled with a heart symbol. Pureblood Heartless are black shadow creatures with bright yellow eyes. The Heartless obey those with the will to control them.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> However, in worlds too close to darkness, the Heartless get stronger and become uncontrollable. The Heartless&#39; method of entering worlds is to use the corridors of darkness, an unpredictable pathway that interlinks many worlds.<sup id="_ref-corridors_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-corridors" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

Other Nobodies include Twilight Thorn, Creeper, <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Naminé" id="w">Naminé</a>, and multiple kinds of Nobody ships. The members of <a href="/wiki/Organization_XIII" id="w">Organization XIII</a>, being the most powerful Nobodies because of the strong hearts they had when they were &#34;whole,&#34; kept human form while weaker ones assumed malformed, inhuman forms.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> Most of the members of the Organization tend to control one type of Nobody, usually suited to their fighting style.<sup id="_ref-ultimania_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ultimania" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Keyblade" name="Keyblade"></a><h3>Keyblade</h3>
<p>The {{nihongo}} is a key-shaped weapon with the power to combat darkness and free hearts from the Heartless.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> It also has the ability to lock and unlock all manner of doors and keyholes.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> The Keyblade chooses its wielder and will appear in that person&#39;s hand when summoned. Another important power is that it can lock the &#34;heart&#34; of a world, preventing it from being destroyed by Heartless. In <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>, it can also unlock the pathways between worlds that were closed after the events of the first game.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> There are different Keyblades, possessed by  various characters in the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> series. There was, at one point, an artificial Keyblade made by the hearts of six of the Princesses of Heart, which was destroyed by Sora.</p>
<a id="Travel" name="Travel"></a><h2>Travel</h2>
<p>In the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> universe, travel between worlds is normally not possible.

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">A portion of the Destiny Islands, where the children play</div>
The Destiny Islands are featured in all three of the main <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> games, though playable only briefly in <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> and <i>Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</i>. They form an original world created for the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> series. Some of the main characters of the series reside here; <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Sora" id="w">Sora</a>, <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Riku" id="w">Riku</a>, <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Kairi" id="w">Kairi</a>. Other characters include <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Destiny Islands" id="w">Tidus, Wakka, and Selphie</a>, which were originally <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy" id="w">Final Fantasy</a> characters. The world is enveloped by the darkness in the beginning of <i>Kingdom Hearts</i>, but is restored after the sealing of the door to Kingdom Hearts at the end. </p>
<p>The islands are an <a href="/wiki/Archipelago" id="w">archipelago</a> that consists of several land masses. Close enough to the main islands to be reached by small boats is an island that several of the character visit for recreation. The keyhole of the islands is located here in a small cave which Riku discovered as a boy. The main island is a regular town with a school. A superstition of the island is the power of the paopu fruit which is said to bind together the destinies of any two people who share one.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

Disney Castle is the home to many classic Disney characters<sup id="_ref-IGN-KHPreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN-KHPreview" title="">[32]</a></sup> including <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#King Mickey" id="w">Mickey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Donald Duck" id="w">Donald</a> and <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Goofy" id="w">Goofy</a>. It is featured in <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> and <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>, though it is not accessible in the first game. Disney Castle is ruled by King Mickey, and his queen, <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Disney Castle" id="w">Minnie Mouse</a>. King Mickey has been absent for more than a year, having left without warning at the outset of the first wave of the Heartless. The world is protected by the Cornerstone of Light, a magical artifact that prevents darkness and the Heartless from entering the world.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> In <i>Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix</i>, a portal was added in this world. The portal leads to battle with Terra, a Keyblade-wielding knight that was featured in the unlockable trailers of <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>. </p>
<a id="Timeless_River" name="Timeless_River"></a><h4>Timeless River</h4>
<p>Based on <a href="/wiki/Steamboat_Willie" id="w">Steamboat Willie</a> and other early Disney <a href="/wiki/Cartoon" id="w">cartoons</a> of that era, Timeless River is the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Past" id="w">past</a>&#34; of Disney Castle, shortly before it was built.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> This world is accessed via the door Merlin created in the Hall of the Cornerstone chamber in <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> The world is portrayed in black and white. Nomura had intended it to be this way from the beginning of development.<sup id="_ref-KH-NI-Dengeki3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KH-NI-Dengeki3" title="">[36]</a></sup> The world has many throwback effects including intentionally poor sound quality to imitate old cartoons. In this grayscale world, Sora&#39;s character model is simplified to the style of early cartoons, while Goofy and Donald Duck revert to their original designs from when they first appeared in Disney cartoons. Past versions of many Disney characters also appear including <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Pete" id="w">Pete</a> and King Mickey, who Pete refers to as the &#34;boat-boy king&#34;, a reference to his previous employment on Pete&#39;s steamboat. Timeless River also contains reenactments of some popular Mickey Mouse cartoons with locations such as Lilliput and Scene of the Fire.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Second District of Traverse Town</div>
Traverse Town is an original world that is featured in <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> and <i>Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</i>. It acts as a hub of sorts for Sora during his journey. Its architecture is reminiscent of the <a href="/wiki/Victorian_architecture" id="w">High Victorian</a> style popular in England during the 19th century. It serves as a home for people who manage to escape the destruction of their own worlds by unknowingly drifting through &#34;corridors of darkness&#34;.</p>
<p>Traverse Town is separated into three major districts. The First District is generally devoid of Heartless and houses various shops. The Second District contains the bell tower, a gizmo shop, and a small hotel. The world&#39;s keyhole is located in the fountain in this district. It also has the entrance to the Dalmatians&#39; house. The Third District is a plaza that has been overrun with Heartless. This district leads to a guarded alcove where <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Other characters" id="w">Merlin</a> lives. It also is where Leon and his allies have their secret hideout. Aside from these areas, Traverse Town also has a sewer system where Leon practices his swordplay and a back alley behind the hotel.</p>
<a id="Wonderland" name="Wonderland"></a><h3>Wonderland</h3>
<p>Wonderland, based on Disney&#39;s thirteenth <a href="/wiki/List_of_Disney_theatrical_animated_features" id="w">animated feature</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_(1951_film)" id="w">Alice in Wonderland</a></i>, is featured in <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> and <i>Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</i> as one of the first worlds visited on Sora&#39;s journey. Its colorful inhabitants seem to speak in riddles and code. Wonderland is ruled by the despotic <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Wonderland" id="w">Queen of Hearts</a>. The most dominant feature of Wonderland&#39;s entrance is the Bizarre Room. Many of the items here can be pushed flat into the walls and strange potions here can change Sora&#39;s size. The next area is the Queen&#39;s Castle where most of her courtly functions are carried out, a verdant hedge maze surrounds this area. Connected to the courtyard is the Lotus Forest, which leads to the Tea Party Garden. Throughout the world are hidden entrances to the Bizarre Room which have effects on the direction of its gravity.</p>
<a id="Olympus_Coliseum" name="Olympus_Coliseum"></a><h3>Olympus Coliseum</h3>
<p>Olympus Coliseum is featured in all three of the main <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> games. It is based on Disney&#39;s thirty-fifth animated feature, <i><a href="/wiki/Hercules_(1997_film)" id="w">Hercules</a></i>. The Coliseum is protected by <a href="/wiki/Hercules_(Disney_character)" id="w">Hercules</a> and antagonized by <a href="/wiki/Hades_(Disney)" id="w">Hades</a>. Sora is able to train here and can compete in various tournaments. Olympus Coliseum is one of the smallest worlds in the first <i>Kingdom Hearts</i>, consisting of only the main entrance, a lobby and the coliseum itself. Because of the popularity of Hades, the Underworld was added to the sequel.<sup id="_ref-KHS-UltimaniaAlpha_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KHS-UltimaniaAlpha" title="">[37]</a></sup> In <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>, Hades opens a portal to the Underworld near the exit of the Coliseum. The Underworld consists of its own &#34;lobby&#34; which is one boat ride across the river <a href="/wiki/Styx_(mythology)" id="w">Styx</a> to the Underdrome, the Underworld&#39;s equivalent to the Coliseum, the Lost Road to the Lock and the Cave of the Dead which leads to Hades&#39; Chamber. All of these Underworld areas are infested with Heartless, as well as mysterious white puffs of smoke.</p>
<a id="Deep_Jungle" name="Deep_Jungle"></a><h3>Deep Jungle</h3>
<p>Deep Jungle is based on Disney&#39;s thirty-seventh animated feature, <i><a href="/wiki/Tarzan_(1999_film)" id="w">Tarzan</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-IGN-KHPreview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN-KHPreview" title="">[32]</a></sup> and is only featured in the first <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> game. It is a lush <a href="/wiki/Jungle" id="w">tropical forest</a> of diverse animals and exotic plants. The primary inhabitants of this world are <a href="/wiki/Gorilla" id="w">gorillas</a>, who live in the secretive corners of the jungle and resist intrusion. An exploratory party has arrived to study them but its guide, <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Deep Jungle" id="w">Clayton</a>, has other plans. The jungle is also home to <a href="/wiki/Hippopotamus" id="w">hippos</a> and other jungle creatures, including the Heartless&#39; mimicry of the local animals. Traveling in this world is done by climbing up trees and jumping onto vines. Much of the world is covered with dense jungle but some areas have signs of civilized inhabitance. There is an abandoned treehouse near the <a href="/wiki/Canopy_(forest)" id="w">canopy</a> that contains the remains of a previous visitor to the world. Also, the camp set up by Clayton contains many conveniences including stoves and slide projectors. The Bamboo Thicket near the camp ultimately leads to the Waterfall Cave, a secluded place that hides the world&#39;s keyhole.</p>
<a id="Agrabah" name="Agrabah"></a><h3>Agrabah</h3>
<p>Agrabah is an arid desert city featured in all three of the main <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> games. It is based on the fictional city of Disney&#39;s thirty-first animated feature, <i><a href="/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_film)" id="w">Aladdin</a></i>. Agrabah&#39;s hot climate disguises a world of intrigue, both magical and political, as an evil sorcerer schemes to usurp the throne from the <a href="/wiki/Sultan" id="w">sultan</a> of the realm. Little is as it seems in this world as it gets turned upside down through the antics of a certain <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Agrabah" id="w">genie</a>. The city of Agrabah is primarily made of <a href="/wiki/Adobe" id="w">adobe</a> buildings though the palace appears to be carved from <a href="/wiki/Marble" id="w">marble</a>. In the first game, there are only two small blocks for the marketplace, but the city area was expanded in <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>. Just outside the city walls is a desert area. The desert itself leads to the Cave of Wonders and the ruins of an ancient civilization.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Inside Monstro</div></div>

<a href="/wiki/Monstro" id="w">Monstro</a> is an enormous <a href="/wiki/Whale" id="w">whale</a> from Disney&#39;s second animated feature, <i><a href="/wiki/Pinocchio_(1940_film)" id="w">Pinocchio</a></i><sup id="_ref-IGN-KHPreview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN-KHPreview" title="">[32]</a></sup> and is featured in <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> and <i>Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</i>. Monstro is not a world unto himself and thus has no keyhole. Rather, his belly is large enough to serve as a substitute world, filled with luminescent <a href="/wiki/Acid" id="w">acid</a>, <a href="/wiki/Blubber" id="w">blubber</a>, and Heartless. Monstro swims through the dimensional drift between worlds as if it were water, attacking and swallowing any vessel that passes his way. Monstro escaped from the world of <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts%23#Monstro" id="w">Geppetto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts%23#Monstro" id="w">Pinocchio</a> just before it was destroyed by the Heartless. Geppetto finds himself inside Monstro&#39;s belly while searching for his &#34;son,&#34; Pinocchio. Monstro&#39;s anatomically disoriented insides consist of two major parts. His enormous mouth contains many of the ships he has swallowed over the years, including Geppetto&#39;s. His throat leads to his Heartless-filled intestines, which are a sickly purple color with vessels and valves separating the body cavities.</p>

As Sora collects Torn Pages, new areas of the 100 Acre Wood become available as the story is retold. When Sora &#34;enters the book&#34;, he lands on a version of the flat map of the 100 Acre Wood featured in many Pooh books. Classic locations such as Pooh&#39;s and Piglet&#39;s House appear as well as the Muddy Path and Spooky Cave. In each location is usually a <a href="/wiki/Minigame" id="w">minigame</a> with prizes which help Sora on his journey.</p>
<p>The book is first given to Sora by Cid near the beginning of <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> and he collects Torn Pages throughout the game until he finds and seals the 100 Acre Wood&#39;s keyhole.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> Along the way, he makes friends with each of the Wood&#39;s inhabitants, particularly <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#100 Acre Wood" id="w">Winnie the Pooh</a>, with whom he plays a <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Robin" id="w">Christopher Robin</a>-like role. 100 Acre Wood appeared again as a recreated world in <i>Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</i>. In <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>, Merlin moves to Hollow Bastion and takes the book with him. When Sora returns, he excitedly enters the book to check up on his friends. While he is greeting Pooh, he is suddenly ejected from the book as the Heartless try to steal it. During the battle to recover the book, it is damaged. Upon return, Sora finds Pooh with severe <a href="/wiki/Amnesia" id="w">amnesia</a>, unable to remember him. Sora then continues to find Torn Pages which slowly restore Pooh&#39;s memory.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Shortly after fully repairing the book, Sora admits that he has to leave again but reassures Pooh that they will always be in each other&#39;s hearts.</p>

<p>The main city of Atlantica is the only &#34;constructed&#34; area, made of what appears to be <a href="/wiki/Coral" id="w">coral</a> and other underwater vegetation. King Triton&#39;s chamber can be found here. Outside the city is the Undersea Gorge, which is a sort of hub to other areas. Here can be found Ariel&#39;s Grotto, a secret place where Princess <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Atlantica" id="w">Ariel</a> stores her human artifacts. Also, a path from here leads to a rotting sunken ship that has become the home to many sea creatures. A more sinister area of the sea can be accessed from here: the Den of Tides and the sea witch <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Atlantica" id="w">Ursula</a>&#39;s lair.</p>
<a id="Halloween_Town" name="Halloween_Town"></a><h3>Halloween Town</h3>
<p>Halloween Town is an eternally dark village featured in all three of the main <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> games. It is based on <a href="/wiki/Tim_Burton" id="w">Tim Burton</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas" id="w">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a></i>, a <a href="/wiki/Stop_motion" id="w">stop motion</a> animated film released by <a href="/wiki/Touchstone_Pictures" id="w">Touchstone Pictures</a>. The residents of Halloween Town are obsessed with their <a href="/wiki/Halloween" id="w">eponymous holiday</a> and each year, they seek to outdo the last year&#39;s celebration. Though it has a <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Halloween Town" id="w">mayor</a>, the de facto leader of Halloween Town is the Pumpkin King, <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Halloween Town" id="w">Jack Skellington</a>. Using Donald&#39;s magic, Sora, Donald and Goofy disguise themselves as spooky characters to blend in with the Halloween Town folk.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Halloween Town&#39;s nexus is Guillotine Square, which has entrances to <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Halloween Town" id="w">Dr. Finklestein&#39;s</a> lab, Jack Skellington&#39;s house and the Graveyard. The Graveyard has been overrun by Halloween-themed Heartless and leads to Moonlight Hill. A secret switch in Moonlight Hill allows access to <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Halloween Town" id="w">Oogie Boogie&#39;s</a> Manor. The back of the Graveyard also houses a forest called the Hinterlands. Here, several trees with strange symbols lead to other holiday-themed towns. The most prominent is <a href="/wiki/Christmas" id="w">Christmas</a> Town, where <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Halloween Town" id="w">Santa Claus</a> lives and has his workshop. In the Final Mix version of <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>, Sora&#39;s Halloween outfit is replaced by a Christmas outfit. It is a mixture of both Christmas and Halloween themes. Donald and Goofy also receive new Christmas outfits. Like the mask of his Halloween outfit, the Santa hat of his Christmas outfit changes when activating a Drive Form.</p>
<a id="Neverland" name="Neverland"></a><h3>Neverland</h3>
<p>Neverland is a world featured in <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> and <i>Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</i>.

Hollow Bastion is an original world created for the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> series which serves as the home to many <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy" id="w">Final Fantasy</a></i> characters in the series. It is featured in all three of the main <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> games, and served as the hub world of <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>, similar to how Traverse Town did in the first.<sup id="_ref-KH-NI-Dengeki3_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KH-NI-Dengeki3" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-RPGamer-NI_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RPGamer-NI" title="">[9]</a></sup> The gathering of the various Final Fantasy characters and the overall look of Hollow Bastion was changed for the third installment in order to help with the progression of the story.<sup id="_ref-KH-NI-Dengeki3_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KH-NI-Dengeki3" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hollow Bastion is dominated by a castle which, now derelict, once was the world&#39;s seat of power. Underneath the castle entrance are the Waterways which provide plumbing throughout the castle. A library is here, containing knowledge collected by its former scientists. Aside from the castle itself, there is a town at its foot which is the base of operations for the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee in <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> A previously unknown entrance here leads to Ansem&#39;s Study and his computer room.</p>
<p>Hollow Bastion was once a peaceful kingdom called the Radiant Garden,<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> ruled by <a href="/wiki/DiZ" id="w">Ansem the Wise</a>. In his thirst for knowledge, he began studying the darkness in people&#39;s hearts, with six apprentices, including <a href="/wiki/Xehanort" id="w">Xehanort</a>. Ansem grew wary of the experiments and stopped them. Unknown to him, his apprentices continued his work, producing the <a href="/wiki/Heartless" id="w">Heartless</a> from hearts that were overwhelmed by darkness. A chain of events led to Ansem the Wise being banished, Xehanort splitting into two beings, and the world overwhelmed by darkness. Empty, the castle was later adopted by Maleficent as a headquarters.</p>
<a id="Space_Paranoids" name="Space_Paranoids"></a><h4>Space Paranoids</h4>
<p>Space Paranoids is a world inspired by the <a href="/wiki/1982" id="w">1982</a> live-action <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a> cult film, <i><a href="/wiki/Tron_(film)" id="w">Tron</a></i>. Sora, Donald, and Goofy get immersed into a computer world to find clues regarding the past of Hollow Bastion and a caption they found behind Xehanort&#39;s portrait in Ansem&#39;s Study saying <i>Door To Darkness</i> a.k.a. <i>D.T.D</i>, fighting alongside <a href="/wiki/Tron_(character)" id="w">Tron</a> to defeat the evil <a href="/wiki/Master_Control_Program_(Tron)" id="w">MCP</a> and its equally villainous commander, <a href="/wiki/Sark_(Tron)" id="w">Sark</a>. There is also a <a href="/wiki/Light_Cycle" id="w">Light Cycle</a> mini-game which strongly deviates from the original game. Nomura included this mini-game because he knew people associated the Light Cycles with Tron.<sup id="_ref-KH-NI-Dengeki3_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KH-NI-Dengeki3" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Space Paranoids is only playable in <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>. Tron at one point mentions that Space Paranoids was copied from an existing world designed by ENCOM, the company from the original film. It can be assumed that the Space Paranoids in <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i> exists alongside the original (though Tron said that the original was deleted).<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> The term <i>Space Paranoids</i> comes from one of the games Kevin Flynn created in <i>Tron</i>. Tron can join Sora, Donald and Goofy when they enter into the system. The overall feel of the world was meant to emulate an old computer game. Nomura got the idea to include this world after seeing a Disney employee making a Tron game. Because it was so different from the other worlds, he hoped that it would be enjoyable to players.<sup id="_ref-KH-NI-Dengeki3_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KH-NI-Dengeki3" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Castle_Oblivion" name="Castle_Oblivion"></a><h3>Castle Oblivion</h3>
<p>{{nihongo}} is a mysterious fortress featured in <i>Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</i> and serves as the main setting of the game. The castle is decorated with a <a href="/wiki/Rose" id="w">rose</a> <a href="/wiki/Motif_(art)" id="w">motif</a> and has twenty five levels; thirteen floors and twelve basements. The lord of the castle is <a href="/wiki/Organization_XIII#XI.

In the balance between light and darkness within this in-between realm, however, Castle Oblivion is more closely tied to the realm of darkness than the realm of light.<sup id="_ref-AnotherReport_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AnotherReport" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Castle Oblivion is dominated by the use of <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts:_Chain_of_Memories#Gameplay" id="w">cards</a>. When entering the castle, one&#39;s memories and abilities are quantified into cards. Castle Oblivion&#39;s floors can be transmuted into different forms and layouts through the use of &#34;world cards&#34; derived from one&#39;s memories, as well as &#34;map cards&#34; which determine the properties of individual rooms. World cards based on Traverse Town, Wonderland, Olympus Coliseum, Agrabah, Halloween Town, Monstro, Atlantica, Never Land, Hollow Bastion, 100 Acre Wood, Twilight Town, and Destiny Islands have been created from Sora and Riku&#39;s memories.<sup id="_ref-CoM-StrategyGuide_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CoM-StrategyGuide" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>

Twilight Town was introduced in <i><a href="/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts:_Chain_of_Memories" id="w">Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</a></i>, in which Sora explored the memories of the other side of his heart. In <i><a href="/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_II" id="w">Kingdom Hearts II</a></i>, it is a major part in the story where <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Kingdom_Hearts#Twilight Town" id="w">Hayner, Pence, and Olette</a> reside.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> DiZ created a simulation of the town and its people to keep Roxas trapped and away from Organization XIII until Sora&#39;s restoration was complete. Roxas is playable only in this world.</p>
<p>Twilight Town is split into two parts, the shopping district and the residential district, with a train and underground tunnel system that connects the two. There are plenty of <a href="/wiki/Stores" id="w">stores</a> here, including an <a href="/wiki/Accessory" id="w">accessory</a> shop, as well as lots of houses lined up. Within the world of Twilight Town is also the Tower, the residence of <a href="/wiki/Yen_Sid" id="w">Yen Sid</a> and Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. Both Twilight Town and Yen Sid&#39;s Tower are other worlds to be found between light and darkness. Twilight Town holds the perfect balance between the two realms, while Yen Sid&#39;s Tower is more closely tied to the realm of light than any of the known worlds on this in between plane.</p>

They transformed into animals because Nomura felt that since <i>The Lion King</i> film lacked any humans, it would appear odd to have Sora and the others interact in their standard forms. It was originally considered for inclusion in <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> but the game&#39;s engine could not correctly handle a quadrupedal animal as the player without an additional program. It was later added into <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>.<sup id="_ref-KH-NI-Dengeki3_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KH-NI-Dengeki3" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

Since then, the Pride Land has seen a steady decline in living conditions, due to his poor rule. Pride Land is dominated by a large central <a href="/wiki/Savanna" id="w">savannah</a> area which branches off in three directions. To the north is Pride Rock, home of the lions and the seat of the world&#39;s political power. The area southwest of the savanna is where outcasts from Pride Rock, such as the hyenas, live. The skeletons of several large elephants earns this area its nickname, the Elephant Graveyard. Southeast of the savanna are the Wastelands, an arid desert of little life. Beyond the Wastelands, however, is a lush oasis.</p>
