<p><b><i>Psycho</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/1960_in_film" id="w">1960</a> <a href="/wiki/Thriller_(genre)" id="w">suspense</a>/<a href="/wiki/Horror_film" id="w">horror film</a> <a href="/wiki/Film_director" id="w">directed</a> by <a href="/wiki/List_of_auteurs" id="w">auteur</a> <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" id="w">Alfred Hitchcock</a>, from the <a href="/wiki/Screenplay" id="w">screenplay</a> by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stefano" id="w">Joseph Stefano</a> about a <a href="/wiki/Psychotic" id="w">psychotic</a> killer. It is based on the <a href="/wiki/Psycho_(novel)" id="w">novel of the same name</a> by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Bloch" id="w">Robert Bloch</a>, which was in turn inspired by the crimes of <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin" id="w">Wisconsin</a> <a href="/wiki/Serial_killer" id="w">serial killer</a> <a href="/wiki/Ed_Gein" id="w">Ed Gein</a>.<sup id="_ref-EW_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EW" title="">[1]</a></sup> The film depicts the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane (<a href="/wiki/Janet_Leigh" id="w">Janet Leigh</a>), who is in hiding at a motel after <a href="/wiki/Embezzlement" id="w">embezzling</a> from her employer, and the <a href="/wiki/Motel" id="w">motel</a>&#39;s owner, the lonely <a href="/wiki/Norman_Bates" id="w">Norman Bates</a> (<a href="/wiki/Anthony_Perkins" id="w">Anthony Perkins</a>). </p>
<p>It initially received mixed reviews but outstanding box-office returns, prompting a re-review which was overwhelmingly positive and led to four <a href="/wiki/Academy_Award" id="w">Academy Award</a> nominations. Regarded today as one of Hitchcock&#39;s best films<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> and highly praised as a work of cinematic art by international critics,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> <i>Psycho</i> is also acclaimed as one of the most effective horror films.<sup id="_ref-ebert_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebert" title="">[4]</a></sup> It was a genre defining film, and almost every scene have become cinematic legends and have been copied extensively. The film spawned <a href="/wiki/Psycho_II" id="w">several sequels</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Psycho_(1998_film)" id="w">remake</a>, which are generally seen as works of lesser quality.</p>
<p>&#34;The Shower Scene&#34; has been studied, discussed, and cited countless times in print and in film courses with debate focusing on why it is so terrifying and how it was produced, including how it passed the censors and who directed it.</p>
<a id="Plot_summary" name="Plot_summary"></a><h2>Plot summary</h2>
<p>The movie opens in <a href="/wiki/Phoenix%2C_Arizona" id="w">Phoenix, Arizona</a>, with discreet lovers Marion Crane (Leigh) and Sam Loomis (Gavin) together in a downtown hotel room. Until Sam&#39;s finances improve, the two cannot marry, as he is in debt and must also pay heavy <a href="/wiki/Alimony" id="w">alimony</a> to his ex-wife. Unhappy and desperate to improve their situation, Marion steals $40,000 cash tendered as payment for a real estate deal at the office where she works. Asked to deposit the money at the bank for the weekend, she instead packs and leaves town with the money, which she sees as the ticket to her and Sam&#39;s happiness.</p>
<p>Sam lives in a <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a> town where he runs a hardware store. Marion heads there, and her behavior along the way draws the attention of others. All the while she keeps looking behind her, fearful that she is being followed. She drives well into the night and parks alongside the road to sleep. In the morning, a highway police officer stops to investigate her stopped car and awakens her. Startled and nervous, she arouses the patrolman&#39;s suspicions, he looks at her license and registration, taking note of the plate number. He allows her to go on, but follows her for the time being, which intensifies Marion&#39;s agitation. She trades her car (and pays an additional $700) for another used car while the same highway patrolman watches her. Nervous, she drives away and continues toward California after she completes her deal.</p>
<p>While driving fatigued in the dark, in pouring rain, she sees a seemingly deserted 12-cabin motel. There, Marion encounters Norman Bates (Perkins), the young owner who looks after the motel and his ailing mother in the nearby mansion on a hill. Norman offers to make her a sandwich; while going into the house to prepare the sandwich, Marion hears his mother shouting at him as though his meal with Marion was part of a sordid affair. While talking with Norman, she considers him something of an eccentric, especially when he shows surprising knowledge of the interior of a <a href="/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital" id="w">mental asylum</a>. Unfortunately for Marion, Norman has completely understated his overbearing mother&#39;s illness. Ultimately, as Marion showers in her motel room, she is stabbed to death in the now-famous &#34;shower scene&#34; by a shadowy woman&#39;s figure while <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" id="w">Bernard Herrmann</a>&#39;s screeching string score plays.</p>
<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Bateshower.jpg" title="275px"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateshower.jpg" alt="275px" title="275px" class="location-left type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">275px</div>
Norman is horrified when he finds the bloody corpse. To protect his mother, he disposes all evidence of the crime by sinking Marion, her car, and her belongings (including the money, which Bates has not seen) in a swamp behind the Bates&#39; property. Marion&#39;s disappearance, with the money, sets a search in motion. A private detective, Milton Arbogast (Balsam), is hired to find and recover the money. He traces Marion to the Bates Motel, questions Norman (who sweats and seems very nervous and edgy) and is similarly slashed to death by Norman&#39;s mother after being pushed down a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>Sam and Marion&#39;s sister, Lila (Miles), immediately become concerned when Arbogast does not telephone them after reaching the motel and decide to alert the local sheriff. They explain to Sheriff Al Chambers (McIntire) and his wife their story about Marion&#39;s disappearance. However, when they mention Mrs. Bates, his wife asks: &#34;Oh, Norman took a wife?&#34;, but they mention Norman&#39;s mother. At their urging, Chambers phones the motel and talks to Norman, who says that Arbogast had been there but had left. When Lila presses Chambers about the mother, he tells them that Norman&#39;s mother has been dead and buried for the past ten years, when she poisoned herself and her lover with <a href="/wiki/Strychnine" id="w">strychnine</a>. But Sam and Lila insist that there is an old woman out there, and Arbogast had told them that Norman would not let him see his mother because she was too sick. That makes the sheriff wonder, &#34;Well if the woman up there is Mrs. Bates, who&#39;s that woman buried out in Greenlawn Cemetery?&#34;</p>
<p>Sam and Lila, tipped by Detective Arbogast before his demise, are also suspicious of Norman and his mother. While investigating they decide to check into the Bates Motel, to search for proof of Marion, where they find a paper with the sum of $40,000 written on it. Theorizing that Norman&#39;s mother might know more about Marion, Lila sneaks into the house while Sam confronts Norman at the office. Sam&#39;s heated argument with Norman quickly escalates to violence, and Norman knocks Sam unconscious and flees to the house. Meanwhile, Lila slips into the basement to discover the semi-preserved corpse of Norman&#39;s mother just as Norman enters to find her. Cross-dressed in his mother&#39;s clothing, complete with wig, Norman is wielding the deadly butcher&#39;s knife, preparing to kill Lila. Sam regains consciousness, reappearing just in time to wrestle the knife away from Norman and rescue Lila, who watches in disbelief.</p>
<p>At the end of the film, a <a href="/wiki/Forensic_psychiatry" id="w">forensic psychiatrist</a>, Dr. Fred Richmond (Oakland), explains to Lila, Sam and the authorities that Bates&#39; mother, though dead, lives on in Norman&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Psyche_(psychology)" id="w">psyche</a>. Norman was so dominated by his mother while she lived, and so guilt-ridden for murdering her ten years earlier, that he tried to erase the crime from his mind by bringing his mother back to life. Physically, this was done by stealing her corpse (&#34;A weighted coffin was buried,&#34; according to Richmond) and preserving it with his <a href="/wiki/Taxidermy" id="w">taxidermy</a> skills, thereby inciting a split personality in Norman, creating the <a href="/wiki/Persona" id="w">persona</a> of his mother. He acts as he believes she would, talks as she would, and even dresses as she would, in an attempt to erase her absence and the guilt. Because Norman was so very jealous of his mother while she lived, his split personality is equally jealous of any woman to whom Norman might be attracted. Norman&#39;s psychosis prohibits him from knowing of his mother&#39;s crimes or her original demise.</p>
<p>The last scene shows Norman Bates in a cell, his mind now completely dominated by the persona of his mother. She blames Norman for the crimes, and plans on demonstrating to the authorities that she is utterly harmless. She knows that those people Norman murdered must be watching her, but will show them what kind of a person she is, thinking to herself, &#34;They’ll see, they&#39;ll know, and they’ll say, &#39;Why, she wouldn’t even harm a fly!&#39;&#34; A brief epilogue shows Marion&#39;s car being towed from its watery grave in the swamp.</p>
<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h2>Production</h2>
<a id="Pre-production" name="Pre-production"></a><h3>Pre-production</h3>
<p>The film is based on the novel by Robert Bloch, which was in turn based on the crimes of Wisconsin serial killer <a href="/wiki/Ed_Gein" id="w">Ed Gein</a>. Hitchcock acquired the film rights anonymously through an agent for a very small sum of $9,000.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Legend also has it that Hitchcock bought up as many copies of the book as he could, so that as many people as possible would not anticipate the twists of the story.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Hitchcock embraced <i>Psycho</i> as a means to regain success and individuality in an increasingly competitive genre. He had seen many <a href="/wiki/B-movies" id="w">B-movies</a> churned out by <a href="/wiki/William_Castle" id="w">William Castle</a> such as <i><a href="/wiki/House_on_Haunted_Hill" id="w">House on Haunted Hill</a></i> (1958), and by <a href="/wiki/Roger_Corman" id="w">Roger Corman</a> such as <i><a href="/wiki/Bucket_of_Blood" id="w">Bucket of Blood</a></i> (1959) that cleaned up at box offices despite being panned by critics. There were also a series of competing directors who had tried their hand at typical Hitchcock fare in such films as <i><a href="/wiki/When_Strangers_Marry" id="w">When Strangers Marry</a></i> (1944), <i><a href="/wiki/The_Spiral_Staircase" id="w">The Spiral Staircase</a></i> (1946), <i><a href="/wiki/Gaslight" id="w">Gaslight</a></i> (1944), and so forth.<sup id="_ref-Rebello_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rebello" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Furthermore, both Hitchcock and <a href="/wiki/Henri-Georges_Clouzot" id="w">Henri-Georges Clouzot</a> had adapted two books by the same authors with very different results. Clouzot&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Les_Diaboliques_(film)" id="w">Les Diaboliques</a></i> (1955) was critically acclaimed and financially successful, earning him the title of the &#34;French Hitchcock,&#34; while Hitchcock&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Vertigo_(film)" id="w">Vertigo</a></i> (1958) had failed both critically and financially.<sup id="_ref-Rebello_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rebello" title="">[6]</a></sup> Hitchcock was also constantly reinventing himself (he once said &#34;Style is self-plagiarism&#34;), so, when Peggy Robertson, a trusted production assistant, brought <i>Psycho</i> to his attention, he seized on it not only for its originality but also as a way to retake his mantle as an acclaimed director of suspense.<sup id="_ref-Rebello_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rebello" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ned Brown, Hitchcock&#39;s longtime agent, explains that Hitchcock liked the story because the focus began with Marion&#39;s dilemma then completely turned after the murder.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Hitchcock himself said in an interview with <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut" id="w">François Truffaut</a> that &#34;I think the thing that appealed to me was the suddenness of the murder in the shower, coming, as it were, out of the blue. That was about all.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Leigh_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>James Cavanaugh wrote the original screenplay, but Hitchcock turned it down citing its dragging storyline that he believed read like a TV short horror story.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Hitchcock reluctantly agreed to meet with <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stefano" id="w">Joseph Stefano</a>, who had worked on only one film before. Despite his inexperience, the meeting went well, and Stefano was hired.</p>
<p>The screenplay is relatively faithful to the novel with a few notable adaptations by Hitchcock and Stefano. The book features Mary Crane, from <a href="/wiki/Dallas%2C_Texas" id="w">Dallas, Texas</a> as its heroine and protagonist. Since, at the time, a real Mary Crane existed in Phoenix, Hitchcock renamed the character Marion Crane.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Stefano also changed Marion&#39;s telltale earring found in the bathroom after her death to a scrap of paper in the toilet. When developing the characters for film, Hitchcock asked Stefano why he did not like the Norman Bates character, to which Stefano replied that Norman was unsympathetic, unattractive, and a drinker. Hitchcock suggested Perkins as a sympathetic man, and Stefano agreed.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Other changes Stefano made for the screenplay include the location of Arbogast&#39;s death from the foyer to the stairwell. He also changed the novel&#39;s budding romance between Sam and Lila to just a friendly relationship, and instead of using the two to explain Norman&#39;s mental condition he replaced them with a professional psychiatrist.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Paramount, whose contract guaranteed another film by Hitchcock, did not want Hitchcock to make <i>Psycho</i>. (Paramount was expecting <i><a href="/wiki/List_of_unproduced_Hitchcock_projects" id="w">No Bail for the Judge</a></i> starring <a href="/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn" id="w">Audrey Hepburn</a> who became pregnant and had to bow out, leading Hitchcock to scrap the production.) Their official stance was that the book was &#34;too repulsive&#34; and &#34;impossible for films,&#34; and nothing but another of his star-studded mystery thrillers.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Rebello_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rebello" title="">[6]</a></sup> They did not like &#34;anything about it at all&#34; and denied him his usual budget.<sup id="_ref-Rebello_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rebello" title="">[6]</a></sup> So Hitchcock financed the film&#39;s creation through his own Shamley Productions, shooting at <a href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" id="w">Universal Studios</a> under the Revue television unit.<sup id="_ref-Rebello_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rebello" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Leigh_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Hitchcock&#39;s original <a href="/wiki/Bates_Motel" id="w">Bates Motel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Psycho_House" id="w">Psycho House</a> movie set buildings, which were constructed on the same stage as Lon Chaney&#39;s <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>, are still standing at Universal Studios in <a href="/wiki/Universal_City%2C_California" id="w">Universal City</a> near <a href="/wiki/Hollywood%2C_California" id="w">Hollywood, California</a> and are a regular attraction on the studio&#39;s tour.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Leigh_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> As a further result of cost cutting, Hitchcock chose to film <i>Psycho</i> in black and white, keeping the budget under $1,000,000.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Other reasons for shooting in black and white were to prevent the shower scene from being too gory and that he was a fan of <i>Les Diaboliques<b>s use of black and white.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Rebello_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rebello" title="">[6]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>To keep costs down and because he was most comfortable around them, Hitchcock took most of his crew from his television series <i><a href="/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents" id="w">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a></i>, including the cinematographer, set designer, script supervisor, and first assistant director.<sup id="_ref-Rebello_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rebello" title="">[6]</a></sup> He hired regular collaborators <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" id="w">Bernard Herrmann</a> as music composer, <a href="/wiki/George_Tomasini" id="w">George Tomasini</a> as editor, and <a href="/wiki/Saul_Bass" id="w">Saul Bass</a> for the title design and storyboarding of the shower scene. In all, his crew cost $62,000.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Through the strength of his reputation, Hitchcock managed to cast Janet Leigh for a quarter of her usual fee, paying only $25,000. (In the 1967 book <i>Hitchcock/Truffaut</i>, Hitchcock said that Leigh owed Paramount one final film on her seven-year contract which she had signed in 1953.) His first choice, Leigh agreed after having only read the novel and making no inquiry into her salary.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup>Her co-star, Anthony Perkins, agreed to $40,000.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Both stars were experienced and proven box-office draws.</p>
<p>Paramount did distribute the film, but four years later Hitchcock sold his stock in Shamley to Universal&#39;s parent company and his next six films were made at and distributed by Universal.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> After another four years, Paramount sold all rights to Universal.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> When the film became a major hit, the Hitchcocks received a much larger share of the profit than they would have otherwise.</p>
<a id="Filming" name="Filming"></a><h3>Filming</h3>
<p>The film, independently produced by Hitchcock, was shot at <a href="/wiki/Revue_Studios" id="w">Revue Studios</a>,<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> the same location as his television show. <i>Psycho</i> was shot on a tight budget of $806,947.55,<sup id="_ref-Leigh_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> beginning on <a href="/wiki/November_11" id="w">November 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1959" id="w">1959</a> and ending on <a href="/wiki/February_1" id="w">February 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1960" id="w">1960</a>.<sup id="_ref-Rebello_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rebello" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Leigh_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Filming started in the morning and finished by six or earlier on Thursdays (when Hitchcock and his wife would dine at <a href="/wiki/Chasen%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">Chasen&#39;s</a>).<sup id="_ref-Leigh_r" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup>
Nearly the whole film was shot with 50&#160;mm lenses on <a href="/wiki/35_mm_film" id="w">35&#160;mm</a> cameras. This trick closely mimicked normal human vision, which helped to involve the audience more.<sup id="_ref-Rebello_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rebello" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Before shooting began in November, Hitchcock dispatched assistant director Hilton Green to <a href="/wiki/Phoenix%2C_Arizona" id="w">Phoenix</a> to scout locations and shoot the opening scene. The shot was supposed to be an aerial shot of Phoenix that slowly zoomed into the hotel window of a passionate Marion and Sam. Ultimately, the helicopter footage proved too shaky and had to be spliced with footage from the studio.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_s" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Another crew filmed day and night footage on <a href="/wiki/State_Route_99_(California)" id="w">Highway 99</a> between <a href="/wiki/Fresno%2C_California" id="w">Fresno</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bakersfield%2C_California" id="w">Bakersfield, California</a> for projection when Marion drives from Phoenix. They also provided the location shots for the scene where she is pulled over by the highway patrolman.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_t" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><div style="wigth:300px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:300px-Psycho05.jpg" title="The original Bates mansion."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300px-Psycho05.jpg" alt="The original Bates mansion." title="The original Bates mansion." class="location-left type-thumb" width="300px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The original Bates mansion.</div></div>

Green also took photos of a prepared list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes like those belonging to Marion and her sister.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_u" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> He also found a girl who looked just like Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_v" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Both the leads, Perkins and Leigh, were given freedom to interpret their roles and improvise as long as it did not involve moving the camera.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_w" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> An example of Perkins&#39; improvisation is Norman&#39;s habit of munching on <a href="/wiki/Candy_corn" id="w">candy corn</a>.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_x" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Throughout filming, Hitchcock created and hid various versions of the &#34;Mother corpse&#34; prop in Janet Leigh&#39;s dressing room closet. There were no hard feelings as Leigh took the joke well, and she wonders whether it was done to keep her on edge and thus more in character or to judge which corpse would be scarier for the audience.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_y" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>During shooting Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Janet&#39;s eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_z" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_A" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Leigh had trouble saying &#34;Not inordinately&#34; for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_B" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Lastly, the discovery of Mother scene required complicated coordination of Mother&#39;s chair turning around, Vera Miles hitting the light bulb, and a lens flare, which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_C" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>According to Hitchcock, a series of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were directed by Hilton Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass&#39;s drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Common_cold" id="w">temperature</a>.&#34; However, upon viewing the <a href="/wiki/Rushes" id="w">dailies</a> of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were &#34;no good&#34; because they didn&#39;t portray &#34;an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Truffaut_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Truffaut" title="">[11]</a></sup> The scene was later reshot by Hitchcock, however, a little of the cut footage made its way into the film.</p>
<p>Filming the murder of Arbogast proved tricky due to the overhead camera angle (to hide the film&#39;s twist). A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chair-like device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_D" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Shower_scene" name="Shower_scene"></a><h3>Shower scene</h3>
<p>The most iconic scene in the film, arguably one of the most iconic scenes in film history, is the murder of Janet Leigh&#39;s character in the <a href="/wiki/Shower" id="w">shower</a>. Although there is little visible gore portrayed on the screen, the shower scene is often regarded as one of the most frightening sequences in cinema history. As such, it spawned numerous myths and legends. It was shot from December 17 to December 23, 1959 and between 71 and 78 angles (the exact number is unknown).<sup id="_ref-Leigh_E" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> The scene &#34;runs 2 minutes and includes 50 cuts.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Dancyger_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dancyger" title="">[12]</a></sup> Most of the <a href="/wiki/Shot_(film)" id="w">shots</a> are <a href="/wiki/Close-up" id="w">extreme close-ups</a> except for <a href="/wiki/Medium_shot" id="w">medium shots</a> in the shower directly before and directly after the murder. The combination of the close shots with the short duration between cuts makes the sequence feel longer, more subjective, more uncontrolled, and more violent than the images themselves were they presented alone or in a wider angle.</p>
<p>In order to capture the straight-on shot of the shower head, the camera had to be equipped with a long lens.

<p>The soundtrack of screeching violins, violas, and cellos was an original all-strings piece by composer <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" id="w">Bernard Herrmann</a> entitled &#34;The Murder.&#34; Hitchcock originally wanted the sequence (and all motel scenes) to play without music<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>, but Herrmann begged him to try it with the cue he had composed. Afterwards Hitchcock agreed that it vastly intensified the scene and he nearly doubled Herrmann&#39;s salary.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Leigh_F" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> The blood in the scene is in fact <a href="/wiki/Chocolate_syrup" id="w">chocolate syrup</a>, which shows up better and has more realistic density than stage blood on black-and-white film.<sup id="_ref-EW_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EW" title="">[1]</a></sup> The sound of the knife entering flesh was created by plunging a knife into a <a href="/wiki/Honeydew_(melon)" id="w">casaba melon</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is sometimes claimed that <a href="/wiki/Janet_Leigh" id="w">Janet Leigh</a> was not in the shower the entire time and a body double was used. However, in an interview with <a href="/wiki/Roger_Ebert" id="w">Roger Ebert</a>, and in the book <i>Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho</i>, Leigh stated that she was in the scene the entire time; Hitchcock used a live model as her stand-in for only the scenes in which Bates wraps up Marion&#39;s body in a shower curtain and places her body in the trunk of her car.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Another popular myth is that in order for Janet Leigh&#39;s scream in the shower to sound realistic, Hitchcock used ice-cold water. This was denied by Leigh on numerous occasions.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Leigh_G" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Also, all of the screams are Leigh&#39;s.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_H" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

</a>
<div class="framecaption">right</div>
Another myth was that Leigh was only told by Hitchcock to stand in the shower, and had no idea that her character was actually going to be murdered the way it was, causing an authentic reaction. This myth also started the myth that Leigh would not take a shower without someone guarding the bathroom door for quite some time after the scene was completed. The most notorious urban legend arising from the production of <i>Psycho</i> began when <a href="/wiki/Saul_Bass" id="w">Saul Bass</a>, the graphic designer, who created many of the title sequences of Hitchcock&#39;s films and storyboarded some of his scenes, claimed that he had actually directed the shower scene. This claim was refuted by several people associated with the film. Leigh, who is the focus of the scene, stated, &#34;...absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I&#39;ve ever given. I&#39;ve said it to his face in front of other people... I was in that shower for seven days, and, believe me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera for every one of those seventy-odd shots.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Leigh_I" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Hilton Green, the assistant director and cameraman, also denies Bass&#39; claim: &#34;There is not a shot in that movie that I didn&#39;t roll the camera for. And I can tell you I never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Leigh_J" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Roger Ebert, a long-time admirer of Hitchcock&#39;s work, was also amused by the rumor, stating, &#34;It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock&#39;s would let someone else direct such a scene.&#34;<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is often claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the &#34;shower scene&#34; never once shows a knife puncturing flesh.<sup id="_ref-ebert_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebert" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Leigh_K" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> However, a frame-by-frame analysis shows that the knife does indeed visibly penetrate the skin by a fraction of an inch, albeit only once, and so briefly (just three <a href="/wiki/Film_frame" id="w">frames of film</a>, or about an eighth of one second) as to be <a href="/wiki/Subliminal" id="w">subliminal</a>. This was done by filming the knife being drawn away, and reversed.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Donald_Spoto" id="w">Donald Spoto</a> in <i>The Dark Side of Genius</i>, Hitchcock&#39;s wife, <a href="/wiki/Alma_Reville" id="w">Alma Reville</a>, spotted a <a href="/wiki/Blooper" id="w">blooper</a> in one of the last screenings of <i>Psycho</i> before its official release: After Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink. The &#34;making of&#34; featurette on the Collector&#39;s Edition DVD also mentions the fact that Alma spotted a blooper in a late screening of the film; however, according to this account, the problem was that Leigh&#39;s character appeared to take a breath. In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences.</p>
<p>Although Marion&#39;s eyes should be dilated after her death, the contacts necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of <a href="/wiki/Acclimatization" id="w">acclimatization</a> in order to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_L" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it, that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to. Then she would lock all the doors and windows and would leave the bathroom and shower door open.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_M" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Janet Leigh and Hitchcock fully discussed what the scene meant: </p><blockquote>Marion had decided to go back to Phoenix, come clean, and take the consequence, so when she stepped into the bathtub it was as if she were stepping into the baptismal waters. The spray beating down on her was purifying the corruption from her mind, purging the evil from her soul. She was like a virgin again, tranquil, at peace.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_N" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Film theorist <a href="/wiki/Robin_Wood_(critic)" id="w">Robin Wood</a> also discusses how the shower washes &#34;away her guilt.&#34; He comments upon the &#34;alienation effect&#34; of killing of the &#34;apparent center of the film&#34; with which spectators had identified.<sup id="_ref-wood_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wood" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Censorship" name="Censorship"></a><h3>Censorship</h3>
<p>According to <i>Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho</i>, the censors in charge of enforcing the <a href="/wiki/Production_Code" id="w">Production Code</a> for the <a href="/wiki/MPAA" id="w">MPAA</a> wrangled with Hitchcock because some censors insisted they could see one of Janet Leigh&#39;s breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Astoundingly, each of the censors reversed their positions -— those who had previously seen the breast now did not, and those who had not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh&#39;s stand-in.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_O" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would reshoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the reshoot, the opening stayed.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_P" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another cause of concern for the censors<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> was that Marion was shown flushing a toilet, with its contents (torn-up paper) fully visible. In film and TV at that time a toilet was never seen, let alone heard. This tradition became so well-known that later shows like <i><a href="/wiki/All_in_the_Family" id="w">All in the Family</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Sanford_and_Son" id="w">Sanford and Son</a></i> added a laugh track every time a flushing sound was heard.</p>
<p>Also, according to the &#34;making of&#34; featurette on the Collector&#39;s Edition DVD, some censors objected to the use of the word &#34;<a href="/wiki/Transvestite" id="w">transvestite</a>&#34; in the film&#39;s closing scenes. This objection was withdrawn after writer <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stefano" id="w">Joseph Stefano</a> took out a <a href="/wiki/Dictionary" id="w">dictionary</a> and proved to them that the word carried no hidden sexual context, but merely referred to &#34;a man who likes to wear women&#39;s clothing&#34;.</p>
<p>Internationally, Hitchcock was forced to make minor changes to the film, mostly to the shower scene. Notably, in Britain the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to and in Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast and a shot of Mother&#39;s corpse were removed.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_Q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The scene with Dr. Fred Richmond was just about forced upon Hitchcock so that the audience would have a sense of relief that everything about Norman could be neatly explained and tidied up.{{Fact}}  However, he had the last laugh by cutting back to Norman Bates after Richmond&#39;s speech and scaring them all over again, just like the novel.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Theatre poster providing notification of &#34;no late admission&#34; policy.</div></div>

Hitchcock did most of the promotion on his own, forbidding Leigh and Perkins from making the usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of them revealing the plot.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_R" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Even critics were not given private screenings but rather had to see the film with the general public, which, despite possibly affecting their reviews,<sup id="_ref-Leigh_T" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> certainly preserved the plot.</p>
<p>The film&#39;s original trailer features a jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer on a tour of the set, and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself. It is &#34;tracked&#34; with Bernard Herrmann&#39;s <i>Psycho</i> theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock&#39;s comedy <i>The Trouble With Harry;</i> most of Hitchcock&#39;s dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after completion of the film, and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Vera Miles don a blonde wig and scream loudly as he pulled the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Since the title, &#34;Psycho,&#34; instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years. However a freeze-frame analysis clearly reveals that it is Vera Miles and not Janet Leigh in the shower during the trailer.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_S" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The most controversial move was Hitchcock&#39;s &#34;no late admission&#34; policy for the film, which was abnormal for the time. It was not entirely original as Clouzot had done the same in France for <i>Les Diaboliques</i>.<sup id="_ref-Rebello_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rebello" title="">[6]</a></sup> Hitchcock thought that if people entered the theater late and never saw the star actress Janet Leigh, they would feel cheated.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_U" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> At first theater owners were up in arms claiming that they would lose business, but after the first day the owners enjoyed long lines of people waiting to see the film.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_V" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The film was so successful that it was reissued to theaters in 1965. A year later <a href="/wiki/CBS" id="w">CBS</a> purchased the television rights for $450,000. CBS planned to televise the film on <a href="/wiki/September_23" id="w">September 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1966" id="w">1966</a>, but three days prior Valerie Percy, the daughter of an <a href="/wiki/Charles_H._Percy" id="w">Illinois senatorial politician candidate</a>, was murdered. As her parents slept mere feet away, she was stabbed a dozen times with a double-edged knife. In light of the murder, CBS agreed to postpone the screening, but as a result of the Apollo pad fire of <a href="/wiki/January_27" id="w">January 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a>, the network washed its hands of <i>Psycho</i>. <sup id="_ref-Leigh_W" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup> Following another successful theatrical reissue in 1969, the film finally made its way to television in one of Universal&#39;s syndicated programming packages for local stations in 1970. <i>Psycho</i> was aired for twenty years in this format, then leased to cable for two years before returning to syndication as part of the &#34;List of a Lifetime&#34; package.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_X" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup>

<p>The public loved the film, with lines stretching outside of theaters as people had to wait for the next showing.

<p>In Britain it shattered attendance records at the London Plaza Cinema, but nearly all British critics panned it, questioning Hitchcock&#39;s taste and judgment.

<p>Perhaps thanks to the public&#39;s response and Hitchcock&#39;s efforts at promoting it, the critics did a re-review, and the film was praised.

<p>In his novel, Bloch used an uncommon plot structure: he repeatedly introduced sympathetic <a href="/wiki/Protagonist" id="w">protagonists</a>, then killed them off. This played on his reader&#39;s expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off <a href="/wiki/Janet_Leigh" id="w">Janet Leigh</a>&#39;s character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking and disorienting turn of events in 1960.</p>
<p>The most original and influential moment in the film is the &#34;shower scene,&#34; which became iconic in pop culture because it is often regarded as one of the most terrifying scenes ever filmed. Part of its effectiveness was due to the use of startling editing techniques borrowed from the Soviet <a href="/wiki/Soviet_montage_theory" id="w">montage</a> filmmakers,{{Fact}} and to <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" id="w">Bernard Herrmann</a>&#39;s intense and imaginative musical score.</p>
<p><i>Psycho</i> is a prime example of the type of film that appeared in the 1960s after the erosion of the <a href="/wiki/Production_Code" id="w">Production Code</a>. It was unprecedented in its depiction of sexuality and violence, right from the opening scene where Sam and Marion are shown as lovers sharing the same bed. In the Production Code standards of that time, unmarried couples shown in the same bed would be taboo. In addition, the censors were upset by the shot of a flushing toilet; at that time, the idea of seeing a toilet onscreen - let alone being flushed - was taboo in American movies and TV shows. According to <a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" id="w">Entertainment Weekly</a>, &#34;The Production Code censors... had no objection to the bloodletting, the <a href="/wiki/Oedipus" id="w">oedipal</a> murder theme, or even the shower scene—but did ask that Hitchcock remove the word <i><a href="/wiki/Transvestism" id="w">transvestite</a></i> from the film, He didn&#39;t.&#34;<sup id="_ref-EW_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EW" title="">[1]</a></sup> At one point, Hitchcock actually considered releasing the film without <a href="/wiki/Hays_Code" id="w">censorial</a> approval. Its box office success helped propel Hollywood toward more graphic displays of previously-censored themes.</p>
<p><i>Psycho</i> is widely considered to be the first film in the <a href="/wiki/Slasher_film" id="w">slasher film</a> genre.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Interpretation" name="Interpretation"></a><h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the very first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out the window. The stuffed birds&#39; shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Mother is seen in only shadows until the very end. More subtly, backlighting turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila&#39;s head.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_Z" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mirrors reflect: Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman&#39;s sunglasses, her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership&#39;s bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion&#39;s windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as foreshadowing of the shower, and it letting up can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_Z" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are coded references to birds. Marion&#39;s last name is Crane, she is from Phoenix, and she drives a Ford Falcon. Norman&#39;s hobby is stuffing birds, and he comments that Marion eats like a bird.<sup id="_ref-Leigh_Z" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leigh" title="">[5]</a></sup>The room walls are decorated with drawings of birds.</p>
<a id="Psychoanalytic_criticism" name="Psychoanalytic_criticism"></a><h3>Psychoanalytic criticism</h3>
<p>Psycho has been called &#34;the first psychoanalytical thriller.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Kaganski_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kaganski" title="">[33]</a></sup> The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film. &#34;[T]he shower scene is both feared and desired,&#34; wrote French film critic Serge Kaganski, &#34;Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits, but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists, since Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Kaganski_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kaganski" title="">[33]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In his documentary <i><a href="/wiki/The_Pervert%26%2339%3Bs_Guide_to_Cinema" id="w">The Pervert&#39;s Guide to Cinema</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek" id="w">Slavoj Žižek</a> remarks that Norman Bates&#39; mansion has three floors, parallelling the <a href="/wiki/Id%2C_ego%2C_and_super-ego" id="w">three levels</a> that <a href="/wiki/Psychoanalysis" id="w">psychoanalysis</a> attributes to the human mind: the first floor would be the <i>superego</i>, where Bates&#39; mother lives on; the ground floor is then Bates&#39; <i>ego</i>, where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates&#39; <i>id</i>. Žižek interprets Bates&#39; moving his mother&#39;s corpse from first floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

The film spawned three sequels: <i><a href="/wiki/Psycho_II" id="w">Psycho II</a></i> (1983), <i><a href="/wiki/Psycho_III" id="w">Psycho III</a></i> (1986), and the prequel <i><a href="/wiki/Psycho_IV:_The_Beginning" id="w">Psycho IV: The Beginning</a></i> (1990), the last being a <a href="/wiki/Television_movie" id="w">TV movie</a> written by the original screenplay author <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stefano" id="w">Joseph Stefano</a>. Anthony Perkins returned to his role of Norman Bates in all three sequels, also directing part III, and the voice of Norman Bates&#39; mother was maintained by noted radio actress <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Gregg" id="w">Virginia Gregg</a> with the exception of <i>Psycho IV</i> where the role was played by <a href="/wiki/Olivia_Hussey" id="w">Olivia Hussey</a>. Vera Miles also reprised her role of Lila Crane in <i>Psycho II</i>. The sequels were generally considered inferior to the original.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> Hitchcock did not participate in the making of any of the <i>Psycho</i> sequels (he died before any of them were made).</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Spinoff" id="w">spinoff</a> of the <i>Psycho</i> series is <i><a href="/wiki/Bates_Motel" id="w">Bates Motel</a></i> (1987) a failed <a href="/wiki/Television_pilot" id="w">TV pilot</a> turned TV movie. In it, the Bates Motel is bequeathed to Alex West (played by <a href="/wiki/Bud_Cort" id="w">Bud Cort</a>), a fellow inmate of the institution Norman Bates has been committed to. Because of Norman&#39;s death, it is not considered canon to the rest of the <i>Psycho</i> series. Anthony Perkins declined to appear in the pilot, so Norman&#39;s cameo appearance was played by <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Paul" id="w">Kurt Paul</a>, who was Perkins&#39; stunt double on <i>Psycho II</i> and <i>III</i>.</p>
<p>In 1998, <a href="/wiki/Gus_Van_Sant" id="w">Gus Van Sant</a> directed a <a href="/wiki/Psycho_(1998_film)" id="w">remake</a> of <i>Psycho</i>. The film is in color and features a different cast, but aside from this it is a virtually shot-for-shot remake copying Hitchcock&#39;s camera movements and editing.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/A_Conversation_with_Norman" id="w">A Conversation with Norman</a></i> (2005), directed by <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_M._Parisen" id="w">Jonathan M. Parisen</a>, was a film inspired by <i>Psycho</i>. It premiered in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> just three days short of the 45th anniversary of the premiere of the original film.

Laurie is shown walking into the bathroom and being shown through the shower curtain in the same manner Mrs. Bates was in <i>Psycho</i>. When she pulls back the curtains to the familiar shrieking strings, Kelso screams, and she begins beating him with a brush, telling him to get out of her shower. The beating with the brush imitates the knife-stabbing. She then flushes the toilet, causing the water to go cold and Kelso to scream like Janet Leigh. Laurie then exclaims that Kelso has spilled her shampoo, and we see the red shampoo going down the drain just like the blood in <i>Psycho</i>.</li>
