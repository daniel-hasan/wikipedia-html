The <b>Constitution of the State of New Jersey</b> is the <a href="/wiki/Constitution" id="w">basic governing document</a> of the <a href="/wiki/U.S._State" id="w">State</a> of <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a>. In addition to three <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> Royal Charters issued for <a href="/wiki/East_Jersey" id="w">East Jersey</a>, <a href="/wiki/West_Jersey" id="w">West Jersey</a> and united New Jersey while they were still colonies, the state has been governed by three constitutions. The first was issued in 1776 shortly after New Jersey ratified the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence" id="w">United States Declaration of Independence</a>; the second was issued in 1844; and the current document was issued in 1947.</p>
<p>The state constitution reinforces the basic rights found in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution" id="w">United States Constitution</a>, but also contains several unique provisions, such as regulations governing the operation of casinos. At 26,159 words,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> the document is slightly shorter than the average <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/State_constitution" id="w">state constitution</a> (about 28,300 words).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

three fundamental documents had governed the territory now known as New Jersey. The first was the <a href="/wiki/Concession_and_Agreement" id="w">Concession and Agreement</a>, which was written in 1665 by the colony&#39;s proprietors <a href="/wiki/Lord_John_Berkeley" id="w">Lord John Berkeley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sir_George_Carteret" id="w">Sir George Carteret</a>, and included a provision granting religious freedom. After Berkeley and Carteret sold New Jersey to the Quakers, the colony was split into <a href="/wiki/West_Jersey" id="w">West</a> and <a href="/wiki/East_Jersey" id="w">East Jersey</a>. Each had its own constitution: the <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_New_Jersey_State_Constitution#West Jersey Constitution" id="w">West Jersey Constitution</a> (1681) and the <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_New_Jersey_State_Constitution#East Jersey Constitution" id="w">East Jersey Constitution</a> (1683).<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The two were reunited in 1702 by <a href="/wiki/Anne_of_Great_Britain" id="w">Queen Anne</a>.</p>
<p>New Jersey&#39;s first state constitution was adopted on <a href="/wiki/July_2" id="w">July 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1776" id="w">1776</a>. The <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" id="w">American Revolutionary War</a> was underway and <a href="/wiki/George_Washington" id="w">George Washington</a> recently had been defeated in <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>, putting the state in danger of invasion. The 1776 New Jersey State Constitution was drafted in five days and ratified within the next two days to establish a temporary government, thereby preventing New Jersey from collapsing and descending into anarchy.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Among other provisions, it granted unmarried women and blacks who met property requirements the <a href="/wiki/Suffrage" id="w">right to vote</a>. It did not specify an amendment procedure and had to be replaced entirely in a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_meeting)" id="w">constitutional convention</a>.</p>
<p>The succeeding constitution, adopted on <a href="/wiki/June_29" id="w">June 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/1844" id="w">1844</a>, restricted suffrage to white males. It <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_powers" id="w">separated the government&#39;s powers</a> into judicial, legislative, and executive branches and granted the people (as opposed to the legislature) the ability to elect a governor. It also formally limited state debt, a predecessor of many contemporary &#34;debt ceiling&#34; clauses.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The constitution was amended in 1875,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> mainly to conform to the <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">Fourteenth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">Fifteenth</a> Amendments.

Article VII involves the public officers and employees, including appointment/nomination, compensation, promotions, affirmations, and powers. The role of officers in the state government is discussed. Before the officer enters the duties of office, the officer must subscribe an <a href="/wiki/Oath" id="w">oath</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Appointments for officers are based upon merit, fitness, and <a href="/wiki/Examination" id="w">examinations</a>.

<p>No state employee may be impeached until he/she has served in office for two years. Following that, the impeachment process is similar to that of the Federal level: an absolute majority in the lower house (the General Assembly) against the employee causes a trial to take place in the upper house (the State Senate) with the Chief Justice presiding. Unlike the Federal process, the oath necessary to participate in the impeachment sessions is specified and requires the senators to &#34;truly and impartially&#34; address the charge as a reminder that they are exercising more judicial functions. ⅔ of the votes, or 27 votes, are needed to convict, but the President of the Senate is excluded from the trial, so the required percentage is slightly higher than ⅔ of 40.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The maximum penalty is removal from office with disqualification to hold further state office. However, the impeachment doesn&#39;t count towards the restriction on <a href="/wiki/Double_jeopardy" id="w">double jeopardy</a>; after being convicted by the senate, a person could then be tried by the judiciary and punished further.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> If this crime was listed according to Article II, Section I, Item 7, the offender can be <a href="/wiki/Disfranchisement" id="w">disenfranchised</a>.</p>

A council of local mandates is created, and regulation regarding the appointment of the members for this body. Some moneys from the <a href="/wiki/Corporate_tax" id="w">Corporate Business Tax Act</a>  are directed to the General Fund.

It mainly consists of an interim list of districts and the number of Senators they can elect until the next <a href="/wiki/United_States_Census" id="w">United States Census</a> comes around and is received by the Governor. It also contains provisions for apportioning ten districts of the lower house. If it is deadlocked, the Chief Justice of the <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey_Supreme_Court" id="w">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> will appoint an 11th and then the vote is by absolute majority. It was passed on election day, 1966, but was first applied on <a href="/wiki/January_17" id="w">January 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>. This was superseded in 1995 by Article II, Section II.  It took effect on <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1978" id="w">1978</a>. Section 7, the final section of this constitution, was passed in a referendum on <a href="/wiki/November_8" id="w">November 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, and takes full effect at <a href="/wiki/Noon" id="w">noon</a>, <a href="/wiki/January_19" id="w">January 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/2010" id="w">2010</a>, following the transfer of power to the next executive.i like in my bootay</p>
<a id="Criticisms" name="Criticisms"></a><h2>Criticisms</h2>
<p>The New Jersey State Constitution has been criticized, mainly for its succession plan. As seen in during the time following  <a href="/wiki/Jim_McGreevey" id="w">Jim McGreevey</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Resignation" id="w">resignation</a>, New Jersey was exposed as having a disorganized executive succession plan. Senate President <a href="/wiki/Richard_Codey" id="w">Richard Codey</a> assumed command, and since he [legally] held both positions, he had the most power of any governor in the country. The problem lays in the state constitution and an amendment passed to removed the possibility of Executive and Legislative conflation.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> The constitution is also censured for having a very powerful executive branch.<sup id="_ref-ahc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ahc" title="">[40]</a></sup> A state such as <a href="/wiki/Alaska" id="w">Alaska</a> would have a viable reason for creating such a strong executive department, i.e., to keep senators from declaring &#34;absentee&#34; and muddling in the affairs of the state of Alaska.<sup id="_ref-ahc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ahc" title="">[40]</a></sup> New Jersey has no such reason, some consider the two constitutions a signal of an emerging trend in government: a strong executive. The constitution is denounced for its unorganized composure. Paragraphs traditionally in Article I, e.g., the banning of <a href="/wiki/Ex_post_facto" id="w">ex post facto</a> laws, are in Article IV &#34;Legislative.&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
