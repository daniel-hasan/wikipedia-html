<b>Ian James Thorpe <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Australia" id="w">OAM</a></b> (born <a href="/wiki/13_October" id="w">13 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1982" id="w">1982</a> in <a href="/wiki/Sydney" id="w">Sydney</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_South_Wales" id="w">New South Wales</a>), also known as the <b><i>Thorpedo</i></b> or <b><i>Thorpey</i></b>, is a former <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australian</a> <a href="/wiki/Freestyle_swimming" id="w">freestyle</a> <a href="/wiki/Swimming#Competitive swimming" id="w">swimmer</a>.

His athletic achievements made him one of Australia&#39;s most popular athletes, with his philanthropy and clean image earning him further recognition as the <a href="/wiki/Australian_of_the_Year" id="w">Young Australian of the Year</a> in 2000.<sup id="_ref-gsiprofile_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gsiprofile" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the age of 14, he became the youngest male ever to represent Australia,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> and his victory in the 400&#160;metre freestyle at the <a href="/wiki/1998_World_Aquatics_Championships" id="w">1998 Perth World Championships</a> made him the youngest ever individual male World Champion.<sup id="_ref-andrews_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-andrews" title="">[6]</a></sup> After that victory, Thorpe dominated the 400&#160;m freestyle, winning the event at every Olympic, World, <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" id="w">Commonwealth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pan_Pacific_Swimming_Championships" id="w">Pan Pacific Swimming Championships</a> until his break after the 2004 Olympics.<sup id="_ref-abc career_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup> Aside from 13 individual long-course world records, Thorpe anchored the Australian relay teams, numbering the victories in the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;m and the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;200&#160;m freestyle relays <a href="/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics" id="w">in Sydney</a>, among his five relay world records. His wins in the 200&#160;m and 400&#160;m and his bronze in the 100&#160;m freestyle <a href="/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics" id="w">in Athens</a> have made him the only person to have won medals in the 100-200-400 combination.<sup id="_ref-abc career_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a year away from swimming, scheduling a return for the <a href="/wiki/2006_Commonwealth_Games" id="w">2006 Commonwealth Games</a>. However, he was forced to withdraw due to illness. Subsequent training camps were interrupted, and he announced his retirement in November 2006, citing waning motivation.<sup id="_ref-abc retire_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc retire" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Early_years" name="Early_years"></a><h2>Early years</h2>
<p>Thorpe was a large baby, weighing 4.1&#160;kg (9.02&#160;lb) and measuring 0.59&#160;m (1&#160;ft 11&#160;in) in length at birth. He grew up in a family with a sporting pedigree in the suburb of <a href="/wiki/Milperra%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Milperra</a>.<sup id="_ref-dyk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dyk" title="">[9]</a></sup> Thorpe&#39;s father, Ken, was a promising <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricketer</a> at junior level, representing <a href="/wiki/Bankstown%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Bankstown</a> cricket club in Sydney&#39;s grade competition.<sup id="_ref-dyk_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dyk" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-smh early_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-smh early" title="">[10]</a></sup> A talented <a href="/wiki/Batsman" id="w">batsman</a>, he once topped the season&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Batting_average#Cricket" id="w">batting averages</a> ahead of former Australian <a href="/wiki/Captain_(cricket)" id="w">captain</a> <a href="/wiki/Bob_Simpson_(cricketer)" id="w">Bob Simpson</a>. However, paternal pressure detracted from Ken&#39;s enjoyment, and he retired aged 26. Thorpe&#39;s mother Margaret played A-grade <a href="/wiki/Netball" id="w">netball</a>,<sup id="_ref-smh early_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-smh early" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hunter1-6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hunter1-6" title="">[11]</a></sup> but Thorpe did not seem to inherit his parents&#39; ball skills. His elder sister, Christina, had been given medical advice that swimming would strengthen a broken wrist, so by chance, the five-year-old Thorpe followed her in taking swimming lessons .<sup id="_ref-smh early_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-smh early" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Due to his unhappy experiences, Ken Thorpe maintained that enjoyment was the most important aspect of his children&#39;s participation in sport.<sup id="_ref-hunter1-6_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hunter1-6" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a young child, Thorpe was sidelined due to a <a href="/wiki/Chlorine" id="w">chlorine</a> <a href="/wiki/Allergy" id="w">allergy</a>.<sup id="_ref-andrews_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-andrews" title="">[6]</a></sup> Because of this, he did not swim in his first race until age seven (at a school carnival). His allergy forced him to swim with his head out of the water; despite this ungainly technique, he won the race, primarily because of his significant size advantage.<sup id="_ref-dyk_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dyk" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Thorpe gradually overcame the allergy and progressed to the captaincy of New South Wales for the Australian Primary Schools titles in <a href="/wiki/1994_in_sports" id="w">1994</a>. He subsequently won nine individual gold medals at the State Age Short Course Championships in September of that year.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> In 1995 he started his secondary education at <a href="/wiki/East_Hills_Boys_Technology_High_School" id="w">East Hills Boys Technology High School</a>,<sup id="_ref-dyk_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dyk" title="">[9]</a></sup> switching coaches to swim alongside his sister under the tutelage of <a href="/wiki/Doug_Frost" id="w">Doug Frost</a>. It was a busy year for his family, with Christina being selected for the national team to compete at the <a href="/wiki/1995_Pan_Pacific_Swimming_Championships" id="w">1995 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships</a> in <a href="/wiki/Atlanta%2C_Georgia" id="w">Atlanta</a>. Ian, now six feet tall, competed at his first National Age Championships, winning bronze medals in the 200&#160;m and 400&#160;m freestyle. He won all ten events at the annual State Age Championships.<sup id="_ref-andrews_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-andrews" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="National_debut" name="National_debut"></a><h3>National debut</h3>
<p>Thorpe competed at the <a href="/wiki/1996_in_sports" id="w">1996</a> National Age Championships in <a href="/wiki/Brisbane" id="w">Brisbane</a>, winning five gold, two silver and two bronze medals.<sup id="_ref-abc career_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup> His times in the 400&#160;m freestyle and 200&#160;m <a href="/wiki/Backstroke" id="w">backstroke</a> qualified him for the Australian Championships, which were selection events for the <a href="/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1996 Atlanta Olympics</a>. Frost knew that Thorpe had no realistic chance of finishing among the top two in any event, which would have meant Olympic selection at an age of only 13 years and 6 months. He sent him to <a href="/wiki/Sydney" id="w">Sydney</a> anyway to gain racing experience at the senior national level. As expected, Thorpe missed selection, as he finished 23rd in the 400&#160;m freestyle and 36th in the 200&#160;m backstroke.<sup id="_ref-h96_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-h96" title="">[17]</a></sup> At the end of the year, he qualified for the Australian Short Course Championships. It was another chance for Thorpe to gain national selection, as they were the trials for the <a href="/wiki/1997_FINA_Short_Course_World_Championships" id="w">1997 FINA Short Course World Championships</a>. He qualified in second place for his first national final in the 400&#160;m individual medley, but swam more slowly in the final to miss selection.<sup id="_ref-h97_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-h97" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>1997 began at the State Championships in January, where his time of 3&#160;min 59.43&#160;s in the 400&#160;m took eight seconds off his personal best, and made him the first 14-year-old in Australia to cover the distance in less than four minutes. Ranked fourth in Australia for the event,<sup id="_ref-h97_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-h97" title="">[18]</a></sup> Thorpe went into the <a href="/wiki/1997_in_sports" id="w">1997</a> Australian Championships in <a href="/wiki/Adelaide" id="w">Adelaide</a> as a serious contender for national selection for the <a href="/wiki/1997_Pan_Pacific_Swimming_Championships" id="w">1997 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships</a> in <a href="/wiki/Fukuoka%2C_Fukuoka" id="w">Fukuoka</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>. With a top-three finish and a specific qualifying time required, Thorpe focused on the 400&#160;m freestyle after injuries to the 400&#160;m freestyle Olympic medallists <a href="/wiki/Kieren_Perkins" id="w">Kieren Perkins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Kowalski" id="w">Daniel Kowalski</a>. Thorpe went on to win bronze behind 16-year-old Queenslander <a href="/wiki/Grant_Hackett" id="w">Grant Hackett</a>, setting a new personal best of 3&#160;min 53.44&#160;s. It was a new world age record and the first of many battles with Hackett.<sup id="_ref-h97p_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-h97p" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Aged 14 years and 5 months, Thorpe became the youngest male ever to be selected for the Australian team,<sup id="_ref-andrews_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-andrews" title="">[6]</a></sup> surpassing <a href="/wiki/John_Konrads" id="w">John Konrads</a>&#39; record by one month.<sup id="_ref-ABC profile_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ABC profile" title="">[20]</a></sup> Frost cited Thorpe&#39;s selection as a cause for his eventual focus on freestyle. Thorpe continued his good form at the National Age Championships when he contested all twelve events, winning ten individual gold and two bronze medals, and setting six national records in the process.<sup id="_ref-smh early_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-smh early" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-h97p_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-h97p" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<p>In June, two months before the 1997 Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe required an <a href="/wiki/Vermiform_appendix" id="w">appendix</a> operation, causing him to miss two weeks of training.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Thorpe came fourth in his heat of the 200&#160;m freestyle after achieving a personal best of 1&#160;min 51.46&#160;s. Despite not qualifying for the final, he earned selection for the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;200&#160;m freestyle relay team. There he and his team of <a href="/wiki/Michael_Klim" id="w">Michael Klim</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ian_van_der_Wal" id="w">Ian van der Wal</a> and Hackett claimed silver, making him the youngest ever Pan Pacific medalist. In his first individual final at international level, Thorpe came from fifth at the 300&#160;m mark to claim silver in the 400&#160;m freestyle behind Hackett in a time of 3&#160;min 49.64&#160;s.<sup id="_ref-andrews_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-andrews" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-andrews h_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-andrews h" title="">[22]</a></sup> His finishing burst was to become a trademark, and his time would have given him silver at the <a href="/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics" id="w">Atlanta Olympics</a>.<sup id="_ref-smh early_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-smh early" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> In October 1997, a few days before his fifteenth birthday, Thorpe competed in qualifying trials in <a href="/wiki/Brisbane" id="w">Brisbane</a> for the <a href="/wiki/1998_World_Aquatics_Championships" id="w">1998 World Aquatics Championships</a>.

Thorpe&#39;s first international appearance in his home country, at the <a href="/wiki/1998_World_Aquatics_Championships" id="w">1998 World Championships</a> in Perth, began with the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;200&#160;m freestyle relay. Swimming the third leg after Klim and Hackett, Thorpe broke away from 200&#160;m butterfly Olympic champion <a href="/wiki/Tom_Malchow" id="w">Tom Malchow</a> to set a split time of 1&#160;min 47.67&#160;s, the same as Klim&#39;s winning time in the 200&#160;m final. By the end of Thorpe&#39;s leg, the Australians were two seconds ahead of the world record pace, and three seconds ahead of the Americans, having extended the lead by two body lengths. Although anchorman Kowalski finished outside the world record, it was the first time that Australia had won the event at the global level since <a href="/wiki/1956_in_sports" id="w">1956</a>.<sup id="_ref-abc career_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup> Thorpe was ranked fourth in the world before the 400&#160;m final, which Hackett led from the outset. Hackett established a comfortable 2.29&#160;s lead over Thorpe by the 300&#160;m mark, and although Thorpe reduced the margin to 1.53&#160;s at the 350&#160;m mark, Hackett lead until Thorpe passed him on the final stroke. Thorpe&#39;s time was the fourth fastest in history and made him the youngest ever male individual world champion.<sup id="_ref-andrews_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-andrews" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-andrews h_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-andrews h" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a result of the media attention generated by his win on home soil, Thorpe received multiple offers for television commercials and was often surrounded by autograph hunters. He became a high-profile supporter of the <a href="/wiki/Children%26%2339%3Bs_Cancer_Institute" id="w">Children&#39;s Cancer Institute</a>, after his sister Christina&#39;s future brother-in-law Michael Williams became gravely ill with cancer.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

Thorpe&#39;s next competition was in March at the Australian Championships in <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" id="w">Melbourne</a>, which were selection trials for the <a href="/wiki/1998_Commonwealth_Games" id="w">1998 Commonwealth Games</a> in <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" id="w">Malaysia</a>. Thorpe&#39;s improvement continued when he defeated Klim in the 200&#160;m freestyle in 1&#160;min 47.24&#160;s, faster than Klim&#39;s winning time at the World Championship two months earlier. Thorpe&#39;s time was a Commonwealth record and with it, he secured his first national title. He then claimed the 400&#160;m freestyle title from Hackett and clocked 50.36&#160;s in the 100&#160;m freestyle. His time earned silver in his first 100&#160;m race at the national level, gaining him Commonwealth selection in three individual events.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thorpe&#39;s rise continued when the Australians arrived in <a href="/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur" id="w">Kuala Lumpur</a> during September for the Commonwealth Games. Thorpe&#39;s first event was the 200&#160;m freestyle, where he led throughout to record a time just one hundredth of a second outside <a href="/wiki/Giorgio_Lamberti" id="w">Giorgio Lamberti</a>&#39;s world record. He then combined with Klim, Kowalski and <a href="/wiki/Matt_Dunn" id="w">Matt Dunn</a> in the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;200&#160;m freestyle relay to break the world record of the <a href="/wiki/Unified_Team" id="w">Unified Team</a> set in 1992 by 0.09&#160;s.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Thorpe&#39;s run ended when a personal best of 50.21&#160;s in the 100&#160;m freestyle was only sufficient for fourth place, but he returned to victory with the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;m freestyle relay team. He claimed a fourth gold in the 400&#160;m freestyle, setting another personal best, just 0.55&#160;s slower than Kieren Perkins&#39; <a href="/wiki/1994_in_sports" id="w">1994</a> mark.<sup id="_ref-abc career_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-andrews_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-andrews" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thorpe left school at the end of year after completing Year 10. His decision caused concerns that concentrating on swimming alone could lead to burn out. Thorpe disagreed, pointing to his informal search for knowledge, stating that &#34;Swimming is a small part of my life&#34;. His impact in the swimming community was acknowledged when he became the youngest male swimmer to be named by <i><a href="/wiki/Swimming_World_Magazine" id="w">Swimming World Magazine</a></i> as the <a href="/wiki/Swimming_World_Swimmers_of_the_Year" id="w">World Swimmer of the Year</a>.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/1999_in_sports" id="w">1999</a> began with heavy media expectations that Thorpe would inevitably break both 200&#160;m and 400&#160;m world records, given his continuing physical growth. The first opportunity came in late March at the 1999 Australian Championships in Brisbane, which doubled as a selection event for the <a href="/wiki/1999_Pan_Pacific_Swimming_Championships" id="w">1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships</a>. Thorpe again won the 400&#160;m, but Perkins&#39; record eluded him, this time by just 0.05&#160;s. Hackett turned the tables in the 200&#160;m event, passing Thorpe in the final 50&#160;m to win Thorpe&#39;s title.<sup id="_ref-andrews h_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-andrews h" title="">[22]</a></sup> Although both were outside Lamberti&#39;s mark, Hackett went on to break it the following night in a relay event.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Thorpe finished the Championships by continuing his improvement in the 100&#160;m freestyle, posting a time of 49.98&#160;s, his first under the 50&#160;s barrier. The Australian team then travelled to <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a> for the <a href="/wiki/1999_FINA_Short_Course_World_Championships" id="w">1999 FINA Short Course World Championships</a>, where Thorpe broke Lamberti&#39;s mark in the 200&#160;m freestyle, the longest standing world record at the time.<sup id="_ref-andrews_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-andrews" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> This was the start of a three year phase where Thorpe was to set his 13 individual long course world records. He lead the men&#39;s relay team to unprecedented success in relay events, scoring historic victories over the Americans. Thorpe was to peak in 2001 when he became the first person to win six gold medals at one world championships, setting three world records and helping Australia top the medal tally at a global meet for the first time since 1956.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/1999_Pan_Pacific_Swimming_Championships" id="w">1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships</a> were held in August at <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Olympic_Park" id="w">Sydney Olympic Park</a>, and were viewed as a rehearsal for the <a href="/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics" id="w">2000 Summer Olympics</a> to be held in the same venue. With Thorpe expected to deliver world records at his first international meet in Sydney, the event was shown live on Australian television for the first time.  The opening night saw him pitted against Hackett and <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ryk_Neethling" id="w">Ryk Neethling</a> in the 400&#160;m freestyle final. The trio reached the 200&#160;m mark in a group, on world record pace, before Thorpe broke away, recording a split time 1.86&#160;s ahead of world-record pace at 300&#160;m. He extended his lead to four body lengths by the 350&#160;m mark and finished in a time of 3&#160;min 41.83&#160;s, cutting almost two seconds from the world record,<sup id="_ref-abc career_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup> and covering the second half in almost the same time as the first.<sup id="_ref-firstwr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-firstwr" title="">[34]</a></sup> Talbot reacted to the performance by dubbing Thorpe as &#34;the greatest swimmer we&#39;ve [Australia] ever had&#34;, whilst four-time American Olympic gold medalist <a href="/wiki/Rowdy_Gaines" id="w">Rowdy Gaines</a>, commentating for <a href="/wiki/NBC" id="w">NBC</a>, said &#34;..he went into a balls-out sprint at 250 - and I have never seen anything like that...I have been around swimming a long time and it&#39;s the most amazing swim I&#39;ve ever seen, hands down.&#34; A formula used by the International Swimming Statisticians Association to compare world records in different events gave his performance the highest score of all current world records.

Thorpe set an Australian record relay split of 48.55&#160;s. Even taking into account a 0.6–0.7&#160;s for a flying relay start, his split time was almost 1&#160;s faster than his individual best of 49.98&#160;s.<sup id="_ref-firstwr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-firstwr" title="">[34]</a></sup> It was to be the first of many occasions in which he would anchor the Australian relay teams to victory over the Americans, with splits consistently faster than his equivalent individual times. The following night, in the semi-finals of the 200&#160;m freestyle, Thorpe broke Hackett&#39;s world record by 0.33&#160;s, clocking 1&#160;min 46.34&#160;s.<sup id="_ref-abc career_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> The next day in the final, he again broke the record, lowering it to 1&#160;min 46.0&#160;s.<sup id="_ref-abc career_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> He finished his competition by leading off the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;200&#160;m freestyle team with Klim, Hackett and <a href="/wiki/Bill_Kirby" id="w">Bill Kirby</a> to victory.

<p>Immediately after the Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe&#39;s management announced his signing to <a href="/wiki/Adidas" id="w">Adidas</a> for an undisclosed six-figure sum, stating that he would race in their new bodysuit. This presented a dilemma, as the national team was sponsored and wore outfits designed by <a href="/wiki/Speedo" id="w">Speedo</a>, leading to months of protracted discussions and uncertainty.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> To compound his commercial difficulties, Thorpe had a uncertain end to the sporting year when, in October, he broke a bone in his ankle whilst jogging.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> However his performance throughout the year were recognised when he was again named as the World Swimmer of the Year by <i>Swimming World</i>, and by Swimming Australia as its Swimmer of the Year.

<p>Thorpe started <a href="/wiki/2000_in_sports" id="w">2000</a> looking to add a third individual event to his Olympic schedule. He explored his options by contesting the 1500&#160;m freestyle at the New South Wales Championships in January, which he won. Thorpe embarked on a European FINA World Cup tour in order to hone his racecraft, but this was overshadowed by comments made by German head coach <a href="/wiki/Manfred_Thiesmann" id="w">Manfred Thiesmann</a> accusing him of using <a href="/wiki/Anabolic_steroid" id="w">steroids</a>.<sup id="_ref-Talbot blood_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Talbot blood" title="">[43]</a></sup> Thorpe&#39;s difficulties heightened at the subsequent <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> leg of the tour in <a href="/wiki/Berlin" id="w">Berlin</a>, when a standoff over a drug-test arose when officials wanted to take an unsealed sample due to lack of containers. After the standoff was resolved,<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> Thorpe proceeded to cut more than 1.5&#160;s from his world short course record in the 200&#160;m freestyle.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> Given the context of the race, Thorpe rated it as his best-ever performance, ahead of his victories at Olympic and World level.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> On returning from Europe, Thorpe faced further uncertainty until he was granted permission to wear his Adidas suit instead of the Australian uniforms provided by Speedo.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the past uncertainties resolved, Thorpe proceeded to the Olympic selection trials at <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Olympic_Park" id="w">Sydney Olympic Park</a> in May 2000.

Entering the Olympics, the Australian public expected Thorpe to deliver multiple world records and gold medals as a formality; Sydney&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph_(Australia)" id="w">Daily Telegraph</a></i> posted a front-page spread headlined <i>Invincible</i>. Thorpe cruised through the heats of the 400&#160;m on the first morning of competition, posting a new Olympic record and shortening bookmakers&#39; odds to 50-1.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> By the time the final was held that night, the pressure had intensified &#8212; the host nation had yet to win its first gold medal. Thorpe led throughout, and although <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Massimiliano_Rosolino" id="w">Massimiliano Rosolino</a> was within a body length at the 300&#160;m mark, Thorpe&#39;s finishing kick extended the final margin to three body lengths. This set a new world record of 3&#160;min 40.59&#160;s.<sup id="_ref-oly2000 d1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oly2000 d1" title="">[54]</a></sup> Secret tests carried out by the <a href="/wiki/Italian_Olympic_Committee" id="w">Italian Olympic Committee</a> prior to the Olympics later showed that Rosolino had abnormal levels of human growth hormone.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> Rosolino aside, Thorpe had left bronze medallist <a href="/wiki/Klete_Keller" id="w">Klete Keller</a> fifteen metres in arrears.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thorpe lined up later in the night alongside Klim, <a href="/wiki/Chris_Fydler" id="w">Chris Fydler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ashley_Callus" id="w">Ashley Callus</a> to anchor the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;m freestyle relay, an event which the Americans had never lost at Olympic level. The third leg ended with Australia only an arm&#39;s length ahead of the United States. Thorpe timed his dive much better than <a href="/wiki/Gary_Hall_Jr." id="w">Gary Hall Jr.</a>, and surfaced a body length ahead. Hall&#39;s sprinting ability allowed him to open a lead by the final turn, but Thorpe&#39;s finishing kick overhauled him in the final metres, sparking wild celebrations amongst the partisan crowd.<sup id="_ref-abc career_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-oly2000 d1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oly2000 d1" title="">[54]</a></sup> It evoked an uncharacteristic celebration from Thorpe, who immediately jumped out of the pool, screaming and hugging his ecstatic teammates. He even went as far as playing <a href="/wiki/Air_guitar" id="w">air guitar</a> to mock Hall&#39;s pre-race claim that the Americans would &#34;smash&#34; the Australians <i>like guitars</i>.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Thorpe broke the 200&#160;m freestyle Olympic record in the heats the following morning,<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> his main rival <a href="/wiki/Pieter_van_den_Hoogenband" id="w">Pieter van den Hoogenband</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a> conceded defeat. However, Van den Hoogenband showed his hand in the semi-finals by cutting more than a second off his personal best, to set a new world record of 1&#160;min 45.35&#160;s. Thorpe qualified second and was under immense pressure to win the final the following day after his double gold on the first night.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> Van den Hoogenband started quickly and Thorpe chased him, reaching the 100&#160;m mark just 0.04&#160;s behind. Both swimmers turned at 150&#160;m in identical times. As a result of starting harder than usual, Thorpe faded as Van den Hoogenband drew away to claim gold and equal his world record, stunning the home crowd. Thorpe touched in 1&#160;min 46.83&#160;s, the first time that he had swum slower in the final than in the qualifying rounds.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> Thorpe returned to victory when he led off the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;200&#160;m freestyle relay the following night, setting up a 10&#160;m lead over American <a href="/wiki/Scott_Goldblatt" id="w">Scott Goldblatt</a> in the first leg. Although Thorpe was unable to reclaim the individual world record, he, Klim, Kirby and <a href="/wiki/Todd_Pearson" id="w">Todd Pearson</a> lowered their world record to 7&#160;min 07.05&#160;s, over five seconds ahead of the Americans &#8212; the largest winning margin in an Olympic relay for half a century.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> Thorpe rounded off his Olympics by swimming in the heats of the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;m medley final, and collected a silver medal when the finals quartet finished behind the Americans.<sup id="_ref-abc career_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup> Thorpe&#39;s performances as Australia&#39;s leading medalist for the Games were recognised when the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Olympic_Committee" id="w">Australian Olympic Committee</a> granted him the honour of carrying the flag at the closing ceremony.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> At year&#39;s end, he was again named by Swimming Australia as the Swimmer of the Year, but Van den Hoogenband usurped him as the leading male swimmer chosen by <i>Swimming World Magazine</i>.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>

With the <a href="/wiki/2001_in_sports" id="w">2001</a> Australian Championships held in <a href="/wiki/Hobart" id="w">Hobart</a> in March, Thorpe added the 800&#160;m freestyle to his repertoire, after <a href="/wiki/International_Swimming_Federation" id="w">FINA</a> had added the event for the <a href="/wiki/2001_World_Aquatics_Championships" id="w">2001 World Aquatics Championships</a>. Thorpe began his campaign by successfully defending his 400&#160;m title with a time just 0.17&#160;s outside his world record.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> The following night in the 800&#160;m event, he drew away from Hackett in the last 100&#160;m to break <a href="/wiki/Kieren_Perkins" id="w">Kieren Perkins</a>&#39; 1994 world record by over four seconds.<sup id="_ref-abc career_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> He earned his third title by cutting 0.66&#160;s from Van den Hoogenband&#39;s 200&#160;m world record to set a new mark of 1&#160;min 44.69&#160;s.<sup id="_ref-abc career_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> This performance made him the third male after <a href="/wiki/John_Konrads" id="w">John Konrads</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tim_Shaw_(swimmer)" id="w">Tim Shaw</a> to hold world records over three distances simultaneously. His subsequent victory in the 100&#160;m freestyle in a new personal best of 49.05&#160;s made him the first since Konrads in <a href="/wiki/1959_in_sports" id="w">1959</a> to hold all Australian freestyle titles from 100&#160;m to 800&#160;m. This indicated that he could swim faster at the subsequent World Championships in <a href="/wiki/Fukuoka%2C_Fukuoka" id="w">Fukuoka</a>, where he was looking to regain the ascendancy from Van den Hoogenband.<sup id="_ref-abc career_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-gsiprofile_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gsiprofile" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thorpe arrived in Fukuoka having been chosen by broadcaster <a href="/wiki/TV_Asahi" id="w">TV Asahi</a> as the marketing drawcard of the event. With the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;m freestyle relay being held after the 400&#160;m freestyle on the first night, Thorpe appeared to be conserving energy when he reached the 200&#160;m mark two seconds outside his world record. Although he was 0.93&#160;s behind at the final turn, a final 50&#160;m burst in 24.36&#160;s saw him cut a further 0.42&#160;s from his world record. The relay saw him  dive in fractionally ahead of American <a href="/wiki/Jason_Lezak" id="w">Jason Lezak</a> after Klim, Callus and Pearson had completed the first three legs. Thorpe fell behind in the early half of the leg before kicking away in the closing stages, to seal gold with his fastest-ever relay split of 47.87&#160;s.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> In the 800&#160;m final, he shadowed Hackett for the first 750&#160;m, staying within a body length. He then broke clear to win by a body length, lowering his world record by over two seconds.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> The 200&#160;m freestyle rematch with Van den Hoogenband provided Thorpe with a chance to rectify his strategy from the Olympics; this time he allowed the Dutchman to lead through the first 100&#160;m. Thorpe pulled even at the 150&#160;m mark and then broke away towards the finishing wall two body lengths clear. He lowered his world record to 1&#160;min 44.06&#160;s in the process, prompting Van den Hoogenband to raise his arm aloft.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> Thorpe&#39;s winning streak was interrupted in the 100&#160;m freestyle when his personal best of 48.81&#160;s placed him fourth, but he returned to form in the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;200&#160;m freestyle relay. Anchoring the team of Klim, Hackett and Kirby, the Australians lowered their world record time by more than two seconds, leaving the Italians  more than six seconds in arrears.<sup id="_ref-gsiprofile_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gsiprofile" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> Having overtaken Klim as Australia&#39;s leading 100&#160;m freestyle swimmer, Thorpe was entrusted with anchoring the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;m medley relay team. After <a href="/wiki/Matt_Welsh" id="w">Matt Welsh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Regan_Harrison" id="w">Regan Harrison</a> and <a href="/wiki/Geoff_Huegill" id="w">Geoff Huegill</a> had finished their legs, Thorpe&#39;s change left him half a body length behind the new 100&#160;m world champion <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Ervin" id="w">Anthony Ervin</a> of the United States. The Americans were expected to win, and with his typically slow start, Thorpe turned a body length behind with 50&#160;m remaining. With an American victory seeming inevitable, Thorpe managed to accelerate and deprive Ervin of the lead in the last 5&#160;m.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> This made Thorpe the only swimmer to have won six gold medals at a World Championships,<sup id="_ref-abc career_r" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ABC profile_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ABC profile" title="">[20]</a></sup> and formed the basis for Australia&#39;s gold medal win over the United States 13-9.

After his record six gold medals in Fukuoka, the meet was surrounded by further expectations of world records and speculation that he would match <a href="/wiki/Mark_Spitz" id="w">Spitz</a>&#39;s seven gold medals. His winning time in the 400&#160;m was the second fastest in history, but such was the expectation on him that his failure to break a world record was the talking point. He claimed the 100&#160;m and 200&#160;m events in times outside his best, making it the first time that he had failed to break a world record at a major meet since 1999.<sup id="_ref-swiminfo 2002_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-swiminfo 2002" title="">[78]</a></sup> He also experimented by adding the 100&#160;m backstroke to his repertoire, placing second.

By this time, Thorpe&#39;s relationship with Frost was beginning to unravel. Thorpe had always insisted that his swimming was about enjoyment and improving himself in setting faster times, rather than victory or defeat. This contrasted with Frost, who had a more aggressive and combative mindset, often making bold public statements. Thorpe ignored Frost&#39;s advice and bulked up his upper body by a further 5&#160;kg to 105&#160;kg, making him the heaviest elite swimmer in history. His reasoning that the strength gains would outweigh any loss in flexibility raised concerns over his physiological strategy.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> On the first night in Manchester, Thorpe again lowered his 400&#160;m mark by 0.09&#160;s to 3&#160;min 40.08&#160;s,<sup id="_ref-abc career_s" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-swiminfo 2002_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-swiminfo 2002" title="">[78]</a></sup> before anchoring the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;m freestyle relay team to another gold.<sup id="_ref-bbc cg2002_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc cg2002" title="">[81]</a></sup> Prior to the 200&#160;m final, Thorpe was seen arguing with Frost in the warm-up area. Thorpe won, but was unusually angry at having failed to lower his previous best, publicly stating that he &#34;wasn&#39;t with it&#34; and that he had &#34;one of the worst warm-ups ever&#34;.<sup id="_ref-bbc cg2002_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc cg2002" title="">[81]</a></sup> Thorpe did manage to lower his personal best in the 100&#160;m freestyle to 48.73&#160;s en route to his fourth gold, and anchored the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;200&#160;m freestyle and 4&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;m medley relays to comfortable victories.<sup id="_ref-bbc cg2002_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc cg2002" title="">[81]</a></sup> When he collected a silver in his first international race in the 100&#160;m backstroke with another personal best, he was forced to rebuff media comparisons to Spitz. He emphasized personal performance, stating &#34;I think it&#39;s a limiting attitude to be competing against other people when you can be challenging yourself.&#34; Despite Thorpe&#39;s assertion that he could not match Spitz, Frost predicted that Thorpe could win nine golds at one Olympics.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup> In spite of the media disappointment, Thorpe&#39;s six gold medals equaled the record set by <a href="/wiki/Susie_O%26%2339%3BNeill" id="w">Susie O&#39;Neill</a>, completing all in Games or World record time.<sup id="_ref-abc career_t" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abc career" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-bbc cg2002_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc cg2002" title="">[81]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-swiminfo 2002_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-swiminfo 2002" title="">[78]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ABC profile_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ABC profile" title="">[20]</a></sup>

The Pan Pacific Championships followed in <a href="/wiki/Yokohama" id="w">Yokohama</a> less than a month later, with media speculation about Thorpe and Frost overshadowing the racing. Thorpe began his campaign with a victory over Hackett in the 400&#160;m freestyle in a time five seconds outside his world record. Afterwards, he revealed that both swimmers had deliberately conserved energy for the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;m freestyle relay later in the night.

<p>After the 2002 Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe announced that he was splitting with Frost to train with one of his assistants, <a href="/wiki/Tracey_Menzies" id="w">Tracey Menzies</a>, who had no international experience. Admitting that tension existed between him and Frost, Thorpe asserted that the split was amicable. He cited waning motivation for the split, stating &#34;I decided I either had to make the change or it was to walk away from the sport&#34;.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup> The retired Talbot expressed concerns that Thorpe was making a decision whilst he was physically and emotionally drained, while other coaches felt that the new relationship would end up with making Thorpe, rather than Menzies, making the decisions.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ABC profile_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ABC profile" title="">[20]</a></sup> Despite a turbulent year, he was again named by <i>Swimming World</i> as its World Swimmer of the Year.<sup id="_ref-swiminfo 2002_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-swiminfo 2002" title="">[78]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Along with the switch of coaches, Thorpe indicated that he would put more focus on improving his sprinting ability. He thus dropped the 800&#160;m freestyle despite being the reigning world champion and record holder. During this period, his times in the 400&#160;m and 200&#160;m freestyle deteriorated, and both he and Menzies were criticised. The criticism continued to mount during their partnership, particular during the build-up to the 2004 Olympics. Following his victory in the 200 and 400 events in Athens, Thorpe said that his results justified his decision, despite posting substantially faster times as a young swimmer under Frost.<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>

The first major test of Thorpe&#39;s partnership with Menzies came at the Australian Championships held in Sydney in March. Thorpe did not threaten any of his world records, completing the 400&#160;m and 200&#160;m freestyle more than two and one seconds respectively off his best. Despite defeating Hackett in both races to retain his titles,<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup> he later admitted that he was &#34;pretty disappointed&#34; with his performances.

Thorpe found some relief by setting a new Commonwealth record of 2&#160;min 00.11&#160;s in his first long course 200&#160;m individual medley outing, the fifth fastest time in the past year.<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup> Thorpe attracted further criticism when he withdrew from the inaugural <a href="/wiki/Mutual_of_Omaha_Duel_in_the_Pool" id="w">Duel in the Pool</a> with a medical complaint, despite travelling overseas for commercial and charity work.<sup id="_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[96]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[97]</a></sup></p>

Thorpe managed to respond and retain his world title,<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup> and gained some relief after his sprint training yielded his first medal in the 100&#160;m freestyle at a global competition; he finished third in 48.77&#160;s.<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup> In all three freestyle events however, he had swum slower than his times under Frost.

After his feats at the 2003 World Championships, <a href="/wiki/Speedo" id="w">Speedo</a> had generated significant media publicity by offering Michael Phelps <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$1</a> million if he could match Spitz&#39;s seven golds.

</p>
<p>The pressure in the lead-up was further compounded by the media attention surrounding Phelps, who had decided that the 200&#160;m freestyle would be one of the events in his quest for eight gold medals. This prompted many media outlets to label the race between Thorpe, Van den Hoogenband, Phelps and Hackett as <i>The Race of the Century</i>. With the press spotlight growing, Thorpe tried to avoid media attention, resulting in a few terse media events.<sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[109]</a></sup> Thorpe&#39;s increasing focus on the 100&#160;m event, coupled with the media pressure, resulted in speculation that he was vulnerable to Hackett in the 400&#160;m event. Thorpe made a slow start in the final, reaching the 100&#160;m mark one second outside world record pace. In a topsy-turvy performance at irregular pace, there were multiple changes of lead before Thorpe established a body-length lead by 350&#160;m. He was closed down by Hackett, holding on by only 0.26&#160; in a time three seconds outside his own world record. Thorpe appeared to shed tears in an uncharacteristic sign of emotion, admitting that the controversy surrounding the event had taken a toll on him, but denying that any liquid had left his eyes.<sup id="_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#_note-110" title="">[110]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#_note-111" title="">[111]</a></sup></p>
<p>With Klim recently returning from a two-year injury layoff, and Callus ill, Thorpe could only anchor Australia to sixth in the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;m freestyle relay.<sup id="_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#_note-112" title="">[112]</a></sup> The 200&#160;m began with Van den Hoogenband again attacking immediately, reaching the 100&#160;m mark more than a second under the world record split, with Thorpe half a body length behind. Thorpe gradually reduced the lead before passing Van den Hoogenband in the last 50&#160;m to win <i>The Race of the Century</i> by half a body length, in a new Olympic record of 1&#160;min 44.71&#160;s.<sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[113]</a></sup> Having achieved what had eluded him four years earlier, Thorpe reacted emotionally, immediately tearing off his cap, punching the air and screaming.<sup id="_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#_note-114" title="">[114]</a></sup> The next day saw six years of Australian victory in the 4&#160;&#215;&#160;200&#160;m freestyle relay ended when Hackett, Klim and Sprenger had put Thorpe into the final leg 1.48&#160;s behind Keller.

<p>Thorpe&#39;s success has been attributed to a work ethic, mental strength, powerful kick, ability to accelerate and having a physiology suited to swimming.

He was present at the <a href="/wiki/World_Trade_Center" id="w">World Trade Center</a> the morning of <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001" id="w">September 11, 2001</a>, having stopped there on his morning jog before returning to his hotel.<sup id="_ref-dyk_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dyk" title="">[9]</a></sup> It was during this September trip that he was invited to be interviewed on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno" id="w">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a></i>, which was notable due to the relative lack of interest in competitive swimming in America compared to other major sports.<sup id="_ref-148" class="reference"><a href="#_note-148" title="">[148]</a></sup> He later became a spokesperson for the unsuccessful <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_2012_Olympic_bid" id="w">New York city bid</a> for the <a href="/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics" id="w">2012 Summer Olympics</a>, even promising to defer his retirement to compete in 2012, if New York were to be successful.<sup id="_ref-149" class="reference"><a href="#_note-149" title="">[149]</a></sup> Thorpe&#39;s interests have also seen him involved in television, starring in a reality television show in <a href="/wiki/2002_in_television" id="w">2002</a> called <i><a href="/wiki/Undercover_Angels" id="w">Undercover Angels</a></i>, which imitated the <i><a href="/wiki/Charlie%26%2339%3Bs_Angels" id="w">Charlie&#39;s Angels</a></i> series. The show involved Thorpe directing three young women who performed good deeds for people in need. Although it attracted more than a million viewers, it was widely panned by critics.<sup id="_ref-magnetic_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-magnetic" title="">[144]</a></sup> He has also appeared as an extra in the American sitcom <i><a href="/wiki/Friends" id="w">Friends</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-dyk_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dyk" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#_note-151" title="">[151]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thorpe is widely popular in <a href="/wiki/Asia" id="w">Asia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> in particular. He was identified in 2000 by <a href="/wiki/TV_Asahi" id="w">TV Asahi</a> as the swimmer likely to be the most successful at the forthcoming 2001 Fukuoka World Championships, and was selected to be its marketing figurehead. He visited Japan before the Championships to promote Asahi in a series of television events,<sup id="_ref-gsiprofile_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gsiprofile" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#_note-152" title="">[152]</a></sup> and upon his return for the competition itself, he was mobbed at the airport by youthful crowds 25&#160;m deep, with hundreds camping outside the Australian team hotel. He was also praised by older sections of Japanese society as a role model for youth, due to what they interpreted as his humility and work ethic.<sup id="_ref-magnetic_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-magnetic" title="">[144]</a></sup> In 2002, in the wake of the tourism slump after the September 11 terrorist attacks, he agreed to be a tourism ambassador for the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Tourism_Commission" id="w">Australian Tourism Commission</a> in Japan. The high-profile campaigning included a meeting with then <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan" id="w">Japanese Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Junichiro_Koizumi" id="w">Junichiro Koizumi</a>, resulting in an upturn in Japanese tourism to Australia which was credited to Thorpe.<sup id="_ref-154" class="reference"><a href="#_note-154" title="">[154]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-155" class="reference"><a href="#_note-155" title="">[155]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-156" class="reference"><a href="#_note-156" title="">[156]</a></sup> In 2005 the <a href="/wiki/Yakult" id="w">Yakult</a> company in Japan released a &#39;Thorpedo&#39; energy drink, featuring a picture of Thorpe on the bottle.<sup id="_ref-157" class="reference"><a href="#_note-157" title="">[157]</a></sup> This was part of an equity deal with the <a href="/wiki/So_Natural" id="w">So Natural</a> food group in which Thorpe was offered a 5% stake in the company, initially worth A$1.1m, in return for the use of his name and image on their products. The 15-year deal covers markets across East and Southeast Asia and could expand Thorpe&#39;s share in the venture to 50% depending on its commercial success.<sup id="_ref-158" class="reference"><a href="#_note-158" title="">[158]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-159" class="reference"><a href="#_note-159" title="">[159]</a></sup></p>
<p>More recently, Thorpe has also emerged as a <a href="/wiki/Philanthropy" id="w">philanthropist</a>, founding the Ian Thorpe&#39;s Fountain for youth in 2000.<sup id="_ref-160" class="reference"><a href="#_note-160" title="">[160]</a></sup> The organization raises funds for research on childhood illnesses and also sponsors a school in <a href="/wiki/Beijing" id="w">Beijing</a> for orphaned children with disabilities. In addition, it works with <a href="/wiki/The_Fred_Hollows_Foundation" id="w">The Fred Hollows Foundation</a> to improve health standards and living conditions in <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" id="w">Australian aboriginal</a> communities.<sup id="_ref-gsiprofile_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gsiprofile" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-161" class="reference"><a href="#_note-161" title="">[161]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-162" class="reference"><a href="#_note-162" title="">[162]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/July_7" id="w">July 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007_in_music" id="w">2007</a>, Thorpe was one of the presenters at the <a href="/wiki/Live_Earth_concert%2C_Sydney" id="w">Australian leg</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Live_Earth" id="w">Live Earth</a> concert.</p>
