Amazing Grace is a fictional extraterrestial supervillain published by DC Comics. She first appeared in ''Superman'' vol. 2 #3 (March 1987), and was created by John Byrne.

Fictional character biography
Amazing Grace lives among the lowlies of Apokolips. A loyal agent of Darkseid, she pretends to preach opposition to Darkseid's word and encourages them to revolt. When they do, they are easily defeated, crushing their revolt and their spirits. 

When Superman infiltrated Apokolips, trying to prove Darkseid was behind G. Gordon Godfrey's reign of terror on Earth, Grace was &quot;captured&quot; by Darkseid's troops and was to be thrown into the firepits; all to lure Superman out. He saved her, but he himself fell into the firepits. He survived, but with no memory or powers. It was implied that Grace seduced Superman on behalf of Darkseid, and convinced the Man of Steel that he was Darkseid's son. Superman was given his powers back when he allied himself with Darkseid and led Darkseid's forces into battle. Serving Darkseid, Superman went into battle against Darkseid's true son, Orion, who used the powers of the Motherbox to restore Superman's memories while erasing his knowledge of, and guilt over,the thousands that had died because of his actions under Grace's influence. Grace still serves Darkseid among the denizens of Apokolips today.

Powers and abilities
Like her brother Glorious Godfrey, Grace is a master of mind manipulation, who uses those powers to subtly influence others.
