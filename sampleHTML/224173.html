<p>{{Audio}} (born Emanuel Swedberg; <a href="/wiki/February_8" id="w">February 8</a>,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/1688" id="w">1688</a>–<a href="/wiki/March_29" id="w">March 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/1772" id="w">1772</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Swedish</a> <a href="/wiki/Scientist" id="w">scientist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philosopher" id="w">philosopher</a>, <a href="/wiki/Christian_mystic" id="w">Christian mystic</a>,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  and <a href="/wiki/Theologian" id="w">theologian</a>. Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. At the age of fifty-six he entered into a spiritual phase, in which he experienced dreams and visions. This culminated in a spiritual awakening, where he claimed he was appointed by the Lord to write a heavenly doctrine to reform Christianity. He claimed that the Lord had opened his eyes, so that from then on he could freely visit <a href="/wiki/Heaven" id="w">heaven</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hell" id="w">hell</a>, and talk with <a href="/wiki/Angel" id="w">angels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Demon" id="w">demons</a>, and other <a href="/wiki/Spirit" id="w">spirits</a>. For the remaining 28 years of his life, he wrote and published 18 theological works, of which the best known was <i><a href="/wiki/Heaven_and_Hell_(Swedenborg)" id="w">Heaven and Hell</a></i> (1758)  <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>, and several unpublished theological works.</p>
<p>Swedenborg explicitly rejected the common explanation of the <a href="/wiki/Trinity" id="w">Trinity</a> as a Trinity of Persons, which he said was not taught in the early Christian Church. Instead he explained in his theological writings how the Divine Trinity exists in One Person, in One God, the Lord Jesus Christ. Swedenborg also rejected the Protestant doctrine of salvation through <a href="/wiki/Faith_alone" id="w">faith alone</a>, since he considered both faith and charity necessary for salvation, not one without the other. The purpose of faith, according to Swedenborg, is to lead a person to a life according to the truths of faith, which is charity. </p>
<p>Swedenborg&#39;s theological writings have elicited a range of responses. Toward the end of Swedenborg&#39;s life, small reading groups formed in England and Sweden to study the truth they saw in his teachings and several writers were influenced by him, including <a href="/wiki/William_Blake" id="w">William Blake</a>, <a href="/wiki/August_Strindberg" id="w">August Strindberg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson" id="w">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Baudelaire" id="w">Charles Baudelaire</a>, <a href="/wiki/Balzac" id="w">Balzac</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Butler_Yeats" id="w">William Butler Yeats</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carl_Jung" id="w">Carl Jung</a>. The theologian <a href="/wiki/Henry_James_Sr." id="w">Henry James Sr.</a> was also a follower of his teachings, as were <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Appleseed" id="w">Johnny Appleseed</a> and <a href="/wiki/Helen_Keller" id="w">Helen Keller</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast, one of the most prominent Swedish authors of Swedenborg&#39;s day, <a href="/wiki/Johan_Henrik_Kellgren" id="w">Johan Henrik Kellgren</a>, called Swedenborg &#34;nothing but a fool&#34;, a view shared by the establishment.<sup id="_ref-Kellgren_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kellgren" title="">[5]</a></sup> A <a href="/wiki/Heresy" id="w">heresy</a> trial was initiated in Sweden in 1768 against Swedenborg&#39;s writings and two men who promoted these ideas. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 235 years since Swedenborg&#39;s death, various interpretations of Swedenborg&#39;s theology have been made (see: <a href="/wiki/Swedenborgian_Church" id="w">Swedenborgian Church</a>), and he has also been scrutinized in biographies and psychological studies.<sup id="_ref-Veracity_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Veracity" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

Swedenborg&#39;s father <a href="/wiki/Jesper_Swedberg" id="w">Jesper Swedberg</a> (1653–1735) descended from a wealthy mining family. He travelled abroad and studied theology, and on returning home he was eloquent enough to impress the Swedish King <a href="/wiki/Charles_XI_of_Sweden" id="w">Charles XI</a> with his sermons in Stockholm. Through the King&#39;s influence he would later become professor of theology at <a href="/wiki/Uppsala_University" id="w">Uppsala University</a> and Bishop of <a href="/wiki/Skara" id="w">Skara</a>.<sup id="_ref-Ugglan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ugglan" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-enc1911_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-enc1911" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jesper took an interest in the beliefs of the dissenting Lutheran <a href="/wiki/Pietism" id="w">Pietist</a> movement, which emphasised the virtues of communion with <a href="/wiki/God" id="w">God</a> rather than relying on sheer faith (<i><a href="/wiki/Sola_fide" id="w">sola fide</a></i>).<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Sola fide is a tenet of the <a href="/wiki/Lutheran_Church" id="w">Lutheran Church</a>, and Jesper was charged with being a pietist <a href="/wiki/Heresy" id="w">heretic</a>. While controversial, the beliefs were to have a major impact on his son Emanuel&#39;s spirituality. Jesper furthermore held the unconventional belief that <a href="/wiki/Angels" id="w">angels</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spirit" id="w">spirits</a> were present in everyday life. This also came to have a strong impact on Emanuel. <sup id="_ref-Ugglan_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ugglan" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-enc1911_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-enc1911" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Emanuel completed his university course at <a href="/wiki/Uppsala" id="w">Uppsala</a>, and in <a href="/wiki/1710" id="w">1710</a> made his <a href="/wiki/Grand_tour" id="w">Grand tour</a> through the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, before reaching <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, where he would spend the next four years. Some believe that he was influenced by the Croatian theologian Milan Nejedic; unfortunately, since most of Nejedic&#39;s writings were burned by the Austrians, this theory cannot be verified. At this time London was the largest city in the world, and the most liberal place in Europe for philosophical discussion and <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_speech" id="w">freedom of speech</a>.{{Fact}} It was also a flourishing center of scientific ideas and discoveries.  Emanuel studied <a href="/wiki/Physics" id="w">physics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mechanics" id="w">mechanics</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" id="w">philosophy</a>, read and wrote poetry. He wrote to his benefactor and brother-in-law <a href="/wiki/Erik_Benzelius_the_Younger" id="w">Eric Benzelius</a> that he believed he might be destined to be a great scientist. In one of his letters he includes, somewhat boastfully, a list of inventions he claims to have made, including a submarine and a flying machine.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Delblanc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Delblanc" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

In 1715 Swedenborg returned to Sweden, where he was to devote himself to natural science and engineering projects for the next two decades. A first step was his noted meeting with King <a href="/wiki/Charles_XII_of_Sweden" id="w">Charles XII of Sweden</a> in the city of <a href="/wiki/Lund" id="w">Lund</a>, in 1716.  The Swedish inventor <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Polhem" id="w">Christopher Polhem</a>, who became a close friend of Swedenborg&#39;s, was also present. Swedenborg&#39;s purpose was to persuade the king to fund an <a href="/wiki/Observatory" id="w">observatory</a> in northern Sweden. However, the warlike king did not consider this project important enough, but did appoint Swedenborg assessor-extraordinary on the Swedish board of mines (<i>Bergskollegium</i>) in <a href="/wiki/Stockholm" id="w">Stockholm</a>. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>From 1716 to 1718 Swedenborg published a scientific periodical entitled <i>Daedalus Hyperboreus</i> (<i>&#34;The Nordic <a href="/wiki/Daedalus" id="w">Daedalus</a>&#34;</i>) which was a record of mechanical and mathematical inventions and discoveries. One notable description was that of a flying machine, the same he had been sketching on a few years earlier (see <a href="/wiki/Flying_Machine_(Swedenborg)" id="w">Flying Machine (Swedenborg)</a>).<sup id="_ref-Delblanc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Delblanc" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Upon the death of Charles XII, <a href="/wiki/Ulrike_Eleonora_of_Sweden" id="w">Queen Ulrika Eleonora</a> ennobled Swedenborg and his siblings. It was common in Sweden during the 17th and 18th centuries for the children of bishops to receive this honour as a recognition of the services of the father. The family name was changed from Swedberg to Swedenborg. <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1724" id="w">1724</a> he was offered the chair of <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" id="w">mathematics</a> at <a href="/wiki/Uppsala_University" id="w">Uppsala University</a>, but he declined, saying that he had mainly dealt with geometry, chemistry and metallurgy during his career. He also noted that he did not have the gift of eloquent speech because of a speech impediment. The speech impediment in question was <a href="/wiki/Stuttering" id="w">stuttering</a>, noted by many acquaintances of his, and it forced him to speak slowly and carefully, and there are no known occurrences of him speaking in public.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> It has been proposed that he compensated for his poor speech by extensive argumentation in writing.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<a id="New_direction_of_studies" name="New_direction_of_studies"></a><h2>New direction of studies</h2>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/1730s" id="w">1730s</a> Swedenborg became increasingly interested in spiritual matters and was determined to find a theory which would explain how <a href="/wiki/Matter" id="w">matter</a> relates to <a href="/wiki/Spirit" id="w">spirit</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Leipzig" id="w">Leipzig</a>, 1735, he published a three volume work entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Opera_philosophica_et_mineralis" id="w">Opera philosophica et mineralis</a></i> (<i>&#34;Philosophical and mineralogical works</i>&#34;), where he tries to conjoin philosophy and <a href="/wiki/Metallurgy" id="w">metallurgy</a>. The work was mainly appreciated for its chapters on the analysis of the smelting of iron and copper, and it was this work which gave Swedenborg international reputation. <sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The same year he also published the small manuscript <i>de Infinito</i> (<i>&#34;On the Infinite</i>&#34;), where he attempted to explain how the finite is related to the infinite, and how the soul is connected to the body. This was the first manuscript where he touched upon these matters. He knew that it might clash with established theologies, since he presents the view that the soul is based on material substances. <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the 1730s Swedenborg undertook many studies of anatomy and physiology. He also conducted dedicated studies of the fashionable philosophers of the time <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" id="w">John Locke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Christian_von_Wolff" id="w">Christian von Wolff</a> and <a href="/wiki/Leibniz" id="w">Leibniz</a>, as well as returning to earlier thinkers <a href="/wiki/Plato" id="w">Plato</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" id="w">Aristotle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plotinus" id="w">Plotinus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo" id="w">Augustine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Descartes" id="w">Descartes</a> and others. <sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1743" id="w">1743</a>, at the age of 55, Swedenborg requested a leave of absence to go abroad. His purpose was to gather source material for <i><a href="/wiki/Regnum_animale" id="w">Regnum animale</a></i> (<i>The Animal Kingdom</i>, or <i>Kingdom of Life</i>), a subject on which books were not readily available in Sweden. The aim of the book was to explain the soul from an anatomical point of view. He had planned to produce a total of seventeen volumes. <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Crisis" name="Crisis"></a><h2>Crisis</h2>
<p>By <a href="/wiki/1744" id="w">1744</a> he had traveled to the Netherlands. Around this time he began having strange dreams. Swedenborg carried a travel journal with him on most of his travels, and did so on this journey. The whereabouts of the diary were long unknown, but it was discovered in the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Library_of_Sweden" id="w">Royal Library</a> in the 1850s and published in 1859 as <i>Drömboken</i>, or <i><a href="/wiki/Journal_of_Dreams" id="w">Journal of Dreams</a></i>. It provides a first-hand account of the events of the crisis. <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>He experienced many different dreams and visions, some greatly pleasurable, others highly disturbing. <sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>The experiences continued as he travelled to London to continue the publication of <i>Regnum animale</i>. This cathartic process continued for six months. It has been compared to the Catholic concept of <i><a href="/wiki/Purgatory" id="w">Purgatory</a></i>. <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Analyses of the diary have concluded that what Swedenborg was recording in his Journal of Dreams was a battle between the love of his self, and the love of God. <sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Visions_and_spiritual_insights" name="Visions_and_spiritual_insights"></a><h2>Visions and spiritual insights</h2>
<p>In the last entry of the journal from October 26-27 1744, Swedenborg appears to be clear as to which path to follow. He felt he should drop his current project, and write a new book about the worship of God. He soon began working on <i>De cultu et amore Dei</i>, or <i>The Worship and Love of God</i>. It was never fully completed, but Swedenborg still had it published in London in June 1745. <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>One explanation why the work was never finished is given in a well known and often referenced story. In April 1745, Swedenborg was dining in a private room at a tavern in London. By the end of the meal, a darkness fell upon his eyes, and the room shifted character. Suddenly he saw a person sitting at a corner of the room, telling Swedenborg: &#34;<i>Do not eat too much!</i>&#34;. Swedenborg, scared, hurried home. Later that night, the same man appeared in his dreams. The man told Swedenborg that He was the Lord, that He had appointed Swedenborg to reveal the spiritual meaning of the Bible, and that He would guide Swedenborg in what to write. The same night, the spiritual world was opened to Swedenborg.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption"><i>Arcana Cœlestia</i>, first edition (1749), title page</div>
In June 1747, Swedenborg resigned his post as assessor of the board of mines. He explained that he was obliged to complete a work he had begun, and requested to receive half his salary as a <a href="/wiki/Pension" id="w">pension</a>. <sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> He took up afresh his study of <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language" id="w">Hebrew</a> and began to work on the spiritual interpretation of the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a> with the goal of interpreting the spiritual meaning of every verse. From sometime between 1746 and 1747, and for ten years henceforth, he devoted his energy to this task. This work, usually abbreviated as <i>Arcana Cœlestia</i> (<i>&#34;Heavenly Secrets</i>&#34;), was to become his magnum opus, and the basis of his further theological works. <sup id="_ref-AC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AC" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>The work was anonymous and Swedenborg was not identified as the author until the late 1750s. It consisted of twelve volumes, published between 1749 and 1756. It attracted little attention, as few people could penetrate its meaning. <sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>His life from 1747 until his death in 1772 was spent in Stockholm, Holland, and London. During these twenty five years he wrote another fourteen works of a spiritual nature of which most were published during his lifetime. <i>The Last Judgment in Retrospect: From De Ultimo Judicio Et De Babylonia Destructa </i> Swedenborg&#39;s lesser known works, presents a startling claim, that The Last Judgement began last year (1757) and was completed by the end of that year.&#34;  This judgment was supposed to have occurred in the &#34;spiritual heavens&#34; when God saw that the church had lost its true identity, which is compassion and charity. Swedenborg&#39;s writings on the Last Judgment stress God&#39;s love and mercy and rejects the fearful prophecies of fiery destruction and eternal damnation.  Freedom of the press was not allowed for religious works at the time, which is why they were all printed in either London or Holland. <sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Throughout this period he was befriended by many people who regarded him as a kind and warm-hearted man. When in the company of others, he was jovial, and conversed about whatever subject was discussed. Those who talked with him understood that he was devoted to his beliefs. He never argued matters of religion, except when ridiculed, when he replied sharply, so that the ridicule would not be repeated. <sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

In July, 1770, at the age of 82, he traveled to Amsterdam to complete the publication of his last work. The book, <i>Vera Christiana Religio</i> (<i>The True Christian Religion</i>), was published in Amsterdam in 1771 and was one of the most appreciated of his works. Designed to explain his teachings to Lutheran Christians, it was the most concrete of his works.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the summer of 1771, he travelled to London. Shortly before Christmas he suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed and confined to bed. His health improved somewhat, but he died on March 29, 1772. There are several accounts of his last months, made by those he stayed with, and by a pastor of the Swedish Church in London who visited him several times. <sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>He was buried in the Swedish church in <a href="/wiki/Shadwell" id="w">Shadwell</a>, London. On the 140th anniversary of his death, in 1912/1913, his earthly remains were transferred to <a href="/wiki/Uppsala_Cathedral" id="w">Uppsala Cathedral</a> in Sweden, where they now rest in close proximity to the grave of the botanist <a href="/wiki/Carolus_Linnaeus" id="w">Carolus Linnaeus</a>. In 1917, the Swedish church was demolished and the Swedish community that had grown around the parish moved to West London. In 1938 the site of the former church where he was buried in London was redeveloped, and in his honour the local road was renamed Swedenborg Gardens. In 1997 a garden, play area and memorial near to the road was created in his memory.</p>

<p>Swedenborg&#39;s transition from scientist to <a href="/wiki/Mysticism" id="w">mystic</a> has fascinated many people ever since it occurred, including such people as <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" id="w">Immanuel Kant</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Blake" id="w">William Blake</a>, <a href="/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe" id="w">Goethe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle" id="w">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac" id="w">Balzac</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges" id="w">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, <a href="/wiki/August_Strindberg" id="w">August Strindberg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson" id="w">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carl_Jung" id="w">Carl Jung</a>.</p>
<p>Some assert that Swedenborg lost his mind, suffering some sort of <a href="/wiki/Mental_illness" id="w">mental illness</a> or <a href="/wiki/Nervous_breakdown" id="w">nervous breakdown</a>.<sup id="_ref-Veracity_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Veracity" title="">[7]</a></sup> While this idea was not uncommon during Swedenborg&#39;s own time, it is mitigated by his activity in the Swedish <a href="/wiki/Swedish_House_of_Nobility" id="w">Riddarhuset</a> (The House of the Nobility), the <a href="/wiki/Riksdag" id="w">Riksdag</a> (the Swedish parliament), and the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences" id="w">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a>.  In fact, close analysis of the historical facts of his life, would appear to establish clearly his sanity.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> Additionally, the system of thought in his theological writings is remarkably coherent.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Some of the biographers of Swedenborg propose that he did not in fact have a revelation at all, but rather developed his theological ideas from sources ranging from his father to earlier figures in the history of thought, notably Plotinus <sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup>This position was first and most notably taken by the Swedish writer Martin Lamm, who wrote a biography of Swedenborg in 1915, which is still in print.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Olof Lagercrantz, a noted Swedish critic and publicist, had a similar point of view, calling Swedenborg&#39;s theological writing <i>&#34;a poem about a foreign country with peculiar laws and customs&#34;</i>.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Swedenborg&#39;s approach to demonstrating the veracity of his theological teachings was to find and use voluminous quotations from the Old Testament and New Testament to demonstrate agreement between the Bible or Word of God and his theological teachings. The demonstration of this agreement is found throughout his theological writings, since he rejected blind faith and declared true faith is an internal acknowledgement of the truth.</p>

<p>Swedenborg proposed many scientific ideas, both before his crisis and after. In his youth, he wanted to present a new idea every day, as he wrote to his brother-in-law <a href="/wiki/Erik_Benzelius" id="w">Erik Benzelius</a> in 1718. Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge is not something that can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After his crisis in 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>From 1745, when he considered himself to have entered a spiritual state, he tended to phrase his &#34;experiences&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Empirical" id="w">empirical</a> terms, claiming to report accurately things he had experienced on his spiritual journeys.</p>
<p>One of his ideas that is considered most crucial for the understanding of his theology is his notion of correspondences. But in fact, he first presented the theory of correspondences in 1744, before his crisis, in the first volume of <i>Regnum Animale</i> dealing with the human soul. <sup id="_ref-Delblanc_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Delblanc" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>The basis of the correspondence theory is that there is a relationship between the natural (&#34;physical&#34;), the spiritual, and the divine worlds. The foundations of this theory can be traced to <a href="/wiki/Neoplatonism" id="w">Neoplatonism</a> and the philosopher <a href="/wiki/Plotinus" id="w">Plotinus</a> in particular. With the aid of this scenario, Swedenborg now interpreted the Bible in a different light, claiming that even the most apparently trivial sentences could hold a profound spiritual meaning. <sup id="_ref-Korr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Korr" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Psychic_accounts" name="Psychic_accounts"></a><h1>Psychic accounts</h1>
<p>There are three well known incidents of psychic ability reported in literature about Swedenborg.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup>The first was from July 29, 1759, when during a dinner in <a href="/wiki/Gothenburg" id="w">Gothenburg</a>, he excitedly told the party at six o&#39; clock that there was a fire in <a href="/wiki/Stockholm" id="w">Stockholm</a> (405 km away), that it consumed his neighbour&#39;s home and was threatening his own. Two hours later, he exclaimed with relief that the fire stopped three doors from his home. Two days later, reports confirmed every statement to the precise hour that Swedenborg first expressed the information. <sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second was in 1758 when Swedenborg visited Queen <a href="/wiki/Louisa_Ulrika_of_Prussia" id="w">Louisa Ulrika</a> of Sweden, who asked him to tell her something about her deceased brother <a href="/wiki/Prince_Augustus_William_of_Prussia" id="w">Augustus William</a>. The next day, Swedenborg whispered something in her ear that turned the Queen pale and she explained that this was something only she and her brother could know about. <sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> The third was a woman who had lost an important document, and came to Swedenborg asking if a recently deceased person could tell him where it was, which he (in some sources) was said to have done the following night.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" id="w">Immanuel Kant</a>, then at the beginning of his career, was impressed by these in 1763, and made inquiries to find out if they were true. He also ordered all eight volumes of the expensive <i>Arcana Cœlestias</i>. In 1766 he published <i>Träume eines Geistersehers</i> (<i>Dreams of a Seer</i>) where he concluded that Swedenborg&#39;s accounts were nothing but illusions. He could however not give a scientific explanation for Swedenborg&#39;s description of the fire in 1759. <sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Theology" name="Theology"></a><h1>Theology</h1>
<p>Swedenborg considered his <a href="/wiki/Theology" id="w">theology</a> a revelation of the true Christian religion that had become obfuscated through centuries of theology. However, he did not refer to his writings as theology since he considered it based on actual experiences, unlike theology.<sup id="_ref-Delblanc_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Delblanc" title="">[13]</a></sup> Neither did he wish to compare it to <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" id="w">philosophy</a>, a science he in 1748 discarded because it <i>&#34;darkens the mind, blinds us, and wholly rejects the faith&#34;</i>.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>The foundation of Swedenborg&#39;s theology was laid down in  <i>Arcana Cœlestia</i>, or <i>Heavenly Secrets</i>, published in eight volumes from 1749 to 1756. In a significant portion of that work, he interprets Biblical passages. Most of all, he was convinced of how the Bible described a human&#39;s transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being. He begins his work by outlining how the <a href="/wiki/Creation_myth" id="w">creation myth</a> was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man&#39;s rebirth in six steps. Everything related to mankind could also be related to <a href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ" id="w">Jesus Christ</a>, and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries. Swedenborg examined this idea by an exposition on <a href="/wiki/Genesis" id="w">Genesis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Exodus" id="w">Exodus</a>.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Marriage" name="Marriage"></a><h2> Marriage </h2>
<p>One aspect of Swedenborg&#39;s writing that is often discussed is his ideas of marriage. Swedenborg himself stayed a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor" id="w">bachelor</a> all his life, but that did not hinder him from writing voluminously about the subject. His work <i>Conjugial Love</i> (1768) was dedicated to this purpose. A righteous marriage, he argues, is intended to be a continuous spiritual refinement of both parties, and such a union would be maintained in the afterlife.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>He regarded marriage as being fundamentally about the union of wisdom &#8212; physically represented in the man &#8212; and love &#8212; physically represented in the female. This dualism can be traced throughout Swedenborg&#39;s writings. Faith, he writes, is a union of the two qualities of reason (represented by the man) and intention (represented by the female). And, similarly, the wisdom of God has its corresponding part in the love from the Church. <sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Trinity" name="Trinity"></a><h2> Trinity </h2>
<p>Swedenborg was sharply opposed to the Christian doctrine of the <a href="/wiki/Trinity" id="w">Trinity</a> as three Persons, the concept of One God being three separate Persons: the Person of the Father, the Person of the Son, and the Person of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>Instead he claimed that the three were different aspects of the one God, one Person, in whom is the Divine Trinity, and that divinity is impossible if divided into three Persons. Swedenborg spoke sharply against the Trinity of Persons in virtually all his works, and taught that the Divine Trinity exists in One Person, the Lord Jesus Christ, as a trinity of the soul, body, and spirit exists in each person. <sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>   The Divine Trinity in the Lord Jesus Christ is the Divine called the Father as the Soul, the Divine Human called the Son as the Body, and the proceeding Divine called the Holy Spirit as the Spirit. The Divinity or Divine essence of the three is one, as the Person is one. According to Swedenborg, <a href="/wiki/Muslims" id="w">Muslims</a>, Jews and people of other religions are mainly opposed to Christianity because its doctrine of the Trinity of Persons makes One God into three Gods. He considered the separation of the Trinity into three separate Persons to have originated with the <a href="/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea" id="w">First Council of Nicaea</a> in <a href="/wiki/325" id="w">325</a> <a href="/wiki/Common_Era" id="w">CE</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Athanasian_Creed" id="w">Athanasian Creed</a>,  circa 500. <sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> For example:</p>
<p>{{quotation}}</p>
<p>Swedenborg&#39;s theological teachings about the Trinity being in the One Person Jesus Christ is labeled by some as <a href="/wiki/Modalism" id="w">modalism</a> because it identifies three aspects (not persons) of One God, a unitarian God.</p>
<a id="Sola_fide_(Faith_Alone)" name="Sola_fide_(Faith_Alone)"></a><h2> Sola fide (Faith Alone)</h2>
<p>He also spoke sharply against the tenet called <i><a href="/wiki/Sola_fide" id="w">Sola fide</a></i>, which means that salvation or righteousness before God is achievable through faith alone, irrespective of the person&#39;s deeds in life. This belief was a core belief in the theology of the Lutheran reformers <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther" id="w">Martin Luther</a> and <a href="/wiki/Philip_Melanchthon" id="w">Philip Melanchthon</a>. Swedenborg instead held that salvation is only possible through the conjunction of faith and charity in a person, and that the purpose of faith is to lead a person to live according to the truths of faith, which is <a href="/wiki/Charity_(virtue)" id="w">charity</a>. He further states that faith and charity must be exercised by doing good out of willing good whenever possible, which are good works or good uses, otherwise the conjunction perishes. In one section he wrote:</p>
