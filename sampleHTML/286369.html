The <b>assassination of John F.

<a id="Background_of_the_visit" name="Background_of_the_visit"></a><h2>Background of the visit</h2>

<p>Kennedy had chosen to visit Dallas for three main reasons: to help generate more <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic Party</a> presidential campaign fund contributions in advance of the November 1964 <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1964" id="w">presidential election</a>; to begin his quest for re-election; and, because the Kennedy-<a href="/wiki/Lyndon_Johnson" id="w">Johnson</a> ticket had barely won <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a> (and had lost Dallas) in 1960, to mend political fences among several leading Texas Democratic Party members who appeared to be fighting politically amongst themselves. The basic decision on the November trip to Texas was made at a meeting of President Kennedy, Vice President Johnson and Texas Governor <a href="/wiki/John_Connally" id="w">John Connally</a> on <a href="/wiki/June_5" id="w">June 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>. The trip also included a first stop in <a href="/wiki/Houston%2C_Texas" id="w">Houston</a> for a 3,200-person dinner for senior Congressman <a href="/wiki/Albert_Richard_Thomas" id="w">Albert Thomas</a>, who was considering not seeking re-election. On <a href="/wiki/September_26" id="w">September 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>, the two daily Dallas newspapers confirmed plans of the November visit.</p>
<p>There were concerns about security, because as recently as <a href="/wiki/October_24" id="w">October 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations" id="w">United States Ambassador to the United Nations</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adlai_Stevenson" id="w">Adlai Stevenson</a>, had been jeered, jostled, struck by a protest sign and spat upon during a visit to Dallas. The danger from a concealed <a href="/wiki/Sniper" id="w">sniper</a> on the Dallas trip was also of concern. President Kennedy had mentioned it the morning he was assassinated, as had the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service" id="w">Secret Service</a> agents when they were fixing the motorcade route.</p>
<p>Sgt. Davis, of the Dallas Police Department, had prepared the most stringent security precautions in the city&#39;s history, so that the demonstrations like those marking the Stevenson visit would not happen again. But Winston Lawson of the Secret Service, who was in charge of the planning, told the Dallas Police not to assign its usual squad of experienced homicide detectives to follow immediately behind the President&#39;s car. This police protection was routine for both visiting presidents and for motorcades of other visiting dignitaries. Police Chief <a href="/wiki/Jesse_Curry" id="w">Jesse Curry</a> later testified that had his men been in place, the murder might have been prevented, because they carried submachine guns and rifles to take out any attackers, or at least they might have been able to stop Oswald before he left the building.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was planned that Kennedy would travel from <a href="/wiki/Dallas_Love_Field" id="w">Love Field</a> airport in a motorcade through downtown Dallas (including Dealey Plaza) to give a speech at the <a href="/wiki/Dallas_Market_Center" id="w">Dallas Trade Mart</a>. The car in which he was traveling was a 1961 <a href="/wiki/Lincoln_Continental" id="w">Lincoln Continental</a>, open-top, modified limousine. No presidential car with a bulletproof top was yet in service in 1963, though plans for such a top were presented in October 1963.</p>
<p>The motorcade route was described in both Dallas newspapers on <a href="/wiki/November_19" id="w">November 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>, and a map of the route was published on <a href="/wiki/November_21" id="w">November 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Just before 12:30 p.m. CST, Kennedy’s limousine entered Dealey Plaza and slowly approached the Texas School Book Depository head-on, and then turned left 120-degrees directly in front of the Depository, 65 feet (20 m) away.</p>
<p>When the Presidential limousine passed the Depository and continued down Elm Street, shots were fired at Kennedy; the great majority of witnesses recalled hearing three shots.<sup id="_ref-Earwitnesses_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Earwitnesses" title="">[5]</a></sup> There was hardly any reaction in the crowd to the first shot, many later saying they thought they had heard a firecracker or the exhaust backfire of a vehicle.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> President Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally, sitting with his wife in front of the Kennedys in the limousine, both turned abruptly from looking to their left to looking to their right. Connally immediately recognized the sound of a high powered rifle. &#34;Oh, no, no, no,&#34; he said as he turned further right, and then started to turn left, attempting to see President Kennedy behind him.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the Warren Commission<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> and the House Select Committee on Assassinations,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> as President Kennedy waved to the crowds on his right, a shot entered his upper back, penetrated his neck, and exited his throat. He raised his clenched fists up to his neck and leaned forward and to his left, as Mrs. Kennedy put her arms around him in concern. Governor Connally also reacted, as the same <a href="/wiki/Single_bullet_theory" id="w">bullet</a> penetrated his back, chest, right wrist, and left thigh. He yelled, &#34;My God, they are going to kill us all.&#34;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>
The final shot took place when the Presidential limousine was passing in front of the <a href="/wiki/John_Neely_Bryan" id="w">John Neely Bryan</a> north <a href="/wiki/Pergola" id="w">pergola</a> concrete structure. As the shot was heard, a fist-size hole exploded out from the right side of President Kennedy&#39;s head, covering the interior of the car and a nearby motorcycle officer with blood and brain tissue.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> </p>           
<p>Secret Service agent <a href="/wiki/Clint_Hill" id="w">Clint Hill</a> was riding on the left front running board of the car immediately behind the Presidential limousine. Sometime after the shot that hit the President in the back, Hill jumped off and ran to overtake the limousine. <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>
After the shot that hit the President in the head, Mrs. Kennedy climbed onto the rear of the limousine, though she later had no recollection of doing so.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Hill believed she was reaching for something, perhaps a piece of the President&#39;s skull.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> He jumped onto the back of the limousine, pushed Mrs. Kennedy back into her seat, and clung to the car as it exited Dealey Plaza and sped to <a href="/wiki/Parkland_Memorial_Hospital" id="w">Parkland Memorial Hospital</a>.

<a id="Others_wounded" name="Others_wounded"></a><h3>Others wounded</h3>
<p>Governor Connally, riding in the same limousine in a seat in front of the President, was also critically injured but survived. Doctors later stated that after the governor was shot, Mrs. Connally pulled the governor onto her lap, and the resulting posture helped close his front chest wound (which was causing air to be sucked directly into his chest around his collapsed right lung).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/James_Tague" id="w">James Tague</a>, a spectator and witness to the assassination, also received a minor wound to his right cheek while standing 270 feet (82 m) in front of where Kennedy was shot. The injury resulted from debris ejected when a bullet or bullet fragment struck a nearby curb.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Aftermath_in_Dealey_Plaza" name="Aftermath_in_Dealey_Plaza"></a><h3>Aftermath in Dealey Plaza</h3>
<p>The Presidential limousine was passing a <a href="/wiki/Dealey_Plaza#The &#34;grassy knoll&#34;" id="w">grassy knoll</a> on the north side of Elm Street at the moment of the fatal head shot. As the motorcade left the plaza, police officers and spectators ran up the knoll and from a railroad bridge over Elm Street (the Triple Underpass), to the area behind a five-foot (1.5 m) high stockade fence atop the knoll, separating it from a parking lot. No sniper was found.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> S. M. Holland, who had been watching the motorcade on the Triple Underpass, testified that &#34;immediately&#34; after the shots were fired, he went around the corner where the overpass joined the fence but did not see anyone running from the area.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Lee_Bowers" id="w">Lee Bowers</a>, a railroad switchman sitting in a two-story tower, had an unobstructed view of the rear of the stockade fence atop the grassy knoll during the shooting. He saw a total of four men in the area between his tower and Elm Street: a middle-aged man and a younger man, standing 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 m) apart near the Triple Underpass, who did not seem to know each other, and one or two uniformed parking lot attendants. At the time of the shooting, he saw &#34;something out of the ordinary, a sort of milling around,&#34; which he could not identify, but he did not see a gunman. Bowers testified that one or both of the men were still there when motorcycle officer Clyde Haygood ran up the grassy knoll to the back of the fence.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> In a 1966 interview, Bowers clarified that the two men he saw were on the opposite side of the stockade fence from him, and that no one was behind the fence at the time the shots were fired.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Howard_Brennan" id="w">Howard Brennan</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Steamfitter" id="w">steamfitter</a> who was sitting across the street from the Texas School Book Depository, notified police that as he watched the motorcade go by, he heard a shot come from above, and looked up to see a man with a rifle make another shot from a corner window on the sixth floor. He had seen the same man minutes earlier looking out the window.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Brennan gave a description of the shooter, which was broadcast to all Dallas police at 12:45 p.m., 12:48 p.m., and 12:55 p.m.</p>
<p>As Brennan spoke to the police in front of the building, they were joined by Harold Norman and James Jarman, Jr.,<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> two employees of the Texas School Book Depository who had watched the motorcade from windows at the southeast corner of the fifth floor.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> The two reported that they and a third companion, Bonnie Ray Williams, heard three gunshots come from directly over their heads, and saw plaster fall from the ceiling.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Norman also heard the sounds of a bolt action rifle and those of cartridges dropping on the floor above them.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Estimates of when Dallas police sealed off the entrances to the Texas School Book Depository range from 12:33 to after 12:50 p.m.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Of the 104 earwitnesses who gave testimony as to the direction from which the shots came, 56 (53.8%) thought that they came from the direction of the Texas School Book Depository, 35 (33.7%) thought that they came from the area of the grassy knoll or the Triple Underpass, 8 (7.7%) thought the shots came from a location entirely distinct from the knoll or the Depository, and 5 (4.8%) thought they heard shots from two locations.<sup id="_ref-Earwitnesses_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Earwitnesses" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

Lee Harvey Oswald, reported missing to the Dallas police by his supervisor at the Depository,<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> was arrested an hour and 20 minutes after the assassination for killing a Dallas police officer, <a href="/wiki/J.D._Tippit" id="w">J.D.

The staff at Parkland Hospital&#39;s Trauma Room 1 who treated Kennedy observed that his condition was &#34;<a href="/wiki/Moribund" id="w">moribund</a>&#34;, meaning that he had no chance of survival upon arriving at the hospital. Dr. George Gregory Burkley,<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> the President&#39;s personal physician arrived at the Parkland emergency room where the President was located, five minutes after the President arrived.

Dr. Burkley signed President Kennedy&#39;s death certificate.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>At 1:00 p.m., CST (19:00 <a href="/wiki/UTC" id="w">UTC</a>), after all heart activity had ceased and after a priest administered the last rites, the President was pronounced dead. &#34;We never had any hope of saving his life,&#34; one doctor said.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

<p>Governor Connally, meanwhile, was taken to emergency surgery, where he underwent two operations that day.</p>
<p>A few minutes after 2:00 p.m. CST (20:00 <a href="/wiki/UTC" id="w">UTC</a>), and after a  confrontation between Dallas police and Secret Service agents, Kennedy&#39;s body was placed in a casket and taken from Parkland Hospital and driven to <a href="/wiki/Air_Force_One" id="w">Air Force One</a>. The casket was then loaded aboard the airplane through the rear door, where it remained at the rear of the passenger compartment, in place of a removed row of seats. The body was removed before a forensic examination could be conducted by the Dallas County coroner, which violated Texas state law (the murder was a state crime and occurred under Texas legal jurisdiction). At that time, it was not a federal offense to kill the President of the United States.</p>
<p>Vice-President Johnson (who had been riding two cars behind Kennedy in the motorcade through Dallas and was not injured) became President of the United States upon Kennedy&#39;s death. At 2:38 p.m. Johnson took the oath of office on board Air Force One just before it departed Love Field.</p>

<p>After Air Force One landed at <a href="/wiki/Andrews_Air_Force_Base" id="w">Andrews Air Force Base</a>, just outside <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>, Kennedy&#39;s body was taken to <a href="/wiki/Bethesda%2C_Maryland" id="w">Bethesda</a> <a href="/wiki/National_Naval_Medical_Center" id="w">Naval Hospital</a> for an immediate <a href="/wiki/Autopsy" id="w">autopsy</a>.</p>
<p>The autopsy (about 8 to 11 p.m. EST on <a href="/wiki/November_22" id="w">November 22</a>) was followed by embalming and cosmetic funeral preparation (about 11 p.m. to 4 a.m.) in the morgue at Bethesda, in a room adjacent to the autopsy theater. This was done by a team of private mortuary personnel, who made an unusual trip to the hospital for this procedure, not ordinarily done there.

<p>The autopsy of President Kennedy performed the night of <a href="/wiki/November_22" id="w">November 22</a> at the Bethesda Naval Hospital led the three examining pathologists to conclude that the bullet wound to the head was fatal, and the bullet had: </p><blockquote> &#34;[E]ntered Kennedy&#39;s head through a small hole in the scalp in the rear of the president&#39;s head, on the right hand side&#39;....

<p>The report addressed a second missile which &#34;entered Kennedy&#39;s upper back above the shoulder blade, passed through the strap muscles at the base of his neck, bruising the upper tip of the right lung without puncturing it, then exiting the front (anterior) neck,&#34; in a wound that was destroyed by the tracheotomy incision.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> This autopsy finding was not corroborated by the President&#39;s personal physician, Dr. Burkley, who recorded, on the death certificate, a bullet to have hit Kennedy at &#34;about&#34; the level of the third thoracic vertebra <a class="externallink" href="http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/arrb/master_med_set/md6/html/Image0.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://history-matters.com/archive/jfk/arrb/master_med_set/md6/html/Image0.htm">(Image)</a>.

<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>After being prepared for a funeral, the President&#39;s body was then brought back to the White House and placed in the East Room in a closed casket for 24 hours but was privately and briefly viewed during this time by the Kennedy family and some close friends. The Sunday following the assassination, his flag-draped closed casket was moved to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Building" id="w">Capitol</a> for public viewing. Throughout the day and night, hundreds of thousands lined up to view the guarded casket.</p>
<p>Representatives from over 90 countries, including the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a>, attended the funeral on <a href="/wiki/November_25" id="w">November 25</a> (which was <a href="/wiki/JFK_Jr." id="w">his son&#39;s</a> third birthday).

No <a href="/wiki/Radio" id="w">radio</a> or <a href="/wiki/Television" id="w">television</a> stations broadcast the assassination live because the area through which the motorcade was traveling was not considered important enough for a live broadcast. Most media crews were not even with the motorcade but were waiting instead at the Dallas Trade Mart in anticipation of Kennedy&#39;s arrival. Those members of the media that were with the motorcade were riding at the rear of the procession.</p>
<p>The Dallas police were recording their radio transmissions over two channels. A frequency designated as Channel One was used for routine police communications. A second channel, designated Channel Two, was an auxiliary channel, which was dedicated to the President&#39;s motorcade. Up until the time of the assassination, most of the broadcasts on this channel consisted of Police Chief Jesse Curry&#39;s announcements of the location of the motorcade as it wound through the streets of Dallas. <a href="/wiki/Dictabelt_evidence_relating_to_the_assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy" id="w">Recordings exist</a> from both police channels.</p>

President Kennedy&#39;s last seconds traveling through Dealey Plaza were recorded on silent <a href="/wiki/8_mm_film" id="w">8 mm film</a> for the 26.6 seconds before, during, and immediately following the assassination. This famous film footage was taken by garment manufacturer and amateur cameraman <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Zapruder" id="w">Abraham Zapruder</a>, in what became known as the <a href="/wiki/Zapruder_film" id="w">Zapruder film</a>. It is well-known to the general public for the repeated appearance of excerpts from it in the movie <i>JFK</i>. Frame enlargements from the Zapruder film were published by <a href="/wiki/Life_(magazine)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Life&#39;&#39; magazine</a> shortly after the assassination. The footage was repeatedly shown on television, starting in 1975, sometimes omitting the fatal head shot. </p>
<p>Zapruder was not the only one who photographed at least part of the assassination. A total of 32 photographers were in Dealey Plaza. Amateur movies taken by <a href="/wiki/Orville_Nix" id="w">Orville Nix</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marie_Muchmore" id="w">Marie Muchmore</a>, and Charles Bronson (not the <a href="/wiki/Charles_Bronson" id="w">actor</a>) captured the fatal shot, although at a greater distance than Zapruder. Other motion picture films were taken in Dealey Plaza at or around the time of the shooting by Robert Hughes, F. Mark Bell, Elsie Dorman, John Martin Jr., Patsy Paschall, Tina Towner, James Underwood, Dave Wiegman, <a href="/wiki/Mal_Couch" id="w">Mal Couch</a>, Thomas Atkins, and an unknown woman in a blue dress on the south side of Elm Street.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Still photos were taken by Phillip Willis, <a href="/wiki/Mary_Moorman" id="w">Mary Moorman</a>, Hugh W.

<p>An unidentified woman, nicknamed the <a href="/wiki/Babushka_lady" id="w">Babushka Lady</a> by researchers, might have been filming the presidential motorcade during the assassination because she was seen apparently doing so on film and photographs taken by the others.</p>

The film does not include depiction of the actual shooting, having been taken roughly 90 seconds beforehand and a couple of blocks away. The only detail relevant to the investigation of the assassination is a clear view of Kennedy&#39;s bunched suit jacket, just below the collar, which has led to different calculations about how low in the back Kennedy was first shot (see discussion above).</p>

<a id="Dallas_Police" name="Dallas_Police"></a><h3>Dallas Police</h3>
<p>After arresting Oswald and collecting physical evidence at the crime scenes, the Dallas Police held Oswald at the police headquarters for interrogation. Oswald was questioned all afternoon about both the Tippit shooting and the assassination of the President. He was questioned intermittently for approximately 12 hours between 2:30 p.m., on <a href="/wiki/November_22" id="w">November 22</a>, and 11 a.m., on <a href="/wiki/November_24" id="w">November 24</a>.<sup id="_ref-Warren181_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Warren181" title="">[51]</a></sup> Throughout this interrogation Oswald denied any involvement with either the assassination of President Kennedy or the murder of Patrolman Tippit.<sup id="_ref-Warren181_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Warren181" title="">[51]</a></sup> Captain Fritz of the homicide and robbery bureau did most of the questioning, keeping only rudimentary notes.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> Days later he wrote a report of the interrogation from notes he made afterwards.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> There were no stenographic or tape recordings. Representatives of other law enforcement agencies were also present, including the <a href="/wiki/FBI" id="w">FBI</a> and the U.S. Secret Service, and occasionally participated in the questioning.<sup id="_ref-WarrenOswaldStatements_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WarrenOswaldStatements" title="">[54]</a></sup> Several of the FBI agents present wrote contemporaneous reports of the interrogation.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the evening of <a href="/wiki/November_22" id="w">November 22</a>, the Dallas Police Department performed <a href="/wiki/Paraffin" id="w">paraffin</a> tests on Oswald&#39;s hands and right cheek in an apparent effort to determine, by means of a scientific test, whether Oswald had recently fired a weapon.<sup id="_ref-WarrenOswaldStatements_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WarrenOswaldStatements" title="">[54]</a></sup> The results were positive for the hands and negative for the right cheek.<sup id="_ref-WarrenOswaldStatements_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WarrenOswaldStatements" title="">[54]</a></sup> However, because of the unreliability of these tests, the Warren Commission did not rely on the results of the test in making their findings.<sup id="_ref-WarrenOswaldStatements_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WarrenOswaldStatements" title="">[54]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Oswald provided little information during his questioning. Frequently, however, he was confronted with evidence which he could not explain, and he resorted to statements which were found to be false.<sup id="_ref-WarrenOswaldStatements_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WarrenOswaldStatements" title="">[54]</a></sup> Dallas authorities were not able to complete their investigation into the assassination of Kennedy because of interruptions from the FBI and the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby.</p>
<a id="FBI_investigation" name="FBI_investigation"></a><h3>FBI investigation</h3>
<p>The FBI was the first authority to complete an investigation. On <a href="/wiki/November_24" id="w">November 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>, just hours after Lee Harvey Oswald was murdered, FBI Director, <a href="/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover" id="w">J.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/December_9" id="w">December 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>, only 17 days after the assassination, the FBI report was issued and given to the Warren Commission. Then, the FBI stayed on as the primary investigating authority for the commission. </p>
<p>The FBI stated that only three bullets were fired during the assassination; The Warren Commission agreed with the FBI investigation that only three shots were fired but disagreed with the FBI report on which shots hit Kennedy and which hit Governor Connally. The FBI report claimed that the first shot hit President Kennedy, the second shot hit Governor Connally, and the third shot hit Kennedy in the head, killing him. In contrast, the Warren Commission concluded that one of the three shots missed, one of the shots hit Kennedy and then struck Connally, and a third shot struck Kennedy in the head, killing him. </p>
<a id="Criticism_of_FBI" name="Criticism_of_FBI"></a><h4>Criticism of FBI</h4>
<p>The FBI&#39;s murder investigation was reviewed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1979. The congressional Committee concluded:</p>
<p /><blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The Federal Bureau of Investigation adequately investigated Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination and properly evaluated the evidence it possessed to assess his potential to endanger the public safety in a national emergency. </li>
<li>The Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted a thorough and professional investigation into the responsibility of Lee Harvey Oswald for the assassination. </li>
<li>The Federal Bureau of Investigation failed to investigate adequately the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President.</li>
<li>The Federal Bureau of Investigation was deficient in its sharing of information with other agencies and departments.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>The FBI has received added scrutiny by Kennedy assassination researchers because of the actions of FBI agent <a href="/wiki/James_Hosty" id="w">James Hosty</a>. Hosty appeared in Oswald&#39;s address book. The FBI provided to the Warren Commission a typewritten transcription of Oswald&#39;s address book, in which Hosty&#39;s name and phone number were omitted. Two days before the assassination, Oswald went to the FBI office in Dallas to meet with Hosty, and when he found that Hosty was not in the office at the time, Oswald left an envelope for Hosty with a letter inside.

After Oswald was murdered by <a href="/wiki/Jack_Ruby" id="w">Jack Ruby</a>, Hosty&#39;s supervisor ordered Hosty to destroy the letter, and he did so by tearing the letter up and flushing it down the toilet. Months later, when Hosty testified before the Warren Commission, he did not disclose this connection with Oswald. This information became public later and was investigated by the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup>

</p></blockquote><a id="Warren_Commission" name="Warren_Commission"></a><h3>Warren Commission</h3>
<p>{{main}}
The first official investigation of the assassination was established by President Johnson on <a href="/wiki/November_29" id="w">November 29</a> <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>, a week after the assassination. The commission was headed by <a href="/wiki/Earl_Warren" id="w">Earl Warren</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States" id="w">Chief Justice of the United States</a> and became universally (but unofficially) known as the Warren Commission.</p>
<p>In late September 1964, after a 10 month investigation, the Warren Commission Report was published. The Commission concluded that it could not find any persuasive evidence of a domestic or foreign conspiracy involving any other person(s), group(s), or country(ies). The Commission found that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the murder of Kennedy, and that Jack Ruby acted alone in the murder of Oswald. The theory that Oswald acted alone is informally called the <i><a href="/wiki/Lone_gunman_theory" id="w">Lone gunman theory</a></i>.</p>
<p>The commission also concluded that only three bullets were fired during the assassination and that Lee Harvey Oswald fired all three bullets from the Texas School Book Depository behind the motorcade. The Commission also laid out several scenarios concerning the timing of the shots, but that the three shots were fired in a time period ranging from approximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>The commission also concluded that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>one shot likely missed the motorcade (it could not determine which of the three),</li>
<li>the first shot to hit anyone struck Kennedy in the upper back, exited near the front of his neck and likely continued on to cause all of Governor Connally&#39;s injuries, and</li>
<li>the last shot to hit anyone struck Kennedy in the head, fatally wounding him.</li></ul>
<p>It noted that three empty shells were found in the sixth floor in the book depository, and a rifle identified as the one used in the shooting — Oswald&#39;s Italian military surplus 6.5x52 mm Model 91/38 Carcano — was found hidden nearby. The Commission offered as a likely explanation that the same bullet that wounded Kennedy also caused all of Governor Connally&#39;s wounds. This single bullet then backed out of Connally&#39;s left thigh and was found on a stretcher in the hospital. This theory has become known as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Single_bullet_theory" id="w">single bullet theory</a>&#34; or the &#34;magic&#34; bullet theory (as it is commonly referred to by its critics and detractors).</p>
<p>The Commission also looked into other matters beside who killed the President and criticized weaknesses in security, which has resulted in greatly increased security whenever the President travels. The unpublished supporting documents for the Warren Commission Report are due to be released by 2017. The Commission&#39;s unpublished records were initially sealed for 75 years (to 2039) under a general <a href="/wiki/National_Archives" id="w">National Archives</a> policy that applied to all federal investigations by the executive branch of government,<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> a period &#34;intended to serve as protection for innocent persons who could otherwise be damaged because of their relationship with participants in the case.”<sup id="_ref-Bahmer24_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bahmer24" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Public_response_to_the_Warren_Report" name="Public_response_to_the_Warren_Report"></a><h4>Public response to the Warren Report</h4>
<p>Almost immediately after the Warren Commission Report was issued, some began seriously questioning its conclusions. A multitude of books and articles criticizing the Warren Commission&#39;s findings have been written. The Commission&#39;s conclusions have also gradually but continually lost widespread acceptance from the American public and various prominent government officials. Yet subsequent reinvestigations by special panels on the Kennedy assassination have, with one exception — the HSCA&#39;s controversial <a href="/wiki/Dictabelt_evidence_relating_to_the_assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy" id="w">Dictabelt evidence</a> — come to the same main conclusions as the Warren Commission did in 1964.</p>
<a id="Ramsey_Clark_Panel" name="Ramsey_Clark_Panel"></a><h3>Ramsey Clark Panel</h3>
<p>In 1968 a panel of four medical experts appointed by <a href="/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General" id="w">Attorney General</a> <a href="/wiki/Ramsey_Clark" id="w">Ramsey Clark</a> met in Washington, D.C. to examine various photographs, X-ray films, documents and other evidence pertaining to the death of President Kennedy. The Clark Panel determined that Kennedy was struck by two bullets fired from above and behind him, one of which traversed the base of the neck on the right side without striking bone and the other of which entered the skull from behind and destroyed its upper right side.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> The chain of custody of the evidence on which the panel reached its conclusions has been called into question. Clark raised this issue with President Johnson.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> The Assassination Records Review Board said in 1998: &#34;[T]he persons handling the autopsy records did not create a complete and contemporaneous accounting of the number of photographs nor was a proper chain of custody established for all of the autopsy materials.&#34;<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> However, the House Select Committee on Assassinations subjected the photos and x-rays from the autopsy to scientific investigation by a panel of experts and concluded the materials were authentic.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Rockefeller_Commission" name="Rockefeller_Commission"></a><h3>Rockefeller Commission</h3>
<p>The <i>U.S. President&#39;s Commission on CIA activities within the United States</i> was set up under President <a href="/wiki/Gerald_Ford" id="w">Gerald Ford</a> in 1975 to investigate the activities of the <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" id="w">CIA</a> within the United States. The commission was led by Vice President <a href="/wiki/Nelson_Rockefeller" id="w">Nelson Rockefeller</a>, and is sometimes referred to as the <a href="/wiki/Rockefeller_Commission" id="w">Rockefeller Commission</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the commission&#39;s work dealt with the Kennedy assassination, specifically the head snap as seen in the <a href="/wiki/Zapruder_film" id="w">Zapruder film</a> (first shown to the general public in 1975), and the possible presence of <a href="/wiki/E._Howard_Hunt" id="w">E.

<a id="House_Select_Committee_on_Assassinations" name="House_Select_Committee_on_Assassinations"></a><h3>House Select Committee on Assassinations</h3>
<p>{{main}}
Fifteen years after the Warren Commission issued its report, a congressional committee named the <a href="/wiki/House_Select_Committee_on_Assassinations" id="w">House Select Committee on Assassinations</a> reviewed the Warren Commission report and the underlying FBI report on which the Commission heavily relied. </p>
<p>The Committee criticized the performance of both the Warren Commission and the FBI for failing to investigate whether other people conspired with Oswald to murder President Kennedy.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> The Committee Report concluded that:</p>
<p>&#34;[T]he FBI&#39;s investigation of whether there had been a conspiracy in President Kennedy&#39;s assassination was seriously flawed. The conspiracy aspects of the investigation were characterized by a limited approach and an inadequate application and use of available resource.&#34; (footnote 12)</p>
<p>The Committee found the Warren Commission&#39;s investigation equally flawed: &#34;[T]he subject that should have received the Commission&#39;s most probing analysis — whether Oswald acted in concert with or on behalf of unidentified co-conspirators the Commission&#39;s performance, in the view of the committee, was in fact flawed.&#34; (footnote 13)</p>
<p>The Committee believed another primary cause of the Warren Commission&#39;s failure to adequately probe and analyze whether or not Oswald acted alone arose out of the lack of cooperation by the CIA. Finally, the Committee found that the Warren Commission inadequately investigated for a conspiracy because of: &#34;[T]ime pressures and the desire of national leaders to allay public fears of a conspiracy.&#34;</p>
<p>The committee concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald fired three shots at President John F. Kennedy. The second and third shots he fired struck the President. The third shot he fired killed him. The HSCA agreed with the single bullet theory but concluded that it occurred at a time during the assassination that differed from what the Warren Commission had theorized. Their theory, based primarily on <a href="/wiki/Dictabelt_evidence_relating_to_the_assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy" id="w">Dictabelt evidence</a>, was that President Kennedy was assassinated probably as a result of a <a href="/wiki/Conspiracy_(political)" id="w">conspiracy</a>. They proposed that four shots had been fired during the assassination; Oswald fired the first, second, and fourth bullets, and that (based on the acoustic evidence) there was a high probability that an unnamed second assassin fired the third bullet, but missed, from President Kennedy&#39;s right front, from a location concealed behind the grassy knoll picket fence.</p>
<p>Many years after the House Select Committee on Assassinations issued its report, the attorney G. Robert Blakey for the House Select Committee on Assassinations issued a statement to the news media calling into question the honesty of the CIA in its dealings with the Committee and the accuracy of the information given to it. </p>
<a id="Response_to_the_Dictabelt_evidence" name="Response_to_the_Dictabelt_evidence"></a><h4> Response to the Dictabelt evidence </h4>
<p>Blakey told ABC News that the conclusion that a conspiracy existed in the assassination was established by both witness testimony and acoustic evidence:
</p><blockquote>The shot from the grassy knoll is not only supported by the acoustics, which is a tape that we found of a police motorcycle broadcast back to the district station. It is corroborated by eyewitness testimony in the plaza. There were 20 people, at least, who heard a shot from the grassy knoll.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>The sole acoustic evidence relied on by the committee to support its conclusion of a fourth gunshot (and a gunman on the grassy knoll) in the JFK assassination, was a Dictabelt recording alleged to be from a stuck transmitter on a police motorcycle in Dealey Plaza during the assassination.<sup id="_ref-nas04_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nas04" title="">[70]</a></sup> The evidence was presented by Mark R. Weiss and Ernest Aschkenasy, acoustical experts from <a href="/wiki/Queens_College" id="w">Queens College</a>,<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> who had been part of the 1974 panel that concluded that the 18½ minute gap in the <a href="/wiki/Watergate_tapes" id="w">Watergate tapes</a> was because that section was erased.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the committee finished its work, however, an amateur researcher listened to the recording and discovered faint crosstalk of transmissions from another police radio channel known to have been made a minute <i>after</i> the assassination.<sup id="_ref-nas04_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nas04" title="">[70]</a></sup> Further, the Dallas motorcycle policeman thought to be the source of the sounds followed the motorcade to the hospital at high speed, his siren blaring, immediately after the shots were fired. Yet the recording is of a mostly idling motorcycle, eventually determined to have been at JFK&#39;s destination, the Dallas Trade Mart, miles from Dealey Plaza.</p>
<p>Several years later, in 1981, a special panel of the <a href="/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences" id="w">National Academy of Sciences</a> (NAS) disputed the evidence of a fourth shot, contained on the police Dictabelt.<sup id="_ref-nas04_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nas04" title="">[70]</a></sup> The panel concluded it was simply random noise, perhaps static, recorded about a minute after the shooting while Kennedy&#39;s motorcade was en route to Parkland Hospital.</p>
<p>The NAS experts, headed by physicist Norman F. Ramsey of Harvard, reached that conclusion after studying the sounds on the two radio channels Dallas police were using that day. Routine transmissions were made on Channel One and recorded on a Dictaphone machine at police headquarters. An auxiliary frequency, Channel Two, was dedicated to the president&#39;s motorcade and used primarily by Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry; its transmissions were recorded on a separate <a href="/wiki/Gray_Audograph" id="w">Gray Audograph</a> disc machine.</p>
<p>The conclusion by the NAS was then rebutted in 2001 in a Science and Justice article by D.B. Thomas, a government scientist and JFK assassination researcher.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> Thomas concluded the HSCA finding of a second shooter was correct and that the NAS panel&#39;s study was flawed. Thomas surmises that the Dictaphone needle jumped and created an overdub on Channel One.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup></p>
<p>In response to Thomas&#39;s findings, Michael O&#39;Dell concluded in his report that the prior reports relied on incorrect timelines and made unfounded assumptions that, when corrected, do not support the identification of gunshots on the recording.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2003, <a href="/wiki/ABC_News" id="w">ABC News</a> aired the results of their investigation of the assassination in a news-documentary program called <i><a href="/wiki/Peter_Jennings" id="w">Peter Jennings</a> Reporting: The Kennedy Assassination — Beyond Conspiracy</i>. Based on computer diagrams and recreations done by <a href="/wiki/Dale_K._Myers" id="w">Dale K. Myers</a>, ABC News concluded that the sound recordings on the Dictabelt could not have come from Dealey Plaza and that the Police Officer <a href="/wiki/H.B._McLain" id="w">H.B. McLain</a> was correct in his assertions that he had not yet entered Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2005, an article in <i><a href="/wiki/Science_%26amp%3B_Justice" id="w">Science &#38; Justice</a></i> by Ralph Linsker, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Garwin" id="w">Richard Garwin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Herman_Chernoff" id="w">Herman Chernoff</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Horowitz" id="w">Paul Horowitz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Norman_Foster_Ramsey%2C_Jr." id="w">Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.</a> re-analyzed the acoustic synchronization evidence, rebutting Thomas&#39; 2001 argument as well as correcting errors in the 1982 NAS report, while supporting the NAS report&#39;s finding that the sounds alleged to be gunshots occurred about a minute after the assassination.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> Followup articles in <i>Science &#38; Justice</i> have been published.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>

{{main}}
An official investigation by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), conducted from 1976 to 1979, concluded that Oswald assassinated President Kennedy as a result of a probable conspiracy. This conclusion of a likely conspiracy contrasts with the earlier conclusion by the Warren Commission that the President was assassinated by a lone gunman.</p>
<p>In the ensuing four decades since the assassination, many theories have been proposed or published that detail organized conspiracies to kill the President. These theories implicate, among others, <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuban</a> President <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" id="w">Fidel Castro</a>, the anti-Castro Cuban community,<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup> President Johnson, the <a href="/wiki/Mafia" id="w">Mafia</a>, the FBI, the CIA and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Bloc" id="w">Soviet Bloc</a> — or perhaps some combination of these.</p>
<p>A few claim that Oswald was not involved at all. Shortly after his arrest, Oswald insisted he was a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Scapegoat" id="w">patsy</a>&#34;. Oswald never admitted any participation in the assassination and was murdered two days after being taken into police custody.</p>
<p>Some polls indicate a large number of Americans are suspicious of official government conclusions — primarily the Warren Commission&#39;s findings — regarding the assassination. A 2003 ABC News poll found that 70% of respondents suspected there was an assassination plot.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup>
These same polls also show that there is no agreement on who else may have been involved.</p>
