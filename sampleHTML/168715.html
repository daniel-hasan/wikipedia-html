He said he would not vote for his own bill, but if his fellow members of Congress wished to go to war in Iraq, they should follow the Constitution and declare war. As one of six Republicans to vote against the Iraq War Resolution, Paul inspired the founding of a group called the National Peace Lobby Project to promote a resolution he and Oregon representative <a href="/wiki/Peter_DeFazio" id="w">Peter DeFazio</a> sponsored to repeal the war authorization in February 2003. His speech, 35&#160;&#34;Questions That Won&#39;t Be Asked About Iraq,&#34;<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> was translated and published in German, French, Russian, Italian, and Swiss periodicals before the Iraq War began.<sup id="_ref-wsj2003_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wsj2003" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>

<p>Paul charged his fellow legislators with voting for the Patriot Act without reading it first; more than 300&#160;pages long, it was enacted into law less than 24&#160;hours after being introduced. In response to such Congressional actions, Paul introduced &#34;Sunlight Rule&#34; legislation, which would not allow votes on legislation to occur until ten days after its introduction, with the intent of giving lawmakers enough time to read bills before voting on them. The bill requires allotting 72&#160;hours for House members and staff to examine the contents of amendments.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2005 and 2007, Paul introduced the Sanctity of Life Act, which would remove federal court jurisdiction over abortion cases arising from state laws and effectively negate <i><a href="/wiki/Roe_v._Wade" id="w">Roe v.

Also, for the purposes of <a href="/wiki/Statutory_construction" id="w">statutory construction</a> over the jurisdictional limitation imposed, the bill declares that &#34;human life shall be deemed to exist from conception.&#34;<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-lifeliberty_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lifeliberty" title="">[83]</a></sup> Paul has also introduced a Constitutional amendment with similar intent.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_15" id="w">October 15</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, Paul introduced the American Freedom Agenda Act of 2007, which would &#34;bar the use of evidence obtained through torture; require that federal intelligence gathering is conducted in accordance with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA); create a mechanism for challenging presidential signing statements; repeal the Military Commissions Act, which, among other things, denies habeas corpus to certain detainees; prohibit kidnapping, detentions, and torture abroad; protect journalists who publish information received from the executive branch; and ensure that secret evidence is not used to designate individuals or organizations with a presence in the U.S. as foreign terrorists.&#34;<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Actions_in_Congress" name="Actions_in_Congress"></a><h3>Actions in Congress</h3>
<p>Paul was on a bipartisan coalition of 17&#160;members of Congress that sued President Bill Clinton in 1999 over his conduct of the <a href="/wiki/Kosovo" id="w">Kosovo</a> war. They accused Clinton of failing to inform Congress of the action&#39;s status within 48&#160;hours as required by WPR, and of failing to obtain Congressional declaration of war as specifically required in the Constitution. Congress had voted 427–2 against a declaration of war with <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" id="w">Yugoslavia</a>, and had voted to deny support for the air campaign in Kosovo. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that since Congress had voted for funding after Clinton had actively engaged troops in the war with Kosovo, legislators had sent a confusing message about whether they approved of the war. Paul said that the judge&#39;s decision attempted to circumvent the Constitution and to authorize the president to conduct a war without approval from Congress.<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup></p>
