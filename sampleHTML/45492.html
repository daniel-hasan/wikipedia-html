<b><i>I Am Legend</i></b> is a 1954 <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a> novel by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Matheson" id="w">Richard Matheson</a> about the last man alive in a future <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles%2C_California" id="w">Los Angeles</a> overrun with vampires. Notable as influential on the developing modern <a href="/wiki/Zombies_in_popular_culture" id="w">zombie genre</a>, in popularizing the fictional concept of a worldwide <a href="/wiki/Apocalypse" id="w">apocalypse</a> due to <a href="/wiki/Disease" id="w">disease</a>, and in exploring the notion of vampirism as a disease. The novel was a success, and was adapted to film as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Last_Man_on_Earth_(1964_film)" id="w">The Last Man on Earth</a></i> in 1964, as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Omega_Man" id="w">The Omega Man</a></i> in 1971, and again in 2007 as <i><a href="/wiki/I_Am_Legend_(film)" id="w">I Am Legend</a></i>. </p>
<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h2> Plot </h2>
<p>The story takes place between January 1976 and January 1979 in Southern California. The novel opens with the monotony and horror of the daily life of the <a href="/wiki/Protagonist" id="w">protagonist</a>, Robert Neville. Neville is apparently the only survivor of an <a href="/wiki/End_of_civilization" id="w">apocalypse</a> caused by a <a href="/wiki/Pandemic" id="w">pandemic</a> of <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" id="w">bacteria</a>, the symptoms of which are similar to <a href="/wiki/Vampirism" id="w">vampirism</a>. He spends every day repairing his house, boarding up windows, stringing and hanging garlic, disposing of vampires&#39; corpses on his lawn and going out to gather any additional supplies needed for hunting and killing more vampires.</p>
<p>Much of the story is devoted to Neville&#39;s struggles to understand the plague that has infected everyone around him, and the novel details the progress of his discoveries. </p>
<p>One day, a dog appears in the neighborhood. Neville spends weeks trying to win its trust and domesticate it. He eventually traps the terrified dog and wins it over, but it dies from the vampire infection a week later.</p>
<p>As the story progresses, it is revealed that some infected people have discovered a means to hold the disease at bay. However, the &#34;still living&#34; people appear no different from the true vampire during the day while both are immobilized in sleep. Thus, along with the vampires, Neville kills the still living people. He becomes a source of terror to the still living, since he can go around in daylight (which they can only do for a short length of time using a special pill) and kill them while they sleep.  </p>
<p>They send a still living woman named Ruth to spy on Neville, and they replicate Neville&#39;s relationship with the dog. Ruth, terrified of Neville at first sight, goes against her role of spying on him and runs away. Rather than spend weeks trying to win her over, he attacks her and drags her back to his house.  Eventually Neville performs a blood test on her, revealing her true nature to him right before she knocks him out with a mallet. Ruth leaves a note telling him about the group of people like her, explaining that she was sent to spy and how monstrous he appears to them. Months later, the still living people attack, injuring Neville, but taking him alive so that he can be executed in front of everyone in the new society (which Neville finds very primitive). </p>
<p>Before he can be executed, Ruth provides him with an envelope of pills. Neville takes the pills to commit suicide before the still living execute him. As he dies he reflects on how the new society of the living infected regards him as a monster. Just as vampires were regarded as legendary monsters that preyed on the vulnerable humans in their beds, Neville has become a mythical figure that kills both vampires and the infected living while they are sleeping. He becomes a legend as the vampires once were, hence the title &#34;I Am Legend&#34;.</p>

<i>I Am Legend</i> would influence the <a href="/wiki/Vampire_literature" id="w">Vampire genre</a>, and popularized the fictional concept of a worldwide <a href="/wiki/Apocalypse" id="w">apocalypse</a> due to a disease. Although classified as a vampire story and referred to as &#34;the first modern vampire novel,&#34;<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> <i>Legend</i> made an impression on the zombie genre by way of <a href="/wiki/Film_director" id="w">film director</a> <a href="/wiki/George_A._Romero" id="w">George A. Romero</a>. Romero has acknowledged the influence of the novel and its 1964 adaptation on his <a href="/wiki/1968_in_film" id="w">1968 film</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Dead" id="w">Night of the Living Dead</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Critics have also picked up on similarities between <i>Night</i> and <i>Last Man on Earth</i>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Stephen King said, &#34;without Richard Matheson I wouldn’t be around.&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Some film critics have noted that the <a href="/wiki/2002_in_film" id="w">2002</a> British film <i><a href="/wiki/28_Days_Later" id="w">28 Days Later</a></i> and its sequel <i><a href="/wiki/28_Weeks_Later" id="w">28 Weeks Later</a></i>, which feature a rabies-like plague that ravages Great Britain, are similar to the scenario in <i>I Am Legend</i>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The recasting of undead creatures as <a href="/wiki/Disease" id="w">disease</a> victims is also comparable to recent zombie media such as the <a href="/wiki/Resident_Evil" id="w">Resident Evil</a> series, the <a href="/wiki/Blade" id="w">Blade</a> trilogy, and the 1984 <a href="/wiki/B-movie" id="w">B-movie</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Night_of_the_Comet" id="w">Night of the Comet</a></i>.</p>
<p>A straight to <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVD</a> film by The Asylum called <i><a href="/wiki/I_Am_Omega" id="w">I Am Omega</a></i> was released at the same time as the 2007 film <i>I Am Legend</i>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
