<b>Japanese art</b> covers a wide range of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture in wood and bronze, ink painting on silk and paper, and a myriad of other types of works of art. It also has a long history, ranging from the beginnings of human habitation in <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present.</p>
<p>Historically, Japan has been subject to sudden invasions of new and alien ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. Over time the Japanese developed the ability to absorb, imitate, and finally assimilate those elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic preferences. The earliest complex art in Japan was produced in the 7th and 8th centuries A.D. in connection with <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" id="w">Buddhism</a>. In the 9th century, as the Japanese began to turn away from <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> and develop indigenous forms of expression, the secular arts became increasingly important; until the late 15th century, both religious and secular arts flourished. After the <a href="/wiki/Ōnin_War" id="w">Ōnin War</a> (<a href="/wiki/1467" id="w">1467</a>-<a href="/wiki/1477" id="w">1477</a>), Japan entered a period of political, social, and economic disruption that lasted for over a century. In the state that emerged under the leadership of the <a href="/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate" id="w">Tokugawa shogunate</a>,organized religion played a much less important role in people&#39;s lives, and the arts that survived were primarily secular.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Painting" id="w">Painting</a> is the preferred artistic expression in Japan, practiced by amateur and professional alike. Until modern times, the Japanese wrote with a <a href="/wiki/Brush" id="w">brush</a> rather than a <a href="/wiki/Pen" id="w">pen</a>, and their familiarity with brush techniques has made them particularly sensitive to the values and <a href="/wiki/Aesthetics" id="w">aesthetics</a> of painting. With the rise of popular culture in the <a href="/wiki/Edo_period" id="w">Edo period</a>, a style of <a href="/wiki/Woodblock_printing" id="w">woodblock prints</a> called <i><a href="/wiki/Ukiyo-e" id="w">ukiyo-e</a></i> became a major artform and its techniques were fine tuned to produce colorful prints of everything from daily news to schoolbooks.  The Japanese, in this period, found <a href="/wiki/Sculpture" id="w">sculpture</a> a much less sympathetic medium for artistic expression; most Japanese sculpture is associated with <a href="/wiki/Religion" id="w">religion</a>, and the medium&#39;s use declined with the lessening importance of traditional Buddhism. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Japanese_pottery" id="w">Japanese ceramics</a> are among the finest in the world and include the earliest known artifacts of their culture. In <a href="/wiki/Japanese_architecture" id="w">architecture</a>, Japanese preferences for natural materials and an interaction of interior and exterior space are clearly expressed.</p>
<p>Today, Japan rivals most other modern nations in its contributions to modern art, fashion and architecture, with creations of a truly modern, global, and multi-cultural (or acultural) bent.</p>

The first settlers of Japan, the <a href="/wiki/J%C5%8Dmon" id="w">Jōmon</a> people (c 11000?&#8211;c 300 BC), named for the <a href="/wiki/Rope" id="w">cord</a> markings that decorated the surfaces of their clay vessels, were nomadic hunter-gatherers who later practiced organized farming and built cities with population of hundreds if not thousands. They built simple houses of wood and thatch set into shallow earthen pits to provide warmth from the soil. They crafted lavishly decorated pottery storage vessels, clay figurines called <i><a href="/wiki/Dogu" id="w">dogu</a></i>, and crystal jewels.</p>
<a id="Yayoi_art" name="Yayoi_art"></a><h2>Yayoi art</h2>
<p>The next wave of immigrants was the <a href="/wiki/Yayoi" id="w">Yayoi</a> people, named for the district in <a href="/wiki/Tokyo" id="w">Tokyo</a> where remnants of their settlements first were found. These people, arriving in Japan about 350 BC, brought their knowledge of wetland rice cultivation, the manufacture of copper weapons and bronze bells (<i><a href="/wiki/D%C5%8Dtaku" id="w">dōtaku</a></i>), and wheel-thrown, kiln-fired ceramics.</p>

<p>The third stage in Japanese prehistory, the <a href="/wiki/Kofun" id="w">Kofun</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Tumulus" id="w">Tumulus</a>, period (c AD 250&#8211;552), represents a modification of <a href="/wiki/Yayoi" id="w">Yayoi</a> culture, attributable either to internal development or external force. In this period, diverse groups of people formed political alliances and coalesced into a nation. Typical artifacts are bronze mirrors, symbols of political alliances, and clay sculptures called <i><a href="/wiki/Haniwa" id="w">haniwa</a></i> which were erected outside tombs.</p>

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Asuka_period" id="w">Asuka</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nara_period" id="w">Nara periods</a>, so named because the seat of Japanese government was located in the Asuka Valley from <a href="/wiki/552" id="w">552</a> to <a href="/wiki/710" id="w">710</a> and in the city of <a href="/wiki/Nara%2C_Nara" id="w">Nara</a> until <a href="/wiki/784" id="w">784</a>, the first significant invasion by Asian continental culture took place in Japan. </p>
<p>The transmission of Buddhism provided the initial impetus for contacts between <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/Korea" id="w">Korea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>. The Japanese recognized the facets of <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_China" id="w">Chinese culture</a> that could profitably be incorporated into their own: a system for converting ideas and sounds into writing; <a href="/wiki/Historiography" id="w">historiography</a>; complex theories of government, such as an effective <a href="/wiki/Bureaucracy" id="w">bureaucracy</a>; and, most important for the arts, new technologies, new building techniques, more advanced methods of casting in <a href="/wiki/Bronze" id="w">bronze</a>, and new techniques and media for painting.</p>
<p>Throughout the 7th and 8th centuries, however, the major focus in contacts between Japan and the Asian continent was the development of Buddhism. Not all scholars agree on the significant dates and the appropriate names to apply to various time periods between <a href="/wiki/552" id="w">552</a>, the official date of the introduction of Buddhism into Japan, and <a href="/wiki/784" id="w">784</a>, when the Japanese capital was transferred from Nara. The most common designations are the Suiko period, <a href="/wiki/552" id="w">552</a>&#8211;<a href="/wiki/645" id="w">645</a>; the Hakuho period, <a href="/wiki/645" id="w">645</a>&#8211;<a href="/wiki/710" id="w">710</a>, and the Tenpyō period, <a href="/wiki/710" id="w">710</a>&#8211;<a href="/wiki/784" id="w">784</a>.</p>
<p>The earliest Japanese sculptures of the Buddha are dated to the 6th and 7th century. They ultimately derive from the 1st-3rd century CE <a href="/wiki/Greco-Buddhist_art" id="w">Greco-Buddhist art</a> of <a href="/wiki/Gandhara" id="w">Gandhara</a>, characterized by flowing dress patterns and realistic rendering, on which Chinese and Korean artistic traits were superimposed.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> They illustrate the terminal point of the <a href="/wiki/Silk_Road_transmission_of_Art" id="w">Silk Road transmission of Art</a> during the first few centuries of our era. Other examples can be found in the development of the iconography of the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Fujin" id="w">Fujin</a> Wind God,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> the <a href="/wiki/Nio" id="w">Nio</a> guardians,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> and the near-<a href="/wiki/Classical_antiquity" id="w">Classical</a> floral patterns in temple decorations.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The earliest Buddhist structures still extant in Japan, and the oldest wooden buildings in the <a href="/wiki/Far_East" id="w">Far East</a> are found at the <a href="/wiki/H%C5%8Dry%C5%AB-ji" id="w">Hōryū-ji</a> to the southwest of Nara. First built in the early 7th century as the private temple of Crown <a href="/wiki/Prince_Shotoku" id="w">Prince Shotoku</a>, it consists of 41 independent buildings. The most important ones, the main worship hall, or <i>Kondo</i> (Golden Hall), and <i>Goju-no-to</i> (Five-story <a href="/wiki/Pagoda" id="w">Pagoda</a>), stand in the center of an open area surrounded by a roofed cloister. The <i>Kondo</i>, in the style of <a href="/wiki/Buddhism_in_China" id="w">Chinese worship</a> halls, is a two-story structure of post-and-beam construction, capped by an <i><a href="/wiki/Irimoya" id="w">irimoya</a></i>, or hipped-gabled roof of ceramic tiles.</p>
<p>Inside the <i>Kondo</i>, on a large rectangular platform, are some of the most important sculptures of the period. The central image is a Shaka Trinity (<a href="/wiki/623" id="w">623</a>), the historical <a href="/wiki/Buddha" id="w">Buddha</a> flanked by two <a href="/wiki/Bodhisattva" id="w">bodhisattvas</a>, sculpture cast in bronze by the sculptor <a href="/wiki/Tori_Busshi" id="w">Tori Busshi</a> (flourished early 7th century) in homage to the recently deceased Prince Shotoku. At the four corners of the platform are the <a href="/wiki/Four_Heavenly_Kings" id="w">Guardian Kings of the Four Directions</a>, carved in wood around <a href="/wiki/650" id="w">650</a>. Also housed at <a href="/wiki/H%C5%8Dry%C5%AB-ji" id="w">Hōryū-ji</a> is the <a href="/wiki/Tamamushi_Shrine" id="w">Tamamushi Shrine</a>, a wooden replica of a <i>Kondo</i>, which is set on a high wooden base that is decorated with figural paintings executed in a medium of mineral pigments mixed with lacquer.</p>
<p>Temple building in the 8th century was focused around the <a href="/wiki/T%C5%8Ddai-ji" id="w">Tōdai-ji</a> in Nara. Constructed as the headquarters for a network of temples in each of the provinces, the Tōdaiji is the most ambitious religious complex erected in the early centuries of Buddhist worship in Japan. Appropriately, the 16.2-m (53-ft) Buddha (completed <a href="/wiki/752" id="w">752</a>) enshrined in the main Buddha hall, or <i><a href="/wiki/Daibutsuden" id="w">Daibutsuden</a></i>, is a <a href="/wiki/Rushana_Buddha" id="w">Rushana Buddha</a>, the figure that represents the essence of Buddhahood, just as the Tōdaiji represented the center for Imperially sponsored Buddhism and its dissemination throughout Japan. Only a few fragments of the original statue survive, and the present hall and central Buddha are reconstructions from the <a href="/wiki/Edo_period" id="w">Edo period</a>.</p>
<p>Clustered around the Daibutsuden on a gently sloping hillside are a number of secondary halls: the <i><a href="/wiki/Hokkedo" id="w">Hokkedo</a></i> (Lotus Sutra Hall), with its principal image, the <a href="/wiki/Fukukenjaku_Kannon" id="w">Fukukenjaku</a> <a href="/wiki/Kannon" id="w">Kannon</a> (the most popular bodhisattva), crafted of dry lacquer (cloth dipped in lacquer and shaped over a wooden armature); the <i><a href="/wiki/Kaidanin" id="w">Kaidanin</a></i> (Ordination Hall) with its magnificent clay statues of the <a href="/wiki/Four_Heavenly_Kings" id="w">Four Guardian Kings</a>; and the storehouse, called the <i><a href="/wiki/Shosoin" id="w">Shosoin</a></i>. This last structure is of great importance as an art-historical cache, because in it are stored the utensils that were used in the temple&#39;s dedication ceremony in 752, the eye-opening ritual for the Rushana image, as well as government documents and many secular objects owned by the Imperial family.</p>

In <a href="/wiki/794" id="w">794</a> the capital of Japan was officially transferred to Heian-kyo (present-day <a href="/wiki/Kyoto" id="w">Kyoto</a>), where it remained until <a href="/wiki/1868" id="w">1868</a>. The term <i><a href="/wiki/Heian_Period" id="w">Heian period</a></i> refers to the years between <a href="/wiki/794" id="w">794</a> and <a href="/wiki/1185" id="w">1185</a>, when the <a href="/wiki/Kamakura_shogunate" id="w">Kamakura shogunate</a> was established at the end of the <a href="/wiki/Genpei_War" id="w">Genpei War</a>. The period is further divided into the early Heian and the late Heian, or <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_clan" id="w">Fujiwara era</a>, the pivotal date being <a href="/wiki/894" id="w">894</a>, the year <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_embassies_to_China" id="w">imperial embassies to China</a> were officially discontinued.</p>
<p><b>Early Heian art:</b> In reaction to the growing wealth and power of organized <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" id="w">Buddhism</a> in Nara, the priest <a href="/wiki/K%C5%ABkai" id="w">Kūkai</a> (best known by his posthumous title Kōbō Daishi, <a href="/wiki/774" id="w">774</a>-<a href="/wiki/835" id="w">835</a>) journeyed to China to study <a href="/wiki/Shingon_Buddhism" id="w">Shingon</a>, a form of <a href="/wiki/Vajrayana" id="w">Vajrayana</a> Buddhism, which he introduced into Japan in <a href="/wiki/806" id="w">806</a>. At the core of Shingon worship are <a href="/wiki/Mandala" id="w">mandalas</a>, diagrams of the spiritual universe, which then began to influence temple design. Japanese Buddhist architecture also adopted the <a href="/wiki/Stupa" id="w">stupa</a>, originally an <a href="/wiki/Indian_architecture" id="w">Indian architectural form</a>, in its Chinese-style pagoda.</p>
<p>The temples erected for this new sect were built in the mountains, far away from the Court and the laity in the capital. The irregular topography of these sites forced Japanese architects to rethink the problems of temple construction, and in so doing to choose more indigenous elements of design. Cypress-bark roofs replaced those of ceramic tile, wood planks were used instead of earthen floors, and a separate worship area for the laity was added in front of the main sanctuary.</p>
<p>The temple that best reflects the spirit of early Heian Shingon temples is the <a href="/wiki/Muro-ji" id="w">Muro-ji</a> (early 9th century), set deep in a stand of cypress trees on a mountain southeast of Nara. The wooden image (also early 9th c.) of <a href="/wiki/Gautama_Buddha" id="w">Shakyamuni</a>, the &#34;historic&#34; Buddha, enshrined in a secondary building at the Muro-ji, is typical of the early Heian sculpture, with its ponderous body, covered by thick drapery folds carved in the <i><a href="/wiki/Hompa-shiki" id="w">hompa-shiki</a></i> (rolling-wave) style, and its austere, withdrawn facial expression.</p>
<p><b>Fujiwara art:</b> In the <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_clan" id="w">Fujiwara period</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pure_Land" id="w">Pure Land Buddhism</a>, which offered easy salvation through belief in <a href="/wiki/Amitabha" id="w">Amida</a> (the Buddha of the Western Paradise), became popular. This period is named after the <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_family" id="w">Fujiwara family</a>, then the most powerful in the country, who ruled as <a href="/wiki/Sessho_and_Kampaku" id="w">regents</a> for the Emperor, becoming, in effect, civil dictators. Concurrently, the Kyoto nobility developed a society devoted to elegant aesthetic pursuits. So secure and beautiful was their world that they could not conceive of Paradise as being much different. They created a new form of Buddha hall, the Amida hall, which blends the secular with the religious, and houses one or more Buddha images within a structure resembling the mansions of the nobility.</p>
<p>The <i>Ho-o-do</i> (Phoenix Hall, completed 1053) of the <a href="/wiki/Byodoin" id="w">Byodoin</a>, a temple in <a href="/wiki/Uji" id="w">Uji</a> to the southeast of Kyoto, is the exemplar of Fujiwara Amida halls. It consists of a main rectangular structure flanked by two L-shaped wing corridors and a tail corridor, set at the edge of a large artificial pond. Inside, a single golden image of Amida (c. <a href="/wiki/1053" id="w">1053</a>) is installed on a high platform. The Amida sculpture was executed by <a href="/wiki/Jocho" id="w">Jocho</a>, who used a new canon of proportions and a new technique (<i><a href="/wiki/Yosegi" id="w">yosegi</a></i>), in which multiple pieces of wood are carved out like shells and joined from the inside. Applied to the walls of the hall are small relief carvings of celestials, the host believed to have accompanied Amida when he descended from the Western Paradise to gather the souls of believers at the moment of death and transport them in lotus blossoms to Paradise. <i><a href="/wiki/Raigo" id="w">Raigo</a></i> paintings on the wooden doors of the Ho-o-do, depicting the Descent of the Amida Buddha, are an early example of <a href="/wiki/Yamato-e" id="w">Yamato-e</a>, Japanese-style painting, and contain representations of the scenery around Kyoto.</p>
<p><b>E-maki:</b> In the last century of the Heian period, the horizontal, illustrated narrative handscroll, the <a href="/wiki/Emaki" id="w">e-maki</a>, came to the fore. Dating from about <a href="/wiki/1130" id="w">1130</a>, the illustrated &#39;<a href="/wiki/Tale_of_Genji" id="w">Tale of Genji</a>&#39; represents one of the high points of Japanese painting. Written about the year <a href="/wiki/1000" id="w">1000</a> by <a href="/wiki/Murasaki_Shikibu" id="w">Murasaki Shikibu</a>, a lady-in-waiting to the Empress <a href="/wiki/Akiko" id="w">Akiko</a>, the novel deals with the life and loves of Prince Genji and the world of the Heian court after his death. The 12th-century artists of the <i>e-maki</i> version devised a system of pictorial conventions that convey visually the emotional content of each scene. In the second half of the century, a different, livelier style of continuous narrative illustration became popular. The <i><a href="/wiki/Ban_Dainagon_Ekotoba" id="w">Ban Dainagon Ekotoba</a></i> (late 12th century), a scroll that deals with an intrigue at court, emphasizes figures in active motion depicted in rapidly executed brush strokes and thin but vibrant colors.</p>
<p><i>E-maki</i> also serve as some of the earliest and greatest examples of the <i><a href="/wiki/Otoko-e" id="w">otoko-e</a></i> (Men&#39;s pictures) and <i><a href="/wiki/Onna-e" id="w">onna-e</a></i> (Women&#39;s pictures) styles of painting. There are many fine differences in the two styles, appealing to the aesthetic preferences of the genders. But perhaps most easily noticeable are the differences in subject matter. <i>Onna-e</i>, epitomized by the Tale of Genji handscroll, typically deals with court life, particularly the court ladies, and with romantic themes. <i>Otoko-e</i>, on the other hand, often recorded historical events, particularly battles. The <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Sanj%C5%8D_Palace" id="w">Siege of the Sanjō Palace</a> (<a href="/wiki/1160" id="w">1160</a>), depicted in the painting &#34;Night Attack on the Sanjō Palace&#34; is a famous example of this style.</p>

In <a href="/wiki/1180" id="w">1180</a> a war broke out between the two most powerful warrior clans, the <a href="/wiki/Taira" id="w">Taira</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Minamoto" id="w">Minamoto</a>; five years later the Minamoto emerged victorious and established a de facto seat of government at the seaside village of <a href="/wiki/Kamakura%2C_Kanagawa" id="w">Kamakura</a>, where it remained until <a href="/wiki/1333" id="w">1333</a>. With the shift of power from the nobility to the warrior class, the arts had to satisfy a new audience: men devoted to the skills of warfare, priests committed to making Buddhism available to illiterate commoners, and conservatives, the nobility and some members of the priesthood who regretted the declining power of the court. Thus, realism, a popularizing trend, and a classical revival characterize the art of the <a href="/wiki/Kamakura_period" id="w">Kamakura period</a>.</p>
<p><b>Sculpture:</b> The <a href="/wiki/Kei_school" id="w">Kei school</a> of sculptors, particularly <a href="/wiki/Unkei" id="w">Unkei</a>, created a new, more realistic style of sculpture. The two <a href="/wiki/Nio" id="w">Niō</a> guardian images (<a href="/wiki/1203" id="w">1203</a>) in the Great South Gate of the <a href="/wiki/T%C5%8Ddai-ji" id="w">Tōdai-ji</a> in Nara illustrate Unkei&#39;s dynamic suprarealistic style. The images, about 8 m (about 26 ft) tall, were carved of multiple blocks in a period of about three months, a feat indicative of a developed studio system of artisans working under the direction of a master sculptor. Unkei&#39;s polychromed wood sculptures (<a href="/wiki/1208" id="w">1208</a>, <a href="/wiki/K%C5%8Dfuku-ji" id="w">Kōfuku-ji</a>, Nara) of two Indian sages, <a href="/wiki/Muchaku" id="w">Muchaku</a> and <a href="/wiki/Seshin" id="w">Seshin</a>, the legendary founders of the <a href="/wiki/Dharma_character_school" id="w">Hosso sect</a>, are among the most accomplished realistic works of the period; as rendered by Unkei, they are remarkably individualized and believable images.</p>
<p><b>Calligraphy and painting:</b> The <i><a href="/wiki/Kegon_Engi_Emaki" id="w">Kegon Engi Emaki</a></i>, the illustrated history of the founding of the <a href="/wiki/Kegon" id="w">Kegon</a> sect, is an excellent example of the popularizing trend in Kamakura painting. The Kegon sect, one of the most important in the Nara period, fell on hard times during the ascendancy of the <a href="/wiki/Pure_Land" id="w">Pure Land</a> sects. After the <a href="/wiki/Genpei_War" id="w">Genpei War</a> (<a href="/wiki/1180" id="w">1180</a>-<a href="/wiki/1185" id="w">1185</a>), Priest <a href="/wiki/My%C5%8De" id="w">Myōe</a> of <a href="/wiki/K%C5%8Dzan-ji" id="w">Kōzan-ji temple</a> sought to revive the sect and also to provide a refuge for women widowed by the war. The wives of samurai had been discouraged from learning more than a <a href="/wiki/Syllabary" id="w">syllabary</a> system for transcribing sounds and ideas (see <a href="/wiki/Kana" id="w">kana</a>), and most were incapable of reading texts that employed Chinese ideographs (<a href="/wiki/Kanji" id="w">kanji</a>). Thus, the <i><a href="/wiki/Kegon_Engi_Emaki" id="w">Kegon Engi Emaki</a></i> combines passages of text, written with a maximum of easily readable syllables, and illustrations that have the dialogue between characters written next to the speakers, a technique comparable to contemporary comic strips. The plot of the <i>e-maki</i>, the lives of the two Korean priests who founded the Kegon sect, is swiftly paced and filled with fantastic feats such as a journey to the palace of the Ocean King, and a poignant love story.</p>
<p>A work in a more conservative vein is the illustrated version of <a href="/wiki/The_Murasaki_Shikibu_Diary" id="w">Murasaki Shikibu&#39;s diary</a>. <i>E-maki</i> versions of her novel continued to be produced, but the nobility, attuned to the new interest in realism yet nostalgic for past days of wealth and power, revived and illustrated the diary in order to recapture the splendor of the author&#39;s times. One of the most beautiful passages illustrates the episode in which Murasaki Shikibu is playfully held prisoner in her room by two young courtiers, while, just outside, moonlight gleams on the mossy banks of a rivulet in the imperial garden.</p>

During the <a href="/wiki/Muromachi_period" id="w">Muromachi period</a> (<a href="/wiki/1338" id="w">1338</a>-<a href="/wiki/1573" id="w">1573</a>), also called the Ashikaga period, a profound change took place in Japanese culture. The <a href="/wiki/Ashikaga_clan" id="w">Ashikaga clan</a> took control of the shogunate and moved its headquarters back to Kyoto, to the <a href="/wiki/Muromachi_district" id="w">Muromachi district</a> of the city. With the return of government to the capital, the popularizing trends of the Kamakura period came to an end, and cultural expression took on a more aristocratic, elitist character. <a href="/wiki/Zen" id="w">Zen</a> Buddhism, the <a href="/wiki/Ch%26%2339%3Ban" id="w">Ch&#39;an</a> sect　traditionally thought to have been founded in China in the 6th century CE, was introduced for a second time into Japan and took root.</p>
<p><b>Painting:</b> Because of secular ventures and trading missions to China organized by Zen temples, many Chinese paintings and objects of art were imported into Japan and profoundly influenced Japanese artists working for Zen temples and the shogunate. Not only did these imports change the subject matter of painting, but they also modified the use of color; the bright colors of Yamato-e yielded to the <a href="/wiki/Sumi-e" id="w">monochromes</a> of painting in the Chinese manner, where paintings generally only have black and white or different tones of a single color. </p>
<p>Typical of early Muromachi painting is the depiction by the priest-painter <a href="/wiki/Kao_(painter)" id="w">Kao</a> (active early 15th century) of the legendary monk <a href="/wiki/Kensu" id="w">Kensu</a> (Hsien-tzu in Chinese) at the moment he achieved enlightenment. This type of painting was executed with quick brush strokes and a minimum of detail. &#39;Catching a Catfish with a Gourd&#39; (early 15th century, <a href="/wiki/Taizo-in" id="w">Taizo-in</a>, <a href="/wiki/Myoshin-ji" id="w">Myoshin-ji</a>, Kyoto), by the priest-painter <a href="/wiki/Josetsu" id="w">Josetsu</a> (active c. 1400), marks a turning point in Muromachi painting. Executed originally for a low-standing screen, it has been remounted as a hanging scroll with inscriptions by contemporary figures above, one of which refers to the painting as being in the &#34;new style.&#34; In the foreground a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background mountains appear to be far in the distance. It is generally assumed that the &#34;new style&#34; of the painting, executed about <a href="/wiki/1413" id="w">1413</a>, refers to a more Chinese sense of deep space within the picture plane.</p>
<p>The foremost artists of the Muromachi period are the priest-painters <a href="/wiki/Shubun" id="w">Shubun</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sesshu" id="w">Sesshu</a>. Shubun, a monk at the Kyoto temple of <a href="/wiki/Shokoku-ji" id="w">Shokoku-ji</a>, created in the painting &#39;Reading in a Bamboo Grove&#39; (<a href="/wiki/1446" id="w">1446</a>) a realistic landscape with deep recession into space. Sesshu, unlike most artists of the period, was able to journey to China and study Chinese painting at its source. &#39;The <a href="/wiki/Long_Handscroll" id="w">Long Handscroll</a>&#39; is one of Sesshu&#39;s most accomplished works, depicting a continuing landscape through the four seasons.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Azuchi-Momoyama_period" id="w">Momoyama period</a> (1573-1603), a succession of military leaders, such as <a href="/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga" id="w">Oda Nobunaga</a>, <a href="/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi" id="w">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu" id="w">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>, attempted to bring peace and political stability to Japan after an era of almost 100 years of warfare. Oda, a minor chieftain, acquired power sufficient to take <a href="/wiki/De_facto" id="w">de facto</a> control of the government in <a href="/wiki/1568" id="w">1568</a> and, five years later, to oust the last Ashikaga shogun. Hideyoshi took command after Oda&#39;s death, but his plans to establish hereditary rule were foiled by Ieyasu, who established the <a href="/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate" id="w">Tokugawa shogunate</a> in <a href="/wiki/1603" id="w">1603</a>.</p>
<p><b>Painting:</b> The most important school of painting in the Momoyama period was that of the <a href="/wiki/Kan%C5%8D_school" id="w">Kanō school</a>, and the greatest innovation of the period was the formula, developed by <a href="/wiki/Kano_Eitoku" id="w">Kano Eitoku</a>, for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. The decoration of the main room facing the garden of the <a href="/wiki/Juko-in" id="w">Juko-in</a>, a subtemple of <a href="/wiki/Daitoku-ji" id="w">Daitoku-ji</a> (a Zen temple in Kyoto), is perhaps the best extant example of Eitoku&#39;s work. A massive <i><a href="/wiki/Ume" id="w">ume</a></i> tree and twin pines are depicted on pairs of sliding screens in diagonally opposite corners, their trunks repeating the verticals of the corner posts and their branches extending to left and right, unifying the adjoining panels. Eitoku&#39;s screen, &#39;Chinese Lions&#39;, also in Kyoto, reveals the bold, brightly colored style of painting preferred by the samurai.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Hasegawa_Tohaku" id="w">Hasegawa Tohaku</a>, a contemporary of Eitoku, developed a somewhat different and more decorative style for large-scale screen paintings. In his &#39;<a href="/wiki/Maple_Screen" id="w">Maple Screen</a>&#39;, now in the temple of <a href="/wiki/Chishaku-in" id="w">Chishaku-in</a>, Kyoto, he placed the trunk of the tree in the center and extended the limbs nearly to the edge of the composition, creating a flatter, less architectonic work than Eitoku, but a visually gorgeous painting. His sixfold screen, &#39;<a href="/wiki/Pine_Wood" id="w">Pine Wood</a>&#39;, is a masterly rendering in <a href="/wiki/Sumi-e" id="w">monochrome ink</a> of a grove of trees enveloped in mist.</p>

The <a href="/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate" id="w">Tokugawa shogunate</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Edo_period" id="w">Edo period</a> gained undisputed control of the government in <a href="/wiki/1603" id="w">1603</a> with a commitment to bring peace and economic and political stability to the country; in large measure it was successful. The shogunate survived until <a href="/wiki/1867" id="w">1867</a>, when it was forced to capitulate because of its failure to deal with pressure from Western nations to open the country to foreign trade. One of the dominant themes in the Edo period was the repressive policies of the shogunate and the attempts of artists to escape these strictures. The foremost of these was the closing of the country to foreigners and the accoutrements of their cultures, and the imposition of strict codes of behavior affecting every aspect of life, the clothes one wore, the person one married, and the activities one could or should not pursue.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Edo period, however, the full impact of Tokugawa policies had not yet been felt, and some of Japan&#39;s finest expressions in architecture and painting were produced: Katsura Palace in Kyoto and the paintings of <a href="/wiki/Tawaraya_S%C5%8Dtatsu" id="w">Tawaraya Sōtatsu</a>, pioneer of the <a href="/wiki/Rimpa" id="w">Rimpa</a> school.</p>
<p><b>Architecture:</b> <a href="/wiki/Katsura_Detached_Palace" id="w">Katsura Detached Palace</a>, built in imitation of <a href="/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji" id="w">Prince Genji</a>&#39;s palace, contains a cluster of shoin buildings that combine elements of classic Japanese architecture with innovative restatements. The whole complex is surrounded by a beautiful garden with paths for walking. </p>
<p><b>Painting:</b> Sōtatsu evolved a superb decorative style by re-creating themes from classical literature, using brilliantly colored figures and motifs from the natural world set against gold-leaf backgrounds. One of his finest works is the pair of screens The Waves at Matsushima in the <a href="/wiki/Freer_Gallery" id="w">Freer Gallery</a> in Washington, D.C. A century later, Korin reworked Sōtatsu&#39;s style and created visually gorgeous works uniquely his own. Perhaps his finest are the screen paintings of red and white ume blossoms.</p>
<p><b>Sculpture</b> The Buddhist monk <a href="/wiki/Enk%C5%AB" id="w">Enkū</a> carved 120,000 Buddhist images in a rough, individual style.</p>
<p><b>Woodblock prints and Bunjinga:</b> The school of art best known in the West is that of the <a href="/wiki/Ukiyo-e" id="w">ukiyo-e</a> paintings and <a href="/wiki/Woodblock_printing" id="w">woodblock prints</a> of the demimonde, the world of the <a href="/wiki/Kabuki" id="w">kabuki</a> theater and the brothel district. Ukiyo-e prints began to be produced in the late 17th century, but in 1764 Harunobu produced the first polychrome print. Print designers of the next generation, including <a href="/wiki/Torii_Kiyonaga" id="w">Torii Kiyonaga</a> and <a href="/wiki/Utamaro" id="w">Utamaro</a>, created elegant and sometimes insightful depictions of courtesans.
In the West, erotic woodblock &#34;prints&#34; became popular because the material was not otherwise available. In that sense, such niche prints did more to promote Japanese art in the West than art studies.</p>
<p>In the 19th century the dominant figure was <a href="/wiki/Hiroshige" id="w">Hiroshige</a>, a creator of romantic and somewhat sentimental landscape prints. The odd angles and shapes through which Hiroshige often viewed landscape, and the work of Kiyonaga and Utamaro, with its emphasis on flat planes and strong linear outlines, had a profound impact on such Western artists as <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Degas" id="w">Edgar Degas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh" id="w">Vincent van Gogh</a>.</p>
<p>Another school of painting contemporary with ukiyo-e was <a href="/wiki/Bunjinga" id="w">Bunjinga</a>, a style based on paintings executed by Chinese scholar-painters. Just as ukiyo-e artists chose to depict figures from life outside the strictures of the Tokugawa shogunate, Bunjin artists turned to Chinese culture. The exemplars of this style are <a href="/wiki/Ike_no_Taiga" id="w">Ike no Taiga</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yosa_Buson" id="w">Yosa Buson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tanomura_Chikuden" id="w">Tanomura Chikuden</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Yamamoto_Baiitsu" id="w">Yamamoto Baiitsu</a>.</p>
<a id="Meiji_art" name="Meiji_art"></a><h2>Meiji art</h2>

<p>In the years after <a href="/wiki/1867" id="w">1867</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Meiji_Emperor" id="w">Emperor Meiji</a> ascended the throne, Japan was once again invaded by new and alien forms of culture. The introduction of Western cultural values led to a dichotomy in Japanese art, as well as in nearly every other aspect of culture, between traditional values and attempts to duplicate and assimilate a variety of clashing new ideas. This split remained evident in the late twentieth century, although much synthesis had by then already occurred, and created an international cultural atmosphere and stimulated contemporary Japanese arts toward ever more innovative forms.</p>
<p>By the early 20th century, European art forms were well introduced and their marriage produced notable buildings like the <a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Station" id="w">Tokyo Train Station</a> and the <a href="/wiki/National_Diet_Building" id="w">National Diet Building</a> that still exist today.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Manga" id="w">Manga</a> were first drawn in the Meiji period, influenced greatly by English and French <a href="/wiki/Editorial_cartoon" id="w">political cartoons</a>. </p>
<p><b>Painting</b>: The first response of the Japanese to Western art forms was open-hearted acceptance, and in <a href="/wiki/1876" id="w">1876</a> the <a href="/wiki/Technological_Art_School" id="w">Technological Art School</a> was opened, employing Italian instructors to teach Western methods. The second response was a pendulum swing in the opposite direction spearheaded by <a href="/wiki/Okakura_Kakuzo" id="w">Okakura Kakuzo</a> and the American <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Fenollosa" id="w">Ernest Fenollosa</a>, who encouraged Japanese artists to retain traditional themes and techniques while creating works more in keeping with contemporary taste. Out of these two poles of artistic theory developed <a href="/wiki/Yoga_(Painting_style)" id="w">Yōga</a> (Western-style painting) and <a href="/wiki/Nihonga" id="w">Nihonga</a> (Japanese painting), categories that remain valid to the present day.</p>
<a id="Postwar_period" name="Postwar_period"></a><h2>Postwar period</h2>

<p>After <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, many artists began working in art forms derived from the international scene, moving away from local artistic developments into the mainstream of world art. But traditional Japanese conceptions endured, particularly in the use of modular space in architecture, certain spacing intervals in music and dance, a propensity for certain color combinations and characteristic literary forms. The wide variety of art forms available to the Japanese reflect the vigorous state of the arts, widely supported by the Japanese people and promoted by the government.</p>
<p>American art and architecture greatly influenced Japan.  Though fear of earthquakes severely restricted the building of a skyscraper, technological advances let Japanese build larger and higher buildings with more artistic outlooks.  </p>
<p>As Japan has always made little distinction between &#39;fine art&#39; and &#39;decorative art&#39;, as the West is first beginning to do, it is important to note Japan&#39;s significant and unique contributions to the fields of art in entertainment, commercial uses, and graphic design. Cartoons imported from America led to <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a> that at first were derived exclusively from manga stories. Today, anime abounds, and many artists and studios have risen to great fame as artists; <a href="/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki" id="w">Hayao Miyazaki</a> and the artists and animators of <a href="/wiki/Studio_Ghibli" id="w">Studio Ghibli</a> are generally regarded to be among the best the anime world has to offer. Japan also flourishes in the fields of <a href="/wiki/Japanese_graphic_design" id="w">graphic design</a>, commercial art (e.g. billboards, magazine advertisements), and in video game graphics and concept art.</p>
<a id="Modern_art_in_Japan" name="Modern_art_in_Japan"></a><h2>Modern art in Japan</h2>

<p>Japanese modern art takes as many forms and expresses as many different ideas as modern art in general, worldwide. It ranges from advertisements, anime, video games, and architecture as already mentioned, to sculpture, painting, and drawing in all their myriad forms.  </p>
<p>Many artists do continue to paint in the traditional manner, with black ink and color on paper or silk. Some of these depict traditional subject matter in the traditional styles, while others explore new and different motifs and styles, while using the traditional media. Still others eschew native media and styles, embracing Western oil paints or any number of other forms.</p>
<p>In sculpture, the same holds true; some artists stick to the traditional modes, some doing it with a modern flair, and some choose Western or brand new modes, styles, and media.  <a href="/wiki/Yo_Akiyama" id="w">Yo Akiyama</a> is just one of countless modern Japanese sculptors. He works primarily in clay pottery and ceramics, creating works that are very simple and straightforward, looking like they were created out of the earth itself. Another sculptor, using iron and other modern materials, built a large modern art sculpture in the <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israeli</a> port city of <a href="/wiki/Haifa" id="w">Haifa</a>, called <i>Hanabi</i> (Fireworks).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Takashi_Murakami" id="w">Takashi Murakami</a> is arguably one of the most well-known Japanese modern artists in the Western world. Murakami and the other artists in his studio create pieces in a style, inspired by anime, which he has dubbed &#34;<a href="/wiki/Superflat" id="w">superflat</a>&#34;. His pieces take a multitude of forms, from painting to sculpture, some truly massive in size. But most if not all show very clearly this anime influence, utilizing bright colors and simplified details.</p>

A remarkable number of the traditional forms of Japanese music, dance, and theater have survived in the contemporary world, enjoying some popularity through reidentification with Japanese cultural values. Traditional music and dance, which trace their origins to ancient religious use - <a href="/wiki/Buddhism_in_Japan" id="w">Buddhist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shinto" id="w">Shintō</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Folk_dance" id="w">folk</a> - have been preserved in the dramatic performances of <a href="/wiki/Noh" id="w">Noh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kabuki" id="w">Kabuki</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bunraku" id="w">bunraku</a> theater. Ancient court music and dance forms deriving from continental sources were preserved through Imperial household musicians and temple and shrine troupes. Some of the oldest musical instruments in the world have been in continuous use in Japan from the <a href="/wiki/J%C5%8Dmon_period" id="w">Jōmon period</a>, as shown by finds of stone and clay <a href="/wiki/Flute" id="w">flutes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zither" id="w">zithers</a> having between two and four strings, to which <a href="/wiki/Yayoi_period" id="w">Yayoi period</a> metal <a href="/wiki/Bell_(instrument)" id="w">bells</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gong" id="w">gongs</a> were added to create early musical ensembles. By the early historical period (sixth to seventh centuries CE), there were a variety of large and small <a href="/wiki/Drum" id="w">drums</a>, gongs, <a href="/wiki/Tubular_bell" id="w">chimes</a>, flutes, and stringed instruments, such as the imported mandolin-like <a href="/wiki/Biwa" id="w">biwa</a> and the flat six-stringed zither, which evolved into the thirteen-stringed <a href="/wiki/Koto_(musical_instrument)" id="w">koto</a>. These instruments formed the orchestras for the seventh-century continentally derived ceremonial court music (<a href="/wiki/Gagaku" id="w">gagaku</a>), which, together with the accompanying <a href="/wiki/Bugaku" id="w">bugaku</a> (a type of court dance), are the most ancient of such forms still performed at the Imperial court, ancient temples, and shrines. <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" id="w">Buddhism</a> introduced the rhythmic chants, still used, that underpin <a href="/wiki/Shigin" id="w">Shigin</a>, and that were joined with native ideas to underlay the development of vocal music, such as in <a href="/wiki/Noh" id="w">Noh</a>.</p>

<p>Japanese art is characterized by unique polarities. In the ceramics of the prehistoric periods, for example, exuberance was followed by disciplined and refined artistry. Another instance is provided by two 16th-century structures that are poles apart: the <a href="/wiki/Katsura_Detached_Palace" id="w">Katsura Detached Palace</a> is an exercise in simplicity, with an emphasis on natural materials, rough and untrimmed, and an affinity for beauty achieved by accident; <a href="/wiki/Nikk%C5%8D%2C_Tochigi" id="w">Nikkō</a> <a href="/wiki/Nikk%C5%8D_T%C5%8Dsh%C5%8D-g%C5%AB" id="w">Tōshō-gū</a> is a rigidly symmetrical structure replete with brightly colored relief carvings covering every visible surface. Japanese art, valued not only for its simplicity but also for its colorful exuberance, has considerably influenced 19th-century Western painting and <a href="/wiki/Architectural_history#Modern architecture and beyond" id="w">20th century Western architecture</a>.</p>
<p>Japan&#39;s aesthetic conceptions, deriving from diverse cultural traditions, have been formative in the production of unique art forms. Over the centuries, a wide range of artistic motifs developed and were refined, becoming imbued with symbolic significance. Like a <a href="/wiki/Pearl" id="w">pearl</a>, they acquired many layers of meaning and a high luster. Japanese aesthetics provide a key to understanding artistic works perceivably different from those coming from Western traditions.</p>
<p>Within the East Asian artistic tradition, <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> has been the acknowledged teacher and Japan the devoted student. Nevertheless, several Japanese arts developed their own style, which can be differentiated from various Chinese arts. The monumental, symmetrically balanced, rational approach of Chinese art forms became miniaturized, irregular, and subtly suggestive in Japanese hands. Miniature <a href="/wiki/Zen_garden" id="w">rock gardens</a>, diminutive plants (<i><a href="/wiki/Bonsai" id="w">bonsai</a></i>), and <i><a href="/wiki/Ikebana" id="w">ikebana</a></i> (flower arrangements), in which the selected few represented a garden, were the favorite pursuits of refined aristocrats for a millennium, and they have remained a part of contemporary cultural life.</p>
<p>The diagonal, reflecting a natural flow, rather than the fixed triangle, became the favored structural device, whether in painting, architectural or garden design, dance steps, or musical notations. Odd numbers replace even numbers in the regularity of a Chinese master pattern, and a pull to one side allows a motif to turn the corner of a three-dimensional object, thus giving continuity and motion that is lacking in a static frontal design. Japanese painters used the devices of the cutoff, close-up, and fade-out by the twelfth century in <i><a href="/wiki/Yamato-e" id="w">yamato-e</a></i>, or Japanese-style, scroll painting, perhaps one reason why modern filmmaking has been such a natural and successful art form in Japan. Suggestion is used rather than direct statement; oblique poetic hints and allusive and inconclusive melodies and thoughts have proved frustrating to the Westerner trying to penetrate the meanings of literature, music, painting, and even everyday language. </p>
<p>The Japanese began defining such aesthetic ideas in a number of evocative phrases by at least the tenth or eleventh century. The courtly refinements of the aristocratic Heian period evolved into the elegant simplicity seen as the essence of good taste in the understated art that is called <i><a href="/wiki/Shibui" id="w">shibui</a></i>. Two terms originating from <a href="/wiki/Zen" id="w">Zen</a> Buddhist meditative practices describe degrees of tranquility: one, the repose found in humble melancholy (<i><a href="/wiki/Wabi-sabi" id="w">wabi</a></i>), the other, the serenity accompanying the enjoyment of subdued beauty (<i><a href="/wiki/Wabi-sabi" id="w">sabi</a></i>). Zen thought also contributed a penchant for combining the unexpected or startling, used to jolt one&#39;s consciousness toward the goal of enlightenment. In art, this approach was expressed in combinations of such unlikely materials as lead inlaid in lacquer and in clashing poetic imagery. Unexpectedly humorous and sometimes grotesque images and motifs also stem from the Zen <i><a href="/wiki/Koan" id="w">koan</a></i> (conundrum). Although the arts have been mainly secular since the <a href="/wiki/Tokugawa_period" id="w">Tokugawa period</a>, traditional aesthetics and training methods, stemming generally from religious sources, continue to underlie artistic productions.</p>
<a id="Artists" name="Artists"></a><h1>Artists</h1>

<p>Traditionally, the artist was a vehicle for expression and was personally reticent, in keeping with the role of an artisan or entertainer of low social status. The <a href="/wiki/Shodo" id="w">calligrapher</a>, a member of the <a href="/wiki/Confucianism" id="w">Confucian</a> literati class, or noble <a href="/wiki/Samurai" id="w">samurai</a> class in Japan, had a higher status, while artists of great genius were often recognized in the <a href="/wiki/Kamakura_period" id="w">Kamakura period</a> by receiving a name from a feudal lord and thus rising socially. The performing arts, however, were generally held in less esteem, and the purported immorality of actresses of the early <a href="/wiki/Kabuki" id="w">Kabuki</a> theater caused the <a href="/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate" id="w">Tokugawa</a> government to bar women from the stage; female roles in Kabuki and Noh thereafter were played by men.</p>
<p>After World War II, artists typically gathered in arts associations, some of which were long-established professional societies while others reflected the latest arts movement. The <a href="/wiki/Japan_Artists_League" id="w">Japan Artists League</a>, for example, was responsible for the largest number of major exhibitions, including the prestigious annual Nitten (<a href="/wiki/Japan_Art_Exhibition" id="w">Japan Art Exhibition</a>). The <a href="/wiki/P.E.N._Club" id="w">P.E.N. Club</a> of Japan (P.E.N. stands for prose, essay, and narrative), a branch of an international writers&#39; organization, was the largest of some thirty major authors&#39; associations. Actors, dancers, musicians, and other performing artists boasted their own societies, including the <a href="/wiki/Kabuki_Society" id="w">Kabuki Society</a>, organized in 1987 to maintain this art&#39;s traditional high standards, which were thought to be endangered by modern innovation. By the 1980s, however, avant-garde painters and sculptors had eschewed all groups and were &#34;unattached&#34; artists.</p>
<a id="Art_schools" name="Art_schools"></a><h2>Art schools</h2>
<p>There are a number of specialized universities for the arts in Japan, led by the national universities. The most important is the <a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Arts_University" id="w">Tokyo Arts University</a>, one of the most difficult of all national universities to enter. Another seminal center is <a href="/wiki/Tama_Arts_University_in_Tokyo" id="w">Tama Arts University in Tokyo</a>, which produced many of Japan&#39;s late twentieth- century innovative young artists. Traditional training in the arts, derived from Chinese traditional methods, remains; experts teach from their homes or head schools working within a master-pupil relationship. A pupil does not experiment with a personal style until achieving the highest level of training, or graduating from an arts school, or becoming head of a school. Many young artists have criticized this system as stifling creativity and individuality. A new generation of the <a href="/wiki/Avant-garde" id="w">avant-garde</a> has broken with this tradition, often receiving its training in the West. In the traditional arts, however, the master-pupil system preserves the secrets and skills of the past. Some master-pupil lineages can be traced to the Kamakura period, from which they continue to use a great master&#39;s style or theme. Japanese artists consider technical virtuosity as the <i><a href="/wiki/Sine_qua_non" id="w">sine qua non</a></i> of their professions, a fact recognized by the rest of the world as one of the hallmarks of Japanese art.</p>
<p>The national government has actively supported the arts through the <a href="/wiki/Agency_for_Cultural_Affairs" id="w">Agency for Cultural Affairs</a>, set up in 1968 as a special body of the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Education%2C_Culture%2C_Sports%2C_Science_and_Technology_(Japan)" id="w">Ministry of Education</a>. The agency&#39;s budget for FY 1989 rose to ￥37.8 billion after five years of budget cuts, but still represented much less than 1 percent of the general budget. The agency&#39;s Cultural Affairs Division disseminated information about the arts within Japan and internationally, and the <a href="/wiki/Cultural_Properties_Protection_Division" id="w">Cultural Properties Protection Division</a> protected the nation&#39;s cultural heritage. The Cultural Affairs Division is concerned with such areas as art and culture promotion, arts copyrights, and improvements in the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" id="w">national language</a>. It also supports both national and local arts and cultural festivals, and it funds traveling cultural events in music, theater, dance, art exhibitions, and filmmaking. Special prizes are offered to encourage young artists and established practitioners, and some grants are given each year to enable them to train abroad. The agency funds national museums of modern art in Kyoto and Tokyo and the <a href="/wiki/Museum_of_Western_Art" id="w">Museum of Western Art</a> in Tokyo, which exhibit both Japanese and international shows. The agency also supports the <a href="/wiki/Japan_Academy_of_Arts" id="w">Japan Academy of Arts</a>, which honors eminent persons of arts and letters, appointing them to membership and offering ￥3.5 million in prize money. Awards are made in the presence of the <a href="/wiki/Emperor_of_Japan" id="w">Emperor</a>, who personally bestows the highest accolade, the <a href="/wiki/Cultural_Medal" id="w">Cultural Medal</a>.</p>
<a id="Private_sponsorship_and_foundations" name="Private_sponsorship_and_foundations"></a><h2>Private sponsorship and foundations</h2>
<p>Arts patronage and promotion by the government are broadened to include a new cooperative effort with corporate Japan to provide funding beyond the tight budget of the Agency for Cultural Affairs. Many other public and private institutions participate, especially in the burgeoning field of awarding arts prizes. A growing number of large corporations join major newspapers in sponsoring exhibitions and performances and in giving yearly prizes. The most important of the many literary awards given are the venerable <a href="/wiki/Naoki_Prize" id="w">Naoki Prize</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Akutagawa_Prize" id="w">Akutagawa Prize</a>, the latter being the equivalent of the <a href="/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize" id="w">Pulitzer Prize</a> in the United States. </p><hr/>
<p>In 1989 an effort to promote cross-cultural exchange led to the establishment of a Japanese &#34;<a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize" id="w">Nobel Prize</a>&#34; for the arts, the <a href="/wiki/Premium_Imperiale" id="w">Premium Imperiale</a>, by the <a href="/wiki/Japan_Art_Association" id="w">Japan Art Association</a>. This prize of US$100,000 was funded largely by the mass media conglomerate <a href="/wiki/Fuji-Sankei" id="w">Fuji-Sankei</a> and was awarded on a worldwide selection basis.</p>
<p>A number of foundations promoting the arts arose in the 1980s, including the <a href="/wiki/Cultural_Properties_Foundation" id="w">Cultural Properties Foundation</a> set up to preserve historic sites overseas, especially along the <a href="/wiki/Silk_Road" id="w">Silk Road</a> in <a href="/wiki/Inner_Asia" id="w">Inner Asia</a> and at <a href="/wiki/Dunhuang" id="w">Dunhuang</a> in <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a>. Another international arrangement was made in 1988 with the United States <a href="/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution" id="w">Smithsonian Institution</a> for cooperative exchange of high-technology studies of Asian artifacts. The government plays a major role by funding the <a href="/wiki/Japan_Foundation" id="w">Japan Foundation</a>, which provides both institutional and individual grants, effects scholarly exchanges, awards annual prizes, supported publications and exhibitions, and sends traditional Japanese arts groups to perform abroad. The Arts Festival held for two months each fall for all the performing arts is sponsored by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. Major cities also provides substantial support for the arts; a growing number of cities in the 1980s had built large centers for the performing arts and, stimulated by government funding, were offering prizes such as the <a href="/wiki/Lafcadio_Hearn_Prize" id="w">Lafcadio Hearn Prize</a> initiated by the city of <a href="/wiki/Matsue" id="w">Matsue</a>. A number of new municipal museums were also providing about one-third more facilities in the 1980s than were previously available. In the late 1980s, <a href="/wiki/Tokyo" id="w">Tokyo</a> added more than twenty new cultural halls, notably, the large <a href="/wiki/Cultural_Village" id="w">Cultural Village</a> built by <a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Corporation" id="w">Tokyo Corporation</a> and the reconstruction of <a href="/wiki/Shakespeare" id="w">Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Globe_Theatre" id="w">Globe Theatre</a>. All these efforts reflect a rising popular enthusiasm for the arts. Japanese art buyers swept the Western art markets in the late 1980s, paying record highs for <a href="/wiki/Impressionism" id="w">impressionist</a> paintings and US$51.7 million alone for one <a href="/wiki/Blue_period" id="w">blue period</a> <a href="/wiki/Picasso" id="w">Picasso</a>.</p>
