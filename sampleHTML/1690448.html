<p><b><i>Ailanthus altissima</i></b> ({{pronEng}}<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>), commonly known as <b>tree of heaven</b>, <b>ailanthus</b>, or in Chinese as <b><i>chouchun</i></b> ({{zh-cp}}), is a <a href="/wiki/Deciduous" id="w">deciduous</a> tree in the <a href="/wiki/Quassia" id="w">quassia</a> family (<a href="/wiki/Simaroubaceae" id="w">Simaroubaceae</a>). It is native to northeast and central <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Taiwan</a>. Unlike other members of the genus <i><a href="/wiki/Ailanthus" id="w">Ailanthus</a></i>, it is found in temperate climates rather than the tropics. The tree grows rapidly and is capable of reaching heights of 15&#160;metres (50&#160;ft) in 25&#160;years. However, the species is also short lived and rarely lives more than 50&#160;years. Other common names include <b>China sumac</b>, <b>copal tree</b>, <b>stink tree</b> and <b>ghetto palm</b>.</p>
<p><i>A. altissima</i> was first brought from China to Europe in the 1740s and to the United States in 1784. It was one of the first trees brought west during a time when <i><a href="/wiki/Chinoiserie" id="w">chinoiserie</a></i> was dominating European arts, and was initially hailed as a beautiful garden specimen. However, enthusiasm soon waned after gardeners became familiar with its suckering habits and its offensive odour. Despite this, it was used extensively as a street tree during much of the 19th century. Outside of Europe and the United States, the plant has been spread to many other areas beyond its native range. In a number of these, it has become an <a href="/wiki/Invasive_species" id="w">invasive species</a> due to its ability to quickly colonise disturbed areas and suppress competition with <a href="/wiki/Allelopathy" id="w">allelopathic</a> chemicals. It is considered a noxious weed in <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a> and several countries in southern and eastern <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>. The tree also <a href="/wiki/Basal_shoot" id="w">re-sprouts</a> vigorously when cut, making its eradication extremely difficult and time consuming.</p>
<p>In China, the tree of heaven has a long and rich history. It was mentioned in the oldest extant Chinese dictionary and listed in countless Chinese medical texts for its purported ability to cure ailments ranging from mental illness to balding. The roots, leaves and bark are still used today in <a href="/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine" id="w">traditional Chinese medicine</a>, primarily as an <a href="/wiki/Astringent" id="w">astringent</a>. The tree has been grown extensively both in China and abroad as a host plant for the <a href="/wiki/Ailanthus_silkmoth" id="w">ailanthus silkmoth</a>, a moth involved in <a href="/wiki/Silk" id="w">silk</a> production. Ailanthus has become a part of western culture as well, with the tree serving as the central metaphor and subject matter of the best-selling American novel <i><a href="/wiki/A_Tree_Grows_in_Brooklyn_(novel)" id="w">A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Betty_Smith" id="w">Betty Smith</a>.</p>

<i>A. altissima</i> is a medium-sized tree that reaches heights between 17 and 27&#160;metres (56 and 90&#160;ft) with a diameter at breast height of about 1&#160;metre (40&#160;in).<sup id="_ref-USDF_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USDF" title="">[2]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Bark" id="w">bark</a> is smooth and light grey, often becoming somewhat rougher with light tan fissures as the tree ages. The twigs are stout, smooth to lightly pubescent, and reddish or chestnut in colour. They have <a href="/wiki/Lenticel" id="w">lenticels</a> as well as heart-shaped leaf scars (i.e. a scar left on the twig after a leaf falls) with many bundle scars (i.e. small marks where the veins of the leaf once connected to the tree) around the edges. The <a href="/wiki/Bud" id="w">buds</a> are finely pubescent, dome shaped, and partially hidden behind the <a href="/wiki/Petiole_(botany)" id="w">petiole</a>, though they are completely visible in the dormant season at the sinuses of the leaf scars.<sup id="_ref-harvard2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The branches are light to dark gray in colour, smooth, lustrous, and containing raised lenticels that become fissures with age. The ends of the branches become pendulous. All parts of the plant have a distinguishing strong odour that is often likened to rotting peanuts or cashews.<sup id="_ref-invasive_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-invasive" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Leaf" id="w">leaves</a> are large, odd- or even-<a href="/wiki/Pinnate" id="w">pinnately</a> compound, and arranged alternately on the stem. They range in size from 30 to 90&#160;cm (1 to 3&#160;ft) in length and contain 10-41 leaflets organised in pairs, with the largest leaves found on vigorous young sprouts. The <a href="/wiki/Rachis" id="w">rachis</a> is light to reddish-green with a swollen base. The <a href="/wiki/Leaflet" id="w">leaflets</a> are <a href="/wiki/Leaf_shape" id="w">ovate-lanceolate</a> with entire margins, somewhat asymmetric and occasionally not directly opposite to each others. Each leaflet is 5 to 18&#160;cm (2 to 7&#160;inches) long and 2.5 to 5&#160;cm (1 to 2&#160;inches) wide. They have a long tapering end while the bases have two to four teeth, each containing one or more glands at the tip.<sup id="_ref-harvard2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The leaflets&#39; upper sides are dark green in colour with light green veins, while the undersides are a more whitish green.

<a id="Taxonomy" name="Taxonomy"></a><h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>The first scientific descriptions of the tree of heaven were made shortly after it was introduced to <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> by the French <a href="/wiki/Jesuit" id="w">Jesuit</a> <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Nicholas_d%26%2339%3BIncarville" id="w">Pierre Nicholas d&#39;Incarville</a>. d&#39;Incarville had sent seeds from <a href="/wiki/Peking" id="w">Peking</a> via <a href="/wiki/Siberia" id="w">Siberia</a> to his botanist friend <a href="/wiki/Bernard_de_Jussieu" id="w">Bernard de Jussieu</a> in the 1740s. The seeds sent by d&#39;Incarville were thought to be from the economically important and similar looking <a href="/wiki/Chinese_varnish_tree" id="w">Chinese varnish tree</a> (<i>Toxicodendron vernicifluum</i>), which he had observed in the lower <a href="/wiki/Yangtze" id="w">Yangtze</a> region, rather than the tree of heaven. d&#39;Incarville attached a note indicating this, which caused much taxonomic confusion over the next few decades. In 1751, Jussieu planted a few seeds in <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> and sent others on to <a href="/wiki/Philip_Miller" id="w">Philip Miller</a>, the superintendent at the <a href="/wiki/Chelsea_Physic_Garden" id="w">Chelsea Physic Garden</a>, and to Philip C. Webb, the owner of an exotic plant garden in <a href="/wiki/Busbridge" id="w">Busbridge</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>.<sup id="_ref-harvard2_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Confusion in naming began when the tree was described by all three men with three different names. In Paris, <a href="/wiki/Linnaeus" id="w">Linnaeus</a> gave the plant the name <i>Rhus succedanea</i>, while it was known commonly as <i>grand vernis du Japon</i>. In London the specimens were named by Miller as <i>Toxicodendron altissima</i> and in Busbridge it was dubbed in the old classification system as <i>Rhus Sinese foliis alatis</i>. There are extant records from the 1750s of disputes over the proper name between Philip Miller and <a href="/wiki/John_Ellis" id="w">John Ellis</a>, curator of Webb&#39;s garden in Busbridge. Rather than the issue being resolved, more names soon appeared for the plant: <a href="/wiki/Jakob_Friedrich_Ehrhart" id="w">Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart</a> observed a specimen in <a href="/wiki/Utrecht" id="w">Utrecht</a> in 1782 and named it <i>Rhus cacodendron</i>.<sup id="_ref-harvard2_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Light was shed on the taxonomic status of ailanthus in 1788 when <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Louiche_Desfontaines" id="w">René Louiche Desfontaines</a> observed the samaras of the Paris specimens, which were still labelled <i>Rhus succedanea</i>, and came to the conclusion that the plant was not a <a href="/wiki/Sumac" id="w">sumac</a>. He published an article with an illustrated description and gave it the name <i>Ailanthus glandulosa</i>, placing it in the same genus as the tropical species then known as <i>A. integrifolia</i> (white siris, now <i><a href="/wiki/Ailanthus_triphysa" id="w">A. triphysa</a></i>). The name is derived from the <a href="/wiki/Ambonese" id="w">Ambonese</a> word <i>ailanto</i>, meaning &#34;heaven-tree&#34; or &#34;tree reaching for the sky&#34;.<sup id="_ref-harvard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-harvard2_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The specific <i>glandulosa</i> , referring to the glands on the leaves, persisted until as late as 1957, but it was ultimately made invalid as a later homonym at the species level.<sup id="_ref-harvard2_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The current species name comes from <a href="/wiki/Walter_T._Swingle" id="w">Walter T. Swingle</a> who was employed by the United States Department of Plant Industry. He decided to transfer Miller&#39;s older specific name into the genus of Desfontaines, resulting in the accepted name <i>Ailanthus altissima</i>.<sup id="_ref-Swingle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Swingle" title="">[8]</a></sup> <i>Altissima</i> is <a href="/wiki/Latin_language" id="w">Latin</a> for &#34;very tall&#34;, and refers to the sizes the tree can reach. The plant is sometimes incorrectly cited with the <a href="/wiki/Specific_epithet" id="w">specific epithet</a> in the masculine (<i>glandulosus</i> or <i>altissimus</i>), which is incorrect since botanical, like <a href="/wiki/Classical_Latin" id="w">Classical Latin</a>, treats most tree names as feminine.</p>

It can re-sprout rapidly after being cut.<sup id="_ref-USDF_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USDF" title="">[2]</a></sup> It is considered a shade-intolerant tree and cannot compete in low-light situations,<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> though it is sometimes found competing with hardwoods, but such competition rather indicates it was present at the time the stand was established.<sup id="_ref-USDF_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USDF" title="">[2]</a></sup> On the other hand, a study in an old-growth <a href="/wiki/Tsuga" id="w">hemlock</a>-hardwood forest in <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> found that Ailanthus was capable of competing successfully with native trees in canopy gaps where only 2 to 15% of full sun was available. The same study characterised the tree as using a &#34;gap-obligate&#34; strategy in order to reach the forest canopy, meaning it grows rapidly during a very short period rather than growing slowly over a long period.<sup id="_ref-bard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bard" title="">[24]</a></sup> It is a short lived tree in any location and rarely lives more than 50 years.<sup id="_ref-USDF_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-USDF" title="">[2]</a></sup> Ailanthus is among the most pollution-tolerant of tree species, including to <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" id="w">sulfur dioxide</a>, which it absorbs in its leaves. It can withstand cement dust and fumes from coal tar operations, as well as resist <a href="/wiki/Ozone" id="w">ozone</a> exposure relatively well. Furthermore, high concentrations of <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" id="w">mercury</a> have been found built up in tissues of the plant.<sup id="_ref-naturec_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-naturec" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ailanthus has been used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine drainage has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximatively that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low <a href="/wiki/Phosphorus" id="w">phosphorus</a> levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system.<sup id="_ref-naturec_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-naturec" title="">[13]</a></sup> It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes.<sup id="_ref-harvard2_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.<sup id="_ref-naturec_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-naturec" title="">[13]</a></sup>

Ailanthus produces an <a href="/wiki/Allelopathy" id="w">allelopathic chemical</a> called <a href="/wiki/Ailanthone" id="w">ailanthone</a>, which inhibits the growth of other plants.<sup id="_ref-allelo3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-allelo3" title="">[25]</a></sup> The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of <a href="/wiki/Garden_cress" id="w">garden cress</a> (<i>Lepidium sativum</i>) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, <a href="/wiki/Redroot_pigweed" id="w">redroot pigweed</a> (<i>Amaranthus retroflexus</i>), <a href="/wiki/Velvetleaf" id="w">velvetleaf</a> (<i>Abutilon theophrastii</i>), <a href="/wiki/Yellow_bristlegrass" id="w">yellow bristlegrass</a> (<i>Setaria glauca</i>), <a href="/wiki/Barnyard_grass" id="w">barnyard grass</a> (<i>Echinochloa crusgalli</i>), <a href="/wiki/Pea" id="w">pea</a> (<i>Pisum sativum</i> cv. Sugar Snap) and <a href="/wiki/Maize" id="w">maize</a> (<i>Zea mays</i> <a href="/wiki/Cultivar" id="w">cv.</a> Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings with the exception of velvetleaf, which showed some resistance.<sup id="_ref-allelo1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-allelo1" title="">[26]</a></sup> Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American <a href="/wiki/Hardwood" id="w">hardwoods</a> and 34 <a href="/wiki/Conifers" id="w">conifers</a>, with the white ash (<i><a href="/wiki/Fraxinus_americana" id="w">Fraxinus americana</a></i>) being the only plant not adversely affected.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven&#39;s own seedlings, indicating that <i>A. altissima</i> has a defence mechanism to prevent <a href="/wiki/Autotoxicity" id="w">autotoxicity</a>.<sup id="_ref-allelo3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-allelo3" title="">[25]</a></sup> Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.<sup id="_ref-allelo2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-allelo2" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>The tree of heaven is a very rapidly growing tree, possibly the fastest growing tree in North America.<sup id="_ref-feis_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-feis" title="">[29]</a></sup> Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6&#160;ft) per year for the first four years are considered normal. Shade considerably hampers growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees. Studies found that <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">Californian</a> trees grew faster than their <a href="/wiki/East_Coast" id="w">East Coast</a> counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than Chinese ones.<sup id="_ref-feis_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-feis" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Northern_Europe" id="w">northern Europe</a> the tree of heaven was not considered naturalised in cities until after the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a>. This has been attributed to the tree&#39;s ability to colonise areas of rubble of destroyed buildings where most other plants would not grow.<sup id="_ref-neophyt_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-neophyt" title="">[14]</a></sup> In addition, the warmer <a href="/wiki/Microclimate" id="w">microclimate</a> in cities offers a more suitable habitat than the surrounding rural areas. For example, one study in Germany found the tree of heaven growing in 92% of densely populated areas of <a href="/wiki/Berlin" id="w">Berlin</a>, 25% of its suburbs and only 3% of areas outside the city altogether.<sup id="_ref-neophyt_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-neophyt" title="">[14]</a></sup> In other areas of Europe this is not the case as climates are mild enough for the tree to flourish. It has colonised natural areas in <a href="/wiki/Hungary" id="w">Hungary</a>, for example, and is considered a threat to biodiversity at that country&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Aggtelek_National_Park" id="w">Aggtelek National Park</a>.<sup id="_ref-neophyt_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-neophyt" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several species of <a href="/wiki/Lepidoptera" id="w">Lepidoptera</a> utilise the leaves of ailanthus as food, including the <a href="/wiki/Indian_moon_moth" id="w">Indian moon moth</a> (<i>Actias selene</i>) and the <a href="/wiki/Grass_yellow" id="w">grass yellow</a> (<i>Eurema hecabe</i>). In North America the tree is the host plant for the <a href="/wiki/Ailanthus_webworm" id="w">ailanthus webworm</a> (<i>Atteva punctella</i>), though this <a href="/wiki/Ermine_moth" id="w">ermine moth</a> is native to <a href="/wiki/Central_America" id="w">Central</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South America</a> and originally used other members of the mostly tropical <a href="/wiki/Simaroubaceae" id="w">Simaroubaceae</a> as its hosts.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> In its native range <i>A. altissima</i> is associated with at least 32 species of <a href="/wiki/Arthropods" id="w">arthropods</a> and 13 species of <a href="/wiki/Fungi" id="w">fungi</a>.<sup id="_ref-chinainvade_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chinainvade" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Due to the tree of heaven&#39;s weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control in order to keep its populations in check. For example, the city of <a href="/wiki/Basel" id="w">Basel</a> in Switzerland has an eradication program for the tree.<sup id="_ref-neophyt_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-neophyt" title="">[14]</a></sup> It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regime is a mixture of chemical and physical control. This involves the application of foliar or basal <a href="/wiki/Herbicides" id="w">herbicides</a> in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.<sup id="_ref-control_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-control" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>

In addition to its use as an ornamental plant, the tree of heaven is also used for its wood, medicinal properties, and as a host plant to feed <a href="/wiki/Silkworm" id="w">silkworms</a> of the moth <i><a href="/wiki/Samia_cynthia" id="w">Samia cynthia</a></i>, which produces <a href="/wiki/Silk" id="w">silk</a> that is stronger and cheaper than <a href="/wiki/Mulberry" id="w">mulberry</a> silk, although with inferior gloss and texture. It is also unable to take dye. This type of silk is known as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pongee" id="w">pongee</a>&#34; or &#34;Shantung silk&#34;, the second name being derived from the <a href="/wiki/Shandong_Province" id="w">Shandong Province</a> of China where this silk is often produced. Its production is particularly well known in the <a href="/wiki/Yantai" id="w">Yantai</a> region of that province. The moth has also been introduced in the United States.<sup id="_ref-harvard2_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The pale yellow, close-grained and satiny wood of ailanthus has been used in cabinet work.<sup id="_ref-Keeler_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Keeler" title="">[33]</a></sup> It is flexible and well suited to the manufacture of kitchen <a href="/wiki/Steaming" id="w">steamers</a>, which are important in <a href="/wiki/Chinese_cuisine" id="w">Chinese cuisine</a> for cooking <a href="/wiki/Mantou" id="w">mantou</a>, pastries and rice.

Because the trees exhibit rapid growth for the first few years, the trunk has uneven texture between the inner and outer wood, which can cause the wood to twist or crack during drying. Techniques have been developed for drying the wood so as to prevent this cracking, allowing it to be commercially harvested. Although the live tree tends to have very flexible wood, the wood is quite hard once properly dried.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Cultivation" name="Cultivation"></a><h3>Cultivation</h3>
<p>Tree of heaven is a popular <a href="/wiki/Ornamental_tree" id="w">ornamental tree</a> in China and valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions.<sup id="_ref-chinainvade_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chinainvade" title="">[10]</a></sup> It was once very popular in cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odour of its blossoms and the weediness of its habit. The problem of odour was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher seed production also results.<sup id="_ref-harvard_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard" title="">[7]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Michael_Dirr" id="w">Michael Dirr</a>, a noted American horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers.

<p>Nearly every part of <i>A. altissima</i> has some application in <a href="/wiki/Chinese_traditional_medicine" id="w">Chinese traditional medicine</a>. One of the oldest recipes, recorded in a work from 732 AD, is used for treating mental illness.

<p>Another source from 684 AD, during the <a href="/wiki/Tang_dynasty" id="w">Tang dynasty</a> and recorded in <a href="/wiki/Li_Shizhen" id="w">Li Shizhen</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Compendium_of_Materia_Medica" id="w">Compendium of Materia Medica</a></i>, states that when the leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can be effectively used to treat boils, <a href="/wiki/Abscess" id="w">abscesses</a> and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, <a href="/wiki/Catalpa" id="w">catalpa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peach" id="w">peach</a> tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.<sup id="_ref-harvard2_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The dried <a href="/wiki/Bark" id="w">bark</a>, however, is still an officinal drug and is listed in the modern Chinese <a href="/wiki/Materia_medica" id="w">materia medica</a> as <i>chun bai pi</i> ({{zh-cp}}), meaning &#34;white bark of spring&#34;. Modern works treat it in detail, discussing chemical constituents, how to identify the product and its pharmaceutical uses. It is prepared by felling the tree in fall or spring, stripping the bark and then scraping off the hardest, outermost portion, which is then sun-dried, soaked in water, partially re-dried in a basket and finally cut into strips. The bark is said to have cooling and <a href="/wiki/Astringent" id="w">astringent</a> properties and is primarily used to treat <a href="/wiki/Dysentery" id="w">dysentery</a>, intestinal <a href="/wiki/Hemorrhage" id="w">hemorrhage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Menorrhagia" id="w">menorrhagia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spermatorrhea" id="w">spermatorrhea</a>.

<p>In addition to the tree of heaven&#39;s various uses, it has also been a part of Chinese culture for many centuries and has more recently attained a similar status in the west. Within the oldest extant Chinese dictionary, the <a href="/wiki/Erya" id="w">Erya</a>, written in the 3rd century BC, the tree of heaven is mentioned second among a list of trees. It was mentioned again in a <a href="/wiki/Materia_medica" id="w">materia medica</a> compiled during the <a href="/wiki/Tang_dynasty" id="w">Tang dynasty</a> in 656 AD. Each work favoured a different character, however, and there is still some debate in the Chinese botanical community as to which character should be used. The current name, <i>chouchun</i> ({{zh-cp}}), means &#34;stinking spring&#34;, and is a relatively new appellation. People living near the lower <a href="/wiki/Yellow_River" id="w">Yellow River</a> know it by the name <i>chunshu</i> ({{zh-stp}}), meaning &#34;spring tree&#34;. The name stems from the fact that <i>A. altissima</i> is one of the last trees to come out of dormancy, and as such its leaves coming out would indicate that winter was truly over.<sup id="_ref-harvard2_t" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard2" title="">[3]</a></sup>

In <a href="/wiki/Chinese_literature" id="w">Chinese literature</a>, ailanthus is often used for two rather extreme metaphors, with a mature tree representing a father and a stump being a spoiled child. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a friend&#39;s father and mother in a letter, where one can write &#34;wishing your ailanthus and <a href="/wiki/Daylily" id="w">daylily</a> are strong and happy&#34;, with ailanthus metaphorically referring to the father and daylily to the mother. Furthermore, one can scold a child by calling him a &#34;good-for-nothing ailanthus stump sprout&#34;, meaning the child is irresponsible. This derives from the literature of <a href="/wiki/Zhuangzi" id="w">Zhuangzi</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Taoist" id="w">Taoist</a> philosopher, who referred to a tree that had developed from a sprout at the stump and was thus unsuitable for carpentry due to its irregular shape. Later scholars associated this tree with ailanthus and applied the metaphor to children who, like stump sprouts of the tree, will not develop into a worthwhile human being if they don&#39;t follow rules or traditions.<sup id="_ref-harvard2_u" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvard2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
