The <b>Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry</b> was an <a href="/wiki/Infantry" id="w">infantry</a> <a href="/wiki/Regiment" id="w">regiment</a> of the <a href="/wiki/British_Army" id="w">British Army</a>.</p>
<p>It was formed in <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a> by the amalgamation of two English regiments.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/The_Gloucestershire_Regiment" id="w">The Gloucestershire Regiment</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/The_Duke_of_Edinburgh%26%2339%3Bs_Royal_Regiment" id="w">The Duke of Edinburgh&#39;s Royal Regiment (Berkshire and Wiltshire)</a></li></ul>
<p>The regiment was unique in the <a href="/wiki/British_Army" id="w">British Army</a> in that it was permitted to wear the United States <a href="/wiki/Presidential_Unit_Citation_(US)" id="w">Distinguished Unit Citation</a>, which it inherited from the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment which was awarded for their  defence of <a href="/wiki/Gloster_Hill" id="w">Gloster Hill</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Imjin_River" id="w">Battle of the Imjin River</a> in April <a href="/wiki/1951" id="w">1951</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" id="w">Korean War</a>.</p>
<p>It was also unique in being the only regiment in the British Army permitted to wear a <a href="/wiki/Cap_badge" id="w">cap badge</a> on both the front and the rear of their headdress. The back badge was awarded to the <a href="/wiki/28th_Regiment_of_Foot" id="w">28th Regiment of Foot</a> for their actions at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Alexandria" id="w">Battle of Alexandria</a> in <a href="/wiki/1801" id="w">1801</a> when the regiment fought on whilst completely surrounded by the enemy.  During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Imjin_River" id="w">Battle of the Imjin River</a>, during the Korean War, the 1st Battalion, <a href="/wiki/Gloucestershire_Regiment" id="w">Gloucestershire Regiment</a> (the Glorious Glosters), and their mortar battery — numbering perhaps 750 men in total — again fought on when surrounded on <a href="/wiki/Gloster_Hill" id="w">Gloster Hill</a> by at least one Chinese division of 10,000 men.</p>
<p>Between <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a> and <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, the 1st Battalion, Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment served as a <a href="/wiki/Public_duties" id="w">public duties</a> battalion in London, where its duties included providing the <a href="/wiki/Queen%26%2339%3Bs_Guard" id="w">Queen&#39;s Guard</a>. It was while the RGBW was on guard at <a href="/wiki/Buckingham_Palace" id="w">Buckingham Palace</a> that the <a href="/wiki/Fathers_4_Justice_Buckingham_Palace_protest#Buckingham Palace protest" id="w">Fathers 4 Justice protest</a> took place.

On <a href="/wiki/16_December" id="w">16 December</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, it was announced that the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment was to be disbanded - the Gloucestershire element, along with the <a href="/wiki/Devonshire_and_Dorset_Regiment" id="w">Devonshire and Dorset Regiment</a> was to be merged with the <a href="/wiki/The_Light_Infantry" id="w">Light Infantry</a>, while the Berkshire and Wiltshire elements would have merged with the <a href="/wiki/Princess_of_Wales%26%2339%3Bs_Royal_Regiment" id="w">Princess of Wales&#39;s Royal Regiment</a>. In March <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, it was further announced that the de-amalgamation of the regiment would not take place; instead it would merge completely with the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment as 1st Battalion, Light Infantry. In preparation for this, the regiment was moved from the <a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Wales%26%2339%3B_Division" id="w">Prince of Wales&#39; Division</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Light_Division" id="w">Light Division</a> and renamed the <b>Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry</b> in July <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>.

On <a href="/wiki/24_November" id="w">24 November</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, the MOD announced further changes to the amalgamations. The regiment would still merge with the <a href="/wiki/Devonshire_and_Dorset_Regiment" id="w">Devonshire and Dorset Regiment</a> resulting in a single battalion, however, they were now to join a new large regiment created by the alamgamation of <a href="/wiki/The_Light_Infantry" id="w">The Light Infantry</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Green_Jackets" id="w">Royal Green Jackets</a>. This new regiment was to be called <a href="/wiki/The_Rifles" id="w">The Rifles</a> and would be formed by the end of 2007. The battalion that will result from the merger of the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment and the <a href="/wiki/Devonshire_and_Dorset_Regiment" id="w">Devonshire and Dorset Regiment</a> will be designated <b>1st Battalion, <a href="/wiki/The_Rifles" id="w">The Rifles</a></b>. On becoming part of a rifle regiment, the RGBW will no longer carry its <a href="/wiki/Colours%2C_standards_and_guidons" id="w">colours</a>; the Colours of the 1st. Battalion will be laid up at <a class="externallink" href="http://www.glosters.org.uk" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.glosters.org.uk">The Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum</a>, Gloucester and the Colours of the 2nd Battalion will be laid up at the Wardrobe, Regimental Museum, Salisbury.</p>
