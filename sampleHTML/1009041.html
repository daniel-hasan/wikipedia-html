<b><i>Fight Club</i></b> is a 1999 <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Film_adaptation" id="w">feature film adaptation</a> of the 1996 novel <i><a href="/wiki/Fight_Club" id="w">Fight Club</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Chuck_Palahniuk" id="w">Chuck Palahniuk</a>, adapted by Jim Uhls and directed by <a href="/wiki/David_Fincher" id="w">David Fincher</a>.  The novel was <a href="/wiki/Option_(film)" id="w">optioned</a> by producer <a href="/wiki/Laura_Ziskin" id="w">Laura Ziskin</a>, who hired Uhls to write the script for the film.  Several directors were sought to film <i>Fight Club</i>, and David Fincher was hired to direct based on his interest in the project despite previous difficulties with the studio <a href="/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" id="w">20th Century Fox</a>.  Major actors and actresses were considered by the studio to help promote the film, and actors <a href="/wiki/Brad_Pitt" id="w">Brad Pitt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Norton" id="w">Edward Norton</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Helena_Bonham_Carter" id="w">Helena Bonham Carter</a> were ultimately cast into the lead roles.  Fincher worked with Uhls to develop the script, seeking advice from others in the film industry and his own cast members.</p>
<p>Fincher described <i>Fight Club</i> as a black comedy that applies heavy satire; he and the cast also compared the film to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Graduate" id="w">The Graduate</a></i> (1967) and <i><a href="/wiki/Rebel_Without_a_Cause" id="w">Rebel Without a Cause</a></i> (1955).  Thematically, the film was intended to represent the conflict between a generation of young people and the <a href="/wiki/Value_system" id="w">value system</a> of advertising.  The film&#39;s use of violence in the fight clubs was intended to serve as a metaphor for feeling based on the generation&#39;s conflict.   The nameless protagonist, portrayed by Edward Norton, is an <a href="/wiki/Everyman" id="w">everyman</a> and an <a href="/wiki/Unreliable_narrator" id="w">unreliable narrator</a> who becomes involved in a fight club with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and is conflicted in a relationship triangle with Durden and Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter).  The director carried <a href="/wiki/Homoeroticism" id="w">homoerotic</a> overtones over from Palahniuk&#39;s novel to implement in the film, believing that the overtones would make audiences uncomfortable and not anticipate the <a href="/wiki/Twist_ending" id="w">twist ending</a>.</p>
<p>Studio executives were not receptive to the film, and they altered Fincher&#39;s intended marketing campaign to try to recoup perceived losses.  <i>Fight Club</i> failed to meet expectations at the box office, and the film received polarized reactions from film critics.  The film was cited as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of 1999.  It was perceived as crossing a milestone for visual style in cinema and introducing a new mood in American political life.  The film later found commercial success with its DVD release, which  established <i>Fight Club</i> as a <a href="/wiki/Cult_film" id="w">cult film</a>.  The film has also permeated American society, with people inspired by the film to set up their own fight clubs.</p>
<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h1> Plot </h1>
<p>The narrator (<a href="/wiki/Edward_Norton" id="w">Edward Norton</a>) is a nameless automobile company employee who travels to accident sites to perform <a href="/wiki/Product_recall" id="w">product recall</a> cost analyses. His doctor refuses to write a prescription for his <a href="/wiki/Insomnia" id="w">insomnia</a>, instead recommending that he visit a <a href="/wiki/Support_group" id="w">support group</a> for <a href="/wiki/Testicular_cancer" id="w">testicular cancer</a> victims in order to appreciate real suffering. By attending the group, the narrator is able to sleep soundly and subsequently fakes more illnesses so he can attend other support groups. The narrator&#39;s routine is disrupted when he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer (<a href="/wiki/Helena_Bonham_Carter" id="w">Helena Bonham Carter</a>), at the groups he goes to and his insomnia returns.</p>
<p>During a flight for a business trip, the narrator meets Tyler Durden (<a href="/wiki/Brad_Pitt" id="w">Brad Pitt</a>), who is a soap salesman. The narrator arrives home to find his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. He calls Tyler and meets him at a bar, where Tyler agrees to let the narrator stay at his home on the condition that the narrator hits him. The narrator complies and the two end up enjoying a fist fight outside the bar. The narrator moves in with Tyler and the two return to the bar, where they have another fight in the car park. After attracting a crowd, they establish a &#39;fight club&#39; in the bar&#39;s basement. Soon, other fight clubs are established around the country.</p>
<p>When Marla overdoses on <a href="/wiki/Xanax" id="w">Xanax</a>, she is rescued by Tyler and the two embark upon a sexual relationship. Tyler tells the narrator never to discuss him with anyone. Under Tyler&#39;s leadership, the fight club becomes &#34;Project Mayhem,&#34; which commits increasingly destructive acts of <a href="/wiki/Anti-capitalism" id="w">anti-capitalist</a> vandalism in the city. The fight clubs become a network for Project Mayhem, and the narrator is left out of Tyler&#39;s activities with the project. After an argument, Tyler disappears from the narrator&#39;s life and when a member of Project Mayhem dies on a mission, the narrator attempts to shut down the project. Tracing Tyler&#39;s steps, he travels around the country to find that fight clubs have been started in every city, where one of the participants identifies him as Tyler Durden. A phone call to Marla confirms his identity and he realizes that Tyler is an alter ego of his own <a href="/wiki/Split_personality" id="w">split personality</a>. Tyler appears before him and explains that he controls the narrator&#39;s body whenever he is asleep.</p>
<p>The narrator faints and awakes to find Tyler has made several phone calls during his blackout and traces his plans to the <a href="/wiki/Central_business_district" id="w">downtown</a> headquarters of several major <a href="/wiki/Credit_card" id="w">credit card</a> companies, which Tyler intends to destroy in order to cripple the financial networks. Failing to find help with the police, many of whom are members of Project Mayhem, the narrator attempts to disarm the explosives in the basement of one of the buildings. He is confronted by Tyler, knocked unconscious, and taken to the upper floor of another building to witness the impending destruction. The narrator, held by Tyler at gunpoint, realizes that in sharing the same body with Tyler, he is the one who is actually holding the gun.  He fires it into his mouth, shooting through the cheek without killing himself.  The illusion of Tyler collapses with an exit wound to the back of his head.  Shortly after, members of Project Mayhem bring a kidnapped Marla to the narrator and leave them alone. The bombs detonate and, holding hands, the two witness the destruction of the city block through the windows.</p>

<a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2>Development</h2>
<p>In 1996, a <a href="/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" id="w">20th Century Fox</a> book scout sent a <a href="/wiki/Galley_proof" id="w">galley proof</a> of <a href="/wiki/Chuck_Palahniuk" id="w">Chuck Palahniuk</a>&#39;s novel <i><a href="/wiki/Fight_Club" id="w">Fight Club</a></i> to creative executive <a href="/wiki/Kevin_McCormick" id="w">Kevin McCormick</a>.  Despite a studio reader discouraging a film adaptation of the material, McCormick passed the proof on to producers <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_Bender" id="w">Lawrence Bender</a> and <a href="/wiki/Art_Linson" id="w">Art Linson</a>, who in turn also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell then expressed interest in the project and arranged unpaid screen readings with actors, initially lasting six hours, to determine the length of a script.  After cutting out sections to reduce the running time and recording the dialogue, Bell sent the book on tape to <a href="/wiki/Laura_Ziskin" id="w">Laura Ziskin</a>, head of the division <a href="/wiki/Fox_2000" id="w">Fox 2000</a>, who after listening to the tape purchased the rights to <i>Fight Club</i> for $10,000.<sup id="_ref-mav1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mav1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>To adapt the story into a screenplay, Ziskin initially considered hiring <a href="/wiki/Buck_Henry" id="w">Buck Henry</a>; Ziskin thought that <i>Fight Club</i> was similar to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Graduate" id="w">The Graduate</a></i>, which had been adapted by Henry.  However, a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, began lobbying Donen and Bell to be hired to adapt the screenplay and was subsequently chosen by the producers over Henry.  For directing, Bell had four options in mind: <a href="/wiki/Peter_Jackson" id="w">Peter Jackson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bryan_Singer" id="w">Bryan Singer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Danny_Boyle" id="w">Danny Boyle</a>, and <a href="/wiki/David_Fincher" id="w">David Fincher</a>.  Bell considered Jackson the best choice and contacted the director, but Jackson was too busy filming <i><a href="/wiki/The_Frighteners" id="w">The Frighteners</a></i> (1996) in New Zealand.  Singer received the book, but did not read it, while Boyle met with Bell and read the book, but ultimately pursued another project.  Fincher, who had previously read the book and tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film, but was hesitant to work with 20th Century Fox again after his bad experiences with the studio during <i><a href="/wiki/Alien%C2%B3" id="w">AlienÂ³</a></i> (1992).  A meeting with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic restored his relationship with the studio,<sup id="_ref-mav1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mav1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and in August 1997, <a href="/wiki/Twentieth_Century_Fox" id="w">Twentieth Century Fox</a> announced that Fincher would helm the <a href="/wiki/Film_adaptation" id="w">film adaptation</a> of the novel.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Mechanic and Ziskin initially planned to finance the film with a $23 million budget.<sup id="_ref-mav1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mav1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Casting" name="Casting"></a><h2>Casting</h2>
<p>Producer Ross Bell met with actor <a href="/wiki/Russell_Crowe" id="w">Russell Crowe</a> to discuss portraying Tyler Durden, while at the same time producer Art Linson, who had lately joined the project, was negotiating with <a href="/wiki/Brad_Pitt" id="w">Brad Pitt</a> for the same role.  Due to Linson&#39;s seniority, Pitt was cast over Crowe.<sup id="_ref-mav1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mav1" title="">[1]</a></sup>  Pitt, who was seeking a new project after the failure of his previous film, <i><a href="/wiki/Meet_Joe_Black" id="w">Meet Joe Black</a></i> (1998), was hired for $17.5 million, the studio believing that <i>Fight Club</i> would be more commercially successful with a major star.<sup id="_ref-mav2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mav2" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Likewise for the role of the nameless narrator, the studio desired a &#34;sexier marquee name&#34; like <a href="/wiki/Matt_Damon" id="w">Matt Damon</a> to increase the film&#39;s visibility (<a href="/wiki/Sean_Penn" id="w">Sean Penn</a> was also considered), but Fincher sought to cast <a href="/wiki/Edward_Norton" id="w">Edward Norton</a> in that role, based on the actor&#39;s performance in <i><a href="/wiki/The_People_vs._Larry_Flynt" id="w">The People vs. Larry Flynt</a></i> (1996).<sup id="_ref-vanity_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vanity" title="">[4]</a></sup> Norton had also been approached by other studios for leading roles in films like <i><a href="/wiki/The_Talented_Mr._Ripley_(film)" id="w">The Talented Mr. Ripley</a></i> (1999) and <i><a href="/wiki/Man_on_the_Moon" id="w">Man on the Moon</a></i> (1999), and he temporarily pursued <i><a href="/wiki/Runaway_Jury" id="w">Runaway Jury</a></i> (2003) before that project fell apart. To lure him away from the other projects, Fox offered Norton a salary of $2.5 million, but Norton could not immediately accept, as he still  owed <a href="/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" id="w">Paramount Pictures</a> a film.  Norton therefore signed a new contract with Paramount for a lesser salary, eventually and unwillingly being cast in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Italian_Job_(2003_film)" id="w">The Italian Job</a></i> (2003).<sup id="_ref-mav2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mav2" title="">[3]</a></sup>  In January 1998, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton officially joined the project to portray Tyler Durden and the nameless narrator, respectively.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Actresses <a href="/wiki/Courtney_Love" id="w">Courtney Love</a> and <a href="/wiki/Winona_Ryder" id="w">Winona Ryder</a> were considered to portray Marla Singer,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  and the studio would have cast <a href="/wiki/Reese_Witherspoon" id="w">Reese Witherspoon</a> were it not for Fincher&#39;s objections that the actress was too young.<sup id="_ref-mav2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mav2" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Ultimately, <a href="/wiki/Helena_Bonham_Carter" id="w">Helena Bonham Carter</a> was cast in the role, based on her performance in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wings_of_the_Dove_(film)" id="w">The Wings of the Dove</a></i> (1997).<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>To prepare for their roles, Norton and Pitt took lessons in <a href="/wiki/Boxing" id="w">boxing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Taekwondo" id="w">taekwondo</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Grappling" id="w">grappling</a>, <sup id="_ref-details_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-details" title="">[8]</a></sup>  in addition to <a href="/wiki/Soapmaking" id="w">soapmaking</a> classes from boutique company owner Auntie Godmother.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  For the cosmetics of his role, Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off, which were restored after filming concluded.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Writing" name="Writing"></a><h2>Writing</h2>
<p>Screenwriter Jim Uhls began working on the adaptation from an earlier draft which lacked a <a href="/wiki/Voice-over" id="w">voice-over</a> due to the industry&#39;s perspective at the time that the technique was &#34;hackneyed and trite&#34;.  When Fincher joined the project, he disagreed with the approach, believing that the film&#39;s humor came from the narrator&#39;s voice,<sup id="_ref-mav2_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mav2" title="">[3]</a></sup>  and described the film without voice-over as seemingly &#34;sad and pathetic&#34;.<sup id="_ref-comment_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comment" title="">[11]</a></sup>  The director and Uhls developed the script for six to seven months, creating a third draft by 1997 that reordered the story and left out several major elements.  When Pitt came on board, the actor expressed concern that Tyler Durden was too one-dimensional, so Fincher sought the advice of writer-director <a href="/wiki/Cameron_Crowe" id="w">Cameron Crowe</a>, who suggested giving the character more ambiguity.  Fincher also hired screenwriter <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Kevin_Walker" id="w">Andrew Kevin Walker</a> and invited Pitt and Norton to collaborate on rewriting the script, which was completed after a year of work and five drafts.<sup id="_ref-mav2_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mav2" title="">[3]</a></sup>  The narrator was written to be nameless in the film, although he is identified in the script as Jack.  The narrator&#39;s aliases in the support groups that he attends were based on characters from <i><a href="/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_(1968_film)" id="w">Planet of the Apes</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" id="w">Robert De Niro</a> roles of the &#39;70s.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>

Author <a href="/wiki/Chuck_Palahniuk" id="w">Chuck Palahniuk</a> praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel <i>Fight Club</i> and applauded the fact that the plot of the film was more streamlined than that of the book.  Palahniuk also noted the contention over the believability for film audiences of the novel&#39;s plot twist, the inclusion of which Director David Fincher supported by saying, &#34;If they accept everything up to this point, they&#39;ll accept the plot twist. If they&#39;re still in the theater, they&#39;ll stay with it.&#34;  Palahniuk was, however, annoyed by the film&#39;s change of a single ingredient in its explanation on making <a href="/wiki/Napalm" id="w">napalm</a>, which rendered the recipe useless, since the author had researched the components extensively.<sup id="_ref-dvdtalk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvdtalk" title="">[13]</a></sup>  Palahniuk&#39;s novel also contained <a href="/wiki/Homoerotic" id="w">homoerotic</a> overtones, which the director purposely included in the film in order to make audiences uncomfortable and thereby accentuate the surprise of the film&#39;s twists and turns.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>  The scene in which Tyler Durden bathes next to the narrator is an example of such overtones, although Durden&#39;s insight in the scene, &#34;I&#39;m wondering if another woman is really the answer we need,&#34; was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality.<sup id="_ref-DVDcom_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DVDcom" title="">[15]</a></sup>  Another example of the overtones was the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the narrator&#39;s mouth.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the end of the film, the narrator finds redemption in rejecting Tyler Durden&#39;s dialectic, which is a divergence from the novel&#39;s end, in which the narrator is placed in a mental institution.<sup id="_ref-empire_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-empire" title="">[17]</a></sup> Norton notes the film&#39;s redemptive parallel to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Graduate" id="w">The Graduate</a></i>, as the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self.<sup id="_ref-reel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reel" title="">[18]</a></sup>  The director also considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and altered the ending to pull away from him, saying,  &#34;I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing.&#34;<sup id="_ref-empire_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-empire" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

When production first began, the initial $50 million budget, of which half was paid by <a href="/wiki/New_Regency" id="w">New Regency</a>, escalated to a peak of $67 million.  New Regency&#39;s head and <i>Fight Club</i> executive producer <a href="/wiki/Arnon_Milchan" id="w">Arnon Milchan</a> petitioned Fincher to reduce the budget by at least $5 million, but the director refused to cut costs, so Milchan contacted studio head Bill Mechanic, saying that he would back out.

<p>Fighting in the film was heavily choreographed, and fighters were required to &#34;go full out&#34; during fight scenes to capture realistic effects such as having the wind knocked out of oneself.<sup id="_ref-tribune_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tribune" title="">[21]</a></sup>  To enhance the scenes, makeup artist Julie Pearce, who collaborated with the director on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Game_(film)" id="w">The Game</a></i>, studied <a href="/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts" id="w">mixed martial arts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pay-per-view" id="w">pay-per-view</a> boxing for her work on the fighters.

<p>Overall production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and <a href="/wiki/#Visual effects" id="w">complex special effects</a>.

<a id="Cinematography" name="Cinematography"></a><h2>Cinematography</h2>
<p><i>Fight Club</i> was shot in the <a href="/wiki/Super_35" id="w">Super 35</a> format to give the director maximum flexibility in composing shots. To direct the cinematography for the film, director <a href="/wiki/David_Fincher" id="w">David Fincher</a> hired Jeff Cronenweth, the son of the late cinematographer <a href="/wiki/Jordan_Cronenweth" id="w">Jordan Cronenweth</a> with whom Fincher had collaborated for <i><a href="/wiki/Alien%C2%B3" id="w">AlienÂ³</a></i> (1992).  Fincher and Cronenweth drew from elements of the visual styles that Fincher had begun exploring in <i><a href="/wiki/Se7en" id="w">Se7en</a></i> and <i>The Game</i>.  For the narrator&#39;s scenes without Tyler Durden, the look was purposely bland and realistic, while for scenes with Tyler, Fincher chose a look that was &#34;more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense - a visual metaphor of what [the narrator&#39;s] heading into&#34;.  Heavily desaturated colors were used in the costuming, makeup, and art direction, and the crew took advantage of as much natural and practical light at filming locations as possible.  The director also took various approaches to take advantage of lighting situations in the film&#39;s scenes, and several practical locations were chosen for the city lights&#39; effects on the shots&#39; backgrounds.  Fluorescent lighting at practical locations was also embraced to maintain an element of reality and to light the prosthetics of the characters&#39; injuries appropriately.<sup id="_ref-anarchy_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anarchy" title="">[20]</a></sup>  On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were darkened enough to reduce the visibility of the characters&#39; eyes, citing cinematographer <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Willis" id="w">Gordon Willis</a>&#39;s technique as the influence.<sup id="_ref-DVDcom_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DVDcom" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The majority of <i>Fight Club</i> was filmed at night, with daytime shots taking place in purposely shadowed locations.  For the first scenes of the actual indoor fight club in Lou&#39;s basement, the area was lit by inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow.  The director also chose to film fight scenes in the basement from a more objective view, purposely avoiding stylish camerawork and instead placing the camera in a fixed position.

As <a href="/wiki/Visual_effects" id="w">visual effects</a> supervisor, Tod Haug, who had collaborated with director David Fincher on <i>The Game</i>, divided the VFX artists and experts into different facilities, each responsible for addressing a separate aspect of the film&#39;s visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. According to Haug, &#34;We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility&#39;s weakness.&#34; Fincher chose to illustrate the nameless narrator&#39;s perspective with a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Mind%26%2339%3Bs_eye" id="w">mind&#39;s eye</a>&#34; view and to create a <a href="/wiki/Myopic" id="w">myopic</a> framework for the film&#39;s audience.

<p>In <i>Fight Club</i>, the nameless narrator is an <a href="/wiki/Everyman" id="w">everyman</a> who lacks a world of possibilities and initially cannot find a way to change his life.  The narrator finds himself unable to match society&#39;s requirements for happiness and so embarks on a path to enlightenment which involves metaphorically killing his parents, his God, and his teacher.  At the beginning of the film, the narrator has killed off his parents but still finds himself trapped in his false world.

In early 1999, after filming had concluded the previous December, David Fincher edited the footage to prepare <i>Fight Club</i> for a preliminary screening with senior executives.

<p>Marketing executives at Twentieth Century Fox faced difficulties in marketing <i>Fight Club</i> and at one point considered marketing it as an <a href="/wiki/Art_film" id="w">art film</a>.  Because of the film&#39;s violence, they considered it primarily geared toward male audiences and believed that not even the presence of Brad Pitt would attract female filmgoers.  Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers.  Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Brad Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm <a href="/wiki/Wieden%2BKennedy" id="w">Wieden+Kennedy</a> to devise a marketing plan.  The firm came up with a bar of pink soap as the film&#39;s main marketing image, which was considered &#34;a bad joke&#34; by Fox executives.  Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of faux public service announcements presented by Pitt and Norton which the studio considered as inappropriate introductions to the movie.  Instead, the studio financed a $20 million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film&#39;s fight scenes.  <i>Fight Club</i> was also advertised on cable during <a href="/wiki/World_Wrestling_Entertainment" id="w">World Wrestling Federation</a> broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film.<sup id="_ref-mav4_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mav4" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

When <i>Fight Club</i> premiered at the <a href="/wiki/Venice_International_Film_Festival" id="w">Venice International Film Festival</a>, the polarizing film caused a sensation and faced a wide array of opposing opinions from prominent critics.<sup id="_ref-how_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-how" title="">[54]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Janet_Maslin" id="w">Janet Maslin</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">The New York Times</a></i> praised Fincher&#39;s direction and editing of the film.  She also noted that <i>Fight Club</i> carried a message of &#34;contemporary manhood&#34;, and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Roger_Ebert" id="w">Roger Ebert</a> of the <i><a href="/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" id="w">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i> called <i>Fight Club</i> &#34;visceral and hard-edged&#34;, as well as &#34;a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy&#34; that most audiences would not appreciate.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup>  Jay Carr of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Boston_Globe" id="w">The Boston Globe</a></i> thought that the film began with an &#34;invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz&#34;, but that it eventually became &#34;explosively silly&#34;.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup>  David Ansen of <i><a href="/wiki/Newsweek" id="w">Newsweek</a></i> described <i>Fight Club</i> as &#34;an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload&#34; and thought that the ending was too pretentious.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>Richard Schickel of <i><a href="/wiki/Time_(magazine)" id="w">Time</a></i> described the director&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Mise_en_sc%C3%A8ne" id="w">mise en scÃ¨ne</a> as dark and damp, noting, &#34;It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters&#39; aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it&#39;s polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it&#39;s carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it&#39;s better to be wet than dry.&#34;  Schickel applauded the performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, but he criticized the film&#39;s &#34;conventionally gimmicky&#34; unfolding and the failure to make Helena Bonham Carter&#39;s character interesting.<sup id="_ref-time_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-time" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>David Edelstein of <i><a href="/wiki/Slate_(magazine)" id="w">Slate</a></i> thought that <i>Fight Club</i> was &#34;sensationalism that mistakes itself for satire&#34; and criticized the film&#39;s sporadic exploration of satiric ideas.  Edelstein did not consider the message of <i>Fight Club</i> to be revolutionary, believing that it had already been presented in <a href="/wiki/Punk_culture" id="w">punk culture</a>.  Edelstein considered Edward Norton&#39;s performance &#34;marvelous&#34; and thought that Brad Pitt played well into the embodiment of conceit, but the critic believed that the film failed to utilize any female or African-American perspectives.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jeff Vice of the <i><a href="/wiki/Deseret_Morning_News" id="w">Deseret Morning News</a></i> described the film as an <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway" id="w">Ernest Hemingway</a> novel reinterpreted by <a href="/wiki/Ken_Kesey" id="w">Ken Kesey</a> and thought that <i>Fight Club</i> was buoyed by the cast, particularly <a href="/wiki/Edward_Norton" id="w">Edward Norton</a>, who &#34;turns in a terrific performance that veers from intense to horrifying to likably comical and back again&#34;.  Vice described the first two-thirds of the film to be &#34;exhilarating, if disturbing&#34;, though he believed that the final third petered out.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>Feminist author <a href="/wiki/Susan_Faludi" id="w">Susan Faludi</a>, who wrote <i><a href="/wiki/Stiffed:_The_Betrayal_of_the_American_Man" id="w">Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man</a></i>, described <i>Fight Club</i> as an &#34;incisive gender drama&#34;, comparing its message to the 1991 film <i><a href="/wiki/Thelma_%26amp%3B_Louise" id="w">Thelma &#38; Louise</a></i>.  Faludi also considered <i>Fight Club</i> a &#34;savagely violent reprise&#34; of the film <i><a href="/wiki/American_Beauty_(film)" id="w">American Beauty</a></i> (1999) but commented that Fincher&#39;s film &#34;delves deeper for a response&#34;.  The author believed that <i>Fight Club</i> critiqued the &#34;necessarily intramural&#34; revolution and that the film ultimately renounced violence and adolescent fraternity.  Faludi said, &#34;For all its chaotic darkness, <i>Fight Club</i> ends up as a quasi-feminist tale, seen through masculine eyes.&#34;<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since its theatrical run, the film has been received more favorably.  On <a href="/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" id="w">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, <i>Fight Club</i> received 80% overall approval out of 123 reviews from critics, with a &#34;Cream of the Crop&#34; rating of 65% out of 23 reviews from major media outlets.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup>  On <a href="/wiki/Metacritic" id="w">Metacritic</a>, <i>Fight Club</i> received 66% approval based on 35 reviews.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Cultural_impact" name="Cultural_impact"></a><h2>Cultural impact</h2>
<p><i>Fight Club</i> was considered one of the most controversial<sup id="_ref-tribune_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tribune" title="">[21]</a></sup> and talked-about films of 1999.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup>  The film has been perceived as the forerunner of a new mood in American political life.  Like other 1999 films <i><a href="/wiki/Magnolia_(film)" id="w">Magnolia</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Being_John_Malkovich" id="w">Being John Malkovich</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Three_Kings_(film)" id="w">Three Kings</a></i>, <i>Fight Club</i> has also been recognized as an innovation in cinematic form and style.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup>  Following its initial release, <i>Fight Club</i> grew in popularity via <a href="/wiki/Word_of_mouth" id="w">word of mouth</a>,<sup id="_ref-see_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-see" title="">[77]</a></sup> and the positive reception of the DVD established it as a <a href="/wiki/Cult_film" id="w">cult film</a> that <i>Newsweek</i> conjectured would enjoy &#34;perennial&#34; fame.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup>  The success of the film has also propelled the novel&#39;s author <a href="/wiki/Chuck_Palahniuk" id="w">Chuck Palahniuk</a> to global renown.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>
<p>The film has spawned several actual fight clubs in America since its release.  A &#34;Gentleman&#39;s Fight Club&#34; was started in <a href="/wiki/Menlo_Park%2C_California" id="w">Menlo Park, California</a> in 2000 and has members mostly from the <a href="/wiki/High_tech" id="w">high tech</a> industry.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup>  Teens and preteens in <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Washington" id="w">Washington</a> state, and <a href="/wiki/Alaska" id="w">Alaska</a> also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs.  In 2006, a fight club in <a href="/wiki/Arlington%2C_Texas" id="w">Arlington, Texas</a> injured an unwilling participant from a local high school, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup>  An unsanctioned fight club was even started at <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton University</a>, and matches were held on campus.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup>  The film has also been suspected of influencing <a href="/wiki/Luke_Helder" id="w">Luke Helder</a>, a college student who planted <a href="/wiki/Pipe_bomb" id="w">pipe bombs</a> in mailboxes in 2002.  Helder&#39;s goal was to create a <a href="/wiki/Smiley" id="w">smiley</a> pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in <i>Fight Club</i> in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to actor <a href="/wiki/Edward_Norton" id="w">Edward Norton</a>, his old professor from <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" id="w">Yale University</a> has reported being inundated with <a href="/wiki/Thesis" id="w">dissertations</a> about <i>Fight Club</i>.<sup id="_ref-see_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-see" title="">[77]</a></sup>  The film has also been used as an academic tool at <a href="/wiki/Northern_Arizona_University" id="w">Northern Arizona University</a> to introduce students to rhetorical analysis and argumentation.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> In addition, the film has been parodied in a <a href="/wiki/Re-cut_trailer" id="w">re-cut trailer</a> that converted the storyline into a &#34;quirky love story&#34; between Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter&#39;s characters.  The <i><a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" id="w">Wall Street Journal</a></i> noted that this parody trailer was &#34;dominated by a distinctly nonprofessional voiceover&#34;.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup></p>
