<b>Tropical Storm Leslie</b> was the costliest <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical cyclone</a> of the <a href="/wiki/2000_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">2000 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. The twelfth named storm of the season, Leslie formed out of a <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">trough</a> of low pressure on <a href="/wiki/October_4" id="w">October 4</a> to the east of <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>. Initially a <a href="/wiki/Subtropical_cyclone" id="w">subtropical cyclone</a>, it strengthened and attained enough <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis" id="w">tropical characteristics</a> to be reclassified as Tropical Storm Leslie on <a href="/wiki/October_5" id="w">October 5</a>. Leslie reached peak winds of 45&#160;mph (70&#160;km/h) before <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" id="w">wind shear</a> weakened it, and on <a href="/wiki/October_7" id="w">October 7</a> it transitioned into an <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" id="w">extratropical cyclone</a> over the open <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a>. It lasted three more days before losing its identity.</p>
<p>Leslie had little impact as a tropical cyclone. The precursor trough of low pressure produced torrential rainfall across Florida, peaking at 17.5&#160;inches (440&#160;mm). The flooding damaged thousands of houses and caused three indirect deaths. Damage in southern Florida totaled $950&#160;million (2000&#160;USD, $1.1&#160;billion 2006&#160;USD), of which around half was from agricultural damage. After the flooding, portions of south Florida were declared a disaster area.</p>

On <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a>, a tropical wave entered the eastern <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a>, likely the same wave that spawned <a href="/wiki/2000_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Hurricane Isaac" id="w">Hurricane Isaac</a>. It moved generally westward, and remained weak with only sporadic thunderstorm activity. The wave traversed around the periphery of <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Keith" id="w">Hurricane Keith</a>, and developed a mid-level circulation just south of western <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a> by <a href="/wiki/October_2" id="w">October 2</a>. It continued to organize as it moved to the northwest, prompting a <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Hunters" id="w">Reconnaissance Aircraft</a> into the area. However, the system lacked a surface circulation center, and remained an elongated trough of low pressure. The tropical wave interacted with an approaching frontal trough, while its mid-level center turned to the northeast and made landfall near <a href="/wiki/Sarasota%2C_Florida" id="w">Sarasota, Florida</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_4" id="w">October 4</a>. While over land, a surface circulation developed near <a href="/wiki/Orlando%2C_Florida" id="w">Orlando</a>, and the National Hurricane Center designated the system as <a href="/wiki/Subtropical_cyclone" id="w">Subtropical Depression</a> One. The subtropical designation occurred due to deep convection far removed from the center,<sup id="_ref-tcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> as well as an upper level trough instead of an anticyclone providing support for the system.<sup id="_ref-lesdis1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lesdis1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Precursor Trough over Florida</div>
The subtropical depression moved to the east-northeast, and steadily organized as deep convection developed closer to the center. Peak winds in the system, which were 175&#160;miles (280&#160;km) from the center when it first formed, were only 85&#160;miles (135&#160;km) from the center by the morning of <a href="/wiki/October_5" id="w">October 5</a>. Based on its organization and winds of 40&#160;mph (65&#160;km/h), the system was redesignated as Tropical Storm Leslie. As Leslie moved to the east-northeast, it strengthened slightly to reach winds of 45&#160;mph (70&#160;km/h). The storm interacted with an approaching cold front, and became extratropical on <a href="/wiki/October_7" id="w">October 7</a> while 375&#160;miles (600&#160;km) north of <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>. The extratropical storm accelerated to the northeast and passed over <a href="/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)" id="w">Newfoundland</a> on the 8th. It turned to the east then southeast, strengthening to near hurricane-force winds before losing its identity near <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a> on the 10th.<sup id="_ref-tcr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> predicted the trough of low pressure to drop very heavy rainfall across western <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a> and <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>.<sup id="_ref-two_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-two" title="">[3]</a></sup> The National Weather Service in <a href="/wiki/Miami%2C_Florida" id="w">Miami</a> issued a flood watch for southern Florida, stating that the system could produce flooding on roads and low-lying areas.<sup id="_ref-nws_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nws" title="">[4]</a></sup> As a pre-emptive measure, water managers moved water out of canals.<sup id="_ref-sofla_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sofla" title="">[5]</a></sup> In general, however, there was little warning for the flooding in Florida.<sup id="_ref-prep_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-prep" title="">[6]</a></sup> While Leslie was moving east-northeastward, it posed a threat to <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>, prompting officials to issue a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">Tropical Storm Warning</a>. However, the storm passed well to the west, and the warnings were quickly dropped. <sup id="_ref-tcr_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

The torrential rainfall in Florida, similar to <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Irene_(1999)" id="w">Hurricane Irene</a> a year earlier, flooded about 93,000 homes with 214,000 residents in Miami-Dade County.<sup id="_ref-rcreport_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rcreport" title="">[10]</a></sup> An incomplete damage survey of Miami-Dade County indicated the flooding destroyed 1,005 houses, severely damaged 1,358, and caused minor damage to 3,443.<sup id="_ref-dam_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dam" title="">[11]</a></sup> The floodwaters, which were 4&#160;feet (1.2&#160;m) deep in places, also flooded thousands of cars. Many were stranded in their houses, forcing them to use canoes or inflatable rafts to move to higher grounds. All schools in the Miami area were closed, and all nonessential Miami-Dade County employees were asked to stay home. Numerous flights in <a href="/wiki/Miami_International_Airport" id="w">Miami International Airport</a> were cancelled or delayed, though the airport remained opened.<sup id="_ref-cnn_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cnn" title="">[9]</a></sup> The flooding, which was greatest in <a href="/wiki/Sweetwater%2C_Florida" id="w">Sweetwater</a>, <a href="/wiki/West_Miami%2C_Florida" id="w">West Miami</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hialeah%2C_Florida" id="w">Hialeah</a>, <a href="/wiki/Opa-Locka%2C_Florida" id="w">Opa-Locka</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pembroke_Park%2C_Florida" id="w">Pembroke Park</a>, lasted for up to a week in areas.<sup id="_ref-ncdc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ncdc" title="">[12]</a></sup> The extreme flooding damaged electrical stations, leaving more than 27,000 without power.<sup id="_ref-rcreport_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rcreport" title="">[10]</a></sup> The flooding indirectly killed three people; two from drowning as a result of driving vehicles into deep water,<sup id="_ref-tcr_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> and one when a man fell from a tall building while trying to unclog a roof drain.<sup id="_ref-cnn_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cnn" title="">[9]</a></sup> Property damage totaled $450&#160;million (2000&#160;USD, $500&#160;million 2005&#160;USD).<sup id="_ref-ncdc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ncdc" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Flood waters in <a href="/wiki/Miami-Dade_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Miami-Dade County</a> covered about 40,000&#160;acres (160 km²) of agricultural land, causing severe problems for farmers.

<p>As an extratropical storm, Leslie produced winds of around 40&#160;mph (65&#160;km/h) while making landfall in Newfoundland. It also produced waves of up to 16&#160;feet (5&#160;m) in height, along with rainfall totals of around 1&#160;inch (30&#160;mm). The overall impact in this region was minor.<sup id="_ref-chc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chc" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the immediate aftermath, cleanup workers could not work until the floodwaters receded.
