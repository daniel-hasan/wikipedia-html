<b>Tourette syndrome</b> (also called <b>Tourette&#39;s syndrome</b>, <b>Tourette&#39;s disorder</b>, <b>Gilles de la Tourette syndrome</b>, <b>GTS</b> or, more commonly, simply <b>Tourette&#39;s</b> or <b>TS</b>) is an <a href="/wiki/Heredity" id="w">inherited</a> <a href="/wiki/Neurological" id="w">neurological</a> disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by the presence of multiple physical (motor) <a href="/wiki/Tic" id="w">tics</a> and at least one vocal (phonic) tic; these tics characteristically wax and wane. Tourette&#39;s is defined as part of a spectrum of <a href="/wiki/Tic_disorder" id="w">tic disorders</a>, which includes transient and chronic tics. </p>
<p>Tourette&#39;s was once considered a rare and bizarre <a href="/wiki/Syndrome" id="w">syndrome</a>, most often associated with the exclamation of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks (<a href="/wiki/Coprolalia" id="w">coprolalia</a>).  However, this symptom is present in only a small minority of people with Tourette&#39;s.<sup id="_ref-dude_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dude" title="">[1]</a></sup>  Tourette&#39;s is no longer considered a rare condition, but it may not always be correctly identified because most cases are classified as mild.  Between 1 and 11 children per 1,000 have Tourette&#39;s; as many as one in a hundred people may have tic disorders,<sup id="_ref-NIH_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIH" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CommunitySample_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CommunitySample" title="">[3]</a></sup> with the more common tics of eye blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements.  People with Tourette&#39;s have normal <a href="/wiki/Life_expectancy" id="w">life expectancy</a> and intelligence. The severity of the tics decreases for most children as they pass through <a href="/wiki/Adolescence" id="w">adolescence</a>, and extreme Tourette&#39;s in adulthood is a rarity. <a href="/wiki/Sociological_and_cultural_aspects_of_Tourette_syndrome#Notable individuals" id="w">Notable individuals with Tourette&#39;s</a> are found in all walks of life.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Genetics" id="w">Genetic</a> and environmental factors each play a role in the <a href="/wiki/Etiology" id="w">etiology</a> of Tourette&#39;s, but the exact causes are unknown. In most cases, medication is unnecessary.  There is no effective medication for every case of tics, but there are medications and therapies that can help when their use is warranted.  Explanation and  reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment;<sup id="_ref-Zinner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zinner" title="">[5]</a></sup> education is an important part of any treatment plan.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Eponym" id="w">eponym</a> was bestowed by <a href="/wiki/Jean-Martin_Charcot" id="w">Jean-Martin Charcot</a> (1825–93) on behalf of his resident, <a href="/wiki/Georges_Gilles_de_la_Tourette" id="w">Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette</a> (1859–1904), a French physician and <a href="/wiki/Neurology" id="w">neurologist</a>, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette&#39;s in 1885.</p> 
<a id="Classification" name="Classification"></a><h2>Classification</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Tic" id="w">Tics</a> are sudden, repetitive, stereotyped, nonrhythmic movements (motor tics) and utterances (phonic tics) that involve discrete muscle groups.<sup id="_ref-phenomenology_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-phenomenology" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Motor tics are movement-based tics, while phonic tics are involuntary sounds produced by moving air through the nose, mouth, or throat.</p>
<p>Tourette&#39;s is one of several <a href="/wiki/Tic_disorder" id="w">tic disorders</a>, which are classified by the <i><a href="/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders" id="w">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a></i> (DSM) according to type (motor or phonic tics) and duration (transient or chronic). Transient tic disorder consists of multiple motor tics, phonic tics or both, with a duration between four weeks and twelve months.  Chronic tic disorder is either single or multiple, motor or phonic tics (but not both), which are present for more than a year.<sup id="_ref-phenomenology_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-phenomenology" title="">[7]</a></sup>   Tourette&#39;s is diagnosed when multiple motor tics, and at least one phonic tic, are present for more than a year.<sup id="_ref-Behavenet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Behavenet" title="">[8]</a></sup>  Tic disorders are defined similarly by the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" id="w">World Health Organization</a> (<a href="/wiki/ICD-10" id="w">ICD-10</a> codes).<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Tourette&#39;s is the more severe expression of the spectrum of tic disorders,<sup id="_ref-Bagheri_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bagheri" title="">[10]</a></sup> most cases are mild.<sup id="_ref-TSAWhat_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSAWhat" title="">[11]</a></sup>  The severity of symptoms varies widely among people with Tourette&#39;s, and mild cases may be undetected.<sup id="_ref-phenomenology_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-phenomenology" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Characteristics" name="Characteristics"></a><h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>Tics are movements or sounds &#34;that occur intermittently and unpredictably out of a background of normal motor activity&#34;,<sup id="_ref-TSADef_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSADef" title="">[12]</a></sup> having the appearance of &#34;normal behaviors gone wrong.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Dure_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dure" title="">[13]</a></sup> The tics associated with Tourette&#39;s constantly change in number, frequency, severity and anatomical location. Waxing and waning—the ongoing increase and decrease in severity and frequency of tics—occurs differently in each individual.  Tics also occur in &#34;bouts of bouts&#34;, which vary for each person.<sup id="_ref-phenomenology_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-phenomenology" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Coprolalia" id="w">Coprolalia</a> (the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases) is the most publicized symptom of Tourette&#39;s, but it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette&#39;s. According to the <a href="/wiki/Tourette_Syndrome_Association" id="w">Tourette Syndrome Association</a>, fewer than 15% of Tourette&#39;s patients exhibit coprolalia.<sup id="_ref-TSAFAQ_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSAFAQ" title="">[14]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Echolalia" id="w">Echolalia</a> (repeating the words of others) and  <a href="/wiki/Palilalia" id="w">palilalia</a> (repeating one&#39;s own words) occur in a minority of cases,<sup id="_ref-phenomenology_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-phenomenology" title="">[7]</a></sup> while the most common initial motor and vocal tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>{{Clips of tics}} 
In contrast to the stereotyped movements of other <a href="/wiki/Movement_disorder" id="w">movement disorders</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Chorea_(disease)" id="w">choreas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dystonia" id="w">dystonias</a>, <a href="/wiki/Myoclonus" id="w">myoclonus</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dyskinesia" id="w">dyskinesias</a>), the tics of Tourette&#39;s are temporarily suppressible and preceded by a premonitory urge.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  Immediately preceding tic onset, most individuals with Tourette&#39;s are aware of an urge<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>  that is similar to the need to sneeze or scratch an itch. Individuals describe the need to tic as a buildup of tension<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> which they consciously choose to release, as if they &#34;had to do it&#34;.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>  Examples of the premonitory urge are the feeling of having something in one&#39;s throat, or a localized discomfort in the shoulders, leading to the need to clear one&#39;s throat or shrug the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching an itch.  Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye.  These urges and sensations, preceding the expression of the movement or vocalization as a tic, are referred to as &#34;premonitory <a href="/wiki/Sensory_phenomena" id="w">sensory phenomena</a>&#34;.  Published descriptions of the tics of Tourette&#39;s identify sensory phenomena as the core <a href="/wiki/Symptom" id="w">symptom</a> of the syndrome, even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Tics are described as semi-voluntary or <i>&#34;unvoluntary&#34;,</i><sup id="_ref-TSADef_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSADef" title="">[12]</a></sup> because they are not strictly <i>involuntary</i>—they may be experienced as a <i>voluntary</i> response to the unwanted, premonitory urge.  A unique aspect of tics, relative to other movement disorders, is that they are suppressible yet irresistible;<sup id="_ref-Dure_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dure" title="">[13]</a></sup> they are experienced as an irresistible urge that must eventually be expressed.<sup id="_ref-TSADef_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSADef" title="">[12]</a></sup>  People with Tourette&#39;s are sometimes able to suppress their tics to some extent for limited periods of time, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward.<sup id="_ref-Zinner_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zinner" title="">[5]</a></sup>  People with Tourette&#39;s may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or there may be a marked increase in tics, after a period of suppression at school or at work.<sup id="_ref-Dure_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dure" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some people with Tourette&#39;s may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity.<sup id="_ref-TSADef_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSADef" title="">[12]</a></sup>  They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges.  Children may suppress tics while in the doctor&#39;s office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched.<sup id="_ref-emed_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emed" title="">[22]</a></sup>  The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.</p>
<p>Although there is no such thing as a &#34;typical&#34; case of Tourette syndrome,<sup id="_ref-Zinner_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zinner" title="">[5]</a></sup> the condition follows a fairly reliable course in terms of the age of onset and the history of the severity of symptoms. Tics may appear up to the age of eighteen, but the most typical age of onset is from five to seven.<sup id="_ref-phenomenology_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-phenomenology" title="">[7]</a></sup>  The ages of highest tic severity are eight to twelve (average ten), with tics steadily declining for most patients as they pass through adolescence.<sup id="_ref-YaleTicSeverity_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-YaleTicSeverity" title="">[23]</a></sup>  The most common, first-presenting tics are eye blinking, facial movements, sniffing and throat clearing.  Initial tics present most frequently in midline body regions where there are many muscles, usually the head, neck and facial region.<sup id="_ref-Zinner_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zinner" title="">[5]</a></sup> This can be contrasted with the stereotyped movements of other disorders (such as <a href="/wiki/Stimming" id="w">stims</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stereotypy_(psychiatry)" id="w">stereotypies</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Autism_spectrum_disorder" id="w">autism spectrum disorders</a>), which typically have an earlier age of onset, are more symmetrical, rhythmical and bilateral, and involve the extremities (e.g., flapping the hands).<sup id="_ref-Rapin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rapin" title="">[24]</a></sup>  Tics that appear early in the course of the condition are frequently confused with other conditions, such as <a href="/wiki/Allergies" id="w">allergies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Asthma" id="w">asthma</a>, and vision problems: pediatricians, allergists and ophthalmologists are typically the first to see a child with tics.<sup id="_ref-phenomenology_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-phenomenology" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Among patients whose symptoms are severe enough to warrant referral to clinics, <a href="/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder" id="w">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a> (OCD) and <a href="/wiki/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder" id="w">attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD) are often associated with Tourette&#39;s.  Not all persons with Tourette&#39;s have ADHD or OCD or other <a href="/wiki/Comorbid" id="w">comorbid</a> conditions (co-occurring diagnoses other than Tourette&#39;s), although in clinical populations, a high percentage of patients presenting for care do have ADHD.<sup id="_ref-Disentangling_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Disentangling" title="">[25]</a></sup> One author reports that a ten-year overview of patient records revealed about 40% of patients with Tourette&#39;s have &#34;TS-only&#34; or &#34;pure TS&#34;, referring to Tourette syndrome in the absence of ADHD, OCD and other disorders.<sup id="_ref-Denckla_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Denckla" title="">[26]</a></sup>  Another author reports that 57% of 656 patients presenting with tic disorders had uncomplicated tics, while 43% had tics plus comorbid conditions.<sup id="_ref-Dure_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dure" title="">[13]</a></sup>  &#34;Full-blown Tourette&#39;s&#34; is a term used to describe patients who have significant comorbid conditions in addition to tics.<sup id="_ref-Dure_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dure" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Causes" name="Causes"></a><h2>Causes</h2>
<p>{{main}}
The exact cause of Tourette&#39;s is unknown, but it is well established that both genetic and environmental factors are involved.<sup id="_ref-AN2intro_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AN2intro" title="">[27]</a></sup>  Genetic studies have shown that the overwhelming majority of cases of Tourette&#39;s are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known,<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> and no gene has been identified.<sup id="_ref-Zinner_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zinner" title="">[5]</a></sup> In some cases, tics may not be inherited; these cases are identified as &#34;sporadic&#34; Tourette syndrome (also known as <a href="/wiki/Tourettism" id="w">tourettism</a>) because a genetic link is missing.<sup id="_ref-Mejia_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mejia" title="">[29]</a></sup> <a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Brain_structure.gif" title="Brain structures implicated in Tourette&#39;s syndrome"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_structure.gif" alt="Brain structures implicated in Tourette&#39;s syndrome" title="Brain structures implicated in Tourette&#39;s syndrome" class="location-left type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Brain structures implicated in Tourette&#39;s syndrome</div></p>
<p>A person with Tourette&#39;s has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) to one of his or her children, but Tourette&#39;s is a condition of <a href="/wiki/Expressivity" id="w">variable expression</a> and <a href="/wiki/Penetrance" id="w">incomplete penetrance</a>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette&#39;s, as a milder tic disorder (transient or chronic tics), or as obsessive compulsive symptoms without tics.  Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention.<sup id="_ref-TSAFAQ_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSAFAQ" title="">[14]</a></sup>  Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.<sup id="_ref-emed_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emed" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Non-genetic, environmental, infectious, or <a href="/wiki/Psychosocial" id="w">psychosocial</a> factors—while not causing Tourette&#39;s—can influence its severity.<sup id="_ref-Zinner_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zinner" title="">[5]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Autoimmune" id="w">Autoimmune</a> processes may affect tic onset and exacerbation in some cases. In 1998, a team at the <a href="/wiki/National_Institute_of_Mental_Health" id="w">National Institute of Mental Health</a> proposed a hypothesis that both obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders may arise in a subset of children as a result of a poststreptococcal autoimmune process.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> Children who meet five diagnostic criteria are classified, according to the hypothesis, as having Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (<a href="/wiki/PANDAS" id="w">PANDAS</a>).<sup id="_ref-NIHPANDAS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NIHPANDAS" title="">[32]</a></sup> This contentious hypothesis is the focus of clinical and laboratory research, but remains unproven.<sup id="_ref-Swerdlow_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Swerdlow" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>The exact mechanism affecting the inherited vulnerability to Tourette&#39;s has not been established, and the precise etiology is unknown. Tics are believed to result from dysfunction in cortical and subcortical regions, the <a href="/wiki/Human_thalamus" id="w">thalamus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Basal_ganglia" id="w">basal ganglia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frontal_lobe" id="w">frontal cortex</a>.<sup id="_ref-AN2intro_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AN2intro" title="">[27]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Neuroanatomy" id="w">Neuroanatomic</a> models implicate failures in circuits connecting the brain&#39;s cortex and subcortex,<sup id="_ref-Zinner_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zinner" title="">[5]</a></sup>  and <a href="/wiki/Neuroimaging" id="w">imaging techniques</a> implicate the basal ganglia and frontal cortex.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some forms of OCD may be genetically linked to Tourette&#39;s.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup>  A subset of OCD is thought to be <a href="/wiki/Etiologic" id="w">etiologically</a> related to Tourette&#39;s and may be a different expression of the same factors that are important for the expression of tics.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>  The genetic relationship of ADHD to Tourette syndrome, however, has not been fully established.<sup id="_ref-Denckla_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Denckla" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Diagnosis" name="Diagnosis"></a><h2>Diagnosis</h2>
<p>According to the revised fourth edition of the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (<a href="/wiki/DSM-IV-TR" id="w">DSM-IV-TR</a>), Tourette’s Disorder may be diagnosed when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics (although these do not need to be concurrent) over the period of a year, with no more than three consecutive tic-free months.  The previous DSM-IV included a requirement for &#34;marked distress or significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning&#34;, but this requirement was removed in the most recent update of the manual, in recognition that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criterion for Tourette&#39;s, but do not have distress or impairment.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup>  The onset must have occurred before the age of 18, and cannot be attributed to the &#34;direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Behavenet_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Behavenet" title="">[8]</a></sup>  Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as <a href="/wiki/Autism" id="w">autism</a> or other causes of <a href="/wiki/Tourettism" id="w">tourettism</a>—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette&#39;s diagnosis. </p>
<p>There are no specific medical or screening tests that can be used in diagnosing Tourette&#39;s;<sup id="_ref-phenomenology_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-phenomenology" title="">[7]</a></sup>  it is frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, partly because of the wide expression of severity, ranging from mild (the majority of cases) or moderate, to severe (the rare, but more widely-recognized and publicized cases).<sup id="_ref-YaleTicSeverity_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-YaleTicSeverity" title="">[23]</a></sup>
The diagnosis is made based on observation of the individual&#39;s symptoms and family history, and after ruling out <a href="/wiki/Tourettism" id="w">secondary causes of tic disorders.</a><sup id="_ref-TSAFAQ_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSAFAQ" title="">[14]</a></sup>  In patients with a typical onset and a family history of tics or obsessive–compulsive disorder, a basic physical and neurological examination may be sufficient.<sup id="_ref-Bagheri_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bagheri" title="">[10]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>If a physician believes that there may be another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition.  An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and <a href="/wiki/Seizure" id="w">seizure</a> activity exists, which would call for an <a href="/wiki/Electroencephalography" id="w">EEG</a>, or if there are symptoms that indicate an <a href="/wiki/MRI" id="w">MRI</a> to rule out brain abnormalities.<sup id="_ref-Assessment_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Assessment" title="">[39]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone" id="w">TSH</a> levels can be measured to rule out <a href="/wiki/Hypothyroidism" id="w">hypothyroidism</a>, which can be a cause of tics.  <a href="/wiki/Brain_imaging" id="w">Brain imaging</a> studies are not usually warranted.<sup id="_ref-Assessment_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Assessment" title="">[39]</a></sup>  In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a <a href="/wiki/Drug_test#Urine drug screen" id="w">urine drug screen</a> for <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" id="w">cocaine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stimulants" id="w">stimulants</a> might be necessary.

Tourette syndrome is a spectrum disorder—its severity ranges over a spectrum from mild to severe.  The majority of cases are mild and require no treatment.<sup id="_ref-TSAWhat_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSAWhat" title="">[11]</a></sup>  In these cases, the impact of symptoms on the individual may be mild, to the extent that casual observers might not know of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with Tourette syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood.<sup id="_ref-AN2intro_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AN2intro" title="">[27]</a></sup>  A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning.<sup id="_ref-phenomenology_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-phenomenology" title="">[7]</a></sup>  The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette&#39;s, all patients completed high school, 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.<sup id="_ref-outcome_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-outcome" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>Regardless of symptom severity, individuals with Tourette&#39;s can expect to live a normal <a href="/wiki/Life_expectancy" id="w">life span</a>.  Although the symptoms may be lifelong and chronic for some, the condition is not <a href="/wiki/Degeneration_(medical)" id="w">degenerative</a> or life-threatening.  <a href="/wiki/Intelligence_(trait)" id="w">Intelligence</a> is normal in those with Tourette&#39;s, although there may be learning disabilities.<sup id="_ref-TSAFAQ_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSAFAQ" title="">[14]</a></sup>  There is no reliable means of predicting the outcome for a particular individual. The gene or genes associated with Tourette&#39;s have not been identified, and there is no potential &#34;cure&#34;.<sup id="_ref-TSAFAQ_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSAFAQ" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated that the condition in most children improves with maturity.  Tics may be at their highest severity at the time that they are diagnosed, and often improve with understanding of the condition by individuals and their families and friends.  The statistical age of highest tic severity is typically between eight and twelve, with most individuals experiencing steadily declining tic severity as they pass through adolescence.  One study showed no correlation with tic severity and the onset of puberty, in contrast with the popular belief that tics increase at puberty. In many cases, a complete remission of tic symptoms occurs after adolescence.<sup id="_ref-YaleTicSeverity_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-YaleTicSeverity" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup>  However, a study using videotape to record tics in adults found that, although tics diminished in comparison with childhood, and all measures of tic severity improved by adulthood, 90% of adults still had tics. Half of the adults who considered themselves tic-free still displayed evidence of tics.<sup id="_ref-outcome_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-outcome" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is not uncommon for the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children.  Because Tourette&#39;s tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette&#39;s are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.</p>
<p>Children with Tourette&#39;s may suffer socially if their tics are viewed as &#34;bizarre&#34;.  If a child has disabling tics, or tics that interfere with social or academic functioning, supportive <a href="/wiki/Psychotherapy" id="w">psychotherapy</a> or school accommodations can be helpful.<sup id="_ref-TSAFAQ_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSAFAQ" title="">[14]</a></sup> Because <a href="/wiki/Comorbid" id="w">comorbid</a> conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) can cause greater impact on overall functioning than tics, a thorough evaluation for comorbidity is called for when symptoms and impairment warrant.<sup id="_ref-Bagheri_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bagheri" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>A supportive environment and family generally gives those with Tourette&#39;s the skills to manage the disorder.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup>  People with Tourette&#39;s may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor.  <a href="/wiki/Sociological_and_cultural_aspects_of_Tourette_syndrome#Notable individuals" id="w">Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals</a> from all walks of life are found among people with Tourette&#39;s. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.<sup id="_ref-phenomenology_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-phenomenology" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>A controlled study on a small group of individuals with Tourette&#39;s found that young people with the syndrome have greater <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_control" id="w">cognitive control</a> over movements than their age-matched controls, possibly because the need to suppress tics results in a more efficient control over inhibitory movements, a skill that confers an advantage when switching between tasks.  Children with Tourette&#39;s (in the absence of comorbid ADHD) performed more accurately on a goal-oriented eye-movement task, requiring active inhibition of automatic eye movements, and they made fewer errors than their unaffected peers, suggesting compensatory changes in the brain resulting in greater cognitive control.<sup id="_ref-EnhancedCognitive_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EnhancedCognitive" title="">[53]</a></sup>  A subsequent study confirmed and extended the paradoxical result that individuals with Tourette&#39;s exhibit greater levels of cognitive control than age-matched healthy peers.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>  A study of eight children, age 8–17, found that children with Tourette syndrome were quicker at processing certain mental grammar skills than are children without the condition.  The abnormalities that lead to tics may also lead to &#34;other rapid behaviors, including the cognitive processing of rule-governed forms in language and other types of procedural knowledge&#34;.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>

<p>A French doctor, <a href="/wiki/Jean_Marc_Gaspard_Itard" id="w">Jean Marc Gaspard Itard</a>, reported the first case of Tourette syndrome in 1825,<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> describing Marquise de Dampierre, an important woman of nobility in her time.<sup id="_ref-TSAWhat_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSAWhat" title="">[11]</a></sup>  Jean-Martin Charcot, an influential French physician, assigned his resident Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette, a French physician and neurologist, to study patients at the <a href="/wiki/Piti%C3%A9-Salp%C3%AAtri%C3%A8re_Hospital" id="w">Salpêtrière</a> Hospital, with the goal of defining an illness distinct from <a href="/wiki/Hysteria" id="w">hysteria</a> and from <a href="/wiki/Chorea_(disease)" id="w">chorea</a>.<sup id="_ref-emed_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emed" title="">[22]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1885, Gilles de la Tourette published an account of nine patients, <i>Study of a Nervous Affliction</i>, concluding that a new clinical category should be defined.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup>  The eponym was later bestowed by Charcot after and on behalf of Gilles de la Tourette.<sup id="_ref-emed_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emed" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Little progress was made over the next century in explaining or treating tics, and a psychogenic view prevailed well into the 20th century.<sup id="_ref-emed_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emed" title="">[22]</a></sup>  The possibility that movement disorders, including Tourette syndrome, might have an <a href="/wiki/Organic_disease" id="w">organic origin</a> was raised when an <a href="/wiki/Encephalitis" id="w">encephalitis</a> <a href="/wiki/Epidemic" id="w">epidemic</a> from 1918–1926 led to a subsequent epidemic of tic disorders.<sup id="_ref-Pagewise_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pagewise" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s, as the beneficial effects of <a href="/wiki/Haloperidol" id="w">haloperidol</a> (Haldol) on tics became known, the psychoanalytic approach to Tourette syndrome was questioned.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup>  The turning point came in 1965, when <a href="/wiki/Arthur_K._Shapiro" id="w">Arthur K. Shapiro</a>—described as &#34;the father of modern tic disorder research&#34;<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup>—treated a Tourette’s patient with haloperidol, and published a paper criticizing the psychoanalytic approach.<sup id="_ref-Pagewise_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pagewise" title="">[71]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Since the 1990s, a more neutral view of Tourette&#39;s has emerged, in which biological vulnerability and adverse environmental events are seen to interact.<sup id="_ref-Zinner_t" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zinner" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-emed_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emed" title="">[22]</a></sup>  In 2000, the <a href="/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association" id="w">American Psychiatric Association</a> published the DSM-IV-TR, revising the text of DSM-IV to no longer require that symptoms of tic disorders cause distress or impair functioning.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup></p>
<p>Findings since 1999 have advanced TS science in the areas of genetics, <a href="/wiki/Neuroimaging" id="w">neuroimaging</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neurophysiology" id="w">neurophysiology</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Neuropathology" id="w">neuropathology</a>.  Questions remain regarding how best to classify Tourette syndrome, and how closely Tourette&#39;s is related to other movement disorders or <a href="/wiki/Psychiatry" id="w">psychiatric</a> disorders.  Good <a href="/wiki/Epidemiologic" id="w">epidemiologic</a> data is still lacking, and <a href="/wiki/Treatment_of_Tourette_syndrome" id="w">available treatments</a> are not risk free and not always well tolerated.<sup id="_ref-ANResearch_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANResearch" title="">[75]</a></sup>  High-profile media coverage focuses on treatments that do not have established safety or efficacy, such as <a href="/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation" id="w">deep brain stimulation</a>, and alternative therapies involving unstudied efficacy and side effects are pursued by many parents.<sup id="_ref-Swerdlow_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Swerdlow" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

The best-known example of a person who may have used obsessive–compulsive traits to advantage is <a href="/wiki/Dr_Samuel_Johnson" id="w">Dr Samuel Johnson</a>, the 18th-century English man of letters, who had Tourette syndrome as clearly evidenced by the writings of <a href="/wiki/James_Boswell" id="w">James Boswell</a>.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup>  Johnson wrote <i><a href="/wiki/A_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language" id="w">A Dictionary of the English Language</a></i> in 1747, and was a prolific writer, poet, and critic.</p>
<p>Some authors have speculated that <a href="/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" id="w">Mozart</a> may have had Tourette&#39;s.  Benjamin Simkin, a medical doctor, argued that Mozart had Tourette syndrome.<sup id="_ref-Byways_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Byways" title="">[81]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup> Simkin is an endocrinologist<sup id="_ref-Byways_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Byways" title="">[81]</a></sup>—not a psychiatrist or a neurologist, the medical fields which specialize in the <a href="/wiki/Neurology" id="w">neurological disorder</a>. His claim was picked up by newspapers worldwide, causing an international sensation, and internet websites have fueled the speculation.<sup id="_ref-TSAMozart_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSAMozart" title="">[83]</a></sup>  However, no Tourette&#39;s expert or organization has presented credible evidence to show that this was the case;<sup id="_ref-TSAMozart_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSAMozart" title="">[83]</a></sup> other authors have found the evidence lacking<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup> and noted neurologist and author <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Sacks" id="w">Oliver Sacks</a> published an editorial disputing Simkin&#39;s claim.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup></p>
<p>The entertainment industry <a href="/wiki/Sociological_and_cultural_aspects_of_Tourette_syndrome#References in the entertainment industry" id="w">often depicts those with Tourette syndrome</a> as social misfits whose only tic is coprolalia, which has furthered stigmatization and the public&#39;s misunderstanding of those with Tourette&#39;s.<sup id="_ref-Holtgren_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Holtgren" title="">[86]</a></sup>  The coprolalic symptoms of Tourette&#39;s are also fodder for radio and television talk shows in the US<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup> and in the British media.<sup id="_ref-Spiked_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spiked" title="">[88]</a></sup></p>
