<p><b>James Dale Guckert</b> (born <a href="/wiki/1957" id="w">1957</a>) worked under the <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" id="w">pseudonym</a> <b>Jeff Gannon</b> as a <a href="/wiki/White_House" id="w">White House</a> reporter between 2003 and 2005 , representing the <a href="/wiki/Virtual_organization" id="w">virtual organization</a> <a href="/wiki/Talon_News" id="w">Talon News</a>. </p>
<p>Gannon first gained national attention during a presidential press conference on <a href="/wiki/January_26" id="w">January 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, in which he asked <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">United States President</a> <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">George W. Bush</a> a question that some in the press corps considered &#34;so friendly it might have been planted.&#34;<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Gannon stated that this question was not meant to be friendly, but to expose the hypocrisy of the <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" id="w">left</a>.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Gannon then came under public scrutiny, in particular for his lack of a significant journalistic background prior to his work with Talon<sup id="_ref-globefriendly_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-globefriendly" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> and his alleged involvement with various <a href="/wiki/Homosexual" id="w">homosexual</a> <a href="/wiki/Escort_agency" id="w">escort service</a> websites using the professional name <b>Bulldog</b>, he resigned from Talon News on <a href="/wiki/February_8" id="w">February 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>. Continuing to use the name Gannon, he has since created his own official homepage and worked for a time as a columnist for the <i><a href="/wiki/Washington_Blade" id="w">Washington Blade</a></i> newspaper, where he came out as <a href="/wiki/Gay" id="w">gay</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gannon routinely obtained daily passes to White House briefings. He attended four Bush press conferences and appeared regularly at White House press briefings. Although he did not qualify for a Congressional <a href="/wiki/Press_pass" id="w">press pass</a>, Gannon was given daily passes to White House press briefings &#34;after supplying his real name, date of birth and <a href="/wiki/Social_Security_number" id="w">Social Security number</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-washpost218_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washpost218" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gannon currently operates a <a href="/wiki/Blog" id="w">blog</a>, <a class="externallink" href="http://www.jeffgannon.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.jeffgannon.com/">JeffGannon.com</a>, on which he criticizes perceived <a href="/wiki/Double_standard" id="w">double standards</a> used by both the &#34;Old Media&#34; and the &#34;Angry Gay Left.&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> He recently published a book entitled, &#34;The Great Media War.&#34;</p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h1>Background</h1>
<p>Jeff Gannon was a member of the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Chi_Rho" id="w">Alpha Chi Rho</a> fraternity when he attended <a href="/wiki/West_Chester_University_of_Pennsylvania" id="w">West Chester University of Pennsylvania</a> in <a href="/wiki/West_Chester%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">West Chester, Pennsylvania</a>, from which he graduated in 1980.<sup id="_ref-taukappaepsilon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-taukappaepsilon" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Media_career" name="Media_career"></a><h1>Media career</h1>
<a id="White_House_press_credentials" name="White_House_press_credentials"></a><h2>White House press credentials</h2>
<p>Gannon first attended a White House press conference on <a href="/wiki/February_28" id="w">February 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>, and there asked a question of then White House Press Secretary <a href="/wiki/Ari_Fleischer" id="w">Ari Fleischer</a>. At this time Gannon had never had an article published, and was not associated with any kind of news organization (Talon News had not been created yet<sup id="_ref-washpost218_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washpost218" title="">[5]</a></sup>). However, Gannon states that he was editor of his high school student newspaper, as proof of having some journalistic experience. <sup id="_ref-qacafeatnathans_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-qacafeatnathans" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>White House Press Secretary <a href="/wiki/Scott_McClellan" id="w">Scott McClellan</a> later said that there was no breakdown in security and no one intervened on Guckert&#39;s behalf to ensure his access, despite the fact that Gannon had been able to get a press pass for the White House using an assumed name. Gannon&#39;s response was that the <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" id="w">alias</a> Jeff Gannon was a professional name used for convenience, saying that his &#34;real last name is hard to spell and pronounce,&#34; and that the <a href="/wiki/Secret_Service" id="w">Secret Service</a> was aware of his identity.<sup id="_ref-washpost218_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washpost218" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Journalists have said that it can take weeks to get the kind of clearance Gannon received. The <i>Augusta Free Press</i> reported that its acquisition of a single one-day pass was a two-week process.<sup id="_ref-augfpeditorial_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-augfpeditorial" title="">[9]</a></sup>{{Failed verification}} Furthermore, it was said that, highly unusually, Gannon was issued one-day press passes for nearly two years, avoiding the extensive background checks required for permanent passes, and sidestepping Gannon&#39;s inability to gain the necessary Congressional press pass. Gannon applied for a Congressional press pass in April 2004 but was denied one by <a href="/wiki/The_Standing_Committee_of_Correspondents" id="w">The Standing Committee of Correspondents</a>, a group of congressional reporters who oversee press credential distribution on Capitol Hill, on the grounds that Talon did not qualify as a legitimate and independent news service.<sup id="_ref-epsoftballthrower_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-epsoftballthrower" title="">[10]</a></sup> On his resume Gannon said he is a graduate of the Leadership Institute Broadcast School of Journalism, a two day seminar for &#34;conservatives who want a career in journalism.&#34;<sup id="_ref-leadershipinstitute_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-leadershipinstitute" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Talon_News" name="Talon_News"></a><h2>Talon News</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Talon_News" id="w">Talon News</a> is a virtual organization (with no physical office or newsroom) owned by the Web site GOPUSA. &#34;Talon News apparently consists of little more than (Robert) Eberle, (Jeff) Gannon, and a few volunteers, and is virtually indistinguishable from GOPUSA.com,&#34; says the <a href="/wiki/Media_Matters_for_America" id="w">Media Matters for America</a> web site.<sup id="_ref-fosertalon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fosertalon" title="">[12]</a></sup> Robert Eberle is the president and CEO of both GOPUSA and Talon News. This has led to unproven charges that Talon News was created specifically to give Gannon a news organization that he could ostensibly represent, to justify his continuing to work at the White House. By the middle of February 2005, the Talon News website had shut down for an indefinite amount of time, according to the message on that site; on <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, the site indicated the domain is for sale.</p>
<a id="Controversy" name="Controversy"></a><h2>Controversy</h2>
<p>The controversy over Gannon&#39;s background started after President <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">George W. Bush</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/January_26" id="w">January 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> press conference, at which Gannon asked the president the following question:

(<a href="/wiki/Senate_Minority_Leader" id="w">Senate Minority Leader</a>) <a href="/wiki/Harry_Reid" id="w">Harry Reid</a> was talking about soup lines.

<p>Gannon&#39;s question was ridiculed on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Show_with_Jon_Stewart" id="w">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a></i> (which dubbed him &#34;Chip Rightwingenstein of the Bush Agenda Gazette&#34;) and by a number of liberal <a href="/wiki/Blog" id="w">bloggers</a>, who considered it an excessively deferential question for a reporter to ask at a presidential press conference.  Gannon&#39;s question also contained factually inaccurate assertions; the supposed comments about soup lines had not been made by Reid, but had been satirically attributed to him by conservative commentator <a href="/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh" id="w">Rush Limbaugh</a>.<sup id="_ref-globefriendly_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-globefriendly" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/January_26" id="w">January 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> press conference, scrutiny into his personal and professional background by news organizations and blogs began. On <a href="/wiki/February_8" id="w">February 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, Gannon resigned from Talon News and temporarily shut down his website <a class="externallink" href="http://www.jeffgannon.com" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.jeffgannon.com">www.jeffgannon.com</a>. According to the <i>Washington Post</i>: </p>
<p>Howard Kurtz of the <i>Washington Post</i> alleges that, &#34;Jeff Gannon, ... whose naked pictures have appeared on a number of gay escort sites, says that he has &#39;regrets&#39; about his past but that White House officials knew nothing about his salacious activities.&#34;<sup id="_ref-washpost218_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washpost218" title="">[5]</a></sup> Guckert said that he has been stalked<sup id="_ref-cnnblitzertranscript_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cnnblitzertranscript" title="">[13]</a></sup> and that his family has been harassed.<sup id="_ref-Kurtz Feb 15_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kurtz Feb 15" title="">[14]</a></sup> He has revived his website since that time. </p>
<p>Gannon is alleged to have registered several Internet <a href="/wiki/Domain_name" id="w">domain names</a>, including Hotmilitarystud.com and Militaryescorts4m.com<sup id="_ref-Kurtz Feb 15_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kurtz Feb 15" title="">[14]</a></sup> and posted naked pictures of himself. According to <i>The Independent</i>:</p><blockquote>
<p>&#34;Bloggers revealed that Jeff Gannon... had previously worked as a $200-an-hour gay <a href="/wiki/Prostitute" id="w">prostitute</a> who advertised himself on a series of websites with names such as hotmilitary stud.com.&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>When these ads became public, Gannon refused to specifically address them, but admitted that he had made mistakes in his past. <sup id="_ref-washpost218_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washpost218" title="">[5]</a></sup>

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2004" id="w">2004 election</a>, he wrote that <a href="/wiki/John_Kerry" id="w">John Kerry</a> &#34;might someday be known as &#39;the first gay president&#39;&#34; and that Kerry had supported &#34;the <a href="/wiki/Gay_agenda" id="w">pro-gay agenda</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-washpost218_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washpost218" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cliff Kincaid, editor of the conservative Accuracy in Media report, wrote that &#34;(t)he campaign against Gannon demonstrates the paranoid mentality and mean-spirited nature of the political left.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Kurtz Feb 15_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kurtz Feb 15" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

These documents related to the security investigations and background checks involved in granting access to the White House of James D. Guckert (also known as Jeff Gannon). The documents were to be transmitted no later than 14 days after the date of the adoption of the resolution.</p>
<p>During the Committee meeting Democratic Rep. <a href="/wiki/Sheila_Jackson_Lee" id="w">Sheila Jackson Lee</a> claimed that Gannon had engaged in &#34;a penetration of the White House, maybe a security breach, and I do not believe it can be answered with self-investigation. <sup id="_ref-HORSI_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HORSI" title="">[22]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
