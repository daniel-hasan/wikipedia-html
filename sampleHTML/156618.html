<p><b>Crawley</b> ({{Audio}}) is a town and <a href="/wiki/Local_government_district" id="w">local government district</a> with <a href="/wiki/Borough_status_in_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Borough status</a> in <a href="/wiki/West_Sussex" id="w">West Sussex</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>.

It is bordered by the West Sussex <a href="/wiki/Local_authority" id="w">local authority areas</a> of <a href="/wiki/Mid_Sussex" id="w">Mid Sussex</a> and <a href="/wiki/Horsham_(district)" id="w">Horsham</a> districts, and the <a href="/wiki/Mole_Valley" id="w">Mole Valley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tandridge" id="w">Tandridge</a> districts and the <a href="/wiki/Reigate_and_Banstead" id="w">Borough of Reigate and Banstead</a> in the county of <a href="/wiki/Surrey" id="w">Surrey</a>.</p>
<p>Although the area was inhabited <a href="/wiki/Three-age_system" id="w">from the Stone Age onwards</a>, and was a centre of iron-making in Roman times, Crawley developed slowly as a market town until the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a>.  The area was designated as the site of one of the &#34;new towns&#34; proposed by the <a href="/wiki/New_Towns_Act_1946" id="w">New Towns Act 1946</a>, however, and rapid development ensued — with the growth of nearby <a href="/wiki/Gatwick_Airport" id="w">Gatwick Airport</a> adding to this.</p>
<p>The town comprises 13 planned &#34;neighbourhoods&#34; (residential areas), separated by main roads and railway lines, and based around the core of the old market town.  The nearby communities of <a href="/wiki/Ifield%2C_Crawley" id="w">Ifield</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pound_Hill%2C_Crawley" id="w">Pound Hill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Three_Bridges" id="w">Three Bridges</a> were absorbed into the new town.  Some expansion is currently planned for the west and northwest boundaries of the town, in co-operation with <a href="/wiki/Horsham" id="w">Horsham</a> District Council.<sup id="_ref-wnw_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wnw" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<a id="Origins" name="Origins"></a><h2>Origins</h2>
<p>Crawley has its origins in <a href="/wiki/Stone_Age" id="w">Stone Age</a> settlements some 7,000 years ago.<sup id="_ref-cbchist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cbchist" title="">[2]</a></sup> Evidence of habitation in the region includes <a href="/wiki/Neolithic" id="w">Neolithic</a> tools, <a href="/wiki/Roman_Britain" id="w">Roman</a> ironworks and even a <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Age" id="w">Bronze Age</a> sword.<sup id="_ref-cole_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cole" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>There is some evidence that the area was settled in the <a href="/wiki/Mesolithic" id="w">Mesolithic</a> period, with examples of locally-manufactured flints of the <a href="/wiki/Horsham_Culture" id="w">Horsham Culture</a> type found to the south-west of the town. Evidence also exists of <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Age" id="w">Bronze Age</a> burial mounds just to the south of the town, suggesting some habitation in that period. Other finds suggest continued habitation through Roman times.<sup id="_ref-cole_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cole" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the 5th century, Saxon settlers gave the area its name of Crow&#39;s Leah — meaning a crow-infested clearing, or Crow&#39;s Wood<sup id="_ref-cole_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cole" title="">[3]</a></sup> — although the name changed considerably over time, with the present spelling arriving by the early 14th century.<sup id="_ref-cbchist_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cbchist" title="">[2]</a></sup> By this time, nearby settlements were more established, with the Saxon church at <a href="/wiki/Worth%2C_West_Sussex" id="w">Worth</a> dating from around 1000.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Domesday_Book" id="w">Domesday Book</a>, while the town itself is not mentioned, both <a href="/wiki/Ifield%2C_Crawley" id="w">Ifield</a> and <a href="/wiki/Worth%2C_West_Sussex" id="w">Worth</a> are recorded. The first written record of Crawley is found in the granting of a right to hold a market in the town in 1202. Issued by <a href="/wiki/King_John" id="w">King John</a>, this allowed for a weekly market on Wednesdays.<sup id="_ref-miscellany_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-miscellany" title="">[4]</a></sup> As time passed, the importance of the town grew slowly, boosted in the 18th century by the popularity of <a href="/wiki/Brighton" id="w">Brighton</a>; Crawley prospered as a coaching halt offering an almost hourly service to Brighton and London.<sup id="_ref-cole_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cole" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-pigot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pigot" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The George, a <a href="/wiki/Timber_framing" id="w">timber-framed</a> house dating from the 15th century, expanded over the years to take over adjacent buildings and become a large coaching inn.  The increase in Brighton&#39;s popularity, and Crawley&#39;s location halfway between it and London, meant that an annexe had to be built in the middle of the wide High Street; this survived until the 1930s.<sup id="_ref-George_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-George" title="">[6]</a></sup>  Now known as the George Hotel, it retains many original features, including an iron <a href="/wiki/Fireplace#Accessories" id="w">fireback</a>, and has conference facilities and 84 bedrooms.<sup id="_ref-townwalk_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-townwalk" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Hotel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hotel" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">St John the Baptist church from the east.</div>
Crawley&#39;s oldest church is St John the Baptist, between the High Street and the Broadway.  It has 13th century origins,<sup id="_ref-StJB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-StJB" title="">[9]</a></sup> but there has been much rebuilding (especially in the 19th century) and the oldest part now remaining is the south wall of the <a href="/wiki/Nave" id="w">nave</a>, which is believed to be 14th century.  The church has a <a href="/wiki/Bell_tower" id="w">tower</a> (originally 15th century, but rebuilt in 1804) containing two bells cast in 1742.<sup id="_ref-MoreStJB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MoreStJB" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Railway_age_and_Victorian_era" name="Railway_age_and_Victorian_era"></a><h2>Railway age and Victorian era</h2>
<p>The railways first came to Crawley by way of the <a href="/wiki/Brighton_Main_Line" id="w">Brighton Main Line</a> passing through a station at <a href="/wiki/Three_Bridges" id="w">Three Bridges</a> in the summer of 1841. At first this station was known as East Crawley,<sup id="_ref-eastcrawley_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eastcrawley" title="">[11]</a></sup> but the opening of the <a href="/wiki/Arun_Valley_Line" id="w">Horsham branch</a> in 1848 allowed a new <a href="/wiki/Crawley_railway_station" id="w">Crawley railway station</a> to be built more centrally, at the southern end of the High Street. A line to <a href="/wiki/East_Grinstead_railway_station" id="w">East Grinstead</a> was opened in 1855. By this stage, Three Bridges was becoming the hub of transport in the area, with one-quarter of its population being employed in railway jobs by 1861 (mainly at the <a href="/wiki/London%2C_Brighton_and_South_Coast_Railway" id="w">London, Brighton and South Coast Railway</a>&#39;s railway works near the station);<sup id="_ref-fredgray_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fredgray" title="">[12]</a></sup> but once the line reached Crawley itself, transport for both people and commodities was much improved. The locally-famous Longley family set up business alongside the line in 1881; at this time, the town experienced a major expansion in housebuilding, including the creation of an area known as &#34;New Town&#34; (unrelated to the postwar developments) around the railway <a href="/wiki/Level_crossing" id="w">level crossing</a> and down the Brighton Road.<sup id="_ref-cole_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cole" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-fredgray_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fredgray" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era" id="w">Victorian</a> period the town continued to grow, with considerable building in the <a href="/wiki/West_Green%2C_Crawley" id="w">West Green</a> area and some development south of the railway in what is now <a href="/wiki/Southgate%2C_Crawley" id="w">Southgate</a>. In 1891, a racecourse was opened at Gatwick, with the <a href="/wiki/Grand_National" id="w">Grand National</a> being held there during the years of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">First World War</a>.<sup id="_ref-cbchist_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cbchist" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the 20th century arrived, considerable development continued around the town centre. Additionally, land near the racecourse was developed as an airfield, opening in 1930. The airport continued as a private concern until the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">Second World War</a> when it was claimed by the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" id="w">Royal Air Force</a>.<sup id="_ref-cbchist_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cbchist" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Around this time, many of the large 19th century <a href="/wiki/Estate_(house)" id="w">country estates</a> in the area, with their <a href="/wiki/Mansion" id="w">mansions</a> and associated grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land which attracted haphazard housing development and small farms.<sup id="_ref-fredgray_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fredgray" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the <a href="/wiki/First_World_War" id="w">First World War</a>, Crawley had matured into a small but prosperous town, serving a wide rural area as well as its own population and those passing through on the <a href="/wiki/A23_road" id="w">A23</a> London–Brighton road; three-quarters of the population had piped water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and piped gas and street lighting had been in place for 50 years.<sup id="_ref-fredgray_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fredgray" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>The area around Crawley was officially identified as a suitable location for a <a href="/wiki/New_Town" id="w">New Town</a> in May 1946, but not officially designated as such until <a href="/wiki/9_January" id="w">9 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a>. At the time of designation, the 5,920 acres (2,395 hectares) of land set aside for the new town were split across the county borders between <a href="/wiki/East_Sussex" id="w">East Sussex</a>, <a href="/wiki/West_Sussex" id="w">West Sussex</a> and <a href="/wiki/Surrey" id="w">Surrey</a>. Architect <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Bennett_(architect)" id="w">Thomas Bennett</a> was appointed as the chairman of the Development Corporation for the town. A court challenge to the designation order meant that plans were not officially confirmed until December 1947. By this time, an initial plan for the development of the area had been drawn up by planner <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Minoprio" id="w">Anthony Minoprio</a>.<sup id="_ref-vic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vic" title="">[13]</a></sup> The plans sought to fill in the gaps between the villages of Crawley, <a href="/wiki/Ifield%2C_Crawley" id="w">Ifield</a> and <a href="/wiki/Three_Bridges" id="w">Three Bridges</a> to form a larger town population.<sup id="_ref-cbc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cbc" title="">[14]</a></sup> At the time, Bennett estimated that planning, designing and building the town, and increasing its population from the existing 9,500, would take 15 years.<sup id="_ref-13years_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13years" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Work began almost immediately, preparing the groundwork for the expansion of the town, with a full master plan in place by 1949. This plan saw an extension in the planned population of the town from 40,000 to 50,000, with residential properties shared between 9 neighbourhoods radiating from the town centre, and a separate industrial area to the north of the town.<sup id="_ref-vic_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vic" title="">[13]</a></sup> The plans for the neighbourhoods included mainly 3-bedroom family homes, with a number of smaller and larger properties. Each neighbourhood was to be built around a centre which contained shops, a <a href="/wiki/Church_(building)" id="w">church</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Public_house" id="w">public house</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Primary_school" id="w">primary school</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Community_centre" id="w">community centre</a>.<sup id="_ref-cbc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cbc" title="">[14]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Secondary_education" id="w">Secondary education</a> was to be provided at three campuses across the town at <a href="/wiki/Ifield%2C_Crawley" id="w">Ifield Green</a>, <a href="/wiki/Three_Bridges" id="w">Three Bridges</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tilgate%2C_Crawley" id="w">Tilgate</a>.<sup id="_ref-plan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-plan" title="">[16]</a></sup> Later, a fourth campus was added to the plans in <a href="/wiki/Southgate%2C_Crawley" id="w">Southgate</a> for the building of <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" id="w">Roman Catholic</a> schools.<sup id="_ref-masterplan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-masterplan" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

Development began quickly in the town, although at first no town centre building was begun — the existing high street being used for shopping. Earliest progress was in <a href="/wiki/West_Green%2C_Crawley" id="w">West Green</a> with residents moving in during the late 1940s. In 1950 the town was visited by the then heir to the throne, <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Princess Elizabeth</a>, when she officially opened the <a href="/wiki/Manor_Royal%2C_Crawley" id="w">Manor Royal</a> industrial area. Work continued eastwards in the town, with building taking place in <a href="/wiki/West_Green%2C_Crawley" id="w">West Green</a>, <a href="/wiki/Northgate%2C_Crawley" id="w">Northgate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Three_Bridges" id="w">Three Bridges</a>, and then more widely in <a href="/wiki/Langley_Green%2C_Crawley" id="w">Langley Green</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pound_Hill%2C_Crawley" id="w">Pound Hill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ifield%2C_Crawley" id="w">Ifield</a>.<sup id="_ref-vic_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vic" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>As early as 1956, it was clear that the original proposals for a population of 40,000 were insufficient to match the growth of the town, and so land at &#34;Tilgate East&#34; was allocated for housing use, eventually becoming the new neighbourhood of <a href="/wiki/Furnace_Green%2C_Crawley" id="w">Furnace Green</a>.<sup id="_ref-vic_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vic" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Developments in the town centre saw the planning of extended shopping facilities to the east of the existing high street. The first stage to open was The Broadwalk in 1954, following by the official opening of the Queen&#39;s Square development by <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Her Majesty The Queen</a> in 1958. Crawley railway station was moved eastwards towards the new development.<sup id="_ref-vic_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vic" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>The provision of public services was made in co-operation with the local authorities, who oversaw the opening of a fire station in 1958, the telephone exchange, police station and town centre health clinic in 1961 and the ambulance station in 1963. Plans for a new hospital on land at the Hawth were abandoned, however, and the hospital was redeveloped on its existing site.<sup id="_ref-vic_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vic" title="">[13]</a></sup>  Gas was initially supplied by pipelines from  <a href="/wiki/Croydon" id="w">Croydon</a>, 20 miles (32 km) away, while the town&#39;s water supply came from the <a href="/wiki/Weir_Wood" id="w">Weir Wood</a> reservoir south of East Grinstead.<sup id="_ref-oldphotos_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oldphotos" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>By April 1960, when Thomas Bennett made his last presentation as chairman of the Development Corporation, the town&#39;s population had reached 51,700; 2,289,000 ft² (212,650 m²) of factory and other industrial space had been provided; 21,800 people were employed, with nearly 60% of jobs being in manufacturing industry; and only seventy people were registered as unemployed.  The Corporation had built 10,254 houses, with around 1,500 more being constructed by private builders.  The Corporation permitted residents to buy their houses, and 440 householders had chosen to do so by April 1960.<sup id="_ref-13years_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13years" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Subsequent_expansion" name="Subsequent_expansion"></a><h4>Subsequent expansion</h4>
<p>With the success of early developments, a new plan was put forward by West Sussex County Council in 1961. This proposed new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Plans were drawn up for Broadfield in the late 1960s, with some development in place by the early 1970s. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development here was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than previous ones, with a combined proposed population of 23,000. Work also took place in the area now known as Ifield West on the western fringes of the town.<sup id="_ref-vicdates_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vicdates" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>As early as 1980, the council identified land at Maidenbower as being suitable for further expansion of the town to accommodate the growing population, and work began in 1986. However, all of the development at Maidenbower was undertaken privately, unlike the previous developments which had included largely council-owned accommodation.<sup id="_ref-vicdates_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vicdates" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1999, plans were in place to develop a fourteenth neighbourhood on land at Tinsley Green to the northeast of the existing town. However, these were halted due to proposals for possible expansion at <a href="/wiki/London_Gatwick_Airport" id="w">Gatwick Airport</a>.<sup id="_ref-nesector_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nesector" title="">[20]</a></sup> Discussions are now underway in co-operation with <a href="/wiki/Horsham" id="w">Horsham</a> District Council for possible location of new housing on Crawley&#39;s western fringes.<sup id="_ref-wnw_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wnw" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Crawley Urban District Council was formed in April 1956. It was formed from that part of the Horsham Rural District which fell within the new town&#39;s area. Changes under the <a href="/wiki/Local_Government_Act_1972" id="w">Local Government Act 1972</a> saw the district formed as a borough in April 1974, gaining a mayor for the first time. </p>
<p>The borough was awarded a <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_arms" id="w">coat of arms</a> later in 1974. It features a central cross on a shield, representing the town&#39;s location at the meeting point of north-south and east-west roads. The shield also features nine <a href="/wiki/Martlet" id="w">martlets</a> representing both the county of <a href="/wiki/Sussex" id="w">Sussex</a> and the new town&#39;s original nine neighbourhoods. Supporters, of an eagle and a winged lion, relate to the significance of the airport to the locality. The motto featured is <i>I Grow and I Rejoice</i>.<sup id="_ref-arms_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-arms" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Initially the district (and then borough) council worked with the <a href="/wiki/Commission_for_the_New_Towns" id="w">Commission for the New Towns</a> on many aspects of development, but in 1978, many of the commission&#39;s assets, such as housing and parks, were surrendered to the local authority. The authority&#39;s boundaries were extended in 1983 to allow for increasing development in Bewbush and Broadfield.<sup id="_ref-guide_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guide" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>The borough remains part of the local two-tier arrangements, with services shared with West Sussex County Council. The authority is divided into 15 wards, each of which is represented by two or three local councillors, forming a total council of 37 members. Most wards are coterminous with the borough&#39;s neighbourhoods, but two neighbourhoods are divided: Broadfield into North and South wards, and Pound Hill into &#34;Pound Hill North&#34; and &#34;Pound Hill South and Worth&#34;. The council is elected in thirds.<sup id="_ref-bcfe_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bcfe" title="">[23]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">As of the 2007</a> local elections, the authority is <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)" id="w">Conservative</a>-controlled, with seats allocated as follows:

<div class="thumbcaption">Neighbourhoods of Crawley, identified in the table below.</div>
There are 13 residential neighbourhoods, each consisting of a variety of housing types: terraced, semi-detached and detached houses, low-rise flats and bungalows.  The clay soil beneath Crawley made high-rise &#34;tower block&#34; developments of flats relatively unattractive due to the cost of stabilising the ground.  Each neighbourhood is based around a shopping parade, community centre and church, with schools and areas of open space also available.  The Development Corporation&#39;s intention was for neighbourhood shops to cater only to basic needs, with the town centre to be used for most shopping requirements, and the number of shop units provided in the neighbourhood parades reflected this: despite the master plan making provision for at least 20 shops in each neighbourhood,<sup id="_ref-econhist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-econhist" title="">[33]</a></sup> the number actually built ranged from 19 in the outlying Langley Green neighbourhood to just seven in West Green, close to the town centre.<sup id="_ref-13years_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13years" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Each of the 13 residential neighbourhoods is identified by a colour, which is shown on street name signs in a standard format throughout the town: the street name is displayed in black on a white background, with a coloured strip below it bearing the name of the neighbourhood in white text.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

There are also some areas which are not neighbourhoods but which are closely associated with Crawley:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Manor_Royal%2C_Crawley" id="w">Manor Royal</a> industrial estate is in the north of the town.  Although it is part of the Northgate ward, it is also allocated a colour: its streets feature the word &#34;INDUSTRIAL&#34; on a black background.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Gatwick_Airport" id="w">Gatwick Airport</a> was built on the site of a manor house, Gatwick Manor, which was situated close to the village of <a href="/wiki/Lowfield_Heath" id="w">Lowfield Heath</a>.  Most of the village was demolished when the airport expanded, but some buildings, including St Michael&#39;s church,<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> remain.  These lie on the airport&#39;s southern boundary, between the perimeter road and the A23 close to Manor Royal.  In the picture, the road to the left, <i>Old Brighton Road South</i>, is truncated abruptly at the airport boundary, a short distance from the runway.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Worth%2C_West_Sussex" id="w">Worth</a> was originally a village with its own civil parish, lying just beyond the eastern edge of the Crawley urban area and borough boundary;<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> but development of the Pound Hill and Maidenbower neighbourhoods has filled in the gaps, and the borough boundary has been extended to include the whole of the village.  The civil parish of Worth remains, albeit reduced in size, and it is part of the Mid Sussex district.</li></ul>

<p>Before the new town was developed, Crawley traded as a traditional market town. Plans were soon in place to develop the town as a centre for manufacturing, and light engineering, with a dedicated and purpose-built industrial zone.<sup id="_ref-ind_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ind" title="">[49]</a></sup> In time, this industry developed to encompass newer technologies, and the rapid growth of Gatwick Airport provided further opportunities. The significance of the airport in terms of local employment and enterprise is recognised in the formation of the <a href="/wiki/Gatwick_Diamond" id="w">Gatwick Diamond</a> partnership which recognises the airport as a hub of employment and economic growth.<sup id="_ref-gatdiamond_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gatdiamond" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the boom of the 1980s the town boasted the lowest level of unemployment in the UK.<sup id="_ref-hansard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hansard" title="">[51]</a></sup> Unemployment has been typically low in the town, with rates at around 1.47% of the working-age population in 2003.<sup id="_ref-unemployment_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-unemployment" title="">[52]</a></sup> However, there are some discrepancies in areas of under-supply, with the Banking and Finance fields having the greatest numbers of vacancies.<sup id="_ref-ind_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ind" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Manufacturing_industry" name="Manufacturing_industry"></a><h2>Manufacturing industry</h2>
<p>By the time the new town was developed, Crawley was already a modest industrial centre.  Building was an important trade, with 800 people being employed by building and joinery firms — two, Longley&#39;s and Cook&#39;s, were large enough to have their own factories.<sup id="_ref-fredgray_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fredgray" title="">[12]</a></sup>  In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing, with light and precision engineering and aircraft repair being the main industries.  Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.<sup id="_ref-fredgray_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fredgray" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-econhist_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-econhist" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Industrial development had to take place relatively early in the life of the new town because part of the Corporation&#39;s remit was to move people and jobs out of an overcrowded and war-damaged London, and industrial jobs were needed as well as houses and shops to create a balanced community where people could settle.<sup id="_ref-NTA1946_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NTA1946" title="">[53]</a></sup>  The Development Corporation wanted the new town to support a large and mixed industrial base, with factories and other buildings based in a single zone rather than spread throughout the town.  A 267-acre (108-hectare)<sup id="_ref-NTA1946_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NTA1946" title="">[53]</a></sup> site in the northeastern part of the development area was chosen; its advantages included flat land with no existing development; proximity to the London–Brighton railway line, the A23 and the planned M23; space for railway sidings (which were eventually built on a much smaller scale than envisaged); and an adjacent 44-acre (18-hectare) site reserved for future expansion, on the other side of the railway line (again, not used for this purpose in the end).  <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Princess Elizabeth</a> (later Queen Elizabeth II) opened the first part of the industrial area on <a href="/wiki/25_January" id="w">25 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1950" id="w">1950</a>;<sup id="_ref-miscellany_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-miscellany" title="">[4]</a></sup> its main road was named Manor Royal, and this name eventually came to refer to the whole estate.<sup id="_ref-econhist_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-econhist" title="">[33]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The Corporation stipulated that several different <a href="/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_economic_activity" id="w">manufacturing industries</a> should be developed, rather than allowing one sector or firm to dominate.  It did not seek to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives; instead, it set out to create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally, by providing large plots of land with room for expansion, allowing firms to build their own premises or to rent ready-made buildings, and constructing a wide range of building types and sizes.<sup id="_ref-econhist_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-econhist" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-fredgray_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fredgray" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the lack of direct incentives, many firms applied to move to the Manor Royal estate: it was considered such an attractive place to relocate to that the Development Corporation was able to choose between applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms, and little advertising or promotion had to be undertaken.  One year after Manor Royal was opened, eighteen firms were trading there, including four with more than 100 employees and one with more than 1,000.<sup id="_ref-econhist_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-econhist" title="">[33]</a></sup>  By 1964, businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500.  Nearly 20,000 were employed in 105 &#34;new&#34; firms in 1978.<sup id="_ref-econhist_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-econhist" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-fredgray_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fredgray" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Service_industry_and_commerce" name="Service_industry_and_commerce"></a><h2>Service industry and commerce</h2>
<p>While most of the new jobs created in the new town&#39;s early years were in manufacturing, the <a href="/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_economic_activity" id="w">tertiary sector</a> developed strongly from the 1960s onwards.  The Manor Royal estate, with its space, proximity to Gatwick and good transport links, attracted airport-related services such as logistics, catering, distribution and warehousing; and the Corporation and private companies built many offices throughout the town.  Office floorspace in the town increased from 55,000 ft² (5,100 m²) in 1965 to a conservative estimate of 453,000 ft² (42,000 m²) in 1984;<sup id="_ref-econhist_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-econhist" title="">[33]</a></sup> this figure has risen further since then.  Major office developments during these years included premises for the <a href="/wiki/Natwest" id="w">Westminster Bank</a> (later part of NatWest), <a href="/wiki/British_Caledonian" id="w">British Caledonian</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Paymaster-General" id="w">The Office of the Paymaster-General</a> — a government ministry within the remit of <a href="/wiki/HM_Treasury" id="w">HM Treasury</a>.<sup id="_ref-econhist_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-econhist" title="">[33]</a></sup>  The five-storey Overline House above the railway station, completed in 1968, is used by Crawley&#39;s <a href="/wiki/NHS_Primary_Care_Trust" id="w">NHS Primary Care Trust</a> and various other companies.<sup id="_ref-nhs_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nhs" title="">[54]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-otheroverlinecos_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-otheroverlinecos" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>

<p>Even before the new town was planned, Crawley had some local importance as a retail centre: there were 177 shops in the town in 1948,<sup id="_ref-fredgray_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fredgray" title="">[12]</a></sup> 99 of which were on the High Street.<sup id="_ref-econhist_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-econhist" title="">[33]</a></sup>  Its significance grew as the Corporation developed the town centre as a major shopping venue: 150 new shops were provided on previously mostly undeveloped land to the east of the High Street and north of the railway line.<sup id="_ref-NTA1946_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NTA1946" title="">[53]</a></sup>  Its main intention was to integrate the town centre development closely with the surrounding residential neighbourhoods, so that relatively few (and basic) shops would be required in the neighbourhoods themselves, and to maintain the character and ambience of the old High Street.<sup id="_ref-13years_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13years" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NTA1946_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NTA1946" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>Early new town residents relied on the existing shopping facilities until the building of The Broadwalk in 1954, with 23 shops, and then the Queen&#39;s Square complex and surrounding streets in the mid-1950s.<sup id="_ref-vicdates_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vicdates" title="">[19]</a></sup>.  Queen&#39;s Square, a pedestrianised plaza surrounded by large shops and linked to the High Street by The Broadwalk, was officially opened in 1958 by Queen Elizabeth II.<sup id="_ref-fredgray_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fredgray" title="">[12]</a></sup>  The town centre was completed by 1960, by which time Crawley was already recognised as an important regional, rather than merely local, shopping centre.</p>

<p>Crawley&#39;s early development as a market town was helped by its location on the London–Brighton <a href="/wiki/Turnpike" id="w">turnpike</a>.  The area was joined to the <a href="/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Great_Britain" id="w">railway network</a> in the mid-19th century; and since the creation of the new town, there have been major road upgrades (including a <a href="/wiki/Motorway" id="w">motorway</a> link), a <a href="/wiki/Guided_bus" id="w">guided bus</a> transit system and the establishment of an <a href="/wiki/Airport" id="w">airport</a> which has become one of Britain&#39;s largest and busiest.</p>

<p>The London–Brighton turnpike ran through the centre of Crawley, forming the High Street and Station Road.  When Britain&#39;s major roads were classified by the British government&#39;s Ministry of Transport between 1919 and 1923,<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> it was given the number <b><a href="/wiki/A23_road" id="w">A23</a></b>.  This was bypassed first by a new dual carriageway in 1939 (which forms the A23&#39;s current route through the town), and then later to the east side of the town by the <b><a href="/wiki/M23_motorway" id="w">M23 motorway</a></b>, which was opened in 1975.  This connects London&#39;s orbital motorway, the <a href="/wiki/M25_motorway" id="w">M25</a>, to the A23 at <a href="/wiki/Pease_Pottage" id="w">Pease Pottage</a>, at the southern edge of Crawley&#39;s built-up area.  The original single-carriageway road A23 is now numbered the <b>A2219</b>.  </p>

The A2011, another dual-carriageway, joins the A23 in West Green, and provides a link, via the <b>A2004</b>, to the town centre.

Gatwick Airport was originally opened as a private airfield in the 1930s.

There were proposals to close the airport by the late 1940s, but these were altered. It closed in 1956 to enable it to be rebuilt as a second airport for London. The new airport was opened by <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Her Majesty The Queen</a> on <a href="/wiki/9_June" id="w">9 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1958" id="w">1958</a>.

An agreement exists between <a href="/wiki/BAA_plc" id="w">BAA plc</a> and West Sussex County Council preventing the building of a further runway until 2019. Nevertheless, consultations were launched in 2002 by the <a href="/wiki/Department_for_Transport" id="w">Department for Transport</a> which included possible proposals for the building of additional facilities and runways at the airport. The result of the consultation was to preclude any further expansion at Gatwick unless it was impossible to meet growth targets at <a href="/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport" id="w">London Heathrow Airport</a> within existing pollution limits.<sup id="_ref-dft_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dft" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>

<p>There were many sports clubs which predated the new town.  <a href="/wiki/Crawley_Town_F.C." id="w">Crawley Town F.C.</a>, formed in 1896, was given a home in the new town at Town Mead adjacent to the <a href="/wiki/West_Green" id="w">West Green</a> playing fields.
