<p><b>Michael Henderson</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Bassist" id="w">bassist</a> and vocalist best known for his work with <a href="/wiki/Miles_Davis" id="w">Miles Davis</a> in the early 1970s, providing a deep funky groove to early <a href="/wiki/Jazz_fusion" id="w">fusion</a> albums such as <a href="/wiki/A_Tribute_to_Jack_Johnson" id="w">A Tribute to Jack Johnson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pangaea_(album)" id="w">Pangaea (album)</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Live-Evil" id="w">Live-Evil</a>.  He was the only musician to play with Miles in both phases of his electric period, starting in 1970 at the age of 18 and continuing until Miles&#39;s semi-retirement in 1976.  </p>
<p>With deep, funky grooves and a pop sensibility, he was one of the first notable bassists of the fusion era as well as being one of the most influential <a href="/wiki/Jazz" id="w">jazz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" id="w">soul</a> musicians of the past 40 years.  In addition to Miles, he has played and recorded with <a href="/wiki/Marvin_Gaye" id="w">Marvin Gaye</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aretha_Franklin" id="w">Aretha Franklin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stevie_Wonder" id="w">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Dramatics" id="w">the Dramatics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Doctor_John" id="w">Doctor John</a>, and others.  He is considered to be one of the three greatest <a href="/wiki/Motown" id="w">Motown</a> bassists, along with <a href="/wiki/Bob_Babbitt" id="w">Bob Babbitt</a> and his primary influence, <a href="/wiki/James_Jamerson" id="w">James Jamerson</a>.</p>
<p>Before working with Miles, Henderson had been touring with <a href="/wiki/Stevie_Wonder" id="w">Stevie Wonder</a>, whom he met at <a href="/wiki/The_Regal" id="w">the Regal</a> in Chicago while warming up for a gig.  <a href="/wiki/Miles_Davis" id="w">Miles Davis</a> saw the young Henderson performing at the <a href="/wiki/Copacabana_(nightclub)" id="w">Copacabana</a> in New York in early 1970 and reportedly said to Wonder simply &#34;I&#39;m takin&#39; your fuckin&#39; bass player.&#34;</p>
<p>After almost seven years with Miles, Henderson focused on songwriting and singing in a solo career that produced multiple hit songs and albums for <a href="/wiki/Arista_Records" id="w">Arista Records</a> until his retirement in 1986.  Although known primarily for ballads, he was an influential <a href="/wiki/Funk" id="w">funk</a> player whose riffs and songs have been widely covered.  To date his solo recordings have sold well over one million albums.  </p>
<p>In recent years, he has experienced a resurgence in popularity as many of his bass riffs have been imitated by players seeking the fat, deep grooves of the <a href="/wiki/Motown" id="w">motown</a> sound.  His bass riffs, from such hits as &#34;Valentine Love&#34; and &#34;You are my Starship,&#34; have been sampled by the likes of <a href="/wiki/Snoop_Dogg" id="w">Snoop Dogg</a> and <a href="/wiki/L.L._Cool_J" id="w">L.L. Cool J</a>, and his songs have been covered by <a href="/wiki/Rick_James" id="w">Rick James</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wayman_Tisdale" id="w">Wayman Tisdale</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sugar_Ray" id="w">Sugar Ray</a>, among others.</p>
<p>He currently lives in Las Vegas and plays shows intermittently of his solo material as well as that of other motown and soul musicians.  He has also played reunion concerts with other former members of the Miles electric bands.</p>
