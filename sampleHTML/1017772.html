{{Infobox Album }}
<b><i>Love. Angel. Music. Baby.</i></b> is the debut solo album by <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Pop_music" id="w">pop</a> singer <a href="/wiki/Gwen_Stefani" id="w">Gwen Stefani</a>, released by <a href="/wiki/Interscope_Records" id="w">Interscope Records</a> in November 2004 (see <a href="/wiki/2004_in_music" id="w">2004 in music</a>). The album originally began as a small side project for the <a href="/wiki/No_Doubt" id="w">No Doubt</a> frontwoman, but grew into a large production with numerous collaborations and producers.</p>
<p>The album was designed as an updated version of an 1980s music record, and was influenced by artists such as <a href="/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer)" id="w">Madonna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lisa_Lisa_and_Cult_Jam" id="w">Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Club_Nouveau" id="w">Club Nouveau</a>. Most of the songs on the record focus on fashion and wealth. The album introduced the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Harajuku_Girls" id="w">Harajuku Girls</a>&#34;, four backup dancers who dress in Stefani&#39;s interpretation of the youth fashion trends of <a href="/wiki/Harajuku" id="w">Harajuku</a>, a district in <a href="/wiki/Tokyo" id="w">Tokyo</a>.</p>
<p>Despite gathering mostly positive reviews, <i>L.A.M.B.</i> received criticism for its many collaborations and superficial lyrical content. The album yielded six <a href="/wiki/Single_(music)" id="w">singles</a> and had high sales, going <a href="/wiki/Multi-platinum" id="w">multi-platinum</a> in several countries, and selling seven million copies. It earned Stefani several <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award" id="w">Grammy Award</a> nominations in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<a id="Conception_and_production" name="Conception_and_production"></a><h1>Conception and production</h1>
<p>During Stefani&#39;s time with <a href="/wiki/No_Doubt" id="w">No Doubt</a>, she began making solo appearances on albums by artists including <a href="/wiki/Eve_(rapper)" id="w">Eve</a>, <a href="/wiki/Moby" id="w">Moby</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Prince_(musician)" id="w">Prince</a>. In the production of its 2001 album <i><a href="/wiki/Rock_Steady_(album)" id="w">Rock Steady</a></i>, No Doubt collaborated with <a href="/wiki/Prince_(musician)" id="w">Prince</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Neptunes" id="w">The Neptunes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/David_A._Stewart" id="w">David A. Stewart</a> on different songs and had <a href="/wiki/Mark_%26quot%3BSpike%26quot%3B_Stent" id="w">Mark &#34;Spike&#34; Stent</a> <a href="/wiki/Audio_mixing" id="w">mix</a> the album. While the band was on tour to promote the album, Stefani listened to <a href="/wiki/Club_Nouveau" id="w">Club Nouveau</a>&#39;s 1987 single &#34;<a href="/wiki/Why_You_Treat_Me_So_Bad" id="w">Why You Treat Me So Bad</a>&#34; and considered recording material that modernized 1980s music.<sup id="_ref-scared_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scared" title="">[1]</a></sup>  She approached No Doubt <a href="/wiki/Bassist" id="w">bassist</a> and former boyfriend <a href="/wiki/Tony_Kanal" id="w">Tony Kanal</a>, who had introduced her to music by Prince, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, and <a href="/wiki/Debbie_Deb" id="w">Debbie Deb</a>, and they talked about producing songs from Kanal&#39;s bedroom.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In early <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>, Stefani began recording solo material.<sup id="_ref-recording_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-recording" title="">[3]</a></sup>  She stated that she was considering recording singles to be used on soundtracks, later playing <a href="/wiki/Jean_Harlow" id="w">Jean Harlow</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Aviator" id="w">The Aviator</a></i>; continuing her series of collaborations; or releasing an album under the pseudonym GS.<sup id="_ref-recording_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-recording" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hb" title="">[4]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Iovine" id="w">Jimmy Iovine</a>, chairman and co-founder of Interscope, convinced Stefani to produce a complete studio album.<sup id="_ref-hb_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hb" title="">[4]</a></sup>  During her first sessions with <a href="/wiki/Linda_Perry" id="w">Linda Perry</a>, Stefani&#39;s combination of self-consciousness and <a href="/wiki/Writer%26%2339%3Bs_block" id="w">writer&#39;s block</a> resulted in an unfruitful attempt. On the second day, the two wrote a song about Stefani&#39;s writer&#39;s block and fear to make her solo album, which became &#34;<a href="/wiki/What_You_Waiting_For%3F" id="w">What You Waiting For?</a>&#34;, the lead single.<sup id="_ref-scared_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scared" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>When the two began working on a song that Stefani stated was too personal, she left to visit Kanal. He played her a track on which he had been working and which became &#34;<a href="/wiki/Crash_(Gwen_Stefani_song)" id="w">Crash</a>&#34;, another single from the album. The two tried to write new material, but gave up after two weeks. They did not return to work until six months later, when Stefani began collaborating with other artists, commenting, &#34;If I were to write the chorus of &#39;<a href="/wiki/Yesterday_(song)" id="w">Yesterday</a>&#39; by <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" id="w">the Beatles</a>, and that&#39;s all I wrote, that would be good enough to be part of that history.&#34;  Stefani resumed work with Linda Perry, who invited <a href="/wiki/Dallas_Austin" id="w">Dallas Austin</a>, and many other artists, including <a href="/wiki/OutKast" id="w">OutKast</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_3000" id="w">André 3000</a>, The Neptunes, and <a href="/wiki/Dr._Dre" id="w">Dr. Dre</a>.<sup id="_ref-scared_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scared" title="">[1]</a></sup> Stefani announced the album&#39;s release in early 2004,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> marketing it as a &#34;dance record&#34; and a &#34;guilty pleasure&#34;.<sup id="_ref-scared_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scared" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
