<a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h2>Etymology</h2>

<p>{{Main}}
The term &#39;Assassin&#39; derives from <a href="/wiki/Hashshashin" id="w">Hashshashin</a>, a militant <a href="/wiki/Ismaili" id="w">Ismaili</a> Muslim sect, active in the Middle East from the eighth to the fourteenth centuries. This mystic <a href="/wiki/Secret_society" id="w">secret society</a> killed members of the <a href="/wiki/Abbasid" id="w">Abbasid</a> and <a href="/wiki/Seljuq_dynasty" id="w">Seljuq</a> Ã©lite for political and religious reasons.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is speculated that the assassins were drugged for their murders with <a href="/wiki/Hashish" id="w">hashish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Opium" id="w">opium</a>; <i>assassin</i> derives either from <i>hasishin</i>, the influence of the drugs, or <i>hassansin</i>, after their leader, <a href="/wiki/Hassan-i-Sabah" id="w">Hassan-i-Sabah</a>. <i>Hashishinnya</i> was an offensive term depicting this cult by its Muslim and Mongolian detractors.</p>
<p>The earliest literary use of the &#34;assassination&#34; is in <i>The Tragedy of Macbeth</i> (1605).<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Definition_problem" name="Definition_problem"></a><h2>Definition problem</h2>

<p>The definition of &#34;assassination&#34; varies among sources, the <i>The <a href="/wiki/American_Heritage_Dictionary" id="w">American Heritage Dictionary</a></i> defines &#34;to assassinate&#34;:</p>
<dl><dd><i>. . . to <a href="/wiki/Murder" id="w">murder</a> [a prominent person] by surprise attack, as for political reasons</i>;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>however, the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary" id="w">Oxford English Dictionary</a>&#39;s definition is:</p>
<dl><dd><i>The action of assassinating; the taking the life of any one by treacherous violence, esp. by a hired emissary, or one who has taken upon him to execute the deed.</i><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Should it include killings wherein the primary motivation is attracting attention to a political cause, wherein the victim is of secondary importance? Should it be limited to the murders of political leaders and figures hostile to the assassin&#39;s political agenda? Given that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the killing of someone <i>by treacherous violence</i></li>
<li>the killing of someone <i>in the public view</i></li>
<li>the killing of someone <i>for political, moral, or ideological reasons</i></li></ul>

Most of these assassinations however turned out to have no more than nebulous political backgrounds, adding a new threat - the mentally deranged assassin.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> the <a href="/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand" id="w">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> by Serb nationalist insurgents finally triggered <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> after a period of building conflicts, while <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> saw the first known use of specifically trained assassination operatives since the original <i>Assassins</i>{{Fact}}. <a href="/wiki/Reinhard_Heydrich" id="w">Reinhard Heydrich</a> was killed by Czech partisan killers, and knowledge from decoded transmissions allowed the US to carry out <a href="/wiki/Death_of_Isoroku_Yamamoto" id="w">a targeted attack</a>, killing Japanese Admiral <a href="/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto" id="w">Isoroku Yamamoto</a> while he was en-route in an airplane.

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a>, there was a dramatic new increase in the number of political assassinations, likely because of the <a href="/wiki/Ideology" id="w">ideological</a> polarization of most of the <a href="/wiki/First_world" id="w">First</a> and <a href="/wiki/Second_world" id="w">Second worlds</a>, whose adherents were often more than willing to both justify and finance such killings. </p>
<p>Nawabzadah Liaquat Ali Khan, the first Prime Minister of Pakistan was assassinated by Saad Akbar a lone assassin in 1951. Conspiracy theorists believe his conflict with certain members of the Pakistan military (Rawalpindi conspiracy) or suppression of Communists and antagonism towards the Soviet Union, were potential reasons for his assassination. </p>
<p>During the Kennedy era (which, as noted before, ended in <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination" id="w">an assassination</a> itself), Cuban President <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" id="w">Fidel Castro</a> narrowly escaped death on several occasions at the hands of the CIA. At the same time, the <a href="/wiki/KGB" id="w">KGB</a> made creative use of assassination to deal with high-profile defectors and <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Mossad" id="w">Mossad</a> used them to eliminate <a href="/wiki/Palestinian" id="w">Palestinian</a> <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare" id="w">guerrillas</a> and Palestinian political leaders.</p>
<p>Most major powers were not long in repudiating Cold War assassination tactics, though many allege that this was merely a smoke screen for political benefit and that covert and illegal training of assassins continues today, with Russia, Israel and other nations accused of still regularly engaging in such operations. In 1986, U.S. President <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" id="w">Ronald Reagan</a> ordered the <a href="/wiki/Operation_El_Dorado_Canyon" id="w">Operation El Dorado Canyon</a> air raid on Libya where one of the primary targets was the home residence of Libyan ruler <a href="/wiki/Muammar_al-Gaddafi" id="w">Muammar Gaddafi</a>.

<p>Various dictators around the world, such as <a href="/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" id="w">Saddam Hussein</a>, have also used assassination to remove individual opponents, or to terrorize troublesome population groups.{{Fact}} In return, in post-Saddam <a href="/wiki/Iraq" id="w">Iraq</a>, the Shiite-dominated government has used death squads to perform countless extrajudicial executions of <a href="/wiki/Sunni" id="w">Sunni</a> Iraqis, with some alleging that the death squads were trained by the U.S.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Since the rise of <a href="/wiki/Al-Qaeda" id="w">al-Qaeda</a> and similar organizations, who themselves often engage in assassination tactics, both the US administrations of <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" id="w">Clinton</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">Bush</a> have backed assassinations, mostly directed against terrorist leaders like <a href="/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden" id="w">Osama bin Laden</a>, but also against elected political leaders and opponents like <a href="/wiki/Mohammed_Omar" id="w">Mullah Omar</a>. Most of these attempts were undertaken with remote-controlled missiles and similar tactics, often using remote surveillance for the decision where and when to strike as well.

<a id="Further_reasons" name="Further_reasons"></a><h2>Further reasons</h2>
<a id="As_military_doctrine" name="As_military_doctrine"></a><h3>As military doctrine</h3>

<p>Assassination for military purposes has long been espoused - <a href="/wiki/Sun_Tzu" id="w">Sun Tzu</a>, writing around the time 500 B.C.E., argued in favor of using assassination in his book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Art_of_War" id="w">The Art of War</a></i>. Nearly 2000 years later <a href="/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli" id="w">Machiavelli</a> also argued assassination could be useful in his book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Prince" id="w">The Prince</a></i>. In medieval times, an army and even a nation might be based upon and around a particularly strong, canny or charismatic leader, whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war. However, in modern warfare a soldier&#39;s mindset is generally considered to surround ideals far more than specific leaders, while command structures are more flexible in replacing officer losses. While the death of a popular or successful leader often has a detrimental effect on morale, the organisational system and the belief in a specific cause is usually strong enough to enable continued warfare. </p>
<p>There is also the risk that the target could be replaced by an even more competent leader or that such a killing (or a failed attempt) will &#34;<a href="/wiki/Martyr" id="w">martyr</a>&#34; a leader and support his cause (by showing the moral ruthlessness of the assassins). Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian <a href="/wiki/Alcibiades" id="w">Alcibiades</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Peloponnesian_War" id="w">Peloponnesian War</a>. There are a number of additional examples from <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, the last major <a href="/wiki/Total_war" id="w">total war</a>, which show how assassination was used as a military tool at both tactical and strategic levels: </p>

<ul>
<li>The American interception of the <a href="/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto" id="w">Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto</a> airplane during World War II, after his travel route had been decrypted.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>The American perception that <a href="/wiki/Otto_Skorzeny" id="w">Skorzeny&#39;s</a> <a href="/wiki/Commando" id="w">commandos</a> were planning to assassinate <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" id="w">Eisenhower</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge" id="w">Battle of the Bulge</a> played havoc with Eisenhower&#39;s personal plans for some time, though it did not affect the battle itself. Skorzeny later denied in an interview with the <i>New York Times</i>{{Fact}} that he had ever intended to assassinate Eisenhower during <a href="/wiki/Operation_Greif" id="w">Operation Greif</a> and he said that he could prove it.<sup id="_ref-Skor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Skor" title="">[13]</a></sup> </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>There was a planned British commando raid to capture or kill the German General <a href="/wiki/Erwin_Rommel" id="w">Erwin Rommel</a> (also known as &#34;The Desert Fox&#34;).<sup id="_ref-Skor_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Skor" title="">[13]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>Use of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:</p>

<ul>
<li>During the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" id="w">Vietnam War</a>, partly in response to <a href="/wiki/Viet_Cong" id="w">Viet Cong</a> assassinations of government leaders, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" id="w">USA</a> engaged in the <a href="/wiki/Phoenix_Program" id="w">Phoenix Program</a> to assassinate Viet Cong leaders and sympathizers, and killed between 6,000 and 41,000 individuals, with official &#39;targets&#39; of 1,800 per month.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>From 1991 till 2006, Russia targeted the top commanders of the separatist groups they were fighting in <a href="/wiki/Chechenya" id="w">Chechenya</a>, killing several of them (including <a href="/wiki/Aslan_Maskhadov" id="w">Aslan Maskhadov</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shamil_Basayev" id="w">Shamil Basayev</a>)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>In the second world war underground factions have been known to assassinate rival underground leaders to ensure their chances on government (and not them) after the war would be over. Of course the reason given to the actual assassin would have been that he/she was a traitor and working for the Nazi&#39;s.</li></ul>
<a id="As_tool_of_insurgents" name="As_tool_of_insurgents"></a><h3>As tool of insurgents</h3>

<p>Insurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause. </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army" id="w">Irish Republican Army</a> guerrillas of 1919-1921 assassinated many <a href="/wiki/Royal_Irish_Constabulary" id="w">RIC</a> Police Intelligence officers during the <a href="/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence" id="w">Irish War of Independence</a>. <a href="/wiki/Michael_Collins_(Irish_leader)" id="w">Michael Collins</a> set up a special unit - <a href="/wiki/The_Squad_(IRA_unit)" id="w">the Squad</a> - for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad&#39;s activities peaked with the assassination of 14 British agents in <a href="/wiki/Dublin" id="w">Dublin</a> on <a href="/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1920)" id="w">Bloody Sunday</a> in 1920. </p>
<p>This tactic was used again by the <a href="/wiki/Provisional_IRA" id="w">Provisional IRA</a> during <a href="/wiki/The_Troubles" id="w">the Troubles</a> in <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" id="w">Northern Ireland</a> (1969-present). Assassination of <a href="/wiki/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary" id="w">RUC</a> officers and politicians was one of a number of methods used in the <a href="/wiki/Provisional_IRA_campaign_1969-1997" id="w">Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997</a>. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister" id="w">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" id="w">Margaret Thatcher</a> by bombing the Conservative Party Conference in a <a href="/wiki/Brighton" id="w">Brighton</a> hotel. <a href="/wiki/Ulster_loyalism" id="w">Loyalist paramilitaries</a> retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating <a href="/wiki/Irish_nationalist" id="w">Irish nationalist</a> politicians.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Basque_people" id="w">Basque</a> separatists <a href="/wiki/ETA" id="w">ETA</a> in <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a> have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably <a href="/wiki/Luis_Carrero_Blanco" id="w">Luis Carrero Blanco</a> in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them, meaning that many needed armed police bodyguards. </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Red_Brigades" id="w">Red Brigades</a> in <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a> carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army_Faction" id="w">Red Army Faction</a> in <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Middle_East" id="w">Middle Eastern</a> groups, such as the <a href="/wiki/PLO" id="w">PLO</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hezbollah" id="w">Hezbollah</a>, have all engaged in assassinations, though the higher intensity of armed conflict in the region compared to western Europe means that many of their actions are either better characterized as <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla" id="w">guerrilla</a> operations or as random attacks on civilians - especially the technique of <a href="/wiki/Suicide_bomb" id="w">suicide bombs</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" id="w">Vietnam War</a>, assassinations were routinely carried out by communist insurgents against government officials and private individuals deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the <a href="/wiki/Diem" id="w">Diem</a> regime to collapse, prior to the US intervention.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="For_money_or_gain" name="For_money_or_gain"></a><h3>For money or gain</h3>

<p>Individually, too, people have often found reasons to arrange the deaths of others through paid intermediaries. One who kills with no political motive or group loyalty who kills <i>only</i> for money is known as a <a href="/wiki/Contract_killing" id="w">Hitman</a> or <a href="/wiki/Contract_killing" id="w">Contract Killer</a>. Note that by the definition accepted above, while such a killer is not, strictly speaking, an assassin, if the killing is ordered and financed towards a political end, then that killing must rightly be termed an assassination, and the hitman an assassin by extension.</p>
<p>Entire organizations have sometimes specialized in assassination as one of their services, to be gained for the right price. Besides the original <a href="/wiki/Hashshashin" id="w">hashshashin</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Ninja" id="w">ninja</a> clans of <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> were rumored to perform assassinations - though it can be pointed out that most of what was ever known about the ninja was <a href="/wiki/Rumor" id="w">rumor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hearsay" id="w">hearsay</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/Murder%2C_Inc." id="w">Murder, Inc.</a>, an organization partnered to the <a href="/wiki/Mafia" id="w">Mafia</a>, was formed for the sole purpose of performing assassinations for organized crime. In <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a>, the <i>vory</i> (thieves), Russian organised crime syndicates, are often known to provide assassinations for the right price, as well as engaging in it themselves for their own purposes. A professional hitman is called &#34;cleaner&#34; in Russia; he is used to clean away the target. The Finnish as well as the Swedish underworld uses the word &#34;<a href="/wiki/Torpedo" id="w">torpedo</a>&#34; for a contract killer.</p>

<p>{{section-stub}}</p>
<p>A major study about assassination attempts in the US in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of &#39;impulsive&#39; action.<sup id="_ref-SS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SS" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be <a href="/wiki/Delusion" id="w">delusional</a>, a figure that rose to 60% with &#39;near-lethal approachers&#39; (people apprehended before reaching their target). This incidentally shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around 2/3rds of the attackers had previously been arrested for (not necessarily related) offenses, that around 44% had a history of serious <a href="/wiki/Depression_(mood)" id="w">depression</a>, and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.<sup id="_ref-SS_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SS" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Techniques" name="Techniques"></a><h2>Techniques</h2>
<a id="Ancient_methods" name="Ancient_methods"></a><h3>Ancient methods</h3>

<p>It seems likely that the first assassinations would have been direct and simple: <a href="/wiki/Stabbing" id="w">stabbing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Strangle" id="w">strangling</a> or <a href="/wiki/Bludgeon" id="w">bludgeoning</a>. Substantial planning or coordination would rarely have been involved, as tribal groups were too small, and the connection to the leaders too close. As <a href="/wiki/Civilization" id="w">civilization</a> took root, however, leaders began to have greater importance, and become more detached from the groups they ruled. This would have brought planning, <a href="/wiki/Subterfuge" id="w">subterfuge</a> and weapons into successful assassination plans.{{Fact}} </p>
<p>The key technique was likely <a href="/wiki/Infiltration" id="w">infiltration</a>, with the actual assassination via stabbing, smothering or strangulation. <a href="/wiki/Poison" id="w">Poisons</a> also started to be used in many forms. <a href="/wiki/Death_cap" id="w">Death cap</a> mushrooms and similar plants became a traditional choice of assassins especially if they could not be perceived as poisonous by taste, and the symptoms of the poisoning did not show until after some time.{{Fact}}</p>
<a id="Modern_methods" name="Modern_methods"></a><h3>Modern methods</h3>

<p>With the advent of effective <a href="/wiki/Ranged_weaponry" id="w">ranged weaponry</a>, and later <a href="/wiki/Firearm" id="w">firearms</a>, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. Bodyguards were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Additionally the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances for survival of an assassin. It is considered that <a href="/wiki/William_the_Silent" id="w">William the Silent</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a> was the first leader assassinated by firearms (July 10, 1584).</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" id="w">Gunpowder</a> and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch; for an example, the <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot" id="w">Gunpowder Plot</a> could have &#39;assassinated&#39; almost a thousand people.</p>
<p>Explosives, especially the <a href="/wiki/Car_bomb" id="w">car bomb</a>, become far more common in modern history, with <a href="/wiki/Grenade" id="w">grenades</a> and remote-triggered <a href="/wiki/Land_mine" id="w">landmines</a> also used, especially in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" id="w">Middle East</a> and Balkans (the initial attempt on <a href="/wiki/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria" id="w">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a>&#39;s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the <a href="/wiki/Rocket_propelled_grenade" id="w">rocket propelled grenade</a> (RPG) has became a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles for assassination,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Sniper" id="w">sniper</a> with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, there are certain difficulties associated with long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim&#39;s travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated <a href="/wiki/Sniper_rifle" id="w">sniper rifle</a> is also expensive and relatively rare, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and hand-finishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.<sup id="_ref-Austria_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Austria" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, many hunting rifles are accurate enough in the hands of an experienced marksman to fatally hit a target at up to 300 meters (330 yards) or more, such as the <a href="/wiki/Savage_Arms" id="w">Savage Arms</a> Model 111 rifle that was recently tested as having a calculated <a href="/wiki/Sniper_rifle#Capabilities" id="w">effective range on a human torso</a> of over 500 yards (450 m).<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Modern hunting cartridges also have a flat enough <a href="/wiki/Trajectory" id="w">trajectory</a> to not require the shooter to compensate for bullet drop for targets up to about 250 meters (275 yards) and are powerful enough to penetrate most types of <a href="/wiki/Body_armor#Performance standards" id="w">body armor</a> with relative ease. The difficulty for an assassin lies thus more in gaining the required marksman skills, than in procuring a suitable weapon.</p>
<p>Despite their comparative disadvantages, easy-to-acquire and hard-to-trace <a href="/wiki/Handgun" id="w">handguns</a> are much more commonly used. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the US in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, while 15% of the attempts used knives and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).<sup id="_ref-SS_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SS" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>A 2006 case in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a> concerned the <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko_poisoning" id="w">assassination of Alexander Litvinenko</a> who was given a lethal dose of radioactive <a href="/wiki/Polonium" id="w">polonium</a>-210, possibly passed to him in aerosol form sprayed directly onto his food. Litvinenko, a former <a href="/wiki/KGB" id="w">KGB</a> agent, had been granted asylum in the UK in 2000 after citing persecution in <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a>. Shortly before his death he issued a statement accusing <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" id="w">Vladimir Putin</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Russian_president" id="w">Russian president</a>, of involvement in his assassination. President Putin denies he had any part in Litvinenko&#39;s death.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Counter-measures" name="Counter-measures"></a><h2>Counter-measures</h2>
<a id="Early_forms" name="Early_forms"></a><h3>Early forms</h3>

<p>One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins is without doubt the <a href="/wiki/Bodyguard" id="w">bodyguard</a>. He acts as a shield for the potential target, keeps lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a planned tour), and is literally supposed to put himself &#39;in harm&#39;s way&#39; - both by his simple presence, forming a barrier in front of the target<sup id="_ref-SS_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SS" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> and by shielding the target during any attack. He is also, if possible, to neutralize an attacker as fast as possible, and thus often carries weapons (where legal or possible). </p>
<p>This bodyguard function was often executed by the leader&#39;s most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading to attempts via <a href="/wiki/Subterfuge" id="w">subterfuge</a>, such as poison (which was answered by the <a href="/wiki/Food_taster" id="w">food taster</a>).</p>
<p>Notable examples of bodyguards would include the Roman <a href="/wiki/Praetorian_Guard" id="w">Praetorian Guard</a> or the Ottoman <a href="/wiki/Janissary" id="w">janissaries</a> - although, in both cases, it should be noted that the protectors often became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the <a href="/wiki/Head_of_state" id="w">head of state</a> a virtual hostage at their whim or eliminating threatening leaders altogether. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties leads to assassinations such as that of <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India" id="w">Indian Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Indira_Gandhi" id="w">Indira Gandhi</a>, assassinated by two <a href="/wiki/Sikh" id="w">Sikh</a> bodyguards in 1984.</p>
<a id="Modern_strategies" name="Modern_strategies"></a><h3>Modern strategies</h3>

<p>With the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a <a href="/wiki/Brigade" id="w">small army</a> trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.</p>
<p>As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence of assassins and their capabilities skyrocketed, and so did measures to protect against them. For the first time, <a href="/wiki/Armored_car" id="w">armored cars</a> or <a href="/wiki/Armored_limousine" id="w">armored limousines</a> were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions rendering them virtually invulnerable to <a href="/wiki/Small_arms" id="w">small arms</a> fire and smaller bombs and <a href="/wiki/Land_mine" id="w">mines</a>.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Bulletproof_vest" id="w">Bulletproof vests</a> also began to be used, though they were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected - as such they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events if at all.</p>
<p>Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restrictive;<sup id="_ref-Report_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Report" title="">[23]</a></sup> potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as <a href="/wiki/Communication" id="w">communication</a> became better and <a href="/wiki/Information_technology" id="w">information technology</a> more prevalent, it has become next-to-impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of <a href="/wiki/Metal_detector" id="w">metal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bomb_disposal" id="w">bomb detectors</a>. </p>
<p>Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during <a href="/wiki/Transport" id="w">transport</a>, both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with US <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President</a> <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" id="w">John F. Kennedy</a> and former <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistani</a> Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto" id="w">Benazir Bhutto</a>, or as part of <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%26%2339%3B%C3%A9tat" id="w">coups d&#39;Ã©tat</a> where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with <a href="/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba" id="w">Patrice Lumumba</a> and likely <a href="/wiki/Salvador_Allende" id="w">Salvador Allende</a>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>The methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear <a href="/wiki/Bulletproof_glass" id="w">bulletproof glass</a>, such as the <a href="/wiki/Popemobile" id="w">Popemobile</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pope" id="w">Pope</a> <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II" id="w">John Paul II</a> (built following an extremist&#39;s attempt at his life). Politicians themselves often resent this need for separation - which has at times caused tragedy when they sent their bodyguards from their side for personal or publicity reasons, as U.S. President <a href="/wiki/William_McKinley" id="w">William McKinley</a> did during the public reception at which he was assassinated.<sup id="_ref-Report_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Report" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as <a href="/wiki/Writer" id="w">writer</a> <a href="/wiki/Salman_Rushdie" id="w">Salman Rushdie</a>. A related form of protection is the use of <a href="/wiki/Political_decoy" id="w">body doubles</a>, a person built similar to the person he is expected to impersonate. These persons are then <a href="/wiki/Makeup" id="w">made up</a>, as well as in some cases <a href="/wiki/Surgery" id="w">altered</a> to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations. Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein are known to have used body doubles.<sup id="_ref-FOX_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FOX" title="">[25]</a></sup> According to Joe R. Reeder, a former under secretary for the U.S. Army from 1993-1997 writing in <a href="/wiki/Fox_News" id="w">Fox News</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" id="w">Fidel Castro</a> had also used body doubles, though no details were specified.<sup id="_ref-FOX_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FOX" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the final analysis, counter-measures can never be fully effective. If the assassin is committed beyond reason (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Insanity" id="w">insane</a>) or without concern for his own for self-preservation (<a href="/wiki/Suicide_attack" id="w">suicide attacker</a>), then the task of protecting a person will be made much more difficult.</p>
