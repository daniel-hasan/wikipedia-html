<p><b>MINI</b> is the name of a <a href="/wiki/Cowley%2C_Oxford" id="w">Cowley</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>-based <a href="/wiki/Subsidiary" id="w">subsidiary</a> of <a href="/wiki/BMW" id="w">BMW</a> as well as that of a car produced by that subsidiary since April 2001.</p>
<p>The car, designed by <a href="/wiki/Frank_Stephenson" id="w">Frank Stephenson</a>,<sup id="_ref-paternie_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paternie" title="">[1]</a></sup> is marketed as a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Retro" id="w">retro</a>&#34; redesign of the original <a href="/wiki/Mini" id="w">Mini</a>, which was manufactured by the <a href="/wiki/British_Motor_Corporation" id="w">British Motor Corporation</a> and its successors from 1959 to 2000.  The name is written in capital letters to distinguish it from its predecessor.<sup id="_ref-MiniBrand_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MiniBrand" title="">[2]</a></sup> Upon general release the car was marketed as &#34;NEW MINI&#34; although it is commonly less officially referred to as &#34;BMW Mini&#34;. Originally developed by <a href="/wiki/Rover_Group" id="w">Rover Group</a> and to be sold under the <a href="/wiki/Rover_(car)" id="w">Rover</a> brand and made at the <a href="/wiki/Longbridge_plant" id="w">Longbridge plant</a>, the MINI project was retained by BMW when the latter divested itself of Rover in 2000<sup id="_ref-UARWR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UARWR" title="">[3]</a></sup>. The MINI is assembled in <a href="/wiki/Cowley%2C_Oxford" id="w">Cowley, Oxford</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>, in what was historically the <a href="/wiki/Pressed_Steel_Company" id="w">Pressed Steel Company</a> body plant,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> now known as Plant Oxford.</p>
<p>The 2001 to 2006 <a href="/wiki/Model_year" id="w">model years</a> included four <a href="/wiki/Hatchback" id="w">hatchback</a> models: the basic &#34;MINI One&#34;, the <a href="/wiki/Diesel" id="w">diesel</a>-engined &#34;MINI One/D&#34;, the sportier &#34;MINI Cooper&#34; and the supercharged &#34;MINI Cooper S&#34;.  In 2005 a <a href="/wiki/Convertible" id="w">convertible</a> roof option was added.  In November 2006 a greatly re-engineered version of the MINI was released which is unofficially known as the &#34;Mk II MINI&#34;.<sup id="_ref-MC2_Nov06_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MC2_Nov06" title="">[5]</a></sup>. The Mk II is only available as a hard-top in the 2007 model year.</p>
<p>The MINI was designed and engineered to replace the long running <a href="/wiki/Rover_Metro" id="w">Rover 100</a> and the larger <a href="/wiki/Rover_200" id="w">Rover 200</a>, both deemed unsuitable for the modern world automobile market. The MINI was supposed to replace low-end models of the 200 and high-end models of the 100 with a Rover 35 replacing high end 200s and low end 400s. After the divestment of MG Rover, the MINI was instead marketed as a small yet desirable city car rather than a mainstream replacement of the 100 and 200.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Mk I MINI Cooper convertible</div></div>

In <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portugal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a>, the MINI One is powered by a 1.4 litre version of the <a href="/wiki/Tritec_engine" id="w">Tritec engine</a> but all other <a href="/wiki/Petrol" id="w">petrol</a> powered MINIs use the 1.6 litre version.<sup id="_ref-haynes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-haynes" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-bentley_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bentley" title="">[7]</a></sup> Since 2004, a soft-top <a href="/wiki/Convertible" id="w">convertible</a> option has been available across the entire range.<sup id="_ref-miniwebsite_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-miniwebsite" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are numerous styling and badging differences between the models, perhaps the most obvious being that the Cooper S has a distinctive <a href="/wiki/Hood_scoop" id="w">scoop</a> cut into the <a href="/wiki/Hood_(vehicle)" id="w">bonnet</a>. The Cooper S also has twin exhausts which exit under the center of the rear valance. The (non-S) Cooper has more <a href="/wiki/Chrome_plating" id="w">chrome</a> parts than the MINI One and has a single exhaust. The MINI One D has no visible exhaust pipes at all.<sup id="_ref-miniwebsite_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-miniwebsite" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In some markets, such as <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">US</a>, only the MINI Cooper and Cooper S are sold because the MINI One&#39;s engine was considered to deliver insufficient power to run an <a href="/wiki/Air_conditioner" id="w">air conditioner</a> — a necessary feature in those climates. However, the only difference between the engines in the &#39;One&#39; and the &#39;Cooper&#39; models is a <a href="/wiki/Computer_software" id="w">software</a> change within the <a href="/wiki/Engine_control_unit" id="w">engine control unit</a> which is tuned for optimum fuel economy on the MINI One and for a compromise between power and economy on the Cooper. Almost fifty percent of all MINIs sold in Australia and about seventy percent of those sold in the US are the top-of-the-range Cooper S model.</p>
<p>The names <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Cooper S</i> echo the names used for the sportier version of the classic Mini which in turn come from the involvement of <a href="/wiki/John_Cooper_(car_maker)" id="w">John Cooper</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Cooper_Car_Company" id="w">Cooper Car Company</a>. The Cooper heritage is further emphasised with the <i>John Cooper Works</i> (JCW) range of tuning options that are available with the MINI. John Cooper also created a one-off racing model of the MINI One named the MINI One S Works. This car features many extras which help to improve performance, such as a racing exhaust and air filter as well as uprated suspension. The car also has one-of-a-kind 17-inch racing wheels.<sup id="_ref-anderson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-anderson" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

The &#34;Mk I&#34; MINI One, Cooper and Cooper S used a <a href="/wiki/Brazil" id="w">Brazilian</a>-built <a href="/wiki/Chrysler" id="w">Chrysler</a> joint-venture engine, <a href="/wiki/Tritec_engine" id="w">Tritec engine</a>, while the MINI One D used a <a href="/wiki/Toyota" id="w">Toyota</a>-built diesel engine. In August 2006, BMW announced that engines would in future be built in the UK, making the car essentially British-built again, with final assembly at Cowley and the body pressings being made in nearby <a href="/wiki/Swindon" id="w">Swindon</a> at BMW&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Swindon_Pressings_Ltd" id="w">Swindon Pressings Ltd</a> subsidiary.</p>
<p>While the modern MINI uses none of the engineering of the original <a href="/wiki/Mini" id="w">Mini</a>, it does capture much of the spirit of the classic car. Like the original, it uses a <a href="/wiki/Transverse_engine" id="w">transversely-mounted</a> four-cylinder engine <a href="/wiki/Front_wheel_drive" id="w">driving the front wheels</a>. All four wheels are pushed to the corners of the body which is a &#39;two-box&#39; or &#39;<a href="/wiki/Hot_hatch" id="w">hot hatch</a>&#39; design. The styling of the car, like that of the <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_New_Beetle" id="w">Volkswagen New Beetle</a>, is a <a href="/wiki/Retro" id="w">retro</a> design that is deliberately reminiscent of the original <a href="/wiki/Mini" id="w">Mini</a> with contrasting roof colours, optional <a href="/wiki/Go-faster_stripes" id="w">bonnet stripes</a>, optional rally lights and with black trim around the wheel arches and rocker panels that mimic the wide wheel flares found on many classic Minis.<sup id="_ref-paternie_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paternie" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The MINI One and MINI Cooper were available with a <a href="/wiki/Continuously_variable_transmission" id="w">continuously variable transmission</a> or with a conventional <a href="/wiki/GETRAG" id="w">GETRAG</a> five-speed <a href="/wiki/Manual_transmission" id="w">manual transmission</a>. The Cooper S comes with a six-speed <a href="/wiki/GETRAG" id="w">GETRAG</a> manual or (from the 2005 model year onwards) a fully <a href="/wiki/Automatic_transmission" id="w">automatic transmission</a> with paddle shifters.</p>
<p>As standard, the MINI had a &#39;<a href="/wiki/Drive_by_wire" id="w">drive by wire</a>&#39; electronic throttle, <a href="/wiki/Electronic_brakeforce_distribution" id="w">electronic brakeforce distribution</a>, cornering brake control and <a href="/wiki/Electronic_stability_control" id="w">electronic stability control</a> (standard or optional, depending on model and region) to improve control and handling in adverse conditions.<sup id="_ref-mundy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mundy" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Adding a <a href="/wiki/Supercharger" id="w">supercharger</a> to the 1st generation Cooper S model required that the battery be relocated into the rear of the car - leaving no room for a spare tyre.  Hence this model comes with <a href="/wiki/Run_flat_tire" id="w">run flat tyres</a> as standard.</p>

From November 2006, the hatchback MINI range has been replaced by an all-new MINI, consisting of MINI Cooper and MINI Cooper S models, powered by a new 1.6 litre engine co-developed by BMW and PSA Peugeot-Citroën. The &#34;old&#34; MINI Convertible continues to be sold alongside the new hatchback range. The Mk II MINI One will be on sale in April 2007 with Mk II Convertibles in the 2009 model year. The MINI One has a 1.4 litre engine derived from the same engine in the MINI Cooper and Peugeot 207.</p>
<p>The later &#34;Mk II&#34; MINI (or R56) uses the BMW-PSA 1.4/1.6 <a href="/wiki/Prince_engine" id="w">Prince</a> 4 cylinder engine. The naturally-aspirated (non-turbo) versions of this engine use a system known as VALVETRONIC to control valves for optimum performance and/or efficiency. This MINI uses a drivetrain architecture based on that of the <a href="/wiki/Peugeot_207" id="w">Peugeot 207</a> and the second generation <a href="/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn_C3" id="w">Citroën C3</a>. </p>
<p>The R56 Cooper S boasts <a href="/wiki/Gasoline_Direct_Injection" id="w">direct injection</a> and a Twin Scroll <a href="/wiki/Turbocharger" id="w">Turbocharger</a> featuring an <a href="/wiki/Overboost" id="w">Overboost</a> function for added torque. This engine produces 128kW (175 HP) and 240 N·m (177 ft·lbf) of torque. The Overboost function momentarily increases torque to 260 Nm (192 ft·lbf)</p>
<p>The new Cooper D model is available from April 2007, featuring a 1.6 litre, 16-valve turbodiesel engine producing 80kW (110 <a href="/wiki/HP" id="w">HP</a>) and 240 N·m (177 ft·lbf) of torque. This unit also features the <a href="/wiki/Overboost" id="w">Overboost</a> function momentarily increases torque to 260 N·m (192 ft·lbf) </p>
<p>Technical innovations include an electrically driven power steering system that avoids taking power directly from the engine, equal length driveshafts to eliminate <a href="/wiki/Torque_steer" id="w">torque steer</a>, and a sophisticated <a href="/wiki/Multi-link_suspension" id="w">multi-link rear suspension</a> usually found only on rear wheel drive cars. The MINI has a &#39;<a href="/wiki/Drive_by_wire" id="w">drive by wire</a>&#39; electronic throttle, <a href="/wiki/Electronic_brakeforce_distribution" id="w">electronic brakeforce distribution</a>, cornering brake control, and <a href="/wiki/Electronic_stability_control" id="w">electronic stability control</a> to improve control and handling in adverse conditions.<sup id="_ref-mundy_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mundy" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the introduction of the R56 MINI, the CVT transmission has been dispensed with altogether, and replaced by an hydraulic automatic transmission unit, similar to that of the previous Cooper S. This gearbox is available throughout the whole range of R56 MINIs, appearing lastly on the Cooper D from 2008. Additionally, steering-wheel mounted paddle-shift is also available.</p>

At the &#39;<a href="/wiki/Salon_International_de_l%26%2339%3BAuto" id="w">Salon International de l&#39;Auto</a>&#39; (<a href="/wiki/Geneva_Motor_Show" id="w">Geneva Motor Show</a>) in 2004, MINI introduced a <a href="/wiki/Cabriolet" id="w">cabriolet</a> (<a href="/wiki/Convertible" id="w">convertible</a>) model which was released in the 2005 model year and available in One, Cooper and Cooper S versions.
The convertible roof is fully automatic - an unusual feature in such a small car - and can be opened partially to act as a <a href="/wiki/Sunroof" id="w">sunroof</a> whilst the car is driving at speed. The convertible model forsakes the rear hatch of the hardtop MINI - replacing it with a drop down &#39;tailgate&#39; design reminiscent of the classic <a href="/wiki/Mini" id="w">Mini</a> and incorporating similarly prominent external hinges. The convertible also adds two small power windows for the rear seat passengers which are retracted automatically as the roof opens. The roof is made from a heavy cloth with many layers of insulation; the rear window is of glass and has a heater/defroster but no washer or wiper.</p>
<p>As a joke and undoubtedly as a part of MINI&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Viral_marketing" id="w">viral marketing</a> approach, purchasers of the MINI convertible were asked to sign a &#39;contract&#39; promising that they would drive the car with the roof open at least 90% of the time. MINI also set up a telephone hotline (in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">USA</a>: 1-888-DO NOT CLOSE) which one may call to report convertible owners who are driving with the roof up inappropriately. The automated system offers such helpful advice as how to administer a <a href="/wiki/Wedgie" id="w">wedgie</a> to the offender.</p>
<p>At the 2007 North American International Auto Show, Mini introduced the limited edition of Mini Cooper S Sidewalk Convertible. It has a top speed of 215km/h. 0-100 km/h only takes 7.9 seconds. It has 168 hp and 220 N·m of torque.</p>
<a id="The_Works_GP_MINI" name="The_Works_GP_MINI"></a><h2> The Works GP MINI </h2>
<p>The last version to be made with the Tritec engine is the MINI Cooper S with John Cooper Works GP Kit, a lightweight, race-prepped <a href="/wiki/John_Cooper_(car_maker)" id="w">John Cooper Works</a> model. Hand-finished by Bertone in Italy, it was produced as a limited-production run of 2000 cars in 2006, originally with 444 of those ear-marked for the UK market (although ultimately 459 were sold). The GP features more bolstered front seats but has no rear seats, which along with reduced sound-deadening, deleting the rear wash-wipe, offering optional air-conditioning and making other steps to reduce the overall weight, resulted in a weight saving of around 40 kg over a Cooper S. Additionally, the car has enhanced braking and suspension, as well as 218 horsepower from the John Cooper Works engine modification package. In place of the rear seats there is additional body stiffening and below-floor storage areas. There are many unique styling points such as the red door mirrors, a carbon fibre rear spoiler, unique body kit, bespoke (2 kg lighter) 4-spoke alloy wheels and specialised badging. Available in just one colour scheme, Thunder Blue with a Pure Silver roof, each car is individually numbered and features a decal on the roof along with a plaque on the dashboard. The last of the supercharged MINIs and a genuine Limited Edition model, it is expected that the MINI Cooper S with John Cooper Works GP Kit will become a collectors&#39; item.</p>

<p>As with the classic Mini, the new MINI has a widespread club and enthusiast following and strong after-market support for performance upgrades and styling enhancements. Such community support keeps the brand highly valued and shows BMW&#39;s decision to relaunch the MINI as a successful business strategy.

<a href="/wiki/Alex_Moulton" id="w">Dr. Alex Moulton</a>, designer of the suspension system for the original classic Mini, is reported to have said of the new MINI, in an interview with <i>MiniWorld</i> magazine, &#34;It&#39;s enormous - the original Mini was the best packaged car of all time - this is an example of how not to do it. it&#39;s huge on the outside and weighs the same as an <a href="/wiki/Austin_Maxi" id="w">Austin Maxi</a>. The crash protection has been taken too far. I mean, what do you want, an armoured car? It is an irrelevance insofar as it has no part in the Mini story.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Moulton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Moulton" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many classic Mini enthusiasts are sharply critical of the new MINI (some call it <i>the BINI</i> as a contraction of <i>BMW MINI</i>), citing the fact that it is two feet longer, a foot wider and almost twice the weight of the classic car - yet it has less rear leg room and less luggage space. Undoubtedly much of this is to do with modern crash protection requirements and the desire to incorporate features such as air conditioning, a supercharged engine with modern emissions controls and a higher level of front-seat comfort than the classic Mini was capable of. This opinion is far from universal and other classic Mini enthusiasts have embraced the modern MINI as a natural evolution of the original concept with many of them owning both kinds of car. {{Fact}}</p>
<p>Some MINI convertible owners criticise the poor rear visibility in the convertible. With the roof up the wide areas of cloth down the sides of the car block visibility to the rear quarters and the lack of washer/wiper on the small rear window - combined with the tendency of all flat-backed cars to accumulate dirt on the rear - effectively eliminates all rear visibility. Even with the roof down, the large roll-protection bars above the back seats and the bunched up cloth of the folded roof tends to block a significant fraction of rearward visibility. In an attempt to counter this problem when reversing the car, the MINI <a href="/wiki/Convertible" id="w">convertible</a> comes with rear-mounted proximity sensors as standard equipment (these are available as an option on the hardtop MINI).</p>
<a id="The_MkII_MINI" name="The_MkII_MINI"></a><h2> The MkII MINI </h2>
<p>{{Infobox Automobile generation}}
MINI has introduced a new version of the car for the 2007 model year, on a re-engineered <a href="/wiki/Automobile_platform" id="w">platform</a> with many stylistic and engineering changes. The engine architecture is shared with <a href="/wiki/PSA_Peugeot_Citro%C3%ABn" id="w">PSA Peugeot Citroën</a> and is intended to be more cost effective. The engineering was done in the United Kingdom by MINI/BMW Group UK Engineering, in Munich at BMW Group HQ and with external third parties including IDG in Italy.</p>
<p>The so-called &#39;Mk II MINI&#39; (echoing the &#39;mark number&#39; naming of the classic <a href="/wiki/Mini" id="w">Mini</a>) was introduced in November 2006 in the Cooper and Cooper S trim and the range will be completed later in 2007 with the arrival of the Mk II MINI One.  For the first time, there will be a diesel-powered Cooper available from April 2007, badged as the Cooper D.  The MINI convertible will continue to use the Mk I platform for at least a year. </p>
<p>Though the Mk II has a familiar look, every panel on the new car has been changed from the old model. New safety requirements mean that the overall length has increased by 60 mm, the front end raised and the <a href="/wiki/Turn_signal" id="w">indicators</a> have been repositioned inside the headlights. The headlights themselves are now fixed to the front quarter panels rather than being housed within the bonnet so that they are not raised up with it when the bonnet opens. The car features a restyled <a href="/wiki/Grille" id="w">grille</a> and larger rear light clusters. The Cooper S retains the <a href="/wiki/Hood_scoop" id="w">bonnet scoop</a> in order to keep an association with the outgoing model — although the relocation of the <a href="/wiki/Intercooler" id="w">intercooler</a> to the front of the engine means that the scoop is now purely decorative. In addition, the Cooper S no longer has the battery located under the boot floor, instead being found in the more conventional place. The <a href="/wiki/Pillar_(car)" id="w">C pillars</a> are no longer encased in glass and have been shaped to improve <a href="/wiki/Aerodynamics" id="w">aerodynamics</a> and to reduce the tendency for dirt to accumulate on the back of the car. Much criticised for the lack of rear legroom, MINI has added more space for rear passengers by creating sculpted cut-outs in the rear of the front seats. An engine starter button replaces the conventional ignition key and, with the optional &#39;convenience package&#39;, the car unlocks itself automatically when the key is brought close to the car.</p>
<p>The Cooper and Cooper S models offer a new rear axle and <a href="/wiki/Aluminium" id="w">aluminium</a> components to reduce the car&#39;s weight and a Sports kit option comprising harder springs, <a href="/wiki/Shock_absorber" id="w">damper</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anti-roll_bar" id="w">anti-roll bars</a> is offered with both variants. Another key difference is the introduction of an upgraded electric <a href="/wiki/Power_steering" id="w">power steering</a> system, the sharpness of which can be increased by pressing a Sport button in front of the shifter (both auto and manual) - which also adjusts the response of the <a href="/wiki/Accelerator_(car)" id="w">accelerator</a>. In conjunction with automatic transmission, the Sport Button also allows the engine to rev almost to the red line before changing gear.</p>
<p>As for engines, the <a href="/wiki/Tritec_engine" id="w">Tritec engine</a> has been replaced in the Cooper model with a 120 bhp 1.6-litre <a href="/wiki/BMW/PSA_Prince_engine" id="w">Prince</a> engine with BMW&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Valvetronic" id="w">Valvetronic</a> infinitely variable valve timing, developed on and with <a href="/wiki/Peugeot" id="w">Peugeot</a>&#39;s core engine. It is reported in early road tests that this takes the car from 0-62 mph in a claimed 9.1 seconds and has top speed of 125 mph. Fuel economy of {{mpg (Imperial)}} on the combined cycle is nearly 8 mpg better. The more powerful 175 bhp Cooper S replaces the <a href="/wiki/Supercharger" id="w">supercharger</a> with a new twin scroll <a href="/wiki/Turbocharger" id="w">turbocharger</a> in the interests of efficiency, and will feature <a href="/wiki/Gasoline_direct_injection" id="w">gasoline direct injection</a>. Subsequently, this engine does not feature Valvetronic. This engine also has an &#34;overboost&#34; function which temporarily raises the torque by 15 ft·lbf (20 N·m) under hard acceleration. As a result, 0-62 mph is covered in a claimed 7.1 seconds, and top speed is 140 mph. It achieves similar improvements in fuel economy to the Cooper, returning {{mpg (Imperial)}} combined. Both cars come with six-speed manual or automatic gearboxes. The turbocharged engine is the same (although with some French engineering modifications) as the one in the <a href="/wiki/Peugeot_207" id="w">Peugeot 207</a> GTi/RC.</p>
<p>From 2008, all MINI models will be equipped with BMW Efficient Dynamics technology. This includes a start-stop feature shutting off the engine when the car is stationary.  When the gas pedal is depressed the engine is restarted with electricity generated from Brake Energy Regeneration. The Cooper D model attains {{mpg (Imperial)}} and emits 104 g of carbon dioxide per kilometre. A MINI One D is a possibility in the future, possible attaining even better fuel efficiency and lower emissions of greenhouse gases than the Cooper D, which is itself quite comparable to the <a href="/wiki/Toyota_Prius" id="w">Toyota Prius</a> for fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions (potentially better than the Prius at higher rpm). Efficient Dynamics is standard in all MINI models, making MINI the first British car manufacturer to build a hybrid vehicle (although Efficient Dynamics is a <a href="/wiki/Mild_hybrid" id="w">Mild hybrid</a> technology system) and also making it the first mainstream car manufacturer to have all models in its range as mild hybrids as standard (MINI&#39;s parent, BMW, is still in the process of implementing Efficient Dynamics across its older models).</p>
<p>All models of the Mk II with optional DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) also include &#34;Hill Assist&#34;, a feature which prevents the car from rolling backwards on an incline by holding the brakes on for 2 seconds after the driver lifts their foot from the brake pedal, allowing them time to engage the accelerator. </p>
<p>The interior of the Mk II echoes the style of the earlier model but is in fact a complete redesign. The <a href="/wiki/Car_boot" id="w">boot</a> of the new car has an additional 10 litres of load space. Other changes in design - both visible and otherwise - have contributed to the MINI&#39;s recently awarded 5 stars in the <a href="/wiki/EURONCAP" id="w">EURONCAP</a> tests. One example is the higher front <a href="/wiki/Bonnet" id="w">bonnet</a>, which now complies with the European pedestrian collision regulations.</p>
<p>The Mk II MINI is built by MINI&#39;s Production Triangle - Plant <a href="/wiki/Swindon" id="w">Swindon</a> (body panels), Plant <a href="/wiki/Hams_Hall" id="w">Hams Hall</a> (engine) and finally Plant <a href="/wiki/Oxford" id="w">Oxford</a>, where final assembly work is completed.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

The MINI Clubman is a separate model now available to order in Cooper, Cooper D, and Cooper S variations. It is several inches longer to accommodate more leg room and a larger boot. It has double doors as a boot instead of a pull-up hatch. It also features a Club Door on the right side for passengers in the back.</p>
<p>The name &#39;Clubman&#39; is a break with classic Mini tradition.  The classic Mini Clubman was a saloon car with a squarer front end but a standard Mini rear end.  The estate van versions of the classic Mini were called &#39;Mini Traveller&#39; and &#39;Mini Countryman&#39;. However, these names are not fully understood in world markets &#38; BMW did not purchase the rights to use those names when they bought the rights to the other Mini names.</p>
<p>The Clubman recently received heavy criticism on motoring show <a href="/wiki/Top_Gear" id="w">Top Gear</a> where it was dubbed as the ugliest car for the Top Gear awards of 2007, as well as nominated for worst overall car, only for the <a href="/wiki/G-Wiz" id="w">G-Wiz</a> to subsequently receive this award.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Rover_(car)" id="w">Rover</a> first showed the MINI as the ACV30 concept car in 1997<sup id="_ref-UARWR_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UARWR" title="">[3]</a></sup>. This looked very different from the production MINI. It had circular headlamps, huge wheel flares and a much more rounded appearance overall compared to the production design.</p>
<p>Before the first sales of the MINI, prototype versions were shown at the 2000 <a href="/wiki/Paris_Auto_Show" id="w">Paris Auto Show</a>. These were essentially identical to the version that was finally sold except that the colours used (&#39;Candy Blue&#39; and &#39;Flamenco Orange&#39;) have never been used in production cars.</p>
<p>BMW demonstrated a hydrogen-powered internal combustion technology in some of their concept cars in 2000 and 2001, and MINI showcased a hydrogen powered concept car in 2001 at the Frankfurt Auto Show. The car differs from <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle" id="w">electric</a>-motor hydrogen concepts, such as the <a href="/wiki/Honda_FCX" id="w">Honda FCX</a> in that it uses a cylinder-based <a href="/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" id="w">internal combustion engine</a>.</p>
<p>An all-electric MINI is in use at the <a href="/wiki/British_Embassy" id="w">British Embassy</a> in <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a> that uses around 200 kg of <a href="/wiki/Lithium_Ion" id="w">Lithium Ion</a> batteries. Three electric MINIs were also made for use in some subway scenes in the 2003 movie <i><a href="/wiki/The_Italian_Job_(2003_film)" id="w">The Italian Job</a></i> to satisfy the subway authorities concerns over possible <a href="/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning" id="w">carbon monoxide poisoning</a>. PML Flightlink developed a prototype series-hybrid conversion, called &#34;MINI QED&#34;, replacing the drivetrain with an 160bhp electric motor in each wheel and an efficient onboard gasoline generator.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>With higher powered engines, the standard front wheel drive MINI tends to produce a high level of wheel spin - a <a href="/wiki/Four_wheel_drive" id="w">four wheel drive</a> would be a natural solution to that problem. <a href="/wiki/GETRAG" id="w">GETRAG</a> demonstrated a four wheel drive version of the MINI in 2004.</p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt_Motor_Show" id="w">Frankfurt Motor Show</a> in 2005, MINI revealed a retro version of the classic &#39;<a href="/wiki/Mini" id="w">Mini</a> Traveller&#39; <a href="/wiki/Station_wagon" id="w">station wagon</a>. Based on a stretched wheelbase with two side-hinged rear doors and separate rear seats replacing the split bench seat of the standard MINI. At the <a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Auto_Show" id="w">Tokyo Auto Show</a>, the same basic concept reappeared with some fanciful additions - a circular roof section could be removed to form a picnic table with four folding chairs. The rear side windows were replaced with fold-down storage containers containing cutlery, cups and plates. In <a href="/wiki/North_American_International_Auto_Show" id="w">Detroit</a>, a further version was presented without the table and chairs - but with a radically restyled interior.</p>
<p>Additional MINI models, including a four-door version, a two-seat roadster and a dune buggy have been shown as computer-graphic mock-ups at various times.</p>
<a id="Beer_Can_Exhaust" name="Beer_Can_Exhaust"></a><h3>Beer Can Exhaust</h3>
<p>The team of designers working on the 2001 MINI had finished the full-sized clay mock-up of the MINI in plenty of time for a presentation for the board of directors. Chief designer <a href="/wiki/Frank_Stephenson" id="w">Frank Stephenson</a> realized that the model did not have an exhaust pipe.  His short-term solution was to pick up an empty beer can, punch a hole in it, strip off the paint and pushed it into the clay at the back of the car, which took just a few minutes.  The overall design for the mock-up was so good that the board members told him not to change a thing, resulting in the distinctive exhaust tip seen in production cars.<sup id="_ref-paternie_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paternie" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Internal_designations" name="Internal_designations"></a><h2>Internal designations</h2>
<p>All MINI models have R-series model numbers assigned to them. These are a legacy of the MINI&#39;s original development within <a href="/wiki/Rover_Group" id="w">Rover Group</a>.

<a id="Popularity" name="Popularity"></a><h2>Popularity</h2>
<p>The MINI was an instant hit with buyers in Britain and most other markets when it was launched over the summer of <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>. It has sold in far higher volumes than the old Mini did in its final few years of production from <a href="/wiki/Longbridge" id="w">Longbridge</a> , and with anticipated production of ca. 250,000 per annum from 2008 on in Cowley, Oxford Mini is now starting to rival the sales success that it enjoyed during the end of the <a href="/wiki/1960s" id="w">1960s</a> and early <a href="/wiki/1970s" id="w">1970s</a>. It has managed 40,000+ sales in the UK for most of the years that it has been on sale, and has never been far outside the Top 10.  The second largest market is now the USA.</p>
<p>The Mini One has found popularity among buyers who want a stylish and enjoyable but economical vehicle, while the Cooper and Cooper S versions make up the bulk of the sales, and are among the most popular hot hatchbacks on the British market, proving to be at least a match for the likes of the <a href="/wiki/Citroen_C2" id="w">Citroen C2 VTR</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ford_Fiesta" id="w">Ford Fiesta ST</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peugeot_206" id="w">Peugeot 206 GTI</a> and the sporty versions of the <a href="/wiki/Renault_Clio" id="w">Renault Clio</a>.</p>
