<p><b>Saint Maximus the Confessor</b> (also known as <b>Maximus the Theologian</b> and <b>Maximus de Constantinople</b>) (c. <a href="/wiki/580" id="w">580</a> – <a href="/wiki/13_August" id="w">13 August</a>, <a href="/wiki/662" id="w">662</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Christian" id="w">Christian</a> monk, theologian, and scholar. In his early life, he was a civil servant, and an aide to the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Emperor" id="w">Byzantine Emperor</a> <a href="/wiki/Heraclius" id="w">Heraclius</a>. However, he gave up this life in the political sphere to enter into the monastic life.</p>
<p>After moving to <a href="/wiki/Carthage" id="w">Carthage</a>, Maximus studied several <a href="/wiki/Neo-Platonism" id="w">Neo-Platonist</a> writers and became a prominent author. When one of his friends began espousing the <a href="/wiki/Christology" id="w">Christological</a> position known as <a href="/wiki/Monothelitism" id="w">Monothelitism</a>, Maximus was drawn into the controversy, in which he supported the <a href="/wiki/Chalcedonian" id="w">Chalcedonian</a> position that <a href="/wiki/Jesus" id="w">Jesus</a> had both a human and a divine <a href="/wiki/Will_(philosophy)" id="w">will</a>. Maximus is <a href="/wiki/Veneration" id="w">venerated</a> in both <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Christianity" id="w">Eastern Christianity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Western_Christianity" id="w">Western Christianity</a>. His positions eventually resulted in exile, soon after which he died. However, his theology was vindicated by the <a href="/wiki/Third_Council_of_Constantinople" id="w">Third Council of Constantinople</a> and he was venerated as a saint soon after his death. His feast day is <a href="/wiki/13_August" id="w">13 August</a> (or <a href="/wiki/21_January" id="w">21 January</a>).</p>

<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h3>Early life</h3>
<p>Very little is known about the details of Maximus&#39; life prior to his involvement in the theological and political conflicts of the Monothelite controversy. Maximus was most likely born in Constantinople even though a biography written by his <a href="/wiki/Maronite" id="w">Maronite</a> opponents has him born in Palestine.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Maximus was born into <a href="/wiki/Byzantine" id="w">Byzantine</a> <a href="/wiki/Nobility" id="w">nobility</a>, as indicated by his position as the personal secretary to <a href="/wiki/Heraclius" id="w">Heraclius</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> For reasons unknown, Maximus left public life in <a href="/wiki/630" id="w">630</a>, and took <a href="/wiki/Monastic_vows" id="w">monastic vows</a> at a monastery in Chrysopolis, a city across the <a href="/wiki/Bosporus" id="w">Bosporus</a> from Constantinople (also known as <a href="/wiki/Scutari" id="w">Scutari</a>, the modern Turkish city of <a href="/wiki/Üsk%C3%BCdar" id="w">Üsküdar</a>). In his years in Chrysopolis, Maximus was elevated to the position of <a href="/wiki/Abbot" id="w">Abbot</a> of the monastery.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>When the <a href="/wiki/Persian_Empire" id="w">Persian Empire</a> conquered <a href="/wiki/Anatolia" id="w">Anatolia</a>, Maximus was forced to flee to a monastery near <a href="/wiki/Carthage" id="w">Carthage</a>. It was there that he came under the tutelage of <a href="/wiki/Sophronius" id="w">Saint Sophronius</a>, and began studying the Christological writings of <a href="/wiki/Gregory_of_Nazianzus" id="w">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pseudo-Dionysius_the_Areopagite" id="w">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</a>. It was also during his stay in Carthage that Maximus began his career as a theological and spiritual writer.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Maximus was also held in very high esteem by the exarch and the population as a holy man, ostensibly becoming an influential un-official political advisor and spiritual head in North Africa.</p>
<a id="Involvement_in_Monothelite_controversy" name="Involvement_in_Monothelite_controversy"></a><h3>Involvement in Monothelite controversy</h3>
<p>While Maximus was in Carthage, a controversy broke out regarding how to understand the interaction between the human and divine natures within the <a href="/wiki/Incarnation_(Christianity)" id="w">person</a> of <a href="/wiki/Jesus" id="w">Jesus</a>. This Christological debate was the latest development in disagreements that began following the <a href="/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea" id="w">First Council of Nicaea</a> in <a href="/wiki/325" id="w">325</a>, and were intensified following the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Chalcedon" id="w">Council of Chalcedon</a> in <a href="/wiki/451" id="w">451</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Monothelite" id="w">Monothelite</a> position was developed as a compromise to appease those whose Christology was declared <a href="/wiki/Heresy" id="w">heresy</a> at Chalcedon. The Monothelites adhered to the <a href="/wiki/Chalcedonian" id="w">Chalcedonian</a> definition of the <a href="/wiki/Hypostatic_union" id="w">hypostatic union</a>: that two natures, one divine and one human, were united in the person of Christ. However, they went on to say that Christ had only a divine will and no human will (Monothelite is derived from the Greek for &#34;one will&#34;).</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">A coin showing Constans II with his son.<br/> Emperor Constans II supported <a href="/wiki/Monothelitism" id="w">Monothelitism</a>, and had Maximus exiled for his refusal to agree to Monothelite teachings.</div></div>

The Monothelite position was promulgated by <a href="/wiki/Patriarch_Sergius_I_of_Constantinople" id="w">Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople</a> and by Maximus&#39; friend and successor as the Abbot of Chrysopolis, <a href="/wiki/Patriarch_Pyrrhus_I_of_Constantinople" id="w">Pyrrhus</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Following the death of Sergius in <a href="/wiki/638" id="w">638</a>, Pyrrhus succeeded him as Patriarch, but was shortly deposed due to political circumstances. During Pyrrhus&#39; exile from Constantinople, Maximus and the deposed Patriarch held a public debate on the issue of Monothelitism. In the debate, which was held in the presence of many North African bishops, Maximus took the position that Jesus possessed both a human and a divine will. The result of the debate was that Pyrrhus admitted the error of the Monothelite position, and Maximus accompanied him to Rome in 645.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> However, on the death of Emperor Heraclius and the ascension of Emperor <a href="/wiki/Constans_II" id="w">Constans II</a>, Pyrrhus returned to Constantinople and recanted of his acceptance of the <a href="/wiki/Dyothelite" id="w">Dyothelite</a> (&#34;two wills&#34;) position.</p>
<p>Maximus may have remained in Rome, because he was present when the newly elected <a href="/wiki/Pope_Martin_I" id="w">Pope Martin I</a> convened a gathering of bishops at the <a href="/wiki/Basilica_of_St._John_Lateran" id="w">Lateran Basilica</a> in Rome in <a href="/wiki/649" id="w">649</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which some believe may have been written by Maximus.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in <a href="/wiki/653" id="w">653</a> under orders from <a href="/wiki/Constans_II" id="w">Constans II</a>, who supported the Monothelite doctrine. Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could be sent to the Imperial Capital.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Trial_and_exile" name="Trial_and_exile"></a><h3>Trial and exile</h3>
<p>Maximus&#39; refusal to accept Monothelitism caused him to be brought to the imperial capital of <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a> to be tried as a <a href="/wiki/Heresy" id="w">heretic</a> in <a href="/wiki/658" id="w">658</a>. In Constantinople, the Monothelite position had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position, and was sent back into exile for four more years.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/662" id="w">662</a>, Maximus was placed on trial once more, and was once more convicted of <a href="/wiki/Heresy" id="w">heresy</a>. Following the trial Maximus was <a href="/wiki/Tortured" id="w">tortured</a>, having his tongue cut out, so he could no longer speak his rebellion and his right hand cut off, so that he could no longer write letters .<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Maximus was then exiled to the <a href="/wiki/Lazica" id="w">Lazica</a> or <a href="/wiki/Colchis" id="w">Colchis</a> region of <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(country)" id="w">Georgia</a> (perhaps the city of <a href="/wiki/Skhimar" id="w">Skhimar</a>) where he died in exile of natural causes on <a href="/wiki/13_August" id="w">13 August</a>, <a href="/wiki/662" id="w">662</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by <a href="/wiki/Anastasius_Bibliothecarius" id="w">Anastasius Bibliothecarius</a>.</p>

Along with Pope Martin I, Maximus was vindicated by the <a href="/wiki/Third_Council_of_Constantinople" id="w">Third Council of Constantinople</a> (the Sixth <a href="/wiki/Ecumenical_Council" id="w">Ecumenical Council</a>, 680–681), which declared that <a href="/wiki/Christ" id="w">Christ</a> possessed both a human and a divine will. With this declaration Monothelitism became heresy, and Maximus was posthumously declared innocent of all charges against him.</p>
<p>Maximus is among those Christians who were venerated as <a href="/wiki/Saint" id="w">saints</a> shortly after their deaths. The vindication of Maximus&#39; theological position made him extremely popular within a generation after his death, and his cause was aided by the accounts of miracles at his tomb.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> In the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic Church</a> the veneration of Maximus began prior to the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/Congregation_for_the_Causes_of_Saints" id="w">Congregation for the Causes of Saints</a>.</p>
<a id="Theology" name="Theology"></a><h3>Theology</h3>
<p>As a student of Pseudo-Dionysius, Maximus was one of many Christian theologians who preserved and interpreted the earlier <a href="/wiki/Neo-Platonic" id="w">Neo-Platonic</a> philosophy, including the thought of such figures as <a href="/wiki/Plotinus" id="w">Plotinus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Proclus" id="w">Proclus</a>. Maximus&#39; work on Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite was continued by <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Scotus_Eriugena" id="w">John Scotus Erigena</a> at the request of <a href="/wiki/Charles_the_Bald" id="w">Charles the Bald</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Platonic influence on Maximus&#39; thought can be seen most clearly in his <a href="/wiki/Philosophical_anthropology" id="w">theological anthropology</a>. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of <a href="/wiki/Neoplatonism#Teachings" id="w">exidus-reditus</a> (exit and return), teaching that humanity was made in the image of God, and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity with God.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> This emphasis on <a href="/wiki/Divinization" id="w">divinization</a> or <a href="/wiki/Theosis" id="w">theosis</a> helped secure Maximus&#39; place in Eastern theology, as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Christologically Maximus insisted on a strict <a href="/wiki/Dyophysitism" id="w">Dyophysitism</a>, which can be seen as a corollary of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Regarding salvation, Maximus, like <a href="/wiki/Origen" id="w">Origen</a> and <a href="/wiki/St._Gregory_of_Nyssa" id="w">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, believed in <a href="/wiki/Apokatastasis" id="w">apokatastasis</a>, the idea that all rational souls will eventually be redeemed.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> He shared his belief in <a href="/wiki/Universal_reconciliation" id="w">universal reconciliation</a> only with his most spiritually mature students.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other than the work by another Christian universalist, Scotus in <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a>, Maximus was largely overlooked by Western theologians until recent years.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The situation is different in Eastern Christianity, where Maximus has always been influential. The Eastern theologians <a href="/wiki/Simeon_the_New_Theologian" id="w">Simeon the New Theologian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gregory_Palamas" id="w">Gregory Palamas</a> are seen as intellectual heirs to Maximus. Further, a number of Maximus&#39; works are included in the Greek <a href="/wiki/Philokalia" id="w">Philokalia</a> - a collection of some of the most influential <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> Christian writers.</p>
