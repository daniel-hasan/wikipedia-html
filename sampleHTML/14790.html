<b>Ice hockey</b>, often referred to simply as <b>hockey</b> in <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, is a team <a href="/wiki/Sport" id="w">sport</a> played on <a href="/wiki/Ice" id="w">ice</a>. It is a speedy and physical sport. Ice hockey is most popular in areas that are sufficiently cold for natural, reliable seasonal ice cover, though with the advent of indoor artificial <a href="/wiki/Ice_rink" id="w">ice rinks</a> it has become a year-round pastime at the amateur level in major metropolitan areas such as cities that host a <a href="/wiki/National_Hockey_League" id="w">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) or other professional-league team.  It is one of the four <a href="/wiki/Major_professional_sports_league" id="w">major North American professional sports</a>, and is represented by the <a href="/wiki/National_Hockey_League" id="w">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) at the highest level, and the <a href="/wiki/National_Women%26%2339%3Bs_Hockey_League" id="w">National Women&#39;s Hockey League</a> (NWHL), the highest level of women&#39;s ice hockey in the world.

Games between teams hitting an object with curved sticks have been played throughout history; 4000 year-old drawings at the huge tombs in <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a> depict a sport resembling <a href="/wiki/Field_hockey" id="w">field hockey</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The 1527 Galway Statutes in <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a> made reference to <i>&#34;the horlinge of the litill balle with hockie stickes or staves.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Etymology" id="w">etymology</a> of the word hockey is uncertain. It may derive from the <a href="/wiki/Old_French" id="w">Old French</a> word <i>hoquet</i>, <a href="/wiki/Shepherd%26%2339%3Bs_crook" id="w">shepherd&#39;s crook</a>, or from the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Dutch" id="w">Middle Dutch</a> word <i>hokkie</i>, meaning <a href="/wiki/Shack" id="w">shack</a> or <a href="/wiki/Doghouse" id="w">doghouse</a>, which in popular use meant <a href="/wiki/Goal_(ice_hockey)" id="w">goal</a>. Many of these games were developed for fields, though where conditions allowed they were also played on ice. 17th century <a href="/wiki/Dutch_paintings" id="w">Dutch paintings</a> show townsfolk playing a hockey-like game on a frozen <a href="/wiki/Canal" id="w">canal</a>.  </p>
<p>European immigrants brought various versions of hockey-like games to North America, such as the <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Irish</a> sport of <a href="/wiki/Hurling" id="w">hurling</a>, the closely-related <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scottish</a> sport of <a href="/wiki/Shinty" id="w">shinty</a>, and versions of field hockey played in England. Where necessary these seem to have been adapted for icy conditions; for example, a colonial <a href="/wiki/Williamsburg%2C_Virginia" id="w">Williamsburg</a> newspaper records hockey being played in a <a href="/wiki/Snow_storm" id="w">snow storm</a> in Virginia. Early paintings show &#34;shinney&#34;, an early form of hockey with no standard rules, being played in <a href="/wiki/Nova_Scotia" id="w">Nova Scotia</a>. Author <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Chandler_Haliburton" id="w">Thomas Chandler Haliburton</a> wrote in a book of fiction, about boys from King&#39;s College School in <a href="/wiki/Windsor%2C_Nova_Scotia" id="w">Windsor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nova_Scotia" id="w">Nova Scotia</a>, playing <i>&#34;hurley on the ice&#34;</i> when he was a student there around 1800 (Haliburton was born in 1796).<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> To this day, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Shinny" id="w">Shinny</a>&#34; (derived from Shinty) is a popular <a href="/wiki/Canadian" id="w">Canadian</a> term for an informal type of hockey, either on ice or as <a href="/wiki/Street_hockey" id="w">street hockey</a>.

<p>In 1825 <a href="/wiki/John_Franklin" id="w">Sir John Franklin</a> wrote that <i>&#34;The game of hockey played on the ice was the morning sport&#34;</i> while on <a href="/wiki/Great_Bear_Lake" id="w">Great Bear Lake</a> during one of his <a href="/wiki/Arctic" id="w">Arctic</a> expeditions.  In 1843 a British Army officer in <a href="/wiki/Kingston%2C_Ontario" id="w">Kingston</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ontario" id="w">Ontario</a>, wrote <i>&#34;Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-queens_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-queens" title="">[5]</a></sup> A Boston Evening Gazette article from 1859 makes reference to an early game of hockey on ice occurring in Halifax in that year. </p>
<p>Based on Haliburton&#39;s writings, there have been claims that modern ice hockey originated in Windsor, Nova Scotia, and was named after an individual, as in &#39;Colonel Hockey&#39;s game&#39;.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Proponents of this theory claim that the surname <i>Hockey</i> exists in the district surrounding Windsor. In 1943, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association declared Kingston the birthplace of hockey, based on a recorded 1886 game played between students of <a href="/wiki/Queen%26%2339%3Bs_University" id="w">Queen&#39;s University</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Military_College_of_Canada" id="w">Royal Military College of Canada</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Society_for_International_Hockey_Research" id="w">Society for International Hockey Research</a> has had an &#34;origins of hockey&#34; committee studying this debate since 2001 and they defined hockey as: &#34;a game played on an ice rink in which two opposing teams of skaters, using curved sticks, try to drive a small disc, ball or block into or through the opposite goals.&#34;</p>
<p>The committee found evidence of stick and ball games played on ice on skates in Europe in the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries, and viewed these activities as being more indicative of a hockey-like game than Haliburton’s reference.</p>
<p>They found no evidence in the Windsor position of a connection from whatever form of hockey might have been played at Long Pond to the game played elsewhere and to modern hockey. The committee viewed as conjecture the assertion that King’s schoolboys introduced the game to Halifax. They noted that the assertion that hockey was not played outside Nova Scotia until 1865 overlooks diary evidence of shinny and hockey being played at Kingston in the 1840s.</p>
<p>The committee concluded that Dr. Vaughan and the Windsor Hockey Heritage Society had not offered credible evidence that Windsor, Nova Scotia, is the birthplace of hockey.</p>
<p>The committee offered no opinion on the birth date or birthplace of hockey, but took note of a game at Montreal’s <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Skating_Rink" id="w">Victoria Skating Rink</a> on <a href="/wiki/March_3" id="w">March 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/1875" id="w">1875</a>. This is the earliest eyewitness account known to the committee of a specific game of hockey in a specific place at a specific time, and with a recorded score, between two identified teams.</p>
<p>According to the Society for International Hockey Research, the word puck is derived from the Scottish and Gaelic word &#34;puc&#34; or the Irish word &#34;poc&#34;, meaning to poke, punch or deliver a blow. This definition is explained in a book published in 1910 entitled &#34;English as we Speak it in Ireland&#34; by P.W. Joyce. It defines the word puck as &#34;... The blow given by a hurler to the ball with his caman or hurley is always called a puck&#34;.</p>

<p>The foundation of the modern game centres on <a href="/wiki/Montreal" id="w">Montreal</a>. On March 3, 1875 the first organized indoor game was played at Montreal&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Skating_Rink" id="w">Victoria Skating Rink</a> by <a href="/wiki/James_Creighton_(hockey)" id="w">James Creighton</a> and several <a href="/wiki/McGill_University" id="w">McGill University</a> students. In 1877, several McGill students, including Creighton, Henry Joseph, Richard F. Smith, W.F. Robertson, and W.L. Murray codified seven ice hockey rules. The first ice hockey club, McGill University Hockey Club, was founded in 1877.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The game became so popular that the first &#34;world championship&#34; of ice hockey was featured in Montreal&#39;s annual Winter Carnival in 1883 and the McGill team captured the &#34;Carnival Cup&#34;.  Although undocumented, it is believed that during the same year, the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_University_Ice_Hockey_Club" id="w">Oxford University Ice Hockey Club</a> was formed to play the first <a href="/wiki/Ice_Hockey_Varsity_Match" id="w">Ice Hockey Varsity Match</a> against traditional rival <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_University_Ice_Hockey_Club" id="w">Cambridge</a> in St. Moritz, Switzerland.

In 1892, recognizing that there was no recognition for the best team, he purchased a decorative bowl for use as a trophy. The Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, which later became more famously known as the <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Cup" id="w">Stanley Cup</a>, was first awarded in 1893 to the champion amateur team in Canada, <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Hockey_Club" id="w">Montreal HC</a>.

<p>By 1893, there were almost a hundred teams in Montreal alone, and leagues throughout Canada. <a href="/wiki/Winnipeg%2C_Manitoba" id="w">Winnipeg</a> hockey players had incorporated <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricket</a> pads to better protect the <a href="/wiki/Goaltender" id="w">goaltender&#39;s</a> legs.

<p>Professional ice hockey has existed since before <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>. From the first professional ice hockey league based out of <a href="/wiki/Houghton%2C_Michigan" id="w">Houghton, Michigan</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, it quickly grew into <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> and in many other countries, including <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" id="w">Ukraine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">Great Britain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austria</a>.</p>
<a id="Equipment" name="Equipment"></a><h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>{{main}}
Since hockey is a full contact sport and body checks are allowed, ice hockey tends to be a dangerous game. Protective equipment is highly recommended and is enforced in all competitive situations. This usually includes a helmet, shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts, a &#39;jock&#39; athletic protector, shin pads, chest protector and a neck guard.</p>
<a id="Game" name="Game"></a><h2>Game</h2>
<p>While the general characteristics of the game are the same wherever it is played, the exact rules depend on the particular <a href="/wiki/Ice_hockey_rules" id="w">code of play</a> being used. The two most important codes are those of the <a href="/wiki/International_Ice_Hockey_Federation" id="w">International Ice Hockey Federation</a> (IIHF)<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> and of the North American <a href="/wiki/National_Hockey_League" id="w">National Hockey League</a> (NHL).<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> </p>

Ice hockey is played on a <i><a href="/wiki/Hockey_rink" id="w">hockey rink</a></i>. During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, each of whom is on <i><a href="/wiki/Ice_skate" id="w">ice skates</a></i>.  There are five players and one <i><a href="/wiki/Goaltender" id="w">goaltender</a></i> per side. The objective of the game is to score <i><a href="/wiki/Goal_(ice_hockey)" id="w">goals</a></i> by shooting a hard <a href="/wiki/Vulcanization" id="w">vulcanized</a> <a href="/wiki/Rubber" id="w">rubber</a> disc, the <i><a href="/wiki/Hockey_puck" id="w">puck</a></i>, into the opponent&#39;s goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players may control the puck using a long <a href="/wiki/Hockey_stick" id="w">stick</a> with a blade that is commonly curved at one end. Players may also redirect the puck with any part of their bodies, subject to certain restrictions. Players can angle their feet so the puck can redirect into the net, but there can be no kicking motion.  Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.</p>
<p>Hockey is an &#34;offside&#34; game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s hockey was an onside game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. The period of the onside game was the golden age of stick-handling, which was of prime importance in moving the game forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a truly team sport, where individual heroics diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>The five players other than the goaltender are typically divided into three forwards and two defencemen. The <i><a href="/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)" id="w">forward</a></i> positions consist of a <i><a href="/wiki/Centre_(ice_hockey)" id="w">centre</a></i> and two <i><a href="/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)" id="w">wingers</a></i>: a <i>left wing</i> and a <i>right wing</i>. Forwards often play together as units or <i>lines</i>, with the same three forwards always playing together. The <i><a href="/wiki/Defenceman_(ice_hockey)" id="w">defencemen</a></i> usually stay together as a pair, but may change less frequently than the forwards. A substitution of an entire unit at once is called a <i>line change</i>. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when <i><a href="/wiki/Shorthanded" id="w">shorthanded</a></i> or on a <i><a href="/wiki/Powerplay" id="w">power play</a></i>. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the course of the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing <i>on the fly</i>. A new NHL rule added in the 2005-2006 season prevents a team from changing their line after they <i><a href="/wiki/Icing_(ice_hockey)" id="w">ice</a></i> the puck.</p>
<p>The boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play (they can also be used as tools to play the puck), and play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a <i><a href="/wiki/Faceoff" id="w">faceoff</a></i>. There are two major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck: <i><a href="/wiki/Offside_(ice_hockey)" id="w">offsides</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Icing_(ice_hockey)" id="w">icing</a></i>.</p>
<p>Under IIHF rules, each team may carry a maximum of 20 players and two goaltenders on their roster. NHL rules restrict the total number of players per game to 18 plus two goaltenders.</p>

For most penalties, the offending player is sent to the <i><a href="/wiki/Penalty_box" id="w">penalty box</a></i> and his team has to play without him and with one less skater for a short amount of time.  Most penalties last for two minutes unless a major penalty has been assessed. The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing <i><a href="/wiki/Shorthanded" id="w">shorthanded</a></i> while the other team is on the <i><a href="/wiki/Power_play" id="w">power play</a></i>.</p>
<p>A two-minute <i>minor penalty</i> is often called for lesser infractions such as tripping, elbowing, roughing, high-sticking, too many players on the ice, illegal equipment, charging (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), holding, interference, delay of game, hooking, or cross-checking. In the 2005-06 NHL season, a minor is also assessed for diving, where a player embellishes a hook or trip.  More egregious fouls of this type may be penalized by a four-minute <i>double-minor</i> penalty, particularly those which (inadvertently) cause injury to the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or the other team scores on the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score (effectively expiring the first minor). Five-minute <i>major penalties</i> are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. The foul of &#39;boarding&#39;, defined as &#34;check[ing] an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards&#34; by the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf">NHL Rulebook</a> is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violence of the hit. A minor or major penalty for &#34;Boarding&#34; is also often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.</p>
<p>Some varieties of penalties do not always require the offending team to play a man short. Five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, they both serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player (both teams still have a full complement of players on the ice). This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In that case, both teams will have only four skating players (not counting the goaltender) until one or both penalties expire (if one expires before the other, the opposing team gets a power play for the remainder); this applies regardless of current pending penalties, though in the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Ten-minute <i>misconduct</i> penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice <i>unless</i> a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a <i>two-and-ten</i> or <i>five-and-ten</i>). In that case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, <i>game misconducts</i> are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent (at the officials&#39; discretion), or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface (he does not sit in the penalty box); meanwhile, if a minor or major is assessed in addition, a designated player must serve out that segment of the penalty in the box (similar to the above-mentioned &#34;two-and-ten&#34;).</p>
<p>A player who is tripped, or illegally obstructed in some way, by an opponent on a <i><a href="/wiki/Breakaway_(ice_hockey)" id="w">breakaway</a></i>&#160;&#8211; when there are no defenders except the goaltender between him and the opponent&#39;s goal&#160;&#8211; is awarded a <i><a href="/wiki/Penalty_shot_(ice_hockey)" id="w">penalty shot</a></i>, an attempt to score without opposition from any defenders except the goaltender. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway in order to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.

<p>Officials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one&#39;s hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one&#39;s defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game). In the NHL, there is an area behind the goal line that goaltenders are not allowed to play the puck.  Doing so also results in a delay of game minor.</p>
<p>A new penalty in the NHL applies to the goalies.  The goalies now are unable to play the puck in the &#34;corners&#34; of the rink near their own net. This will result in a two-minute penalty against the goalie&#39;s team. The area immediately behind the net is the only area behind the net in which the goalie can play the puck.</p>
<p>An additional rule that is not a penalty in the new NHL is the two line offside passes. There are no more two-line offside pass whistles blown.  Now players are able to pass to teammates who are more than the blue and centre ice red line away.</p>
<p>The NHL has taken steps to speed the game of hockey up and create a game of finesse, which is different from the past where hockey was a game of hits, fights, and penalties.  Today&#39;s game of hockey is a stricter called game which in-turn provides more protection to the players and allows for more goals to be scored.</p>
<p>There are many infractions for which a player may be assessed a <i><a href="/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)" id="w">penalty</a></i>. The governing body for United States amateur hockey has implemented many new rules to reduce the number stick-on-body occurrences, as well as other detrimental and illegal facets of the game (&#34;Zero Tolerance&#34;).</p>
<p>In men&#39;s hockey, but not in women&#39;s, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it.  This use of the hip and shoulder is called <i>body <a href="/wiki/Checking_(ice_hockey)" id="w">checking</a>.</i> Not all physical contact is legal &#8212; in particular, hits from behind and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal.</p>

<a id="Officials" name="Officials"></a><h2>Officials</h2>

<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>A typical game of ice hockey has two to four <i><a href="/wiki/Official_(ice_hockey)" id="w">officials</a></i> on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two <i>linesmen</i> who are responsible only for calling offside and <a href="/wiki/Icing_(ice_hockey)" id="w">icing</a> violations, and one or two <i>referees</i>, who call goals and all other penalties. <i>Linesmen</i> can, however, report to the <i>referee(s)</i> that a penalty more severe than a two-minute minor penalty should be assessed against an offending player.  On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.</p>
<p>Officials are selected by the league for which they work.  Amateur hockey leagues use guidelines established by national organizing bodies as a basis for choosing their officiating staffs. In North America, the national organizing bodies <a href="/wiki/Hockey_Canada" id="w">Hockey Canada</a> and <a href="/wiki/USA_Hockey" id="w">USA Hockey</a> approve officials according to their experience level as well as their ability to pass rules knowledge and skating ability tests.

</p>
<p>An important defensive tactic is <i><a href="/wiki/Checking_(hockey)" id="w">checking</a></i>&#160;&#8211; attempting to take the puck from an opponent or to remove the opponent from play. <i>Forechecking</i> is checking in the other team&#39;s zone; <i>backchecking</i> is checking while the other team is advancing down the ice toward one&#39;s own goal. These terms usually are applied to checking by forwards. <i>Stick checking</i>, <i>sweep checking</i>, and <i>poke checking</i> are legal uses of the stick to obtain possession of the puck. <i>Body checking</i> is using one&#39;s shoulder or hip to strike an opponent who has the puck or who is the last to have touched it (within a short period of time after possession; usually less than three seconds). Often the term checking is used to refer to body checking, with its true definition generally only propagated among fans of the game.</p>
<p>Offensive tactics include improving a team&#39;s position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one&#39;s zone towards the opponent&#39;s zone, progressively by gaining lines, first your own blue line, then the red line and finally the opponent&#39;s blue line. NHL rules instated for the 2006 season redefined <a href="/wiki/Icing_(ice_hockey)" id="w">icing</a> to make the <a href="/wiki/Two-line_pass" id="w">two-line pass</a> legal; a player may pass the puck from behind his own blue line, past both that blue line and the centre red line, to a player in front of the opponents&#39; blue line. In fact, an errant pass that would normally result in an icing call is negated if the player for whom the pass was intended gains possession of the puck before it crosses the opponents&#39; goal line; thus a &#34;three-line pass&#34; can be attempted with a fast forward as long as an <a href="/wiki/Offside_(ice_hockey)" id="w">offsides</a> is not committed. Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot. When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent&#39;s goal, he or she is said to <a href="/wiki/Shot_(hockey)" id="w">shoot the puck</a>.

</p>
<p>A <i>deflection</i> is a shot which redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player, by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal. A <i>one-timer</i> is a shot which is struck directly off a pass, without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions. A <i>deke</i> (short for <i>decoy</i>) is a feint with the body and/or stick to fool a defender or the goalie. <i>Headmanning the puck</i>, also known as <i>cherry-picking</i> or <i>breaking out</i>, is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice.</p>
<p>A team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to <i>pull the goalie</i>; that is, removing the goaltender and replacing him or her with an <i><a href="/wiki/Extra_attacker" id="w">extra attacker</a></i> on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. However, it is an act of desperation, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the <i>empty net</i>.</p>
<p>A <i>delayed penalty</i> is a penalty offense committed by the team that does not have possession of the puck. In this circumstance the team with possession of the puck is allowed to complete the play; that is, play continues until a goal is scored, the puck is shot, stopped and controlled by the opposing goalie, a player on the opposing team gains control of the puck, or the team in possession commits an infraction or penalty of their own. Because the team on which the penalty was called cannot control the puck without stopping play, it is impossible for them to score a goal; in these cases the team in possession of the puck can pull the goalie for an extra attacker without fear of being scored on. This situation ends as soon as the team in possession completes the play and the penalty is assessed (if a delayed penalty is signalled and the team in possession scores, the penalty is still assessed to the offending player).</p>
<p>Although it is officially prohibited in the rules, at the professional level in North America <a href="/wiki/Fighting_in_hockey" id="w">fights</a> are sometimes used to affect morale of the teams, with aggressors hoping to demoralize the opposing players while exciting their own, as well as settling personal scores. Both players in an altercation receive five-minute major penalties for fighting. The player deemed to be the &#34;instigator&#34; of an NHL fight, if one is determined to exist, is penalized an additional two minutes for instigating, plus a ten-minute misconduct penalty. If there is no instigator, both players stay in the penalty box for five minutes, and neither team loses skaters.  They point to less extreme on-ice violence during the era before the rule was introduced. <a href="/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs" id="w">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> owner <a href="/wiki/Conn_Smythe" id="w">Conn Smythe</a> famously observed that &#34;If you can&#39;t beat &#39;em in the alley you can&#39;t beat &#39;em on the ice.&#34;<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>

<p>The Neutral zone trap:<br/>
The trap is designed to isolate the puck carrier in the neutral zone preventing him from entering the offensive zone. In youth hockey development of the neutral zone trap often begins with the left wing lock. In this tactic the left wing plays in the normal position of the left defence men while in the offensive zone. The left defenceman then moves to the centre.  The centre and right wing chase the puck.  When the opposing team gains control of the puck, the defencemen and the left wing pull out and set a two man trap along the boards.  The left or right wing available, backs up the trap while the centre and right wing pursuit and try to get in front of the play further blocking the offensive attack.</p>
<a id="Periods_and_overtime" name="Periods_and_overtime"></a><h2>Periods and overtime</h2>
<p>A game consists of three <i>periods</i> of twenty minutes each, the clock running only when the puck is in play. The teams change ends for the second period, again for the third period, and again at the start of each overtime played. Recreational leagues and children&#39;s leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play.</p>
<p>Various procedures are used if a game is tied. In tournament play, as well as in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour <i>sudden death <a href="/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)" id="w">overtime</a></i>, in which the teams continue to play 20 minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999-2000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single 5 minute sudden death period with 5 players (plus a goalie) per side, with the winner awarded 2 points in the standings and the loser 0 points. In the event of a tie (if the OT was scoreless), each team was awarded 1 point. From 1999-2000 until 2003-04 the <a href="/wiki/National_Hockey_League" id="w">National Hockey League</a> decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden death overtime period with each team having 4 players (plus a goalie) per side to &#34;open-up&#34; the game. In the event of a tie, each team would still receive 1 point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded 2 points in the standings and the losing team 1 point. The only exception to this rule is if a team opts to pull their goalie in exchange for an extra skater during overtime and is subsequently scored upon (an &#39;Empty Net&#39; goal), in which case the losing team receives no points for the overtime loss.  International play and several North American professional leagues, including the NHL (in the regular season), now use an overtime period followed by a <a href="/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)#Shoot out" id="w">penalty shootout</a>. If the score remains tied after an extra overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of three players from each team taking <a href="/wiki/Penalty_shot_(ice_hockey)" id="w">penalty shots</a>. After these six total shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, the shootout then proceeds to a <i>sudden death</i> (actually sudden victory) format. Regardless of the number of goals scored during the shootout by either team, the final score recorded will award the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time. In the NHL if a game is decided by a shootout the winning team is awarded 2 points in the standings and the losing team is awarded 1. Ties no longer occur in the <a href="/wiki/NHL" id="w">NHL</a>. </p>

The annual men&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ice_Hockey_World_Championships" id="w">Ice Hockey World Championships</a> are highly regarded by Europeans, but they are less important to North Americans because they coincide with the <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Cup" id="w">Stanley Cup</a> playoffs. Consequently, Canada, the United States, and other countries with large numbers of NHL players have not always been able to field their best possible teams because many of their top players are playing for the Stanley Cup. Furthermore, for many years professionals were barred from play. Now that many Europeans play in the NHL, the world championships no longer represent all of the world&#39;s top players.</p>
<p>Hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924 (and at the summer games in 1920). Canada won six of the first seven gold medals. The United States won their first gold medal in 1960. The <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">USSR</a> won all but two Olympic ice hockey gold medals from 1956 to 1988 and won a final time as the <a href="/wiki/Unified_Team" id="w">Unified Team</a> at the <a href="/wiki/1992_Winter_Olympics" id="w">1992 Albertville Olympics</a>. U.S. amateur college players defeated the heavily favored Soviet squad on the way to winning the <a href="/wiki/Gold_medal" id="w">gold medal</a> at the <a href="/wiki/1980_Winter_Olympics" id="w">1980 Lake Placid Olympics</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Summit_Series" id="w">1972 Summit Series</a> and <a href="/wiki/1974_Summit_Series" id="w">1974 Summit Series</a>,  established <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> and the <a href="/wiki/USSR" id="w">USSR</a> as a major international ice hockey rivalry. It was followed by five <a href="/wiki/Canada_Cup" id="w">Canada Cup</a> tournaments, where the best players from every hockey nation could play, and two exhibition series, the 1979 <a href="/wiki/1979_Challenge_Cup" id="w">Challenge Cup</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rendez-vous_%26%2339%3B87" id="w">Rendez-vous &#39;87</a> where the best players from the NHL played the USSR. The Canada Cup tournament later became the <a href="/wiki/World_Cup_of_Hockey" id="w">World Cup of Hockey</a>, played in 1996 and 2004. The United States won in 1996 and Canada won in 2004. Since 1998, NHL professionals have played in the Olympics, giving the best players in the world more opportunities to face off.</p>

<a id="Films" name="Films"></a><h4>Films</h4>
<p>Like all of the major sports, hockey plays a major part in American popular culture. Though it is the least popular of the four major professional sports in the US (<a href="/wiki/American_football" id="w">American football</a>, <a href="/wiki/Baseball" id="w">baseball</a>, <a href="/wiki/Basketball" id="w">basketball</a>, and hockey), a number of notable <a href="/wiki/Hollywood" id="w">Hollywood</a> films have been made about hockey. Notable hockey films include <i><a href="/wiki/Slap_Shot_(movie)" id="w">Slap Shot</a></i> (1977), <i><a href="/wiki/The_Mighty_Ducks_(movies)" id="w">The Mighty Ducks</a></i> (1992, successful enough to spawn two sequels and an NHL team named the <a href="/wiki/Mighty_Ducks_of_Anaheim" id="w">Mighty Ducks of Anaheim</a> (now the Anaheim Ducks), and <i><a href="/wiki/Miracle_(film)" id="w">Miracle</a></i> (2004). The first two are fictional comedies; the last is a drama based on the true story of the 1980 &#34;Miracle on Ice&#34; USA Olympic gold medal team. Other hockey films include <i><a href="/wiki/Youngblood_(1986_movie)" id="w">Youngblood</a>,</i> <i><a href="/wiki/Hockey_Night" id="w">Hockey Night</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/MVP:_Most_Valuable_Primate" id="w">MVP: Most Valuable Primate</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/H-E_Double_Hockey_Sticks" id="w">H-E Double Hockey Sticks</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Mystery%2C_Alaska" id="w">Mystery, Alaska</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Rocket_(film)" id="w">The Rocket: The Maurice Richard Story</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sweater" id="w">The Sweater</a></i> and the 1937 <a href="/wiki/John_Wayne" id="w">John Wayne</a> film <i>Idol of the Crowds </i>. Many other films are less hockey-oriented but nonetheless prominently involve the sport. Both <i><a href="/wiki/Happy_Gilmore" id="w">Happy Gilmore</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Cutting_Edge" id="w">The Cutting Edge</a></i> centre around failed hockey players using their talents for other sports (<a href="/wiki/Golf" id="w">golf</a> and <a href="/wiki/Figure_skating" id="w">figure skating</a>, respectively), while <i><a href="/wiki/Wayne%26%2339%3Bs_World_(film)" id="w">Wayne&#39;s World</a></i> contains a number of prominent references to the sport during the film. The Jean-Claude Van Damme starrer <i><a href="/wiki/Sudden_Death_(film)" id="w">Sudden Death</a></i> (1995) is set and shot entirely in the <a href="/wiki/Mellon_Arena" id="w">Pittsburgh Civic Arena</a>, the (supposed) stage for the seventh game of the NHL Stanley Cup finals. While <i><a href="/wiki/National_Lampoon%26%2339%3Bs_Christmas_Vacation" id="w">National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation</a></i> was never a hockey movie, <a href="/wiki/Chevy_Chase" id="w">Chevy Chase</a>&#39;s lead character, Clark Griswold, was famous for wearing a light <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Blackhawks" id="w">Chicago Blackhawks</a> jersey with &#34;Griswold&#34; and the numbers &#34;00&#34; on it during certain scenes. It also plays a part in Disney Channel original movies <i>Go Figure </i> and <a href="/wiki/Genius_(film)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Genius&#39;&#39;</a>, and romantic comedy <i><a href="/wiki/Just_Friends" id="w">Just Friends</a></i>. In Quebec, the movie <i><a href="/wiki/Les_Boys" id="w">Les Boys</a></i> is a cult classic for many hockey fans, enough to spawn three sequels. The fourth installment of <i>Les Boys</i> featured &#34;Hockey Legends&#34; such as <a href="/wiki/Guy_Lafleur" id="w">Guy Lafleur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Bouchard" id="w">Pierre Bouchard</a>, <a href="/wiki/Martin_Brodeur" id="w">Martin Brodeur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yvon_Lambert" id="w">Yvon Lambert</a> and more.  The movie <i><a href="/wiki/Lucky_Luch" id="w">Lucky Luch</a></i> is based off a true person, Joe Michelucci, an aspiring professional hockey player from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The movie shows his struggles through minor hockey and eventually makes the 1992 US national hockey team.</p>
<a id="American_television" name="American_television"></a><h4>American television</h4>
<p>Hockey also frequently shows up in American television, particularly in shows set in the colder regions of the US, such as the Northeast. One of the recurring characters on <i><a href="/wiki/Cheers" id="w">Cheers</a></i> was <a href="/wiki/Eddie_LeBec" id="w">Eddie LeBec</a>, a <a href="/wiki/French-Canadian" id="w">French-Canadian</a> <a href="/wiki/Boston_Bruins" id="w">Boston Bruins</a> goalie who married regular character <a href="/wiki/Carla_Tortelli" id="w">Carla Tortelli</a>. LeBec later was cut from the team and joined a traveling ice show; the character was eventually killed off. One memorable episode of <i><a href="/wiki/Seinfeld" id="w">Seinfeld</a></i>, &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Face_Painter" id="w">The Face Painter</a>&#34;, involves the antics of Elaine&#39;s face-painting boyfriend Puddy, a rabid <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils" id="w">New Jersey Devils</a> fan, and Jerry&#39;s stubborn refusal to thank an acquaintance for <a href="/wiki/New_York_Rangers" id="w">New York Rangers</a> playoff tickets after the game when he had already thanked him numerous times beforehand. In <i><a href="/wiki/NYPD_Blue" id="w">NYPD Blue</a></i>, the character of PA Donna Abandando, played by <a href="/wiki/Gail_O%26%2339%3BGrady" id="w">Gail O&#39;Grady</a> and a love interest of Detective Greg Medavoy in season 3, was a noted New York Rangers fan, having previously dated one of the players. Her Rangers pennant famously hung over her desk at the front of the squad room. Many episodes of <a href="/wiki/Home_Improvement" id="w">Home Improvement</a> included references to the Detroit Red Wings and in one episode, Tim and his neighbour Wilson are at a game when Wilson wins the door prize. Actor <a href="/wiki/Richard_Dean_Anderson" id="w">Richard Dean Anderson</a> has incorporated his personal love of hockey into two of his lead characters: <a href="/wiki/MacGyver" id="w">MacGyver</a>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Stargate_SG-1" id="w">Stargate SG-1</a><b>s <a href="/wiki/Jack_O%26%2339%3BNeill" id="w">Jack O&#39;Neill</a>.

Lisa is eventually forced to become a goaltender on an opposing team—the Kwik-E-Mart Gougers, coached by <a href="/wiki/Apu_Nahasapeemapetilon" id="w">Apu</a>—to avoid a failing grade in <a href="/wiki/Physical_education" id="w">gym</a>, and she blossoms from a nervous wreck to an intimidating star. Eventually, the two teams play each other. Towards the end of the game, Bart is awarded a penalty shot, but before he shoots, he thinks of all his memories with Lisa. Lisa does this as well, and the two embrace each other. The finishes with the two teams tying each other and furious fans destroying the hockey arena. In another episode, Bart answers his teacher&#39;s personal ad and uses the picture of hockey great <a href="/wiki/Gordie_Howe" id="w">Gordie Howe</a>.  More recently, the FX show <a href="/wiki/Rescue_Me_(TV_series)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Rescue Me&#39;&#39;</a>, which stars <a href="/wiki/Denis_Leary" id="w">Denis Leary</a>, has featured hockey games as an integral part of several episodes; <a href="/wiki/Hockey_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Hockey Hall of Famers</a> and former <a href="/wiki/Boston_Bruins" id="w">Boston Bruins</a> forwards <a href="/wiki/Cam_Neely" id="w">Cam Neely</a> and <a href="/wiki/Phil_Esposito" id="w">Phil Esposito</a> have had cameos. Leary&#39;s character plays in the <a href="/wiki/FDNY" id="w">FDNY</a> vs. <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department" id="w">NYPD</a> hockey game.

At the end of one episode of <i><a href="/wiki/Who%26%2339%3Bs_the_Boss%3F" id="w">Who&#39;s the Boss?</a></i>, Tony and Angela are at a hockey game.  Angela asks Tony what the red circle on the ice is for, and Tony indicates that it is blood (humorously furthering the <a href="/wiki/Stereotype" id="w">stereotype</a> of hockey violence). In <i><a href="/wiki/Scrubs_(TV_show)" id="w">Scrubs</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Perry_Cox" id="w">Dr. Cox</a> frequently wears a <a href="/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings" id="w">Detroit Red Wings</a> jersey while not at the hospital; this is because of <a href="/wiki/John_C._McGinley" id="w">John C.

Hockey has also been referenced many times in the series of six movies known as the View Askew Movies, which were written and directed by Actor/Director/Writer/Hockey Fan, Kevin Smith.  His first movie, Clerks (1994), featured a street hockey game played on the roof of a store, however many of the players in the game wore ice hockey jerseys, including the New Jersey Devils, Pittsburgh Penguins, and a CCCP International Jersey.  Mall Rats (1995) featured character Brodie (Jason Lee) playing an ice hockey game for Sega Genesis.  Chasing Amy (1997) featured Joey Adams and Ben Afleck attending a high school ice hockey game.  The other 3 movies, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Clerks II didn&#39;t feature any ice hockey references, however Dogma did feature a street hockey reference.</b></i></p>
