The <b>effects of Hurricane Isabel in Maryland and Washington, D.C.</b>, were among the worst from a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical cyclone</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Baltimore-Washington_Metropolitan_Area" id="w">Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Isabel" id="w">Hurricane Isabel</a> formed from a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_6" id="w">September 6</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>, in the tropical <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a>. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters, it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165&#160;mph (265&#160;km/h) on <a href="/wiki/September_11" id="w">September 11</a>. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Banks" id="w">Outer Banks</a> of <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> with winds of 105&#160;mph (165&#160;km/h) on <a href="/wiki/September_18" id="w">September 18</a>. It quickly weakened over land and became <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" id="w">extratropical</a> over western <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a> the next day.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_19" id="w">September 19</a>, Tropical Storm Isabel passed through extreme western <a href="/wiki/Maryland" id="w">Maryland</a>, though its large circulation produced tropical storm force winds throughout the state.<sup id="_ref-tcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> About 1.24&#160;million people lost power throughout the state. The worst of its effects came from its <a href="/wiki/Storm_surge" id="w">storm surge</a>, which inundated areas along the coast and resulted in severe beach erosion. In <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Shore_of_Maryland" id="w">Eastern Maryland</a>, hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed, primarily in <a href="/wiki/Queen_Anne%26%2339%3Bs_County%2C_Maryland" id="w">Queen Anne&#39;s County</a> from tidal flooding.

Washington, D.C., sustained moderate damage, primarily from the winds.

While Isabel was still over the western <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> as a <a href="/wiki/List_of_Category_5_Atlantic_hurricanes" id="w">Category 5 hurricane</a>, forecasters predicted the storm would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 130&#160;miles (210&#160;km) east-southeast of <a href="/wiki/Ocean_City%2C_Maryland" id="w">Ocean City, Maryland</a> as a 115&#160;mph (185&#160;km/h) major hurricane.<sup id="_ref-lawrence32_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lawrence32" title="">[2]</a></sup> By four days before Isabel made landfall, most <a href="/wiki/Global_climate_model" id="w">computer models</a> predicted Isabel to make landfall between <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a>.<sup id="_ref-avila33_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-avila33" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-archive_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-archive" title="">[4]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>, about two days before the hurricane struck land, the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> issued a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">hurricane watch</a> for the southern region of the Maryland coastline on the <a href="/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay" id="w">Chesapeake Bay</a>. Later that day, a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern Maryland coastline, which was upgraded to a tropical storm warning by about 24&#160;hours before landfall.<sup id="_ref-tcr_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Officials recommended the citizens on <a href="/wiki/Smith_Island%2C_Maryland" id="w">Smith Island</a> to evacuate on the day prior to the hurricane making landfall, the only evacuations for the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Shore_of_Maryland" id="w">Eastern Shore of Maryland</a>.

Officials recommended residents in flood areas of <a href="/wiki/Baltimore_County%2C_Maryland" id="w">Baltimore County</a> to evacuate, and some in the city of <a href="/wiki/Baltimore%2C_Maryland" id="w">Baltimore</a> left spontaneously due to flooding. Evacuation rates were low throughout the Maryland coastline, with the highest rate being in the southernmost counties on the western shore. The primary reason for people staying was due to the track of the hurricane. Between 20% and 33% of those who participated in an evacuation survey said they had concerns about being caught on roadways while trying to evacuate as the storm arrived, with similar numbers expressing concern about being able to return to their homes if they evacuated. Of those who left, most went to the house of a friend or family member, with two-thirds to three-fourths going to destinations in their own neighborhood or county. Most did not evacuate until the day before or the day of landfall. In most areas, the public response to the evacuation orders was normal to fast, with traffic during the evacuation described as light to normal. The most significant problems experienced during the evacuation were downed trees, inadequate signage, flooded roads, or stalled cars. In all, 3,080&#160;people evacuated their homes in preparation for Hurricane Isabel.<sup id="_ref-assess_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-assess" title="">[5]</a></sup> Boats, trucks, and school buses helped more than 1,000&#160;people evacuate the <a href="/wiki/Inner_Harbor" id="w">Inner Harbor</a> of <a href="/wiki/Baltimore%2C_Maryland" id="w">Baltimore</a>, as well.<sup id="_ref-news_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-news" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

In the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Shore_of_Maryland" id="w">Eastern Shore of Maryland</a>, Hurricane Isabel produced a <a href="/wiki/Storm_surge" id="w">storm surge</a> peaking at 8&#160;feet (2.4&#160;m) on the <a href="/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay" id="w">Chesapeake Bay</a> side in <a href="/wiki/List_of_islands_in_Maryland" id="w">Hoopers Island</a> and 6.5&#160;feet (2&#160;m) on the Atlantic coast in <a href="/wiki/Ocean_City%2C_Maryland" id="w">Ocean City</a>.<sup id="_ref-wakefield_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wakefield" title="">[13]</a></sup> The track of the hurricane to the west funneled into the bay and was so strong it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay. <a href="/wiki/Kent_County%2C_Maryland" id="w">Tolchester Beach</a> recorded a record-breaking <a href="/wiki/Storm_tide" id="w">high tide</a> of 7.91&#160;feet (2.4&#160;m) above mean low water.<sup id="_ref-esncdc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-esncdc" title="">[14]</a></sup> Rainfall in the Maryland portion of the <a href="/wiki/Delmarva_Peninsula" id="w">Delmarva Peninsula</a> reached 3.2&#160;inches (81&#160;mm) in <a href="/wiki/Vienna%2C_Maryland" id="w">Steeles Neck</a>.

The damage was mainly due to the tidal flooding, though four homes were destroyed due to falling trees. Moderate wind gusts knocked down numerous trees, tree limbs, and power lines, leaving about 65,750&#160;homes and businesses without power, half of which occurred in <a href="/wiki/Cecil_County%2C_Maryland" id="w">Cecil County</a>.

Some <a href="/wiki/Rainband" id="w">rainbands</a> produced up to 70&#160;mph gusts (113&#160;km/h), and in some areas isolated streaks of damage were described as being caused by tornadoes. Rainfall varied between 2 to 4&#160;inches (50 to 100&#160;mm) across the area, resulting in the <a href="/wiki/Potomac_River" id="w">Potomac River</a> overflowing its banks.
