<b>Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell</b> <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Merit_(Commonwealth)" id="w">OM</a>, <a href="/wiki/Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George" id="w">GCMG</a>, <a href="/wiki/Royal_Victorian_Order" id="w">GCVO</a>, <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath" id="w">KCB</a> (<a href="/wiki/22_February" id="w">22 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1857" id="w">1857</a> – <a href="/wiki/8_January" id="w">8 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>), also known as <b>B-P</b>, was a <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-General_(UK)" id="w">lieutenant-general</a> in the <a href="/wiki/British_Army" id="w">British Army</a>, writer, and founder of the <a href="/wiki/Scouting" id="w">Scout Movement</a>.</p>
<p>After having been educated at <a href="/wiki/Charterhouse_School" id="w">Charterhouse School</a>, Baden-Powell served in the British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa. In 1899, during the <a href="/wiki/Second_Boer_War" id="w">Second Boer War</a> in <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a>, Baden-Powell successfully defended the city in the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Mafeking" id="w">Siege of Mafeking</a>. Several of his military books, written for <a href="/wiki/Military" id="w">military</a> <a href="/wiki/Reconnaissance" id="w">reconnaissance</a> and scout training in his African years, were also read by boys. Based on those earlier books, he wrote <i><a href="/wiki/Scouting_for_Boys" id="w">Scouting for Boys</a></i>, published in 1908 by <a href="/wiki/Sir_Arthur_Pearson%2C_1st_Baronet" id="w">Pearson</a>, for youth readership. During writing, he tested his ideas through a <a href="/wiki/Brownsea_Island_Scout_camp" id="w">camping trip on Brownsea Island</a> that began on <a href="/wiki/1_August" id="w">1 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1907" id="w">1907</a>, which is now seen as the beginning of Scouting.</p>
<p>After his marriage with <a href="/wiki/Olave_Baden-Powell" id="w">Olave St Clair Soames</a>, Baden-Powell, his sister <a href="/wiki/Agnes_Baden-Powell" id="w">Agnes Baden-Powell</a> and notably his wife actively gave guidance to the Scouting Movement and the <a href="/wiki/Girl_Guide_and_Girl_Scout" id="w">Girl Guides Movement</a>. Baden-Powell lived his last years in <a href="/wiki/Nyeri" id="w">Nyeri</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kenya" id="w">Kenya</a>, where he died in 1941.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h1>Early life</h1>
<p>Baden-Powell was born as Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell, or more familiarly as Stephe Powell, at 6 Stanhope Street (now 11 Stanhope Terrace), <a href="/wiki/Paddington" id="w">Paddington</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, <a href="/wiki/UK" id="w">UK</a> on <a href="/wiki/22_February" id="w">22 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1857" id="w">1857</a>.<sup id="_ref-jeal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeal" title="">[1]</a></sup>  His father <a href="/wiki/Reverend" id="w">Reverend</a> <a href="/wiki/Baden_Powell_(mathematician)" id="w">Baden Powell</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Savilian_Professor_of_Geometry" id="w">Savilian Professor of Geometry</a> at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" id="w">Oxford University</a>, already had four teenage children from the second of his two previous marriages. On <a href="/wiki/10_March" id="w">10 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1846" id="w">1846</a> at St Luke&#39;s Church, <a href="/wiki/Chelsea%2C_London" id="w">Chelsea</a>, Reverend Powell married Henrietta Grace Smyth (<a href="/wiki/3_September" id="w">3 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1824" id="w">1824</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/13_October" id="w">13 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a>), eldest daughter of Admiral <a href="/wiki/William_Henry_Smyth" id="w">William Henry Smyth</a> and 28 years his junior. Quickly they had <a href="/wiki/Warington_Baden-Powell" id="w">Warington</a> (early 1847), <a href="/wiki/George_Baden-Powell" id="w">George</a> (late 1847), Augustus (1849) and Francis (1850). After three further children who died when very young, they had Stephe, <a href="/wiki/Agnes_Baden-Powell" id="w">Agnes</a> (1858) and Baden (1860). The three youngest children and the often ill Augustus were close friends. Reverend Powell died when Stephe was three, and as tribute to his father and to set her own children apart from their half-siblings and cousins, the mother changed the family name to <i>Baden-Powell</i>. Subsequently, Stephe was raised by his mother, a strong woman who was determined that her children would succeed. Baden-Powell would say of her in 1933 &#34;The whole secret of my getting on lay with my mother.&#34;<sup id="_ref-jeal_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeal" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-palstra_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-palstra" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-drewery_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-drewery" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>After attending <a href="/wiki/Rose_Hill_School" id="w">Rose Hill School</a>, <a href="/wiki/Royal_Tunbridge_Wells" id="w">Tunbridge Wells</a>, during which his favourite brother Augustus died, Stephe Baden-Powell was awarded a scholarship to <a href="/wiki/Charterhouse_School" id="w">Charterhouse</a>, a prestigious <a href="/wiki/Public_school_(England)" id="w">public school</a>. His first introduction to Scouting skills was through stalking and cooking game while avoiding teachers in the nearby woods, which were strictly out-of-bounds. He also played the <a href="/wiki/Piano" id="w">piano</a> and <a href="/wiki/Violin" id="w">violin</a>, was an <a href="/wiki/Ambidexterity" id="w">ambidextrous</a> artist, and enjoyed <a href="/wiki/Acting" id="w">acting</a>.

<a id="Military_career" name="Military_career"></a><h1>Military career</h1>
<p>In 1876, R.S.S. Baden-Powell, as he styled himself then, joined the <a href="/wiki/13th_Light_Dragoons" id="w">13th Hussars</a> in <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> with the rank of <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant" id="w">lieutenant</a>. He enhanced and honed his <a href="/wiki/Reconnaissance" id="w">military scouting</a> skills amidst the <a href="/wiki/Zulu" id="w">Zulu</a> in the early 1880s in the <a href="/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal" id="w">Natal province</a> of <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a>, where his regiment had been posted, and where he was <a href="/wiki/Mentioned_in_Despatches" id="w">Mentioned in Despatches</a>. During one of his travels, he came across a large string of wooden beads, worn by the Zulu king <a href="/wiki/Dinuzulu_kaCetshwayo" id="w">Dinizulu</a>, which was later incorporated into the <a href="/wiki/Wood_Badge" id="w">Wood Badge</a> training programme he started after he founded the Scouting Movement. Baden-Powell&#39;s skills impressed his superiors and he was <a href="/wiki/Brevet_(military)" id="w">Brevetted Major</a> as Military Secretary and senior <a href="/wiki/Aide-de-camp" id="w">Aide-de-camp</a> of the Commander-in-Chief and Governor of <a href="/wiki/Malta" id="w">Malta</a>, his uncle General Sir Henry Augustus Smyth.<sup id="_ref-jeal_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeal" title="">[1]</a></sup> He was posted in Malta for three years, also working as intelligence officer for the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea" id="w">Mediterranean</a> for the Director of <a href="/wiki/Military_intelligence" id="w">Military Intelligence</a>.<sup id="_ref-jeal_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeal" title="">[1]</a></sup> He frequently travelled disguised as a <a href="/wiki/Insect_collecting" id="w">butterfly collector</a>, incorporating plans of military installations into his drawings of butterfly wings.<sup id="_ref-butterfly_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-butterfly" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Baden-Powell returned to Africa in 1896 to aid the <a href="/wiki/British_South_Africa_Company" id="w">British South Africa Company</a> colonials under siege in <a href="/wiki/Bulawayo" id="w">Bulawayo</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Second_Matabele_War" id="w">Second Matabele War</a>.<sup id="_ref-matabele_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-matabele" title="">[5]</a></sup> This was a formative experience for him not only because he had the time of his life commanding reconnaissance missions into enemy territory in <a href="/wiki/Matobo_National_Park" id="w">Matobo Hills</a>, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here.<sup id="_ref-proctor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-proctor" title="">[6]</a></sup> It was during this campaign that he first met and befriended the American scout <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Russell_Burnham" id="w">Frederick Russell Burnham</a>, who introduced Baden-Powell to the <a href="/wiki/American_Old_West" id="w">American Old West</a> and <i>woodcraft</i> (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Scoutcraft" id="w">scoutcraft</a>), and here that he wore his signature <a href="/wiki/Stetson" id="w">Stetson</a> <a href="/wiki/Campaign_hat" id="w">campaign hat</a> and kerchief for the first time.<sup id="_ref-jeal_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeal" title="">[1]</a></sup> After <a href="/wiki/Rhodesia" id="w">Rhodesia</a>, Baden-Powell took part in a successful British invasion of <a href="/wiki/Ashanti" id="w">Ashanti</a>, West Africa, and at the age of 40 was promoted to lead the <a href="/wiki/5th_(Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales%26%2339%3Bs)_Dragoon_Guards" id="w">5th Dragoon Guards</a> in 1897 in India.<sup id="_ref-barrett_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-barrett" title="">[7]</a></sup> A few years later he wrote a small manual, entitled <i>Aids to Scouting,</i> a summary of lectures he had given on the subject of military scouting, to help train recruits. Using this and other methods he was able to train them to think independently, use their initiative, and survive in the wilderness.</p>
<p>He returned to South Africa prior to the <a href="/wiki/Second_Boer_War" id="w">Second Boer War</a> and was engaged in further military actions against the Zulus. By this time, he had been promoted to be the youngest <a href="/wiki/Colonel" id="w">colonel</a> in the <a href="/wiki/British_Army" id="w">British Army</a>. He was responsible for the organisation of a force of frontiersmen to assist the regular army. While arranging this, he was trapped in the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Mafeking" id="w">Siege of Mafeking</a>, and surrounded by a Boer army, at times in excess of 8,000 men. Although wholly outnumbered, the garrison withstood the siege for 217 days. Much of this is attributable to cunning military deceptions instituted at Baden-Powell&#39;s behest as commander of the garrison. Fake minefields were planted and his soldiers were ordered to simulate avoiding non-existent <a href="/wiki/Barbed_wire" id="w">barbed wire</a> while moving between trenches.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Baden-Powell did most of the reconnaissance work himself.<sup id="_ref-boer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boer" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Contrary views of Baden-Powell&#39;s actions during the Siege of Mafeking pointed out that his success in resisting the Boers was secured at the expense of the lives of African soldiers and civilians, including members of his own African garrison. Pakenham stated that Baden-Powell drastically reduced the rations to the natives&#39; garrison.<sup id="_ref-pakenham_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pakenham" title="">[10]</a></sup> However, Pakenham decidedly retreated from this position.<sup id="_ref-pakenham2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pakenham2" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-jeal_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeal" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

During the siege, a <a href="/wiki/Mafeking_Cadet_Corps" id="w">cadet corps</a>, consisting of white boys below fighting age, was used to stand guard, carry messages, assist in hospitals and so on, freeing the men for military service. Although Baden-Powell did not form this cadet corps himself, and there is no evidence that he took much notice of them during the Siege, he was sufficiently impressed with both their courage and the equanimity with which they performed their tasks to use them later as an object lesson in the first chapter of <i>Scouting for Boys</i>. The siege was lifted in the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Mafeking" id="w">Relief of Mafeking</a> on <a href="/wiki/16_May" id="w">16 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1900" id="w">1900</a>. Promoted to <a href="/wiki/Major-General" id="w">major-general</a>, Baden-Powell became a national hero.<sup id="_ref-NPG_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NPG" title="">[12]</a></sup> After organising the <a href="/wiki/South_African_Police_Service" id="w">South African Constabulary</a>, the national police force, he returned to England to take up a post as <a href="/wiki/Inspector_General" id="w">Inspector General</a> of Cavalry in 1903.</p>
<p>In 1910 lieutenant-general Baden-Powell  decided to retire from the Army on the advice of <a href="/wiki/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">King Edward VII</a>, who suggested that he could better serve his country by promoting Scouting.<sup id="_ref-endmilitary_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-endmilitary" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the outbreak of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> in 1914, Baden-Powell put himself at the disposal of the War Office. No command, however, was given him, for, as <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Kitchener%2C_1st_Earl_Kitchener" id="w">Lord Kitchener</a> said: &#34;he could lay his hand on several competent divisional generals but could find no one who could carry on the invaluable work of the Boy Scouts.&#34;<sup id="_ref-saunders_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-saunders" title="">[15]</a></sup> It was widely rumoured that Baden-Powell was engaged in spying, and intelligence officers took great care to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Inculcate">inculcate</a> the myth.<sup id="_ref-matebele_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-matebele" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>On his return from Africa in 1903, Baden-Powell found that his military training manual, <i>Aids to Scouting</i>, had become a best-seller, and was being used by teachers and youth organisations.<sup id="_ref-best-seller_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-best-seller" title="">[17]</a></sup> Following his involvement in the <a href="/wiki/Boys%26%2339%3B_Brigade" id="w">Boys&#39; Brigade</a> as Brigade Secretary and Officer in charge of its scouting section, with encouragement from his friend, <a href="/wiki/William_Alexander_Smith_(Boys%26%2339%3B_Brigade)" id="w">William Alexander Smith</a>, Baden-Powell decided to re-write <i>Aids to Scouting</i> to suit a youth readership. In August 1907 he held a <a href="/wiki/Brownsea_Island_Scout_camp" id="w">camp on Brownsea Island</a> for twenty-two boys of mixed social background to test out the applicability of his ideas. Baden-Powell was also influenced by <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Thompson_Seton" id="w">Ernest Thompson Seton</a>, who founded the <a href="/wiki/Woodcraft_Indians" id="w">Woodcraft Indians</a>. Seton gave Baden-Powell a copy of his book <i>The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians</i> and they met in 1906.<sup id="_ref-SetonWoo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SetonWoo" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-SetonInfed>{{cite web}}</ref><ref name=_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SetonInfed>{{cite web}}</ref><ref name=" title="">[19]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Scouting_for_Boys" id="w">Scouting for Boys</a></i> was subsequently published in six instalments in 1908.</p>
<p>Boys and girls spontaneously formed <a href="/wiki/Scout_troop" id="w">Scout troops</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Scouting" id="w">Scouting</a> Movement had inadvertently started, first as a national, and soon an international obsession. The Scouting Movement was to grow up in friendly parallel relations with the Boys&#39; Brigade. A rally for all Scouts was held at <a href="/wiki/The_Crystal_Palace" id="w">Crystal Palace</a> in London in 1909, at which Baden-Powell discovered the first <a href="/wiki/Girl_Guide_and_Girl_Scout" id="w">Girl Scouts</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Girl_Guide" id="w">Girl Guide</a> Movement was subsequently founded in 1910 under the auspices of Baden-Powell&#39;s sister, Agnes Baden-Powell. Baden-Powell&#39;s friend, <a href="/wiki/Juliette_Gordon_Low" id="w">Juliette Gordon Low</a>, was encouraged by him to bring the Movement to America, where she founded the <a href="/wiki/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA" id="w">Girl Scouts of the USA</a>.</p>
<p>In 1920, the <a href="/wiki/1st_World_Scout_Jamboree" id="w">1st World Scout Jamboree</a> took place in <a href="/wiki/Olympia%2C_London" id="w">Olympia</a>, and Baden-Powell was acclaimed <a href="/wiki/Chief_Scout_(United_Kingdom)" id="w">Chief Scout</a> of the World. Baden-Powell was created a <a href="/wiki/Baronet" id="w">Baronet</a> in the 1921 New Year Honours and <a href="/wiki/Baron_Baden-Powell" id="w">Baron Baden-Powell</a>, of Gilwell, in the County of Essex, on <a href="/wiki/17_September" id="w">17 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1929" id="w">1929</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gilwell_Park" id="w">Gilwell Park</a> being the International Scout Leader training centre.<sup id="_ref-ThePeerage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ThePeerage" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Burke_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Burke" title="">[21]</a></sup> After receiving this honour, Baden-Powell mostly styled himself &#34;Baden-Powell of Gilwell&#34;.</p>
<p>In 1929, during the <a href="/wiki/3rd_World_Scout_Jamboree" id="w">3rd World Scout Jamboree</a>, he received as a present a new <a href="/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Limited" id="w">Rolls-Royce</a> car and an Eccles <a href="/wiki/Travel_trailer" id="w">Caravan</a>. This combination well served the Baden-Powells in their further travels around <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>. Baden-Powell also had a positive impact on improvements in youth education.<sup id="_ref-education_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-education" title="">[22]</a></sup> Under his dedicated command the world Scouting Movement grew. By 1922 there were more than a million Scouts in 32 countries; by 1939 the number of Scouts was in excess of 3.3&#160;million.<sup id="_ref-nagy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nagy" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/5th_World_Scout_Jamboree" id="w">5th World Scout Jamboree</a> in 1937, Baden-Powell gave his farewell to Scouting, and retired from public Scouting life. <a href="/wiki/22_February" id="w">22 February</a>, the joint birthday of Robert and Olave Baden-Powell, continues to be marked as <a href="/wiki/World_Thinking_Day" id="w">Founder&#39;s Day</a> by Scouts and <a href="/wiki/Thinking_Day" id="w">Thinking Day</a> by Guides to remember and celebrate the work of the Chief Scout and Chief Guide of the World.</p>
<p>In his final letter to the Scouts, Baden-Powell wrote: 
</p><dl><dd>...I have had a most happy life and I want each one of you to have a happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being successful in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. &#39;Be Prepared&#39; in this way, to live happy and to die happy - stick to your Scout Promise always - even after you have ceased to be a boy - and God help you to do it.<sup id="_ref-finalspeech_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-finalspeech" title="">[24]</a></sup></dd></dl>

In January 1912, Baden-Powell met the woman who would be his future wife, <a href="/wiki/Olave_Baden-Powell" id="w">Olave St Clair Soames</a>, on the ocean liner, <i>Arcadian</i>, heading for <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> to start one of his Scouting World Tours.<sup id="_ref-olave_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-olave" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-olaverobert_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-olaverobert" title="">[26]</a></sup> She was a young woman of 23, while he was 55, a not uncommon age difference in <a href="/wiki/Edwardian_period" id="w">that time</a>, and they shared the same birthday. They became engaged in September of the same year, causing a media sensation due to Baden-Powell&#39;s fame. To avoid press intrusion, they married in secret on <a href="/wiki/30_October" id="w">30 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1912" id="w">1912</a>.<sup id="_ref-marriage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-marriage" title="">[27]</a></sup> The Scouts of England each donated a penny to buy Baden-Powell a wedding gift, a car (note that this is not the Rolls-Royce they were presented with in 1929). There is a monument to their marriage inside St Mary&#39;s Church, Brownsea Island.</p>
<p>Baden-Powell and Olave lived in <a href="/wiki/Pax_Hill" id="w">Pax Hill</a> near <a href="/wiki/Bentley%2C_Hampshire" id="w">Bentley, Hampshire</a> and Chapel Farm, <a href="/wiki/Ripley%2C_Surrey" id="w">Ripley, Surrey</a> from about 1919 until 1939.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> The Bentley house was a gift of her father.<sup id="_ref-wade_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wade" title="">[29]</a></sup> Directly after he had married, Baden-Powell had begun to have problems with his health, suffering bouts of illness.

The Paxtu cottage is integrated into the Outspan Hotel buildings and serves as a small Scouting museum.</p>
<p>Jeal argues that Baden-Powell&#39;s distrust of <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">communism</a> led to his implicit support, through naïveté, of <a href="/wiki/Fascism" id="w">fascism</a>. In 1939 Baden-Powell noted in his diary: &#34;Lay up all day. Read <i><a href="/wiki/Mein_Kampf" id="w">Mein Kampf</a></i>. A wonderful book, with good ideas on education, health, propaganda, organization etc.—and ideals which <a href="/wiki/Hitler" id="w">Hitler</a> does not practice himself.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Jeal, p.550_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jeal, p.550" title="">[30]</a></sup> He also admired <a href="/wiki/Mussolini" id="w">Mussolini</a>, and some early Scouting badges had a <a href="/wiki/Swastika" id="w">swastika</a> symbol on them.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> According to his biographer Rosenthal, Baden-Powell used the swastika because he was a Nazi sympathizer. Jeal, however, argues that Baden-Powell was naïve of the symbol&#39;s growing association with fascism and maintained that his use of the symbol related to its earlier, original meaning of &#34;good luck&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Sanskrit" id="w">Sanskrit</a>, for which purpose the symbol had been used for centuries prior to the rise of fascism. Despite these early sympathies, Baden-Powell was a target of the Nazi regime in <a href="/wiki/The_Black_Book" id="w">the Black Book</a>, which listed individuals which were to be arrested during and after an invasion of Great Britain as part of <a href="/wiki/Operation_Sealion" id="w">Operation Sealion</a>.

Baden-Powell made paintings and drawings, almost every day of his life. Most have a humorous or informative character.<sup id="_ref-jeal_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeal" title="">[1]</a></sup>  He published books and other texts during his years of military service to both finance his life and to educate his men.<sup id="_ref-jeal_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeal" title="">[1]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Baden-Powell was regarded an excellent storyteller. During his whole life he told &#39;ripping yarns&#39; to audiences.<sup id="_ref-jeal_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeal" title="">[1]</a></sup>  After having published <i>Scouting for Boys</i>, Baden-Powell kept on writing more handbooks and educative materials for all Scouts, as well as directives for Scout Leaders. In his later years, he also wrote about the Scout Movement and his ideas for its future.  He spent the last decade of his life in Africa, and many of this later books had African themes.</p>
<a id="Sexuality" name="Sexuality"></a><h2>Sexuality</h2>
<p>{{details}}
Robert Baden-Powell&#39;s sexuality has been brought into question by his principal modern biographers,<sup id="_ref-jeal_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeal" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-rosenthal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rosenthal" title="">[37]</a></sup> who have found a great deal of evidence indicating he was attracted to youthful men and to boys. Nonetheless, Baden-Powell is thought to always have remained chaste with his scouts, and he did not tolerate Scoutmasters who indulged in sexual &#39;escapades&#39; with their charges.<sup id="_ref-jeal_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeal" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
