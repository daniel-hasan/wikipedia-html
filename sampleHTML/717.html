<p>Alberta is located in <a href="/wiki/Western_Canada" id="w">Western Canada</a>, bounded by the provinces of <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a> to the west and <a href="/wiki/Saskatchewan" id="w">Saskatchewan</a> to the east, <a href="/wiki/Northwest_Territories" id="w">Northwest Territories</a> to the north, and by the <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">U.S. state</a> of <a href="/wiki/Montana" id="w">Montana</a> to the south. Alberta is one of two provinces (the other being <a href="/wiki/New_Brunswick" id="w">New Brunswick</a>) to border only a single U.S. state.  It is also one of two provinces that are land-locked (the other being Saskatchewan).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Capital_city" id="w">capital city</a> of Alberta is <a href="/wiki/Edmonton%2C_Alberta" id="w">Edmonton</a>, located just south of the centre of the province. <a href="/wiki/Calgary" id="w">Calgary</a> is a major distribution and transportation hub as well as being one of Canada&#39;s major commerce centres. Edmonton is the primary supply and service hub for Canada&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Athabasca_Oil_Sands" id="w">oil sands</a> and other northern resource industries. According to recent population estimates, these two metropolitan areas have now both exceeded 1 million people, Calgary being slightly more populous than Edmonton.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Other <a href="/wiki/List_of_communities_in_Alberta" id="w">municipalities in the province</a> include <a href="/wiki/Red_Deer%2C_Alberta" id="w">Red Deer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lethbridge" id="w">Lethbridge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Medicine_Hat%2C_Alberta" id="w">Medicine Hat</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fort_McMurray%2C_Alberta" id="w">Fort McMurray</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grande_Prairie%2C_Alberta" id="w">Grande Prairie</a>, <a href="/wiki/Camrose%2C_Alberta" id="w">Camrose</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lloydminster" id="w">Lloydminster</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wetaskiwin%2C_Alberta" id="w">Wetaskiwin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Banff%2C_Alberta" id="w">Banff</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jasper%2C_Alberta" id="w">Jasper</a>. </p>

<a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2>Geography</h2>
<p>{{main}}
Alberta is in <a href="/wiki/Western_Canada" id="w">western Canada</a>, and covers an area of 661,190&#160;km² (255,287 mi²).<sup id="_ref-area_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-area" title="">[2]</a></sup> To the south, it borders the U.S. state of Montana on the <a href="/wiki/49th_parallel_north" id="w">49&#60;sup&#62;th&#60;/sup&#62; Parallel</a>. To the east at a longitude of 110°W, it borders the province of Saskatchewan. At 60°N, it is bordered by the Northwest Territories. To the west, its border with <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a> follows the line of peaks of the <a href="/wiki/Rocky_Mountains" id="w">Rocky Mountains</a> range along the <a href="/wiki/Continental_Divide" id="w">Continental Divide</a>, which runs northwesterly until it reaches 120° W, at which point the border follows this meridian to 60°N.</p>
<p>With the exception of the southeastern section, the province is well watered. Alberta contains dozens of rivers and lakes used for <a href="/wiki/Swimming" id="w">swimming</a>, <a href="/wiki/Water_skiing" id="w">water skiing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fishing" id="w">fishing</a> and a full range of other <a href="/wiki/Water_sports" id="w">water sports</a>. There are three large lakes and a multitude of smaller lakes less than 260&#160;km² each. Part of <a href="/wiki/Lake_Athabasca" id="w">Lake Athabasca</a> ({{nts}}&#160;km²) lies in the province of Saskatchewan. <a href="/wiki/Lake_Claire_(Albertan_lake)" id="w">Lake Claire</a> ({{nts}}&#160;km²) lies just west of Lake Athabasca in <a href="/wiki/Wood_Buffalo_National_Park" id="w">Wood Buffalo National Park</a>. <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Slave_Lake" id="w">Lesser Slave Lake</a> ({{nts}}&#160;km²) is northwest of <a href="/wiki/Edmonton" id="w">Edmonton</a>.</p>

Because Alberta extends for {{nts}}&#160;km from north to south, and about 600&#160;km wide at its greatest east-west extent, it is natural that the climate should vary considerably between the 49<sup>th</sup> and 60<sup>th</sup> parallels. It is also further influenced by its elevation since the province is a high plateau. The elevation ranges from about {{nts}} metres in the south (Calgary is about {{nts}}–{{nts}} metres and Red Deer is about 850 m) to 650 metres in the north. The presence of a wall of mountains on the west and open prairies on the east also influences the weather.</p>
<p>Northern Alberta is mostly covered by <a href="/wiki/Taiga" id="w">boreal forest</a> and has fewer frost-free days than southern Alberta, which has a semi-arid climate. The southeastern corner of Alberta experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains, and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter <a href="/wiki/Chinook_wind" id="w">chinook winds</a>, while southeastern Alberta is a generally flat, dry prairie with some hills, where temperatures are most extreme. They can range from very cold (−35 °C (−31 °F) or lower in the winter) to very hot (38 °C (100 °F) or higher in the summer). Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely <a href="/wiki/Aspen_parkland" id="w">aspen parkland</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Biome" id="w">biome</a> transitional between <a href="/wiki/Prairie" id="w">prairie</a> to the south and boreal forest to the north. After southern <a href="/wiki/Ontario" id="w">Ontario</a>, Central Alberta is the most likely region in Canada to experience <a href="/wiki/Tornadoes" id="w">tornadoes</a>. <a href="/wiki/Thunderstorm" id="w">Thunderstorms</a>, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the <a href="/wiki/Calgary-Edmonton_Corridor" id="w">Calgary-Edmonton Corridor</a> is notable for having the highest frequency of <a href="/wiki/Hail" id="w">hail</a> in Canada, due to the role of orographic lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains which enhances the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.</p>
<p>Overall, Alberta has cold winters, with a temperature average ranging from −10 °C (14 °F) in the south to −24 °C (−12 °F) in the north. In the south along the foothills of the Rockies, the winter cold is sometimes interrupted by <a href="/wiki/Chinook_winds" id="w">Chinook winds</a> which can propel temperatures upward in a short time frame close to or infrequently above 20 °C (68 °F). These conditions most commonly occur in February or March. In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around 21 °C (70 °F) in the Rocky Mountains (valleys) and far north to near 30 °C (86 °F) in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting over periods of years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation. Alberta experiences a good amount of sunshine for its northern location owing to its fairly dry climate; the east-central part of the province (bordering Saskatchewan), is the sunniest place in Canada with an average of over {{nts}} hours a year.</p>

<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Alberta&#39;s economy is one of the strongest in Canada, supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent, agriculture and technology. The per capita GDP in 2006 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at <a href="/wiki/Canadian_dollar" id="w">C$69</a>,789. This was 56% higher than the national average and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces. This deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Measured from north to south, the region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta&#39;s population).<sup id="_ref-CECorridor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CECorridor" title="">[5]</a></sup> It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by <a href="/wiki/TD_Bank_Financial_Group" id="w">TD Bank Financial Group</a> found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor is 10 percent above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40 percent above other Canadian cities.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Fraser_Institute" id="w">Fraser Institute</a>, Alberta also has very high levels of <a href="/wiki/Economic_freedom" id="w">economic freedom</a>. It is by far the most free economy in Canada,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> and is rated as the 4th most free economy of U.S. States and Canadian Provinces.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Athabasca_Oil_Sands" id="w">Athabasca Oil Sands</a> (sometimes known as the Athabasca <a href="/wiki/Tar_sands" id="w">Tar sands</a>) have estimated <a href="/wiki/Non-conventional_oil" id="w">non-conventional oil</a> reserves approximately equal to the <a href="/wiki/Conventional_oil" id="w">conventional oil</a> reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6 trillion barrels (254&#160;km³). With the development of new extraction methods such as <a href="/wiki/Steam_assisted_gravity_drainage" id="w">steam assisted gravity drainage</a> (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional <a href="/wiki/Surface_mining" id="w">strip mining</a> and non-conventional <a href="/wiki/In_situ" id="w">in situ</a> methods to extract the <a href="/wiki/Bitumen" id="w">bitumen</a> from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about 315 billion barrels (50&#160;km³) of bitumen are recoverable. <a href="/wiki/Fort_McMurray" id="w">Fort McMurray</a>, one of Canada&#39;s fastest growing  cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production.

<p>Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the Tar Sands is the price of oil. The <a href="/wiki/Oil_price_increases_of_2004-2006" id="w">oil price increases of 2004-2006</a> have made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.</p>

<p>As Canada&#39;s head of state, Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor, Norman Kwong.  Although the Lieutenant Governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, (s)he is in reality a <a href="/wiki/Figurehead" id="w">figurehead</a> whose actions are restricted by custom and <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)" id="w">constitutional convention</a>.  The government is therefore headed by the <a href="/wiki/Premier_of_Alberta" id="w">Premier</a>. The current Premier is Ed Stelmach who was elected as leader of the governing Progressive Conservatives on <a href="/wiki/December_2" id="w">December 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>.  Stelmach was sworn in as the 13th <a href="/wiki/Albertan_Premier" id="w">Albertan Premier</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_15" id="w">December 15</a>, 2006. <div style="wigth:200px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:200px-Edmonton_leg.jpg" title="Alberta&#39;s Legislative Building in Edmonton."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200px-Edmonton_leg.jpg" alt="Alberta&#39;s Legislative Building in Edmonton." title="Alberta&#39;s Legislative Building in Edmonton." class="location-right type-thumb" width="200px" />

<div class="thumbcaption">Alberta&#39;s Legislative Building in Edmonton.</div></div>
</p>
<p>As is always the case in a parliamentary system of government, the Premier is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and he draws all the members of his Cabinet from among the Members of the Legislative Assembly.</p>
<p>The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government &#8212; the capital of Alberta.</p>
<p>The province&#39;s revenue comes mainly from the taxation of oil, natural gas, beef, softwood lumber, and wheat, but also includes a tax on corporate and personal income, gaming revenue, and grants from the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Canada" id="w">federal government</a> primarily for <a href="/wiki/Infrastructure" id="w">infrastructure</a> projects. Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial <a href="/wiki/Sales_tax" id="w">sales tax</a> (though residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the <a href="/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(Canada)" id="w">Goods and Services Tax</a>). Alberta&#39;s municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments which (usually) work in co-operation with the provincial government.</p>
<p>Alberta&#39;s elections tend to yield results which are much more conservative than those of other Canadian provinces. Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (&#34;Conservatives&#34; or &#34;Tories&#34;), the <a href="/wiki/Alberta_Liberal_Party" id="w">Liberals</a>, and the social democratic <a href="/wiki/Alberta_New_Democratic_Party" id="w">New Democrats</a>. A fourth party, the strongly conservative <a href="/wiki/Social_Credit_Party_of_Alberta" id="w">Social Credit Party</a>, was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. Since that time, no other political party has governed Alberta. In fact, only four parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the <a href="/wiki/United_Farmers_of_Alberta" id="w">United Farmers of Alberta</a>, from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, and the currently governing Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to the present.</p>
<p>As is the case with many western Canadian provinces, Alberta has had occasional surges in separatist sentiment. Even during the 1980s, when these feelings were at their strongest, there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referendums. There are a number of groups wishing to promote the independence of Alberta in some form currently active in the province. See also: <a href="/wiki/Alberta_separatism" id="w">Alberta separatism</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Alberta_general_election%2C_2004" id="w">2004 provincial election</a>, held in November, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government (62 Members), the Liberal Party of Alberta was elected as the Official Opposition (16 Members), the New Democratic Party elected four Members, and the <a href="/wiki/Alberta_Alliance_Party" id="w">Alberta Alliance Party</a>, running to the <a href="/wiki/Right-wing_politics" id="w">right</a> of the Conservatives, won one seat.</p>

<a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2>Education</h2>
<p>{{main}}
As with any Canadian province, the Albertan Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling).</p>
<dl><dt>K-12</dt></dl>
<p>There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic</a> electorate, and one (<a href="/wiki/St._Albert%2C_Alberta" id="w">St. Albert</a>) has a <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" id="w">Protestant</a> electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.</p>
<p>For many years the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Alberta" id="w">provincial government</a> has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K - 12 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property, as supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K - 12 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K - 12 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Public_school" id="w">Public</a> and separate school boards, <a href="/wiki/Charter_school" id="w">charter schools</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Private_school" id="w">private schools</a> all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). Home schoolers may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies.  Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education.</p>
<dl><dt>Post-secondary</dt></dl>
<p>Alberta&#39;s oldest and largest university is Edmonton&#39;s <a href="/wiki/University_of_Alberta" id="w">University of Alberta</a>. The <a href="/wiki/University_of_Calgary" id="w">University of Calgary</a>, once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966, and is now the second largest university in Alberta.

Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers).

<a id="Infrastructure" name="Infrastructure"></a><h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Alberta has over 180,000&#160;km of <a href="/wiki/Highway" id="w">highways</a> and roads, of which nearly 50,000&#160;km are paved. The main north-south <a href="/wiki/Corridor" id="w">corridor</a> is <a href="/wiki/Alberta_Highway_2" id="w">Highway 2</a>, which begins south of <a href="/wiki/Cardston%2C_Alberta" id="w">Cardston</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Carway%2C_Alberta" id="w">Carway</a> <a href="/wiki/Border" id="w">border</a> crossing and is part of the <a href="/wiki/CANAMEX_Corridor" id="w">CANAMEX Corridor</a>. <a href="/wiki/Alberta_Highway_4" id="w">Highway 4</a>, which effectively extends <a href="/wiki/Interstate_15" id="w">U.S. Interstate Highway 15</a> into Alberta and is the busiest U.S. gateway to the province, begins at the <a href="/wiki/Coutts%2C_Alberta" id="w">Coutts</a> border crossing and ends at Lethbridge. <a href="/wiki/Alberta_Highway_3" id="w">Highway 3</a> joins Lethbridge to <a href="/wiki/Fort_Macleod%2C_Alberta" id="w">Fort Macleod</a> and links Highway 4 to Highway 2. Highway 2 travels northward through Fort Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton before dividing into two highways. The section of Highway 2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the <a href="/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II_Highway" id="w">Queen Elizabeth II Highway</a> to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005. Past Edmonton, one branch continues northwest as <a href="/wiki/Alberta_Highway_43" id="w">Highway 43</a> into Grande Prairie and the <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_Country" id="w">Peace River Country</a>; the other (<a href="/wiki/Alberta_Highway_63" id="w">Highway 63</a>) travels northeast to Fort McMurray, the location of the <a href="/wiki/Athabasca_Tar_Sands" id="w">Athabasca Oil Sands</a>. Highway 2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: <a href="/wiki/Alberta_Highway_22" id="w">Highway 22</a>, west of highway 2, known as &#34;the cowboy trail,&#34; and <a href="/wiki/Alberta_Highway_21" id="w">Highway 21</a>, east of highway 2.</p>
<p>Alberta has two main east-west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the <a href="/wiki/Trans-Canada_Highway" id="w">Trans-Canada Highway</a> system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through <a href="/wiki/Banff_National_Park" id="w">Banff National Park</a>. The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network but known alternatively as the <a href="/wiki/Yellowhead_Highway" id="w">Yellowhead Highway</a> (<a href="/wiki/Alberta_Highway_16" id="w">Highway 16</a>), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and <a href="/wiki/Jasper_National_Park" id="w">Jasper National Park</a> into <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a>. On a sunny spring or fall day, one of the most scenic drives is along the <a href="/wiki/Icefields_Parkway" id="w">Icefields Parkway</a>, which runs for 228&#160;km between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length.</p>
<p>Another major corridor through central Alberta is <a href="/wiki/Alberta_Highway_11" id="w">Highway 11</a> (also known as the <a href="/wiki/David_Thompson" id="w">David Thompson</a> Highway), which runs west from the <a href="/wiki/Saskatchewan_River_Crossing%2C_Alberta" id="w">Saskatchewan River Crossing</a> in Banff National Park through <a href="/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_House" id="w">Rocky Mountain House</a> and <a href="/wiki/Red_Deer" id="w">Red Deer</a>, connecting with <a href="/wiki/Alberta_Highway_12" id="w">Highway 12</a> 20 km west of <a href="/wiki/Stettler" id="w">Stettler</a>.  The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway 2 just west of Red Deer.</p>
<p>Urban stretches of Alberta&#39;s major highways and <a href="/wiki/Freeway" id="w">freeways</a> are often called <i>trails</i>. For example, Highway 2 is <a href="/wiki/Deerfoot_Trail" id="w">Deerfoot Trail</a> as it passes through Calgary, Calgary Trail as it leaves Edmonton southbound, and St. Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton northbound toward the city of St. Albert. Visitors from outside Alberta often find this disconcerting, accustomed as they are to the notion that a trail is an unpaved route primarily for <a href="/wiki/Pedestrian" id="w">pedestrians</a>.

Alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, due in large part to its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province saw high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a>), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup>  As of late 2005, the population of the province was 3,306,359 (<i>Albertans</i>). 81% of this population lives in urban areas and 19% is rural. The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and one of the densest in Canada.<sup id="_ref-muntypes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-muntypes" title="">[19]</a></sup> Many of Alberta&#39;s cities and towns have also experienced very high rates of growth in recent history. Over the past century, Alberta&#39;s population rose from 73,022 in 1901 to 3,375,763 in 2006.<sup id="_ref-statcan2001_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-statcan2001" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>Most Albertans identify as <a href="/wiki/Christian" id="w">Christians</a>. Alberta has a somewhat higher percentage of <a href="/wiki/Evangelicalism" id="w">evangelical</a> Christians than do other provinces.

The  province of Alberta, as far north as about 53° north latitude, was a part of <a href="/wiki/Rupert%26%2339%3Bs_Land" id="w">Rupert&#39;s Land</a> from the time of the incorporation of the <a href="/wiki/Hudson%26%2339%3Bs_Bay_Company" id="w">Hudson&#39;s Bay Company</a> (<a href="/wiki/1670" id="w">1670</a>). After the arrival in the North-West of the French around 1731 they settled the prairies of the west, establishing communities such as <a href="/wiki/Lac_La_Biche%2C_Alberta" id="w">Lac La Biche</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bonnyville%2C_Alberta" id="w">Bonnyville</a>. Fort La Jonquière was established near what is now Calgary in (1752). The <a href="/wiki/North-West_Company" id="w">North-West Company</a> of Montreal occupied the northern part of Alberta territory before the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company arrived from Hudson Bay to take possession of it. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pond" id="w">Peter Pond</a>, who, on behalf of the North-West Company of Montreal, built <a href="/wiki/Fort_Athabasca" id="w">Fort Athabasca</a> on Lac La Biche in 1778. <a href="/wiki/Roderick_Mackenzie" id="w">Roderick Mackenzie</a> built <a href="/wiki/Fort_Chipewyan" id="w">Fort Chipewyan</a> on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Mackenzie_(explorer)" id="w">Alexander Mackenzie</a> followed the <a href="/wiki/North_Saskatchewan_River" id="w">North Saskatchewan River</a> to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the <a href="/wiki/Athabasca_River" id="w">Athabasca River</a>, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the <a href="/wiki/Mackenzie_River" id="w">Mackenzie River</a>—which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_(Canada)" id="w">Peace River</a> upstream, eventually reaching the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a>, and so being the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>The district of Alberta was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the district of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Cameron_Rutherford" id="w">Alexander Cameron Rutherford</a> as the first premier.</p>

<a id="Fauna" name="Fauna"></a><h3>Fauna</h3>
<p>The three climatic regions (<a href="/wiki/Alpine_climate" id="w">alpine</a>, forest, and prairie) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the bison, its grasses providing a great pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a strong comeback, and thrive on farms and in parks all over Alberta.</p>

Alberta is home to many large <a href="/wiki/Carnivore" id="w">carnivores</a>. Among them are the <a href="/wiki/Grizzly_bear" id="w">grizzly</a> and <a href="/wiki/American_Black_Bear" id="w">black bears</a>, which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the <a href="/wiki/Canidae" id="w">canine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Feline" id="w">feline</a> families include <a href="/wiki/Coyote" id="w">coyotes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wolf" id="w">wolves</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fox" id="w">fox</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lynx" id="w">lynx</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bobcat" id="w">bobcat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mountain_lion" id="w">mountain lion</a> (cougar).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Herbivorous" id="w">Herbivorous</a>, or plant-eating animals, are found throughout the province. <a href="/wiki/Moose" id="w">Moose</a> and <a href="/wiki/Deer" id="w">deer</a> (both mule and white-tail <a href="/wiki/Variety_(biology)" id="w">varieties</a>) are found in the wooded regions, and <a href="/wiki/Pronghorn" id="w">pronghorn</a> can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. <a href="/wiki/Bighorn_sheep" id="w">Bighorn sheep</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mountain_goat" id="w">mountain goats</a> live in the Rocky Mountains. <a href="/wiki/Rabbit" id="w">Rabbits</a>, <a href="/wiki/Porcupine" id="w">porcupines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Skunk" id="w">skunks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Squirrel" id="w">squirrels</a>, and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is fortunate in that it is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie <a href="/wiki/Rattlesnake" id="w">rattlesnake</a>.</p>
<p>Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting-ground of the migratory birds. Vast numbers of <a href="/wiki/Duck" id="w">ducks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Goose" id="w">geese</a>, <a href="/wiki/Swan" id="w">swans</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pelican" id="w">pelicans</a> arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. <a href="/wiki/Eagle" id="w">Eagles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hawk" id="w">hawks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Owl" id="w">owls</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Crow" id="w">crows</a> are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other <a href="/wiki/Temperate" id="w">temperate</a> regions, is home to <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" id="w">mosquitoes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fly" id="w">flies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wasp" id="w">wasps</a>, and bees. Rivers and lakes are well stocked with <a href="/wiki/Pike_(fish)" id="w">pike</a>, <a href="/wiki/Walleye" id="w">walleye</a>, <a href="/wiki/Whitefish" id="w">whitefish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rainbow_trout" id="w">rainbow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brook_trout" id="w">speckled</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Brown_trout" id="w">brown</a> <a href="/wiki/Trout" id="w">trout</a>, and even <a href="/wiki/Sturgeon" id="w">sturgeon</a>. <a href="/wiki/Turtle" id="w">Turtles</a> are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. <a href="/wiki/Frog" id="w">Frogs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Salamander" id="w">salamanders</a> are a few of the <a href="/wiki/Amphibian" id="w">amphibians</a> that make their homes in Alberta.</p>
<p>Alberta is the only province in Canada, as well as one of the few places in the world which is free of <a href="/wiki/Brown_rat" id="w">Norwegian rats</a>.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> Since the early 1950s, the government of Alberta has operated a rat-control program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reports zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats which have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions.</p>
<a id="Flora" name="Flora"></a><h3>Flora</h3>
<p>In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie crocus <a href="/wiki/Anemone" id="w">anemone</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Three_flowered_avens" id="w">three flowered avens</a>, <a href="/wiki/Golden_bean" id="w">golden bean</a>, and other early flowers. The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the <a href="/wiki/Sunflower" id="w">sunflower</a> family, until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple. The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by a short, nutritious grass, which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the <a href="/wiki/Prairie_coneflower" id="w">prairie coneflower</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fleabane" id="w">fleabane</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sagebrush" id="w">sage</a>. Both yellow and white <a href="/wiki/Sweet_clover" id="w">sweet clover</a> fill the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents. The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely <a href="/wiki/Deciduous" id="w">deciduous</a>, typically <a href="/wiki/Aspen" id="w">aspen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poplar" id="w">poplar</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Willow" id="w">willow</a>. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. <a href="/wiki/Aspen" id="w">Aspen poplar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Balsam_poplar" id="w">balsam poplar</a> (or <a href="/wiki/Cottonwood" id="w">cottonwood</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Paper_birch" id="w">paper birch</a> are the primary large deciduous species. <a href="/wiki/Conifer" id="w">Conifers</a> include <a href="/wiki/Jack_pine" id="w">Jack pine</a>, Rocky Mountain pine, <a href="/wiki/Lodgepole_pine" id="w">Lodgepole pine</a>, both white and black <a href="/wiki/Spruce" id="w">spruce</a>, and the deciduous conifer <a href="/wiki/Tamarack" id="w">tamarack</a>.</p>
