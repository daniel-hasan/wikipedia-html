The <b>Greater Yellow-headed Vulture</b>, <i>Cathartes melambrotus</i>, also known as the <b>Forest Vulture</b>, is a species of <a href="/wiki/Bird" id="w">bird</a> in the <a href="/wiki/New_World_Vulture" id="w">New World Vulture</a> family Cathartidae. It was considered to be the same species as the <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Yellow-headed_Vulture" id="w">Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture</a> until they were split in 1964. It is found in <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South America</a> in <a href="/wiki/Tropical" id="w">tropical</a> moist lowland <a href="/wiki/Forest" id="w">forests</a>. It is a large bird, with a wingspan of 166-178&#160;centimeters (65-70&#160;inches). The body <a href="/wiki/Plumage" id="w">plumage</a> is black, and the head and neck, which are featherless, range in color from deep yellow to pale orange. It lacks a <a href="/wiki/Syrinx_(biology)" id="w">syrinx</a>, and its vocalizations are therefore limited to grunts or low hisses.</p>
<p>The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture feeds on <a href="/wiki/Carrion" id="w">carrion</a> and locates carcasses by sight and by smell, an ability which is rare in <a href="/wiki/Bird" id="w">birds</a>. It is dependent on larger vultures, such as the <a href="/wiki/King_Vulture" id="w">King Vulture</a>, to open the hides of larger animal carcasses, as its bill is not strong enough to do this. Like other New World Vultures, the Greater Yellow-headed Vulture utilizes <a href="/wiki/Thermal" id="w">thermals</a> to stay aloft with minimal effort. It lays its <a href="/wiki/Egg_(biology)" id="w">eggs</a> on flat surfaces, such as the floors of caves, or in the hollows of stumps. It feeds its young by <a href="/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)" id="w">regurgitation</a>.</p>
<a id="Taxonomy" name="Taxonomy"></a><h2>Taxonomy</h2>
<p>The Greater Yellow-headed and the <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Yellow-headed_Vulture" id="w">Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture</a> were distinguished as separate species and described in 1964 by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Wetmore" id="w">Alexander Wetmore</a>; both species had earlier been known as Yellow-headed Vultures. The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature" id="w">genus</a> is <i>Cathartes</i>, which means &#34;purifier&#34;, and is <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latinized</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" id="w">Greek</a> <i>kathartēs</i>/καθαρτης.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The <a href="/wiki/Common_name" id="w">common name</a>, vulture, is derived from the <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> word <i>vulturus</i>, meaning &#34;tearer,&#34; in reference to its feeding habits.<sup id="_ref-Holloway_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Holloway" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The exact <a href="/wiki/Taxonomic" id="w">taxonomic</a> placement of the Greater Yellow-headed Vulture and the remaining six species of <a href="/wiki/New_World_Vulture" id="w">New World Vultures</a> remains unclear.<sup id="_ref-SACC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SACC" title="">[3]</a></sup> Although they are similar in appearance and have similar <a href="/wiki/Ecological_niche" id="w">ecological roles</a>, the New World and <a href="/wiki/Old_World_Vultures" id="w">Old World Vultures</a> evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to <a href="/wiki/Storks" id="w">storks</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> More recent authorities assert their overall position in the order <a href="/wiki/Falconiformes" id="w">Falconiformes</a> along with the Old World Vultures<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/South_American_Classification_Committee" id="w">South American Classification Committee</a> has removed the New World Vultures from <a href="/wiki/Ciconiiformes" id="w">Ciconiiformes</a> and instead placed them in <i><a href="/wiki/Incertae_sedis" id="w">Incertae sedis</a></i>, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.<sup id="_ref-SACC_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SACC" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Description" name="Description"></a><h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture is 64-75&#160;centimeters (25-30&#160;inches) in length, with a wingspan of 166-178&#160;centimeters (65-70&#160;inches) and a tail length of 25-29&#160;centimeters (10-11.5&#160;inches).<sup id="_ref-Lees _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lees " title="">[7]</a></sup> Its <a href="/wiki/Plumage" id="w">plumage</a> is black with a green or purple sheen. The throat and the sides of the head are featherless. The skin on the head ranges in color from deep yellow to pale orange with a blue crown.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The nape and the area near the nostrils are pale pinkish. The undersides of the wings are black, while the <a href="/wiki/Flight_feather" id="w">flight feathers</a> are a lighter shade. The quills of the eleven <a href="/wiki/Primary_feather" id="w">primary feathers</a> appear to be white when seen from above.<sup id="_ref-Hilty_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hilty" title="">[9]</a></sup> The tail is rounded and long for a vulture, extending to or slightly beyond the tip of the closed wing. The sexes are outwardly similar.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The head is dull greyish in <a href="/wiki/Juvenile_(organism)" id="w">juveniles</a>, which otherwise resemble adults.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)" id="w">irises</a> of its eyes are red, its feet are black, and its <a href="/wiki/Beak" id="w">beak</a> is flesh-colored.<sup id="_ref-Channing_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Channing" title="">[11]</a></sup> The eye has a single incomplete row of <a href="/wiki/Eyelash" id="w">eyelashes</a> on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid.<sup id="_ref- Pterylosis _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- Pterylosis " title="">[12]</a></sup> Its beak is thick, rounded, and hooked at the tip.<sup id="_ref-Terres_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Terres" title="">[13]</a></sup> Because of its habit of <a href="/wiki/Urohidrosis" id="w">urohidrosis</a>, the scaly portions of its legs are often streaked white with <a href="/wiki/Uric_acid" id="w">uric acid</a>.
The front toes are long with small webs at their bases and are not adapted to grasping. The opening of the nostril is longitudinal and set in a soft <a href="/wiki/Cere" id="w">cere</a>, and the nostril lack a <a href="/wiki/Septum" id="w">septum</a>. Like all New World Vultures, the Greater Yellow-headed Vulture lacks a <a href="/wiki/Syrinx_(biology)" id="w">syrinx</a>, and is therefore unable to make any sound other than grunts or a low hiss.<sup id="_ref-Feduccia_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Feduccia" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>It differs in appearance from the similar Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture in several ways. It is larger than the <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Yellow-headed_Vulture" id="w">Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture</a>, with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture&#39;s browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture. Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier.<sup id="_ref-Lees _b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lees " title="">[7]</a></sup>. Unlike the other members of the genus <i><a href="/wiki/Cathartes" id="w">Cathartes</a></i>, the Greater Yellow-headed Vulture has relatively dark inner <a href="/wiki/Flight_feather#Primaries" id="w">primaries</a>, which contrast slightly with the paler <a href="/wiki/Flight_feather#Secondaries" id="w">secondaries</a> and outer primaries. The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture prefers to live in forests while the Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the Lesser Yellow-headed Vulture.<sup id="_ref- taxonomy _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- taxonomy " title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Ecology_and_behavior" name="Ecology_and_behavior"></a><h2>Ecology and behavior</h2>
<p>The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture roosts on high, exposed dead trees to observe surrounding terrain. When flying, it travels in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with its wings held flat or very slightly above horizontal, in what is called the <a href="/wiki/Dihedral" id="w">dihedral</a> position.<sup id="_ref-Hilty_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hilty" title="">[9]</a></sup> The flight of the Greater Yellow-Headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses <a href="/wiki/Thermals" id="w">thermals</a> to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings.<sup id="_ref-Terres_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Terres" title="">[13]</a></sup>
The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture also has the unusual habit of <a href="/wiki/Urohidrosis" id="w">urohidrosis</a>, in which it urinates or defecates on its  legs to cool them <a href="/wiki/Evaporative_cooling" id="w">evaporatively</a>. This behavior is exhibited by <a href="/wiki/Stork" id="w">storks</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_World_vulture" id="w">New World vultures</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>
</p><a id="Diet" name="Diet"></a><h3>Diet</h3>
<p>The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture is a <a href="/wiki/Scavenger" id="w">scavenger</a> and subsists entirely on <a href="/wiki/Carrion" id="w">carrion</a>.<sup id="_ref-Channing_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Channing" title="">[11]</a></sup> It will eat roadkill or other animal carcasses. It prefers fresh meat, but often cannot make the first cut into the carcass of a larger animal as its beak is not strong enough to tear into the tough hide. After a few days, the Greater Yellow-headed Vulture will no longer feed on a piece of carrion, as the meat will begin to decay and become contaminated with <a href="/wiki/Microorganism" id="w">microbial toxins</a>.<sup id="_ref-snyder_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-snyder" title="">[18]</a></sup> It will drink water from a pool, pond, or any receptacle provided.<sup id="_ref-Terres_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Terres" title="">[13]</a></sup> Like other vultures, they play an important role in the <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" id="w">ecosystem</a> by disposing off carrion which could otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.<sup id="_ref-cotton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cotton" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Greater Yellow-headed Vulture forages using its keen eyesight to locate carrion on the ground, but also uses its sense of smell, an ability which is uncommon in the avian world. It locates carrion by detecting the scent of <a href="/wiki/Ethanethiol" id="w">ethyl mercaptan</a>, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals.
The <a href="/wiki/Olfaction" id="w">olfactory lobe</a> of its <a href="/wiki/Brain" id="w">brain</a> responsible for processing smells is particularly large compared to other animals.<sup id="_ref-snyder_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-snyder" title="">[18]</a></sup> This characteristic of New World Vultures has been used by humans: ethyl mercaptan is injected into pipelines, and engineers looking for leaks then follow the vultures.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/King_Vulture" id="w">King Vultures</a>, which lack the ability to smell carrion, follow the Greater Yellow-headed Vultures to carcasses, where the King Vulture tears open the skin of the dead animal. This allows the smaller Greater Yellow-headed Vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of <a href="/wiki/Mutual_dependence" id="w">mutual dependence</a> between species.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> It is generally displaced from carcasses by both <a href="/wiki/Turkey_Vulture" id="w">Turkey Vultures</a> and <a href="/wiki/King_Vulture" id="w">King Vultures</a>, due to their larger size.<sup id="_ref-cotton_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cotton" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reproduction" name="Reproduction"></a><h3>Reproduction</h3>
<p>Greater Yellow-headed Vultures do not build <a href="/wiki/Bird_nest" id="w">nests</a>, but rather lay their <a href="/wiki/Egg_(biology)" id="w">eggs</a> directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, the ground, or in the hollows of stumps.
