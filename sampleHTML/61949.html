<p><b><i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i></b> (also known as <b><i>Oprah</i></b>) is an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> nationally <a href="/wiki/Television_syndication" id="w">syndicated</a> <a href="/wiki/Talk_show" id="w">talk show</a>, hosted and produced by its namesake <a href="/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey" id="w">Oprah Winfrey</a>, and is the highest-rated talk show in American television history.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is currently the longest-running <a href="/wiki/Daytime_television" id="w">daytime television</a> talk show in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, having run since <a href="/wiki/September_8" id="w">September 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1986" id="w">1986</a>, for over 22 seasons and 3,000 episodes (as of <a href="/wiki/September_10" id="w">September 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>). The show is renewed through 2011 but in a 2007 interview with <a href="/wiki/Larry_King" id="w">Larry King</a>, Oprah said that in 2011 she will not renew her contract, and thus end the show for good.</p>
<p><b><i>Oprah</i></b> has been included in <i><a href="/wiki/Time_(magazine)" id="w">Time</a></i> magazine&#39;s shortlist of the best television series of the twentieth century in 1998, and it made the top 50 of <i><a href="/wiki/TV_Guide" id="w">TV Guide</a><b>s countdown of the greatest shows of all time<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> in 2002. </b></i></p>
<p>The show is highly influential, especially with <a href="/wiki/Women" id="w">women</a>, and many of its topics penetrate into American pop-cultural consciousness. While early episodes of show followed a <a href="/wiki/Phil_Donahue" id="w">Phil Donahue</a>-style exploration of sensationalistic social issues, Oprah eventually transformed her series into a more positive, spiritually uplifting experience marked by <a href="/wiki/Book_discussion_club" id="w">book clubs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Celebrity" id="w">celebrity</a> interviews, self-improvement segments, and philanthropic forays into world events. </p>   
<a id="Wildest_Dreams" name="Wildest_Dreams"></a><h2>Wildest Dreams</h2>
<p>One of the show&#39;s features in recent years has been the &#34;Wildest Dreams&#34; tour, which fulfills the dreams of people reported to her by producers, found mostly from viewers who write in to the show, be the dream a new house, an encounter with a favorite performer, or a guest role on a popular TV show. </p>
<p>During her nineteenth season premiere (fall 2004), Oprah surprised her entire <a href="/wiki/Audience" id="w">audience</a> by giving them each a <a href="/wiki/Pontiac_G6" id="w">Pontiac G6</a>. It was named as one of the greatest television moments in history by <i><a href="/wiki/TV_Guide" id="w">TV Guide</a></i>. Although Oprah may be given credit for giving the cars away, they were donated to her by <a href="/wiki/Pontiac" id="w">Pontiac</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Publicity_stunt" id="w">publicity stunt</a>. In 2005, <a href="/wiki/Tina_Turner" id="w">Tina Turner</a> guest starred, allowing <i><a href="/wiki/Desperate_Housewives" id="w">Desperate Housewives</a></i> star <a href="/wiki/Felicity_Huffman" id="w">Felicity Huffman</a> to fulfill her Wildest Dream of singing backup to Turner. Another included a man named David Caruso who lost 300 pounds after weighing 525 pounds. He came on the show in 2003 and told Oprah that one of his wishes was to sit in a <a href="/wiki/Porsche" id="w">Porsche</a>. Minutes later, a white 2004 Porsche Boxster S (worth about $63,000) was given to him. Oprah named this one of her 20 favorite moments on a special DVD set.</p>
<a id="Interviews" name="Interviews"></a><h2>Interviews</h2>
<p>Winfrey has interviewed a plethora of <a href="/wiki/Political" id="w">political</a> and public figures during the past twenty years. In the earlier seasons of the show, rather than offering a simple publicity platform, a celebrity would often feature after a period of intense media scrutiny, such was the case when the model <a href="/wiki/Naomi_Campbell" id="w">Naomi Campbell</a> appeared after there were claims she had a substance abuse problem. She often interviews celebrities on issues that directly involve them in some way, such as cancer or charity work.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Winfrey claims her worst interviewing experience was with <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Taylor" id="w">Elizabeth Taylor</a> in the fourth season. The actress refused to talk about her marriages and current relationship, leading to a number of awkward silences. Taylor later apologized and returned in a better frame of mind a year later.

Oprah&#39;s interview with <a href="/wiki/Tom_Cruise" id="w">Tom Cruise</a>, which was broadcast on <a href="/wiki/May_23" id="w">May 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, has also gained notoriety. Cruise — according to the <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">The New York Times</a></i> — &#34;jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell rapturously to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his new girlfriend.&#34; This scene quickly became part of American pop-cultural discourse and was heavily parodied in media as diverse as <i><a href="/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" id="w">Saturday Night Live</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Family_Guy" id="w">Family Guy</a></i> and the film <i><a href="/wiki/Scary_Movie_4" id="w">Scary Movie 4</a></i>.</p>
<p>Non-celebrity guests are generally individuals who have been involved in an extraordinary situation. Examples of these include an episode in the fourth season which featured <a href="/wiki/Truddi_Chase" id="w">Truddi Chase</a>, a woman with <a href="/wiki/Multiple_Personality_Disorder" id="w">Multiple Personality Disorder</a> who reported being violently and sexually abused beginning at the age of two. After introducing Chase, who was there to promote her book <i>When Rabbit Howls</i>, Oprah unexpectedly broke down in tears whilst reading the teleprompter, relating her own childhood molestation to that of the guest. Unable to control herself, Winfrey repeatedly asked producers to stop filming. Other non-celebrity appearances include guests who are chosen for being particularly un-fashionable and are given a fashion makeover by renowned style advisors <a href="/wiki/Trinny_Woodall" id="w">Trinny Woodall</a> and <a href="/wiki/Susannah_Constantine" id="w">Susannah Constantine</a>.</p><blockquote>
