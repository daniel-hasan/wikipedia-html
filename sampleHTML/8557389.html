Numerous <b><a href="/wiki/Georgia_Tech" id="w">Georgia Tech</a> legends and traditions</b> have been established since the school&#39;s opening in 1888,<sup id="_ref-Hopkins_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hopkins" title="">[1]</a></sup> some of which have persisted for decades. Over time, the school has grown from a <a href="/wiki/Trade_school" id="w">trade school</a> into a large <a href="/wiki/Research_university" id="w">research university</a>, and the traditions reflect that heritage. One of the cherished holdovers from Tech&#39;s early years, a <a href="/wiki/Steam_whistle" id="w">steam whistle</a> blows five minutes before the hour, every hour from 7:55 a.m. to 5:55 p.m. It is for that reason that the faculty newspaper is named <i>The Whistle</i>.</p>
<p>Some of the traditions are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the &#39;T&#39; from Tech Tower. <a href="/wiki/Tech_Tower" id="w">Tech Tower</a>, Tech&#39;s historic primary administrative building, has the letters TECH hanging atop it on each of its four sides. A number of times, students have orchestrated complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion have carried this act out successfully. One especially well-known tradition that has existed nearly since the school&#39;s establishment is <a href="/wiki/Clean%2C_Old-Fashioned_Hate" id="w">Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate</a>, Georgia Tech&#39;s heated, long and ongoing rivalry with the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Georgia" id="w">University of Georgia</a>. The first known hostilities between the two schools trace back to <a href="/wiki/1891" id="w">1891</a>.</p>
<p>Several legends originated at Georgia Tech. <a href="/wiki/George_P._Burdell" id="w">George P. Burdell</a>, Tech&#39;s ever-present fictional student, was created in 1927 when a student filled out two application forms. Burdell went on to lead a long life; he earned several degrees, fought World War II, and almost won <i>Time</i>{{&#39;}}s 2001 <a href="/wiki/Person_of_the_Year" id="w">Person of the Year</a> award. Georgia Tech is also known for the largest margin of victory in a football game, achieved in their 222-0 thrashing of <a href="/wiki/Cumberland_University" id="w">Cumberland University</a> in the <a href="/wiki/1916_Cumberland_vs._Georgia_Tech_football_game" id="w">1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game</a>.</p>

Tech&#39;s historic and primary administrative building, <a href="/wiki/Tech_Tower" id="w">Tech Tower</a>, has the letters TECH hanging atop it on each of its four sides. Since 1969, students  on several occasions have orchestrated complex plans to scale Tech Tower and steal the huge symbolic letter T off the building. The &#39;T&#39; was first stolen in April of <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a> by a secret group of Georgia Tech students calling themselves the &#34;Magnificent Seven.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Dismantling_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dismantling" title="">[2]</a></sup> The students, who were inspired by a similar prank that had taken place in <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a> at <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" id="w">Harvard University</a>, planned the theft as a means of commemorating Institute President <a href="/wiki/Edwin_D._Harrison" id="w">Edwin D. Harrison</a>&#39;s retirement. The &#39;T&#39; was returned several days later via helicopter at the behest of Atlanta mayor <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Allen_Jr." id="w">Ivan Allen</a>.<sup id="_ref-PresidentialOpinions_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PresidentialOpinions" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Following successful thefts, the T would then returned at the halftime of the homecoming football game or would be returned to the lawn of the President&#39;s mansion, and the student&#39;s achievement would be celebrated. Tradition dictates that the first T to be stolen should be the one facing east, as this can most easily be seen from the I-75/I-85 <a href="/wiki/Downtown_Connector" id="w">Downtown Connector</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Although the administration used to <a href="/wiki/Turn_a_blind_eye" id="w">turn a blind eye</a> to this practice,<sup id="_ref-PresidentialOpinions_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PresidentialOpinions" title="">[3]</a></sup> it is now officially discouraged, due to the risk of fatal falls and the potential for damage to the building, and equated to criminal activity (trespassing and theft). In recent years, this has become a serious offense, and perpetrators today would face a hefty fine to repair damages done to the building and a minimum of a semester-long suspension for attempting the feat, if not outright expulsion.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-TBookT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TBookT" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Security features such as security cameras, pressure sensitive roof tiling, and fiber optic cabling running throughout the letters have been added to the T to help prevent its theft and aid in catching the perpetrators.<sup id="_ref-TBookT_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TBookT" title="">[6]</a></sup> The last successful stealing of the T occurred in 1999 and to this day, the location of that T is unknown.

The term <i>Ramblin&#39; Wreck from Georgia Tech</i> refers to either current students or alumni, the school mascot, or the various sports teams.  Georgia Tech alumni, working on the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Canal" id="w">Panama Canal</a>, were called Ramblin&#39; Wrecks for the ingenuitive machines that they devised to transport themselves in and out of the jungles of <a href="/wiki/Panama" id="w">Panama</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  These devices and their creators were nicknamed Ramblin&#39; Wrecks from Georgia Tech.  Since then the term Ramblin&#39; Wreck has been applied to a graduate or current student of Georgia Tech.  The physical <a href="/wiki/Ramblin%26%2339%3B_Wreck" id="w">Ramblin&#39; Wreck</a> is a 1930 <a href="/wiki/Ford_Model_A_(1927)" id="w">Ford Model A</a> owned by the student body, which has been present on campus since 1961.<sup id="_ref-season_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-season" title="">[10]</a></sup> The first Ramblin&#39; Wreck mascot reference was in 1926 to Dean Floyd Field&#39;s 1914 <a href="/wiki/Ford_Model_T" id="w">Ford Model T</a>.  Sports teams of Georgia Tech are also called the Ramblin&#39; Wreck.
The fight song for Georgia Tech <i><a href="/wiki/Ramblin%26%2339%3B_Wreck_from_Georgia_Tech" id="w">I&#39;m a Rambling Wreck</a></i> begins with the lyrics, &#34;I&#39;m a Ramblin&#39; Wreck from Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer.&#34;<sup id="_ref-RamblinGT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RamblinGT" title="">[11]</a></sup> The song is sung at sporting events,<sup id="_ref-songs_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-songs" title="">[12]</a></sup> official school functions, and always at the end of every graduation ceremony.</p>

<p>Although not as popular as &#34;stealing the T,&#34; the whistle has been stolen several times.  The first ever Tech whistle installed in the late 1890&#39;s was stolen in 1905.<sup id="_ref-whistlesteal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-whistlesteal" title="">[17]</a></sup>  The whistle was returned to <a href="/wiki/George_C._Griffin" id="w">Dean Griffin</a> in 1949 as a retirement gift.<sup id="_ref-whistlesteal_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-whistlesteal" title="">[17]</a></sup>  The second theft of the whistle occurred in 1963, when a group of students nicknamed the &#34;Magnificient 7&#34; stole the whistle.  Fearing Institute repurcussions, the group returned the whistle in the Spring of 1964.<sup id="_ref-whistlesteal_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-whistlesteal" title="">[17]</a></sup>  The whistle was again stolen in 1978 by a group nicknamed the &#34;Committee of Five&#34; but this group never returned their coveted prize.  The whistle was also stolen in 1969 and 1997.  Both times the whistle was returned almost immediately after its theft.  In 1969, the whistle was given to the student body president as a graduation gift a month after its theft and the 1997 theft was solved when <a href="/wiki/G._Wayne_Clough" id="w">President Clough</a> found the whistle on his lawn a day after its theft.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

Every year, a number of freshmen, most notably those in the <a href="/wiki/Marching_band" id="w">marching band</a>,<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> wear gold caps known as RAT caps at each football game.

<p>The tradition began in 1915,<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> and freshmen were required to wear the RAT caps everyday until the Thanksgiving Day game with UGA (if Georgia Tech won) or until end of the school year (if Georgia Tech lost).<sup id="_ref-season_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-season" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Freshmen were allowed to stop wearing their caps if the football team won the homecoming game. If the team loses, the previously stated rules apply. Freshmen caught not wearing the cap faced varying degrees of <a href="/wiki/Hazing" id="w">hazing</a>,<sup id="_ref-season_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-season" title="">[10]</a></sup> including having their hair shaved into the shape of a letter tee (&#34;T&#34;).

Junior&#39;s Grill is a restaurant located in East Campus next to <a href="/wiki/Tech_Tower" id="w">Tech Tower</a>. The restaurant was first opened in 1948 under the name Pilgrim&#39;s and was originally located on the corner of <a href="/wiki/North_Avenue_(Atlanta)" id="w">North Avenue</a> and Techwood Drive.  Its name changed to Junior&#39;s Grill in 1958, and it has moved locations twice since then.  Junior&#39;s Grill moved to its current location in the Bradley Building in 1994 when it was forced out of its old location by the need to construct apartments for the <a href="/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1996 Summer Olympics</a>.<sup id="_ref-The Junior's Tradition_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Junior's Tradition" title="">[31]</a></sup> It is currently owned and run by Tommy Klemis.<sup id="_ref-jun_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jun" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The restaurant is similar in nature to <a href="/wiki/The_Varsity" id="w">The Varsity</a> but is perhaps more cherished by Tech students due to its higher quality food, its renowned chicken finger baskets, its superlatively friendly staff, its convenient on-campus location, and its fame as a Tech tradition.<sup id="_ref-jun_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jun" title="">[32]</a></sup> Historically however, the staff was not always considered so friendly. During the late 1960s, the proprietor, known to students then only as &#34;Junior,&#34; would routinely exhort his customers to &#34;Eat it and beat it&#34; due to the old facility&#39;s severely limited seating. The current restaurant also houses pieces of Tech history including aerial photographs of campus from various years, assorted Georgia Tech memorabilia, portraits of prominent individuals in Tech&#39;s history, and a section of the goalpost from Tech&#39;s <a href="/wiki/NCAA_Division_I-A_national_football_championship" id="w">1990 National Championship</a> game in the <a href="/wiki/Citrus_Bowl" id="w">Citrus Bowl</a>.<sup id="_ref-The Junior's Tradition_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Junior's Tradition" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

The Mini 500 is a <a href="/wiki/Tricycle" id="w">tricycle</a> race held during homecoming every year that requires teams to complete laps around Peters Parking Deck on East Campus.<sup id="_ref-tric_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tric" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Men must complete 15 laps while women must complete 10.

<p>The race traces its roots back to the early 1960s when fraternity pledges were forced to ride tricycles around campus as a form of hazing.<sup id="_ref-hc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hc" title="">[40]</a></sup> The race was eventually formalized in 1969 and rules were instituted to make the Mini 500 an instant classic.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-blueprint70_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blueprint70" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Wreck_Parade" name="Wreck_Parade"></a><h4>Wreck Parade</h4>
<p>The Ramblin&#39; Wreck Parade is a parade of classic cars and engineering oddities held before every homecoming football game. There are three classes of vehicles, which participate in the competition. The first class is known simply as classic cars and these are vehicles over a certain age limit (currently 25 years). The second class is known as fixed bodies and these vehicles are normal cars, which have only been cosmetically modified retaining their original <a href="/wiki/Drive_train" id="w">drive train</a>. These are often themed, but are distinctly different from <a href="/wiki/Float_(parade)" id="w">floats</a> and are prohibited from being &#34;pseudo-wrecks displaying pomps&#34;.

<a id="Freshman_Cake_Race" name="Freshman_Cake_Race"></a><h4>Freshman Cake Race</h4>
<p>The Freshman Cake Race is a foot race from the <a href="/wiki/Russ_Chandler_Stadium" id="w">Russ Chandler Stadium</a> to <a href="/wiki/Bobby_Dodd_Stadium" id="w">Bobby Dodd Stadium</a> that takes place before sunrise (about 6:00 am) on the morning of the homecoming game. This distance is about a one-half mile, so the crowd of several hundred participants engages in a mad sprint over the relatively short distance. The race runs through the middle of the campus&#39;s Greek sector and is often subject to tampering by fraternity students. The competitors are supposed to be freshmen (students with less than 30 hours of credit), and the race is split up by gender. The winners receive cakes baked by faculty, alumni, or students, and all participants receive cupcakes. The winners also receive a kiss from Mr. or Ms. Georgia Tech at the homecoming half-time show.</p>
<p>The race began as a cross-country race in 1911. In 1913, the winners received cakes from wives, mothers, and other women affiliated with Tech. The race was initially mandatory for all students.<sup id="_ref-hc_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hc" title="">[40]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-cake race_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cake race" title="">[44]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-timeline1910s_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timeline1910s" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>

The Yellow Jacket Club were the strict student enforcement of the freshmen RAT rules as well.  The Yellow Jacket Club maintained prestige and political power on campus until late 1944.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup>  The Yellow Jacket Club was in charge of the 1945 school-wide Spring Social and failed to properly organize the event.<sup id="_ref-downapeg_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-downapeg" title="">[48]</a></sup> The Technique, Blueprint, and Omicron Delta Kappa rejuvenated the major event but the Yellow Jackets&#39; reputation was severely tarnished.<sup id="_ref-downapeg_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-downapeg" title="">[48]</a></sup>  On May 8th, 1945 the Yellow Jacket Club staged a last ditch effort to reorganize the traditions club but by July 14th, 1945 the club was disbanded.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dead_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dead" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>When new freshmen arrived on campus in 1945, the student body was concerned that traditions would be lost with the disbandment of the Yellow Jackets.<sup id="_ref-dead_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dead" title="">[50]</a></sup> A new traditions club was actively pursued by Anak to instill the rich Tech tradition into new freshmen.<sup id="_ref-dead_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dead" title="">[50]</a></sup>  The new club was the Ramblin&#39; Reck Club and it was established in late July of 1945.<sup id="_ref-newrecks_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newrecks" title="">[51]</a></sup> The first order of business for the new Ramblin&#39; Reck Club was to stage a Pep Meeting and traditions review for new freshmen.<sup id="_ref-newrecks_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newrecks" title="">[51]</a></sup>  Reck Club was designed to prevent political domination by individual social fraternities as Yellow Jacket Club had been.  Membership in Reck Club was limited to two individuals per fraternity or military ROTC program.<sup id="_ref-newrecks_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newrecks" title="">[51]</a></sup>  A group known as the T-Club was charged with upholding the RAT rules with incoming freshmen.<sup id="_ref-newrecks_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newrecks" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>Four years after Tech became coed, Reck Club became the first non-<a href="/wiki/Faith_based" id="w">faith based</a> organization on campus to admit a female member.<sup id="_ref-reck club_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reck club" title="">[52]</a></sup>  Paula Stevenson was the club&#39;s first female member in 1956.<sup id="_ref-reck club_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reck club" title="">[52]</a></sup>  Under Reck Club, the strict RAT rules slowly faded away.

<p>Reck Club was given charge of the Ramblin&#39; Wreck in 1967 following the disbandment of the Student Council&#39;s Reck Committee.  A member from Reck Club known as the Wreck Driver has been elected annually since 1967 to drive the Wreck onto Grant Field for football games and other school functions.</p>
<p>Reck Club was the first group to make attempts at humanoid mascots on Tech Campus.  The first was a <a href="/wiki/Bee" id="w">bee</a> costume donned by Judi McNair of Reck Club.<sup id="_ref-judi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-judi" title="">[53]</a></sup>  She sported her bee costume to home basketball games and pep rallies. In 1973, a <a href="/wiki/Spandex" id="w">spandex</a>-clad hero named T-Man and his faithful sidekick T<sup>2</sup> patrolled campus in search of opposing mascots and fans.<sup id="_ref-blueprintrrc74_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blueprintrrc74" title="">[54]</a></sup> T-Man would perform spirit skits at pep rallies and home basketball games.

<a id="Bull_Dog_Club" name="Bull_Dog_Club"></a><h5>Bull Dog Club</h5>
<p>The Bull Dog Club was an honor society created in 1910 originally as a social branch of Tech&#39;s Koseme Society.<sup id="_ref-blueprintbdc10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blueprintbdc10" title="">[57]</a></sup>  The Bull Dogs first major role was facilitating the first cross country races that eventually evolved into the Freshman Cake Race.  The Bull Dogs only admitted rising juniors and seniors into their ranks in order to maintain prestige and honor in the club.</p>
<p>The Bull Dogs rise to Institute prominence also lead to their eventual demise.  The Bull Dogs put a particular emphasis on mediating campus-wide sporting events.  The Bull Dogs utilized their Cake Race ties to the Athletic Association in order to coordinate the first intramurals on the athletic playing fields.<sup id="_ref-bulldog69_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bulldog69" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Bull Dogs also aided in spirit and tradition upkeep on campus by aiding in Ramblin&#39; Wreck Parade judging, homecoming queen selection, and homecoming dance planning.<sup id="_ref-bulldog69_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bulldog69" title="">[58]</a></sup> Despite the Bull Dogs roles in homecoming celebrations, their intramural coordination became their primary focus by the 1960&#39;s.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup>  With the planning of the <a href="/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Campus_Recreation_Center" id="w">Student Athletic Center</a>, intramurals were placed under official Institute control rather than the Bull Dogs and in 1969 the Bull Dogs were disbanded relinquishing all homecoming duties to Ramblin&#39; Reck Club and the student government.<sup id="_ref-bulldog69_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bulldog69" title="">[58]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Georgia_Tech_Bands" name="Georgia_Tech_Bands"></a><h4>Georgia Tech Bands</h4>
<p>The Georgia Tech Bands are student musical groups fielded at many of the home athletic and schoolwide events.  None of the musicians receive scholarships for participating in the assorted bands meaning the bands are composed entirely of volunteers.  Since several schools in Atlanta do not field football teams, the GT Marching Band invites students from other Atlanta schools to participate (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Kennesaw_State" id="w">Kennesaw State</a>, <a href="/wiki/Georgia_State" id="w">Georgia State</a>, <a href="/wiki/Agnes_Scott" id="w">Agnes Scott</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>Every home football game and most away games include a 300 member Georgia Tech marching band performing during <a href="/wiki/Dead_ball_(American_football)" id="w">dead ball time</a> and <a href="/wiki/Half-time" id="w">half-time</a>.  The GT Bands also field smaller pep bands at home <a href="/wiki/Basketball" id="w">basketball</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ice_hockey" id="w">ice hockey</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Volleyball" id="w">volleyball</a> games.  The bands are known to follow teams for special events such as <a href="/wiki/Bowl_games" id="w">bowl games</a> and <a href="/wiki/NCAA_Basketball_Tournament" id="w">basketball tournaments</a>.  The ice hockey pep band in particular travels to <a href="/wiki/Savannah%2C_GA" id="w">Savannah</a> every year for the <a href="/wiki/Thrasher_cup" id="w">Thrasher cup</a>.  The band has some of the richest traditions on campus including a strict enforcement of RAT caps amongst first year band members, no matter their actual year in college.<sup id="_ref-bands_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bands" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first Georgia Tech bands were formed in 1908 and lead by Robert &#34;Biddy&#34; Bidez.  Bidez lead the group until his graduation in 1912.  He was succeeded by another student named Mike Greenblatt who continued in Bidez&#39;s footsteps until 1913.  Greenblatt wrote the first versions of <i>Ramblin&#39; Wreck from Georgia Tech</i>.  The first professional band director was Frank &#34;Wop&#34; Roman.  Roman is noted for writing Tech&#39;s Alma Mater as well as <i>Up With the White and Gold</i>.  Roman copyrighted <i>Ramblin&#39; Wreck from Georgia Tech</i> in 1919 and lead the bands until his death in 1928.  Since Roman there have been seven professional band directors.  The directors have had varying levels of success and longevity.</p>

Occasionally, the Goldfellas will attend home basketball, volleyball, or other sporting events. The group had its origins in the 1998 Georgia Tech football season, when a group of guys painted up for the homecoming game against the favored Virginia Cavaliers. The Jackets upset the Cavaliers and the tradition was started and passed on by residents in the now defunct Area II dormitories.<sup id="_ref-goldf_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-goldf" title="">[65]</a></sup> Each member is given a unique face design that is retired upon his graduation.

The Goldfellas take pride in their complete lack of clothing besides a yellow wig and gym shorts.  The group never sits during the course of a football game, not even during halftime. The largest gathering of the Goldfellas occurred in the 2007 football game against rival University of Georgia with over 80 Tech students painted up with the Goldfellas for the event.<sup id="_ref-goldf_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-goldf" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>

<p>Traditionally, Georgia Tech has been called &#34;the Institute&#34; while discouraging use of the terms &#34;the university&#34; or &#34;the college&#34; and such.  The Institute had been divided into &#34;Schools&#34; which are now called &#34;Colleges&#34; for each field of study. For instance, when Georgia Tech&#39;s football team played the University of Miami for its 2006 Homecoming game, several students were seen wearing gold t-shirts that said &#34;Fear the I!&#34; (mocking Miami&#39;s tradition of being called the U).<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup></p>

<p>Due to the traditionally high ratio of male to female students, some students have felt that certain women at Georgia Tech may be stuck up because of all the attention they get from an overwhelming number of males.

As campus expanded onto surrounding lower terrain, the Hill became a much more prominent sight on campus.  The term now is typically used in derision when referring to the administration.  The Hill also refers to the steep incline of Bobby Dodd Way, which residents of East Campus must trek up in order to attend class.  The climb is often referred to as a hike up the Freshman Hill as many freshman courses are held in buildings on the Hill or near the Hill.</p>
