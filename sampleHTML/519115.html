<p>{{nihongo}}, also known as <b><i>Ken, the Great Bear Fist</i></b>, is a <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> <a href="/wiki/Manga" id="w">manga</a> series that was originally serialized from 1983 to 1988 in the Japanese magazine <i><a href="/wiki/Weekly_Shonen_Jump" id="w">Weekly Shonen Jump</a></i>, created by <a href="/wiki/Tetsuo_Hara" id="w">Tetsuo Hara</a> and <a href="/wiki/Buronson" id="w">Buronson</a>. The manga spans 245 chapters that were originally reprinted in 27 collected volumes (<a href="/wiki/Tank%C5%8Dbon" id="w">tankōbon</a>) under the <i>Jump Comics</i> imprint.</p>
<p>Set in a <a href="/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction" id="w">post apocalyptic</a> world where the Earth is barren and the strong survive by preying on the weak, the series follows the journey of <a href="/wiki/Kenshiro" id="w">Kenshiro</a>, the successor of <i><a href="/wiki/Hokuto_Shinken" id="w">Hokuto Shinken</a></i> (北斗神拳, &#34;Divine Fist of the North Star&#34;),<sup id="_ref-hokutoshinken_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hokutoshinken" title="">[1]</a></sup> a secret martial arts style that allows its practitioner to destroy an opponent&#39;s body from within by striking into their secret <a href="/wiki/Channel_(Chinese_medicine)" id="w">channeling</a> points, often resulting in a violent and gruesome death. Kenshiro uses his skills to protect the weak and innocent against the numerous villains that threaten their survival.</p>
<p><i>Fist of the North Star</i> was one of the <i>Weekly Shonen Jump&#39;s</i> most popular titles during the <a href="/wiki/1980%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">1980&#39;s</a>. As of 2007, it is the seventh best-selling <i>Shonen Jump</i> manga of all time in <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>.<sup id="_ref-comipress_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comipress" title="">[2]</a></sup> In a poll conducted by <a href="/wiki/TV_Asahi" id="w">TV Asahi</a> in 2005, the <i>Fist of the North Star</i> anime series ranked 25 in a list of Top 100 Anime series.<sup id="_ref-asahi1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-asahi1" title="">[3]</a></sup> In a second poll in 2006, it ranked No. 89.<sup id="_ref-asahi2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-asahi2" title="">[4]</a></sup> In a celebrity version of the poll, it ranked No. 15.</p>
<p>The title <i>Fist of the North Star</i> is somewhat of a <a href="/wiki/Mistranslation" id="w">mistranslation</a> of the Japanese original, as <i>Hokuto</i> refers not to the <a href="/wiki/Polaris" id="w">North Star</a> <a href="/wiki/Polaris" id="w">Polaris</a>, but to the <a href="/wiki/Big_Dipper" id="w">Big Dipper</a> <a href="/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy)" id="w">asterism</a>, which is known in Japan as <i>Hokuto Shichisei</i> (北斗七星, literally &#34;Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper&#34;). In Japan, the actual North Star is known as <i>Hokkyokusei</i> (北極星, &#34;North Pole Star&#34;) or <i>Tenteisei</i> (天帝星, &#34;Imperial Star&#34;). In official English localization of the series, the term <i>Hokuto</i> is usually translated as &#34;North Star&#34; in an effort to maintain consistency with the title.</p>

<a id="Pilot_version" name="Pilot_version"></a><h3>Pilot version</h3>
<p>The original <a href="/wiki/One-shot_(comics)" id="w">one shot</a> prototype of <i>Hokuto no Ken</i>, published in the April <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a> edition of <i>Fresh Jump</i>, was set in present-day <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> and told the story of a teenager by the name of {{nihongo}}, the successor of the &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/Hokuto_Shinken" id="w">Hokuto Shinken</a></i>&#34; <a href="/wiki/Martial_arts" id="w">martial arts</a> style, a deadly style which kills or cripples opponents internally by striking <a href="/wiki/Pressure_point" id="w">pressure points</a>. Kenshiro&#39;s main adversaries in this incarnation of the story were a rival martial arts school known as the {{nihongo}}, a secret organization of assassins with influence over the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_government" id="w">Japanese government</a>. Kenshiro&#39;s girlfriend, Yuki, becomes a witness in one of the organization&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Assassination" id="w">hits</a> and is subsequently killed by the culprit, with Kenshiro being framed for the crime. This event serves as a catalyst for Kenshiro&#39;s war against the Taizanji organization.
A second one-shot, titled <i>Hokuto no Ken II</i>, was published in the June 1983 issue of <i>Fresh Jump</i>. Both pilots were collected in the second collected volume of <i>Tetsu no Don Quixote</i> (Tetsuo Hara&#39;s prior manga series before <i>Hokuto no Ken</i>).</p>
<p>Tetsuo Hara has stated that he came up with the idea of <i>Hokuto no Ken</i> from his editor <a href="/wiki/Nobuhiko_Horie" id="w">Nobuhiko Horie</a>. According to Hara, Horie suggested to him that he should draw a manga about &#34;a <a href="/wiki/Martial_artist" id="w">martial artist</a> who destroys his opponents by striking their acupressure points&#34; based on Hara&#39;s wishes to draw a martial arts manga and his knowledge of pressure points.<sup id="_ref-raijinhara_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-raijinhara" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

The two <i>Hokuto no Ken</i> one-shots were well-received in <i>Fresh Jump<b>s reader&#39;s survey and when Tetsuo Hara was commissioned to turn <i>Hokuto no Ken</i> into a weekly series, the task was reportedly too much for Hara to handle alone and manga writer <a href="/wiki/Yoshiyuki_Okamura" id="w">Yoshiyuki Okamura</a> (who worked on the series under the pen name of <a href="/wiki/Buronson" id="w">Buronson</a>) was assigned to work with him. The storyline was completely revamped, with the present-day setting being discarded in favor of a <i><a href="/wiki/Mad_Max" id="w">Mad Max</a></i>-inspired post apocalyptic future. The Taizanji Kenpo school were no longer the main antagonists and Kenshiro, originally a teenager, was now an adult with seven scars on his chest whose design was partly inspired by <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Lee" id="w">Bruce Lee</a>.<sup id="_ref-ADVBuronson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ADVBuronson" title="">[6]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>Originally, Tetsuo Hara was contracted to do <i>Fist of the North Star</i> for a three-year run, but due to its popularity and the publisher&#39;s demand, it was extended to a five-year run.<sup id="_ref-raijinhara_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-raijinhara" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Sequels_and_spinoffs" name="Sequels_and_spinoffs"></a><h3>Sequels and spinoffs</h3>
<p>After the manga ended its run, Tetsuo Hara and Buronson wrote a novel based on the manga titled {{nihongo}}, published by Jump Books in Japan in <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a>. It was adapted into a three-part <a href="/wiki/OVA" id="w">OVA</a> series titled {{nihongo}} in <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>. The story is set sometime after the conclusion of the manga.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>, Tetsuo Hara began working on a <i>Fist of the North Star</i> prequel titled {{nihongo}}, which is currently serialized in  <i><a href="/wiki/Weekly_Comic_Bunch" id="w">Weekly Comic Bunch</a></i>. Set during the <a href="/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War" id="w">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> in <a href="/wiki/1935" id="w">1935</a>, the story stars <a href="/wiki/Hokuto_Shinken" id="w">Hokuto Shinken</a> predecessor and Kenshiro&#39;s namesake, Kenshiro Kasumi.</p>
<p>Following the theatrical release of the movie <i>Raō Den Jun&#39;ai no Sho</i> in 2006, numerous <i>Fist of the North Star</i> spinoffs began to be published in the <i>Weekly Comic Bunch</i> and <i>Big Comics Superior</i>. This lineup of titles has been dubbed the {{nihongo}} series, as each title focuses on a major character from the franchise. The following titles had been published so far:</p>

<a id="Plot_overview" name="Plot_overview"></a><h2>Plot overview</h2>
<p>The prologue of <i>Fist of the North Star</i> informs us that the world was engaged in a global <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_war" id="w">nuclear war</a> in the year <a href="/wiki/19XX" id="w">199X</a>. After the war, the earth&#39;s surface became devoid of vegetation, the seas evaporated and civilization was thrown into chaos, turning everyday life into a battle for supplies of uncontaminated food and water, where the strong survive by preying on the weak. However, one man vows to make a difference. <a href="/wiki/Kenshiro" id="w">Kenshiro</a> is the successor of the art of <a href="/wiki/Hokuto_Shinken" id="w">Hokuto Shinken</a>, a deadly 1,800 year-old <a href="/wiki/Ansatsuken" id="w">assassination style</a> that is only passed down from one master to a chosen son. Kenshiro uses his skills and knowledge to protect the innocent from the bloodthirsty gangs that threaten their survival. Throughout the course of the series, Kenshiro meets several allies and rivals, most of whom are also trained in various martial arts styles.</p>
<p>The first chapter serves to introduce Kenshiro and depicts his initial meeting with his two sidekicks, <a href="/wiki/Bat_(Fist_of_the_North_Star)" id="w">Bat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lin_(Fist_of_the_North_Star)" id="w">Lin</a>. The initial story arc then centers Kenshiro&#39;s quest to reclaim his <a href="/wiki/Fiancee" id="w">fiancee</a> Yuria, who was taken from him by his former friend Shin, a master of the rival {{nihongo}} style.<sup id="_ref-Nanto_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nanto" title="">[11]</a></sup>  After the Shin arc, the manga began focusing around one-off arc-based villains such as the Golan, Jackal and the Fang Clan, although the story gradually shifts to Ken&#39;s search for his three adopted brothers, who were trained in the Hokuto Shinken style under the same master but were not chosen to be successors. The eldest of the brothers, <a href="/wiki/Raoh" id="w">Raoh</a>, becomes the primary <a href="/wiki/Antagonist" id="w">antagonist</a> and Ken&#39;s primary nemesis at this point, a conqueror who uses Hokuto Shinken to rule with tyranny. A major <a href="/wiki/Sub-plot" id="w">sub-plot</a> is also introduced in the form of an internal conflict within the Nanto school between its six grand masters, the {{nihongo}}, and the Hokuto brothers&#39; involvement in it.</p>
<p>The death of Raoh marks the end of the first era of the series and the setting jumps several years, with Ken&#39;s sidekicks Bat and Lin having reached adulthood. Kenshiro returns to help Bat and Lin overthrow the evil Jakoh, a corrupt Governor General that has usurped the throne of the Heavenly Empress and is coercing the {{nihongo}} masters to do his evil bidding. After Jakoh&#39;s defeat, Lin is kidnapped and taken overseas to the {{nihongo}}, a war-torn nation now ruled by the three {{nihongo}}. The origins of the Hokuto brothers and the Hokuto Shinken style are revealed, as well as the existence of the forbidden {{nihongo}} style, a branch of the original {{nihongo}} formed alongside with Hokuto Shinken. </p>
<p>After Kaioh&#39;s defeat, Raoh&#39;s son Ryu is introduced as Kenshiro&#39;s apprentice and possible successor to the Hokuto Shinken style. The final chapters centers around Kenshiro&#39;s adventures with the young Ryu and explores the relationship between Ken, Lin and Bat.</p>
<a id="Characters" name="Characters"></a><h3>Characters</h3>
<p>{{see}}
<i>Fist of the North Star</i> has a large ensemble of characters that has changed constantly during the series&#39; original five-year run. Among the inhabitants of the post-apocalyptic world of <i>Fist of the North Star</i> includes martial artists, royal families, rebels, bandits and villagers that are merely attempting to survive a cruel, harsh world. </p>
<p>Although protagonist <a href="/wiki/Kenshiro" id="w">Kenshiro</a> is the only truly permanent character from the series&#39; inception up until the final chapter, his two <a href="/wiki/Sidekick" id="w">sidekicks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bat_(Fist_of_the_North_Star)" id="w">Bat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lin_(Fist_of_the_North_Star)" id="w">Lin</a> have serve as series&#39; mainstays as well, introduced as a pair of orphaned children whom Kenshiro meets during the first chapter of the series and then growing up into rebel leaders and heroes in their own right. </p>
<p>Kenshiro encounters several rivals and allies throughout the course of the series, many of whom are affiliated with the martial arts schools featured in the series (see fighting styles section). The series initially focuses on two rival factions, the <a href="/wiki/Hokuto_Shinken" id="w">Hokuto Shinken</a> school and the <a href="/wiki/Nanto_Seiken" id="w">Nanto Seiken</a> school. <a href="/wiki/Characters_in_Fist_of_the_North_Star#Shin" id="w">Shin</a>, a representative of Nanto Seiken, serves as Kenshiro&#39;s first major nemesis, being the man responsible for engraving the seven stab wounds on Kenshiro&#39;s chest and kidnapping his fiancee <a href="/wiki/Characters_in_Fist_of_the_North_Star#Yuria" id="w">Yuria</a>. After Shin&#39;s death, the authors would expand the storyline by introducing other Hokuto and Nanto disciples, namely the Nanto Roku Seiken and the four Hokuto brothers. A major recurring antagonist is introduced in the form of <a href="/wiki/Raoh" id="w">Raoh</a>, the eldest of the four Hokuto brothers, who would become the series&#39; most prominent villain.</p>
<p>After Raoh&#39;s death, the <a href="/wiki/Characters_in_Fist_of_the_North_Star#Gento Koken" id="w">Gento Kōken</a> fighters and their leader Falco would serve as reluctant adversaries of Kenshiro. Another group of antagonists are introduced with the fighters from the Land of Asura. Their ruler of Asura, <a href="/wiki/Characters_in_Fist_of_the_North_Star#Hokuto Ryuken" id="w">Kaioh</a> of the Hokuto Ryuken school, is the last major nemesis Kenshiro confronts in the series, although other villains appear after him in the manga.</p>
<p>Many of the characters in the series have since become stars of their own spinoff manga (see later works section).</p>
<a id="Fighting_styles" name="Fighting_styles"></a><h3> Fighting styles </h3>
<p>{{see}}
The primary <a href="/wiki/Fighting_style" id="w">fighting style</a> depicted in <i>Fist of the North Star</i> is <i><a href="/wiki/Hokuto_Shinken" id="w">Hokuto Shinken</a></i>, the style used by Kenshiro and his three adopted brothers. <i>Hokuto Shinken</i> relies primarily on 708 secret <a href="/wiki/Accupressure" id="w">accupressure</a> points on the human&#39;s body that forms part of a fictional system known as the {{nihongo}}. By pushing into one of the <i>hikō</i> points, one can cause destruction into the enemy&#39;s body from within or even control their body against their own will. There are also beneficial <i>hikō</i> points that can be used to cure sickness or heal wounds, including restore a mute person&#39;s voice or a blind person&#39;s sight. In addition, the masters of <i>Hokuto Shinken</i> can tap into their body&#39;s full potential strength, whereas an average person only uses 30% of their strength.</p>
<p>The main rival style of <i>Hokuto Shinken</i> in the beginning of the series is <i><a href="/wiki/Nanto_Seiken" id="w">Nanto Seiken</a></i>, a style which is described as the <a href="/wiki/Yin_and_yang" id="w">polar opposite</a> of <i>Hokuto Shinken</i>. In contrast to the <i>Hokuto</i> style, which uses the <i>hikō</i> points to cause destruction from within, the <i>Nanto</i> style specializes in stabbing and slicing techniques that penetrate the body from the outside and destroy everything in its path. Originally the style is used by Shin, the first major antagonist, but throughout the course of the series the existence of other branches of the <i>Nanto Seiken</i> are revealed, the six top branches being the <i>Nanto Roku Seiken</i>.</p>
<p>Two other major styles are introduced during the latter half of the series; <i>Gento Kōken</i>, a style which specializes in  <a href="/wiki/Qi" id="w">ki</a>-based projectile attacks that destroy the enemy on a cellular level; and <i>Hokuto Ryūken</i>, a brother style of <i>Hokuto Shinken</i> which causes destruction through an opponent&#39;s {{nihongo}} and teaches its users to summon their {{nihongo}}.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption"><i>Fist of the North Star: Master Edition Vol. 9</i>, published by Gutsoon.</div>
Two different companies attempted to translate the original <i>Fist of the North Star</i> manga for the English market, although both attempts failed to finish their run. <a href="/wiki/VIZ_Media" id="w">VIZ Communications</a> originally published the first sixteen chapters in eight monthly squarebound comic book issues (two/three chapters per issue) in <a href="/wiki/1989" id="w">1989</a>. Viz resumed publication of the series from <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a> to <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>, publishing the subsequent 28 chapters of the series in 18 monthly pamphlet-sized issues (each issue containing roughly one chapter and a half) divided into three &#34;parts&#34;. Four graphic novel collections were published by Viz: <i>Fist of the North Star</i>, <i>Night of the Jackal</i>, <i>Southern Cross</i> and <i>Blood Brothers</i>. The Viz edition featured mirrored artwork, as was the standard with English translated manga at the time.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>, <a href="/wiki/Raijin_Comics" id="w">Gutsoon! Entertainment</a> began publishing a <i>Master Edition</i> of the series, large squarebound graphic novel installments (eight/nine chapters per volume) that were printed in high quality paper. In addition to sporting a revised translation and retaining the original right-to-left orientation, the <i>Master Edition</i> of the series also featured new <a href="/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" id="w">CG</a> coloring added to the original artwork. Gutsoon ceased publication of the series with Vol. 9 due to the company folding. The license has yet to be picked up by another company.

<div class="thumbcaption"><i>Hokuto no Ken 2</i> title card.</div>
<i>Hokuto no Ken</i> was first adaptated into a weekly anime series by <a href="/wiki/Toei_Animation" id="w">Toei Animation</a>. The series aired on <a href="/wiki/Fuji_Television" id="w">Fuji Television</a> from <a href="/wiki/October_4" id="w">October 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1984" id="w">1984</a> to <a href="/wiki/March_5" id="w">March 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1987" id="w">1987</a> and was given the subtitle of {{nihongo}} following episode 22.<sup id="_ref-airdate_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-airdate" title="">[21]</a></sup> It was immediately followed by a sequel series, titled <i>Hokuto no Ken 2</i>, which aired from <a href="/wiki/March_13" id="w">March 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1987" id="w">1987</a> to <a href="/wiki/February_18" id="w">February 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1988" id="w">1988</a>. A combined total of 152 episodes were produced for the two series. Reruns are aired in Japan on the <a href="/wiki/Satellite_television" id="w">satellite television</a> network <a href="/wiki/Animax" id="w">Animax</a>.</p>
<p>The violent content of the TV series is toned down considerably compared to the original manga, with much of the gore being discolored via desaturation. Like many manga-based anime series, <a href="/wiki/Filler_(media)" id="w">filler</a> material was added to prevent the series from getting ahead of its source material. </p>
<p>The <i>Hokuto no Ken</i> portion of the series spans four major story arcs that follows the manga&#39;s plotline from the beginning and up until chapter 136 (prior to the timeskip). Each story arc (or chapters, as they referred within the show) spans a certain number of episodes each adapting a portion of the original manga. The first chapter is based on chapters 1-25 of the original manga, but changes the order of events so that Ken&#39;s battle with Shin is left for last, turning all the other villains into his subordinates. The rest of the series follows the manga&#39;s plotline more closely. The <i>Hokuto no Ken 2</i> portion takes place after the timeskip and adapts the storyline of the Celestial Emperor and Asura arcs of the manga.

<p>Manga Entertainment&#39;s treatment of the series has been criticized by reviewers, particularly at their decision to replace the original Japanese soundtrack with their own music for the English dub.

<div class="thumbcaption">A promotional illustration of the <i>Fist of the North Star</i> animated movie.</div></div>

An animated <a href="/wiki/Feature_film" id="w">feature film</a> version of <i>Fist of the North Star</i> was produced by <a href="/wiki/Toei_Animation" id="w">Toei Animation</a>, which premiered in Japan on <a href="/wiki/March_8" id="w">March 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1986" id="w">1986</a>. The movie was intended to be a big-screen treatment of the manga, and avoid the watering-down of violence that came with the TV series. An English-dubbed version produced by <a href="/wiki/Streamline_Pictures" id="w">Streamline Pictures</a> was first released in <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a>.</p>
<p>In a notable deviation from the series, the film finds time to begin with a detailed peek at the Earth as it was before and during the fabled nuclear devastation. Starting with a calm, surreal look at various points of mother nature, a brief on-screen message then informs the audience of the imminent calamity, followed by unsettling scenes of human life consumed in flame.</p>
<p>The film follows the TV series and manga from Kenshiro&#39;s defeat at the hands of Shin to the first battle with Raoh, although certain liberties were taken to tell the story in a condensed form. Toki, the second of the four Hokuto Brothers, is never seen or mentioned, while Shin and Rei are the only Nanto Seiken masters to appear in the film. While Yuria&#39;s Nanto heritage is mentioned thorought the movie in the Japanese version, her role as the Last Nanto General is downplayed. Mamiya, Rei&#39;s love interest, is never seen, partly because Yuria is the heroine in her place. Raoh serves as the main antagonist, with Jagi and Shin as the other two major villains. Many other villains from the manga such as the Colonel and Jackal only make cameo appearances as minor henchmen with some of the notable fight scenes involving Zeed, Heart, the Fang King and Uighur.</p>
<p>There were two endings produced for the film. The original theatrical ending in Japan showed Raoh emerging victorious over Kenshiro, but sparing his life, leaving him to protect Lin. An alternate ending was produced that shows the fight ending in a draw, which was the ending featured in the VHS and Laserdisc release of the film in Japan. The English dub version by Streamline Pictures is based on the theatrical version and thus features the original ending. Many Western fans believe that the &#34;draw ending&#34; was the original ending, but this is a common misconception due to the fact that the original ending where Raoh wins is not featured in any of the official home video releases in Japan.</p>
<p>The English dub version of the movie was not only first animated incarnation of <i>Fist of the North Star</i> to be released in English, it was also one of the earliest anime films distributed in North America and has had mixed reviews among casual viewers and anime fandom. A review from Akemi&#39;s Anime World calls it &#34;so bad it&#39;s good, and the original in the genre&#34; and calls quality of the dub &#34;cheesy&#34;, but &#34;suitable&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Akemi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Akemi" title="">[30]</a></sup> Richard Harrington of the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Post" id="w">Washington Post</a> criticized the violent nature of the movie and quality of the animation, saying that &#34;watching it you&#39;ll feel as comfortable as a hemophiliac in a razor blade factory&#34;.<sup id="_ref-washingtonpost_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washingtonpost" title="">[31]</a></sup> Stephen Nolden of the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" id="w">New York Times</a> expresses that &#34;in its carelessly translated and poorly dubbed English adaptation, the characters express themselves in diction so stiff that they seem ludicrously prissy&#34;.<sup id="_ref-NYtimes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYtimes" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<a id="1995_live-action_movie" name="1995_live-action_movie"></a><h3>1995 live-action movie</h3>
<p>An American-produced live-action movie version of <i>Fist of the North Star</i> was released in 1995, directed by <a href="/wiki/Tony_Randel" id="w">Tony Randel</a> based on a script by Peter Atkins and Wynne McLaughlin. The movie, loosely based on the Shin storyline of the manga, stars <a href="/wiki/Gary_Daniels" id="w">Gary Daniels</a> as Kenshiro, <a href="/wiki/Costas_Mandylor" id="w">Costas Mandylor</a> as Shin and Japanese actress Isako Washio as Yuria, with <a href="/wiki/Malcom_McDowell" id="w">Malcom McDowell</a> as Ryuken and <a href="/wiki/Chris_Penn" id="w">Chris Penn</a> as &#34;Jackal&#34; (actually a renamed Jagi). The movie saw a theatrical release in Japan, but went <a href="/wiki/Direct-to-video" id="w">straight-to-video</a> in the US. The Japanese dubbed version used the original voice actors from the 1980s anime series.</p>
<p>The movie had mixed reviews from fans and critics. <a href="/wiki/Dave_Foster" id="w">Dave Foster</a> of <i>DVD Times</i> panned the movie as a poor adaptation and commented that Kenshiro&#39;s pressure point techniques &#34;<i>look rather tame</i>&#34; in comparison to the way depicted in the manga and anime series.<sup id="_ref-DVDTimes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DVDTimes" title="">[33]</a></sup> A reviewer from eFilmCritic remarked that Kenshiro&#39;s defeat at the hands of Shin &#34;<i>comes off as standard</i>&#34; and &#34;<i>unbelievably goofy</i>&#34; compared to the 1986 animated movie version. However, Video World gave a much more positive review, calling it &#34;First rate&#34;, and an Amazon.com reviewer commented that &#34;Bruce Lee would have loved this movie.&#34;<sup id="_ref-efilmcritic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-efilmcritic" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
