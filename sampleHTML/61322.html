He was the last famous member of his mother&#39;s aristocratic family, the <a href="/wiki/Alcmaeonidae" id="w">Alcmaeonidae</a>, which fell from prominence after the <a href="/wiki/Peloponnesian_War" id="w">Peloponnesian War</a>. He played a major role in the second half of that conflict as a strategic advisor, military commander, and politician.</p>
<p>During the course of the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades changed his allegiance on several occasions. In his native Athens in the early 410s BC, he advocated for an aggressive foreign policy, and was a prominent proponent of the <a href="/wiki/Sicilian_Expedition" id="w">Sicilian Expedition</a>, but fled to <a href="/wiki/History_of_Sparta" id="w">Sparta</a> after his political enemies brought charges of <a href="/wiki/Sacrilege" id="w">sacrilege</a> against him. In Sparta, he served as a strategic advisor, proposing or supervising several major campaigns against Athens. In Sparta too, however, Alcibiades soon made powerful enemies and was forced to defect to <a href="/wiki/Achaemenid_Dynasty" id="w">Persia</a>. There he served as an advisor to the <a href="/wiki/Satrap" id="w">satrap</a> <a href="/wiki/Tissaphernes" id="w">Tissaphernes</a> until his Athenian political allies brought about his recall. He then served as an Athenian General (<a href="/wiki/Strategos" id="w">Strategos</a>) for several years, but his enemies eventually succeeded in exiling him a second time.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Sicilian_Expedition" id="w">Sicilian Expedition</a> was Alcibiades&#39; creation, and modern scholars have argued that, had that expedition been under Alcibiades&#39; command instead of <a href="/wiki/Nicias" id="w">Nicias</a>&#39;, the expedition might not have met its eventual disastrous fate.<sup id="_ref-Vlachos59_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vlachos59" title="">[1]</a></sup> In the years that he served Sparta, Alcibiades played a significant role in Athens&#39; undoing; the capture of <a href="/wiki/Decelea" id="w">Decelea</a> and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision. Once restored to his native city, however, he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens. He favored unconventional tactics, frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by <a href="/wiki/Siege" id="w">siege</a>.<sup id="_ref-Kern151_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kern151" title="">[2]</a></sup> Alcibiades&#39; military and political talents frequently proved valuable to whichever <a href="/wiki/Polis" id="w">state</a> currently held his allegiance, but his capacity for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long; and, by the end of the war he had helped rekindle in the early 410s, his days of political relevance were a bygone memory.</p>

<a id="Rise_to_prominence" name="Rise_to_prominence"></a><h3>Rise to prominence</h3>
<p>Alcibiades first rose to prominence when he began advocating aggressive Athenian action after the signing of the <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Nicias" id="w">Peace of Nicias</a>. That treaty, an uneasy truce between Sparta and Athens signed midway through the Peloponnesian War, came at the end of seven years of fighting in which neither side had gained a decisive advantage. Historians Arnold W. Gomme and Raphael Sealey believe, and <a href="/wiki/Thucydides" id="w">Thucydides</a> reports,<sup id="_ref-Thucydides 5.43_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Thucydides 5.43" title="">[12]</a></sup> that Alcibiades was offended that the Spartans had negotiated that treaty through Nicias and <a href="/wiki/Laches_(person)" id="w">Laches</a>, overlooking him on account of his youth.<sup id="_ref-Gomme339_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gomme339" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Sealey353_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sealey353" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Disputes over the interpretation of the treaty led the Spartans to dispatch ambassadors to Athens with full powers to arrange all unsettled matters. The Athenians initially received these ambassadors well, but Alcibiades met with them in secret before they were to speak to the <a href="/wiki/Ecclesia_(ancient_Athens)" id="w">ecclesia</a> (the Athenian Assembly) and told them that the Assembly was haughty and had great ambitions.<sup id="_ref-Alcibiades14_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alcibiades14" title="">[15]</a></sup> He urged them to renounce their diplomatic authority to represent Sparta, and instead allow him to assist them through his influence in Athenian politics.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> The representatives agreed and, impressed with Alcibiades&#39; foresight, they alienated themselves from Nicias, who sincerely wanted to reach an agreement with the Spartans.<sup id="_ref-Alcibiades14_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alcibiades14" title="">[15]</a></sup> The next day, during the Assembly, Alcibiades asked them what powers Sparta had granted them to negotiate and they replied, as agreed, that they had not come with full and independent powers. This was in direct contradiction to what they had said the day before, and Alcibiades seized on this opportunity to denounce their character, cast suspicion on their aims, and destroy their credibility. This ploy increased Alcibiades&#39; standing while embarrassing Nicias, and Alcibiades was subsequently appointed General. He took advantage of his increasing power to orchestrate the creation of an alliance between <a href="/wiki/Argos" id="w">Argos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mantinea" id="w">Mantinea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elis" id="w">Elis</a>, and other states in the Peloponnese, threatening Sparta&#39;s dominance in the region. According to Gomme, &#34;it was a grandiose scheme for an Athenian general at the head of a mainly Peloponnesian army to march through the Peloponnese cocking a snook at Sparta when her reputation was at its lowest&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Gomme30_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gomme30" title="">[17]</a></sup> This alliance, however, would ultimately be defeated at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Mantinea_(418_BC)" id="w">Battle of Mantinea</a>.<sup id="_ref-Alcibiades15_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alcibiades15" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Somewhere in the years <a href="/wiki/416_BC" id="w">416</a>–<a href="/wiki/415_BC" id="w">415 BC</a>, a complex struggle took place between <a href="/wiki/Hyperbolos" id="w">Hyperbolos</a> on one side and Nicias and Alcibiades on the other. Hyperbolos tried to bring about the ostracism of one of this pair, but Nicias and Alcibiades combined their influence to induce the people to expel Hyperbolos instead.<sup id="_ref-Alcibiades13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alcibiades13" title="">[19]</a></sup> This incident reveals that Nicias and Alcibiades each commanded a personal following, whose votes were determined by the wishes of the leaders.<sup id="_ref-Sealey353_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sealey353" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 415 BC, delegates from the Sicilian city of <a href="/wiki/Segesta" id="w">Segesta</a> (<a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a>: Egesta) arrived at Athens to plead for the support of the Athenians in their war against <a href="/wiki/Selinus" id="w">Selinus</a>. During the debates on the undertaking, Nicias was vehemently opposed to Athenian intervention, explaining that the campaign would be very costly and attacking the character and motives of Alcibiades, who had emerged as the supporter of the expedition. On the other hand, Alcibiades argued that a campaign in this new theatre would bring riches to the city and expand the empire, just as the <a href="/wiki/Persian_Wars" id="w">Persian Wars</a> had. In his speech Alcibiades predicted (over-optimistically, in the opinion of most historians) that the Athenians would be able to recruit allies in the region and impose their rule on <a href="/wiki/Syracuse%2C_Sicily" id="w">Syracuse</a>, the most powerful city of <a href="/wiki/Sicily" id="w">Sicily</a>.<sup id="_ref-Platias237_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Platias237" title="">[22]</a></sup> In spite of Alcibiades&#39; enthusiastic advocacy for the plan, it was Nicias, not he, who turned a modest undertaking into a massive campaign and made the conquest of Sicily seem possible and safe.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> It was at his suggestion that the size of the fleet was significantly increased from 60 ships to &#34;140 galleys, 5,100 men at arms, and about 1300 archers, slingers, and light armed men&#34;.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Philosopher <a href="/wiki/Leo_Strauss" id="w">Leo Strauss</a> underscores that the Sicilian expedition surpassed everything undertaken by Pericles. Almost certainly Nicias&#39; intention was to shock the assembly with his high estimate of the forces required, but, instead of dissuading his fellow citizens, his analysis made them all the more eager.<sup id="_ref-Strauss104_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Strauss104" title="">[25]</a></sup>  Against his wishes Nicias was appointed General along with Alcibiades and <a href="/wiki/Lamachus" id="w">Lamachus</a>, all three of whom were given full powers to do whatever was in the best interests of Athens while in Sicily.<sup id="_ref-Th6.26_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th6.26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>One night during preparations for the expedition, the <a href="/wiki/Herma" id="w">hermai</a>, heads of the god <a href="/wiki/Hermes" id="w">Hermes</a> on a <a href="/wiki/Plinth" id="w">plinth</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Phallus" id="w">phallus</a>, were mutilated throughout Athens. This was a religious scandal and was seen as a bad omen for the mission. Plutarch explains that <a href="/wiki/Androcles" id="w">Androcles</a>, a political leader, used false witnesses who accused Alcibiades and his friends of mutilating the statues, and of profaning the <a href="/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries" id="w">Eleusinian Mysteries</a>. Later his opponents, chief among them being Androcles and Thessalus, <a href="/wiki/Cimon" id="w">Cimon</a>&#39;s son, enlisted orators to argue that Alcibiades should set sail as planned and stand trial on his return from the campaign. Alcibiades was suspicious of their intentions, and asked to be allowed to stand trial immediately, under penalty of death, in order to clear his name.<sup id="_ref-Alcibiades19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alcibiades19" title="">[27]</a></sup> This request was denied, and the fleet set sail soon after, with the charges unresolved.<sup id="_ref-Th6.29_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th6.29" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

<p>On his arrival in the Persian court, Alcibiades won the trust of the powerful <a href="/wiki/Satrap" id="w">satrap</a> and made several policy suggestions which were well received. According to <a href="/wiki/Thucydides" id="w">Thucydides</a>, Alcibiades immediately began to do all he could with Tissaphernes to injure the Peloponnesian cause. At his urging, the satrap reduced the payments he was making to the Peloponnesian fleet and began delivering them irregularly.<sup id="_ref-Th8.45_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.45" title="">[43]</a></sup> Alcibiades next advised Tissaphernes to bribe the Generals of the cities to gain valuable intelligence on their activities. Lastly, and most importantly, he told the satrap to be in no hurry to bring the Persian fleet into the conflict, as the longer the war dragged out the more exhausted the combatants would become. This would allow the Persians to more easily conquer the region in the aftermath of the fighting. Alcibiades tried to convince the satrap that it was in Persia&#39;s interest to wear both Athens and Sparta out at first, &#34;and after docking the Athenian power as much as he could, forthwith to rid the country of the Peloponnesians&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Th8.46_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.46" title="">[44]</a></sup> Although Alcibiades&#39; advice benefited the Persians, it was merely a means to an end; Thucydides tells us that his real motive was to use his alleged influence with the Persians to effect his restoration to Athens.<sup id="_ref-Th8.47_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.47" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Negotiations_with_the_Athenian_oligarchs" name="Negotiations_with_the_Athenian_oligarchs"></a><h3>Negotiations with the Athenian oligarchs</h3>
<p>Alcibiades seemed to assume that the &#34;radical democracy&#34; would never agree to his recall to Athens.<sup id="_ref-Buckley411_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Buckley411" title="">[46]</a></sup> Therefore, he exchanged messages with the Athenian leaders at <a href="/wiki/Samos" id="w">Samos</a> and suggested that if they could install an <a href="/wiki/Oligarchy" id="w">oligarchy</a> friendly to him he would return to Athens and bring with him Persian money and possibly the Persian fleet of 147 triremes.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> Alcibiades set about winning over the most influential military officers, and achieved his goal by offering them a threefold plan: the Athenian constitution was to be changed, the recall of Alcibiades was to be voted, and Alcibiades was to win over Tissaphernes and the King of Persia to the Athenian side. Most of the officers in the Athenian fleet accepted the plan and welcomed the prospect of a narrower constitution, which would allow them a greater share in determining policy. According to Thucydides, only one of the Athenian Generals at Samos, <a href="/wiki/Phrynichus" id="w">Phrynichus</a>, opposed the plan and argued that Alcibiades cared no more for the proposed oligarchy than for the traditional democracy.<sup id="_ref-Sealey359_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sealey359" title="">[48]</a></sup> The involvement in the plot of another General, <a href="/wiki/Thrasybulus" id="w">Thrasybulus</a>, remains unclear.{{Cref}}</p>
<p>These officers of the Athenian fleet formed a group of conspirators, but were met with opposition from the majority of the soldiers and sailors; these were eventually calmed down &#34;by the advantageous prospect of the pay from the king&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Th8.48_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.48" title="">[49]</a></sup> The members of the group assembled and prepared to send <a href="/wiki/Pisander" id="w">Pisander</a>, one of their number, on an embassy to Athens to treat for the restoration of Alcibiades and the abolition of the democracy in the city, and thus to make Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians.<sup id="_ref-Th8.49_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.49" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>Phrynichus, fearing that Alcibiades if restored would avenge himself upon him for his opposition, sent a secret letter to the Spartan Admiral, Astyochus, to tell him that Alcibiades was ruining their cause by making Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians, and containing an express revelation of the rest of the intrigue. Astyochus went up to Alcibiades and Tissaphernes at <a href="/wiki/Magnesia_on_the_Maeander" id="w">Magnesia</a> and communicated to them Phrynichus&#39;s letter. Alcibiades responded in kind, sending to the authorities at Samos a letter against Phrynichus, stating what he had done, and requiring that he should be put to death.<sup id="_ref-Th8.50_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.50" title="">[51]</a></sup> Phrynichus in desperation wrote again to Astyochus, offering him a chance to destroy the Athenian fleet at Samos. This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades who informed the officers at Samos that they had been betrayed by Phrynichus. Alcibiades however gained no credit, because Phrynichus had anticipated Alcibiades&#39;s letter and, before the accusations could arrive, told the army that he had received information of an enemy plan to attack the camp and that they should fortify Samos as quickly as possible.<sup id="_ref-Th8.51_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.51" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite these events, Pisander and the other envoys of the conspirators arrived at Athens, and made a speech before the people. Pisander won the argument, putting Alcibiades and his promises at the center. The Ecclesia deposed Phrynichus and elected Pisander and ten other envoys to negotiate with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades.<sup id="_ref-Th8.53_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p> 
<p>At this point, Alcibiades&#39;s scheme encountered a great obstacle. Tissaphernes would not make an agreement on any terms, wanting to follow his policy of neutrality.<sup id="_ref-Kagan136-138_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kagan136-138" title="">[54]</a></sup> As Kagan points out, Tissaphernes was a prudent leader and had recognized the advantages of wearing each side out without direct Persian involvement.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> Alcibiades realized this and, by presenting the Athenians with stiffer and stiffer demands on Tissaphernes&#39; behalf, attempted to convince them that he had persuaded Tissaphernes to support them, but that they had not conceded enough to him. Although the envoys were angered at the audacity of the Persian demands, they nevertheless departed with the impression that Alcibiades could have brought about an agreement among the powers if he had chosen to do so.<sup id="_ref-Th8.56_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.56" title="">[56]</a></sup> This <a href="/wiki/Fiasco" id="w">fiasco</a> at the court of Tissaphernes, however, put an end to the negotiations between the conspirators and Alcibiades.<sup id="_ref-Kagan136-138_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kagan136-138" title="">[54]</a></sup> The group was convinced that Alcibiades could not deliver his side of the bargain without demanding exorbitantly high concessions of them and they accordingly abandoned their plans to restore him to Athens.<sup id="_ref-Th8.56_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.56" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reinstatement_as_an_Athenian_General" name="Reinstatement_as_an_Athenian_General"></a><h3>Reinstatement as an Athenian General</h3>
<p>{{seealso}}</p>
<p>In spite of the failure of the negotiations, the conspirators succeeded in overthrowing the democracy and imposing the oligarchic government of the <a href="/wiki/The_Four_Hundred_(oligarchy)" id="w">Four Hundred</a>, among the leaders of which were Phrynichus and Pisander. At Samos, however, a similar coup instigated by the conspirators did not go forward so smoothly. Samian democrats learned of the conspiracy and notified four prominent Athenians: the generals Leon and Diomedon, the <a href="/wiki/Trierarch" id="w">trierarch</a> Thrasybulus, and Thrasyllus, at that time a <a href="/wiki/Hoplite" id="w">hoplite</a> in the ranks. With the support of these men and the Athenian soldiers in general, the Samian democrats were able to defeat the 300 Samian oligarchs who attempted to seize power there.<sup id="_ref-Th8.73_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.73" title="">[57]</a></sup> Further, the Athenian troops at Samos formed themselves into a political assembly, deposed their generals, and elected new ones, including Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. The army, stating that they had not revolted from the city but that the city had revolted from them, resolved to stand by the democracy while continuing to prosecute the war against Sparta.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>After a time, Thrasybulus persuaded the assembled troops to vote Alcibiades&#39; recall, a policy that he had supported since before the coup. Then he sailed to retrieve Alcibiades and returned with him to Samos. The aim of this policy was to win away Persian support from the Spartans, as it was still believed that Alcibiades had great influence with Tissaphernes.<sup id="_ref-Th8.81_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.81" title="">[59]</a></sup> Plutarch claims that the army sent for Alcibiades so as to use his help in putting down the tyrants in Athens.<sup id="_ref-Alcibiades26_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alcibiades26" title="">[60]</a></sup> Kagan argues that this reinstatement was a disappointment to Alcibiades, who had hoped for a glorious return to Athens itself but found himself only restored to the rebellious fleet, where the immunity from prosecution he had been granted &#34;protected him for the time being but not from a reckoning in the future&#34;; furthermore, the recall, which Alcibiades had hoped to bring about through his own prestige and perceived influence, was achieved through the patronage of Thrasybulus.<sup id="_ref-Kagan389_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kagan389" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>At his first speech to the assembled troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about the circumstances of his exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives of his speech were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of him and to increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon hearing his speech the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused them so much that they proposed to sail at once for <a href="/wiki/Piraeus" id="w">Piraeus</a> and attack the oligarchs in Athens.<sup id="_ref-Th8.82_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.82" title="">[62]</a></sup> It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the folly of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led to the immediate defeat of Athens.<sup id="_ref-Alcibiades26_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alcibiades26" title="">[60]</a></sup> Shortly after Alcibiades&#39; reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>Presently Alcibiades sailed to Tissaphernes with a detachment of ships. According to Plutarch, the supposed purpose of this mission was to stop the Persian fleet from coming to the aid of the Peloponnesians.<sup id="_ref-Alcibiades26_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alcibiades26" title="">[60]</a></sup> Thucydides is in agreement with Plutarch that the Persian fleet was at <a href="/wiki/Aspendus" id="w">Aspendus</a> and that Alcibiades told the troops he would bring the fleet to their side or prevent it from coming at all, but Thucydides further speculates that the real reason was to flaunt his new position to Tissaphernes and try to gain some real influence over him.<sup id="_ref-Th8.82_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.82" title="">[62]</a></sup> According to the historian, Alcibiades had long known that Tissaphernes never meant to bring the fleet at all.<sup id="_ref-Th8.88_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th8.88" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>

<p>Alcibiades was recalled by the &#34;intermediate regime&#34; of The Five Thousand, the government which succeeded the Four Hundred in 411, but it is most likely that he waited until <a href="/wiki/407_BC" id="w">407 BC</a> to actually return to the city.<sup id="_ref-Cartwright301_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cartwright301" title="">[65]</a></sup> Plutarch tells us that, although his recall had already been passed on motion of <a href="/wiki/Critias" id="w">Critias</a>, a political ally of his, Alcibiades was resolved to come back with glory.<sup id="_ref-Pl27_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl27" title="">[66]</a></sup> While this was certainly his goal, it was again means to an end, that end being avoiding prosecution upon his return to Athens.</p> 
<p>The next significant part he would play in the war would occur at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Abydos" id="w">Battle of Abydos</a>. Alcibiades had remained behind at Samos with small force while Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus led the greater part of the fleet to the <a href="/wiki/Hellespont" id="w">Hellespont</a>. During this period, Alcibiades succeeded in raising money from <a href="/wiki/Caria" id="w">Caria</a> and the neighboring area, with which he was able to pay the rowers and gain their favor.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> After the Athenian victory at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Cynossema" id="w">Cynossema</a>, both fleets summoned all their ships from around the Aegean to join them for what might be a decisive next engagement. 
While Alcibiades was still en route, the two fleets clashed at <a href="/wiki/Abydos%2C_Hellespont" id="w">Abydos</a>, where the Peloponnesians had set up their main naval base. The battle was evenly matched, and raged for a long time, but the balance tipped towards the Athenians when Alcibiades sailed into the Hellespont with eighteen triremes.<sup id="_ref-Pl27_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl27" title="">[66]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Hellenica1.4.1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hellenica1.4.1" title="">[68]</a></sup> The Persian satrap <a href="/wiki/Pharnabazus" id="w">Pharnabazus</a>, who had replaced Tissaphernes as the sponsor of the Peloponnesian fleet, moved his land army to the shore to defend the ships and sailors who had beached their ships. Only the support of the Persian land army and the coming of night saved the Peloponnesian fleet from complete destruction.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after the battle, Tissaphernes had arrived in the Hellespont and Alcibiades left the fleet at Sestos to meet him, bringing gifts and hoping to once again try to win over the Persian governor. Evidently Alcibiades had gravely misjudged his standing with the satrap, and he was arrested on arrival.<sup id="_ref-Pl27_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl27" title="">[66]</a></sup> Within a month he would escape and resume command.<sup id="_ref-Pl28_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl28" title="">[70]</a></sup> It was now obvious, however, that he had no influence with the Persians; from now on his authority would depend on what he actually could accomplish rather than on what he promised to do.<sup id="_ref-Kagan410_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kagan410" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p>After an interlude of several months in which the Peloponnesians constructed new ships and the Athenians besieged cities and raised money throughout the Aegean, the next major sea battle took place the spring of 410 BC at <a href="/wiki/Cyzicus" id="w">Cyzicus</a>. Alcibiades had been forced to flee from <a href="/wiki/Sestos" id="w">Sestos</a> to <a href="/wiki/Cardia" id="w">Cardia</a> to protect his small fleet from the rebuilt Peloponnesian navy, but as soon as the Athenian fleet was reunited there its commanders led it to Cyzicus, where the Athenians had intelligence indicating that Pharnabazus and <a href="/wiki/Mindarus" id="w">Mindarus</a>, the Peloponnesian fleet commander, were together plotting their next move. Concealed by storm and darkness, the combined Athenian force reached the vicinity without being spotted by the Peloponnesians.<sup id="_ref-Pl28_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl28" title="">[70]</a></sup> Here the Athenians devised a plot to draw the enemy into battle. According to <a href="/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus" id="w">Diodorus Siculus</a>, Alcibiades advanced with a small squadron in order to draw the Spartans out to battle, and, after he successfully deceived Mindarus with this ploy, the squadrons of Thrasybulus and Theramenes came to join him, cutting off the Spartan&#39;s retreat.{{Cref}}<sup id="_ref-Diodorus74_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Diodorus74" title="">[72]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Spartan fleet suffered losses in the flight, and reached the shore with the Athenians in close pursuit. Alcibiades&#39;s troops, leading the Athenian pursuit, landed and attempted to pull the Spartan ships back out to sea. The Peloponnesians fought to prevent their ships from being towed away, and Pharnabazus&#39;s troops came up to support them.<sup id="_ref-Hellenica1.17_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hellenica1.17" title="">[73]</a></sup> Thrasybulus landed his own force to temporarily relieve pressure on Alcibiades, and meanwhile ordered <a href="/wiki/Theramenes" id="w">Theramenes</a> to join up with Athenian land forces nearby and bring them to reinforce the sailors and marines on the beach.

<p>It was in the aftermath of these successes that Alcibiades resolved to finally return to Athens in the spring of 407 BC. Even in the wake of his recent victories, Alcibiades was exceedingly careful in his return, mindful of the changes in government, the charges still technically hanging over him, and the great injury he had done to Athens. Thus Alcibiades, instead of going straight home, he first went to Samos to pick up 20 ships and proceeded with them to the <a href="/wiki/Ceramic_Gulf" id="w">Ceramic Gulf</a> where he collected 100 talents. He finally sailed to <a href="/wiki/Gytheion" id="w">Gytheion</a> to make inquiries, partly about the reported preparations of the Spartans there, and partly about the feelings in Athens about his return.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> His inquiries assured him that the city was kindly disposed towards him and that his closest friends urged him to return.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup></p> 
<p>Therefore he finally sailed into Piraeus where the crowd had gathered, desiring to see the famous Alcibiades.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup> He entered the harbor full of fear till he saw his cousin and others of his friends and acquaintance, who invited him to land. Upon arriving on shore he was greeted with a hero&#39;s welcome.<sup id="_ref-Pl32_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl32" title="">[83]</a></sup> Nevertheless, some saw an evil <a href="/wiki/Omen" id="w">omen</a> in the fact that he had returned to Athens on the very day when the ceremony of the <a href="/wiki/Plynteria" id="w">Plynteria</a> (the feast where the old statue of <a href="/wiki/Athena" id="w">Athena</a> would get cleansed) were being celebrated.<sup id="_ref-Pl34_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl34" title="">[84]</a></sup> This was regarded as the unluckiest day of the year to undertake anything of importance.  His enemies took note of this and kept it in mind for a future occasion.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>All the criminal proceedings against him were canceled and the charges of <a href="/wiki/Blasphemy" id="w">blasphemy</a> were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to <a href="/wiki/Eleusis" id="w">Eleusis</a> (for the celebration of the Eleusinian Mysteries) by land for the first time since the Spartans had occupied Decelea.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> The procession had been replaced by a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup> His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him General (Strategos) with sole powers by land and sea.<sup id="_ref-Pl33_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl33" title="">[88]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Defeat_at_Notium" name="Defeat_at_Notium"></a><h3>Defeat at Notium </h3>
<p>{{details}}
In <a href="/wiki/406_BC" id="w">406 BC</a> Alcibiades set out from Athens with 1,500 hoplites and a hundred ships. He failed to take <a href="/wiki/Andros" id="w">Andros</a> and then he went on to Samos. Later he moved to <a href="/wiki/Notium" id="w">Notium</a>, closer to the enemy at <a href="/wiki/Ephesus" id="w">Ephesus</a>.<sup id="_ref-Andrews490_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Andrews490" title="">[89]</a></sup> In the meanwhile Tissaphernes had been replaced by Cyrus (a relative of <a href="/wiki/Darius_II_of_Persia" id="w">Darius II of Persia</a>) who decided to financially support the Peloponnesians. This new revenue started to attract Athenian deserters to the Spartan navy. Additionally the Spartans had replaced Mindarus with <a href="/wiki/Lysander" id="w">Lysander</a>, a very capable Admiral. These factors caused the rapid growth of the Peloponnesian fleet at the expense of the Athenian. In search of funds and needing to force another decisive battle, Alcibiades left Notium and sailed to help Thrasybulus in the siege of <a href="/wiki/Phocaea" id="w">Phocaea</a>.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup> Alcibiades was aware the Spartan fleet was nearby, so he left nearly eighty ships to watch them under the command of his personal helmsman Antiochus, who was given express orders not to attack. Antiochus disobeyed this single order and endeavored to draw Lysander into a fight by imitating the tactics used at Cyzicus. The situation at Notium, however, was radically different than that at Cyzicus; the Athenians possessed no element of surprise, and Lysander had been well informed about their fleet by deserters.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup> Antiochus&#39;s ship was sunk, and he was killed by a sudden Spartan attack; the remaining ships of the decoy force were then chased headlong back toward Notium, where the main Athenian force was caught unprepared by the sudden arrival of the whole Spartan fleet. In the ensuing fighting, Lysander gained an entire victory. Alcibiades soon returned and desperately tried to undo the defeat at Notium by scoring another victory, but Lysander could not be compelled to attack the fleet again.<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p>Responsibility for the defeat ultimately fell on Alcibiades, and his enemies used the opportunity to attack him and have him removed from command, although some modern scholars believe that Alcibiades was unfairly blamed for Antiochus&#39; mistake.<sup id="_ref-Cawkell_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cawkell" title="">[93]</a></sup> Diodorus reports that, in addition to his mistake at Notium, Alcibiades was discharged on account of false accusations brought against him by his enemies.<sup id="_ref-Diodorus74_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Diodorus74" title="">[72]</a></sup> According to Anthony Andrewes, professor of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_history" id="w">ancient history</a>, the extravagant hopes that his successes of the previous summer had created were a decisive element in his downfall.<sup id="_ref-Andrews490_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Andrews490" title="">[89]</a></sup> Consequently Alcibiades condemned himself to exile.<sup id="_ref-Diodorus74_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Diodorus74" title="">[72]</a></sup> Never again returning to Athens, he sailed north to the castles in the Thracian Chersonese, which he had secured during his time in the Hellespont. The implications of the defeat were severe for Athens. Although the defeat had been minor, it occasioned the removal of not only Alcibiades but also his allies like Thrasybulus, Theramenes and Critias.<sup id="_ref-Pl33_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl33" title="">[88]</a></sup> These were likely the most capable commanders Athens had at the time and their removal would help lead to the Athenian surrender only two years later after their complete defeat at <a href="/wiki/Aegospotami" id="w">Aegospotami</a>.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup></p>

<p>With one exception, Alcibiades&#39; role in the war ended with his command. Prior to the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Aegospotami" id="w">Battle of Aegospotami</a>, in the last attested fact of his career,<sup id="_ref-Perrin25-37_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Perrin25-37" title="">[95]</a></sup> Alcibiades recognized that the Athenians were anchored in a tactically disadvantageous spot and advised them to move to <a href="/wiki/Sestus" id="w">Sestus</a> where they could benefit from a harbor and a city.<sup id="_ref-Hellenica2.1.25_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hellenica2.1.25" title="">[96]</a></sup> Diodorus, however, does not mention this advice, arguing instead that Alcibiades offered the Generals Thracian aid in exchange for a share in the command.{{Cref}} In any case, the Generals of the Athenians, &#34;considering that in case of defeat the blame would attach to them and that in case of success all men would attribute it to Alcibiades&#34;, asked him to leave and not come near the camp ever again.<sup id="_ref-Hellenica2.1.25_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hellenica2.1.25" title="">[96]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Diodorus105_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Diodorus105" title="">[97]</a></sup> Days later the fleet would be annihilated by Lysander.  </p> 
<p>After the Battle of Aegospotami, Alcibiades crossed the Hellespont and took refuge in <a href="/wiki/Phrygia" id="w">Phrygia</a>, with the object of securing the aid of <a href="/wiki/Artaxerxes" id="w">Artaxerxes</a> against Sparta.</p>
<p>Much about Alcibiades&#39; death is now uncertain, as there are conflicting accounts.

<a id="Political_Career" name="Political_Career"></a><h3>Political Career</h3>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" id="w">ancient Greece</a>, Alcibiades was a polarizing figure. Thucydides reprehends the Athenian statesman for his political conduct and motives. According to the historian, Alcibiades, being &#34;exceedingly ambitious&#34;, proposed the expedition in Sicily in order &#34;to gain in wealth and reputation by means of his successes&#34;. Alcibiades is held responsible by Thucydides for the destruction of Athens, since &#34;his habits gave offence to every one, and caused them to commit affairs to other hands, and thus before long to ruin the city&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Th6.15_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th6.15" title="">[101]</a></sup> Plutarch regards him as &#34;the least scrupulous and most entirely careless of human beings&#34;.<sup id="_ref-PlCom6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PlCom6" title="">[102]</a></sup> On the other hand, <a href="/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus" id="w">Diodorus</a> argues that he was &#34;in spirit brilliant and intent upon great enterprises&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Diodorus68_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Diodorus68" title="">[103]</a></sup> Sharon Press of <a href="/wiki/Brown_University" id="w">Brown University</a> points out that <a href="/wiki/Xenophon" id="w">Xenophon</a> emphasizes Alcibiades&#39; service to the state, rather than the harm he was charged with causing it.<sup id="_ref-Press_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Press" title="">[104]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Hellenica1.4.18_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hellenica1.4.18" title="">[105]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Demosthenes" id="w">Demosthenes</a> defends Alcibiades&#39;s achievements, saying that he had taken arms in the cause of democracy, displaying his patriotism, not by gifts of money or by speeches, but by personal service.<sup id="_ref-Meidias144-145_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meidias144-145" title="">[106]</a></sup> For Demosthenes and other orators, Alcibiades epitomized the figure of the great man during the glorious days of the <a href="/wiki/Athenian_democracy" id="w">Athenian democracy</a> and became a rhetorical symbol.<sup id="_ref-Gribble32_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gribble32" title="">[107]</a></sup> One of <a href="/wiki/Isocrates" id="w">Isocrates</a>&#39; speeches, delivered by the son of Alcibiades, argues that the statesman deserved the Athenians&#39; gratitude for the service he had given them.<sup id="_ref-Isocrates_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Isocrates" title="">[108]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Lysias" id="w">Lysias</a>, on the other hand, argued in one of his orations that the Athenians should regard Alcibiades as an enemy because of the general tenor of his life, as &#34;he repays with injury the open assistance of any of his friends&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Lysias_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lysias" title="">[109]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Lysias2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lysias2" title="">[110]</a></sup> In the <i><a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Athenians" id="w">Constitution of the Athenians</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" id="w">Aristotle</a> does not include Alcibiades in the list of the best Athenian politicians, but in <i><a href="/wiki/Posterior_Analytics" id="w">Posterior Analytics</a></i> he argues that traits of a proud man like Alcibiades are &#34;equanimity amid the vicissitudes of life and impatience of dishonor&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Con28_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Con28" title="">[111]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Ar13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ar13" title="">[112]</a></sup> Alcibiades excited in his contemporaries a fear for the safety of the political order.<sup id="_ref-Gribble41_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gribble41" title="">[113]</a></sup> Therefore, <a href="/wiki/Andocides" id="w">Andocides</a> said of him that &#34;instead of holding that he ought himself to conform with the laws of the state, he expects you to conform with his own way of life&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Andocides19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Andocides19" title="">[114]</a></sup> Central to the depiction of the Athenian statesman is <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Nepos" id="w">Cornelius Nepos</a>&#39; famous phrase that Alcibiades &#34;surpassed all the Athenians in grandeur and magnificence of living&#34;.<sup id="_ref-NeposXI_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NeposXI" title="">[115]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even today, Alcibiades divides scholars. For Malcolm F.
