<p><b>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</b> (<a href="/wiki/Bengali_language" id="w">Bangla</a>: শেখ মুজিবর রহমান <i>Shekh Mujibur Rôhman</i>) (<a href="/wiki/March_17" id="w">March 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a> – <a href="/wiki/August_15" id="w">August 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Bengali_people" id="w">Bengali</a> political leader in <a href="/wiki/East_Pakistan" id="w">East Pakistan</a> and the founding leader of <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh" id="w">Bangladesh</a>. He headed the <a href="/wiki/Awami_League" id="w">Awami League</a>, served as the first <a href="/wiki/President_of_Bangladesh" id="w">President of Bangladesh</a> and later became its <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Bangladesh" id="w">Prime Minister</a>. He is popularly referred to as <b>Sheikh Mujib</b>, and with the honorary title of <b>Bangabandhu</b> (বঙ্গবন্ধু <i>Bôngobondhu</i>, &#34;Friend of Bengal&#34;). His eldest daughter <a href="/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina_Wajed" id="w">Sheikh Hasina Wajed</a> is the present leader of the Awami League and a former prime minister of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>A student political leader, Mujib rose in East Pakistani politics and within the ranks of the Awami League as a charismatic and forceful orator. An advocate of <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialism</a>, Mujib became popular for his leadership against the ethnic and institutional discrimination of Bengalis. He demanded increased provincial autonomy, and became a fierce opponent of the military rule of <a href="/wiki/Ayub_Khan" id="w">Ayub Khan</a>. At the heightening of sectional tensions, Mujib outlined a <a href="/wiki/Six_point_movement" id="w">6-point autonomy plan</a>, which was seen as separatism in <a href="/wiki/West_Pakistan" id="w">West Pakistan</a>. He was tried in 1968 for allegedly conspiring with the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_India" id="w">Indian government</a> but was not found guilty. Despite leading his party to a major victory in the 1970 elections, Mujib was not invited to form the government.</p>
<p>After talks broke down with President <a href="/wiki/Yahya_Khan" id="w">Yahya Khan</a> and West Pakistani politician <a href="/wiki/Zulfikar_Ali_Bhutto" id="w">Zulfikar Ali Bhutto</a>, Mujib was arrested and a <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War" id="w">guerrilla war</a> erupted between government forces and Bengali nationalists aided by India. An all out war between the Pakistan Army and Bangladesh-India Joint Forces led to the establishment of Bangladesh, and after his release Mujib assumed office as a provisional president, and later prime minister. Even as a constitution was adopted, proclaiming socialism and a secular democracy, Mujib struggled to address the challenges of intense poverty and unemployment, coupled with rampant corruption. Amidst rising popular agitation, he banned other political parties and declared himself president for life in 1975. After only seven months, Mujib was <a href="/wiki/Assassination_of_Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman" id="w">assassinated</a> along with his family by a group of army officers.</p>

<b>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</b> was born in <a href="/wiki/Tungipara_Upazila" id="w">Tungipara</a>, a village in <a href="/wiki/Gopalganj_District_(Bangladesh)" id="w">Gopalganj District</a> in the province of <a href="/wiki/Bengal" id="w">Bengal</a>,<sup id="_ref-REF_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-REF" title="">[1]</a></sup> to Sheikh Lutfar Rahman, a <i><a href="/wiki/Serestadar" id="w">serestadar</a></i>, or officer responsible for record-keeping at the Gopalganj civil court. He was the third child in a family of four daughters and two sons. Mujib was educated at the Gopalganj Public School and later transferred to the Gopalganj Missionary School, from where he completed his <a href="/wiki/Matriculation" id="w">matriculation</a>. However, Mujib was withdrawn from school in 1934 to undergo eye surgery, and returned to school only after four years, owing to the severity of the surgery and slow recovery. At the age of eighteen, Mujib married Begum Fazilatnnesa. She gave birth to their two daughters — <a href="/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina" id="w">Sheikh Hasina</a> and Sheikh Rehana — and three sons — <a href="/wiki/Sheikh_Kamal" id="w">Sheikh Kamal</a>, Sheikh Jamal and Sheikh Russel.<sup id="_ref-BAL_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BAL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mujib became politically active when he joined the <a href="/wiki/All_India_Muslim_Students_Federation" id="w">All India Muslim Students Federation</a> in 1940. He enrolled at the <a href="/wiki/Maulana_Azad_College" id="w">Islamia College</a> (now Maulana Azad College), a well-respected college affiliated to the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Calcutta" id="w">University of Calcutta</a> in <a href="/wiki/Kolkata" id="w">Kolkata</a> to study law and entered student politics there. He joined the <a href="/wiki/All_India_Muslim_League" id="w">Bengal Muslim League</a> in 1943 and grew close to the faction led by <a href="/wiki/Huseyn_Shaheed_Suhrawardy" id="w">Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy</a>, a leading Bengali Muslim leader. During this period, Mujib worked actively for the League&#39;s cause of a separate <a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Muslim</a> state of <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a> and in 1946 he was elected general secretary of the Islamia College Students Union. After obtaining his degree in 1947, Mujib was one of the Muslim politicians working under <a href="/wiki/Huseyn_Shaheed_Suhrawardy" id="w">Suhrawardy</a> during the communal violence that broke out in Calcutta, in 1946, just before the <a href="/wiki/Partition_of_India" id="w">partition of India</a>.<sup id="_ref-BAL_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BAL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>On his return to <a href="/wiki/East_Bengal" id="w">East Bengal</a>, he enrolled in the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Dhaka" id="w">University of Dhaka</a> to study law and founded the <a href="/wiki/East_Pakistan_Muslim_Students%26%2339%3B_League" id="w">East Pakistan Muslim Students&#39; League</a> and became one of the most prominent student political leaders in the province. During these years, Mujib developed an affinity for <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialism</a> as the ideal solution to mass poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions. On <a href="/wiki/January_26" id="w">January 26</a> <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a> the government announced that <a href="/wiki/Urdu" id="w">Urdu</a> would officially be the <a href="/wiki/Official_language" id="w">state language</a> of Pakistan. Though still in jail, Mujib encouraged fellow activist groups to launch strikes and protests and undertook a <a href="/wiki/Hunger_strike" id="w">hunger strike</a> for 13 days. Following the declaration of <a href="/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah" id="w">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a> and the province chief minister <a href="/wiki/Khwaja_Nazimuddin" id="w">Khwaja Nazimuddin</a> in 1948 that the people of <a href="/wiki/East_Pakistan" id="w">East Pakistan</a>, mainly Bengalis, would have to adopt Urdu as the state language, agitation broke out amongst the population. Mujib led the Muslim Students League in organising strikes and protests, and was arrested along with his colleagues by police on <a href="/wiki/March_11" id="w">March 11</a>.<sup id="_ref-BAL_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BAL" title="">[2]</a></sup> The outcry of students and political activists led to the immediate release of Mujib and the others. Mujib was expelled from the university and arrested again in 1949 for attempting to organize the menial and clerical staff in an agitation over workers&#39; rights.<sup id="_ref-REF_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-REF" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Mujib launched his political career, leaving the Muslim League to join Suhrawardy and <a href="/wiki/Maulana_Bhashani" id="w">Maulana Bhashani</a> in the formation of the <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh_Awami_League" id="w">Awami Muslim League</a>, the predecessor of the <a href="/wiki/Awami_League" id="w">Awami League</a>. He was elected joint secretary of its East Pakistan unit in 1949. While Suhrawardy worked to build a larger coalition of East Pakistani and socialist parties, Mujib focused on expanding the grassroots organisation. In 1951, Mujib began organising protests and rallies in response to the killings by police of students who had been protesting against the declaration of Urdu as the sole national language. This period of turmoil, later to be known as the <a href="/wiki/Bengali_Language_Movement" id="w">Bengali Language Movement</a>, saw Mujib and many other Bengali politicians arrested. In 1953, he was made the party&#39;s general secretary, and elected to the <a href="/wiki/East_Bengal_Legislative_Assembly" id="w">East Bengal Legislative Assembly</a> on a <a href="/wiki/United_Front_(East_Pakistan)" id="w">United Front</a> coalition ticket in 1954. Serving briefly as the minister for <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" id="w">agriculture</a>, Mujib was briefly arrested for organizing a protest of the central government&#39;s decision to dismiss the United Front ministry. He was elected to the second <a href="/wiki/Constituent_Assembly_of_Pakistan" id="w">Constituent Assembly of Pakistan</a> and served from 1955 to 1958.<sup id="_ref-REF_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-REF" title="">[1]</a></sup> During a speech in the assembly on the proposed plan to dissolve the <a href="/wiki/Historical_regions_of_Pakistan" id="w">provinces</a> in favour of an amalgamated West Pakistan and East Pakistan with a powerful central government, Mujib demanded that the Bengali people&#39;s ethnic identity be respected and that a popular verdict should decide the question:</p>
<p /><blockquote>&#34;Sir [President of the Constituent Assembly], you will see that they want to place the word &#34;East Pakistan&#34; instead of &#34;East Bengal.&#34; We had demanded so many times that you should use Bengal instead of Pakistan. The word &#34;Bengal&#34; has a history, has a tradition of its own. You can change it only after the people have been consulted. So far as the question of one unit is concerned it can come in the constitution. Why do you want it to be taken up just now? What about the state language, <a href="/wiki/Bengali_language" id="w">Bengali</a>? We will be prepared to consider one-unit with all these things. So I appeal to my friends on that side to allow the people to give their verdict in any way, in the form of <a href="/wiki/Referendum" id="w">referendum</a> or in the form of <a href="/wiki/Plebiscite" id="w">plebiscite</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-BAL_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BAL" title="">[2]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>In 1956, Mujib entered a second coalition government as minister of industries, commerce, labour, anti-corruption and village aid, but resigned in 1957 to work full-time for the party organization. When General <a href="/wiki/Ayub_Khan" id="w">Ayub Khan</a> suspended the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan" id="w">constitution</a> and imposed <a href="/wiki/Martial_law" id="w">martial law</a> in 1958, Mujib was arrested for organising resistance and imprisoned till 1961.<sup id="_ref-REF_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-REF" title="">[1]</a></sup> After his release from prison, Mujib started organising an underground political body called the <a href="/wiki/Swadhin_Bangal_Biplobi_Parishad" id="w">Swadhin Bangal Biplobi Parishad</a> (<i>Free Bangla Revolutionary Council</i>), comprising student leaders in order to oppose the regime of Ayub Khan and to work for increased political power for Bengalis and the independence of East Pakistan. He was briefly arrested again in 1962 for organising protests.<sup id="_ref-BAL_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BAL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

Following Suhrawardy&#39;s death in 1963, Mujib came to head the Awami League, which became one of the largest political parties in Pakistan.<sup id="_ref-POLY_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-POLY" title="">[3]</a></sup> The party had dropped the word &#34;Muslim&#34; from its name in a shift towards <a href="/wiki/Secularism" id="w">secularism</a> and a broader appeal to non-Muslim communities. Mujib was one of the key leaders to rally opposition to President Ayub Khan&#39;s <i>Basic Democracies</i> plan, the imposition of martial law and the one-unit scheme, which centralized power and merged the provinces.<sup id="_ref-JSTOR2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JSTOR2" title="">[4]</a></sup> Working with other political parties, he supported opposition candidate <a href="/wiki/Fatima_Jinnah" id="w">Fatima Jinnah</a> against Ayub Khan in the 1964 <a href="/wiki/Elections_in_Pakistan" id="w">election</a>. Mujib was arrested two weeks before the election, charged with <a href="/wiki/Sedition" id="w">sedition</a> and jailed for a year.<sup id="_ref-BAL_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BAL" title="">[2]</a></sup> In these years, there was rising discontent in East Pakistan over the atrocities committed by the <a href="/wiki/Military_of_Pakistan" id="w">military</a> against Bengalis and the neglect of the issues and needs of East Pakistan by the ruling regime.<sup id="_ref-CHOU_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CHOU" title="">[5]</a></sup> Despite forming a majority of the population, the Bengalis were poorly represented in Pakistan&#39;s civil services, police and military. There were also conflicts between the allocation of revenues and taxation.</p>
<p>Unrest over continuing denial of democracy spread across Pakistan and Mujib intensified his opposition to the disbandment of provinces. In 1966, Mujib proclaimed a 6-point plan titled <i>Our Charter of Survival</i> at a national conference of opposition political parties at <a href="/wiki/Lahore" id="w">Lahore</a>,<sup id="_ref-REF_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-REF" title="">[1]</a></sup> in which he demanded self-government and considerable political, economic and defence autonomy for East Pakistan in a Pakistani <a href="/wiki/Federation" id="w">federation</a> with a weak central government.<sup id="_ref-JSTOR2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JSTOR2" title="">[4]</a></sup> According to his plan: 
</p><blockquote>

<ol>
<li>The constitution should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true sense on the <a href="/wiki/Lahore_Resolution" id="w">Lahore Resolution</a> and the parliamentary form of government with supremacy of a legislature directly elected on the basis of universal adult franchise.</li>
<li>The federal government should deal with only two subjects: <a href="/wiki/Defense_(military)" id="w">defence</a> and <a href="/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Pakistan" id="w">foreign affairs</a>, and all other residuary subjects shall be vested in the federating states.</li>
<li>Two separate, but freely convertible <a href="/wiki/Paisa" id="w">currencies</a> for two wings should be introduced; or if this is not feasible, there should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions should be introduced to stop the flight of capital from East to West Pakistan. Furthermore, a separate <a href="/wiki/Bank_reserves" id="w">banking reserve</a> should be established and separate <a href="/wiki/Fiscal_policy" id="w">fiscal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Monetary_policy" id="w">monetary policy</a> be adopted for East Pakistan.</li>
<li>The power of <a href="/wiki/Tax" id="w">taxation</a> and revenue collection shall be vested in the federating units and the federal centre will have no such power. The federation will be entitled to a share in the state taxes to meet its expenditures.</li>
<li>There should be two separate accounts for the <a href="/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market" id="w">foreign exchange</a> earnings of the two wings; the foreign exchange requirements of the federal government should be met by the two wings equally or in a ratio to be fixed; indigenous products should move free of <a href="/wiki/Duty_(economics)" id="w">duty</a> between the two wings, and the constitution should empower the units to establish trade links with foreign countries.</li>
<li>East Pakistan should have a separate militia or paramilitary forces.</li></ol>

Mujib&#39;s points catalysed public support across East Pakistan, launching what some historians have termed the <i><a href="/wiki/Six_point_movement" id="w">6 point movement</a></i> — recognized as the definitive gambit for autonomy and rights of Bengalis in Pakistan. Mujib obtained the broad support of Bengalis, including the <a href="/wiki/Hinduism_in_Pakistan" id="w">Hindu</a> and other religious communities in East Pakistan. However, his demands were considered radical in West Pakistan and interpreted as thinly-veiled <a href="/wiki/Separatism" id="w">separatism</a>. The proposals alienated West Pakistani people and politicians, as well as non-Bengalis and Muslim fundamentalists in East Pakistan.

Mujib was arrested by the army and after two years in jail, an official sedition trial in a military court opened. Widely known as the <a href="/wiki/Agartala_Conspiracy_Case" id="w">Agartala Conspiracy Case</a>, Mujib and 34 Bengali military officers were accused by the government of colluding with Indian government agents in a scheme to divide Pakistan and threaten its unity, order and national security. The plot was alleged to have been planned in the city of <a href="/wiki/Agartala" id="w">Agartala</a>, in the Indian state of <a href="/wiki/Tripura" id="w">Tripura</a>.<sup id="_ref-REF_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-REF" title="">[1]</a></sup> The outcry and unrest over Mujib&#39;s arrest and the charge of sedition against him destabilised East Pakistan amidst large protests and strikes. Various Bengali political and student groups added demands to address the issues of students, workers and the poor, forming a larger &#34;11-point plan.&#34; The government caved to the mounting pressure, dropped the charged and unconditionally released Mujib. He returned to East Pakistan as a public hero.

Joining an all-parties conference convened by Ayub Khan in 1969, Mujib demanded the acceptance of his six points and the demands of other political parties and walked out following its rejection. On <a href="/wiki/December_5" id="w">December 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a> Mujib made a declaration at a public meeting held to observe the death anniversary of Suhrawardy that henceforth East Pakistan would be called &#34;Bangladesh&#34;:

</p><blockquote>&#34;There was a time when all efforts were made to erase the word &#34;Bangla&#34; from this land and its map. The existence of the word &#34;Bangla&#34; was found nowhere except in the term <a href="/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal" id="w">Bay of Bengal</a>. I on behalf of Pakistan announce today that this land will be called &#34;Bangladesh&#34; instead of East Pakistan.&#34;<sup id="_ref-BAL_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BAL" title="">[2]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Mujib&#39;s declaration heightened tensions across the country. The West Pakistani politicians and the military began to see him as a separatist leader. His assertion of Bengali cultural and ethnic identity also re-defined the debate over regional autonomy. Many scholars and observers believed the Bengali agitation emphasized the rejection of the <i><a href="/wiki/Two-Nation_Theory" id="w">Two-Nation Theory</a></i> — the case upon which Pakistan had been created — by asserting the ethno-cultural identity of Bengalis as a nation.<sup id="_ref-GPSA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GPSA" title="">[6]</a></sup> Mujib was able to galvanise support throughout East Pakistan, which was home to a majority of the national population, thus making him one of the most powerful political figures in the <a href="/wiki/Indian_subcontinent" id="w">Indian subcontinent</a>. It was following his 6-point plan that Mujib was increasingly referred to by his supporters as &#34;Bangabandhu&#34; (literally meaning <i>&#34;Friend of Bengal&#34;</i> in <a href="/wiki/Bengali_language" id="w">Bengali</a>).

A <a href="/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone" id="w">major coastal cyclone</a> struck East Pakistan in 1970, leaving hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced. The subsequent period exposed extreme outrage and unrest over the perceived weak and ineffective response of the central government. Public opinion and political parties in East Pakistan blamed the governing authorities as intentionally negligent. The West Pakistani politicians attacked the Awami League for allegedly using the crisis for political gain. The dissatisfaction led to divisions within the civil services, police and military of Pakistan. In the <a href="/wiki/Pakistani_general_election%2C_1970" id="w">elections held</a> in December 1970, the Awami League under Mujib&#39;s leadership won a massive majority in the provincial legislature, and all but 2 of East Pakistan&#39;s quota of seats in the new <a href="/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Pakistan" id="w">National Assembly</a>, thus forming a clear majority.<sup id="_ref-REF_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-REF" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The election result revealed a polarisation between the two wings of Pakistan, with the largest and most successful party in the West being the <a href="/wiki/Pakistan_Peoples_Party" id="w">Pakistan Peoples Party</a> of <a href="/wiki/Zulfikar_Ali_Bhutto" id="w">Zulfikar Ali Bhutto</a>, who was completely opposed to Mujib&#39;s demand for greater autonomy. Bhutto threatened to boycott the assembly and oppose the government if Mujib was invited by <a href="/wiki/Yahya_Khan" id="w">Yahya Khan</a> (then president of Pakistan) to form the next government, demanding his party&#39;s inclusion. There was also widespread opposition in the Pakistani military and the Islamic political parties to Mujib becoming Pakistan&#39;s prime minister. And even though neither Mujib nor the League had explicitly advocated political independence for East Pakistan, smaller nationalist groups were demanding independence for <i>Bangladesh</i>.</p>
<p>Following political deadlock, Yahya Khan delayed the convening of the assembly — a move seen by Bengalis as a plan to deny Mujib&#39;s party, which formed a majority, from taking charge.<sup id="_ref-POLY_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-POLY" title="">[3]</a></sup> It was on <a href="/wiki/March_7" id="w">March 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1971" id="w">1971</a> that Mujib called for independence and asked the people to launch a major campaign of <a href="/wiki/Civil_disobedience" id="w">civil disobedience</a> and organised armed resistance at a mass gathering of people held at the <a href="/wiki/Suhrawardy_Udyan" id="w">Race Course Ground</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dhaka" id="w">Dhaka</a>.</p>
<p /><blockquote>&#34;The struggle now is the struggle for our emancipation; the struggle now is the struggle for our independence. Joy Bangla!..Since we have given blood, we will give more blood. God-willing, the people of this country will be liberated...Turn every house into a fort. Face (the enemy) with whatever you have.&#34;</blockquote>

<p>Following a last ditch attempt to foster agreement, Yahya Khan declared martial law, banned the Awami League and ordered the army to arrest Mujib and other Bengali leaders and activists. The army launched <a href="/wiki/Operation_Searchlight" id="w">Operation Searchlight</a> to curb the political and civil unrest, fighting the nationalist militias that were believed to have received training in India. Speaking on radio even as the army began its crackdown, Mujib declared Bangladesh&#39;s independence at midnight on <a href="/wiki/March_26" id="w">March 26</a> <a href="/wiki/1971" id="w">1971</a>:<sup id="_ref-TIME-1971-04-05_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TIME-1971-04-05" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-BAL_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BAL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Mujib was arrested and moved to West Pakistan and kept under heavy guard in a jail near <a href="/wiki/Faisalabad" id="w">Faisalabad</a> (then Lyallpur). Many other League politicians avoided arrest by fleeing to India and other countries. Pakistani general <a href="/wiki/Rahimuddin_Khan" id="w">Rahimuddin Khan</a> was appointed to preside over Mujib&#39;s criminal court case.

Mujibur Rahman briefly assumed the provisional presidency and later took office as the prime minister, heading all organs of government and decision-making. In doing so, he dismissed Tajuddin Ahmad following a controversial intra-party power struggle that had occurred during Mujib&#39;s incarceration. The politicians elected in 1970 formed the provisional <a href="/wiki/Jatiyo_Sangshad" id="w">parliament</a> of the new state. The Mukti Bahini and other militias amalgamated to form a new <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh_Army" id="w">Bangladeshi army</a> to which Indian forces transferred control on <a href="/wiki/March_17" id="w">March 17</a>.<sup id="_ref-BAL_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BAL" title="">[2]</a></sup> Mujib described the fallout of the war as the &#34;biggest human disaster in the world,&#34; claiming the deaths of as many as 3 million people and the <a href="/wiki/Rape" id="w">rape</a> of more than 200,000 women; these figures are disputed by other sources.<sup id="_ref-TSA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TSA" title="">[13]</a></sup> The government faced serious challenges, which including the rehabilitation of millions of people displaced in 1971, organising the supply of food, health aids and other necessities. The effects of the 1970 cyclone had not worn off, and the state&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_Bangladesh" id="w">economy</a> had immensely deteriorated by the conflict. There was also violence against non-Bengalis and groups who were believed to have assisted the Pakistani forces. By the end of the year, thousands of Bengalis arrived from Pakistan, and thousands of non-Bengalis migrated to Pakistan; and yet many thousands remained in <a href="/wiki/Refugee_camp" id="w">refugee camps</a>.</p>
<p>After Bangladesh achieved recognition from major countries, Mujib helped Bangladesh enter into the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement" id="w">Non-Aligned Movement</a>.

The economy began recovering and a <a href="/wiki/Famine" id="w">famine</a> was prevented.<sup id="_ref-JSTOR3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JSTOR3" title="">[17]</a></sup> A constitution was proclaimed in 1973 and <a href="/wiki/Elections_in_Bangladesh" id="w">elections</a> were held, which resulted in Mujib and his party gaining power with an absolute majority.<sup id="_ref-REF_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-REF" title="">[1]</a></sup> He further outlined state programmes to expand primary <a href="/wiki/Education_in_Bangladesh" id="w">education</a>, sanitation, food, healthcare, water and electric supply across the country.

Mujib&#39;s government soon began encountering increased dissatisfaction and unrest. His programmes of nationalisation and industrial socialism suffered from lack of trained personnel, inefficiency, rampant corruption and poor leadership.<sup id="_ref-UDDIN_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UDDIN" title="">[16]</a></sup> Mujib focused almost entirely on national issues and thus neglected local issues and government. The party and central government exercised full control and democracy was weakened, with virtually no elections organised at the grass roots or local levels.<sup id="_ref-PAPER_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PAPER" title="">[20]</a></sup> Political opposition included <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">communists</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Islamic_fundamentalism" id="w">Islamic fundamentalists</a>, who were angered by the declaration of a secular state. Mujib was criticized for <a href="/wiki/Nepotism" id="w">nepotism</a> in appointing family members to important positions.<sup id="_ref-KF_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KF" title="">[15]</a></sup> A famine in 1974 further intensified the food crisis, and devastated agriculture — the mainstay of the economy.<sup id="_ref-REF_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-REF" title="">[1]</a></sup> Intense criticism of Mujib arose over lack of political leadership, a flawed pricing policy, and rising <a href="/wiki/Inflation" id="w">inflation</a> amidst heavy losses suffered by the nationalised industries. Mujib&#39;s ambitious social programmes performed poorly, owing to scarcity of resources, funds and personnel, and caused unrest amongst the masses.<sup id="_ref-UDDIN_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UDDIN" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Political unrest gave rise to increasing violence, and in response, Mujib began increasing his powers.

It also launched major socialist programmes.

The Pakistani leadership in 1971 was considered by some observers and governments to be fighting to keep the country united in face of violent secessionist activities led by Mujib.
