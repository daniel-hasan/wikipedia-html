In film, the term <b>3-D</b> (or <b>3D</b>) is used to describe any visual presentation system that attempts to maintain or recreate moving images of the third dimension, the <a href="/wiki/Optical_illusion" id="w">illusion</a> of depth as seen by the viewer.</p>
<p>The technique usually involves filming two <a href="/wiki/Image" id="w">images</a> simultaneously, with two <a href="/wiki/Movie_camera" id="w">cameras</a> positioned side by side, generally facing each other and filming at a 90 degree angle via mirrors, in perfect synchronization and with identical technical characteristics. When viewed in such a way that each <a href="/wiki/Eye" id="w">eye</a> sees its photographed counterpart, the viewer&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Visual_cortex" id="w">visual cortex</a> will interpret the pair of images as a single three-<a href="/wiki/Dimension" id="w">dimensional</a> image. Modern computer technology also allows for the production of 3D films without dual cameras.</p>
<a id="Techniques" name="Techniques"></a><h1>Techniques</h1>
<p>There are several methods of projecting natural, stereoscopic images. They can be categorized into mainly three categories.</p>
<p>With glasses
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Anaglyph_image" id="w">Anaglyphic</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Polarized_3D_glasses" id="w">Polarization</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Alternate-frame_sequencing" id="w">Alternate-frame sequencing</a> (or <a href="/wiki/LCD_shutter_glasses" id="w">shutter glasses</a>)</li></ul>
<p>Without glasses
</p>

<li><a href="/wiki/Autostereoscopic" id="w">Autostereoscopic</a> displays</li></ul>
<p>With the aid of a viewing device 
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/#Stereoscopic Viewing Devices" id="w"></a> or head mounted displays.</li></ul>
<p>Furthermore, alternative systems, such as <a href="/wiki/Pulfrich_effect" id="w">Pulfrich effect</a> exist, but fall under the realm of &#34;pseudo-stereoscopic&#34; in that two, separate records are not recorded or projected.</p>
<p>In the context of many computer games, <a href="/wiki/3D_computer_graphics" id="w">3D computer graphics</a> refer to being composed of objects in a virtual 3-D world, not that they can be viewed in 3-D. For a stereoscopic 3-D games, as for everything else stereoscopic, two pictures (one for each eye), are needed.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<a id="Early_patents_and_tests" name="Early_patents_and_tests"></a><h2>Early patents and tests</h2>
<p>The stereoscopic era of motion pictures begins in the late <a href="/wiki/1890s" id="w">1890s</a> when British film pioneer <a href="/wiki/William_Friese-Greene" id="w">William Friese-Greene</a> files a patent for a 3-D movie process. In his patent, two films are projected side by side on screen. The viewer looked through a <a href="/wiki/Stereoscope" id="w">stereoscope</a> to converge the two images. Because of the obtrusive mechanics behind this method, theatrical use was not practical.<sup id="_ref-limbacher_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-limbacher" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Frederick_Eugene_Ives" id="w">Frederick Eugene Ives</a> patented his stereo camera rig in <a href="/wiki/1900" id="w">1900</a>. The camera had two lenses coupled together 1 3/4 inches apart.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_10" id="w">June 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1915" id="w">1915</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edwin_S._Porter" id="w">Edwin S. Porter</a> and William E. Waddell presented tests to an audience at the Astor Theater in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>. In red-green <a href="/wiki/Anaglyph" id="w">anaglyph</a>, the audience was presented three reels of tests, which included rural scenes, test shots of <a href="/wiki/Marie_Doro" id="w">Marie Doro</a>, a segment of <a href="/wiki/John_Mason" id="w">John Mason</a> playing a number of passages from <i>Jim the Penman</i> (a film released by <a href="/wiki/Famous_Players-Lasky" id="w">Famous Players-Lasky</a> that year, but not in 3-D), Oriental dancers, and a reel of footage of <a href="/wiki/Niagara_Falls" id="w">Niagara Falls</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  However, according to <a href="/wiki/Adolph_Zukor" id="w">Adolph Zukor</a> in his 1953 autobiography <i>The Public Is Never Wrong: My 50 Years in the Motion Picture Industry</i>, nothing was produced in this process after these tests.</p>
<a id="Early_systems_of_stereoscopic_filmmaking_(pre-1952)" name="Early_systems_of_stereoscopic_filmmaking_(pre-1952)"></a><h2>Early systems of stereoscopic filmmaking (pre-1952)</h2>

<p>The earliest confirmed 3-D film shown to a paying audience was <i><a href="/wiki/The_Power_of_Love" id="w">The Power of Love</a></i>, which premiered at the <a href="/wiki/Ambassador_Hotel" id="w">Ambassador Hotel</a> Theater in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" id="w">Los Angeles</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1922" id="w">1922</a>. The camera rig was a product of the film&#39;s producer, Harry K. Fairall, and cinematographer Robert F. Elder.<sup id="_ref-limbacher_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-limbacher" title="">[1]</a></sup> It was projected dual-strip in the red/green anaglyph format, making it both the earliest known film that utilized dual strip projection and the earliest known film in which anaglyph glasses were used.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Whether Fairall used colored filters on the projection ports or whether he used <a href="/wiki/Film_tinting" id="w">tinted</a> prints is unknown, but it is the first documented instance of dual-strip projection.  After a preview for exhibitors and press in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>, the film dropped out of sight, apparently not booked by exhibitors, and is now considered <a href="/wiki/Lost_film" id="w">lost</a>.</p>
<p>Early in December <a href="/wiki/1922" id="w">1922</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Van_Doren_Kelley" id="w">William Van Doren Kelley</a> cashed in on the growing interest in 3-D films started by Fairall&#39;s demonstration and shot footage with a camera system of his own design. Kelley then struck a deal with <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Roxy_Rothafel" id="w">Samuel &#34;Roxy&#34; Rothafel</a> to premiere the first in his series of &#34;Plasticon&#34; shorts entitled <i>Movies of the Future</i> at the <a href="/wiki/Rivoli_Theater" id="w">Rivoli Theater</a> in New York City .<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Kelley, who was primarily a producer of color films, used his color system, <a href="/wiki/Prizma" id="w">Prizma</a>, to print his anaglyph films. In early <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a>, he shopped around a second Plasticon entitled <i>Through the Trees - Washington D.C.</i>, shot by William T. Crespinel, which consisted of stereoscopic views of <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>, but found no buyers. {{Fact}}</p>

</p>
<p>Also in December 1922, <a href="/wiki/Laurens_Hammond" id="w">Laurens Hammond</a> (later inventor of the <a href="/wiki/Hammond_organ" id="w">Hammond organ</a>) and William F. Cassidy unveiled their <a href="/wiki/Teleview" id="w">Teleview</a> system.  Teleview was the earliest alternate-frame sequencing form of projection. Through the use of two interlocked projectors, alternating left/right frames were projected one after another in rapid succession. Synchronized viewers attached to the arm-rests of the seats in the theater open and closed at the same time, and took advantage of the viewer&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Persistence_of_vision" id="w">persistence of vision</a>, thereby creating a true stereoscopic image. The only theater known to have installed this system was the Selwyn Theater in New York. Only one show was ever produced for the system, a groups of shorts and the only Teleview feature <i><a href="/wiki/The_Man_From_M.A.R.S." id="w">The Man From M.A.R.S.</a></i> (later re-released as <i><a href="/wiki/Radio-Mania" id="w">Radio-Mania</a></i>) on <a href="/wiki/27_December" id="w">27 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1922" id="w">1922</a> in New York City.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a>, Frederick Eugene Ives and Jacob Leventhal began releasing their first stereoscopic shorts made over a three-year period. The first film entitled, <i>Plastigrams</i>, which was distributed nationally by <a href="/wiki/Educational_Pictures" id="w">Educational Pictures</a> in the red/blue anaglyph format. Ives and Leventhal then went on to produce the following stereoscopic shorts in the &#34;Stereoscopiks Series&#34; for <a href="/wiki/Path%C3%A9" id="w">Pathé Films</a> in <a href="/wiki/1925" id="w">1925</a>: <i>Zowie</i> (April 10), <i>Luna-cy</i> (May 18), <i>The Run-Away Taxi</i> (December 17) and <i>Ouch</i> (December 17).<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The late 1920s to early 1930s saw little to no interest in stereoscopic pictures, largely due to the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a>. In Paris, <a href="/wiki/Louis_Lumiere" id="w">Louis Lumiere</a> shot footage with his stereoscopic camera in September of 1933. The following year, in March 1934, he premiered his remake of his 1895 film <i><a href="/wiki/L%26%2339%3BArriv%C3%A9e_du_Train" id="w">L&#39;Arrivée du Train</a></i>, this time in anaglyphic 3-D.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a>, Leventhal and John Norling were hired based on their test footage to film MGM&#39;s <i>Audioscopiks</i> series. The prints were by <a href="/wiki/Technicolor" id="w">Technicolor</a> in the red/green anaglyph format, and were narrated by <a href="/wiki/Pete_Smith_(film_producer)" id="w">Pete Smith</a>. The first film, <i>Audioscopiks</i>, premiered <a href="/wiki/January_11" id="w">January 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a> and <i>The New Audioscopiks</i> premiered <a href="/wiki/January_15" id="w">January 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1938" id="w">1938</a>.  <i>Audioscopiks</i> was nominated for the <a href="/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Short_Film_-_Novelty" id="w">Academy Award for Short Film - Novelty</a> in <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a>.</p>
<p>With the success of the two Audioscopiks films, MGM produced one more short in anaglyph 3-D, another Pete Smith Specialty called <i>Third Dimensional Murder</i> (1941). Unlike its predecessors, this short was shot with a studio-built camera rig. Prints were by Technicolor in red/blue anaglyph. The short is notable for being one of the few live-action appearances of the Frankenstein Monster as conceived by <a href="/wiki/Jack_Pierce_(make-up_artist)" id="w">Jack Pierce</a> for <a href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" id="w">Universal Studios</a> outside of their company.</p>
<p>While many of these films were printed by color systems, it should be noted that none of them was actually in color, and the use of the color printing was only to achieve an anaglyph effect.</p>
<a id="Introduction_of_Polaroid" name="Introduction_of_Polaroid"></a><h4>Introduction of Polaroid</h4>
<p>While attending <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" id="w">Harvard University</a> in <a href="/wiki/1926" id="w">1926</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edwin_H._Land" id="w">Edwin H. Land</a> conceived the idea of reducing <a href="/wiki/Glare_(vision)" id="w">glare</a> by <a href="/wiki/Polarization" id="w">polarizing light</a>. He took a <a href="/wiki/Leave_of_absence" id="w">leave of absence</a> from Harvard to set up a lab and by <a href="/wiki/1929" id="w">1929</a> had invented and patented a polarizing sheet.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/1932" id="w">1932</a>, he introduced <b>Polaroid J Sheet</b> as a commercial product.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> While his original intention was to create a filter for reducing glare from car headlights, Land did not underestimate the utility of his newly dubbed <a href="/wiki/Polaroid" id="w">Polaroid</a> filters in stereoscopic presentations.</p>
<p>In January <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a>, Land gave the first demonstration of Polaroid filters in conjunction with 3-D photography at the <a href="/wiki/Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel" id="w">Waldorf-Astoria Hotel</a>.{{Fact}} The reaction was enthusiastic, and he followed it up with an installation at the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Museum_of_Science" id="w">New York Museum of Science</a>.{{Fact}} It is unknown what film was run for audiences with this installation.</p>
<p>Using Polaroid filters meant an entirely new set-up, however. Two prints, each carrying either the right or left eye, had to be synced up in projection using an external <a href="/wiki/Selsyn" id="w">selsyn</a> motor. Furthermore, polarized light would not register on a matte white screen, and only a <a href="/wiki/Silver_screen" id="w">silver screen</a> or screen made of other reflective material would correctly reflect the separate images.</p>
<p>Later that year, the feature, <i>Nozze Vagabonde</i> appeared in Italy{{Fact}}, followed by the first color 3-D feature, <i>Zum Greifen Nah</i> which premiered in Germany the following year{{Fact}}.  It is unknown whether or not these films took advantage of the Polaroid filter system in projection, but the possibility is present.</p>
<p>In 1939, John Norling shot <i>In Tune With Tomorrow</i>, the first Polaroid 3-D film shown for a paying audience in the US{{Fact}}.  This short premiered at the <a href="/wiki/1939_New_York_World%26%2339%3Bs_Fair" id="w">1939 New York World&#39;s Fair</a> and was created specifically for the Chrysler Motor Pavilion. In it, a full 1939 Chrysler Plymouth is magically put together, set to music. Originally in black and white, the film was so popular that it was re-shot in color for the following year at the fair, under the title <i>New Dimensions</i>{{Fact}}. In <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>, it was reissued by RKO as <i>Motor Rhythm</i>.</p>
<p>Another early short that utilized the Polaroid 3-D process was <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a>&#39;s <i>Magic Movies: Thrills For You</i> produced by the <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad" id="w">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> Co. for the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Gate_International_Exposition" id="w">Golden Gate International Exposition</a> {{Fact}}. Produced by John Norling, it was actually shot for him by Jacob Leventhal using his own rig.  It consisted of shots of various views that could be seen on Pennsylvania Railroad&#39;s trains.</p>
<p>The 1940s was further hindered by <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, and stereoscopic photography once again went on the back-burner in most producers&#39; minds.</p>
<a id="The_%22golden_era%22_(1952-1955)" name="The_%22golden_era%22_(1952-1955)"></a><h2>The &#34;golden era&#34; (1952-1955)</h2>
<p>What aficionados consider the &#34;golden era&#34; of 3-D began in <a href="/wiki/1952" id="w">1952</a> with the release of the first color stereoscopic feature, <i><a href="/wiki/Bwana_Devil" id="w">Bwana Devil</a></i>, produced, written and directed by <a href="/wiki/Arch_Oboler" id="w">Arch Oboler</a>. The film was shot in <i><a href="/wiki/Natural_Vision" id="w">Natural Vision</a></i>, a process that was co-created and controlled by <a href="/wiki/M._L._Gunzberg" id="w">M. L. Gunzberg</a>.  Gunzberg, who built the rig with his brother, Julian, and two other associates, shopped it without success to various studios before Oboler used it for this feature, which went into production with the title, <i>The Lions of Gulu</i>.{{Fact}} The film stars <a href="/wiki/Robert_Stack" id="w">Robert Stack</a>, <a href="/wiki/Barbara_Britton" id="w">Barbara Britton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nigel_Bruce" id="w">Nigel Bruce</a>.</p>
<p>As with practically all of the features made during this boom, <i>Bwana Devil</i> was projected dual-strip, with Polaroid filters. During the <a href="/wiki/1950s" id="w">1950s</a>, the familiar disposable anaglyph <a href="/wiki/Glasses" id="w">glasses</a> made of cardboard were mainly used for comic books, two shorts by exploitation specialist <a href="/wiki/Dan_Sonney" id="w">Dan Sonney</a>, and three shorts produced by <a href="/wiki/Lippert_Productions" id="w">Lippert Productions</a>. One should note, however, that even the Lippert shorts were available in the dual-strip format alternatively.</p>
<p>Because the features utilized two projectors, a capacity limit of film being loaded onto each projector (about 6,000 feet, or an hour&#39;s worth of film) meant that an intermission was necessary for every movie. Quite often, intermission points were written into the script of the film at a major plot point.</p>
<p>During Christmas of <a href="/wiki/1952" id="w">1952</a>, producer <a href="/wiki/Sol_Lesser" id="w">Sol Lesser</a> quickly premiered the dual-strip showcase called <i>Stereo Techniques</i> in Chicago.{{Fact}} Lesser acquired the rights to five dual-strip shorts. Two of them, <i>Now is the Time (to Put On Your Glasses)</i> and <i>Around is Around</i>, were directed by <a href="/wiki/Norman_McLaren" id="w">Norman McLaren</a> in 1951 for the <a href="/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada" id="w">National Film Board of Canada</a>. The other three films were produced in Britain for <a href="/wiki/Festival_of_Britain" id="w">Festival of Britain</a> in 1951 by Raymond Spottiswoode. These were <i>A Solid Explanation</i>, <i>Royal River</i>, and <i>The Black Swan</i>.</p>
<p>James Mage was also an early pioneer in the 3-D craze. Using his 16mm 3-D Bolex  system, he premiered his <i>Triorama</i> program on <a href="/wiki/February_10" id="w">February 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a> with his four shorts: <i>Sunday In Stereo</i>, <i>Indian Summer</i>, <i>American Life</i>, and <i>This is Bolex Stereo</i>{{Fact}}. This show is considered lost.</p>
<p>Another early 3-D film during the boom was the Lippert Productions short, <i>A Day in the Country</i>, narrated by <a href="/wiki/Joe_Besser" id="w">Joe Besser</a> and composed mostly of test footage. Unlike all of the other Lippert shorts, which were available in both dual-strip and anaglyph, this production was released in anaglyph only.</p>
<p>April of <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a> saw two groundbreaking features in 3-D: <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" id="w">Columbia&#39;s</a> <i>Man In the Dark</i> and <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros." id="w">Warner Bros.</a> <i><a href="/wiki/House_of_Wax_(1953_film)" id="w">House of Wax</a></i>, the first 3-D feature with <a href="/wiki/Stereophonic_sound" id="w">stereophonic sound</a>. <i>House of Wax</i>, outside of Cinerama, was the first time many American audiences heard recorded stereophonic sound. It was also the film that typecast <a href="/wiki/Vincent_Price" id="w">Vincent Price</a> as a horror star as well as the &#34;King of 3-D&#34; after he became the actor to star in the most 3-D features (the others were <i>The Mad Magician</i>, <i>Dangerous Mission</i>, and <i>Son of Sinbad</i>). The success of these two films proved that major studios now had a method of getting moviegoers back into theaters and away from television sets, which were causing a steady decline in attendance.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company#Studio Entertainment" id="w">The Walt Disney Studios</a> waded into 3-D with its <a href="/wiki/May_28" id="w">May 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a> release of <i>Melody</i>, which accompanied the first 3-D western, Columbia&#39;s <i>Fort Ti</i> at its Los Angeles opening. It was later shown at <a href="/wiki/Disneyland" id="w">Disneyland</a>&#39;s Fantasyland Theater in 1957 as part of a program with Disney&#39;s other short <i><a href="/wiki/Working_for_Peanuts" id="w">Working for Peanuts</a></i>, entitled, <i>3-D Jamboree</i>.  The show was hosted by the <a href="/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_Club" id="w">Mousketeers</a> and was in color.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" id="w">Universal-International</a> released their first 3-D feature on <a href="/wiki/May_27" id="w">May 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/It_Came_from_Outer_Space" id="w">It Came from Outer Space</a></i>, with stereophonic sound. Following that was Paramount&#39;s first feature, <i>Sangaree</i> with <a href="/wiki/Fernando_Lamas" id="w">Fernando Lamas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arlene_Dahl" id="w">Arlene Dahl</a>.</p> 
<p>Columbia produced several 3-D westerns produced by <a href="/wiki/Sam_Katzman" id="w">Sam Katzman</a> and directed by <a href="/wiki/William_Castle" id="w">William Castle</a>. Castle would later specialize in various technical in-theater gimmicks for such Columbia features as <i><a href="/wiki/13_Ghosts" id="w">13 Ghosts</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/House_on_Haunted_Hill" id="w">House on Haunted Hill</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tingler" id="w">The Tingler</a></i>.  Columbia also produced the only slapstick comedies conceived for 3-D. <a href="/wiki/The_Three_Stooges" id="w">The Three Stooges</a> starred in <i>Spooks</i> and <i>Pardon My Backfire</i>;  dialect comic Harry Mimmo starred in <i>Down the Hatch</i>. Producer <a href="/wiki/Jules_White" id="w">Jules White</a> was optimistic about the possibilities of 3-D as applied to slapstick (with pies and other projectiles aimed at the audience), but only two of his stereoscopic shorts were shown in 3-D. <i>Down the Hatch</i> was released as a conventional, &#34;flat&#34; motion picture. (Columbia has since printed <i>Down the Hatch</i> in 3-D for film festivals.)</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/John_Ireland" id="w">John Ireland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joanne_Dru" id="w">Joanne Dru</a> and <a href="/wiki/Macdonald_Carey" id="w">Macdonald Carey</a> starred in the <a href="/wiki/Jack_Broder" id="w">Jack Broder</a> color production <i>Hannah Lee</i>, which premiered <a href="/wiki/June_19" id="w">June 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>. The film was directed by Ireland, who sued Broder for his salary. Broder countersued, claiming that Ireland went over production costs with the film.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Another famous entry in the golden era of 3-D was the 3 Dimensional Pictures production of <i><a href="/wiki/Robot_Monster" id="w">Robot Monster</a></i>. The film was allegedly scribed in an hour by screenwriter Wyott Ordung and filmed in a period of two weeks on a shoestring budget.{{Fact}} Despite these shortcomings and the fact that the crew had no previous experience with the newly-built camera rig, luck was on the cinematographer&#39;s side, as many find the 3-D photography in the film is well shot and aligned.  <i>Robot Monster</i> also has a notable score by then up-and-coming composer <a href="/wiki/Elmer_Bernstein" id="w">Elmer Bernstein</a>.  The film was released <a href="/wiki/June_24" id="w">June 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a> and went out with the short <i>Stardust in Your Eyes</i>, which starred nightclub comedian, Slick Slavin.{{Fact}}</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" id="w">20th Century Fox</a> produced their only 3-D feature, <i>Inferno</i>, starring <a href="/wiki/Rhonda_Fleming" id="w">Rhonda Fleming</a>.  Fleming, who also starred in <i>Those Redheads from Seattle</i>, and <i>Jivaro</i>, shares the spot for being the actress to appear in the most 3-D features with Patricia Medina, who starred in <i>Sangaree</i>, <i>Phantom of the Rue Morgue</i> and <i>Drums of Tahiti</i>. <a href="/wiki/Darryl_F._Zanuck" id="w">Darryl F. Zanuck</a> expressed little interest in stereoscopic systems, and at that point was preparing to premiere the new widescreen film system, <a href="/wiki/CinemaScope" id="w">CinemaScope</a>.</p>
<p>The first decline in the theatrical 3-D craze started in the late summer/early fall of <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>. The factors causing this decline were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two prints had to be projected simultaneously.</li>
<li>The prints had to remain exactly alike after repair, or synchronization would be lost.</li>
<li>It sometimes required two projectionists to keep sync working properly. </li>
<li>When either prints or shutters became out of sync, the picture became virtually unwatchable and accounted for headaches and eyestrain.</li>
<li>The necessary silver projection screen was very directional and caused sideline seating to be unusable with both 3-D and regular films, due to the angular darkening of these screens. Later films that opened in wider-seated venues often premiered flat for that reason (such at <i>Kiss Me Kate</i> at the <a href="/wiki/Radio_City_Music_Hall" id="w">Radio City Music Hall</a>).</li></ul>
<p>Because projection booth operators were at many times careless, even at preview screenings of 3-D films, trade and newspaper critics claimed that certain films were &#34;hard on the eyes.&#34;{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Sol Lesser attempted to follow up <i>Stereo Techniques</i> with a new showcase, this time five shorts that he himself produced.{{Fact}} The project was to be called <i>The 3-D Follies</i> and was to be distributed by RKO.{{Fact}} Unfortunately, because of financial difficulties and the growing disinterest in 3-D, Lesser cancelled the project during the summer of 1953, making it the first 3-D film to be aborted in production.{{Fact}} Two of the three shorts were shot: <i>Carmenesque</i>, a burlesque number starring exotic dancer <a href="/wiki/Lili_St._Cyr" id="w">Lili St. Cyr</a>. and <i>Fun in the Sun</i>, a sports short directed by famed set designer/director <a href="/wiki/William_Cameron_Menzies" id="w">William Cameron Menzies</a>, who also directed the 3-D feature <i>The Maze</i> for Allied Artists.</p>
<p>Although it was more expensive to install, the major competing realism process was <a href="/wiki/Anamorphic" id="w">anamorphic</a>, first utilized by Fox with <a href="/wiki/Cinemascope" id="w">Cinemascope</a> and its September premiere in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Robe_(film)" id="w">The Robe</a></i>. Anamorphic features needed only a single print, so synchronization was not an issue. Cinerama was also a competitor from the start and had better quality control than 3-D because it was owned by one company that focussed on quality control. However, most of the 3-D features past the summer of 1953 were released in the flat <a href="/wiki/Widescreen" id="w">widescreen</a> formats ranging from 1.66:1 to 1.85:1.  It should be noted that in early studio advertisements and articles about widescreen and 3-D formats, widescreen systems were being referred to as &#34;3-D,&#34; causing some confusion among scholars.</p>
<p>There was no single instance of combining Cinemascope with 3-D until <a href="/wiki/1960" id="w">1960</a>, with a film called <i>September Storm</i>, and even then, that was a blow-up from a non-anamorphic negative.{{Fact}} <i>September Storm</i> also went out with the last dual-strip short, <i>Space Attack</i>, which was actually shot in <a href="/wiki/1954" id="w">1954</a> under the title <i>The Adventures of Sam Space</i>.</p>
<p>In December <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>, 3-D made a comeback with the release of several important 3-D films, including MGM&#39;s musical <i><a href="/wiki/Kiss_Me%2C_Kate_(film)" id="w">Kiss Me, Kate</a></i>. <i>Kate</i> was the hill over which 3-D had to pass to survive.  MGM tested it in six theaters: three in 3-D and three flat.{{Fact}} The 3-D version was so well-received that the film quickly went into a wide stereoscopic release.{{Fact}} Contrary to published opinion that stated the film played most theaters flat, the release was so popular that the demand for the 3-D version caused a surplus order of Technicolor dual-strip prints.{{Fact}} The film, based on the popular Samuel and Bella Spewack musical, was one of MGM&#39;s &#34;Lucky 7&#34; films of the year,{{Fact}} and starred the MGM songbird team of <a href="/wiki/Howard_Keel" id="w">Howard Keel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kathryn_Grayson" id="w">Kathryn Grayson</a> as the leads, supported by <a href="/wiki/Ann_Miller" id="w">Ann Miller</a>, <a href="/wiki/Keenan_Wynn" id="w">Keenan Wynn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bobby_Van" id="w">Bobby Van</a>, <a href="/wiki/James_Whitmore" id="w">James Whitmore</a>, Kurt Kasznar and <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Rall" id="w">Tommy Rall</a>. The film also prominently promoted its use of stereophonic sound.</p>
<p>Several other features that helped put 3-D back on the map that month were the John Wayne feature <i><a href="/wiki/Hondo_(film)" id="w">Hondo</a></i> (distributed by Warner Bros.), Columbia&#39;s <i>Miss Sadie Thompson</i> with <a href="/wiki/Rita_Hayworth" id="w">Rita Hayworth</a>, and Paramount&#39;s <i>Money From Home</i> with <a href="/wiki/Dean_Martin" id="w">Dean Martin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Lewis" id="w">Jerry Lewis</a>. Paramount also released the cartoon shorts <i>Boo Moon</i> with <a href="/wiki/Casper_the_Friendly_Ghost" id="w">Casper, the Friendly Ghost</a> and <i>Popeye, Ace of Space</i> with <a href="/wiki/Popeye" id="w">Popeye the Sailor</a>.  <a href="/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" id="w">Paramount Pictures</a> released a 3-D <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" id="w">Korean War</a> film <i>Cease Fire</i> filmed on actual Korean locations in 1953.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Top_Banana_(film)" id="w">Top Banana</a></i>, based on the popular <a href="/wiki/Top_Banana_(musical)" id="w">stage musical</a> with <a href="/wiki/Phil_Silvers" id="w">Phil Silvers</a>, was brought to the screen with the original cast. Although it was merely a filmed stage production, the idea was that every audience member would feel they would have the best seat in the house through color photography and 3-D.{{Fact}} Although the film was shot and edited in 3-D, <a href="/wiki/United_Artists" id="w">United Artists</a>, the distributor, felt the production was uneconomical in stereoscopic form and released the film flat on <a href="/wiki/January_27" id="w">January 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1954" id="w">1954</a>.{{Fact}} It remains one of two &#34;Golden era&#34; 3- D features, along with another United Artists feature, <i>Southwest Passage</i> (with John Ireland and Joanne Dru), that are currently considered lost (although flat versions survive).</p>
<p>A string of successful 3-D movies followed the second wave. Some highlights are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/The_French_Line" id="w">The French Line</a></i>, starring <a href="/wiki/Jane_Russell" id="w">Jane Russell</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_Roland" id="w">Gilbert Roland</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Howard_Hughes" id="w">Howard Hughes</a>/RKO production. The film became infamous for being released without an MPAA seal of approval, after several suggestive lyrics were included, as well as one of Ms. Russell&#39;s particularly revealing costumes.{{Fact}} Playing up her sex appeal, one tagline for the film was, &#34;It&#39;ll knock <i>both</i> of your eyes out!&#34; The film was later cut and approved by the MPAA for a general flat release, despite having a wide and profitable 3-D release.{{Fact}}</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><i>Taza, Son of Cochise</i>, which starred <a href="/wiki/Rock_Hudson" id="w">Rock Hudson</a> in the title role, Barbara Rush as the love interest, and <a href="/wiki/Rex_Reason" id="w">Rex Reason</a> (billed as Bart Roberts) as his renegade brother, released through Universal-International.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Two ape films: <i>Phantom of the Rue Morgue</i>, featuring <a href="/wiki/Karl_Malden" id="w">Karl Malden</a> and Patricia Medina, and produced by Warner Bros. and based on <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe" id="w">Edgar Allan Poe</a>&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Murders_in_the_Rue_Morgue" id="w">The Murders in the Rue Morgue</a>,&#34; and <i>Gorilla At Large</i>, a Panoramic Production starring <a href="/wiki/Cameron_Mitchell_(actor)" id="w">Cameron Mitchell</a>, distributed through Fox.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Creature_from_the_Black_Lagoon" id="w">Creature from the Black Lagoon</a></i>, starring <a href="/wiki/Richard_Carlson" id="w">Richard Carlson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Julie_Adams" id="w">Julie Adams</a>, directed by <a href="/wiki/Jack_Arnold" id="w">Jack Arnold</a>. Arguably the most famous 3-D movie, and the only 3-D feature that spawned a sequel, <i><a href="/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Creature" id="w">Revenge of the Creature</a></i> in 3-D (followed by another sequel, <i>The Creature Walks Among Us</i>, shot flat).</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Cat-Women_of_the_Moon" id="w">Cat-Women of the Moon</a></i>, an <a href="/wiki/Astor_Picture" id="w">Astor Picture</a> starring <a href="/wiki/Victor_Jory" id="w">Victor Jory</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marie_Windsor" id="w">Marie Windsor</a>.

<li><i><a href="/wiki/Dial_M_for_Murder" id="w">Dial M for Murder</a></i>, directed by <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" id="w">Alfred Hitchcock</a> and starring <a href="/wiki/Ray_Milland" id="w">Ray Milland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Cummings" id="w">Robert Cummings</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Grace_Kelly" id="w">Grace Kelly</a>, is considered by aficionados of 3-D to be one of the best examples of the process. Although available in 3-D in 1954, there are no known playdates in 3-D, since Warner Bros. had just instated a simultaneous 3-D/2-D release policy. The film&#39;s screening in 3-D in <a href="/wiki/February_1980" id="w">February 1980</a> at the York Theater in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" id="w">San Francisco</a> did so well that Warner Bros.  re-released the film in 3-D in <a href="/wiki/February_1982" id="w">February 1982</a>.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Gog_(film)" id="w">Gog</a></i>, an <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Tors" id="w">Ivan Tors</a> production, dealing with realistic science fiction. The second film in Tors&#39; &#34;Office of Scientific Investigation&#34; trilogy of film, which included, <i>The Magnetic Monster</i> and <i>Riders to the Stars</i>.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><i>The Diamond Wizard</i>, the only stereoscopic feature shot in Britain, released flat in both the UK and US. It starred and was directed by <a href="/wiki/Dennis_O%26%2339%3BKeefe" id="w">Dennis O&#39;Keefe</a>.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Irwin_Allen" id="w">Irwin Allen</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Dangerous_Mission" id="w">Dangerous Mission</a></i> released by RKO in 1954 featuring Allen&#39;s trademarks of an all star cast facing a disaster (a forest fire).</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><i>Son of Sinbad</i>, another RKO/Howard Hughes production, starring <a href="/wiki/Dale_Robertson" id="w">Dale Robertson</a>, Lili St. Cyr, and Vincent Price. The film was shelved after Hughes ran into difficulty with <i>The French Line</i>, and wasn&#39;t released until 1955, at which time it went out flat, converted to the SuperScope process.</li></ul>
<p>3-D&#39;s final decline was in the late spring of <a href="/wiki/1954" id="w">1954</a>, for the same reasons as the previous lull, as well as the further success of widescreen formats with theater operators. Even though Polaroid had created a well-designed &#34;Tell-Tale Filter Kit&#34; for the purpose of recognizing and adjusting out of sync and phase 3-D,{{Fact}} exhibitors still felt uncomfortable with the system and turned their focus instead to processes such as CinemaScope. The last 3-D feature to be released in that format during the &#34;Golden era&#34; was <i>Revenge of the Creature</i>, on <a href="/wiki/February_23" id="w">February 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1955" id="w">1955</a>.  Ironically, the film had a wide release in 3-D and was well received at the box office.{{Fact}}</p>
<a id="Revival_(1960-1979)_in_single_strip_format" name="Revival_(1960-1979)_in_single_strip_format"></a><h2>  Revival (1960-1979) in single strip format</h2>
<p>Stereoscopic films largely remained dormant for the first part of the <a href="/wiki/1960s" id="w">1960s</a>, with those that were released usually being anaglyph exploitation films. One film of notoriety was the Beaver-Champion/Warner Bros. production, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Mask_(1961_film)" id="w">The Mask</a></i> (1961). The film was shot in 2-D, but to enhance the bizarre qualities of the dream-world that is induced when the main character puts on a cursed tribal mask, the film went to anaglyph 3-D. These scenes were printed by Technicolor on their first run in red/green anaglyph.</p>
<p>Although 3-D films appeared sparsely during the early <a href="/wiki/1960s" id="w">1960s</a>, the true second wave of 3-D cinema was set into motion with the same producer who started the craze of the <a href="/wiki/1950s" id="w">1950s</a>. Using a new technology called <i>Space-Vision 3D</i>, stereoscopic films were printed with two images, one above the other, in a single academy ratio frame, on a single strip, and needed only one projector fitted with a special lens. This so-called &#34;over and under&#34; technique eliminated the need for dual projector set-ups, and produced widescreen, but darker, less vivid, polarized 3-D images. Unlike earlier dual system, it could stay in perfect sync, unless improperly spliced in repair.</p>
<p>Arch Oboler once again had the vision for the system that no one else would touch, and put it to use on his film entitled <i>The Bubble</i>, which starred <a href="/wiki/Michael_Cole" id="w">Michael Cole</a>, <a href="/wiki/Deborah_Walley" id="w">Deborah Walley</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Desmond" id="w">Johnny Desmond</a>. As with <i>Bwana Devil</i>, the critics panned <i>The Bubble</i>, but audiences flocked to see it, and it became financially sound enough to promote the use of the system to other studios, particularly independents, who did not have the money for expensive dual-strip prints of their productions.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stereovision" id="w">Stereovision</a>, A new entity, founded by director/inventor, Allan Silliphant, and optical designer Chris Condon, developed a different 35mm single-strip format, which printed two images squeezed side-by-side and used an anamorphic lens to widen the pictures through polaroid filters. The new process, could not go out of sync, in the side by side version. Louis K. Sher (Sherpix) and Stereovision released the softcore sex comedy <a href="/wiki/The_Stewardesses" id="w">The Stewardesses</a> (self-rated X, but later re-rated R by the MPAA). The film cost $100,000 USD to produce, and ran for up to a year in several markets.{{Fact}} eventually earning $27 million in North America, alone ($114 million in constant-2007 dollars) in fewer than 800 theaters, becoming the most profitable 3-Dimensional film to date, and in purely relative terms, one of the most profitable films, ever. It was later released in 70mm 3-D.{{Fact}} 3-D legend Chris Condon, and Director Ed Meyer, are set to remake <a href="/wiki/The_Stewardesses" id="w">The Stewardesses</a>, the most successful 3D film in history, in Real D in 2009. Some 36 films world-wide were made with Stereovision over 25 years, using either a widescreen (above-below) or the anamorphic (side by side) format or 70mm 3-D. 3-D has become a popular American tradition. </p>
<p>The quality of the following 3-D films were not much more inventive, as many were either softcore and even hardcore adult films, horror films, or a combination of both. Paul Morrisey&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Andy_Warhol%26%2339%3Bs_Frankenstein" id="w">Flesh For Frankenstein</a></i> (aka <i><a href="/wiki/Andy_Warhol%26%2339%3Bs_Frankenstein" id="w">Andy Warhol&#39;s Frankenstein</a></i>) was a superlative example of such a combination.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/1980s" id="w">1980s</a>, <a href="/wiki/IMAX" id="w">IMAX</a> (Large format-sideways running, 70mm) began offering non-fiction films in 3-D, starting with the 20-min. <a href="/wiki/National_Film_Board_of_Canada" id="w">National Film Board of Canada</a> production <i><a href="/wiki/Transitions_(film)" id="w">Transitions</a></i>, created for <a href="/wiki/Expo_86" id="w">Expo 86</a> in <a href="/wiki/Vancouver" id="w">Vancouver</a>. The first IMAX 3-D fiction film was the 45-minute <i><a href="/wiki/Wings_of_Courage" id="w">Wings of Courage</a></i> (1995), by director <a href="/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Annaud" id="w">Jean-Jacques Annaud</a>, about the author and pilot <a href="/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry" id="w">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</a>.</p>
<p>Using the over-under process pioneered by SpaceVision, Hollywood&#39;s film-makers hit a craze comparable to that of the one thirty years previous. With the popularity of StereoVision re-issues of <i>House of Wax</i> and <i>Dial M for Murder</i>, newly inspired directors jumped the bandwagon in creating 3-D films geared towards newer, mainstream audiences.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/September_2003" id="w">September 2003</a>, Sabucat Productions organized the first World 3-D Exposition, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the original craze. The Expo was held at <a href="/wiki/Grauman%26%2339%3Bs_Egyptian_Theatre" id="w">Grauman&#39;s Egyptian Theatre</a>. During the two-week festival, over 30 of the 50 &#34;golden era&#34; stereoscopic features (as well as shorts) were screened, many coming from the collection of film historian and archivist Robert Furmanek, who had spent the previous 15 years painstakingly tracking down and preserving each film to its original glory. In attendance were many stars from each film, respectively, and some were moved to tears by the sold-out seating with audiences of film buffs from all over the world who came to remember their previous glories.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/May_2006" id="w">May 2006</a>, the second World 3-D Exposition was announced for September of that year, presented by the <a href="/wiki/3-D_Film_Preservation_Fund" id="w">3-D Film Preservation Fund</a>. Along with the favorites of the previous exposition were newly discovered features and shorts, and like the previous Expo, guests from each film. Expo II was announced as being the local for the world premiere of several films never before seen in 3-D, including <i>The Diamond Wizard</i> and the Universal short, <i>Hawaiian Nights</i> with <a href="/wiki/Mamie_Van_Doren" id="w">Mamie Van Doren</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pinky_Lee" id="w">Pinky Lee</a>.

Also shown were the long-lost shorts <i>Carmenesque</i> and <i>A Day in the Country</i> (both 1953) and William Van Doren Kelley&#39;s two <i>Plasticon</i> shorts (1922 and 1923).</p>

The additions are 3DVX–H and 3D-SSR which is a solid state stereoscopic recorder that directly interfaces with the 3DVX3, 3DVX3.5 or 3DVX–H.</p>
<p>The 5th Harry Potter film, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(film)" id="w">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></i>, was released in IMAX theatres in July 2007 with 20 minutes of 3-D images.</p>
<p>In October 2006 it was announced that <i><a href="/wiki/Beowulf_(2007_film)" id="w">Beowulf</a></i> would be shown in a 3-D format as well as the 35mm format.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Horrorween" id="w">Horrorween</a></i> to be released in 2008, will also be in Real D 3-D.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/The_Stewardesses" id="w">The Stewardesses</a></i>, the most successful 3D film in history, is set to be remade in Real D, to be released in 2009.</p>

<p>On March 30, 2007 the first truly wide release of an animation film in digital 3D took place. The Disney film used the <a href="/wiki/Real_D_Cinema" id="w">Real D</a> technology, which utilizes <a href="/wiki/Polarized_glasses" id="w">polarized glasses</a>. More than 600 theaters were equipped to run the new digital stereo format. Disney is hoping this will become an animation mainstay, just as their use of Technicolor for <a href="/wiki/Snow_White" id="w">Snow White</a>, 1937,
changed the face of animation and the movies, in general.</p>

<p>In March 2005 German <a href="/wiki/Fraunhofer_Institute" id="w">Fraunhofer Institute</a> for Telecommunications demonstrated fully functional  30-inch 3-D monitors with a resolution of 1600 by 1200 pixels at the <a href="/wiki/CeBIT" id="w">CeBIT</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hannover" id="w">Hannover</a> (<a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>) that do not require additional equipment for viewing. Visitors of the CeBIT were shown 3-dimensional objects and films.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Philips" id="w">Philips</a> is also developing a flat screen Television currently named <a href="/wiki/WOW_VX" id="w">WOWvx</a> where it is possible to watch 3D films without glasses.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>The development of 3-D television represents a new generation of displays and advertising that will be available for home use in the future. Presently WOWvx is still for the professional market, primarily for digital signage and advertisements.</p>


<a id="Stereoscopic_Viewing_Devices" name="Stereoscopic_Viewing_Devices"></a><h1>Stereoscopic Viewing Devices </h1>

<p>The introduction of the <i>Apple Video IPod</i> has rekindled interest in the use of side-by-side video capture and presentation as a means of producing small scale, real-time stereoscopic (3D) video. Research at the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.usc.edu.au/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.usc.edu.au/">University of the Sunshine Coast</a> in Queensland, Australia, during 2007 has demonstrated the potential for live video to be captured and played back using a simple stereoscopic viewer adapted to fit an ipod classic or touch screen device (or any similar hand held video player). Although reviving earlier work in stereoscopic photography and film (such as that done by <a href="/wiki/David_Brewster" id="w">David Brewster</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Friese-Greene" id="w">William Friese-Greene</a>) the miniaturisation of the video image allows for earlier analogue viewing techniques to be reapplied as a practical and accessible strategy for capturing and reproducing stereographic video at low cost and with low bandwidth requirements. </p>

<p>The use of stereoscopic video in the teaching and learning context, especially in demonstrating spatial movement and detailed motor skills in an on-line study environment is being explored as a key application for this low-cost display system.</p>
