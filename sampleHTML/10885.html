<p>In areas like Tokyo where &#34;chips&#34; is the common term, &#34;French fries&#34; usually refers to the thinner variant found in US-influenced <a href="/wiki/Fast_food" id="w">fast food</a> restaurants, or to the even thinner &#34;shoestring potatoes&#34;. In North America &#34;chips&#34; generally means <a href="/wiki/Potato_chips" id="w">potato chips</a> (called &#34;crisps&#34; in the UK and Ireland), which are deep-fried very thin slices of potato that are usually served at room temperature. In Australia &#34;chips&#34; refefers to any form of fried potato.

<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>French fried potatoes also known as &#34;French Fries&#34; were likely invented during the 18th century in the area that later became <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a>. The name &#34;French&#34; was applied to them in English at the beginning of the 19th century. </p>
<a id="Culinary_origin_of_the_term" name="Culinary_origin_of_the_term"></a><h3>Culinary origin of the term</h3>
<p>The straightforward explanation of the term is that it means potatoes fried in the French sense of the verb &#34;to fry&#34; , which can mean either <a href="/wiki/Saut%C3%A9ing" id="w">sautéing</a> or <a href="/wiki/Deep-frying" id="w">deep-fat frying</a>, while its <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a> origin, <i>frire</i>, unambiguously means deep-frying&#160;: <i>frites</i> being its <a href="/wiki/Past_participle" id="w">past participle</a> used with a plural <a href="/wiki/Grammatical_gender" id="w">feminine substantive</a>, as in <i>pommes de terre frites</i> (&#34;deep-fried potatoes&#34;).<sup id="_ref-ppc_hess1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ppc_hess1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-atilf1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-atilf1" title="">[2]</a></sup>
<a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" id="w">Thomas Jefferson</a>, famous for serving French dishes, wrote exactly the latter French expression.<sup id="_ref-ppc_hess1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ppc_hess1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-jpc_fishwick1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jpc_fishwick1" title="">[3]</a></sup>
In the early 20th century, the term &#34;French fried&#34; was being used for foods such as <a href="/wiki/Onion_rings" id="w">onion rings</a> or <a href="/wiki/Chicken" id="w">chicken</a>, apart from potatoes.<sup id="_ref-nytm_mackenzie1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nytm_mackenzie1" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-rorer1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rorer1" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The verb &#34;to french&#34;, though not attested until after &#34;French fried potatoes&#34; had appeared{{Fact}}, can refer to &#34;<a href="/wiki/Julienning" id="w">julienning</a>&#34; of vegetables as is acknowledged by some dictionaries<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> while others only refer to trimming the meat off the <a href="/wiki/Shank" id="w">shanks</a> of chops.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> In the UK &#34;French-trimmed&#34; lamb chops (particularly for serving as a &#39;rack of lamb&#39;) have the majority of the fat removed together with a small piece of fatty meat from between the ends of the chop bones, leaving mainly only the meat forming the &#34;eye&#34; of the chop attached.</p>
<a id="Belgium" name="Belgium"></a><h3>Belgium</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Belgians" id="w">Belgians</a> claim that &#34;French&#34; fries are in fact Belgian, but definitive evidence for the origin has not been presented.  Belgian <a href="/wiki/Historian" id="w">historian</a> Jo Gerard recounts that potatoes were already fried in 1680 in the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Netherlands" id="w">Spanish Netherlands</a>, in the area of &#34;the <a href="/wiki/Meuse_River" id="w">Meuse</a> valley between <a href="/wiki/Dinant" id="w">Dinant</a> and <a href="/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge" id="w">Liège</a>, Belgium. The poor inhabitants of this region allegedly had the custom of accompanying their <a href="/wiki/Meal" id="w">meals</a> with small fried <a href="/wiki/Fish" id="w">fish</a>, but when the <a href="/wiki/River" id="w">river</a> was frozen and they were unable to fish, they cut potatoes lengthwise and fried them in <a href="/wiki/Cooking_oil" id="w">oil</a> to accompany their meals.&#34;<sup id="_ref-belgiangov1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-belgiangov1" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-fritkotmax1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fritkotmax1" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-jcwebdesign_cw1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jcwebdesign_cw1" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Dutch_people" id="w">Dutch</a> concur with a <a href="/wiki/Southern_Netherlands" id="w">Southern Netherlandish</a> or Belgian origin when referring to <i>Vlaamse frieten</i> (&#39;<a href="/wiki/Flanders" id="w">Flemish</a> fries&#39;). In 1857, the <a href="/wiki/Newspaper" id="w">newspaper</a> <i>Courrier de Verviers</i> devotes an article to Fritz (assumed pun with<i> &#39;frites<b>), a Belgian <a href="/wiki/Entrepreneur" id="w">entrepreneur</a> selling French fries at fairs, calling them &#34;<i>le roi des pommes de terre frites</i>&#34;. In 1862, a stall selling French fried potatoes (see <a href="/wiki/French_fries#Belgium_2" id="w">&#39;&#39;frietkot&#39;&#39;</a>) called &#34;<i>Max en Fritz</i>&#34; was established near <a href="/wiki/Het_Steen" id="w">Het Steen</a> in Antwerp.<sup id="_ref-ilegems1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ilegems1" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-fritkotmax1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fritkotmax1" title="">[9]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>A Belgian legend claims that the term &#34;French&#34; was introduced when <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> or <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">American</a> soldiers arrived in Belgium during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, and consequently tasted Belgian fries. They supposedly called them &#34;French&#34;, as it was the official <a href="/wiki/Language" id="w">language</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Belgian_Army" id="w">Belgian Army</a> at that time.<sup id="_ref-fritkotmax1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fritkotmax1" title="">[9]</a></sup> But the term &#34;French fried potatoes&#34; had been in use in America long before the <a href="/wiki/Great_War" id="w">Great War</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not Belgians invented them, &#34;frites&#34; &#34;quickly became the national <a href="/wiki/Snack" id="w">snack</a> and a substantial part of both national dishes — making the Belgians their largest consumers,{{Fact}} and to <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>, their &#34;symbolic&#34; creators.</p>
<a id="France" name="France"></a><h3>France</h3>
<p>Many Americans attribute the dish to <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> — although in France they are often thought of as Belgian — and offer as evidence a notation by <a href="/wiki/U.S._President" id="w">U.S. President</a> <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" id="w">Thomas Jefferson</a>. <i>&#34;Pommes de terre frites à cru, en petites tranches&#34;</i> (&#34;Potatoes deep-fried while raw, in small cuttings&#34;) are noted in a manuscript in Thomas Jefferson&#39;s hand (circa 1801-1809) and the <a href="/wiki/Recipe" id="w">recipe</a> almost certainly comes from his French <a href="/wiki/Chef" id="w">chef</a>, Honoré Julien.<sup id="_ref-ppc_hess1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ppc_hess1" title="">[1]</a></sup> It is worth noting, though, that France had recently <a href="/wiki/Annexation" id="w">annexed</a> what is now Belgium, and would retain control over it until the <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna" id="w">Congress of Vienna</a> of 1815 brought it under <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands" id="w">Dutch reign</a>.<sup id="_ref-clc_ebeling1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-clc_ebeling1" title="">[12]</a></sup>
In addition, from 1813<sup id="_ref-ude1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ude1" title="">[13]</a></sup> on, recipes for what can be described as French fries, occur in popular American <a href="/wiki/Cookbook" id="w">cookbooks</a>.

<p>Recipes for fried potatoes (not clearly specified how) in French cookbooks date back at least to Menon&#39;s <i>Les soupers de la cour</i> (1755). It is true that eating potatoes was promoted in France by <a href="/wiki/Antoine-Augustin_Parmentier" id="w">Parmentier</a>, but he did not mention fried potatoes in particular. And the name of the dish in languages other than English does not refer to France; in French, they are simply called<i> &#34;pommes de terres frites&#34; </i>or, more commonly, simply<i> &#34;pommes frites&#34; </i>or<i> &#39;frites<b>.</b></i></p>
<a id="Spain" name="Spain"></a><h3>Spain</h3>
<p>Some claim that the dish was invented in <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>, the first European country in which the potato appeared via the <a href="/wiki/New_World" id="w">New World</a> <a href="/wiki/Colony" id="w">colonies</a>, and assumes the first appearance to have been as an accompaniment to fish dishes in <a href="/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)" id="w">Galicia</a>,{{Fact}} from which it spread to the rest of the country and further to the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Netherlands" id="w">Spanish Netherlands</a>, more than a century before Belgium was created there.</p>

Although the thicker cut English style of chip was already a popular dish in most Commonwealth countries, the thin style of french fries has been popularized worldwide in part by <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>-based <a href="/wiki/Fast_food" id="w">fast-food</a> chains like <a href="/wiki/McDonald%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">McDonald&#39;s</a> and <a href="/wiki/Burger_King" id="w">Burger King</a>.

French fries have numerous variants, from &#34;thick-cut&#34; to &#34;shoestring&#34;, &#34;joe joes&#34;, &#34;crinkle&#34;, &#34;curly&#34; and many other names.

Sometimes, French fries are cooked in the oven as a final step in the preparation (having been coated with oil during preparation at the <a href="/wiki/Factory" id="w">factory</a>): these are often sold frozen and are called &#34;oven fries&#34; or &#34;oven chips&#34;.</p>
<p>In France, the thick-cut fries are called<i> &#39;pommes Pont-Neuf&#39;<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> </i>or simply<i> &#39;pommes frites<b>, about 10&#160;<a href="/wiki/Millimetre" id="w">mm</a>; thinner variants are<i> &#39;pommes allumettes&#39; </i>(matchstick potatoes), ±7&#160;mm, and<i> &#39;pommes pailles&#39; </i>(potato straws), 3-4&#160;mm (roughly ⅜, ¼ and ⅛&#160;<a href="/wiki/Inch" id="w">inch</a> respectively). The two-bath technique is standard (Bocuse).<i> &#39;Pommes gaufrettes&#39; </i>or  &#34;waffle-cut potatoes&#34; are not typical French fried potatoes, but actually <a href="/wiki/Crisps" id="w">crisps</a> obtained by quarter turning the potato before each next slide over a <a href="/wiki/Grater" id="w">grater</a> and deep-frying just once.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>A Belgian chef <a href="/wiki/Patent" id="w">patented</a> <i>&#34;steppegras&#34;</i> (&#39;prairie grass&#39;), his variety of extremely thin-cut French fried potatoes developed in 1968 while working in <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>.

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/British_Isles" id="w">British Isles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> and elsewhere, the term &#34;French fries&#34; is only used by fast-food restaurants serving narrow-cut (shoestring) fries. Traditional &#34;chips&#34; in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> are usually cut much thicker, typically between ⅜ and ½ <a href="/wiki/Inch" id="w">inches</a> (9.5-13&#160;mm) square in cross-section and cooked twice, making them less crunchy on the outside and <a href="/wiki/Softness" id="w">fluffier</a> on the inside. Since the surface-to-volume <a href="/wiki/Ratio" id="w">ratio</a> is lower, they have a lower fat content. Chips are part of the popular British take-away dish <a href="/wiki/Fish_and_chips" id="w">fish and chips</a>.

<p>Belgian fries are about 10-13&#160;mm thick and must be fried twice, usually in horse fat, according to American culinary celebrity <a href="/wiki/Alton_Brown" id="w">Alton Brown</a>. This was used shortly after World War II but also quickly abandoned in favor of the traditional <a href="/wiki/Ox" id="w">ox</a> or beef fat.

<p>Some home cooks who prepare French fries from scratch cook them a single time in a generous amount of oil pre-heated to a temperature around 375&#160;°F (190&#160;°C, medium to high heat power dial settings depending on the amount of fries to available fryer heat power) until they are golden and slightly crisp. The method recommended by most cookbooks, and used by many restaurants, especially those reputed to have excellent French fries, cook them in two stages: first at a thermostat temperature at around 350&#160;°F (177&#160;°C), until the fries are nearly cooked but limp, still pale and not too dried; then, after they have been removed from the oil and allowed to cool, at a higher temperature, generally around 375&#160;°F (190&#160;°C), fries are fried again until they are golden and crisp, which normally takes less than a minute. A third method, attributed to the celebrated French chef <a href="/wiki/Jo%C3%ABl_Robuchon" id="w">Joël Robuchon</a> for the home cook, is to put the sliced potatoes into a saucepan with just enough cold oil in it to cover the potatoes, then cook them over high heat until golden, stirring occasionally.<sup id="_ref-steingarten1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-steingarten1" title="">[23]</a></sup>
This chef mainly uses a more traditional style after blanching (boiling, but not over cooking in water) the cut potatoes in boiling water.<sup id="_ref-chg_whittington1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chg_whittington1" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Belgian way of cooking<i> &#39;frites&#39; </i>is generally in two stages.
</p><dl><dd>First the peeled and lengthwise crisscross cut potatoes are &#39;pre-fried&#39; (&#39;voorgebakken&#39; in Dutch) for about 7 to 12 minutes in oil or – traditionally – beef dripping preheated to about 130 to 160 °C (medium-low heat power dial settings depending on the amount of fries to oil), to cook the inner part without burning the outside, while some of the moisture is driven out and where the fragrance starts to develop. When the fries are added to the oil, the oil at first cools quickly and is quickly kept at secret values (98 °C to 122 °C) to prevent the potatoes from burning. The fries stay a pale beige to yellow color and not too dry when finished at this stage. The fries would not be burned with brown patches at this stage. Then they are taken out, tossed to avoid clumping, and generally allowed to cool down and dry. This intermediate product can be either frozen for &#39;instant&#39; deep-frying later, or as several batches of &#39;pre-fried&#39; fries prepared (e.g., when fries stands are opened for the day, or at home ahead of a company of guests) for rapid frying and almost simultaneously serving later.</dd></dl><dl><dd>The second stage where the cooked flavor is achieved involves frying for about two to five minutes in oil or beef fat preheated to 175 to 195 °C (as high as the oil or fat can safely stand, but without burning the fries before this time period: a too high temperature breaks it down to rather poisonous compounds) depending on the initial temperature of the fries. The (cool) batches must be small enough relative to the quantity of oil or fat for its preheated temperature to stay sufficiently high (125 °C to 160 °C) already during the first half minute of the frying process. Generally the cook is guided more by the color of the product than by timing; and by experience with the particular variety of potato. As a rule-of-the-thumb, one might wait until the fries start to float near the surface. The oil temperature must reach specific values (115 °C to 125 °C) for a specific amount of time after the fries has been precooked. The cooking task is to get sufficient cooking time (10 to 16 minutes) without allowing the fries to become too greasy. Once more the fries are sturdily tossed and preferably also kind of centrifuged (vigorously swerving the batch around in a wide recipient, in the shape of the base of a cone upside down, held in front of the cook&#39;s belly – common for professional batch frying), and shortly tossed again – thus removing excessive fattiness and preventing loss of the outer crispness.</dd></dl><dl><dd>Ideally, the fries have a golden to golden-brown appearance and a bite through the crispy outside reveals a soft inside. For a given depth of the crispy crust, the balance with the soft cooked potato inside is determined by the thickness; no less than 13 <a href="/wiki/Millimetre" id="w">mm</a> traditionally to 10&#160;mm towards the end of the 20th century, before frying, are typical for Belgium. Some restaurants may cut as thin as 5&#160;mm. In a good professional <i>friterie</i> stand, the cut is done in a single action by driving the whole peeled potato standing vertically, through a horizontal <i>raster</i> of crosswise sharp blades. This easily removable (for cleaning) and exchangeable set of blades defines the thickness of the <i>frites</i>.</dd></dl>
<p>Typically for U.S. fast-food restaurants, is a preparation prior to cooking:
</p><dl><dd>In an interview, Burger King president Donald Smith said that his chain&#39;s fries are sprayed with a sugar solution shortly before being packaged and shipped to individual outlets. The sugar carmelizes in the cooking fat, producing the golden color customers expect. Without it, the fries would be nearly the same color outside as inside: pasty yellow. Smith believes that McDonald&#39;s also sugar-coats its fries. McDonalds was assumed to fry their fries for a total time of about 16 to 20 minutes, and with fries fried at least twice. The secret oil temperature(s) was assumed to be such that the color of the fries would still be a pale beige before the final frying. The final frying time seems to be less than a few minutes at higher oil temperatures. The fries appear to contain beef lard, or shortening. <sup id="_ref-poundstone1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-poundstone1" title="">[25]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Even the smallest Belgian town has a <i>frietkot</i> (literally &#39;fries shack&#39;).<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> This Dutch language term also became adopted by the French speaking part of the country in addition to the French <i><a href="/wiki/Friterie" id="w">friterie</a></i>; an equivalent though slightly less colloquial Dutch form for such vending stall is <i>frietkraam</i>, while a <i>frituur</i> —from French <i>friture</i>— can as well be in a proper shop possibly furnished with tables. Traditionally, take-away chips were picked by the fingers out of a tip bag wrapped from a square paper, while walking on the streets. By the 1970s and 80s with several meat accompaniments gaining popularity, more practical open carton boxes became standard and tiny plastic forks available. One can order a small or large portion, often three or four sizes are priced.<br/><i>Fries with <a href="/wiki/Mayonnaise" id="w">mayonnaise</a></i> is a fastfood classic in Belgium, often eaten without any side orders. The limited choice around 1960 between a <a href="/wiki/Pickled_herring" id="w">pickled herring</a>, a cold large meatball <i>boulet</i> or red coloured garlic sausage <i>cervela</i> (both often served deep-fried later on), or a beef or (now rarely) horsemeat stew, became expanded by <i>stoofvlees</i> or <i>stoofkarbonade</i> and a wide variety of deep-fried meats as chicken legs, beef or pork sticks, minced beef and/or pork and/or chicken and/or turkey in all shapes (balls, sticks, sausages) mixed with a dosage of fat and condiments to one&#39;s preference, usually factory made. An example of an additional on-the-spot preparation is sometimes in Flanders called <i>mammoet speciaal</i> (mammoth special), a large <i><a href="/wiki/Frikandel" id="w">frikandel</a></i> (<i>curryworst</i> in the Antwerp and Flemish Brabant) deep-fried and cut so as to put chopped onion in the V-shaped length and dressed with <a href="/wiki/Mayonnaise" id="w">mayonnaise</a> (as real as factory made can be, not <i>frietsaus</i>) and (curry-)ketchup.

Throughout <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, white vinegar is a popular condiment for French fries. No other country is known to so enjoy white vinegar (as opposed to malt or other vinegars) on its fries. Most major Canadian fast-food outlets provide white vinegar packets next to their ketchup packets in their stores, and many restaurants keep white vinegar on their tables. That is not to say that the use of malt vinegar is not common – particularly amongst those of English heritage. In most traditional &#39;fish &#38; chips&#39; shops in Canada, malt vinegar is more prevalent. However, ketchup remains the most popular condiment used on French fries in Canada.</p>
<p>In Canada, French fries are the main component of a dish called<i> &#39;<a href="/wiki/Poutine" id="w">poutine</a><b>: a mixture of French fries with fresh <a href="/wiki/Cheese_curd" id="w">cheese curds</a>, covered with a hot <a href="/wiki/Gravy" id="w">gravy</a>, optionally with browned ground beef and/or a vegetable such as green peas mixed in.

In the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a>, vending points are often very similar to the ones in <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a> but called <i>snackbars</i>.

The Dutch also use the word <a href="/wiki/Mayonnaise" id="w">mayonnaise</a> to refer to <i>frietsaus</i> (fries-sauce) a thicker, less acidic sauce made specially to accompany French fries (as made famous in the film <i><a href="/wiki/Pulp_Fiction_(film)" id="w">Pulp Fiction</a></i>). Another interesting combination is <i>Patatje Oorlog</i> (Dutch for: <i>French Fries War</i>), which is French fries with a variety of sauces, a variety that differs from region to region, and even from one snackbar to another. While it sometimes means mayonnaise (or rather, <i>frietsaus</i>), peanut sauce and chopped raw onions, in other places it means the fries are accompanied with all condiments available. Dutch snackbars typically offer at least 8 condiments or combinations of them (the condiments are never free in the Netherlands), but some serve up to 40 different styles. The Dutch eat their fries mostly with the famous Dutch snacks such as the <a href="/wiki/Kroket" id="w">kroket</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frikandel" id="w">frikandel</a>.

<a id="Health_aspects" name="Health_aspects"></a><h2>Health aspects</h2>

<p>French fries can contain a large amount of <a href="/wiki/Fat" id="w">fat</a> (usually <a href="/wiki/Saturated_fat" id="w">saturated</a>) or <a href="/wiki/Oils" id="w">oils</a> from frying. Some researchers have suggested that the high temperatures used for frying such dishes may have results harmful to health (see <a href="/wiki/Acrylamide" id="w">acrylamides</a>). In the United States about ¼ of <a href="/wiki/Vegetable" id="w">vegetables</a> consumed are prepared as French fries and are proposed to contribute to widespread <a href="/wiki/Obesity" id="w">obesity</a>.  Frying French fries in <a href="/wiki/Beef_tallow" id="w">beef tallow</a>, recently discarded from the <a href="/wiki/McDonald%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">McDonald&#39;s</a> recipe, adds saturated fat to the diet. Replacing tallow with tropical oils such as <a href="/wiki/Palm_oil" id="w">palm oil</a> simply substitutes one saturated fat for another. Replacing tallow with partially hydrogenated oil reduces <a href="/wiki/Cholesterol" id="w">cholesterol</a> but adds <a href="/wiki/Trans_fat" id="w">trans fat</a>, which has been shown to both raise <a href="/wiki/LDL_cholesterol" id="w">LDL cholesterol</a> and lower HDL cholesterol.<sup id="_ref-harvardsph1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harvardsph1" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-nutritionaction1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nutritionaction1" title="">[34]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-mayoclinic1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mayoclinic1" title="">[35]</a></sup>
Many restaurants now advertise their use of unsaturated oils. <a href="/wiki/Five_Guys" id="w">Five Guys</a>, for example, advertises their fries are prepared in peanut oil.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Legal_issues" name="Legal_issues"></a><h2>Legal issues</h2>
<p>In 1994, the well-known owner of Stringfellows nightclub in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Stringfellow" id="w">Peter Stringfellow</a>, took exception to <a href="/wiki/McCain_Foods_Limited" id="w">McCain Foods</a>&#39; use of the name &#34;Stringfellows&#34; for a brand of long thin French fries and took them to court. He lost the case (<i>Stringfellows v McCain Food (GB) Ltd (1994)</i>) on the basis that there was no connection in the public mind between the two uses of the name, and therefore McCain&#39;s product would not have caused the nightclub to lose any sales.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>In June 2004, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" id="w">United States Department of Agriculture</a>, with the advisement of a federal district judge from <a href="/wiki/Beaumont%2C_Texas" id="w">Beaumont, Texas</a>, classified batter-coated French fries as a <a href="/wiki/Vegetable" id="w">vegetable</a> under the <a href="/wiki/Agricultural_Marketing_Service" id="w">Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act</a>. Although this move was mostly for trade reasons (French fries do not meet the standard to be listed as a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Processed_food" id="w">processed food</a>&#34;), this received significant media attention partially due to the documentary <i><a href="/wiki/Super_Size_Me" id="w">Super Size Me</a></i>.</p>
