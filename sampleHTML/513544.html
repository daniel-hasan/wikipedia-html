The <b>Buena Vista Social Club</b> was a <a href="/wiki/Social_club" id="w">members club</a> in <a href="/wiki/Havana" id="w">Havana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a> that held dances and musical activities, becoming a popular location for musicians to meet and play during the 1940s. In the 1990s, nearly 40 years after the club was closed, it inspired a recording made by <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Cuba" id="w">Cuban musician</a> <a href="/wiki/Juan_de_Marcos_Gonz%C3%A1lez" id="w">Juan de Marcos González</a> and American guitarist <a href="/wiki/Ry_Cooder" id="w">Ry Cooder</a> with traditional Cuban musicians, some of whom were veterans who had performed at the club during the height of its popularity.   </p>
<p>The recording, named <i><a href="/wiki/Buena_Vista_Social_Club_(album)" id="w">Buena Vista Social Club</a></i> after the Havana institution, became an international success, and the ensemble was encouraged to perform with a full line-up in <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" id="w">Amsterdam</a> in 1998. German director <a href="/wiki/Wim_Wenders" id="w">Wim Wenders</a> captured the performance on film, followed by a second concert in <a href="/wiki/Carnegie_Hall" id="w">Carnegie Hall</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> for a <a href="/wiki/Documentary_film" id="w">documentary</a> that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders&#39;s film, also called <i><a href="/wiki/Buena_Vista_Social_Club_(movie)" id="w">Buena Vista Social Club</a></i>, was released to critical acclaim, receiving an <a href="/wiki/Academy_Awards" id="w">Academy Award</a> nomination for <a href="/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Documentary_Feature" id="w">Best Documentary feature</a> and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the <a href="/wiki/European_Film_Awards" id="w">European Film Awards</a>.</p>
<p>The success of both the album and film sparked a revival of international interest in traditional Cuban music and <a href="/wiki/Latin_American_music" id="w">Latin American music</a> in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with international stars from different musical genres. The &#34;Buena Vista Social Club&#34; name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba&#39;s &#34;musical golden age&#34; between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble:  <a href="/wiki/Compay_Segundo" id="w">Compay Segundo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rub%C3%A9n_Gonz%C3%A1lez" id="w">Rubén González</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ibrahim_Ferrer" id="w">Ibrahim Ferrer</a>, who died at the ages of ninety-five, eighty-four, and seventy-eight respectively; Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.</p>

<p>The Buena Vista Social Club was a black members-only club located in the populous Marianao neighborhood, in Cuba&#39;s capital <a href="/wiki/Havana" id="w">Havana</a>.

<p>In 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder had been invited to Havana by British <a href="/wiki/World_music" id="w">world music</a> <a href="/wiki/Record_producer" id="w">producer</a> Nick Gold of <a href="/wiki/World_Circuit_(record_label)" id="w">World Circuit Records</a> to record a session where two <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">African</a> <a href="/wiki/High-life" id="w">High-life</a> musicians from <a href="/wiki/Mali" id="w">Mali</a> were to collaborate with Cuban musicians.<sup id="_ref-interview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview" title="">[2]</a></sup> On Cooder&#39;s arrival (via <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a> to avoid the ongoing <a href="/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba" id="w">U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba</a>),<sup id="_ref-telegraph_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-telegraph" title="">[13]</a></sup> it transpired that the musicians from Africa had not received their visas and were unable to travel to Havana.

<p>Within three days of the project&#39;s birth, Cooder, Gold and de Marcos had organized a large group of performers and arranged for recording sessions to commence at Havana&#39;s <a href="/wiki/EGREM" id="w">EGREM</a> Studios, formerly owned by <a href="/wiki/RCA" id="w">RCA</a> records, where the equipment and atmosphere had remained unchanged since the 1950s.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Communication between the Spanish and English speakers at the studio was conducted via an interpreter, although Cooder reflected that &#34;musicians understand each other through means other than speaking&#34;.<sup id="_ref-interview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview" title="">[2]</a></sup>  </p>

Shortly after returning from Havana to record the <i>Buena Vista Social Club</i> album, Ry Cooder began working with German film director <a href="/wiki/Wim_Wenders" id="w">Wim Wenders</a> on the soundtrack to Wenders&#39;s film <a href="/wiki/The_End_of_Violence" id="w">The End of Violence</a>, the third such collaboration between the two artists. According to Wenders, it was an effort to force Cooder to focus on the project, &#34;He always sort of looked in the distance and smiled, and I knew he was back in Havana.&#34;<sup id="_ref-film_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-film" title="">[30]</a></sup> Although Wenders knew nothing about Cuban music at the time, he became enthused by tapes of the Havana sessions provided by Cooder, and agreed to travel to the island to film the recording of <i>Buena Vista Social Club Presents: Ibrahim Ferrer</i>, the singer&#39;s first solo album, in 1998.<sup id="_ref-film_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-film" title="">[30]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>   </p>
<p>Wenders filmed the recording sessions on the recently enhanced format <a href="/wiki/Digital_Video" id="w">Digital Video</a> with the help of long time collaborator, <a href="/wiki/Cinematographer" id="w">cinematographer</a> Robert Müller, and then shot interviews with each &#34;Buena Vista&#34; ensemble member in different Havana locations.<sup id="_ref-film_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-film" title="">[30]</a></sup>  Wenders was also present to film the group&#39;s first performance with a full line-up in <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" id="w">Amsterdam</a> in 1999, and a second concert in <a href="/wiki/Carnegie_Hall" id="w">Carnegie Hall</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>. <div style="wigth:230px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:230px-Wim_Wenders(cannesPhotocall)-.jpg" title="Film director [[Wim Wenders]], who shot the documentary &#39;&#39;[[Buena Vista Social Club (movie)|Buena Vista Social Club]]&#39;&#39; in 1999 "><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/230px-Wim_Wenders(cannesPhotocall)-.jpg" alt="Film director [[Wim Wenders]], who shot the documentary &#39;&#39;[[Buena Vista Social Club (movie)|Buena Vista Social Club]]&#39;&#39; in 1999 " title="Film director [[Wim Wenders]], who shot the documentary &#39;&#39;[[Buena Vista Social Club (movie)|Buena Vista Social Club]]&#39;&#39; in 1999 " class="location-left type-thumb" width="230px" />

  The completed documentary was released on <a href="/wiki/September_17" id="w">September 17</a> <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a>, and included scenes in New York of the Cubans, some of whom had never left the island, window shopping and visiting tourist sites. According to <a href="/wiki/Sight_%26amp%3B_Sound" id="w">Sight &#38; Sound magazine</a>, these scenes of &#34;innocents abroad&#34; were the film&#39;s most moving moments, as the contrasts between societies of Havana and New York become evident on the faces of the performers. Ferrer, from an impoverished background and staunchly <a href="/wiki/Consumerism" id="w">anti consumerist</a>, was shown describing the city as &#34;beautiful&#34; and finding the experience overwhelming.<sup id="_ref-Sight_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sight" title="">[32]</a></sup> Upon completion of filming, Wenders felt that the film &#34;didn&#39;t feel really like it was a documentary anymore.

<p>The film became a box office success, grossing $23,002,182 worldwide.<sup id="_ref-box office_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-box office" title="">[33]</a></sup> Critics were generally enthusiastic about the story and especially the music,<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> although leading U.S. film critic <a href="/wiki/Roger_Ebert" id="w">Roger Ebert</a> and the <a href="/wiki/British_Film_Institute" id="w">British Film Institute&#39;s</a> Peter Curran felt that Wenders had lingered too long on Cooder during the performances; and the editing, which interspersed interviews with music, had disrupted the continuity of the songs.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Sight_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sight" title="">[32]</a></sup> The film was nominated for an <a href="/wiki/Academy_Awards" id="w">Academy Award</a> for best documentary feature in 1997.

Performances in Florida, which has a large <a href="/wiki/Cuban_exile" id="w">Cuban exile</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cuban_American" id="w">Cuban American</a> community, were rare after the release of the film due to the political climate. In the late 1990s, a concert by Cuban jazz pianist <a href="/wiki/Gonzalo_Rubalcaba" id="w">Gonzalo Rubalcaba</a> turned into a near riot when concert goers were attacked and spat at by protesters <a href="/wiki/Opposition_to_Fidel_Castro" id="w">opposed to the Cuban government</a>.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> When &#34;Buena Vista&#34; musicians played for a music industry conference at <a href="/wiki/Miami_Beach" id="w">Miami Beach</a> in 1998, hundreds of protesters chanted outside and the convention center hall was cleared briefly because of a bomb threat. In 1999, Ferrer and Ruben González were forced to cancel <a href="/wiki/Miami" id="w">Miami</a> shows citing fears for their safety after fellow-Cubans <a href="/wiki/Los_Van_Van" id="w">Los Van Van</a> drew 4,000 protesters at a previous show, and Compay Segundo was forced to cut short a 1999 Miami performance due to another bomb threat.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>  When touring the U.S., the Cubans are only entitled to their <i><a href="/wiki/Per_diem" id="w">per diem</a></i> (transportation and lodging) and are not permitted performance fees due to the U.S. embargo.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> </p>
<p>&#34;Buena Vista Social Club&#34; continue to tour throughout the world, and despite the deaths of five of the original members, the collective performs with many of the remaining ensemble members including Barbarito Torres, Orlando &#34;Cachaito&#34; López, and &#34;Guajiro&#34; Mirabal.<sup id="_ref-Apollo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apollo" title="">[41]</a></sup> Ry Cooder&#39;s guitar parts are handled Manuel Galbán,<sup id="_ref-Apollo_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Apollo" title="">[41]</a></sup> a former member of Cuban vocal group <a href="/wiki/Los_Zafiros" id="w">Los Zafiros</a>, who played on Ibrahim Ferrer&#39;s first solo record with Cooder and appeared in Wim Wenders&#39;s film.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Following a 2007 performance in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, a reviewer at <a href="/wiki/The_Independent" id="w">The Independent</a> newspaper described the ensemble as &#34;something of an anomaly in music business terms, due to their changing line-up and the fact that they&#39;ve never really had one defining front person&#34;, adding, &#34;It&#39;s hard to know what to expect from what is more of a brand than a band.&#34;<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Impact_and_analysis" name="Impact_and_analysis"></a><h2> Impact and analysis </h2>
<p>The international success of the Buena Vista Social Club generated a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and <a href="/wiki/Latin_American_music" id="w">Latin American music</a> as a whole.<sup id="_ref-Torres_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Torres" title="">[7]</a></sup> Musical director Juan de Marcos felt that the recordings serve &#34;as a symbol of the power of Cuban music, and which to a certain degree have contributed to Cuban music regaining the status it always had in Latin American and world music.&#34;<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup>   </p>
<p>Cuba&#39;s burgeoning <a href="/wiki/Tourism_in_Cuba" id="w">tourist industry</a> of the late 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to <a href="/wiki/The_Economist" id="w">The Economist</a> magazine, &#34;In the tourist quarters of <a href="/wiki/Old_Havana" id="w">Old Havana</a> it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It&#39;s as if you were to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner.&#34;<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> Despite the appeal of the &#34;Buena Vista&#34; ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the &#34;Buena Vista Social Club&#34; than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern <a href="/wiki/Salsa_music" id="w">salsa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pop_music" id="w">pop music</a> and other musical forms such as <a href="/wiki/Reggaeton" id="w">reggaetón</a> on the island.<sup id="_ref-global_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-global" title="">[12]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Mari Marques, a Cuban American who leads cultural tours to Cuba, contests that the preponderance of traditional musicians was not solely a consequence of the &#34;Buena Vista Social Club&#34;. Marques believes the notion that son music had been completely neglected in Cuba is &#34;a romantic exaggeration that was propagated by U.S. media coverage&#34;, and the reality is that son trios have existed &#34;everywhere in cities such as <a href="/wiki/Santiago_de_Cuba" id="w">Santiago de Cuba</a> in the east of the island.&#34;<sup id="_ref-global_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-global" title="">[12]</a></sup> British world music record label Tumi music, who had worked with de Marcos and many of the ensemble musicians prior to Cooder, asserted that Cuba has over 50,000 musicians all as good as, and some as old as the &#34;Buena Vista&#34; participants, &#34;but these people hardly ever have the opportunity to share their talents with the outside world.&#34; The label lamented that, &#34;for the West to pay any real attention and consume the product, you needed someone like Ry Cooder to give it a stamp of approval first.&#34;<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Writer and academic <a href="/wiki/Mike_Gonzalez_(historian)" id="w">Mike Gonzalez</a> believes the ensemble provoked a backward glance to &#34;timeless, sensual places where dreams and desire merged in a comfortable, evocative music&#34;. Gonzalez asserts that the aura evoked did not represent &#34;the real Cuba&#34; before the revolution of 1959, nor Cuba in the modern era, but that the Cuban government were happy for the tourist industry to &#34;enjoy the fruits of this confusion&#34;.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/American_Historical_Review" id="w">American Historical Review</a> suggested that the <i>Buena Vista Social Club<b>s <a href="/wiki/Mise_en_sc%C3%A8ne" id="w">mise en scène</a> fueled nostalgic, idealistic feelings not only of many Americans and Cubans in the United States who remember the Havana of the 1950s, but also of Cubans in Cuba. The result was a reminiscence about the pre-revolutionary era &#8212; dominated by the politics of <a href="/wiki/Gerardo_Machado" id="w">Gerardo Machado</a> in the 1920s&#8211;30s and then General <a href="/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista" id="w">Fulgencio Batista</a> until 1959 &#8212; which &#34;no longer seems so bad&#34;.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></b></i></p>
