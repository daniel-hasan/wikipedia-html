<p>The Forest of the Wabash Natural Area within Beall Woods State Park contains trees from 64 separate species.  Foresters have counted more than 300 &#34;climax&#34; trees with trunks of greater than <span style="white-space:nowrap">30&#160;inches&#160;(76&#160;cm)</span> diameter at &#34;breast&#34; i.e. <span style="white-space:nowrap">40&#160;inches&#160;(1&#160;m)</span> high.  Some of the trees in the Forest of the Wabash are more than <span style="white-space:nowrap">120&#160;feet&#160;(37&#160;m)</span> tall.</p>
<p>Trees of note include the <a href="/wiki/White_oak" id="w">white oak</a> (the state tree of Illinois), the <a href="/wiki/Tuliptree" id="w">tuliptree</a> (the state tree of Indiana, across the Wabash River), the <a href="/wiki/American_sycamore" id="w">American sycamore</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/American_Sweetgum" id="w">American Sweetgum</a>.  One of the sweetgums of this Forest is designated as the &#34;state champion&#34; tree as being the largest member of this species known to grow within the boundaries of Illinois.   </p>
<p>The Forest of the Wabash was patented by the federal government to the Beall family in the early 1800s, and was owned by them as an undisturbed woodlot until the 1960s.  Meanwhile almost all of the other old-growth trees in the Wabash Valley were cut down for fine hardwood purposes, timber, or even for <a href="/wiki/Firewood" id="w">firewood</a>.  Upon the death of Laura Beall, the last private-sector guardian of the Forest of the Wabash, and after a fight with a lumber company, in 1965 the State of Illinois condemned the Beall farm and forest for public use.</p>
