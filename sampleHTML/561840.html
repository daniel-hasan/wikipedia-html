<p>Although the Air Force had been an independent service since 1947, the rank of Chief Master Sergeant did not come into being until the authorization of the Military Pay Act of 1958.  This act established the pay grades of E-8 and E-9, but without specifying titles for those pay grades.  It wasn&#39;t until late 1958 that the title of Chief Master Sergeant (and the accompanying rank insignia) was decided upon.</p>
<p>Until his retirement in 2003, CMSgt <a href="/wiki/Norman_Marous" id="w">Norman Marous</a> was the Air Force&#39;s most senior Chief Master Sergeant, having served in the Air Force since 1962. It should be noted, however, that CMSgt. Marous left active duty in 1962 to spend 22 years in the <a href="/wiki/USAF_Reserve" id="w">USAF Reserve</a> and <a href="/wiki/National_Guard" id="w">National Guard</a> before returning to active duty as a CMSgt in 1989.</p>
