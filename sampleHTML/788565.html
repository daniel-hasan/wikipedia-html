<b>Evolutionary thought</b>, the idea that species develop over time, has its roots in antiquity, in the ideas of the <a href="/wiki/Greek_philosophy" id="w">Greeks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Romans</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chinese_philosophy" id="w">Chinese</a> and <a href="/wiki/Early_Islamic_philosophy" id="w">Muslims</a>. However, until the 18th century, <a href="/wiki/Western_thought" id="w">Western</a> biological thinking was dominated by <a href="/wiki/Essentialism" id="w">essentialism</a>, the idea that living forms are unchanging. During the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" id="w">Enlightenment</a>, evolutionary <a href="/wiki/Cosmology" id="w">cosmology</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_philosophy" id="w">mechanical philosophy</a> spread from the physical sciences to <a href="/wiki/Natural_history" id="w">natural history</a>. Naturalists such as <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Louis_Maupertuis" id="w">Maupertuis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Georges-Louis_Leclerc%2C_Comte_de_Buffon" id="w">Buffon</a> began to focus on the variability of species, and <a href="/wiki/Erasmus_Darwin" id="w">Erasmus Darwin</a> included even more explicit evolutionary speculations in his writings. The emergence of <a href="/wiki/Paleontology" id="w">paleontology</a> and with it the notion of <a href="/wiki/Extinction" id="w">extinction</a>, combined with the dramatic expansion of known species undermined the static essentialist view of nature. The first fully developed theory of evolution was proposed by <a href="/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck" id="w">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a> in the early 19th century; <a href="/wiki/Lamarckism" id="w">Lamarck&#39;s theory</a> of transmutation held that species had an innate drive pushing them up the <a href="/wiki/Great_chain_of_being" id="w">great chain of being</a>, and that the mechanism of <a href="/wiki/Inheritance_of_acquired_characteristics" id="w">inheritance of acquired characteristics</a> helped them adapt to local conditions.  </p>
<p>The evolutionary theory often referred to as <a href="/wiki/Darwinism" id="w">Darwinism</a> was first publicly put forward by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Darwin" id="w">Charles Darwin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace" id="w">Alfred Russel Wallace</a> and discussed in detail in Darwin&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species" id="w">On the Origin of Species</a></i> (1859). Unlike Lamarck&#39;s theory, Darwinism proposed <a href="/wiki/Common_descent" id="w">common descent</a> and a branching <a href="/wiki/Tree_of_life" id="w">tree of life</a>. It was based on the idea of <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" id="w">natural selection</a>, and it synthesized evidence from <a href="/wiki/Animal_husbandry" id="w">animal husbandry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biogeography" id="w">biogeography</a>, <a href="/wiki/Geology" id="w">geology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" id="w">morphology</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Embryology" id="w">embryology</a>. The debate over <i>Origin</i> raised serious questions about the place of humanity in nature, and was a key step in the process of <a href="/wiki/Methodological_naturalism" id="w">methodological naturalism</a> replacing <a href="/wiki/Natural_theology" id="w">natural theology</a> in the sciences.  </p>
<p>Darwin&#39;s work led to the rapid acceptance of <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolution</a>, but the actual mechanism he proposed, natural selection, was not widely accepted until the 1930s. Most biologists argued that other factors drove evolution, such as inheritance of acquired characteristics (neo-Lamarckism), an innate drive for change (<a href="/wiki/Orthogenesis" id="w">orthogenesis</a>), or sudden large mutations (<a href="/wiki/Saltationism" id="w">saltationism</a>). With the rediscovery of <a href="/wiki/Mendelian_genetics" id="w">Mendelian genetics</a>, and with <a href="/wiki/T.H._Morgan" id="w">T.H. Morgan</a>&#39;s studies on <a href="/wiki/Mutation" id="w">mutation</a>, scientists began to better understand the nature of inheritance and variation. This eventually led to the synthesis of natural selection with Mendelian genetics during the 1920s and 1930s, forming the new discipline of <a href="/wiki/Population_genetics" id="w">population genetics</a>. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, population genetics became integrated with other branches of biology, finally resulting in a unified theory of evolution - the <a href="/wiki/Modern_evolutionary_synthesis" id="w">modern evolutionary synthesis</a>, which restored natural selection to a central role in evolutionary theory.</p>
<p>Following this establishment of <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_biology" id="w">evolutionary biology</a>, the theory of evolution developed rapidly.  Studies of <a href="/wiki/Mutation" id="w">mutation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Variation" id="w">variation</a> in natural populations, combined with <a href="/wiki/Biogeography" id="w">biogeography</a> and <a href="/wiki/Systematics" id="w">systematics</a>, led to sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolution.  Paleontology and <a href="/wiki/Comparative_anatomy" id="w">comparative anatomy</a> allowed more detailed reconstructions of the <a href="/wiki/History_of_life" id="w">history of life</a>. After the rise of <a href="/wiki/Molecular_genetics" id="w">molecular genetics</a> in the 1950s, the field of <a href="/wiki/Molecular_evolution" id="w">molecular evolution</a> developed, based on <a href="/wiki/DNA" id="w">DNA</a>, <a href="/wiki/RNA" id="w">RNA</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Protein_sequence" id="w">protein sequences</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution" id="w">gene-centered view of evolution</a> then rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the <a href="/wiki/Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution" id="w">neutral theory of molecular evolution</a>, sparking debates over <a href="/wiki/Adaptationism" id="w">adaptationism</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Units_of_selection" id="w">units of selection</a>, and the importance of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_drift" id="w">genetic drift</a>. In the late 20th century, genetic <a href="/wiki/Sequencing" id="w">sequencing</a> led to a reorganization of the tree of life into the <a href="/wiki/Three-domain_system" id="w">three-domain system</a>, and the newly-recognized factors of <a href="/wiki/Symbiogenesis" id="w">symbiogenesis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer" id="w">horizontal gene transfer</a> have introduced yet more complexity into evolutionary history.</p>

<p>Some <a href="/wiki/Greek_philosophers" id="w">Greek philosophers</a> discussed ideas that involved forms of organic evolution. <a href="/wiki/Anaximander" id="w">Anaximander</a> claimed that life had originally developed in the sea and only later moved onto land, and <a href="/wiki/Empedocles" id="w">Empedocles</a> also discussed a non-supernatural origin for living things.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Empedocles even suggested a form of <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" id="w">natural selection</a>, which Aristotle summarized as, &#34;Wherever then all the parts came about [to be] just what they would have been if they had come to be for an end, such things survived, being organized spontaneously in a fitting way; whereas those which grew otherwise perished and continue to perish...&#34;<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Plato_and_the_theory_of_forms" name="Plato_and_the_theory_of_forms"></a><h4>Plato and the theory of forms</h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Plato" id="w">Plato</a> (427/8–347/8 BC) was, in the words of biologist and historian <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Mayr" id="w">Ernst Mayr</a>, &#34;the great antihero of evolutionism,&#34;<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> as he established the philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Essentialism" id="w">essentialism</a>, which he called the <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_forms" id="w">theory of forms</a>. This theory holds that objects observed in the real world are only <i>reflections</i> of a limited number of essences (<i>eide</i>). Variation is merely the result of an imperfect reflection of these constant essences. In his <i>Timaeus</i>, Plato set forth the idea that God had created the <a href="/wiki/Cosmos" id="w">cosmos</a> and everything in it because He is good, and hence, &#34;... free from jealousy, He desired that all things should be as like Himself as they could be.&#34; God created all conceivable forms of life, since &#34;... without them the universe will be incomplete, for it will not contain every kind of animal which it ought to contain, if it is to be perfect.&#34; This idea, that all potential forms of life are essential to a perfect creation, is called the <a href="/wiki/Plenitude_principle" id="w">plenitude principle</a>, and it greatly influenced Christian thought.<sup id="_ref-oet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oet" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Aristotle_and_the_ladder_of_life" name="Aristotle_and_the_ladder_of_life"></a><h4>Aristotle and the ladder of life</h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Aristotle" id="w">Aristotle</a>, (384–322 BC), one of the most influential of the Greek philosophers, is the earliest natural historian whose work has come down to us in any real detail. His writings on biology, the result of his research into natural history on the isle of <a href="/wiki/Lesbos" id="w">Lesbos</a>, have survived in the form of four books, usually known by their <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> names,<sup id="_ref-Singer_SHB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Singer_SHB" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<ul>

<li><i><a href="/wiki/Parts_of_Animals" id="w">De partibus animalium</a></i> (anatomy)</li></ul>
<p>These works contain some remarkably astute observations and interpretations by Aristotle, along with sundry myths and mistakes &#8212; reflecting the uneven state of knowledge during his time. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible in observations on Lesbos, and available from the catches of fishermen. He separated the aquatic mammals from the fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē (<a href="/wiki/Selachians" id="w">selachians</a>). His description of the hectocotyl arm (see <a href="/wiki/Cephalopod" id="w">cephalopod</a>) was about two thousand years ahead of its time, and was in fact widely disbelieved until the nineteenth century. His observations on catfish, electric fish of the genus <a href="/wiki/Torpedo_(genus)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Torpedo&#39;&#39;</a>, and angler-fish are also exceptional, as is his writing on <a href="/wiki/Cephalopod" id="w">cephalopod</a> <a href="/wiki/Molluscs" id="w">molluscs</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Octopus" id="w">Octopus</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Sepia" id="w">cuttlefish</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Argonauta_argo" id="w">paper nautilus</a>.<sup id="_ref-Singer_SHB_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Singer_SHB" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>However, for <a href="/wiki/Charles_Singer" id="w">Charles Singer</a>, &#34;Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle&#39;s] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a <i>scala naturæ</i>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Singer_SHB_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Singer_SHB" title="">[5]</a></sup> This <i>scala naturæ</i>, described in <i>History of Animals</i>, classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical &#34;Ladder of Life&#34; or &#34;Chain of Being&#34;, placing them according to complexity of structure and function, with organisms that showed greater vitality and ability to move described as &#34;higher organisms&#34;.<sup id="_ref-oet_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oet" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Roman_thought" name="Roman_thought"></a><h3>Roman thought</h3>
<p>Titus <a href="/wiki/Lucretius" id="w">Lucretius</a> Carus (d. 50 BC), the Roman <a href="/wiki/Epicurean" id="w">Epicurean</a> and <a href="/wiki/Atomist" id="w">atomist</a>, wrote the poem <a href="/wiki/On_the_Nature_of_Things" id="w">On the Nature of Things</a> (<i>De rerum natura</i>), describing the development of the living earth in stages: from atoms colliding in the void as swirls of dust to early plants and animals springing from the early earth&#39;s substance, then a succession of animals, including a series of progressively less brutish humans. Lucretius may be seen as the earliest believer in <a href="/wiki/Hard_inheritance" id="w">hard inheritance</a>. He said &#34;For if each organism had not its own genetic bodies, how could we with certainty assign each to its mother?&#34;.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> The essence of Lucretius&#39; ideas was naturalism, and the avoidance of supernatural interventions or explanations.</p>

<p>During the so-called <a href="/wiki/Dark_Ages" id="w">Dark Ages</a>, Greek classical learning was all but lost to the West. However, contact with the <a href="/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age" id="w">Islamic world</a>, where Greek manuscripts were preserved and elaborated on, soon led to a massive spate of <a href="/wiki/Latin_translations_of_the_12th_century" id="w">Latin translations in the 12th century</a>. Europeans were thus re-introduced to the works of Plato and Aristotle, as well as <a href="/wiki/Early_Islamic_philosophy" id="w">Islamic thought</a>. <a href="/wiki/Christian_philosophy" id="w">Christian thinkers</a> combined Aristotlean classification with Plato&#39;s ideas of the goodness of God, and of all potential life forms being present in a perfect creation, to organize all inanimate, animate, and spiritual beings, into a huge interconnected system: the <i>Scala Naturæ</i>, or <a href="/wiki/Great_chain_of_being" id="w">great chain of being</a>.</p>
<p>Within this system, everything that existed could be placed in order, from &#34;lowest&#34; to &#34;highest&#34;, with Hell at the bottom and God at the top &#8212; below God, an angelic hierarchy marked by the orbits of the planets, mankind in an intermediate position, and worms the lowest of the animals. As the universe was ultimately perfect, the Great Chain was also perfect. There were no empty links in the chain, and no link was represented by more than one species. But this also implied that, since every link is occupied, and none can be occupied twice, then no species can ever move from one position to another. To do so would leave one level empty and put two species on another. Thus, in this Christianized version of Plato&#39;s perfect universe, species could never change, but must remain forever fixed, in accordance with the text of <i>Genesis</i>. For humans to forget their position was even seen as sinful, whether they behaved like lower animals or aspired to a higher station than was given them by their Creator. </p>
<p>Creatures on adjacent steps were expected to closely resemble each other, an idea expressed in a saying which <a href="/wiki/Charles_Darwin" id="w">Charles Darwin</a> often quoted: <i>natura non facit saltum</i> (&#34;nature does not make leaps&#34;).<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-oet_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oet" title="">[4]</a></sup> This basic concept of the great chain of being greatly influenced the thinking of <a href="/wiki/Western_civilization" id="w">Western civilization</a> for centuries (and still has an influence today). It also formed a part of the <a href="/wiki/Teleological_argument" id="w">argument from design</a> presented by <a href="/wiki/Natural_theology" id="w">natural theology</a>. As a classification system, it became the major organizing principle and foundation of the emerging science of <a href="/wiki/Biology" id="w">biology</a> in the 17th and 18th centuries.<sup id="_ref-oet_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oet" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

The word <i>evolution</i> (from the <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> <i>evolutio</i>, meaning &#34;to unroll like a scroll&#34;) appeared in English in the <a href="/wiki/17th_century" id="w">17th century</a>, referring to an orderly sequence of events, particularly one in which the outcome was somehow contained within it from the start. Notably, in 1677 Sir <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Hale" id="w">Matthew Hale</a>, attacking the <a href="/wiki/Atheist" id="w">atheistic</a> atomism of Democritus and Epicurus. used the term <i>evolution</i> to describe his opponent&#39;s ideas that vibrations and collisions of atoms in the void &#8212; without divine intervention &#8212; had formed &#34;Primordial Seeds&#34; (semina) which were the &#34;immediate, primitive, productive Principles of Men, Animals, Birds and Fishes.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Goodrum2002_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Goodrum2002" title="">[14]</a></sup> For Hale, this mechanism was &#34;absurd&#34;, because &#34;it must have potentially at least the whole Systeme of Humane Nature, or at least that Ideal Principle or Configuration thereof, in the <b>evolution</b> whereof the complement and formation of the Humane Nature must consist ... and all this drawn from a fortuitous coalition of senseless and dead Atoms.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Goodrum2002_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Goodrum2002" title="">[14]</a></sup> </p>
<p>While Hale (ironically) first used the term evolution in arguing <i>against</i> the exact mechanistic view the word would come to symbolize, he also demonstrates that at least some <a href="/wiki/Evolutionism" id="w">evolutionist</a> theories explored between 1650 and 1800 postulated that the universe, including life on earth, had developed mechanically, entirely without divine guidance. Around this time, the <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_philosophy" id="w">mechanical philosophy</a> of <a href="/wiki/Descartes" id="w">Descartes</a>, reinforced by the <a href="/wiki/Physics" id="w">physics</a> of <a href="/wiki/Galileo" id="w">Galileo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Newton" id="w">Newton</a>, began to encourage the machine-like view of the universe which would come to characterise the <a href="/wiki/Scientific_revolution" id="w">scientific revolution</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> However, most contemporary theories of evolution, including those developed by the German idealist philosophers <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_von_Schelling" id="w">Schelling</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hegel" id="w">Hegel</a> (and mocked by <a href="/wiki/Schopenhauer" id="w">Schopenhauer</a>), held that evolution was a fundamentally <i>spiritual</i> process, with the entire course of natural and human evolution being &#34;a self-disclosing revelation of the Absolute&#34;.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Typical of these theorists, <a href="/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz" id="w">Gottfried Leibniz</a> postulated in 1714 that &#34;<a href="/wiki/Monad" id="w">monads</a>&#34; inside objects caused motion by internal forces, and maintained that &#34;the &#39;germs&#39; of all things have always existed ... [and] contain within themselves an internal principle of development which drives them on through a vast series of metamorphoses&#34; to become the geological formations, lifeforms, psychologies, and civilizations of the present. Leibniz clearly felt that evolution proceeded on divine principles &#8212; in his <i>De rerum originatione radicali</i> (1697), he wrote: &#34;A cumulative increase of the beauty and universal perfection of the works of God, a perpetual and unrestricted progress of the universe as a whole must be recognized, such that it advances to a higher state of cultivation.&#34;<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Others, such as <a href="/wiki/J._G._von_Herder" id="w">J.

He thought that the members of what was then called a genus (which in terms of modern <a href="/wiki/Scientific_classification" id="w">scientific classification</a> would be considered a family) are all descended from a single, common ancestor. The ancestor of each family had arisen through <a href="/wiki/Spontaneous_generation" id="w">spontaneous generation</a>; environmental effects then caused them to diverge into different species. Buffon&#39;s concept of evolution was strictly limited.

<a href="/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck" id="w">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a> proposed in his <i>Philosophie Zoologique</i> of 1809 a theory of the <a href="/wiki/Transmutation_of_species" id="w">transmutation of species</a>. Lamarck did not believe that all living things shared a common ancestor. Rather he believed that simple forms of life were created continuously by <a href="/wiki/Spontaneous_generation" id="w">spontaneous generation</a>. He also believed that an innate life force, which he sometimes described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck also recognized that species were adapted to their environment. He explained this observation by saying that the same nervous fluid driving increasing complexity, also caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of that organ, just as muscles are affected by exercise. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that became closely associated with his name and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> </p>

<p>The computing pioneer <a href="/wiki/Charles_Babbage" id="w">Charles Babbage</a> published his unofficial <i>Ninth <a href="/wiki/Bridgewater_Treatise" id="w">Bridgewater Treatise</a></i> in 1837, putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with <i>ad hoc</i> miracles each time a new species was required. In 1844 the Scottish publisher <a href="/wiki/Robert_Chambers" id="w">Robert Chambers</a> anonymously published an influential, and extremely controversial book of popular science entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Vestiges_of_the_Natural_History_of_Creation" id="w">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</a></i>. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for the origins of the solar system and life on earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals with current animals being branches off a main line that lead progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Robert Grant, but its implication that humans were just the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. Both conservatives like Adam Sedgwick, and radical materialists like <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley" id="w">Thomas Henry Huxley</a>, who disliked Chambers&#39; implications of preordained progress, were able to find scientific inaccuracies in the book that they could disparage.

<p>Ideas about the transmutation of species were strongly associated with the radical materialism of the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" id="w">enlightenment</a> and were greeted with hostility by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and <a href="/wiki/Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire" id="w">Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</a>, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by re-population, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier&#39;s arguments and his reputation as a leading scientist helped keep transmutational ideas out of the scientific mainstream for decades.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In Britain, where the philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Natural_theology" id="w">natural theology</a> remained influential, <a href="/wiki/William_Paley" id="w">William Paley</a> wrote the book <i>Natural Theology</i> with its famous <a href="/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy" id="w">watchmaker analogy</a>, at least in part as a response to the transmutational ideas of <a href="/wiki/Erasmus_Darwin" id="w">Erasmus Darwin</a>.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Geologists influenced by natural theology, such as Buckland and Sedgwick, made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck and Grant, and Sedgwick wrote a famously harsh review of <i>The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</i>.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Although the geologist <a href="/wiki/Charles_Lyell" id="w">Charles Lyell</a> opposed scriptural geology he also believed in the immutability of species, and in his <i>Principles of Geology</i> (1830–1833), criticized and dismissed Lamarck&#39;s theories of development.

Another source of opposition to transmutation was a school of naturalists who were influenced by the German philosophers and naturalists associated with <a href="/wiki/Idealism" id="w">idealism</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Goethe" id="w">Goethe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hegel" id="w">Hegel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lorenz_Oken" id="w">Lorenz Oken</a>. Idealists such as <a href="/wiki/Louis_Agassiz" id="w">Louis Agassiz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Owen" id="w">Richard Owen</a> believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in <a href="/wiki/Embryology" id="w">embryology</a>, as well as in the fossil record: but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of &#34;archetypes&#34; in the Divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as <a href="/wiki/Vertebrate" id="w">vertebrate</a> limbs. Owen was concerned by the political implications of the ideas of transmutationists like Robert Grant, and he led a public campaign by conservatives that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. In his famous 1841 paper, which coined the term dinosaur for the giant reptiles discovered by Buckland and <a href="/wiki/Gideon_Mantell" id="w">Gideon Mantell</a>, Owen argued that these reptiles contradicted the transmutational ideas of Lamarck because they were more sophisticated than the reptiles of the modern world. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, along with the controversy surrounding <i>Vestiges</i>, would be major factors in his decision to delay publishing his ideas.<sup id="_ref-Bowler120-129_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler120-129" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>

<p>Several writers anticipated aspects of Darwin&#39;s theory, and in the third edition of <i><a href="/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species" id="w">On the Origin of Species</a></i> published in 1861 he named those he had learnt about in an introductory appendix, <i>An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species</i>, which he added to in later editions.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were unaware of this work when they jointly published the theory in 1858, but Darwin later acknowledged that Wells had recognised the principle before them, writing that the paper &#34;An Account of a White Female, part of whose Skin resembles that of a Negro&#34; was published in 1818, and &#34;he distinctly recognises the principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition which has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man, and to certain characters alone.&#34;<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> When Darwin was developing his theory, he was influenced by <a href="/wiki/A._P._de_Candolle" id="w">Augustin de Candolle</a>&#39;s <i>natural system</i> of classification, which laid emphasis on the war between competing species.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Patrick_Matthew" id="w">Patrick Matthew</a> wrote in the obscure book <i>Naval Timber &#38; Arboriculture</i> that was published in 1831 of &#34;continual balancing of life to circumstance. ...

In the brief historical sketch that Darwin included in the 3rd addition he says &#34;Unfortunately the view was given by Mr. Matthew very briefly in an Appendix to a work on a different subject ...

<p>It is important to understand that it is possible to look through the history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Darwin&#39;s key ideas. However, there are at least three major differences between Darwin and his predecessors. Perhaps the most important difference is that the vast majority of Darwin&#39;s predecessors seem to have failed to understand the implications of their own ideas. As an example, Matthew chose to relegate his idea on natural selection to the appendix of a work on an unrelated subject, and William Charles Wells seems to have made little or no attempts to publicise his ideas beyond reading them to the Royal Society. Secondly, despite having enunciated the basic idea of natural selection, precursors of Darwin either assumed that it was self-evidently true, or gave merely <i>logical</i> arguments for its importance and failed to provide any <a href="/wiki/Empirical" id="w">empirical</a> data. In other words, the anticipations of Darwin were merely formal and verbal. Finally, there is Darwin&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Naturalism" id="w">naturalism</a>. As numerous <a href="/wiki/Arabic" id="w">Arabic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Muslim" id="w">Muslim</a> authors have pointed out, earlier Islamic scientists such as <a href="/wiki/Al-Jahiz" id="w">al-Jahiz</a> did not only enunciate an early theory of natural selection, but also provided some empirical evidence for it. But these theories were placed in an <a href="/wiki/Islamic" id="w">Islamic</a> context, and presupposed a <a href="/wiki/Deity" id="w">Deity</a>.

Concerned by the intense controversy raging over other transmutational ideas, Darwin would develop this idea in private for the next 20 years, sharing it only with a handful of friendly naturalists through correspondence.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Unlike Darwin, <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace" id="w">Alfred Russel Wallace</a>, influenced by the book <i>Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</i>, already believed that transmutation of species occurred when he began his career as a naturalist. By 1855 his biogeographical observations during his field work in <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South America</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Malay_Archipelago" id="w">Malay Archipelago</a> made him confident enough in a branching pattern of evolution to publish a paper that stated that every species originated in close proximity to an already existing closely allied species. Once again it was consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that lead Wallace to conclusions very similar to the ones reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection. In February 1858 Wallace, unaware of Darwin&#39;s unpublished ideas, wrote up his thoughts into an essay and mailed them to Darwin, asking for his opinion. The result was the joint <a href="/wiki/Publication_of_Darwin%26%2339%3Bs_theory" id="w">publication of Darwin&#39;s theory</a> of natural selection with Wallace in July. Darwin also began work in earnest on <i>The Origin of Species</i>, which he would publish in 1859.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>

<p>While transmutation of species was accepted by a sizable number of scientists before 1859, it was the publication of Charles Darwin&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species" id="w">On the Origin of Species</a></i> that fundamentally transformed the debate over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.<sup id="_ref-Larson79-111_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson79-111" title="">[55]</a></sup> </p>
<p>One of the first and most important naturalists to be convinced by <i>Origin</i> was the British anatomist <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley" id="w">Thomas Henry Huxley</a>. Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Lamarck and <i>Vestiges</i>, Darwin&#39;s theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of the program of the <a href="/wiki/X-club" id="w">X-club</a> to reform and professionalize science by displacing <a href="/wiki/Natural_theology" id="w">natural theology</a> with <a href="/wiki/Methodological_naturalism" id="w">methodological naturalism</a>, ending the domination of British natural science by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species.<sup id="_ref-Larson79-111_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson79-111" title="">[55]</a></sup> In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin&#39;s theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of <a href="/wiki/Archaeopteryx" id="w">Archaeopteryx</a> in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in North America. Another important line of evidence involved fossils that helped trace the <a href="/wiki/Evolution_of_the_horse" id="w">evolution of the horse</a> from its small five-toed ancestors.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as France, and the countries of southern Europe and Latin America was slower. An exception to this was Germany, where both <a href="/wiki/August_Weismann" id="w">August Weismann</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel" id="w">Ernst Haeckel</a> championed this idea: with Haeckel using evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>Darwin&#39;s theory succeeded in profoundly shaking scientific opinion regarding the development of life and resulted in a small social revolution. However, this theory could not explain several critical components of the evolutionary process. Namely, Darwin was unable to explain the source of variation in traits within a species, and could not identify a mechanism that could pass traits faithfully from one generation to the next. Darwin&#39;s hypothesis of <a href="/wiki/Pangenesis" id="w">pangenesis</a>, while relying in part on the inheritance of acquired characteristics, proved to be useful for statistical models of evolution that were developed by his cousin <a href="/wiki/Francis_Galton" id="w">Francis Galton</a> and the &#34;biometric&#34; school of evolutionary thought. This idea was, however, of little use to biologists.</p>

</p>
<p>Charles Darwin was aware of the severe reaction in some parts of the scientific community against the suggestion made in <i>Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</i> that humans had arisen from animals by a process of transmutation. Therefore he almost completely ignored the topic of <a href="/wiki/Human_evolution" id="w">human evolution</a> in <i>The Origin of Species</i>. Despite this precaution, the issue featured prominently in the debate that followed the book&#39;s publication. For most of the first half of the 19th century the scientific community believed that, although geology had shown that the earth and life were very old, human beings had appeared suddenly just a few thousand years before the present. However, a series of archaeological discoveries in the 1840s and 1850s showed stone tools associated with the remains of extinct animals. By the early 1860s, as summarized in Charles Lyell&#39;s 1863 book <i>Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man</i>, it had become widely accepted that humans had existed during a prehistoric period - which stretched many thousands of years before the start of written history. This new view of human history was more compatible than the older one with an evolutionary origin for humanity. On the other hand, there was no fossil evidence of human evolution known at the time, since the only human fossils discovered prior to the very end of the 19th century were of anatomically modern humans, or of very similar <a href="/wiki/Neanderthals" id="w">Neanderthals</a>.<sup id="_ref-Bowler207-216_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler207-216" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>Therefore the debate that immediately followed the publication of <i>The Origin of Species</i> centered on the similarities and differences between humans and modern <a href="/wiki/Apes" id="w">apes</a>. Richard Owen vigorously defended the traditional classification, suggested by <a href="/wiki/Carolus_Linnaeus" id="w">Carolus Linnaeus</a> and Cuvier, that placed humans in a completely separate order from any of the other mammals. On the other hand, Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between humans and apes. In one very famous incident, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of <a href="/wiki/Gorillas" id="w">gorillas</a> lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book <i>Evidence as to Man&#39;s place in Nature</i>. Another viewpoint was advocated by Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. They agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could account for some of the differences between humans and apes, especially some aspects of the human mind.<sup id="_ref-Bowler207-216_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler207-216" title="">[58]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1871 Darwin published <i><a href="/wiki/The_Descent_of_Man%2C_and_Selection_in_Relation_to_Sex" id="w">The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</a></i>, which contained his views on human evolution. Darwin argued that the differences between the human mind and the minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He believed that all the differences between humans and apes could be explained by a combination of the selective pressures resulting from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and <a href="/wiki/Sexual_selection" id="w">sexual selection</a>. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness would continue well into the 20th century.<sup id="_ref-Bowler207-216_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler207-216" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>

Evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles within a few years after the publication of <i>Origin</i>, but the acceptance of <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" id="w">natural selection</a> as its driving mechanism was much less widespread. There were a variety of reasons for this. Natural selection, with its emphasis on death and competition, did not appeal to many naturalists because they felt it was immoral and left little room for <a href="/wiki/Teleology" id="w">teleology</a> (purpose) or the concept of &#34;progress&#34; in the development of life. In addition, some felt that natural selection would be too slow, given the estimates of the age of the earth and sun (10–100 million years) being made at the time by physicists such as <a href="/wiki/Lord_Kelvin" id="w">Lord Kelvin</a>. Another objection was that natural selection could not work because at the time the models for inheritance involved blending of inherited characteristics. The four major alternatives to natural selection in the late 19th century, were <a href="/wiki/Theistic_evolution" id="w">theistic evolution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neo-Lamarckism" id="w">neo-Lamarckism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orthogenesis" id="w">orthogenesis</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Saltationism" id="w">saltationism</a>.<sup id="_ref-Larson105-129_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson105-129" title="">[59]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Bowler196-250_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler196-250" title="">[60]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="Theistic_evolution" name="Theistic_evolution"></a><h5>Theistic evolution</h5>
<p>Theistic evolution was the idea that a <a href="/wiki/God" id="w">God</a> intervened in the process of evolution to guide it in such a way that the living world could still be considered to be designed. Some of its advocates included <a href="/wiki/Asa_Gray" id="w">Asa Gray</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Jackson_Mivart" id="w">George Jackson Mivart</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/George_Campbell%2C_8th_Duke_of_Argyll" id="w">Duke of Argyle</a>. However, this idea rapidly fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of <a href="/wiki/Methodological_naturalism" id="w">methodological naturalism</a> and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive and a form of <a href="/wiki/Special_pleading" id="w">special pleading</a>. By 1900 it had completely disappeared from mainstream scientific discussions, although it continued to be used as a way to reconcile religious belief with scientific discoveries among non-scientists.<sup id="_ref-Larson105-129_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson105-129" title="">[59]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Bowler196-250_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler196-250" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Neo-Lamarckism" name="Neo-Lamarckism"></a><h5>Neo-Lamarckism</h5>
<p>The term Lamarckism was used for the idea that characteristics acquired during the course of an organism&#39;s life, such as changes caused by the use or disuse of a particular organ, could be inherited by the next generation. Although Wallace completely rejected the concept in favor of natural selection, Darwin had included it in the first edition of <i>The Origin of Species</i> as a possible supplemental mechanism of evolution. In the late 19th century the term <a href="/wiki/Neo-Lamarckism" id="w">neo-Lamarckism</a> came to be associated with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Butler_(novelist)" id="w">Samuel Butler</a>, the German biologist <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel" id="w">Ernst Haeckel</a>, and the American paleontologist <a href="/wiki/Edward_Drinker_Cope" id="w">Edward Drinker Cope</a>. They considered Lamarckism to be philosophically superior to Darwin&#39;s idea of selection acting on random variation. Butler and Cope both believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution, since organisms that developed new behaviors would change the patterns of use of their organs and thus kick-start the evolutionary process. In addition, Cope and Haeckel both believed that evolution was a progressive process. Cope looked for, and thought he found, patterns of linear progression in the fossil record. The idea of linear progress was also an important part of Haeckel&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Recapitulation_theory" id="w">recapitulation theory</a> of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history.<sup id="_ref-Larson105-129_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson105-129" title="">[59]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Bowler196-250_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler196-250" title="">[60]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Critics of neo-Lamarckism pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The experimental work of the German biologist <a href="/wiki/August_Weismann" id="w">August Weismann</a> resulted in the <a href="/wiki/Germ_plasm_theory" id="w">germ plasm theory</a> of inheritance. This led him to declare that inheritance of acquired charateristics was flatly impossible, since the <a href="/wiki/Weismann_barrier" id="w">Weismann barrier</a> would prevent any changes that occurred to the body after birth from being inherited by the next generation. Despite these criticisms, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.<sup id="_ref-Larson105-129_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson105-129" title="">[59]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Bowler196-250_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler196-250" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Orthogenesis" name="Orthogenesis"></a><h5>Orthogenesis</h5>
<p>Orthogenesis or orthogenetic evolution was the <a href="/wiki/Hypothesis" id="w">hypothesis</a> that life has an innate tendency to change, in a unilinear fashion, towards ever-greater perfection. It had a significant following in the <a href="/wiki/19th_century" id="w">19th century</a>, and its proponents included the Russian biologist Leo Berg, and the American paleontologist <a href="/wiki/Henry_Fairfield_Osborn" id="w">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a>. Orthogenesis was particularly popular among some paleontologists, who believed that the fossil record showed a gradual and constant unidirectional change.  Those who accepted this idea, however, did not necessarily accept that the mechanism driving orthogenesis was <a href="/wiki/Teleological" id="w">teleological</a> (goal-directed). The orthogenesis hypothesis began to collapse when it became clear that it could not explain the patterns found by <a href="/wiki/Paleontology" id="w">paleontologists</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Fossil_record" id="w">fossil record</a>, which were non-linear and contained many complications.  A few hung on to the orthogenesis hypothesis as late as the <a href="/wiki/1950s" id="w">1950s</a> by claiming that the processes of <a href="/wiki/Macroevolution" id="w">macroevolution</a>, the long term trends in evolution, were distinct from the processes of <a href="/wiki/Microevolution" id="w">microevolution</a>.<sup id="_ref-Larson105-129_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson105-129" title="">[59]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Bowler196-250_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler196-250" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Saltationism" name="Saltationism"></a><h5>Saltationism</h5>
<p>Saltationism was the idea that new species arise as a result of large mutations. It was seen as a much faster alternative to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was very popular with early geneticists such as <a href="/wiki/Hugo_DeVries" id="w">Hugo DeVries</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Bateson" id="w">William Bateson</a>, and early in his career, <a href="/wiki/T._H._Morgan" id="w">T.

<a id="Mendelian_genetics%2C_biometrics%2C_and_mutation" name="Mendelian_genetics%2C_biometrics%2C_and_mutation"></a><h4>Mendelian genetics, biometrics, and mutation</h4>
<p>The rediscovery of <a href="/wiki/Gregor_Mendel" id="w">Gregor Mendel</a>&#39;s laws of inheritance in 1900 ignited a fierce debate between two camps of biologists. In one camp were the <a href="/wiki/Mendelian" id="w">Mendelians</a>, who were focused on discrete variations and the laws of inheritance. They were led by <a href="/wiki/William_Bateson" id="w">William Bateson</a> (who coined the word <a href="/wiki/Genetics" id="w">genetics</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Hugo_de_Vries" id="w">Hugo de Vries</a> (who coined the word <a href="/wiki/Mutation" id="w">mutation</a>). Their opponents were the biometricians, who were interested in the continuous variation of characteristics within populations. Their leaders, <a href="/wiki/Karl_Pearson" id="w">Karl Pearson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Walter_Frank_Raphael_Weldon" id="w">Walter Frank Raphael Weldon</a>, followed in the tradition of <a href="/wiki/Francis_Galton" id="w">Francis Galton</a> - who had focused on measurement and statistical analysis of variation within a population. The biometricians rejected Mendelian genetics because they felt that discrete units of heredity, such as genes, could not explain the continuous range of variation seen in wild populations. Weldon&#39;s work with crabs and snails provided evidence that selection pressure from environmental factors really could shift the range of variation in real world populations, but the Mendelians maintained that the variations measured by biometricians were too insignificant to account for the evolution of new species.<sup id="_ref-Bowler256-273_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler256-273" title="">[61]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Larson153-174_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson153-174" title="">[62]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When <a href="/wiki/T._H._Morgan" id="w">T. H. Morgan</a> began experimenting with breeding the fruit fly <a href="/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster" id="w">Drosophila melanogaster</a> he was a saltationist who hoped to demonstrate that a new species could be created in the lab by mutation alone. Instead, the work at his lab between 1910 and 1915 reconfirmed Mendelian genetics and provided solid experimental evidence linking it to chromosomal inheritance. It also demonstrated that most mutations had relatively small affects (such as a change in eye color), and that rather than creating a new species in a single step, they served to increase variation within the existing population.<sup id="_ref-Bowler256-273_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler256-273" title="">[61]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Larson153-174_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson153-174" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>

<p>Eventually, the Mendelian and biometrician models were reconciled and merged during the development of the discipline of <a href="/wiki/Population_genetics" id="w">population genetics</a>. A key part of this development was the work of the British biologist and statistician <a href="/wiki/R.A._Fisher" id="w">R.A. Fisher</a>. In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book <i>Genetical Theory of Natural Selection</i> Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" id="w">natural selection</a> could change <a href="/wiki/Gene_frequencies" id="w">gene frequencies</a> in a population, driving evolution. In a series of papers starting in 1924 another British geneticist, <a href="/wiki/J.B.S._Haldane" id="w">J.B.S. Haldane</a>, applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the <a href="/wiki/Peppered_moth_evolution" id="w">evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths</a>, and showed that natural selection worked at a faster rate than even Fisher had thought possible. The American biologist <a href="/wiki/Sewall_Wright" id="w">Sewall Wright</a>, who had a background in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, and the effects of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations that exhibited <a href="/wiki/Genetic_drift" id="w">genetic drift</a>. In 1932 Wright introduced the concept of an <a href="/wiki/Adaptive_landscape" id="w">adaptive landscape</a> and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small isolated sub-populations away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane, and Wright founded the discipline of <a href="/wiki/Population_genetics" id="w">population genetics</a>, which integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics.<sup id="_ref-Bowler325-339_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler325-339" title="">[63]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Larson221-243_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson221-243" title="">[64]</a></sup>     </p>

<p>In the first couple of decades of the 20th century most field naturalists continued to believe that Lamarckian and orthogenic mechanisms of evolution provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. However, as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. <a href="/wiki/Theodosius_Dobzhansky" id="w">Theodosius Dobzhansky</a> had been a postdoctoral worker in T. H. Morgan&#39;s lab and had been influenced by the work on genetic diversity done by <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russian</a> geneticists such as <a href="/wiki/Sergei_Chetverikov" id="w">Sergei Chetverikov</a>. He would help to bridge the divide between the population geneticists and the field biologists with his 1937 book <i>Genetics and the origin of species</i>. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations, and showed that contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into more accessible form. <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Mayr" id="w">Ernst Mayr</a> was influenced by the work of the <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> biologist <a href="/wiki/Bernhard_Rensch" id="w">Bernhard Rensch</a> on how local environmental factors influenced the geographic distribution of sub-species and closely related species. Mayr followed up on Dobzhansky&#39;s work with the 1942 book <i>Systematics and the Origin of Species</i>, which emphasized the importance of <a href="/wiki/Allopatric_speciation" id="w">allopatric speciation</a> in the formation of new species. This form of speciation occurs when geographical isolation of a sub-population is followed by the development of mechanisms for <a href="/wiki/Reproductive_isolation" id="w">reproductive isolation</a>. Mayr also formulated the <a href="/wiki/Biological_species_concept" id="w">biological species concept</a> that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations. In the 1944 book <i>Mode and Tempo in Evolution</i> <a href="/wiki/George_Gaylord_Simpson" id="w">George Gaylord Simpson</a> showed that the fossil record was consistent with the irregular non-directional pattern predicted by the developing evolutionary synthesis, and that the linear trends that earlier paleontologists had claimed supported orthogenesis and neo-Lamarckism did not hold up to closer examination. In 1950 <a href="/wiki/G._Ledyard_Stebbins" id="w">G. Ledyard Stebbins</a> published <i><a href="/wiki/Variation_and_Evolution_in_Plants" id="w">Variation and Evolution in Plants</a></i>, which helped integrate <a href="/wiki/Botany" id="w">botany</a> into the synthesis. The emerging cross-discipline consensus on how evolution worked would be known as the <a href="/wiki/Modern_evolutionary_synthesis" id="w">modern evolutionary synthesis</a>. It received its name from the book <i>Evolution: the modern synthesis</i> by <a href="/wiki/Julian_Huxley" id="w">Julian Huxley</a>.<sup id="_ref-Bowler325-339_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bowler325-339" title="">[63]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Larson221-243_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Larson221-243" title="">[64]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the mid-1960s, <a href="/wiki/George_C._Williams" id="w">George C.

<p>In 1973 <a href="/wiki/Leigh_Van_Valen" id="w">Leigh Van Valen</a> proposed the term <a href="/wiki/Red_Queen" id="w">Red Queen</a>, which he took from <i><a href="/wiki/Through_the_Looking_Glass" id="w">Through the Looking Glass</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Carroll" id="w">Lewis Carroll</a>, to describe a scenario where a species involved in one or more <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_arms_race" id="w">evolutionary arms races</a> would have to constantly change just to keep pace with the species it was <a href="/wiki/Co-evolving" id="w">co-evolving</a> with. Hamilton, Williams and others suggested that this idea might help explain the <a href="/wiki/Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction" id="w">evolution of sexual reproduction</a>, because the increased genetic diversity caused by sexual reproduction would help maintain resistance against rapidly evolving parasites. They felt this might explain why sexual reproduction was so common despite the tremendous cost from the gene-centric point of view of a system where only half of an organism&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Genome" id="w">genome</a> is passed on during reproduction.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> The gene-centric view has also led to an increased interest in Darwin&#39;s old idea of <a href="/wiki/Sexual_selection" id="w">sexual selection</a>,<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> and  more recently in topics such as <a href="/wiki/Sexual_conflict" id="w">sexual conflict</a> and <a href="/wiki/Intragenomic_conflict" id="w">intragenomic conflict</a>.</p>

There was a renewal of <a href="/wiki/Structuralism" id="w">structuralist</a> themes in evolutionary biology in the work of biologists such as <a href="/wiki/Brian_Goodwin" id="w">Brian Goodwin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman" id="w">Stuart Kauffman</a>, which incorporated ideas from <a href="/wiki/Cybernetics" id="w">cybernetics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Systems_theory" id="w">systems theory</a>, and emphasized the <a href="/wiki/Self-organization" id="w">self-organizing</a> processes of development as factors directing the course of evolution.

<p>Molecular data regarding the mechanisms underlying <a href="/wiki/Developmental_biology" id="w">development</a> accumulated rapidly during the 1980s and &#39;90s. For example, it became clear that the diversity of animal morphology was not the result of different sets of proteins regulating the development of different animals, but from changes in the deployment of a small set of proteins that were common to all animals.<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup> These proteins became known as the <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology#The developmental-genetic toolkit" id="w">&#34;developmental toolkit&#34;</a>.<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup> These various perspectives came to inform the disciplines of <a href="/wiki/Phylogenetics" id="w">phylogenetics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paleontology" id="w">paleontology</a> and comparative developmental biology, spawning the new discipline of &#34;evo-devo.&#34;<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup></p>
