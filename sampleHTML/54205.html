A <b>diaper</b> (in <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a>) or <b>nappy</b> (in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>, many <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth countries</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a>) is an absorbent <a href="/wiki/Garment" id="w">garment</a> worn by individuals who are incapable of controlling their <a href="/wiki/Urinary_bladder" id="w"> bladder</a> or <a href="/wiki/Bowel" id="w">bowel</a> movements, or are unable or unwilling to use a <a href="/wiki/Toilet" id="w">toilet</a>.  The purpose of a diaper is to absorb moisture and contain mess so that the wearer can remain dry and comfortable after wetting or soiling themselves.  When diapers become full and can no longer hold any more waste, they require changing; this process is often performed by a secondary person such as a parent or caregiver.  Failure to change a diaper on a regular enough basis can result in <a href="/wiki/Diaper_rash" id="w">diaper rash</a>.</p>
<p>Diapers have been worn all throughout human history, and can be made of either <a href="/wiki/Cloth" id="w">cloth</a> or <a href="/wiki/Disposable" id="w">disposable</a> materials.  Whereas cloth diapers are comprised of layers of fabric such as terry towelling and can be washed and reused multiple times, disposable diapers contain absorbent chemicals and can be thrown away after use.  The decision to use cloth or disposable diapers is a controversial one, due to issues ranging from convenience, health, cost, and their effect on the environment.  Currently, disposable diapers are the most commonly used, with <a href="/wiki/Pampers" id="w">Pampers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Huggies" id="w">Huggies</a> being the most well-known brands in the industry.  <a href="/wiki/Plastic_pants" id="w">Plastic pants</a> can be worn over diapers to avoid leaks.</p>
<p>Diapers are primarily worn by <a href="/wiki/Infant" id="w">infants</a> and <a href="/wiki/Children" id="w">children</a> who are not yet <a href="/wiki/Toilet_training" id="w">potty trained</a> or suffer from <a href="/wiki/Bedwetting" id="w">bedwetting</a>.  However, they can also be used by adults who suffer from <a href="/wiki/Urinary_incontinence" id="w">incontinence</a> or in certain circumstances where access to a toilet is unavailable.  These can include the elderly, those with a physical or <a href="/wiki/Mental_illness" id="w">mental</a> <a href="/wiki/Disability" id="w">disability</a>, and people working in extreme conditions such as <a href="/wiki/Astronaut" id="w">astronauts</a>.  Diapers are usually worn out of necessity rather than choice, although there are exceptions; people such as <a href="/wiki/Paraphilic_infantilism" id="w">infantilists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Diaper_fetishism" id="w">diaper fetishists</a> wear diapers willingly for comfort, emotional fulfillment, or sexual gratification.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>

<p>The problem of clothing infants not yet potty trained is as old as human history.  In ancient times, babies would be dressed in natural resources such as leaf wraps and animals skins, with the <a href="/wiki/Inuit" id="w">Inuit</a> making diapers out of moss and sealskin and <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" id="w">Native Americans</a> packing grass under a cover made of rabbit skin.  European societies would wrap their children in strips of <a href="/wiki/Linen" id="w">linen</a> or <a href="/wiki/Wool" id="w">wool</a> known as swaddling bands, and in <a href="/wiki/Elizabethan" id="w">Elizabethan</a> times, children would only have their diapers changed every few days.<sup id="_ref-DiaperHistory_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DiaperHistory" title="">[1]</a></sup>  In countries with warmer climates, babies were kept naked and mothers tried to anticipate their bowel movements so as to avoid mess near their living areas.  This method is known as <a href="/wiki/Elimination_communication" id="w">elimination communication</a> and is still used today in some cultures.<sup id="_ref-Elimination_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Elimination" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the pioneering days, soiled diapers were rarely washed but simply dried and reused.  This resulted in serious skin rashes, and it wasn&#39;t until the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" id="w">Industrial Revolution</a>, when people had acquired enough money to buy household furniture, that parents began to make an effort to contain and dispose of their children&#39;s waste more carefully.  In the nineteenth century, the modern diaper began to take shape and children in Europe and North America were being diapered using cotton material, held in place with a <a href="/wiki/Safety_pin" id="w">safety pin</a>.  Cloth diapers were first mass produced in <a href="/wiki/1887" id="w">1887</a> by Maria Allen in the United States.<sup id="_ref-DiaperEvolution_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DiaperEvolution" title="">[3]</a></sup>  When society gained a better understanding of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, mothers began washing their babies&#39; diapers in boiling water in order to reduce the problem of diaper rash.<sup id="_ref-DiaperHistory_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DiaperHistory" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/20th_century" id="w">20th century</a>, the disposable diaper gradually evolved through the inventions of several different people.  In <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>, a Swedish paper company known as PauliStróm created the first disposable diaper using sheets of tissue placed inside <a href="/wiki/Rubber_pants" id="w">rubber pants</a>.  Four years later, a Westport housewife called Marion Donovan developed a waterproof diaper cover known as the &#34;Boater&#34; using a sheet of plastic from a shower curtain; she was granted four <a href="/wiki/Patents" id="w">patents</a> for her invention, including the use of plastic snaps as opposed to safety pins.  In <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a>, a man named George M. Schroder invented the first ever diaper with disposable nonwoven fabric.  Disposable diapers were introduced to the US in <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a> by a project called J&#38;J, and were considered one of the great inventions.<sup id="_ref-DiaperHistory_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DiaperHistory" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DiaperEvolution_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DiaperEvolution" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DiaperTimeline_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DiaperTimeline" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Milestones_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milestones" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/1950s" id="w">1950s</a>, companies such as Kendall, <a href="/wiki/Parke-Davis" id="w">Parke-Davis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Playtex" id="w">Playtex</a>, and Molnlycke entered the disposable diaper market. In <a href="/wiki/1956" id="w">1956</a>, <a href="/wiki/Procter_and_Gamble" id="w">Procter and Gamble</a> began researching disposable diapers.  Vic Mills, a man who worked for the company, invented &#34;Pampers&#34; while searching for a better product to use on his grandson.  Although Pampers were conceptualized in <a href="/wiki/1959" id="w">1959</a>, the diapers themselves were not launched into the market until <a href="/wiki/1961" id="w">1961</a>.  Over the next few decades, the disposable diaper industry boomed and the competition between Procter and Gamble&#39;s Pampers and <a href="/wiki/Kimberly_Clark" id="w">Kimberly Clark</a>&#39;s Huggies resulted in lower prices and drastic changes to diaper design.  Several improvements were made, such as the introduction of refastenable tapes, the &#34;hourglass shape&#34; so as to reduce bulk at the crotch area, and the invention of &#34;super-absorbent&#34; material.<sup id="_ref-DiaperHistory_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DiaperHistory" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DiaperEvolution_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DiaperEvolution" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DiaperTimeline_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DiaperTimeline" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Milestones_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milestones" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h3>Etymology</h3>

<p>The first known appearance of the word in writing is in  <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" id="w">Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew" id="w">The Taming of the Shrew</a></i>: &#34;Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper&#34;.  The word <i>diaper</i> originally referred to the type of cloth rather than its use; &#34;diaper&#34; was the term for a pattern of small repeated geometric shapes, and later came to describe a white cotton or linen fabric with this pattern. The first cloth diapers consisted of a special type of soft tissue sheet, cut into geometric shapes. This type of pattern was called <a href="/wiki/Diapering" id="w">diapering</a> and eventually gave its name to the cloth used to make diapers and then to the diaper itself.  This usage stuck in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, but in <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">Britain</a> the word &#34;nappy&#34; took its place.  Most sources believe <i>nappy</i> is a diminutive form of the word <a href="/wiki/Napkin" id="w">napkin</a>,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> but others trace it to <i>Nap</i>, a kind of short fiber which creates a hair-like surface on cloth and is sometimes used to make diapers.<sup id="_ref-WordOrigin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WordOrigin" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Likewise, most sources agree that <i>diaper</i> in the sense of underwear comes from <i>diaper</i> in the heraldry sense<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>, but according to Mrs Charles H. Ashdown, in her book &#39;British Costume from Earliest Times to 1820&#39;, diaper cloth originated from Ipre (now <a href="/wiki/Ypres" id="w">Ypres</a>) in Flanders and was called D&#39;Ipre; however this seems unlikely in light of the history given above, and the fact that the most probable original pronunciation of <i>diaper</i> was with the <i>a</i> distinctly pronounced, as indeed some people still pronounce it today.</p>

Since their introduction several decades ago, product innovations include the use of super-absorbent polymers, resealable tapes and elasticised waist bands. They are now much thinner and much more absorbent. The product range has more recently been extended into children’s toilet-training phase with the introduction of training pants and pant diapers.   </p>
<p>Modern baby diapers and incontinence products have a layered construction, which allows the transfer and distribution of urine to an absorbent core structure where it is locked in. </p>

<ul>
<li>The topsheet closest to the skin is made of soft nonwoven fabric and transfers urine quickly to the layers underneath;</li>
<li>The distribution layer receives the urine flow and transfers it on to the absorbent core;  </li>
<li>The absorbent core structure is the key component and is made out of a mixture of cellulose pulp and superabsorbent polymers;  </li>
<li>The backsheet is typically made of ‘breathable’ polyethylene film or a nonwoven and film composite which prevents wetness transfer to the bed or clothes.</li></ul>
<p>The market for disposable diapers in rich countries is many times larger than the market for cloth diapers. Approximately 18 billion units of disposable diapers were sold in the USA in 2004.</p>
<a id="Cloth" name="Cloth"></a><h3>Cloth</h3>

<p>Cloth diapers are reusable and can be made from natural fibers, man made materials, or a combination of both. They are often made from industrial <a href="/wiki/Cotton" id="w">cotton</a> which may be <a href="/wiki/Bleach" id="w">bleached</a> white or left a natural color. Other natural materials (often grown without pesticides), such as wool, bamboo, unbleached <a href="/wiki/Hemp" id="w">hemp</a>, are also used. Man made materials such as <a href="/wiki/Microfiber" id="w">microfiber</a> toweling (for absorbency), or PUL aka <a href="/wiki/Polyurethane_laminate" id="w">polyurethane laminate</a> (for a waterproof layer) may be used.  Another popular non-natural fiber is polyester fleece and faux suedecloth, used inside cloth diapers as a &#34;stay-dry&#34; wicking liner, because of the non-absorbent properties of synthetic fibers. Elastic is also commonly used.
Pre-formed cloth diapers with snaps or hook and loop fasteners (similar to <a href="/wiki/Velcro" id="w">Velcro</a>) and all-in-one diapers with waterproof exteriors are now available, in addition to the older pre-fold and pin variety. Increasingly popular are &#34;pocket&#34; or &#34;stuffable&#34; diapers, which consist of a water-resistant outer shell sewn with an opening in the back for insertion of absorbent material.
These place much less stress on landfills; however, they also require washing in water with a small amount of detergent to be properly cleaned.  Contrary to popular belief, high temperatures are not required, nor is soaking.  Nowadays most people &#34;dry-pail&#34; after removal of solid waste and wash on a cold or warm wash.  Most bacteria are removed by this treatment, any that aren&#39;t can be dealt with simply by line-drying outdoors.  The UV exposure will kill the rest.
Cloth diaper-wearing children go through about 6,000 diaper changes. If thrown into a landfill, cotton diapers decompose within six months.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> 
Some cities have a cloth diapering service that delivers clean diapers and picks up soiled ones for a fee.</p>
<a id="Debate" name="Debate"></a><h3>Debate</h3>

<p>A life cycle analysis is one way to choose between disposable diapers and reusable cloth diapers. This analysis attempts to take into account all the environmental factors, including raw material and energy usage, air and water pollution emissions, and waste management issues. Several such analyses have concluded that when all factors are taken into account, both types of diapers have roughly the same environmental effect. However this research has subsequently been proven to be flawed as the numbers of cloth nappy users researched was much smaller than the numbers of disposable users, and the people interviewed were not very representative of cloth nappy users. Cloth nappy groups, including the Women&#39;s Environmental Network, are campaigning for some more balanced research into the subject.</p>
<a id="Changing" name="Changing"></a><h2>Changing</h2>


<p>The replacing of a soiled diaper is commonly referred to as &#34;diapering&#34; or &#34;diaper changing.&#34;  Diaper changing is essential to the prevention of contracting skin irritation of the buttocks, genitalia, and/or the waist. When to change a diaper is the decision of the caregiver. Some people believe that diapers should be changed at fixed times of the day for a routine, such as after naps and after meals. Other people believe that diapers should be changed when they feel a change is needed regardless of timing. Still others people believe a diaper should be changed immediately upon wetting or soiling.  And, some believe that a diaper should be changed only when the wearer is uncomfortable, the diaper is full, the diaper is leaking, or the wearer has a bowel movement.</p>
<p>To avoid skin irritation, commonly referred to as <a href="/wiki/Diaper_rash" id="w">diaper rash</a>, the diaper of those prone to it should be changed as soon as possible after it is soiled (especially by fecal matter). The combination of urine and feces creates ammonia. <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" id="w">Ammonia</a> irritates skin and can cause painful redness. During the change, after the buttocks are cleaned and dried, some people use baby oil, barrier creme or baby powder to reduce the possibility of irritation. The most effective means to prevent and treat diaper rash is to expose the buttocks to air and sunshine as often as possible. There are also drying creams based on such ingredients as <a href="/wiki/Zinc_oxide" id="w">zinc oxide</a> which can be used to treat diaper rash. Before disposing of a diaper, either in a diaper pail for washing or the garbage, fecal matter should be removed as much as possible and placed in a toilet to avoid <a href="/wiki/Landfill" id="w">landfill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ground_water" id="w">ground water</a> contamination.</p>
<p>Viewed by some as unpleasant, diaper changing is often a source of humour.  It can provide an excellent opportunity for bonding between parent and child.  <a href="/wiki/Tom_Selleck" id="w">Tom Selleck</a> and <a href="/wiki/Steve_Guttenberg" id="w">Steve Guttenberg</a> can be seen comically changing a baby&#39;s diaper in the <a href="/wiki/1987" id="w">1987</a> movie <i><a href="/wiki/Three_Men_and_a_Baby" id="w">Three Men and a Baby</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Length_of_use" name="Length_of_use"></a><h2>Length of use</h2>

<p>While awake, most children no longer need diapers when past two to four years of age, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child&#39;s personality. However, some children have problems with daytime or more often nocturnal bladder control until eight years or older.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Known as enuresis, or more commonly <a href="/wiki/Bedwetting" id="w">bedwetting</a>, this may occur for a wide variety of reasons and can be both a short-term or long-standing issue.  With this as well as the increasing number of obese infants in developed countries, disposables manufacturers are increasing the sizes of their products so that children can remain in diapers for longer.<sup id="_ref-Pampers6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pampers6" title="">[11]</a></sup>  This has caused some controversy, with family psychologist <a href="/wiki/John_Rosemond" id="w">John Rosemond</a> claiming it is a &#34;slap to the intelligence of a human being that one would allow baby to continue soiling and wetting himself past age two.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Delayed_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Delayed" title="">[12]</a></sup> Pediatrician <a href="/wiki/T._Berry_Brazelton" id="w">T. Berry Brazelton</a>, however, believes that toilet training is the child&#39;s choice and has encouraged this view in various commercials for Pampers Size 6, a diaper for older children.<sup id="_ref-Delayed_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Delayed" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because of children wearing diapers longer, companies have designed special &#34;training pants&#34; which bridge the gap between baby diapers and normal underwear during the toilet training process.  These training pants are distinct from diapers in that they mimic underwear and do not require complex fastening, so children can be changed standing up or even independently without adult assistance.  Studies have shown that the use of training pants instead of diapers can be effective in speeding up toilet training.<sup id="_ref-Pull-UpsFAQs_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pull-UpsFAQs" title="">[13]</a></sup>  Larger versions, such as <a href="/wiki/GoodNites" id="w">GoodNites</a>, are available for older children and teenagers who have already been toilet trained but continue to suffer from bedwetting.  They are intended to be discreet and similar to underwear, and are generally labeled &#34;underwear&#34; on the package, so as to avoid alienating those who find wearing diapers at a late age to be embarrassing.<sup id="_ref-GettingStarted_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GettingStarted" title="">[14]</a></sup>  Available in both cloth and disposable versions, they are constructed like a diaper with an absorbent core and a waterproof shell and can be worn at any age until the child stops wetting the bed.  Because they can be pulled on and off like underpants, children are able to use the toilet if they feel the need, rather than being forced to wet or soil themselves unnecessarily.  Whereas most diapers are <a href="/wiki/Unisex" id="w">unisex</a>, training pants often come in gender-specific versions because children become more aware of gender-differences as they grow older.<sup id="_ref-Pull-UpsFAQs_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pull-UpsFAQs" title="">[13]</a></sup>  Some recent versions are designed to look like <a href="/wiki/Boxer_shorts" id="w">boxer shorts</a>, in order to appear more &#34;cool&#34; and help boost children&#39;s confidence.<sup id="_ref-SleepShorts_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SleepShorts" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the development of training pants making it possible for children to change their own diapers, and pediatricians such as Brazelton claiming that forced toilet training can cause lasting psychological and health problems, children are wearing diapers at a much older age than they did historically.<sup id="_ref-Delayed_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Delayed" title="">[12]</a></sup>  Recent studies show that an increasing number of Japanese children are wetting their beds and even wearing diapers full time, well into elementary school.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Because of this trend, progressively larger diapers are appearing on the Japanese market. One example includes the &#34;Goo.N Refreshing Bigger than Big Size Diapers,&#34; intended for seven-year-old boys<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> and girls<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>.  On the Children&#39;s Health and Wellness website, Dr Paul believes that diapering a child can prolong bedwetting, as it sends a &#34;message of permission&#34; to urinate in their sleep.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>  Dr Anthony Page of the Creative Child Online Magazine claims that children can get used to their diapers and begin to view them as a comfort, and that of the children surveyed, most would rather wear diapers than worry about getting up at night to go to the toilet.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

Diapers are most commonly worn by babies, but may also be worn by older children, teenagers and adults for a variety of reasons.  There may be a medical reason why a person is unable to reach a toilet for longer than their bladders can hold out, such as incontinence or bedwetting.  For example, pregnant women must urinate very frequently, and urgently, and therefore may decide to wear adult diapers.  People who are bedridden, recovering from surgery, or in a wheelchair may also wear diapers because they are unable to access the toilet independently.  Because the usage of diapers and incontinence problems in general are often the cause of significant embarrassment for the sufferer, youth and adult diapers are often instead referred to as incontinence pads.  In 2006, seventeen students taking a geriatrics <a href="/wiki/Pharmacotherapy" id="w">pharmacotherapy</a> course participated in a voluntary &#34;Diaper Experience&#34; exercise to help them understand the impact incontinence has on older adults.  The students, who wore adult diapers for a day before writing a paper about it, described the experience as unfamilar and physically challenging, noting that being in diapers had a largely negative impact on them and that better solutions to incontinence are required.  However, they praised the exercise for giving them insight into incontinence and the effect it has on peoples&#39; lives.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sexual_fetishism" id="w">Fetishists</a> can wear diapers for sexual gratification.  People with <a href="/wiki/Diaper_fetishism" id="w">diaper fetishism</a> have a desire to wear diapers even though it is not a physiological necessity, and may enjoy using their diaper to various degrees, depending on the person.  <a href="/wiki/Paraphilic_infantilism" id="w">Infantilists</a> wear and use diapers in <a href="/wiki/Ageplay" id="w">ageplay</a>, although they are considered distinct from fetishists, as &#34;diaper lovers&#34; are sexually motivated to wear diapers, whereas &#34;adult babies&#34; wish to regress to the helpless state of a baby.  Other sexual uses of diapers include <a href="/wiki/Omorashi#diapers" id="w">omorashi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latex_and_PVC_fetishism" id="w">rubber or plastic fetishism</a><sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>, and <a href="/wiki/Total_Power_Exchange" id="w">Total Power Exchange</a> in <a href="/wiki/BDSM" id="w">BDSM</a>.  Since the aim of bondage is to restrict mobility, diapers are effective because they remove a person&#39;s freedom both physically and emotionally.  As well as being forced to cope with the physical bulk and heat of the diaper, the <a href="/wiki/Top_and_bottom_in_sex_and_BDSM" id="w">submissive</a> also suffers a loss of dignity and independence, since they no longer have any control over their own most basic bodily functions.

<p>There are those who believe diapers are a preferable alternative to using the bathroom.  According to Dr Dipak Chatterjee of <a href="/wiki/Mumbai" id="w">Mumbai</a> newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/DNA_(newspaper)" id="w">Daily News and Analysis</a></i>, public toilet facilities are so unhygienic that it is actually safer for people — especially women — who are vulnerable to infections to wear adult diapers instead.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>  Seann Odoms of <a href="/wiki/Men%26%2339%3Bs_Health_(magazine)" id="w">Men&#39;s Health</a> magazine believes that wearing diapers can help people of all ages to maintain healthy bowel function.

He writes, &#34;Make the elderly finally feel embraced instead of ridiculed and remove the teasing from the adolescent equation that affects so many children in a negative way. Give every person in this world the opportunity to live, learn, grow and urinate anywhere and anytime without societal pressure to &#34;hold themselves in.&#34;&#34;<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Animal_usage" name="Animal_usage"></a><h2>Animal usage</h2>
<p>Diapers and diaper-like products are sometimes used on pets, laboratory animals, or working animals. This is often due to the animal not being <a href="/wiki/Housebroken" id="w">housebroken</a>, or for older, sick, or injured pets who have become incontinent. In some cases, these are simply baby diapers with holes cut for the tails to fit through. In other cases, they are diaper-like waste collection devices.</p>
<p>Animals that are sometimes diapered include :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Horses" id="w">Horses</a> can be fitted with diapers so that their manure can be used for fertilizer, or so that the horses can be used in public settings without leaving droppings on the ground. If the horse is hauling, sometimes the diaper is a piece of strong cloth or plastic slung between the horse&#39;s hauling harness and the front of the cart or carriage. Some <a href="/wiki/Mare_(horse)" id="w">mares</a> are kept specifically for the production of urine, collected for <a href="/wiki/Premarin" id="w">premarin</a>, a hormonal drug.</li>
<li>Female cats and dogs can wear diapers when <a href="/wiki/Ovulation" id="w">ovulating</a> and thus bleeding.</li>
<li>Monkeys and apes are sometimes diapered; most are physically unable to control their excretions, which is not a convenient situation for tree-dwelling animals. Diapers are often seen on trained animals who appear on TV shows, in movies, or for live entertainment or educational appearances.</li></ul>
