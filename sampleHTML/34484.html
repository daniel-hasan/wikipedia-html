<b>Zionism</b> is an international <a href="/wiki/Jewish_political_movements" id="w">political movement</a> that supports a <a href="/wiki/Homeland_for_the_Jewish_People" id="w">homeland for the Jewish People</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Land_of_Israel" id="w">Land of Israel</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>
Although its origins are earlier, the movement was formally established by Austrian journalist <a href="/wiki/Theodor_Herzl" id="w">Theodor Herzl</a> in the late nineteenth century. The movement was eventually successful in establishing the <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">State of Israel</a> in 1948, as the world&#39;s first and only modern <a href="/wiki/Jewish_State" id="w">Jewish State</a>. It continues primarily as support for the state and government of Israel and its continuing status as a homeland for the Jewish people.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Described as a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Diaspora" id="w">diaspora</a> <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" id="w">nationalism</a>,&#34;<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> its proponents regard it as a <a href="/wiki/National_liberation_movement" id="w">national liberation movement</a> whose aim is the <a href="/wiki/Self-determination" id="w">self-determination</a> of the Jewish people.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>While Zionism is based in part upon <a href="/wiki/Judaism" id="w">religious tradition</a> linking the Jewish people to the Land of Israel, where the concept of Jewish <a href="/wiki/Nationhood" id="w">nationhood</a> is thought to have first evolved somewhere between 1200 BCE and the late <a href="/wiki/Second_Temple" id="w">Second Temple</a> era (i.e. up to 70 CE),<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> the modern movement was mainly <a href="/wiki/Secularism" id="w">secular</a>, beginning largely as a response by <a href="/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews" id="w">European Jewry</a> to <a href="/wiki/Antisemitism" id="w">antisemitism</a> across <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> At first one of several <a href="/wiki/Jewish_political_movements" id="w">Jewish political movements</a> offering alternative responses to the position of Jews in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>, Zionism gradually gained more support, and after <a href="/wiki/The_Holocaust" id="w">the Holocaust</a> became the dominant Jewish political movement.</p>
<a id="Terminology" name="Terminology"></a><h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>The word &#34;Zionism&#34; itself derived from the word &#34;<a href="/wiki/Zion" id="w">Zion</a>&#34; (<a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language" id="w">Hebrew</a>: ציון, <i>Tzi-yon</i>), one of the names of <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" id="w">Jerusalem</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Land_of_Israel" id="w">Land of Israel</a>, as mentioned in the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a>. 
It was coined as a term for Jewish <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" id="w">nationalism</a> by <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austrian</a> <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jewish</a> publisher <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Birnbaum" id="w">Nathan Birnbaum</a>, founder of the first nationalist Jewish students&#39; movement <i>Kadimah</i>, in his journal <i>Selbstemanzipation</i> (<i>Self Emancipation</i>) in 1890. (Birnbaum eventually turned against political Zionism and became the first secretary-general of the anti-Zionist <a href="/wiki/Haredi_Judaism" id="w">Haredi</a> movement <a href="/wiki/Agudat_Israel" id="w">Agudat Israel</a>.)<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since the founding of the State of Israel, the term &#34;Zionism&#34; is generally considered to mean support for Israel as a Jewish <a href="/wiki/Nation_state" id="w">nation state</a>. However, a variety of different, and sometimes competing, <a href="/wiki/Ideologies" id="w">ideologies</a> that support Israel fit under the general category of Zionism, such as <a href="/wiki/Religious_Zionist_Movement" id="w">Religious Zionism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Revisionist_Zionism" id="w">Revisionist Zionism</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Labor_Zionism" id="w">Labor Zionism</a>. Thus, the term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the programs of these ideologies, such as efforts to encourage <a href="/wiki/Aliyah" id="w">Jewish immigration to Israel</a>.</p>
<p>Certain individuals and groups have used the term &#34;Zionism&#34; as a pejorative to justify attacks on Jews. According to historians <a href="/wiki/Walter_Laqueur" id="w">Walter Laqueur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Howard_Sachar" id="w">Howard Sachar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jack_Fischel" id="w">Jack Fischel</a> among others, in some cases, the label &#34;Zionist&#34; is also used  as a <a href="/wiki/Euphemism" id="w">euphemism</a> for Jews in general by apologists for <a href="/wiki/Antisemitism" id="w">antisemitism</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Zionism should be distinguished from <a href="/wiki/Territorialism" id="w">Territorialism</a> which was a Jewish nationalist movement calling for a Jewish homeland, but not necessarily in <a href="/wiki/Palestine" id="w">Palestine</a>.  During the early history of Zionism, a number of proposals were made for settling Jews outside of Europe but these all ultimately were rejected or failed.  The debate over these proposals helped define the nature and focus of the Zionist movement.</p>

<p>The desire of Jews to return to their ancestral homeland is a Jewish theme that first makes its appearance in the <a href="/wiki/Torah" id="w">Torah</a>. <a href="/wiki/Jacob" id="w">Israel</a> and his sons went down to Egypt to escape a drought, where they became a nation and were enslaved. <a href="/wiki/Moses" id="w">Moses</a> went before Pharoh and demanded, &#34;Let my people go!&#34;  Most of the Torah is devoted to the story of the <a href="/wiki/Exodus" id="w">Exodus</a> from Egypt, which is estimated at about 1400 BCE and is celebrated annually during <a href="/wiki/Passover" id="w">Passover</a>. The Passover meal traditionally ends with the words &#34;Next Year in Jerusalem.&#34;</p>
<p>After <a href="/wiki/Babylon" id="w">Babylon</a> conquered Judea in 641 BCE, the Judeans were exiled to Babylon and the theme of return to a homeland came up again. In the book of <a href="/wiki/Psalms" id="w">Psalms</a> (<a href="/wiki/Psalm_137" id="w">Psalm 137</a>), Jews lamented their exile while Prophets like <a href="/wiki/Ezekiel" id="w">Ezekiel</a> foresaw their return. The Bible recounts how, in 538 BCE <a href="/wiki/Cyrus_(Bible)" id="w">Cyrus the Great</a> of <a href="/wiki/Persia" id="w">Persia</a> conquered Babylon and issued a <a href="/wiki/Proclamation" id="w">proclamation</a> granting the people of Judah their freedom. 50,000 Judeans, led by <a href="/wiki/Zerubabel" id="w">Zerubabel</a> returned. A second group of 5000, led by <a href="/wiki/Ezra" id="w">Ezra</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nehemiah" id="w">Nehemiah</a>, returned to <a href="/wiki/Judea" id="w">Judea</a> in 456 BCE.</p>

<p>The third great Jewish exile is considered to have begun after the destruction of Judea by the Roman Empire in the year 70 (after the <a href="/wiki/Great_Jewish_Revolt" id="w">Great Jewish Revolt</a>). A second Jewish revolt against the Romans, <a href="/wiki/Bar_Kokhba%26%2339%3Bs_revolt" id="w">Bar Kokhba&#39;s revolt</a> of 135, led to further dispersal of Jews to other parts of the Empire.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>A Jewish presence in the Land of Israel was maintained even after the <a href="/wiki/Bar_Kokhba" id="w">Bar Kokhba</a> revolt, and there is evidence of vibrant communities in the first millennium. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud" id="w">Jerusalem Talmud</a> was created in the centuries following the revolt.  The inventors of <a href="/wiki/Niqqud" id="w">Hebrew vowel-signs</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Masoretes" id="w">Masoretes</a> (ba&#39;alei hamasorah, Hebrew בעלי המסורה), groups of scribes in 7th and 11th centuries were based primarily in <a href="/wiki/Tiberias" id="w">Tiberias</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" id="w">Jerusalem</a>. </p>

<p><i>Aliyah</i> (immigration to Israel) has always been considered to be a praiseworthy act for Jews according to <a href="/wiki/Halakha" id="w">Jewish law</a>, and is included as a commandment in most versions of the <a href="/wiki/613_mitzvot" id="w">613 commandments</a> which Jews are supposed to strive to fulfill. </p>
<p>From the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a> and onwards, many famous rabbis (and often their followers) immigrated to the Land of Israel.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" id="w">Age of Enlightenment</a> in Europe led to an 18th and 19th century Jewish enlightenment movement in Europe, called the <a href="/wiki/Haskalah" id="w">Haskalah</a>. The <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" id="w">French Revolution</a> and the spread of western liberal ideas among newly emancipated Jews created for the first time a class of <a href="/wiki/Secular_Jews" id="w">secular Jews</a> who absorbed the prevailing ideas of <a href="/wiki/Rationalism" id="w">rationalism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Romanticism" id="w">romanticism</a> and, most importantly, <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" id="w">nationalism</a>. </p>
<p>Emancipated Jews who abandoned Judaism often found themselves still rejected by their host societies and still labeled as &#39;Jews&#39;. They also found that abandoning their Jewish identity meant loss of their heritage. </p>
<p>The formation of modern nations in Europe led to changes in the prejudices against Jews. What had previously been religious prejudice now became a new phenomenon known as <a href="/wiki/Antisemitism" id="w">antisemitism</a>. Anti-Semites saw Jews as a racial group as well as a religious group and actively tried to prevent Jews from acquiring equal rights and citizenship.</p>

<p>Zionism arose out of a combination of factors: a nationalist ideology, a response to anti-Semitism, an attempt to provide a means of escape from what many Jews saw as unceasing Christian persecution, and also an alternative to assimilation, Bolshevism and conversion.</p>
<p>Jews in growing numbers began to perceive themselves as a &#34;nation&#34; in the new European sense and were inspired by various national struggles. If European nations were entitled to a homeland, and if those nations excluded Jews, why not create a Jewish homeland, where Jews would be free of persecution?  </p>
<p>Jews in Eastern Europe faced constant <a href="/wiki/Pogroms" id="w">pogroms</a> and <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Russia_and_the_Soviet_Union#Tsarist Russia .281480s-1917.29" id="w">persecution</a> in Tzarist Russia aimed at driving them out. In response to the Jewish drive for modern education (<a href="/wiki/Haskalah" id="w">Haskalah</a>), the Tzars imposed tight quotas on schools, universities and cities to prevent entry by Jews. The Russian government deliberately organized pogroms by military authorities to disarm any Jews who attempted to defend themselves. Consequently, between 1880 and 1928, two million Jews left Eastern Europe, mostly for the USA. A minority went to Palestine.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Dreyfus_Affair" id="w">Dreyfus Affair</a>, which erupted in <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> in 1894, profoundly shocked emancipated Jews. The depth of anti-Semitism in a country thought of as the home of enlightenment and liberty led many to question their future security in Europe. Among those who witnessed the Affair was an Austro-Hungarian (born in <a href="/wiki/Budapest" id="w">Budapest</a>, lived in <a href="/wiki/Vienna" id="w">Vienna</a>) Jewish journalist, <a href="/wiki/Theodor_Herzl" id="w">Theodor Herzl</a>, who published his pamphlet <i><a href="/wiki/Der_Judenstaat" id="w">Der Judenstaat</a></i> (&#34;The Jewish State&#34;) in 1896 and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Old_New_Land" id="w">Altneuland</a></i> (&#34;The Old New Land&#34;) <a class="externallink" href="http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1600" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1600">http://www.hagshama.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1600</a> in 1897. He described the Affair as a personal turning point, Before the Affair, Herzl had been <a href="/wiki/Anti-Zionist" id="w">anti-Zionist</a>; afterwards he became ardently pro-Zionist. Herzl believed in a Jewish state for the Jewish nation. In that way, he argued, the Jews could become a people like all other peoples, and anti-semitism would cease to exist.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Theodor_Herzl" id="w">Herzl</a> infused political Zionism with a new and practical urgency. He brought the <a href="/wiki/World_Zionist_Organization" id="w">World Zionist Organization</a> into being and, together with Nathan Birnbaum, planned its First Congress at <a href="/wiki/Basel" id="w">Basel</a> in 1897.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_objectives_of_Zionism" name="The_objectives_of_Zionism"></a><h4>The objectives of Zionism</h4>
<p>During the First Zionist Congress, the following agreement, commonly known as the Basel Program, was reached:
</p><blockquote>
<p>Zionism seeks to establish a home for the Jewish people in Eretz-Israel secured under public law [that is to seek legal permission from the Ottoman rulers for Jewish migration]. The Congress contemplates the following means to the attainment of this end:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The promotion by appropriate means of the settlement in Eretz-Israel of Jewish farmers, artisans, and manufacturers.</li>
<li>The organization and uniting of the whole of Jewry by means of appropriate institutions, both local and international, in accordance with the laws of each country.</li>
<li>The strengthening and fostering of Jewish national sentiment and national consciousness.</li>
<li>Preparatory steps toward obtaining the consent of governments, where necessary, in order to reach the goals of Zionism.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></li></ol>

<p>For the first four years, the <a href="/wiki/World_Zionist_Organization" id="w">World Zionist Organization</a> (WZO) met every year, then, up to the Second World War, they gathered every second year. Since the war, the Congress has met every four years.

Congress delegates were elected by the membership. Members were required to pay dues known as a &#34;shekel,&#34; At the congress, delegates elected a 30-man executive council, which in turn elected the movement&#39;s leader.  The movement was democratic and women had the right to vote, which was still absent in Great Britain in 1914.</p>
<p>The WZO&#39;s initial strategy was to obtain permission from the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire#Sultans" id="w">Ottoman Sultan</a> <a href="/wiki/Abd-ul-Hamid_II" id="w">Abd-ul-Hamid II</a> to allow systematic Jewish settlement in Palestine. The support of the German Emperor, <a href="/wiki/William_II%2C_German_Emperor" id="w">Wilhelm II</a>, was sought, but unsuccessfully. Instead, the WZO pursued a strategy of building a homeland through persistent small-scale immigration and the founding of such bodies as the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_National_Fund" id="w">Jewish National Fund</a> (1901) and the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Palestine_Bank" id="w">Anglo-Palestine Bank</a> (1903).</p>

Herzl&#39;s strategy relied on winning support from foreign rulers, in particular the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Sultan" id="w">Ottoman Sultan</a>. He also made efforts to cultivate Orthodox rabbinical support.  Rabbinical support depended on the Zionist movement making no challenges to existing Jewish tradition. However, an opposition movement arose which emphasized the need for a revolution in Jewish thought.
While Herzl believed that the Jews needed to return to their historic homeland as a refuge from anti-Semitism, the opposition, led  by <a href="/wiki/Ahad_HaAm" id="w">Ahad HaAm</a>, believed that the Jews must revive and foster a Jewish national culture and, in particular strove to revive the Hebrew language. 
The opposition became known as Cultural Zionists.</p>
<a id="The_Uganda_proposal" name="The_Uganda_proposal"></a><h4>The Uganda proposal</h4>
<p>In 1903, the British Colonial Secretary, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Chamberlain" id="w">Joseph Chamberlain</a>, suggested the <a href="/wiki/British_Uganda_Program" id="w">British Uganda Program</a>, land for a Jewish state in &#34;<a href="/wiki/Uganda" id="w">Uganda</a>&#34; (in today&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Kenya" id="w">Kenya</a>). Herzl initially rejected the idea, preferring Palestine, but after the April 1903 <a href="/wiki/Kishinev_pogrom" id="w">Kishinev pogrom</a>, Herzl introduced a controversial proposal to the Sixth Zionist Congress to investigate the offer as a temporary measure for Russian Jews in danger. Despite its emergency and temporary nature, the proposal proved very divisive, and widespread opposition to the plan was fueled by a walkout led by the Russian Jewish delegation to the Congress. Nevertheless, a committee was established to investigate the possibility, which was eventually dismissed in the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905. After that, Palestine became the sole focus of Zionist aspirations.</p>
<a id="The_death_of_Herzl" name="The_death_of_Herzl"></a><h4>The death of Herzl</h4>
<p>In 1904, Herzl died unexpectedly at the age of 44 and the leadership was taken over by <a href="/wiki/David_Wolfsohn" id="w">David Wolfsohn</a>, who led the movement until 1911. During this period, the movement made little progress, failing to win support among the <a href="/wiki/Young_Turks" id="w">Young Turks</a> after the collapse of the Ottoman Regime.</p>
<p>From 1911 to 1921, the movement was led by Dr. <a href="/wiki/Otto_Warburg_(botanist)" id="w">Otto Warburg</a>.</p>
<p>By 1904, cultural Zionism was accepted by most Zionists and a schism was beginning to develop between the Zionist movement and Orthodox Judaism.</p>

<p>{{main}}
</p><a id="Orthodox_Jewish_Opposition" name="Orthodox_Jewish_Opposition"></a><h4>Orthodox Jewish Opposition</h4>
<p>Under Herzl&#39;s leadership, Zionism won orthodox Jewish support. However, cultural and socialist Zionists increasingly broke with tradition and used language contrary to the outlook of most religious Jewish communities. As a result, many religious organizations opposed Zionism, both on the grounds that it was a secular movement and on the grounds that any attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by <a href="/wiki/Agency_(philosophy)" id="w">human agency</a> was blasphemous, since (in their view) only the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_eschatology" id="w">Messiah</a> could accomplish this.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Jews" id="w">Orthodox Jews</a> thus retreated into the traditional Jewish belief that the Land of Israel was given to the ancient <a href="/wiki/Israelite" id="w">Israelites</a> by <a href="/wiki/God" id="w">God</a>, and that while the right of the Jews to that land was permanent and inalienable, the Messiah must appear before Israel could return to Jewish control. </p>
<p>Other Orthodox Jews formed an orthodox Zionist movement, <a href="/wiki/Mizrachi" id="w">Mizrachi</a> .</p>
<p>Prior to <a href="/wiki/The_Holocaust" id="w">the Holocaust</a>, <a href="/wiki/Reform_Judaism" id="w">Reform Judaism</a> rejected Zionism as inconsistent with the requirements of Jewish citizenship in the diaspora.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>While Zionism aroused <a href="/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews" id="w">Ashkenazi</a> orthodox antagonism in Europe (probably due to Modernist European antagonism to organized religion), in the Islamic world, orthodox Judaism eagerly embraced Zionism.</p>
<a id="Support_for_other_homelands" name="Support_for_other_homelands"></a><h4>Support for other homelands</h4>
<p>Before 1917, some Zionist leaders seriously considered proposals for Jewish homelands in places other than Palestine. Herzl&#39;s <i>Der Judenstaat</i> argued for a Jewish state in either Palestine, &#34;our ever-memorable historic home&#34;, or <a href="/wiki/Argentina" id="w">Argentina</a>, &#34;one of the most fertile countries in the world.&#34; When the Zionist Movement rejected the Uganda Proposal, the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Territorialist_Organization" id="w">Jewish Territorialist Organization</a> (ITO) led by <a href="/wiki/Israel_Zangwill" id="w">Israel Zangwill</a> split off from the main Zionist movement. The <a href="/wiki/Territorialism" id="w">territorialists</a> attempted to establish a Jewish homeland wherever possible, but went into decline after 1917 and the ITO was dissolved in 1925.</p>
<a id="Communism" name="Communism"></a><h4>Communism </h4>
<p>Zionism&#39;s most serious rival in Eastern Europe was the <a href="/wiki/General_Jewish_Labor_Union" id="w">General Jewish Labor Union</a>, otherwise known as the <a href="/wiki/Bund" id="w">Bund</a>, which helped promote the Communist Revolution in Russia. The Bund called for <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Autonomism" id="w">Jewish autonomy</a> within Eastern Europe and promoted <a href="/wiki/Yiddish" id="w">Yiddish</a> as the Jewish language. Bund supporters regarded Zionism as a form of <a href="/wiki/Bourgeois_nationalism" id="w">Bourgeois nationalism</a>.
However, as was the case with Orthodox Judaism, while the leadership opposed Zionism (and Orthodox Judaism), in practise, the rank and file often had ties with other forms of Jewish life including Zionism.  The Bund thus indirectly led to development of Socialist Zionism, which competed with it for Jewish allegiances.</p>
<a id="Growth_of_the_Zionist_community_in_Israel" name="Growth_of_the_Zionist_community_in_Israel"></a><h3>Growth of the Zionist community in Israel</h3>
<p>In Palestine, the small Zionist community began to expand. Widespread pogroms accompanied the <a href="/wiki/1905_Russian_Revolution" id="w">1905 Russian Revolution</a>, inspired by the <a href="/wiki/Black_Hundreds" id="w">Black Hundreds</a>. This and the desire of many young Jews to avoid conscription for the <a href="/wiki/Russo-Japanese_war" id="w">Russo-Japanese war</a> led to a wave of immigrants to Palestine.

In Jerusalem, foundations were laid for a Jewish University (the <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_University" id="w">Hebrew University</a>), one which would teach only in Hebrew and which the Zionists hoped would help them prove their usefulness to the Turks (this did not come to fruition until 1918).

<p>The 1911 edition of the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Encyclopedia" id="w">Jewish Encyclopedia</a> evidenced the movement&#39;s growing popularity: &#34;there is hardly a nook or corner of the Jewish world in which Zionistic societies are not to be found.&#34;<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p>The chief rival to Zionism among young Jews in Eastern Europe was the <a href="/wiki/Socialist_movement" id="w">socialist movement</a>. Many Jews were abandoning Judaism in favour of <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">Communism</a> or supported the <a href="/wiki/Bund" id="w">Bund</a>, a Jewish socialist movement which called for <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Autonomism" id="w">Jewish autonomy</a> in Eastern Europe and promoted <a href="/wiki/Yiddish" id="w">Yiddish</a> as the Jewish language.</p>
<p>Opposition to this led to the emergence of a new Zionist movement, the socialist Zionists, who believed that the Jews&#39; centuries of being oppressed in anti-Semitic societies had reduced Jews to a meek, vulnerable, despairing existence which invited further anti-Semitism. They argued that Jews should redeem themselves from their history by becoming farmers, workers, and soldiers in a country of their own. These socialist Zionists rejected religion as perpetuating a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Diaspora" id="w">Diaspora</a> mentality&#34; among the Jewish people and established rural communes in Israel called &#34;<a href="/wiki/Kibbutzim" id="w">Kibbutzim</a>&#34;. Major theoreticians of Socialist Zionism included <a href="/wiki/Moses_Hess" id="w">Moses Hess</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nahum_Syrkin" id="w">Nahum Syrkin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ber_Borochov" id="w">Ber Borochov</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aaron_David_Gordon" id="w">Aaron David Gordon</a>, and leading figures in the movement included <a href="/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion" id="w">David Ben-Gurion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Berl_Katznelson" id="w">Berl Katznelson</a>. Socialist Zionists rejected Yiddish as a language of exile, embracing Hebrew as the common Jewish tongue.</p>
<p>Socialist Zionism became a dominant force in Israel. However, it caused the schism between Zionism and some groups of <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Jews" id="w">Orthodox Jews</a> (such as <a href="/wiki/Neturei_Karta" id="w">Neturei Karta</a>) to grow.</p>

Zionist leaders and advocates followed conditions in the land of Israel closely and traveled there regularly.  Their concern, however, was entirely with the future of Jewish settlement.  The future of the land&#39;s Arab inhabitants concerned them as little as the welfare of the Jews concerned Arab leaders. During the movement&#39;s formative stages, Zionist negotiators with stronger political powers (such as the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a>) remained silent about the Arab inhabitants of Palestine, who numbered just under half a million during the late <a href="/wiki/19th_century" id="w">nineteenth century</a>.<sup id="_ref-pop_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pop" title="">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Anita_Shapira" id="w">Anita Shapira</a>, among nineteenth and early twentieth century Zionists, &#39;The Arabs in Palestine were viewed as one more of the many misfortunes present in Palestine, like the Ottoman authorities, the climate, difficulties of adjustment, [...]  [T]he Zionist organization did not discuss this issue during that period and did not formulate a political line on it. Yet at that particular juncture in the movement such deliberations [...] had about the same importance as the learned disputations customarily held in the courtyards of Hassidic rebbes regarding what would happen after the coming of the messiah.&#39; <sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>   </p>
<p>What thought Zionists did give to Arab national rights was perhaps typified by this passage by Israel Zangwill, written just after the first World War: &#39;The Arabs should recognize that the road of renewed national glory lies through Baghdad, Damascus and Mecca, and all the vast territories freed for them from the Turks and be content. [...] The powers that freed them have surely the right to ask them not to grudge the petty strip (Israel) necessary for the renaissance of a still more down-trodden people.&#39;  <sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> From the beginning, Zionists saw the Arab residents of Palestine as part of a larger Arab nation.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Under the Ottomans, Palestine&#39;s Arab population mostly saw themselves as Ottoman subjects. They feared the objectives of the Zionist movement, but they assumed the movement would fail. After the Young Turk revolution in 1908, Arab Nationalism grew rapidly in the area and most Arab Nationalists regarded Zionism as a threat, although a minority perceived Zionism as providing a path to modernity.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

In the search for support, Herzl made most progress with the Kaiser, joining him on his 1898 trip to Palestine.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> At the oubreak of war in 1914, the offices of the World Zionist Organization were located in Berlin and the Zionist leader, <a href="/wiki/Otto_Warburg_(botanist)" id="w">Otto Warburg</a>, was a German citizen. With different sections of the movement supporting different sides in the war, Zionist policy was to maintain strict neutrality and &#34;to demonstrate complete loyalty to Turkey.&#34;<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>At this time, England had a rapidly growing Jewish minority. About 150,000 Jews migrated there from Russia in the period 1881-1914.  There was pressure from British voters to halt the influx as well as a strong love for the <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament" id="w">Old Testament</a> in British society, which made Zionism an attractive solution.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1914, most Jews viewed Russia as the historic enemy of the Jewish people, and there was tremendous support for Germany within the Jewish community, particularly in the United States, where the many Russian and German Jews supported the Germans alongside the large <a href="/wiki/Irish-American" id="w">Irish-American</a> community. Britain was anxious to win US support for its war effort, and winning over US Jews was considered vital.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Most Russian Jewish immigrants to Britain supported Germany in its war against Russia and avoided the draft.</p>
<p>Following Turkey&#39;s entry into the <a href="/wiki/First_World_War" id="w">First World War</a>, the Zionists were expelled from Tel-Aviv and its environs. A Polish Zionist, <a href="/wiki/Ze%26%2339%3Bev_Jabotinsky" id="w">Ze&#39;ev Jabotinsky</a>, worked to create a Jewish division in the British army. The <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Legion" id="w">Jewish Legion</a> provided a means of recruiting Russian immigrants to the British war effort and was dominated by Zionist volunteers. The Jewish Legion participated in the 1917 British invasion of Palestine and Jabotinsky was awarded for bravery.</p>
<p>In 1915, the British <a href="/wiki/Shell_Crisis_of_1915" id="w">government fell</a> as a result of its inability to manufacture sufficient artillery shells for the war effort. In the new Government, <a href="/wiki/David_Lloyd_George" id="w">David Lloyd George</a> became the minister responsible for armaments. Lloyd George was a Christian-Zionist and had represented the Zionist movement in its dealings with the British Government over the Uganda proposal. </p>
<p>The most prominent Russian-Zionist migrant to Britain was <a href="/wiki/Chaim_Weizmann" id="w">Chaim Weizmann</a>. Weizmann developed a means for mass production of <a href="/wiki/Acetone" id="w">Acetone</a>, a critical ingredient of explosives that Britain was unable to manufacture. He did not ask for any payment for his efforts. According to Lloyd George himself, he expected no payment, just the rights over Palestine.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Weizmann became a close associate of [Lloyd George] (Prime-Minister from 1916) and the <a href="/wiki/First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty" id="w">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> (foreign minister from 1916), <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Balfour" id="w">Arthur Balfour</a>. </p>
<p>In addition to the British desire to cement US Jewish support, there was concern to keep Russia in the war after the <a href="/wiki/February_Revolution" id="w">overthrow of the Tzar</a> in February 1917. Jews were prominent in the new Russia, and it was hoped that British support for Zionism would help keep Russia fighting Germany. </p>
<p>In 1917, the British Foreign Secretary, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Balfour" id="w">Arthur Balfour</a>, made the famous <a href="/wiki/Balfour_Declaration%2C_1917" id="w">Declaration</a> in favour of &#34;the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.&#34; The Declaration used the word &#34;home&#34; rather than &#34;state,&#34; and specified that its establishment must not &#34;prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.&#34;</p>
<p>When the Balfour Declaration was issued in 1917, <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Montagu" id="w">Edwin Montagu</a>, the only Jew in the British Cabinet, &#34;was passionately opposed to the declaration on the grounds that (a) it was a capitulation to anti-Semitic bigotry, with its suggestion that Palestine was the natural destination of the Jews, and that (b) it would be a grave cause of alarm to the Muslim world.&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup>, the reference to the rights of non-Jews in Palestine was thus demanded by the only Jew in the British cabinet.</p>

<p>After the defeat and dismantling of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" id="w">League of Nations</a> endorsed the Balfour Declaration with the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations_mandate" id="w">British Mandate</a> for Palestine (text: <a class="externallink" href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/palmanda.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/palmanda.htm">http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/palmanda.htm</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to the promises made by Balfour, the League required Britain to create a representative body, the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Agency" id="w">Jewish Agency</a>, which would administer Jewish affairs in Palestine.</p>
<p>The Zionist movement entered a new phase of activity. Its priorities were the escalation of Jewish settlement in Palestine, the building of the institutional foundations of a Jewish state, raising funds for these purposes, and persuading &#8212; or forcing &#8212; the British authorities not to take any steps which would lead to Palestine moving towards independence as an Arab-majority state. The 1920s did see a steady growth in the Jewish population and the construction of state-like Jewish institutions, but also saw the emergence of Palestinian Arab nationalism and growing resistance to Jewish immigration.
</p><a id="Expansion_of_the_Movement" name="Expansion_of_the_Movement"></a><h3>Expansion of the Movement</h3>
<p>The success of Zionism in getting international recognition for its project, led to growth in the membership and developmenmt of new forms of Zionism.
</p><a id="Religious_Zionism" name="Religious_Zionism"></a><h4>Religious Zionism</h4>
<p>{{main}}
In the 1920s and 1930s, a small but vocal group of religious Jews began to develop the concept of <a href="/wiki/Religious_Zionism" id="w">Religious Zionism</a> under such leaders as Rabbi <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Isaac_Kook" id="w">Abraham Isaac Kook</a> (the first Chief Rabbi of Palestine) and his son Zevi Judah, and gained substantial following during the latter half of the 20th century.  Kook was concerned that growing secularization of Zionism and antagonism towards it from the Orthodox Jews would lead to a schism.  He therefore sought to create a brand of Judaism which would serve as a bridge between Orthodoxy and secular Jews.
</p><a id="Revisionist_Zionism" name="Revisionist_Zionism"></a><h4>Revisionist Zionism</h4>
<p>{{main}}
The Revisionist Zionists were a group led by Jabotinsky who advocated pressing Britain to allow mass Jewish emigration and the formation of a Jewish Army in Palestine.  The army would force the Arab population to accept mass Jewish migration and promote British interests in the region. </p>
<p>Revisionist Zionism was detested by the Socialist Zionist movement which saw them as being influenced by <a href="/wiki/Fascism" id="w">Fascism</a> and the movement caused a great deal of concern among Arab Palestinians. After the <a href="/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots" id="w">1929 Arab riots</a>, the British banned Jabotinsky from entering Palestine. </p>
<p>Revisionism was popular in Poland but lacked large support in Palestine. In 1935 the Revisionists left the Zionist movement, rejoining in 1946.</p>
<a id="Jewish_Opposition_to_Zionism_between_the_wars" name="Jewish_Opposition_to_Zionism_between_the_wars"></a><h3>Jewish Opposition to Zionism between the wars</h3>
<p>International Jewish opinion remained divided on the merits of the Zionist project. While many Jews in Europe and the United States argued that a Jewish homeland was not needed because Jews were able to live in the democratic countries of the West as equal citizens, others supported Zionism. </p>
<p>Jews who embraced <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Proletarian_internationalism" id="w">proletarian internationalism</a> sometimes opposed Zionism as a form of <a href="/wiki/Bourgeois_nationalism" id="w">bourgeois nationalism</a>. The <a href="/wiki/General_Jewish_Labor_Union" id="w">General Jewish Labor Union</a> (Bund), which represented socialist Jews in Eastern Europe, was anti-Zionist and called for <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Autonomism" id="w">Jewish autonomy</a> within Eastern Europe.</p> 
<p>The Communist parties, which attracted substantial Jewish support during the 1920s and 1930s, were usually anti-Zionist, however while communist Jews often abandoned their connection with the religion (thereby ceasing to be Jewish) many retained an affiliation with their people and a sympathy for Zionism. In 1928, the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> established a <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Autonomous_Oblast" id="w">Jewish Autonomous Oblast</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Far_East" id="w">Russian Far East</a> but the effort failed to meet expectations and as of 2002 Jews constitute only about 1.2% of its population.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>

<p>Zionist success in winning British support for formation of a &#34;Jewish National Home&#34; in Palestine helped inspire the African-American Nationalist <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Garvey" id="w">Marcus Garvey</a> to form a movement dedicated to returning Americans of African origin to Africa. During a speech in <a href="/wiki/Harlem" id="w">Harlem</a> in 1920 Garvey stated that
</p><blockquote>
<p>other races were engaged in seeing their cause through---the Jews through their Zionist movement and the Irish through their Irish movement---and I decided that, cost what it might, I would make this a favorable time to see the Negro&#39;s interest through.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Garvey established a shipping company, the <a href="/wiki/Black_Star_Line" id="w">Black Star Line</a>, to ship Black Americans to Africa, but for various reasons failed in his endeavour. His ideas helped inspire the <a href="/wiki/Rastafarian" id="w">Rastafarian</a> movement in Jamaica, the <a href="/wiki/Black_Jews" id="w">Black Jews</a> <sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> and the <a href="/wiki/The_African_Hebrew_Israelites_of_Jerusalem" id="w">Black Hebrews</a> who initially moved to Liberia before settling in Israel.</p>
<a id="Arab_attitudes_to_Zionism" name="Arab_attitudes_to_Zionism"></a><h3>Arab attitudes to Zionism</h3>
<p>Though there had already been Arab protests to the Ottoman authorities in the 1880s against land sales to foreign Jews, the most serious opposition began in the 1890s after the full scope of the Zionist enterprise became known. There was a general sense of threat. This sense was heightened in the early years of the 20th century by Zionist attempts to develop an economy from which Arab people were largely excluded, such as the &#34;Hebrew labor&#34; movement which, in an effort to prevent Zionist settlements turning into a standard colonial enterprise and to secure the creation of a Jewish proletariat, campaigned against the employment of cheap Arab labour. 
The creation of Palestine in 1918 and the <a href="/wiki/Balfour_Declaration%2C_1917" id="w">Balfour Declaration</a> greatly increased Arab fears.

In 1919 King <a href="/wiki/Faisal_I_of_Iraq" id="w">Faisal I of Iraq</a> (who was then King of Syria, before the French expelled him), signed the <a href="/wiki/Faisal-Weizmann_Agreement" id="w">Faisal-Weizmann Agreement</a>. He wrote: &#34;We <a href="/wiki/Arabs" id="w">Arabs</a>, especially the educated among us, look with the deepest sympathy on the Zionist movement. Our delegation here in Paris is fully acquainted with the proposals submitted yesterday by the Zionist organization to the Peace Conference, and we regard them as moderate and proper.&#34;  </p>
<p>Palestinian Arab nationalism was motivated by anti-Zionism more then any other factor and developed in opposition to Zionism. Faisal&#39;s agreement with Weizmann led the Palestinian-Arab population to reject the Syrian-Arab-Nationalist movement (in which many previously placed their hopes) and to agitate for Palestine to become a state governed by the Arab majority, in particular they demanded an elected assembly. <sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup>    </p>
<p>The Arabs in Palestine were led by two main camps. The <a href="/wiki/Nashashibi" id="w">Nashashibis</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Raghib_al-Nashashibi" id="w">Raghib al-Nashashibi</a>, who was Mayor of Jerusalem from 1920 to 1934, were moderates who sought dialogue with the British and the Jews.  The Nashashibis were overshadowed by the <a href="/wiki/Al-Husayni" id="w">al-Husaynis</a> who came to dominate Palestinian-Arab politics in the years before 1948. The al-Husaynis, like most Arab Nationalists, denied that Jews had any national or religious rights in Palestine.  </p>

<p>After 1920 <a href="/wiki/Haj_Amin_al-Husseini" id="w">Haj Amin al-Husseini</a> became the focus of Palestinian opposition to Zionism. Despite his involvment in the <a href="/wiki/1920_Palestine_riots" id="w">1920 Palestine riots</a>, <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Samuel" id="w">Herbert Samuel</a> made him <a href="/wiki/Mufti_of_Jerusalem" id="w">Mufti of Jerusalem</a> in 1921.</p>
<p>The Mufti was concerned that Jews were seeking to rebuild the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Temple" id="w">Jewish Temple</a> on the site of the <a href="/wiki/Dome_of_the_Rock" id="w">Dome of the Rock</a> and <a href="/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque" id="w">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> and responded by trying to gain control of the <a href="/wiki/Western_Wall" id="w">Kotel</a>, also known as the Wailing Wall, saying it was <a href="/wiki/Al-Buraq" id="w">sacred to the Muslims</a>. </p>
<p>Religious tension (over the Kotel), an international economic crisis (affecting crop prices) and nationalist tension (over Zionist immigration) led to the <a href="/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots" id="w">1929 Palestine riots</a>. In these religious-nationalist riots Jews were <a href="/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre" id="w">massacred in Hebron</a> and the survivors were expelled from the town. Devastation also took place in <a href="/wiki/Safed" id="w">Safed</a> and Jerusalem. This violence was directed against the non-Zionist orthodox communities; Zionist communities were able to defend themselves and had established defence organizations. As a result the orthodox community in Palestine was increasingly dependent on Zionist support.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Shaw_Report" id="w">British commission</a> investigated the riots, and throughout his interview the Mufti (who was a virulent anti-semite){{Fact}} held a copy of the <a href="/wiki/Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion" id="w">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>

During the revolt the Mufti was forced to flee to Iraq, where he was involved in a pro-Nazi coup during which the Jewish areas of Baghdad were subjected to a <a href="/wiki/Farhud" id="w">pogrom</a>.

<a id="Zionist_attitudes_toward_the_Arabs" name="Zionist_attitudes_toward_the_Arabs"></a><h3>Zionist attitudes toward the Arabs</h3>
<p>{{see also}}
Most Zionists were Europeans, and although Jews were generally less racist then the average European of the time (Jews were prominent in fighting racism around the world), European-Jewish public opinion generally reflected attitudes of the European societies in which they lived, which at this time was highly prejudiced.</p>
<p>One issue fatally divided Arab and Jew in Palestine: immigration. Jews could not compromise over immigration as for them Palestine was intended as a haven from persecution, particularly after the rise of the Nazis. The Arabs for their part could not compromise on immigration because to do so would effectively end their majority in Palestine. Each side distrusted and feared the other&#39;s long-term ambitions.</p>
<p>Although the establishment of a Jewish majority or a Jewish state in Palestine was fundamentally at odds with the aspirations of the Arab inhabitants of Palestine, Zionists did not doubt their right to establish a Jewish majority in Palestine. Zionists justified this by referring to the &#39;unique&#39; historical bond of the Jewish nation with Palestine, while the Arabs of Palestine were part of the Arab nation and therefore had no special bond with Palestine. Many Zionists claimed a &#39;preemptive right&#39; to Palestine, the Jews had a right as a Nation, the Arabs only as individuals.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/A._D._Gordon" id="w">Aaron David Gordon</a> wrote in 1921: &#39;the creation of the Bible alone, give[s] us a perpetual right over the land in which we were so creative, especially since the people that came after us did not create such works in this country, or did not create anything at all.&#39;<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>Socialist Zionists maintained a struggle for &#34;100 per cent Jewish labour&#34; in the Jewish sector of the economy.&#39;<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup>  which  greatly alienated the Arab population. </p>
<a id="Weizmann" name="Weizmann"></a><h4>Weizmann</h4>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Chaim_Weizmann" id="w">Chaim Weizmann</a>&#39;s view Palestine was a Jewish and not an Arab country<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup>, however Weizmann believed that the state had to be based on justice and on an accommodation with the Arabs. </p>
<p>In 1918, Weizmann toured Palestine as head of the <a href="/wiki/Zionist_Commission" id="w">Zionist Commission</a> and met with Arab and Palestinian-Arab leaders, including the future mufti <a href="/wiki/Mohammad_Amin_al-Husayni" id="w">al-Husseini</a>. He preferred to negotiate a political solution primarily with the British, and sometimes with non-Palestinian Arabs, but he opposed negotiating with the Palestinians themselves.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>. According to Reinharz, he focused his efforts on the Pan-Arab leadership of the Hussein family because they were (initially) willing to reach an accomodation in return for Zionist support while he failed to reach any understanding with Palestinian Arab leaders.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Ruppin" id="w">Arthur Ruppin</a>, formerly in charge of the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Agency_for_Israel" id="w">Jewish Agency</a>, Weizmann and other Zionist leaders failed to grasp the nature and importance of the Arab question. Ruppin told the Agency in May 1936: &#34;Dr Weizmann once told me how he received the Balfour Declaration. And when I asked him, &#39;And what did you think then in reality on the Arab question?&#39; he replied, &#39;The English told us that [there are] some hundred of thousands [of] blacks there, and this has no importance.&#39; This shows me that at that time our leaders didn&#39;t have a clue regarding the Arab question, and even much later they relegated this question to the margins.&#34;<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup>
</p><a id="Jabotinsky" name="Jabotinsky"></a><h4>Jabotinsky</h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Jabotinsky" id="w">Vladimir Jabotinsky</a>, the leader of the <a href="/wiki/Revisionist_Zionism" id="w">Revisionist Zionists</a>, thought the Arabs were completely irrelevant to the question of Zionism except as enemies.

<a id="Ben-Gurion" name="Ben-Gurion"></a><h4>Ben-Gurion</h4>
<p>In public, Ben-Gurion upheld the official position of his party that denied the necessity of force in achieving Zionist goals. Unlike Weizmann, Ben-Gurion did have a realistic view of the strong attachment of Arab Palestinians to the Palestinian soil. In 1938 he said: &#39;In our political argument abroad we minimize Arab opposition to us. But let us not ignore the truth among ourselves. [...] A people which fights against [what it conceives as] the usurpation of its land will not tire so easily.&#39;<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> According to Flapan Ben-Gurions assesment of Arab feelings led him to an even more militant line on the need to build up Jewish military strength: &#39;I believe in our power, in our power which will grow, and if it will grow agreement will come...&#39;.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>

A minority of Zionists, including the Socialist Zionist movement <a href="/wiki/Hashomer_Hatzair" id="w">Hashomer Hatzair</a>, sought to create a bi-national state.  However, this approach was unpopular with both Arabs and Jews.</p>
<a id="Zionist_Para-Military_Organizations" name="Zionist_Para-Military_Organizations"></a><h4>Zionist Para-Military Organizations</h4>
<p>In response to Arab attacks under the Turks, the Zionists in Palestine established <a href="/wiki/Hashomer" id="w">Hashomer</a> (the Guardian), a self-defence organization.  After the Jaffa Riots, an organization of Jewish Legion veterans was created, <a href="/wiki/Haganah" id="w">Haganah</a> (Defence) to defend Jewish communities against rioters.
In 1931,  following the Revisionist Zionist departure from the Zionist Movement, a group of revisionists left Haganah and founded the <a href="/wiki/Irgun" id="w">Irgun</a> Tzvai Leumi (National Military Organization), also known as Etzel.</p>
<a id="British_Immigration_Restrictions" name="British_Immigration_Restrictions"></a><h3>British Immigration Restrictions</h3>
<p>British support for Zionism was always controversial and the issue was periodically debated in <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons" id="w">Parliament</a>. Following the Arab riots in 1922, Colonial Secretary <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" id="w">Winston Churchill</a> decided to remove the Transjordan area of Palestine and use it to fulfill British promises to <a href="/wiki/Sharif_Hussein" id="w">Sharif Hussein</a>, making <a href="/wiki/Abdullah_I_of_Jordan" id="w">one of his sons</a> King of <a href="/wiki/Transjordan" id="w">Transjordan</a>.</p>
<p>Churchill also restricted Jewish migration to an anual quote decided by the British. Certificates allowing migration were distributed by the Jewish Agency. Jews with 1000 Pounds in cash or Jewish professionals with 500 Pounds in cash could emigrate freely. Churchill&#39;s reforms made it hard for <a href="/wiki/Arab_Jews" id="w">Arab Jews</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Jews" id="w">Orthodox Jews</a> and <a href="/wiki/Revisionist_Zionists" id="w">Revisionist Zionists</a> to migrate to Palestine as the Jewish Agency was dominated by European Zionists, and increasingly by Socialist Zionists.
Immigration restrictions did, however mean that Jewish immigrants to Palestine had to prove their loyalty and dedication by spending years preparing for migration. Many immigrants arrived after undergoing agricultural and ideological training and learning Hebrew.</p>
<a id="The_rise_of_Hitler_and_illegal_migration" name="The_rise_of_Hitler_and_illegal_migration"></a><h4>The rise of Hitler and illegal migration</h4>
<p>{{See also}}
The rise to power of <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a> in Germany in 1933 produced a powerful new impetus for Zionism. The claim that Jews could live securely as minorities in Christian societies was deeply undermined. At the same time most countries closed their doors to Jewish immigration. A <a href="/wiki/Aliyah#Fifth Aliyah (1929-1939)" id="w">wave of migrants</a> headed for Palestine. Those unable to pay the fees demanded by the British had to join waiting lists. </p>
<p>Nazi efforts to push Jews out of Germany were undermined by their refusal to allow Jews to take their property with them. In response <a href="/wiki/Arlozorov" id="w">Arlozorov</a> negotiated an agreement with the Nazis, the <a href="/wiki/Haavara_agreement" id="w">Haavara agreement</a>, whereby Jews could export capital goods to Palestine.  In Palestine the goods were sold and the income given to the migrants. As a result of this agreement Arlozorov was assassinated by the Irgun.</p>
<p>In 1934 the Revisionists started organizing <a href="/wiki/Aliyah_Bet" id="w">illegal emigration</a> to Palestine. The Jewish population of Palestine began to rise fast and the financial influx led to an economic boom, but the rapid rise of Jewish migration led to an <a href="/wiki/Arab_revolt" id="w">Arab revolt</a>. In 1938 the pressure in Europe led left-wing Zionists to organize illegal immigration too.</p>

In Britain as elsewhere in Europe, the 1930s saw an increase in <a href="/wiki/Antisemitism" id="w">antisemitism</a>. A British politician, <a href="/wiki/Oswald_Mosley" id="w">Oswald Mosley</a>, formed the <a href="/wiki/British_Union_of_Fascists" id="w">British Union of Fascists</a>, which claimed that &#34;the Jews&#34; were leading Britain to war and campaigned for peace with Germany.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> British support for Zionism was further undermined by the <a href="/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine" id="w">1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine</a> and concern that millions of Jews would soon be seeking entry to Palestine.</p>
<p>In 1939 the British issued a <a href="/wiki/1939_White_Paper" id="w">White Paper</a>, announcing that they were withdrawing from the Balfour Declaration. A <a href="/wiki/Jewish_National_Home" id="w">Jewish National Home</a> now existed and their obligations were fulfilled. Further migration would be harmful to the Arab population.
A further 10,000 Jews a year would be admitted from 1939 to 1944 as well as a one-time allowance of 25,000 in view of the situation in Europe. After that Jewish migration would require agreement of the Arab majority (by this time Jews were about a third of the population). The British promised Palestine independence by 1949 and banned Jews from purchasing land in 95% of Palestine.</p>

In 1938–39 the Zionist movement had 1,040,540 members in 61 countries.  Zionism was banned in Turkey. Likewise though a significant proportion of the movement&#39;s supporters originally came from the <a href="/wiki/USSR" id="w">USSR</a>, under <a href="/wiki/Stalin" id="w">Stalin</a> Zionism and Orthodox Judaism were banned and Jews were prominent among the victims of the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_genocide" id="w">Soviet genocide</a>. </p>
<p>The following figures relate to the last pre-war Zionist congress in Geneva, 1939. Elections for the congress were held in 48 countries and 529 delegates attended. Members of the movement voted for the parties. Each party submitted a delegate list. Seats were distributed to the parties according to the number of votes they obtained and candidates elected in the order in which they were named on the list. This system today forms the basis for Israeli elections.</p>

<p>{{main}}
During the Holocaust Europe&#39;s Jews were cut off from the outside world and systematically impoverished, starved and eventually murdered. Where Jews did succeed in fighting the Nazis, Zionists were prominent in the resistance. </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto_uprising" id="w">Warsaw Ghetto uprising</a> was commanded by a Zionist, <a href="/wiki/Mordechaj_Anielewicz" id="w">Mordechaj Anielewicz</a>, and Zionists played a leading role in the struggle.  The uprising&#39;s survivors eventually made their way to Palestine and founded two Kibutzim: <a href="/wiki/Lohamey_ha-Geta%26%2339%3Bot" id="w">Lohamey ha-Geta&#39;ot</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yad_Mordechai" id="w">Yad Mordechai</a>.</p>
<p>In Palestine the Zionist leadership instructed all able-bodied Jews to volunteer for the British Army.  In addition there was an effort to parachute fighters into Europe, though little came of this. Fearing a Nazi invasion, the Jewish community prepared for a final stand to be made against the Nazis.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>Overall there was little they could do. In the words of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Segev" id="w">Tom Segev</a>: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>&#34;The story of the yishuv leaders during the Holocuast was essentially one of helplessness. They rescued a few thousand Jews from Europe. They could, perhaps have saved more, but they could not save millions.&#34;<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Efforts were made to offer the Nazis money for the release of Jews.  However, these efforts were systematically (and, according to Segev, cynically) destroyed by the British.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p> 
<p>The 1942 Zionist conference could not be held because of the war. Instead 600 Jewish leaders (not just Zionists) met in a hotel in the Biltmore Hotel in New York and adopted a statement known as the <a href="/wiki/Biltmore_Program" id="w">Biltmore Program</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.mideastweb.org/biltmore_program.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.mideastweb.org/biltmore_program.htm">http://www.mideastweb.org/biltmore_program.htm</a>. They agreed that when the war ended all Jewish organizations would fight to ensure free Jewish migration into Palestine.</p>
<p>The Biltmore Program called for &#34;Palestine [to] be established as a Jewish Commonwealth&#34;. <a href="/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion" id="w">David Ben-Gurion</a>, who dominated the conference, formulated the Zionists&#39; demand &#39;not as a Jewish state in Palestine but as Palestine as a Jewish state&#39;<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup>. It was significant in that all US Jewish organizations were now united in agreement on the need for a Jewish state in Palestine.          </p>
<p>From the beginning of the forties the Zionist movement stopped paying attention to the &#39;Arab question&#39;. The reason is that it was expected that any solution, whether a Jewish state in all of Palestine, partition, or an international protectorate, would have to be imposed on the Palestinian Arabs by force, because of their refusal to compromise<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup>. According to Teveth a war was &#39;made inevitable after the Biltmore Plan of 1942 declared Zionism&#39;s explicit aim to be a Jewish state, which the Arabs were determined to oppose by force.&#39;<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Impact_of_the_Holocaust" name="Impact_of_the_Holocaust"></a><h3>Impact of the Holocaust</h3>
<p>{{see also}}</p>
<p>The Nazi-inspired genocide in Europe had grave consequences for the Zionists.
</p>
<ol>
<li>A large section of the membership was wiped out. The damage was particularly great in Poland where about a third of the Zionist members had lived (the Russian membership had been lost to communism).</li>
<li>Those Jews who were not killed lost their possessions; the ability of the Zionist movement to raise money in Europe was severely reduced.</li></ol>
<p>This calamity led to important changes in Jewish and Zionist politics:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Many Jews were now desperate to leave Europe and willing to take grave risks for that purpose</li>
<li>All Jews now agreed on the need for a Jewish state where Jews could live free of the fear of persecution and which would provide a haven in times of persecution.</li>
<li>The Jews of the USA were now the dominant force in Jewish politics.</li>
<li>More Jews were prepared to mobilize on behalf of their brethren.</li>
<li>Britain was now weakened and less able to resist international pressure.</li></ol>

<p>In 1945, President Truman sent a personal representative, <a href="/wiki/Earl_G._Harrison" id="w">Earl G. Harrison</a>, to investigate the situation of the Jewish survivors in Europe. Harrison reported that
</p><blockquote>
<p>substantial unofficial and unauthorized movements of people must be expected, and these will require considerable force to prevent, for the patience of many of the persons involved is, and in my opinion with justification, nearing the breaking point. It cannot be overemphasized that many of these people are now desperate, that they have become accustomed under German rule to employ every possible means to reach their end, and that the fear of death does not restrain them.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Despite winning the 1946 British election with a manifesto promising to create a Jewish state in Palestine, the Labour Government succumbed to Foreign Office pressure and kept Palestine closed to Jewish migration.</p>
<p>In Europe former <a href="/wiki/Jewish_partisans" id="w">Jewish partisans</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Abba_Kovner" id="w">Abba Kovner</a> began to organize escape routes taking Jews from Eastern Europe down to the Mediterranean where the Jewish Agency organized ships to illegally carry them to Palestine.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>The British government responded to this movement by trying to force Jews to return to their places of origin. Holocaust survivors entering the British Zone were denied assistance or forced to live in hostels with former Nazi collaborators (Britain gave asylum to a large number of <a href="/wiki/30th_Waffen_Grenadier_Division_of_the_SS_(2nd_Russian)" id="w">Belorussian Nazi collaborators</a> after the war). In American-controlled zones, political pressure from Washington allowed Jews to live in their won quarters and meant the US Army helped Jews trying to escape the centres of genocide.</p>

<p>In 1947 Britain announced its intention to withdraw from Palestine. An <a href="/wiki/UNSCOP" id="w">United Nations Special committee</a> investigated the situation and offered two solutions : 
</p>
<ol>
<li>to establish a bi-national state in Palestine (the minority option);</li>
<li>to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.</li></ol>
<p>From the Zionist point of view, the second option corresponded to their goal and they gave full support to this.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/29_November" id="w">29 November</a> the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" id="w">United Nations General Assembly</a> voted to <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine" id="w">partition Palestine</a> into an Arab state and a Jewish state (with Jerusalem becoming an international enclave). Amid public rejoicing in Jewish communities in Palestine, the Jewish Agency accepted the plan. The Palestinian Arab leadership and the Arab League rejected the decision and announced that they would not abide by it. <a href="/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_Civil_War_in_Mandate_Palestine" id="w">Civil conflict between the Arabs and Jews in Palestine</a> ensued immediately.</p>

On <a href="/wiki/14_May" id="w">14 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1948" id="w">1948</a> the leaders of the Jewish community in Palestine made a <a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_(Israel)" id="w">declaration of independence</a>, and the state of Israel was established. This marked a major turning point in the Zionist movement, as its principal goal had now been accomplished. Many Zionist institutions were reshaped, and the three military movements combined to form the <a href="/wiki/Israel_Defence_Forces" id="w">Israel Defence Forces</a>. The continuing conflict with the Arabs can be read in the article on the <a href="/wiki/History_of_Israel" id="w">History of Israel</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict" id="w">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>.</p>
<p>Since 1948 the international Zionist movement has undertaken a variety of roles in support of Israel. These have included the encouragement of immigration, assisting the absorption and integration of immigrants, fundraising on behalf of settlement and development projects in Israel, the encouragement of private capital investment in Israel, and mobilization of world public opinion in support of Israel.
Most Jews have come to identify as Zionists, in the sense that they support the State of Israel even if they do not choose to live there. This worldwide support has been of vital importance to Israel, both politically and financially. </p>
<p>The 1967 war between Israel and the Arab states (the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Six-Day_War" id="w">Six-Day War</a>&#34;) marked a major turning point in the history of Israel and of Zionism. Israeli forces captured the eastern half of Jerusalem, including the holiest of Jewish religious sites, the <a href="/wiki/Western_Wall" id="w">Western Wall</a> of the ancient Temple. They also took over the remaining territories of pre-1948 Palestine, the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" id="w">West Bank</a> (from Jordan) and the <a href="/wiki/Gaza_Strip" id="w">Gaza Strip</a> (from <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>). Religious Jews regarded the West Bank (ancient <a href="/wiki/Judaea" id="w">Judaea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Samaria" id="w">Samaria</a>) as an integral part of Eretz Israel, and within Israel voices of the political Right soon began to argue that these territories should be permanently retained. Zionist groups began to build Jewish settlements in the territories as a means of establishing &#34;facts on the ground&#34; that would make an Israeli withdrawal impossible.</p>
<p>The 28th Zionist Congress (Jerusalem, 1968) adopted the following five principles, known as the &#34;Jerusalem Program&#34;, as the aims of contemporary Zionism:<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The unity of the Jewish people and the centrality of Israel in Jewish life</li>
<li>The ingathering of the Jewish people in the historic homeland, Eretz Israel, through <a href="/wiki/Aliyah" id="w">aliyah</a> from all countries</li>
<li>The strengthening of the State of Israel, based on the &#34;prophetic vision of justice and peace&#34;</li>
<li>The preservation of the identity of the Jewish people through the fostering of Jewish, Hebrew and Zionist education and of Jewish spiritual and cultural values</li>
<li>The protection of Jewish rights everywhere.</li></ul>
<p>Control of the West Bank and Gaza placed Israel in the position of control over a large population of Palestinian Arabs. Whether or not there had been a distinct Palestinian national identity in the 1920s may be debated, but there is no doubt that by the 1960s such an identity was firmly established &#8212; the founders of Zionism had thus, ironically, created two new nationalities, Israeli and Palestinian, instead of one.</p>

There are a number of critics of Zionism, ranging from Jewish anti-Zionists to pro-Palestinian activists. Some of the most vocal critics of Zionism have tended to be Palestinians and other <a href="/wiki/Arabs" id="w">Arabs</a>,{{Fact}} many of whom view Israel as wrongfully occupying what they view as the Arab land of <a href="/wiki/Palestine" id="w">Palestine</a>.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup>  Such critics generally opposed Israel&#39;s creation in 1948, and continue to criticize the Zionist movement which underlies it.  These critics view the changes in demographic balance which accompanied the creation of Israel, including the displacement of some 700,000 Arab <a href="/wiki/Palestinian_refugee" id="w">refugees</a>,<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup>, the displacement of 600,000 Jewish refugees from Arab lands <sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup>, and the accompanying violence, as negative but inevitable consequences of Zionism and the concept of a <a href="/wiki/Jewish_State" id="w">Jewish State</a>.  Critics of Zionism, such as <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Massad" id="w">Joseph Massad</a> of <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" id="w">Columbia University</a> have asserted that Zionism is a form of <a href="/wiki/Zionism_and_racism" id="w">racism</a>,<sup id="_ref-MassadAlAhram_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MassadAlAhram" title="">[79]</a></sup> both in its support of Israel as a Jewish State, and in its continuing policies such as the <a href="/wiki/Law_of_Return" id="w">Law of Return</a>.</p>
<p>While most Jewish groups are pro-Zionist, some liberal and <a href="/wiki/Haredi_Judaism" id="w">Haredi</a> Jewish communities (most vocally the <a href="/wiki/Satmar" id="w">Satmar</a> Hasidim and the <a href="/wiki/Neturei_Karta" id="w">Neturei Karta</a> group), oppose Zionism on religious grounds.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup>  Other non-Zionist Israeli movements, such as the <a href="/wiki/Canaanites_(movement)" id="w">Canaanite</a> movement led by poet <a href="/wiki/Yonatan_Ratosh" id="w">Yonatan Ratosh</a> in the 1930s and 1940s, have argued that &#34;Israeli&#34; should be a new pan-ethnic <a href="/wiki/Nationality" id="w">nationality</a>.
