<p><b><a href="/wiki/Bee" id="w">Bees</a></b> can suffer serious effects from <b><a href="/wiki/Toxicity" id="w">toxic</a> chemicals</b> in their environment. This includes various man-made chemicals, such as <a href="/wiki/Insecticide" id="w">insecticides</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fertilizers" id="w">fertilizers</a>, as well as a variety of naturally-occurring chemicals from plants, such as <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" id="w">ethanol</a> resulting from the <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fermentation" id="w">fermentation</a> of organic material.  Bee <a href="/wiki/Drunkenness" id="w">intoxication</a> can result from exposure to <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" id="w">ethanol</a> from fermented nectar, ripe fruits, and manmade and natural chemicals in the environment.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The effects of alcohol on bees are sufficiently similar to the <a href="/wiki/Effects_of_alcohol_on_the_body" id="w">effects of alcohol on humans</a> that <a href="/wiki/Honey_bee" id="w">honey bees</a> have been used as models of human ethanol intoxication.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> However, the metabolism of bees and humans is sufficiently different that bees can safely collect nectars from plants that contain compounds toxic to humans. The <a href="/wiki/Honey" id="w">honey</a> produced by bees from these toxic nectars can be poisonous if consumed by humans. Many humans have eaten toxic honey and become quite ill as a result. </p>
<p>Natural processes can also introduce toxic substances into nontoxic honey produced from nontoxic nectar. Microorganisms in honey can convert some of the sugars in honey to the toxic compound ethanol. This process of <a href="/wiki/Ethanol_fermentation" id="w">ethanol fermentation</a> is intentionally harnessed to produce the alcoholic beverage called <a href="/wiki/Mead" id="w">mead</a> from fermented honey.</p>

The introduction of certain chemical substances&#8212;such as ethanol or pesticides or defensive toxic biochemicals produced by plants&#8212;to a bee&#39;s environment can cause the bee to display abnormal or unusual behavior and disorientation. In sufficient quantities, such chemicals can poison and even kill the bee.</p>
<p>The effects of alcohol on bees have long been recognized. For example, John Cumming described the effect in an 1864 publication on <a href="/wiki/Beekeeping" id="w">beekeeping</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>When bees become intoxicated from ethanol consumption or poisoned with other chemicals, their balance is affected, and they are wobbly when they walk. Charles Abramson&#39;s group at <a href="/wiki/Oklahoma_State_University" id="w">Oklahoma State University</a> has put inebriated bees on running wheels, where they exhibit locomotion difficulties. They also put honey bees in shuttle-boxes that used a stimulus to encourage the bees to move, and found that they were less mobile as they became more intoxicated.<sup id="_ref-Abramson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Abramson" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A temulent bee is more likely to stick out its tongue, or <a href="/wiki/Proboscis" id="w">proboscis</a>. Inebriated bees spend less time flying. If a bee is sufficiently intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result.<sup id="_ref-Abramson_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Abramson" title="">[5]</a></sup> Bozic et al (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some honey bees like to consume fermented nectars containing ethanol more than others, and become notorious chronic inebriates around the hives. Bee colonies station guard bees outside the hives, and these will keep the inebriated bees from entering the hive and being disruptive; intoxicated bees are forced to stay out of the hive until they sober up.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> If a bee is a repeat offender and returns in an inebriated state to the hive  too often, the &#34;bee bouncers&#34; will chew the offending  bee&#39;s legs off.<sup id="_ref-Abramson_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Abramson" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Exposure to alcohol can have a prolonged effect on bees, lasting as long as 48 hours.<sup id="_ref-Beer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Beer" title="">[10]</a></sup> This phenomenon is also observed in fruit flies<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> and is connected to the neurotransmitter <a href="/wiki/Octopamine" id="w">octopamine</a> in fruit flies, which is also present in bees.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Bees_as_ethanol_inebriation_models" name="Bees_as_ethanol_inebriation_models"></a><h3>Bees as ethanol inebriation models</h3>
<p>Recent advances have led to the realization that bee inebriation models are potentially valuable for understanding vertebrate and even human ethanol intoxication:</p>
<p /><blockquote>&#34;Advances over the past three decades in our understanding of nervous systems are impressive and come from a multifaceted approach to the study of both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. An almost unexpected by-product of the parallel investigation of vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems that is explored in this article is the emergent view of an intricate web of evolutionary homology and convergence exhibited in the structure and function of the nervous systems of these two large, paraphyletic groups of animals.&#34;<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>The behavior of honey bees intoxicated by ethanol is being studied by scientists at <a href="/wiki/The_Ohio_State_University" id="w">The Ohio State University</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma" id="w">University of Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Ljubljana" id="w">University of Ljubljana</a> in <a href="/wiki/Slovenia" id="w">Slovenia</a>, and other sites as a potential model of the effects of alcohol on humans. At the Oklahoma State University, for example, Abramson&#39;s research found significant correlations between the reactions of bees and other vertebrates to ethanol exposure.</p>
<p /><blockquote>&#34;The purpose of this experiment was to test the feasibility of creating an animal model of ethanol consumption using social insects.... The experiments on consumption, locomotion, and learning suggest that exposure to ethanol influences behavior of honey bees similar to that observed in experiments with analogous vertebrates.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Abramson_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Abramson" title="">[5]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>It has thus been found that &#34;the honey bee nervous system is similar to that of vertebrates&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ScienceDaily_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ScienceDaily" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Wright_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wright" title="">[15]</a></sup></p> These similarities are pronounced enough to even make it possible to derive information on the functioning of human brains from how bees react to certain chemicals. Julie Mustard, a researcher at Ohio State, explained that:

<p /><blockquote>&#34;On the molecular level, the brains of honey bees and humans work the same. Knowing how chronic alcohol use affects genes and proteins in the honey bee brain may help us eventually understand how alcoholism affects memory and behavior in humans, as well as the molecular basis of addiction.&#34;<sup id="_ref-ScienceDaily_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ScienceDaily" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Mustard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mustard" title="">[16]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>The evaluation of a bee model for ethanol inebration of vertebrates has just begun, but appears to be promising. The bees are fed ethanol solutions and their behavior observed.<sup id="_ref-Abramson_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Abramson" title="">[5]</a></sup> Researchers place the bees in tiny harnesses, and feed them varying concentrations of alcohol introduced into sugar solutions.<sup id="_ref-ScienceDaily_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ScienceDaily" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Abramson_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Abramson" title="">[5]</a></sup> Tests of locomotion, foraging, social interaction and aggressiveness are performed. Mustard has noted that &#34;Alcohol affects bees and humans in similar ways&#8212;it impairs motor functioning along with learning and memory processing.&#34;<sup id="_ref-ScienceDaily_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ScienceDaily" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Mustard_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mustard" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>The interaction of bees with <a href="/wiki/Antabuse" id="w">antabuse</a> (disulfiram, a common medication administered as a treatment for alcoholism) has been tested as well.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

Bees can be severely and even fatally affected by <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" id="w">pesticides</a>, fertilizers and other chemicals that man has introduced into the environment. They can appear inebriated and dizzy, and even die. This is serious because it has substantial economic consequences for agriculture.

This problem has been the object of growing concern.

<a id="Natural_compounds" name="Natural_compounds"></a><h3>Natural compounds</h3>
<p>Bees and other <a href="/wiki/Hymenoptera" id="w">Hymenoptera</a> can also be substantially  affected by natural compounds in the environment besides ethanol.

<p>Detzel and Wink (1993) published an extensive review of 63 types of plant allelochemicals (<a href="/wiki/Alkaloids" id="w">alkaloids</a>, <a href="/wiki/Terpenes" id="w">terpenes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Glycosides" id="w">glycosides</a>, etc.) and their effects on bees when consumed.

<p>Various plants are known to have pollen which is toxic to honey bees, in some cases killing the adults (e.g., <i><a href="/wiki/Zigadenus" id="w">Zigadenus</a></i>), in other cases only a problem when passed to the brood (e.g., <i><a href="/wiki/Heliconia" id="w">Heliconia</a></i>).

<a id="Bee_inebriation_in_pollination" name="Bee_inebriation_in_pollination"></a><h3>Bee inebriation in pollination</h3>
	 
<p>Some plants reportedly rely on using intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation as part of their reproductive strategy. 
<div style="wigth:200px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:200px-Coryanthes_verrucolineata_Orchi_04.jpg" title="[[Bucket orchid]]"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200px-Coryanthes_verrucolineata_Orchi_04.jpg" alt="[[Bucket orchid]]" title="[[Bucket orchid]]" class="location-right type-thumb" width="200px" />

<div class="thumbcaption"><a href="/wiki/Bucket_orchid" id="w">Bucket orchid</a></div></div>
 	
One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American <a href="/wiki/Bucket_orchid" id="w">bucket orchid</a> (<i>Coryanthes</i> sp.), an <a href="/wiki/Epiphyte" id="w">epiphyte</a>. The bucket orchid attracts male <a href="/wiki/Euglossini" id="w">euglossine bees</a> with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females. </p>
<p>However, the flower is constructed in such a way as to make the surface almost impossible to cling to, with smooth, downward-pointing hairs; the bees commonly slip and fall into the fluid in the bucket, and the only navigable route out is a narrow, constricting passage that either glues a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pollinium" id="w">pollinium</a>&#34; (a pollen sack) on their body (if the flower has not yet been visited) or removes any pollinium that is there (if the flower has already been visited). The passageway constricts after a bee has entered, and holds it there for a few minutes, allowing the glue to dry and securing the pollinium. It has been suggested  that this process involves &#34;inebriation&#34; of the bees,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> but this effect has never been confirmed. </p>
<p>In this way, the bucket orchid passes its pollen from flower to flower. This mechanism is almost but not quite species specific, as it is possible for a few closely-related bees to pollinate any given species of orchid, as long as the bees are similar in size and are attracted by the same compounds.<sup id="_ref-Dressler_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dressler" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Van der Pijl and Dodson (1966) observed that bees of the genera <i><a href="/wiki/Eulaema" id="w">Eulaema</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Xylocopa" id="w">Xylocopa</a></i> exhibit symptoms of inebriation after consuming nectar from the orchids <i><a href="/wiki/Sobralia" id="w">Sobralia violacea</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Sobralia" id="w">Sobralia rosea</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Gongora" id="w">Gongora horichiana</a></i> orchid was suspected by Lanau (1992) of producing <a href="/wiki/Pheromone" id="w">pheromones</a> like a female euglossine bee<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup>
and even somewhat resembles a female euglossine bee shape, using these characteristics to spread its pollen:</p>
<p /><blockquote> &#34;A hapless male bee, blind drunk with the flower&#39;s overpowering pheromones, might well mistake a toadstool for a suitable mate, but the flower has made at least a modest attempt at recreating a beelike gestalt.&#34;<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>However, this seems unlikely, given that no one has ever documented that female euglossines produce pheromones; male euglossines produce pheromones using the chemicals they collect from orchids, and these pheromones attract females, rather than the converse, as Cullina (2004) suggests.</p>
<a id="Toxic_honey" name="Toxic_honey"></a><h2>Toxic honey</h2>
<p>Some substances which are toxic to humans have no effect on bees.
