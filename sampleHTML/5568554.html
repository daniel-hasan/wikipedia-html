<p><b>Michael Norman Kroger</b> is a businessman and a powerbroker within the Victorian division of the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" id="w">Liberal Party of Australia</a>.</p>
<p>Kroger became politically active while studying at <a href="/wiki/Monash_University" id="w">Monash University</a>. While president of the campus Liberal Club, Kroger is largely credited with the creation of the still-thriving <a href="/wiki/Sir_Robert_Menzies_Lecture" id="w">Sir Robert Menzies Lecture</a>. With his close friend <a href="/wiki/Peter_Costello" id="w">Peter Costello</a> he forged an alliance with moderate <a href="/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" id="w">Australian Labor Party</a> politicians in an effort to defeat far left-wing forces within the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Union_of_Students" id="w">Australian Union of Students</a>. He became President of the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Liberal_Students%26%2339%3B_Federation" id="w">Australian Liberal Students&#39; Federation</a> in 1978.</p>
<p>After graduating his association with Costello continued. Working as a solicitor he assisted Costello in winning the famous <a href="/wiki/1985" id="w">1985</a> <a href="/wiki/Snack_Foods_Limited" id="w"> Dollar Sweets</a> case. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1987" id="w">1987</a> and at the age of 30, Kroger was elected as the President of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party of Australia. He instituted a series of reforms, the most important was his move to increase the power of the party executive in preselections. While this led to several preselection challenges in <a href="/wiki/1988" id="w">1988</a> and <a href="/wiki/1989" id="w">1989</a> (most notably Costello&#39;s successful challenge against <a href="/wiki/Roger_Shipton" id="w">Roger Shipton</a> in <a href="/wiki/Division_of_Higgins" id="w"> Higgins</a>) it has also helped in the election of several young Victorian federal parliamentarians who are widely considered to have bright futures, although this pattern has not been replicated at state level. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kroger himself has often turned down opportunities to run in blue ribbon Liberal seats, notably such as <a href="/wiki/Division_of_Kooyong" id="w"> Kooyong</a> in <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a> and in <a href="/wiki/Division_of_Goldstein" id="w"> Goldstein</a> in <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, preferring to concentrate on family and business interests. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since the <a href="/wiki/1990s" id="w">1990s</a> the Victorian division of the Liberal Party has been factionalized between Kroger&#39;s supporters and those of <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Kennett" id="w">Jeff Kennett</a>. This has led to some bruising preselections, such as Kennett backed <a href="/wiki/Louise_Asher" id="w">Louise Asher</a> defeating the Kroger backed <a href="/wiki/Mitch_Fifield" id="w">Mitch Fifield</a> in <a href="/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Brighton" id="w"> Brighton</a> in 1999. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> However both backed <a href="/wiki/Petro_Georgiou" id="w">Petro Georgiou</a> when he was challenged for his preselection by <a href="/wiki/Josh_Frydenberg" id="w">Josh Frydenberg</a> in <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1993" id="w">1993</a> Kroger established an investment company, JT Campbell &#38; Co in and currently serves as chairman. Kroger has also spent five years (<a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a> to <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>) as a director of the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" id="w">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>His former wife <a href="/wiki/Helen_Kroger" id="w">Helen Kroger</a> was elected to the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Senate" id="w"> Senate</a> for Victoria at the <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> Federal Election after being preselected in the safe second position on the Liberal ticket, along with the aforementioned Mitch Fifield and number three candidate Scott Ryan. Despite their divorce, Michael and Helen remain close friends and are considered to be political allies.</p>
