<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Robinson was born in <a href="/wiki/Minneapolis%2C_Minnesota" id="w">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, of <a href="/wiki/Denmark" id="w">Danish</a> descent to Edith Jensen and Wayne Robinson.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/robinson_svend/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/robinson_svend/">http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/robinson_svend/</a> His father opposed the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" id="w">Vietnam War</a> and brought his family to live in Canada.

<a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2>Politics</h2>
<p>Robinson was the <a href="/wiki/New_Democratic_Party" id="w">New Democratic Party</a> (NDP) Member of <a href="/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons" id="w">Parliament</a> (MP) for ridings in the <a href="/wiki/Vancouver" id="w">Vancouver</a> suburb of <a href="/wiki/Burnaby%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Burnaby, British Columbia</a>, the third-largest city in <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a>.</p>
<p>As the longest-serving British Columbia MP of his time, in office from 1979 to 2004, Svend Robinson is notable for having been the first MP to <a href="/wiki/Come_out" id="w">come out</a> as <a href="/wiki/Gay" id="w">gay</a>, in spring 1988. He has since been followed by other gay and <a href="/wiki/Lesbian" id="w">lesbian</a> politicians in Parliament: <a href="/wiki/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois" id="w">Bloc Québécois</a> MP <a href="/wiki/R%C3%A9al_M%C3%A9nard" id="w">Réal Ménard</a>, fellow New Democrats <a href="/wiki/Libby_Davies" id="w">Libby Davies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bill_Siksay" id="w">Bill Siksay</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Liberal Party of Canada</a> MPs <a href="/wiki/Scott_Brison" id="w">Scott Brison</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mario_Silva" id="w">Mario Silva</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Senate" id="w">Senators</a> <a href="/wiki/Laurier_LaPierre" id="w">Laurier LaPierre</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nancy_Ruth" id="w">Nancy Ruth</a>.</p>
<p>Robinson ran to succeed <a href="/wiki/Audrey_McLaughlin" id="w">Audrey McLaughlin</a> as leader of the NDP at the 1995 <a href="/wiki/New_Democratic_Party_leadership_conventions" id="w">NDP leadership convention</a>, but withdrew in favour of <a href="/wiki/Alexa_McDonough" id="w">Alexa McDonough</a> after the first ballot even though he had received the most votes. Robinson realized that he could not defeat McDonough on the second ballot since most of the votes cast by supporters of third place finisher <a href="/wiki/Lorne_Nystrom" id="w">Lorne Nystrom</a> would have gone to her.</p>

<p>Robinson, a self-described <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialist</a>, is commonly regarded as being one of the most <a href="/wiki/Left-wing" id="w">left-wing</a> figures in Canadian politics. He is best known for his  negative views on American <a href="/wiki/Foreign_policy" id="w">foreign policy</a>, especially towards <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>, his distrust of <a href="/wiki/Corporation" id="w">corporations</a> and his criticism of <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a> and that country&#39;s policies. Party leader McDonough removed Robinson&#39;s critic responsibility for Middle East issues in 2002 for comments he made about Israel after attempting to meet with Yasser Arafat. Robinson has also been negative towards the <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">Chinese</a> government for its treatment of political dissidents, and for its policies in <a href="/wiki/Tibet" id="w">Tibet</a>.</p>
<p>Robinson was also involved in the <a href="/wiki/First_Nations" id="w">First Nations</a> <a href="/wiki/Aboriginal_land_claims" id="w">aboriginal land claims</a> standoff at <a href="/wiki/100_Mile_House" id="w">100 Mile House</a>; fighting for the right of <a href="/wiki/Sue_Rodriguez" id="w">Sue Rodriguez</a> to commit <a href="/wiki/Assisted_suicide" id="w">assisted suicide</a>; the anti-logging protests at <a href="/wiki/Clayoquot_Sound" id="w">Clayoquot Sound</a>; and <a href="/wiki/Quebec_City_protests" id="w">the protests</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Free_Trade_Agreement_of_the_Americas" id="w">Free Trade Agreement of the Americas</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Quebec_City_Summit_of_the_Americas" id="w">Summit of the Americas</a> in <a href="/wiki/Quebec_City" id="w">Quebec City</a> in April 2001. Sometimes he has acted on his political beliefs without legal immunity; in 1994 he was jailed for 14 days for contempt of court regarding his Clayoquot Sound activities. In 1985 he had been fined $750 for similar actions on the Queen Charlotte Islands.</p>
<p>In November 1998, Robinson was injured in a <a href="/wiki/Hiking" id="w">hiking</a> accident on <a href="/wiki/Gabriola_Island" id="w">Gabriola Island</a>, breaking his jaw and one ankle. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>He was one of the NDP&#39;s most prominent MPs, and was particularly popular in his own riding due to the high level of activity of his community offices, and his decision to be open about his sexual orientation while holding political office. Although controversial, he was a respected figure in Canadian progressive and activist circles. His critics saw him as self-righteous and too leftist. The former NDP premier of Ontario <a href="/wiki/Bob_Rae" id="w">Bob Rae</a> (no longer a party member at the time) described Robinson as a &#34;crank.&#34; Some have accused Robinson of bias against Israel, and in 2002 suggestions were made that his comments about Israel and the Middle East were <a href="/wiki/Anti-Semitic" id="w">anti-Semitic</a> (although no public figure said so openly). Robinson has strongly denied being anti-Jewish. Some Canadian Jews, including <a href="/wiki/Judy_Rebick" id="w">Judy Rebick</a>, publicly defended Robinson. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Robinson was involved in the <a href="/wiki/New_Politics_Initiative" id="w">New Politics Initiative</a> and the NDP&#39;s renewal process, although he remained committed to the party after the NPI&#39;s defeat at the 2001 general convention in <a href="/wiki/Winnipeg%2C_Manitoba" id="w">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a>.</p>
<p>Robinson sponsored an amendment to Canada&#39;s hate-crimes law to include hate crimes based on sexual orientation. Opponents of the amendment believe that this amendment provides insufficient safeguards for those who voice their opinions about homosexuality from conscience or from religious beliefs. Robinson claimed that his amendment would not suppress conscientious objection. Some religious groups and civil libertarians oppose the amendment because it will limit their right to free speech. Robinson also drew controversy from religious Canadians in 1999 when he submitted a petition from the <a href="/wiki/Humanist_Association_of_Canada" id="w">Humanist Association of Canada</a> calling for the <a href="/wiki/Preamble_to_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms" id="w">preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> to be amended to remove its mention of God. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> After which, Robinson was sent to the <a href="/wiki/Backbench" id="w">backbench</a>. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2003, <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Liberal</a> <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Senate" id="w">Senator</a> <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Grafstein" id="w">Jerry Grafstein</a> suggested that <a href="/wiki/September_11" id="w">September 11</a> be designated as &#34;America Day&#34; to commemorate the American victims of September 11, 2001. Robinson proposed that the day also be designated as &#34;Chile Day,&#34; to mark the overthrow of Chilean president <a href="/wiki/Salvador_Allende" id="w">Salvador Allende</a>&#39;s democratically elected government on September 11, 1973. Neither proposal was accepted.</p>
<a id="Theft_conviction" name="Theft_conviction"></a><h2>Theft conviction</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_15" id="w">April 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, Robinson confessed to the theft (on <a href="/wiki/April_9" id="w">April 9</a>) of a ring valued by the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police" id="w">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> at $21,500 <a href="/wiki/Canadian_dollar" id="w">CAD</a>. However, other quotes valued the item at $64,000. He claimed the theft was stress-related. </p>
<p>On October 26, 2005, Robinson revealed that he suffers from <a href="/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" id="w">bipolar disorder</a>. He then explained that he was not making a direct correlation between mental illness and criminal activity and took full responsibility for his actions. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> He attributed his mental health issues to the 1998 hiking accident.</p>
<p>He announced that he was going on a medical leave of absence and was stepping aside as a nominated candidate in the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2004" id="w">2004 federal election</a>. He surrendered on <a href="/wiki/April_14" id="w">April 14</a>, and was formally charged with one count of theft over $5,000 on <a href="/wiki/June_21" id="w">June 21</a>. On <a href="/wiki/August_6" id="w">August 6</a>, he pleaded guilty and was ordered to continue receiving psychiatric counselling and perform 100 hours of community service. He was sentenced to a year&#39;s probation and 100 hours of community service, but will not have a criminal record, a sentence the Crown described as &#34;appropriate.&#34; <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Robinson&#39;s long-time constituency assistant <a href="/wiki/Bill_Siksay" id="w">Bill Siksay</a> was nominated in his place as NDP candidate for Burnaby-Douglas; Siksay won the riding in the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2004" id="w">federal election</a> in June 2004.</p>
<a id="Recent_activities" name="Recent_activities"></a><h2>Recent activities</h2>
<p>Robinson was an NDP candidate in the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006" id="w">2006 federal election</a>, challenging Liberal MP <a href="/wiki/Hedy_Fry" id="w">Hedy Fry</a> in the riding of <a href="/wiki/Vancouver_Centre" id="w">Vancouver Centre</a>, which had not had an NDP or <a href="/wiki/Co-operative_Commonwealth_Federation" id="w">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a> MP since 1949. In December 2005, the Canadian magazine <i><a href="/wiki/Maclean%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">Maclean&#39;s</a></i> featured Robinson on the cover and in an editorial, calling for voters to reject him. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>. The following month, Robinson&#39;s candidacy was endorsed by the Vancouver newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/The_Georgia_Straight" id="w">The Georgia Straight</a>.</i><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>. At the election, in which the NDP performed strongly in most British Columbia ridings, Fry easily won re-election. The N.D.P. vote fell by 3.6% and the Liberal vote rose by 3.5%.</p>
<p>Robinson was employed by the British Columbia Government and Service Employees Union as an arbitrator and advocate. He also served on the NDP&#39;s federal executive as co-chair of the party&#39;s <a href="/wiki/LGBT" id="w">LGBT</a> Committee. <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>  It was rumoured that Robinson might be considering a run at provincial politics in the BC riding of <a href="/wiki/Burnaby_North" id="w">Burnaby North</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
