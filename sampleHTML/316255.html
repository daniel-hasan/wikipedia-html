<p>The <b>Avengers</b> are a <a href="/wiki/Fiction" id="w">fictional</a> <a href="/wiki/Superhero" id="w">superhero</a> team appearing in <a href="/wiki/Comic_book" id="w">comic books</a> published by <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Comics" id="w">Marvel Comics</a>. The team, comprising existing Marvel characters variously created by writer-editor <a href="/wiki/Stan_Lee" id="w">Stan Lee</a>, artist and co-plotter <a href="/wiki/Jack_Kirby" id="w">Jack Kirby</a> and others, <a href="/wiki/First_appearance" id="w">first appeared</a> in <i>The Avengers</i> vol. 1, #1 (Sept. 1963). </p>
<p>Tagged by the company as &#34;Earth’s Mightiest Heroes&#34;, the Avengers originally consisted of <a href="/wiki/Henry_Pym" id="w">Ant-Man</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wasp_(comics)" id="w">Wasp</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Comics)" id="w">Thor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Iron_Man" id="w">Iron Man</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Hulk_(comics)" id="w">Hulk</a>. Almost from inception, however, the roster has been fluid, with the Hulk departing<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Captain_America" id="w">Captain America</a> joining.<sup id="_ref-Av1n4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Av1n4" title="">[2]</a></sup> The rotating roster has become a hallmark of the team, although one theme remains consistent: the Avengers fight the foes no single superhero can withstand - hence their famous cry of &#34;Avengers Assemble!&#34; To that end, the team has featured humans, robots, gods, aliens, supernatural beings and even former villains.</p>

<p>In 1963, the Avengers debuted in their own comic book series, dated September of that year. The team was created by <a href="/wiki/Stan_Lee" id="w">Stan Lee</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jack_Kirby" id="w">Jack Kirby</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dick_Ayers" id="w">Dick Ayers</a>. This series ran for 403 issues from September of 1963 through September of 1996.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1984, Marvel published a four-issue <a href="/wiki/Limited_series" id="w">limited series</a> called <i><a href="/wiki/West_Coast_Avengers" id="w">West Coast Avengers</a></i> as a <a href="/wiki/Spin-off" id="w">spin-off</a> of <i>The Avengers</i>.</p>
<p>In 1985, Marvel launched an ongoing series following the success of the <i>West Coast Avengers</i> limited series. This series ran for a total of 102 issues under two titles from October 1985 through January 1994. The title changed to <i>Avengers West Coast</i> with issue #48.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1987, Marvel launched a second ongoing spin-off titled <i><a href="/wiki/Solo_Avengers" id="w">Solo Avengers</a></i>. This series ran for 40 issues, also under two titles from December 1987 through January 1991. The title changes to <i>Avengers Spotlight</i> with issue #21.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Between 1996 and 2004 Marvel relaunched the primary Avengers title three times.
</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1996, as part of the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Heroes_Reborn" id="w">Heroes Reborn</a>&#34; line, where Marvel contracted outside companies to produce four titles including <i>Avengers</i>. Part of the arrangement included revamping and restarting the Avengers&#39; history.<br/>The series ran for 13 issues from November 1996 through November 1997 and was written by Rob Liefeld with art by Jim Valentino. The final issue features a crossover with the other &#34;Heroes Reborn&#34; titles, and returned the character to the main Marvel Universe.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>In 1997, when the characters returned to its original continuity. The series ran for 84 issues from February 1998 through August 2004. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>In 1998, a 12 issue limited series titled &#34;Avengers Forever&#34; was published.

<ul>
<li>In 2004, to coincide with what would have been the 500th issue, Marvel changed the numbering of the issues. This series lasted four issues, from September through December 2004.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>In 2005, Marvel began publishing a new series featuring the Avengers titled <i><a href="/wiki/New_Avengers_(comics)" id="w">New Avengers</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>In 2007, two new titles were published, being the <a href="/wiki/Mighty_Avengers" id="w">Mighty Avengers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Avengers:_The_Initiative" id="w">Avengers: The Initiative</a>. The first, launched in March and written by <a href="/wiki/Brian_Michael_Bendis" id="w">Brian Michael Bendis</a>, features a team of Avengers composed of heroes that fought on the Pro-registration side of the <a href="/wiki/Civil_War" id="w">Civil War</a>.

The first issue features the <a href="/wiki/Asgardians_(Marvel_Comics)" id="w">Asgardian</a> <a href="/wiki/Trickster" id="w">trickster</a> god, <a href="/wiki/Loki_(comics)" id="w">Loki</a>, who seeks revenge against his adopted brother, <a href="/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Comics)" id="w">Thor</a>. Using an illusion, Loki tricks the <a href="/wiki/Hulk_(comics)" id="w">Hulk</a> into destroying a railroad track, and then diverts a radio call by <a href="/wiki/Rick_Jones_(comics)" id="w">Rick Jones</a> for help to Thor, whom Loki hopes will battle the Hulk. Unknown to Loki, the radio call is also answered by <a href="/wiki/Henry_Pym" id="w">Ant-Man</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Wasp_(comics)" id="w">Wasp</a> and <a href="/wiki/Iron_Man" id="w">Iron Man</a>.  After an initial misunderstanding, the heroes unite and defeat Loki. Ant-Man points out that the five work well together and suggests they form a combined team — with the Wasp naming the group the Avengers. The original members are known as the &#34;founding members,&#34; and courtesy of an Avengers Charter are responsible for the good name of the team. As a result, their wishes regarding the direction of the team are given additional weight and deference.  </p>
<p>The roster changes almost immediately; by the beginning of the second issue, Ant-Man has become Giant-Man and, at the end of the issue, the Hulk leaves once he realizes how much the others fear his unstable personality. Feeling responsible, the Avengers try to locate and contain the Hulk (a recurring theme in the early years of the team), which subsequently leads them into combat with <a href="/wiki/Namor" id="w">Namor the Sub-Mariner</a>. This would result in the first major milestone in the Avengers&#39; history - the revival and return of Captain America.<sup id="_ref-Av1n4_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Av1n4" title="">[2]</a></sup> Captain America joins the team eventually becoming field leader. Captain America is also given &#34;founding member&#34; status in the Hulk&#39;s place.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The Avengers go on to fight foes such as Captain America&#39;s wartime enemy <a href="/wiki/Baron_Zemo" id="w">Baron Zemo</a>, who in turn forms the <a href="/wiki/Masters_of_Evil" id="w">Masters of Evil</a>; the <a href="/wiki/Subterranea_(comics)" id="w">Lava Men</a>; <a href="/wiki/Kang_the_Conqueror" id="w">Kang the Conqueror</a>; <a href="/wiki/Wonder_Man" id="w">Wonder Man</a>; <a href="/wiki/Immortus" id="w">Immortus</a>; and <a href="/wiki/Count_Nefaria" id="w">Count Nefaria</a>.</p>
<p>The next milestone came when every member but Captain America resigns and is replaced by three former villains - <a href="/wiki/Hawkeye_(comics)" id="w">Hawkeye</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Scarlet_Witch" id="w">Scarlet Witch</a> and <a href="/wiki/Quicksilver_(comics)" id="w">Quicksilver</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Although lacking the raw power of the original team, &#34;Cap&#39;s Kooky Quartet&#34; (as they were sometimes jokingly called) proved their worth by fighting and defeating the <a href="/wiki/Swordsman_(comics)" id="w">Swordsman</a>; the original <a href="/wiki/Erik_Josten" id="w">Power Man</a>; <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Doom" id="w">Doctor Doom</a> and Kang once again. They are soon rejoined by Henry Pym (who changes his name to Goliath), the Wasp, <a href="/wiki/Hercules_(Marvel_Comics)" id="w">Hercules</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Black_Knight_(Dane_Whitman)" id="w">Black Knight</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Black_Widow_(Marvel_Comics)" id="w">Black Widow</a>, although the last two do not obtain official membership status until later in the book&#39;s history. </p>
<p>Under the tenure of <a href="/wiki/Roy_Thomas" id="w">Roy Thomas</a> as writer, the stories begin to focus more intently on characterization. The <a href="/wiki/Black_Panther_(comics)" id="w">Black Panther</a> joins the team, followed by the <a href="/wiki/Vision_(Marvel_Comics)" id="w">Vision</a>. Thomas also established that the Avengers are headquartered in a <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> building called <a href="/wiki/Avengers_Mansion" id="w">Avengers Mansion</a>, provided courtesy of Tony Stark (Iron Man&#39;s alter ego), who also funds the Avengers through the Maria Stark Foundation, a <a href="/wiki/Non-profit_organization" id="w">non-profit organization</a>. The mansion is serviced by <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis" id="w">Edwin Jarvis</a>, the Avengers&#39; faithful butler, and also furnished with <a href="/wiki/State_of_the_art" id="w">state-of-the-art</a> technology and defense systems, including the Avengers&#39; primary mode of transport: the five-engine Quinjets.</p>

Thomas continued his run into the early 1970s, with highlights including a version of the <a href="/wiki/Justice_League" id="w">Justice League</a> called the <a href="/wiki/Squadron_Supreme" id="w">Squadron Supreme</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Kree-Skrull_War" id="w">Kree-Skrull War</a>, a ten-part storyline about an epic battle between the <a href="/wiki/Kree" id="w">Kree</a> and <a href="/wiki/Skrull" id="w">Skrull</a> races and guest-starring the Kree hero <a href="/wiki/Mar-Vell" id="w">Captain Marvel</a>. This storyline also features the first disbanding of the Avengers, as Skrulls impersonating Captain America, Thor and Iron Man use their authority as founders of the team to disband it. The true founding Avengers, minus the Wasp, reform the team in the 100th issue in response to complaints from Jarvis.</p>
<p>The Vision also falls in love with the Scarlet Witch, who eventually responds with a love of her own. Their relationship, however, is tinged with sadness as the Vision believes himself to be inhuman and unworthy of her. </p>
<p>Writer <a href="/wiki/Steve_Englehart" id="w">Steve Englehart</a> continued with the emphasis on the cosmic, introducing <a href="/wiki/Mantis_(Marvel_Comics)" id="w">Mantis</a>, who joins the team along with the reformed Swordsman. Englehart linked her origins to the very beginnings of the Kree-Skrull conflict in a time-spanning adventure involving Kang the Conqueror and the mysterious <a href="/wiki/Immortus" id="w">Immortus</a>, who are revealed to be past and future versions of each other. Mantis is revealed to be the Celestial Madonna, who is destined to give birth to a being that would save the universe. This saga also reveals that the Vision&#39;s body had only been appropriated, and not created, by Ultron, and that it had originally belonged to the 1940s <a href="/wiki/Human_Torch_(android)" id="w">Human Torch</a>. With his origins now clear to him, the Vision finally summons up the courage to propose to the Scarlet Witch. The Celestial Madonna saga ends with their wedding, presided over by Immortus, a future version of Kang.</p>
<p>Englehart&#39;s tenure coincided with the debut of <a href="/wiki/George_P%C3%A9rez" id="w">George Pérez</a> as artist. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> After Englehart&#39;s departure, <a href="/wiki/Jim_Shooter" id="w">Jim Shooter</a> began as writer and penned several epics, including &#34;Bride of Ultron&#34;; the &#34;Nefaria Trilogy&#34; and the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Korvac_Saga" id="w">Korvac Saga</a>&#34; in which almost every Avenger who ever joined is featured in a final, climatic battle. New members added during this time include the <a href="/wiki/Beast_(comics)" id="w">Beast</a>; a resurrected <a href="/wiki/Wonder_Man" id="w">Wonder Man</a>; Captain America&#39;s former partner the <a href="/wiki/Falcon_(comics)" id="w">Falcon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carol_Danvers" id="w">Ms. Marvel</a>. </p>
<p>Shooter also introduced the character of <a href="/wiki/Henry_Peter_Gyrich" id="w">Henry Peter Gyrich</a>, the Avengers&#39; liaison to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council" id="w">United States National Security Council</a>. Gyrich is prejudiced against superhumans, and acts in a heavy-handed, obstructive manner, insisting that the Avengers follow government rules and regulations or else lose their priority status with the government. Among Gyrich&#39;s demands is that the active roster be trimmed down to only seven members, and that the <a href="/wiki/Falcon_(comics)" id="w">Falcon</a>, an <a href="/wiki/African_American" id="w">African American</a>, be admitted to the team to comply with <a href="/wiki/Affirmative_action" id="w">affirmative action</a> laws. This last action is particularly resented by Hawkeye, who because of the seven-member limit loses his slot to the Falcon. The Falcon, in turn, is unhappy to be the beneficiary of what he perceives to be <a href="/wiki/Tokenism" id="w">tokenism</a>, and decides to resign from the team, after which Hawkeye rejoins.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption"><i>The Avengers</i> vol. 1, #200. Art by <a href="/wiki/George_P%C3%A9rez" id="w">George Pérez</a>.</div>
Shooter&#39;s greatest contribution during this period was a storyline that chronicled the breakdown of Henry Pym. Shooter saw Pym&#39;s frequent changes of costume and name as symptomatic of an identity problem and an <a href="/wiki/Inferiority_complex" id="w">inferiority complex</a>. After abusing his wife; failing to win back the confidence of the Avengers with a ruse and being duped by the villain <a href="/wiki/Egghead_(comics)" id="w">Egghead</a>, Pym is jailed. The main writer during the 80&#39;s was <a href="/wiki/Roger_Stern" id="w">Roger Stern</a>, who resolved the Pym storyline by having Pym outwit Egghead and defeat the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil single-handedly, thereby proving his innocence. Pym reconciles with the Wasp, but they decide to remain apart. Pym also retires from superheroics, but returns some years later.</p>
<p>Stern developed several major storylines, such as &#34;Ultimate Vision&#34;; the formation of the West Coast Avengers; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Avengers_Under_Siege" id="w">Avengers Under Siege</a>&#34;, which involves the second <a href="/wiki/Baron_Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo" id="w">Baron Zemo</a>. Zemo reforms the Masters of Evil, now a virtual army of super villains, and conducts a coordinated attack on the Avengers in an attempt to break Captain America&#39;s spirit. The plan finally failed, but not before Hercules was beaten and rendered catatonic. This immediately led into the &#34;War on Olympus&#34; storyline, as an enraged Zeus decides the Avengers are to blame for Hercules&#39; injuries. New members during the 1980s included an African American Captain Marvel named <a href="/wiki/Monica_Rambeau" id="w">Monica Rambeau</a> (who became the team&#39;s new leader); <a href="/wiki/She-Hulk" id="w">She-Hulk</a>; <a href="/wiki/Tigra" id="w">Tigra</a>, Namor, and Hawkeye&#39;s wife, <a href="/wiki/Mockingbird_(Marvel_Comics)" id="w">Mockingbird</a>, while Henry Pym emerges from retirement to join the West Coast Avengers.  </p>
<p>In 1988, Stern left the title in the middle of a storyline after a disagreement with Editor <a href="/wiki/Mark_Gruenwald" id="w">Mark Gruenwald</a> over the removal of Captain Marvel as Avengers chairman. She was to appear incompetent and be replaced by Captain America. Gruenwald believed that Captain America&#39;s return as Avengers chairman would boost sales of the character&#39;s solo title. Stern disagreed and after expressing his views was dismissed from the title.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/John_Byrne" id="w">John Byrne</a> eventually took over writing both titles and made several significant contributions, including a revamp of the Vision; Wonder Man harboring feelings for the Scarlet Witch and the discovery that the children of the Scarlet Witch and the Vision are actually illusions. The loss of the Scarlet Witch&#39;s children and the Vision drives her insane, although she eventually recovers and rejoins the team. This, however, would have repercussions years later.</p>
<a id="The_1990s" name="The_1990s"></a><h3>The 1990s</h3>
<p>The 90s were a turbulent time for Marvel Comics, as the company adopted an aggressive business expansion model tied to increased publication. This coincided with a speculators&#39; boom (which was followed by an industry-wide slump, which proved devastating for Marvel: filing for <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy" id="w">bankruptcy</a> in 1997). <a href="/wiki/Bob_Harras" id="w">Bob Harras</a> and <a href="/wiki/Steve_Epting" id="w">Steve Epting</a> took over the title, and introduced a stable lineup with ongoing storylines and character development focused on the Black Knight, <a href="/wiki/Sersi" id="w">Sersi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Crystal_(comics)" id="w">Crystal</a>, Quicksilver, Hercules and the Vision. During this period, the team finds themselves facing increasingly murderous enemies, and are forced to question their rule against killing.</p>
<p>This culminated in &#34;<a href="/wiki/Operation:_Galactic_Storm" id="w">Operation: Galactic Storm</a>&#34;, a 19-part storyline that runs over all Avengers-related titles and showcases a conflict between the Kree and the <a href="/wiki/Shi%26%2339%3Bar" id="w">Shi&#39;ar Empire</a>. An argument of the actions of The Supreme Intelligence, which resulted in mass genocide, splits the team. Iron Man and several dissidents execute the Supreme Intelligence against the wishes of Captain America.</p>
<p>After the demise of the West Coast Avengers, Iron Man would form a proactive and aggressive team called <a href="/wiki/Force_Works" id="w">Force Works</a>. During the team&#39;s first mission Wonder Man is apparently killed again (his atoms are simply scattered and reform later). Force Works later disbands after it is revealed that Iron Man has become a murderer courtesy of the manipulations of the villain Kang.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

The team would be disrupted once again when in final battle against the gestalt psychic entity <a href="/wiki/Onslaught_(comics)" id="w">Onslaught</a>. The main team, along with the <a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Four" id="w">Fantastic Four</a> and others apparently die stopping Onslaught, although it is later revealed that <a href="/wiki/Franklin_Richards" id="w">Franklin Richards</a> preserves these heroes in the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Heroes_Reborn" id="w">Heroes Reborn</a>&#34; pocket universe.

<p>Marvel contracted out several titles set in the pocket universe to <a href="/wiki/Jim_Lee" id="w">Jim Lee</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rob_Liefeld" id="w">Rob Liefeld</a>, two of the founding creators of <a href="/wiki/Image_Comics" id="w">Image Comics</a>.

Busiek also concurrently wrote the limited series, <i><a href="/wiki/Avengers_Forever" id="w">Avengers Forever</a></i>, a time travel story that explores the history of the Avengers and resolves many outstanding questions and loose ends. New members during this run included the former Ms.Marvel, Carol Danvers (now Warbird); the revived Wonder Man; <a href="/wiki/Vance_Astrovik" id="w">Justice</a>; <a href="/wiki/Firestar" id="w">Firestar</a>; <a href="/wiki/Silverclaw" id="w">Silverclaw</a> and <a href="/wiki/Triathlon_(comics)" id="w">Triathlon</a>.</p>

<p>Pérez eventually left the title and Busiek completed his run with an epic storyline involving Kang and the destruction of several cities. <a href="/wiki/Geoff_Johns" id="w">Geoff Johns</a> began as writer and much of his run deals with the aftermath of the war as the Avengers are given international authority by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a>.
