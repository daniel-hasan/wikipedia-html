<p>This is a <b>list of characters</b> in the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_culture" id="w">Japanese</a> <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_(TV)" id="w">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></i> and the movies <i><a href="/wiki/Evangelion:_Death_and_Rebirth" id="w">Evangelion: Death and Rebirth</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_End_of_Evangelion" id="w">The End of Evangelion</a></i>.

<a id="Characters'_ages_and_birth_years" name="Characters'_ages_and_birth_years"></a><h1>Characters&#39; ages and birth years</h1>
<p>Most of <i>Evangelion</i> &#39;s characters&#39; ages were plotted before broadcasting the TV series, but their birthdays were not settled<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>. After the TV series finished, GAINAX released birthdays which were similar to those of each character&#39;s seiyuu, except Rei Ayanami, Toji Suzuhara, Kensuke Aida and Kaworu Nagisa<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>.This time, the characters&#39; birth years were still not revealed.</p>
<p>Adult characters&#39; birth years were simply calculated from their age, but there was an additional aspect in determining the children&#39;s ones. According to the Japanese educational system, in 2015 second graders of junior high school (eighth graders) are basically made up of children who were born from April 2, 2001 to April 1, 2002<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>. Children&#39;s birth years were set in proportion to this rule. However these birth years did not change the children&#39;s ages of 14 in year 2015. This is the reason why Asuka Langley Soryu and Toji Suzuhara were born in December 2001 and Hikari Horaki was born in February 2002, despite all children except Kaworu are 14 in 2015.</p>
<a id="Children" name="Children"></a><h1>Children</h1>
<p>In the Japanese dialogue for the original anime, the Eva pilots were always referred to as &#34;Children,&#34; even when referring to an individual pilot; the entries below use this designation. The English translation referred to the individual pilots as First Child, etc. In the <i><a href="/wiki/Rebuild_of_Evangelion" id="w">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></i> series, the expression &#34;(n)th Children&#34; is not used. Instead, the pilots are referred to as &#34;一番目の適格者(Ichibanme no tekikaku-sha: lit.The First Qualified Person/Candidate)&#34;, &#34;第一の少女(Dai-ichi no Shojo: lit.The First Girl), &#34;三人目の子供(San&#39;nin-me no kodomo: lit.The Third Child)&#34;, or &#34;第三の少年(Dai-san no Shonen: lit.The Third Boy).</p>

She is of mixed German and Japanese descent, but her nationality is American.

<p>Kōzō Fuyutsuki<sup id="_ref-essay_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-essay" title="">[20]</a></sup> (冬月 コウゾウ <i>Fuyutsuki Kōzō</i>) is NERV&#39;s Deputy Commander and Gendo Ikari&#39;s right hand man. He does not especially like Gendo, but he is the closest thing to a confidant that Gendo has in the series.</p>
<p>Once a professor of meta-biology at <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_University" id="w">Kyoto University</a>, Fuyutsuki became interested in the research and theories undertaken by Yui Ikari, and became her sponsor and mentor. Shortly thereafter, he was directed by his superiors to initiate a similar arrangement with Gendo Rokobungi. He bailed Rokobungi out of jail, and took him on as a research assistant, although he took an instant disliking to Gendo (thinking of him as a &#34;real bastard&#34;<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>) and was stunned when Yui later announced that she and Gendo were getting married. Later, after the Second Impact, Fuyutsuki traveled with Gendo to Antarctica and began to suspect that Gendo and his associates in SEELE were more powerful and dangerous than he originally realized. During this voyage, Gendo revealed that he had taken the name of Ikari. In 2003, Fuyutsuki discovered the true nature of the events leading up to Second Impact and SEELE&#39;s involvement in initiating that catastrophe for himself, and threatened Gendo with exposure of the massive deception concerning Second Impact to the public. Gendo led him into the GeoFront and <a href="/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_glossary#Central Dogma" id="w">Central Dogma</a>, revealed to him an incomplete prototype Eva, and asked Fuyutsuki to join him and &#34;create a new future for humankind, together with me.&#34; Fuyutsuki accepted the offer, but whether this agreement was out of idealism or self-preservation is not made clear in the series. In <i>The End of Evangelion</i> it is mentioned that SEELE had threatened Fuyutsuki with being &#39;disappeared&#39;, implying that his recruitment may have been a <a href="/wiki/Hobson%26%2339%3Bs_choice" id="w">Hobson&#39;s choice</a>.<sup id="_ref-Episode 21_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Episode 21" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Fuyutsuki was never more than a mentor and friend to Yui, it is implied that he was in love with her to some degree, as he was shocked to learn that she was marrying Gendo. In <i>The End of Evangelion</i> Lilith/Rei takes the form of Yui to achieve Fuyutsuki&#39;s Instrumentality.

<p>Makoto Hyuga<sup id="_ref-essay_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-essay" title="">[20]</a></sup> (日向 マコト <i>Hyūga Makoto</i>) is a First Lieutenant at NERV and one of the three main computer technicians directly serving under Commanders Ikari and Fuyutsuki in the command post of Central Dogma, the others being Aoba and Ibuki. Hyuga at first gives the impression of being something of a nerd, reading manga while on his break time, but is a highly skilled technician. His quick thinking and bravery help save NERV headquarters from the attack by <a href="/wiki/Angel_(Neon_Genesis_Evangelion)#Matariel" id="w">Matariel</a>, and he acts as a spy for Misato, helping her obtain information regarding NERV&#39;s machinations. He also arms NERV&#39;s self-destruct mechanism at Misato&#39;s order during Kaworu&#39;s attempt to breach Terminal Dogma.<sup id="_ref-Episode 24_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Episode 24" title="">[13]</a></sup> Hyuga states that he couldn&#39;t think of a better way of ending his life than being beside Misato. The true extent of his feelings for Misato is shown in <i>The End of Evangelion</i> as Rei/Lilith takes the form of Misato during Instrumentality and passionately kisses him; as he embraces her, he reverts to LCL.

<p>Maya Ibuki<sup id="_ref-essay_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-essay" title="">[20]</a></sup> (伊吹 マヤ <i>Ibuki Maya</i>) is a First Lieutenant at NERV and a computer technician who works primarily with Ritsuko Akagi. Her main role during the battles against the Angels is to constantly monitor the Eva pilots’ synchronization ratios and send various emergency commands to the Evas as ordered by Misato or Gendo. In spite of her profession, Maya despises violence of any sort, and is frequently shown becoming nauseous and averting her eyes during battles with the Angels, especially after Unit 01&#39;s battles with Bardiel and <a href="/wiki/Angel_(Neon_Genesis_Evangelion)#Zeruel" id="w">Zeruel</a>. Notably, in <i>The End of Evangelion</i>, Maya is the only NERV officer who is shown refusing to fight back against the <a href="/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_glossary#Japanese Strategic Self Defense Forces (JSSDF)" id="w">JSSDF</a> invaders. She rejects the gun Aoba hands her to defend herself, saying, &#34;I can&#39;t shoot this thing&#34;, not because she is unskilled, but because she has never shot it at a human being. Throughout much of the second half of <i>The End of Evangelion</i> Maya is hiding under her desk with her face buried in a pink pillow.</p>
<p>Maya holds Ritsuko in very high regard, and always refers to her as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Senpai" id="w">senpai</a>.&#34; In <i>The End of Evangelion</i>, Rei/Lilith penetrates Maya&#39;s AT field by assuming the form of Ritsuko and typing &#34;I need you&#34; on Maya&#39;s laptop. Maya exclaims &#34;Senpai!&#34;, eagerly embraces &#34;Ritsuko,&#34; and immediately reduces into <a href="/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_glossary#LCL" id="w">LCL</a>. This has led fans to debate whether or not Maya&#39;s feelings for Ritsuko have romantic or sexual undertones, in the same manner as the debate over the relationship between Shinji and Kaworu.
