<b>Brigadeiro</b> is a simple <a href="/wiki/Brazil" id="w">Brazilian</a> <a href="/wiki/Chocolate" id="w">chocolate</a> fudge candy created in the 1940s, and named after Brigadeiro Eduardo Gomes, and its shape is reminiscent of that of some varieties of chocolate truffles.</p>
<p>Eduardo Gomes was a <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_Air_Force" id="w">Brazilian Air Force</a> <a href="/wiki/Brigadier" id="w">brigadier</a> (thus the title &#34;Brigadeiro,&#34; in Portuguese), who first gained notoriety for playing a part in quashing a communist coup in <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" id="w">Rio de Janeiro</a>. Later he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in <a href="/wiki/1946" id="w">1946</a> and <a href="/wiki/1950" id="w">1950</a>, during a brief breeze of <a href="/wiki/Democracy" id="w">democracy</a> that blew in Brazil after the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a>. This was a time of shortage of traditional imports such as nuts and fruits because of the war. But, at the same time, <a href="/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9" id="w">Nestlé</a> was introducing its chocolate powder in the country.</p>
<p>Although Brazil is a major producer of <a href="/wiki/Cocoa_bean" id="w">cocoa beans</a>, it is believed that the creation and success of the candy was a combination of opportunities: the <a href="/wiki/Multinational_corporation" id="w">multinational corporation</a> Nestlé, which introduced chocolate powder; the creators who named it after a famous politician, the need to find a replacement to imported sweets; and its ease of manufacture.</p>
<p>It is made by mixing <a href="/wiki/Condensed_milk" id="w">condensed milk</a>, butter and chocolate powder together. The mixture is then heated in a pan on the stove or in a microwave or <a href="/wiki/Hob" id="w">hob</a> to obtain a smooth, sticky texture. If made on the stove, it is ready when the mixture doesn&#39;t stick to the bottom when the pan is tilted. </p>
<p>There are two ways to serve brigadeiro. The traditional method is to roll the candy into balls which are then covered in chocolate or coffee-flavored sprinkles. The second method is to leave the candy slightly more fluid and to eat it with a <a href="/wiki/Spoon" id="w">spoon</a>. A dash of <a href="/wiki/Rum" id="w">rum</a> or <a href="/wiki/Brandy" id="w">brandy</a> can also be added to the recipe to give it a rich taste similar to a <a href="/wiki/Tartufo" id="w">tartufo</a> <a href="/wiki/Tiramisu" id="w">tiramisu</a>.</p>
<p>Brigadeiro can also be used as a topping or covering for cakes, brownies, and fruits. </p>
