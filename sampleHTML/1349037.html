<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Yusuke_Urameshi" id="w">Yusuke Urameshi</a></b> (浦飯 幽助 <i>Urameshi Yūsuke</i>) - {{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p>Yusuke is the series&#39; main character, the toughest kid in Sarayashiki Junior High School and is a typical juvenile delinquent. At the start of the series, he dies saving a child in a car accident - an act of compassion so out of character for him, that not even <a href="/wiki/Reikai" id="w">Reikai</a> was prepared for his death. Subsequently, he was brought back to life after passing numerous tests, and was made a <a href="/wiki/Reikai" id="w">Reikai</a> spirit detective. His main attack is the Rei Gun (Spirit Gun in the English Dub) where he can manipulate his Reiki (roughly spirit energy) into a projectile.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Kazuma_Kuwabara" id="w">Kazuma Kuwabara</a></b> (桑原 和真 <i>Kuwabara Kazuma</i>) - {{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p>Kuwabara is the second toughest kid in the school, and resents Yusuke for it. Originally rivals, Yusuke and Kuwabara would start a grudging friendship that only strengthens throughout the series. Although human, Kuwabara has high Reiki sensitivity; shortly after accompanying Yusuke on missions, he is able to manifest a Rei Ken (Spirit Sword in the English dubbing); a type of Reiki that normally takes on the shape of a glowing sword. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Keiko_Yukimura" id="w">Keiko Yukimura</a></b> (雪村 螢子 <i>Yukimura Keiko</i>) <b>/ Kayko Yukimura</b> - {{anime voices}}</li></ul>
<p>Although Yusuke vehemently denies it, Keiko is his girlfriend. Her personality is almost the exact opposite of his; she is a model student, and often berates Yusuke for playing hookey or for getting into trouble. Her relationship with Yusuke has sometimes made her a target of demons who had sought to gain the upper hand against the detective. Keiko eventually learns of Yusuke&#39;s life as a <a href="/wiki/Reikai" id="w">Reikai</a> detective, and while apprehensive of some of his more dangerous fights, often supports and cheers him on. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Koenma" id="w">Koenma</a></b> (コエンマ) - {{anime voices}} </li></ul>
<p>Though he resembles an infant in appearance, he is actually over 700 years old and is the son of Enma (King <a href="/wiki/Yama_(Buddhism_and_Chinese_mythology)" id="w">Yama</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Sanskrit" id="w">Sanskrit</a> name, in the English anime), the ruler of the spirit realm (<a href="/wiki/Reikai" id="w">Reikai</a>). Koenma also has the ability to transform into a teenage version of himself (ostensibly for formal occasions) but still retains his trademark pacifier. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Botan_(YuYu_Hakusho)" id="w">Botan</a></b> (ぼたん) - {{anime voices}} </li></ul>
<p>One of the hundreds of ferry girls of the spirit realm (a type of <a href="/wiki/Shinigami" id="w">shinigami</a>) responsible for guiding the souls of the recently departed to eternal judgement (in the American version, she is referred to as the &#34;grim reaper&#34;). Originally assigned by Koenma to be Yusuke&#39;s spirit guide after his fatal car accident, she becomes his case manager, supplying him with equipment and much of the information he needs. Botan is a kind and warm-hearted woman who has put herself in peril on several occasions to protect the people she cares about.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Hiei_(YuYu_Hakusho)" id="w">Hiei</a></b> (飛影) a.k.a. Hiei of the Evil Eye (Hiei Jaganshi) - {{anime voices}} </li></ul>
<p>Hiei is a fire demon (hi <a href="/wiki/Yokai" id="w">yōkai</a>) born of a Kōrime (氷女 Ice Maiden) who specializes in speed, swordsmanship and &#34;Jagan&#34; (Evil Eye) skills (邪眼術). His artificially created Jagan amplifies his power and enables him to summon the black fires of <a href="/wiki/Makai" id="w">Makai</a> (Demon Realm) and channel it as an energy attack, often in the shape of a dragon. His twin sister <a href="/wiki/Yukina" id="w">Yukina</a> is unaware of their relationship, and Hiei has gone as far as to threaten harm to others to prevent Yukina from realizing that he is actually her brother. The choice of vocabulary used in reference to Yukina&#39;s age in the early manga suggests Hiei and Yukina may be adolescents throughout the series. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Kurama_(YuYu_Hakusho)" id="w">Kurama</a></b> (蔵馬), also known as <b>Shuichi Minamino</b> (南野 秀一 <i>Minamino Shūichi</i>) in his human form - {{anime voices}} </li></ul>
<p>Kurama is a demon with the ability to summon and control plants. He was originally the powerful and infamous <a href="/wiki/Kitsune" id="w">Kitsune</a> thief, <a href="/wiki/Yoko_Kurama" id="w">Yoko Kurama</a> (妖狐蔵馬 <i>Yōko Kurama</i>) until he was wounded by a hunter. Managing to escape by inhabiting the body of an unborn human baby, he grew up as the human child Shuichi, and planned on abandoning his &#34;family&#34; once his demonic power returned, but grew to love his human mother, Shiori Minamino. Kurama has a wide variety of techniques, because of his ability to control a wide variety of plants, including the oft-seen Rose Whip. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Genkai_(YuYu_Hakusho)" id="w">Genkai</a></b> (幻海) - {{anime voices}}, <a href="/wiki/Megumi_Hayashibara" id="w">Megumi Hayashibara</a> (young, Japanese)</li></ul>
<p>The aged Reiki fighter who rigorously trains Yusuke in the Spirit Light Wave Fist (霊光波動拳 <a href="/wiki/Reiko_Hado_Ken" id="w">Reikō Hadō Ken</a>, Spirit Wave in the English dub) technique. Though her manner is often gruff, she cares for Yusuke and the others, and constantly tries to help them grow stronger. In the past, she was feared as one of the most powerful human fighters in both Ningenkai and Makai. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Yukina_(YuYu_Hakusho)" id="w">Yukina</a></b> (雪菜) - {{anime voices}} </li></ul>
<p>An ice <a href="/wiki/Y%C5%8Dkai" id="w">yōkai</a> (An &#34;Ice Maiden&#34; 氷女 <i>Kōrime</i>) whose tears can harden into rare, priceless jewels (a characteristic of the Kōrime race). Yusuke, Botan, and Kuwabara rescued her from Gonzo Tarukane, a black market businessman who was torturing her to produce the gems. She reappears later in the series, searching for her brother. She is unaware of the fact that Hiei is her sibling, and that Kuwabara is in love with her. As a Kōrime, she has the ability to cause cold temperatures, as well as use powers of healing.</p>
<a id="Minor_characters_appearing_in_multiple_story_arcs" name="Minor_characters_appearing_in_multiple_story_arcs"></a><h2>Minor characters appearing in multiple story arcs</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Atsuko Urameshi</b> (浦飯 温子 <i>Urameshi Atsuko</i>) {{anime voices}} - Atsuko is Yusuke&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Alcoholic" id="w">alcoholic</a> mother. She tries to raise him into a respectable citizen despite her questionable private life. She wants nothing more than her son to turn out better than her, but she has a hard time with that, and doesn&#39;t really succeed. However, she shows that she really does care about Yusuke when she cries at his funeral. Atsuko has a larger role in the manga, accompanying the girls to the Dark Tournament. In the beginning of the manga, Atsuko is 29 years old.</li>
<li><b>Shiori Minamino</b> (南野 志保利 <i>Minamino Shiori</i>) {{anime voices}} - The human mother of <a href="/wiki/Kurama_(YuYu_Hakusho)" id="w">Shuichi Minamino (Kurama)</a>. She is a very loving mother, as evidenced by Kurama growing attached enough to her emotionally to go to great lengths to ensure her health and safety, such as wishing for her to recover from a serious illness on <i>the Forlorn Hope</i> even though he knew it would take his own life as a price.</li>
<li><b>Shizuru Kuwabara</b> (桑原 静流 <i>Kuwabara Shizuru</i>) {{anime voices}} - Kazuma Kuwabara&#39;s tough older sister. Like her younger brother she also has a high level of Reiki sensitivity and is extremely strong; Shizuru, in the beginning of the manga, has more of a sixth sense than her brother. Shizuru, 17 at the start of the manga, wants Kazuma to grow up and get an education so he can make something of himself. Shizuru, an aspiring beautician, gives Keiko her new haircut after Keiko rescues Yusuke from the burning house in Chapter 13: Qualifications for a Girlfriend. Shizuru is also a chain smoker and the biggest part she plays in the anime series is during the Dark Tournament (Ankoku Būtsukai) where she falls in love with Sakyo, the owner of Team Urameshi&#39;s rival team, Team Toguro.  He saves her life twice, but she is unaware of his true identity until the end. She also knows Yukina&#39;s connection to Hiei because she saw a videotape that provided the details for the mission that Yusuke and Kuwabara had to rescue Yukina from Gonzo Tarukane (only she, Botan, and Yusuke saw the details that Yukina is Hiei&#39;s sister). Like Keiko, she is a woman who is unafraid to speak her mind or deliver a beat-down where needed. She even yells out to Toguro during the Dark Tournament when he goes up to face Yusuke. Shizuru also appears in the Chapter Black and Three Kings saga. During the Three Kings saga, Shizuru who was tired of seeing her brother recklessly endanger his life began to harshly discipline Kazuma to force him to keep up in his school studies and warned him that he would only bring ruin to his life if he kept fighting. In the anime, Shizuru is introduced later (during the Yukina arc rather than right after Keiko&#39;s fiery haircut), but ends up having a larger role, mostly due to the addition of her romance with Sakyo and her taking on Atsuko&#39;s role.</li>
<li><b>Takenaka</b> (竹中) / <b>Takanaka</b> {{anime voices}} - Mr. Takenaka is one of Yusuke&#39;s teachers at Sarayashiki Junior High School. Mr. Takenaka believes that Yusuke is a truly good person, and only scolds him when needed.</li>
<li><b>Kirishima</b> (桐島), <b>Okubo</b> (大久保 <i>Ōkubo</i>), and <b>Sawamura</b> (沢村) (<b>Komada</b> in the English anime) are Kuwabara&#39;s lackeys. Okubo&#39;s mother, often ill, does not bring enough money into her household, so Okubo holds a job in order to support the household.</li>
<li><b>Ayame</b> (あやめ) is Koenma&#39;s investigator. In the manga, Koenma has a crush on her. {{anime voices}}</li>
<li><b>George Saotome</b> (ジョルジュ早乙女 <i>Joruju Saotome</i>) is an oni working with Koenma as his personal assistant whenever Botan is on Earth. Koenma sometimes clashes with him and primarily vents his anger on him if he is anxious over a situation. In the second to last episode of the anime, it is revealed that he is also the narrator of the series, a joke on how they have the same voice actor. {{anime voices}}</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Yomi_(YuYu_Hakusho)" id="w">Yomi</a> (黄泉) - He was Kurama&#39;s second-in-command in the past, when Kurama decided to try to take over <a href="/wiki/Makai" id="w">Makai</a>.  Yomi was young, foolish, and carried away with bloodlust.  He went against Kurama&#39;s orders, losing many of his leader&#39;s best men in ill-planned heists.  One day Yomi heard a rumor about a fortress that contained a fantastic treasure, and he sneaked off to steal it.  However, when he reached the fortress an assassin was waiting for him.  The assassin fought with Yomi, finally blinding him before retreating.  Over the years Yomi grew four new ears to overcome his blindness, and with his other highly trained senses Yomi reached S-class.  He spends hundreds of years searching for the demon who stole his light. When he finally confirms that it was, in fact, Kurama who hired the assassin, he calmly threatens Kurama&#39;s human family in order to force Kurama to become his adviser. Yomi clearly enjoys having Kurama at his side, whether Kurama wills it or not.  It often seems that Yomi became a lord just so that he could prove himself to Kurama.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Mukuro_(YuYu_Hakusho)" id="w">Mukuro</a> (軀) - Mukuro is a Makai ruler. When she was young she was a slave.  Every year, as a &#34;birthday present,&#34; her master would dress her up and treat her like a daughter, only to rape her at the end of the night.  Mukuro realized that she must give up her beauty in order to end the abuse.  She poured acid over her body, burning herself beyond repair, and thus escaped from her &#34;father.&#34;  Her hatred of her old master enabled her to reach S-class and become one of the three rulers of Makai. She covers her face not because she is ashamed of her scars, but because she doesn&#39;t want people to judge her skills as a ruler based on her gender.  Mukuro takes an interest in Hiei and develops romantic feelings for him, but his koorime heritage makes it impossible for him to return her feelings.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Raizen" id="w">Raizen</a> (雷禅) - He is Yusuke&#39;s ancestor.  He is a man-eating demon (食人鬼), a demon that can only survive by eating humans.  Hundreds of years ago, when stalking a human woman to eat, she told him to go ahead and eat her - she was a witch doctor who ate the flesh of corpses who had died of certain diseases, poisoning her stomach and bowels, from which she would cut pieces and feed the sick to cure the same diseases for potent effect (a Kudakusushi 食脱医師), thus if Raizen ate her he would soon be poisoned himself and die.  She also told him that if he did not eat her, he would lose all pride and potency as a man-eating demon, thus taking away all his choices - but he fell in love with her instead, resulting in intimate relations.  As a flesh-eating demon, Raizen had no choice but to eat humans or die, but the woman chose to eat humans on her own, and thus he found himself weak and inconsequential compared to her.  Upon separating, Raizen vowed not to eat human flesh until he met her again, but they had not promised to meet again, and not long after she gave birth and died.  As a result, Raizen continually starved, weakening little by little, until his once immense power fell considerably.  He trains Yusuke, expecting Yusuke to take his place as a Makai ruler. After Raizen dies, Yusuke learns that if Raizen had eaten human flesh all those years, he would have been the most powerful demon in all of the Makai.  Raizen&#39;s followers include Hokushin (北神), who can stretch and soften his body at will, Seizan (西山), Tō&#39;ō (東王), and so on.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Enki" id="w">Enki</a> (煙鬼) - One of Raizen&#39;s old friends and the winner of the Makai Tournament who beat Yomi in the final round. He is one of the many competitors in the Makai Tournament. You don&#39;t see a lot of him, but after the fight of Yusuke and Yomi, Yomi must fight Enki right after he beats Yusuke; before that, Enki defeated Mukuro, after Mukuro had defeated Natsume and Hiei. After winning, he makes a law that no demon is allowed to go into the human world to terrorize it.  Enki&#39;s wife Kokou (狐光) was once in love with Raizen, but married Enki after Raizen refused her.  Some of Raizen&#39;s other old friends include Shuu, Denhou, Saizou, Tetsuzan, Souketsu, Natsume (棗) (who is later a romantic interest for Chu), and her twin brother Kujou (九条).</li></ul>
<a id="Others" name="Others"></a><h2>Others</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Hinageshi</b> - Hinageshi is a Reikai ferrygirl and an expert on the Meikai. She is a friend of Botan and lives at a Kasane Shrine, where she works as a shrine maiden.  Hinageshi was able to assist the Tantei during the battle against Yakumo. Her name means &#34;red poppy&#34; in Japanese.  (Hinageshi only appears in the feature film, <a href="/wiki/Yu_Yu_Hakusho:_Poltergeist_Report" id="w">Yû yû hakusho: Meikai shitô hen - Honô no kizuna</a>).</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Koto</b> - She is the referee for the Dark Tournament and the Makai Unification Tournament.  While Koto enjoys blood and violence as much as the next demon, she is very fair when it comes to rules.  In the manga, she later appears with Juri and Ruka in magazines and on television.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Kuronue</b> was Kurama&#39;s best friend and partner when Kurama was a thief.  He and Kurama sneaked into a palace in Makai in order to steal a mirror, but Kuronue&#39;s precious pendant broke.  He hurried back to retrieve it, only to be skewered by bamboo.  The memory of Kuronue&#39;s death haunts Kurama even years later, partly because he ran away when Kuronue was fatally wounded and partly because (as a plant wielder) Kurama should have been able to prevent the bamboo from harming him in the first place.  Little is known about Kuronue as a person, but he follows a strict code of honor, uses various blades as weapons, and has a strange attachment to his pendant.  In the end it is Hiei, who is so startlingly similar to Kuronue, who gives Kurama the help he needs to accept Kuronue&#39;s death.</li></ul>
