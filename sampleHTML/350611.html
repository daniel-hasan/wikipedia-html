{{History of Cambodia}}
The <b>Cambodian Civil War</b> was a conflict that pitted the forces of the Communist Party of Kampuchea (known as the <a href="/wiki/Khmer_Rouge" id="w">Khmer Rouge</a>) and their allies the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Vietnam" id="w">Democratic Republic of Vietnam</a> (North Vietnam) and the <a href="/wiki/National_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_South_Vietnam" id="w">National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam</a> (NLF) against the government forces of <a href="/wiki/Cambodia" id="w">Cambodia</a> (after October 1970, the <a href="/wiki/Khmer_Republic" id="w">Khmer Republic</a>), which were supported by the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> (U.S.) and the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Vietnam" id="w">Republic of Vietnam</a> (South Vietnam). </p>
<p>The struggle was exacerbated by the influence and actions of the allies of the two warring sides. North Vietnamese involvement was designed to protect its Base Areas and sanctuaries in eastern Cambodia, without which the prosecution of its military effort in South Vietnam would have been more difficult. The U.S. was motivated by the need to buy time for its withdrawal from <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" id="w">Southeast Asia</a> and to protect its ally, South Vietnam. American, South and North Vietnamese forces directly participated (at one time or another) in the fighting. The central government was mainly assisted by the application of massive U.S. aerial bombing campaigns and direct material and financial aid.</p>
<p>The Republican government, after five years of savage fighting (and after suffering massive casualties, the destruction of its economy, the starvation of its population, and grevious atrocities committed by its enemy), was defeated on <a href="/wiki/17_April" id="w">17 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a> when the victorious Khmer Rouge proclaimed the establishment of <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Kampuchea" id="w">Democratic Kampuchea</a>. This conflict, although an indigenous civil war, was considered to be part of the larger <a href="/wiki/Second_Indochina_War" id="w">Second Indochina War</a> (1960-1975) that also consumed the neighboring <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Laos" id="w">Kingdom of Laos</a>, South Vietnam, and North Vietnam.</p>

During the early to mid-1960s, Prince <a href="/wiki/Norodom_Sihanouk" id="w">Norodom Sihanouk</a>&#39;s leftist policies had protected his nation from the turmoil that engulfed Laos and South Vietnam.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Neither the <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_China" id="w">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> (PRC) nor North Vietnam  disputed Sihanouk&#39;s claim to represent &#34;progressive&#34; political policies and the leadership of the prince&#39;s domestic leftist opposition, the Prachea Chon Party, had been integrated into the government.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/3_May" id="w">3 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1965" id="w">1965</a>, Sihanouk broke diplomatic relations with the U.S., ended the flow of American aid, and turned to the PRC and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> for economic and military assistance.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>By the late 1960s, Sihanouk&#39;s delicate domestic and foreign policy balancing act was beginning to go awry. In 1966, an agreement was struck between the prince and the Chinese, allowing the presence of large-scale <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Army_of_Vietnam" id="w">People&#39;s Army of Vietnam</a> (PAVN) and NLF troop deployments and logistical bases in the eastern border regions.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> He had also agreed to allow the use of the port of <a href="/wiki/Sihanoukville" id="w">Sihanoukville</a> by communist-flagged vessels delivering supplies and materiel to support the PAVN/NLF military effort in Vietnam.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> These concessions made a sham of Cambodia&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Neutrality" id="w">neutrality</a>, which had been guaranteed by the <a href="/wiki/Geneva_Conference_(1954)" id="w">Geneva Conference</a> of 1954.

Sihanouk was convinced that the PRC, not the U.S., would eventually control the Indochinese Peninsula and that &#34;our interests are best served by dealing with the camp that one day will dominate the whole of Asia - and coming to terms before its victory - in order to obtain the best terms possible.&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>During the same year, however, he allowed his pro-American minister of defense, General <a href="/wiki/Lon_Nol" id="w">Lon Nol</a>, to crack down on leftist activities, crushing the Prachea Chon by accusing its members of subversion and subservience to <a href="/wiki/Hanoi" id="w">Hanoi</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Simultaneously, Sihanouk lost the support of Cambodia&#39;s conservatives as a result of his failure to come to grips with the deteriorating economic situation (exacerbated by the loss of rice exports, most of which went to the PAVN/NLF) and with the growing communist military presence.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/11_September" id="w">11 September</a>, Cambodia held its first open election. Through manipulation and harassment (and to Sihanouk&#39;s surprise) the conservatives won 75 percent of the seats in the National Assembly.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Lon Nol was chosen by the right as prime minister and, as his deputy, they named <a href="/wiki/Sirik_Matak" id="w">Sirik Matak</a>, an ultraconservative member of the Sisowath branch of the royal clan and long-time enemy of Sihanouk. In addition to these developments and the clash of interests among <a href="/wiki/Phnom_Penh" id="w">Phnom Penh</a>&#39;s politicized elite, social tensions created a favorable environment for the growth of a domestic communist <a href="/wiki/Insurgency" id="w">insurgency</a> in the rural areas.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Revolt_in_Battambang" name="Revolt_in_Battambang"></a><h2>Revolt in Battambang</h2>
<p>{{details}}
The prince then found himself in a political dilemma. To maintain the balance against the rising tide of the conservatives, he named the leaders of the very group he had been oppressing as members of a &#34;counter-government&#34; that was meant to monitor and criticize Lon Nol&#39;s administration.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> One of Lon Nol&#39;s first priorities was to fix the ailing economy by halting the illegal sale of rice to the communists. Soldiers were dispatched to the rice-growing areas to forcibly collect the harvests at gunpoint, and they paid only the low government price. There was wide-spread unrest, especially in rice-rich <a href="/wiki/Battambang_Province" id="w">Battambang Province</a>, an area long-noted for the presence of large landowners, great disparity in wealth, and where the communists still had some influence.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>

On <a href="/wiki/11_March" id="w">11 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a>, while Sihanouk was out of the country in <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, a rebellion broke out in the area around Samlaut in Battambang, when enraged villagers attacked a tax collection brigade. With the probable encouragement of local communist cadres, the insurrection quickly spread throughout the whole region.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Lon Nol, acting in the prince&#39;s absence (but with his approval), responded by declaring <a href="/wiki/Martial_law" id="w">martial law</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Hundreds of peasants were killed and whole villages were laid waste during the repression.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> After returning home in March, Sihanouk abandoned his centrist position and personally ordered the arrest of <a href="/wiki/Khieu_Samphan" id="w">Khieu Samphan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hou_Yuon" id="w">Hou Yuon</a>, and Hu Nim, the leaders of the &#34;countergovernment&#34;, all of whom escaped into the northeast.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Simultaneously, Sihanouk ordered the arrest of Chinese middlemen involved in the illegal rice trade, thereby raising government revenues and placating the conservatives. Lon Nol was forced to resign, and, in a typical move, the prince named new leftists to the government to balance the conservatives.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The crisis immediate had passed, but it engendered two tragic consequences. First, it drove thousands of new recruits into the arms of the hard-line <i>maquis</i> of the Cambodian Communist Party (which Sihanouk labelled the <a href="/wiki/Khmer_Rouge" id="w">Khmer Rouge</a> or &#34;Red Khmers&#34;). Second, for the peasantry, the name of Lon Nol became associated with ruthless repression throughout Cambodia.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

While the 1967 insurgency had been unplanned, the Khmer Rouge tried, without much success, to organize a more serious revolt during the following year. The prince&#39;s decimation of the Prachea Chon and the urban communists had, however, cleared the field of competition for Saloth Sar (also known as <a href="/wiki/Pol_Pot" id="w">Pol Pot</a>), Ieng Sary, and Son Sen, the <a href="/wiki/Maoism" id="w">Maoist</a> leadership of the <i>maquisards</i>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> They led their followers into the highlands of the northeast and into the lands of the <a href="/wiki/Khmer_Loeu" id="w">Khmer Loeu</a>, a primitive people who were hostile to both the lowland Khmers and the central government. For the Khmer Rouge, who still lacked assistance from the North Vietnamese, it was a period of regroupment, organization, and training. Hanoi basically ignored its Chinese-sponsored allies, and the indifference of their &#34;fraternal comrades&#34; to their insurgency between 1967 and 1969 would make an indelible impression on the Khmer Rouge leadership.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/17_January" id="w">17 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1968" id="w">1968</a>, the Khmer Rouge launched their first offensive. It was aimed more at gathering weapons and spreading propaganda than in seizing territory since, at that time, the adherents of the insurgency numbered no more than 4-5,000.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> During the same month, the communists established the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea as the military wing of the party. </p>
<p>As early as the end of the Battambang revolt, Sihanouk had begun to reevaluate his relationship with the communists.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> His earlier agreement with the Chinese had availed him nothing. They had not only failed to restrain the North Vietnamese, but they had actually involved themselves (through the Khmer Rouge) in active subversion within his country.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Besides, PAVN and the NLF would make very convenient scapegoats for Cambodia&#39;s ills, much more so than the minuscule Khmer Rouge, and ridding Cambodia of their presence would solve many problems simultaneously.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the suggestion of Lon Nol (who had returned to the cabinet as defense minister in November, 1968) and other conservative politicians, on <a href="/wiki/11_May" id="w">11 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a>, the prince welcomed the restoration of normal diplomatic relations with the U.S. and created a new Government of National Salvation with Lon Nol as his prime minister.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> He did so &#34;in order to play a new card, since the Asian communists are already attacking us before the end of the Vietnam War.&#34;<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> The Americans took advantage of this same opportunity to solve some of their own problems in <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" id="w">Southeast Asia</a>.</p>

Although the U.S. had been aware of the PAVN/NLF sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President <a href="/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson" id="w">Lyndon B.

On <a href="/wiki/18_March" id="w">18 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a>, on secret orders from Nixon, the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Air_Force" id="w">U.S. Air Force</a> carried out the bombing of Base Area 353 (in the Fishhook region opposite South Vietnam&#39;s Tay Ninh Province) by 59 <a href="/wiki/B-52_Stratofortress" id="w">B-52 Stratofortress</a> bombers. This strike was the first in a series of attacks on the sanctuaries that lasted until May 1970. During <a href="/wiki/Operation_Menu" id="w">Operation Menu</a>, the Air Force conducted 3,875 sorties and dropped more than 108,000 tons of ordnance on the eastern border areas.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> During this operation, Sihanouk remained quiet about the whole affair, possibly hoping that the U.S. would be able to drive PAVN and NLF troops from his country. Hanoi too, remained quiet, not wishing to advertise the presence of its forces in &#34;neutral&#34; Cambodia. The <i>Menu</i> bombings remained secret from the U.S. Congress and people until 1973.</p>

While Sihanouk was out of the country on a trip to France, anti-Vietnamese rioting (which was semi-sponsored by the government) took place in Phnom Penh, during which the North Vietnamese  and NLF embassies were sacked.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> In the prince&#39;s absence, Lon Nol did nothing to halt these activities.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> On the 12th, the prime minister closed the port of Sihanoukville to the North Vietnamese and issued an impossible ultimatum to them. All PAVN/NLF forces were to withdraw from Cambodian soil within 72 hours (on <a href="/wiki/15_March" id="w">15 March</a>) or face military action.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Sihanouk, hearing of the turmoil, headed for <a href="/wiki/Moscow" id="w">Moscow</a> and <a href="/wiki/Beijing" id="w">Beijing</a> in order to demand that the patrons of PAVN and the NLF exert more control over their clients.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/18_March" id="w">18 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>, Lon Nol requested that the National Assembly vote on the future of the prince&#39;s leadership of the nation. Sihanouk was ousted from power by a vote of 92-0.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Heng Cheng became president of the National Assembly, while Prime Minister Lon Nol was granted emergency powers. Sirik Matak retained his post as deputy prime minister. The new government emphasized that the transfer of power had been totally legal and constitutional, and it received the recognition of most foreign governments. There have been, and continue to be, accusations that the U.S. government played some role in the overthrow of Sihanouk, but conclusive evidence has never been found to support them.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The majority of middle-class and educated Khmers had grown weary of the prince and welcomed the change of government.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> They were joined by the military, for whom the prospect of the return of American military and financial aid was a cause for celebration.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> Within days of his deposition, Sihanouk, now in Beijing, broadcast an appeal to the people to resist the usurpers.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> Demonstrations and riots occurred (mainly in areas contiguous to PAVN/NLF controlled areas), but no nationwide groundswell threatened the government.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> In one incident at Kompong Cham on <a href="/wiki/29_March" id="w">29 March</a>, however, an enraged crowd killed Lon Nol&#39;s brother, <a href="/wiki/Lon_Nil" id="w">Lon Nil</a>, tore out his liver, and cooked and ate it.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> An estimated 40,000 peasants then began to march on the capital to demand Sihanouk&#39;s reinstatement.

<p>Most of the population, urban and rural, took out their anger and frustrations on the nation&#39;s indigenous Vietnamese population. Lon Nol&#39;s call for 10,000 volunteers to boost the manpower of Cambodia&#39;s poorly-equipped, 30,000-man army, managed to swamp the military with over 70,000 recruits.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Rumours abounded concerning a possible PAVN offensive aimed at Phnom Penh itself. Paranoia flourished and this set off a violent reaction against the nation&#39;s 400,000 ethnic Vietnamese.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Lon Nol hoped to use the Vietnamese as hostages against PAVN/NLF activities, and the military set about rounding them up into detention camps.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> That was when the killing began. In towns and villages all over Cambodia, soldiers and civilians sought out their Vietnamese neighbors in order to murder them.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/15_April" id="w">15 April</a>, the bodies of 800 Vietnamese floated down the <a href="/wiki/Mekong_River" id="w">Mekong River</a> and into South Vietnam.</p>
<p>The South Vietnamese, North Vietnamese, and the NLF harshly denounced these horrendous  actions.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> Significantly, no Cambodians - not even those of the Buddhist community - condemned the killings. In his apology to the <a href="/wiki/Saigon" id="w">Saigon</a> government, Lon Nol stated that </p><blockquote>&#34;it was difficult to distinguish between Vietnamese citizens who were Viet Cong and those who were not. So it is quite normal that the reaction of Cambodian troops, who feel themselves betrayed, is difficult to control.&#34;<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></blockquote>

<a id="FUNK_and_GRUNK" name="FUNK_and_GRUNK"></a><h2>FUNK and GRUNK</h2>
<p>From Beijing, Sihanouk proclaimed that the government in Phnom Penh was dissolved and his intention to create the <i>Front Uni National du Kampuchea</i> or FUNK (National United Front of Kampuchea). Sihanouk later said &#34;I had chosen not to be with either the Americans or the communists, because I considered that there were two dangers, American imperialism and Asian communism. It was Lon Nol who obliged me to choose between them.&#34;<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>The prince then allied himself with the Khmer Rouge, the North Vietnamese, the Laotian <a href="/wiki/Pathet_Lao" id="w">Pathet Lao</a>, and the NLF, throwing his personal prestige behind the communists.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/5_May" id="w">5 May</a>, the actual establishment of FUNK and of the <i>Government Royal d&#39;Union Nationale du Kampuchea</i> or GRUNK (Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea), was proclaimed. Sihanouk assumed the post of head of state, appointing Penn Nouth, one of his most loyal supporters, as prime minister. </p>
<p>Khieu Samphan was designated deputy prime minister, minister of defense, and commander in chief of the GRUNK armed forces (though actual military operations were directed by Pol Pot). Hu Nim became minister of information, and Hou Yuon assumed multiple responsibilities as minister of the interior, communal reforms, and cooperatives. GRUNK claimed that it was not a government-in-exile since Khieu Samphan and the insurgents remained inside Cambodia. Sihanouk and his loyalists remained in China, although the prince did make a visit to the &#34;liberated areas&#34; of Cambodia, including <a href="/wiki/Angkor_Wat" id="w">Angkor Wat</a>, in March 1973. These visits were used mainly for propaganda purposes and had no real influence on political affairs.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> </p>
<p>For Sihanouk, this proved to be a short-sighted marriage of convenience that was spurred on by his thirst for revenge against those who had betrayed him.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> For the Khmer Rouge, it was a means to greatly expand the appeal of their movement. Peasants, motivated by loyalty to the monarchy, gradually rallied to the FUNK cause.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> The personal appeal of Sihanouk, the overall better behavior of the communist troops, and widespread allied aerial bombardment facilitated recruitment. This task was made even easier for the communists after <a href="/wiki/9_October" id="w">9 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>, when Lon Nol abolished the loosely federalist monarchy and proclaimed the establishment of a centralized <a href="/wiki/Khmer_Republic" id="w">Khmer Republic</a>.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the wake of the coup, Lon Nol did not immediately launch Cambodia into war. He appealed to the international community and to the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a> in an attempt to gain support for the new government and condemned violations of Cambodia&#39;s neutrality &#34;by foreign forces, whatever camp they come from.&#34;<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> His hope for continued neutralism availed him no more than it had Sihanouk.</p>
<p>As combat operations quickly revealed, the two sides were badly mismatched. Government troops, were now renamed the <i>Forces Armees Nationales Khemeres</i> or FANK (Khmer National Armed Forces) and thousands of young urban Cambodians flocked to join it in the months following the removal of Sihanouk. With the surge of recruits, however, FANK expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK&#39;s existence until its collapse.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup>

During the period 1974-1975, FANK forces officially grew from 100,000 to approximately 250,000 men, but probably only numbered around 180,000 due to payroll padding by their officers and due to desertions.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> U.S. military aid (ammunition, supplies, and equipment) was  funneled to FANK through the Military Equipment Delivery Team, Cambodia (MEDTC). Authorized a total of 113 officers and men, the team arrived in Phnom Penh in 1971.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> The attitude of the Nixon administration could be summed up by the advice given by Henry Kissinger to the first head of the liaison team, Colonel Jonathan Ladd: &#34;Don&#39;t think of victory; just keep it alive.&#34;<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>There were other problems. The officer corps of FANK was generally corrupt and greedy.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> The inclusion of &#34;ghost&#34; soldiers allowed massive payroll padding; ration allowances were kept by the officers while their men starved; and the sale of arms and ammunition on the black market (or to the enemy) was commonplace.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> Worse, the tactical ineptitude among FANK officers was as common as their greed.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> Lon Nol frequently bypassed the general staff and directed operations down to battalion-level while also forbidding any real coordination between the army, navy, and air force.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The common soldiers fought bravely at first, but they were saddled with low pay (with which they had to purchase their own food and medical care), ammunition shortages, and mixed equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, forced to follow their husbands/sons into the battle zones. These problems (exacerbated by continuously declining morale) only increased over time.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the beginning of 1974, the Cambodian army inventory included 241,630 rifles, 7,079 machine guns, 2,726 mortars, 20,481 grenade launchers, 304 recoilless rifles, 289 howitzers, 202 APCs, and 4,316 trucks. The Khmer navy had 171 vessels; the Khmer air force had 211 aircraft, including 64 North American T-28s, 14 Douglas AC-47 gunships and 44 helicopters. American embassy military personnel -- who were only supposed to coordinate the arms aid program -- sometimes found themselves involved in prohibited advisory and combat tasks. </p>





<p>Initially arrayed against an armed force of such limited capability was arguably the best light infantry army in the world at the time - the People&#39;s Army of Vietnam.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> When their forces were supplanted, it was by the tough, rigidly indoctrinated peasant army of the Khmer Rouge with its core of seasoned leaders, who now received the full support of Hanoi. Khmer Rouge forces, which had been reorganized at an Indochinese summit held in Conghua, China in April 1970, would grow from 12-15,000 in 1970 to 35-40,000 by 1972, when the so-called &#34;Khmerization&#34; of the conflict took place and combat operations against the Republic were handed over completely to the insurgents.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>The development of these forces took place in three stages. 1970 to 1972 was a period of organization and recruitment, during which Khmer Rouge units served as auxiliaries to PAVN. From 1972 to mid-1974, the insurgents formed units of battalion and regimental size. It was during this period that the Khmer Rouge began to break away from Sihanouk and his supporters and the collectivization of agriculture was begun in the liberated areas. Division-sized units were being fielded by 1974-1975, when the party was on its own and began the radical transformation of the country.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> </p>
<p>With the fall of Sihanouk, Hanoi became alarmed at the prospect of a pro-Western regime that might allow the Americans to establish a military presence on their western flank. To prevent that from happening, they began transferring their military installations away from the border regions to locations deeper within Cambodian territory. A new command center was established at the city of <a href="/wiki/Krati%C3%A9" id="w">Kratié</a> and the timing of the move was propitious. President Nixon was of the opinion that: </p><blockquote>&#34;We need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol...something symbolic...for the only Cambodian regime that had the guts to take a pro-Western and pro-American stand.&#34;<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup></blockquote>

On <a href="/wiki/29_April" id="w">29 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>, South Vietnamese and U.S. units (also alarmed by the prospect of Cambodia being overrun by the communists) unleashed a limited, multi-pronged <a href="/wiki/Cambodian_Campaign" id="w">Cambodian Campaign</a> that Washington hoped would solve three other problems: First, it would provide a shield for the American withdrawal (by destroying the PAVN logistical system and killing enemy troops); second, it would provide a test for the policy of Vietnamization; third, it would serve as a signal to Hanoi that Nixon meant business.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> Despite Nixon&#39;s appreciation of Lon Nol&#39;s position, the Cambodian leader was not even informed in advance of the decision to invade his country. He learned about it only after it had begun from the head of the U.S. mission, who had himself learned about it from a radio broadcast.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>
<p>Extensive logistical installations and large amounts of supplies were found and destroyed, but as reporting from the American command in Saigon disclosed, still larger amounts of material had already been moved deeper into the countryside.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> According to Republican General Sak Sutsakhan, the withdrawal of U.S. forces, after only a 30-day campaign, created &#34;a void so great on the allied side that neither the Cambodian nor the South Vietnamese armies were ever able to fill it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the day the incursion was launched, the North Vietnamese reacted by launching an offensive (Campaign <i>X</i>) of its own against FANK forces in order to protect and expand their Base Areas and logistical system.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> By June, three months after the removal of Sihanouk, they had swept government forces from the entire northeastern third of the country.

The Khmer Rouge also established liberated areas in the south and the southwestern parts of the country, where they operated independently of the North Vietnamese.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>

During the night of <a href="/wiki/21_January" id="w">21 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1971" id="w">1971</a>, a force of 100 PAVN/NLF commandos attacked Pochentong airfield, the main base of the Republican Air Force. In this one action, the raiders destroyed almost the entire inventory of government aircraft, including all of its fighter planes. This may have been a blessing in disguise, however, since the air force was composed of old (even obsolete) Soviet aircraft. The Americans soon replaced the airplanes with more advanced models. The attack did, however, stall a proposed FANK offensive. Two weeks later, Lon Nol suffered a <a href="/wiki/Stroke" id="w">stroke</a> and was evacuated to <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaii</a> for treatment. It had been a mild stroke, however, and the general recovered quickly, returning to Cambodia after only two months.</p>
<p>It was not until <a href="/wiki/20_August" id="w">20 August</a> that FANK launched Operation <i>Chenla II</i>, its first offensive of the year. The objective of the campaign was to clear Route 6 of enemy forces and thereby reopen communications with <a href="/wiki/Kompong_Thom" id="w">Kompong Thom</a>, the Republic&#39;s second largest city, which had been isolated from the capital for more than a year. The operation was initially successful, and the city was relieved. The PAVN and Khmer Rouge counterattacked in November and December, annihilating government forces in the process. There was never an accurate count of the losses, but the estimate was &#34;on the order of ten battalions of personnel and equipment lost plus the equipment of an additional ten battalions.&#34;<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> The strategic result of the failure of <i>Chenla II</i> was that the offensive initiative passed completely into the hands of PAVN and the Khmer Rouge.</p>

<p>{{details}}
From 1972 through 1974, the war was conducted along FANK&#39;s lines of communications north and south of the capital. Limited offensives were launched to maintain contact with the rice-growing regions of the northwest and along the <a href="/wiki/Mekong_River" id="w">Mekong River</a> and Route 5, the Republic&#39;s overland connections to South Vietnam. The strategy of the Khmer Rouge was to gradually cut those lines of communication and squeeze Phnom Penh. As a result, FANK forces became fragmented, isolated, and unable to lend one another mutual support. </p>
<p>The main U.S. contribution to the FANK effort came in the form of the bombers and tactical aircraft of the U.S. Air Force. When President Nixon launched the incursion in 1970, American and South Vietnamese troops operated under an umbrella of air cover that was designated Operation <i>Freedom Deal</i>. When those troops were withdrawn, the air operation continued, ostensibly to interdict PAVN/NLF troop movements and logistics.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> In reality (and unknown to the American Congress and public), they were utilized to provide tactical air support to FANK.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> As a former U.S. military officer in Phnom Penh reported, &#34;the areas around the Mekong River were so full of bomb craters from B-52 strikes that, by 1973, they looked like the valleys of the moon.&#34;<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup>

On <a href="/wiki/10_March" id="w">10 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1972" id="w">1972</a>, just before the newly-renamed <a href="/wiki/Constituent_Assembly" id="w">Constituent Assembly</a> was to approve a revised constitution, Lon Nol announced that he was suspending the deliberations. He then forced Cheng Heng, the chief of state since Sihanouk&#39;s deposition, to surrender his authority to him. On the second anniversary of the coup, Lon Nol relinquished his authority as chief of state, but retained his position as prime minister and defense minister. </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/4_June" id="w">4 June</a>, Lon Nol was elected as the first president of the Khmer Republic in a blatantly rigged election.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> As per the new constitution (ratified on <a href="/wiki/30_April" id="w">30 April</a>), political parties formed in the new nation, quickly becoming a source of political factionalism that the Republic would have been better off without. As General Sutsakhan stated: &#34;the seeds of democratization, which had been thrown into the wind with such goodwill by the Khmer leaders, returned for the Khmer Republic nothing but a poor harvest.&#34;<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup></p>
<p>In January 1973, hope sprang into the breasts of the Republic&#39;s government, army, and population when the <a href="/wiki/Paris_Peace_Accord" id="w">Paris Peace Accord</a> was signed, ending the conflict (for the time being) in South Vietnam and Laos. On <a href="/wiki/29_January" id="w">29 January</a>, Lon Nol proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire throughout the nation. All U.S. bombing operations were halted in hopes of securing a chance for peace. It was not to be. The Khmer Rouge simply ignored the proclamation and carried on fighting. By March, heavy casualties, desertions, and low recruitment had forced Lon Nol to introduce conscription and, in April, insurgent forces launched an offensive that pushed into the suburbs of the capital. The U.S. Air Force responded by launching an intense bombing operation that forced the communists back into the countryside after being decimated by the air strikes.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the last day of Operation <i>Freedom Deal</i> (<a href="/wiki/15_August" id="w">15 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1973" id="w">1973</a>), 250,000 tons of bombs had been dropped on the Khmer Republic, 82,000 tons of which had been released in the last 45 days of the operation.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> Since the inception of Operation <i>Menu</i> in 1969, the U.S. Air Force had dropped 539,129 tons of ordnance on Cambodia/Khmer Republic.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Shape_of_things_to_come" name="Shape_of_things_to_come"></a><h2>Shape of things to come</h2>
<p>As late as 1972-1973, it was a commonly held belief, both within and outside Cambodia, that the war was essentially a foreign conflict that had not fundamentally altered the nature of the Khmer people.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> By late 1973, there was a growing awareness among the government and population of the fanaticism, total lack of concern over casualties, and complete rejection of any offer of peace talks which &#34;began to suggest that Khmer Rouge fanaticism and capacity for violence were deeper than anyone had suspected.&#34;<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p>Reports of the brutal policies of the organization soon made their way to Phnom Penh and into the population foretelling a violent madness that was about to consume the nation. There were tales of the forced relocations of entire villages, of the summary execution of any who disobeyed or even asked questions, the forbidding of religious practices, of monks who were defrocked or murdered, and where traditional sexual and marital habits were foresworn.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> War was one thing, the offhand manner in which the Khmer Rouge dealt out death, so contrary to the Khmer character, was quite another.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> Reports of these atrocities began to surface during the same period in which North Vietnamese troops were withdrawing from the Cambodian battlefields. This was no coincidence. The concentration of the PAVN effort on South Vietnam allowed the Khmer Rouge to apply their doctrine and policies without restraint for the first time.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge leadership was almost completely unknown by the public. They were referred to by their fellow countrymen as <i>peap prey</i> - the forest army. Previously, the very existence of the communist party as a component of GRUNK had been hidden.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup> Within the &#34;liberated zones&#34; it was simply referred to as &#34;Angka&#34; - the organization. During 1973, the communist party fell under the control of its most fanatical members, Pol Pot and Son Sen, who believed that &#34;Cambodia was to go through a total social revolution and that everything that had preceded it was anathema and must be destroyed.&#34;<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also hidden from scrutiny was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup> The radical leadership of the party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup> The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam&#39;s chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate.<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup> After the signing of the Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire.<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup> When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup> During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup></p>
<p>As time passed, the need of the Khmer Rouge for the sinecure of Prince Sihanouk lessened. The organization demonstrated to the people of the liberated areas in no uncertain terms that open expressions of support for Sihanouk would result in their liquidation.<sup id="_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[96]</a></sup> Although the prince still enjoyed the protection of the Chinese, when he made public appearances overseas to publicize the GRUNK cause, he was treated with almost open contempt by Ministers <a href="/wiki/Ieng_Sary" id="w">Ieng Sary</a> and Khieu Samphan.<sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[97]</a></sup> In June, the prince told Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci that when &#34;they [the Khmer Rouge] have sucked me dry, they will spit me out like a cherry stone.&#34;<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup> </p>
<p>By the end of 1973, Sihanouk loyalists had been purged from all of GRUNK&#39;s ministries and all of the prince&#39;s supporters within the insurgent ranks were also eliminated.<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup> Shortly after Christmas, as the insurgents were gearing up for their final offensive, Sihanouk spoke with the French diplomat Etienne Manac&#39;h.

By the time the Khmer Rouge initiated their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on <a href="/wiki/1_January" id="w">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a>, the Republic was in chaos. The economy had been gutted, the transportation network had been reduced to air and water systems, the rice harvest had been reduced by one-quarter, and the supply of freshwater fish (the chief source of protein) had declined drastically. The cost of food was 20 times greater than pre-war levels and unemployment was not even measured anymore.<sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup>

<div class="thumbcaption">The final offensive against Phnom Penh, April 1975</div></div>

Phnom Penh, which had a pre-war population of around 600,000, was overwhelmed by refugees (who continued to flood in from the steadily collapsing defense perimeter), growing to a size of around two million. These helpless and desperate civilians had no jobs and little in the way of food, shelter, or medical care. Their condition (and the government&#39;s) only worsened when Khmer Rouge forces gradually gained control of the banks of the Mekong. From the riverbanks, their mines and gunfire steadily reduced the river convoys bringing relief supplies of food, fuel, and ammunition to the slowly starving city (90 percent of the Republic&#39;s supplies moved by means of the convoys) from South Vietnam. After the river was effectively blocked in early February, the U.S. began an airlift of supplies. This became increasingly risky, however, due to communist rocket and artillery fire, which constantly rained down on the airfields and city.</p>
<p>Desperate, yet determined, units of Republican soldiers, many of whom had run out of ammunition, dug in around the capital and fought until they were overrun as the Khmer Rouge advanced. By the last week of March 1975, approximately 40,000 communist troops had surrounded the capital and began preparing to deliver the <i>coup de grace</i> to about half as many Republican forces.<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lon Nol resigned and left the country on <a href="/wiki/1_April" id="w">1 April</a>, hoping that a negotiated settlement might still be possible if he was absent from the political scene.<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[103]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Saukam_Khoy" id="w">Saukam Khoy</a> became acting president of a government that had less than three weeks to live. Last-minute efforts on the part of the U.S. to arrange a peace agreement involving Sihanouk ended in failure. When a vote in the U.S. Congress for a resumption of American air support failed, panic and a sense of doom pervaded the capital. The situation was best described by General Sak Sutsakhan (now FANK chief of staff):
</p><blockquote>&#34;The picture of the Khmer Republic which came to mind at that time was one of a sick man who survived only by outside means and that, in its condition, the administration of medication, however efficient it might be, was probably of no further value.&#34;<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/12_April" id="w">12 April</a>, concluding that all was lost (and without notifying the Khmer government), the U.S. evacuated its embassy personnel by helicopter during Operation <i>Eagle Pull</i>. The 276 evacuees included U.S. Ambassador <a href="/wiki/John_Gunther_Dean" id="w">John Gunther Dean</a>, other American diplomatic personnel, the acting president of Cambodia, senior Khmer Republic government officials and their families, and members of the news media. In all, 82 U.S., 159 Cambodian, and 35 third-country nationals were evacuated.<sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup> Although invited by Ambassador Dean to join the evacuation (and much to the American&#39;s surprise), Sirik Matak, Long Boret, <a href="/wiki/Lon_Non" id="w">Lon Non</a> (Lon Nol&#39;s brother), and most members of Lon Nol&#39;s cabinet declined the offer.<sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[106]</a></sup> All of them chose to share the fate of their people and were later executed by the Khmer Rouge. </p>
<p>After the Americans (and the president) had departed, a seven-member Supreme Committee, headed by General Sak Sutsakhan, assumed authority over the collapsing Republic. By <a href="/wiki/15_April" id="w">15 April</a>, the last solid defenses of the city were overcome by the communists. In the early morning hours of <a href="/wiki/17_April" id="w">17 April</a>, the committee decided to move the seat of government to Oddar Meanchay Province in the northwest. Around 10:00, the voice of General Mey Si Chan of the FANK general staff broadcast on the radio, ordering all FANK forces to cease firing, since &#34;negotiations were in progress&#34; for the surrender of Phnom Penh.<sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[107]</a></sup> The war was over but the terrible dreams of the Khmer Rouge were about to come to fruition in the newly-proclaimed <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Kampuchea" id="w">Democratic Kampuchea</a>. Khmer Rouge troops immediately began to forcibly empty the capital city, driving the population into the countryside and killing thousands in the process. The Year Zero had begun.</p>
