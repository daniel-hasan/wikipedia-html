<b>Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia</b> (<i>Maria Nikolayevna Romanova</i>; <a href="/wiki/Russian_language" id="w">Russian</a>: Великая Княжна Мария Николаевна, {{OldStyleDate}} – <a href="/wiki/July_17" id="w">July 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a>) was the third daughter of <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia" id="w">Nicholas II of Russia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alexandra_of_Hesse" id="w">Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna</a>. Her murder following the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917" id="w">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> resulted in her <a href="/wiki/Canonization" id="w">canonization</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Passion_bearer" id="w">passion bearer</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church" id="w">Russian Orthodox Church</a>.</p>
<p>During her lifetime, Maria, too young to become a <a href="/wiki/Red_Cross" id="w">Red Cross</a> <a href="/wiki/Nurse" id="w">nurse</a> like her elder sisters during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, was patroness of a hospital and instead visited wounded soldiers. Throughout her lifetime she was noted for interest in the lives of the soldiers. The flirtatious Maria had a number of innocent crushes on the young men she met, beginning in early childhood. She hoped to marry and have a large family.</p>
<p>She was an elder sister of the famous <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_Nikolaevna_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia</a>, whose escape from the assassination of the imperial family has been rumored for nearly 90 years.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> In recent years, Maria&#39;s own survival has been rumored. Scientists dispute whether Maria or Anastasia is the grand duchess missing from the Romanov grave that was discovered near <a href="/wiki/Yekaterinburg" id="w">Yekaterinburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a> and exhumed in 1991.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>

<p>Contemporaries described Maria as a pretty, flirtatious girl, broadly built, with light <a href="/wiki/Brunette" id="w">brown hair</a> and large <a href="/wiki/Eye_color" id="w">blue eyes</a> that were known in the family as &#34;Marie&#39;s saucers&#34;.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Her French tutor <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Gilliard" id="w">Pierre Gilliard</a> said Maria was tall and well-built, with rosy cheeks.<sup id="_ref-Gilliard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilliard" title="">[4]</a></sup> Tatiana Botkina thought the expression in Maria&#39;s eyes was &#34;soft and gentle.&#34;<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> As an infant and toddler, her physical appearance was compared to one of <a href="/wiki/Botticelli" id="w">Botticelli</a>&#39;s angels. <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duke_Vladimir_Alexandrovich_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia</a> nicknamed her &#34;The Amiable Baby&#34; because of her good nature.<sup id="_ref-Eagar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eagar" title="">[6]</a></sup>

As a toddler, little Maria once escaped from her bath and ran naked up and down the palace corridor while her distracted Irish nurse, <a href="/wiki/Margaretta_Eagar" id="w">Margaretta Eagar</a>, who loved politics, discussed the <a href="/wiki/Dreyfus_Affair" id="w">Dreyfus Affair</a> with a friend. &#34;Fortunately, I arrived just at that moment, picked her up and carried her back to Miss Eagar, who was still talking about Dreyfus,&#34; recalled her aunt <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Her older sisters objected to including Maria in their games and once referred to Maria as their &#34;stepsister&#34; because she was so good and never got into trouble, recalled <a href="/wiki/Margaretta_Eagar" id="w">Margaretta Eagar</a> in her own memoirs. However, on occasion the sweet-natured Maria could be mischievous. Once, as a little girl, she stole some biscuits from her mother&#39;s tea table. As a punishment for her surprising behavior, the governess and Alexandra suggested she be sent to bed; however Nicholas objected, stating, &#34;I was always afraid of the wings growing. I am glad to see she is only a human child.&#34; Eagar noted that Maria&#39;s love for her father was &#34;marked&#34; and she often tried to escape from the nursery to &#34;go to Papa.&#34; When the Tsar was ill with <a href="/wiki/Typhoid" id="w">typhoid</a>, the little girl covered a miniature portrait of him with kisses every night.<sup id="_ref-Eagar_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eagar" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to Anastasia, Maria&#39;s siblings were <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Olga_Nikolaevna_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duchess Olga of Russia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Tatiana_Nikolaevna_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duchess Tatiana of Russia</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Haemophilia" id="w">haemophiliac</a> <a href="/wiki/Tsarevich_Alexei_of_Russia" id="w">Tsarevich Alexei of Russia</a>. Maria&#39;s Russian title (<i>Velikaya Knyazna</i> Великая Княжна) is most precisely translated as &#34;Grand Princess&#34;, meaning that Maria, as an &#34;Imperial Highness&#34; was higher in rank than other Princesses in Europe who were &#34;Royal Highnesses&#34;. &#34;Grand Duchess&#34; is the most widely used English translation of the title.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> However, in keeping with her parents&#39; desire to raise Maria and her siblings simply, even servants addressed the Grand Duchess by her first name and <a href="/wiki/Patronym" id="w">patronym</a>, Maria Nikolaevna. She was also called by the French version of her name, &#34;Marie,&#34; or by the Russian nicknames &#34;Masha&#34; or &#34;Mashka&#34;. Maria and her younger sister, Anastasia, were known in the household as the &#34;Little Pair&#34; because they were the younger sisters. Like their older sisters, Olga and Tatiana, the two girls shared a bedroom and spent most of their time together.</p>

<p>Maria and Anastasia were dressed similarly for special occasions, when they wore variations of the same dress.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> She tended to be dominated by her enthusiastic and energetic younger sister. When Anastasia tripped people who walked by, teased others or caused a scene with her dramatics, Maria always tried to apologize, though she could never stop her younger sister.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Maria had simple tastes and was so kind-hearted that she was sometimes taken advantage of by her sisters, who nicknamed her &#34;fat little bow-wow.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Gilliard_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilliard" title="">[4]</a></sup> In 1910, her fourteen-year-old sister Olga persuaded ten-year-old Maria to write their mother a letter asking that Olga be given her own room and be allowed to let down her dresses. Maria tried to persuade her mother that it was her own idea to write the letter.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Her mother&#39;s friend, <a href="/wiki/Lili_Dehn" id="w">Lili Dehn</a>, said that while Maria was not as lively as her three sisters, she knew her own mind.<sup id="_ref-Dehn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dehn" title="">[12]</a></sup> Maria had a talent for drawing and sketched well, always using her <a href="/wiki/Left_handed" id="w">left hand</a>,<sup id="_ref-Buxhoeveden_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Buxhoeveden" title="">[13]</a></sup> but was generally uninterested in her schoolwork.<sup id="_ref-Gilliard_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilliard" title="">[4]</a></sup> She was surprisingly strong and sometimes amused herself by demonstrating how she could lift her tutors off the ground.<sup id="_ref-Gilliard_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilliard" title="">[4]</a></sup> Though usually sweet-natured, Maria could also be stubborn<sup id="_ref-Buxhoeveden_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Buxhoeveden" title="">[13]</a></sup> and occasionally lazy.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Her mother complained in one letter that Maria was grumpy and &#34;bellowed&#34; at the people who irritated her. Maria&#39;s moodiness coincided with her <a href="/wiki/Menstrual_period" id="w">menstrual period</a>, which the Tsarina and her daughters referred to as a visit from &#34;Madame Becker.&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>

Young Maria enjoyed innocent flirtations with the young soldiers she encountered at the palace and on family holidays. She particularly loved children and, had she not been a Grand Duchess, would have loved nothing more than to marry a Russian soldier and raise a large family.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Maria was fond of soldiers from a very early age, according to <a href="/wiki/Margaretta_Eagar" id="w">Margaretta Eagar</a>: {{cquote}}</p>
<p>Alexandra&#39;s letters reveal that Maria, the middle child of the family, sometimes felt insecure and left out by her older sisters and feared she wasn&#39;t loved as much as the other children. Alexandra reassured her that she was as dearly loved as her siblings. At age eleven, Maria apparently developed a painful <a href="/wiki/Limerence" id="w">crush</a> on one of the young men she had met. &#34;Try not to let your thoughts dwell too much on him, that&#39;s what our Friend said,&#34; Alexandra wrote to her on <a href="/wiki/December_6" id="w">December 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1910" id="w">1910</a>. Alexandra advised her third daughter to keep her feelings hidden because others might say unkind things to her about her crush. &#34;One must not let others see what one feels inside, when one knows it&#39;s considered not proper. I know he likes you as a little sister and would like to help you not to care too much, because he knows you, a little Grand Duchess, must not care for him so.&#34;<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Association_with_Grigori_Rasputin" name="Association_with_Grigori_Rasputin"></a><h1>Association with Grigori Rasputin</h1>
<p>Maria, like all her family, doted on the long-awaited heir Tsarevich Alexei, or &#34;Baby,&#34; who suffered frequent complications of haemophilia and nearly died several times. Her mother relied on the counsel of <a href="/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin" id="w">Grigori Rasputin</a>, a Russian peasant and wandering <i><a href="/wiki/Starets" id="w">starets</a></i> or &#34;holy man&#34; and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions. Maria and her siblings were also taught to view Rasputin as &#34;Our Friend&#34; and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, Maria&#39;s aunt <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a> was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Maria, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns. &#34;All the children seemed to like him,&#34; Olga Alexandrovna recalled. &#34;They were completely at ease with him.&#34;<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Rasputin&#39;s friendship with the imperial children was evident in the messages he sent to them. &#34;My Dear Pearl M!&#34; Rasputin wrote the nine-year-old Maria in one telegram in 1908. &#34;Tell me how you talked with the sea, with nature! I miss your simple soul. We will see each other soon! A big kiss.&#34; In a second telegram, Rasputin told the child, &#34;My Dear M! My Little Friend! May the Lord help you to carry your cross with wisdom and joy in Christ. This world is like the day, look it&#39;s already evening. So it is with the cares of the world.&#34;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> In February 1909, Rasputin sent all of the imperial children a telegram, advising them to &#34;Love the whole of God&#39;s nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework.&#34;<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the girls&#39; governesses, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, was horrified in 1910 because Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns. Tyutcheva wanted Rasputin barred from the nurseries. In response to Tyutcheva&#39;s complaints, Nicholas did ask Rasputin to end his nursery visits. &#34;I am so afr(aid) that S.I. can speak ... about our friend something bad,&#34; Maria&#39;s twelve-year-old sister Tatiana wrote to her mother on <a href="/wiki/March_8" id="w">March 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1910" id="w">1910</a>, after begging Alexandra to forgive her for doing something she didn&#39;t like. &#34;I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now.&#34;<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Alexandra eventually had Tyutcheva fired.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Tyutcheva took her story to other members of the family, who were scandalized by the reports, though Rasputin&#39;s contacts with the children were by all accounts completely innocent.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Nicholas&#39;s sister <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Xenia_Alexandrovna_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia</a> was horrified by Tyutcheva&#39;s story. She wrote on <a href="/wiki/March_15" id="w">March 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1910" id="w">1910</a> that she couldn&#39;t understand &#34;...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he&#39;s only a <a href="/wiki/Khlysts" id="w">&#39;&#39;khlyst&#39;&#39;</a>!) He&#39;s always there, goes into the nursery, visits Olga and Tatiana while they are getting ready for bed, sits there talking to them and <i>caressing</i> them. They are careful to hide him from Sofia Ivanovna, and the children don&#39;t dare talk to her about him. It&#39;s all quite unbelievable and beyond understanding.&#34;<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

<p>Another of the nursery governesses claimed in the spring of 1910 that she was raped by Rasputin. Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova had at first been a devotee of Rasputin, but later was disillusioned by him. The empress refused to believe Vishnyakova &#34;and said that everything Rasputin does is holy.&#34; Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova&#39;s claim had been immediately investigated, but &#34;they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard.&#34; Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Rasputin had released ardent letters written to him by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses. The letters circulated throughout society, fueling the rumors. Pornographic cartoons also circulated that depicted Rasputin having sexual relations with the empress, with her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra&#39;s displeasure, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Despite the scandal, the imperial family&#39;s association with Rasputin continued until Rasputin was murdered on <a href="/wiki/December_17" id="w">December 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1916" id="w">1916</a>. &#34;Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy &#39;courses&#39; for their age and their souls have much developed,&#34; Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on <a href="/wiki/December_6" id="w">December 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1916" id="w">1916</a>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared &#34;cold and visibly terribly upset&#34; by Rasputin&#39;s death and sat &#34;huddled up closely together&#34; on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov reported that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse side by Maria, her sisters, and mother.

<p>Revolution broke out in St. Petersburg in the spring of 1917. At the height of the chaos, Maria and her siblings were stricken with measles. The Tsarina was reluctant to move the children to the safety of the imperial residence at <a href="/wiki/Gatchina" id="w">Gatchina</a>, even though she was advised to do so. Maria was the last of the five to fall ill and, while she was still healthy, was a major source of support to her mother. Maria went outside with her mother on the night of <a href="/wiki/March_13" id="w">March 13</a> <a href="/wiki/1917" id="w">1917</a> to plead with the soldiers to remain loyal to the imperial family. Shortly afterwards, the seventeen-year-old fell ill with measles and virulent pneumonia and nearly died. She was not told that her father had abdicated the throne until after she began to recover.<sup id="_ref-Gilliard_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilliard" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>

<p>Tsarina Alexandra chose Maria to accompany Tsar Nicholas II and herself to Yekaterinburg when the family was briefly separated in April 1918. Maria had grown from a child to a woman during the years of captivity, according to the Baroness Sophie Buxhoevden, a lady in waiting, and the Tsarina felt she could depend upon her third daughter to help her as she could not rely upon the deeply depressed Olga or Anastasia, who was still a child. Level-headed Tatiana was needed to watch over her ill brother.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> They were forced to leave their other children behind in Tobolsk because Maria&#39;s brother Alexei was ill. The four other children joined their family in Yekaterinburg several weeks later.</p>

<p>In her letters to her siblings in Tobolsk, Maria described her unease at the new restrictions on the family at Yekaterinburg. She and her parents were searched by guards at the Ipatiev House and were warned they would be subject to further searches. A wooden fence was installed around the house, limiting their view of the street. &#34;Oh, how complicated everything is now,&#34; she wrote on <a href="/wiki/May_2" id="w">May 2</a> <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a>. &#34;We lived so peacefully for eight months and now it&#39;s all started again.&#34;<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Maria passed the time by attempting to befriend members of the <a href="/wiki/Ipatiev_House" id="w">Ipatiev House</a> Guard. She showed them pictures from her photo albums and talked with them about their families and her own hopes for a new life in England if she was released. Alexander Strekotin, one of the guards, recalled in his memoirs that she &#34;was a girl who loved to have fun.&#34; Another of the guards recalled Maria&#39;s buxom beauty with appreciation and said she didn&#39;t assume an air of grandeur.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> One former sentry recalled that Maria was often scolded by her mother in &#34;severe and angry whispers,&#34; apparently for being too friendly with the guards at Yekaterinburg.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Strekotin wrote that their conversations always began with one of the girls saying, &#34;We&#39;re so bored! In Tobolsk there was always something to do. I know! Try to guess the name of this dog!&#34; The teenage girls walked by the sentries, whispering and giggling in a manner that the guards considered flirtatious.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>In his memoirs, one guard recalled that on one occasion another guard forgot himself and told an off-color joke to the grand duchesses during one of these meetings. The offended Tatiana ran from the room, &#34;pale as death.&#34; Maria eyed the man and said, &#34;Why are you not disgusted with yourselves when you use such shameful words? Do you imagine that you can woo a well-born woman with such witticisms and have her be well disposed towards you? Be refined and respectable men and then we can get along.&#34;<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> Ivan Kleschev, a 21-year-old guard, declared that he intended to marry one of the grand duchesses and if her parents said no he would rescue her from the Ipatiev House himself.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ivan Skorokhodov, yet another of the guards, smuggled in a birthday cake to celebrate Maria&#39;s nineteenth birthday on <a href="/wiki/June_26" id="w">June 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a>. Maria slipped away from the group with Ivan Skorokhodov for a private moment and they were discovered when two of his superiors conducted a surprise inspection of the house. Skorokhodov was removed from his position after his actions and friendliness towards the grand duchess were discovered by his commanding officers. In their memoirs, several guards reported that both the Tsarina and her older sister Olga appeared angry with Maria in the days following the incident and that Olga avoided her company.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/July_14" id="w">July 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a>, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family and reported that Maria and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> Maria was murdered on <a href="/wiki/July_17" id="w">July 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a> in the cellar room of the <a href="/wiki/Ipatiev_House" id="w">Ipatiev House</a> in <a href="/wiki/Yekaterinburg" id="w">Yekaterinburg</a>. The murder was carried out by forces of the <a href="/wiki/Bolshevik" id="w">Bolshevik</a> secret police under the command of <a href="/wiki/Yakov_Yurovsky" id="w">Yakov Yurovsky</a>. According to one account of the murders, Maria ran from the assassins and began banging on the door of a storage room and crying for help. She was then shot in the thigh by drunken military commissar Peter Ermakov, who also tried to stab her with a bayonet and shoot her in the head, but may have failed to aim properly. Maria somehow fainted and remained alive until the bodies were inspected to check for pulses. She screamed, causing Ermakov to try and stab her again. When his attempt failed to kill her, he struck her in the face until she was silent. Today her cause of death remains a mystery.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1991, bodies believed to be those of the Imperial Family and their servants were finally exhumed from a mass grave in the woods outside <a href="/wiki/Yekaterinburg" id="w">Yekaterinburg</a>. The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who still ruled Russia when the grave was originally found. Once the grave was opened, the excavators realized that instead of eleven sets of remains (Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, Tsarevitch Alexei, the four Grand Duchesses, Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia; the family&#39;s doctor, <a href="/wiki/Eugene_Botkin" id="w">Yevgeny Botkin</a>; their valet, <a href="/wiki/Alexei_Trupp" id="w">Alexei Trupp</a>; their cook, <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Kharitonov" id="w">Ivan Kharitonov</a>; and Alexandra&#39;s maid, <a href="/wiki/Anna_Demidova" id="w">Anna Demidova</a>) the grave held only nine. Alexei and, according to the late forensic expert Dr. William Maples, Anastasia were missing from the family&#39;s grave.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> Russian scientists contested this, however, and claimed it was Maria&#39;s body that was missing.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> The Russians identified Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest Grand Duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave. They estimated the height and width of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing. American scientists found this method inexact.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> A Russian forensic expert said none of the skulls attributed to the Grand Duchesses had a gap between the front teeth as Maria did.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Mariainkimono1915.jpg" title="Grand Duchess Maria wearing a [[kimono]]-style dressing gown ca. 1915."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariainkimono1915.jpg" alt="Grand Duchess Maria wearing a [[kimono]]-style dressing gown ca. 1915." title="Grand Duchess Maria wearing a [[kimono]]-style dressing gown ca. 1915." class="location-left type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Grand Duchess Maria wearing a <a href="/wiki/Kimono" id="w">kimono</a>-style dressing gown ca. 1915.</div> 
American scientists thought the missing body to be Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, that they would have expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7 inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists&#39; assertion that Anastasia&#39;s remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA" id="w">mitochondrial DNA</a> from the skeletons was compared against mitochondrial DNA from relatives of the imperial family in the maternal line of descent, including the Tsarina&#39;s great-nephew <a href="/wiki/Prince_Philip%2C_Duke_of_Edinburgh" id="w">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, and was found to be a match. Scientists believed that the matching DNA was enough to identify the remains of the Imperial Family and their servants. The fate of the two missing children remains a mystery. Some historians believe the account detailed in the &#34;Yurovsky Note&#34;, a report filed by commander <a href="/wiki/Yakov_Yurovsky" id="w">Yakov Yurovsky</a> with his superiors following the murders. Yurovsky wrote that two of the bodies were removed from the main grave and cremated at an undisclosed area.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> If the Whites ever discovered the grave, Yurovsky believed they would doubt the grave belonged to the Tsar and his retinue because the body count would be incorrect. Some forensic experts believe the complete burning of two bodies in so short a time would have been impossible given the environment and materials possessed by Yurovsky and his men.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> Numerous searches of the area in subsequent years failed to turn up a cremation site or the remains of the two missing Romanov children.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> </p>

<div class="thumbcaption"><center>An official portrait of Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia Nikolaevna in 1916.</center></div> According to the accounts of some of the guards, there may have been an opportunity for one or more of the guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>At least two of the Grand Duchesses were said to have survived the initial attack on the Royal Family. Two of the Grand Duchesses, Maria and Anastasia, &#34;sat up screaming&#34; when they were being carried out to a waiting truck. They were then attacked again.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> There have been claims made that Maria was the Grand Duchess who survived. A man named <a href="/wiki/Alex_Brimeyer" id="w">Alex Brimeyer</a> claimed to be Maria&#39;s grandson &#34;Prince Alexis d&#39;Anjou de Bourbon-Condé Romanov-Dolgoruky.&#34; He said Maria had escaped to Romania, married and had a daughter, Olga-Beata. Olga-Beata then allegedly married and had a son named &#34;Prince Alexis&#34;. Brimeyer was sentenced to 18 months in prison by a Belgian court after he was sued in 1971 by the Dolgoruky family and the Association of Descendants of the Russian Nobility of Belgium.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> Two young women claiming to be Maria and her sister Anastasia were taken in by a priest in the <a href="/wiki/Ural_Mountains" id="w">Ural Mountains</a> in 1919, where they lived as nuns until their deaths in 1964. They were buried under the names Anastasia and Maria Nikolaevna.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> </p>
<p>More recently, Gabriel Louis Duval wrote a book, <i>A Princess in the Family</i>, claiming that his foster grandmother &#34;<a href="/wiki/Granny_Alina" id="w">Granny Alina</a>&#34; might have been the Grand Duchess Maria.<sup id="_ref-Negus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Negus" title="">[63]</a></sup> According to Duval, Granny Alena married a man named Frank and emigrated to South Africa. She later lived with his family before dying in 1969. Her body was exhumed, but DNA was too degraded to be useful in determining whether she shared DNA with the imperial family. Most historians discount the claims that Maria or another member of the family survived the killings.<sup id="_ref-Negus_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Negus" title="">[63]</a></sup> Until his own assassination in 1979, her first cousin, <a href="/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten%2C_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma" id="w">Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma</a>, kept a photograph of Maria beside his bed in memory of the crush he had upon her.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_23" id="w">August 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky&#39;s memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones are from a boy who was roughly between the ages of ten and thirteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three years old. Maria was nineteen years, one month old at the time of the assassinations while her sister Anastasia was seventeen years, one month old and her brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday. Maria&#39;s elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old at the time of the assassinations. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found &#34;shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber.&#34; The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes. Tests are still being conducted on the remains to determine whether they are the remains of the two missing Romanov children.<sup id="_ref-_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-" title="">[65]</a></sup> </p>
