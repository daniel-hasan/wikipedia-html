{{Nihongo}} is a <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> <a href="/wiki/Manga" id="w">manga</a> <a href="/wiki/Mangaka" id="w">authored</a> by <a href="/wiki/Kouji_Seo" id="w">Kouji Seo</a>. The series is a character-driven romance story that uses the athletics of <a href="/wiki/Athletics_(track_and_field)" id="w">track and field</a> as a subplot. The story primarily follows the life of the teenager Yamato Akitsuki, who moved to Tokyo to change himself, and his main love interest Suzuka Asahina, a talented and highly <a href="/wiki/Scout_(sport)" id="w">scouted</a> high jumper who lives in Yamato&#39;s aunt&#39;s dormitory and attends his new high school.</p>
<p><i>Suzuka</i> was serialized in the Japanese magazine <i><a href="/wiki/Weekly_Shonen_Magazine" id="w">Weekly Shonen Magazine</a></i> published by <a href="/wiki/Kodansha" id="w">Kodansha</a>. It was adapted into a twenty-six episode <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a> series and aired on <a href="/wiki/TV_Tokyo" id="w">TV Tokyo</a> in Japan between <a href="/wiki/6_July" id="w">6 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> and <a href="/wiki/28_December" id="w">28 December</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>. Both versions of the series have been licensed for release in <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a> by two different companies. The manga has been licensed for publication by <a href="/wiki/Del_Rey_Manga" id="w">Del Rey Manga</a> under their mature line. The anime series has been licensed and is being released by <a href="/wiki/FUNimation_Entertainment" id="w">FUNimation Entertainment</a>.</p>
<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h1>Plot</h1>
<p>The plot is based on a young man, Yamato Akitsuki, who moves from his rural home in <a href="/wiki/Hiroshima_Prefecture" id="w">Hiroshima Prefecture</a> to live at his aunt&#39;s apartment building and <a href="/wiki/Sent%C5%8D" id="w">indoor bath</a> complex in <a href="/wiki/Tokyo" id="w">Tokyo</a> and attend the local athletics-oriented <a href="/wiki/High_school" id="w">high school</a>. Before arriving at his new home, he walks past his new school and sees a young girl practicing <a href="/wiki/High_jump" id="w">high jump</a> at the track field. </p>
<p>He falls in love with her at first sight but does not expect to see her again. He soon discovers that the girl, Suzuka Asahina, is one of the occupants of his aunt&#39;s apartment and that they happen to live next door to each other. To pursue Suzuka, Yamato joins the <a href="/wiki/Athletics_(track_and_field)" id="w">track and field</a> team in hopes of impressing her. After joining the team, he discovers that he has the potential to become a top hundred-meter <a href="/wiki/Sprint_(race)" id="w">sprinter</a>. The story intertwines his pursuit of love and athletics. </p>
<p>Suzuka&#39;s character-driven plot predominantly makes use of <a href="/wiki/Dramatic_structure" id="w">dramatic structure</a> to facilitate character development. <a href="/wiki/Characterization" id="w">Characterization</a> is further achieved through the use of character <a href="/wiki/Back-story" id="w">back-story</a>. The story in general employs a <a href="/wiki/Verisimilitude_(literature)" id="w">realistic</a> <a href="/wiki/Tone_(fiction)" id="w">tone</a>, but will occasionally use <a href="/wiki/Surreal_humour" id="w">surreal humour</a>. Some events covered in the story are: track competitions, vacations, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_Cultural_Festival" id="w">culture festivals</a>, and outings to a <a href="/wiki/Karaoke_Box" id="w">Karaoke Box</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Theme_park" id="w">theme park</a>. The manga and anime follow the same storyline, though there are minor differences. One of these changes is that the nude scenes are less graphic in the anime than the manga. Another disparity is the hair color of some of the characters such as the character Miki, who is depicted as having bright red hair on the covers of the manga, but is portrayed with brown hair in the anime.</p>

In April 2005, <i><a href="/wiki/Weekly_Shonen_Magazine" id="w">Weekly Shonen Magazine</a></i> announced through their website that <i>Suzuka</i> was being adapted into an anime.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The animated TV series was directed by <a href="/wiki/Hiroshi_Fukutomi" id="w">Hiroshi Fukutomi</a> and was co-produced by <a href="/wiki/Studio_Comet" id="w">Studio Comet</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marvelous_Entertainment" id="w">Marvelous Entertainment</a>.

The anime follows relatively close to the first seventy-two chapters of the manga, but some scenes were removed or subdued because of the nudity, such as scenes in the <a href="/wiki/Sent%C5%8D" id="w">bath house</a>.

<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h1>Reception</h1>
<a id="Manga" name="Manga"></a><h2>Manga</h2>
<p><i>Suzuka</i> has been compared to other manga such as <i><a href="/wiki/Love_Hina" id="w">Love Hina</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-Delnew_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Delnew" title="">[3]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Maison_Ikkoku" id="w">Maison Ikkoku</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-unwound_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-unwound" title="">[8]</a></sup> and <i><a href="/wiki/Kimagure_Orange_Road" id="w">Kimagure Orange Road</a></i><sup id="_ref-film_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-film" title="">[9]</a></sup> since, early on, it used similar <a href="/wiki/Plot_(narrative)" id="w">plot structure</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plot_device" id="w">plot devices</a>. These comparisons have become less frequent as the story became more developed. According to Kouji Seo, <i>Suzuka</i> was to be a romance story from the beginning, and he had no intention of creating a <a href="/wiki/Harem_(genre)" id="w">harem</a> manga.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Since <i>Suzuka</i> primarily focuses on character development through the use of many different plot devices, it becomes hard to classify.<sup id="_ref-comsn12_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comsn12" title="">[11]</a></sup> Like other manga, <i>Suzuka</i> contains <a href="/wiki/Fan_service" id="w">fan service</a> which is less frequent than other series, but is more graphic.<sup id="_ref-TJ_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TJ" title="">[12]</a></sup> Since the North American version is uncensored, this caused the manga to be rated &#34;Mature&#34; and sold in <a href="/wiki/Shrink_wrap" id="w">shrink wrap</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Kouji Seo&#39;s artwork is considered to be above average, but rather generic. He does make use of a variety of perspectives that is comparable to the different types of <a href="/wiki/Shot_(film)" id="w">shots</a> in film as well as his characters are often shown wearing different changes of clothing throughout the manga.<sup id="_ref-comsn12_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comsn12" title="">[11]</a></sup> Kouji Seo also pays attention to detail which can be seen in the clothing that gives off the sensation they are made out of different material along with the reflections in the windows during the nighttime.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> This detail can also be seen in his characters as they all have complex personalities that make them interesting and have substance.<sup id="_ref-comicbookbin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-comicbookbin" title="">[15]</a></sup> Overall the reception of the manga has been positive.</p>
<a id="Anime" name="Anime"></a><h2>Anime</h2>
<p>The anime has been described as having &#34;all the trappings of a standard high school romantic comedy&#34;,<sup id="_ref-animeondvd_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-animeondvd" title="">[16]</a></sup> but lacks the spirit and craftsmanship of the manga.<sup id="_ref-ANNreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANNreview" title="">[17]</a></sup> Since the anime is a close adaptation from the manga, the criticisms of the plot are the same of it being described as generic. The anime sells &#34;...themselves solely on the merits of character development&#34;.<sup id="_ref-film_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-film" title="">[9]</a></sup> One effect of this character development is that some viewers will find the <a href="/wiki/Title_role" id="w">title character</a> and the male lead unlikable.<sup id="_ref-dvdt2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvdt2" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ANN DVD 5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN DVD 5" title="">[19]</a></sup> The animation is considered to be ordinary with some scenes that have timing problems, look awkward, or have objects that seem oversized.<sup id="_ref-ANNreview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANNreview" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Them_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Them" title="">[20]</a></sup> The voice actors performances are considered to be mundane and sound rather flat, in both Japanese and English languages.<sup id="_ref-ANNreview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANNreview" title="">[17]</a></sup> Viewers with sensitive hearing might also pick up on the switches between <a href="/wiki/Monaural" id="w">mono</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stereophonic_sound" id="w">stereo</a> audio in the different episodes.<sup id="_ref-animeondvd_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-animeondvd" title="">[16]</a></sup> The sports scenes are poorly animated, and the best animated scenes include night-time scenes.<sup id="_ref-ANN DVD 5_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANN DVD 5" title="">[19]</a></sup> Overall the reception of the anime so far has been mixed.</p>
<a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h2>Music</h2>
<p>The response to the soundtrack for the anime is somewhat mixed. Most find the music respectable, but some may detest it when it tries to be funny.<sup id="_ref-ANNreview_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANNreview" title="">[17]</a></sup> The opening and ending songs that were re-written and performed in English made the songs fairly close approximations of the originals and worked out better than one might imagine,<sup id="_ref-ANNreview_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANNreview" title="">[17]</a></sup> but others still prefer the Japanese versions.<sup id="_ref-dvdt2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvdt2" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
