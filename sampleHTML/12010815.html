The <b><a href="/wiki/Military_history_of_Gibraltar_during_World_War_II" id="w">military history of Gibraltar during World War II</a></b> exemplifies <a href="/wiki/Gibraltar" id="w">Gibraltar</a>&#39;s position as a <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British</a> fortress since the early <a href="/wiki/18th_century" id="w">18th century</a> and as a vital factor in British military strategy, both as a foothold on the <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">continent of Europe</a>, and as a bastion of <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" id="w">British sea power</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, Gibraltar served a vital role in the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Theatre_of_World_War_II" id="w">Mediterranean Theatre</a>, controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea" id="w">Mediterranean Sea</a> from the west.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to its commanding position, Gibraltar provided a strongly-defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. <a href="/wiki/Force_H" id="w">Force H</a>, under the command of <a href="/wiki/James_Fownes_Somerville" id="w">Vice-Admiral James Somerville</a> was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Malta_(1940)" id="w">besieged island of Malta</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> During the course of the war, Gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from <a href="/wiki/Vichy_France" id="w">Vichy French</a> aircraft and Italian aircraft based on <a href="/wiki/Sardinia" id="w">Sardinia</a>. Additionally, the island fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italian</a> <a href="/wiki/Commando" id="w">commando</a> <a href="/wiki/Frogman" id="w">frogman</a> unit <i><a href="/wiki/Decima_Flottiglia_MAS" id="w">Decima Flottiglia MAS</a></i> and their <a href="/wiki/Human_torpedo" id="w">human torpedoes</a>, which were based on the interned Italian ship <i>SS Olterra</i> in the nearby Spanish harbour of <a href="/wiki/Algeciras" id="w">Algeciras</a>.<sup id="_ref-bbc1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc1" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Inside the <a href="/wiki/Rock_of_Gibraltar" id="w">Rock of Gibraltar</a> itself, miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone. Masses of rock were blasted out to build an &#34;underground city&#34;.<sup id="_ref-bbc1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc1" title="">[4]</a></sup> In huge man-made caverns, barracks, offices, and a fully equipped hospital were constructed, complete with an <a href="/wiki/Operating_room" id="w">operating theatre</a> and <a href="/wiki/X-Ray" id="w">x-ray equipment</a>.<sup id="_ref-bbc1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbc1" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Operation_Torch" id="w">Operation Torch</a>, the Allied invasion of <a href="/wiki/French_North_Africa" id="w">French North Africa</a> in November 1942, was coordinated from the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Rock_of_Gibraltar" id="w">Rock</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-optorch_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-optorch" title="">[5]</a></sup> General <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" id="w">Dwight D.

The harbour continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the <a href="/wiki/Convoy" id="w">convoy</a> routes through the Mediterranian until <a href="/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day" id="w">V-E Day</a> in 1945. </p>

<a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> dramatically changed the lives of Gibraltarians.<sup id="_ref-c2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c2" title="">[6]</a></sup> The decision to enforce mass <a href="/wiki/Evacuation" id="w">evacuation</a> in order to increase the strength of the <a href="/wiki/Rock_of_Gibraltar" id="w">Rock</a> with more <a href="/wiki/Military" id="w">military</a> and <a href="/wiki/Navy" id="w">naval</a> personnel meant that most Gibraltarians (some for up to ten years) had nowhere to call &#39;home&#39;.<sup id="_ref-c2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c2" title="">[6]</a></sup> Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being &#39;British&#39; by sharing in the war effort.<sup id="_ref-c2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c2" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In June 1940 about 13,500 evacuees were shipped to <a href="/wiki/Casablanca" id="w">Casablanca</a> in <a href="/wiki/French_Morocco" id="w">French Morocco</a>, but following the <a href="/wiki/Capitulation_(surrender)" id="w">capitulation</a> of the <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">German</a> armies in June 1940, the new Pro-German French Vichy Government found the presence of Gibraltarian evacuees in Casablanca an embarrassment and sought opportunities for their removal.<sup id="_ref-c2_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c2" title="">[6]</a></sup> The opportunity soon arose when 15 British <a href="/wiki/Cargo_ship" id="w">cargo vessels</a> arrived under Commodore Crichton repatriating 15,000 French servicemen who had been rescued from <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Dunkirk" id="w">Dunkirk</a>.<sup id="_ref-c2_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c2" title="">[6]</a></sup> Once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked, the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the evacuees.<sup id="_ref-c2_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c2" title="">[6]</a></sup> Although Crichton was unable to obtain permission to clean and restock his ships (and contrary to <a href="/wiki/Admiralty" id="w">British Admiralty</a> orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees) when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards, he opened up his gangways for boarding.<sup id="_ref-c2_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c2" title="">[6]</a></sup> However, when they arrived at Gibraltar, the <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Gibraltar" id="w">Governor</a> would not allow them to land fearing that once the evacuees were back on the Rock, it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time.<sup id="_ref-c1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c1" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Crowds gathered in John Macintosh square in the centre of Gibraltar as the news broke, speeches were made and two <a href="/wiki/Local_government_in_the_United_Kingdom#Councils and councillors" id="w">City Councillors</a> accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor (Sir Clive Liddel) to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land.<sup id="_ref-c6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c6" title="">[8]</a></sup> After receiving instructions from <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the Rock, and by <a href="/wiki/13_July" id="w">13 July</a> the re-evacuation back to Gibraltar had been completed.<sup id="_ref-c6_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c6" title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>British <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)" id="w">conservative</a> politician <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Stanley" id="w">Oliver Stanley</a> agreed to accept the evacuees in the United Kingdom, but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved.<sup id="_ref-c6_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c6" title="">[8]</a></sup> The Governor, he declared, had given the number of evacuees first as 13,000, then as 14,000 and finally as 16,000.<sup id="_ref-c6_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c6" title="">[8]</a></sup> He asked for the situation to be clarified, stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13,000 could be accepted, 2000 of whom were to be sent to the <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portuguese</a> Atlantic island of <a href="/wiki/Madeira" id="w">Madeira</a>.<sup id="_ref-c6_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c6" title="">[8]</a></sup> The situation, replied General Liddel on <a href="/wiki/19_July" id="w">19 July</a>, â€˜is that this is a fortress liable to heave and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22,000.<sup id="_ref-c6_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c6" title="">[8]</a></sup> The 13,000 was the number sent to <a href="/wiki/Morocco" id="w">Morocco</a>, and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered.â€™<sup id="_ref-c6_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c6" title="">[8]</a></sup> In London the evacuees were placed in the hands of the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Health" id="w">Ministry of Health</a>, and many were housed in <a href="/wiki/Kensington" id="w">Kensington</a> area.<sup id="_ref-c6_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c6" title="">[8]</a></sup> Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified, coupled with the arrival of harrowing letters, describing the circumstances in which the evacuees were living.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In September rumours were already circulating among the evacuees, and in Gibraltar, that the possibility of re-evacuating the Gibraltarians once more was being mooted, this time the destination being <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" id="w">Jamaica</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" id="w">West Indies</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> After much contention, it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island, and 1,093 evacuees left for Jamaica direct, on <a href="/wiki/9_October" id="w">9 October</a>, with more following later on.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> However petitions followed and the demands were met, partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The situation at the end of 1940, therefore, was that approximately 2,000 evacuees were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira, with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the London area.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

A document came to light in the top secret files of the offices of British <a href="/wiki/Naval_intelligence" id="w">naval intelligence</a> giving details of the plan, codenamed <i>Operation Tracer</i>, which was hatched during the darkest days of the Second World War.<sup id="_ref-c12_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> Six men were to be sealed in a cave with only two small openings to the outside world and left with enough supplies for one year. They were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the walls. Only if Germany was defeated within a year would they be released.<sup id="_ref-c12_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The volunteers â€“ two doctors, three signalmen and their leader â€“ would run an observation post from the two 12 inch by 6 inch slits, one looking due east out over the Mediterranean and the other west over the <a href="/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar" id="w">Strait of Gibraltar</a> and the harbour and wireless back all shipping movements to the <a href="/wiki/Admiralty" id="w">British Admiralty</a>.<sup id="_ref-c12_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> The potential menace of Germanyâ€™s invasion was seen as a potential threat and by late 1941, ideas for a series of secret observation posts (first in Gibraltar and later in other places like <a href="/wiki/Malta" id="w">Malta</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aden" id="w">Aden</a>) were put together as Operation Tracer.<sup id="_ref-c12_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Work in Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Geoffry Birley and his chief engineer Colonel Fordham. The site chosen at Lord Aireyâ€™s Battery on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existing tunnelling scheme for a shelter.<sup id="_ref-c12_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> 
Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" id="w">MI6</a> radio expert Colonel Gambier-Parry. Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task.<sup id="_ref-c12_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> A member of <a href="/wiki/Robert_Falcon_Scott" id="w">Scott</a>â€™s ill-fated <a href="/wiki/Terra_Nova_Expedition" id="w">expedition to the Antarctic</a>, Murray Levick was called up as Surgeon-Commander to advise on survival techniques.<sup id="_ref-c12_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> There were practical matters such as diet, exercise, sanitation and clothing to consider as well as vital â€˜psychology of the personnelâ€™.<sup id="_ref-c12_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation.<sup id="_ref-c12_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars. However, Operation Tracer was never needed, as <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a> turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" id="w">Eastern Front</a>.<sup id="_ref-c12_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The operation had been clouded in mystery until the discovery of papers at the <a href="/wiki/Public_Records_Office" id="w">Public Records Office</a> in <a href="/wiki/Kew" id="w">Kew</a> <a href="/wiki/UK" id="w">UK</a>.<sup id="_ref-c12_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> Previously in the 1960s, details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as â€˜Operation Monkey,â€™ yet facts were very sparse.<sup id="_ref-c12_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1997 &#39;Stay Behind Cave&#39; (as it was nicknamed) was discovered in Gibraltar by the <i>Gibraltar Caving Group</i>,<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission.<sup id="_ref-c12_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-c12" title="">[20]</a></sup> The discovery came about when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel. Further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over 50 years.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In November 2006 Jim Crone and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson, senior tunnel guide with the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Gibraltar_Regiment" id="w">Royal Gibraltar Regiment</a>, met possibly the only member of Operation Tracer still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W.

<p>The aircraft climbed normally from the runway, levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour.<sup id="_ref-bloo_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bloo" title="">[27]</a></sup> The 62-year-old general died, along with 15 others.<sup id="_ref-bloo_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bloo" title="">[27]</a></sup> The sole survivor was the Czech-born pilot, Max Prchal, who was rescued by an RAF launch.<sup id="_ref-bloo_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bloo" title="">[27]</a></sup> The bodies of five passengers and crew, including Sikorski&#39;s daughter, were never found.<sup id="_ref-bloo_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bloo" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Investigation" name="Investigation"></a><h2>Investigation</h2>
<p>In 1943 a British Court of Inquiry investigated the crash of Sikorski&#39;s <a href="/wiki/B-24_Liberator" id="w">Liberator II</a> <i>AL523</i>, but was unable to determine the probable cause, finding only that it was an accident<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> and the &#34;aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established&#34;. A popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to jamming aircraft controls.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Despite this finding, the political context of the event, coupled with a variety of curious circumstances, immediately gave rise to speculation that Sikorski&#39;s death had been no accident, and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet, British or even Polish conspiracy.<sup id="_ref-BBC'06_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC'06" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Six weeks before the crash, while Sikorski had been at Gibraltar for the first time, en route to his Middle East inspection, a Polish government office in London received a phone call stating that Sikorski had been killed in a crash at Gibraltar; the call had been discounted as a prank, but has since led to speculation. It is often mentioned that two of Sikorski&#39;s previous planes had been subject to incidents.
