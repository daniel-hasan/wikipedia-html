Throughout most of the <a href="/wiki/History_of_Poland" id="w">history of Poland</a>, the <b>banner of <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a></b> was one of the main symbols of the Polish State, normally reserved for use by the <a href="/wiki/Head_of_state" id="w">head of state</a>. Although its design changed with time, it was generally a <a href="/wiki/Banner#Heraldic banners" id="w">heraldic banner</a>, i.e., one based directly on the <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Poland" id="w">national coat of arms</a>: a crowned White Eagle on a red field (<i><a href="/wiki/Gules" id="w">Gules</a> an eagle <a href="/wiki/Argent" id="w">Argent</a> crowned <a href="/wiki/Or_(heraldry)" id="w">Or</a></i>). The banner should not be confused with the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Poland" id="w">flag of Poland</a>, a white and red <a href="/wiki/Gallery_of_bicolor_flags" id="w">horizontal bicolor</a>, officially adopted in 1919.</p>
<p>Derived from early <a href="/wiki/Slavic_peoples" id="w">Slavic</a> flag-like objects, a royal <a href="/wiki/Banner#Heraldic banners" id="w">banner of arms</a> dates as far back as the 11th century <a href="/wiki/Common_Era" id="w">CE</a>. A symbol of royal authority, it was used at coronations and in battles. In the <a href="/wiki/History_of_Poland_(1918%E2%80%931939)" id="w">interwar</a> period, it was replaced with the <b>Banner of the Republic of Poland</b>, which was part of the presidential insignia. A national banner is not mentioned in the current (2007) regulations on Polish national symbols, although today&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Jack_of_the_President_of_the_Republic_of_Poland" id="w">presidential jack</a> is based directly on the pre-war design for the Banner of the Republic. </p>

<p>The banner of Poland traces its origins to the early <a href="/wiki/Slavic_peoples" id="w">Slavic</a> <a href="/wiki/Vexilloid" id="w">vexilloids</a> known as <i>stanice</i> (pronounced: {{IPA}}; singular: <i>stanica</i>), probably used at least as early as the 10th century <a href="/wiki/Common_Era" id="w">CE</a>.

<p>With Poland&#39;s conversion to <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a> in the late 10th century, the pagan <i>stanice</i> were probably Christianized by replacing pagan symbols with Christian ones such as images of patron saints, or a <a href="/wiki/Labarum" id="w">Chi-Rho</a> or dove symbolizing the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Spirit" id="w">Holy Spirit</a>.<sup id="_ref-pietras_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pietras" title="">[2]</a></sup> In 1000 CE, during his pilgrimage to the tomb of <a href="/wiki/Adalbert_of_Prague" id="w">Saint Adalbert</a> in <a href="/wiki/Gniezno" id="w">Gniezno</a>, the capital of Poland until about 1040, Emperor <a href="/wiki/Otto_III%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Otto III</a> officially recognized Duke <a href="/wiki/Boleslaus_I_of_Poland" id="w">Boleslaus the Brave</a> as King of Poland (see <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Gniezno" id="w">Congress of Gniezno</a>), crowning him and presenting him with a replica of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Lance" id="w">Holy Lance</a>, also known as <a href="/wiki/Saint_Maurice" id="w">Saint Maurice</a>&#39;s Spear. This <a href="/wiki/Relic" id="w">relic</a>, together with the <i>vexillum</i> attached to it, was probably the first insignia of the nascent <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Poland_(1025%E2%80%931385)" id="w">Kingdom of Poland</a>, a symbol of King Boleslaus&#39;s rule, and of his allegiance to the Emperor. It remains unknown what images, if any, were painted or embroidered on the <i>vexillum</i>.<sup id="_ref-znamier_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-znamier" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-lileyko_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lileyko" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>A royal banner was used as early as the reign of <a href="/wiki/Boleslaus_II_of_Poland" id="w">Boleslaus the Generous</a> (1076-1079). The earliest mention of a banner (<a href="/wiki/Polish_language" id="w">Polish</a>: <i>chorągiew</i>, pronounced: {{IPA}}) bearing the sign of an <a href="/wiki/Eagle" id="w">eagle</a> is found in <a href="/wiki/Wincenty_Kad%C5%82ubek" id="w">Wincenty Kadłubek</a>&#39;s <i>Chronicle</i> which says that Duke <a href="/wiki/Casimir_II_of_Poland" id="w">Casimir the Just</a> fought the <a href="/wiki/Ruthenians" id="w">Ruthenians</a> in 1182 &#34;under the sign of the victorious eagle&#34;. A seal of Duke <a href="/wiki/Premislaus_II_of_Poland" id="w">Premislaus II</a> from 1290 shows the ruler holding a banner emblazoned with a crowned eagle. Five years later, Premislaus was crowned King of Poland, and he made the crowned White Eagle a <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Poland" id="w">national coat of arms</a>. During the reign of King <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_I_the_Elbow-high" id="w">Ladislaus the Elbow-High</a> (1320–1333), the red cloth with the White Eagle was finally established as the Banner of the Kingdom of Poland (Polish: <i>chorągiew Królestwa Polskiego</i>). The orientation of the eagle on the banner varied; its head could point either upwards or towards the <a href="/wiki/Hoist_(flag)" id="w">hoist</a>. The actual rendering of the eagle changed with time according to new artistic styles.<sup id="_ref-znamier_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-znamier" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The national banner was identical with that of <a href="/wiki/Lesser_Poland" id="w">Lesser Poland</a>, the territory where <a href="/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w" id="w">Kraków</a>, the capital of Poland until 1596, is located.

<p>One of the most famous standard-bearers of Kraków was <a href="/wiki/Marcin_of_Wrocimowice" id="w">Marcin of Wrocimowice</a> (d. 1442) who carried the national banner in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Grunwald" id="w">Battle of Grunwald</a> (<a href="/wiki/St%C4%99bark" id="w">Tannenberg</a>) in 1410.

During the course of the battle, according to Długosz, the national banner slipped out of Marcin&#39;s hand and fell to the ground, but it was quickly picked up and saved from destruction by the Polish army&#39;s most valiant knights, which further motivated the Poles to strive for victory over the <a href="/wiki/Teutonic_Knights" id="w">Teutonic Knights</a>.<sup id="_ref-długosz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-długosz" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

With the establishment of a <a href="/wiki/Dynastic_union" id="w">dynastic union</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania" id="w">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a> in 1386, it became customary to use two banners&#8212;Polish and Lithuanian&#8212;as equally important insignia of royal authority. In the mid-16th century, before the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" id="w">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> (<a href="/wiki/Real_union" id="w">real union</a>) in 1569, a single banner for the entire entity also came into use. The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white emblazoned with the <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" id="w">arms of the Commonwealth</a> which combined the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (<a href="/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Lithuania" id="w">Pursuer</a>). During the 17th century, the banner was often divided into three or four horizontal stripes of white and red, ending with swallowtails. <a href="/wiki/Free_election" id="w">Elective kings&#39;</a> dynastic arms were often placed in an <a href="/wiki/Inescutcheon" id="w">inescutcheon</a>. Variants with the White Eagle and the Pursuer placed side by side without an <a href="/wiki/Escutcheon" id="w">escutcheon</a> directly in the field or with the Eagle on the <a href="/wiki/Obverse" id="w">obverse</a> and the Pursuit on the reverse side of the banner were also used.<sup id="_ref-znamier_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-znamier" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>During royal coronations, however, separate banners for each of the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth were still used. Crown (i.e., Polish) and Lithuanian standard-bearers carried the furled banners in a procession to the royal cathedral where, shortly after the anointment and just before the crowning of the king-elect, they handed the banners to the <a href="/wiki/Primate_(religion)" id="w">primate</a> who unfurled them and handed them to the kneeling king.

<a id="Time_of_partitions" name="Time_of_partitions"></a><h3> Time of partitions </h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland" id="w">Partitions of Poland</a> at the end of the 18th century brought an end to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The King (<a href="/wiki/Tsar" id="w">Tsar</a>) of Poland at that time used a white royal banner emblazoned with the arms of the Congress Kingdom&#8212;a black double-headed <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_the_Russian_Federation" id="w">Russian eagle</a> with the Polish White Eagle in an inescutcheon.<sup id="_ref-znamier_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-znamier" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>As a symbol of presidential authority, the banner was carried or flown to mark the presence of the head of state and, at the same time, the commander-in-chief. It was flown on the president&#39;s official residence, and used as a car flag and instead of number plates on the president&#39;s vehicle.
