<p><b>Ashford Green Corridor</b> is a green space that runs through the town of <a href="/wiki/Ashford%2C_Kent" id="w">Ashford</a> in <a href="/wiki/Kent" id="w">Kent</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>. The Green Corridor is made up of parks, recreation grounds and other green spaces alongside the rivers that flow through Ashford. </p>
<p>The town has been growing steadily since the early 19th century. As the town has expanded, land close to the rivers has not usually been built on, due to the risk of flooding because the <a href="/wiki/Ashford_(borough)" id="w">Ashford Borough Council</a> has protected it as green space. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Flood_protection" name="Flood_protection"></a><h1>Flood protection</h1>

<p>Because the Green Corridor areas are right next to Ashford&#39;s rivers, many of them hold floodwater, protecting homes and businesses. This is particularly important now because floods seem to be occurring more frequently.</p>
<a id="Wildlife" name="Wildlife"></a><h1>Wildlife</h1>

<p>The Green Corridor brings wildlife to the town. Ashford&#39;s rivers are surprisingly natural considering their urban surroundings, and are home for many wild plants and animals. <a href="/wiki/Kingfishers" id="w">Kingfishers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grass_Snake" id="w">Grass Snakes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Damselflies" id="w">Damselflies</a> and possibly <a href="/wiki/Water_Vole" id="w">Water Voles</a> can all be seen. Ponds like the one at Bowen&#39;s Field attract amphibians. Singleton Lake is a habitat for wetland birds and Buxford Meadow is a wet grassland with an enormous range of plants, insects and other species. It is because these habitats are so close to where people live that the Green Corridor has been designated as a <a href="/wiki/Local_Nature_Reserve" id="w">Local Nature Reserve</a>.</p>	
<a id="Heritage" name="Heritage"></a><h1>Heritage</h1>
<p>From the manors of Singleton and Buxford in the west, to Boys Hall Moat (a scheduled ancient monument) in the east, the Green Corridor is rich in heritage. Victoria Park, with its fountain and commemorative trees, the intriguingly named &#39;Watercress Fields&#39;, and Martyr&#39;s Field with its macabre past - all have stories to tell. Many areas were farmed until relatively recently and are living links to Ashford&#39;s past as an agricultural market town.</p>
