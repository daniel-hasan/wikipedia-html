<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h2> Plot </h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Light_Yagami" id="w">Light Yagami</a> is an extremely intelligent young man who resents the crime and corruption in the world. His life undergoes a drastic change in the year 2003, when he discovers a mysterious notebook, known as the &#34;Death Note&#34;, lying on the ground. The Death Note&#39;s instructions claim that if a human&#39;s name is written within it, that person shall die. Light is initially skeptical of the Death Note&#39;s authenticity, believing it is just a prank. However, after experimenting with it and killing two criminals, Light is forced to admit that the Death Note is real. After meeting with the previous owner of the Death Note, a <i><a href="/wiki/Shinigami" id="w">shinigami</a></i> named <a href="/wiki/Shinigami_(Death_Note)#Ryuk" id="w">Ryuk</a>, Light seeks to become &#34;the God of the new world&#34; by passing his judgment on criminals.</p>
<p>Soon, the number of inexplicable deaths of reported criminals catches the attention of the <a href="/wiki/Interpol" id="w">International Police Organization</a> and a mysterious detective known only as &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/L_(Death_Note)" id="w">L</a></i>&#34;. L quickly learns that the serial killer, dubbed by the public as &#34;<i>Kira</i>&#34; (derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the word &#34;<i>Killer</i>&#34;), is located in Japan. L also concludes that Kira can kill people without laying a finger on them. Light realizes that L will be his greatest nemesis, and a game of psychological <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Cat_and_mouse_game">cat and mouse</a> between the two begins.</p>

<p>{{Main}}</p>
<a id="Main_characters" name="Main_characters"></a><h3> Main characters </h3>
<dl><dt><span id="Light">{{Nihongo}}</span></dt></dl>
<dl><dd>The protagonist of <i>Death Note</i>, Light is an extremely intelligent but bored 17-year old student. When he finds the Death Note, dropped in the human world by Ryuk (a shinigami), he decides to use it to kill all criminals and earns the title <i>Kira</i>. His ultimate goal is to cleanse the world of evil to create a <a href="/wiki/Utopia" id="w">utopia</a> and then reign over this new world as its <a href="/wiki/God" id="w">god</a>.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><span id="L">{{Nihongo}}</span></dt></dl><dl><dd>L is the world&#39;s three top-rated detectives (through two additional aliases), tasked with tracking down and arresting Kira. As such, he is Light&#39;s arch-enemy. His disheveled appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. L has many quirks, such as sitting in an odd manner, snacking on sweets constantly, and holding his cellphone and other objects in a peculiar manner. He often takes drastic strategies to confuse and force the hand of his opponents.  On several occasions he has willingly disclosed several of his weaknesses to Kira at the risk of his own life in the hopes that he would lure him into a trap.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><span id="Misa">{{Nihongo}}</span></dt></dl><dl><dd>A girl with an immense crush on Kira, Misa is a popular <a href="/wiki/Japanese_idol" id="w">idol</a> in <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>, and tends to wear clothing in many different styles, depending on what she is doing. She is immature and tends to refer to herself in the third person in an attempt to be cute. Misa is completely devoted to Light, and she once said that she loved him at first sight. Light, however, only views her as an asset to his plans because of her Death Note and her <i>Shinigami</i> eyes (that she obtained at the cost of half of her remaining life span, twice). The murderer of Misa&#39;s parents had been punished by Kira, explaining her later devotion to him.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><span id="Mello">{{Nihongo}}</span></dt></dl><dl><dd>Mello was an orphan who grew up with Near in Watari&#39;s shelter for gifted children. Like Near, Mello was one of the candidates to become L&#39;s successor. Similar to L&#39;s fondness for sweets, he is often seen eating bars of chocolate. Although Mello is quite intelligent, he often lets his emotions get the better of him. Mello wears leather most of the time, unlike Near or L. He also appears to be less secluded in terms of his friends and hobbies, and seems to be fond of biking. When Mello is first released - Light tries to find and kill him, which he manages to escape - but due to an explosion, he is left with a scar over the left side of his face.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><span id="Near">{{Nihongo}}</span></dt></dl><dl><dd>Near was a primary candidate to become L&#39;s successor and calls himself N during the course of his investigations. He shares a number of similarities with L. Much like how L plays with things such as sugar cubes and forks, Near is frequently shown playing with toys or his hair. Near also sits in an unusual manner similar to L, but with some slight differences. He offered to join forces with Mello to fight Kira, but Mello turned him down. Near then gained the support of the US government and formed the Secret Provision for Kira (SPK).</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><span id="Teru">{{Nihongo}}</span></dt></dl><dl><dd>Mikami is selected as the fourth Kira by Light, after Light decides that it is too dangerous for the Death Note to be near Misa or himself, since he and Misa are currently under surveillance by Aizawa and Mogi. A prosecuting attorney and adamant supporter of Kira, Mikami shares many of the same ideals, thoughts, and priorities as Kira, and is ecstatic when he discovers that Kira, his God, has chosen him, proving that God is on his side and watching. He is completely devoted and loyal to Kira, believing that divine justice must be brought down upon the people. Little is known about his personal life; he appears to have no hobbies or anything else of the sort. He chants &#34;delete&#34; with each name he writes down in the Death Note due to events in his past when he thought God was &#34;deleting&#34; the evil people in his life. He, like Misa, has made the exchange of half his remaining years for <i>Shinigami</i> eyes.</dd></dl>

<p>{{main}}
</p><dl><dt><span id="Ryuk">{{Nihongo}}</span></dt></dl><dl><dd>The first <i><a href="/wiki/Shinigami" id="w">shinigami</a></i> who dropped a Death Note into the human world, which Light would pick up. Acting out of pure boredom, Ryuk begins the story of Death Note on a whim. It is stated that Ryuk obtained the second Death Note in the <i>shinigami</i> world from &#34;tricking the old man&#34; for another one. Ryuk is not Light&#39;s ally, and in fact declares in their first meeting that someday he (Ryuk) would write Light&#39;s name into his own Death Note. Ryuk often refuses to aid Light and instead enjoys watching him struggle for his goals. He acts for his own interests and entertainment, and often fails to tell Light key details about the Death Note. However, Ryuk will aid Light if it serves his own goals, such as providing amusement or obtaining apples, without which he suffers a form of <a href="/wiki/Withdrawal" id="w">withdrawal symptoms</a>.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><span id="Rem">{{Nihongo}}</span></dt></dl><dl><dd>The female <i><a href="/wiki/Shinigami" id="w">shinigami</a></i> who first gives Misa her Death Note and trades her for the <i>Shinigami</i> eyes. Similar to Ryuk, Rem possesses two Death Notes; however, she purposely gives one of them to Misa Amane. Rem inherited her second Death Note from Jealous, another <i>shinigami</i> who died when he saved Misa&#39;s life, and thought it only right to pass it on to Misa. Rem inherits Jealous&#39; love for Misa as well and is prompt to defend Misa even at the cost of her life. Rem shows this when she states that she will kill Light if Misa dies before her time.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt><span id="Shidou">{{Nihongo}}</span></dt></dl><dl><dd>The third <a href="/wiki/Shinigami" id="w">Shinigami</a> seen in the human world, Shidou is revealed as the original owner of the Death Note Ryuk dropped at the beginning of the series.  Initially upon entering the human world, Shidou relentlessly follows Ryuk, demanding the return of their Death Note.  Ryuk eventually admits he has no knowledge of the location of Shidou&#39;s Death Note, said note having been used as a bargaining chip by Light and fallen into Mello&#39;s hands.  Shidou eventually locates their Death Note, and under questioning, reveals to Mello (who subsequently reveals to Near) that some of the rules written in the Death Note are fake.</dd></dl>
<a id="Death_Note" name="Death_Note"></a><h2> Death Note </h2>
<p>A Death Note is a book held by a <i><a href="/wiki/Shinigami" id="w">shinigami</a></i> which has the power to kill people if certain conditions are met. All Death Notes follow a long set of specific rules, and the writer revealed a few of these rules with each volume of the <a href="/wiki/Manga" id="w">manga</a> in <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>.</p>
<a id="Written_rules" name="Written_rules"></a><h4> Written rules </h4>
<p>Before releasing his Death Note into the human world, Ryuk wrote some of the more basic rules on the first page in <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a>, because he believed that English was the most popular language in the world. The rules written by Ryuk are the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The human whose name is written in this note shall die.</li>
<li>This note will not take effect unless the writer has the subject&#39;s face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.</li>
<li>If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the subject&#39;s name, it will happen.</li>
<li>If the cause of death is not specified, the subject will simply die of a <a href="/wiki/Cardiac_arrest" id="w">heart attack</a>. </li>
<li>After writing the cause of death, the details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds (400 seconds).</li></ul>
<p>Each volume of the <a href="/wiki/Manga" id="w">manga</a> has a page containing new rules or possible uses for the <i>Death Note</i>. In the <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a> series, each <a href="/wiki/Eyecatch" id="w">eyecatch</a> contains a different rule written in both English and <a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" id="w">Japanese</a>, similar to how they were revealed in the Japanese manga. Two new rules are revealed in almost every episode.</p>
<a id="Media" name="Media"></a><h2> Media </h2>
<p><i>Death Note</i> began as a <a href="/wiki/Manga" id="w">manga</a> series which was later adapted to become a set of <a href="/wiki/Live_action" id="w">live-action</a> <a href="/wiki/Film" id="w">films</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a> based on the manga, and a light novel. Two games have also been released at present for the <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_DS" id="w">Nintendo DS</a> in Japan, the first being a &#39;Mafia&#39; inspired social game and the second being a <a href="/wiki/Board_game" id="w">board game</a> with traps.

<i>Kira Game</i> is a strategy game where the player takes on the role of Kira or L. These are just titles, as any character can be Kira or L. The player will attempt to deduce who their enemy is (Kira will try to uncover L&#39;s identity and vice versa). This will play out in 3 phases: Investigation, where the player will discuss the case and clues with other characters; Voting, where each member of the investigation team casts a vote on who they suspect is L or Kira based on the player&#39;s performance in the previous phase; L/Kira, where the player can either focus their investigation on one member to see if they are Kira (L part) or force a member off of the team (Kira part).<sup id="_ref-game_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-game" title="">[23]</a></sup> The gameplay is very similar to that of the common party game <a href="/wiki/Mafia_(game)" id="w">Mafia</a>.</p>
