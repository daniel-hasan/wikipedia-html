<b><i>Double Allergic</i></b> is the second <a href="/wiki/Studio_album" id="w">studio album</a> by <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australian</a> <a href="/wiki/Alternative_rock" id="w">alternative rock</a> <a href="/wiki/Band_(music)" id="w">band</a>, <a href="/wiki/Powderfinger" id="w">Powderfinger</a>, released on <a href="/wiki/2_September" id="w">2 September</a>, <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a> in Australia through <a href="/wiki/Polydor_Records" id="w">Polydor</a>. The album was produced by Australian <a href="/wiki/Tim_Whitten" id="w">Tim Whitten</a>, and was widely considered Powderfinger&#39;s mainstream breakthrough&#8212;it has been certified triple platinum, with over 200,000 copies sold. <i>Double Allergic</i> was also nominated for five <a href="/wiki/ARIA_awards" id="w">ARIA awards</a>, with singles from the album nominated for an additional four, however it didn&#39;t win any.</p>
<a id="Recording_and_production" name="Recording_and_production"></a><h2>Recording and production</h2>
<p><i>Double Allergic</i> contained material that had been written by Powderfinger in 1995 and 1996. Prior to its release, <a href="/wiki/Guitarist" id="w">guitarist</a> <a href="/wiki/Darren_Middleton" id="w">Darren Middleton</a> described it as &#34;by far the best thing we&#39;ve done&#34;,<sup id="_ref-RaveMag_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RaveMag" title="">[1]</a></sup> an analogy that would be commonly made in the future when comparing the album to its predecessor, <i><a href="/wiki/Parables_for_Wooden_Ears" id="w">Parables for Wooden Ears</a></i>. Middleton said the album was good because the band new the sound they wanted before they started work on it; he also described it as &#34;the most concise continuation of who we are down on record&#34;.<sup id="_ref-RaveMag_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RaveMag" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Lead_singer" id="w">Lead singer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Fanning" id="w">Bernard Fanning</a>, noted that another important element of the album was that there &#34;was more space in the songs, it wasn&#39;t overcrowded&#34;.<sup id="_ref-IINM_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IINM" title="">[2]</a></sup> However, Fanning commented that Powderfinger hadn&#39;t intended to greatly change their sound in creating <i>Double Allergic</i>&#8212;instead, the change in sound came as a natural progression.<sup id="_ref-IINM_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IINM" title="">[2]</a></sup> Guitarist <a href="/wiki/Ian_Haug" id="w">Ian Haug</a> agreed, stating the music was &#34;more melodic and sort of simpler&#34;, without &#34;so many different time signatures and things&#34;.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" id="w">Rolling Stone</a></i> author Tracey Grimson also commented on this, stating that &#34;Powderfinger have become practical advocates of space&#34; and lauding their acknowledgment that the &#34;absence of sound can be lush, evocative&#34;. She noted that even in the &#34;rockers&#34; on the album; songs like &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pick_You_Up" id="w">Pick You Up</a>&#34; and &#34;Skinny Jean&#34;, the band were still able to pull back and give the songs additional space.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Powderfinger spent less money in producing <i>Double Allergic</i> than on their previous work. Previously, the band had worked with <a href="/wiki/Tony_Cohen" id="w">Tony Cohen</a>, whom Fanning stated was expensive due to his success in the industry. For <i>Double Allergic</i> the band chose <a href="/wiki/Tim_Whitten" id="w">Tim Whitten</a>, a less well known producer, and because the band knew what they intended to do as they entered the studio, they managed to spend less money despite the improved sound.<sup id="_ref-IINM_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IINM" title="">[2]</a></sup> Middleton commented on Whitten&#39;s capabilities in the recording studio, saying &#34;He&#39;s what a band looks for in a producer/engineer, because he&#39;s got his own ideas&#34;, but stating that Whitten would also listen to and appreciate the band&#39;s ideas.<sup id="_ref-Budden_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Budden" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

The song peaked at #42 on the ARIA charts and stayed in the top 50 for three weeks.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> &#34;Living Type&#34; was written by Fanning about the <a href="/wiki/Manson_Family" id="w">Manson Family</a> <a href="/wiki/Cult" id="w">cult</a>, and came with an <i><a href="/wiki/X-Files" id="w">X-Files</a></i> style <a href="/wiki/Music_video" id="w">music video</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The song appeared at #32 on the <a href="/wiki/Triple_J_Hottest_100%2C_1996" id="w">Triple J Hottest 100, 1996</a>.<sup id="_ref-JJJ_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JJJ" title="">[13]</a></sup> The fourth single, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Take_Me_In" id="w">Take Me In</a>&#34;, was released on <a href="/wiki/12_May" id="w">12 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>. It failed to chart, and was the least noted single from the album. Fanning wrote &#34;Take Me In&#34; as a response to <a href="/wiki/Hypocrisy" id="w">hypocrisy</a> by <a href="/wiki/Police" id="w">police</a>, which he had read about in <a href="/wiki/Newspaper" id="w">newspapers</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The album contains three <a href="/wiki/Secret_track" id="w">secret tracks</a> placed onto the twelfth track after silence that follows the track&#39;s primary song &#34;(The Return of) The Electric Horseman&#34;. The first of these is called &#34;Vladimir&#34; which, according to Fanning is about a transvestite.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> The second song is called &#34;SS&#34; which refers to Australian cricket bat manufacturer <a href="/wiki/Stuart_Surridge" id="w">Stuart Surridge</a>, which is often known as <i>SS</i>. The song refers in part to the bat itself, though mostly to cricket in general, with lyrics &#34;<i>Then we&#39;ll race like jets for the fading moon; Then we all fall down</i>&#34;, which refers to running for the opposite crease following striking the ball, and then diving to the ground to secure the <a href="/wiki/Run_(cricket)" id="w">run</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The third and final secret track is called &#34;Come Away&#34; which also featured as a B-side for the single of &#34;Pick You Up&#34;.

<a id="Critical_response" name="Critical_response"></a><h2>Critical response</h2>
<p><i>Double Allergic</i> was well received by <i><a href="/wiki/All_Music_Guide" id="w">All Music Guide</a></i>, with reviewer Jonathan Lewis claiming that Powderfinger &#34;managed to successfully create an album of melodic pop songs coupled with noisy guitars&#34;. The album was summarised as &#34;a cohesive and mature effort&#34;.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Sputnikmusic</i> reviewer blueyxd, had mixed feelings about the album. The level of experimentation in the album was praised, with the reviewer stating that &#34;the instrument playing and some of the unusual styles used&#34; were beneficial. However, the main concern was that there wasn&#39;t enough experimentation, and that the album was rather &#34;solid&#34;, thus earning it its score of 3.5.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Juice</i> <a href="/wiki/Magazine" id="w">magazine</a> reviewed <i>Double Allergic</i> positively, calling it a much more mature album than its predecessor, <i><a href="/wiki/Parables_for_Wooden_Ears" id="w">Parables for Wooden Ears</a></i>. The &#34;band&#39;s mellowing tone&#34;, compared to the &#34;aggression&#34; in past works, was also commended, with the review stating that &#34;the result is an album filled with potential and character.&#34; The experimentation on &#34;<a href="/wiki/JC_(song)" id="w">JC</a>&#34;, &#34;Glimpse&#34;, and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Oipic" id="w">Oipic</a>&#34; was again praised, with comparisons to <a href="/wiki/Motown" id="w">Motown</a> drawn. The review summarised the album as &#34;proof of a band maturing, streets ahead of anything they&#39;ve previously recorded&#34;.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
