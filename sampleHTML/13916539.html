<a id="Biography" name="Biography"></a><h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Beard, a great-grandson of Vice President <a href="/wiki/John_C._Breckinridge" id="w">John C. Breckinridge</a>, was born into a well-off family and grew up at the Westbury Hotel on East 69th Street in <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" id="w">Manhattan</a>.  His relationship with his parents was cool, to judge by his quip &#34;I never saw my mother up close.&#34;  </p>
<p>He attended the <a href="/wiki/Taft_School" id="w">Taft School</a>, where he was a leader at the humor magazine, and he decided to become a humorous writer after reading <i><a href="/wiki/Catch-22" id="w">Catch-22</a></i>.  </p>
<p>He then went to <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" id="w">Harvard University</a> (from which he graduated in 1967<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>) and joined its humor magazine, the <i><a href="/wiki/Harvard_Lampoon" id="w">Harvard Lampoon</a></i>, which circulated nationally.  Much of the credit for the Lampoon&#39;s success during the mid 1960s is given to Beard and <a href="/wiki/Douglas_Kenney" id="w">Douglas Kenney</a>, who was in the class a year after Beard&#39;s.<sup id="_ref-Karp_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Karp" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Lovenheim87_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lovenheim87" title="">[3]</a></sup>  In 1968, Beard and Kenney wrote the successful parody <i><a href="/wiki/Bored_of_the_Rings" id="w">Bored of the Rings</a></i>.  </p>
<p>In 1969, Beard, Kenney and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Hoffman" id="w">Rob Hoffman</a> became the founding editors of the magazine <i><a href="/wiki/National_Lampoon" id="w">National Lampoon</a></i>, which reached a circulation of over 1,000,000 in the early 1970s.  One of Beard&#39;s short stories published there, &#34;The Last Recall&#34;, was included in the 1973 <i>Best Detective Stories of the Year</i>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  During the early 1970s, Beard was also in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Reserve" id="w">Army Reserve</a>, which he hated.<sup id="_ref-Hendra_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hendra" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1975 the three founders cashed in on a buy-out agreement for <i>National Lampoon</i>; Beard got US$2.8 million and left the magazine.<sup id="_ref-Hendra_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hendra" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  After an &#34;unhappy&#34; attempt at screenwriting, he turned to writing humorous books.<sup id="_ref-Karp372_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Karp372" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Those that have reached the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list" id="w">New York Times Best Seller list</a> are <i>Sailing: A Sailor&#39;s Dictionary</i> (1981, with <a href="/wiki/Roy_McKie" id="w">Roy McKie</a>),<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> <i>Miss Piggy&#39;s Guide to Life</i> (1981),<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> <i>Leslie Nielsen&#39;s Stupid Little Golf Book</i> (1995, with <a href="/wiki/Leslie_Nielsen" id="w">Leslie Nielsen</a>),<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> <i>French for Cats</i> (1992, with <a href="/wiki/John_Boswell_(publishing-business_figure)" id="w">John Boswell</a>),<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> and <i>O.J.&#39;s Legal Pad</i> (1995, with John Boswell and <a href="/wiki/Ron_Barrett" id="w">Ron Barrett</a>).<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>  Other notable books include <i><a href="/wiki/Latin_for_All_Occasions" id="w">Latin for All Occasions</a></i> (1990) and <i>The Official Politically Correct Dictionary and Handbook</i> (1992, with <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Cerf" id="w">Christopher Cerf</a>).</p>

<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" id="w">New York Times</a></i> has described Beard as &#34;enigmatic&#34;.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Among the enigmas, apparently, is his birthdate.  Not even the year of his birth appears in the in the Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication data of his books or in various Web and print sources.  However, Josh Karp&#39;s biography of Doug Kenney says that Beard was &#34;a nearly thirty-year-old man&#34; when he left the <i>National Lampoon</i> on March 18, 1975<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> and an article published on November 29, 1987, gives his age as 42.<sup id="_ref-Lovenheim87_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lovenheim87" title="">[3]</a></sup>  The birth year given above, 1945, is based on these two statements.</p>
<p>According to Josh Karp, Beard is remembered from his Harvard years as patrician but not obsessed with the appearance or cleanliness of his clothes, misanthropic but not malicious, with a mind that understood and could organize any subject, a gifted student who occasionally wrote parodic papers.  He was prematurely mature and the <i>Harvard Lampoon<b>s arbiter.  As a comic writer he excelled at parody, and his hero was <a href="/wiki/S._J._Perelman" id="w">S. J. Perelman</a>.  All these characteristics meant that he was an excellent working partner with Kenney, who was flamboyant, fond of poses, and given to seeing humor where others recoiled.<sup id="_ref-Karp_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Karp" title="">[2]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>Many of these characteristics, not just the clothes, continued into Beard&#39;s <i>National Lampoon</i> years.  The comedy writer <a href="/wiki/Chris_Miller_(writer)" id="w">Chris Miller</a> remembers that Beard &#34;knew everything&#34; and, on leaving the <i>Lampoon</i>, said that he was sick of being the father to all the writers.  (Beard would have been about 30.)<sup id="_ref-Miller_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Miller" title="">[15]</a></sup>  The comic writer and actor <a href="/wiki/Tony_Hendra" id="w">Tony Hendra</a> says that at the beginning of Beard&#39;s tenure, he was painfully shy but the magazine&#39;s authority over what material was used.  In the next few years, he went through &#34;the greening of Beard&#34;, growing his hair, switching from cheap beer to good whiskey, and in 1974, forming a relationship with the writer <a href="/wiki/Gwyneth_Cravens" id="w">Gwyneth Cravens</a>.<sup id="_ref-Hendra_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hendra" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1991, an article in a reliable publication said that Beard and Cravens divided their time between Manhattan and a renovated boat shed in <a href="/wiki/East_Hampton" id="w">East Hampton</a> and  referred to them as partners.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>  A 2006 interview in a different publication said that Beard and Cravens had married.<sup id="_ref-Miller_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Miller" title="">[15]</a></sup>  Also in 2006, Karp wrote that &#34;reportedly&#34; the couple had added California to their list of addresses and that Beard played golf almost daily but never kept score.<sup id="_ref-Karp372_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Karp372" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
