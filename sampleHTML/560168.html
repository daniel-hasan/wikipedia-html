<p><b>Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm Freiherr von Lützow</b> (<a href="/wiki/May_18" id="w">May 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1782" id="w">1782</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/December_6" id="w">December 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1834" id="w">1834</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia" id="w">Prussian</a> <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_general" id="w">lieutenant general</a> notable for his organization and command of a <i><a href="/wiki/L%C3%BCtzow_Free_Corps" id="w">Freikorps</a></i> of volunteers during the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" id="w">Napoleonic Wars</a>.</p>
<a id="Biography" name="Biography"></a><h1>Biography</h1>
<p>Lützow was born in <a href="/wiki/Berlin" id="w">Berlin</a>.</p>
<p>He first entered the <a href="/wiki/Prussian_Army" id="w">Prussian Army</a> in <a href="/wiki/1795" id="w">1795</a>, and eleven years later as a lieutenant took part in the disastrous <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Auerstadt" id="w">battle of Auerstadt</a>. He then achieved distinction in the siege of <a href="/wiki/Kolberg" id="w">Kolberg</a>, as the leader of a squadron of <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_Baptista_von_Schill" id="w">Schill</a>&#39;s volunteers. In <a href="/wiki/1808" id="w">1808</a>, as a major he retired from the Prussian army, indignant at the humiliating <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Tilsit" id="w">treaty of Tilsit</a>. He took part in the heroic venture of his old chief Schill in 1809; wounded at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Dodendorf" id="w">Dodendorf</a> and left behind, he thereby escaped the fate of his comrades. In 1811 he was restored to the Prussian army as major, and at the outbreak of the war of liberation received permission from <a href="/wiki/Gerhard_von_Scharnhorst" id="w">Scharnhorst</a> to organize a free corps consisting of infantry, cavalry and <a href="/wiki/Tirol" id="w">Tirolese</a> marksmen, for operating in the French rear and rallying the smaller governments into the ranks of the allies.</p>
<p>This corps played a marked part in the campaign of <a href="/wiki/1813" id="w">1813</a>. But Lützow was unable to coerce the minor states, and the wanderings of the corps had little military influence. At Kitzen (near <a href="/wiki/Leipzig" id="w">Leipzig</a>) the whole corps, warned too late of the <a href="/wiki/Armistice_of_Poischwitz" id="w">armistice of Poischwitz</a>, was caught on the French side of the line of demarcation. So called as being the only brigade containing no foreign elements in the army and, as a fighting force, annihilated. Lützow himself, wounded, cut his way out with the survivors, and immediately began reorganizing and recruiting.</p>
<p>In the second part of the campaign the corps served in more regular warfare under Wallmoden. Lützow and his men distinguished themselves at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Gadebusch" id="w">Gadebusch</a> (where <a href="/wiki/Karl_Theodore_Korner" id="w">Körner</a> fell) and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Gohrde" id="w">Gohrde</a> (where Lützow himself, for the second time, received a severe wound at the head of the cavalry). Sent next against <a href="/wiki/Denmark" id="w">Denmark</a>, and later employed at the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_J%C3%BChich" id="w">siege of Jühich</a>, Lützow in 1814 fell into the hands of the French.</p>
<p>After the peace of <a href="/wiki/1814" id="w">1814</a> the corps was dissolved, the infantry becoming the 25th Regiment, the cavalry the 6th Ulans. At <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Ligny" id="w">Ligny</a> he led the 6th Ulans to the charge, but they were broken by the French cavalry, and he finally remained in the hands of the enemy, escaping, however, on the day of <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo" id="w">Waterloo</a>. Made colonel in this year, his subsequent promotions were: major-general 1822, and lieutenant-general (on retirement) 1830. </p>
<p>One of the last acts of his life for which Lützow is remembered is his challenge (which was ignored) to <a href="/wiki/Gebhard_Leberecht_von_Bl%C3%BCcher" id="w">Blücher</a>, who had been ridden down in the rout of the 6th Ulans at Ligny, and had made, in his official report, comments thereon, which their colonel considered disparaging.</p>
<p>Several German warships including <a href="/wiki/SMS_L%C3%BCtzow" id="w">SMS &#39;&#39;Lützow&#39;&#39;</a> of World War I, and the heavy cruiser <a href="/wiki/German_cruiser_L%C3%BCtzow_(Hipper_class)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Lützow&#39;&#39;</a> (ex-<i>Deutschland</i>) of World War II, were named after him.</p>
