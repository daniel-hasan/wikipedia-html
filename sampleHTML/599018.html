<p>On June 29, 2005, after walking out onto <a href="/wiki/Ameriquest_Field" id="w">Ameriquest Field</a> for a pre-game warmup against the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim" id="w">Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim</a>, Rogers <a class="externallink" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2097491" rel="nofollow" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2097491">shoved two cameramen</a>, knocking a camera to the ground. One of the reporters then resumed filming and Rogers shoved him again, this time kicking the camera after it had been knocked to the ground a second time. He had to be restrained and was sent home. Larry Rodriguez of <a href="/wiki/Dallas/Fort_Worth_Metroplex" id="w">Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex</a>&#39; <a href="/wiki/Fox_Network" id="w">Fox Network</a> affiliate <a href="/wiki/KDFW" id="w">KDFW</a> was taken to a local hospital, complaining of shoulder, arm and leg pain.

<p>On July 1, 2005, Commissioner <a href="/wiki/Bud_Selig" id="w">Bud Selig</a> suspended Rogers for 20 games and fined him $50,000.

Rogers appealed the suspension, which was upheld by Selig. The commissioner was later overruled by independent <a href="/wiki/Arbitration" id="w">arbitor</a> Shyam Das, allowing Rogers to return to play after sitting out 13 games. </p>
<p>On July 18, 2005, Rogers was charged with a Class A <a href="/wiki/Misdemeanor" id="w">misdemeanor</a> assault charge with regard to Rodriguez and a Class C <a href="/wiki/Misdemeanor" id="w">misdemeanor</a> assault charge with regard to <a href="/wiki/FSN_(Fox_Sports_Net)" id="w">FSN Southwest</a> cameraman David Mammeli.

He means a lot to our team and to guys like me,&#34; said Tigers starter <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Bonderman" id="w">Jeremy Bonderman</a>, on Kenny Rogers.</p>
<p>Rogers, on his first year in <a href="/wiki/Detroit" id="w">Detroit</a>: &#34;There&#39;s a lot of benefits here, by far, that you wouldn&#39;t know as a visiting player, and for me, I&#39;ve been around quite a while, but I appreciate the town, the city, the people.  The travel for a baseball player is very hard, but here it&#39;s not that difficult. It lends itself to being able to relax on certain days that you could get off. There&#39;s just more benefits, especially when you have the quality of people here like <a href="/wiki/Dave_Dombrowski" id="w">Dombrowski</a> and like we have in <a href="/wiki/Mike_Ilitch" id="w">Mr. Ilitch</a>, those things that you can&#39;t take for granted.  You add in <a href="/wiki/Jim_Leyland" id="w">Jim Leyland</a> and the coaching staff here, and I just got lucky to choose this place.... Right when I went in the door and met them, I knew. I knew where I was going to end up.&#34; <a class="externallink" href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/7EDCEA272D32871F8625720D00781877?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/7EDCEA272D32871F8625720D00781877?OpenDocument">http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/7EDCEA272D32871F8625720D00781877?OpenDocument</a></p>
<p>On March 30, 2007, <a href="/wiki/ESPN" id="w">ESPN</a> reported that Kenny Rogers would miss three months after undergoing surgery for a blood clot in his pitching shoulder.

<a id="2006_postseason" name="2006_postseason"></a><h3>2006 postseason</h3>
<p>On October 6, 2006, Rogers pitched his way to his first postseason win pitching 7⅔ scoreless innings, with 8 <a href="/wiki/Strikeouts" id="w">strikeouts</a> in a 6-0 Tigers victory against the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Yankees" id="w">New York Yankees</a> in <a class="externallink" href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/boxscore?gid=261006106" rel="nofollow" title="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/boxscore?gid=261006106">Game 3</a> of the <a href="/wiki/American_League_Division_Series" id="w">American League Division Series</a>.  At 41 years and 330 days old, he became the oldest starting pitcher to earn his first career postseason win. </p>
<p>A week later on October 13, Rogers retired nine batters in a row, in <a class="externallink" href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/boxscore?gid=261013106" rel="nofollow" title="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/boxscore?gid=261013106">Game 3</a> of the <a href="/wiki/American_League_Championship_Series" id="w">American League Championship Series</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Oakland_Athletics" id="w">Oakland Athletics</a>, allowing only two hits and two walks in 7⅓ scoreless innings, while striking out six and pacing the Tigers to a 3-0 victory, leaving the Tigers one win away from their first <a href="/wiki/World_Series" id="w">World Series</a> since {{by}}.</p>
<p>Rogers started <a class="externallink" href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/boxscore?gid=261022106" rel="nofollow" title="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/boxscore?gid=261022106">Game 2</a> of the <a href="/wiki/2006_World_Series" id="w">2006 World Series</a> on October 22, 2006. &#34;We wanted Kenny to pitch two games at home,&#34; Leyland said<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>. He left the game with the Tigers in the lead 3-0, pitching 8 shutout innings, retiring 10 straight batters, striking out five, allowing only two hits, with three walks, making him the oldest starting pitcher to win a World Series game<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>, and one of only two pitchers over the age of 40 to do so (<a href="/wiki/Curt_Schilling" id="w">Curt Schilling</a> would become the second in 2007).</p>
<p>During the first inning, <a href="/wiki/FOX" id="w">FOX</a> cameras caught a smudge on Rogers&#39;s pitching hand. Rogers said it was dirt mixed with <a href="/wiki/Rosin" id="w">rosin</a> from the rosin bag, wiped it off and pitched 8 scoreless innings for the win. Major League Baseball spokesperson Rich Levin said the incident was investigated, and the substance was described as dirt. Since it was not ruled to be a foreign substance, per Rule 8.02, Rogers remained in the game<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>. In the process, Rogers extended his streak to 23 shutout innings. Examination of images from previous games has revealed similar smudges in two other games <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The national media’s coverage of the incident was dubbed “Smudge-gate”.</p>
