<p>The <b>Battle of Edson&#39;s Ridge</b>, also known as the <b>Battle of the Bloody Ridge</b>, <b>Battle of Raiders Ridge</b>, and <b>Battle of the Ridge</b>, was a land <a href="/wiki/Battle" id="w">battle</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_War" id="w">Pacific campaign</a> of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> between <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army" id="w">Imperial Japanese Army</a> and <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" id="w">Allied</a> (mainly <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" id="w">United States Marine Corps</a>) ground forces. It took place <a href="/wiki/September_12" id="w">September 12</a>&#8211;<a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a> on <a href="/wiki/Guadalcanal" id="w">Guadalcanal</a> Island in the <a href="/wiki/Solomon_Islands" id="w">Solomon Islands</a>, and was the second of three separate major Japanese ground offensives in the <a href="/wiki/Guadalcanal_campaign" id="w">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.</p>
<p>In the battle, U.S. Marines, under the overall command of <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">U.S.</a> <a href="/wiki/Major_General" id="w">Major General</a> <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Vandegrift" id="w">Alexander Vandegrift</a>, repulsed an attack by the Japanese 35th Infantry Brigade, under the command of <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> Major General <a href="/wiki/Kiyotake_Kawaguchi" id="w">Kiyotake Kawaguchi</a>.  The Marines were defending the Lunga perimeter that guarded <a href="/wiki/Henderson_Field_(Guadalcanal)" id="w">Henderson Field</a> on Guadalcanal, which was captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on <a href="/wiki/August_7" id="w">August 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>.  Kawaguchi&#39;s unit was sent to Guadalcanal in response to the Allied landings with the mission of recapturing the <a href="/wiki/Airport" id="w">airfield</a> and driving the Allied forces from the island.  Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, which at that time numbered about 12,000 personnel, Kawaguchi&#39;s 6,000 soldiers conducted several nighttime <a href="/wiki/Frontal_assault" id="w">frontal assaults</a> on the U.S. defenses.  The main Japanese assault occurred on an unnamed <a href="/wiki/Ridge" id="w">ridge</a> south of Henderson Field that was manned by troops from several U.S. Marine Corps units, primarily troops from the <a href="/wiki/Marine_Raiders" id="w">1st Raider</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paramarines" id="w">1st Parachute</a> <a href="/wiki/Battalion" id="w">Battalions</a> under U.S. Marine Corps <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel" id="w">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="/wiki/Merritt_A._Edson" id="w">Merritt A. Edson</a>.  Although the U.S. Marine Corps defenses were almost overrun, Kawaguchi&#39;s attack was defeated with heavy losses for the Japanese attackers.</p>
<p>Because of the key participation by Edson&#39;s unit in defending the ridge, the ridge was commonly referred to as &#34;Edson&#39;s&#34; ridge in historical accounts of the battle in <a href="/wiki/Western_world" id="w">Western</a> sources.  After Edson&#39;s Ridge, the Japanese continued to send troops to Guadalcanal for further attempts to retake Henderson Field, affecting Japanese offensive operations in other areas of the <a href="/wiki/Oceania" id="w">South Pacific</a>.</p>

<a id="Guadalcanal_campaign" name="Guadalcanal_campaign"></a><h2>Guadalcanal campaign</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_7" id="w">August 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="/wiki/Tulagi" id="w">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Florida_Islands" id="w">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Solomon_Islands" id="w">Solomon Islands</a>.  The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as <a href="/wiki/Military_base" id="w">bases</a> for threatening the <a href="/wiki/Materiel" id="w">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>. They were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a <a href="/wiki/Military_campaign" id="w">campaign</a> to isolate the major Japanese base at <a href="/wiki/Rabaul" id="w">Rabaul</a> and support the Allied <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea_campaign" id="w">New Guinea campaign</a>.  The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Taking the Japanese by surprise, by nightfall on <a href="/wiki/August_8" id="w">August 8</a> the Allied landing forces  had <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Tulagi_and_Gavutu-Tanambogo" id="w">secured Tulagi</a> and nearby small islands, as well as an airfield under construction at Lunga Point ({{coord}}) on Guadalcanal.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Vandegrift placed his 11,000 troops of the <a href="/wiki/1st_Marine_Division_(United_States)" id="w">1st Marine Division</a> on Guadalcanal in a loose perimeter around the Lunga Point area.  </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_12" id="w">August 12</a>, the airfield was named <a href="/wiki/Henderson_Field_(Guadalcanal)" id="w">Henderson Field</a> after Major <a href="/wiki/Lofton_Henderson" id="w">Lofton Henderson</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Naval_aviator" id="w">Marine aviator</a> who had been killed at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Midway" id="w">Battle of Midway</a>.  The Allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of Henderson Field were called the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Cactus_Air_Force" id="w">Cactus Air Force</a>&#34; after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

 response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Imperial_General_Headquarters" id="w">Imperial General Headquarters</a> assigned the Imperial Japanese Army&#39;s 17th Army, a <a href="/wiki/Corps" id="w">corps</a>-sized command based at Rabaul ({{coord}}) and under the command of Lieutenant-General <a href="/wiki/Harukichi_Hyakutake" id="w">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>, with the task of retaking Guadalcanal from Allied forces.  The 17th Army, currently heavily involved with the Japanese campaign in <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea" id="w">New Guinea</a>, had only a few units available to send to the southern Solomons area.  Of these units, the <a href="/wiki/Kawaguchi_Detachment" id="w">35th Infantry Brigade</a> under Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi was at <a href="/wiki/Palau" id="w">Palau</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Aoba_Detachment" id="w">4th (Aoba) Infantry Regiment</a> was in the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippines</a> and the 28th (Ichiki) Infantry Regiment, under the command of <a href="/wiki/Colonel" id="w">Colonel</a> Kiyonao Ichiki, was embarked on transport ships near <a href="/wiki/Guam" id="w">Guam</a>.  The different units began to move towards Guadalcanal immediately, but Ichiki&#39;s regiment, being the closest, arrived first.  The &#34;First Element&#34; of Ichiki&#39;s unit, consisting of about 917 soldiers, landed from destroyers at Taivu Point ({{coord}}), east of the Lunga perimeter, on <a href="/wiki/August_19" id="w">August 19</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, Ichiki&#39;s First Element conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at Alligator Creek on the east side of the Lunga perimeter in the early morning hours of <a href="/wiki/August_21" id="w">August 21</a>.  Ichiki&#39;s assault was defeated with heavy losses for the Japanese attackers in what became known as the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Tenaru" id="w">Battle of the Tenaru</a>.  In total, all but 128 of the original 917 men of the Ichiki Regiment&#39;s First Element were killed in the battle.  The survivors of Ichiki&#39;s force returned to Taivu Point, notified 17th Army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from Rabaul.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

 <a href="/wiki/August_23" id="w">August 23</a>, Kawaguchi&#39;s unit reached Truk and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to Guadalcanal. Because of the damage caused by Allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Eastern_Solomons" id="w">Battle of the Eastern Solomons</a>, the Japanese decided not to deliver Kawaguchi&#39;s troops to Guadalcanal by slow transport ship.  Instead, the ships carrying Kawaguchi&#39;s soldiers were sent to Rabaul.  From there, the Japanese planned to deliver Kawaguchi&#39;s men to Guadalcanal by destroyers, staging through a Japanese naval base in the <a href="/wiki/Shortland_Islands" id="w">Shortland Islands</a>.  The Japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Slot" id="w">The Slot</a>&#34; to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to Allied air attack.  However, delivering the troops in this manner prevented most of the soldiers&#39; heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them.  These high speed destroyer runs to Guadalcanal, which occurred throughout the campaign, were later called the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Express" id="w">Tokyo Express</a>&#34; by Allied forces and &#34;Rat Transportation&#34; by the Japanese.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> The Japanese controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the Allies.  However, any Japanese ship remaining within range of the aircraft at Henderson Field during the daylight hours (about 300 kilometers or 200 miles) was in great danger from damaging air attack.  This &#34;curious tactical situation&#34; would exist for the next several months during the campaign.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Troop_movement" name="Troop_movement"></a><h2>Troop movement</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a>, 600 of Kawaguchi&#39;s troops were loaded onto the destroyers <a href="/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Asagiri" id="w">&#39;&#39;Asagiri&#39;&#39;</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Amagiri" id="w">&#39;&#39;Amagiri&#39;&#39;</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Yugiri" id="w">&#39;&#39;Yugiri&#39;&#39;</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Shirakumo" id="w">&#39;&#39;Shirakumo&#39;&#39;</a>, designated Destroyer Division 20 (DD20).  Because of a shortage of fuel, DD20 could not make the entire round trip to Guadalcanal at high speed in one night.  Instead, DD20 had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a slower, fuel-conserving speed.  At 18:05 that same day, 11 U.S. <a href="/wiki/Dive_bomber" id="w">dive bombers</a> from <a href="/wiki/VMSB-232" id="w">VMSB-232</a> under the command of Lt. Col. Richard Mangrum,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> flew from Henderson Field, located and attacked DD20 about 110 kilometers (70 mi) north of Guadalcanal, sinking <i>Asagiri</i> and heavily damaging <i>Yugiri</i> and <i>Shirakumo</i>.  <i>Amagiri</i> took <i>Shirakumo</i> in tow and the three destroyers returned to the Shortlands without completing their mission.  The attack on DD20 killed 62 of Kawaguchi&#39;s soldiers and 94 members of the destroyers&#39; crews.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

 &#34;Express&#34; runs were more successful.  Between <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a> and <a href="/wiki/September_4" id="w">September 4</a>, various Japanese light <a href="/wiki/Cruiser" id="w">cruisers</a>, destroyers, and <a href="/wiki/Patrol_boat" id="w">patrol boats</a> were able to land almost 5,000 troops at Taivu Point, including all of the 35th Infantry Brigade, one battalion of the <a href="/wiki/Aoba_Detachment" id="w">Aoba Regiment</a>, and the rest of Ichiki&#39;s regiment.  General Kawaguchi, who landed at Taivu Point on the <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a> Express run, was placed in command of all the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  On the night of <a href="/wiki/September_4" id="w">September 4</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">5</a>, as three of the Express destroyers &#8212;<a href="/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Yudachi" id="w">&#39;&#39;Yudachi&#39;&#39;</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Hatsuyuki" id="w">&#39;&#39;Hatsuyuki&#39;&#39;</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Murakumo" id="w">&#39;&#39;Murakumo&#39;&#39;</a> &#8212; prepared to shell Henderson Field after landing their troops, they detected two U.S. ships in the vicinity.  These two ships were the small, old <a href="/wiki/High_speed_transport" id="w">destroyer transports</a> (called &#34;APDs&#34; by the U.S. Marines) <a href="/wiki/USS_Little_(APD-4)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Little&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/USS_Gregory_(APD-3)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Gregory&#39;&#39;</a> that were used to shuttle Allied troops around the Guadalcanal/Tulagi area.  No match for the larger-gunned, more modern Japanese destroyers, the U.S. ships were sunk immediately, with 33 crewmen killed.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In spite of the successes of the destroyer runs, Kawaguchi insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to Guadalcanal by slow barges.  Therefore, a convoy carrying 1,100 of Kawaguchi&#39;s troops and heavy equipment in 61 barges, under the command of <a href="/wiki/Colonel" id="w">Colonel</a> <a href="/wiki/Akinosuka_Oka" id="w">Akinosuka Oka</a>, departed the northern coast of <a href="/wiki/Santa_Isabel" id="w">Santa Isabel</a> Island on <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a>.  On <a href="/wiki/September_4" id="w">September 4</a> and <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">September 5</a>, aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the barge convoy, killing about 90 of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit&#39;s heavy equipment.  Most of the remaining 1,000 troops were able to land near Kamimbo ({{coord}}), west of the Lunga perimeter over the next few days.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>  By <a href="/wiki/September_7" id="w">September 7</a>, Kawaguchi had 5,200 troops at Taivu Point and 1,000 west of the Lunga perimeter.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>  Kawaguchi was confident enough that he could defeat the Allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the 17th Army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to augment his forces.

Edson and Colonel Gerald Thomas, Vandegrift&#39;s operations officer, believed that the Japanese attack would come at a narrow, grassy, 1,000 meter long, coral ridge ({{coord}}) that paralleled the Lunga River and was located just south of Henderson Field.  The unnamed ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield, commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended  at that time.  Edson and Thomas tried to persuade Vandegrift to move forces to defend the ridge, but Vandegrift refused, believing that the Japanese were more likely to attack along the coast.  Finally, Thomas convinced Vandegrift that the ridge was a good location for Edson&#39;s Raiders to &#34;rest&#34; from their actions of the preceding month.  On <a href="/wiki/September_11" id="w">September 11</a>, the 840 men of Edson&#39;s battalion deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kawaguchi&#39;s Center Body of troops <i>was</i> planning to attack the Lunga perimeter at the ridge, which they called &#34;the centipede&#34; because of its shape.  On <a href="/wiki/September_9" id="w">September 9</a>, Kawaguchi&#39;s troops left the coast at Koli Point. Split into four columns, they marched into the jungle towards their predesignated attack points south and southeast of the airfield.  Lack of good maps, at least one faulty compass, and thick, almost impenetrable jungle caused the Japanese columns to proceed slowly and zigzag, costing a lot of time.  At the same time, Oka&#39;s troops approached the Lunga perimeter from the west.  Oka had some intelligence on the Marine defenses, extracted from a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" id="w">U.S. Army</a> pilot captured on <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a>.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the day of <a href="/wiki/September_12" id="w">September 12</a>, Kawaguchi&#39;s troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night&#39;s attacks.  Kawaguchi wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by 14:00 that day.  The Center Body battalions, however, did not reach their assembly areas until after 22:00.  Oka was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west.  Only the Kuma battalion reported that they were in place on time. Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions, Kawaguchi was still confident in his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

The U.S. Marines knew of the approach of the Japanese forces but did not know exactly where or when they would attack.  The ridge around which Edson deployed his men consisted of three distinct hillocks.  At the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was Hill 80 (so named because it rose 80 feet (24 m) above sea level).  Six hundred yards north was Hill 123 (likewise named for its height in feet above sea level, which is 37 m), the dominant feature on the ridge.  The northernmost hillock was unnamed and about 60 feet (18 m) high.  Edson placed the five companies from the Raider battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three Parachute battalion companies on the east side, holding positions in depth from Hill 80 back to Hill 123.  Two of the five Raider companies, &#34;B&#34; and &#34;C&#34;, held a line between the ridge, a small, swampy lagoon, and the Lunga River.  Edson placed his command post on Hill 123.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>At 21:30 on <a href="/wiki/September_12" id="w">September 12</a>, the Japanese cruiser <a href="/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Sendai" id="w">&#39;&#39;Sendai&#39;&#39;</a> and three destroyers shelled the Lunga perimeter for 20 minutes.  Japanese artillery also began shelling the Marine lines but without doing much damage.  At this same time, scattered groups of Kawaguchi&#39;s troops began skirmishing with Marines around the ridge.  Kawaguchi&#39;s 1st Battalion, led by <a href="/wiki/Major" id="w">Major</a> Yukichi Kukusho, attacked the Raider&#39;s &#34;C&#34; company between the lagoon and the Lunga River, overrunning at least one platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge.  Kukusho&#39;s unit became entangled with troops from Kawaguchi&#39;s 3rd Battalion under <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel" id="w">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Kusunichi Watanabe, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night.  Kawaguchi, who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops&#39; attacks, later complained, &#34;Due to the devilish jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control.  In my whole life I have never felt so disappointed and helpless.&#34;  Twelve U.S. Marines were killed in the night&#39;s action, while Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>  Although both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>At first light on <a href="/wiki/September_13" id="w">September 13</a>, Cactus Air Force aircraft and Marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge, forcing any Japanese still out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle. The Japanese suffered several casualties, including two officers from Watanabe&#39;s battalion.  At 05:50, Kawaguchi decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

 the Japanese to attack again that night, Edson directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge.  After a failed attempt by two Raider companies to retake the ground on the Marine right flank lost to Kokusho the night before, Edson repositioned his forces.  He pulled his front back about 400 yards to a line that stretched 1,800 yards, starting at the Lunga River and crossing the ridge about 150 yards south of Hill 123.  Around and behind Hill 123 he placed five companies.  Any Japanese attackers surmounting Hill 80 would have to advance over 400 yards of open terrain to close with the Marine positions at Hill 123.  With only a few hours to prepare, the Marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications.  Also, the Marines were low on ammunition, with one or two <a href="/wiki/Hand_grenade" id="w">grenades</a> for each Marine.  Vandegrift ordered a reserve force consisting of the <a href="/wiki/2nd_Battalion_5th_Marines" id="w">2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment</a> (2/5) to move into a position just to the rear of Edson&#39;s troops.  In addition, a battery (four guns) of <a href="/wiki/M101_howitzer" id="w">105mm howitzers</a> moved to a location from which it could provide direct fire onto the ridge, and a forward artillery observer was placed with Edson&#39;s front line units.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, Edson stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops, saying, </p>
<dl><dd>&#34;You men have done a great job, and I have just one more thing to ask of you.  Hold out just one more night.  I know we&#39;ve been without sleep a long time.  But we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here.  I have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Edson&#39;s speech &#34;raised the spirits&#34; of the Raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

 the sun set on <a href="/wiki/September_13" id="w">September 13</a>, Kawaguchi faced Edson&#39;s 830 Raiders with 3,000 troops of his brigade, plus an assortment of light artillery.  The Japanese attack began just after nightfall, with Kokusho&#39;s battalion assaulting Raider Company B on the Marine right flank, just to the west of the ridge.  The force of the assault caused Company B to fall back to Hill 123.  Under Marine artillery fire, Kokusho reassembled his men and continued his attack.  Without pausing to try to &#34;roll-up&#34; the other nearby Marine units, whose flanks were now unprotected, Kokusho&#39;s unit surged forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the Lunga River, heading for the airfield.  Kokusho&#39;s men came upon a pile of Marine supplies and rations. Not having eaten adequately for a couple of days, they paused to &#34;gorge themselves&#34; on the <a href="/wiki/C-ration" id="w">&#34;C&#34;</a> and <a href="/wiki/K-ration" id="w">&#34;K&#34; rations</a>.  Kokusho ordered his men to continue the attack. At about 03:00, he led them against the Marine units around the northern portion of the ridge, just short of the airfield. In the heavy fighting that followed, Kokusho and around 100 of his men were killed, ending that attack.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kawaguchi&#39;s 2nd Battalion, under Major Masao Tamura, assembled for their planned assault against Hill 80 from the jungle south of the ridge.  Marine observers spotted Tamura&#39;s preparations and called in artillery fire. At about 22:00 a barrage from twelve 105 mm cannons hit Tamura&#39;s position.  In response, two companies of Tamura&#39;s troops, numbering about 320 men, charged up Hill 80 with fixed <a href="/wiki/Bayonet" id="w">bayonets</a> behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades. Tamura&#39;s attack hit Company B of the Marine Parachute battalion and also Raider Company B, pushing the Parachutists off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the ridgeline.  To protect the exposed Raider Company B, Edson immediately ordered them to pull back onto Hill 123.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, a Japanese company from Watanabe&#39;s battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and Parachute Company C.  Deciding that their positions were now untenable, Parachute Companies B and C climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill 123.  After arriving behind Hill 123, some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield, repeating the word &#34;withdraw&#34; to anyone within earshot.  Other Marines began to follow them.  Just at the moment that it appeared that the Marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a rout, Marine Major <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_D._Bailey" id="w">Kenneth D. Bailey</a> from Edson&#39;s staff appeared and, with &#34;vivid&#34; language, herded the Marines back into defensive positions around Hill 123.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>

 the Marines formed into a horseshoe shaped line around Hill 123, Tamura&#39;s battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill, charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below the east side of the ridge.  Under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one Japanese floatplane, the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura&#39;s men.  Tamura&#39;s troops hoisted a <a href="/wiki/Type_41_75_mm_Mountain_Gun" id="w">75mm &#34;regimental&#34; gun</a> to the top of Hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines.  This gun, which &#34;could have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese,&#34; however, was disabled by a faulty firing pin.  At midnight, during a short lull in the fighting, Edson brought forward Parachute Companies B and C from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank.  Marines from other units, as well as members of Edson&#39;s command staff, including Major Bailey, brought forward ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill 123, who were running critically low.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Japanese hit Edson&#39;s left flank just after the Parachutists took position but were again stopped by Marine rifle, machine-gun, mortar, and grenade fire.  The Marine 105 mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking Japanese.  A captured Japanese soldier later said that his unit was &#34;annihilated&#34; by the Marine artillery fire, from which only 10% of his company survived.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>  By 04:00, after withstanding several more assaults, some of which resulted in hand-to-hand fighting, as well as severe sniper fire from all sides, Edson&#39;s men were joined by troops from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, who helped repulse two more Japanese attacks before dawn.  Throughout the night, as Kawaguchi&#39;s men came close to, but not quite, overrunning the Marine defenses, Edson remained standing about 20 yards behind the Marine firing line on Hill 123, loudly exhorting his troops and directing their defensive efforts.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the heavy fighting, portions of three Japanese companies, including two from Tamura&#39;s and one from Watanabe&#39;s battalions, skirted the Marine defenses on the ridge, while taking heavy losses from Marine gunfire, and reached the edge of &#34;Fighter One,&#34; a secondary runway of Henderson Field.  A counterattack by the Marine <a href="/wiki/1st_Combat_Engineer_Battalion" id="w">engineers</a> stopped one Japanese company&#39;s advances and forced it to retreat.  The other two companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield.  When no reinforcements joined them, both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after daybreak. Most of the rest of Watanabe&#39;s battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the sun rose on <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, pockets of Japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge.  But, with Tamura&#39;s battalion shattered, having lost three-quarters of its officers and men, and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well, Kawaguchi&#39;s assault on the ridge had effectively ended.  About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80, perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123.  At first light, three U.S. Army fighter aircraft from Henderson Field strafed the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them, with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Kuma_and_Oka_attacks" name="Kuma_and_Oka_attacks"></a><h2>Kuma and Oka attacks</h2>
<p>As the battle on the ridge took place, Kawaguchi&#39;s Kuma and Oka units also attacked the Marine defenses on the east and west sides of the Lunga perimeter.  The Kuma battalion, led by Major Takeshi Mizuno, attacked the southeastern sector of the Lunga perimeter, defended by Marines of the <a href="/wiki/3rd_Battalion_1st_Marines" id="w">3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment</a> (3/1).  Mizuno&#39;s attack started around midnight, with one company attacking through Marine artillery fire and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Marine defenders before being thrown back. Mizuno was killed in the attack.  After daybreak, the Marines, believing that the rest of Mizuno&#39;s battalion was still in the area, sent forward six <a href="/wiki/Stuart_tank" id="w">light tanks</a> to sweep the area in front of the Marine lines.  Four Japanese 37 mm anti-tank guns opened fire on the tanks, destroying or disabling three of them.  One other tank tumbled down an embankment into the Tenaru River, drowning the tank&#39;s crew.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup>  At 23:00 on <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, the remnants of the Kuma battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the Marine lines, but they were repulsed.  A final &#34;weak&#34; attack by the Kuma unit on the evening of <a href="/wiki/September_15" id="w">September 15</a> was also defeated.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>Oka&#39;s unit, numbering about 650 men, attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the Lunga perimeter.  At about 04:00 on <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, two Japanese companies attacked positions held by the <a href="/wiki/3rd_Battalion_5th_Marines" id="w">3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment</a> (3/5) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses.  Another Japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned-down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>.  The rest of Oka&#39;s unit failed to find the Marine lines and did not participate in the attack.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>

 At 13:05 on <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, Kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle, where they rested and tended to their wounded all day on <a href="/wiki/September_15" id="w">September 15</a>.  Kawaguchi&#39;s units were then ordered to withdraw west to the <a href="/wiki/Matanikau_River" id="w">Matanikau River</a> valley to join with Oka&#39;s unit, a six-mile march over difficult terrain.  Kawaguchi&#39;s troops began the march on the morning of <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup>  Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded.  As the march progressed, the exhausted and hungry soldiers, who had eaten their last rations on <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, began to discard their heavy equipment and then their rifles.  By the time most of them reached Oka&#39;s positions at Kokumbona five days later, only half still carried their weapons.  The Kuma battalion&#39;s survivors, attempting to follow Kawaguchi&#39;s Center Body forces, became lost and wandered for three weeks in the jungle and almost starved to death before finally reaching Kawaguchi&#39;s camp.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>In total, Kawaguchi&#39;s forces lost about 830 killed in the attack, including 350 in Tamura&#39;s battalion, 200 in Kokusho&#39;s battalion, 120 in Oka&#39;s force, 100 in the Kuma battalion, and 60 killed in Watanabe&#39;s battalion.  A further but unknown number of wounded died during the withdrawal march to the Matanikau.  On and around the ridge, the Marines counted 500 Japanese dead, including 200 on the slopes of Hill 123.  The Marines suffered 80 killed between <a href="/wiki/September_12" id="w">September 12</a> and <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_17" id="w">September 17</a>, Vandegrift sent two companies from the <a href="/wiki/1st_Battalion_1st_Marines" id="w">1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment</a> (1/1) to pursue the retreating Japanese.  The Marines were ambushed by two Japanese companies acting as rear-guards for the withdrawal, and one Marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the Marines retreated.  The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by Vandegrift.  By nightfall, the Japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon, killing 24 Marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving.  On <a href="/wiki/September_20" id="w">September 20</a>, a patrol from Edson&#39;s Raiders encountered stragglers from Kawaguchi&#39;s retreating column and killed 19 of them with called-in artillery fire.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the Japanese regrouped west of the Matanikau, the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses.  On <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, Vandegrift moved another battalion, the <a href="/wiki/3rd_Battalion_2nd_Marines" id="w">3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment</a> (3/2), from Tulagi to Guadalcanal.  On <a href="/wiki/September_18" id="w">September 18</a>, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade (the <a href="/wiki/U.S._7th_Marine_Regiment" id="w">U.S. 7th Marine Regiment</a> augmented by additional support units) to Guadalcanal.  These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift, beginning on <a href="/wiki/September_19" id="w">September 19</a>, to establish an unbroken line of defense completely around the Lunga perimeter.  Vandegrift&#39;s forces&#39; next significant clashes with the Japanese occurred along the <a href="/wiki/Actions_along_the_Matanikau" id="w">Matanikau River</a> from <a href="/wiki/September_23" id="w">September 23</a> through <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a> and between <a href="/wiki/October_6" id="w">October 6</a> and <a href="/wiki/October_9" id="w">October 9</a>.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>

 <a href="/wiki/September_15" id="w">September 15</a>, General Hyakutake at Rabaul learned of Kawaguchi&#39;s defeat, the Imperial Japanese Army&#39;s first defeat involving a unit of this size in the war.  The general forwarded the news to the Imperial General Headquarters in Japan.  In an emergency session, the top Japanese army and navy command staffs concluded that, &#34;Guadalcanal might develop into the decisive battle of the war.&#34;  The results of the battle began to have a telling strategic impact on Japanese operations in other areas of the Pacific.  Hyakutake realized that in order to send sufficient troops and materiel to defeat the Allied forces on Guadalcanal, he could no longer at the same time support the major Japanese offensive currently ongoing on the <a href="/wiki/Kokoda_Track_campaign" id="w">Kokoda Track</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea" id="w">New Guinea</a>.  Hyakutake, with the concurrence of the General Headquarters, ordered his troops on New Guinea, who were within 30 miles (50&#160;km) of their objective of <a href="/wiki/Port_Moresby" id="w">Port Moresby</a>, to withdraw until the Guadalcanal matter was resolved.  The Japanese never were able to restart their drive towards Port Moresby.  Thus, the defeat at Edson&#39;s Ridge not only contributed to Japan&#39;s ultimate defeat in the Guadalcanal campaign, but also to Japan&#39;s ultimate defeat throughout the South Pacific.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>After delivering more forces during the next month, the next major Japanese ground offensive on Guadalcanal, led by Hyakutake, occurred in late October 1942 at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_for_Henderson_Field" id="w">Battle for Henderson Field</a>, but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the Japanese.  Vandegrift later stated that Kawaguchi&#39;s assault on the ridge in September was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded, &#34;we would have been in a pretty bad condition.&#34;<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup>  Historian Richard B. Frank adds: </p>
<dl><dd>&#34;The Japanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in September 1942, on a ridge thrusting up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield, best known ever after as Bloody Ridge.&#34;<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></dd></dl>
