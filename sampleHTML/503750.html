<p><b>The King&#39;s Regiment (Liverpool)</b> was one of the oldest <a href="/wiki/Infantry" id="w">infantry</a> <a href="/wiki/Regiment" id="w">regiments</a> of the <a href="/wiki/British_Army" id="w">British Army</a>, having been formed in 1685 and numbered as the <a href="/wiki/8th_(The_King%26%2339%3Bs)_Regiment_of_Foot" id="w">8th (The King&#39;s) Regiment of Foot</a> in 1751. Unlike most British regiments, which were associated with a <a href="/wiki/County" id="w">county</a>, the King&#39;s was the <a href="/wiki/City" id="w">city</a> regiment of <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" id="w">Liverpool</a>, one of only four regiments affiliated to a city in the British Army <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> After 273 years of continuous existence, the regiment was amalgamated with the Manchesters in 1958. </p>
<p>The King&#39;s notably saw active service in the <a href="/wiki/Second_Boer_War" id="w">Second Boer War</a>, the two <a href="/wiki/World_war" id="w">world wars</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" id="w">Korean War</a>. Nine <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Cross" id="w">Victoria Crosses</a> were awarded to the regiment, the first in 1900 and the last in 1918. An additional two were awarded to <a href="/wiki/Royal_Army_Medical_Corps" id="w">Royal Army Medical Corps</a> officer <a href="/wiki/Noel_Godfrey_Chavasse" id="w">Noel Godfrey Chavasse</a>, who was attached to <a href="/wiki/The_Liverpool_Scottish" id="w">the Liverpool Scottish</a> during the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">First World War</a>.</p>
<p>In peacetime, the regiment&#39;s battalions were based in the United Kingdom and colonies in the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British Empire</a>. Duties varied: riots were suppressed in Belfast, England, and the Middle East; bases were garrisoned in places such as the <a href="/wiki/North-West_Frontier_Province" id="w">North-West Frontier Province</a> and <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" id="w">West Germany</a>; and reviews and parades conducted throughout the regiment&#39;s history.   </p>
<p>The regiment has been referred to variously as <b>L&#39;POOL R</b>, <b>the Liverpools</b>, <b>KLR</b>, and <b>the King&#39;s</b>. Usage of &#34;L&#39;POOL R&#34; and &#34;the Liverpools&#34; was most prevalent from the 1880s to the 1920s.</p>

The <a href="/wiki/Cardwell_reforms" id="w">Cardwell reforms</a> and <a href="/wiki/Childers_reforms" id="w">Childers reforms</a> from the 1860s to the 1880s substantially reorganised the British Army.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Childers reforms principally entailed single-<a href="/wiki/Battalion" id="w">battalion</a> regiments amalgamating to form regiments of multiple battalions. Though the King&#39;s remained unamalgamted, the abolition of the numbering system in favour of city or county affiliation affected its title.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Thus, on <a href="/wiki/1_July" id="w">1 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1881" id="w">1881</a>, the two battalions of the 8th (The King&#39;s) Regiment of Foot became the 1st and 2nd Battalions, <b>The King&#39;s (Liverpool Regiment)</b>. The 8th Foot had been associated with Liverpool since 1873, when the regiment was allocated to the 13th Brigade Depot in Liverpool. Regular regiments gained auxiliary battalions through the integration of the <a href="/wiki/Militia" id="w">militia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Volunteer_Army_(British)" id="w">volunteers</a>. Nine militia and volunteer battalions from <a href="/wiki/Lancashire" id="w">Lancashire</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Isle_of_Man" id="w">Isle of Man</a> transferred to the King&#39;s, and ultimately became part of the Special Reserve and <a href="/wiki/Territorial_Army" id="w">Territorial Force</a>. Individual distinctions were retained by these battalions, such as unique titles, <a href="/wiki/Cap_badge" id="w">cap badges</a>, <a href="/wiki/Military_uniform" id="w">uniforms</a>, and honorary colonels. Of these, the most overtly individual were the <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Rifles" id="w">Liverpool Rifles</a> (6th Btn), <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Irish" id="w">Liverpool Irish</a> (8th Btn), and <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Scottish" id="w">Liverpool Scottish</a> (10th Btn).</p>
<p>Under the new system, it was envisaged that one regular battalion would be based in the United Kingdom and one overseas.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The 1st Battalion had been located in <a href="/wiki/North_West_England" id="w">North West England</a> since the late 1870s. While based in Salford Barracks, Manchester, the battalion was subject to a bomb attack by the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Republican_Brotherhood" id="w">Irish Republican Brotherhood</a> (&#34;Fenians&#34;). The barracks sustained minor structural damage as a result of the explosion, which killed a child and badly wounded its mother.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Civil disorder during a minesworkers&#39; strike required the intervention of the battalion to quell the riots that had broken out. In 1882, the battalion was posted to <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a>, based in <a href="/wiki/The_Curragh" id="w">the Curragh</a>. Though the posting was uneventful overalll, the battalion was employed after sectarian riots broke out in <a href="/wiki/Belfast" id="w">Belfast</a> following the introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Government_Bill_1886" id="w">1886 Home Rule Bill</a> in the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons" id="w">British Parliament</a>.

<p>The 2nd King&#39;s overseas service in the 1880s was punctuated by the <a href="/wiki/Third_Burmese_War" id="w">Third Burmese War</a>, which began in 1885. It had been based on the <a href="/wiki/Indian_subcontinent" id="w">Indian subcontinent</a> since 1877 and had fought in the <a href="/wiki/Second_Afghan_War" id="w">Second Afghan War</a>. Invasion of <a href="/wiki/Upper_Burma" id="w">Upper Burma</a> began in October in the form of the Burma Field Force. Making swift progress up the <a href="/wiki/Ayeyarwady_River" id="w">Irrawaddy River</a>, the force captured frontier forts and the capital <a href="/wiki/Myingyan" id="w">Myingyan</a>. Following the capital&#39;s capture, the battalion provided an escort that oversaw the exile of <a href="/wiki/Thibaw_Min" id="w">King Thibaw</a>. A seven-year <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare" id="w">guerilla</a> campaign against the British followed the completion of Upper Burma&#39;s annexation on <a href="/wiki/1_January" id="w">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1886" id="w">1886</a>. The 2nd King&#39;s operated in small groups against the guerillas in the Burmese jungle for over a year. Casualties numbered 12 officers and 256 men by the time the battalion returned to India. The battalion was subsequently posted to <a href="/wiki/Aden" id="w">Aden</a> for a year before returning to Britain in 1892. Overseas service for the 1st King&#39;s included a two-year stay in <a href="/wiki/Nova_Scotia" id="w">Nova Scotia</a>, becoming the last battalion of the regiment to garrison Canada. The battalion was posted to the <a href="/wiki/West_Indies" id="w">West Indies</a> in 1895, then <a href="/wiki/Natal_Colony" id="w">Natal Colony</a> in 1897. The <a href="/wiki/Second_Boer_War" id="w">Second Boer War</a> began two-years later.</p>
<p>Prior to the outbreak of the war, as relations between the British and <a href="/wiki/Boer_Republics" id="w">Boer republics</a> deteriorated, the 1st King&#39;s formed a company of <a href="/wiki/Mounted_infantry" id="w">mounted infantry</a> and moved to <a href="/wiki/Ladysmith%2C_KwaZulu-Natal" id="w">Ladysmith</a>, where it underwent intensive training. War was declared on <a href="/wiki/11_October" id="w">11 October</a> and Natal invaded by a Boer force under General <a href="/wiki/Piet_Joubert" id="w">Piet Joubert</a>. General <a href="/wiki/George_Stuart_White" id="w">George White</a> held authority over 13,000 British personnel dispersed throughout Natal.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Heavy losses were incurred by the British in the first major engagements of the war, at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Talana_Hill" id="w">Talana Hill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Elandslaagte" id="w">Elandslaagte</a>. Retreat to Ladysmith ensued, where the largest British contingent was concentrated.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Having besieged <a href="/wiki/Kimberley%2C_Northern_Cape" id="w">Kimberley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Mafeking" id="w">Mafikeng</a>, Boers converged upon Ladysmith and positioned artillery pieces on surrounding hills overlooking the town.</p>

Northern positions occupied by Boers were subjected to an attack ordered by General White on <a href="/wiki/30_October" id="w">30 October</a>. White&#39;s plans were described as vague, ambitious, and complicated, the battle was ultimately disastrous and became known to the British as &#34;Mournful Monday&#34;.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Ladysmith Times_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ladysmith Times" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-French_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-French" title="">[10]</a></sup> The 1st King&#39;s were allocated to Colonel Grimwood&#39;s column, which was to advance on and secure Long Hill. In the process of their night march towards their objective, the 1st King&#39;s, Royal Dublin Fusiliers and a number of mounted infantry companies unintentionally separated from Grimwood&#39;s column while following the supporting artillery batteries.<sup id="_ref-Ladysmith Times_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ladysmith Times" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Exposed to fire from Lombard&#39;s Kop and Pepworth Hill, Grimwood&#39;s force became pinned down and required support from Colonel <a href="/wiki/Ian_Standish_Monteith_Hamilton" id="w">Hamiilton&#39;s</a> column and <a href="/wiki/John_French%2C_1st_Earl_of_Ypres" id="w">French&#39;s</a> cavalry.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Amidst rumours of an attack against the town being imminent and lack of progress in the battle, White ordered the column to retreat.<sup id="_ref-French_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-French" title="">[10]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Royal_Field_Artillery" id="w">Royal Field Artillery</a> provided cover during the chaos that followed, later supported by the King&#39;s and elements of the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Light_Horse" id="w">Imperial Light Horse</a>.<sup id="_ref-Ladysmith Times_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ladysmith Times" title="">[9]</a></sup> To the west of Long Hill, at Nicholson&#39;s Nek, almost 1,000 soldiers were taken prisoner by the Boers.  </p>
<p>Ladysmith was enclosed on <a href="/wiki/2_November" id="w">2 November</a>, beginning the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Ladysmith" id="w">118-day siege</a>. The King&#39;s were commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Llewelyn Mellor and assigned to the north-eastern defensive sector under Colonel Knox, a disciplinarian who instituted a programme of fortification development in his area.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Ladysmith Kings_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ladysmith Kings" title="">[14]</a></sup> Construction of the defences occurred mostly at night. Rain, oppressive heat, and cold provided little opportunity for rest.<sup id="_ref-Ladysmith Kings_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ladysmith Kings" title="">[14]</a></sup> An attempt by Boers to penetrate the southern perimeter of Ladysmith was repulsed on <a href="/wiki/6_January" id="w">6 January</a>, during which the King&#39;s mounted infantry contributed to the defence. The scarcity of supplies had become particularly acute by late January. Disease had become rife and the town resorted to consuming the garrison&#39;s horses and mules.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Reinforcements had begun to arrive in November under General <a href="/wiki/Redvers_Buller" id="w">Redvers Buller</a>. The relief of the three besieged garrisons became the general&#39;s priority. He divided his corps and assumed personal command of the Ladysmith expedition.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Three successive defeats in December, termed by the British as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Black_Week" id="w">Black Week</a>&#34;, were followed by further reverses in January and early February. Relief for the beleaguered garrison of Ladysmith arrived on <a href="/wiki/28_February" id="w">28 February</a>. The 1st King&#39;s were subsequently augmented by a company of Volunteers and its mounted infantry incorporated into an MI battalion.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Britain&#39;s prosecution of the war extended into the territory of the <a href="/wiki/Orange_Free_State" id="w">Orange Free State</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_African_Republic" id="w">Transvaal Republic</a>. On <a href="/wiki/21_August" id="w">21 August</a>, at Van Wyk&#39;s Vlei, Sergeant <a href="/wiki/Harry_Hampton" id="w">Hampton</a> and Corporal <a href="/wiki/Henry_James_Knight" id="w">Knight</a> were awarded the Victoria Cross for holding their positions and evacuating wounded Kingsmen of the mounted infantry while under heavy fire. Two-days later, the 1st Battalion was attacked while at the forefront of an advance south of Dalmanutha. Their ammunition almost expended and casualties numerous during the protracted engagement, the King&#39;s were ordered to withdraw.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Casualties were in excess of 70 and Private <a href="/wiki/William_Edward_Heaton" id="w">Heaton</a> was awarded the Victoria Cross.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The nominal annexation of the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republic in May and September respectively did not resolve the war. Instead, the Boer commandos transitioned to <a href="/wiki/Guerilla_warfare" id="w">guerilla warfare</a> and resisted British occupation until 1902. The King&#39;s concentrated in the Eastern Transvaal, where Boers under <a href="/wiki/Louis_Botha" id="w">Botha</a> and Viljoen operated. Detachments were assigned to <a href="/wiki/Armoured_train" id="w">armoured trains</a> and networks of <a href="/wiki/Blockhouse" id="w">blockhouses</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> One such detachment was overwhelmed under controversial circumstance at Helvetia on <a href="/wiki/29_December" id="w">29 December</a>. Situated near the <a href="/wiki/Lydenburg" id="w">Lydenburg</a>-<a href="/wiki/Machadodorp" id="w">Machadodorp</a> railway, Helvetia was principally garrisoned by a contingent of the King&#39;s and contained a 4.7-in gun nicknamed &#34;Lady Roberts&#34;. The nocturnal attack, conducted in fog, yielded considerable success for the Boers; scores of prisoners were taken and the gun captured. Only King&#39;s Kopje withstood the attack.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Major Stapleton Cotton, who ordered the surrender, was sentenced by a general court-martial to be <a href="/wiki/Degradation_Ceremony" id="w">cashiered</a> and dismissed from the army. This decision was considered to be unjust by <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle" id="w">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, who contended that the wounds Major Cotton sustained merited &#34;some revision&#34; of the officer&#39;s sentence.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> 
<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Boer War had provided the first opportunity for the regiment&#39;s volunteer battalions to serve overseas with the regular forces, supplying small detachments and service companies for the 1st King&#39;s and other units. In contrast, the regiment&#39;s militia battalions, numbered the 5th and 6th, were sent to South Africa as intact units late in the war. A monument commemorating the regiment&#39;s service in Afghanistan, Burma, and South Africa was erected in <a href="/wiki/St_John%26%2339%3Bs_Gardens" id="w">St John&#39;s Gardens</a> and unveiled by Field Marshal Sir George White on <a href="/wiki/9_September" id="w">9 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1905" id="w">1905</a>.

<p>A vigorous <a href="/wiki/Recruitment_to_the_British_Army_during_World_War_I" id="w">recruiting campaign</a> involving pre-war personalities such as <a href="/wiki/Horatio_Kitchener%2C_1st_Earl_Kitchener" id="w">Lord Kitchner</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edward_Stanley%2C_17th_Earl_of_Derby" id="w">Lord Derby</a> facilitated the rapid expansion of the British Army. Territorial units formed duplicate battalions from August 1914 to May 1915. To distinguish them from the originals, they were designated as, for instance, the 2/5th and 3/5th Battalions respectively. Second-line territorial battalions had been raised for home service and recruit training duties, but were ultimately dispatched to the Western Front themselves and replaced by the third-line battalions.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Driven by a conviction that the war would not be resolved quickly and seeking an alternative to the Territorial Army, Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener appealed for an initial 100,000 volunteers who would form a <a href="/wiki/Kitchener%26%2339%3Bs_Army" id="w">&#34;New Army&#34;</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> The 17th Earl of Derby proposed forming a battalion of <a href="/wiki/Pals_battalion" id="w">&#34;Pals&#34;</a> for the King&#39;s Regiment, to be recruited from men of the same workplace.

<p>By the end of March 1915, eight battalions of the King&#39;s were serving on the Western Front. The 1st and 1/5th took part in a &#34;holding&#34; attack designed to support the Allied offensive at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Neuve_Chapelle" id="w">Neuve Chapelle</a>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> An ineffectual preliminary bombardment failed to destroy large sections of the <a href="/wiki/Barbed_wire" id="w">barbed wire</a>, impeding the 1st King&#39;s advance.

<p>One month later, on <a href="/wiki/24_April" id="w">24 April</a>, a German offensive began the <a href="/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Ypres" id="w">Second Battle of Ypres</a>. &#34;Second Ypres&#34; was the 4th and <a href="/wiki/The_Liverpool_Rifles" id="w">1/6th</a> King&#39;s first major battle.

After the regiment&#39;s involvement in &#39;Second Ypres&#39; effectively ended, four battalions were engaged in battle at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Festubert" id="w">Festubert</a>, collectively sustaining over 1,200 casualties.

<p>A new British offensive was launched on <a href="/wiki/25_September" id="w">25 September</a> at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Loos" id="w">Loos</a>, to coincide with a French offensive in the <a href="/wiki/Champagne_(province)" id="w">Champagne</a> region.

Strong wind blew the gas backwards, hindering the advance of the 1st King&#39;s and others also contending with uncut barbed wire.

The 17th, 19th, and 20th Pals formed the 89th Brigade, under Brigader F.C. Stanley.

Meeting limited opposition, the Pals completed their objectives with comparatively minimal losses. Grievous losses were, however, incurred by the 18th Battalion when their advance towards the Glatz Redoubt was resisted by heavy machine-gun fire.

<p>The 2nd Battalion continued to serve in India following the Armistice, and in 1919 was called upon for service in the <a href="/wiki/Third_Anglo-Afghan_War" id="w">Third Afghan War</a>. Leading a &#34;Special Column&#34;, the battalion reached the <a href="/wiki/Toba_Kakar_Range" id="w">Toba Plataeu</a>, some 8,000 feet high, but the war was concluded before the battalion could engage Afghan forces.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>Demobilisation followed and the remnants joined the <a href="/wiki/Sudan" id="w">Sudan</a> garrison in 1920, where the battalion was reformed. Postings to <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Guangdong" id="w">Canton</a> occurred in 1922, then a return to India in 1924. and finally <a href="/wiki/Iraq" id="w">Iraq</a> the following year.

<p>Expansion was on a more modest scale to that which occurred during the previous world war. Ten battalions were raised between 1939 and 1940, including the reformed 8th (Irish). Two of these war-raised battalions converted to armour and anti-air roles in 1941; the 11th becoming the 152nd Regiment, RAC, and the 12th transferring the Royal Artillery as the 101 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment. Some 16 battalions and four <a href="/wiki/Artillery_battery" id="w">batteries</a> of the <a href="/wiki/British_Home_Guard" id="w">Home Guard</a> were affiliated with the King&#39;s Regiment. The Lancashire Home Guard performed various duties in Britain supporting the <a href="/wiki/Civil_Defence_Service" id="w">Civil Defence Service</a> and regular army, and served during the <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Blitz" id="w">Liverpool Blitz</a>. </p>
<p>By late-1941, three battalions of the regiment (1st, 2nd, and 13th) were stationed abroad. The remainder were located throughout the United Kingdom, poised to defend against an invasion. The 1st and 13th would serve in <a href="/wiki/Burma_Campaign" id="w">Burma</a> as <a href="/wiki/Chindits" id="w">Chindits</a>, the 2nd in <a href="/wiki/Italian_Campaign_(World_War_II)" id="w">Italy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a>, and the 5th and 8th in <a href="/wiki/Western_Front_(WWII)#1944 - 1945" id="w">North-West Europe</a>.

<p>In 1943, the 5th and 8th King&#39;s (Liverpool Irish) were provided with speciailst training at <a href="/wiki/Ayrshire" id="w">Ayrshire</a> in preparation for a planned <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Normandy" id="w">invasion of France</a>. They were selected to form the nucleus of the 5th and 7th Beach Groups, whose objectives on an invasion beach were to maintain organisation, secure positions, and provide defence against counter-attack. </p>
<p>As invasion neared in mid-1944, the two battalions were moved from their camps to ports in southern England and embarked aboard <a href="/wiki/Troopship" id="w">troopships</a> and <a href="/wiki/Landing_ship_tank" id="w">landing ship tanks</a>. Much of the Liverpool Irish embarked aboard the <i>Ulster Monarch</i>, a passenger ship that had served on the <a href="/wiki/Belfast" id="w">Belfast</a>-Liverpool line before the war.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> After delays, the invasion fleet proceeded to Normandy on <a href="/wiki/5_June" id="w">5 June</a>. Both King&#39;s battalions landed on D-Day, the 5th at <a href="/wiki/Sword_Beach" id="w">Sword</a> with the <a href="/wiki/British_3rd_Infantry_Division" id="w">British 3rd Infantry Division</a> and the Liverpool Irish at <a href="/wiki/Juno_Beach" id="w">Juno</a> with the <a href="/wiki/3rd_Canadian_Infantry_Division" id="w">Canadians</a>. </p>
<p>Two companies of the Liverpool Irish landed in the assault wave with the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Winnipeg_Rifles" id="w">Royal Winnipeg Rifles</a>. Under intense machine gun and mortar fire, the landing of Major Max Morrison&#39;s &#34;A&#34; Company proceeded well, allowing some to establish a command-post upon reaching the sand dunes. In contrast, in &#34;B&#34; Company&#39;s sector, the late arrival of the reconnaissance party and <a href="/wiki/DD_tank" id="w">DD tanks</a> exposed the landing infantry to heavy machine gun fire. The company&#39;s officer commanding, Major O&#39;Brien, and the second-in-comannd were among those wounded. Experiences at Sword Beach were similar. As the 3rd Division moved inland, the 5th King&#39;s attempted to neutralise hostile positions and snipers. Casualties included Lieutenant-Colonel D. H. V. Board, killed by a sniper, and the OC of 9 Platoon, Lieutenant Scarfe, mortally wounded in an attack on a German position.</p>
<p>Under fire, the beach groups collected the wounded and dead, located and marked <a href="/wiki/Minefield" id="w">minefields</a>, attempted to maintain organisation, and directed vehicles and troops inland.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> The two battalions operated with the beach groups for a further six weeks. While the depleted Liverpool Irish was disbanded in August, much of its strength having been transferred to other units as reinforcements, the 5th King&#39;s was reduced to cadre strength. Disbandment was only avoided through the determination of Lieutenant-Colonel G.D. Wreford-Brown, who argued that the 5th Battalion was nearly the most senior unit active in the Territorial Army. <sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the Allies began their advance into Nazi Germany in February 1945, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Expeditionary_Force" id="w">Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force</a> (SHAEF) formed dedicaed units to secure important objectives - equipment, installations, intelligence, and personnel.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> The 5th King&#39;s provided the nucleus for one such <a href="/wiki/T-Force" id="w">T (Target) Force</a>.

At Liverpool, the battalion embarked aboard the troopship <i>Devonshire</i> for <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a>, where it underwent training before landing at <a href="/wiki/Pusan" id="w">Pusan</a>, Korea, in September.

<p>Much of the battalion&#39;s time at the front was quiet, though their night patrols often resulted in clashes with <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">Chinese</a> troops. The battalion was withdrawn to reserve for three months in 1953. A tactically important feature known as <a href="/wiki/Battle_for_the_Hook" id="w">&#34;The Hook&#34;</a>, a crescent shaped ridge, was the scene of intense heavy fighting between Commonwealth forces and the Chinese in May. On the night of <a href="/wiki/20_May" id="w">20 May</a>, Chinese forces commenced a sustained bombardment of the Hook, defended by the <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Wellington%26%2339%3Bs_Regiment" id="w">Duke of Wellington&#39;s Regiment</a>. A company of the King&#39;s was ordered to conduct a nighttime diversionary raid on Chinese positions known as &#34;Pheasant&#34; two-days later. Second-Lieutenant Caws&#39; 5 Platoon, intended to execute the actual attack, inadvertently stumbled upon an unchartered <a href="/wiki/Land_mine" id="w">minefield</a>, suffering 10 wounded from a strength of 16.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> The attack was consequently abandoned, forcing the company to withdraw with its wounded back to British lines.<sup id="_ref-Korea_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Korea" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>

The battle began on <a href="/wiki/28_May" id="w">28 May</a>, when a heavy bombardment targeted positions held by the Dukes at 7:53 pm. The first wave of Chinese troops was launched against the Duke&#39;s positions minutes later, followed by three further waves. Two platoons of the King&#39;s were moved forward to reinforce the Point 121 position, which was then attacked by two companies of Chinese infantry. After the attack was repulsed with the assistance of <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth</a> <a href="/wiki/Artillery" id="w">artillery</a>, the Chinese directed their attention to the King&#39;s on Point 146.

On <a href="/wiki/1_July" id="w">1 July</a> 2006, the successor regiment amalgamated, joining with two others to form the <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Lancaster%26%2339%3Bs_Regiment_(King%26%2339%3Bs%2C_Lancashire_and_Border)" id="w">Duke of Lancaster&#39;s Regiment (King&#39;s, Lancashire and Border)</a>. </p>
<p>The surviving territorial battalion of the King&#39;s (Liverpool), the 5th, retained its identity until reduced to &#34;B&#34; Company, <a href="/wiki/Lancastrian_Volunteers" id="w">Lancastrian Volunteers</a> in 1967. The lineage of 5th King&#39;s has  been perpuated by &#34;A&#34; Company since its formation in 1992.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> The company became an integral component of the 4th Battalion, Duke of Lancaster&#39;s Regiment in 2006. Contained within the company is the Liverpool Scottish Platoon.</p>
