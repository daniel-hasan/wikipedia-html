<a id="Childhood" name="Childhood"></a><h1> Childhood </h1>

<p>Catholicos Baselios Thomas I was born in the Cheruvillil family of Vadayambadi in <a href="/wiki/Puthenkurishu" id="w">Puthenkurishu</a> to Mathai and Kunjamma on July 22, 1929. 
Early part of the life of Mor Baselios Thomas I was full of sufferings. Though he belonged to an aristocratic family, by the time he was born the family had seen bad days. As a child he had frequent bouts of illness which affected his education. His mother used to take the young boy frequently to the nearby Malekurishu Dayro where the relics of late Patriarch St. Elias III had been interred. One night, as his mother prayed with the young boy on her lap, she had a vision which prompted her to dedicate the boy to the service of the church. Within days, the boy&#39;s illness was entirely cured.</p>
<a id="Priesthood" name="Priesthood"></a><h1> Priesthood </h1>

<p>His priestly formation was under the guidance of Mor Philoxenos Paulos (later Catholicos <a href="/wiki/Baselios_Paulose_II" id="w">Baselios Paulose II</a>) who ordained him <a href="/wiki/Korooyo" id="w">korooyo</a> in 1952 and <a href="/wiki/Mshamshono" id="w">mshamshono</a> at Kadamattom Church in 1957. In 1958, he was ordained priest by Mor Yulius Elias Qoro in September 1958 at Manjinikkara. He was the 43rd priest from the Cheruvillil family. Fr. C.M. Thomas served as the vicar of St. Peter&#39;s church, Puthenkurishu from 1959 while also serving churches at Mookkannur, Vellathooval, Keezhumuri, St Peters &#38; St Pauls Orthodox ChurchFort Cochin, Valamboor and later at Calcutta and Trichur. In 1960, while vicar at Puthenkurish, he played a key role in rebuilding the church; parishioners fondly recollect their priest working with them during the reconstruction. From 1967-74, he served as the organizing secretary of Kolenchery Medical Mission Hospital. In 1970, he served as the organizer for the North Indian mission at Bhilai and in 1974 as the secretary of the Pourasthaya Suvishesha Samajam. Since his ordination as korooyo, at age 24, Thomas was active in preaching the gospel in the remote parts of Kerala. From his vision and zeal to spread the gospel arose the St. Paul&#39;s prayer fellowship and the Puthenkurish gospel convention which is held annually from December 26-31.</p>
