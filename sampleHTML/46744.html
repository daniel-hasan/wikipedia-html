<b>Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon</b>, later <b>Queen Elizabeth</b> (Elizabeth Angela Marguerite; <a href="/wiki/4_August" id="w">4 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1900" id="w">1900</a> – <a href="/wiki/30_March" id="w">30 March</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>), was the <a href="/wiki/Queen_Consort" id="w">Queen Consort</a> of King <a href="/wiki/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George VI of the United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Dominion" id="w">Dominions</a> from 1936 until his death in 1952. After her husband&#39;s death, she was known as <i>Queen Elizabeth, The <a href="/wiki/Queen_Mother" id="w">Queen Mother</a></i>, to avoid confusion with her daughter, <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Elizabeth II</a>. Before her husband ascended the throne, from 1923 to 1936 she was known as the <a href="/wiki/Duchess_of_York" id="w">Duchess of York</a>. She was the last <a href="/wiki/King_of_Ireland" id="w">Queen-consort of Ireland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Emperor_of_India" id="w">Empress-consort of India</a>.</p>
<p>Born into a family of <a href="/wiki/Scottish_nobility" id="w">Scottish nobility</a> (her <a href="/wiki/Claude_Bowes-Lyon%2C_14th_Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne" id="w">father</a> inherited the <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne" id="w">Earldom of Strathmore and Kinghorne</a> in 1904), she came to prominence in 1923 when she married Albert, Duke of York, the second son of <a href="/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George V</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mary_of_Teck" id="w">Queen Mary</a>. As Duchess of York, she – along with her husband and their two daughters Elizabeth and <a href="/wiki/Princess_Margaret%2C_Countess_of_Snowdon" id="w">Margaret</a> – embodied traditional ideas of family and public service.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> She undertook a variety of public engagements, and became known as the &#34;Smiling Duchess&#34; because of her consistent public expression.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1936, her husband unexpectedly became King when her brother-in-law, <a href="/wiki/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Edward VIII</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edward_VIII_abdication_crisis" id="w">abdicated</a> in order to marry his mistress, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> divorcée <a href="/wiki/Wallis%2C_Duchess_of_Windsor" id="w">Wallis Simpson</a>. As Queen Consort, Elizabeth accompanied her husband on diplomatic tours to France and North America in the run-up to <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>. During the war, her seemingly indomitable spirit provided moral support to the British public, and in recognition of her role as a <a href="/wiki/Propaganda" id="w">propaganda</a> tool, <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a> described her as &#34;the most dangerous woman in Europe&#34;.<sup id="_ref-churchill_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-churchill" title="">[3]</a></sup> After the war, her husband&#39;s health deteriorated and she was widowed at the age of 51.</p>
<p>With her brother-in-law living abroad and her elder daughter now Queen at the age of 26, when Queen Mary died in 1953 Elizabeth became the senior royal and assumed a position as family matriarch. In her later years, she was a consistently popular member of the <a href="/wiki/British_Royal_Family" id="w">Royal Family</a>, when other members were suffering from low levels of public approval.</p>
<p>Only after the illness and death of her own younger daughter, Princess Margaret, did she appear to grow frail. She died seven weeks after Margaret, at the age of 101. During the year of her death in 2002, she was ranked 61st in the <a href="/wiki/100_Greatest_Britons" id="w">100 Greatest Britons</a> poll.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon 1906</div></p>
<p>Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was the fourth daughter and the ninth of ten children of <a href="/wiki/Claude_George_Bowes-Lyon%2C_14th_Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne" id="w">Claude George Bowes-Lyon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lord_Glamis" id="w">Lord Glamis</a>, (later 14th <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne" id="w">Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne</a>), and his wife, <a href="/wiki/Cecilia_Bowes-Lyon%2C_Countess_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne" id="w">Cecilia Nina Cavendish-Bentinck</a>. Amongst her ancestors were <a href="/wiki/British_Prime_Minister" id="w">British Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/William_Cavendish-Bentinck%2C_3rd_Duke_of_Portland" id="w">William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Wellesley%2C_1st_Marquess_Wellesley" id="w">Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley</a> (Governor-General of India and elder brother of another Prime Minister, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington" id="w">Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington</a>).</p>
<p>The location of her birth remains uncertain, but reputedly she was born either in her parents&#39; <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> home at <a href="/wiki/Belgrave_Mansions" id="w">Belgrave Mansions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grosvenor_Gardens" id="w">Grosvenor Gardens</a>, or in a horse-drawn ambulance on the way to hospital.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Her birth was registered at <a href="/wiki/Hitchin" id="w">Hitchin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hertfordshire" id="w">Hertfordshire</a>,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> near the Strathmores&#39; country house <a href="/wiki/St_Paul%26%2339%3Bs_Walden_Bury" id="w">St Paul&#39;s Walden Bury</a>, and she was christened there on <a href="/wiki/23_September" id="w">23 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1900" id="w">1900</a>, in the local parish church.</p>
<p>She spent much of her childhood at <a href="/wiki/St_Paul%26%2339%3Bs_Walden" id="w">St Paul&#39;s Walden</a> and at <a href="/wiki/Glamis_Castle" id="w">Glamis Castle</a>, the Earl&#39;s ancestral home in <a href="/wiki/Glamis" id="w">Glamis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Angus" id="w">Angus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>. Until the age of 8, she was educated at home by a governess, and was fond of field sports, ponies and dogs.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> When she started school in London, she astonished her teachers by precociously starting an essay with two <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> words from <a href="/wiki/Xenophon" id="w">Xenophon</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Anabasis_(Xenophon)" id="w">Anabasis</a></i>. Her best subjects were literature and scripture.

<p>On her fourteenth birthday, Britain <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">declared war</a> on <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" id="w">Germany</a>. Her elder brother, <a href="/wiki/Fergus_Bowes-Lyon" id="w">Fergus</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Commissioned_officer" id="w">officer</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Black_Watch" id="w">Black Watch</a> Regiment, was killed in action in <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Loos" id="w">Battle of Loos</a> in 1915. Another brother, Michael, was reported missing in action in May 1917. However, he had actually been captured after being wounded and remained in a <a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war" id="w">prisoner of war</a> camp for the rest of the war. Glamis was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers, which Elizabeth helped to run. One of the soldiers she treated wrote in her autograph book that she was to be &#34;Hung, drawn and...quartered...hung in diamonds, drawn in a coach, and...quartered in the best house in the land.&#34;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Prince Albert – &#34;Bertie&#34; to the family – was the second son of <a href="/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George V</a>. He initially proposed to Elizabeth in 1921, but she turned him down, being &#34;afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ezard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ezard" title="">[9]</a></sup> When he declared he would marry no other, his mother, <a href="/wiki/Mary_of_Teck" id="w">Queen Mary</a>, visited Glamis to see for herself the girl who had stolen her son&#39;s heart. She became convinced that Elizabeth was &#34;the one girl who could make Bertie happy&#34;, but nevertheless refused to interfere.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eventually Elizabeth agreed to marry Albert, despite her misgivings about royal life.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The engagement was announced in January 1923. Albert&#39;s freedom in choosing Elizabeth, legally a <a href="/wiki/Commoner" id="w">commoner</a> though the daughter of a peer, was considered a gesture in favour of political modernisation; previously, princes were expected to marry princesses from other royal families.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> They married on <a href="/wiki/26_April" id="w">26 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a>, at <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Abbey" id="w">Westminster Abbey</a>.

She became styled <i><a href="/wiki/HRH" id="w">HRH</a> <a href="/wiki/The_Duchess_of_York" id="w">The Duchess of York</a></i>. They honeymooned at <a href="/wiki/Polesden_Lacey" id="w">Polesden Lacey</a>, a manor house in <a href="/wiki/Surrey" id="w">Surrey</a>, and then went to Scotland.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1926, the couple had their first child, Elizabeth, who would later become <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. Another daughter, <a href="/wiki/Princess_Margaret%2C_Countess_of_Snowdon" id="w">Margaret Rose</a>, was born four years later.

Fifty authors and artists contributed to the book, which was fronted by <a href="/wiki/Cecil_Beaton" id="w">Cecil Beaton</a>&#39;s portrait of the Queen and was sold in aid of the <a href="/wiki/Red_Cross" id="w">Red Cross</a>.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> Elizabeth publicly refused to leave London or send the children to Canada, even during <a href="/wiki/The_Blitz" id="w">the Blitz</a>, when she was advised by <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">the Cabinet</a> to do so and indeed the Canadian government had purchased an <a href="/wiki/Hatley_Castle" id="w">estate</a> outside <a href="/wiki/Victoria%2C_BC" id="w">Victoria, BC</a> for them to occupy.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> She said, &#34;The children won&#39;t go without me.

<p>Sir <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Casson" id="w">Hugh Casson</a> described her vividly as like &#34;a wave breaking on a rock, because although she is sweet and pretty and charming, she also has a basic streak of toughness and tenacity. … when a wave breaks on a rock, it showers and sparkles with a brilliant play of foam and droplets in the sun, yet beneath is really hard, tough rock, fused, in her case, from strong principles, physical courage and a sense of duty.&#34;<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Peter_Ustinov" id="w">Peter Ustinov</a> described her during a student demonstration in 1968, &#34;As we arrived in a solemn procession the students pelted us with toilet rolls. They kept hold of one end, like streamers at a ball, and threw the other end. The Queen Mother stopped and picked these up as though somebody had misplaced them. [Returning them to the students she said,] &#39;Was this yours? Oh, could you take it?&#39; And it was her sang-froid and her absolute refusal to be shocked by this, which immediately silenced all the students. She knows instinctively what to do on those occasions. She doesn&#39;t rise to being heckled at all; she just pretends it must be an oversight on the part of the people doing it. The way she reacted not only showed her presence of mind, but was so charming and so disarming, even to the most rabid element, that she brought peace to troubled waters.&#34;<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>

Among the most serious criticisms of her relates to perceived partiality of the King and Queen in relation to the appeasement debate in the 1930s. Upon Neville Chamberlain&#39;s return from <a href="/wiki/Munich_Agreement" id="w">Munich</a> in 1938, he was invited onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace to receive acclamation from a crowd of well-wishers. Chamberlain&#39;s policy towards Hitler was the subject of opposition in the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons" id="w">House of Commons</a>, which led historian <a href="/wiki/John_Grigg_(writer)" id="w">John Grigg</a> to describe the King&#39;s behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as &#34;the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century&#34;.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> However, historians have also argued that the King only ever followed ministerial advice and acted as he was constitutionally bound to do.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> In 1945, Churchill was invited onto the balcony in a similar gesture.</p>

However, <a href="/wiki/Burke%26%2339%3Bs_Peerage" id="w">Burke&#39;s Peerage</a> had listed the sisters as dead, apparently because their mother, <a href="/wiki/Fenella_Bowes-Lyon" id="w">Fenella</a> (the Queen Mother&#39;s sister-in-law), &#34;was &#39;extremely vague&#39; when it came to filling in forms and might not have completed the paperwork for the family entry correctly&#34;.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> When Nerissa had died the year before, her grave was originally marked with a plastic tag and a serial number.

<p>Elizabeth maintained a serene image throughout her public engagements, except once, during the 1947 Royal Tour of <a href="/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a>, when she rose from the royal carriage to beat an admirer about the head with her umbrella, having mistaken enthusiasm for hostility.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> Being a keen <a href="/wiki/Angling" id="w">angler</a>, she once calmly joked, after being rushed to hospital when a fish bone stuck in her throat at a dinner party, &#34;The salmon have got their own back.&#34;<sup id="_ref-straits_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-straits" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
