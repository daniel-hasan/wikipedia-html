<b>Hurricane Keith</b>, the strongest <a href="/wiki/Hurricane" id="w">hurricane</a> of the <a href="/wiki/2000_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">2000 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, was a Caribbean hurricane that caused great damage across <a href="/wiki/Belize" id="w">Belize</a> and southern <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>.</p>
<p>A tropical wave organized into a tropical depression north-northeast of <a href="/wiki/Cape_Gracias_a_Dios" id="w">Cape Gracias a Dios</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicaragua" id="w">Nicaragua</a>, on <a href="/wiki/September_28" id="w">September 28</a>. Tropical Storm Keith came a day later. The newly upgraded cyclone began to intensify rapidly as it moved west, reaching Category 4 strength in a short amount of time. It weakened slightly after its eyewall passed over <a href="/wiki/Ambergris_Caye" id="w">Ambergris Caye</a> and <a href="/wiki/Caye_Caulker" id="w">Caye Caulker</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belize" id="w">Belize</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_1" id="w">October 1</a>. It spent two days looping off of Belize&#39;s coast. During this time, it weakened dramatically and was only a tropical storm when it made landfall in Belize. It quickly passed over the <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula" id="w">Yucatán Peninsula</a> into the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a>. The warm water strengthened Keith into minimal hurricane at its second landfall just north of <a href="/wiki/Tampico" id="w">Tampico</a>. Dissipation occurred a day later.</p>
<p>Keith is responsible for forty deaths, twelve due to flooding in Nicaragua and fourteen also from flooding in Belize. Monetary damage in Belize is estimated at $280 million (2000 USD, $328 million 2006 USD), and $38 million (2000 USD, $44.5 million 2006 USD) in Mexico.<sup id="_ref-assessed damage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-assessed damage" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Hurricane Keith began as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>. It moved westward across the Atlantic without much development due to upper level shear. When it reached the western <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a>, upper level winds became much more favorable, and the wave developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen on <a href="/wiki/September_28" id="w">September 28</a>, {{convert}} northeast of <a href="/wiki/Nicaragua" id="w">Cape Gracias a Dios, Nicaragua</a>. The newly-formed tropical cyclone drifted northwestward, and became Tropical Storm Keith on the 29{{th}}.<sup id="_ref-tcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Keith interacting with land</div></p>
<p>Conditions became nearly ideal for Keith&#39;s development on <a href="/wiki/September_30" id="w">September 30</a>, with little to no shear, a well developed anticyclone over it, and warm Caribbean water temperatures allowing for the storm to strengthen. Keith became a hurricane on the 30{{th}}, which was followed by rapid intensification to a 140&#160;mph (225&#160;<a href="/wiki/Km/h" id="w">km/h</a>) <a href="/wiki/SSHS" id="w">category four</a> hurricane only 18 hours later. As it neared the <a href="/wiki/Belize" id="w">Belize</a> coast, high pressure blocked further westward progress, leading Keith to execute a small loop just off the coast. Land interaction weakened the hurricane to a strong tropical storm by the time it made its first landfall on <a href="/wiki/October_3" id="w">October 3</a>. Keith became disorganized over the <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n" id="w">Yucatán</a>, but reintensified when it reached the Gulf of Mexico on <a href="/wiki/October_4" id="w">October 4</a>. The storm was able to intensify to a {{convert}} hurricane before making its final landfall near <a href="/wiki/Tampico%2C_Mexico" id="w">Tampico, Mexico</a> on the 5{{th}}. Keith dissipated over northeastern <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a> the next day.</p>

<p>Keith was a very difficult hurricane to forecast. Its strength extremes and its stalling offshore Belize caused many problems to forecasters. This led to a deadly situation of waiting for the storm to finally recede.</p>
<p>Keith caused massive flooding over Belize and Mexico, as well as road destruction and landslides. The storm caused 40 direct deaths and an unknown amount of indirect deaths.</p>
<a id="Belize" name="Belize"></a><h3>Belize</h3>
<p>While Keith was offshore Belize, it actually caused a negative surge, draining water out of various waterways. Several places were said to have a water level {{convert}} below average. The only actual storm surge was reported in <a href="/wiki/Caye_Caulker" id="w">Caye Caulker</a>, at only 4-5 feet. The <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> also received reports of the water in the <a href="/wiki/Bay_of_Chetumal" id="w">Bay of Chetumal</a> was temporarily blown out of the bay by northerly winds from Keith.

<p><a href="/wiki/Belize_City" id="w">Belize City</a> was buried under four feet of water and lost water supply and electricity.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Nuevo_Le%C3%B3n" id="w">Nuevo León</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Monterrey" id="w">Monterrey</a>, Keith caused torrential rainfall, with the average precipitation on the state being 120&#160;mm (5&#160;in), causing mudslides on several cities, including San Pedro, Guadalupe and Escobedo. The swift currents, caused by the <a href="/wiki/Flash_flood" id="w">flash flood</a> after the storm, rose up to 250&#160;m³/s (9000&#160;ft³/s), and dragged 130 people into local rivers; however, all were rescued, and none of them were killed. The rivers also dragged 30 vehicles, all of which were moderate to total losses. The storm runoff caused the El Cuchillo dam to receive 130&#160;million m³ (105,000&#160;<a href="/wiki/Acre-feet" id="w">acre-feet</a>) of water daily, and the La Boca dam to receive 1&#160;million m³ (810&#160;acre-feet) per hour. 13,000&#160;residents also lost power.<sup id="_ref-CENAPRED_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CENAPRED" title="">[5]</a></sup> The total damages in the state rose to $115.6 million (2000 <a href="/wiki/Mexican_peso" id="w">MXN</a>, 12.2 million 2000 <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">USD</a>), with the damage to urban infrastructure being the most expensive portion of the damage, with $44.2 million (2000 MXN, $4.6 million 2000 USD) used to repair damage in eight municipalities; in particular, <a href="/wiki/San_Pedro_Garza_Garc%C3%ADa" id="w">San Pedro Garza García</a> received approximately three quarters of the infrastructure damage, with $30.8 million (2000 MXN, $3.3 million 2000 USD).

<p>In other states, damage was lighter, but still significant. In <a href="/wiki/Sonora" id="w">Sonora</a>, total damages rose to $64.4 million (2000 MXN, $6.8 million 2000 USD); in <a href="/wiki/Quintana_Roo" id="w">Quintana Roo</a>, $42.2 million (2000 MXN, $4.5 million 2000 USD) were incurred, and in <a href="/wiki/Chiapas" id="w">Chiapas</a>, $25.6 million (2000 MXN, $2.7 million 2000 USD) of property damage were caused by the storm.
