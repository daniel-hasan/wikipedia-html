{{Infobox Planet}}
<b>Jupiter</b> ({{pronEng}}) is the fifth <a href="/wiki/Planet" id="w">planet</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Sun" id="w">Sun</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Solar_system_by_size" id="w">largest</a> planet within the <a href="/wiki/Solar_system" id="w">solar system</a>. It is two and a half times as massive as all of the other planets in our solar system combined. Jupiter, along with <a href="/wiki/Saturn" id="w">Saturn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uranus" id="w">Uranus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neptune" id="w">Neptune</a>, is classified as a <a href="/wiki/Gas_giant" id="w">gas giant</a>. Together, these four planets are sometimes referred to as the <b><a href="/wiki/Jovian_planet" id="w">Jovian planets</a></b>, where <i>Jovian</i> is the <a href="/wiki/Adjective" id="w">adjectival</a> form of Jupiter.</p>
<p>The planet was known by <a href="/wiki/Astronomer" id="w">astronomers</a> of ancient times and was associated with the mythology and religious beliefs of many cultures. The <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Romans</a> named the planet after the <a href="/wiki/Roman_mythology" id="w">Roman god</a> <a href="/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology)" id="w">Jupiter</a> (also called Jove).<sup id="_ref-etymologyonline_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-etymologyonline" title="">[1]</a></sup> When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an <a href="/wiki/Apparent_magnitude" id="w">apparent magnitude</a> of &#8722;2.8, making it the third brightest object in the night sky after the moon and Venus. (However, at certain points in its orbit, <a href="/wiki/Mars" id="w">Mars</a> can briefly exceed Jupiter&#39;s brightness.)</p>
<p>The planet Jupiter is primarily composed of <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" id="w">hydrogen</a> with a small proportion of <a href="/wiki/Helium" id="w">helium</a>; it may also have a rocky core of heavier elements under high pressure. Because of its rapid rotation, Jupiter&#39;s shape is that of an <a href="/wiki/Oblate_spheroid" id="w">oblate spheroid</a> (it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the <a href="/wiki/Great_Red_Spot" id="w">Great Red Spot</a>, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the seventeenth century. Surrounding the planet is a faint <a href="/wiki/Planetary_ring" id="w">planetary ring</a> system and a powerful <a href="/wiki/Magnetosphere" id="w">magnetosphere</a>. There are also at least 63 moons, including the four large moons called the <a href="/wiki/Galilean_moons" id="w">Galilean moons</a> that were first discovered by <a href="/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" id="w">Galileo Galilei</a> in 1610. <a href="/wiki/Ganymede_(moon)" id="w">Ganymede</a>, the largest of these moons, has a diameter greater than that of the planet <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(planet)" id="w">Mercury</a>.</p>
<p>Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecrafts, most notably during the early <a href="/wiki/Pioneer_program" id="w">Pioneer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Voyager_program" id="w">Voyager</a> fly-by missions and later by the <a href="/wiki/Galileo_(spacecraft)" id="w">Galileo orbiter</a>. The latest probe to visit Jupiter was the Pluto-bound <a href="/wiki/New_Horizons" id="w">New Horizons</a> spacecraft in late February 2007. The probe <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_slingshot" id="w">used</a> the gravity from Jupiter to increase its speed and adjust its trajectory toward Pluto, thereby saving years of travel. Future targets for exploration include the possible ice-covered liquid ocean on the Jovian moon <a href="/wiki/Europa_(moon)" id="w">Europa</a>.</p>
<a id="Structure" name="Structure"></a><h1> Structure </h1>
<p>Jupiter is one of the four <a href="/wiki/Gas_giant" id="w">gas giants</a>; that is, it is not primarily composed of solid matter. It is the largest planet in the Solar System, having a diameter of 142,984&#160;km at its <a href="/wiki/Equator" id="w">equator</a>. Jupiter&#39;s density, 1.326&#160;g/cm³, is the second highest of the gas giant planets, but lower than any of the four <a href="/wiki/Terrestrial_planet" id="w">terrestrial planets</a>. (Of the gas giants, <a href="/wiki/Neptune" id="w">Neptune</a> has the highest density.)</p>
<a id="Composition" name="Composition"></a><h2>Composition</h2>
<p>Jupiter&#39;s upper atmosphere is composed of about 90%&#160;<a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" id="w">hydrogen</a> and 10%&#160;<a href="/wiki/Helium" id="w">helium</a> by number of <a href="/wiki/Atom" id="w">atoms</a>,<sup id="_ref-fact_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fact" title="">[2]</a></sup> or 86%&#160;H<sub>2</sub> and 13%&#160;He by fraction of gas molecules&#8212;see table to the right. Since a helium atom has about four times as much mass as a hydrogen atom, the composition changes when described in terms of the proportion of mass contributed by different atoms. Thus the atmosphere is approximately 75%&#160;hydrogen and 24%&#160;helium by mass, with the remaining 1% of the mass consisting of other elements. The interior contains denser materials such that the distribution is roughly 71%&#160;hydrogen, 24%&#160;helium and 5% other elements by mass. The atmosphere contains trace amounts of <a href="/wiki/Methane" id="w">methane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Water_vapor" id="w">water vapor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" id="w">ammonia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Silicon" id="w">silicon</a>-based compounds. There are also traces of <a href="/wiki/Carbon" id="w">carbon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ethane" id="w">ethane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_sulphide" id="w">hydrogen sulphide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neon" id="w">neon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" id="w">oxygen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phosphine" id="w">phosphine</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sulfur" id="w">sulfur</a>. The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains <a href="/wiki/Crystal" id="w">crystals</a> of frozen ammonia.<sup id="_ref-voyager_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-voyager" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-cassini_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cassini" title="">[4]</a></sup> Through <a href="/wiki/Infrared" id="w">infrared</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" id="w">ultraviolet</a> measurements, trace amounts of <a href="/wiki/Benzene" id="w">benzene</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Hydrocarbon" id="w">hydrocarbons</a> have also been found.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The atmospheric proportions of hydrogen and helium are very close to the theoretical composition of the primordial <a href="/wiki/Solar_nebula" id="w">solar nebula</a>. However, neon in the upper atmosphere only consists of 20 parts per million by mass, which is about a tenth as abundant as in the Sun.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Helium is also depleted, although to a lesser degree. This depletion may be a result of precipitation of these elements into the interior of the planet.<sup id="_ref-galileo_ms_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-galileo_ms" title="">[7]</a></sup> Abundances of heavier inert gases in Jupiter&#39;s atmosphere are about two to three times that of the sun.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="/wiki/Spectroscopy" id="w">spectroscopy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saturn" id="w">Saturn</a> is thought to be similar in composition to Jupiter, but the other gas giants <a href="/wiki/Uranus" id="w">Uranus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neptune" id="w">Neptune</a> have relatively much less hydrogen and helium.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> However, because of the lack of atmospheric entry probes, high quality abundance numbers of the heavier elements are lacking for the outer planets beyond Jupiter.</p>

Jupiter is 2.5 times more <a href="/wiki/Mass" id="w">massive</a> than all the other planets in our solar system combined--this is so massive that its <a href="/wiki/Center_of_mass#Barycenter in astronomy" id="w">barycenter</a> with the Sun actually lies above the Sun&#39;s surface (1.068&#160;<a href="/wiki/Solar_radius" id="w">solar radii</a> from the Sun&#39;s center). Although this planet dwarfs the Earth (with a diameter 11 times as great) it is considerably less dense. Jupiter&#39;s volume is equal to 1,317 Earths, yet is only 318 times as massive.<sup id="_ref-worldbook_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-worldbook" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-burgess_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-burgess" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Theoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had much more mass than it does at present, the planet would shrink. For small changes in mass, the radius would not change appreciably, and above about four Jupiter masses the interior would become so much more compressed under the increased gravitation force that the planet&#39;s volume would actually <i>decrease</i> despite the increasing amount of matter. As a result, Jupiter is thought to have about as large a diameter as a planet of its composition and evolutionary history can achieve. The process of further shrinkage with increasing mass would continue until appreciable <a href="/wiki/Stellar_ignition" id="w">stellar ignition</a> is achieved in high-mass <a href="/wiki/Brown_dwarf" id="w">brown dwarfs</a> around 50 Jupiter masses.<sup id="_ref-tristan286_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tristan286" title="">[11]</a></sup> This has led some astronomers to term it a &#34;failed star&#34;, although it is unclear whether or not the processes involved in the formation of planets like Jupiter are similar to the processes involved in the formation of multiple star systems.</p>
<p>Although Jupiter would need to be about seventy-five times as massive to fuse hydrogen and become a <a href="/wiki/Star" id="w">star</a>, the smallest <a href="/wiki/Red_dwarf" id="w">red dwarf</a> is only about 30% larger in radius than Jupiter.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> In spite of this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun. The amount of heat produced inside the planet is nearly equal to the total solar radiation it receives.<sup id="_ref-elkins-tanton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-elkins-tanton" title="">[14]</a></sup> This additional heat radiation is generated by the <a href="/wiki/Kelvin-Helmholtz_mechanism" id="w">Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism</a> through <a href="/wiki/Adiabatic_process" id="w">adiabatic</a> contraction. This process results in the planet shrinking by about 2&#160;cm each year.<sup id="_ref-guillot04_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guillot04" title="">[15]</a></sup> When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">This cut-away illustrates a model of the interior of Jupiter, with a rocky core overlaid by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen. <i>NASA background image</i></div>
Jupiter is thought to consist of a dense <a href="/wiki/Planetary_core" id="w">core</a> with a mixture of elements, a surrounding layer of liquid <a href="/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen" id="w">metallic hydrogen</a> with some helium, and an outer layer predominantly of <a href="/wiki/Molecular_hydrogen" id="w">molecular hydrogen</a><sup id="_ref-guillot04_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guillot04" title="">[15]</a></sup>.  Beyond this basic outline, there is still considerable uncertainty.  The core is often described as <a href="/wiki/Rock_(geology)" id="w">rocky</a>, but its detailed composition is unknown, as are the properties of materials at the temperatures and pressures of those depths (see below).  The existence of the core is suggested by gravitational measurements<sup id="_ref-guillot04_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guillot04" title="">[15]</a></sup> indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times the Earth&#39;s mass or roughly 3%-15% of the total mass of Jupiter.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-elkins-tanton_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-elkins-tanton" title="">[14]</a></sup>
The presence of the core is also suggested by models of planetary formation involving initial formation of a rocky or icy core that is massive enough to collect its bulk of hydrogen and helium from the <a href="/wiki/Nebular_hypothesis" id="w">protosolar nebula</a>.  The core may in fact be absent, as gravitational measurements aren&#39;t precise enough to rule that possibility out entirely.  Assuming it does exist, it may also be shrinking, as convection currents of hot liquid metallic hydrogen mix with the molten core and carry its contents to higher levels in the planetary interior<sup id="_ref-guillot04_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guillot04" title="">[15]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The core region is surrounded by dense <a href="/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen" id="w">metallic hydrogen</a>, which extends outward to about 78% of the radius of the planet.<sup id="_ref-elkins-tanton_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-elkins-tanton" title="">[14]</a></sup>  Rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through this layer, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere.<sup id="_ref-galileo_ms_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-galileo_ms" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Above the layer of metallic hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of <a href="/wiki/Phase_(matter)" id="w">liquid</a> hydrogen and <a href="/wiki/Gas" id="w">gaseous</a> hydrogen, with the gaseous portion extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000&#160;km.<sup id="_ref-elkins-tanton_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-elkins-tanton" title="">[14]</a></sup> Instead of a clear boundary or surface between these different phases of hydrogen, there is probably a smooth gradation from gas to liquid as one descends.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-lang03_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lang03" title="">[20]</a></sup>
This smooth transition happens whenever the temperature is above the <a href="/wiki/Critical_temperature" id="w">critical temperature</a>, which for hydrogen is only 33&#160;<a href="/wiki/Kelvin" id="w">K</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" id="w">hydrogen</a>).   </p>
<p>The temperature and pressure inside Jupiter increase steadily toward the core. At the <a href="/wiki/Phase_transition" id="w">phase transition</a> region where liquid hydrogen (heated beyond its critical point) becomes metallic, it is believed the temperature is 10,000&#160;K and the pressure is 200&#160;<a href="/wiki/Pascal_(unit)" id="w">GPa</a>. The temperature at the core boundary is estimated to be 36,000&#160;K and the interior pressure is roughly 3,000&#8211;4,500&#160;GPa.<sup id="_ref-elkins-tanton_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-elkins-tanton" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>Jupiter is perpetually covered with clouds composed of <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" id="w">ammonia</a> crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds are located in the <a href="/wiki/Tropopause" id="w">tropopause</a> and are arranged into bands of different <a href="/wiki/Latitude" id="w">latitudes</a>, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued <i>zones</i> and darker <i>belts</i>. The interactions of these conflicting <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation" id="w">circulation</a> patterns cause storms and <a href="/wiki/Turbulence" id="w">turbulence</a>. <a href="/wiki/Wind_speed" id="w">Wind speeds</a> of 100&#160;m/s (360&#160;km/h) are common in zonal jets.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> The zones have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity from year to year, but they have remained sufficiently stable for astronomers to give them identifying designations.<sup id="_ref-burgess_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-burgess" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The cloud layer is only about 50&#160;km deep, and consists of at least two decks of clouds: a thick lower deck and a thin clearer region. There may also be a thin layer of water clouds underlying the ammonia layer, as evidenced by flashes of <a href="/wiki/Lightning" id="w">lightning</a> detected in the atmosphere of Jupiter. (Water is a <a href="/wiki/Polar_molecule" id="w">polar molecule</a> that can carry a charge, so it is capable of creating the charge separation needed to produce lightning.)<sup id="_ref-elkins-tanton_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-elkins-tanton" title="">[14]</a></sup> These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on the Earth.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the interior.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>The orange and brown coloration in the clouds of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when they are exposed to <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" id="w">ultraviolet</a> light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are believed to be phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-elkins-tanton_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-elkins-tanton" title="">[14]</a></sup> These colorful compounds, known as <a href="/wiki/Chromophore" id="w">chromophores</a>, mix with the warmer, lower deck of clouds.

Even before Voyager proved that the feature was a storm, there was strong evidence that the spot could not be associated with any deeper feature on the planet&#39;s surface, as the Spot rotates differentially with respect to the rest of the atmosphere, sometimes faster and sometimes more slowly. During its recorded history it has traveled several times around the planet relative to any possible fixed rotational marker below it.</p>
<p>In 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller in size. This was created when several smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single feature&#8212;these three smaller white ovals were first observed in 1938. The merged feature was named <a href="/wiki/Oval_BA" id="w">Oval BA</a>, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior. It has since increased in intensity and changed color from white to red.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup>

<p>Jupiter has a faint <a href="/wiki/Planetary_ring" id="w">planetary ring</a> system composed of three main segments: an inner <a href="/wiki/Torus" id="w">torus</a> of particles known as the halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer &#34;gossamer&#34; ring.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> These rings appear to be made of dust, rather than ice as is the case for Saturn&#39;s rings.<sup id="_ref-elkins-tanton_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-elkins-tanton" title="">[14]</a></sup> The main ring is probably made of material ejected from the satellites <a href="/wiki/Adrastea_(moon)" id="w">Adrastea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Metis_(moon)" id="w">Metis</a>. Material that would normally fall back to the moon is pulled into Jupiter because of its strong gravitational pull.

Jupiter&#39;s broad <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_field" id="w">magnetic field</a> is 14 times as strong as the Earth&#39;s, ranging from 4.2&#160;<a href="/wiki/Gauss_(unit)" id="w">gauss</a> (0.42 <a href="/wiki/Millitesla" id="w">mT</a>) at the equator to 10&#8211;14 gauss (1.0–1.4 mT) at the poles, making it the strongest in the solar system (with the exception of <a href="/wiki/Sunspot" id="w">sunspots</a>).<sup id="_ref-worldbook_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-worldbook" title="">[9]</a></sup> This field is believed to be generated by <a href="/wiki/Eddy_current" id="w">eddy currents</a>&#8212;swirling movements of conducting materials&#8212;within the metallic hydrogen core. The field traps a sheet of <a href="/wiki/Plasma_(physics)" id="w">ionized particles</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" id="w">solar wind</a>, generating a highly-energetic magnetic field outside the planet&#8212;the <a href="/wiki/Magnetosphere" id="w">magnetosphere</a>. Electrons from this plasma sheet ionize the <a href="/wiki/Torus" id="w">torus</a>-shaped cloud of <a href="/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" id="w">sulfur dioxide</a> generated by the <a href="/wiki/Tectonics" id="w">tectonic</a> activity on the moon Io.

<p>At about 75 Jupiter radii from the planet, the interaction of the magnetosphere with the <a href="/wiki/Solar_wind" id="w">solar wind</a> generates a <a href="/wiki/Bow_shock" id="w">bow shock</a>.

<p>The magnetosphere of Jupiter is responsible for intense episodes of <a href="/wiki/Radio" id="w">radio</a> emission from the planet&#39;s polar regions. Volcanic activity on the Jovian moon <a href="/wiki/Io_(moon)" id="w">Io</a> (see below) injects gas into Jupiter&#39;s magnetosphere, producing a torus of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates <a href="/wiki/Alfven_wave" id="w">Alfven waves</a> that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a <a href="/wiki/Cyclotron" id="w">cyclotron</a> <a href="/wiki/Astrophysical_maser" id="w">maser mechanism</a>, and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface. When the Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Orbit_and_rotation" name="Orbit_and_rotation"></a><h1>Orbit and rotation</h1>
<p>The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 million&#160;km (about 5.2 times the average distance from the Earth to the Sun, or 5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86&#160;years. The elliptical orbit of Jupiter is inclined 1.31° compared to the Earth. Because of an <a href="/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity" id="w">eccentricity</a> of 0.048, the distance from Jupiter and the
Sun varies by 75 million&#160;km between <a href="/wiki/Perihelion" id="w">perihelion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aphelion" id="w">aphelion</a>, or the nearest and most distant points of the planet along the orbital path respectively.</p>
<p>The axial tilt of Jupiter is relatively small: only 3.13°. As a result this planet does not experience significant <a href="/wiki/Season" id="w">seasonal</a> changes, in contrast to Earth and Mars for example.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jupiter&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Rotation" id="w">rotation</a> is the solar system&#39;s fastest, completing a rotation on its <a href="/wiki/Coordinate_axis" id="w">axis</a> in slightly less than ten hours; this creates an <a href="/wiki/Equatorial_bulge" id="w">equatorial bulge</a> easily seen through an Earth-based amateur <a href="/wiki/Telescope" id="w">telescope</a>. This rotation requires a <a href="/wiki/Centripetal_acceleration" id="w">centripetal acceleration</a> at the equator of about 1.67&#160;m/s², compared to the equatorial surface gravity of 24.79&#160;m/s²; thus the net acceleration felt at the equatorial surface is only about 23.12&#160;m/s². The planet is shaped as an <a href="/wiki/Oblate" id="w">oblate</a> spheroid, meaning that the <a href="/wiki/Diameter" id="w">diameter</a> across its <a href="/wiki/Equator" id="w">equator</a> is longer than the diameter measured between its <a href="/wiki/Geographic_pole" id="w">poles</a>.

<p>Because Jupiter is not a solid body, its upper atmosphere undergoes <a href="/wiki/Differential_rotation" id="w">differential rotation</a>. The rotation of Jupiter&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Polar_region" id="w">polar</a> atmosphere is about 5&#160;minutes longer than that of the <a href="/wiki/Equator" id="w">equatorial</a> atmosphere; three &#34;systems&#34; are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10°&#160;N to 10°&#160;S; its period is the planet&#39;s shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by <a href="/wiki/Radio_astronomy" id="w">radio astronomers</a>, and corresponds to the rotation of the planet&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Magnetosphere" id="w">magnetosphere</a>; its period is Jupiter&#39;s &#34;official&#34; rotation.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>

<p>Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a duration called the <a href="/wiki/Synodic_period" id="w">synodic period</a>. As it does so, Jupiter appears to undergo <a href="/wiki/Retrograde_and_direct_motion" id="w">retrograde motion</a> with respect to the background stars. That is, for a period of time Jupiter seems to move backward in the night sky, performing a looping motion.</p>
<p>Jupiter&#39;s 12-year orbital period corresponds to the dozen <a href="/wiki/Constellation" id="w">constellations</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Zodiac" id="w">zodiac</a>.<sup id="_ref-burgess_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-burgess" title="">[10]</a></sup> As a result, each time Jupiter reaches opposition it has advanced eastward by about the width of a zodiac constellation. The orbital period of Jupiter is also about two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a 5:2 <a href="/wiki/Orbital_resonance" id="w">orbital resonance</a> between the two largest planets in the Solar System.</p>
<p>Because the orbit of Jupiter is outside the Earth&#39;s, the <a href="/wiki/Phase_angle_(astronomy)" id="w">phase angle</a> of Jupiter as viewed from the Earth never exceeds 11.5°, and is almost always close to zero. That is, the planet always appears nearly fully illuminated when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of
the planet were obtained.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

The <a href="/wiki/Great_Red_Spot" id="w">Great Red Spot</a>, a prominent oval-shaped feature in the southern hemisphere of Jupiter, may have been observed as early as 1664 by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Hooke" id="w">Robert Hooke</a> and in 1665 by <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini" id="w">Giovanni Cassini</a>, although this is disputed.

<p>The Red Spot was reportedly lost from sight on several occasions between 1665 and 1708 before becoming quite conspicuous in 1878. It was recorded as fading again in 1883 and at the start of the twentieth century.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>Both <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Alfonso_Borelli" id="w">Giovanni Borelli</a> and Cassini made careful tables of the motions of the Jovian moons, allowing predictions of the times when the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, however, it was observed that when Jupiter was on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth, these events would occur about 17&#160;minutes later than expected. <a href="/wiki/Ole_R%C3%B8mer" id="w">Ole Rømer</a> deduced that sight is not instantaneous (a finding that Cassini had earlier rejected<sup id="_ref-cassini_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cassini" title="">[4]</a></sup>), and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the <a href="/wiki/Speed_of_light" id="w">speed of light</a>.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>

<p>Beginning in 1973, several spacecraft have performed planetary fly-by maneuvers that brought them within observation range of Jupiter. The <i>Pioneer</i> missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter&#39;s atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields in the vicinity of the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Occultations of the radio signals by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter&#39;s diameter and the amount of polar flattening.<sup id="_ref-burgess_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-burgess" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-cosmology 101_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cosmology 101" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>Six years later, the <i>Voyager</i> missions vastly improved the understanding of the <a href="/wiki/Galilean_moon" id="w">Galilean moons</a> and discovered Jupiter&#39;s rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the <i>Pioneer</i> missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io&#39;s orbital path, and volcanoes were found on the moon&#39;s surface, some in the process of erupting. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.<sup id="_ref-burgess_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-burgess" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-voyager_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-voyager" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The next mission to encounter Jupiter, the <i>Ulysses</i> solar probe, performed a fly-by maneuver in order to attain a polar orbit around the Sun. During this pass the spacecraft conducted studies on Jupiter&#39;s magnetosphere. However, since <i>Ulysses</i> has no cameras, no images were taken. A second fly-by six years later was at a much greater distance.<sup id="_ref-ulysses_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ulysses" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2000, the <i>Cassini</i> probe, <i>en route</i> to <a href="/wiki/Saturn" id="w">Saturn</a>, flew by Jupiter and provided some of the highest-resolution images ever made of the planet. On <a href="/wiki/December_19" id="w">December 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a>, the spacecraft captured an image of the moon <a href="/wiki/Himalia_(moon)" id="w">Himalia</a>, but the resolution was too low to show surface details.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>

<p>So far the only spacecraft to orbit Jupiter is the <i><a href="/wiki/Galileo_spacecraft" id="w">Galileo</a></i> orbiter, which went into orbit around Jupiter on <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a>. It orbited the planet for over seven years, conducting multiple flybys of all of the Galilean moons and <a href="/wiki/Amalthea_(moon)" id="w">Amalthea</a>. The spacecraft also witnessed the impact of <a href="/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker-Levy_9" id="w">Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</a> as it approached Jupiter in 1994, giving a unique vantage point for the event. However, while the information gained about the Jovian system from <i>Galileo</i> was extensive, its originally-designed capacity was limited by the failed deployment of its high-gain radio transmitting antenna.<sup id="_ref-galileo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-galileo" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p>An atmospheric probe was released from the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet&#39;s atmosphere on <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a>. It parachuted through 150&#160;km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6&#160;minutes, before being crushed by the pressure to which it was subjected by that time (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153&#160;°C).<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized.

The orbits of <a href="/wiki/Io_(moon)" id="w">Io</a>, Europa, and Ganymede, some of the largest satellites in the solar system, form a pattern known as a <a href="/wiki/Laplace_resonance" id="w">Laplace resonance</a>; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the <a href="/wiki/Gravity" id="w">gravitational</a> effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes, since each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors at the same point in every orbit it makes. The <a href="/wiki/Tidal_force" id="w">tidal force</a> from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity" id="w">eccentricity</a> of their orbits causes regular flexing of the three moons&#39; shapes, with Jupiter&#39;s gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away.

<p>A basic sub-division is a grouping of the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter&#39;s equator and are believed to have formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of an unknown number of small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are believed to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1953, the <a href="/wiki/Miller-Urey_experiment" id="w">Miller-Urey experiment</a> demonstrated that a combination of lightning and the chemical compounds that existed in the atmosphere of a primordial Earth could form organic compounds (including <a href="/wiki/Amino_acid" id="w">amino acids</a>) that could serve as the building blocks of life.

<p>It is considered highly unlikely that there is any Earth-like <a href="/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" id="w">life</a> on Jupiter, as there is only a small amount of water in the atmosphere and any possible solid surface deep within Jupiter would be under extraordinary pressures. However, in 1976, before the <a href="/wiki/Voyager_program" id="w">Voyager</a> missions, it was hypothesized<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup>
that <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" id="w">ammonia</a>- or <a href="/wiki/Water" id="w">water</a>-based life, such as the so-called <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_beast" id="w">atmospheric beasts</a>, could evolve in Jupiter&#39;s upper atmosphere. This hypothesis is based on the ecology of terrestrial seas which have simple <a href="/wiki/Photosynthesis" id="w">photosynthetic</a> <a href="/wiki/Plankton" id="w">plankton</a> at the top level, <a href="/wiki/Fish" id="w">fish</a> at lower levels feeding on these creatures, and marine <a href="/wiki/Predator" id="w">predators</a> which hunt the fish.</p>

<p>The planet Jupiter has been known since ancient times and is visible to the naked eye in the night sky. To the <a href="/wiki/Babylon" id="w">Babylonians</a>, this object represented their god <a href="/wiki/Marduk" id="w">Marduk</a>.
