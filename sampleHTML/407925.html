<p><b>John David &#34;J.D.&#34; Hayworth Jr.</b> (born <a href="/wiki/July_12" id="w">July 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1958" id="w">1958</a>) is an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> politician who served as a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Republican_Party" id="w">Republican</a> member of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">United States House of Representatives</a> from 1995 until 2007, representing the 5th District of <a href="/wiki/Arizona" id="w">Arizona</a> (<span class="image"><img alt="map" rel="nofollow" src="http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/preview/congdist/az05_109.gif" /></span>). He is married to Mary Hayworth and his 3 children: Nicole (21), Hannah (17), and John Micah (13). He was a television sportscaster and radio journalist before being elected to the House. He currently hosts a radio program on <a href="/wiki/KFYI" id="w">KFYI</a> in <a href="/wiki/Phoenix%2C_AZ" id="w">Phoenix, AZ</a> weekdays from 4-7 pm.</p>
<p>Hayworth conceded to <a href="/wiki/Harry_Mitchell" id="w">Harry Mitchell</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_14" id="w">November 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, despite the fact that early votes, absentee, and provisional ballot counts were still underway. Hayworth himself commented that he did not expect the margins between him and Mitchell to close significantly. Subsequent counts of all ballots have since confirmed Hayworth&#39;s defeat in the election, but most major news media had already projected Hayworth&#39;s defeat on election night.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Early_life%2C_education%2C_and_broadcasting_career" name="Early_life%2C_education%2C_and_broadcasting_career"></a><h1> Early life, education, and broadcasting career </h1>
<p>Hayworth was born in <a href="/wiki/High_Point%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">High Point, North Carolina</a>. His Grandfather, <a href="/wiki/Ray_Hayworth" id="w">Ray Hayworth</a>, was a Major League Baseball catcher from 1926-1945. He received a bachelor&#39;s degree in speech communications and political science from <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_State_University" id="w">North Carolina State University</a> in <a href="/wiki/Raleigh%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Raleigh</a> in 1980.</p>
<p>He was a sportscaster for WFBC-TV (now <a href="/wiki/WYFF-TV" id="w">WYFF-TV</a>), the <a href="/wiki/NBC" id="w">NBC</a> station in <a href="/wiki/Greenville%2C_South_Carolina" id="w">Greenville, South Carolina</a>, from 1981 to 1986. While in Greenville, he was a member of Edwards Road Baptist Church. From 1987 to 1994, he was the sports anchor on the news reports of <a href="/wiki/KSAZ-TV" id="w">KSAZ-TV</a>, which was then the CBS affiliate in Phoenix.</p>
<p>Hayworth married in 1989.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> He and his wife Mary have three children.</p>
<a id="U.S._House_of_Representatives" name="U.S._House_of_Representatives"></a><h1> U.S. House of Representatives </h1>
<p>Hayworth served on the Resources and the Ways and Means committees during his term in the House.</p>
<a id="Campaigns" name="Campaigns"></a><h2> Campaigns </h2>
<p>In 1994, Hayworth defeated incumbent Democrat <a href="/wiki/Karan_English" id="w">Karan English</a>, winning 54% of the vote. Hayworth criticized English&#39;s support for the Clinton budget plan, which Hayworth termed the largest tax increase in history. English had been endorsed in her successful 1992 campaign by the former Arizona Republican icon, <a href="/wiki/Barry_Goldwater" id="w">Barry Goldwater</a> when she ran against Doug Wead but not in 1994 when she ran against Hayworth.</p>
<p>In 1996, Hayworth fired two of his campaign aides for their part in forging his signature to file a campaign affidavit on time. Hayworth said he was unaware of the forgery and was not charged. He won in 1996 with 48 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Steve Owens, a friend of then–Vice President <a href="/wiki/Al_Gore" id="w">Al Gore</a>.</p>
<p>In 1998, Hayworth signed and filed the form in person, with television cameras, campaign volunteers, and the Arizona Secretary of State watching. He again defeated Owens, 52 percent to 45 percent.</p>
<p>His next three elections were not especially close: He won in 2000 against Larry K. Nelson, 60 percent to 37 percent; in 2002, against Craig Columbus, getting 61 percent of the vote; and in 2004, against Elizabeth Rogers, getting 60 percent.</p>
<a id="Speaking_out" name="Speaking_out"></a><h2> Speaking out </h2>
<p>Known for his outspoken nature — he called President Clinton an &#34;unprincipled philandering president&#34; who had &#34;the most corrupt administration in U.S. history&#34; — Hayworth is a frequent guest on conservative TV and talk radio. He sometimes substitutes as host of the nationally syndicated <a href="/wiki/Laura_Ingraham" id="w">Laura Ingraham</a> political commentary show on the <a href="/wiki/Talk_Radio_Network" id="w">Talk Radio Network</a>.</p>
<p>In 1998, Hayworth was voted the second biggest &#34;windbag&#34; in Congress in <i><a href="/wiki/Washingtonian_(magazine)" id="w">Washingtonian</a></i> magazine&#39;s survey of 1,200 congressional staff members of both parties. &#34;I was hoping to get the number one spot&#34;, Hayworth said. &#34;I was last time.&#34;</p>
<p>Hayworth has never shied from controversy. In the same campaign letter in which he criticized Clinton, he said his Democratic opponent was &#34;bankrolled by trial lawyers, radical homosexual rights groups, environmental extremists ... along with almost every other left-wing wacko group you can think of.&#34;</p>
<a id="Political_positions" name="Political_positions"></a><h2> Political positions </h2>
<p>Hayworth was generally known as one of the most conservative members of Congress. He has said he believes border security and interior enforcement of immigration laws are the solutions — not a temporary worker program as proposed by <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">President Bush</a> for illegal <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexican</a> <a href="/wiki/Immigration" id="w">immigrants</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2006, <a href="/wiki/Regnery_Publishing" id="w">Regnery</a> published <i>Whatever It Takes: Illegal Immigration, Border Security, and the War on Terror</i>, a book by Hayworth and his chief of staff, Joseph J. Eule. In the book, Hayworth said that President Bush dances to a tune of big GOP contributors from the agribusiness, meat packing and construction industries who are &#34;addicted&#34; to a steady stream of workers from Mexico and Central America to keep wages down. Hayworth also describes what he considers a misinterpretation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, says that a child of illegals born in the U.S. should not be given U.S. citizenship, and advocates the &#34;Americanization&#34; program <a href="/wiki/Henry_Ford" id="w">Henry Ford</a> advocated in an interview with the New York Times in 1914.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<dl><dd><i>The ever-so-successful process that used to be called &#34;Americanization&#34; was a major movement in the early 1900s … Henry Ford, a leader in this movement, said, &#34;These men of many nations must be taught American ways, the English language, and the right way to live.&#34; Talk like that today and our liberal elites will brand you a cultural imperialist, or worse. But if you ask me, Ford had a better idea.</i></dd></dl><dl><dd>(from <i>Whatever It Takes</i>)</dd></dl>

<a id="Payments_to_Hayworth's_wife" name="Payments_to_Hayworth's_wife"></a><h2>Payments to Hayworth&#39;s wife </h2>
<p>Between 2001 and 2005 inclusive, Hayworth&#39;s wife Mary was paid $20,400 per year by TEAM PAC, Hayworth&#39;s leadership <a href="/wiki/Political_action_committee" id="w">political action committee</a>. In 2002, a spokesman for Hayworth said that his wife handled bookkeeping and many administrative details for the PAC.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hayworth&#39;s wife had been the only employee of TEAM PAC after December 1999. Through the end of 2004, the fund had paid $107,000 for her salary and payroll taxes, or roughly 26% of its $411,000 in revenue. The PAC also paid $70,000 to an outside political consultant and a California bookkeeper, bringing fundraising and administrative expenses 43% of the total revenue.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2002, the <i>Phoenix New Times</i> questioned whether a variety of TEAM PAC expenditures were in fact for personal use of Hayworth and his wife.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Between January 2001 and February 2006, TEAM PAC took in $538,109. Administrative costs for the period were about $165,000, about 30% of contributions during the period, including $102,000 for Hayworth&#39;s wife. As of <a href="/wiki/July_31" id="w">July 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, TEAM PAC had received $92,000 during the 2006 election cycle (<a href="/wiki/January_1" id="w">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> – <a href="/wiki/December_31" id="w">December 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>) and had $15,000 cash on hand.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> It was paying Mary Hayworth $2,076 every month. It was also reporting about ten expenditures per month, with half related to her employment.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Abramoff_and_Indian_tribes" name="Abramoff_and_Indian_tribes"></a><h2> Abramoff and Indian tribes </h2>
<p>{{main}}
In 1997, Hayworth helped stop a proposal to tax Indian casinos, which would have taken $1.9 billion off reservations. In 2002, Hayworth played a key role in preventing a change in the law that allowed Indian tribes to contribute to an unlimited number of federal candidates with an aggregate cap in dollars.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Between 1999 and 2005, Hayworth received $69,000 from convicted lobbyist <a href="/wiki/Jack_Abramoff" id="w">Jack Abramoff</a> and his clients, primarily from Indian tribes. $62,000 of the money went to TEAM PAC.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Hayworth decided to keep the donations. His chief of staff, Joe Eule, said to the <i>Arizona Republic</i>, &#34;The tribes have told us, &#39;We love you. We loved you before we met Jack Abramoff, and we love you after Jack Abramoff, and we think it would be foolish of you to (give back) the money.&#39;&#34;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Hayworth was co-chairman of the Native American Caucus in Congress. Hayworth did give $2,250 representing the total of personal campaign donations from Abramoff to <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" id="w">Hurricane Katrina</a> relief efforts in 2005.</p>
<p>Hayworth had free use of Abramoff&#39;s sports skyboxes for five fund-raisers,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> the first in 1999. In 2004, some months after Abramoff&#39;s millions of dollars of lobbying fees from Indian tribes was first reported in the news, Hayworth paid the <a href="/wiki/Choctaw" id="w">Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Chitimacha" id="w">Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana</a> nearly $13,000 for the use of the skyboxes. Eule did not respond to repeated calls asking for documentation why the tribes should be paid (the box was in Abramoff&#39;s name) and how it was determined that they should receive equal amounts. Federal lobbying records showed that the Chitimachas were not registered as paying clients of Abramoff when four of the events took place.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>Arizona&#39;s Fifth District<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> is comprised mainly of <a href="/wiki/Tempe%2C_Arizona" id="w">Tempe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mesa%2C_Arizona" id="w">Mesa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scottsdale%2C_Arizona" id="w">Scottsdale</a>, western <a href="/wiki/Chandler%2C_Arizona" id="w">Chandler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fountain_Hills%2C_Arizona" id="w">Fountain Hills</a>, suburbs of <a href="/wiki/Phoenix%2C_Arizona" id="w">Phoenix</a>. In 2004, <a href="/wiki/John_Kerry" id="w">John Kerry</a> won 45% of the vote in Hayworth&#39;s district.</p>
<p>Hayworth had considered running for the governor of Arizona in the 2006 elections against incumbent Democrat Janet Napolitano, but in March 2005 he announced that he preferred to stay in Congress. In the Spring of 2005, Napolitano was enjoying a 79% favorable job rating.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On October 27, 2006, after endorsing Hayworth in previous Congressional races, the Arizona Republic newspaper withdrew its support from Hayworth and instead endorsed Harry Mitchell, his opponent.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  Harry Mitchell was a former State Democratic Chair, and also a former mayor of <a href="/wiki/Tempe%2C_Arizona" id="w">Tempe</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> In explaining its shift of endorsement, the paper cited Mitchell&#39;s long record of public service and ability to work collaboratively across partisan divides.  The article placed J.D. Hayworth &#34;among Capitol Hill&#39;s worst offenders&#34; of &#34;extreme partisanship.&#34; Calling Hayworth a &#34;bully&#34;, it described an example of an &#34;overbearing attempt at intimidation&#34; by Hayworth during an interview with the paper&#39;s editorial staff.   It finally suggested that his &#34;bombastic rhetoric and obnoxious behavior&#34; in the conduct of his office was a key factor in the paper&#39;s withdrawal of their support for him. </p>
<p>Several prominent local Republicans also crossed the aisle to endorse Harry Mitchell in the race, including many former GOP elected office holders.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup>  This defection of Republicans had a significant impact on the result of the general election: CD-5, despite having a 60% Republican active registered voter advantage over Democrats (139,057 vs 86,743 in October 2006)<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>, nevertheless voted in favor of the Democrat Mitchell.</p>
<p>On the evening of <a href="/wiki/November_7" id="w">November 7</a>, election day, most major news media declared former state senator <a href="/wiki/Harry_Mitchell" id="w">Harry Mitchell</a> the winner of the Congressional race, as the state poll numbers demonstrated a clear victory, but Hayworth refused to concede while the prospects for victory remained with the significant number of absentee and early-voting ballots to be counted. As the ballots were counted and the results were updated each day, Hayworth never demonstrated the significant gains he anticipated and ending up losing the election by more than 8,000 votes or a 3.4% margin. Hayworth finally conceded on November 14. His reasons for the delay in conceding contrasted with his actions in his 1996 Congressional election when, leading by only 590 votes on Election Night, he &#34;brushed aside suggestions the outcome could change&#34;.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Mitchell did not claim victory until November 22.</p>
<p>During the campaign, Hayworth was dogged by controversial affiliation with corrupt, convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff and over questions of propriety of payments to his wife from Hayworth&#39;s PAC (see above).  In a leaked internal email from the National Republican Congressional Committee, G.O.P. spokesman Carl Forti suggested that Hayworth&#39;s defeat was caused by the &#34;scandal factor&#34;.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>On Monday, April 23, 2007 it was announced on Phoenix radio station <a class="externallink" href="http://www.kfyi.com/cc-common/streaming_new/index.html?refreshed=yes" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.kfyi.com/cc-common/streaming_new/index.html?refreshed=yes">KFYI</a> that Hayworth would begin hosting an afternoon drive time (4–7 PM) radio talk show on the station starting Thursday, April 26, 2007.</p>
