The term <b>Average Joe</b>, <b>Average Jane</b> or <b>Average Joe-Schmoe</b> is used in the United States to refer to the average American.  Today statistics by the United States Department of Commerce provide information regarding the societal attributes of those who may be referred to as being &#34;average&#34;. While some individual attributes are easily identified as being average, such as the median income, other characteristics, such as family arrangements may not be identified as being average. In 2000 for example no single household arrangement constituted more than 30% of total households. Married couples with no children were the most common constituting 28.7% of households. It would nonetheless be inaccurate to state that the average American lives in a childless couple arrangement as 70.3% do not.<sup id="_ref-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships" title="">[1]</a></sup>Other &#34;average&#34; characteristics are easier to identify.

<p>As the United States is a highly diverse nation, it should not be surprising that there is no single prevalent household arrangement. While the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Nuclear_family" id="w">nuclear family</a>&#34; consisting of a married couple with their own children is often seen as the average American family, such households constitute less than a quarter of all households.<sup id="_ref-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Society in Focus_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society in Focus" title="">[5]</a></sup> Married couples without children are currently the plurality constituting 28.7% of households, compared to 24.1% for nuclear families. Another 25.5% of households consisted of single persons residing alone. Recent trends have shown the numbers of nuclear families as well as childless married couples decrease. In 1970, 40.3% of US households consisted of nuclear families with childless couples making up 30.3% of households and 10.6% of households being arranged in &#34;Other family types.&#34; By 2000 the percentage of nuclear families had decreased by 40%, while the number of other family types had increased by 51%. The percentage of single households has also steadily increased. In 1970, only 17% of households consisted of singles. In 2000 that figure had increased by 50% with singles constituting 25.5% of households. The most drastic increase was among the percentage of households made up of single males, which nearly doubled from 5.6% in 1970 to 10.7% in 2000.<sup id="_ref-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships" title="">[1]</a></sup> Today, one can no longer refer to the nuclear family as the average American household, neither can one identify the current plurality of married couples without children as &#34;the average.&#34; Recent statistics indeed indicate that there is no average American family arrangement, but that American society is home to a wide and diverse variety of family arrangements. The one thing the data does indicate is that the average joe most likely does not reside in a nuclear 4-person family.<sup id="_ref-Society in Focus_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society in Focus" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>A statement that can be made, however, is that most Americans will marry at least once in their life time with first marriage most commonly ending in divorce. Today a little over half, 52.3% of US household include a married couple, showing a significant decrease since 1970 when 70.6% of households included a married couple.<sup id="_ref-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships" title="">[1]</a></sup> Current trends indicate that people in the US are marrying later and less often with higher divorce rates. Despite the declining prevalence of marriage more than three quarters of Americans will marry at least once in their life time. The average age for marriage for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to re-marry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages are remarriages. Overall one can conclude that while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most Americans (the Average Joe) will get married and divorced once with a considerable number of American re-marrying at least once.<sup id="_ref-Society in Focus_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society in Focus" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Income_in_the_United_States" id="w">Income in the United States</a> is most commonly measured either by <a href="/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">individual</a> or <a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">household</a>. In 2005 the <a href="/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">median personal income</a>, the amount earned by the Average Joe or Average Jane, is largely determined by who is or who is not included in the statistics. Personal income statistics are given in accordance to a variety of demographic characteristics. The <a href="/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">median income</a> for all 233 million persons over the age of 15 was $28,567.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, median income for total labor force_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, median income for total labor force" title="">[9]</a></sup> By only including those above age 25, the vast majority of students and all working adolescents are excluded. The <a href="/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">median income</a> for the people above the age 25 was $32,140 in 2005. Of those with incomes, over the age of 25, almost three quarters, 73.31%, the median income was clocked at $39,336 in 2005.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, Personal income for all sexes, races in 2005_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, Personal income for all sexes, races in 2005" title="">[6]</a></sup>  This figure excludes those employed part-time, students, working teenagers, retires and the unemployed. Depending on whether or not those working part-time are included, the average American makes between $32,000 and $39,000.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, Personal income for all sexes, races in 2005_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, Personal income for all sexes, races in 2005" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, median income for total labor force_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, median income for total labor force" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2005, 42% of all households and 76% of households in the top quintile had two or more income earners.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, Income quintiles, income earners per household, 2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, Income quintiles, income earners per household, 2006" title="">[10]</a></sup> As a result there was a considerable discrepancy between household and personal income. Recent studies, such as the one conducted by Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren, have shown that the average American household needs two incomes in order to life what is commonly perceived as a middle-class lifestyle.<sup id="_ref-Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middle income can't buy Middle class lifestyle" title="">[11]</a></sup> The median income per household member was clocked at $24,672 in 2005. This means that the average Joe earns roughly $32,000 a year, lives in a household with an income of $46,000 with $24,000 of gross annual income per member.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, Household income, 2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, Household income, 2006" title="">[12]</a></sup> Personal income changes considerably over the life-time of the average American, from $28,000 at age 25 to about $42,000 at the age of 65. Yet, very young and old persons would commonly not be considered to be average Americans.</p>

The US population seems almost equally divided between those who have and those have not attended college. While only a minority of Americans, 27.6%, have graduated college with a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor%26%2339%3Bs_degree_or_higher" id="w">Bachelor&#39;s degree or more</a>, a slight majority, 53%, of Americans had &#34;some college&#34; education.

Most Americans today are white collar salaried employees who work in varied environments, from comfortable offices, retail outlets to hospitals. Roughly one quarter, 23.4%, of Americans were employed in the traditional blue collar fields that require hard physical labor with another 14% employed in the service industry.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003" title="">[7]</a></sup> Office administrators or more colloquial, secretaries, were the largest single occupation in the United States. In 2004 there were 4.1 million secretaries with a median income of $34,970, near the national median of $32,000.<sup id="_ref-US Department of Labor, Office administrators in the US_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Department of Labor, Office administrators in the US" title="">[25]</a></sup> Overall those employed in office administrative and support, service and sales occupations constituted 38.6% of the labor force. Those employed in business and professional as well as professional support occupations (e.g. nurses) made up 38.0% of the labor force. Combined white collar employees including service workers such as restaurant serves and hotel maids constituted 76.6% of the labor force. If service workers are excluded 62.8% were employed in white collar occupations. Educational attainment varied greatly depending on occupational field with 68% of those in the professional and professional support fields having a Bachelor&#39;s degree of higher, compared to only 31.6% of those employed in sales and 11.6% of those in the service sector. Considering the fact that the average American does not have a Bachelor&#39;s degree, he or she is most likely employed in the service, sales, and office support fields with many working in the professional support and business fields as well. Overall the American economy and labor force have changed greatly since the middle of the 20<sup>th.</sup> century with most worker today being employed in office and service occupations.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau report on educational attainment in the United States, 2003" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

According to US Department of Commerce data the vast majority, 67% of housing units in the United States were <a href="/wiki/Homeownership_in_the_United_States" id="w">owner occupied</a>, had 3 or fewer bedrooms with 1 or less occupant per room (including kitchen, dining room, living room, etc...) and were mortgaged.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, Housing Charateristics, 2005_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, Housing Charateristics, 2005" title="">[27]</a></sup> The overwhelming majority, 85%, of all housing units had three or fewer bedrooms while 15% of all housing had 4 or more bedrooms. The plurality of housing units, 40%, had three bedrooms. The vast majority, 67%, of housing units were mortgaged with 52% households spending 25% or less of their <a href="/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States" id="w">annual income</a> on mortgage payments. The <a href="/wiki/Real_estate_pricing" id="w">median value</a> of a housing unit in the US was $167,500 in 2005 with the median mortgage payment being clocked at $1,295. The average size of a household was 2.5 persons with almost all housing units, 97%, having 1 or fewer occupants per room. One should note, however, that the term &#34;room&#34; does not exclusively refer to bedrooms, but includes the kitchen, dining room, family room, bath rooms and any other rooms a house might have. While 85% of American homes had 3 or fewer bedrooms the median number of total rooms per housing units was 5.3 in 2005.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, Housing Charateristics, 2005_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, Housing Charateristics, 2005" title="">[27]</a></sup> Considering these statistics one can conclude that the average American resides in his or her <a href="/wiki/Homeownership_in_the_United_States" id="w">own home</a>, pays roughly $1,000 per month in mortgage payments for a three or less bedroom house with no more than 1 occupant per room.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau, Housing Charateristics, 2005_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-US Census Bureau, Housing Charateristics, 2005" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>US Census Bureau data from 2002 identified a series of housing characteristics for units owner-occupied units inhabited by households with average incomes, ragning from $40,000 to $60,000. The median square footage for homes occupied by middle income households was 1,700 with 52% of such homes having two or more bathrooms. The median value of these homes was $112,000 with the median year of construction being 1970. Middle income households tended to spend roughly 18% of their monthly income on housing. Considering these statistics it is likely that many average Americans reside in 1,700 square foot homes, priced slightly above $100,000 with two or more bathrooms that were built in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<sup id="_ref-The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
