Nick Ward (born March 24, 1985 in Perth, Western Australia, Australia) is an Australian football (soccer) player. He last played as a attacking midfielder for Championship side Q.P.R. before signing for A-League club Melbourne Victory.

Club career
His efforts in the inaugural A-League season of 2005-06 in English football|2005-06 resulted in him becoming the first player to win the A-League's Rising Star Award with Perth Glory, along with also winning the Perth Supporter's Player of the Year, and also the Smokefree WA Coach's Award.;;

Following the end of the first A-League season, Nick Ward had trials with Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City however, much to the annoyance of Football Federation Australia.;;, he joined Q.P.R. in the English Championship prior to the 2006-07 in English football|2006-07 season.

On January 31, 2007, the last day of the transfer window, Ward joined Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton on loan for the remainder of the 2006/07 season. On 17th February, 2007, Ward scored his first goal for the Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Albion in their 2-1 home win over Nottingham Forest. He has since returned to Q.P.R.. 

On 4th December 2007, Ward's contract with Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR was terminated by mutual consent. He joined Melbourne Victory and his contract runs until June 2008.

International career
After his season had concluded with Perth Glory, Ward was selected by Australia in an extended squad for its opening Asian Cup qualifier with Bahrain.;; Ward was named on the bench, but did not get used.

In December 2006 Socceroos manager Graham Arnold believed that Ward (lacking game time under the management of Q.P.R. at the time) should be playing either in the English Premier League or in Europe, where there was better ball delivery and midfield play than in the English Championship. ;; Those comments could be interpreted as a preliminary reason not to select Ward in forthcoming Socceroos friendlies.
