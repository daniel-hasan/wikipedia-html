<p><b>William Thomson Hay</b> (<a href="/wiki/6_December" id="w">6 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1888" id="w">1888</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/18_April" id="w">18 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a>) was an <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> <a href="/wiki/Comedian" id="w">comedian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Actor" id="w">actor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amateur_astronomy" id="w">amateur astronomer</a>. </p>
<a id="Private_life" name="Private_life"></a><h2>Private life</h2>

<p>He was born in <a href="/wiki/Stockton-on-Tees" id="w">Stockton-on-Tees</a>, County Durham, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> to William R. Hay and his wife Elizabeth but moved to Suffolk at an early age.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Aside from his <a href="/wiki/Day_job" id="w">day job</a> as a comedian, Hay was a dedicated and respected amateur <a href="/wiki/Astronomer" id="w">astronomer</a>.  His personal observatory sat in his garden in Mill Hill, the dome very visible from the main Hendon Road.  He became a Fellow of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Astronomical_Society" id="w">Royal Astronomical Society</a> in <a href="/wiki/1932" id="w">1932</a>. He is noted for having discovered a white spot on the planet <a href="/wiki/Saturn_(planet)" id="w">Saturn</a> in <a href="/wiki/1933" id="w">1933</a> <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>; the spot lasted for a few months and then faded.  He also measured the positions of <a href="/wiki/Comet" id="w">comets</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Micrometer_(device)" id="w">micrometer</a> he built himself, and designed and built a <a href="/wiki/Blink_comparator" id="w">blink comparator</a>.  He wrote the book <i>Through My Telescope</i> in <a href="/wiki/1935" id="w">1935</a>. At his death, his telescopes were bequeathed to <a href="/wiki/University_College%2C_London" id="w">University College, London</a>, and are still used for teaching astronomy.</p>
<p>He was also one of Britain&#39;s first private <a href="/wiki/Aviator" id="w">pilots</a> and gave flying lessons to <a href="/wiki/Amy_Johnson" id="w">Amy Johnson</a>.  He was a <a href="/wiki/Polyglot_(person)" id="w">polyglot</a> and before entering the acting profession full time, was an accomplished translator - fluent in <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>, <a href="/wiki/German_Language" id="w">German</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italian_Language" id="w">Italian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norwegian_Language" id="w">Norwegian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Afrikaans" id="w">Afrikaans</a>.</p>
<p>As a favourite trick for his friends, he would write rapidly seeming nonsense on a blackboard, look at it thoughtfully for a minute with a puzzled expression, then turn the blackboard upside down, and there would be a perfectly written statement of some kind. And he could take someone&#39;s dictation, and repeat the trick.</p>
<p>He married Gladys Perkins in 1907 <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> but legally separated on <a href="/wiki/1935-11-18" id="w">1935-11-18</a>. They had two daughters and a son, Gladys Elspeth Hay (b. 1909) <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>, William E. Hay (b. 1913)<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>, Joan A. Hay (b. 1917) <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a> he had a <a href="/wiki/Stroke" id="w">stroke</a> which left him physically crippled. He died at his home in <a href="/wiki/Chelsea%2C_London" id="w">Chelsea</a> after a further stroke in <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a> and is buried in Streatham Park Cemetery, London SW16.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="Film_career" name="Film_career"></a><h2>Film career</h2>

<p>He was trained as an engineer and joined a firm of engineers but at the age of 21 he gave up that profession for acting. He had a relatively brief screen career: by the time he made his first <a href="/wiki/Film" id="w">film</a> he was in his mid-40s and an established <a href="/wiki/Music_hall" id="w">music hall</a> <a href="/wiki/Artist" id="w">artist</a>, and his last role came less than a decade later. But between <a href="/wiki/1934" id="w">1934</a> and <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a> he was a prolific and popular film comedian. He was credited on several films as a writer or co-ordinator, and was arguably the dominant &#34;author&#34; of all the films in which he appeared, in that they were built around his persona and depended on the character and routines he had developed over years on the <a href="/wiki/Stage_(theatre)" id="w">stage</a>.</p>
<p>He worked at the British film studios of <a href="/wiki/Elstree_Studios" id="w">Elstree</a>, then <a href="/wiki/Gainsborough_Pictures" id="w">Gainsborough</a>, then <a href="/wiki/Ealing_Studios" id="w">Ealing</a>; the Gainsborough period was the most consistently successful, particularly when he worked with the team of <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Varnel" id="w">Marcel Varnel</a> (<a href="/wiki/Film_director" id="w">director</a>), <a href="/wiki/Val_Guest" id="w">Val Guest</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marriott_Edgar" id="w">Marriott Edgar</a> (writers), and <a href="/wiki/Moore_Marriott" id="w">Moore Marriott</a> and <a href="/wiki/Graham_Moffatt" id="w">Graham Moffatt</a> (supporting cast) - as on the railway film <i><a href="/wiki/Oh%2C_Mr_Porter!" id="w">Oh, Mr Porter!</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1937" id="w">1937</a>), his most fondly remembered picture with its catchphrase, &#39;The next train&#39;s gone!&#39;, spoken by Marriott as the decrepit old deputy stationmaster. Hay decided to break up the partnership with Moffatt and Marriott and was never quite the same again. He brought in <a href="/wiki/Claude_Hulbert" id="w">Claude Hulbert</a> as his side-kick for <i>The Ghost of St. Michael&#39;s</i> (1941).  <i><a href="/wiki/The_Goose_Steps_Out" id="w">The Goose Steps Out</a></i> for Ealing (1942) was an effective anti-<a href="/wiki/Nazism" id="w">Nazi</a> piece of <a href="/wiki/Slapstick" id="w">slapstick</a>, and, finally, <i><a href="/wiki/My_Learned_Friend" id="w">My Learned Friend</a></i> (1943), again with Hulbert, was a masterpiece of black comedy, which some regard as his best. </p>
<a id="Radio_career" name="Radio_career"></a><h2>Radio career</h2>

<p>The half hour weekly Will Hay Programme began in August 1944, and was broadcast live from the Paris Cinema, which still exists in a basement just off <a href="/wiki/Piccadilly_Circus" id="w">Piccadilly Circus</a>.  There, St. Michael&#39;s schoolmaster Dr. Muffin (referred to by his students as Old Crumpet) barely kept a kind of order from his desk, perched slightly higher from his unruly students, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Hawtrey_(film_actor)" id="w">Charles Hawtrey</a> who played the cheeky Smart (later to go on to the <a href="/wiki/Carry_On_films" id="w">Carry On films</a>), <a href="/wiki/John_Clark_(actor/director)" id="w">John Clark</a>, a child actor who played the annoying swot D&#39;arcy Minor (later to gain fame as <a href="/wiki/Just_William" id="w">Just William</a>), and an air force recruit, Billy Nichols, who on his days off played the really dumb schoolboy, Beckett. The series lasted about four months, and was prematurely cancelled, owing, it was said, to a dispute with the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a> over scripts. But it found a continuing life on the music hall stage, at the top of the bill at London&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Palace_Theatre" id="w">Victoria Palace</a>.</p>
<p>The cast was brought together one last time for an all variety anticipatory celebration at midnight May 4, 1945 for the Royal Family and many military notables at a private function at the <a href="/wiki/Life_Guards" id="w">Life Guards</a> barracks in <a href="/wiki/Windsor%2C_Berkshire" id="w">Windsor</a>, which featured the leading comics of the day. The war in Europe ended just four days later. This may also have been Will Hay&#39;s last performance prior to his illness, and his son Will Hay, Jr. carried on his father&#39;s act for a while.</p>
