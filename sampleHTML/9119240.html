The <b>Bill of Rights</b> are the first ten amendments to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution" id="w">United States Constitution</a>. They were introduced as a series of amendments in 1789 in the <a href="/wiki/1st_Congress" id="w">1st Congress</a> by <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" id="w">James Madison</a>. Ten of the amendments were ratified and became the Bill of Rights in 1791. These amendments limit the powers of the <a href="/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" id="w">federal government</a>, protecting the rights of all citizens, residents and visitors on United States territory. Among the enumerated rights these amendments guarantee are: the <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_speech" id="w">freedoms of speech</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press" id="w">press</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_religion" id="w">religion</a>; the people&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Right_to_keep_and_bear_arms" id="w">right to keep and bear arms</a>; the <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly" id="w">freedom of assembly</a>; the <a href="/wiki/Freedom_to_petition" id="w">freedom to petition</a>; and the rights to be free of unreasonable <a href="/wiki/Search_and_seizure" id="w">search and seizure</a>; <a href="/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment" id="w">cruel and unusual punishment</a>; and compelled <a href="/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">self-incrimination</a>. The Bill of Rights also restricts <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" id="w">Congress</a>&#39; power by prohibiting it from making any law respecting <a href="/wiki/State_religion" id="w">establishment of religion</a> and by prohibiting the federal government from depriving any person of life, <a href="/wiki/Liberty" id="w">liberty</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Property" id="w">property</a> without <a href="/wiki/Due_process" id="w">due process</a> of law. In criminal cases, it requires <a href="/wiki/Indictment" id="w">indictment</a> by <a href="/wiki/Grand_jury" id="w">grand jury</a> for any <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment" id="w">capital</a> or &#34;infamous crime,&#34; guarantees a speedy public <a href="/wiki/Trial_(law)" id="w">trial</a> with an impartial and local <a href="/wiki/Jury_trial" id="w">jury</a>, and prohibits <a href="/wiki/Double_jeopardy" id="w">double jeopardy</a>. In addition, the Bill of Rights states that &#34;the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people,&#34;<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and reserves all powers not granted to the federal government to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_nationality_law" id="w">citizenry</a> or <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">states</a>.</p>
<p>These amendments came into effect on <a href="/wiki/December_15" id="w">December 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1791" id="w">1791</a>, when ratified by three-fourths of the states.  Most were <a href="/wiki/Incorporation_(Bill_of_Rights)" id="w">applied to the states</a> by a series of decisions applying the due process clause of the <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, which was adopted after the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>Initially drafted by <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" id="w">James Madison</a> in 1789, the Bill of Rights was written at a time when ideological conflict between <a href="/wiki/Federalism_(United_States)" id="w">Federalists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anti-Federalism" id="w">anti-Federalists</a>, dating from the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Convention" id="w">Philadelphia Convention</a> in 1787, threatened the Constitution&#39;s ratification. The Bill was influenced by <a href="/wiki/George_Mason" id="w">George Mason</a>&#39;s 1776 <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights" id="w">Virginia Declaration of Rights</a>, the 1689 <a href="/wiki/English_Bill_of_Rights" id="w">English Bill of Rights</a>, works of the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" id="w">Age of Enlightenment</a> pertaining to <a href="/wiki/Natural_rights" id="w">natural rights</a>, and earlier <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_England" id="w">English</a> political documents such as <a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta" id="w">Magna Carta</a> (1215). The Bill was largely a response to the Constitution&#39;s influential opponents, including prominent <a href="/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States" id="w">Founding Fathers</a>, who argued that it failed to protect the basic principles of human <a href="/wiki/Liberty" id="w">liberty</a>.</p>
<p>The Bill of Rights plays a central role in <a href="/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States" id="w">American law</a> and government, and remains a fundamental symbol of the freedoms and <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States" id="w">culture</a> of the nation. One of the original fourteen copies of the Bill of Rights is on public display at the <a href="/wiki/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration" id="w">National Archives</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a></p>
<p>The original document proposed by Congress to the states actually contained twelve &#34;Articles&#34; of proposed amendment. However, only the third through twelfth articles, corresponding to what became the First through Tenth Amendments to the Constitution, were ratified by the required number of states by 1791. The <a href="/wiki/Article_The_First" id="w">first Article</a>, dealing with the number and apportionment of members of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w"> House of Representatives</a>, never became part of the Constitution.  The second Article, limiting the ability of Congress to increase the salaries of its members, was ratified two centuries later as the <a href="/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">27th Amendment</a>. The term &#34;Bill of Rights&#34; has traditionally meant only the ten amendments that became part of the Constitution in 1791, and not the first two, which dealt with Congress itself rather than the rights of the people. That traditional usage has continued even since the ratification of the <a href="/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">27th Amendment</a>.</p>

<p>The idea of adding a bill of rights to the Constitution was originally controversial. <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton" id="w">Alexander Hamilton</a>, in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers" id="w">Federalist</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Federalist_No._84" id="w">No. 84</a>, argued against a &#34;Bill of Rights,&#34; asserting that ratification of the Constitution did not mean the American people were surrendering their rights, and therefore that protections were unnecessary: &#34;Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing, and as they retain every thing, they have no need of particular reservations.&#34; As critics of the Constitution referred to earlier political documents that had protected specific rights, Hamilton argued that the Constitution was inherently different. Unlike previous political arrangements between sovereigns and subjects, in the United States there would be no agent empowered to abridge the people&#39;s rights: </p>
<p /><blockquote>Bills of rights are in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects, abridgments of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince. Such was &#34;<a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta" id="w">Magna Charta</a>&#34;, obtained by the Barons, swords in hand, from <a href="/wiki/John_of_England" id="w">King John</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> </blockquote>

<p>Finally, Hamilton expressed the fear that protecting specific rights might imply that any unmentioned rights would not be protected:  </p><blockquote>I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted.  For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Essentially, Hamilton and other Federalists believed in the British system of <a href="/wiki/Common_law" id="w">common law</a> which did not define or quantify <a href="/wiki/Natural_rights" id="w">natural rights</a>. They believed that adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution would limit their rights to those listed in the Constitution. This is the primary reason the <a href="/wiki/Ninth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">Ninth Amendment</a> was included.</p>

<p>During the debate over the ratification of the Constitution, famous revolutionary figures such as <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Henry" id="w">Patrick Henry</a> came out publicly against the Constitution.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> They argued that the strong national government proposed by the Federalists was a threat to <a href="/wiki/Individual_rights" id="w">individual rights</a> and that the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President</a> would become a king, and objected to the federal court system in the proposed Constitution. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" id="w">Thomas Jefferson</a>, ambassador to <a href="/wiki/Early_Modern_France" id="w">France</a>, described his concern over the lack of a Bill of Rights, among other criticisms. In answer to the argument that a list of rights might be interpreted as being exhaustive, Jefferson wrote to Madison, &#34;Half a loaf is better than no bread. If we cannot secure all our rights, let us secure what we can.&#34;<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The best and most influential of the articles and speeches criticizing the Constitution were gathered by historians into a collection known as the <i><a href="/wiki/Anti-Federalist_papers" id="w">Anti-Federalist papers</a></i>, in allusion to the <i><a href="/wiki/Federalist_Papers" id="w">Federalist Papers</a></i> which had supported the creation of a stronger federal government. One of these, an essay &#34;On the lack of a Bill of Rights,&#34; later called &#34;Antifederalist No. 84,&#34; was written under the pseudonym Brutus, probably by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Yates_(politician)" id="w">Robert Yates</a>. In response to the Federalist view that it was unnecessary to protect the people against powers that the government would not be granted, &#34;Brutus&#34; wrote:
</p><blockquote>
<p>We find they have, in the <a href="/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress" id="w">ninth section of the first article</a> declared, that the writ of <a href="/wiki/Habeas_corpus" id="w">habeas corpus</a> shall not be suspended, unless in cases of rebellion &#8212; that no <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_attainder" id="w">bill of attainder</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Ex_post_facto" id="w">ex post facto</a> law, shall be passed &#8212; that no title of <a href="/wiki/Nobility" id="w">nobility</a> shall be granted by the United States, etc. If every thing which is not given is reserved, what propriety is there in these exceptions? Does this Constitution any where grant the power of suspending the habeas corpus, to make ex post facto laws, pass bills of attainder, or grant titles of nobility? It certainly does not in express terms. The only answer that can be given is, that these are implied in the general powers granted. With equal truth it may be said, that all the powers which the bills of rights guard against the abuse of, are contained or implied in the general ones granted by this Constitution.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Yates continued with an implication directed against the <a href="/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States" id="w">Framers</a>:
</p><blockquote>Ought not a government, vested with such extensive and indefinite authority, to have been restricted by a declaration of rights? It certainly ought. So clear a point is this, that I cannot help suspecting that persons who attempt to persuade people that such reservations were less necessary under this Constitution than under those of the States, are wilfully endeavoring to deceive, and to lead you into an absolute state of vassalage.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></blockquote>

<a href="/wiki/Individualism" id="w">Individualism</a> was the strongest element of opposition; the necessity, or at least the desirability, of a bill of rights was almost universally felt, and the Anti-Federalists were able to play on these feelings in the ratification convention in <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Massachusetts</a>. By this stage, five of the states had ratified the Constitution with relative ease; however, the Massachusetts convention was bitter and contentious:</p>
<p /><blockquote>In Massachusetts, the Constitution ran into serious, organized opposition. Only after two leading Antifederalists, <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Adams" id="w">Adams</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Hancock" id="w">Hancock</a>, negotiated a far-reaching compromise did the convention vote for ratification on February 6, 1788 (187–168). Antifederalists had demanded that the Constitution be amended before they would consider it or that amendments be a condition of ratification; Federalists had retorted that it had to be accepted or rejected as it was. Under the Massachusetts compromise, the delegates recommended amendments to be considered by the new Congress, should the Constitution go into effect.  The Massachusetts compromise determined the fate of the Constitution, as it permitted delegates with doubts to vote for it in the hope that it would be amended.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Four of the next five states to ratify, including <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire" id="w">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>, included similar language in their ratification instruments. They all sent recommendations for amendments with their ratification documents to the new Congress. Since many of these recommendations pertained to safeguarding personal rights, this pressured Congress to add a Bill of Rights after Constitutional ratification. Additionally, <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> refused to ratify the Constitution until progress was made on the issue of the Bill of Rights. Thus, while the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in their quest to prevent the adoption of the Constitution, their efforts were not totally in vain.</p>

After the Constitution was ratified in 1789, the <a href="/wiki/1st_United_States_Congress" id="w">1st United States Congress</a> met in <a href="/wiki/Federal_Hall" id="w">Federal Hall</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>. Most of the delegates agreed that a &#34;bill of rights&#34; was needed and most of them agreed on the rights they believed should be enumerated.</p>
<p>Madison, at the head of the Virginia delegation of the 1st Congress, had opposed a Bill of Rights but hoped to preempt a second <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_meeting)" id="w">Constitutional Convention</a> that might have undone the difficult compromises of 1787: a second convention would open the entire Constitution to reconsideration and could undermine the work he and so many others had done in establishing the structure of the United States Government.</p>
<p>Madison based much of the Bill of Rights on <a href="/wiki/George_Mason" id="w">George Mason</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights" id="w">Virginia Declaration of Rights</a> (1776), which itself had been written with Madison&#39;s input. He carefully considered the state amendment recommendations as well. He looked for recommendations shared by many states to avoid controversy and reduce opposition to the ratification of the future amendments. Additionally, Madison&#39;s work on the Bill of Rights reflected centuries of English law and philosophy, further modified by the principles of the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution" id="w">American Revolution</a>. The English legal tradition included such revolutionary documents as the Magna Carta (1215), protecting the rights of noblemen against the <a href="/wiki/King_of_England" id="w">King of England</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/English_Bill_of_Rights" id="w">English Bill of Rights</a> (1689), establishing the rights of legislators in <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Parliament</a> against the power of the sovereign. Concurrently, English philosopher <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" id="w">John Locke</a> had argued that all men have inalienable <a href="/wiki/Natural_rights" id="w">natural rights</a> and that the purpose of government was to protect <a href="/wiki/Property_rights" id="w">property rights</a>, ideas that became part of the American view of government. Madison, in the United States Bill of Rights, continued in the radical tradition of the American Revolution by further extending and codifying these rights.</p>

 some degree, the Bill of Rights (and the American Revolution) incorporated the ideas of John Locke, who argued in his 1689 work <i><a href="/wiki/Two_Treatises_of_Government" id="w">Two Treatises of Government</a></i> that <a href="/wiki/Civil_society" id="w">civil society</a> was created for the protection of property (<a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> <i>proprius</i>, or that which is one&#39;s own, meaning &#34;life, liberty, and estate&#34;).  Locke also advanced the notion that each individual is free and equal in the <a href="/wiki/State_of_nature" id="w">state of nature</a>.

The Virginia Declaration of Rights, well-known to Madison, had already been a strong influence on the American Revolution (&#34;all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people ...&#34;;<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> also &#34;a majority of the community hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish [the government]&#34;).

<a id="English_Bill_of_Rights" name="English_Bill_of_Rights"></a><h4>English Bill of Rights</h4>
<p>{{main}}
The English Bill of Rights (1689), one of the fundamental documents of English constitutional law, differed substantially in form and intent from the American Bill of Rights, because it was intended to address the rights of citizens as represented by <a href="/wiki/British_Parliament" id="w">Parliament</a> against <a href="/wiki/The_Crown" id="w">the Crown</a>. However, some of its basic tenets are adopted and extended to the general public by the U.S. Bill of Rights, including</p>

<ul>
<li>the right of petition</li>
<li>an independent judiciary (the Sovereign was forbidden to establish his own courts or to act as a judge himself),</li>
<li>freedom from <a href="/wiki/Taxation" id="w">taxation</a> by royal (executive) prerogative, without agreement by Parliament (legislators), </li>
<li>freedom from a peace-time standing army,</li>
<li>freedom [for <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" id="w">Protestants</a>] to bear arms for self-defence,</li>
<li>freedom to elect members of Parliament without interference from the Sovereign,</li>
<li>freedom of speech in Parliament,</li>
<li>freedom from cruel and unusual punishments and excessive <a href="/wiki/Bail" id="w">bail</a>, and </li>
<li>freedom from fines and <a href="/wiki/Forfeiture" id="w">forfeitures</a> without trial.</li></ul>
<a id="Madison's_preemptive_proposal" name="Madison's_preemptive_proposal"></a><h3>Madison&#39;s preemptive proposal</h3>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_8" id="w">June 8</a> <a href="/wiki/1789" id="w">1789</a>, Madison submitted his proposal to Congress. In his speech to Congress on that day, Madison said:</p>
<p /><blockquote>For while we feel all these inducements to go into a revisal of the constitution, we must feel for the constitution itself, and make that revisal a moderate one. I should be unwilling to see a door opened for a re-consideration of the whole structure of the government, for a re-consideration of the principles and the substance of the powers given; because I doubt, if such a door was opened, if we should be very likely to stop at that point which would be safe to the government itself: But I do wish to see a door opened to consider, so far as to incorporate those provisions for the security of rights, against which I believe no serious objection has been made by any class of our constituents.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Prior to listing his proposals for a number of constitutional amendments, Madison acknowledged a major reason for some of the discontent with the Constitution as written: </p>
<p /><blockquote>I believe that the great mass of the people who opposed [the Constitution], disliked it because it did not contain effectual provision against encroachments on particular rights, and those safeguards which they have been long accustomed to have interposed between them and the magistrate who exercised the sovereign power: nor ought we to consider them safe, while a great number of our fellow citizens think these securities necessary.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Articles III to XII were ratified by 11/14 states (&#62; 75%). <a href="/wiki/Congressional_Apportionment_Amendment" id="w">Article I</a>, rejected by <a href="/wiki/Delaware" id="w">Delaware</a>, was ratified only by 10/14 States (&#60; 75%), and despite later ratification by <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" id="w">Kentucky</a> (11/15 states &#60; 75%), the article has never since received the approval of enough states for it to become part of the Constitution. Article II was ratified by 6/14, later 7/15 states, but did not receive the 3/4 majority of States needed for ratification until 1992 when it became the 27th Amendment.</p>

Originally, the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government and not to the several state governments. Parts of the amendments initially proposed by Madison that would have limited state governments (&#34;No state shall violate the equal rights of conscience, or the freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in criminal cases.&#34;) were not approved by Congress, and therefore the Bill of Rights did not appear to apply to the powers of state governments.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus, states had established <a href="/wiki/State_religion" id="w">state churches</a> up until the 1820s, and <a href="/wiki/Southern_United_States" id="w">Southern states</a>, beginning in the 1830s, could ban <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism" id="w">abolitionist</a> literature. In the 1833 case <i><a href="/wiki/Barron_v._Baltimore" id="w">Barron v. Baltimore</a></i>, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" id="w">Supreme Court</a> specifically ruled that the Bill of Rights provided &#34;security against the apprehended encroachments of the general government&#8212;not against those of local governments.&#34; However, in the 1925 judgment on <i><a href="/wiki/Gitlow_v._New_York" id="w">Gitlow v. New York</a></i>, the Supreme Court ruled that the <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, which had been adopted in 1868, made certain applications of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states. The Supreme Court then cited the <i>Gitlow</i> case as precedent for a series of decisions that made most, but not all, of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states under the doctrine of <i>selective incorporation</i>.</p>

<p>The Rotunda itself was constructed in the 1950s and dedicated in 1952 by President <a href="/wiki/Harry_S_Truman" id="w">Harry S Truman</a>, who said, &#34;Only as these documents are reflected in the thoughts and acts of Americans, can they remain symbols of power that can move the world.

<p>After fifty years, signs of deterioration in the casing were noted, while the documents themselves appeared to be well-preserved:  &#34;But if the ink of 1787 was holding its own, the encasements of 1951 were not ... minute crystals and microdroplets of liquid were found on surfaces of the two glass sheets over each document.... The CMS scans confirmed evidence of progressive glass deterioration, which was a major impetus in deciding to re-encase the Charters of Freedom.&#34;<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Accordingly, the casing was updated and the Rotunda rededicated on <a href="/wiki/September_17" id="w">September 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>.
