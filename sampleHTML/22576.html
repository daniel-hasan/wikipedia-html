The <b>Olympic Games</b> (often referred to simply as <b>The Olympics</b> or <b>The Games</b><sup id="_ref-Games_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Games" title="">[1]</a></sup>) is an international <a href="/wiki/Multi-sport_event" id="w">multi-sport event</a> subdivided into summer and winter <a href="/wiki/Sport" id="w">sporting events</a>. The summer and winter games are each held every four years (an <a href="/wiki/Olympiad" id="w">Olympiad</a><sup id="_ref-modernOG_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-modernOG" title="">[2]</a></sup>).

<p>There are many myths surrounding the origin of the ancient Olympic Games. The most popular legend describes that <a href="/wiki/Heracles" id="w">Heracles</a> was the creator of the Olympic Games, and built the Olympic stadium and surrounding buildings as an honor to his father Zeus, after completing his 12 labours. According to that legend he walked in a straight line for 400 strides and called this distance a &#34;stadion&#34; (Greek: &#34;Στάδιον&#34;)- (Roman: &#34;stadium&#34;) (Modern English: &#34;Stage&#34;) that later also became a distance calculation unit. This is also why a modern stadium is 400 meters in circumference length (1 stadium = 400 m). Another myth associates the first Games with the ancient Greek concept of ἐκεχειρία (<i>ekecheiria</i>) or Olympic Truce. The date of the Games&#39; inception based on the count of years in <a href="/wiki/Olympiad" id="w">Olympiads</a> is reconstructed as 776 BC, although scholars&#39; opinions diverge between dates as early as 884 BC and as late as 704 BC.</p>
<p>From then on, the Games quickly became much more important throughout ancient Greece, reaching their zenith in the sixth and fifth centuries BC. The Olympics were of fundamental <a href="/wiki/Religion" id="w">religious</a> importance, contests alternating with sacrifices and ceremonies honouring both <a href="/wiki/Zeus" id="w">Zeus</a>(whose <a href="/wiki/Statue_of_Zeus_at_Olympia" id="w">colossal statue</a> stood at <a href="/wiki/Olympia%2C_Greece" id="w">Olympia</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Pelops" id="w">Pelops</a>, divine hero and mythical king of Olympia famous for his legendary chariot race, in whose honour the games were held. The number of events increased to twenty, and the celebration was spread over several days. Winners of the events were greatly admired and were immortalised in <a href="/wiki/Poem" id="w">poems</a> and <a href="/wiki/Statue" id="w">statues</a>.<sup id="_ref-Ancient Gods IOC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ancient Gods IOC" title="">[9]</a></sup> The Games were held every four years, and the period between two celebrations became known as an &#39;<a href="/wiki/Olympiad" id="w">Olympiad</a>&#39;. The Greeks used Olympiads as one of their methods to count years. The most famous Olympic athlete lived in these times: the sixth century BC wrestler <a href="/wiki/Milo_of_Croton" id="w">Milo of Croton</a> is the only athlete in history to win a victory in six Olympics.<sup id="_ref-Ancient Athletes IOC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ancient Athletes IOC" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Games gradually declined in importance as the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Romans</a> gained power in Greece. When <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a> became the official religion of the Roman Empire, the Olympic Games were seen as a pagan festival and in discord with Christian ethics, and in 393 AD the emperor <a href="/wiki/Theodosius_I" id="w">Theodosius I</a> outlawed the Olympics, ending a thousand-year tradition.<sup id="_ref-Ancient IOC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ancient IOC" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the ancient times normally only <a href="/wiki/Young_men" id="w">young men</a> could participate.<sup id="_ref-Ancient Athletes IOC_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ancient Athletes IOC" title="">[10]</a></sup> Competitors were usually <a href="/wiki/Naked" id="w">naked</a>, not only as the weather was appropriate but also as the festival was meant to be, in part, a celebration of the achievements of the human body. Upon winning the games, the victor would have not only the prestige of being in first place but would also be presented with a crown of olive leaves. The <a href="/wiki/Olive_branch" id="w">olive branch</a> is a sign of hope and peace.<sup id="_ref-Ancient History IOC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ancient History IOC" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even though the bearing of a torch formed an integral aspect of Greek ceremonies, the ancient Olympic Games did not include it, nor was there a symbol formed by interconnecting rings. These <a href="/wiki/Olympic_symbols" id="w">Olympic symbols</a> were introduced as part of the modern Olympic Games.</p>
<a id="Revival" name="Revival"></a><h1> Revival </h1>

<p>In the early seventeenth century, an &#34;Olympick Games&#34; sports festival was run for several years at <a href="/wiki/Chipping_Campden" id="w">Chipping Campden</a> in the English <a href="/wiki/Cotswolds" id="w">Cotswolds</a>, and the present day local <a href="/wiki/Cotswold_Games" id="w">Cotswold Games</a> trace their origin to this festival. They were a local sports event with extraordinary sports, such as shin-kicking.</p>
<p>In 1850, an &#34;Olympian Class&#34; was begun at <a href="/wiki/Much_Wenlock" id="w">Much Wenlock</a> in <a href="/wiki/Shropshire" id="w">Shropshire</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>. This was renamed &#34;Wenlock Olympian Games&#34; in 1859 and continues to this day as the <a href="/wiki/Wenlock_Olympian_Games" id="w">Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games</a>. A national Olympic Games was organised by their founder, Dr William Penny Brookes, at Crystal Palace in London, in 1866.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a wealthy Greek philanthropist called <a href="/wiki/Evangelos_Zappas" id="w">Evangelos Zappas</a> sponsored the revival of the first modern international Olympic Games.<sup id="_ref-Young_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Young" title="">[4]</a></sup> The first was held in an Athens city square in 1859. Zappas paid for the refurbishment of the ancient Panathenian stadium that was first used for an Olympic Games in 1870 and then again in 1875. That same stadium was refurbished a second time and used for the Athens 1896 Games. The revival sponsored by Zappas was a dedicated Olympic Games with athletes that participated from two countries: Greece and the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>The interest in reviving the Olympics as an international event grew further when the ruins of ancient <a href="/wiki/Olympia%2C_Greece" id="w">Olympia</a> were uncovered by German <a href="/wiki/Archaeologist" id="w">archaeologists</a> in the mid-nineteenth century. At the same time, <a href="/wiki/Pierre_de_Coubertin" id="w">Pierre de Coubertin</a> was searching for a reason for the French defeat in the <a href="/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War" id="w">Franco-Prussian War</a> (1870&#8211;1871). He thought the reason was that the French had not received proper physical education, and sought to improve this. Coubertin also sought a way to bring nations closer together, to have the youth of the world compete in sports, rather than fight in war. In 1890 he attended a festival of the Wenlock Olympian Society, and decided that the recovery of the Olympic Games would achieve both of his goals.</p>
<p>Baron Pierre de Coubertin stood on the ideas of both Dr Brookes and the foundations of Evangelis Zappas to found the International Olympic Committee. In a <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Congress" id="w">congress</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Paris" id="w">Sorbonne</a> University, in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, held from <a href="/wiki/June_16" id="w">June 16</a> to <a href="/wiki/June_23" id="w">June 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1894" id="w">1894</a> he presented his ideas to an international audience. On the last day of the congress, it was decided that the first IOC Olympic Games would take place in 1896 in <a href="/wiki/Athens" id="w">Athens</a>, in the country of their birth. To organise the Games, the <a href="/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee" id="w">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC) was established, with the Greek <a href="/wiki/Demetrius_Vikelas" id="w">Demetrius Vikelas</a> as its first president. The Panathenian stadium that was used for Olympic Games in 1870, and 1875 was refurbished and reused for the Olympic Games held in Athens in 1896.</p>
<p>The total number of athletes at the <a href="/wiki/1896_Summer_Olympics" id="w">the first IOC Olympic Games</a>, less than 250, seems small by modern standards, but the games were the largest international sports event ever held until that time. The Greek officials and public were also very enthusiastic, and they even proposed to have the monopoly of organizing the Olympics. The IOC decided differently, however, and the <a href="/wiki/1900_Summer_Olympics" id="w">second Olympic Games</a> took place in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>. Paris was also the first Olympic Games where women were allowed to compete.</p>
<a id="Modern_Olympics" name="Modern_Olympics"></a><h1> Modern Olympics </h1>
<p>{{main}}
After the initial success, the Olympics struggled. The celebrations in <a href="/wiki/1900_Summer_Olympics" id="w">Paris (1900)</a> and <a href="/wiki/1904_Summer_Olympics" id="w">St. Louis (1904)</a> were overshadowed by the <a href="/wiki/World%26%2339%3Bs_Fair" id="w">World&#39;s Fair</a> exhibitions in which they were included. The so-called <a href="/wiki/1906_Summer_Olympics" id="w">Intercalated Games</a> (because of their off-year status, as 1906 is not divisible by four) were held in 1906 in Athens, as the first of an alternating series of Athens-held Olympics. Although originally the IOC recognised and supported these games, they are currently not recognised by the IOC as Olympic Games, which has given rise to the explanation that they were intended to mark the 10th anniversary of the modern Olympics. The 1906 Games again attracted a broad international field of participants—in 1904, 80% had been American—--and great public interest, thereby marking the beginning of a rise in popularity and size of the Games.</p>
<p>From the 241 participants from 14 nations in 1896, the Games grew to nearly 11,100 competitors from 202 countries at the <a href="/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics" id="w">2004 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Athens" id="w">Athens</a>. The number of competitors at the Winter Olympics is much smaller than at the Summer Games; at the <a href="/wiki/2006_Winter_Olympics" id="w">2006 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Turin" id="w">Turin</a> Italy, 2,633 athletes from 80 countries competed in 84 events.</p>
<p>The Olympics are one of the largest media events. In <a href="/wiki/Sydney" id="w">Sydney</a> in 2000 there were over 16,000 broadcasters and journalists, and an estimated 3.8 billion viewers <a href="/wiki/Broadcasting_of_sports_events" id="w">watched the games</a> on <a href="/wiki/Television" id="w">television</a>. The growth of the Olympics is one of the largest problems the Olympics face today. Although allowing professional athletes and attracting sponsorships from major international companies solved financial problems in the 1980s, the large number of athletes, media and spectators makes it difficult and expensive for host cities to organize the Olympics.</p>
<p>203 countries currently participate in the Olympics. This is a noticeably higher number than the number of countries recognised by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a>, which is only 193. The International Olympic Committee allows nations to compete which do not meet the strict requirements for political sovereignty that many other international organizations demand. As a result, many colonies and dependencies are permitted to host their own Olympic teams and athletes even if such competitors hold the same citizenship as another member nation. Examples of this include territories such as <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" id="w">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a>, all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country. Also, since 1980, <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Taiwan</a> has competed under the name &#34;<a href="/wiki/Chinese_Taipei" id="w">Chinese Taipei</a>&#34;, and under a flag specially prepared by the IOC. Prior to that year the <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_China" id="w">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> refused to participate in the Games because Taiwan had been competing under the name &#34;<a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China" id="w">Republic of China</a>&#34;. The Republic of the <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Islands" id="w">Marshall Islands</a> was recognised as a nation by the IOC on February 9, 2006, and should compete in the <a href="/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics" id="w">2008 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Beijing" id="w">Beijing</a>.<sup id="_ref-ONOC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ONOC" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Doping" name="Doping"></a><h2> Doping </h2>
<p>{{Unreferencedsection}}
One of the main problems facing the Olympics (and international sports in general) is <a href="/wiki/Doping_(sport)" id="w">doping</a>, or performance enhancing drugs. In the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs to enhance their performance. For example, the winner of the <a href="/wiki/Marathon_(sports)" id="w">marathon</a> at the <a href="/wiki/1904_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1904 Games</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_J._Hicks" id="w">Thomas J. Hicks</a>, was given <a href="/wiki/Strychnine" id="w">strychnine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brandy" id="w">brandy</a> by his coach, even during the race. As these methods became more extreme, gradually the awareness grew that this was no longer a matter of health through sports. In the mid-1960s, sports federations put a ban on doping, and the IOC followed suit in 1967.</p>
<p>The first and so far only Olympic death caused by doping occurred in 1960. At the cycling road race in Rome the Danish Knud Enemark Jensen fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner&#39;s inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamines.</p>
<p>The first Olympic athlete to test positive for doping use was <a href="/wiki/Hans-Gunnar_Liljenwall" id="w">Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall</a>, a Swedish <a href="/wiki/Modern_pentathlon" id="w">pentathlete</a> at the <a href="/wiki/1968_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1968 Summer Olympics</a>, who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use. Seventy-three athletes followed him over the next 38 years, several medal winners among them. The most publicised doping-related disqualification was that of <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canadian</a> sprinter <a href="/wiki/Ben_Johnson_(athlete)" id="w">Ben Johnson</a>, who won the 100m at the <a href="/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1988 Seoul Olympics</a>, but tested positive for <a href="/wiki/Stanozolol" id="w">stanozolol</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the testing, many athletes continued to use doping without getting caught. In 1990, documents were revealed that showed many <a href="/wiki/East_Germany" id="w">East German</a> female athletes had been unknowingly administered <a href="/wiki/Anabolic_steroid" id="w">anabolic steroids</a> and other drugs by their coaches and trainers as a government policy.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, the IOC took initiative in a more organised battle against doping, leading to the formation of the <a href="/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency" id="w">World Anti-Doping Agency</a> (WADA) in 1999. The recent 2000 Summer Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics have shown that this battle is not nearly over, as several medalists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing were disqualified due to doping offences. One innocent victim of the anti-doping movement at the Olympics was the Romanian gymnast <a href="/wiki/Andreea_R%C4%83ducan" id="w">Andreea Răducan</a> who was stripped of her gold medal-winning performance in the All-Around Competition of the Sydney 2000 games. Test results indicated the presence of the banned-stimulant <a href="/wiki/Pseudophedrine" id="w">pseudophedrine</a> which had been prescribed to her by an Olympic doctor. Raducan had been unaware of the presence of the illegal substance in the medicine that had been prescribed to her for a cold she had during the games.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/2006_Winter_Olympics" id="w">2006 Winter Olympics</a>, only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked. The only other case involved 12 members with high levels of <a href="/wiki/Haemoglobin" id="w">haemoglobin</a> and their punishment was a five day suspension for health reasons.</p>
<p>In October 2007, American sprinter <a href="/wiki/Marion_Jones" id="w">Marion Jones</a> admitted to having taken steroids before the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics. As a result of these admissions, Jones accepted a two-year suspension and forfeiture of all medals, results, points and prizes earned after September 1, 2000. </p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee introduced blood testing for the first time during these games.</p>

<p>{{main}}
Politics interfered with the Olympics on several occasions, the most well-known of which was the <a href="/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1936 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Berlin" id="w">Berlin</a>, where the games were used as <a href="/wiki/Propaganda" id="w">propaganda</a> by the German <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Party" id="w">Nazis</a>. At this Olympics, a true Olympic spirit was shown by <a href="/wiki/Luz_Long" id="w">Luz Long</a>, who helped <a href="/wiki/Jesse_Owens" id="w">Jesse Owens</a> (a <a href="/wiki/Black_people" id="w">black athlete</a>) to win the long jump, at the expense of his own silver medal.<sup id="_ref-Nazi Olympics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nazi Olympics" title="">[20]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> did not participate in the Olympic Games until the <a href="/wiki/1952_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1952 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Helsinki" id="w">Helsinki</a>. Instead, the Soviets organized an international sports event called <a href="/wiki/Spartakiad" id="w">Spartakiads</a>, from 1928 onward. Many athletes from <a href="/wiki/Communist" id="w">Communist</a> organizations or close to them chose not to participate or were even barred from participating in Olympic Games, and instead participated in Spartakiads.<sup id="_ref-GSE_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GSE" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>A political incident on a smaller scale occurred at the <a href="/wiki/1968_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1968 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Mexico_City" id="w">Mexico City</a>. Two American track-and-field athletes, <a href="/wiki/Tommie_Smith" id="w">Tommie Smith</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Carlos" id="w">John Carlos</a>, performed the <a href="/wiki/Black_Power" id="w">Black Power</a> <a href="/wiki/Salute#Clenched fist salute" id="w">salute</a> on the victory stand of the 200-meter <a href="/wiki/Track_and_field" id="w">track and field</a> race. In response, the IOC&#39;s autocratic president <a href="/wiki/Avery_Brundage" id="w">Avery Brundage</a> told the USOC to either send the two athletes home, or withdraw the complete track and field team. The USOC opted for the former.<sup id="_ref-Black Salute_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Black Salute" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a political policy move that flouts the spirit of the Olympic movement, the government of the <a href="/wiki/Islamic_Republic_of_Iran" id="w">Islamic Republic of Iran</a> specifically orders its athletes not to compete in any olympic heat, semi-final, or finals that includes athletes from <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a>. At the 2004 Olympics, an Iranian <a href="/wiki/Judoka" id="w">judoka</a> refused to compete in a heat against an Israeli judoka, but did so surreptitiously to avoid the possibility of Iran being removed from the games for political intrigue (the athlete deliberately didn&#39;t make weight.) The Iranian returned home to a hero&#39;s welcome.<sup id="_ref-Iran-Israel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Iran-Israel" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Violence" name="Violence"></a><h2> Violence </h2>
<p>Despite what Coubertin had hoped for, the Olympics did not bring total peace to the world. In fact, three <a href="/wiki/Olympiad" id="w">Olympiads</a> had to pass without Olympics because of war: due to <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> the <a href="/wiki/1916_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1916 Games</a> were canceled, and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were canceled because of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>Terrorism has also become a recent threat to the Olympic Games. In 1972, when the Summer Games were held in <a href="/wiki/Munich" id="w">Munich</a>, <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" id="w">West Germany</a>, eleven members of the <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israeli</a> Olympic team were taken hostage by <a href="/wiki/Palestinian" id="w">Palestinian</a> <a href="/wiki/Terrorist" id="w">terrorist</a> group <a href="/wiki/Black_September_(group)" id="w">Black September</a> in what is known as the <a href="/wiki/Munich_massacre" id="w">Munich massacre</a>.

<a id="Olympic_Movement" name="Olympic_Movement"></a><h1> Olympic Movement </h1>
<p>A number of organizations are involved in organizing the Olympic Games. Together they form the Olympic Movement. The rules and guidelines by which these organizations operate are outlined in the <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Charter" id="w">Olympic Charter</a>.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Olympic Movement is the <a href="/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee" id="w">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC), currently headed by <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Rogge" id="w">Jacques Rogge</a>. It can be seen as the government of the Olympics, as it takes care of the daily problems and makes all important decisions, such as choosing the host city of the Games, and the programme of the Olympics.</p>
<p>Three groups of organisations operate on a more specialised level:
</p>
<ul>
<li>International Federations (IFs), the governing bodies of a sport (e.g. <a href="/wiki/FIFA" id="w">FIFA</a>, the IF for <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">football (soccer)</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/FIVB" id="w">FIVB</a>, the international governing body for <a href="/wiki/Volleyball" id="w">volleyball</a>.)</li>
<li>National Olympic Committees (NOCs), which regulate the Olympic Movement within each country (eg. <a href="/wiki/USOC" id="w">USOC</a>, the NOC of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>)</li>
<li>Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs), which take care of the organisation of a specific celebration of the Olympics.</li></ul>
<p>At present, 202 NOCs and 35 IFs are part of the Olympic Movement. OCOGs are dissolved after the celebration of each Games, once all subsequent paperwork has been completed.</p>
<p>More broadly speaking, the term Olympic Movement is sometimes also meant to include everybody and everything involved in the Olympics, such as national sport governing bodies, athletes, media, and sponsors of the Olympic Games. </p>
<a id="Criticism" name="Criticism"></a><h2> Criticism </h2>
<p>Most Olympic Games have been held in European and North American cities; only a few games have been held in other places, and all bids by countries in South America and Africa have failed. Many non-westerners believe the games should expand to include locations in poorer regions. <a href="/wiki/Economists" id="w">Economists</a> point out that the massive infrastructure investments could <a href="/wiki/Springboard" id="w">springboard</a> cities into earning higher <a href="/wiki/GDP" id="w">GDP</a> after the games.{{Fact}}  However, many host cities regret the high costs associated with hosting the games as a poor investment{{Fact}}.</p>
<p>In the past, the <a href="/wiki/IOC" id="w">IOC</a> has often been criticised for being a monolithic organisation, with several members remaining a member at old age, or even until their deaths. The leadership of IOC president <a href="/wiki/Juan_Antonio_Samaranch" id="w">Juan Antonio Samaranch</a> especially has been strongly criticised. Under his presidency, the Olympic Movement made great progress, but has been seen as autocratic and corrupt. Samaranch&#39;s ties with the former <a href="/wiki/Fascism" id="w">fascist</a> government in <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>, and his long term as a president (21 years)—until he was 81 years old—have also been points of critique.</p>
<p>In 1998, it became known that several IOC members had <a href="/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal" id="w">taken bribes</a> from the organising committee for the <a href="/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympics" id="w">2002 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Salt_Lake_City" id="w">Salt Lake City</a>, <a href="/wiki/Utah" id="w">Utah</a>, in exchange for a vote on the city at the election of the host city. The IOC started an investigation, which led to four members resigning and six being expelled. The scandal set off further reforms, changing the way in which host cities are elected to avoid further bribes. Also, more active and former athletes were allowed in the IOC, and the membership terms have been limited.</p>
<p>The same year (1998), four European groups organized the International Network Against Olympic Games and Commercial Sports to oppose their cities&#39; bids for future Olympic Games. Also, an Anti-Olympic Alliance had formed in <a href="/wiki/Sydney" id="w">Sydney</a> to protest the hosting of the 2000 Games. Later, a similar movement in <a href="/wiki/Vancouver" id="w">Vancouver</a> and Whistler, <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a> organized to protest the hosting of the 2010 Winter Games. These movements were particularly concerned about adverse local economic impact and dislocation of people to accommodate the hosting of the Olympics.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a> documentary aired in August 2004, entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Panorama_(TV_series)" id="w">Panorama</a>: &#34;Buying the Games&#34;</i>, investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the <a href="/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics" id="w">2012 Summer Olympics</a>. The documentary claimed it is possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. In an airborne television interview on the way home, the Mayor of Paris Bertrand Delanoë, specifically accused the British Prime Minister (Tony Blair) and the London Bid Committee (headed by former Olympic athlete Lord (Sebastien) Coe) of breaking the bid rules with flagrant financial and sexual bribes. He cited French President Jacques Chirac as a witness but President Chirac gave rather more guarded interviews. In particular, <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" id="w">Bulgaria</a>&#39;s member Ivan Slavkov, and Muttaleb Ahmad from the Olympic Council of Asia, were implicated. They have denied the allegations. And Mayor Delanoë never mentioned the matter again. (Indeed two days later when London was attacked by suicide bombers on buses and trains, 52 Londoners were killed and over 700 Londoners were injured, it was both Mayor Delanoë and President Chirac -in an Olympian spirit of which Pierre de Coubertin would have been proud- who were among the first to express their solidarity with London and to send practical help in the form of rescue teams etc.) Others have alleged that the <a href="/wiki/2006_Winter_Olympics" id="w">2006 Winter Olympics</a> were held in <a href="/wiki/Turin" id="w">Turin</a> because officials bribed the IOC and so Turin got the games and <a href="/wiki/Sion%2C_Switzerland" id="w">Sion, Switzerland</a> (which was the favorite) did not.</p>
<p>The Olympic Movement has been accused of being overprotective of its symbolism (in particular, it claims an exclusive and monopolistic copyright over any arrangement of five rings and the term &#34;olympics&#34;), and have taken action against things unrelated to sport, such as the <a href="/wiki/Role-playing_game" id="w">role-playing game</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Legend_of_the_Five_Rings" id="w">Legend of the Five Rings</a></i>. It was accused of <a href="/wiki/Homophobia" id="w">homophobia</a> in 1982 when it successfully sued the Gay Olympics, an event now known as the <a href="/wiki/Gay_Games" id="w">Gay Games</a>, to ban it from using the term &#34;olympics&#34; in its name.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Olympic_symbols" name="Olympic_symbols"></a><h1>Olympic symbols</h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The Olympic movement uses many symbols, most of them representing Coubertin&#39;s ideas and ideals. The best known symbol is probably that of the <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Rings" id="w">Olympic Rings</a>. These five intertwined rings represent the unity of five inhabited continents (with <a href="/wiki/Americas" id="w">America</a> regarded as one single continent). They appear in five colors on a white field on the <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Flag" id="w">Olympic Flag</a>. These colors, white (for the field), red, blue, green, yellow, and black were chosen such that each nation had at least one of these colors in its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914, but the first Games at which it was flown were <a href="/wiki/1920_Summer_Olympics" id="w">Antwerp, 1920</a>. It is hoisted at each celebration of the Games.</p>
<p>The official <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Motto" id="w">Olympic Motto</a> is &#34;Citius, Altius, Fortius&#34;, a <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> phrase meaning &#34;Swifter, Higher, Stronger&#34;. Coubertin&#39;s ideals are probably best illustrated by the <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Creed" id="w">Olympic Creed</a>:</p>
<dl><dd><i>&#34;The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.&#34;</i></dd></dl>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Flame" id="w">Olympic Flame</a> is lit in Olympia and brought to the host city by runners carrying the torch in relay. There it plays an important role in the opening ceremonies. Though the torch fire has been around since <a href="/wiki/1928_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1928</a>, the relay was introduced in <a href="/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1936</a>.</p>
<p>The Olympic mascot, an animal or human figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country, was introduced in <a href="/wiki/1968_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1968</a>. It has played an important part of the games since <a href="/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1980</a> with the debut of <a href="/wiki/Misha" id="w">misha</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russian</a> <a href="/wiki/Bear" id="w">bear</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a> and <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> are the two official languages of the Olympic movement.</p>

<p>Apart from the traditional elements, the host nation ordinarily presents artistic displays of dance and theatre representative of that country.<sup id="_ref-OCprotocol1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCprotocol1" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Various traditional elements frame the opening ceremonies of a celebration of the Olympic Games. The ceremonies typically start with the hoisting of the host country&#39;s flag and the performing of its national anthem.{{Fact}} The traditional part of the ceremonies starts with a &#34;parade of nations&#34; (or of athletes), during which most participating athletes march into the stadium, country by country. One honoured athlete, typically a top competitor, from each country carries the flag of his or her nation, leading the entourage of other athletes from that country.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Traditionally (starting at the <a href="/wiki/1928_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1928 Summer Olympics</a>) Greece marches first, because of its historical status as the origin of the Olympics, while the host nation marches last. (Exceptionally, in 2004, when the Games were held in Athens, Greece marched last as host nation rather than first, although the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Greece" id="w">flag of Greece</a> was carried in first.) Between these two nations, all other participating nations march in alphabetical order of the dominant language of the host country,<sup id="_ref-parade_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-parade" title="">[29]</a></sup>{{Fact}} or in French or English alphabetical order if the host country does not write its dominant language in an alphabet which has a set order. In the <a href="/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1992 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Barcelona" id="w">Barcelona</a>, both <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" id="w">Spanish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Catalan_language" id="w">Catalan</a> were official languages of the games, but due to politics surrounding the use of Catalan, the nations entered in <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a> alphabetical order. The <a href="/wiki/1998_Winter_Olympics" id="w">XVIII Olympic Winter Games</a> in <a href="/wiki/Nagano%2C_Japan" id="w">Nagano, Japan</a> saw nations entering in <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> alphabetical order since the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" id="w">Japanese language</a> grouped both China and Chinese Taipei together in the Parade of Nations.</p>
<p>After all nations have entered, the president of the host country&#39;s Olympic Organising Committee makes a speech, followed by the IOC president who, at the end of his speech introduces the person who is going to declare the Games open. Despite the Games having been awarded to a particular city and not to the country in general, the Opener is usually &#8211; but not always &#8211; the host country&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Head_of_State" id="w">Head of State</a>. So it is this Opener, in turn, who formally opens the Olympics, by reciting the formula: </p><blockquote><i>«I declare open the Games of ... (name of the host city) celebrating the ... (number of the Olympiad) Olympiad of the modern era.»</i><sup id="_ref-OCprotocol2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCprotocol2" title="">[30]</a></sup> (There is a similar recital for the Winter Games.)</blockquote>

<p>Since <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a> at both the Garmisch Partenkirchen Winter Olympics and at the Berlin Summer Olympics &#8211; both in 1936 &#8211; the Openers have unswervingly stuck to this formula. Before 1936, however, the Opener often used to make a short Speech of Welcome before declaring the Games open. There have been very many cases where the country&#39;s Head of State did not open the Olympics at all. The first example was at the <a href="/wiki/Games_of_the_II_Olympiad" id="w">Games of the II Olympiad</a> in Paris in 1900 when there wasn&#39;t even an Opening Ceremony.</p>
<p>There are five examples of this from the United States alone, beginning with the <a href="/wiki/Games_of_the_III_Olympiad" id="w">Games of the III Olympiad</a> in St Louis, Missouri where &#8211; on <a href="/wiki/1_July" id="w">1 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1904" id="w">1904</a> &#8211; Mr David Francis, President of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, performed the ceremony, nobody having even thought of inviting US President Theodore Roosevelt. Then, on 4 February 1932 the then <a href="/wiki/Governor" id="w">Governor</a> of the <a href="/wiki/State_of_New_York" id="w">State of New York</a>, <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" id="w">Franklin D.

In 1960, the <a href="/wiki/Vice-President_of_the_United_States" id="w">Vice-President of the United States</a> <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon" id="w">Richard Nixon</a> was sent by President <a href="/wiki/Dwight_Eisenhower" id="w">Dwight Eisenhower</a> to open the <a href="/wiki/VIII_Olympic_Winter_Games" id="w">VIII Olympic Winter Games</a> in <a href="/wiki/Squaw_Valley%2C_California" id="w">Squaw Valley</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>, and finally, in 1980, Vice President <a href="/wiki/Walter_Mondale" id="w">Walter Mondale</a> stood in for President <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" id="w">Jimmy Carter</a> to open the <a href="/wiki/XIII_Olympic_Winter_Games" id="w">XIII Olympic Winter Games</a>, also in Lake Placid.</p>
<p>The most recent example was at the <a href="/wiki/Games_of_the_XXVII_Olympiad" id="w">Games of the XXVII Olympiad</a> in Sydney, Australia, where, at the insistence of the Australian Government, it was the <a href="/wiki/Governor-General" id="w">Governor-General</a> of <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> <a href="/wiki/Sir_William_Deane" id="w">Sir William Deane</a> who opened the Games and not <a href="/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth" id="w">Queen Elizabeth</a> (who as <a href="/wiki/Queen_of_Australia" id="w">Queen of Australia</a> is the Australian Head of State). Throughout the 20th century there were numerous other such instances.</p>
<p>Next, the Olympic Flag is carried horizontally (since the <a href="/wiki/1960_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1960 Summer Olympics</a>) into the stadium and hoisted as the <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Anthem" id="w">Olympic Anthem</a> is played. The flag bearers of all countries circle a <a href="/wiki/Rostrum" id="w">rostrum</a>, where one athlete (since the <a href="/wiki/1920_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1920 Summer Olympics</a>) and one judge (since the <a href="/wiki/1972_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1972 Summer Olympics</a>) speak the <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Oath" id="w">Olympic Oath</a>, declaring they will compete and judge according to the rules.<sup id="_ref-OCprotocol2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCprotocol2" title="">[30]</a></sup> Finally, the <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Torch" id="w">Torch</a> is brought into the stadium, passed from athlete to athlete, until it reaches the last carrier of the Torch, often a well-known athlete from the host nation, who lights the fire in the stadium&#39;s cauldron.<sup id="_ref-OCprotocol2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCprotocol2" title="">[30]</a></sup> The Olympic Flame has been lit since the <a href="/wiki/1928_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1928 Summer Olympics</a>, but the torch relay did not start until the <a href="/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1936 Summer Olympics</a>. Beginning at the post-<a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> <a href="/wiki/1920_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1920 Summer Olympics</a>, the lighting of the Olympic Flame was for 68 years followed by the release of <a href="/wiki/Dove" id="w">doves</a>, symbolizing peace.<sup id="_ref-OCprotocol2_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OCprotocol2" title="">[30]</a></sup> This gesture was discontinued after several doves were burned alive in the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony of the <a href="/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1988 Summer Olympics</a>.<sup id="_ref-doves_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-doves" title="">[31]</a></sup> However, some Opening Ceremonies have continued to include doves in other forms; for example, the 2002 Winter Olympics featured skaters holding kite-like cloth dove puppets.</p>
<p>Opening ceremonies have been held outdoors, usually on the main athletics stadium, but those for the <a href="/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics" id="w">2010 Winter Olympics</a> will be the first to be held indoors, at the <a href="/wiki/BC_Place_Stadium" id="w">BC Place Stadium</a>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Closing" name="Closing"></a><h2> Closing </h2>
<p>Various traditional elements also frame the closing ceremonies of an Olympic Games, which take place after all of the events have concluded. Flag bearers from each participating delegation enter the stadium in single file, but behind them march all of the athletes without any distinction or grouping of nationality &#8211; a tradition that began at the <a href="/wiki/1956_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1956 Summer Olympics</a> at the suggestion of Melbourne schoolboy <a href="/wiki/John_Ian_Wing" id="w">John Ian Wing</a>, who thought it would be a way of bringing the athletes of the world together as &#34;one nation&#34;.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> (In <a href="/wiki/2006_Winter_Olympics" id="w">2006</a>, the athletes marched in with their countrymen, then dispersed and mingled as the ceremonies went on).</p>
<p>Three national flags are each hoisted onto flagpoles one at a time while their respective national anthems are played: The flag of Greece on the righthand pole (again honoring the birthplace of the Olympic Games), the flag of the host country on the middle pole, and finally the flag of the host country of the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games, on the lefthand pole.<sup id="_ref-CCprotocol_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CCprotocol" title="">[34]</a></sup> (Exceptionally, in 2004, when the Games were held in Athens, only one flag of Greece was raised.)</p>
<p>In what is known as the &#34;Antwerp Ceremony&#34; (because the tradition started during the <a href="/wiki/1920_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1920 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="/wiki/Antwerp" id="w">Antwerp</a>), the mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers a special Olympic Flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the mayor of the next city to host the Olympic Games.<sup id="_ref-CCprotocol_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CCprotocol" title="">[34]</a></sup> The receiving mayor then waves the flag eight times. There are three such flags, differing from all other copies in that they have a six-coloured fringe around the flag, and are tied with six coloured ribbons to a flagstaff:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Antwerp flag:</b> Was presented to the IOC at the <a href="/wiki/1920_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1920 Summer Olympics</a> by the city of <a href="/wiki/Antwerp_(city)" id="w">Antwerp, Belgium</a>, and was passed on to the next organising city of the <a href="/wiki/Summer_Olympics" id="w">Summer Olympics</a> until the Games of <a href="/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics" id="w">Seoul 1988</a>.</li>
<li><b>The Oslo flag:</b> Was presented to the IOC at the <a href="/wiki/1952_Winter_Olympics" id="w">1952 Winter Olympics</a> by the city of <a href="/wiki/Oslo" id="w">Oslo, Norway</a>, and is passed on to the next organising city of the <a href="/wiki/Winter_Olympics" id="w">Winter Olympics</a>.</li>
<li><b>The Seoul flag:</b> Was presented to the IOC at the <a href="/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1988 Summer Olympics</a> by the city of <a href="/wiki/Seoul" id="w">Seoul, The Republic of Korea (South Korea)</a>, and is passed on to the next organising city of the Summer Olympics, which was <a href="/wiki/Barcelona" id="w">Barcelona, Spain</a>, at that time.</li></ul>
<p>A problem was posed by this tradition at the <a href="/wiki/2006_Olympic_Winter_Games" id="w">2006 Winter Games</a> in <a href="/wiki/Turin%2C_Italy" id="w">Turin, Italy</a>.  The flag was passed from <a href="/wiki/Setgio_Chiamparino" id="w">Setgio Chiamparino</a>, the mayor of Turin, to <a href="/wiki/Sam_Sullivan" id="w">Sam Sullivan</a>, the mayor of <a href="/wiki/Vancouver" id="w">Vancouver</a>.  Unfortunately, Sullivan is a <a href="/wiki/Paraplegic" id="w">paraplegic</a> so he waved the flag by holding it in one hand and turning his wheelchair back and forth eight times.</p>
<p>After these traditional elements, the next host nation introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theatre representative of that country. This tradition began with the <a href="/wiki/1976_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1976 Games</a>.</p>
<p>The president of the host country&#39;s Olympic Organising Committee makes a speech, followed by the IOC president, who at the end of his speech formally closes the Olympics, by saying: </p><blockquote><i>«I declare the Games of the ... Olympiad/... Olympic Winter Games closed and, in accordance with tradition, I call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in ... to celebrate the Games of the ... Olympiad/... Olympic Winter Games.»</i></blockquote> The Olympic Flame is extinguished, and while the Olympic anthem is being played, the Olympic Flag that was hoisted during the opening ceremonies is lowered from the flagpole and horizontally carried out of the stadium.<sup id="_ref-CCprotocol_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CCprotocol" title="">[34]</a></sup>{{Fact}}

<a id="Medal_Presentation" name="Medal_Presentation"></a><h2>Medal Presentation</h2>

<p>After medals are awarded and presented for a particular event, the flags of the nations of the three medalists would be raised. The flag of the gold medalist&#39;s country would be in the center and always raised the highest while the flag of the silver medalist&#39;s country would be on the left to the observer and the flag of the bronze medalist&#39;s country would be on the right, both at lower elevations to the gold medalist&#39;s country&#39;s flag. The flags would be raised to the national anthem of the gold medalist&#39;s country.</p>
<p>This format of medal presentation is also seen in other multi-sporting events such as the <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asian_Games" id="w">Southeast Asian Games</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" id="w">Commonwealth Games</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Asian_Games" id="w">Asian Games</a>.</p>
<a id="Olympic_sports" name="Olympic_sports"></a><h1> Olympic sports </h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Currently, the Olympic program consists of 35 different sports, 53 disciplines and more than 400 events. The Summer Olympics includes 28 sports with 38 disciplines and the Winter Olympics includes 7 sports with 15 disciplines.<sup id="_ref-Sports_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sports" title="">[35]</a></sup> Nine sports were on the original Olympic programme in 1896: <a href="/wiki/Athletics_(track_and_field)" id="w">athletics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cycling" id="w">cycling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fencing" id="w">fencing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gymnastics" id="w">gymnastics</a>, <a href="/wiki/Weightlifting" id="w">weightlifting</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shooting" id="w">shooting</a>, <a href="/wiki/Swimming" id="w">swimming</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tennis" id="w">tennis</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sport_wrestling" id="w">wrestling</a>. If the 1896 <a href="/wiki/Rowing_(sport)" id="w">rowing</a> events had not been cancelled due to bad weather, they would have been included in this list as well.<sup id="_ref-1896 report_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1896 report" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the most recent Winter Olympics, seven sports were conducted, or 15 if each sport such as <a href="/wiki/Skiing" id="w">skiing</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ice_skating" id="w">skating</a> is counted. Of these, <a href="/wiki/Cross_country_skiing" id="w">cross country skiing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Figure_skating" id="w">figure skating</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ice_hockey" id="w">ice hockey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nordic_combined" id="w">Nordic combined</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ski_jumping" id="w">ski jumping</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Long_track_speed_skating" id="w">speed skating</a> have been featured on the programme at all Winter Olympics. In addition, figure skating and ice hockey also have been contested as part of the Summer Games before the introduction of separate Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>In recent years, the IOC has added several new sports to the programme to attract attention from young spectators. Examples of such sports include <a href="/wiki/Snowboarding" id="w">snowboarding</a> and <a href="/wiki/Beach_volleyball" id="w">beach volleyball</a>. The growth of the Olympics also means that some less popular (<a href="/wiki/Modern_pentathlon" id="w">modern pentathlon</a>) or expensive (white water <a href="/wiki/Canoeing" id="w">canoeing</a>) sports may lose their place on the Olympic programme. The IOC decided to discontinue <a href="/wiki/Baseball" id="w">baseball</a> and <a href="/wiki/Softball" id="w">softball</a> beginning in 2012.</p>
<p>Rule 48.1 of the Olympic Charter requires that there be a minimum of 15 Olympic sports at each Summer Games. Following its 114th Session (Mexico 2002), the IOC also decided to limit the programme of the Summer Games to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes. The Olympic sports are defined as those governed by the International Federations listed in Rule 46 of the Olympic Charter. A two-thirds vote of the IOC is required to amend the Charter to promote a Recognised Federation to Olympic status and therefore make the sports it governs eligible for inclusion on the Olympic programme. Rule 47 of the Charter requires that <i>only Olympic sports</i> may be included in the programme.</p>
<p>The IOC reviews the Olympic programme at the first Session following each Olympiad. A simple majority is required for an Olympic sport to be included in the Olympic programme. Under the current rules, an Olympic sport not selected for inclusion in a particular Games remains an Olympic sport and may be included again later with a simple majority. At the <a href="/wiki/117th_IOC_Session" id="w">117th IOC Session</a>, 26 sports were included in the programme for London 2012.</p>
<p>Until 1992, the Olympics also often featured <a href="/wiki/Demonstration_sport" id="w">demonstration sports</a>. The objective was for these sports to reach a larger audience; 
the winners of these events are not official Olympic champions. 
These sports were sometimes sports popular only in the host nation, 
but internationally known sports have also been demonstrated. 
Some demonstration sports eventually were included as full-medal events.</p>
<a id="Amateurism_and_professionalism" name="Amateurism_and_professionalism"></a><h2> Amateurism and professionalism </h2>
<p>{{see}}
The English <a href="/wiki/Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)" id="w">public schools</a> of the second half of the 19th century had a major influence on many sports. The schools contributed to the rules and influenced the governing bodies of those sports out of all proportion to their size. They subscribed to the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" id="w">Ancient Greek</a> and Roman belief that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying: <i><a href="/wiki/Mens_sana_in_corpore_sano" id="w">mens sana in corpore sano</a></i> &#8211; a sound mind in a healthy body. In this ethos, taking part has more importance than winning, because society expected <a href="/wiki/Gentleman" id="w">gentlemen</a> to become all-rounders and not the best at everything. Class prejudice against &#34;trade&#34; reinforced this attitude. 
The house of the parents of a typical public schoolboy would have a <a href="/wiki/Tradesman" id="w">tradesman</a>&#39;s entrance, because tradesmen did not rank as the social equals of gentlemen. Apart from class considerations there was the typically English concept of &#34;fairness,&#34; in which practicing or training was considered as tantamount to cheating; it meant that you considered it more important to win than to take part. Those who practiced a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practiced it merely as a &#34;hobby.&#34;</p>
<p>The public schools had a deep involvement in the development of many team sports including all British codes of <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">football</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricket</a> and <a href="/wiki/Field_hockey" id="w">hockey</a>. The ethos of English public schools greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The International Olympic Committee invited a representative of the <a href="/wiki/Headmasters%26%2339%3B_Conference" id="w">Headmasters&#39; Conference</a> (the association of <a href="/wiki/Headmaster" id="w">headmasters</a> of the English public schools) to attend their early meetings. The Headmasters&#39; Conference chose the <a href="/wiki/Reverend" id="w">Reverend</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Stuart_de_Courcy_Laffan" id="w">Robert Laffan</a>, the headmaster of <a href="/wiki/Cheltenham_College" id="w">Cheltenham College</a>, as their representative to the IOC meetings. He was made a member of the IOC in 1897 and, following the first visit of the IOC to London in 1904, he was central to the founding of the <a href="/wiki/British_Olympic_Association" id="w">British Olympic Association</a> a year later.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-BC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BC" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>In Coubertin&#39;s vision, athletes should be gentlemen. Initially, only amateurs were considered such; <a href="/wiki/Professional_sports#Olympic Games" id="w">professional athletes</a> were not allowed to compete in the Olympic Games. A short-lived exception was made for professional fencing instructors.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> This exclusion of professionals has caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics.</p>
<p>1912 Olympic <a href="/wiki/Pentathlon" id="w">pentathlon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Decathlon" id="w">decathlon</a> champion, <a href="/wiki/Jim_Thorpe" id="w">Jim Thorpe</a>, was disqualified when it was discovered that he played semi-professional <a href="/wiki/Baseball" id="w">baseball</a> prior to winning his medals. He was restored as champion on compassionate grounds by the IOC in 1983. Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the <a href="/wiki/1936_Winter_Olympics" id="w">1936 Winter Olympics</a> in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were considered professionals.</p>
<p>It gradually became clear to many that the amateurism rules had become outdated, not least because the self-financed amateurs of Western countries often were no match for the state-sponsored &#34;full-time amateurs&#34; of Eastern bloc countries. Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism. In the 1970s, amateurism requirements were dropped from the Olympic Charter, leaving decisions on professional participation to the <a href="/wiki/Sport_governing_body" id="w">international federation</a> for each sport. This switch was perhaps best exemplified by the American <a href="/wiki/Dream_Team_(basketball)" id="w">Dream Team</a>, composed of well-paid <a href="/wiki/National_Basketball_Association" id="w">NBA</a> stars, which won the Olympic gold medal in <a href="/wiki/Basketball" id="w">basketball</a> in 1992. <a href="/wiki/As_of_2004" id="w">As of 2004</a>, the only sport in which no professionals compete is <a href="/wiki/Boxing" id="w">boxing</a> (though even this requires a loose definition of amateurism, as some boxers receive cash prizes from their NOCs); in men&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">football (soccer)</a>, the number of players over 23 years of age is limited to three per team.</p>
<p>Advertisement regulations are still very strict, at least on the actual playing field, although &#34;Official Olympic Sponsors&#34; are common. Athletes are only allowed to have the names of clothing and equipment manufacturers on their outfits. The sizes of these markings are limited.</p>

The athletes (or teams) who place first, second, or third in each event receive medals. The winners receive &#34;gold medals&#34;. (Though they were solid <a href="/wiki/Gold" id="w">gold</a> until 1912, they are now made of <a href="/wiki/Gilding" id="w">gilded</a> silver.) The runners-up receive <a href="/wiki/Silver" id="w">silver</a> medals, and the third-place athletes <a href="/wiki/Bronze" id="w">bronze</a> medals. In some events contested by a <a href="/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament" id="w">single-elimination tournament</a> (most notably <a href="/wiki/Boxing" id="w">boxing</a>), third place might not be determined, in which case both semi-final losers receive bronze medals. The practice of awarding medals to the top three competitors was introduced in 1904; at the <a href="/wiki/1896_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1896 Olympics</a> only the first two received a medal, silver and bronze, while various prizes were awarded in <a href="/wiki/1900_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1900</a>. However, the <a href="/wiki/1904_Summer_Olympics" id="w">1904 Olympics</a> also awarded silver trophies for first place, which makes <a href="/wiki/1906_Summer_Olympics" id="w">Athens 1906</a> the first games that awarded the three medals only. In addition, from 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth and sixth have received certificates which became officially known as &#34;victory diplomas;&#34; since 1976 the medal winners have received these also, and in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added, presumably to ensure that all losing quarter-finalists in events using single-elimination formats would receive diplomas, thus obviating the need for consolation (or officially, &#34;classification&#34;) matches to determine fifth through eighth places (though interestingly these latter are still contested in many elimination events anyway). Certificates were awarded also at the 1896 Olympics, but there they were awarded in addition to the medals to first and second place. Commemorative medals and diplomas &#8212; which differ in design from those referred to above &#8212; are also made available to participants finishing lower than third and eighth respectively. At the <a href="/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics" id="w">2004 Summer Olympics</a> in Athens, the first three were given wreaths as well as their medals.</p>
<p>Because the Olympics are held only once every four years, the public and athletes often consider them as more important and valuable than world championships and other international tournaments, which are often held annually. Many athletes have become celebrities or heroes in their own country, or even world-wide, after becoming Olympic champions.</p>
<p>The diversity of the sports, and the great differences between the Olympic Games in 1896 and today make it difficult to decide which athlete is the most successful Olympic athlete of all time. This is further complicated since the IOC no longer recognises the <a href="/wiki/Intercalated_Games" id="w">Intercalated Games</a> which it originally organised. When measuring by the number of titles won at the Modern Olympic Games, the following athletes may be considered the most successful.</p>

<a id="Medals_per_country" name="Medals_per_country"></a><h2>Medals per country</h2>
<p>The IOC does not publish lists of medals per country, but the media often does. A comparison between countries would be unfair to countries with fewer inhabitants, so some have made calculations of medals per number of inhabitants, such as <a class="externallink" href="http://abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/57a31759b55dc970ca2568a1002477b6/be9f47591541e29eca256ef40004f25a!OpenDocument" rel="nofollow" title="http://abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/57a31759b55dc970ca2568a1002477b6/be9f47591541e29eca256ef40004f25a!OpenDocument">http://abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/57a31759b55dc970ca2568a1002477b6/be9f47591541e29eca256ef40004f25a!OpenDocument</a> for the 2004 Olympics and <a class="externallink" href="http://simon.forsyth.net/olympics.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://simon.forsyth.net/olympics.html">http://simon.forsyth.net/olympics.html</a> for a few more. A problem here is that for a very small country, gaining just one medal could mean the difference between the very top and the very bottom of the list (a point illustrated by the <a href="/wiki/Bahamas" id="w">Bahamas</a>&#39; per capita number one position in 2004). On the other hand, a large country may not be able to send a number of athletes that is proportional to its size because a limit is set for the number of participants per country for a specific sport. </p>
<p>A comparison of the total number of medals <i>over time</i> is further complicated by the fact that the number of times that countries have participated is not equal, and that many countries have gained and lost territories where medal-winning athletes come from. A point in case is the <a href="/wiki/USSR" id="w">USSR</a>, which not only participated relatively rarely (18 times, versus 44 times for the <a href="/wiki/USA" id="w">USA</a> and 45 times for the <a href="/wiki/UK" id="w">UK</a>), but also ceased to exist in 1991. The resulting <a href="/wiki/Russian_Federation" id="w">Russian Federation</a> is largely, but not entirely equal to the former USSR. Also, one would have to use population statistics <i>at the time</i>. </p>
<p>The IOC medal tally chart is based on the number of gold medals for country.  Where states are equal, the number of silver medals (and then bronze medals) are counted to determine rankings.
Since 1996, the only countries that have appeared in the top 10 medal tallies for summer Olympics have been the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Federation" id="w">Russian Federation</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>.  Since 1994, the only countries that have appeared in the top 10 medal tallies for winter Olympics have been <a href="/wiki/Norway" id="w">Norway</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Federation" id="w">Russian Federation</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>.</p>
<a id="Olympic_Games_host_cities" name="Olympic_Games_host_cities"></a><h1>Olympic Games host cities</h1>
<p>By 2010, the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 41 cities in 22 countries. In 2012, London will become the first city to have hosted the Olympic Games three times.</p>
<p>The number in parentheses following the city/country denotes how many times that city/country had then hosted the games. This table excludes modern international Olympic Games held before the foundation of the International Olympic Committee.</p>
