<p><b>Hanna-Barbera</b> was an animated cartoon production company that dominated North American television <a href="/wiki/Animation" id="w">animation</a> during the second half of the 20th century.  The company was originally formed in 1944 by <a href="/wiki/MGM" id="w">MGM</a> animation directors <a href="/wiki/William_Hanna" id="w">William Hanna</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Barbera" id="w">Joseph Barbera</a> and live-action director <a href="/wiki/George_Sidney" id="w">George Sidney</a> as <i>H-B Enterprises</i> in order to produce sponsored films and later television commercials.</p>
<p>After MGM shut down its animation studio in 1957, H-B Enterprises became Hanna and Barbera&#39;s full-time job, and the company was re-named <i>Hanna-Barbera Productions</i> in 1960. Over the next three decades, Hanna-Barbera produced many successful cartoon shows, including <i><a href="/wiki/The_Huckleberry_Hound_Show" id="w">The Huckleberry Hound Show</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Flintstones" id="w">The Flintstones</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Top_Cat" id="w">Top Cat</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Yogi_Bear_Show" id="w">The Yogi Bear Show</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Jetsons" id="w">The Jetsons</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Jonny_Quest" id="w">Jonny Quest</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Scooby-Doo" id="w">Scooby-Doo</a></i>, and  <i><a href="/wiki/The_Smurfs" id="w">The Smurfs</a></i>, many of which would go on to become icons of Western pop culture. In the mid-1980s, the company&#39;s fortunes declined somewhat after the profitability of Saturday morning cartoons were eclipsed by weekday afternoon syndication. </p>
<p>In 1991, the company was purchased by <a href="/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting" id="w">Turner Broadcasting</a>, primarily so that Turner could use its extensive cartoon library as the basis of the programming for its new <a href="/wiki/Cartoon_Network" id="w">Cartoon Network</a> cable television channel. Re-christened <i>H-B Production Company</i> in 1992, and <i>Hanna-Barbera Cartoons</i> in 1993, the studio continued without active regular input from William Hanna or Joseph Barbera, who both went into semi-retirement yet continued to serve as ceremonial figureheads for the studio. During the late 1990s, Turner turned Hanna-Barbera towards primarily producing new material for the Cartoon Network. In 1996, Turner was bought out by <a href="/wiki/Time_Warner" id="w">Time Warner</a>. With Bill Hanna&#39;s death in 2001, Hanna-Barbera was absorbed into <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros._Animation" id="w">Warner Bros. Animation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cartoon_Network_Studios" id="w">Cartoon Network Studios</a> assumed production of Cartoon Network output. Joe Barbera remained with Warner Bros. Animation until his death in 2006. The Hanna-Barbera name is today only used to market properties and productions associated with Hanna-Barbera&#39;s &#34;classic&#34; works such as <i>The Flintstones</i> and <i>Scooby-Doo</i>.</p>

<a id="The_beginnings_of_Hanna-Barbera" name="The_beginnings_of_Hanna-Barbera"></a><h2>The beginnings of Hanna-Barbera</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Melrose%2C_New_Mexico" id="w">Melrose, New Mexico</a> native William Hanna and <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>-born Joseph Barbera first teamed together while working at the <a href="/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer_cartoon_studio" id="w">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio</a> in 1939. Their first directorial project was a cartoon entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Puss_Gets_the_Boot" id="w">Puss Gets the Boot</a></i> (1940), which served as the genesis of the popular <i><a href="/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry_(MGM)" id="w">Tom and Jerry</a></i> cartoon series. Hanna and Barbera served as the directors and story men for the <i>Tom and Jerry</i> cartoons for seventeen years, winning eight <a href="/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Animated_Short_Film" id="w">Academy Awards for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)</a> between <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a> and <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a> for their work.</p>
<p>Hanna, Barbera, and MGM live-action director <a href="/wiki/George_Sidney" id="w">George Sidney</a> formed H-B Enterprises in 1944 while continuing working for <a href="/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" id="w">MGM</a>, and used the side company to work on ancillary projects, including early television commercials and the original opening titles to the popular 1950s <a href="/wiki/Television" id="w">television</a> series <i><a href="/wiki/I_Love_Lucy" id="w">I Love Lucy</a></i>.  </p>
<p>MGM closed their animation studio in 1957, as it felt it had acquired a reasonable backlog of shorts for re-release. Hanna and Barbera hired most of their MGM unit to work for H-B Enterprises, which became a full-fledged production company at this time. The decision was made to specialize in television animation. In order to obtain working capital to produce their cartoons, H-B made a deal with the <a href="/wiki/Screen_Gems" id="w">Screen Gems</a> television division of <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" id="w">Columbia Pictures</a> in which the new animation studio received working capital in exchange for distribution rights. H-B&#39;s first TV series was <i><a href="/wiki/The_Ruff_%26amp%3B_Reddy_Show" id="w">The Ruff &#38; Reddy Show</a></i>, which premiered on <a href="/wiki/NBC" id="w">NBC</a> in December 1957. </p>
<p>In 1958, H-B had their first big success with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Huckleberry_Hound_Show" id="w">The Huckleberry Hound Show</a></i>, a syndicated series aired in most markets just before primetime. The program was a ratings success, and introduced a new crop of cartoon stars to audiences, in particular <a href="/wiki/Huckleberry_Hound" id="w">Huckleberry Hound</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yogi_Bear" id="w">Yogi Bear</a>. <i>The Huckleberry Hound Show</i> won the 1960 <a href="/wiki/Emmy_Award" id="w">Emmy Award</a> for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Children&#39;s Programming.</p>
<p>By 1959, H-B Enterprises was reincorporated as <i>Hanna-Barbera Productions</i>, and was slowly becoming a leader in television animation production. After introducing a second syndicated series, <i><a href="/wiki/Quick_Draw_McGraw" id="w">Quick Draw McGraw</a></i>, in 1959, Hanna-Barbera migrated into network primetime production with the animated <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" id="w">ABC</a> sitcom <i><a href="/wiki/The_Flintstones" id="w">The Flintstones</a></i> in 1960. Loosely based upon the popular live-action sitcom <i><a href="/wiki/The_Honeymooners" id="w">The Honeymooners</a></i> yet set in a fictionalized stone age of cavemen and dinosaurs, <i>The Flintstones</i> ran for six seasons in prime time on ABC, becoming a ratings and merchandising success.</p>

Hanna-Barbera never had a building of its own until 1963, when the Hanna-Barbera Studio, located at 3400 Cahuenga Blvd. in <a href="/wiki/Studio_City%2C_California" id="w">Studio City, California</a>, was opened. The Columbia/Hanna-Barbera partnership lasted until 1967, when Hanna and Barbera sold the studio to <a href="/wiki/Taft_Broadcasting" id="w">Taft Broadcasting</a> while retaining their positions at the studio.</p>
<a id="Television_cartoons" name="Television_cartoons"></a><h2>Television cartoons</h2>
<p>Hanna-Barbera was one of the first animation studio to successfully produce animated cartoons especially for television. Until then, cartoons on television consisted primarily of rebroadcasts of theatrical cartoons. During the early and mid-1960s, the studio debuted several new successful programs, among them prime time ABC series such as <i><a href="/wiki/Top_Cat" id="w">Top Cat</a></i> (1961-62), <i><a href="/wiki/The_Jetsons" id="w">The Jetsons</a></i> (1962-63), and <i><a href="/wiki/Jonny_Quest" id="w">Jonny Quest</a></i> (1964-65). New series produced for syndication and Saturday mornings included <i><a href="/wiki/The_Yogi_Bear_Show" id="w">The Yogi Bear Show</a></i> (a syndicated spinoff from <i>Huckleberry Hound</i>, 1961-63), <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hanna-Barbera_New_Cartoon_Series" id="w">The Hanna-Barbera New Cartoon Series</a></i> featuring <i><a href="/wiki/Wally_Gator" id="w">Wally Gator</a></i> (syndicated, 1962-63), <i><a href="/wiki/The_Magilla_Gorilla_Show" id="w">The Magilla Gorilla Show</a></i> (syndicated, 1964-67), and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Atom_Ant/Secret_Squirrel_Show" id="w">The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/NBC" id="w">NBC</a>, 1965-67). Hanna-Barbera also produced several television commercials, often starring their own characters, and animated the opening credits for the ABC sitcom <i><a href="/wiki/Bewitched" id="w">Bewitched</a></i>, and would use the <i>Bewitched</i> characters as guest stars on <i>The Flintstones</i>.</p>
<p>The studio also produced a few theatrical projects for Columbia Pictures, including <i><a href="/wiki/Loopy_De_Loop" id="w">Loopy De Loop</a></i>, a series of theatrical cartoons shorts, and two feature film projects based on its television properties, <i><a href="/wiki/Hey_There%2C_It%26%2339%3Bs_Yogi_Bear!" id="w">Hey There, It&#39;s Yogi Bear!</a></i> (1964) and <i><a href="/wiki/A_Man_Called_Flintstone" id="w">A Man Called Flintstone</a></i> (1966). </p>
<p>Starting in 1965, Hanna-Barbera tried its hand at being a record label for a short time. <a href="/wiki/Danny_Hutton" id="w">Danny Hutton</a> was hired by Hanna-Barbera to become the head of <a href="/wiki/Hanna_Barbera_Records" id="w">Hanna Barbera Records</a> or HBR from 1965-1966.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> HBR Records was distributed by <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Records" id="w">Columbia/CBS Records</a>, with artists such as <a href="/wiki/Louis_Prima" id="w">Louis Prima</a>, <a href="/wiki/Five_Americans" id="w">Five Americans</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scatman_Crothers" id="w">Scatman Crothers</a>, and The <a href="/wiki/13th_Floor_Elevators" id="w">13th Floor Elevators</a>.  Previously, children&#39;s records with Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters were released by <a href="/wiki/Colpix_Records" id="w">Colpix Records</a>.</p>
<p>The Hanna-Barbera studio especially captured the market for <a href="/wiki/Saturday_morning_cartoon" id="w">Saturday morning cartoons</a>. After the success of <i>The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show</i> in 1965, H-B debuted two new Saturday morning series the following year: <i><a href="/wiki/Space_Ghost_and_Dino_Boy" id="w">Space Ghost and Dino Boy</a></i>, which featured action-adventure, and <i><a href="/wiki/Frankenstein%2C_Jr._and_The_Impossibles" id="w">Frankenstein, Jr. and The Impossibles</a></i>, which blended action-adventure with the earlier H-B style. A slew of H-B action cartoons followed in 1967, among them <i><a href="/wiki/Shazzan" id="w">Shazzan</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Birdman_and_the_Galaxy_Trio" id="w">Birdman and the Galaxy Trio</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Moby_Dick_and_the_Mighty_Mightor" id="w">Moby Dick and the Mighty Mightor</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Young_Samson_and_Goliath" id="w">Young Samson and Goliath</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Herculoids" id="w">The Herculoids</a></i> and an adaptation of <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Comics" id="w">Marvel Comics</a>&#39; <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Four_(1967_TV_series)" id="w">Fantastic Four</a></i>. Between these programs and others remaining on the air (reruns of <i>The Flintstones</i>, <i>The Jetsons</i> and <i>Jonny Quest</i>), Hanna-Barbera cartoons aired on all three networks&#39; Saturday morning lineups, and dominated CBS&#39;s and NBC&#39;s schedules in particular.</p>
<p>While the action programs were notably popular and successful, pressure from parent-run organizations such as <a href="/wiki/Action_for_Children%26%2339%3Bs_Television" id="w">Action for Children&#39;s Television</a> forced the cancellation of all of them by 1969. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> In 1968, Hanna-Barbera mixed live-action and animated comedy-action for its NBC anthology series, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Banana_Splits_Adventure_Hour" id="w">The Banana Splits Adventure Hour</a></i>, while the successful <i><a href="/wiki/Wacky_Races" id="w">Wacky Races</a></i>, aired on CBS, returned H-B to straight animated slapstick humor.</p>
<p>Hanna-Barbera&#39;s next runaway hit came with <i><a href="/wiki/Scooby-Doo%2C_Where_Are_You!" id="w">Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!</a></i>, a program which blended elements of the H-B comedy series, the action series, and rival <a href="/wiki/Filmation" id="w">Filmation</a>&#39;s then-current hit program <i><a href="/wiki/The_Archie_Show" id="w">The Archie Show</a></i>. <i>Scooby-Doo</i> centered on four teenagers and a dog solving mysteries, and was popular enough to remain on the air and in production until 1986. A cavalcade of H-B Saturday morning cartoons featuring mystery-solving/crime-fighting teenagers with comic pets soon followed, among them <i><a href="/wiki/Josie_and_the_Pussycats_(TV_series)" id="w">Josie and the Pussycats</a></i> (1970-72), <i><a href="/wiki/The_Funky_Phantom" id="w">The Funky Phantom</a></i> (1971-72), <i><a href="/wiki/Speed_Buggy" id="w">Speed Buggy</a></i> (1973-74), <i><a href="/wiki/Clue_Club" id="w">Clue Club</a></i> (1976-78) and <i><a href="/wiki/Jabberjaw" id="w">Jabberjaw</a></i> (1976-77).</p>
<p>During the 1970s in particular, most American television animation was produced by Hanna-Barbera. The only competition came from Filmation and <a href="/wiki/DePatie-Freleng_Enterprises" id="w">DePatie-Freleng Enterprises</a>, as well as occasional prime-time animated &#34;specials&#34; from <a href="/wiki/Rankin-Bass" id="w">Rankin-Bass</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chuck_Jones" id="w">Chuck Jones</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bill_Melendez" id="w">Bill Melendez</a>&#39;s adaptations of <i><a href="/wiki/Peanuts" id="w">Peanuts</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Quality_controversy" name="Quality_controversy"></a><h2>Quality controversy</h2>
<p>Over three decades, Hanna-Barbera produced prime-time, weekday afternoon, and <a href="/wiki/Saturday_morning_cartoons" id="w">Saturday morning cartoons</a> for all three major networks in the United States, and for syndication. The studio has been accused of contributing to the decrease in quality of animation and TV cartoons from the 1960s through the 1980s. However, the studio, and most other producers of American television animation, were forced to work with small budgets which did not allow for full theatrical-quality animation. At MGM, Hanna and Barbera spent between $40,000 and $50,000 to produce each seven-minute cartoon short, whereas they had less than $3,000 to spend on their first TV cartoons of equivalent length. The perception of cartoons as a &#34;kid&#39;s medium&#34; made them a low priority for television executives and advertisers. For example, one 22-minute (30 minutes with commercials) episode of <i><a href="/wiki/Josie_and_the_Pussycats_(TV_series)" id="w">Josie and the Pussycats</a></i> in 1970 had the same budget, $45,000, as an eight-minute <i><a href="/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry" id="w">Tom and Jerry</a></i> short from the late-1940s. Such budgetary constraints demanded a change in production values.</p>
<p>In a story published by <i><a href="/wiki/The_Saturday_Evening_Post" id="w">The Saturday Evening Post</a></i>, critics stated that Hanna-Barbera was taking on more work than they could handle and were resorting to shortcuts only a television audience would tolerate. An executive who worked for <a href="/wiki/Walt_Disney_Productions" id="w">Walt Disney Productions</a> said, &#34;We don&#39;t even consider [them] competition.&#34;<i> <span class="image"><img alt="http://dawsbutler.com/hb-article-web/hb-article-05.jpg" rel="nofollow" src="http://dawsbutler.com/hb-article-web/hb-article-05.jpg" /></span> Ironically, during the late 1950s and early 1960s Hanna-Barbera was the only animation studio in Hollywood that was actively hiring, and they picked up a number of Disney artists who were laid off during this period.</i></p>
<p>Hanna-Barbera introduced limited animation, popularized in theatrical animation by <a href="/wiki/United_Productions_of_America" id="w">United Productions of America</a>, on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Ruff_%26amp%3B_Reddy_Show" id="w">The Ruff &#38; Reddy Show</a></i> as a way of reducing costs.  This led to a reduction in animation quality, which was counteracted by a far greater emphasis on character design and posing, as well as scripted jokes and voice work.  The studio&#39;s solution to the resulting criticism was to go into features, producing both higher-quality versions of their TV cartoons (<i>Hey There, It&#39;s Yogi Bear!</i>, <i>The Man Called Flintstone</i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Jetsons:_The_Movie" id="w">Jetsons: The Movie</a></i> in 1990) and adaptations of other material (<i><a href="/wiki/Charlotte%26%2339%3Bs_Web_(1973_film)" id="w">Charlotte&#39;s Web</a></i> in 1973 and <i><a href="/wiki/Heidi" id="w">Heidi&#39;s Song</a></i> in 1982).</p>
<p>The field of American animation reached its low point in the mid-1970s, even as the audience for Saturday morning cartoons was at its peak. The strong focus on scripting and dialogue that had carried the earlier cartoons was more or less gone by 1973, as the studio&#39;s output had increased to the point that story quality had to take a backseat to production output. By this time, most Hanna-Barbera shows had degenerated into variations on but a few themes, with each successful formula (<i>The Flintstones</i>, <i>Scooby-Doo</i>, <i>SuperFriends</i>) milked dry through repetition. Various animation short-cuts became unfortunate Hanna-Barbera trademarks, such as plots being advanced by characters seen only as &#34;talking heads,&#34; and crashes and disasters happening just off the frame, heard but not seen. The soundtracks rather than the visuals carried the majority of the plot and humor of the cartoons. This era of H-B animation is frequently skewered by <a href="/wiki/Adult_Swim" id="w">Adult Swim</a> (most notably <i><a href="/wiki/Space_Ghost:_Coast_to_Coast" id="w">Space Ghost: Coast to Coast</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harvey_Birdman%2C_Attorney_at_Law" id="w">Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Sealab_2021" id="w">Sealab 2021</a></i>) and in many of <a href="/wiki/Robert_Smigel" id="w">Robert Smigel</a>&#39;s <i>&#34;<a href="/wiki/TV_Funhouse" id="w">TV Funhouse</a>&#34;</i> segments on <i><a href="/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" id="w">Saturday Night Live</a></i>.</p>
<a id="The_slow_rise_and_fall" name="The_slow_rise_and_fall"></a><h2>The slow rise and fall</h2>
<p>The state of the field of animation changed during the 1980s, thanks to competitors&#39; syndicated cartoon series based upon popular toys and action figures, including Filmation&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/He-Man_and_the_Masters_of_the_Universe" id="w">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe</a></i> and Rankin-Bass&#39; <i><a href="/wiki/Thundercats" id="w">Thundercats</a></i>. The Hanna-Barbera studio fell behind, as a new wave of animators and production studios introduced variety into the market for TV cartoons in the 1980s and 1990s. </p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s, Hanna-Barbera churned out shows based on familiar licensed properties like <i><a href="/wiki/The_Smurfs" id="w">The Smurfs</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Snorks" id="w">The Snorks</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Pac-Man_(TV_series)" id="w">Pac-Man</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dukes_of_Hazzard" id="w">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Shirt_Tales" id="w">Shirt Tales</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Happy_Days" id="w">Happy Days</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Laverne_and_Shirley" id="w">Laverne and Shirley</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Mork_and_Mindy" id="w">Mork and Mindy</a></i>, and  <i><a href="/wiki/GoBots" id="w">GoBots</a></i>, and also produced several ABC <i>Weekend Specials</i>. Some of their shows were produced at their Australian-based studio (a partnership with Australian media company Southern Star Entertainment), including <i><a href="/wiki/Drak_Pack" id="w">Drak Pack</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Wildfire_(1986_TV_series)" id="w">Wildfire</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Berenstain_Bears" id="w">The Berenstain Bears</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Teen_Wolf_(cartoon)" id="w">Teen Wolf</a></i>, and almost all of the <i><a href="/wiki/CBS_Storybreak" id="w">CBS Storybreak</a></i> specials. The studio also worked on other projects with less fanfare during the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as the direct-to-video series <i><a href="/wiki/The_Greatest_Adventure:_Stories_from_the_Bible" id="w">The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible</a></i>.</p>
<p>H-B also aligned themselves with <a href="/wiki/Ruby-Spears_Productions" id="w">Ruby-Spears Productions</a>, which was founded in 1977 by former H-B employees <a href="/wiki/Joe_Ruby" id="w">Joe Ruby</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ken_Spears" id="w">Ken Spears</a>. H-B&#39;s then-parent Taft Broadcasting purchased Ruby-Spears from <a href="/wiki/Filmways" id="w">Filmways</a> in 1981, and Ruby-Spears often paired their productions with Hanna-Barbera shows.</p>
<p>Following the lead of <a href="/wiki/CBS" id="w">CBS</a>&#39; hit 1984 Saturday morning cartoon series <i><a href="/wiki/Muppet_Babies" id="w">Muppet Babies</a></i>, which featured toddler versions of the popular Muppets characters, Hanna-Barbera began producing shows featuring &#34;kid&#34; versions of popular characters. These included <i><a href="/wiki/Pink_Panther_and_Sons" id="w">Pink Panther and Sons</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Flintstone_Kids" id="w">The Flintstone Kids</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Popeye_and_Son" id="w">Popeye and Son</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/A_Pup_Named_Scooby-Doo" id="w">A Pup Named Scooby-Doo</a></i>. In 1985, Hanna-Barbera launched <i><a href="/wiki/The_Funtastic_World_of_Hanna-Barbera" id="w">The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera</a></i>, a weekend-only program that introduced new versions of old favorites like <i>Yogi Bear</i>, <i>Jonny Quest</i>, <i>The Snorks</i>, and <i>Richie Rich</i> alongside brand new shows like <i><a href="/wiki/Galtar_and_the_Golden_Lance" id="w">Galtar and the Golden Lance</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Paw_Paw_Bears" id="w">Paw Paw Bears</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Max" id="w">Fantastic Max</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Midnight_Patrol" id="w">Midnight Patrol</a></i>. The following year, H-B started <i><a href="/wiki/Hanna-Barbera_Superstars_10" id="w">Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10</a></i>, a series of 10 original telefilms based on their popular stable of characters, including the popular crossover <i><a href="/wiki/The_Jetsons_Meet_the_Flintstones" id="w">The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones</a></i>.</p>
<p>Throughout all of this, both Hanna-Barbera and Ruby-Spears were subject to the financial troubles of parent company Taft Broadcasting, which had just been acquired by the American Financial Corporation in 1987 and had its name changed  to <i>Great American Broadcasting</i> the following year. H-B had gradually moved away from producing everything in-house, deciding instead to outsource some of the production to studios in <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Taiwan</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippines</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> (including studios like <a href="/wiki/Toei_Animation" id="w">Toei Animation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wang_Film_Productions" id="w">Wang Film Productions</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fil-Cartoon" id="w">Fil-Cartoon</a>). Hanna-Barbera in particular was also held down by the demands of TV networks, mainly ABC, who insisted on rehashing the <i>Scooby-Doo</i> formula many times over, as with <i><a href="/wiki/Captain_Caveman" id="w">Captain Caveman</a></i> and <i>Josie and the Pussycats</i>; this stifled creativity, leading many of the better writers and creative people to leave in 1989. They responded to a call from <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros." id="w">Warner Bros.</a> to resurrect <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros._Animation" id="w">their animation department</a>, ultimately developing <i><a href="/wiki/Tiny_Toon_Adventures" id="w">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Animaniacs" id="w">Animaniacs</a></i>.</p>
<a id="The_Turner_rebound" name="The_Turner_rebound"></a><h2>The Turner rebound</h2>
<p>In 1990, burdened with debt, Great American put both Hanna-Barbera and Ruby-Spears up for sale. In 1991, Hanna-Barbera and much of the original Ruby-Spears library were acquired by Turner Broadcasting.  </p>
<p>Turner&#39;s President of Entertainment <a href="/wiki/Scott_Sassa" id="w">Scott Sassa</a> turned to an unusual choice to lead the failing studio. <a href="/wiki/Fred_Seibert" id="w">Fred Seibert</a> was a cable television branding guru who had created the <a href="/wiki/MTV" id="w">MTV</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nickelodeon_(TV_channel)" id="w">Nickelodeon</a> branding and marketing, and had invented <a href="/wiki/Nick-at-Nite" id="w">Nick-at-Nite</a>, but he had never worked in cartoon production. He immediately filled the gap left by the departure of most of their creative crew during the Great American years with a new crop of animators, writers, and producers, including Pat Ventura, Donovan Cook, <a href="/wiki/Craig_McCracken" id="w">Craig McCracken</a>, <a href="/wiki/Genndy_Tartakovsky" id="w">Genndy Tartakovsky</a>, <a href="/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane" id="w">Seth MacFarlane</a>, David Feiss, Van Partible, and <a href="/wiki/Butch_Hartman" id="w">Butch Hartman</a> and new production head Buzz Potamkin. In 1992, the studio was renamed <i>H-B Productions Company</i>, changing its name once again to <i>Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc.</i> a year later.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Hanna-Barbera created more new cartoon shows like <i><a href="/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry_Kids" id="w">Tom and Jerry Kids</a></i> (and its spin-off, <i><a href="/wiki/Droopy:_Master_Detective" id="w">Droopy: Master Detective</a></i>) and <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Adventures_of_Captain_Planet" id="w">The New Adventures of Captain Planet</a></i> (a sequel to the original <a href="/wiki/DiC" id="w">DiC</a>/<a href="/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System" id="w">TBS Productions</a> series <i><a href="/wiki/Captain_Planet_and_the_Planeteers" id="w">Captain Planet and the Planeteers</a></i>),  and the ill-fated <i><a href="/wiki/Yo_Yogi!" id="w">Yo Yogi!</a></i>. They also introduced shows that were quite different from their previous releases, including <i><a href="/wiki/Wake%2C_Rattle%2C_and_Roll" id="w">Wake, Rattle, and Roll</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/2_Stupid_Dogs" id="w">2 Stupid Dogs</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Swat_Kats:_The_Radical_Squadron" id="w">Swat Kats: The Radical Squadron</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Pirates_of_Dark_Water" id="w">The Pirates of Dark Water</a></i>. In the mid-1990s, Hanna-Barbera and <a href="/wiki/Cartoon_Network" id="w">Cartoon Network</a> (which introduced many Hanna-Barbera shows to a new audience) launched Seibert&#39;s innovation, the back-to-the-future concept of cartoon shorts <i><a href="/wiki/World_Premiere_Toons" id="w">World Premiere Toons</a></i> (a.k.a. <i>What A Cartoon!</i>), which introduced a brand new stable of characters and, in a way, changed Hanna-Barbera forever.</p>
<p>The first original Cartoon Network series to emerge from the <i>World Premiere Toons</i> project was <a href="/wiki/Genndy_Tartakovsky" id="w">Genndy Tartakovsky</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Dexter%26%2339%3Bs_Laboratory" id="w">Dexter&#39;s Laboratory</a></i>. Others programs followed, including <i><a href="/wiki/Johnny_Bravo" id="w">Johnny Bravo</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Cow_and_Chicken" id="w">Cow and Chicken</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Powerpuff_Girls" id="w">The Powerpuff Girls</a></i>, the last series to use H-B&#39;s famous swirling star logo (first used in 1979). H-B also produced several new direct-to-video movies featuring Scooby-Doo (released by Warner Bros.) as well as a new <i>Jonny Quest</i> series, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Real_Adventures_of_Jonny_Quest" id="w">The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest</a></i>.</p>
<p>After the merger between Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner in 1996, the conglomerate had two separate animation studios in its possession. Though under a common ownership, Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. Animation operated separately until 1998. That year, the Hanna-Barbera building was closed and the studio was moved to the Warner Bros. Animation lot at <a href="/wiki/Sherman_Oaks%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California" id="w">Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, California</a>.</p>

Around 1998, the Hanna-Barbera name began to disappear from the newer shows from the studio in favor of the <b>Cartoon Network Studios</b> name. This came in handy with shows that were produced outside of Hanna-Barbera, but Cartoon Network had a hand in producing, like <a href="/wiki/A.k.a._Cartoon" id="w">a.k.a. Cartoon</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Ed%2C_Edd%2C_and_Eddy" id="w">Ed, Edd, and Eddy</a></i>, Kino Films&#39; <i><a href="/wiki/Mike%2C_Lu_and_Og" id="w">Mike, Lu and Og</a></i>, and <a href="/wiki/Curious_Pictures" id="w">Curious Pictures</a>&#39; <i><a href="/wiki/Sheep_in_the_Big_City" id="w">Sheep in the Big City</a></i>, as well as the shows the studio continued to produce, like <i><a href="/wiki/The_Grim_Adventures_of_Billy_and_Mandy" id="w">The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Samurai_Jack" id="w">Samurai Jack</a></i> and various original Cartoon Network shows. This is in spite of the fact that the Cartoon Network Studios brand name was created to produce the first season of <i>Dexter&#39;s Laboratory</i> (ironically, the brand name would return to the show when it was revived in 2001).</p>
<p>When William Hanna died on March 22, 2001, an era was over. The last official Hanna-Barbera production was <i><a href="/wiki/Scooby-Doo_and_the_Cyber_Chase" id="w">Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase</a></i>, for which was Hanna was the dedicatee; the actual production was to Warner Bros. Animation. After 2001, Hanna-Barbera was completely absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation and further Cartoon Network projects were handled by Cartoon Network Studios. Joseph Barbera continued to work for Warner Bros. Animation on projects relating to Hanna-Barbera and Tom &#38; Jerry properties until his death on December 18, 2006.</p>
<p>Though the Hanna-Barbera name remains on the copyright notices of new productions based on &#34;classic&#34; properties like the Flintstones, Scooby-Doo, and others, the studio that produces it is Warner Bros. Animation (generally, although Cartoon Network Studios has occasionally handled production); whereas most Cartoon Network series previously produced by Hanna-Barbera are copyrighted by the channel itself.</p>
<a id="Syndication_and_distribution" name="Syndication_and_distribution"></a><h2>Syndication and distribution</h2>
<p>From 1957 to 1966, Hanna-Barbera cartoons were distributed to television by <a href="/wiki/Screen_Gems" id="w">Screen Gems</a>, the TV arm of <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" id="w">Columbia Pictures</a>. Upon <a href="/wiki/Taft_Broadcasting" id="w">Taft Broadcasting</a>&#39;s acquisition of Hanna-Barbera in 1966, Hanna-Barbera&#39;s productions were distributed by then-sister company <a href="/wiki/Worldvision_Enterprises" id="w">Worldvision Enterprises</a> (since 1979, the year Worldvision was acquired by Taft), with the exception of select material such as licensed properties.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Turner_Program_Services" id="w">Turner Program Services</a> assumed syndication rights in 1991 after Turner Entertainment purchased the company, an arrangement which continued until the 1997 Turner-Time Warner merger. TPS was folded into <a href="/wiki/Telepictures" id="w">Telepictures Distribution</a>, which handled the works produced by Hanna-Barbera (and, as a rule, other select non-Warner Bros.-produced material as well).</p>
<p>Today, all Hanna-Barbera properties under Time Warner control are distributed by <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros._Television_Distribution" id="w">Warner Bros. Television Distribution</a>, although some of the shows still carry either a Turner or Telepictures logo.</p>

<a id="The_Hanna-Barbera_sound_effects" name="The_Hanna-Barbera_sound_effects"></a><h1>The Hanna-Barbera sound effects</h1>
Besides their cartoons and characters, Hanna-Barbera was also famous for their vast library of sound effects. Besides cartoon-style sound effects (such as ricochets, slide whistles and more), they also had familiar sounds used for transportation, household items, the elements, and more. 

When Hanna and Barbera started their own cartoon studio in 1957, they created a handful of sound effects, and had limited choices. They also took some sounds from the then-defunct MGM animation studios. By 1958, they began to expand and began adding more sound effects to their library. Besides creating a lot of their own effects, they also collected sound effects from other movie and cartoon studios, such as Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. Animation, and even Walt Disney Productions.

Some of their famous sound effects included a rapid bongo drum take used for when a character&#39;s feet were scrambling before taking off, a &#34;KaBONG&#34; sound produced on a guitar for when <a href="/wiki/Quick_Draw_McGraw" id="w">Quick Draw McGraw</a> would smash a guitar over a villain&#39;s head, the sound of a car&#39;s brake drum combined with a bulb horn for when <a href="/wiki/Fred_Flintstone" id="w">Fred Flintstone</a> would drop his bowling ball onto his foot, an automobile&#39;s tires squealing with a &#34;skipping&#34; effect added for when someone would slide to a sudden stop, a bass drum and cymbal combination for when someone would fall down or smack into an object, a xylophone being struck rapidly on the same note for a tip-toeing effect, and a violin being plucked with the tuning pegs being raised to simulate something like pulling out a cat&#39;s whisker. The cartoons also used <a href="/wiki/Castle_thunder_(sound_effect)" id="w">Castle Thunder</a>, a well-known thunder-and-lightning sound effect.

In the 1980s, Hanna-Barbera slowly began to cease using their trademark sound effects. This was especially true with the action cartoons of the time such as <i><a href="/wiki/Sky_Commanders" id="w">Sky Commanders</a></i>. By the 1990s, with cartoons such as <i><a href="/wiki/Fish_Police" id="w">Fish Police</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Swat_Kats" id="w">Swat Kats</a></i> and the animated telefilm <i><a href="/wiki/Scooby-Doo_in_Arabian_Nights" id="w">Arabian Nights</a></i>, the sound effects were virtually nonexistent, being replaced with newer, digitally-recorded sounds, as well as other cartoon sound effects such as the <i>Looney Tunes</i> sound library. A few early 1990s cartoons continued to use the sound effects, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry_Kids" id="w">Tom and Jerry Kids</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Gravedale_High" id="w">Gravedale High</a></i>. By 1996, each cartoon from the company had its own set of sound effects, including some selected from the classic H-B sound library, as well as some new ones and various sounds from Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons. Several of the classic H-B sound effects still pop up from time to time in Cartoon Network Studios&#39; productions. However, on <i><a href="/wiki/What%26%2339%3Bs_New%2C_Scooby-Doo%3F" id="w">What&#39;s New, Scooby-Doo?</a></i> and many of the direct-to-video <i>Scooby-Doo</i> animated movies, the Hanna-Barbera sound effects are very rarely used. Exceptions were two direct-to-video movies from 2002-2003, <i>Scooby-Doo and the Legend of the Vampire</i> and <i>Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico</i>, which extensively uses the H-B sound effects, along with remixes of the original 1969 <i>Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!</i> background music and the original voice cast (sans the departed <a href="/wiki/Don_Messick" id="w">Don Messick</a>). This was soon quickly dropped. However, <i><a href="/wiki/Shaggy_%26amp%3B_Scooby-Doo_Get_a_Clue!" id="w">Shaggy &#38; Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!</a></i> seemed to use the H-B sound effects more often than the previous series did.

However, since the 1960s, several other cartoon studios have used the sound effects, including, but not limited to, Filmation, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, DiC Entertainment, Film Roman, Spumco, Nickelodeon Animation Studios and many others. By the 21st century, almost every animation studio was using the sound effects. Nowadays, like Hanna-Barbera, they are used sparingly, while some cartoons like Warner Bros. Animation&#39;s <i>Krypto the Superdog</i> and Spumco&#39;s <i>Ren and Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon</i> make heavy use of the classic sound effects, mostly for a retro feel. The hit FOX show <i>Family Guy</i> has also utilized Hanna-Barbera sound effects on several occasions, mostly to parody Hanna-Barbera itself. Also, the popular PC adventure game <i>The Neverhood</i> extensively used the Hanna-Barbera sound effects, such as when Klaymen would walk, the footsteps of Fred Flintstone could be heard.

The Hanna-Barbera Sound Effects were not originally available to the public or other sound editors, although some Hanna-Barbera sounds show up in various sound libraries such as Valentino and Audio Network. H-B released a seven-LP record set in 1986 entitled <i>The Hanna-Barbera Library of Sounds</i>, which contained many of the classic effects. However, in 1993, the last President of the studio, <a href="/wiki/Fred_Seibert" id="w">Fred Seibert</a> recalled his early production experiences with early LP releases of the studio&#39;s effects and commissioned Sound Ideas released a four-CD set entitled <i>The Hanna-Barbera Sound FX Library,</i> featuring almost all of the original H-B sound effects used from 1957 to 1992 (including the sounds H-B had borrowed from other studios). The sound effects were digitally remastered, making them suitable on new digital soundtracks. A fifth CD was added in 1996, entitled <i>Hanna-Barbera Lost Treasures</i>, and featured more sound effects, including sounds from <i>Space Ghost</i> and <i>The Impossibles</i>.
