<p><b>Glenrothes</b> is a town situated in the centre of <a href="/wiki/Fife" id="w">Fife</a>, in east central <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>. It is approximately equidistant between <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" id="w">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dundee" id="w">Dundee</a>. Glenrothes was the second <a href="/wiki/New_town#United Kingdom" id="w">new town</a> to be designated in Scotland under the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1946. It was established in 1948 and was created to attract new employment and population to mid-Fife with the creation of the Rothes Colliery, a major <a href="/wiki/Coal_mine" id="w">coal mine</a>. The pit closed in 1961, only 4 years into production because of unstemmable flooding problems and a decline in coal requirements nationwide. Today Glenrothes has a population of 38,679 people based on the 2001 census, is the administrative centre for Fife and has been successful in attracting employment, in particular a high number of modern industrial companies. The town has beautiful parks and landscaping, a plethora of sculptures and artworks and one of Scotland&#39;s largest indoor shopping malls. The town also has a variety of religious and educational institutions and has good transport links with the rest of Scotland.</p>

Glenrothes was designated in 1948 under the New Towns (Scotland) Act 1946. The original plan was to build a town for a population of 32,000-35,000 people. The land where Glenrothes now sits was largely agricultural and once contained a number of small farming communities. Originally the new town was going to be centred on <a href="/wiki/Markinch" id="w">Markinch</a>, however the village&#39;s infrastructure was deemed unable to withstand the substantial growth required to realise a new town. <a href="/wiki/Leslie" id="w">Leslie</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thornton" id="w">Thornton</a> were also considered but as a consequence an area of 5,370 acres that sits between all of these villages was chosen. The land taken was previously an area of great natural beauty much of which was farm land. The policies of Balbirnie House, Leslie House, Balgeddie House falling under the land ownerships of the Balfour, Rothes, Aytoun and Balgonie estates were all incorporated in the Glenrothes designated area. <sup id="_ref-A History of Glenrothes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A History of Glenrothes" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" title="">[2]</a></sup>
The land was sub-divided into areas or &#34;precincts&#34; which were named after the hamlets already established (e.g. Woodside, Cadham), the farms which once occupied the land (e.g. Rimbleton, Caskieberran, Collydean) or historical stately homes in the area (e.g. Balgeddie, <a href="/wiki/Glenrothes#Pictures" id="w">Balbirnie</a>, Leslie Parks). <sup id="_ref-A History of Glenrothes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A History of Glenrothes" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The name Rothes comes from the association with the north-east Scotland Earl of Rothes, family name Leslie. The Leslie family owned much of the land historically. <a href="/wiki/Glen" id="w">Glen</a> (Scottish for valley) was added to prevent confusion with <a href="/wiki/Rothes" id="w">Rothes</a> in <a href="/wiki/Moray" id="w">Moray</a>, and because the town lies on the <a href="/wiki/Leven%2C_Fife" id="w">Leven</a> valley. <sup id="_ref-A History of Glenrothes_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A History of Glenrothes" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" title="">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" title="">[3]</a></sup><div style="wigth:200px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:200px-Cadham_Village.JPG" title="Cadham Village, built pre-Glenrothes"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200px-Cadham_Village.JPG" alt="Cadham Village, built pre-Glenrothes" title="Cadham Village, built pre-Glenrothes" class="location-left type-thumb" width="200px" />

<p>The primary reason for the designation of Glenrothes was to house miners who where to work at a new super coal mine. This was to be the most modern of the day and was built west of Thornton, an established village south of Glenrothes. The Super Pit was named the Rothes Colliery and it was officially opened by the Queen in 1957. About 5,000 miners were to be required to produce 5,000 tonnes of coal per day, and huge railway yards were established. The pit was to have a working life of 100 years. The planned long-term benefits were to be huge, and the driver for economic regeneration for central Fife. In 1961, 4 years after opening, the huge investment was written off and the mine run down because of un-stemmable flooding. Ironically, miners who&#39;d worked in older deep pits in the area had fore-warned against the development of the Rothes Pit for this very reason. The state-of-the art engineering and design was closed, leaving the huge enclosed concrete wheel-towers standing at Thornton for many years as a forlorn symbol of the collapse. <sup id="_ref-A History of Glenrothes_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A History of Glenrothes" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Originally the main industry in the Glenrothes area was paper-making (Tullis-Russell and the other mills along the Leven Valley) and <a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" id="w">coal mining</a>.

It was however populated in the early 1950s in large part by mining families moving from the West of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>, particularly the <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" id="w">Glasgow</a> area, though many re-settled from the declining <a href="/wiki/Lothian" id="w">Lothian</a> coalfields too. <sup id="_ref-A History of Glenrothes_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A History of Glenrothes" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>

The pit&#39;s closure was devastating and further development of Glenrothes was almost stopped. The pit&#39;s closure did help change the fortunes of the town for the better. Central Government changed the town&#39;s role and appointed Glenrothes as one of the economic focal points for Central Scotland. As a result a plethora of modern electronics factories moved into the town. The first big overseas electronic investor was Beckmans Industries in 1959 followed by Hughes Industries in early 1960s. A number of other important companies followed and Glenrothes became a major hub in Scotland&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Glen" id="w">Silicon Glen</a>. <sup id="_ref-A History of Glenrothes_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A History of Glenrothes" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-An Essay for Today- The Scottish New Towns 1947-1997" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>A further boost to the town during the 1970s saw it become the centre of Fife Council&#39;s operations.  This took the role from <a href="/wiki/Cupar" id="w">Cupar</a> which was formally the County Town of Fife. Fife House (the headquarters of Fife Council) and other Fife Council buildings are situated in Glenrothes&#39; town centre. <a href="/wiki/Fife_Constabulary" id="w">Fife Constabulary</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Enterprise" id="w">Scottish Enterprise</a> Fife also have their headquarters in the town.

<a id="Glenrothes_Development_Corporation" name="Glenrothes_Development_Corporation"></a><h2>Glenrothes Development Corporation</h2>

<p>The planning, development, management and promotion of Glenrothes was the responsibility of the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC), a <a href="/wiki/Quango" id="w">quango</a> appointed by the <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland" id="w">Secretary of State for Scotland</a>.

<p>The GDC was wound up in 1995, and was asked to undertake any last major works required in the town with the aid of a grant. The Leven Bridge crossing Riverside Park and the Kingdom Centre Phase 4, including the Rothes Halls were some of the last major projects undertaken. Property and assets of the town were either sold off to private companies or passed onto the responsibility of Fife Council. The winding up of the GDC meant that Glenrothes was no longer designated a new town. Development and management of the town would now be undertaken by Fife Council. The development corporation left its lasting legacy on the town by overseeing the development of 15,378 houses, 480,692 square metres of industrial floorspace, 68,328 square metres of office floorspace and 53,603 square metres of shopping floorspace by <a href="/wiki/31_December" id="w">31 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a>. <sup id="_ref-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

The historical stately homes, Balbirnie House, Leslie House and Balgeddie House are all located in Glenrothes. Balbirnie House, former home of the Balfour family, was occupied by the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC) between 1981 until its wind up in 1996. The grounds of the mansion house were bought and developed in 1969 by the GDC to become Balbirnie Park and golf course. The former stable block of the house has been developed as the Balbirnie craft centre and Balbirnie House itself is now a luxury hotel.

Glenrothes&#39; layout was based on an irregular grid. The first town masterplan set out self-contained residential precincts with their own primary schools, local shops and community facilities. However, not each precinct got every item on the list such as Primary Schools and Shopping Facilities. Industry was to be separated from the housing areas in planned industrial estates. &#34;Through traffic&#34; would bypass housing precincts by distributor roads which would connect each precinct to a purposely designed town centre and to the industrial estates. At first Glenrothes developed in a linear fashion starting at Woodside in the east and progressing westwards. Housing was a mixture of low-rise mixed housing and flats. The first masterplan was implemented as far as South Parks and Rimbleton housing precincts. <sup id="_ref-A History of Glenrothes_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A History of Glenrothes" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A New Town's Heritage, Glenrothes 1948-1995" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>

A second town masterplan was designed in the 1960&#39;s following Glenrothes&#39; change of role and was to accommodate an increased population target of 50,000-70,000. New areas of land in the north and south of the designated area were brought into production for new development. The irregular grid layout was retained however housing precincts were to become less self-contained and would share local facilities in a new neighbourhood centre format. The road network was to be upgraded to deal with projected increases in car ownership. New housing estates were developed in the west, south and then northern parts of the town. The precincts of the 1960s and 70&#39;s, developed under the second masterplan, were based on principles of <a href="/wiki/Radburn" id="w">Radburn</a>, separating as far as possible footpaths from roads.

Glenrothes <a href="/wiki/Town_centre" id="w">town centre</a> is located on the southern lip of the Leven Valley. It is bounded by a ring road, has been <a href="/wiki/Town_planning" id="w">purposely planned</a>, contains no residential element and is largely enclosed.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_Shopping_Centre" id="w"> Kingdom Centre</a> forms the main shopping element of the town centre. The centre is popular locally, a fact demonstrated by it having some of the highest levels of footfall in Fife. <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The shopping mall currently contains over 100 shops as well as a variety of cafes, the town&#39;s central library, the Rothes Halls- the town&#39;s theatre and a ten pin bowling alley. The town&#39;s main bus station is located adjacent to the southeast end of the mall.</p>
<p>Shopping in Glenrothes is to be significantly enhanced in the near future with major expansion of the Kingdom Centre proposed at North Street. A <a href="/wiki/Sainsbury%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">Sainsbury&#39;s</a> superstore (one of the largest stores proposed in Scotland) along with non-food shopping and a new multi-storey car park are proposed as part of the development. <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Proposals have also been put forward to regenerate older phases of the mall at Albany Gate and a further retail extension is proposed at Marchmont Gate. <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
