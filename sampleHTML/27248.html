According to tradition, Marino left the Adriatic island of <a href="/wiki/Rab" id="w">Rab</a> (Italian: <i>Arbe</i>) with his lifelong friend Leo and went to the town of <a href="/wiki/Rimini" id="w">Rimini</a> as a stone worker. After persecution because of his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby <a href="/wiki/Monte_Titano" id="w">Monte Titano</a>, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and the state of San Marino. The official date of foundation of the Republic is <a href="/wiki/3_September" id="w">3 September</a> <a href="/wiki/301" id="w">301</a>.</p>
<p>By the mid-5th century, a community was formed; because of its relatively inaccessible location and its poverty, it has succeeded, with a few brief interruptions, in maintaining its independence. In 1631 its independence was recognized by the papacy.

During the early phase of the <a href="/wiki/Italian_unification" id="w">Italian unification</a> process of the 19th century, San Marino served as a haven of refuge for numerous persons who were persecuted because of their support for the unification. In memory of this support, <a href="/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi" id="w">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a> accepted the wish of San Marino not to be incorporated into the new Italian state. <a href="/wiki/Napoleon" id="w">Napoleon</a> refused to take the country. He commented, &#34;Why, it&#39;s a model republic!&#34;</p>
<p>The government of San Marino made <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> President <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" id="w">Abraham Lincoln</a> an honorary citizen.  He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that &#34;government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring.&#34;<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, Italy declared war on <a href="/wiki/Austria-Hungary" id="w">Austria-Hungary</a> on 23 May 1915. San Marino declared war with Austria-Hungary on 3 June 1915.
<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> San Marino did not join Italy in declaring war on the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> in 1940.

Later, <a href="/wiki/Axis_powers_of_World_War_II" id="w">Axis forces</a> retreated through the country and were pursued by the American and British forces.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Head_of_state" id="w">head of state</a> is a committee (council) of two captains-regent.

San Marino is divided into the following nine municipalities, known locally as <i>Castelli</i> -castles- (sing. <i>castello</i>, each on a different hill, as depicted on the republic&#39;s coat of arms), that are also towns to the world. </p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/San_Marino%2C_San_Marino" id="w">The City of San Marino</a></b> (<i>Città di San Marino</i>) is the <a href="/wiki/Eponymous" id="w">eponymous</a> capital. There are also eight minor municipalities: </li></ul>

The Politics of San Marino takes place in a framework of a <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_system" id="w">parliamentary</a> <a href="/wiki/Representative_democracy" id="w">representative democratic</a> <a href="/wiki/Republic" id="w">republic</a>, whereby the <a href="/wiki/Captain_regent" id="w">Captains Regent</a> are the <a href="/wiki/Head_of_state" id="w">heads of state</a>, and of a pluriform multi-party system. <a href="/wiki/Executive_power" id="w">Executive power</a> is exercised by the <a href="/wiki/Government" id="w">government</a>. <a href="/wiki/Legislative_power" id="w">Legislative power</a> is vested in both the government and the <a href="/wiki/Grand_and_General_Council" id="w">Grand and General Council</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Judiciary" id="w">judiciary</a> is independent of the executive and the legislature.</p>
<p>San Marino was originally led by the <a href="/wiki/Arengo" id="w">Arengo</a>, initially formed with the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Great and General Council. In <a href="/wiki/1243" id="w">1243</a>, the first two <a href="/wiki/Captain_regent" id="w">Captains Regent</a> were nominated by the Council. This method of nomination is still in use today, <a href="/wiki/As_of_2007" id="w">as of 2007</a>. </p>
<p>The legislature of the republic is the <a href="/wiki/Grand_and_General_Council" id="w">Grand and General Council</a> (<i>Consiglio grande e generale</i>).  The Council is a unicameral legislature which has 60 members with elections occurring every 5 years under a proportional representation system in all nine administrative districts.  These districts (townships) correspond to the old <a href="/wiki/Parish" id="w">parishes</a> of the republic.  <a href="/wiki/Citizen" id="w">Citizens</a> eighteen years or older are eligible to vote.  Besides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the Captains Regent, the State Congress (composed of 10 Secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the <a href="/wiki/Judicial_branch" id="w">judicial branch</a> during the period of legislature of the Council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions.  The Council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The Council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of 15 councilors which examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the Council.

Every 6 months, the Council elects two Captains Regent to be the heads of state. The Regents are chosen from opposing parties so there is a balance of power. They serve a 6-month term. The investiture of the Captains Regent takes place on <a href="/wiki/April_1" id="w">April 1</a> and <a href="/wiki/October_1" id="w">October 1</a> in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have 3 days in which to file complaints about the Captains&#39; activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.</p>
<p>The practice of multiple heads of state, as well as the frequent re-election of the heads of state, are derived directly from the customs of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic" id="w">Roman Republic</a>. The Council is equivalent to the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Senate" id="w">Roman Senate</a>; the Captains Regent, to the <a href="/wiki/Consul" id="w">consuls</a> of ancient <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Rome</a>.</p>
<p>San Marino is a multi-party <a href="/wiki/Democratic" id="w">democratic</a> <a href="/wiki/Republic" id="w">republic</a>. The two main parties are the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Christian_Party_of_San_Marino" id="w">Democratic Christian Party of San Marino</a> (PDCS) and the <a href="/wiki/Party_of_Socialists_and_Democrats" id="w">Party of Socialists and Democrats</a> (PSD, a merger of the <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_San_Marino" id="w">Socialist Party of San Marino</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Party_of_Democrats" id="w">Party of Democrats</a>) in addition to several other smaller parties. Due to the small size of San Marino and its low population, it is difficult for any party to gain a pure majority and most of the time the government is run by a coalition. As a result of the June 2001 election, the PDCS and PSS control a majority of seats in the Council.</p>

The corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 19 percent. Capital gains are subject to a five percent tax; interest is subject to a 13 percent withholding tax. </p>
<p>In 1972, a valued added taxation (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and was applied in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. In addition, a tax on imported goods, to be levied by San Marino, was established. Such taxes, however, were not, and are not, applied to national products. Until 1996, goods manufactured and sold in San Marino were not subject to indirect taxation.</p>
<p>Under the European Union customs agreement, San Marino continues to levy taxes, the equivalent of an import duty, on imported goods. Also, a general VAT was introduced, in replacement of the Italian VAT.</p>

San Marino has one of the smallest military forces in the world. National defence in the face of an aggressive world power is, by arrangement, the responsibility of <a href="/wiki/Military_of_Italy" id="w">Italy&#39;s armed forces</a>.  Different branches have varied functions including: performing ceremonial duties; patrolling borders; mounting guard at government buildings; and assisting police in major criminal cases. </p>
<a id="Crossbow_Corps" name="Crossbow_Corps"></a><h2>Crossbow Corps</h2>
<p>Although once at the heart of San Marino&#39;s army, the Crossbow Corps is now an entirely ceremonial force of about 80 volunteer soldiers. The Crossbow Corps since 1295 has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform is medieval in design, and although it is a statutory military unit, it has no actual military function today.</p>

The Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them. In their role as Fortress Guards they are also responsible for the guarding of the Palazzo Pubblico in <a href="/wiki/San_Marino%2C_San_Marino" id="w">San Marino City</a>, which is the seat of national Government. In this role they are the forces most visible to tourists, and known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard. Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as &#39;Criminal Police Officers&#39; (in addition to their military role) and act to assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is distinctively red and green in color. </p>

The Guard of the Council Great and General commonly known as The Guard of the Council or locally as the  &#39;Guard of Nobles&#39;, formed in 1740, are a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue white and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the Council are to protect the <a href="/wiki/Captains_Regent" id="w">Captains Regent</a>, and to defend the Great and General Council during its formal sessions. They also provide a ceremonial bodyguard to government officials on festivals of both state and church.</p>
<a id="The_Army_Militia" name="The_Army_Militia"></a><h2>The Army Militia</h2>
<p>In former times all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Army Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.</p>
<p>The uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulettes, and white decorated cuffs.</p>
<a id="The_Military_Ensemble" name="The_Military_Ensemble"></a><h2>The Military Ensemble</h2>
<p>Formally this is part of the Army Militia, and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of around 50 musicians. The uniform is largely similar to that of the Army Militia itself. The music of the Military Ensemble accompanies most state occasions in the republic.</p>
<a id="The_Gendarmerie" name="The_Gendarmerie"></a><h2>The Gendarmerie</h2>
<p>Established in 1842, the Gendarmerie of San Marino is a militarised police service. Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and their property, and for the preservation of law and order.</p>
<p>The entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the <i>Corpi Militari Volontari</i>, or Voluntary Military Force.</p>

{{Main}}
There are 220 km of <a href="/wiki/Highway" id="w">highways</a> in the country, the main road being the <a href="/wiki/San_Marino_Superhighway" id="w">San Marino Superhighway</a>. Roads are well used by private car drivers. Sammarinese authorities license private vehicles with distinctive licence plates which are white with blue figures with the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers.  Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is &#34;RSM&#34;.</p>
<p>There are no airports in San Marino, but there is an international <a href="/wiki/Heliport" id="w">heliport</a> located in Borgo Maggiore. Most tourists who arrive by air land at <a href="/wiki/Federico_Fellini_International_Airport" id="w">Federico Fellini International Airport</a> close to the city of <a href="/wiki/Rimini" id="w">Rimini</a> and then make the transfer by bus.</p>
<p>Two rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no major port or <a href="/wiki/Harbour" id="w">harbour</a>.</p>
<a id="Public_transport" name="Public_transport"></a><h2>Public transport</h2>

<p>San Marino has limited public transport facilities. There is a regular <a href="/wiki/Bus" id="w">bus</a> service between <a href="/wiki/Rimini" id="w">Rimini</a> and the city of San Marino, popular with both tourists and <a href="/wiki/Tourist_industry" id="w">tourist industry</a> workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately twenty advertised locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at Rimini railway station and San Marino coach station, respectively.</p>
<p>A limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi operating companies in the republic<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>, and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.</p>
<p>There is a 1.5 km <a href="/wiki/Aerial_tramway" id="w">aerial tramway</a> connecting the <a href="/wiki/City" id="w">city</a> of <a href="/wiki/San_Marino%2C_San_Marino" id="w">San Marino</a> on top of <a href="/wiki/Monte_Titano" id="w">Monte Titano</a> with <a href="/wiki/Borgo_Maggiore" id="w">Borgo Maggiore</a>, a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. Indeed, for the tourist visitor the aerial tramway gives the best available views of Borgo Maggiore, as the cars sweep low over the rooftops of the main town square. From here a further connection is available to the nation&#39;s largest settlement, <a href="/wiki/Dogana%2C_San_Marino" id="w">Dogana</a>, by means of local bus service.

</p>
<p>Two aerial tramway cars, known as gondolas, and numbered &#39;1&#39; and &#39;2&#39;, operate in opposition on a cable, and a service is provided at roughly fifteen minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, being a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.</p>
<a id="Railway" name="Railway"></a><h2>Railway</h2>
<p>Today there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period prior to <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, it had a single narrow-gauge line, connecting the country with the Italian rail network at <a href="/wiki/Rimini" id="w">Rimini</a>. Due the difficulties in accessing the capital, <a href="/wiki/San_Marino%2C_San_Marino" id="w">San Marino City</a> (which has a mountain-top location), the terminus station was to be located at the village of <a href="/wiki/Valdragone" id="w">Valdragone</a> but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June <a href="/wiki/1932" id="w">1932</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>
An advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and well used, but was almost completely destroyed during the fighting in this region during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>. Many disused artifacts such as bridges, tunnels and stations are still well visible today and in some cases have been refurbished and converted to parks, public footpaths or traffic routes.</p>
<a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h1> Culture </h1>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Three_Towers_of_San_Marino" id="w">Three Towers of San Marino</a>  are located on the three peaks of <a href="/wiki/Monte_Titano" id="w">Monte Titano</a> in the capital. They are depicted on both the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_San_Marino" id="w">Flag of San Marino</a> and its <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_Arms_of_San_Marino" id="w">coat of arms</a>. The three towers are: <i>Guaita</i>, the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the eleventh century); the thirteenth-century <i>Cesta</i>, located on the highest of Monte Titano&#39;s summits; and the fourteenth-century <i>Montale</i>, on the smallest of Monte Titano&#39;s summits, still privately owned.</p>
<p>San Marino has a famous <a href="/wiki/Cake" id="w">cake</a> known as <i>La Torta Di Tre Monti</i> (&#34;Cake of the Three Mountains/Towers&#34;), similar to a layered wafer cake covered in <a href="/wiki/Chocolate" id="w">Chocolate</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Love_Orchestra" id="w">Love Orchestra</a>, a new age pop band, comes from the Republic of St. Marino. During concerts overseas, the San Marino flag is shown on the stage.</p>

<a href="/wiki/San_Marino" id="w">San Marino</a>, along with <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>, enjoys <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">football (soccer)</a> as its most popular sport.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Campionato_Sammarinese_di_Calcio" id="w">San Marino Championship</a>, founded under the auspices of the FSGC (<a href="/wiki/San_Marino_Football_Federation" id="w">San Marino Football Federation</a>), is the premier footballing competition in San Marino. The fifteen teams that take part in the competition are split into two groups of eight and seven teams. The top three from each section at the end of the regular season progress into a semi-knockout style Championship Playoff. Prior to 2007, the playoff champion earned a spot in the preliminary rounds of the <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Cup" id="w">UEFA Cup</a>.  In 2007, <a href="/wiki/UEFA" id="w">UEFA</a> granted San Marino a spot in the 1st Qualifying Round of the <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League" id="w">Champions League</a>.  2007 league champions <a href="/wiki/S.S._Murata" id="w">S.S. Murata</a> was the first team to represent San Marino in the Champions League when they participated in the <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League_2007-08" id="w">2007-08 competition</a>, losing to Finland&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Tampere" id="w">Tampere</a> team. San Marino also has a representative in the Italian system, with <a href="/wiki/San_Marino_Calcio" id="w">San Marino Calcio</a> playing in the third tier of Italian football, <a href="/wiki/Serie_C2" id="w">Serie C2/B</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/San_Marino_national_football_team" id="w">San Marino national team</a> played its first unofficial international match in <a href="/wiki/1986" id="w">1986</a>, in which it suffered a 0-1 defeat to the Canadian <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Games" id="w">Olympic</a> team. Its first competitive outing was on <a href="/wiki/November_14" id="w">November 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a>, a 0-4 loss against <a href="/wiki/Switzerland_national_football_team" id="w">Switzerland</a> in the <a href="/wiki/European_Football_Championship" id="w">European Championship</a> qualifier. These defeats set the tone for most of the following outings of the team, who are regarded as whipping boys in the qualifying sections of the European Championship and the <a href="/wiki/Football_World_Cup" id="w">World Cup</a>.

They had a brief moment of glory when they faced <a href="/wiki/England_national_football_team" id="w">England</a> in a World Cup qualifier on <a href="/wiki/November_17" id="w">November 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1993" id="w">1993</a> and took the lead through <a href="/wiki/Davide_Gualtieri" id="w">Davide Gualtieri</a> after just 8.3 seconds - still the fastest goal in World Cup competition <a class="externallink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3952361" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3952361">http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3952361</a>. Despite this goal, only San Marino&#39;s third at international level, the microstate went on to lose 7-1.</p>
<p>Until recently, San Marino&#39;s international record was one of almost total failure, with famous draws against <a href="/wiki/Turkey_national_football_team" id="w">Turkey</a> and <a href="/wiki/Latvia_national_football_team" id="w">Latvia</a> being the only partial successes in an international career that contains over 70 defeats. However, on the <a href="/wiki/29_April" id="w">29 April</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, San Marino recorded their first ever win, with a 1-0 victory over Liechtenstein in an international friendly. <a href="/wiki/Andy_Selva" id="w">Andy Selva</a> scored the only goal in a close game that finally gave this tiny republic a footballing victory.</p>
<p>On September 6, 2006, San Marino suffered their biggest ever defeat, losing 13-0 to world giants <a href="/wiki/Germany_national_football_team" id="w">Germany</a> in the Stadio Olimpico. It was also the largest goal margin defeat in European Championship Qualifying history.
In the same competition on February 7th 2007, they came within 8 seconds of the best result in their history. They were level at 1-1 with the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_national_soccer_team" id="w"> Republic of Ireland</a> after 94 minutes when <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Ireland" id="w">Stephen Ireland</a> scored within 8 seconds of the final whistle. The goal scored by San Marino was their European Qualifying first goal since losing 4-1 to <a href="/wiki/Austria_national_football_team" id="w">Austria</a> in 1998.</p>
<p>As of May 2007, San Marino is 195th in the FIFA world rankings.</p>
<p>One of the <a href="/wiki/Formula_One" id="w">Formula One</a> races, the <a href="/wiki/San_Marino_Grand_Prix" id="w">San Marino Grand Prix</a>, is named after the state, although it does not actually take place there.  It takes place at the <a href="/wiki/Autodromo_Enzo_e_Dino_Ferrari" id="w">Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari</a> in the Italian town of <a href="/wiki/Imola" id="w">Imola</a>, about 100 km northwest of San Marino, along the <a href="/wiki/Via_Emilia" id="w">Via Emilia</a>.
The race was etched in infamy after two fatal accidents occurred at the <a href="/wiki/1994_San_Marino_Grand_Prix" id="w">1994 Grand Prix</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Ayrton_Senna" id="w">Ayrton Senna</a> and <a href="/wiki/Roland_Ratzenberger" id="w">Roland Ratzenberger</a> were <a href="/wiki/Killed" id="w">killed</a>.</p>
