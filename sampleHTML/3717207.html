<p>The gameplay in <i>Art of Conquest</i> is the same as in the original <i>Empire Earth</i>, albeit with some changes. Variable difficulty was added to those scenarios  which had not received it in a patch of the original <i>Empire Earth</i>. Online multiplayer capabilities were added, allowing players to play online with up to 7 other players either over the internet via a lobby system, or over a <a href="/wiki/LAN" id="w">LAN</a>.</p>
<p>The new Space Age (Epoch XV) allows the building of spaceports and <a href="/wiki/Spaceships" id="w">spaceships</a> on maps that allow it.<sup id="_ref-GameSpot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpot" title="">[4]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Robot" id="w">Robots</a> replace Citizens in the Nano Age and <a href="/wiki/Infantry" id="w">infantry</a> in the Space Age (these robots are known as <i>Watchmen</i>). Nano age Farms are run by robots, and by the Space Age farms no longer need citizens to manage them.</p>
<p>In <i>The Art of Conquest</i>, each civilization has its own power, or &#34;<i>civ power</i>&#34;. Often, these powers are only available during certain epochs. A <i>civ power</i> gives each nation a specialty: the Chinese, for example, have the ability of &#34;Just in Time  manufacturing or the Japanese with the powerful &#34;cyber ninja&#34;.<sup id="_ref-IGN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Empire Earth</i> supports <a href="/wiki/Multiplayer_games" id="w">multiplayer games</a> over LAN connections and online. Multiplayer games are identical in form to single player games. <i>Art of Conquest</i> multiplayer play has many <a href="/wiki/Cheating_in_online_games#Exploits" id="w">exploits</a>, which players can use to give themselves an unfair advantage. The game&#39;s publisher, <a href="/wiki/Vivendi_Games" id="w">Vivendi Games</a>, has set up forums where players can report exploits.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

This campaign is told from the perspective of the Kwan Do family, an influential family who claim to be descendants of the <a href="/wiki/Qin_Dynasty" id="w">Qin Dynasty</a>, and is split into two parts.
Part One details the colonization of <a href="/wiki/Mars" id="w">Mars</a>. As soon as it is discovered that it is possible to colonize Mars, the major superpowers of Earth scramble to develop the technologies and resources needed to establish settlements. One of these powers is the newly-formed United Federation of Asian Republics (UFAR), founded and ultimately controlled by the Kwan Do family. The Kwan Do family are the rich owners of <i>Kwan Do Electronics and Communications</i>. The UFAR government struggles to suppress local rebellions and terrorist activities by the <i>Eye of God</i>, an extremist <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christian</a> organization who claim that Earth should be the only home to mankind. Meanwhile, the UFAR also struggles to develop a colonial programme competing against rival superpowers. A UFAR colony on Mars is eventually built, with help from Japan, alongside settlements built by the US/<a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canadian</a> Conglomerate, the European Union of Nations, Novaya Russia, and the Republic of Japan. With these colonies established, Mars is divided into five regions.
Part Two is set 250 years after the first part, during the Space Age Epoch. The Kwan Do dynasty has been overthrown, and harsh conditions on Mars and an increasingly negative perception of the <a href="/wiki/Earth" id="w">Earth</a> governments have finally forced the Martian colonists into rebellion. During the revolutions, Khan Sun Do, a descendant of the Kwan Do family, unites the five territories. With the acquisition of <a href="/wiki/Space_Battleship_Yamato" id="w">Space Battleship Yamato</a>, the Martians fight an inter-planetary war against Earth to secure their independence. The campaign ends with the last battle for Martian independence and the installation of Khan Sun Do as the first leader of Mars. </p>
<a id="Development_and_release" name="Development_and_release"></a><h1>Development and release</h1>
<p>The <i>Art of Conquest</i> expansion pack for <i><a href="/wiki/Empire_Earth" id="w">Empire Earth</a></i> was announced in May of 2002 by Sierra (the game&#39;s original publisher, later taken over by <a href="/wiki/Vivendi" id="w">Vivendi</a>).<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The development of the game was turned over to <a href="/wiki/Mad_Doc_Software" id="w">Mad Doc Software</a> from <a href="/wiki/Stainless_Steel_Studios" id="w">Stainless Steel Studios</a> because Stainless Steel were already working on <i><a href="/wiki/Empires:_Dawn_of_the_Modern_World" id="w">Empires: Dawn of the Modern World</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-dev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dev" title="">[9]</a></sup> According to Steve Beinner, the brand manager of the <i>Empire Earth</i> series, <i>Empire Earth<b>s expansion pack was planned even before the original game was released.<sup id="_ref-develop_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-develop" title="">[10]</a></sup> The developers listened to feedback from the game community and planned the new features and release schedule accordingly.<sup id="_ref-develop_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-develop" title="">[10]</a></sup> In an interview with IGN.com, Steve Beinner said &#34;People were asking for additional scenarios and extra units. That&#39;s based upon surveys we did and distributors on a worldwide basis.&#34;<sup id="_ref-develop_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-develop" title="">[10]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>Work on <i>Art of Conquest</i> began in early 2002, with a planned release date later that same year. The developers decided &#34;the game won&#39;t be present at <a href="/wiki/E3" id="w">E3</a>, because of the tight development schedule and the fact that Sierra didn&#39;t want the developers to be distracted by creating an E3 demo.&#34;<sup id="_ref-dev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dev" title="">[9]</a></sup> Beta testing for <i>Art of Conquest</i> began on August 5, 2002, and consisted of a single multiplayer map that could be played through all 15 of the expansion pack&#39;s ages, allowing players to try out all the new features of the game.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Art of Conquest</i> was included in the release of the <i>Empire Earth Gold Edition</i>, which was a re-release of both <i>Empire Earth</i> and <i>Art of Conquest</i>.<sup id="_ref-GameSpotGold_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpotGold" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>The overall reception of <i>Art of Conquest</i> was mediocre. <a href="/wiki/Game_Rankings" id="w">Game Rankings</a> averaged it at 66%,<sup id="_ref-GameRankings_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameRankings" title="">[3]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Metacritic" id="w">Metacritic</a> averaged it slightly lower, at 63%.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> IGN, who gave it a 7.8 out of 10, stated &#34;While it&#39;s a solid game, there&#39;s just not enough here to compel me to reawaken the substantial addiction the first game generated. Whether or not it&#39;s worth it for you to pick this one up depends almost entirely on how much you enjoyed the original game. With so few significant changes it plays almost exactly the same. For those who couldn&#39;t get enough of Empire Earth, the expansion should be a perfect fit. Just don&#39;t expect the breadth and scope of the first game.&#34;<sup id="_ref-IGN_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN" title="">[5]</a></sup> Armchair Empire gave the game a 6.8 out of 10, and commented &#34;AoC doesn’t exactly bring any shame or disgrace to Empire Earth (EE), but it doesn’t do anything to make itself a must have for EE fans. That being said, most EE fans will like what AoC has to offer.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Armchair_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Armchair" title="">[14]</a></sup> Finally, GameSpot gave it a 5.2 out of 10, and said &#34;Ultimately, The Art of Conquest doesn&#39;t add enough to make much of a difference.&#34;<sup id="_ref-GameSpot_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpot" title="">[4]</a></sup>
A notable criticism from GameSpot was regarding the way Space was implemented in the game. Spaceships were only available on certain maps and the gameplay was very similar to water -- a dock-type building is built and spaceships travel much like naval ships.<sup id="_ref-GameSpot_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpot" title="">[4]</a></sup>
Other reviewers found fault with the game&#39;s price of 30 USD. The IGN reviewer said &#34;I like <i>Art of Conquest</i> enough but it just falls short of being worth the $30 price tag.&#34;<sup id="_ref-IGN_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Audio" name="Audio"></a><h2>Audio</h2>
<p><i>Art of Conquest<b>s music was never release as a soundtrack CD, but the music in the game received critical approval, receiving  7 out of 10 from GameSpot.<sup id="_ref-GameSpot_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpot" title="">[4]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/IGN" id="w">IGN</a> described the sound as &#34;convincing enough, with realistic battle noises throughout the game&#39;s various ages. Each type of attack makes a particular sound and, after a while, you can develop a good sense of the scope of a given battle just by listening to it&#34;. IGN gave the sound 7 out of 10 overall, but did have some criticism, remarking that &#34;A few glitches detract from an otherwise sufficient soundtrack. Voices are decent and the music is good.<sup id="_ref-IGN_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN" title="">[5]</a></sup></b></i></p>
