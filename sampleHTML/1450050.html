<i>First appearance:</i> #17: Field of Dreams</p>
<p>{{anime voices}}</p>
<p>Imadori is the class&#39;s number two pervert (the pervert ringleader being Ganji Nishimoto).  He has the special skill of knowing a girl&#39;s bra size just by looking at her chest. Interested only in girls with breast sizes of D or larger, the main targets of his flirting are the well-endowed Mikoto Suo and Lala Gonzalez, and he continues to pursue them constantly although they are strong enough to beat him down. Imadori has some physical abilities, such as being strong enough to grapple Hanai to a standstill. He works in a hair salon called &#34;Now Bird&#34;, which his family owns. He enjoys the <a href="/wiki/Tokusatsu" id="w">tokusatsu</a> show &#34;Hatenkou Robo Dozibiron&#34; (a <a href="/wiki/Super_Sentai" id="w">Super Sentai</a>/<a href="/wiki/Power_Rangers" id="w">Power Rangers</a> parody). Despite constantly avoiding any involvement with Ichijō, he sometimes shows some interest in her, such as when he was admiring her singing during the cultural festival party. He also has a more sensitive side to him, which he shows towards Lala when he tries to get her to smile at her part-time job, even at the cost of getting walloped by her.

<i>First appearance:</i> #36: Boy meets Girl</p>
<p>{{anime voices}}</p>
<p>Kentarō Nara is a side character who has feelings for Tenma, but his attempts to get closer to her are often foiled by Harima. Curiously, according to the mangaka, his original intentions were to have Nara as the series&#39; main character, but somehow he was relegated to a supporting role. He is now often seen as a reluctant participant in various escapades with Yoshidayama and Nishimoto. Nara is both a <a href="/wiki/Nara" id="w">city</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nara_prefecture" id="w">prefecture</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Kansai" id="w">Kansai</a> region of Japan, near <a href="/wiki/Kyoto" id="w">Kyoto</a>.

<li><b>Karen Ichijō</b></li></ul>
<p><i>First appearance:</i> #47: Girl Fight</p>
<p><i>Voiced by:</i> <a href="/wiki/Yuuka_Nanri" id="w">Yuuka Nanri</a> (Japanese, 1st series, OVA), <a href="/wiki/MAKO" id="w">MAKO</a> (2nd series), <a href="/wiki/Carrie_Savage" id="w">Carrie Savage</a> (English)</p>
<p>Ichijō has monstrous strength despite having a weak and feminine appearance and is a member of the amateur wrestling club. Her power amazes even her strongest male classmates (i.e., she is arguably even stronger than Harima and Hanai in terms of raw muscle strength, for she could carry a piano without any signs of physical stress, while the other two were on the verge of breakdown while trying hard to carry objects of the same size). It would also seem that she is not able to control her strength well, as shown when she nearly suffocates Tenma when trying to cover her mouth so that she does not blurt out secrets. Lala Gonzalez is her only rival in this regard, but has not been able to physically defeat her (In fact, Ichijo defeated her with her ultimate move, the &#34;Frankensteiner&#34;). Despite this, Ichijō has not reciprocated Lala&#39;s antagonism, always remaining polite towards her. Later the two seem to have developed into friends.</p>
<p>Despite her strength she has a kind nature and is one of the more timid girls in 2-C. She is in love with Imadori, but gets embarrassed when this is hinted at. Imadori also initially avoids her, not only because of her small measures (later it is revealed that she does have considerably large breasts), but also because he fears her strength. She is also a good singer, and her singing is featured in episodes 2 and 6 of <i>School Rumble - Second Term</i>.</p>
<p>When Imadori met her practicing wrestling and asked her why she liked it, she said that she really did not want to do wrestling. Later, when Imadori, along with Harima and Hanai were working for a moving company, they found out that Ichijō was also working with them as well as how strong she was. At the end of their shift, Imadori accidentally said that he could take Karen out on a date with his earnings, which Karen agrees to, even though Imadori did not really mean it.</p>
<p>Ichijō-dōri is the northernmost of Kyoto&#39;s numbered east-west avenues, which in the east extends to the <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_University" id="w">Kyoto University</a> campus and the precincts of <a href="/wiki/Yoshida_Shrine" id="w">Yoshida Shrine</a>.</p>

Asō&#39;s family runs a ramen shop.  He is good at cooking Chinese food and works part-time at a Chinese restaurant together with Sarah Adiemus of 1-D. </p>
<p>Asō is reputed to be popular among girls, although this is not explicitly shown.  He, on the other hand, does not appear to have much interest in girls with the exception of Mikoto, who he dated several times.  Their relationship progressed to the point of Mikoto&#39;s parents inviting him over to a family dinner.  The two have since broken up, for reasons not made entirely clear.</p>

He is hailed as &#34;Buddha Nishimoto (仏の西本)&#34; among other reasons, for his ability to grant the wishes of the students, usually involving erotic material.

She belongs to the same amateur wrestling club as Ichijō, who she sees her as a rival, often shouting &#34;Ichijō!&#34; when she meets her. Lala dislikes Ichijō&#39;s name because her mother, who abandoned her and her father when she was a child, was also named Karen. </p>
<p>She detests the D-cup-hunting pervert Imadori, especially when he managed to grope her chest while being choked. She thus tends to beats him up whenever she sees him after sufficient provocation. Lala works in the same fast food restaurant as Ichijo, where no one dared to go to her counter because of her violent temper. She even grabs customers that annoy her and drags them inside for a beating. Lala&#39;s closest friends appear to be Harry Mackenzie and Masakazu Tougou, who both look out for her.  Later on, her animosity towards Ichijo softens. Her character is the direct opposite of her rival Ichijō, being that she is tall, well-endowed, sour-faced, hot-tempered, and very easily provoked.</p>

He is a parody of Gundam character, <a href="/wiki/Anavel_Gato" id="w">Anavel Gato</a>. Recently Masakazu has shown some interest in Tenma, to Harima&#39;s distress. He is often seen with Harry Mackenzie. Some people around him usually refer to him with an alternate nickname &#34;Macaroni&#34;, probably because he likes to put Italian words in his sentences. He has a tendency to burst into extremely long inspirational speeches either involving &#39;facing challenges head on&#39; or &#39;how to be manly&#39;. As the series progressed, his self-confidence and passion for facing challenges &#39;head on&#39; have become so extreme that his actions and ideas often border on shear-stupidity and often contain a startling lack of regard for the safety and well-being of others, like when he said that they should just charge the ocean liner the students (including himself) were in straight into a giant reef instead of going around it because it was &#39;the manly thing to do&#39;. His appearance is often followed by the US national anthem.</p>

<p><i>First appearance:</i> Volume 2, Special Chapter: The Time Machine</p>
<p>{{anime voices}}</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Physics" id="w">physics</a> teacher and Harima&#39;s cousin. Itoko is Harima&#39;s roommate and takes care of him. Though she does not show it, she does care for him and realises just how much Tenma has changed him. Her figure is admired by the perverted boys of class 2-C. She has a fear that her past would get brought up, and this is a weakness Sasakura uses against her.</p>
<p>&#34;Itoko&#34; is also homonymous with the word &#34;cousin&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" id="w">Japanese</a> which makes it a pun. Due to this pun, when Harima says &#34;my cousin&#34; it can be mistaken that he is saying &#34;my Itoko&#34;. </p>
<p>Itoko&#39;s looks (but definitely not her character) vaguely resembles <a href="/wiki/Yukishiro_Tomoe" id="w">Yukishiro Tomoe</a> from <a href="/wiki/Ruroni_Kenshin" id="w">Ruroni Kenshin</a>, especially the Tomoe drawn in the <a href="/wiki/Rurouni_Kenshin:_Tsuiokuhen" id="w">Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen</a> OVA.</p>

<p>The school art teacher and an old friend of Itoko, who was her junior during their college years.  On several occasions, it is hinted that she and Itoko are more than just friends, although this has never been confirmed outright. It has also been hinted that she is a lesbian and has always been trying to get closer to Itoko during their high school years.

<i>First appearance:</i> #29: The Boy Can&#39;t Help It</p>
<p>{{anime voices}}</p>
<p>The school&#39;s infirmary nurse who is also loved by the boys. The fact that she is the infirmary nurse has encouraged many boys to get injured or feign injury so that they can get close to her. Prior to taking this job, she briefly let Harima stay at her apartment when his dream of becoming a <i>mangaka</i> was temporarily crushed after he found out that his idol, the <i>mangaka</i> Nijō jō was really Karasuma. Anegasaki is attracted to Harima and calls him affectionately by his pen name &#34;Hario&#34;. Her belief in and support of Harima helped him get over his depression and return to school.  She later becomes the faculty sponsor for the girls&#39; basketball team.</p>
<p>Harima refers to her as &#34;Onee-chan&#34; (lit. Older Sister). For the first five volumes of the manga, she is unnamed, and is referred to in the list of characters by this nickname.</p>

<p>Class 2-C&#39;s homeroom teacher, who teaches English. Hayato is very soft-spoken and collects toy dinosaurs. He likes Tae Anegasaki, but every time he tries to hit on her, she clings to Harima affectionately, making him run away in jealousy and shame.

His methods are very strict and makes it known to every student of Yagami High School (usually the class of 2-C) to adhere in the best manner how a responsible student should be; incidents such as Ganji Nishimoto and his team of perverts loitering in the hallway of the school clinic trying to get a glimpse (or in some cases, incurring harm to themselves just to get tended to) of Tae Anegasaki.
