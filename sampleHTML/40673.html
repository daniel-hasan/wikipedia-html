<p>The <b>Eastern</b> or <b>American Goldfinch</b> (<i>Carduelis tristis</i>), also known as the <b>Wild Canary</b>, is a <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North American</a> <a href="/wiki/Bird" id="w">bird</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Finch" id="w">finch</a> <a href="/wiki/Family_(biology)" id="w">family</a>. It is <a href="/wiki/Bird_migration" id="w">migratory</a>, ranging from southern <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> to <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> during the breeding season, and from just south of the Canadian border to <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a> during the winter.</p>
<p>The only finch in its <a href="/wiki/Subfamily" id="w">subfamily</a> which undergoes a complete <a href="/wiki/Molt" id="w">molt</a>, the American Goldfinch displays <a href="/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" id="w">sexual dimorphism</a> in its coloration; the male is a vibrant yellow in the summer and an olive color during the winter months, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored <a href="/wiki/Plumage" id="w">plumage</a> during the breeding season to attract a mate.</p>
<p>The American Goldfinch is <a href="/wiki/Granivorous" id="w">granivorous</a> and <a href="/wiki/Adaptation" id="w">adapted</a> for the consumption of seedheads, with a conical <a href="/wiki/Beak" id="w">beak</a> to remove the seeds and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird, and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating. It may behave <a href="/wiki/Territory_(animal)" id="w">territorially</a> during nest construction, but this aggression is short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively late in the year for a finch. This species is generally <a href="/wiki/Monogamous" id="w">monogamous</a>, and produces one brood each year.</p>
<p>Human activity has generally benefited the American Goldfinch. It is often found in residential areas, attracted to <a href="/wiki/Bird_feeders" id="w">bird feeders</a> installed by humans, which increases its survival rate in these areas. <a href="/wiki/Deforestation" id="w">Deforestation</a> by humans also creates open meadow areas which are the preferred <a href="/wiki/Habitat" id="w">habitat</a> of the American Goldfinch.</p>
<a id="Taxonomy" name="Taxonomy"></a><h1> Taxonomy </h1>
<p>The American Goldfinch was one of the many species originally described by <a href="/wiki/Carolus_Linnaeus" id="w">Linnaeus</a> in his 18th century work, <i><a href="/wiki/Systema_Naturae" id="w">Systema Naturae</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> It was initially included in the <a href="/wiki/Genus" id="w">genus</a> <i>Spinus</i>, a group containing New World goldfinches and <a href="/wiki/Siskin" id="w">siskins</a>, but in <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a>, <i>Spinus</i> was merged into the genus <i><a href="/wiki/Carduelis" id="w">Carduelis</a></i> as a <a href="/wiki/Subgenus" id="w">subgenus</a>.<sup id="_ref-elib_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-elib" title="">[2]</a></sup>

The American Goldfinch is a small finch, 11–13&#160;centimeters (4–5&#160;in) in length, with a <a href="/wiki/Wingspan" id="w">wingspan</a> of 19–22&#160;centimeters (7–9&#160;in). It weighs between 11–20&#160;grams (0.39–0.71&#160;oz).<sup id="_ref-Georgia Wildlife Guide_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Georgia Wildlife Guide" title="">[7]</a></sup> The beak is small, conical, and pink for most of the year, though it turns bright orange with the spring molt in both sexes.<sup id="_ref-Cornell Bird Guide_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cornell Bird Guide" title="">[8]</a></sup>
The shape and size of the beak are a result of adaptation, to aid in the extraction of <a href="/wiki/Seed" id="w">seeds</a> from the seed heads of <a href="/wiki/Thistle" id="w">thistles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sunflower" id="w">sunflowers</a>, and the other plants which make up its <a href="/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)" id="w">diet</a>.<sup id="_ref-Birds of the Hinterlands_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Birds of the Hinterlands" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The American Goldfinch undergoes a molt in the spring and fall. The sexual dimorphism displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt, when the bright color of the male&#39;s summer plumage is needed to attract a mate.<sup id="_ref-Birds of the Hinterlands_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Birds of the Hinterlands" title="">[9]</a></sup>  It is the only cardueline finch to undergo a molt twice a year; other finches change plumage color by the gradual wearing-down of the <a href="/wiki/Feather" id="w">feathers</a>, molting only once each year.<sup id="_ref-Chipper Woods Bird Observatory_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chipper Woods Bird Observatory" title="">[10]</a></sup> In the winter moult it sheds all its feathers, and in the spring molt, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark olive in the female and black in the male.<sup id="_ref-Birds of the Hinterlands_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Birds of the Hinterlands" title="">[9]</a></sup>  The markings on these feathers remain identical through each molt, with large white bars on the wings, and white feathers at the edges of the short, notched tail.<sup id="_ref-Cornell Bird Guide_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cornell Bird Guide" title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Once the spring molt is completed, the body of the male is a brilliant lemon yellow, a color produced by <a href="/wiki/Carotenoid" id="w">carotenoid</a> <a href="/wiki/Pigment" id="w">pigments</a> from plant materials in its diet,<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> with a striking jet black cap and white rump that is visible during flight.<sup id="_ref-DNR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DNR" title="">[12]</a></sup>
The female is an olive yellow, with a yellow bib.<sup id="_ref-Chipper Woods Bird Observatory_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chipper Woods Bird Observatory" title="">[10]</a></sup> After the fall molt, the bright summer feathers are replaced with duller plumage. The goldfinch becomes <a href="/wiki/Buff_(colour)" id="w">buff</a> below and olive-brown above, with a pale yellow face and bib. The fall plumage is almost identical in both sexes; the only markings which differentiate the sexes are the yellow shoulder patches of the male.<sup id="_ref-San Diego Natural History Museum_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-San Diego Natural History Museum" title="">[13]</a></sup> In some winter ranges, the goldfinches lose all traces of yellow, becoming a predominantly medium tan-gray color with an olive tinge evident only on close viewing.</p>
<p>The immature American Goldfinch is colored differently from the adult during its first fall and winter. The back is dull brown, and the underside is pale yellow. The shoulders and tail are dull black with buff-colored, rather than white, markings on wings and rump. This coloration is the same in both genders.<sup id="_ref-San Diego Natural History Museum_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-San Diego Natural History Museum" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Bird_song" id="w">song</a> of the American Goldfinch is a series of musical warbles and twitters, often with a long note. A <i>tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit</i> call is often given in flight; it may also be described as <i>per-chic-o-ree</i>.<sup id="_ref-Cornell Bird Guide_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cornell Bird Guide" title="">[8]</a></sup> While the female <a href="/wiki/Avian_incubation" id="w">incubates</a> the eggs, she calls her returning mate with a soft continuous <i>teeteeteeteete</i> sound. The young begin to use a call of <i>chick-kee</i> or <i>chick-wee</i> shortly before <a href="/wiki/Fledge" id="w">fledging</a>, which they use until they have left the nest entirely.<sup id="_ref-Birds of the Hinterlands_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Birds of the Hinterlands" title="">[9]</a></sup> There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a <i>sweeet</i> call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract <a href="/wiki/Predator" id="w">predators</a>, and a <i>bearbee</i> used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the nest (to become less conspicuous).<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

The American Goldfinch is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Gregarious">gregarious</a> during the non-breeding season, when it is often found in large flocks, usually with other finches. Flocks generally fly in an undulating pattern, creating a wave-shaped path.<sup id="_ref-University of Michigan: Animal Diversity_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-University of Michigan: Animal Diversity" title="">[17]</a></sup>
During the breeding season, it lives in loose <a href="/wiki/Colony_(biology)" id="w">colonies</a>. While the nest is being constructed, the male will act aggressively toward other males who intrude into his territory, driving them away, and the female reacts in the same way toward other females. This aggressiveness fades once the eggs have been laid.<sup id="_ref-Sullivan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sullivan" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The American Goldfinch does not act aggressively toward predators within its territory; its only reaction is <a href="/wiki/Alarm_call" id="w">alarm calling</a>. Predators include <a href="/wiki/Snakes" id="w">snakes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Weasel" id="w">weasels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Squirrels" id="w">squirrels</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Blue_Jay" id="w">Blue Jays</a>, which may destroy eggs or kill young, and <a href="/wiki/Hawks" id="w">hawks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cats" id="w">cats</a>, which pose a threat to both young and adults. 
</p><a id="Diet" name="Diet"></a><h2>Diet</h2>
<p>The American Goldfinch is a <a href="/wiki/Diurnal_animal" id="w">diurnal</a> feeder. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects which it feeds to its young in order to provide them with <a href="/wiki/Protein" id="w">protein</a>.  Its <a href="/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)" id="w">diet</a> consists of the seeds from a wide variety of <a href="/wiki/Annual_plant" id="w">annual</a> plants, often those of weeds grasses and trees, such as <a href="/wiki/Thistle" id="w">thistle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Teasel" id="w">teasel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dandelion" id="w">dandelion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ragweed" id="w">ragweed</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mullein" id="w">mullein</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cosmos" id="w">cosmos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Salsify" id="w">goatsbeard</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sunflower" id="w">sunflower</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Alder" id="w">alder</a>.<sup id="_ref-Terres_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Terres" title="">[15]</a></sup> However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries.

Unlike some finch species, the American Goldfinch uses its feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding in order to reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American Goldfinch feeds on the <a href="/wiki/Catkin" id="w">catkins</a> hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.<sup id="_ref-Birds of the Hinterlands_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Birds of the Hinterlands" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

The American Goldfinch begins its breeding season later in the year than any other finch.<sup id="_ref-Birds of the Hinterlands_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Birds of the Hinterlands" title="">[9]</a></sup> This may be related to the abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.<sup id="_ref-Sullivan_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sullivan" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The courtship rituals of the American Goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male is able to signal his quality and fitness, both in the short term (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage).<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.<sup id="_ref-Birds of the Hinterlands_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Birds of the Hinterlands" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Once a male has found a mate, he selects a territory, marking the boundaries by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward in a series of loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.<sup id="_ref-Birds of the Hinterlands_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Birds of the Hinterlands" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

 nest is built in late summer by the female in the branches of a <a href="/wiki/Deciduous" id="w">deciduous</a> shrub or tree at a height of up to 10&#160;meters (30&#160;ft). The nest-building lasts approximately six days, during which time the females works in 10–40&#160;minute increments. The male frequently flies with the female as she collects nesting materials, and though he may carry some materials back to the nest, he leaves its construction to the female. The outer shell of the nest is built of bark, weeds, vines, and grass.<sup id="_ref-Smithsonian_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Smithsonian" title="">[16]</a></sup> The inside diameter of the finished nest is about 6.5&#160;centimeters (2.5&#160;in).<sup id="_ref-Terres_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Terres" title="">[15]</a></sup> The rim is reinforced with bark bound by <a href="/wiki/Spider_web" id="w">spiderwebs</a> and caterpillar silk, and the cup is lined with plant down from milkweed, thistle, or cattail.

<p>American Goldfinches lay four to six bluish-white to greenish-blue <a href="/wiki/Egg_(biology)" id="w">eggs</a>, which are oval in shape and about 16&#160;x&#160;12&#160;millimeters (.6&#160;x&#160;.45&#160;in), roughly the size of a <a href="/wiki/Peanut" id="w">peanut</a>.<sup id="_ref-Smithsonian_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Smithsonian" title="">[16]</a></sup> It is thought that they are laid during the night.<sup id="_ref-University of Michigan: Animal Diversity_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-University of Michigan: Animal Diversity" title="">[17]</a></sup> The eggs are incubated by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.<sup id="_ref-Smithsonian_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Smithsonian" title="">[16]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>The chicks hatch 12–14&#160;days after incubation begins.

For up to three weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.<sup id="_ref-Birds of the Hinterlands_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Birds of the Hinterlands" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>American Goldfinches are occasionally victims of brood parasites, particularly <a href="/wiki/Brown-headed_Cowbird" id="w">Brown-headed Cowbirds</a>. One study found that 9% of nests had Brown-headed Cowbird eggs in them.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> American Goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of Brown-headed Cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is despite the fact that the American Goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of Brown-headed Cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough <a href="/wiki/Nutrition" id="w">nutrition</a>; the seed-rich diet of American Goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
