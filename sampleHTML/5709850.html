<p>Sarge is the <a href="/wiki/Staff_Sergeant" id="w">staff sergeant</a><sup id="_ref-S3DVDProfiles_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S3DVDProfiles" title="">[1]</a></sup> and leader of the Blood Gulch Red Team. A <a href="/wiki/Military_man" id="w">military man</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Southern_American_English" id="w">Southern American accent</a>, he is the only Blood Gulch soldier on either team consistently serious about the Red versus Blue civil war. His <a href="/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder" id="w">psychopathic</a> battle plans often entail unnecessary <a href="/wiki/Casualty_(person)" id="w">casualties</a> in his own men. In particular, a common planned outcome is the death of Grif, who is habitually lazy, irresponsible, and uninsightful. These characteristics earn him the disrespect and ridicule of both Sarge and Simmons, Sarge&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Sycophant" id="w">sycophantic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Insecurity" id="w">insecure</a> <a href="/wiki/Right-hand_man" id="w">right-hand man</a>. Despite this, Simmons and Grif are often seen together, either chatting or bickering. Donut, the eager rookie who joins the team in {{rvbep}}, tends to annoy his teammates with his naïveté, garrulousness, and cheerfulness and becomes more <a href="/wiki/Effeminacy" id="w">effeminate</a> and childish as the series progresses.</p>
<a id="Warthog" name="Warthog"></a><h2>Warthog</h2>

<p>The <b>Warthog</b> (the vehicle&#39;s actual name in the <a href="/wiki/Halo_(video_game_series)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Halo&#39;&#39; video game series</a>) is a battle jeep delivered to the Reds in {{rvbep}}. Failing to see much resemblance to a <a href="/wiki/Warthog" id="w">warthog</a>, Grif suggests the name <b><a href="/wiki/Cougar" id="w">Puma</a></b>. Believing that Grif is suggesting the name of a fictional creature, Sarge and Simmons suggest several other mythical creatures (mockingly) — such as the <a href="/wiki/Unicorn" id="w">unicorn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Leprechaun" id="w">leprechaun</a>, and &#34;<b>Chupathingy</b>&#34; (after the <a href="/wiki/Chupacabra" id="w">Chupacabra</a>) — as names. <i>Chupathingy</i> is the name listed on the character biography, available as an <a href="/wiki/Easter_egg_(virtual)" id="w">Easter egg</a> for the {{rvbep}} DVD.</p>
<p>The Warthog has a homing beacon and remote control system linked to Lopez. This system is accidentally activated in {{rvbep}} when Church, then possessing Lopez, and Tucker attempt to activate Lopez&#39; repair sequence. Burns suggests that, as with {{rvbchar}}, the vehicle was originally going to be a full-blown character and maintain a personality throughout the series, in a <a href="/wiki/Parody" id="w">parody</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Speed_Buggy" id="w">Speed Buggy</a></i>. This idea was, however, abandoned shortly after the remote control gag.<sup id="_ref-S2DVD_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S2DVD" title="">[2]</a></sup>  The Warthog is frequently blaring loud <a href="/wiki/Ranchera" id="w">Mexican ranchera</a> music, and it can often be heard approaching because of it.</p>
<p>In {{rvbep}}, Grif notes that the Warthog seems to be &#34;really bad luck.&#34; During its two seasons of appearance, it spends most of its time out of commission. The teams leave it behind when they leave Blood Gulch at the end of season 2, but find another similar jeep after blasting forward in time from the explosion on Sidewinder, which plays the same ranchera music upon being activated, and also in {{rvbep}}.  Upon returning to Blood Gulch, there has been no sign of the original jeep in the canyon.</p>

<p>On the other side of the canyon, Church is the <a href="/wiki/Cynicism" id="w">cynical</a> unofficial leader of the Blue Team, despite the fact that he is not the highest ranking member. Often shouldering the responsibility of actually solving the various crises that the Blood Gulch teams encounter, he often ends up taking their brunt, leaving him increasingly disillusioned and antisocial. His serious, reasoned approach conflicts with the personalities of Tucker and Caboose. The former is snide, averse to work and battle, and obsessed with women; the latter, although physically strong, is unable to grasp simple concepts and exhibits varying degrees of stupidity and insanity throughout the series. Rounding out the Blue Team is Tex, Church&#39;s former girlfriend who is hired by Blue Command to join the team as a <a href="/wiki/Mercenary" id="w">mercenary</a> in {{rvbep}}. Able to eliminate entire teams of soldiers by herself, she is described as &#34;the most lethal soldier in Blood Gulch. &#34;<sup id="_ref-S3DVDProfiles_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S3DVDProfiles" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Sheila" name="Sheila"></a><h2>Sheila</h2>
<dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>Full name: Sheila, originally Phyllis (M808V Main Battle Tank, later D77-TC Pelican Dropship)</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>Voice actor: <a href="/wiki/Yomary_Cruz" id="w">Yomary Cruz</a></li></ul></dd></dl>
<p><b>Sheila</b>, originally named <b>Phyllis</b>, is the <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" id="w">AI</a> of the Blue team&#39;s M808V Main Battle Tank. She is friendly and cheerful, but, being a tank, she has a habit of blowing people up, including her own teammate Church, owing to a disabled Friendly Fire protocol. Sheila is bombed out of action by Sarge&#39;s dropship early in the first season, but is repaired by Tex several episodes later. Donut later disables her again by pitching a grenade into her cockpit  at the end of season 1.</p>
<p>Sheila shows some indications of liking Caboose. However, in the middle of season 2, she falls in love with Lopez, much to Caboose&#39;s dislike. Before long, the two attempt to lead a robot revolution against the humans in response to perceived abuse that they have received: being constantly blown up or possessed by ghosts. This idea stemmed from Church&#39;s attempt to deter them from doing so, in his endeavors to change the past. After O&#39;Malley kidnaps Lopez, however, she puts aside her differences in order to help the soldiers retrieve him.</p>
<p>Because Sheila cannot fit through the teleporter (because her AI was hardwired into the tank by her manufacturers), she remains behind on Blood Gulch while the Reds and Blues leave to pursue O&#39;Malley. After a brief encounter with a <a href="/wiki/Time_travel" id="w">time-traveling</a> Church, who whispers a plan to her, Sheila powers down and presumably remains alone as the sole inhabitant of Blood Gulch for the better part of a <a href="/wiki/Millennium" id="w">millennium</a>. It is thought that she may be the source of the distress signal that the Reds hear in season 3, as Church&#39;s plan included the words &#34;a thousand years.&#34; A deleted scene on the Season Four DVD confirms that she is ordered to send out the distress signal and disguises her voice. In addition, all of the Reds except Sarge see her drive past the Red Base in Blood Gulch upon their return. When Sarge demotes Simmons for his talk of &#34;imaginary&#34; tanks, she helps Simmons attempt his revenge on the Reds, despite being unable to recognize the team as her enemies due to faltering <a href="/wiki/Memory" id="w">memory</a> units. She also expresses dissatisfaction when Church later collects all the vehicles available to the Blue Base in Blood Gulch; Church perceives her reaction as jealousy (this scene was relocated to the Deleted Scenes section of the Season 4 DVD for continuity reasons). </p>
<p>As of Season 5, Church notes that Sheila has been acting aggressive lately and saying &#34;random threatening things.&#34;  Soon after this, when Tex arrives, Church inquires if O&#39;Malley, the evil AI who had just recently jumped out of Doc, could be possessing Sheila. After Sheila had been shut down in order to find out what was wrong with her, Caboose demanded that she be turned back on, as she was about to tell him whom O&#39;Malley was possessing. Tex explained that the tank was far too damaged to be reactivated (possibly explaining her increasingly violent behavior), so they decided to transfer Sheila&#39;s AI into the Pelican that Sister had arrived in. She is pleasantly surprised by the roominess of her new home, and later tells Caboose that O&#39;Malley has moved into the Blue leader (Captain Flowers). Her tank body is then taken over by the AI Gary. Later they link the ship up to the tank and she locks Gary behind a firewall.</p>
<p>She is killed by Andy when her space ship explodes in the final episode. </p>
<p>Caboose tells the other Blues in {{rvbep}} that Andy has known Sheila from previous encounters, but gives no specific explanation. Caboose brings Andy back to the gulch in {{rvbep}}, but no interaction between Sheila and Andy has occurred to support or refute Caboose&#39;s claim. Rooster Teeth stated that Andy was originally to be Sheila&#39;s ex-boyfriend; however, the idea was pushed to Season 5, along with, according to Hullum, &#34;a really interesting character trait related to that [Andy&#39;s relationship with Sheila].&#34;<sup id="_ref-S4DVDComment_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S4DVDComment" title="">[4]</a></sup>  However, no such traits are shown within the season.</p>

<p><b>Junior</b> first appeared at the end of {{rvbep}}, in voice only. It is the result of the Alien supposedly impregnating {{rvbchar}}, who is the &#34;mother,&#34; with a <a href="/wiki/Parasitic_embryo" id="w">parasitic embryo</a>. The exact details of the birth are unknown as they take place off screen. He returns in season 5, and because he has &#34;lots of energy,&#34; causes havoc in the Blue Base. Doc feeds him with some of Caboose&#39;s blood by exposing some bare skin.  Junior first appears in episode 80, and is a mini-version of the Alien, with cyan and blue armor. Its existence has quickly caught the ire of a frustrated and enraged Church who has threatened to kill it in multiple instances.  In episode 84, Church introduces Tucker, the creature&#39;s &#34;mother&#34; to it, to Tucker&#39;s confusion.  Tucker has briefly been shown acting protective of it, snapping at Church when the latter refers to it in his flippant manner.  In episode 91, Tucker is heard to call him Junior, and in episode 94, Junior channels Tucker&#39;s catch phrase by saying &#34;Bow-Chicka-Honk-Honk.&#34; Following this, Junior is sent through the caves with Doc and Sister, where he is found by a very interested Captain Butch Flowers, the current host of O&#39;Malley. According to episode 97, Junior apparently has a grand destiny to fulfill; this is revealed to be the fact that he is to be the savior of the Alien race noted in the Prophecy told by his Alien father. The villains, however, intend O&#39;Malley to infect him and use the control of their religion for their own purposes.</p>
<p>He is killed in the exploding ship in most endings of episode 100, except the ending where Andy did not explode and Tex instead shoots a missile at the Red and Blue teams.  Junior&#39;s fate following this is not confirmed, but this was not the canon ending anyway.</p>
<p>Rooster Teeth released a video detailing how Junior was filmed at such a small size; the video is included on the Season Five DVD.  According to the video, fans speculated upon an outside modification being used, but in reality the crew simply used <a href="/wiki/Forced_perspective" id="w">forced perspective</a>.  In shots were Junior is standing next to other characters, the crew deposited the Junior avatar in the background of the shot and kept the feet of all the characters obscured so the distance between the characters was not noticeable.  In perspective shots where the characters looked down at Junior, the &#34;camera&#34; was simply positioned on top of the Warthog so that it was higher; similarly, in shots from Junior&#39;s perspective, the characters would then stand on top of the Warthog.  Matt Hullum edited the image of a foot of one of the characters to look larger than it was, and deposited it next to Junior in perspective shots to make Junior look smaller than he really was.</p>

<p>In episode 81, it is revealed that a tapping noise inside the large ship that dropped into the gulch has been coming from Grif&#39;s sister, who is referred to as <b>&#34;Sister&#34;</b> by both teams. She tells the Reds she joined in order to be reunited with Grif, and that Command had sent her as a new recruit since one team member will be promoted to replace their deceased commanding officer. The reason that she was not affected by the 800 years between her departure and arrival was that she had mistakenly used the ship&#39;s light-speed drive, in accordance with the Theory of Relativity. It is revealed in episode 84 that she is color-blind, and thus joined the Blue Army by mistake. In episode 85, Grif releases her to the Blue Team, and in the next episode the Blues give her an orientation but are interrupted by Tex firing on them.  When Tex calms down, she expresses indignation at the fact that the Blue Team has acquired a new girl after she&#39;d only been gone for a few weeks. In episodes 88 and 89, Tex and Sister have a private conversation while Church and Tucker discuss the consequences of having two girls on the team. </p>
<p>Soon after, Doc says that he needs to give her a physical due to her being a new soldier; Tucker is left jealous at the fact that Doc was giving her a physical while she was naked. Meanwhile, the Red Team, who are underground the time, find some surveillance equipment and see her naked, infuriating Grif but intriguing Sarge and Simmons.  When Church follows Vic Jr&#39;s orders to attack the Reds, he sends Doc, Sister and Junior into the caves as per his orders.  In the caves, the trio find Lopez&#39;s disembodied head, and as they talk to him, they are approached by a new Alien and its friend, a very much alive Captain Flowers. She, Doc, and Junior are then held captive by Flowers and the new Alien in the underground cavern, until O&#39;Malley leaves Flowers&#39;s body in {{rvbep}}.</p>
<p>In one ending to episode 100, Sister kills Sarge, and then her brother Grif after he kills Tucker, stating that she liked him. Following this, Donut runs her over while driving a <a href="/wiki/Covenant_Vehicles_in_Halo#Ghost" id="w">Ghost</a>. In another ending, which features the same events as the first but also has &#34;Where Are They Now&#34; information about the characters, it is stated that &#34;Sister works as an etiquette coach at the prestigious Paris Hilton School for girls&#34;.  In the canon ending, she is simply seen talking to Tucker in the background and her fate is unknown.</p>
<p>Although Rebecca Frasier was a good friend of the Rooster Teeth production crew, Burnie Burns intended to allow other women to audition for the role of Sister despite the pressure of the other members.  He notes two other girls auditioned for the role before Frasier was given her chance, but when she began auditioning the team made something of a joke out of the audition, slipping in more and more lines of dialogue which got increasingly more vulgar to see how far Frasier would go before refusing to do a line.  Upon realising she had no such limits, Frasier was cast as Sister and the role was re-written as a far more promiscuous character to fit with the lines she had read in the audition.<sup id="_ref-S5DVDComm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S5DVDComm" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>Full name: Lopez &#34;the Heavy&#34;  / Droid #01011331123<sup id="_ref-S3DVDProfiles_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S3DVDProfiles" title="">[1]</a></sup></li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>

<ul>
<li>Voice actor: <a href="/wiki/Burnie_Burns" id="w">Burnie Burns</a> (in intentionally poorly accented Spanish)</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>A robot built by Sarge, <b>Lopez</b> speaks in a stereotypically monotonic robotic voice. He was originally affiliated with the Red team.  Because Sarge neglected to <a href="/wiki/Ground_(electricity)" id="w">ground</a> himself when installing Lopez&#39;s voice card, it was damaged by <a href="/wiki/Electrostatics" id="w">static electricity</a>, consequently, Lopez can only speak intentionally incorrect Spanish, although he can still understand English perfectly. English subtitles are provided for most of the Spanish dialogue. After his voice card is installed, Lopez begins to call himself &#34;<i>Lopez la Pesado</i>&#34; {{sic}} (&#34;Lopez the Heavy&#34;) in {{rvbep}} and demonstrates a stoic, tough personality. He also tends to exhibit characteristics that are stereotypically <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" id="w">Latin American</a>, such as a strong <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialist</a> ideology. As he had been programmed by Sarge, Lopez also dislikes Grif; in a brief first-person camera view, a list of Lopez&#39;s objectives are displayed, one of them being &#34;Hate the orange one.&#34;</p>
<p>Near the end of {{rvbep}}, Church <a href="/wiki/Possession" id="w">possesses</a> Lopez and later has the other Blues paint his body cobalt to match the color of his old armor. Initially, Church can only speak in Spanish while possessing Lopez. However, before the events of {{rvbep}}, the beginning of {{rvbep}}, the Blues manage to partially disable Lopez&#39; Spanish language setting, allowing Church to speak English. After being temporarily freed from Church&#39;s control, Lopez defects to the Blue Team when the Reds, mistaking him for a Blue soldier, attempt to kill him. As a Blue, he repairs and falls in love with Sheila. He eventually develops a resistance to possession and shortly afterwards has his old armor color restored.</p>
<p>At the end of season 2, O&#39;Malley captures Lopez and reprograms him to become another tool in his plan to conquer the universe. O&#39;Malley completes a weather control system, inside Lopez; left unfinished by Sarge, this system is capable of eliminating both teams. Red Command also had embedded top-secret strategic information inside Lopez&#39;s head. As such, the Reds are forced to cooperate with the Blues to chase O&#39;Malley and attempt to recover Lopez.</p>
<p>In the explosion that propelled both teams into the future, Lopez is reduced to a disembodied head. Somehow, he is still able to fire a machine-gun turret and even build an army of robot soldiers; as Simmons explains, &#34;He&#39;s very determined.&#34; Absent for most of season 4, Lopez had been in hiding with Doc and O&#39;Malley in a secret lair. He is without a body, and his frustration with the two has increased. In {{rvbep}}, the Reds find Lopez and the instructions that Red Command had embedded in his head. However, the instructions are in Spanish, and none of the Reds can understand them.  </p>
<p>Having served under Red, Blue, and O&#39;Malley, Lopez is increasingly tired of the conflict and makes numerous requests to simply die, asking Caboose to bury him. However, because no one understands what he says in Spanish, his requests are in vain. He pointed out to the Reds in episode 76 that the instructions were disappointing, a prediction that was confirmed in {{rvbep}}, when, after hearing the useless instructions translated by Andy, Sarge sinks into a brief depression.</p>
<p>After another lengthy absence, Lopez&#39;s head is rediscovered in the caves by Sister and Doc. Sister manages to communicate with Lopez in Spanish, only to be mocked by him.  Lopez goes on to reveal in an off-screen conversation how he came to be in the caves, described by Doc as being &#34;strange yet totally believable&#34;, before being interrupted by the possessed Captain Flowers. He is left behind in the caves and was in the same cavern as Andy.</p>
<p>In the final episode of the series, Lopez reunites with Sheila, who was recently transferred to the large ship that brought {{rvbchar}} to the Gulch, and shortly before she may or may not have been blown up to prevent O&#39;Malley from using her to escape the canyon. Lopez&#39;s fate beyond this is left unanswered.</p>

<p>The common enemy of both the Red and Blue Teams, <b>O&#39;Malley</b> is an <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" id="w">AI</a>, similar to <a href="/wiki/Cortana" id="w">Cortana</a> in the original <i>Halo</i>, that was put into Tex&#39;s armor during training in order to make her more aggressive and dangerous. According to Wyoming, O&#39;Malley&#39;s real name is <b>Omega</b>. The name <i>O&#39;Malley</i> originates from a <a href="/wiki/Portmanteau" id="w">portmanteau</a> of <i>Omega</i> and <i>Allison</i>, Tex&#39;s real name (Om&#39;Ali). O&#39;Malley is evil and aggressive, a <a href="/wiki/Parody" id="w">parody</a> of over-the-top <a href="/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder" id="w">megalomaniacal</a> <a href="/wiki/Supervillain" id="w">supervillains</a>. O&#39;Malley wants to annihilate both teams, either to destroy or take over the universe, and to &#34;crush every living soul into dust&#34; (except Vic). He expresses these desires in long monologues accompanied by extended fits of evil laughter and extreme <a href="/wiki/Close-up" id="w">close-up</a> shots of his visor. He is also able to understand Lopez&#39;s Spanish, but needs help to issue commands to Lopez&#39;s robot army, and occasionally mispronounces words (pronouncing <i>nuclear</i> as <i><a href="/wiki/Nucular" id="w">nucular</a></i> and struggling with the word <i>fruition</i>).</p>
<p>Toward the end of season 1, just before Tex attacks the Reds for the second time, O&#39;Malley assesses that Tex has little chance of survival and leaps via <a href="/wiki/Radio" id="w">radio</a> into Caboose. Under O&#39;Malley&#39;s possession, Caboose periodically makes threatening statements in &#34;a scary voice,&#34; but O&#39;Malley is never able to take full control. After being forced out of Caboose by Church and Tex, O&#39;Malley possesses Doc, of whom he is able to take almost total control and use to further his own agenda.  He seems to work for Vic to some degree, hiring Wyoming to take out Tucker, claiming Vic will give them a bonus for killing him, but it is unknown if this deal was permanent or temporary.</p>
<p>O&#39;Malley&#39;s confrontation with the Alien near the end of season 3 leaves his fate ambiguous, but it is revealed in episode 73 that Lopez, Doc, and he are still alive and have been hiding in a secret lair. In the {{rvbep}}, O&#39;Malley, Doc, and Lopez return to Blood Gulch, at the request of Church, to <a href="/wiki/Diagnosis" id="w">diagnose</a> Tucker&#39;s illness. In return, O&#39;Malley demands something to be named later. He never does name his price, however, as at the end of Season Four, he takes his chances and jumps via radio out of Doc. </p>
<p>Throughout most of {{rvbep}} his location is unknown; the Blue Team assuming he is in Sheila because of her erratic and violent behavior. The suspicion then falls on Church when Sheila reveals O&#39;Malley&#39;s current location to be &#34;the Blue leader.&#34; This is quickly dispelled by Church in episode 96 as he was never officially promoted, and it is then revealed that O&#39;Malley is currently inhabiting Captain Butch Flowers.  It is ultimately revealed that he is intending to infect Junior as soon as the latter takes possession of Tucker&#39;s sword, so that he can control Junior and exploit the Aliens. In episode 100, after Tex begins broadcasting on an open channel to lure O&#39;Malley, the AI instead jumps into Simmons, leading to his being knocked out by Tex, and continues to jump from character to character. When he finally jumps into Tex, they take the ship and begin to lift off, but Andy, who was already placed on the ship by the Red team, detonates, killing everyone on it, including O&#39;Malley.</p>
<p>One of the few characters to be voiced by more than one actor, several of the production crew, including Burnie Burns, have claimed they prefer the O&#39;Malley presented by Matt Hullum (while the AI controls Doc) rather than the O&#39;Malley in Caboose (voiced by Joel Heyman).  Hullum brings about more depth to the role, and the O&#39;Malley presented by him has been regarded as a combination of <a href="/wiki/Stewie_Griffin" id="w">Stewie Griffin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dr._Evil" id="w">Dr. Evil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gollum" id="w">Gollum</a> and many other villains.<sup id="_ref-S2DVD_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S2DVD" title="">[2]</a></sup>  In the final episode, O&#39;Malley jumps to nearly everyone in the canyon, and is then voiced by each character&#39;s respective voice actor.</p>

<p><b>Doc</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Medic" id="w">medic</a> sent to Blood Gulch to treat injuries on both armies, despite the lack of medical skill that he often displays.  As he is not a qualified doctor, he doesn&#39;t take to his new nickname of Doc, forced upon him by Church because of his refusal/inability to pronounce his surname.  He is also a <a href="/wiki/Pacifism" id="w">pacifist</a> of the most extreme kind, and tries to avoid doing or even <i>saying</i> anything that would seem remotely aggressive or competitive. His extreme pacifism in the middle of a war quickly earns him the ire of both teams, and he is eventually exiled to a cavern equidistant from both bases. As revealed in the bonus material on the season 3 DVD, this pacifism had also caused him to be released from the Red Army before the events of <i>The Blood Gulch Chronicles</i>, thereby necessitating the draft that has forced Grif into military service.  The profile also states he is the only person in history to enlist in an army as a &#39;conscientious objector&#39;.<sup id="_ref-S3DVDProfiles_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S3DVDProfiles" title="">[1]</a></sup> He has also stated that he is a <a href="/wiki/Vegetarianism" id="w">vegetarian</a>.</p>
<p>When Tex and Church force O&#39;Malley out of Caboose, O&#39;Malley finds a new host in Doc. Split-personality <a href="/wiki/Gollum" id="w">Gollum/Sméagol</a> conversations and arguments between O&#39;Malley and Doc frequently occur. However, the difference between Doc and O&#39;Malley is even greater than it is for the former pair. Doc apologizes on occasion for O&#39;Malley&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Trash_talk" id="w">trash talk</a> and conduct; O&#39;Malley, on the other hand, frequently tells him to shut up. As the series progresses, both personalities apparently grow more accustomed to each other.</p>
<p>Although Doc has failed <a href="/wiki/Medical_school" id="w">medical school</a> and his lack of medical knowledge is apparent — he rubs Caboose&#39;s neck with <a href="/wiki/Aloe" id="w">aloe vera</a> to treat a bullet wound in the foot, agrees with Grif&#39;s using <a href="/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation" id="w">CPR</a> to treat the bullet wound to Sarge&#39;s head, and has no idea what his medical tool does except glow green when something is wrong — Church seems to depend on him to treat injury and illness. In {{rvbep}}, Church wants to pursue Doc — who, under O&#39;Malley&#39;s possession, had fled to Sidewinder — to have him help Tucker, who had been hit by a rocket. Later, when Tucker becomes ill in {{rvbep}}, Church calls Doc for help. In episode 77, O&#39;Malley leaves Doc to possess another person after the Reds, unaware of his presence, contact their Command via radio. Free of O&#39;Malley, Doc continues to aid the pregnant Tucker and subsequently the newborn alien.  In addition, Church uses Doc as someone expendable to determine the cause of Sheila&#39;s erratic behavior, on the grounds that he will either fix Sheila, break her so that Church himself can freely examine her, or get blown up trying; all of which are beneficial to Church. He is later sent into the caves with Sister and Junior to ambush the Reds, and is confronted by Captain Flowers, O&#39;Malley and an alien, who take he, Junior, and Sister hostage and bring them down to the underground computer terminal. When Captain Flowers collapses, he and Sister return above ground, where Doc is briefly reinfected after O&#39;Malley leaves Grif, only to just as quickly pass to Church.</p>
<p>In the Fight, Fight ending of Episode 100, Doc revives Sarge, who had been killed by Church and Tucker. Sarge then blasts Doc with his shotgun before being killed by Sister. Doc was badly injured, but alive for a while until Tucker shot him in an attempt to get Sister to sleep with him. In the official ending, he is simply seen walking in the background.</p>
<p>The original plan for Doc&#39;s character, as noted by the Rooster Teeth crew, was simply to provide a vessel for O&#39;Malley to jump into, and also to display his pacifism. Matt Hullum notes going through several different accents for the character, such as Cockney, French and Australian, before settling on his own voice to use, as he was unsure in which direction to take the character.<sup id="_ref-S2DVD_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S2DVD" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>A ruthless <a href="/wiki/Mercenary" id="w">mercenary</a> with a <a href="/wiki/British_accent" id="w">British accent</a> — his character profile on the DVDs states his place of birth as &#34;somewhere British&#34;<sup id="_ref-S4DVDProfiles_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S4DVDProfiles" title="">[8]</a></sup> — <b>Wyoming</b> is hired by O&#39;Malley to kill Tucker. Like Tex, Wyoming had been trained in a secret project, in which all the participants were paired with an AI and code named after one of the 49 American states still in existence at the time.<sup id="_ref-Florida_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Florida" title="">[9]</a></sup>  Little to anyone&#39;s knowledge until late in the series, Wyoming&#39;s AI had been Gary.</p>
<p>Wyoming has a habit of giving an insincere &#34;sorry&#34; to his victims just prior to killing them,<sup id="_ref-Wyoming_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wyoming" title="">[10]</a></sup> but, in one instance, retracts this apology when Tex complains to him that he has destroyed what she considers <i>her</i> alien ship.<sup id="_ref-Ep71_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ep71" title="">[11]</a></sup> He also is never shown getting agitated, showing no signs of annoyance when he can&#39;t spot Tucker in the group - indeed, he seems impressed.  </p>
<p>During Wyoming&#39;s search for Tucker, he single-handedly eliminates the entire Sidewinder Red Team (Tex had already killed the Sidewinder Blues before the events of the series proper, as depicted in a <a href="/wiki/Flashback_(literary_technique)" id="w">flashback</a> in {{rvbep}}). In {{rvbep}}, he is also responsible for shooting a rocket launcher out of Tucker&#39;s hands, thereby preventing Tucker from killing Church before the bomb inside the latter explodes (although according to one of the time-traveling Churches, this act had little consequence, as the present was destroyed either way). In the middle of season 4, the quest team discovers that Wyoming has survived the explosion: He appears in the temple in the Great Freezing Plains, for a purpose yet to be revealed, and kills the Alien and destroys his ship. He then runs from the scene, pursued by a furious Tex.  </p>
<p>In <i>Out Of Mind</i> he uses a Warthog to escape Tex, but she manages to place a homing device on it. However, Wyoming has a conversation with a thus-far unnamed associate in which it is evident that both he and his benefactor are planning something for Tex.  Later in the mini-series, York&#39;s AI mentions Wyoming underwent mental damage after his AI, Gamma, removed itself from his system, and York mentions that &#34;Reggie&#34; had a penchant for <a href="/wiki/Knock-knock_jokes" id="w">knock-knock jokes</a>, something Gary is notorious for.  After O&#39;Malley leaves his base behind to travel to Blood Gulch (as seen in Season Four), Wyoming remains behind to safeguard the base.  Tex and York stage an assault, and Wyoming, with two underlings, confronts them.  Wyoming kills York but finds himself at the mercy of Tex, who threatens to &#34;pummel [Wyoming] senseless&#34; and extract information from his gear after he reveals he knows of O&#39;Malley&#39;s jump into someone else. After the threat, Wyoming decides to tell her, but Tex decides to use her method anyway. According to Tex, Wyoming teleported away before she could interrogate him. After learning the name of Wyoming&#39;s AI, Gamma, Church deduces that the computer Gary is in actuality Gamma, and therefore is the one responsible for teleporting Wyoming to his location.</p>
<p>At some point after he was transported to the future, he hired at least four red and blue bodyguards, two of them having accents.  Little is known about these guards, or when, how, or even why Wyoming hired them.  One of the few things certain is that the four that appeared are all dead, three of them Tex&#39;s hands, the last one by York.  These guards only appeared in <i>Out of Mind</i>.  He has since retrieved Gary from the computer terminal of O&#39;Malley&#39;s fortress, and reappeared in Blood Gulch, taking the Blues hostage with the help of Gary, controlling the tank which used to house Sheila.</p>
<p>As part of the same super-soldier program as Tex, Wyoming was granted not only an AI but a special ability. The ability is revealed during Wyoming&#39;s attack on the Blues (occupying the Red Base at the time) when he continually <a href="/wiki/Time_loop" id="w">loops a particular stretch of time</a> in order to modify events in his favour. His use of the time looping is discovered by Tucker, who was aware of the time loop thanks to his sword. Tucker eventually lulled Wyoming into complacency and stabbed him with the sword early in the loop, killing him. However he and Church quickly discovered that as with the time loop that Church once experienced, several copies of Wyoming were being created and were congregating under the Red Base. In the resulting chaos, Gary was disabled and, to the surprise of the Blues, the Reds attacked the Wyomings, leaving only one alive. Cornering him, the Blues discovered the villains&#39;s ultimate plot. In episode 100, the final Wyoming is dispatched by Tex, while Church tries to broadcast to hide Tex from Omega. Tex then uses Wyoming&#39;s helmet to obtain coordinates for the ship in which she later escapes. The helmet is destroyed along with everybody else when the ship explodes.</p> 
<p>The auditions for Wyoming are described by the cast as &#34;terrible&#34;; with the exception of Gus Sorola, every cast member auditioned for the role doing various accents - for example, Joel Heyman performed a <a href="/wiki/Cockney" id="w">Cockney</a> accent, Burnie Burns an Australian accent - and eventually Matt Hullum&#39;s British accent was chosen because everything else was so bad.<sup id="_ref-S3DVDComment_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S3DVDComment" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>Built by Tex, <b>Andy</b> is the short-tempered, rude, and vulgar bomb that Caboose carries into the fortress. Andy also expresses a desire to destroy things by detonating himself, much to the worry of the Blue Team, who attempts to calm him down. However, Andy later wishes to avoid detonation when Tex threatens to detonate him if he will not translate for them. However, this desire resurfaces later when Andy attempts to convince Church to let him guard, and destroy in the process, the Blue Base. Caboose reveals that Andy had told him about the Reds&#39; secret meeting, but the rest of the Blues refuse to believe Caboose at first, as Andy remains silent when they approach. However, he has an outburst when Gary insults him and reveals that the two &#34;are not on speaking terms.&#34; </p>
<p>Because Tex built Andy from the remains of an old protocol <a href="/wiki/Droid" id="w">droid</a> found on the perimeter of the base, he is able to understand the Alien&#39;s language, and, as such, joins the sacred quest group to act as a <a href="/wiki/Translation" id="w">translator</a>. After the failure of the quest, Caboose brings him back to the gulch. In {{rvbep}}, the Reds steal Andy to translate a recording for them, and their methods leave Caboose with the impression that Andy is dead. In the next episode, Andy explains to Church that the Alien had impregnated Tucker. Late in Season Five, it is revealed Andy is also in the underground cave, working with the mysterious alien and Captain Flowers as a translator. He is also fully aware of the importance of Junior to Wyoming and O&#39;Malley, but no one has listened to his explanation thus far before cutting him off.</p>
<p>Andy is apparently self-conscious about his weight. In {{rvbep}}, after O&#39;Malley repeatedly calls him &#34;bowling ball,&#34; Andy asks Caboose if he does indeed resemble one, claiming that he has been working out. When Sarge steals Andy, and then remarks that Andy is much lighter than the last time he tried to pick him up, Andy is relieved that someone has noticed. Later, he worked for O&#39;Malley (who had possessed Captain Flowers) but was left in the caves after Flowers learned enough Alien language to get by.  Andy is soon found by the Red Team, but they also leave him behind. They return to pick him up in episode 100 and plant him in the ship as a contingency plan, and order him to detonate if O&#39;Malley tries to escape in the ship. In almost all of the endings, Andy does do, killing everyone aboard; however, in one non-canon ending, he does not explode and Tex instead kills everyone on the ground with a missile.  Andy&#39;s fate is then unknown.</p>
<p>In the season 4 DVD commentary, the series creators stated that they originally wanted to explain Andy&#39;s rudeness by making him bitter about being rejected by Sheila, but it was never incorporated into the series.</p>

<p>Appearing for the first time at the end of season 3, the <b>Alien</b> scares Church&#39;s spirit out of his host body after having already wiped out Lopez&#39;s robot army and defeated O&#39;Malley single-handedly. This prompts the Blues to attempt to hunt him down, but they suffer a series of humiliating defeats. Even Tex is cut down seconds after attempting to attack the Alien, and, like Church, is forced to flee her host body. Eventually, however, Caboose manages to befriend the Alien, who had found him unpalatable after biting him once. Conversely, the Alien has a strong odor to the Blues, who describe the smell with a series of unpleasant analogies.</p>
<p>The Alien has a habit of staying crouched, and its language appears to consist entirely of <i>blarg</i> and <i>honk</i>. It seems to understand English to some degree, as Andy is only heard to speak in its language once and it responds to other characters when they speak English, but it is unable to communicate in English. When asked for a name, the Alien replies, &#34;Honk Honk,&#34; though it is never established whether that is indeed his name. Caboose has called the Alien &#34;<b>Crunch-bite</b>&#34; and &#34;Fluffy,&#34; and Tex speculates at one point that the Alien might be named <b>Honk-Honk</b>. Andy initially suggests <b>Crouchasaurus</b>, a name that, according to the season 3 DVD commentary, had been initially suggested by a fan unfamiliar with <i>Halo</i>. However, the character is listed as &#34;Alien&#34; on the credits of the season 4 DVD.  Gary later claims that the Alien is a member of the species that built him. </p>
<p>The Alien reveals in episodes {{rvbep}} and {{rvbep}} that he was on a quest to retrieve the sword that Tucker had discovered when he fell into the hole under the windmill so that he could save his race from extinction.  When the Alien first spots Tucker with the sword, he begins to attack and beat Tucker to a pulp relentlessly, apparently upset that Tucker had discovered the sword first; the sword only works for its original finder. The Alien consequently forces Tucker to join him on his quest, threatening to kill everyone otherwise.  When the sacred quest team reaches the temple in the Great Freezing Plains, the Alien has Tucker use the sword to unlock the gates to an alien ship, whose existence had been previously undisclosed, even to Andy. The Alien takes off in the ship, but he is almost immediately killed by Wyoming, thus leaving the Alien&#39;s true intentions unclear.  </p>
<p>In {{rvbep}}, Tucker complains that the Alien is always standing over him when he awakes. This is not discussed at length in that episode, as Tex assumes that the Alien is simply obsessing over the sword. However, Andy accidentally reveals at the end of season 4 that the Alien&#39;s race reproduces by implanting <a href="/wiki/Parasite" id="w">parasitic</a> <a href="/wiki/Embryo" id="w">embryos</a> in other beings. Soon after, Tucker gives birth to the &#34;baby,&#34; who is heard off-camera speaking in higher-pitched <i>honk</i>s and <i>blarg</i>s.</p>
<p>In {{rvbep}} Tucker explains that the Alien&#39;s prophecy concerning the sword providing salvation for the Aliens did not fail with his death; instead, Junior, the son of Tucker and the Alien, is the intended saviour of the Alien race.</p>

<p><b>Vic</b>, a sardonic and frequently unhelpful communications officer, is the Blue Team&#39;s contact at Blue Command. A misunderstanding between him and a time-traveling Church <a href="/wiki/Retcon" id="w">retcons</a> events and leaves Vic under the impression that Red and Blue are the same, with the result that Vic also becomes the Red Team&#39;s contact at Red Command. The miscommunication is unrealized by Church, and this change is entirely unknown to him and the rest of the Reds and Blues, except for Tucker, who accidentally intercepts a communication between Sarge and Vic. However, no member of either team believes Tucker, as he is knocked unconscious when he makes the discovery, and Vic manages to contact Sarge and warn against listening to Tucker before the latter tells everyone. Vic is apparently working with O&#39;Malley to some degree, although he seems to regard O&#39;Malley as more of a necessary annoyance than a partner, and O&#39;Malley hires an assassin called Wyoming to kill Tucker in order to preserve the secret that Red and Blue are the same. </p>
<p>Vic behaves like an annoying, ineffective <a href="/wiki/Technical_support" id="w">technical support</a> guy, constantly calling people &#34;dude&#34; and often offering obtuse and unhelpful advice and biting insults. He can be quite inappropriate, at one point forcing Doc into a lengthy conversation about Vic&#39;s sterility in {{rvbep}}.

<p><b>Gary</b><sup id="_ref-cat_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cat" title="">[14]</a></sup> is a computer, similar to Durandal in <i><a href="/wiki/Marathon_(computer_game)" id="w">Marathon</a></i>, that Church meets after being propelled into the past. He claims the facility is the housing facility of the Great Weapon, which is later revealed to be the fortress that O&#39;Malley occupies in the future. In the future, Gary is seen as the base computer of the fortress, although he does not talk until Church arrives there. He is fond of jokes, and sometimes uses <a href="/wiki/Knock-knock_joke" id="w">knock-knock jokes</a> to communicate instead of giving a straight answer. Claiming to have been built by the race of the Alien, Gary knows nothing about his creators, but only of The Great Destroyer and his race, the <i>Shisno</i>, a <a href="/wiki/Pejorative" id="w">pejorative</a> of <a href="/wiki/Human_being" id="w">humans</a> described as the equivalent of the feces of the feces of the foulest-smelling animal on the planet. </p>
<p>Upon learning of The Great Prophecy, Church has Gary research and build a teleporter to transport him back to Blood Gulch in the recent past, in an attempt to prevent everything that has gone wrong. At near full processing power, Gary takes slightly over a millennium to finish this task, having spent some processing time telling jokes.</p>
<p>Despite his humorous disposition, Gary is polite and well-mannered, which makes his relationship with Andy very terse.  At one point, the two bicker with each other, and Gary gets irritated at Andy&#39;s uncouth nature.  But when the &#34;Sacred Quest&#34; team leave the fortress, and Church returns to Blood Gulch, Gary is left behind, and nothing is seen of him until Season 5.</p>
<p>After learning the name of Wyoming&#39;s AI (Gamma), Church concludes that Gary is actually Gamma and not an alien computer. Church phones Gary, and after an awkward conversation of Gary saying he is not Gamma, Gary hangs up, and has a short conversation with Wyoming himself, who instructs Gary to &#34;hop in.&#34; It is later apparent that Gary used Wyoming&#39;s special time travelling ability to transport himself back in time to contact Church.</p>
<p>At the end of Episode 97 Gary is now in the the tank which previously housed Sheila&#39;s AI.  He begins to shoot at the Blues under the command of Wyoming, but Tucker, taking control of the situation, plugs a cable from the ship housing Sheila into the tank and downloads Gary into the ship, where Sheila manages to lock him behind a firewall. He is blown up along with the rest of the ship by Andy in the final episode.</p>

<p><b>Captain Butch Flowers</b> was the Blue Team&#39;s previous <a href="/wiki/Commanding_officer" id="w">commanding officer</a> at Blood Gulch. His character is introduced when Church arrives at the past Blood Gulch after traveling back in time. Flowers and Tucker had planned to pull out of Blood Gulch, but when the then current Church arrived with the news that the Blue base on Sidewinder had been wiped out, they were forced to abandon this effort. Flowers had been planning to lead a Blue offensive to destroy the Red Team in Blood Gulch, and knew the key to the Blues&#39; victory. However, before he can lead the attack or reveal his plans—and order a sniper rifle for Tucker—he dies from what Church and Tucker assume is a <a href="/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" id="w">heart attack</a> in his sleep. It turns out that the time-traveling Church&#39;s attempt to save Flowers&#39; life is exactly what causes his death; Flowers suffers a fatal <a href="/wiki/Allergy" id="w">allergic</a> reaction to the <a href="/wiki/Aspirin" id="w">aspirin</a> in the medication that Church gives him. After Flowers&#39; death, Tucker, who had been wearing regulation blue armor, claims his captain&#39;s armor for himself. In {{rvbep}}, it is revealed that one of the Blues is to be promoted to captain, and Grif&#39;s sister is sent to fill the discrepancy. </p>
<p>Captain Flowers returns in episode 96, wearing regulation blue armor, accompanied by a new alien. He is revealed to be O&#39;Malley&#39;s current host, and expresses a strong interest in Junior. Andy reveals in episode 97 that the New Alien brought him back to life to help him locate the previous Alien. In episode 99, he talks to Vic Jr. where they discuss their plans concerning Junior, and Flowers mentions that the New Alien is still unaware of their intentions to corrupt his race. He rejoins the Blue team in the final episode, but is shot in the head before he has a chance to reveal the information key to the Blues&#39; victory, due to delaying for an overly extended dramatic pause. Tucker said he was glad since he didn&#39;t want to give back his armor.</p>

<p>Somewhere in his history with Tex and Wyoming, his left eye was &#34;broken&#34; in an attempt to defeat Tex while O&#39;Malley was still implanted in her head.  This event has left him bitter toward O&#39;Malley, and he accepts Tex&#39;s proposal of infiltrating his base out of pride.</p>
<p>At the end of <i>Out of Mind</i>, he and Tex attempt a raid on O&#39;Malley&#39;s base. The two are caught in a firefight against Wyoming and two of Wyoming&#39;s minions. Tex tries to shoot Wyoming, but her gun malfunctions. As the two scramble for cover, York is shot twice in the upper chest by Wyoming; Delta reports that the bullets were fatal. The AI stays with York and manages to fool Wyoming with a hologram of Tex, until York&#39;s death, with Delta appearing to perish as York&#39;s armor shuts down, having chosen to stay with York to maintain his pain medication as opposed to going with Tex.</p>
<a id="Delta" name="Delta"></a><h2>Delta</h2>

<ul>
<li>Nickname: &#34;D&#34;</li>
<li>Colour: Green</li>
<li>Voice Actor: Mark Bellman</li>
<li>Appearances: <i>Out of Mind</i> Parts Three-Five, <i>Recovery One</i> Part One, Three and Four</li></ul>
<p>Another AI created in the same program as Omega and Gamma, <b>Delta</b> (&#34;D&#34; for short) is the AI originally assigned to the operative codenamed York.  Unlike the other experimental program recruits, York still has his AI with him. This is because unlike the other AIs, Delta does not pose a threat to anyone; instead, he is extremely logical and analytical, to the point of being largely unfamiliar with human emotions.  York often asks for Delta&#39;s advice on certain situations, such as whether or not to help Tex, and uses Delta to watch his left side during combat owing to his visual impairment.</p>
<p>Delta often appears as a holographic miniature soldier beside York&#39;s head; the green glow was created ingame by using the plasma pistol according to Burnie Burns<sup id="_ref-S5DVDComm_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S5DVDComm" title="">[6]</a></sup>.  However, Delta can modify his appearance to match the situation.  When threatened by Tex, he went &#34;on alert&#34; and his glow turned red.  Later, in a ploy to trick Wyoming, Delta managed to change his size and colour, and effectively stopped the green glow surrounding him, although it faded back in when he began to speak.  Much like his fellow AI Gamma, Delta is polite and well-mannered, even bidding good luck to his enemy Wyoming when he believed himself to be shutting down.</p>
<p>After York was fatally wounded at O&#39;Malley&#39;s base, Delta began administering some anasthetics and decided to remain with York, having picked up a fond attachment for his host despite repeatedly getting confused over other human emotions.  When an operative dies their armour shuts down AIs within them, and so it was believed Delta perished with York.  However, some time later, another agent named Washington came to collect Delta, very much alive and confused as to why he was not shut down.  Washington manually removes Delta from York&#39;s suit and takes him away. </p>
<p>He is to be implanted in another freelancer, referred to as South, in order to help Agent Washington combat an unknown enemy that has been hunting the remaining freelancers.  Following this, South betrays Washington and her commanders and escapes with Delta, claiming to have been intending to collect him all along.</p>

<p>Another member of the Special Ops unit that included Tex, Wyoming and York,  <b>Washington</b> is an embittered member of the unit who is infamous for an incident in the past where his AI, Epsilon, malfunctioned while still in his system; as a result of the accident, Washington distrusts AI constructs and refuses to allow them to be placed in his system.  According to Washington, Epsilon&#39;s mind allegedly broke down and the confused mental acitivity mixed with his own, and Washington had trouble distinguishing which thoughts were his and which were Epsilon&#39;s.  After the accident, Washington refused to be paired with AIs or even other agents again.  His commanders eventually decided to send him on a mission to retrieve other AIs from their dead hosts, knowing full well he would not place them in his system.</p>
<p>Having thus received his mission and having been condenamed <b>Recovery One</b>, Washington went about his business finding AIs and transporting them, including York&#39;s AI Delta.  After retrieving the latter from O&#39;Malley&#39;s base and being attacked by an unidentified assailant, Washington was ordered to locate a pair of twins codenamed North and South and recover North&#39;s AI, Theta.  Upon reaching the twins, he discovered North already dead, South distraught, and Theta gone.  His commanders ordered him to execute South to keep the situation quiet, but Washington instead only pretended to, and kept South alive, believing the unit members were being hunted and their AIs stolen, and thinking he would need South&#39;s help to stop their enemy.  However, once he gave Delta to South and ordered her to get the AI back to base, she double-crossed him and shot him in the back to distract their attacker; it turned out his commanders had been counting on him keeping South alive so that the attacker would be drawn into the open and a strategy against it could be devised.  South told the attacker that she had set a charge on Washington&#39;s armour to explode, and reported Washington to command as Killed In Action.</p>

<p><b>The Red Zealot</b> is one of the eternally <a href="/wiki/Spawning_(computer_gaming)" id="w">respawning</a> Red Team members from Battle Creek. A hyperactive, frantic, melodramatic fellow with a high-pitched voice, the Red Zealot has a more staunchly religious mindset than his comrades do, and his fast-paced speech consists almost entirely of <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Biblical</a>-type quotes and religious <a href="/wiki/Dogma" id="w">dogma</a>, often speaking about <a href="/wiki/Crusade" id="w">crusades</a> and <a href="/wiki/Promised_land" id="w">promised lands</a> during battles.  He later teams up with O&#39;Malley after being separated from the other Grunts, having been convinced the rogue AI is in fact the guardian of the Holy Temple. O&#39;Malley, Doc, and Lopez find him annoying, but tolerate him because he performs menial tasks without complaint and even with a degree of enjoyment. Ultimately, Tucker kills him when the Red and Blue alliance launches its attack on O&#39;Malley&#39;s fortress.  A deleted scene in the season 3 DVD shows the Red Zealot resurrecting and vowing revenge, but as he is not seen again after this, it is not confirmed if this scene is canon.</p>

<p>The <b>Grunts</b><sup id="_ref-S3DVDComment_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S3DVDComment" title="">[12]</a></sup> are a group of eternally respawning Reds and Blues originally from Battle Creek. Except for The Red Zealot, they have no known official individual names. Initially engaged in <i>Halo</i>&#39;s version of <a href="/wiki/Capture_the_flag" id="w">Capture the Flag</a>, the group parodies the multiplayer games available in <i>Halo</i> and the stereotypical yet accurate behaviors of <i>Halo</i> <a href="/wiki/Gamer" id="w">gamers</a>, using terms like &#34;rocket whore,&#34; &#34;<a href="/wiki/Camping_(computer_gaming)" id="w">camper</a>,&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Newbie" id="w">noob</a>.&#34;</p>
<p>Having been teleported to Battle Creek at the end of season 2, Sarge and Caboose first encounter the Grunts near the beginning of season 3 and soon have to avoid being caught in the group&#39;s fire; eventually, they manage to escape with Simmons&#39; help. Simmons later teleports the group to Sidewinder and convinces them to defeat O&#39;Malley by claiming that the latter has their flag, but are thus caught in the time-shattering explosion. In the future, both teams are seen working together to guard the temple in the Great Freezing Plains.  Despite the team-up, they still exchange trash talk with each other over armor color. It is unknown why they were guarding the Freezing Plains, or why they decided to team up together at all.</p>

<p><b>Vic Jr.</b> originally appears at the end of {{rvbep}}, when Church accidentally contacts him via radio, and reveals himself to be a distant future descendant of the Vic from the present. Vic Jr. scoffs at Church&#39;s mention of Blue Command and notes that there is a lot of information to divulge. Neither this information nor the nature of the organization to which Vic Jr. actually belong has yet been revealed.  It has also not yet been explained how Vic has been able to have descendants, as he had previously mentioned his <a href="/wiki/Vasectomy" id="w">vasectomy</a> to Doc.  This fact was acknowledged in {{rvbep}}, but not resolved. Toward the beginning of Season 5, Church attempted to contact Vic Jr. for reinforcements, but Vic was not at his post and his message box turned out to be full after a lengthy and somewhat nonsensical set of instructions.  He later contacted Church, telling him to immediately attack the Red base, going through the caves, then hanging up before Church could get any more information.  Not long after, he is contacted by the Reds, but hangs up when he somehow notices Simmons arriving at the surveillance console in the caverns. It is yet to be revealed where he is located, though Simmons, unaware of who Sarge was talking to, maintains that Vic Jr. is in the cavern somewhere.  In episode 99, Flowers is seen standing in front of the computer screen talking and Vic Jr. is heard responding, although his exact location is still unclear. He appears in the second ending of {{rvbep}}, where Sarge calls him for reinforcements. Vic Jr. tells Sarge that he ruined the plan by destroying the ship, making Sarge destroy the underground computer in anger.  He does not appear in the first and the third endings.</p>
<p>Burnie Burns notes that the mystery surrounding Vic and Vic Jr was deliberately left unexplained, as the crew felt that sufficient information had been given in the episodes already for fans to draw their own conclusions. <sup id="_ref-S5DVDComm_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S5DVDComm" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

The Other Alien carries a needler similar to the first Alien&#39;s. In episode 97 it was revealed that the Other Alien is seeking the original Alien for unknown reasons, and it revived Captain Flowers to assist him. The pair of them then begin searching for Junior as well. Flowers is working with O&#39;Malley, Vic Jr. and Wyoming to exploit the Alien&#39;s race, however Flowers&#39; dialogue with Vic Jr. reveals that the Other Alien is unaware of this fact.

Once they finally reach the fortress they manage to cause a large degree of chaos, but ultimately, the army is destroyed by an unseen character, later revealed to be the Alien.</p>

In a parody of old war movies, Jimmy reminisces about how he will marry his girlfriend when he gets back from the war, only to be killed moments later by the enemy. Jimmy was killed when Tex ripped his skull clean out of his head and beat him to death with it.

<p>Appearing first in Episode 52 as one of the time traveling Churchs, <b>Yellow Church</b> appeared with the group of other Churchs in Sidewinder when they discussed their failed plans to stop the bomb. He never states his plan out loud, instead replying that &#34;it didn&#39;t work&#34; and that &#34;it seemed like such a good idea at the time.&#34;</p>
<p>However, in Episode 100, he reappears with a conflicting back story. As Caboose&#39;s mental image of Sister, he is mistakenly imagined to be Church&#39;s twin brother who came on a spaceship from the moon. He says he lives with Caboose in the front of the ship, while <a href="/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)" id="w">everyone from the end of the ship lives on the opposite end of the island</a>. Despite being Caboose&#39;s own thought, Yellow Church/Mental Sister admits that this is an inherently flawed idea, but doesn&#39;t care. The mental image is killed when the real Church, chasing Tex and O&#39;Malley into and out of Caboose&#39;s mind, throws a grenade at his feet. Yellow Church had been close by, and as being killed ejects people from Caboose&#39;s mind and into the real world, the character appeared in the real Blood Gulch. He appears next to a recently deceased Wyoming, however, the armor of whom malfunctions and uses its special ability to rewind segments of time and teleport. The corpse and Yellow Church are then transported to Sidewinder, where the Churchs are gathering.</p>

<a id="The_Great_Destroyer" name="The_Great_Destroyer"></a><h1>The Great Destroyer</h1>
<p>According to &#34;The Great Prophecy&#34; of the race that had allegedly built Gary, <b>The Great Destroyer</b> is a &#34;blue being&#34; who will steal &#34;The Great Weapon&#34; and use it to bring &#34;The Great Doom&#34; to billions of people. The prophecy also states that The Great Destroyer &#34;will be known as the stupidest life form in the universe.&#34; Initially, Church assumes that this description refers to Caboose. However, it is Tucker who obtains the sword presumed to be the Great Weapon, apparently contradicting this hypothesis. Later, in the season 3 <a href="/wiki/Season_finale" id="w">finale</a>, something appears (off-camera) and single-handedly annihilates Lopez&#39;s robot army and then confronts O&#39;Malley himself as Gary announces the arrival of The Great Destroyer. The Blues assume that Tex had done the damage, but she insists that she had been attempting to activate Tucker&#39;s sword, without any success. While Church questions Gary about this, the Alien sneaks up on him. Nevertheless, Gary insists that the Great Destroyer is a Shisno (Human), another conflicting point. The entire story behind The Great Destroyer has not been fully revealed.</p>
<p>In the fifth season, it is revealed that Gary was not built by the Aliens, as he claimed, but is actually Wyoming&#39;s old AI, Gamma. It is revealed in episode 99 that he and Wyoming are working with O&#39;Malley and Vic Jr. to corrupt the alien&#39;s religion from within, but it remains unclear how much his version of the Great Prophecy is linked to this goal. </p>
