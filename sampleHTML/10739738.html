<b>Faye Morton</b> is a fictional character in the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a> <a href="/wiki/Medical_drama" id="w">medical drama</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Holby_City" id="w">Holby City</a></i>, portrayed by actress <a href="/wiki/Patsy_Kensit" id="w">Patsy Kensit</a>. The character first appeared on January 30, 2007 in the episode &#34;Into the Dark&#34; - <a href="/wiki/List_of_Holby_City_episodes/Series_Nine#Series Nine .282006-2007.29" id="w">Series 9, Episode 17</a> of the program. Kensit had made a former unrelated guest appearance on <i>Holby City&#39;s</i> sister show <a href="/wiki/Casualty_(TV_series)" id="w">Casualty</a> in 2001.</p>
<p>The character&#39;s role in the show is that of mysterious <a href="/wiki/Femme_fatale" id="w">femme fatale</a> - seemingly meek and shy but with a murderous past,<sup id="_ref-dubai_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dubai" title="">[1]</a></sup> and little aversion to deception and theft.<sup id="_ref-cod_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cod" title="">[2]</a></sup> Her introductory storyline (shot on location in <a href="/wiki/Dubai" id="w">Dubai</a>) in which she kills her husband and leaves for <a href="/wiki/Holby" id="w">Holby</a>, proved so popular that Kensit was shortlisted &#39;Best Actress&#39; in the 2007 <a href="/wiki/TV_Quick" id="w">TV Quick</a> and TV Choice Awards for her portrayal of the character within three months of arriving on the show.<sup id="_ref-award_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-award" title="">[3]</a></sup> However, the dramaticism of the character&#39;s storylines and the manner in which they reflect upon real <a href="/wiki/NHS" id="w">NHS</a> nurses has come under heavy criticism.<sup id="_ref-nmc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nmc" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h3>Background</h3>

<p>Faye Morton was one of six new characters to join <i><a href="/wiki/Holby_City" id="w">Holby City&#39;s</a></i> cast in <a href="/wiki/List_of_Holby_City_episodes/Series_Nine#Series Nine .282006-2007.29" id="w">Series 9</a>.<sup id="_ref-series9_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-series9" title="">[5]</a></sup>
Since <a href="/wiki/List_of_Holby_City_episodes/Series_Eight#Series Eight .282005-2006.29" id="w">Series 8 Episode 10</a> &#34;The Long Goodbye&#34;, and the departure from the show of its <a href="/wiki/Obstetrics_and_gynaecology" id="w">Maternity</a> ward, the series has focused on three central wards - two surgical wards and an <a href="/wiki/Acute_Assessment_Unit" id="w">Acute Assessment Unit</a>. Prior to the introduction of the character of Faye, there were just two <a href="/wiki/Nurse#Nursing titles" id="w">Ward Sisters</a> between these three wards - <a href="/wiki/Chrissie_Williams" id="w">Chrissie Williams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kyla_Tyson" id="w">Kyla Tyson</a>.  This imbalance was redressed with Faye&#39;s arrival and fast promotion from <a href="/wiki/Nurse#Nursing titles" id="w">Bank Nurse</a> to Sister of <a href="/wiki/Holby_City#Current wards" id="w">Keller Ward</a>.<sup id="_ref-promotion_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-promotion" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Early publicity for the character gave her name as &#39;Eliza Clark&#39;.  It is unknown at what stage in creation this changed to &#39;Faye Morton&#39; - while Faye was the name announced by the BBC with the news of Kensit&#39;s casting in December 2005,<sup id="_ref-patsy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-patsy" title="">[7]</a></sup> the actress was still referring to her character as Eliza as late at November 2006, when interviewed for the <a href="/wiki/Inside_Soap" id="w">Inside Soap</a> Yearbook 2007.<sup id="_ref-insidesoap_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-insidesoap" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Casting" name="Casting"></a><h3>Casting</h3>

<p>Although Faye did not first appear on-screen until February 2007, the announcement that <a href="/wiki/Patsy_Kensit" id="w">Patsy Kensit</a> had been cast as the character was made on December 14, 2005.<sup id="_ref-patsy_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-patsy" title="">[7]</a></sup> <i>Holby City&#39;s</i> Executive Producer Richard Stokes and Series Producer Emma Turner said of Kensit&#39;s casting: &#34;We are delighted to confirm that Patsy Kensit is joining the cast of Holby City.

<p>Kensit also spoke of the forty-five minute commute to work on <i>Holby</i> as a deciding factor in her move from her previous role in  <a href="/wiki/ITV" id="w">ITV</a> soap <i><a href="/wiki/Emmerdale" id="w">Emmerdale</a></i> - the long journey to and from filming the latter show cutting heavily into her time available to spend with her two sons.<sup id="_ref-commute_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-commute" title="">[10]</a></sup> She described Faye as her dream role,<sup id="_ref-castinterview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-castinterview" title="">[11]</a></sup> and revealed that in preparation for portraying the character, she spent three days shadowing a real nurse,<sup id="_ref-rt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rt" title="">[12]</a></sup> as well as witnessing open heart surgery at <a href="/wiki/University_College_Hospital" id="w">University College Hospital</a>, London, in order to bring realism to the part.<sup id="_ref-castinterview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-castinterview" title="">[11]</a></sup> Kensit said of the experience:

<p><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Mirror" id="w">The Daily Mirror&#39;s</a> television critic <a href="/wiki/Jim_Shelley_(TV_critic)" id="w">Jim Shelley</a> has noted that Kensit&#39;s casting in the role follows a recent trend of <i>Holby City</i> producers for hiring established actors, including <a href="/wiki/Comedian" id="w">comedian</a> <a href="/wiki/Adrian_Edmondson" id="w">Adrian Edmondson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jesus_of_Nazareth_(miniseries)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Jesus of Nazareth&#39;&#39;</a> star <a href="/wiki/Robert_Powell" id="w">Robert Powell</a>.<sup id="_ref-shelley_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shelley" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2>Development</h2>
<a id="Personality" name="Personality"></a><h3>Personality</h3>

<p>Initial publicity for the character stressed her enigmatic origins, with the BBC billing her &#34;a nurse who has more than a few secrets to hide and an attitude that cannot fail to ruffle the feathers of her colleagues.&#34;<sup id="_ref-intro_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-intro" title="">[17]</a></sup> This was reflected in her first on-screen appearance, whereby she simply arrived at <a href="/wiki/Holby_City_Hospital" id="w">Holby City Hospital</a> one day and requested that <a href="/wiki/Specialist_registrar" id="w">registrars</a> <a href="/wiki/Jac_Naylor" id="w">Jac Naylor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Byrne" id="w">Joseph Byrne</a> help her secure a nursing position without having to officially mention her previous employment in <a href="/wiki/Dubai" id="w">Dubai</a>.<sup id="_ref-intothedark_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-intothedark" title="">[18]</a></sup> How the three characters had come to meet and what had occurred between them was not revealed until two months later,<sup id="_ref-dubai_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dubai" title="">[1]</a></sup> and to present, the character very rarely references her own past.</p>
<p>In terms of attitude, the character is generally reluctant to draw attention to herself - worrying about being recognised by <a href="/wiki/Kyla_Tyson" id="w">Kyla Tyson&#39;s</a> policeman husband <a href="/wiki/Minor_characters_in_Holby_City#Relatives 2" id="w">Harvey</a> following her arrest,<sup id="_ref-somethingishouldknow_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-somethingishouldknow" title="">[19]</a></sup> and cooling off her developing relationship with <a href="/wiki/Specialist_registrar" id="w">Cardiothoracic Registrar</a> <a href="/wiki/Sam_Strachan" id="w">Sam Strachan</a> when led to believe he had been gossiping about their tryst.<sup id="_ref-closerelations_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-closerelations" title="">[20]</a></sup> However, she has been seen to be highly principled with regard to her career, and was the only member of nursing staff to refuse to join union action in episode &#34;Countdown&#34;. Her lack of fear in challenging <a href="/wiki/Surgeon" id="w">Staff Surgeon</a> <a href="/wiki/Thandie_Abebe" id="w">Thandie Abebe&#39;s</a> patient care in episode &#34;Leap of Faith&#34;, regardless of negative reaction of her colleagues, led <a href="/wiki/Consultant_(medicine)" id="w">Consultant</a> <a href="/wiki/General_Surgery" id="w">General Surgeon</a> <a href="/wiki/Dan_Clifford" id="w">Dan Clifford</a> to promote her on the spot to the position of <a href="/wiki/Nurse#Nursing titles" id="w">Ward Sister</a>.<sup id="_ref-promotion_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-promotion" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In discussing the character, The <a href="/wiki/Daily_Express" id="w">Daily Express</a> described her as &#34;Gregarious...likes a gossip, but she&#39;s emotionally vulnerable&#34;,<sup id="_ref-express_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-express" title="">[21]</a></sup> while <i>Holby</i> actress <a href="/wiki/Tina_Hobley" id="w">Tina Hobley</a> compared her to her own character, <a href="/wiki/Chrissie_Williams" id="w">Chrissie Williams</a>, explaining that &#34;Faye is a quieter character all round who will do anything for an easy life, whereas Chrissie likes to stir up a bit of drama. I think she sees Faye as a goody two shoes.&#34;<sup id="_ref-express_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-express" title="">[21]</a></sup> A darker side to the character&#39;s personality has also been explored, from her calm reaction to her husband&#39;s death,<sup id="_ref-dubai_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dubai" title="">[1]</a></sup> to her moral ambivalence at stealing a ring left to Jac Naylor in an attempt to win favour with Joseph Byrne.<sup id="_ref-cod_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cod" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Relationships" name="Relationships"></a><h3>Relationships</h3>

<p>Currently, the character&#39;s relationship history prior to arriving in Holby remains largely an enigma. Although the BBC state she has been married three times,<sup id="_ref-character_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-character" title="">[22]</a></sup> only her most recent husband <a href="/wiki/Minor_characters_in_Holby_City#Relatives 2" id="w">James</a> has ever been mentioned on-screen.  While it was never explicitly shown to be so, it was heavily implied in flashback episode &#34;What Lies Beneath&#34; that Faye was responsible for his death.<sup id="_ref-dubai_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dubai" title="">[1]</a></sup> Commenting on this aspect of her character, <a href="/wiki/Patsy_Kensit" id="w">Kensit</a> explained that:
<div style="wigth:150px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:150px-FayeMorton.JPG" title="Sam dates both Faye and Chrissie at the same time"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/150px-FayeMorton.JPG" alt="Sam dates both Faye and Chrissie at the same time" title="Sam dates both Faye and Chrissie at the same time" class="location-left type-thumb" width="150px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Sam dates both Faye and Chrissie at the same time</div></div>
</p>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>Shortly after arriving in Holby, the character began a tentative relationship with <a href="/wiki/Specialist_registrar" id="w">Cardiothoracic Registrar</a> <a href="/wiki/Sam_Strachan" id="w">Sam Strachan</a>. The situation soon escalated into a <a href="/wiki/Love_triangle" id="w">love triangle</a>, with Sam reigniting his former relationship with Faye&#39;s colleague, Matron <a href="/wiki/Chrissie_Williams" id="w">Chrissie Williams</a>.  Kensit said of the relationship in <a href="/wiki/August" id="w">August</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, as the storyline was ongoing: &#34;For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now.  But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there&#39;s a streak of toughness there... It&#39;s all going to get very messy!&#34;<sup id="_ref-totaltv_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-totaltv" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Upon discovering Sam&#39;s infidelity, the character terminated their relationship, and has now most recently been romantically linked with <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Byrne" id="w">Joseph Byrne</a>.  Kensit has confirmed that Faye &#34;has a soft spot for (him)&#34;,<sup id="_ref-castinterview_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-castinterview" title="">[11]</a></sup> although it has been questioned whether she is more interested in him, or the inheritance he recently received following his father&#39;s death.<sup id="_ref-inheritance_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-inheritance" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>In terms of friendships, the character immediately got along well with Acting Sister <a href="/wiki/Kyla_Tyson" id="w">Kyla Tyson</a>, and supported her through the death of her husband and loss of her son to <a href="/wiki/Foster_care" id="w">foster care</a>.<sup id="_ref-trust_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trust" title="">[25]</a></sup> <i>Holby</i> actress <a href="/wiki/Tina_Hobley" id="w">Tina Hobley</a>, who plays character Chrissie Williams, has also commented: &#34;I&#39;d like there to be more development with Chrissie and Faye&#39;s relationship as they&#39;ve only really had Sam as a common interest up until now.  I just hope its friendship that develops, because I can&#39;t bear all that bitchy cat-fighting stuff.&#34;<sup id="_ref-express_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-express" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

Faye arrives in episode &#34;Into the Dark&#34;, requesting that <a href="/wiki/Specialist_registrar" id="w">Registrars</a> <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Byrne" id="w">Joseph Byrne</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jac_Naylor" id="w">Jac Naylor</a>, help her gain employment as a <a href="/wiki/Nursing_in_the_United_Kingdom#Hierarchy .26 roles" id="w">Bank Nurse</a> without having to give details of her most recent employment history. During her first few months at Holby City Hospital, Faye remains close to Joseph, but does not get on well with Jac, who she speaks to sternly about her close relationship with Joseph’s father, <a href="/wiki/Minor_characters_in_Holby_City#Relatives 2" id="w">Lord Byrne</a>.  In episode &#34;What Lies Beneath&#34; , flashbacks occur to the trio’s meeting in <a href="/wiki/Dubai" id="w">Dubai</a>.  Faye’s husband <a href="/wiki/Minor_characters_in_Holby_City#Relatives 2" id="w">James</a> reveals to her that he has lost her life savings of £50,000, ruining her plans of buying a nursing home in England.  The pair fight, and as James forces himself upon her at the top of their staircase, the scene cuts away.  An indefinite period of time later, Faye descends the stairs calmly, and steps over James’s dead body.<sup id="_ref-dubai_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dubai" title="">[1]</a></sup> Although she is questioned by police over James’s death, she is not charged.</p>
<p>Faye worries her colleagues will find out about her arrest when she is recognised by <a href="/wiki/Minor_characters_in_Holby_City#Relatives 2" id="w">Harvey Tyson</a>, the policeman husband of AAU‘s <a href="/wiki/Nursing_in_the_United_Kingdom#Hierarchy .26 roles" id="w">Acting Sister</a> <a href="/wiki/Kyla_Tyson" id="w">Kyla Tyson</a>.<sup id="_ref-somethingishouldknow_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-somethingishouldknow" title="">[19]</a></sup> Faye and Kyla strike up a friendship, and Faye supports Kyla through her <a href="/wiki/Kyla_Tyson#Domestic abuse" id="w">domestic abuse</a> ordeal at the hands of her husband, his subsequent death, and the loss of her son to <a href="/wiki/Foster_care" id="w">foster care</a>.<sup id="_ref-trust_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-trust" title="">[25]</a></sup> Also during this period, Faye resists the advances of hospital lothario <a href="/wiki/Sam_Strachan" id="w">Sam Strachan</a>, and impresses General Surgical Consultant <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Clifford" id="w">Daniel Clifford</a> with her approach to patient care - leading to an on the spot promotion after a clash with <a href="/wiki/Thandie_Abebe" id="w">Thandie Abebe</a> in episode &#34;Leap of Faith&#34;.<sup id="_ref-promotion_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-promotion" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fellow nurse <a href="/wiki/Donna_Jackson" id="w">Donna Jackson</a> aspires to set Faye up with Sam Strachan, and the pair agree to go for a drink. Faye is the only member of nursing staff not to follow union action in episode <i>Countdown</i>, earning her the approval of <a href="/wiki/Connie_Beauchamp" id="w">Connie Beauchamp</a>, the mother of Sam‘s daughter <a href="/wiki/Minor_characters_in_Holby_City#Relatives" id="w">Grace</a>. In episode &#34;Damned If You Do&#34;, Sam surprises Faye with a gift of a diamond necklace, but also begins cheating on her with his old flame, <a href="/wiki/Chrissie_Williams" id="w">Chrissie Williams</a>.  Faye terminates their relationship upon discovering his infidelity, and turns her attention to Joseph, who had tried to warn her about Sam&#39;s indiscretion. She supports Joseph when he is tormented by Jac about the relationship she had had with his father prior to his recent death, and goes as far as to steal back a ring once promised to Joseph, which Jac received in Lord Byrne&#39;s will.  Joseph however is upset by her casual theft, and declines when she later asks him out.<sup id="_ref-cod_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cod" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>On 11th December 2007, Faye was shot in the back with a crossbow by STI Clinician Tim. Tim opened fire in Holby after being ignored and ridiculed about his STI warnings. Martha and Zoe were also shot.</p>
