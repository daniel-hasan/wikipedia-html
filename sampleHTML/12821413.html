<p>&#34;<b><i>Majulah Singapura</i></b>&#34; (&#34;Onward Singapore&#34;) is the <a href="/wiki/National_anthem" id="w">national anthem</a> of <a href="/wiki/Singapore" id="w">Singapore</a>. Composed by <a href="/wiki/Zubir_Said" id="w">Zubir Said</a> in 1958 as a theme song for official functions of the City Council of Singapore, the song was selected in 1959 as the island&#39;s anthem when it <a href="/wiki/Self-governance_of_Singapore" id="w">attained self-government</a>. Upon <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Republic_of_Singapore#Independence of Singapore" id="w">full independence</a> in 1965, &#34;<i>Majulah Singapura</i>&#34; was formally adopted as Singapore&#39;s national anthem. By law the anthem may only be sung with its original <a href="/wiki/Malay_language" id="w">Malay</a> lyrics, although there exist authorized translations of the lyrics of the anthem in Singapore&#39;s three other official languages: <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a>, <a href="/wiki/Standard_Mandarin" id="w">Mandarin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tamil_language" id="w">Tamil</a>.</p>
<p>Originally composed in the <a href="/wiki/Key_(music)" id="w">key</a> of <a href="/wiki/G_major" id="w">G major</a>, in 2001 the national anthem was officially relaunched in the lower key of <a href="/wiki/F_major" id="w">F major</a> as this was said to allow for a &#34;grander and more inspiring arrangement&#34;. </p>
<p>The national anthem is regularly performed or sung in schools and armed forces camps at ceremonies held at the beginning and/or the end of each day, during which the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Singapore" id="w">national flag</a> is also raised and lowered and the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_National_Pledge" id="w">national pledge</a> is taken. Singaporeans are especially encouraged to sing the national anthem on occasions of national celebration or national significance such as at the <a href="/wiki/National_Day_Parade" id="w">National Day Parade</a>, at National Day observance ceremonies conducted by educational institutions and government departments, and at sporting events at which Singapore teams are participating.</p>

<p>The composition of &#34;<i>Majulah Singapura</i>&#34; occurred during a push for independence from the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>. While Singapore was a <a href="/wiki/British_overseas_territories#History" id="w">British colony</a>, its national anthem was &#34;<a href="/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen" id="w">God Save the King (or Queen)</a>&#34;. In 1951, the colony was conferred city status by a <a href="/wiki/Royal_charter" id="w">royal charter</a> from <a href="/wiki/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">King George VI</a>. In 1958, <a href="/wiki/Ong_Pang_Boon" id="w">Ong Pang Boon</a>, the Deputy Mayor of the <a href="/wiki/City_Council_of_Singapore" id="w">City Council of Singapore</a>, approached <a href="/wiki/Zubir_Said" id="w">Zubir Said</a> (1907&#8211;1987), a score arranger and songwriter with <a href="/wiki/Cathay_Organisation#Studios Production" id="w">Cathay-Keris Film Productions</a>, to compose a theme song for the Council&#39;s official functions to be titled &#34;<i>Majulah Singapura</i>&#34; (&#34;Onward Singapore&#34;). This phrase was chosen as it was a motto to be displayed in the <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Theatre_and_Concert_Hall" id="w">Victoria Theatre</a> after its renovation in 1958.<sup id="_ref-a2o_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-a2o" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Zubir took a year to finish composing the music and lyrics for the song. In a 1984 oral history interview, he recalled the process: &#34;[T]he difficulty is in such a short melody, I have to put in all the words... [I]t must be very simple, understandable for all the races in Singapore... I consult also [<i>sic</i>] an author in Malay language so that I can do it in proper Malay language but not too deep and not too difficult.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Summing up his philosophy when composing the anthem, Zubir cited the Malay proverb &#34;<i>Di mana bumi dipijak, di situ langit dijunjung</i>&#34; (&#34;You should hold up the sky of the land where you live&#34;).<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The completed composition was first performed on <a href="/wiki/6_September" id="w">6 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1958" id="w">1958</a> by the Singapore Chamber Ensemble during the grand finale of a concert staged in the Victoria Theatre to celebrate its official reopening.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1959, <a href="/wiki/Self-governance_of_Singapore" id="w">Singapore attained self-government</a> and the City Council was dissolved. The Government felt that a <a href="/wiki/National_anthem" id="w">national anthem</a> was needed to unite the different races in Singapore. The <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore" id="w">Deputy Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Toh_Chin_Chye" id="w">Toh Chin Chye</a> selected the City Council&#39;s song as it was already popular. At Toh&#39;s request, Zubir modified the lyrics and melody,<sup id="_ref-a2o_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-a2o" title="">[1]</a></sup> and the revised song was adopted by the <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore" id="w">Legislative Assembly</a> on <a href="/wiki/11_November" id="w">11 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1959" id="w">1959</a>.

<p>Interviewed by the Oral History Department in 1989, Dr. Toh Chin Chye said it was appropriate for the national anthem to be in Malay, &#34;the indigenous language of the region, as English is not native to this part of the world.&#34; He felt that the &#34;Malay version of the national anthem would appeal to all races... it can be easily understood. And at the same time [it] can be easily remembered... [I]t must be brief, to the point; ... and can be sung&#34;<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> However, on <a href="/wiki/22_July" id="w">22 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a>, the English daily newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/The_Straits_Times" id="w">The Straits Times</a></i> reported that during a meeting between the then Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Goh_Chok_Tong" id="w">Goh Chok Tong</a> and community leaders,<sup id="_ref-ST: Few understand lyrics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ST: Few understand lyrics" title="">[30]</a></sup> a group of <a href="/wiki/Grassroots" id="w">grassroots</a> leaders and a lawyer had suggested that &#34;adjustments&#34; should be made to the national anthem. The given reason was that many Singaporeans could not sing it in Malay and therefore did not have &#34;strong feelings&#34; or &#34;strong emotions when they sing the national anthem&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ST: Raja_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ST: Raja" title="">[31]</a></sup> In particular, some grassroots leaders argued that since the Chinese constitute a majority of the population, a Mandarin version of the anthem should be used.<sup id="_ref-ST: Raja_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ST: Raja" title="">[31]</a></sup> The Prime Minister&#39;s response was that he would keep the national anthem as it was while ensuring that translations in other mother tongues were more easily available.<sup id="_ref-ST: Few understand lyrics_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ST: Few understand lyrics" title="">[30]</a></sup> The proposal to change the lyrics was also criticized by former Deputy Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/S._Rajaratnam" id="w">S. Rajaratnam</a>, who felt that the Malay lyrics of the anthem were so simple that &#34;anyone over the age of five, unless mentally retarded, had no difficulty singing the anthem. All Singaporean children of kindergarten age have not only had no difficulty memorising the words but have for decades sung it every morning with &#39;strong feelings and emotion&#39;.&#34; He also noted that the anthem had been translated into Singapore&#39;s three other official languages (<a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a>, <a href="/wiki/Standard_Mandarin" id="w">Mandarin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tamil_language" id="w">Tamil</a>) for those who cannot understand Malay.<sup id="_ref-ST: Raja_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ST: Raja" title="">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A subsequent poll by <i>The Straits Times</i> found that while many Singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word. However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem should continue to be sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.<sup id="_ref-ST: Few understand lyrics_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ST: Few understand lyrics" title="">[30]</a></sup> </p>

<p>An abridged version of &#34;<i>Majulah Singapura</i>&#34; had been used by official bodies since 1965 although an expanded version, used only at grand ceremonial functions, exists. These versions were arranged by an Englishman, Michael Hurd. This arrangement was first recorded by the <a href="/wiki/Singapore_Symphony_Orchestra" id="w">Singapore Symphony Orchestra</a> under the baton of Lim Yau in 1989.<sup id="_ref-Singapore Infopedia_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Singapore Infopedia" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The original version of the national anthem was in the key of <a href="/wiki/G_major" id="w">G major</a>, although in 1983 schools were issued an educational tape describing common mistakes made in singing the anthem and given the option of singing the anthem in <a href="/wiki/F_major" id="w">F major</a>.<sup id="_ref-Singapore Infopedia_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Singapore Infopedia" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> In 1993, the shorter version of &#34;<i>Majulah Singapura</i>&#34; was declared to be the official one.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/19_January" id="w">19 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>, &#34;<i>Majulah Singapura</i>&#34; was officially relaunched in the F-major key, as this was said to be a &#34;grander and more inspiring arrangement&#34;<sup id="_ref-Singapore Infomap_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Singapore Infomap" title="">[35]</a></sup> of the anthem. The Ministry of Information and the Arts (MITA, now the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Information%2C_Communications_and_the_Arts" id="w">Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts</a> (MICA)) took more than a year to produce the new version. Its main objective was to make the anthem more accessible to all Singaporeans. In May 2000, several leading local composers were invited to rearrange the national anthem in F major. An evaluation panel headed by <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Tan" id="w">Bernard Tan</a> selected the version submitted by <a href="/wiki/Cultural_Medallion" id="w">Cultural Medallion</a> winner Phoon Yew Tien.
