The <b>lion</b> (<i>Panthera leo</i>) is a member of the family <a href="/wiki/Felidae" id="w">Felidae</a> and one of four &#34;<a href="/wiki/Big_cat" id="w">big cats</a>&#34; in the <a href="/wiki/Genus" id="w">genus</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Panthera" id="w">Panthera</a></i>. Reaching 272&#160;<a href="/wiki/Kilogram" id="w">kg</a> (600&#160;<a href="/wiki/Pound_(mass)" id="w">lb</a>), it is the second-largest cat after the <a href="/wiki/Tiger" id="w">tiger</a>. They currently exist in the wild in <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" id="w">sub-Saharan Africa</a> and in <a href="/wiki/Asia" id="w">Asia</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Critically_endangered" id="w">critically endangered</a> remnant population in northwest <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>, having disappeared from <a href="/wiki/North_Africa" id="w">North Africa</a>, the Middle East and western Asia in historic times. Until the late <a href="/wiki/Pleistocene" id="w">Pleistocene</a> (about 10,000 years ago), the lion was the most widespread large land mammal beside man. They were found in most of Africa, much of Eurasia from western Europe to India and the <a href="/wiki/Bering_land_bridge" id="w">Bering land bridge</a> and in the Americas from <a href="/wiki/Yukon" id="w">Yukon</a> to Peru.</p>
<p>Lions live for approximately 10&#8211;14&#160;years in the wild, while in captivity they can live over 20&#160;years. They typically inhabit <a href="/wiki/Savanna" id="w">savanna</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grassland" id="w">grassland</a>, although they may take to bush and <a href="/wiki/Forest" id="w">forest</a>. Lions are unusually <a href="/wiki/Social_animal" id="w">social</a> compared to other cats. A lion <i>pride</i> consists of related females and offspring and a small number of dominant males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large <a href="/wiki/Ungulate" id="w">ungulates</a>. The lion is an <a href="/wiki/Apex_predator" id="w">apex</a> and <a href="/wiki/Keystone_predator" id="w">keystone predator</a>, though will resort to scavenging if the opportunity arises. While lions, in general, do not selectively hunt humans, some have been known to become man-eaters and seek human prey.</p>
<p>The lion is a <a href="/wiki/Vulnerable_species" id="w">vulnerable species</a>, having seen a possibly irreversible population decline of 30 to 50% over the past two decades in its African range;<sup id="_ref-IUCN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IUCN" title="">[1]</a></sup> populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not well-understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Lions have been kept in <a href="/wiki/Menagerie" id="w">menageries</a> since <a href="/wiki/Roman_era" id="w">Roman times</a> and have been a key species sought after and exhibited in <a href="/wiki/Zoo" id="w">zoos</a> the world over since the late 18th century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered <a href="/wiki/Asiatic_Lion" id="w">Asiatic subspecies</a>.</p>
<p>The male lion is highly distinctive and is easily recognized by its <a href="/wiki/Mane" id="w">mane</a>. The lion, particularly the face of the male, is one of the most widely recognized animal symbols in human <a href="/wiki/Culture" id="w">culture</a>. Depictions have existed from the <a href="/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic" id="w">Upper Paleolithic</a> period, with carvings and paintings from the <a href="/wiki/Lascaux" id="w">Lascaux</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chauvet_Cave" id="w">Chauvet Caves</a>, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they historically occurred. It has been extensively depicted in literature, in <a href="/wiki/Sculpture" id="w">sculptures</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Painting" id="w">paintings</a>, on national <a href="/wiki/Flag" id="w">flags</a>, and in contemporary <a href="/wiki/Film" id="w">films</a> and <a href="/wiki/Literature" id="w">literature</a>.</p>
<a id="Naming_and_etymology" name="Naming_and_etymology"></a><h2>Naming and etymology</h2>
<p>The lion&#39;s name, similar in many languages, derives from the <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> <i>leo</i>,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> and before that the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" id="w">Ancient Greek</a> <i>leōn</i>/λεων.<sup id="_ref-Liddell 1980_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Liddell 1980" title="">[3]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Hebrew" id="w">Hebrew</a> word <i>lavi</i> (לָבִיא) may also be related,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> as well as the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian" id="w">Ancient Egyptian</a> <i>rw</i>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> It was one of the many species originally described, as <i>Felis leo</i>, by <a href="/wiki/Carolus_Linnaeus" id="w">Linnaeus</a> in his 18th&#160;century work, <i><a href="/wiki/Systema_Naturae" id="w">Systema Naturae</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> The generic component of its scientific designation, <i>Panthera leo</i>, is often presumed to derive from Greek <i>pan-</i> (&#34;all&#34;) and <i>ther</i> (&#34;beast&#34;), but this may be a <a href="/wiki/Folk_etymology" id="w">folk etymology</a>.

The oldest lion-like <a href="/wiki/Fossil" id="w">fossil</a> is known from <a href="/wiki/Laetoli" id="w">Laetoli</a> in <a href="/wiki/Tanzania" id="w">Tanzania</a> and is perhaps 3.5&#160;million years old; some scientists have identified the material as <i>Panthera leo</i>. These records are not well-substantiated, and all that can be said is that they pertain to a <i>Panthera</i>-like felid. The oldest confirmed records of <i>Panthera leo</i> in Africa are about 2&#160;million years younger.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>
The closest relatives of the lion are the other <i><a href="/wiki/Panthera" id="w">Panthera</a></i> species: the <a href="/wiki/Tiger" id="w">tiger</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Jaguar" id="w">jaguar</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Leopard" id="w">leopard</a>. Morphological and genetic studies reveal that the tiger was the first of these recent species to diverge. About 1.9&#160;million years ago the Jaguar branched off the remaining group, which contained ancestors of the leopard and lion. The Lion and leopard subsequently separated about 1 to 1.25&#160;million years ago from each other.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

Traditionally 12 recent subspecies of lion were recognized, the largest of which has been recognised as the <a href="/wiki/Barbary_Lion" id="w">Barbary Lion</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The major differences between these subspecies are location, mane appearance, size and distribution. Because these characteristics are very insignificant and show a high individual variability, most of these forms were debatable and probably invalid; additionally, they were often based upon zoo material of unknown origin that may have had &#34;striking, but abnormal&#34; morphological characteristics.<sup id="_ref-zoos_encyclopedia_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-zoos_encyclopedia" title="">[15]</a></sup> Today only eight subspecies are usually accepted,<sup id="_ref-Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny" title="">[12]</a></sup> but one of these, the Cape lion formerly described as <i>Panthera leo melanochaita</i> is probably invalid.<sup id="_ref-Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Conservation-Genetics:Preserving-Genetic-Diversity" title="">[16]</a></sup>
Even the remaining seven subspecies might be too much; <a href="/wiki/Mitochondria" id="w">mitochondrial</a> variation in recent African lions is modest, which suggests that all sub-Saharan lions could be considered a single subspecies, possibly divided in two main clades: one to the west of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Rift_Valley" id="w">Great Rift Valley</a> and the other to the east. Lions from <a href="/wiki/Tsavo" id="w">Tsavo</a> in Eastern Kenya are much closer genetically to lions in <a href="/wiki/Transvaal" id="w">Transvaal</a> (South Africa), than to those in the <a href="/wiki/Aberdare_Range" id="w">Aberdare Range</a> in Western Kenya.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Recent" name="Recent"></a><h4>Recent</h4>
<p>Eight recent subspecies are recognized today:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>P. l. persica</i></b>, known as the <b><a href="/wiki/Asiatic_lion" id="w">Asiatic-</a></b> or <b>South Asian, Persian or Indian lion</b>, was once widespread from <a href="/wiki/Turkey" id="w">Turkey</a>, across the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" id="w">Middle East</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> and even <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh" id="w">Bangladesh</a>.

<li><b><i>P. l. leo</i></b>, known as the <b><a href="/wiki/Barbary_lion" id="w">Barbary lion</a></b>, is extinct in the wild due to excessive hunting, although captive individuals may still exist. This was the largest of the lion subspecies, at 3–3.5m approx., and weighing over 150 kilograms and more. They ranged from Morocco to Egypt. The last wild Barbary lion was killed in Morocco in 1922.<sup id="_ref-CAP_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CAP" title="">[20]</a></sup></li>
<li><b><i>P. l. senegalensis</i></b>, known as the <b>West African lion</b>, is found in Western Africa, from Senegal to Nigeria.</li>
<li><b><i>P. l. azandica</i></b>, known as the <b>North East Congo lion</b>, is found in the Northeastern parts of the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" id="w">Congo</a>.</li>
<li><b><i>P. l. nubica</i></b>, known as the <b>East African-</b> or <b>Massai lion</b>, is found in East Africa, from <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" id="w">Ethiopia</a> and Kenya to <a href="/wiki/Tanzania" id="w">Tanzania</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mozambique" id="w">Mozambique</a>.</li>
<li><b><i>P. l. bleyenberghi</i></b>, known as the <b>Southwest African-</b> or <b>Katanga lion</b>.

The mane of the male lion, unique amongst cats, is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the species.

Darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year.<sup id="_ref-West_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-West" title="">[34]</a></sup> In prides led by a coalition of two or three males, it is possible that lionesses solicit mating more actively with heavily maned lions.<sup id="_ref-Trivedi02_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Trivedi02" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Scientists once believed that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by <a href="/wiki/Morphology_(biology)" id="w">morphology</a>, including the size of the mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the <a href="/wiki/Barbary_lion" id="w">Barbary lion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cape_Lion" id="w">Cape Lion</a>.

Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey, cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt; this is especially true with larger species. Teamwork also enables them to defend their prey more easily against other large predators such as hyenas, which may be attracted by <a href="/wiki/Vulture" id="w">vultures</a> over kilometers in open savannas. Lionesses do most of the hunting. Males attached to prides do not usually participate, except when hunting large animals such as buffalo and giraffe. In typical hunts, each lioness has a favored position in the group, either stalking prey on the &#34;wing&#34; then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> Young lions first display stalking behaviour around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old.

Lionesses in a pride will synchronize their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young, who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. Cubs usually are born and initially kept hidden from view in thickets or sheltered areas. They weigh 1.2&#8211;2.1&#160;kg at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.<sup id="_ref-Schaller143_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller143" title="">[66]</a></sup> Weaning occurs after six to seven months. In the wild, competition for food is fierce, and as many as 80% of the cubs will die before the age of two.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>When one or more new males oust the previous male(s) associated with a pride, the conqueror(s) often kill any remaining cubs, <sup id="_ref-Packpus83_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Packpus83" title="">[68]</a></sup> perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs grow up or die. The male lions reach maturity at about 3&#160;years of age and are capable of taking over another pride at 4–5&#160;years old. They begin to age and weaken between 10 and 15&#160;years of age at the latest.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> This leaves a short window for their own offspring to be born and mature—the fathers have to procreate as soon as they take over a pride. A lioness often will attempt to defend her cubs fiercely from a usurping male, but such actions are rarely successful. He usually kills all of the previous cubs (that are less than two years old). The lioness is much lighter and has less strength than the male, however, success is more likely when a group of three or four mothers within the pride join forces against one male.<sup id="_ref-Packpus83_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Packpus83" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>

<p>The second organizational behaviour is labeled, <i>nomads</i>, who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs.<sup id="_ref-Schaller33_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller33" title="">[79]</a></sup> Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Males have to go through this lifestyle and some never are able to join another pride. A female who becomes a nomad has much greater difficulty joining a new pride, as the females in a pride are related and reject most attempts by an unrelated female to join their family group. </p>
<p>The area a pride occupies is called a <i>pride area</i>, whereas that by a nomad is a <i>range</i>.<sup id="_ref-Schaller33_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller33" title="">[79]</a></sup> The males associated with a pride tend to stay on the finges, patroling their territory. Why <a href="/wiki/Social_behavior" id="w">sociality</a>—the most pronounced in any cat species—has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation, but also ensures that non-hunting &#34;cheaters&#34; reduce per capita caloric intake. Other benefits include possible <a href="/wiki/Kin_selection" id="w">kin selection</a> (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.<sup id="_ref-CAP_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CAP" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

Lionesses do the hunting for their pride. Lionesses hunt as a co-ordinated group and are smaller, swifter, and more agile than males. They are not encumberd by the heavy and conspicuous mane which causes overheating during exerction. There is no clear hierarchy with food except the females are likely to share with each other first and allow cubs and males to eat if the kill is large enough; males will take some of this food from cubs, but are more likely to share alongside the cubs than the lionesses. Male lions will never share food they have killed by themselves. Smaller prey is eaten at the location of the hunt, thereby being shared among the hunters, when the kill is larger it often is dragged to the pride area. There is more sharing with larger kills.<sup id="_ref-Schaller133_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller133" title="">[80]</a></sup></p> 
<p>Both males and females defend the pride against intruders. Some individual lions consistently lead the defense against intruders, while others lag behind.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> These &#34;laggards&#34; are not punished by leaders. Possibly laggards provide other services to the group so that leaders forgive them.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup> An alternative hypothesis is that there is some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> The leading male or males often have to defend against outside males attempting to take over the pride. Females form a stable social unit in a pride and will not tolerate outside females; <sup id="_ref-Schaller37_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller37" title="">[84]</a></sup> membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses,<sup id="_ref-Schaller39_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller39" title="">[85]</a></sup> though some females do leave and become nomadic.<sup id="_ref-Schaller44_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller44" title="">[86]</a></sup> Subadult males on the other hand, leave the pride when they reach maturity at around 2–3 years of age.<sup id="_ref-Schaller44_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller44" title="">[86]</a></sup></p>

When resting, lion socialization occurs through a number of behaviors, and the animal&#39;s expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking,<sup id="_ref-Schaller85_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller85" title="">[87]</a></sup> which have been compared with grooming in primates.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup> Head rubbing—nuzzling one&#39;s forehead, face and neck against another lion—appears to be a form of greeting,<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup> as it is seen often after an animal has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females.<sup id="_ref-Schaller858_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller858" title="">[90]</a></sup> Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked, which may have arisen out of utility, as a lion cannot lick these areas individually.<sup id="_ref-Schaller8891_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller8891" title="">[91]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures.<sup id="_ref-Schaller92102_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller92102" title="">[92]</a></sup> Their repertoire of vocalizations is also large; variations in intensity and pitch, rather than discrete signals, appear central to communication. Lion sounds include snarling, purring, hissing, coughing, miaowing, woofing and roaring. Lions most often roar at night; the sound, which can be heard from a distance of 8 km, is used to advertise the animal&#39;s presence.<sup id="_ref-Schaller10313_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Schaller10313" title="">[93]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Interspecific_predatory_relationships" name="Interspecific_predatory_relationships"></a><h3>Interspecific predatory relationships</h3>

<p>The relationship between lions and <a href="/wiki/Spotted_hyena" id="w">spotted hyenas</a> in areas where they coexist is unique in its complexity and intensity. Lions and spotted hyenas are both <a href="/wiki/Apex_predator" id="w">apex predators</a> which feed on the same prey, and are therefore in direct competition with one other. As such, they will often fight over and steal each others&#39; kills. Though hyenas are popularly assumed to be opportunistic scavengers profiting from the lion&#39;s hunting abilities, it is quite often the case that the reverse is true. In Tanzania&#39;s Ngorongoro Crater, the spotted hyena population greatly exceeds that of the resident lions, which obtain a large proportion of their food by stealing hyena prey. The feud between the two species does however encompass more than just battles over food. In animals, it is usually the case that territorial boundaries of another species are disregarded. Hyenas and lions are an exception to this, seeing as they set boundaries against each other as they would against members of their same species. Male lions in particular are extremely aggressive toward hyenas, and have been observed to hunt and kill hyenas without eating them. Conversely, hyenas are major predators of lion cubs, and will harass lionesses over kills.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup></p>

The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favored by all researchers.

Frump believes thousands may have been killed in the decades after <a href="/wiki/Apartheid" id="w">apartheid</a> sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night.

<p>A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004.

Seraglios served as expressions of the nobility&#39;s power and wealth. Animals like big cats and <a href="/wiki/Elephant" id="w">elephants</a>, in particular, symbolized power, and would be pitted in fights against each other or domesticated animals. By extension, menageries and seraglios served as demonstrations of the dominance of man over nature. Consequently, the defeat of such natural &#34;lords&#34; by a cow in 1682 astonished the spectators, and the flight of an elephant before a rhinoceros drew jeers. Such fights would slowly fade out in the 17th century with the spread of the menagerie and their appropriation by the commoners. The tradition of keeping big cats as pets would last into the 19th century, at which time it was seen as highly eccentric.<sup id="_ref-132" class="reference"><a href="#_note-132" title="">[132]</a></sup></p>

After the birth of the <a href="/wiki/Khalsa" id="w">Khalsa</a> brotherhood in 1699, the <a href="/wiki/Sikh" id="w">Sikhs</a> also adopted the name &#34;Singh&#34; due to the wishes of <a href="/wiki/Guru_Gobind_Singh" id="w">Guru Gobind Singh</a>. Along with millions of Hindu Rajputs today, it is also used by over 20 million <a href="/wiki/Sikhs" id="w">Sikhs</a> worldwide.<sup id="_ref-156" class="reference"><a href="#_note-156" title="">[156]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-157" class="reference"><a href="#_note-157" title="">[157]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Asiatic Lion is a common motif in <a href="/wiki/Chinese_art" id="w">Chinese art</a>.

Because lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Buddhist_art" id="w">Buddhist art</a> to China in the <a href="/wiki/Tang_Dynasty" id="w">Tang Dynasty</a> (after the 6th century AD), lions were usually depicted without wings, their bodies became thicker and shorter, and their manes became curly.<sup id="_ref-161" class="reference"><a href="#_note-161" title="">[161]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Lion_dance" id="w">lion dance</a> is a form of traditional dance in <a href="/wiki/Chinese_culture" id="w">Chinese culture</a> in which performers mimic a lion&#39;s movements in a lion costume, often with musical accompaniment from cymbals, drums and gongs.
