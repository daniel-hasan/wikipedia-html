The <b>New England Patriots</b>, commonly called the &#34;<b>Pats</b>&#34; by sports writers and fans,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> are a professional <a href="/wiki/American_football" id="w">American football</a> team based in <a href="/wiki/Foxborough%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Foxborough</a>, <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Massachusetts</a>. The team is part of the <a href="/wiki/AFC_East" id="w">Eastern Division</a> of the <a href="/wiki/American_Football_Conference" id="w">American Football Conference</a> (AFC) in the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" id="w">National Football League</a> (NFL). The owners changed the name from the original <b>Boston Patriots</b> after <a href="/wiki/Relocation_of_professional_sports_teams" id="w">relocating the team</a> to Foxborough in 1971.</p>
<p>An original member of the <a href="/wiki/American_Football_League" id="w">American Football League</a> (AFL), the Patriots joined the NFL in the <a href="/wiki/AFL-NFL_Merger" id="w">1970 merger</a> of those leagues. The team advanced to the playoffs four times before appearing in <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XX" id="w">Super Bowl XX</a> in January 1986, losing to the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Bears" id="w">Chicago Bears</a>. The team also appeared in <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXI" id="w">Super Bowl XXXI</a> in 1997, losing to the <a href="/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers" id="w">Green Bay Packers</a>. </p>
<p>Between 2001 and 2005, the Patriots became the second team in NFL history (after the <a href="/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys" id="w">Dallas Cowboys</a>) to win three Super Bowls in four years (<a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVI" id="w">Super Bowl XXXVI</a>, <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII" id="w">XXXVIII</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXIX" id="w">XXXIX</a>), and the eighth to win consecutive Super Bowls.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_16" id="w">November 16</a> <a href="/wiki/1959" id="w">1959</a>, Boston business executive <a href="/wiki/Billy_Sullivan_(American_football)" id="w">Billy Sullivan</a> was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing American Football League (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team&#39;s official name. The most popular choice—and the one that Sullivan selected—was <b>&#34;Boston Patriots&#34;</b>.  Immediately thereafter, Phil Bisell developed the &#34;Pat Patriot&#34; logo (see <a href="/wiki/Logos_and_Uniforms_of_the_New_England_Patriots" id="w">Logos and Uniforms of the New England Patriots</a>).  </p>
<p>Training camp started on <a href="/wiki/July_4" id="w">July 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1960_Boston_Patriots_season" id="w">1960</a>, two months prior to the franchise&#39;s first game.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/September_9" id="w">September 9</a>, 1960, the Boston Patriots played the <a href="/wiki/Denver_Broncos" id="w">Denver Broncos</a> in the first-ever AFL regular season game. The Patriots were defeated by a score of 13–10. The Patriots missed the AFL playoffs for their first three seasons. However, in <a href="/wiki/1963_Boston_Patriots_season" id="w">1963</a> the Patriots reached the <a href="/wiki/AFL_Championship" id="w">AFL Championship</a> for the first time; they lost to the <a href="/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers" id="w">San Diego Chargers</a> 51–10.

<p>The Patriots&#39; second decade began with significant changes. In <a href="/wiki/1970_Boston_Patriots_season" id="w">1970</a>, the Patriots&#39; franchise joined the NFL pursuant to the merger of the AFL and NFL that had been agreed to three years earlier. The Patriots were merged into the American Football Conference (AFC), where they remain to the present day. However, the Patriots&#39; first season as part of the NFL resulted in a record of 2–12, giving them sole possession of the newly merged league&#39;s worst record. The team lacked stability and was forced to play at four different sites. Finally, the Patriots moved into a new stadium in <a href="/wiki/Foxborough%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Foxborough</a> (also known as Foxboro). The stadium, initially named <a href="/wiki/Schaefer_Stadium" id="w">Schaefer Stadium</a>, became Sullivan Stadium in <a href="/wiki/1983_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1983</a> and ultimately <a href="/wiki/Foxboro_Stadium" id="w">Foxboro Stadium</a> in <a href="/wiki/1990_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1990</a>. </p>
<p>In February, <a href="/wiki/1971_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1971</a>, the team was renamed the Bay State Patriots.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> After press, fan, and public relations backlash against the prospect of the team becoming known as the &#34;B.S. Patriots&#34;, the franchise renamed the team the New England Patriots in March, 1971 to reflect the relocation out of Boston and desire to gain regional following.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the early 1970s, several new players were added to the lineup, including <a href="/wiki/Heisman_Trophy" id="w">Heisman Trophy</a><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> winner <a href="/wiki/Jim_Plunkett" id="w">Jim Plunkett</a><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>; <a href="/wiki/University_of_Southern_California" id="w">USC</a> <a href="/wiki/All-American" id="w">All-American</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rose_Bowl_(game)" id="w">Rose Bowl</a> touchdown record holder<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Sam_Cunningham" id="w">Sam &#34;Bam&#34; Cunningham</a>, and offensive lineman <a href="/wiki/John_Hannah_(NFL_player)" id="w">John Hannah</a>, who became the first career Patriot to be elected to the NFL Hall of Fame in <a href="/wiki/1991_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1991</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  Despite the addition of these popular players, the Patriots&#39; series of losing seasons continued into the early 1970s, during which time the Patriots were often derisively called &#34;The Patsies&#34; by the local fans and press.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Chuck_Fairbanks" id="w">Chuck Fairbanks</a> was hired as head coach and <a href="/wiki/General_manager" id="w">general manager</a> in <a href="/wiki/1973_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1973</a> after leading a top-ten program at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma" id="w">University of Oklahoma</a>.

Paterno, however, backed out of the deal and remained at Penn State<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Under Fairbanks, the Patriots finished 7–7 in <a href="/wiki/1974_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1974</a> and 3–11 in <a href="/wiki/1975_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1975</a>, which resulted in changes to the offense.

<a id="1976-1984" name="1976-1984"></a><h2>1976-1984</h2>
<p>After the string of losing seasons, the Patriots finished the <a href="/wiki/1976_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1976 season</a> with an 11–3 mark &#8212; the best record in team history to that point &#8212; and a playoff slot for the first time since 1963. In the first round of the <a href="/wiki/NFL_playoffs%2C_1976-77" id="w">1976 playoffs</a>, the Patriots lost to the <a href="/wiki/Oakland_Raiders" id="w">Oakland Raiders</a> 24–21. In <a href="/wiki/1978_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1978</a>, Fairbanks was fired as head coach when it was revealed that he had been secretly hired as the new head coach of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder" id="w">University of Colorado</a>.

<a id="1985-1992" name="1985-1992"></a><h2>1985-1992</h2>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/1985_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1985 regular season</a>, the team finished with an 11-5 record and obtained a <a href="/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)" id="w">wild-card</a> playoff berth. The Patriots won three road <a href="/wiki/NFL_playoffs%2C_1985-86" id="w">playoff games</a> on their way to <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XX" id="w">Super Bowl XX</a> &#8212; an NFL record.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> At Super Bowl XX, the Patriots surrendered a 3-0 first quarter lead and lost to the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Bears" id="w">Chicago Bears</a> by a score of 46-10. The following season, New England won the <a href="/wiki/AFC_East" id="w">AFC East</a> with another 11–5 record, but fell to the Broncos in the first round of the playoffs. Local resident <a href="/wiki/Doug_Flutie" id="w">Doug Flutie</a> was a member of the Patriots during the <a href="/wiki/1987_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1987</a> and <a href="/wiki/1988_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1988</a> seasons, in which they finished with records of 8–7 and 9–7, respectively. Berry remained head coach through both seasons.</p>
<p>During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Patriots&#39; lack of playoff appearances was underscored by personnel changes and controversy within the Sullivan ownership.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> The Sullivan family lost millions of dollars on investments, including <a href="/wiki/The_Jacksons" id="w">The Jacksons</a>&#39; 1984 Victory tour.  These financial losses and demands forced the Sullivans to sell the team.  In 1986, Francis W. Murray arranged financing to keep the team afloat, and in return was granted an option to purchase the team.  When Murray tried to exercise his option, the Sullivans refused to acknowledge his rights and Murray sued and won in court.  As a result, Murray agreed to partner with <a href="/wiki/Victor_Kiam" id="w">Victor Kiam</a> to purchase the team in 1988. Kiam and Murray purchased the team for $84 million &#8212; $16 million less than Sullivan claimed to have invested in the team.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Although Kiam was now the majority owner, he decided to keep Billy Sullivan and his son, Pat Sullivan, as franchise president and general manager respectively.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Meanwhile, paper and packaging magnate <a href="/wiki/Robert_Kraft" id="w">Robert Kraft</a>, a Patriots season-ticket holder since 1972, moved strategically to gain ownership of decrepit Sullivan Stadium (formerly Schaefer Stadium) after a business analysis showed that he could not yet afford to bid on the team, but that the team could not be a financial success without the stadium revenues.  He set in motion a long-term strategy to one day become the owner of the Patriots.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Kraft closed on the stadium purchase on <a href="/wiki/November_23" id="w">November 23</a>, 1988. Essentially, Kraft owned the stadium and Kiam owned the team.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> During this leadership change, head coach Berry was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Rod_Rust" id="w">Rod Rust</a> &#8212; a change that was short-lived.  </p>
<p>The Patriots&#39; worst season in franchise history &#8212; a 1-15 record &#8212; came under Rust in 1990. During the season, the Patriots were thrown into the middle of a sexual harassment scandal when <i><a href="/wiki/Boston_Herald" id="w">Boston Herald</a></i> reporter <a href="/wiki/Lisa_Olson" id="w">Lisa Olson</a> was sexually and verbally assaulted by several Patriots players in the team&#39;s locker room and was later labeled a &#34;classic bitch&#34; by Kiam. Following an investigation into the scandal, NFL Commissioner <a href="/wiki/Paul_Tagliabue" id="w">Paul Tagliabue</a> fined the team $50,000, and players <a href="/wiki/Zeke_Mowatt" id="w">Zeke Mowatt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Timpson" id="w">Michael Timpson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Perryman" id="w">Robert Perryman</a> $12,500, $5,000, and $5,000 respectively. Rust was fired and replaced by <a href="/wiki/Dick_MacPherson" id="w">Dick MacPherson</a> at the end of the season. The Olson scandal and the 1-15 record are cited as the two primary reasons why Rod Rust was told to leave.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1992_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1992</a>, <a href="/wiki/St._Louis%2C_Missouri" id="w">St. Louis</a> businessman <a href="/wiki/James_Orthwein" id="w">James Orthwein</a> became sole owner of the Patriots franchise, sparking rumors of a possible relocation of the team to St. Louis. However, no move was scheduled for the 1992 season, despite a 2-14 record.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>  </p>
<a id="1992-1997" name="1992-1997"></a><h2>1992-1997</h2>
<p>During the 1992–1993 offseason, the Patriots shifted gears by replacing MacPherson with <a href="/wiki/Bill_Parcells" id="w">Bill Parcells</a>. The team&#39;s draft selections during the offseason included top overall pick <a href="/wiki/Drew_Bledsoe" id="w">Drew Bledsoe</a>, who was <a href="/wiki/Quarterback" id="w">quarterback</a> of the team until <a href="/wiki/2001_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">2001</a>, and wide receiver <a href="/wiki/Troy_Brown" id="w">Troy Brown</a> who last season became the team record holder for most receptions.  Troy Brown would also play as a defensive back in the Belichick era, scoring touchdowns both on interceptions and as a receiver. Despite these acquisitions, the <a href="/wiki/1993_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1993 season</a> resulted in 5-11 record as Parcells began rebuilding, and rumors about relocating to St. Louis rekindled during the offseason. However, before he could move the team to St. Louis, Orthwein had to get out of the lease on Foxboro Stadium, owned by Robert Kraft. When Orthwein offered Kraft $75 million to buy out the remaining years on the lease, Kraft turned it down<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>, forcing Orthwein to put the franchise up for sale. </p>
<p>Using the stadium lease as leverage, Kraft was able to buy the Patriots in <a href="/wiki/1994_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">January of 1994</a>, paying a record (at the time) $200 million for the team.  More importantly, in the view of the region&#39;s media, he immediately announced that the team would stay in New England<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup>.  </p>
<p>Kraft made a commitment to Patriots fans that he would bring a Super Bowl and a state of the art facility for the team to New England.  On the day the NFL approved his purchase, the fans responded by buying almost 6,000 season tickets en route to selling out every game for the first time in the team&#39;s 34-year history. Every home game has been sold out since.</p>
<p>Despite the marketing successes, the relationship between Kraft and Parcells was strained.  It got worse with time as new owners with their net worth on the line were unwilling to give carte blanche to Parcells&#39; spending on the football side. The Krafts believed in giving management plenty of space, but not carte blanche without questions and answers. Parcells felt Kraft was interfering with his prerogatives and with what was needed to run a successful winning football franchise, especially in light of the new <a href="/wiki/NFL_salary_cap" id="w">NFL salary cap</a> which took effect in 1994. The result was a management stalemate with declining good will that eventually led to <a href="/wiki/Bill_Belichick" id="w">Bill Belichick</a>, the newly hired Assistant Head Coach, having to mediate between the two during the 1996 season.  The management conflict also led to the distracting and disruptive rumors that Parcells was leaving the franchise; rumors that dominated the news prior to the team&#39;s participation in <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXI" id="w">Super Bowl XXXI</a> (as double-digit under dogs), despite the fact that Parcells was under contract through the 1997 season. At one point prior to the AFC title game against the <a href="/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars" id="w">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>, Boston Globe columnist <a href="/wiki/Will_McDonough" id="w">Will McDonough</a>, who had excellent relationships with both the Krafts and Parcells, actually maneuvered the two into a meeting to settle their differences (January 12th, 1997&#8212;the morning of the AFC Championship game<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup>). Team president <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Kraft" id="w">Jonathan Kraft</a> is quoted by writer Michael Holley in <i><a href="/wiki/Patriot_Reign" id="w">Patriot Reign</a></i> as saying <i>&#34;It was a very, very strange time, and when you are not an expert at this business&#8212;you know we were still very new to the business&#8212;it can be educational. Big Bill had kept us in the dark on a lot of things. He probably misled us on some things. And we didn&#39;t know how to go about questioning it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></i></p>
<p>New England entered the 1994 season after drafting defensive end <a href="/wiki/Willie_McGinest" id="w">Willie McGinest</a>, the first round and fourth overall pick, who would later play <a href="/wiki/Linebacker" id="w">linebacker</a> on all three Super Bowl-winning teams.  The 1994 club struggled to 3-6 but rallied to defeat the <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings" id="w">Minnesota Vikings</a> in overtime and finished the season with a record of 10-6.  Although the team lost in the first round of the <a href="/wiki/NFL_playoffs%2C_1994-95" id="w">playoffs</a> and finished the <a href="/wiki/1995_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1995 season</a> with a 6–10 record, Kraft decided to keep Parcells; however, Parcells was forced to give up control of player personnel, creating a divided structure Belichick would later put an end to&#8212;but not until 2001.  In 1996, the Patriots finished with an 11–5 record and won the AFC East division championship, advancing to <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXI" id="w">Super Bowl XXXI</a>, where they were double-digit underdogs and lost to the <a href="/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers" id="w">Green Bay Packers</a> 35–21.</p>
<a id="1997-1999" name="1997-1999"></a><h2>1997-1999</h2>
<p>Due to rising tensions between Parcells and Kraft, Parcells resigned and was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Pete_Carroll" id="w">Pete Carroll</a> in <a href="/wiki/1997_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1997</a>. Meanwhile, the Patriots and the New York Jets began switching players and coaches, including Parcells and running back <a href="/wiki/Curtis_Martin" id="w">Curtis Martin</a>. Nevertheless, New England finished with a 10–6 record and took first place in the AFC East. The Patriots defeated the Miami Dolphins 17–3 at home in the opening round of the playoffs before losing against the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 7–6. In the <a href="/wiki/1998_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1998 season</a>, the Patriots finished 9–7 and lost to the <a href="/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars" id="w">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> in the first round of the playoffs. A subpar <a href="/wiki/1999_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">1999 season</a> followed in which the Patriots jumped to a 6-2 record but collapsed after their <a href="/wiki/Bye_week" id="w">bye week</a> to finish 8-8.  The second half of the season resulted in Carroll&#39;s firing.</p>
<a id="2000-present" name="2000-present"></a><h2>2000-present</h2>
<p>After Carroll was fired, <a href="/wiki/Bill_Belichick" id="w">Bill Belichick</a>, hand-picked to be Parcells&#39; successor with the Jets, quit after one day as Jets head coach to join New England.  Belichick&#39;s first season in <a href="/wiki/2000_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">2000</a> resulted in a 5–11 record. In 2001, quarterback Drew Bledsoe was injured in the second game of the season and was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Brady" id="w">Tom Brady</a>, a sixth-round draft pick, who then led the team into the playoffs with an 11–5 record. The Patriots defeated the Oakland Raiders in the so-called <a href="/wiki/The_Tuck_(NFL_game)" id="w">&#34;The Tuck&#34; game</a> played in a driving snowstorm in Foxborough (it was also notable for being the final game in <a href="/wiki/Foxboro_Stadium" id="w">Foxboro Stadium</a>), followed by defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in the <a href="/wiki/NFL_playoffs%2C_2004-05" id="w">AFC Championship Game</a>.

In 2002, Robert Kraft opened the new <a href="/wiki/Gillette_Stadium" id="w">Gillette Stadium</a> after privately funding its construction. Initially getting no support from the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a> to build a new stadium, Kraft made a deal to move the team to <a href="/wiki/Hartford%2C_Connecticut" id="w">Hartford</a>, <a href="/wiki/Connecticut" id="w">Connecticut</a> in 1998.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> However, environmental cleanup problems with the Hartford site, combined with Massachusetts&#39; eventual willingness to loan $57 million for infrastructure costs around Foxboro to be repaid through parking revenue, led to a reversal of the Hartford deal.  As a result of threats of lawsuits by Connecticut Governor <a href="/wiki/John_Rowland" id="w">John Rowland</a>, Kraft paid $2.4 million to Connecticut to avoid any future litigation.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> The state-of-the-art stadium is widely considered to be one of the premier stadiums in the NFL.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Patriots missed the <a href="/wiki/NFL_playoffs%2C_2002-03" id="w">2002 playoffs</a>.  The team finished with a record of 9–7 and lost the division title to the New York Jets via a tiebreaker. In <a href="/wiki/2003_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">2003</a>, the Patriots started 2–2 but finished with a 14–2 record after fourteen straight wins on their way to <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII" id="w">Super Bowl XXXVIII</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Carolina_Panthers" id="w">Carolina Panthers</a>.  The Patriots won by a score of 32–29; the final three points came from another Adam Vinatieri field goal. Brady was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time in his career.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2004_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">2004</a>, the Patriots broke the NFL all-time regular season consecutive winning streak record of 18 straight wins with a victory against the Miami Dolphins. Later in the season, the Patriots lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, which halted their winning streak at 21 games. However, the NFL only counts regular-season wins in determining the consecutive wins record, so the Patriots&#39; streak officially stands at 18 games.

After finishing the 2004 season with a 14-2 record, the Patriots defeated the <a href="/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts" id="w">Indianapolis Colts</a> and Pittsburgh Steelers en route to <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXIX" id="w">Super Bowl XXXIX</a>. The Patriots went on to defeat the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles" id="w">Philadelphia Eagles</a> by a score of 24–21. The victory made the Patriots the first team in six years to repeat as NFL Super Bowl champions, and the second team ever to win three Super Bowls in four years.  After the 2004 season, Belichick&#39;s top two coordinators, <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Weis" id="w">Charlie Weis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Romeo_Crennel" id="w">Romeo Crennel</a>, left the team to pursue head coaching positions. Significant players moved on as well, including longtime Patriot <a href="/wiki/Cornerback" id="w">cornerback</a> <a href="/wiki/Ty_Law" id="w">Ty Law</a>.  Linebacker <a href="/wiki/Tedy_Bruschi" id="w">Tedy Bruschi</a> missed half of the <a href="/wiki/2005_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">2005 season</a> while recovering from a mild stroke.  During the 2005 season, the team lost several starters to injuries. The Patriots won the AFC East with a 10–6 record, then defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 28–3 in the first round of the <a href="/wiki/NFL_playoffs%2C_2005-06" id="w">playoffs</a> before losing to the Denver Broncos 27–13.  </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/2006_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">2006 off-season</a> saw the departure and arrival of several personnel. The team finished the 2006 regular season with a 12-4 record and won the AFC East for the fourth consecutive time.  The Patriots went on to defeat their rival the Jets 37-16 in the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League_playoffs%2C_2006-07" id="w">wild card round</a>.  In the following game, Brady, despite throwing 3 INTs, engineered a 4th quarter comeback to defeat the San Diego Chargers by the score of 24-21.  They faced the Colts in the AFC Championship but lost 38-34 after leading 21-3 midway through the second quarter.</p>
<p>During the 2007 <a href="/wiki/Season_(sports)#Off-season" id="w">offseason</a>, the Patriots traded for wide receiver <a href="/wiki/Randy_Moss" id="w">Randy Moss</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Oakland_Raiders" id="w">Oakland Raiders</a> and signed linebacker <a href="/wiki/Adalius_Thomas" id="w">Adalius Thomas</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens" id="w">Baltimore Ravens</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/2007_New_England_Patriots_season" id="w">2007 New England Patriots season</a> kicked off against the Jets. During the game, NFL security confiscated a video camera and its tape from a New England Patriots video assistant, Matt Estrella, who was filming the Jets coaching staff&#39;s play signals on the team&#39;s sideline.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/September_13" id="w">September 13</a>, Belichick was fined $500,000, and the Patriots fined $250,000. Additionally, the Patriots will forfeit their first-round selection in the <a href="/wiki/2008_NFL_Draft" id="w">2008 NFL Draft</a> because they reached the <a href="/wiki/NFL_playoffs%2C_2007-08" id="w">playoffs</a> (had the Patriots not made the playoffs, they would have forfeited their second- and third-round selections).<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup>

The Patriots finished the 2007 season with a 38-35 win over the New York Giants on December 29, making their record 16-0.  With the win, they now join the 1934 and 1942 Chicago Bears and the 1972 Miami Dolphins as the only teams to go undefeated in the regular season, and the 1st team to go 16-0 in the regular season (the other teams played 13, 11, and 14 games, respectively).</p>
<p>The team&#39;s on-field performance and attendance has drastically improved since Robert Kraft bought the team in 1994. In the 34 years prior to the arrival of Kraft, the Patriots had won the AFC East three times, made the playoffs six times (including their AFL Championship berth in 1963), and went to the Super Bowl once. Since Kraft, the Patriots have won the AFC East eight times, made the playoffs nine times and have been to the Super Bowl on four occasions, winning three. From the 1996 season onward, every Patriots home game has sold out, both at Foxboro and Gillette stadiums, including preseason games.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

The original Patriot logo was developed in 1960 by artist Phil Bissell.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>  The logo featured a New England Revolutionary War <a href="/wiki/Minuteman" id="w">minuteman</a> wearing a traditional uniform snapping a football. The first Patriots owner <a href="/wiki/Billy_Sullivan_(American_football)" id="w">Billy Sullivan</a> coined the logo&#39;s nickname: &#34;Pat Patriot&#34;.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> The team&#39;s original uniforms were red with white and blue stripes on their sleeves, and white pants and helmets. Initially, the helmets featured a Revolutionary War-era tricorn hat; however, this design was replaced with the Pat Patriot logo in 1961.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1993 changes to the Patriots&#39; uniforms and logo were rolled out by brief Patriots owner James B. Orthwein.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup>  The old &#34;Pat Patriot&#34; logo was retired and replaced with a stylized Patriot head in silhouette wearing a red-white-and-blue tricorn hat, designed in tandem with <a href="/wiki/NFL_Properties" id="w">NFL Properties</a>.  Fans and sports officials would eventually nickname the logo the &#34;Flying <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" id="w">Elvis</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup>  The team&#39;s uniforms were changed from red to &#34;Patriot&#34; (dark) blue, and both the helmets and pants from white to silver.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2000 the team made additional changes to their logo and uniform. Although the &#34;Flying Elvis&#34; logo remained, a darker blue color was introduced.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
