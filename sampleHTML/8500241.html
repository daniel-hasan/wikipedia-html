The <b>history of United States cricket</b> begins in the <a href="/wiki/Eighteenth_century" id="w">eighteenth century</a>. Among early Americans, <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricket</a> was as popular a bat and ball game as <a href="/wiki/Baseball" id="w">baseball</a>. Though Americans generally never played cricket in great numbers, it did enjoy an initial period of sustained growth.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Around the time of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Civil_War" id="w">United States Civil War</a>, the game began competing with baseball for participants, and cricket slowly declined in popularity. This was followed again by a brief <a href="/wiki/Golden_age" id="w">golden age</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphian_cricket_team" id="w">Philadelphian cricket team</a>. This lasted until roughly the start of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, at which time cricket again became less popular. In the latter part of the <a href="/wiki/Twentieth_century" id="w">twentieth century</a> immigrants from cricket playing nations in <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" id="w">south Asia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" id="w">West Indies</a> help spark a resurgence in the game&#39;s popularity. This led to participation and success in several <a href="/wiki/International_Cricket_Council" id="w">International Cricket Council</a> events. In 2007, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America_Cricket_Association" id="w">United States of America Cricket Association</a> was suspended by the ICC because of problems with its administration.</p>

Cricket enjoyed its greatest popularity along the east coast corridor between <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" id="w">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>. A contemporary report notes that upwards of 5,000 people played the game in those cities.<sup id="_ref-Kirsch_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kirsch" title="">[7]</a></sup> In 1833, students at <a href="/wiki/Haverford_College" id="w">Haverford College</a> established what is generally accepted as the first cricket club exclusively for Americans. This club was short-lived, but helped to keep interest in the sport alive in Philadelphia leading to the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Cricket_Club" id="w">Philadelphia Cricket Club</a> in 1854<sup id="_ref-Philly Club History_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Philly Club History" title="">[8]</a></sup> and the <a href="/wiki/Germantown_Cricket_Club" id="w">Germantown</a> and <a href="/wiki/Young_America_Cricket_Club" id="w">Young America</a> clubs in 1855.<sup id="_ref-Melville74_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville74" title="">[6]</a></sup> By this time, Philadelphia had become the unofficial &#34;Cricket Capital of America.&#34;</p>
<p>The United States holds the distinction of being a participant in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_v_Canada_(1844)" id="w">first international cricket match</a>. This match was first played against <a href="/wiki/Canada_cricket_team" id="w">Canada</a> on <a href="/wiki/24_September" id="w">24 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1844" id="w">1844</a> at the <a href="/wiki/St_George%26%2339%3Bs_Cricket_Club" id="w">St George&#39;s Cricket Club</a> Ground in <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>.<sup id="_ref-DasCricInfoArticle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DasCricInfoArticle" title="">[9]</a></sup> The match was attended by some 10,000 spectators, and is today the world&#39;s oldest international sporting event.<sup id="_ref-CricClub_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CricClub" title="">[10]</a></sup> Wagers of around $120,000 were placed on the outcome of the match. This is equivalent to around $1.5 million in 2007.<sup id="_ref-Canada Cricket_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Canada Cricket" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sides from England toured North America (taking in both the USA and Canada) following the English cricket seasons of 1859, 1868 and 1872. These were organised as purely commercial ventures. The <a href="/wiki/England_cricket_team_in_North_America_in_1859" id="w">1859 team</a> comprised six players from the <a href="/wiki/All-England_Eleven" id="w">All-England Eleven</a> and six from the United All-England Eleven and was captained by <a href="/wiki/George_Parr_(cricketer)" id="w">George Parr</a>. They played five matches, winning them all. There were no <a href="/wiki/First-class_cricket" id="w">first-class</a> fixtures. The match at New York attracted a crowd that was claimed to be 10,000, all that the ground would hold.</p>
<p>Tne 1868 tourists were led by <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Willsher" id="w">Edgar Willsher</a> and those of 1872-3 by <a href="/wiki/R.A._Fitzgerald" id="w">R.A. Fitzgerald</a>. The latter side included <a href="/wiki/W.G.Grace" id="w">W.G.Grace</a>. </p>
<p>Most of the matches of these early English touring teams were played &#34;against odds&#34;, that is to say the home team was permitted to have more than eleven players (usually twenty-two) in order to make a more even contest.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In spite of all this American growth in the game, it was slowly losing ground to a newcomer. In many cities, local cricket clubs were contributing to their own demise by encouraging crossover to the developing game of baseball. After the United States Civil War the <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati_Red_Stockings" id="w">Cincinnati Red Stockings</a> brought a talented young <a href="/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)" id="w">bowler</a> from the St. George&#39;s Cricket Club in New York to serve as a player and manager of the team. <a href="/wiki/Harry_Wright" id="w">Harry Wright</a> applied the &#34;scientific&#34; batting and specialized placement of fielders that he had learned in cricket to his new sport. This development was instrumental in creating the Cincinnati team&#39;s undefeated 1869 season. It also helped to secure the place of baseball as one of the most popular sports in the country.<sup id="_ref-Melville75_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville75" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>It may have been during the Civil War that baseball secured its place as America&#39;s game.<sup id="_ref-Melville75_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville75" title="">[13]</a></sup> An army making a brief stop at a location could easily organise a game of baseball on almost any clear patch of ground, whilst cricket required a carefully prepared pitch. Baseball began to poach players and administrators from the world of cricket. <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Young_(executive)" id="w">Nick Young</a>, who served for 25 years as the president of the <a href="/wiki/National_League" id="w">National League</a>, was originally a successful cricketer. It was not until the Civil War that he took up baseball because &#34;it looked like cricket for which his soul thirsted.&#34;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> It has been suggested that the fast-paced quick play of baseball was more appealing to Americans than the technical slower game of cricket.<sup id="_ref-Melville75_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville75" title="">[13]</a></sup> This natural tendency toward baseball was compounded by terrible American defeats at the hands of a traveling <a href="/wiki/England_national_cricket_team" id="w">English side</a> in 1859, which made is seem that the Americans would never be successful at this English game.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> By the end of the Civil War, most cricket fans had given up their hopes of broad-based support for the game. Baseball filled the role of the &#34;people&#39;s game&#34; and cricket became an amateur game for gentlemen.<sup id="_ref-Melville75_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville75" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

Following the Civil War, cricket grew into in amateur sport with much less broad appeal than it had had before. This manifestation can be seen in the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/Staten_Island_Cricket_and_Baseball_Club" id="w">Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club</a>. The club was to be based on &#34;the broadest and most liberal interpretation of the terms &#39;gentlemen&#39; and amateur.&#34; They were not that interested in playing baseball, but in founding a more responsive club in the area than the St George&#39;s Cricket Club.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The members of the Seabright Lawn Tennis Club became so interested in cricket that they convinced club officials to sod their cricket ground with turf imported from England and had the name of the club changed to the <a href="/wiki/Seabright_Lawn_Tennis_and_Cricket_Club" id="w">Seabright Lawn Tennis and Cricket Club</a> in 1885.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nowhere was this new trend in cricket more evident than in Philadelphia. In 1865 a group of young people in that city founded the <a href="/wiki/Merion_Cricket_Club" id="w">Merion Cricket Club</a>. They were very emphatic about the purity of the sport and thwarted early attempts by some to convert the club into baseball club.<sup id="_ref-Melville76_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville76" title="">[19]</a></sup> In the end, the club members passed a resolution that the remaining baseball equipment &#34;be sold off as quickly as possible&#34; to guarantee the purpose of the club.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Following the lead of New York and Philadelphia, other cities saw new clubs form. These included <a href="/wiki/St._Louis%2C_Missouri" id="w">St Louis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Boston</a>, <a href="/wiki/Detroit%2C_Michigan" id="w">Detroit</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Baltimore%2C_Maryland" id="w">Baltimore</a>.<sup id="_ref-Melville76-7_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville76-7" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>These decades also saw an increase in cricket-playing at the intercollegiate level. Following the Civil War, it looked like cricket might expand beyond its strongholds at Haverford College and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania" id="w">University of Pennsylvania</a>. Members of these schools joined together with delegates from other collegiate cricket clubs, including <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" id="w">Harvard University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" id="w">Columbia University</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton University</a>, to form the <a href="/wiki/Intercollegiate_Cricket_Association" id="w">Intercollegiate Cricket Association</a> in 1881.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The group was plagued by troubles and withdrawals.

The Philadelphian cricket team was a team that represented Philadelphia in <a href="/wiki/First-class_cricket" id="w">first-class cricket</a> between 1878 and 1913. The team was comprised of players from the four chief cricket clubs in Philadelphia&#8211;<a href="/wiki/Germantown_Cricket_Club" id="w">Germantown</a>, <a href="/wiki/Merion_Cricket_Club" id="w">Merion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belmont_Cricket_Club" id="w">Belmont</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Cricket_Club" id="w">Philadelphia</a>. Players from smaller clubs, such as <a href="/wiki/Tioga_Cricket_Club" id="w">Tioga</a> and <a href="/wiki/Moorestown_Cricket_Club" id="w">Moorestown</a>, and local colleges, such as Haverford, also played for the Philadelphians. Over its 35 years, the team played in 88 first-class cricket matches. Of those, 29 were won, 45 were lost, 13 were drawn and one game was abandoned before completion.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> The &#34;Gentlemen of Philadelphia&#34; were able to win at least a match or two from all of the foreign sides that visited. They beat <a href="/wiki/Australian_national_cricket_team" id="w">Australia&#39;s</a> test team by an innings on two separate occasions, in 1893 and 1896<sup id="_ref-Melville80_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville80" title="">[26]</a></sup> Throughout their first-class period of play, the Philadelphians produced such cricketers as <a href="/wiki/Bart_King" id="w">Bart King</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Patterson_(cricketer)" id="w">George Patterson</a>, and <a href="/wiki/John_Lester" id="w">John Lester</a>.</p>
<p>The success of the team and of the sport itself in Philadelphia was the result of broad support from the citizens of the city.<sup id="_ref-Melville80_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville80" title="">[26]</a></sup> Crowds of several thousand fans &#34;ranging from millionaires, coaching parties, and box holders to newsboys&#34; routinely filled the stands at the big four clubs during international matches.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> These matches were also widely reported in local newspapers. Unlike the other regional pockets of cricket enthusiasm across the country, the sport maintained is popularity for almost two decades into the twentieth century.<sup id="_ref-Melville80_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville80" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1897, the Gentlemen of Philadelphia were able to launch its first strictly first-class tour of England. This came about after many years of planning.This tour was a very ambitious one for the Americans. They had last toured the British Isles in 1889. Though the results may have been less satisfactory than hoped for by promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few of those on the American side expected to win many matches.<sup id="_ref-Wis1898Sum_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wis1898Sum" title="">[28]</a></sup> The 1897 schedule included all of the top <a href="/wiki/County_Championship" id="w">county cricket</a> teams, the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_University_Cricket_Club" id="w">Oxford</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_University_Cricket_Club" id="w">Cambridge University teams</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Marylebone_Cricket_Club" id="w">Marylebone Cricket Club</a>, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worth while to put their best elevens onto the field.<sup id="_ref-Wis1898Sum_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wis1898Sum" title="">[28]</a></sup> While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full <a href="/wiki/Sussex_County_Cricket_Club" id="w">Sussex</a> team at Brighton on <a href="/wiki/17_June" id="w">17 June</a>. In the first <a href="/wiki/Innings_(cricket)" id="w">innings</a>, King proved his batting worth on a fourth-<a href="/wiki/Wicket" id="w">wicket</a> stand of 107 runs with John Lester.<sup id="_ref-CricketArchive2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CricketArchive2" title="">[29]</a></sup> He then took 7 wickets for 13 runs and the team dismissed Sussex for 46 in less than an hour.<sup id="_ref-Barke_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barke" title="">[30]</a></sup> In the second innings, King took 6 for 102 and helped the Philadelphians to a victory by 8 wickets.<sup id="_ref-Quart_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Quart" title="">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Philadelphians again took King and his teammates to England in 1903. On this tour, the team rarely found itself outmatched. By the end of the tour, some English observers were comparing the Philadelphian team to some of the Australian sides that they had seen.<sup id="_ref-Melville82_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville82" title="">[32]</a></sup> One of the highlights of the tour was the win over <a href="/wiki/Gloucestershire_Country_Cricket_Club" id="w">Gloucestershire</a> by an innings and 26 runs. This was the worst defeat ever by an American side over and English county side.<sup id="_ref-Melville96_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville96" title="">[33]</a></sup> The Americans back home believed that this was the country&#39;s chance to burst onto the world cricket stage.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Unfortunately, this was followed by a relatively poor showing in 1908. The only bright spot of this tour was Bart King&#39;s capture of the season bowling record. His record of 11.01 was not bettered until 1958 when <a href="/wiki/Les_Jackson" id="w">Les Jackson</a> of <a href="/wiki/Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club" id="w">Derbyshire</a> posted an average of 10.99.<sup id="_ref-SABRUK_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SABRUK" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The Belmont Cricket Club was a casualty of cricket&#39;s decline in Philadelphia.  It was disbanded in 1914.</div>
Even as the Philadelphians were faring poorly in England in 1908, a more disturbing trend was showing itself back home in Philadelphia.  The sport&#39;s grassroots popularity was waning.  Many Philadelphian professionals began to fill their leisure time with other activities such as <a href="/wiki/Golf" id="w">golf</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tennis" id="w">tennis</a>.  Starting around 1905, the number of matches held in the city dropped off.  Some of the great clubs of the city even began to close down due to lack of members.  Bart King&#39;s own Belmont Cricket Club sold its grounds and disbanded in 1914.  The sport slowly declined in Philadelphia and the last first-class match in the city was played in 1913.<sup id="_ref-Melville83_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Melville83" title="">[36]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Another blow to cricket in the United States was the formation, in 1909, of the <a href="/wiki/International_Cricket_Council" id="w">Imperial Cricket Conference</a>.  As the name implied, this was meant to be an organization for cricketing nations in the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British Empire</a>.  Countries such as Australia and New Zealand were able to continue playing internationally, while the United States was left out.
