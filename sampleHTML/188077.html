<b>USS <i>Texas</i> (BB-35)</b> is a {{sclass}}, and the second ship of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" id="w">United States Navy</a> named to honor <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">the 28th state</a>. <i>Texas</i>’s keel was laid down on <a href="/wiki/17_April" id="w">17 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1911" id="w">1911</a> at <a href="/wiki/Newport_News%2C_Virginia" id="w">Newport News, Virginia</a>, by the <a href="/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_Newport_News" id="w">Newport News Shipbuilding</a> Company.

<p>During her career <i>Texas</i> saw action in <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexican</a> waters following the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Tampico_Affair" id="w">Tampico Incident</a>&#34;, and escorted Allied convoys across the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>.

<p><i>Texas</i> was <a href="/wiki/Ship_decommissioning" id="w">decommissioned</a> in 1948, having earned a total of five <a href="/wiki/Battle_star" id="w">battle stars</a> for service in World War II, and is presently a museum ship near <a href="/wiki/Houston%2C_Texas" id="w">Houston, Texas</a>.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/24_March" id="w">24 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a>, <i>Texas</i> departed the <a href="/wiki/Norfolk_Navy_Yard" id="w">Norfolk Navy Yard</a> and set a course for <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>. She made an overnight stop at <a href="/wiki/Tompkinsville%2C_New_York" id="w">Tompkinsville, New York</a>, on the night of <a href="/wiki/26_March" id="w">26 March</a> and entered the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Navy_Yard" id="w">New York Navy Yard</a> on the next day. She spent the next three weeks there undergoing the installation of the fire control equipment.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>During her stay in New York, <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" id="w">Woodrow Wilson</a> ordered a number of ships of the Atlantic Fleet to Mexican waters in response to tension created when a detail of Mexican Federal troops detained an American boat crew at <a href="/wiki/Tampico" id="w">Tampico</a>. The problem was quickly resolved locally, but <a href="/wiki/Rear_Admiral" id="w">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="/wiki/Henry_T._Mayo" id="w">Henry T.

<p>President Wilson saw in the incident an opportunity to put pressure on a government he felt was undemocratic. On <a href="/wiki/20_April" id="w">20 April</a>, Wilson placed the matter before the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" id="w">United States Congress</a> and sent orders to Rear Admiral <a href="/wiki/Frank_Friday_Fletcher" id="w">Frank Friday Fletcher</a>, commanding the naval force off the Mexican coast, instructing him to land a force at <a href="/wiki/Veracruz_(city)" id="w">Veracruz</a> and to seize the customs house there in retaliation for the celebrated &#34;<a href="/wiki/Tampico_Affair" id="w">Tampico Incident</a>.&#34; That action was carried out on <a href="/wiki/21_April" id="w">21 April</a> and <a href="/wiki/22_April" id="w">22 April</a>.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Due to the intensity of the situation, when <i>Texas</i> put to sea on <a href="/wiki/13_May" id="w">13 May</a> she headed directly to operational duty without benefit of the usual <a href="/wiki/Shakedown_cruise" id="w">shakedown cruise</a> and post-shakedown repair period.

She remained in Mexican waters for just over two months, supporting the American forces ashore. On <a href="/wiki/8_August" id="w">8 August</a>, she left Veracruz and set a course for <a href="/wiki/Nipe_Bay" id="w">Nipe Bay</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>, and thence steamed to New York where she entered the Navy Yard on <a href="/wiki/21_August" id="w">21 August</a>.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The battleship remained there until <a href="/wiki/6_September" id="w">6 September</a> when she returned to sea, joined the Atlantic Fleet, and settled into a schedule of normal fleet operations. In October, she returned to the Mexican coast. Later that month, <i>Texas</i> became station ship at <a href="/wiki/Tuxpan" id="w">Tuxpan</a>, a duty that lasted until early November. The ship finally bade Mexico farewell at Tampico on <a href="/wiki/20_December" id="w">20 December</a> and set a course for New York.

Upon her return to active duty with the fleet, <i>Texas</i> resumed a schedule of training operations along the New England coast and off the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Capes" id="w">Virginia Capes</a> alternated with winter fleet tactical and gunnery drills in the <a href="/wiki/West_Indies" id="w">West Indies</a>. That routine lasted just over two years until the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I#Entry_of_the_United_States" id="w">February-to-March crisis</a> over <a href="/wiki/Unrestricted_submarine_warfare" id="w">unrestricted submarine warfare</a> catapulted the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> into <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> in April 1917.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/6_April" id="w">6 April</a> declaration of war found <i>Texas</i> riding at anchor in the mouth of the <a href="/wiki/York_River_(Virginia)" id="w">York River</a> with the other Atlantic Fleet battleships. She remained in the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Capes" id="w">Virginia Capes</a>-<a href="/wiki/Hampton_Roads" id="w">Hampton Roads</a> vicinity until mid-August conducting exercises and training naval armed-guard gun crews for service on board merchant ships.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In August, she steamed to New York for repairs, arriving at Base 10 on <a href="/wiki/19_August" id="w">19 August</a> and entering the New York Navy Yard soon thereafter. She completed repairs on <a href="/wiki/26_September" id="w">26 September</a> and got underway for <a href="/wiki/Port_Jefferson%2C_New_York" id="w">Port Jefferson</a> that same day. During the mid-watch on <a href="/wiki/27_August" id="w">27 August</a>, however, she ran hard aground on <a href="/wiki/Block_Island" id="w">Block Island</a>. For three days, her crew lightened ship to no avail. On 30 August, tugs came to her assistance, and she finally backed clear. Hull damage dictated a return to the yard, and the extensive repairs required precluded her departure with Division 9 for the British Isles in November.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>By December, she had completed repairs and moved south to conduct <a href="/wiki/War_games" id="w">war games</a> out of the York River. Mid-January 1918 found the battleship back at New York preparing for the voyage across the Atlantic. She departed New York on <a href="/wiki/30_January" id="w">30 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a>, arrived at <a href="/wiki/Scapa_Flow" id="w">Scapa Flow</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Orkney_Islands" id="w">Orkney Islands</a> off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> on <a href="/wiki/11_February" id="w">11 February</a>, and rejoined Division 9, by then known as the 6th Battle Squadron of Britain&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Grand_Fleet" id="w">Grand Fleet</a>.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Texas<b>s service with the Grand Fleet consisted entirely of convoy missions and occasional forays to reinforce the British squadron on blockade duty in the <a href="/wiki/North_Sea" id="w">North Sea</a> whenever German heavy units threatened. The fleet alternated between bases at Scapa Flow and at the <a href="/wiki/Firth_of_Forth" id="w">Firth of Forth</a> in Scotland. <i>Texas</i> began her mission only five days after her arrival at Scapa Flow, where she sortied with the entire fleet to reinforce the Fourth Battle Squadron, then on duty in the North Sea. She returned to Scapa Flow the next day and remained until <a href="/wiki/8_March" id="w">8 March</a> when she put to sea on a convoy escort mission from which she returned on <a href="/wiki/13_March" id="w">13 March</a>. <i>Texas</i> and her division mates entered the Firth of Forth on <a href="/wiki/12_April" id="w">12 April</a> but got underway again on the 17th to escort a convoy. The American battleships returned to base on <a href="/wiki/20_April" id="w">20 April</a>. Four days later, <i>Texas</i> again stood out to sea to support the Second Battle Squadron the day after the German High Seas Fleet had sortied from Jade Bay toward the Norwegian coast to threaten an Allied convoy. Forward units caught sight of the retiring Germans on <a href="/wiki/25_April" id="w">25 April</a>, but at such an extreme range there was no possibility of bringing the German fleet into engagement with the Grand Fleet. The Germans returned to their base that day, and the Grand Fleet, including <i>Texas</i>, did likewise on the next.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p><i>Texas</i> and her division mates passed a relatively quiescent May in the Firth of Forth. On <a href="/wiki/9_June" id="w">9 June</a>, she got underway with the other warships of the Sixth Battle Squadron and headed back to the anchorage at Scapa Flow, arriving there the following day. Between <a href="/wiki/30_June" id="w">30 June</a> and <a href="/wiki/2_July" id="w">2 July</a>, <i>Texas</i> and her colleagues acted as escort for American minelayers adding to the North Sea mine barrage. After a two-day return to Scapa Flow, <i>Texas</i> put to sea with the Grand Fleet to conduct two days of tactical exercises and war games. At the conclusion of those drills on <a href="/wiki/8_July" id="w">8 July</a>, the fleet entered the Firth of Forth. For the remainder of World War I, <i>Texas</i> and the other battleships of Division 9 continued to operate with the Grand Fleet as the Sixth Battle Squadron. With the German Fleet increasingly more tied to its bases in the estuaries of the <a href="/wiki/Jade_River" id="w">Jade River</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Ems_River" id="w">Ems River</a>, the American and British ships settled more and more into a routine schedule of operations with little or no hint of combat operations. That state of affairs lasted until the armistice ended hostilities on <a href="/wiki/11_November" id="w">11 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a>. On the night of <a href="/wiki/20_November" id="w">20 November</a>, she accompanied the Grand Fleet to meet the surrendering German Fleet. The two fleets rendezvoused about 40&#160;miles (60&#160;km) east of <a href="/wiki/May_Island" id="w">May Island</a> near the mouth of the Firth of Forth and proceeded together into the anchorage at Scapa Flow. Afterward, the American contingent moved to <a href="/wiki/Portland_Harbour" id="w">Portland Harbour</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, arriving there on <a href="/wiki/4_December" id="w">4 December</a>.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Post_World_War_I" name="Post_World_War_I"></a><h2>Post World War I</h2>
<p>Eight days later, <i>Texas</i> put to sea with Divisions 9 and 6 to meet President Woodrow Wilson embarked in <i>George Washington</i> on his way to the <a href="/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference%2C_1919" id="w">Paris Peace Conference</a>. The rendezvous took place at about 0730 the following morning and provided an escort for the President into <a href="/wiki/Brest%2C_France" id="w">Brest, France</a>, where the ships arrived at 1230 that afternoon. That evening, <i>Texas</i> and the other American battleships departed Brest for Portland where they stopped briefly on <a href="/wiki/14_December" id="w">14 December</a> before getting underway to return to the United States. The warships arrived off <a href="/wiki/Ambrose_light_station" id="w">Ambrose light station</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_25" id="w">Christmas Day</a>, 1918, and entered New York on the 26th.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following overhaul, <i>Texas</i> resumed duty with the Atlantic Fleet early in 1919. On <a href="/wiki/9_March" id="w">9 March</a>, she became the first American battleship to carry an airplane when Lieutenant Commander Edward O. McDonnell flew a British-built <a href="/wiki/Sopwith_Camel" id="w">Sopwith Camel</a> off the warship. That summer, she was reassigned to the Pacific Fleet. On <a href="/wiki/17_July" id="w">17 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a>, she was designated BB-35 as a result of the Navy&#39;s adoption of the alpha-numeric system of <a href="/wiki/Hull_classification_symbol" id="w">hull classification symbols</a>.<sup id="_ref-HNSVG_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HNSVG" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DANFS_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<i>Texas</i> served in the Pacific until 1924 when she returned to the east coast for overhaul and to participate in a training cruise to European waters with Naval Academy midshipmen embarked. While operating in the Atlantic she sank the incomplete battleship {{USS}} so the U.S. would be in compliance with the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Naval_Treaty" id="w">Naval Arms Limitation Treaty of 1922</a>. That fall, she conducted maneuvers as a unit of the Scouting Fleet. In 1925, she entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for a major modernization overhaul during which her cage masts were replaced with a single tripod foremast. She also received the very latest in fire control equipment. Following that overhaul, she was designated the flagship of the U.S. Fleet and resumed duty along the eastern seaboard. She kept at that task until late in 1927 when she did a brief tour of duty in the Pacific between late September and early December. In 1927 <i>Texas</i> set another first by inaugurating the use of &#34;talking&#34; pictures for crew entertainment.<sup id="_ref-HNSVG_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HNSVG" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DANFS_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Near the end of the year, <i>Texas</i> returned to the Atlantic and resumed normal duty with the Scouting Fleet. In January 1928, she transported President <a href="/wiki/Calvin_Coolidge" id="w">Calvin Coolidge</a> to <a href="/wiki/Havana%2C_Cuba" id="w">Havana, Cuba</a>, for the Pan-American conference and then continued on via the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Canal" id="w">Panama Canal</a> and the west coast to maneuvers with the fleet near Hawaii.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>She returned to New York early in 1929 for her annual overhaul and had completed it by March when she began another brief tour of duty in the Pacific. She returned to the Atlantic in June and resumed normal duty with the Scouting Fleet. In April 1930, she took time from her operating schedule to escort SS <i>Leviathan</i> into New York when that ship returned from Europe carrying the delegation that had represented the United States at the <a href="/wiki/London_Naval_Conference" id="w">London Naval Conference</a>. In January 1931, she left the yard at New York as <a href="/wiki/Flagship" id="w">flagship</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Fleet" id="w">United States Fleet</a> and headed via the Panama Canal to <a href="/wiki/San_Diego%2C_California" id="w">San Diego, California</a>, her home port for the next six years. During that period, she served first as flagship for the entire Fleet and, later, as flagship for Battleship Division (BatDiv) 1. She left the Pacific once during that time, in the summer of 1936, when she joined in a midshipman training cruise in the Atlantic.

<p>In the summer of 1937, she once more was reassigned to the east coast, as the flagship of the Training Detachment, United States Fleet. Late in 1938 or early in 1939, the warship became flagship of the newly organized Atlantic Squadron, built around BatDiv 5. Through both organizational assignments, her labors were directed primarily to training missions, midshipman cruises, naval reserve drills, and training members of the <a href="/wiki/Fleet_Marine_Force" id="w">Fleet Marine Force</a>.

The ships arrived off the assault beaches early in the morning of <a href="/wiki/8_November" id="w">8 November</a> and began preparations for the invasion. <i>Texas</i> transmitted <a href="/wiki/General" id="w">General</a> <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" id="w">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>&#39;s first &#34;Voice of Freedom&#34; broadcast, asking the French not to oppose Allied landings on North Africa. When the troops went ashore, <i>Texas</i> did not come immediately into action to support them. At that point in the war, amphibious warfare doctrine was still embryonic; and many did not recognize the value of a pre-landing bombardment.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_t" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup> Instead, the Army insisted upon attempting surprise. <i>Texas</i> finally entered the fray early in the afternoon when the Army requested her to destroy an <a href="/wiki/Ammunition_dump" id="w">ammunition dump</a> near <a href="/wiki/Port_Lyautey" id="w">Port Lyautey</a>. For the next week, she contented herself with cruising up and down the <a href="/wiki/Morocco" id="w">Moroccan</a> coast delivering similar, specific, call-fire missions.  Thus, unlike in later operations, she expended only 273 rounds of 14&#160;inch (356&#160;mm) ammunition and six rounds of 5&#160;inch (127&#160;mm) ammunition. During her short stay, some of her crew briefly went ashore to assist in salvaging some of the shipping sunk in the harbor. During her time off Morocco <i>Texas</i> put <a href="/wiki/Walter_Cronkite" id="w">Walter Cronkite</a> ashore to begin his career as a <a href="/wiki/War_correspondent" id="w">war correspondent</a>. On <a href="/wiki/16_November" id="w">16 November</a>, she departed North Africa and headed for home in company with {{USS}}, {{USS}}, {{USS}}, four transports, and seven <a href="/wiki/Destroyer" id="w">destroyers</a>.<sup id="_ref-HNSVG_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HNSVG" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DANFS_u" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Operation_Overlord" name="Operation_Overlord"></a><h3>Operation Overlord</h3>
<p>Throughout 1943 <i>Texas</i> carried out the familiar role of convoy escort. With New York as her home port, she made numerous transatlantic voyages to such places as Casablanca and Gibraltar, as well as frequent visits to ports in the British Isles. That routine continued into 1944 but ended <a href="/wiki/22_April" id="w">22 April</a> of that year when, at the European end of one such mission, she remained at the Clyde estuary in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> and began training for the invasion of <a href="/wiki/Normandy" id="w">Normandy</a>.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_v" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

During the next 12 days, <i>Texas</i> carried out many 14-inch gun-firing exercises with British battleships {{HMS}} and {{HMS}}. The firing was done in conjunction with <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" id="w">Royal Air Force</a> airplanes as spotters, which would provide the spotting during the invasion.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/3_June" id="w">3 June</a>, at 02:09, the Western Taskforce to which <i>Texas</i> was assigned sailed from Belfast Lough for Normandy. In sight, on a parallel course was a group of British ships, including the battleships {{HMS}} and <i>Ramillies</i>. On <a href="/wiki/4_June" id="w">4 June</a>, at 07:10, the taskforce had to reverse course due to unacceptable weather in the Normandy. Later that evening, off Lundry Island, the taskforce reversed course and headed for the invasion fleet gathering in Area Z. Joining up at Area Z, the invasion fleet headed south toward Normandy and the German <a href="/wiki/Minefield" id="w">minefield</a>. <a href="/wiki/Minesweeper_(ship)" id="w">Minesweepers</a> had cleared channels through the mines and not a single Omaha Beach vessel was lost.<sup id="_ref-DDay_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DDay" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="D-Day" name="D-Day"></a><h4>D-Day</h4>
<p>At 03:00 on <a href="/wiki/6_June" id="w">6 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a> <i>Texas</i> and the British cruiser <a href="/wiki/HMS_Glasgow_(C21)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Glasgow&#39;&#39;</a> entered the Omaha Western fire support lane and into her initial firing position, at 04:41, 12,000&#160;yards (11&#160;km) offshore near <a href="/wiki/Pointe_du_Hoc" id="w">Pointe du Hoc</a>, along with battleships <i>Arkansas</i> and <i>Nevada</i>, and three US heavy cruisers, along with a combined US-British flotilla of battleships, five cruisers and 22 destroyers.<sup id="_ref-DDay_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DDay" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The initial bombardment commenced at 05:50, against the site of six 15 cm (approximately 6 in) guns, atop Point du Hoc. When <i>Texas</i> ceased firing at the Point, at 06:24, 255 14-inch shells had been fired in 34 minutes for a rate of fire of 7.5 shells a minute. This was also the longest sustained period of firing for <i>Texas</i> in WWII. While shells from the main guns were hitting Point du Hoc, the 5-inch guns were firing on the area leading up to Exit D-1, the route to get inland from Western Omaha. At 06:26 <i>Texas</i> shifted her main battery gunfire to the western edge of Omaha Beach, around the town of <a href="/wiki/Vierville" id="w">Vierville</a>. Meanwhile, her secondary battery went to work on another target on the western end of &#34;Omaha&#34; beach, a ravine laced with strong points to defend an exit road. Later, under control of airborne spotters, she moved her major-caliber fire inland to interdict enemy reinforcement activities and to destroy batteries and other strong points farther inland.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_w" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>By noon, the assault on Omaha Beach was in danger of collapsing due to stronger than anticipated German resistance and the inability of the Allies to get needed <a href="/wiki/Armor" id="w">armor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Artillery" id="w">artillery</a> units on the beach. In an effort to help the infantry fighting to take Omaha, some of the destroyers providing gunfire support closed near the shoreline, almost grounding themselves to fire on the Germans. <i>Texas</i> also closed to the shoreline; at 12:23, <i>Texas</i> closed to only 3,000&#160;yards (2.7&#160;km) from the water&#39;s edge, firing her main guns at almost 0 degrees of elevation to clear the western exit D-1, in front of Vierville. Among other things, she fired upon <a href="/wiki/Sniper" id="w">snipers</a> and machine gun nests hidden in a defile just off the beach. At the conclusion of that mission, the battleship attacked enemy anti-aircraft battery located west of <a href="/wiki/Vierville" id="w">Vierville</a>.<sup id="_ref-DDay_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DDay" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/7_June" id="w">7 June</a> the battleship received word that the Ranger battalion at Point Du Hoc was still isolated from the rest of the invasion force with low <a href="/wiki/Ammunition" id="w">ammunition</a> and mounting casualties; in response, <i>Texas</i> launched two small boats with provisions for the Rangers. Upon their return the boats brought 34 wounded Rangers to <i>Texas</i> for treatment, along with a handful of German <a href="/wiki/POW" id="w">prisoners</a> who were interrogated aboard the battleship before being loaded aboard an LST for transfer to England. Later in the day, her main battery rained shells on the enemy-held towns of <a href="/wiki/Surrain" id="w">Surrain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Trevieres" id="w">Trevieres</a> to break up German troop concentrations. That evening, she bombarded a German mortar battery that had been shelling the beach. Not long after midnight, German planes attacked the ships offshore, and one of them swooped in low on <i>Texas</i>’s starboard quarter. Her anti-aircraft batteries opened up immediately but failed to hit the intruder. On the morning of <a href="/wiki/8_June" id="w">8 June</a>, her guns fired on <a href="/wiki/Isigny" id="w">Isigny</a>, then on a shore battery, and finally on Trevieres once more.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_x" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>After that, she retired to Plymouth to rearm, returning to the <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> coast on <a href="/wiki/11_June" id="w">11 June</a>. From then until <a href="/wiki/15_June" id="w">15 June</a>, she supported the army in its advance inland. By June 15 the troops had advanced to the edge of <i>Texas</i>’s gun range; her last fire support mission was so far inland that to get the needed range, the starboard torpedo blister was flooded with water to provide 2 degrees of list. With combat operations beyond the range of her guns on <a href="/wiki/16_June" id="w">16 June</a> <i>Texas</i> moved on to another mission.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_y" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DDay_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DDay" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>On the morning of <a href="/wiki/26_June" id="w">26 June</a>, <i>Texas</i> closed in on the vital port of <a href="/wiki/Cherbourg-Octeville" id="w">Cherbourg</a> and, with {{USS}}, opened fire upon various fortifications and batteries surrounding the town. The guns on shore returned fire immediately and, at about 12:30, succeeded in straddling <i>Texas</i>. The battleship continued her firing runs in spite of shell geysers blossoming about her; however, the enemy gunners were stubborn and skilled. At 13:16 a 280&#160;mm shell slammed into her fire control tower, killed the <a href="/wiki/Helmsman" id="w">helmsman</a>, and wounded nearly everyone on the navigation bridge. <i>Texas</i>’s commanding officer, Captain Baker, miraculously escaped unhurt and quickly had the bridge cleared. The warship herself continued to deliver her 14&#160;inch (356&#160;mm) shells in spite of damage and casualties. Some time later, another shell struck the battleship. That one, a 240&#160;mm armor-piercing shell, crashed through the port bow and entered a compartment located below the wardroom, but failed to explode. Throughout the three-hour duel, the Germans straddled and near-missed <i>Texas</i> over 65 times, but she continued her mission until 16:00 when, upon orders to that effect, she retired.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_z" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Texas</i> underwent repairs at Plymouth, England, and then drilled in preparation for the invasion of southern France.

Due to the fact that the troops ashore moved inland rapidly against light resistance, she provided fire support for the assault for only two days. <i>Texas</i> departed the southern coast of France on the evening of <a href="/wiki/16_August" id="w">16 August</a>.

<p>At New York, <i>Texas</i> underwent a 36-day repair period during which the barrels on her main battery were replaced. After a brief refresher cruise, she departed New York in November and set a course, via the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Canal" id="w">Panama Canal</a>, for the Pacific. She made a stop at <a href="/wiki/Long_Beach%2C_California" id="w">Long Beach, California</a>, and then continued on to <a href="/wiki/Oahu" id="w">Oahu</a>. She spent Christmas at <a href="/wiki/Pearl_Harbor" id="w">Pearl Harbor</a> and then conducted maneuvers in the <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" id="w">Hawaiian Islands</a> for about a month at the end of which she steamed to <a href="/wiki/Ulithi_Atoll" id="w">Ulithi Atoll</a>.

She arrived off the target on <a href="/wiki/16_February" id="w">16 February</a>, three days before the scheduled assault. She spent those three days pounding enemy defenses on Iwo Jima in preparation for the landings. After the troops stormed ashore on <a href="/wiki/19_February" id="w">19 February</a>, <i>Texas</i> switched roles and began delivering <a href="/wiki/Naval_gunfire_support" id="w">naval gunfire support</a> and on-call fire. She remained off Iwo Jima for almost a fortnight, helping the Marines subdue a well dug-in and stubborn Japanese garrison.<sup id="_ref-DANFS_B" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DANFS" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though Iwo Jima was not declared secured until <a href="/wiki/16_March" id="w">16 March</a>, <i>Texas</i> cleared the area late in February and returned to Ulithi early in March to prepare for the <a href="/wiki/Okinawa" id="w">Okinawa</a> operation. She departed Ulithi with TF&#160;54, the gunfire support unit, on <a href="/wiki/21_March" id="w">21 March</a> and arrived in the <a href="/wiki/Ryukyus" id="w">Ryukyus</a> on the 26th. <i>Texas</i> did not participate in the occupation of the islands but moved in on the main objective instead, beginning the pre-landing bombardment that same day.

Each evening, she retired from her bombardment position close to the Okinawan shore only to return the next day and resume her poundings. The enemy ashore, preparing for a defense-in-depth strategy as at Iwo Jima, made no answer. Only air units provided a response, as several <a href="/wiki/Kamikaze" id="w">kamikaze</a> raids were sent to harass the bombardment group. <i>Texas</i> escaped damage during those small attacks. After six days of aerial and naval bombardment, the ground troops&#39; turn came on 1 April. They stormed ashore against initially light resistance.

On <a href="/wiki/21_January" id="w">21 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1946" id="w">1946</a>, the warship departed San Pedro and steamed via the Panama Canal to Norfolk where she arrived on <a href="/wiki/13_February" id="w">13 February</a>. She soon began preparations for inactivation. In June, she was moved to <a href="/wiki/Baltimore%2C_Maryland" id="w">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, where she remained until the beginning of 1948. <i>Texas</i> was towed to <a href="/wiki/San_Jacinto_Monument" id="w">San Jacinto State Park</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Houston%2C_Texas" id="w">Houston</a>, where she was decommissioned on <a href="/wiki/21_April" id="w">21 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1948" id="w">1948</a>, and turned over to the state of <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a> to serve as a permanent memorial.

<p>In 1948, <i>Texas</i> became the first battleship memorial museum in the U.S.<sup id="_ref-TXSite_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TXSite" title="">[9]</a></sup> That same year, on the anniversary of Texas Independence, the battleship was presented to the <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">State of Texas</a> and commissioned as the flagship of the Texas Navy. She was permanently anchored on the <a href="/wiki/Buffalo_Bayou" id="w">Buffalo Bayou</a> and the busy <a href="/wiki/Houston_Ship_Channel" id="w">Houston Ship Channel</a> near the <a href="/wiki/San_Jacinto_Monument" id="w">San Jacinto Monument</a>.<sup id="_ref-TXSite_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TXSite" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>By 1983, after languishing at anchor for 35 years, the ship was in bad shape and rapidly deteriorating.  She had settled on the bottom of her anchorage, and she was suffering horrible rust, particularly in the lower hull which was buried in four feet of mud. During <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Alicia" id="w">Hurricane Alicia</a>, however, it was reported by local news agencies that <i>Texas</i> had risen with the hurricane&#39;s storm surge and actually floated during the storm, to the surprise of even her caretakers. Shortly thereafter <i>Texas</i> was placed under the stewardship of the <a href="/wiki/Texas_Parks_and_Wildlife_Department" id="w">Texas Parks and Wildlife Department</a>, and a five-year-long, state-wide campaign was launched to collect aluminum soda can tabs to finance a complete restoration.  </p>
<p>Finally, in 1988 the battleship was closed to the public. Amid much fanfare and many continuously-running bilge pumps, <i>Texas</i> was set afloat once more and towed by barge to a drydock in Galveston.
