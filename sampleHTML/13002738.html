<p>This <b>history of crossbows</b> documents the historical development and use of the <a href="/wiki/Crossbow" id="w">crossbow</a>.</p>
<p>It is not clear exactly where and when the crossbow originated, but there is undoubted evidence that it was used for <a href="/wiki/Military" id="w">military</a> purposes from the second half of the <a href="/wiki/4th_century_BC" id="w">4th century BC</a> onwards.</p>


<a id="Ancient_Greece" name="Ancient_Greece"></a><h1> Ancient Greece </h1>

<p>The earliest date for the crossbow is from the 5th century BC,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> from the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" id="w">Greek</a> world. This was called the <i><a href="/wiki/Gastraphetes" id="w">gastraphetes</a></i>, which could store more energy than the Greek bows, and was used in the <a href="/wiki/Sicilian_Wars#The Second Sicilian War (410 BC-340 BC)" id="w">Siege of Motya</a> in 397 BC. This was a key <a href="/wiki/Carthaginian" id="w">Carthaginian</a> stronghold in <a href="/wiki/Sicily" id="w">Sicily</a>, as described in the <a href="/wiki/1st_century_AD" id="w">1st century AD</a> by <a href="/wiki/Heron_of_Alexandria" id="w">Heron of Alexandria</a> in his book <i>Belopoeica</i>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> This date for the introduction of the crossbow in the Mediterranean is not accepted without doubt because of the temporal difference between writer and event and the lack of other sources stating the same. <a href="/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" id="w">Alexander</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre" id="w">siege of Tyre</a> in 332 BC provides reliable sources for the use of these weapons by the Greek besiegers.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The efficiency of the gastraphetes was improved by introducing the <a href="/wiki/Ballista" id="w">ballista</a>. Its application in sieges and against rigid infantry formations featured more and more powerful projectiles, leading to technical improvements and larger ballistae. The smaller sniper version was often called <i>Scorpio</i>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> An example for the importance of ballistae in Hellenistic warfare is the <i><a href="/wiki/Helepolis" id="w">Helepolis</a></i>, a siege tower employed by <a href="/wiki/Demetrius_I_of_Macedon" id="w">Demetrius</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Rhodes" id="w">Siege of Rhodes</a> in <a href="/wiki/305_BC" id="w">305 BC</a>. At each level of the moveable tower were several ballistae. The large ballistae at the bottom level were designed to destroy the <a href="/wiki/Parapet" id="w">parapet</a> and clear it of any hostile troop concentrations while the small armorbreaking scorpios at the top level sniped at the besieged. This suppressive shooting would allow them to mount the wall with ladders more safely.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>The use of crossbows in European warfare dates back to Roman times and is again evident from the battle of Hastings until about 1500 AD. They almost completely superseded hand bows in many European armies in the twelfth century for a number of reasons. Although a <a href="/wiki/Longbow" id="w">longbow</a> had greater range, could achieve comparable accuracy and faster shooting rate than an average crossbow, crossbows could release more kinetic energy and be used effectively after a week of training, while a comparable single-shot skill with a longbow could take years of practice.
In the armies of Europe,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> mounted and unmounted crossbowmen, often mixed with javeliners and archers, occupied a central position in battle formations. Usually they engaged the enemy in offensive skirmishes before an assault of mounted <a href="/wiki/Knight" id="w">knights</a>. Crossbowmen were also valuable in counterattacks to protect their infantry. The rank of commanding officer of the crossbowmen corps was one of the highest positions in any army of this time. Along with <a href="/wiki/Pole_weapon" id="w">polearm</a> weapons made from farming equipment, the crossbow was also a weapon of choice for insurgent peasants such as the <a href="/wiki/Taborite" id="w">Taborites</a>. Famous were the <a href="/wiki/Genoese_crossbowmen" id="w">Genoese crossbowmen</a> who hired as mercenaries for many countries in medieval Europe, while the crossbow also played an important role in anti-personnel defence of ships.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Crossbowmen among the Flemish citizens,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> in the army of <a href="/wiki/Richard_Lionheart" id="w">Richard Lionheart</a>, and others, could have up to two servants, two crossbows and a <a href="/wiki/Pavise" id="w">pavise</a> shield to protect the men. Then one of the servants had the task of reloading the weapons, while the second subordinate would carry and hold the pavise (the archer himself also wore protective armor). Such a three-man team could shoot 8 shots per minute, compared to a single crossbowman&#39;s 3 shots per minute. The archer was the leader of the team, the one who owned the equipment, and the one who received payment for their services. The payment for a crossbow mercenary was higher than for a longbow mercenary, but the longbowman did not have to pay a team of assistants and his equipment was cheaper.</p>

<p>Mounted knights armed with lances proved ineffective against formations of <a href="/wiki/Pike_(weapon)" id="w">pikemen</a> combined with crossbowmen whose weapons could penetrate most knights&#39; armor. The invention of pushlever and ratchet drawing mechanisms enabled the use of crossbows on horseback., leading to the development of new cavalry tactics. Knights and mercenaries deployed in triangular formations, with the most heavily armored knights at the front. Some of these riders would carry small, powerful all-metal crossbows of their own. Crossbows were eventually replaced in warfare by <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" id="w">gunpowder</a> weapons, although early guns had slower rates of fire and much worse accuracy than contemporary crossbows. Later, similar competing tactics would feature <a href="/wiki/Arquebus" id="w">harquebusiers</a> or <a href="/wiki/Musket" id="w">musketeers</a> in formation with pikemen, pitted against cavalry firing <a href="/wiki/Pistol" id="w">pistols</a> or <a href="/wiki/Carbine" id="w">carbines</a>.</p>
<p>Up until the seventeenth century most beekeepers in Europe kept their hives spread across the woods and had to defend them against bears. Therefore their guild was granted the right to bear arms and is commonly depicted carrying heavy crossbows.</p>

<p>The earliest documention of a Chinese crossbow is in scripts from the 4th&#8211;3rd century BC attributed to the followers of <a href="/wiki/Mohist" id="w">Mozi</a>. This source refers the use of a giant crossbow <a href="/wiki/Catapult" id="w">catapult</a> to the 6th to 5th century BC, corresponding to the late <a href="/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_Period" id="w">Spring and Autumn Period</a>. The date is several centuries before the appearance of the manuscript. As a result the dating from the source can not be used without doubt to determine when the use of crossbows started in Chinese history, although the age of the source can.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Sun_Tzu" id="w">Sun Tzu</a>&#39;s influential book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Art_of_War" id="w">The Art of War</a></i> (first appearance dated in between 500 BC to 300 BC<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>) refers in chapter V to the traits and in XII to the use of crossbows.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> One of the earliest reliable records of this weapon in warfare is from an ambush, the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Maling" id="w">Battle of Ma-Ling</a> in 341 BC. By the 200s BC, the crossbow (nǔ, 弩) was well developed and quite widely used in <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Saracen" id="w">Saracens</a> called the crossbow <i>qaws Ferengi</i>, or &#34;Frankish bow&#34;, as the Crusaders used the crossbow against the Arab and Turkoman horsemen with remarkable success. The adapted crossbow was used by the Islamic armies in defence of their castles. Later footstrapped version become very popular among the Muslim armies in Spain. During the <a href="/wiki/Crusades" id="w">Crusades</a>, Europeans were exposed to Saracen <a href="/wiki/Composite_bow" id="w">composite bows</a>, made from layers of different material&#8212;often wood, horn and sinew&#8212;glued together and bound with animal tendon. These composite bows could be much more powerful than wooden bows, and were adopted for crossbow prods across Europe.</p>

<p>In Western Africa crossbows served as a scout weapon and for hunting, with enslaved Africans bringing the technology to America.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> In the American south, the crossbow was used for hunting when firearms or gunpowder were unavailable because of economic hardships or isolation.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Light hunting crossbows were traditionally used by the Inuit in Northern America.</p>
