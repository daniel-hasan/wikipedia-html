<div id="Eorl">

<ul>
<li><b>Eorl</b>: Called &#39;the Young&#39;, lord of the <a href="/wiki/Éoth%C3%A9od" id="w">Éothéod</a> (<a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">T.A.</a> 2501–2510) and King of <a href="/wiki/Rohan" id="w">Rohan</a> (<a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">T.A.</a> 2510–2545). He was the founder of the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Eorl" id="w">House of Eorl</a>. Eorl, son of <a href="/wiki/L%C3%A9od" id="w">Léod</a>, was the ruler of the <a href="/wiki/Northmen" id="w">Northmen</a> tribe of the Éothéod, who dwelt between the Langwell and Greylin rivers. One of the most renowned aspects of his reign was his unexpected arrival in the perilous <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Field_of_Celebrant" id="w">Battle of the Field of Celebrant</a> where he came to the aid of <a href="/wiki/Gondor" id="w">Gondor</a>. He may be regarded as the true hero of this battle, and as such was granted lands in <a href="/wiki/Calenardhon" id="w">Calenardhon</a> by <a href="/wiki/Cirion" id="w">Cirion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Steward_of_Gondor" id="w">Steward of Gondor</a>.  He led the migration of his people to these great pastures and there he became the first King of <a href="/wiki/Rohan" id="w">Rohan</a>.  He then swore the <a href="/wiki/Oath_of_Eorl" id="w">Oath of Eorl</a> to Cirion. Eorl established his new capital at Aldburg in the Folde. He was called <i>the Young</i> because his reign started when he was just sixteen, and he retained his youthful appearance throughout his reign. The <a href="/wiki/Rohirrim" id="w">Rohirrim</a> call themselves the <i>Eorlingas</i>, the Sons of Eorl. He died in battle in the Wold against the <a href="/wiki/Easterlings" id="w">Easterlings</a>.</li></ul>
<p />
<div id="Brego">

<ul>
<li><b>Brego</b>: The second King of <a href="/wiki/Rohan" id="w">Rohan</a>. Brego became King at the death of his father <i><a href="/wiki/Eorl_the_Young" id="w">Eorl the Young</a></i> in 2545 (<a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">Third Age</a>). During his rule the migration of the <a href="/wiki/Éoth%C3%A9od" id="w">Éothéod</a> to <a href="/wiki/Calenardhon" id="w">Calenardhon</a> continued, and Brego defended the borders of Rohan against their enemies (the <a href="/wiki/Dunlendings" id="w">Dunlendings</a> and <a href="/wiki/Easterlings" id="w">Easterlings</a>). Brego built the Golden Hall of <a href="/wiki/Meduseld" id="w">Meduseld</a>, and made <a href="/wiki/Edoras" id="w">Edoras</a> the <a href="/wiki/Capital" id="w">capital</a> of Rohan. His eldest son <a href="/wiki/Baldor" id="w">Baldor</a> in his pride went into the <a href="/wiki/Paths_of_the_Dead" id="w">Paths of the Dead</a> never to be found again, and Brego died of grief soon after. He was followed by his second son, <a href="/wiki/Aldor_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Aldor</a>. Brego had a third son named Éofor. Éofor was an ancestor of Éomund of East-fold father of Éomer.</li></ul>
<p />
<div id="Aldor">

<ul>
<li><b>Aldor</b>: The third King of <a href="/wiki/Rohan" id="w">Rohan</a>, and its longest reigning monarch. Aldor was the second son of King <a href="/wiki/Brego" id="w">Brego</a>. His elder brother <a href="/wiki/Baldor" id="w">Baldor</a> was lost while attempting to pass the <a href="/wiki/Paths_of_the_Dead" id="w">Paths of the Dead</a>, so Aldor became king when his father died, in <a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">T.A.</a> 2570, at the age of 26. His long rule was a golden age for Rohan, as the numbers of the <a href="/wiki/Rohirrim" id="w">Rohirrim</a> increased, and the <a href="/wiki/Dunlendings" id="w">Dunlendings</a> were chased past the <a href="/wiki/Gap_of_Rohan" id="w">Gap of Rohan</a> beyond the borders of <a href="/wiki/Adorn" id="w">Adorn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Isen" id="w">Isen</a>. He also established <a href="/wiki/Dunharrow" id="w">Dunharrow</a> as a refuge. Aldor had many children, of which the three eldest were daughters. He ruled for 75 years, and became known as <i>Aldor the Old</i>. He died in T.A. 2645, at the age of 102, a year after the birth of his first great-great-grandson. He was succeeded by his fourth child, <a href="/wiki/Fr%C3%A9a" id="w">Fréa</a>, who had to wait until he was himself seventy-five years old before he became Lord of the Mark.</li></ul>
<p />
<div id="Fréa">

<ul>
<li><b>Fréa</b>: The fourth King of <a href="/wiki/Rohan" id="w">Rohan</a>. Fréa became King at the death of his father <a href="/wiki/Aldor_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Aldor</a> the Old in <a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">T.A.</a> 2645, aged already 75. He was the fourth child of Aldor, and had three older sisters. He ruled for just 14 years before he died and was followed by his son <a href="/wiki/Fr%C3%A9awine" id="w">Fréawine</a>.</li></ul>
<p />
<div id="Fréawine">

<ul>
<li><b>Fréawine</b>: The fifth King of <a href="/wiki/Rohan" id="w">Rohan</a>. Fréawine became King at the death of his father Fréa in <a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">T.A.</a> 2659, aged already 65. He was born during the rule of his grandfather <a href="/wiki/Aldor_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Aldor</a> the Old, and was 51 and a grandfather himself when Aldor died and the crown passed to his father. Fréawine ruled for 21 years until his death in 2680 when he died at 86. He was succeeded by his son, <a href="/wiki/Goldwine" id="w">Goldwine</a>.</li></ul>
<p />
<div id="Goldwine">

<ul>
<li><b>Goldwine</b>: The sixth King of <a href="/wiki/Rohan" id="w">Rohan</a>. Goldwine became King at the death of his father <a href="/wiki/Fr%C3%A9awine" id="w">Fréawine</a> in <a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">T.A.</a> 2680, when he was 61 years old. He was born during the rule of his great-grandfather <a href="/wiki/Aldor_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Aldor</a> the Old, and was aged 26, already a father, when Aldor finally died and the crown passed to his grandfather. Goldwine ruled during the &#34;Golden Age&#34; of Rohan and was very wealthy. During his rule the guard of Rohan&#39;s borders lessened, and the <a href="/wiki/Dunlendings" id="w">Dunlendings</a> which Aldor had driven out began to slowly return to northern Rohan. Goldwine died in 2699 after a rule of nineteen years. He was followed by his son <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A9or" id="w">Déor</a>.</li></ul>
<p />
<div id="Déor">

<ul>
<li><b>Déor</b>: The seventh King of <a href="/wiki/Rohan" id="w">Rohan</a>. He was born during the rule of his great-great-grandfather <a href="/wiki/Aldor_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Aldor</a> the Old, leading to an extraordinary situation of five generations living simultaneously in one house. He became King at the death of his father <a href="/wiki/Goldwine" id="w">Goldwine</a> in 2699 <a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">T.A.</a>  During Déor&#39;s realm the <a href="/wiki/Dunlendings" id="w">Dunlendings</a> began to cause trouble again; they had slowly returned to Rohan under Goldwine&#39;s reign, after Aldor had driven them out long before. Déor rode north to fight them, but he learned that the <a href="/wiki/Gondor" id="w">Gondorian</a> fortress of <a href="/wiki/Isengard" id="w">Isengard</a> had fallen under Dunlendish rule. Isengard was impregnable, so Déor had to accept for the time being a northern threat to his realm. Déor died in 2718 after a troublesome rule of nineteen years, and was followed by his son <a href="/wiki/Gram_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Gram</a>.</li></ul>

His reign was one of war with the <a href="/wiki/Dunlendings" id="w">Dunlendings</a>, who continued to raid Rohan from the fortress of <a href="/wiki/Isengard" id="w">Isengard</a> which they controlled. Gram died in 2741 after 23 years of open war, and was followed by his son <a href="/wiki/Helm_Hammerhand" id="w">Helm Hammerhand</a>.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Helm_Hammerhand" id="w">Helm Hammerhand</a></b>: The ninth King of <a href="/wiki/Rohan" id="w">Rohan</a> and last King of the first line. He became King at the death of his father <a href="/wiki/Gram_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Gram</a>, during a time of crisis. His father had already fought open warfare with the <a href="/wiki/Dunlendings" id="w">Dunlendings</a>, who operated from the captured fortress of <a href="/wiki/Isengard" id="w">Isengard</a>, and Helm died in a siege during a war with the Dulendings. Helm was succeeded by his nephew <a href="/wiki/Fr%C3%A9al%C3%A1f_Hildeson" id="w">Fréaláf Hildeson</a>, who became the first king of the second line.</li></ul>
<p />
<div id="Fréaláf">

<ul>
<li><b>Fréaláf Hildeson</b>: The tenth King of <a href="/wiki/Rohan" id="w">Rohan</a>, and the first King of the second line. Fréaláf was the nephew of <a href="/wiki/Helm_Hammerhand" id="w">Helm Hammerhand</a>. He became king after Helm was killed in the siege of the <a href="/wiki/Hornburg" id="w">Hornburg</a> in <a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">T.A.</a> 2759. Fréaláf led a daring raid that recaptured <a href="/wiki/Edoras" id="w">Edoras</a>, and managed to reclaim it. He eventually drove the <a href="/wiki/Dunlendings" id="w">Dunlendings</a> back across the rivers <a href="/wiki/Isen" id="w">Isen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Adorn" id="w">Adorn</a>, freeing all of Rohan. At his coronation the <a href="/wiki/Wizard_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Wizard</a> <a href="/wiki/Saruman" id="w">Saruman</a> suddenly appeared after years of absence.  Saruman offered Fréaláf his support and friendship. On Fréaláf&#39;s advice, <a href="/wiki/Beren_(Steward)" id="w">Beren</a> the <a href="/wiki/Steward_of_Gondor" id="w">Steward of Gondor</a> lent Saruman the keys to <a href="/wiki/Orthanc" id="w">Orthanc</a>, giving him <a href="/wiki/Isengard" id="w">Isengard</a> to dwell in on the condition that he must protect it from another conquest by the <a href="/wiki/Dunlendings" id="w">Dunlendings</a>. He ruled for 39 years, and was succeeded by his son <a href="/wiki/Brytta_L%C3%A9ofa" id="w">Brytta Léofa</a> at his death in 2798.</li></ul>
<p />
<div id="Brytta">

<ul>
<li><b>Brytta</b>: The eleventh King of <a href="/wiki/Rohan" id="w">Rohan</a>. Brytta was the son of <a href="/wiki/Fr%C3%A9al%C3%A1f_Hildeson" id="w">Fréaláf Hildeson</a>, and became king after the death of his father in (<a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">T.A.</a> 2798). During his reign Rohan was still recovering from the war with the <a href="/wiki/Dunlendings" id="w">Dunlendings</a>, and hostilities remained at the western borders. Brytta continued his father&#39;s habits of helping those in need, earning him the name <i>Léofa</i>, &#34;Beloved&#34;, in the Rohirric tongue. Aside from the troubles with the Dunlendings his rule saw a new trouble, as the <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Dwarves_and_Orcs" id="w">War of the Dwarves and Orcs</a> caused great numbers of <a href="/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Orcs</a> to flee from the <a href="/wiki/Misty_Mountains" id="w">Misty Mountains</a>, trying to make a home in the <a href="/wiki/White_Mountains_(Middle-earth)" id="w">White Mountains</a> south of Rohan. Brytta fought off these Orcs, and when he died it was believed Rohan was free of Orcs. He ruled for 44 years, and was succeeded by his son <a href="/wiki/Walda" id="w">Walda</a> at his death in T.A. 2842.</li></ul>
<p />
<div id="Walda">

Walda had served in his father&#39;s army fighting off the <a href="/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Orcs</a> which had attempted to invade Rohan during Brytta&#39;s reign, and at the time of his coronation it was believed Rohan had been freed of them. However, some Orcs remained, and in T.A. 2851 after ruling just nine years he was killed by an Orc in <a href="/wiki/Dunharrow" id="w">Dunharrow</a>.

He avenged his father by hunting down all the Orcs remaining in Rohan, and eventually managed to clear the lands. He earned the nickname <b>The Hunter</b> for his hunting prowess.

Fengel&#39;s two older brothers, Folcred and Fastred, were killed while fighting for <a href="/wiki/Gondor" id="w">Gondor</a>, and as a result Fengel grew up rather spoiled.

<li><b>Elfwine</b>: Called &#39;the Fair&#39;, was the nineteenth King of <a href="/wiki/Rohan" id="w">Rohan</a>. Elfwine was the first son of <a href="/wiki/Éomer" id="w">Éomer</a> Éadig (King of Rohan) and <a href="/wiki/Loth%C3%ADriel" id="w">Lothíriel</a>, (daughter of Prince <a href="/wiki/Imrahil" id="w">Imrahil</a> of <a href="/wiki/Dol_Amroth" id="w">Dol Amroth</a>). Through his mother, Elfwine was a first cousin once removed to Prince <a href="/wiki/Faramir" id="w">Faramir</a> of Ithilien, the <a href="/wiki/Steward_of_Gondor" id="w">Steward of Gondor</a>.  He succeeded his father as King after Éomer&#39;s death in the year <a href="/wiki/Fourth_Age" id="w">F.A.</a> 63, and ruled long after. As Elfwine ruled in the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_Age" id="w">Fourth Age</a>, after the <a href="/wiki/Red_Book_of_Westmarch" id="w">Red Book of Westmarch</a> had been written, little is known about him, but it can be speculated that as an ally of <a href="/wiki/Gondor" id="w">Gondor</a> his was a rule of peace in which the Rohirrim recovered from the <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Ring" id="w">War of the Ring</a>. &#34;Elfwine&#34; is a modernized rendering of <i><a href="/wiki/Ælfwine" id="w">Ælfwine</a></i>, an <a href="/wiki/Old_English" id="w">Old English</a> name meaning &#34;Elf-friend&#34;, representing an unknown authentic <a href="/wiki/Rohirric" id="w">Rohirric</a> name. Tolkien used Old English to represent the Rohirric language, including names. Thus Elfwine was never actually called &#34;Elfwine&#34;.</li></ul>
