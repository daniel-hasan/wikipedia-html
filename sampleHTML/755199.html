<p><b>David Ross Locke</b> (also known by his <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" id="w">pseudonym</a> <b>Petroleum V. Nasby</b>) (<a href="/wiki/September_20" id="w">September 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1833" id="w">1833</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/February_15" id="w">February 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1888" id="w">1888</a>) was an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Journalist" id="w">journalist</a> and early political commentator during the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>. </p>
<p>Locke&#39;s most famous work, the &#34;Nasby Letters,&#34; was written in the character of, and over the signature of &#34;Rev. Petroleum V(esuvius) Nasby&#34; a <a href="/wiki/Copperheads_(politics)" id="w">Copperhead</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party" id="w">Democrat</a>. They have been described as &#34;The Civil War written in sulphuric acid.&#34; </p>
<p>Locke was originally from Vestal, <a href="/wiki/Broome_County%2C_New_York" id="w">Broome County, New York</a>. He edited, and wrote for, the <a href="/wiki/Toledo%2C_Ohio" id="w">Toledo, Ohio</a> newspaper the <i><a href="/wiki/Toledo_Blade" id="w">Toledo Blade</a></i>. He was apprenticed at age 10 to the newspaper, the <i>Democrat</i> in <a href="/wiki/Cortland_County%2C_New_York" id="w">Cortland County, New York</a>. Following a seven-year apprenticeship, he tramped around until his next protracted stay being with the <i>Pittsburgh Chronicle.</i> Around 1855, Locke started, with others, the <a href="/wiki/Plymouth%2C_Ohio" id="w">Plymouth, Ohio</a> <i>Herald.</i> On <a href="/wiki/March_20" id="w">March 20</a> <a href="/wiki/1856" id="w">1856</a>, became the editor of the <i>Bucyrus Journal.</i> Locke was in <a href="/wiki/Bucyrus%2C_Ohio" id="w">Bucyrus</a>, when the Civil War broke out.</p>
<p>&#34;Nasby&#34; loudly championed the cause of the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" id="w">Confederate States of America</a> from <a href="/wiki/Secession" id="w">secession</a> onward, but did little to actively abet it. After being <a href="/wiki/Conscripted" id="w">conscripted</a> into the <a href="/wiki/Union_Army" id="w">Union Army</a> he deserted to the Confederates, joining the fictional &#34;Pelican Brigade.&#34;  However, he found life in the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_Army" id="w">Confederate Army</a> &#34;tite nippin&#34; and soon deserted again. By the end of the Civil War he was back in civilian life.</p>
<p>The &#34;Nasby Letters&#34;, written in the semi-literate spelling used by other humorists of the time, were intended to rally support for the Union cause, since &#34;Nasby&#34; himself was portrayed as a thoroughly detestable character - a supreme opportunist, bigoted, work-shy, often half-drunk, and willing to say or do anything to get a <a href="/wiki/Postmaster" id="w">Postmaster</a>&#39;s job. At the time the Letters were written, Postmasterships were political plums, offering a guaranteed federal salary for little or no real work. Until the glorious day when he received a &#34;Post Orfis&#34; from <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Johnson" id="w">Andrew Johnson</a> &#34;Nasby&#34; worked, when he worked, most frequently as a preacher. His favorite Biblical texts, unsurprisingly, were the ones that were used by Southern ministers to &#34;prove&#34; that <a href="/wiki/Slavery" id="w">slavery</a> was ordained by the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" id="w">Abraham Lincoln</a> loved the &#34;Nasby Letters,&#34; and quoted them frequently. He is quoted as saying, &#34;...I intend to tell him if he will communicate his talent to me, I will swap places with him!&#34; (<a class="externallink" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2517" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2517">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2517</a>).</p>
<p>After the Civil War, &#34;Nasby&#34; went on to comment on <a href="/wiki/Reconstruction" id="w">Reconstruction</a>. He settled in several different places, most notably &#34;Confedrit X Roads, which is in the Stait of Kentucky&#34;, a fictional town full of idle, whisky-loving, scrounging ex-Confederates, and a few hard-working, decent folk, who by an amazing coincidence were all strong Republicans. He travelled frequently, sometimes not entirely voluntarily (&#34;Nasby&#39;s&#34; habit of borrowing money he never repaid, and running up tabs at the local <a href="/wiki/Bar_(establishment)" id="w">saloon</a> often made him unpopular) and continued to comment on the issues of the day.  </p>
<p>Locke discontinued the &#34;Nasby Letters&#34; a few years before his death, since the times had changed and &#34;Nasby&#34; was no longer topical.  While the semi-literate spelling in which they are written has often discouraged modern readers, it can also be seen as a point of characterizing &#34;Nasby.&#34;</p>
<p>Several collections of the &#34;Letters&#34; came out in book form, some illustrated by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Nast" id="w">Thomas Nast</a>, who was a friend and political ally of Locke.  </p>
