<p>The <b>City of Dawson Creek</b> is a small city in northeastern <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" id="w">British Columbia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>. It covers an area of {{km2 to mi2}} with a 2006 population of 11,615 people.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Dubbed &#34;The Capital of the Peace&#34;, it is a service centre for the rural areas south of the <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_(Canada)" id="w">Peace River</a> and the seat of the <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_Regional_District%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Peace River Regional District</a>. Dawson Creek turned from a small farming community to a regional centre when the western terminus of the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Alberta_Railways" id="w">Northern Alberta Railways</a> was extended there in 1932, and the US Army used that terminus as a transshipment point in 1942 during the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Alaska_Highway" id="w">Alaska Highway</a>. Most of the city&#39;s development occurred between 1942 and 1966 when highways and railways were built connecting the farming area of the <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_Country" id="w">Peace River Country</a> to the rest of BC through Dawson Creek.</p>
<p>Dawson Creek derived its name from the creek of the same name that runs through the city. The creek was named after <a href="/wiki/George_Mercer_Dawson" id="w">George Mercer Dawson</a> by a member of his land survey team when they passed through the area in August 1879.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The city, at the southern end of the <a href="/wiki/Alaska_Highway" id="w">Alaska Highway</a>, is known as the &#34;Mile 0 City&#34; and is also home to a regional <a href="/wiki/Fair" id="w">fall fair</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heritage_interpretation" id="w">heritage interpretation village</a>.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>Dawson Creek was one of the farming communities established by European-Canadian settlers moving west through the <a href="/wiki/Peace_River_Country" id="w">Peace River Country</a>. When <a href="/wiki/Homesteading" id="w">homestead</a> grants began to be issued to settlers in 1912 by the Canadian government the pace of migration increased. With the opening of a few stores and hotels in 1919 and the incorporation of the Dawson Creek Co-operative Union on <a href="/wiki/28_May" id="w">28 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1921" id="w">1921</a>, Dawson Creek became a dominant business centre in the area.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>After much speculation by land owners and investors, the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Alberta_Railways" id="w">Northern Alberta Railways</a> built its terminus 3 <a href="/wiki/Kilometres" id="w">km</a> (2 <a href="/wiki/Mile" id="w">miles</a>) from the Dawson Creek.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The golden spike was driven on <a href="/wiki/29_December" id="w">29 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1930" id="w">1930</a>, and the first passenger train arrived on <a href="/wiki/15_January" id="w">15 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1931" id="w">1931</a>. The arrival of the railway and the construction of grain elevators attracted more settlers and business to the settlement. The need to provide services for the rapidly growing community allowed Dawson Creek to become incorporated as a village in 1936. In 1939, as <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> was beginning, refugees from the <a href="/wiki/Sudetenland" id="w">Sudetenland</a> arrived in the region and settled on land bought from the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Railway" id="w">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> and held in trust by the Canadian Colonization Association.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The community&#39;s population exceeded 500 people in 1941,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> but by 1943 the population numbered in the thousands. The village rapidly developed in 1942, as thousands of American army troops, engineers and contractors poured into the city—which had become the terminal of rail transport—to construct the <a href="/wiki/Alaska_Highway" id="w">Alaska Highway</a>.</p>
<p>The highway was completed in less than a year but throughout the following decade, with the workers long since gone, population and economic growth continued. In 1953, western Canada&#39;s largest propane gas plant was built<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> and federal government offices were established in town. In 1954 the <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia_Highway_97" id="w">John Hart Highway</a>, and an associated rail line, was opened which linked the town to the British Columbia <a href="/wiki/Cariboo" id="w">Interior</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lower_Mainland" id="w">Lower Mainland</a> through the Rocky Mountains. The village was re-incorporated as a city in 1958 as the population had more than tripled between 1951 and 1961.</p>

</p>
<p>Growth slowed in the 1960s with the population reaching its peak in 1966. In the 1970s, the provincial government moved its offices from <a href="/wiki/Pouce_Coupe%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Pouce Coupe</a> to the city, <a href="/wiki/Northern_Lights_College" id="w">Northern Lights College</a> opened a Dawson Creek campus, and the Dawson Creek Mall was constructed. Several modern <a href="/wiki/Grain_elevator" id="w">grain elevators</a> were built, and the town&#39;s five wooden grain elevators, nicknamed &#34;Elevator Row&#34;, were dismantled. Only one of the historic elevators remain today, converted to an art gallery. Since the 1970s, with the nearby town of <a href="/wiki/Fort_St._John%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Fort St. John</a> attracting much of the industrial development, and <a href="/wiki/Grande_Prairie%2C_Alberta" id="w">Grande Prairie</a> becoming a commercial hub, the town&#39;s population and economy have not significantly increased.</p>
<p>Since 1991, the city has undergone several boundary expansions. One expansion incorporated undeveloped land in the southeast around a proposed <a href="/wiki/Veneer_(wood)" id="w">veneer</a> factory by <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Pacific" id="w">Louisiana-Pacific</a> Canada. However, with the factory only half-built, the company abandoned its plans after the city extended sewer and water lines to the location. A business making manufactured homes bought the factory and completed its development in 2005.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Another expansion incorporated the existing <a href="/wiki/Louisiana-Pacific" id="w">Louisiana-Pacific Canada</a> <a href="/wiki/Oriented_strand_board" id="w">oriented strand board</a> factory in the northwest corner of town, while further incorporations have included undeveloped land south of the airport for potential commercial or industrial use and north of town for potential residential use.</p>

The 1941 census, the first to include Dawson Creek as a defined subdivision, counted 518 residents. The second census, in 1951, recorded a sevenfold increase to 3,589 residents, and within five years the population doubled to 7,531 residents.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The rapid growth occurred because the city was the <a href="/wiki/Transshipment" id="w">transshipment</a> point, the western rail terminus, for the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Alaska_Highway" id="w">Alaska Highway</a> and the farming communities afterwards. Growth continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s as another highway, this one to southern BC made the city a crossroads between British Columbia and Alberta. The population peaked in 1966 with 12,392 people and declined throughout the 1970s, rising again briefly during the construction of the nearby town of <a href="/wiki/Tumbler_Ridge%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Tumbler Ridge</a> in the early 1980s.

Dawson Creek had a smaller proportion of married couples than the province, 45% compared to 51%, but very similar persons per households. With 93% of Dawson Creek residents being Canadian-born, and 91% speaking only English, the city has few visible minorities. Only 12% of residents between 20 and 64 years of age completed university, half the provincial average, and 25% did not complete high school, much higher than the 19% provincial average.</p>

The city, located in the Cordillera Climatic Region, has a subhumid low boreal ecoclimate. In the summer the city is often dusty and dry. Heavy rain showers are sporadic, lasting only a few minutes.

<a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2>Economy</h2>
<p>The economy of Dawson Creek is based around four major industries: agriculture, retail, tourism, and oil and gas. Agriculture has historically been the most important industry to Dawson Creek, as the city is the regional <a href="/wiki/Transshipment" id="w">transshipment</a> point for agricultural commodities. The city is surrounded by the <a href="/wiki/Agricultural_Land_Reserve" id="w">Agricultural Land Reserve</a>, where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and grass crops, such as canola, hay, oats, alfalfa, wheat, and <a href="/wiki/Melilot" id="w">sweet clover</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> The service and retail sector caters to both the city&#39;s inhabitants, smaller nearby towns, and rural communities. However, significant <a href="/wiki/Leakage#Retail" id="w">retail leakage</a> occurs to <a href="/wiki/Grande_Prairie" id="w">Grande Prairie</a>, the closest major Alberta city, where the government does not charge <a href="/wiki/Sales_taxes_in_Canada" id="w">provincial taxes</a> on retail purchases, while B.C. charges 7%. In 2006 the provincial government rejected a proposal to lower the city&#39;s the provincial sales tax to 4%.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Big-box_store" id="w">large-format retail stores</a> into the small city.

Dawson Creek&#39;s road network was laid out in the mid-20th century as the town rapidly expanded. The city maintains 88&#160;km (55&#160;mi) of paved and 11&#160;km (7&#160;mi) of unpaved roads<sup id="_ref-redbook_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-redbook" title="">[23]</a></sup> in mostly a <a href="/wiki/Grid_plan" id="w">grid pattern</a> of large blocks of land connected to one another by only a few intersections, for example at a bridge or railway crossing. Because there are many internal intersections with stops signs in the grid pattern, traffic is forced onto two <a href="/wiki/Arterial_road" id="w">arterial roads</a>: 8 Street going north–south and Alaska Avenue going southeast–northwest. These two arterial roads meet at a traffic circle where a metal statue marks the beginning of the Alaska Highway. Highways emanating from Dawson Creek include <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia_Highway_2" id="w">Highway 2</a> (south to Grande Prairie and southern Alberta), <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia_Highway_49" id="w">Highway 49</a> (east to <a href="/wiki/Peace_River%2C_Alberta" id="w">Peace River</a> and northern Alberta), <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia_Highway_97" id="w">Highway 97</a> (southeast to <a href="/wiki/Chetwynd%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Chetwynd</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prince_George%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Prince George</a>) and Highway 97 (north to <a href="/wiki/Fort_St._John%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Fort St. John, British Columbia</a> and the Yukon). A road along the southern and western borders of the city, including Highway 2, with few intersections is designated as a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Dangerous_goods" id="w">dangerous goods</a> route&#34; for heavy trucks so that they can avoid traveling through the city. However, there is no route from Highway 49 so many still use city arterials, slowing traffic and damaging roads. </p>

<p>Dawson Creek is a regional node for air, rail and bus services. The <a href="/wiki/Dawson_Creek_Airport" id="w">Dawson Creek Airport</a>, which services commercial flights by <a href="/wiki/Central_Mountain_Air" id="w">Central Mountain Air</a>, was built in 1963 and had its 1,524&#160;m (5,000&#160;ft) runway paved in 1966. There are larger airports in Fort St. John and Grande Prairie that maintain a more comprehensive flight schedule than that available in Dawson Creek. Passenger rail service was available in Dawson Creek between 1931 and 1974. This passenger service began with the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Alberta_Railways" id="w">Northern Alberta Railways</a> building its northwest terminus in the town and was extended in 1958 to Vancouver with a rail line through the Rocky Mountains. Passenger rail service ended in 1974 as commodity shipments of grains, oil and gas by-products, and forestry products became more important in the resource-based economy. <a href="/wiki/Greyhound_Lines" id="w">Greyhound Bus lines</a> maintains a bus station in Dawson Creek which connects the city to Vancouver, <a href="/wiki/Edmonton%2C_Alberta" id="w">Edmonton</a> (via Grande Prairie) and <a href="/wiki/Whitehorse%2C_Yukon" id="w">Whitehorse</a> (via Fort Nelson).</p>
<p>The city draws its water supply from the Kiskatinaw River, 18&#160;km (11&#160;mi) west of town. Before reaching the city the water is pumped through a settling pond, two storage ponds, and a treatment plant where it is <a href="/wiki/Flocculate" id="w">flocculated</a>, filtered and <a href="/wiki/Chlorination" id="w">chlorinated</a>. The city also provides drinking water for Pouce Coupe and rural residents. Sewage is processed by a <a href="/wiki/Lagoon" id="w">lagoon</a> system east of town and released into the Pouce Coupe River.<sup id="_ref-watershed_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-watershed" title="">[21]</a></sup> Dawson Creek is located in <a href="/wiki/School_District_59_Peace_River_South" id="w">School District 59 Peace River South</a> which maintains five elementary schools (<a href="/wiki/Tremblay_Elementary_School" id="w">Tremblay</a>, <a href="/wiki/Parkhill_Elementary_School" id="w">Parkhill</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ecole_Frank_Ross_Elementary_School" id="w">Frank Ross</a>, <a href="/wiki/Crescent_Park_Elementary_School_(Dawson_Creek%2C_British_Columbia" id="w">Crescent Park</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Canalta_Elementary_School" id="w">Canalta</a> elementary schools), one middle school (Central Middle School) and one high school (<a href="/wiki/South_Peace_Secondary_School" id="w">South Peace Secondary School</a>).

The culture of Dawson Creek is centered around its designation as Mile &#39;0&#39; of the <a href="/wiki/Alaska_Highway" id="w">Alaska Highway</a>. The Mile &#39;0&#39; post, as depicted in the flag, is located in the historic downtown area, one block south of the Northern Alberta Railways Park. This four acre, mostly paved, park is the gathering point for travellers and the official beginning of the Alaska highway. The park also includes the Dawson Creek Art Gallery which exhibits works from local artists and craftsmen. The Station Museum, connected to the art gallery, displays artifacts and exhibits associated with the construction of NAR railway and the Alaska highway. Other parks in Dawson Creek include the Mile Zero Rotary Park and the Walter Wright Pioneer Village. Annual events in the city include the Dawson Creek Symphonette and Choir, the Dawson Creek Art Gallery auction, the Dawson Creek Spring Rodeo, and the Peace Country Blue Grass Festival.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> The largest event, held annually since 1953, is the Dawson Creek Fall Fair &#38; Exhibition which is a five-day professional rodeo, with a parade, fairgrounds and exhibitions.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>City recreation facilities include two ice hockey arenas, a curling rink, an indoor swimming pool, an outdoor ice rink, and a speed skating oval. The South Peace Community Multiplex,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> a new community facility under construction on the outskirts of the city, will replace the swimming pool. The project was controversial because a referendum on the Multiplex projected a cost of <a href="/wiki/Canadian_dollar" id="w">CAD</a>$21.6 million,<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> however once construction began it was projected to cost CAD$35 million.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> It will be located away from residential uses but close to the Exhibition Grounds and will feature an indoor <a href="/wiki/Rodeo" id="w">rodeo</a> arena, convention centre/ice arena seating 4000 complete with skyboxes. Nearby Bear Mountain, located south of the city, provides over 20&#160;km (12&#160;miles) of snowshoeing and cross-country skiing trails, as well as, areas for downhill skiing and about 500&#160;km (300&#160;miles) of trails for snowmobiles, mountain bikes and all-terrain vehicles.</p>
