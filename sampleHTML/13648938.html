The <b>Ballard Carnegie Library</b>, also known as the Seattle Public Library--Ballard Branch, is a historic library in the <a href="/wiki/Ballard%2C_Seattle%2C_Washington" id="w">Ballard</a> neighborhood in <a href="/wiki/Seattle%2C_Washington" id="w">Seattle, Washington</a>. The library was predated by a freeholders&#39; library in the <a href="/wiki/1860s" id="w">1860s</a>, which eventually gave way to a reading room that was organized and funded by a womens&#39; group in <a href="/wiki/1901" id="w">1901</a>. With a grant for $15,000, among other funds, a new library for the then independent City of Ballard was created as a <a href="/wiki/Carnegie_library" id="w">Carnegie library</a>. The building, located at 2026 N.W. Market Street in downtown Ballard, opened to the public on <a href="/wiki/June_24" id="w">June 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1904" id="w">1904</a>.<sup id="_ref-HistoryLink_3855_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistoryLink_3855" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-SeattlePI_030501_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SeattlePI_030501" title="">[2]</a></sup> Notable as the first major branch of the Seattle public library system, after Seattle annexed the City of Ballard into itself in <a href="/wiki/1907" id="w">1907</a>, and for employing one of the first African American librarians in Seattle, the Ballard Carnegie Library was in service until <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>, when a newer and more modern facility replaced it. After its sale, the old library building housed a variety of private commercial enterprises, including an antique shop, a restaurant and a <a href="/wiki/Kilt" id="w">kilt</a> manufacturer.<sup id="_ref-HistoryLink_3855_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistoryLink_3855" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-SeattlePI_030501_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SeattlePI_030501" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>After being nominated in <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a> for the recognition by Seattle <a href="/wiki/Architect" id="w">architect</a> Larry E. Johnson, it was listed on the <a href="/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places" id="w">National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP) in 1979 (ID #79002535).<sup id="_ref-PreservationSeattle_Carnegie1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PreservationSeattle_Carnegie1" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NROHP.com_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NROHP.com" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1860s, when Ballard was a new settlement along the edge of <a href="/wiki/Salmon_Bay" id="w">Salmon Bay</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Homesteader" id="w">homesteader</a> named Ira Wilcox Utter helped create a freeholders&#39; library.<sup id="_ref-HistoryLink_3878_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistoryLink_3878" title="">[5]</a></sup> Later, in 1901, the <a href="/wiki/Women%26%2339%3Bs_Christian_Temperance_Union" id="w">Women&#39;s Christian Temperance Union</a> of Ballard began raising money with fairs and socials for a new reading room on Ballard Avenue; it moved and expanded several times to different locations.<sup id="_ref-HistoryLink_3878_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistoryLink_3878" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-SEAGove_carnegie1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SEAGove_carnegie1" title="">[6]</a></sup> Having decided to build a proper library, the Ballard City Council established a library board in <a href="/wiki/1903" id="w">1903</a>  and the city applied to the <a href="/wiki/Philanthropist" id="w">philanthropist</a> <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie" id="w">Andrew Carnegie</a> for a library grant to help underwrite the costs of construction of a new library.<sup id="_ref-HistoryLink_3878_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistoryLink_3878" title="">[5]</a></sup> The library was built on a lot of {{convert}}, which was purchased for $2,100 raised by local businesses and citizens, supported by the earlier fundraising and book collections of the women&#39;s union, and a $15,000 grant from Carnegie.<sup id="_ref-HistoryLink_3878_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistoryLink_3878" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-HistoryLink_3855_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistoryLink_3855" title="">[1]</a></sup> When construction was completed, the building included features such as a 500-seat auditorium and a men&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Smoking_room" id="w">smoking room</a>, which was later converted into a reading room. Part of the construction work was executed by a <a href="/wiki/Chain_gang" id="w">chain gang</a>.<sup id="_ref-HistoryLink_3855_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistoryLink_3855" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Initially, the library had a cache of books waiting for the completion and grand opening that was provided by local residents and schools, as Carnegie&#39;s gift for the construction did not cover the initial costs of new books.<sup id="_ref-HistoryLink_3878_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistoryLink_3878" title="">[5]</a></sup> A call was also put out for citizens to donate books to the new facility to expand the collection. In 1907, the <a href="/wiki/Seattle_Public_Library" id="w">Seattle Public Library</a> took control of the Carnegie library, when Ballard was annexed by the neighboring City of Seattle government. Early <a href="/wiki/Scandinavian_people" id="w">Scandinavian</a> immigrants to Ballard and the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest" id="w">Pacific Northwest</a> in particular made use of the new facility; Ballard as an area has a strong historical presence of Scandanavian people.<sup id="_ref-SEAGove_carnegie1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SEAGove_carnegie1" title="">[6]</a></sup> Early in the library&#39;s existence, it had a <a href="/wiki/Turnstile" id="w">turnstile</a> at the entrance to its book stacks, to count the number of book borrowers that passed through.<sup id="_ref-LibraryJournal_10-1907_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LibraryJournal_10-1907" title="">[7]</a></sup> With the arrival of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, the Carnegie Library became home to various community activities, such as dispensing information on the war, and also provided <a href="/wiki/Red_Cross" id="w">Red Cross</a> and <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> language classes.
<sup id="_ref-HistoryLink_3878_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistoryLink_3878" title="">[5]</a></sup> In 1942, during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, one of the first <a href="/wiki/African_American" id="w">African American</a> librarians in Seattle, Lucille Smith, was assigned to the Carnegie library.<sup id="_ref-HistoryLink_3878_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistoryLink_3878" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1956, Seattle voters approved a <a href="/wiki/Municipal_bonds" id="w">municipal bond</a> to replace what was by then considered the &#34;inadequate and impractical&#34; library.<sup id="_ref-SeattlePI_123102_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SeattlePI_123102" title="">[8]</a></sup> The Ballard Carnegie Library eventually was shut in 1963, when a new, larger public library was built in the area, and the Carnegie building became an antique store.<sup id="_ref-HistoryLink_3855_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistoryLink_3855" title="">[1]</a></sup> One of the cited reasons for the closure and sale of the library building were expert claims that the building would never survive an earthquake (of which Seattle had numerous instances, both before and after 1963). The building has, in fact, survived several quakes since 1963.<sup id="_ref-SeattlePI_030501_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SeattlePI_030501" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
