Cubans in general were stunned but remembering the bloodshed of the 1930s, they were reluctant to fight. Batista created a consultative council integrated from pliable political personalities of all parties who appointed him President months before elections were to be held. Batista’s past democratic and pro-labor tendencies and the fear of another episode of bloody violence gained him tenuous support from the bankers, and the leader of the major labor confederation.</p>
