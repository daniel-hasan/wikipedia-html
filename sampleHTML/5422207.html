<p>A <b>mythical national championship</b> (often abbreviated <b>MNC</b>) is a national championship that is won without a tournament to determine an undisputed national champion.  This term is most often used in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> to describe the <a href="/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association" id="w">NCAA</a> Division I-A <a href="/wiki/College_football" id="w">college football</a> champion, however, it can also be used to describe champions in other sports as well.</p>

<p>In the case of Division I-A college football, the mythical national champion is a colloquial term for the top-finishing team in either the <a href="/wiki/AP_Poll" id="w">AP Poll</a>, a survey of sportswriters, or the <i><a href="/wiki/USA_Today" id="w">USA Today</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Coaches_Poll" id="w">Coaches Poll</a>, determined by Division I-A head coaches.</p>
<p>These two differing authorities have often led to conflicting claims to the championship (a split title or &#34;co-champions&#34;). The current <a href="/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series" id="w">Bowl Championship Series</a> system is an attempt to fix the perceived problem, by placing the number 1 and number 2 teams in a season-ending <a href="/wiki/Bowl_game" id="w">bowl game</a> to determine the champion. These teams are determined by the BCS ranking system, which itself uses a combination of human voter polls and computer rankings.  Currently the <a href="/wiki/Harris_Interactive_College_Football_Poll" id="w">Harris Interactive College Football Poll</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Coaches_Poll" id="w">Coaches Poll</a> are the major human-driven contributors to the poll. Following the game, the Coaches Poll is under contract to name the champion of the <a href="/wiki/BCS_National_Championship_Game" id="w">BCS National Championship Game</a> as its national champion.  However, the BCS is still not a tournament and has resulted in controversies and debates when more than two teams have legitimate reasons to be in the title game.  Three examples of this are in 2003, when USC did not play in the BCS title game but won the AP poll, in 2004 when Auburn went undefeated yet did not get to play in the title game of USC vs. Oklahoma, and in 2006 when one-loss Michigan and Florida both had claims to be in the title game against undefeated Ohio State.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Associated_Press" id="w">AP</a>, whose poll was officially part of the BCS until 2004, withdrew the poll from the BCS system after controversies about the rankings. The AP still ranks teams, although its results now have no direct influence on the BCS formula.</p>

<p>Because <a href="/wiki/High_school_football" id="w">high school football</a> in the United States is mostly a <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">state</a>-centered sport involving thousands of schools, it would be almost impossible to have a national championship play-off.  Some publications and internet sites release nationwide rankings based on polls or mathematical formulas which take into account various factors like average margin of victory and strength of schedule. Schools that finish atop these rankings, particularly the USA Today poll, are sometimes considered to be the Mythical National Champions.</p>

<p>Prior to 1939 the NCAA did not sanction a post-season <a href="/wiki/NCAA_Men%26%2339%3Bs_Division_I_Basketball_Championship" id="w">tournament</a> to determine a national champion.  Some schools claim basketball national championships based on polls from this era, the most notable being the <a href="/wiki/Helms_Athletic_Foundation" id="w">Helms Athletic Foundation</a>, which named its own champion from 1901 to 1982 (1901-1935 were retroactively awarded).  For example, the <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_basketball" id="w">University of North Carolina</a> claims the 1924 championship and <a href="/wiki/Purdue_Boilermakers" id="w">Purdue</a> claims the 1932 championship.  <a href="/wiki/LSU_Tigers_basketball" id="w">LSU</a> officially claims the 1935 championship awarded to them by winning the <b>American Legion Bowl National Championship</b> game against <a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh_Panthers" id="w">Pittsburgh</a>.</p>
