<p>The <b>Democratic Party</b> is one of two major <a href="/wiki/Political_party" id="w">political parties</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, the other being the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Republican Party</a>.

<p>Since the 2006 <a href="/wiki/United_States_general_elections%2C_2006" id="w">midterm elections</a> the Democratic Party is the <a href="/wiki/Two-party_system" id="w">majority party</a> for the <a href="/wiki/110th_United_States_Congress" id="w">110th</a> <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" id="w">Congress</a>; the party holds an outright majority in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Caucus_of_the_United_States_Senate" id="w">Democratic caucus</a> (including two <a href="/wiki/Independent_(politician)" id="w">independents</a>) constitutes a majority in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" id="w">United States Senate</a>.

<p>The Democratic Party traces its origins to the <a href="/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic-Republican Party</a>, founded by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" id="w">Thomas Jefferson</a>, <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" id="w">James Madison</a>, and other influential opponents of the <a href="/wiki/Federalist_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Federalists</a> in 1792. Since the division of the Republican Party in the election of <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1912" id="w">1912</a>, it has consistently positioned itself to the <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" id="w">left</a> of the Republican Party in economic as well as social matters.  The economically left-leaning activist philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" id="w">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, which has strongly influenced <a href="/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States" id="w">American liberalism</a>, has shaped much of the party&#39;s economic agenda since <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1932" id="w">1932</a>. Roosevelt&#39;s <a href="/wiki/New_Deal" id="w">New Deal</a> <a href="/wiki/New_Deal_coalition" id="w">coalition</a> usually controlled the national government until 1964. The <a href="/wiki/Civil_rights_movement" id="w">civil rights movement</a> of the 1960s, championed by the party despite opposition at the time from its Southern wing, has continued to inspire the party&#39;s liberal principles.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee" id="w">Democratic National Committee</a> (DNC) is responsible for promoting Democratic campaign activities. While the DNC is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the Democratic Platform, the DNC is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy.  In presidential elections it supervises the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention" id="w">Democratic National Convention</a>. The national convention is, subject to the charter of the party, the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when it is in session, with the DNC running the party&#39;s organization at other times. The DNC is currently chaired by former Vermont Governor <a href="/wiki/Howard_Dean" id="w">Howard Dean</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Congressional_Campaign_Committee" id="w">Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee</a> (DCCC) assists party candidates in House races; its current chairman (selected by the party caucus) is Rep. <a href="/wiki/Chris_Van_Hollen" id="w">Chris Van Hollen</a> of Maryland. Similarly the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Senatorial_Campaign_Committee" id="w">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee</a> (DSCC) raises large sums for Senate races. It is currently headed by Senator <a href="/wiki/Charles_E._Schumer" id="w">Charles E. Schumer</a> of New York. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), currently chaired by Mike Gronstal of Iowa, is a smaller organization with much less funding that focuses on state legislative races. The DNC sponsors the <a href="/wiki/College_Democrats_of_America" id="w">College Democrats of America</a> (CDA), a student-outreach organization with the goal of training and engaging a new generation of Democratic activists. <a href="/wiki/Democrats_Abroad" id="w">Democrats Abroad</a> is the organization for Americans living outside the United States; they work to advance the goals of the party and encourage Americans living abroad to support the Democrats. The <a href="/wiki/Young_Democrats_of_America" id="w">Young Democrats of America</a> (YDA) is a youth-led organization that attempts to draw in and mobilize young people for Democratic candidates, but operates outside of the DNC. In addition, the recently created branch of the Young Democrats, the Young Democrats High School Caucus, attempts to raise awareness and activism amongst teenagers to not only vote and volunteer, but participate in the future as well.The <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Governors_Association" id="w">Democratic Governors Association</a> (DGA) is an organization supporting the candidacies of Democratic gubernatorial nominees and incumbents; it is currently chaired by Governor <a href="/wiki/Kathleen_Sebelius" id="w">Kathleen Sebelius</a> of Kansas.</p>
<p>Each state also has a state committee, made up of elected committee members as well as ex-officio committee members (usually elected officials and representatives of major constituencies), which in turn elects a chair.  County, town, city and ward committees generally are comprised of individuals elected at the local level.  State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses, and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.  Rarely do they have much funding, but in 2005 DNC Chairman Dean began a program (called the &#34;50 State Strategy&#34;) of using DNC national funds to assist all state parties and paying for full time professional staffers.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Since the 1890s, the Democratic Party has favored &#34;<a href="/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States" id="w">liberal</a>&#34; positions (the term &#34;liberal&#34; in this sense describes <a href="/wiki/Social_liberalism" id="w">social liberalism</a>, not <a href="/wiki/Classical_liberalism" id="w">classical liberalism</a>).

In 2004, roughly 72 million (42.6 percent) Americans were registered Democrats, compared to 55 million (32.5 percent) Republicans and 42 million (24.8 percent) independents.<sup id="_ref-Neuhart, P.

<p>Historically, the party has favored farmers, laborers, labor unions, and religious and ethnic minorities; it has opposed unregulated business and finance, and favored progressive income taxes. In foreign policy, internationalism (including interventionism) was a dominant theme from 1913 to the mid 1960s. In the 1930s, the party began advocating welfare spending programs targeted at the poor. The party had a pro-business wing, typified by <a href="/wiki/Al_Smith" id="w">Al Smith</a>, that shrank in the 1930s. The <a href="/wiki/Southern_Democrats" id="w">Southern</a> conservative wing shrank in the 1980s. The major influences for liberalism were labor unions (which peaked in the 1936-1952 era), and the <a href="/wiki/African_American" id="w">African American</a> wing, which has steadily grown since the 1960s. Since the 1970s, <a href="/wiki/Environmentalism" id="w">environmentalism</a> has been a major new component.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the party has adopted a <a href="/wiki/Centrism" id="w">centrists</a> economic and more <a href="/wiki/Social_progressivism" id="w">socially progressive</a> agenda, with the voter base having shifted considerably. Once dominated by unionized labor and the <a href="/wiki/Working_class" id="w">working class</a>, the Democratic base now consists of <a href="/wiki/Social_liberalism" id="w">social liberals</a> who tend to be well-educated with above-average incomes as well as the socially more conservative working class. Today, Democrats advocate more social freedoms, <a href="/wiki/Affirmative_action" id="w">affirmative action</a>, <a href="/wiki/Balanced_budget" id="w">balanced budget</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" id="w">free enterprise</a> system tempered by <a href="/wiki/Government_intervention" id="w">government intervention</a> (<a href="/wiki/Mixed_economy" id="w">mixed economy</a>). The economic policy adopted by the modern Democratic Party, including the former <a href="/wiki/Clinton_administration" id="w">Clinton administration</a>, may also be referred to as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Third_Way_(centrism)" id="w">Third Way</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> The party believes that government should play a role in alleviating poverty and <a href="/wiki/Social_injustice" id="w">social injustice</a>, even if such requires a larger role for government and <a href="/wiki/Progressive_tax" id="w">progressive taxation</a>. </p>
<p>The Democratic Party, once dominant in the <a href="/wiki/Southeastern_United_States" id="w">Southeastern United States</a>, is now strongest in the Northeast (<a href="/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_States" id="w">Mid-Atlantic</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_England" id="w">New England</a>), <a href="/wiki/Great_Lakes_region_(North_America)" id="w">Great Lakes Region</a>, as well as along the <a href="/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States" id="w">Pacific Coast</a> (especially <a href="/wiki/Coastal_California" id="w">Coastal California</a>), including <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaii</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Social_liberalism" id="w">Social liberals</a>, also referred to as progressives or Modern liberals, constitute a large part, about 45.6 percent, of the Democratic voter base.

<a id="Civil_libertarians" name="Civil_libertarians"></a><h4>Civil libertarians</h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Civil_libertarian" id="w">Civil libertarians</a> also often support the Democratic Party because its positions on such issues as <a href="/wiki/Civil_rights" id="w">civil rights</a> and <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state" id="w">separation of church and state</a> are more closely aligned to their own than the positions of the Republican Party, and because the Democrats&#39; economic agenda may be more appealing to them than that of the <a href="/wiki/Libertarian_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Libertarian Party</a>.

<a id="Centrists" name="Centrists"></a><h4>Centrists</h4>
<p>Though <a href="/wiki/Centrism" id="w">centrist</a> Democrats differ on a variety of issues, they typically foster a mix of political views and ideas. Compared to other Democratic factions, they are mostly more supportive of the use of military force, including the war in Iraq, and are more willing to reduce government welfare, as indicated by their support for <a href="/wiki/Welfare_reform" id="w">welfare reform</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tax_cuts" id="w">tax cuts</a>. One of the most influential factions is the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Leadership_Council" id="w">Democratic Leadership Council</a> (DLC), a non-profit organization that advocates <a href="/wiki/Centrism" id="w">centrist</a> positions for the party. The DLC hails President <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" id="w">Bill Clinton</a> as proof of the viability of <a href="/wiki/Third_Way_(centrism)" id="w">third way</a> politicians and a DLC success story.

<a id="Professionals" name="Professionals"></a><h2>Professionals</h2>
<p>Professionals, those who have a college education and whose work revolves around the conceptualization of ideas, have supported the Democratic Party by a slight majority since 2000. Between 1988 and 2000, professionals favored Democrats by a 12 percentage point margin. While the professional class was once a stronghold of the Republican Party it has become increasingly split between the two parties, leaning in favor of the Democratic Party. The increasing support for Democratic candidates among professionals may be traced to the prevalence of social liberal values among this group.<sup id="_ref-Judis & Teixeira_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Judis & Teixeira" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>Since the 1930s, a critical component of the Democratic Party coalition has been <a href="/wiki/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States" id="w">organized labor</a>.  Labor unions supply a great deal of the money, grass roots political organization, and voting base of support for the party. The historic decline in union membership over the past half century has been accompanied by a growing disparity between public sector and private sector union membership percentages. The three most significant labor groupings in the Democratic coalition today are the <a href="/wiki/AFL-CIO" id="w">AFL-CIO</a> and <a href="/wiki/Change_to_Win_Federation" id="w">Change to Win</a> <a href="/wiki/National_trade_union_center" id="w">labor federations</a>, as well as the <a href="/wiki/National_Education_Association" id="w">National Education Association</a>, a large, unaffiliated <a href="/wiki/Teacher" id="w">teachers&#39;</a> union.

Most working class Democrats differ from most liberals, however, in their socially more conservative views. Working class tend to be more religious and likely to belong to an ethnic minority. Socially conservative and disadvantaged Democrats are among the least educated and lowest earning ideological demographics. In 2005, only 15% had a college degree, compared to 27% at the national average and 49% of liberals, respectively.

<a id="African_Americans" name="African_Americans"></a><h4>African Americans</h4>
<p>From the end of the Civil War, <a href="/wiki/African_American" id="w">African Americans</a> favored the Republican Party.

In addition recent <a href="/wiki/Carribean" id="w">Carribean</a> and <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">African</a> immigrants have voted solidly Democratic.</p>
<a id="Hispanics" name="Hispanics"></a><h4>Hispanics</h4>
<p>The Hispanic population, particularly the large <a href="/wiki/Mexican_American" id="w">Mexican American</a> population in the <a href="/wiki/Southwest_United_States" id="w">Southwest</a> and the large <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rican_American" id="w">Puerto Rican</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dominican_American" id="w">Dominican</a> populations in the <a href="/wiki/Northeast_United_States" id="w">Northeast</a>, have been strong supporters of the Democratic Party.

<a id="Asian_Americans" name="Asian_Americans"></a><h4>Asian Americans</h4>
<p>The Democratic Party also has considerable support in the small but growing <a href="/wiki/Asian_American" id="w">Asian American</a> population.

The Democratic party made gains among the Asian American population starting with 1996 and in 2006, won 62% of the Asian vote.

<a id="Minimum_wage" name="Minimum_wage"></a><h4>Minimum wage</h4>
<p>Democrats favor a higher <a href="/wiki/Minimum_wage" id="w">minimum wage</a>, and more regular increases, in order to assist the working poor. The <a href="/wiki/Fair_Minimum_Wage_Act_of_2007" id="w">Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007</a> was an early component of the Democrats&#39; agenda during the <a href="/wiki/110th_Congress" id="w">110th Congress</a>. In 2006, the Democrats supported six state ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage; all six initiatives passed.</p>
<a id="Renewable_energy_and_oil" name="Renewable_energy_and_oil"></a><h4>Renewable energy and oil</h4>
<p>Democrats have opposed tax cuts and incentives to oil companies, favoring a policy of developing domestic <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" id="w">renewable energy</a>. Democratic governors have led the way in this issue, such as <a href="/wiki/Montana" id="w">Montana&#39;s</a> state-supported wind farm and &#34;clean coal&#34; programs.</p>
<a id="Fiscal_policy" name="Fiscal_policy"></a><h4>Fiscal policy</h4>
<p>Democrats believe that their party is better able to achieve a <a href="/wiki/Balanced_budget" id="w">balanced budget</a>. Democrats increasingly call for generally higher taxes, mostly on the rich, and government spending that keeps the <a href="/wiki/Budget_deficit" id="w">budget deficit</a> under control. The Democratic-led House of Representatives reinstated the <a href="/wiki/PAYGO" id="w">PAYGO</a> (pay-as-you-go) budget rule at the start of the <a href="/wiki/110th_Congress" id="w">110th Congress</a>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> DNC Chairman <a href="/wiki/Howard_Dean" id="w">Howard Dean</a> has cited <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" id="w">Bill Clinton</a>&#39;s presidency as a model for fiscal responsibility.</p>
<a id="Health_care_and_insurance_coverage" name="Health_care_and_insurance_coverage"></a><h4>Health care and insurance coverage</h4>
<p>Democrats call for &#34;affordable and quality health care,&#34; and many advocate an expansion of government intervention in this area. Many Democrats favor a national health insurance system in a variety of forms to address the rising costs of modern health insurance. Some Democrats, such as Rep. <a href="/wiki/John_Dingell" id="w">John Dingell</a> and Senator <a href="/wiki/Edward_Kennedy" id="w">Edward Kennedy</a>, have called for a program of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)" id="w">Medicare</a> for All.&#34;<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some Democratic governors have supported purchasing <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canadian</a> drugs, citing lower costs and budget restrictions as a primary incentive.  Recognizing that unpaid insurance bills increase costs to the service provider, who passes the cost on to health-care consumers, many Democrats advocate expansion of health insurance coverage.</p>
<a id="Environment" name="Environment"></a><h4>Environment</h4>
<p>Democratic belief is that the health of families and the strength of the economy depend on stewardship of the environment. Democrats have promised to fight to strengthen the laws that ensure people have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. They also promise to make sure these laws are enforced. They feel that a sensible energy policy is key to a strong economy, national security, and a clean environment. <sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Democratic Party rejects the idea that a healthy economy and a healthy environment is mutually exclusive, because they believe that a cleaner environment means a stronger economy. They protect hunting and fishing heritage by expanding conservation lands.  They encourage open space and rail travel to relieve highway and airport congestion and improve air quality and economy. &#34;Democrats believe that communities, environmental interests, and government should work together to protect resources while ensuring the vitality of local economies. Once Americans were led to believe they had to make a choice between the economy and the environment. They now know this is a false choice.&#34;<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>The biggest environmental concern of the Democratic party is <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" id="w">global warming</a>. Democrats, most notably former Vice President <a href="/wiki/Al_Gore" id="w">Al Gore</a>, have pressed for stern regulation of <a href="/wiki/Greenhouse_gases" id="w">greenhouse gases</a>. On October 15, 2007 he won the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize" id="w">Nobel Peace Prize</a> for his efforts to build greater knowledge about manmade climate change, and laying the foundations for the measures needed to counteract these changes.

<a id="College_education" name="College_education"></a><h4>College education</h4>
<p>Most Democrats have the long term aim of having low-cost, publicly funded college education with low tuition fees (like in much of continental Europe) which should be available to every eligible American student, or alternatively, with increasing state funding for student financial aid such as the <a href="/wiki/Pell_grant" id="w">Pell grant</a> or college tuition tax-deduction.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>

The liberal and <a href="/wiki/Cosmopolitanism" id="w">cosmopolitan</a> wing of the party, including the intelligentsia and college-educated professionals overall tend to favor <a href="/wiki/Globalization" id="w">globalization</a>, while the organized labor wing of the party opposes it.<sup id="_ref-Rorty, R.

<p>While the Democratic Party is in support of a progressive tax structure, it has vowed to adjust the <a href="/wiki/Alternate_Minimum_Tax" id="w">Alternate Minimum Tax</a> (AMT). The tax was originally designed to tax the rich but now may affect many mass affluent households, especially those with <a href="/wiki/Income_in_the_United_States" id="w">incomes</a> between $75,000 to $100,000.

<p>The Democratic Party mostly supports <a href="/wiki/Affirmative_action" id="w">affirmative action</a> as a way to redress past discrimination and ensure equitable employment regardless of ethnicity or gender, but opposes the use of quotas in hiring.

<p>The Democratic Party is divided on the subject of <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage" id="w">same-sex marriage</a>. Some members favor <a href="/wiki/Civil_union" id="w">civil unions</a> for same-sex couples, liberals commonly favor legalized marriage, and others are opposed to same-sex marriage on religious grounds. The 2004 Democratic National Platform stated that marriage should be defined at the state level and it repudiated the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Marriage_Amendment" id="w">Federal Marriage Amendment</a>. Almost all agree, however, that discrimination against persons because of their sexual orientation is wrong, support <a href="/wiki/Adoption" id="w">adoption</a> rights for same sex couples, and also oppose the military&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Don%26%2339%3Bt_ask%2C_don%26%2339%3Bt_tell" id="w">Don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell</a>&#34; policy.</p>
<a id="Reproductive_rights" name="Reproductive_rights"></a><h4>Reproductive rights</h4>
<p>Most members of the Democratic Party believe that all women should have access to <a href="/wiki/Birth_control" id="w">birth control</a>, and supports public funding of contraception for poor women. The Democratic Party, in its national platforms since 1992, has called for <a href="/wiki/Abortion" id="w">abortion</a> to be &#34;safe, legal and rare&#34;—namely, keeping it legal by rejecting laws that allow governmental interference in abortion decisions, and reducing the number of abortions by promoting both knowledge of reproduction and contraception, and incentives for adoption. When Congress voted on the <a href="/wiki/Partial-Birth_Abortion_Ban_Act" id="w">Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act</a> in 2003, Congressional Democrats were split, with a minority—including current Senate <a href="/wiki/Majority_Leader" id="w">Majority Leader</a> <a href="/wiki/Harry_Reid" id="w">Harry Reid</a>—supporting the ban, and the majority of Democrats opposing the legislation.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party opposes attempts to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision <i><a href="/wiki/Roe_v._Wade" id="w">Roe v. Wade</a></i>, which declared abortion to be a Constitutionally-protected right, and <i><a href="/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey" id="w">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a></i> which lays out the legal framework in which government action alleged to violate that right is assessed by courts.  As a matter of the <a href="/wiki/Privacy" id="w">right to privacy</a> and of <a href="/wiki/Feminism" id="w">gender equality</a>, many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference. They believe that each woman, conferring with her conscience, has the right to choose for herself whether abortion is morally correct. Many Democrats also believe that poor women should have a right to publicly funded abortions.</p>
<a id="Stem_cell_research" name="Stem_cell_research"></a><h4>Stem cell research</h4>
<p>The Democratic Party has voiced overwhelming support for all <a href="/wiki/Stem_cell_research" id="w">stem cell research</a> with federal funding. In his 2004 platform, <a href="/wiki/John_Kerry" id="w">John Kerry</a> affirmed his support of federally funded stem-cell research &#34;under the strictest ethical guidelines.&#34; He explained, &#34;We will not walk away from the chance to save lives and reduce human suffering.&#34;</p>
<a id="Foreign_policy_issues" name="Foreign_policy_issues"></a><h2>Foreign policy issues</h2>
<a id="Invasion_of_Afghanistan" name="Invasion_of_Afghanistan"></a><h4>Invasion of Afghanistan</h4>
<p>Democrats in the House of Representatives and United States Senate near-unanimously voted for the <a href="/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force" id="w">authorization of military force</a> against &#34;those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a> in 2001, supporting the <a href="/wiki/NATO" id="w">NATO</a> coalition invasion of the nation. Most elected Democrats continue in their support of the Afghanistan conflict, and some have voiced concerns that the Iraq War is shifting too many resources away from the presence in Afghanistan.</p>
<a id="Iraq_War" name="Iraq_War"></a><h4>Iraq War</h4>
<p>In 2002, Democrats were divided as a majority (29 for, 21 against) in the Senate voted for the <a href="/wiki/Iraq_Resolution" id="w">authorization of the use of force against Iraq</a> while a minority of Democrats in the House (81 for, 126 against) voted against it. Since then, many prominent Democrats have expressed regret about this decision, such as former Senator <a href="/wiki/John_Edwards" id="w">John Edwards</a>, and have called it a mistake, while others, such as Senator <a href="/wiki/Hillary_Clinton" id="w">Hillary Clinton</a> have criticized the conduct of the war but not repudiated their initial vote for it. Amongst lawmakers, Democrats are the most vocal critics of the <a href="/wiki/Iraq_War" id="w">Iraq War</a> and the President&#39;s management of the war. Democrats in the House of Representatives near-unanimously supported a <a href="/wiki/Non-binding_resolution" id="w">non-binding resolution</a> disapproving of President Bush&#39;s decision to send <a href="/wiki/Iraq_War_troop_surge_of_2007" id="w">additional troops into Iraq in 2007</a>. Congressional Democrats overwhelmingly supported military funding legislation which included a provision that set &#34;a timeline for the withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq&#34; by <a href="/wiki/March_31" id="w">March 31</a> <a href="/wiki/2008" id="w">2008</a>, but also would leave combat forces in Iraq for purposes such as targeted counter-terrorism operations.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> After a veto from the president, and a failed attempt in Congress to override the veto,<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Troop_Readiness%2C_Veterans%26%2339%3B_Care%2C_Katrina_Recovery%2C_and_Iraq_Accountability_Appropriations_Act%2C_2007" id="w">U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans&#39; Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007</a> was passed by Congress and signed by the president after the timetable was dropped.</p>
<a id="Unilateralism" name="Unilateralism"></a><h4>Unilateralism</h4>
<p>Democrats usually oppose the doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Unilateralism" id="w">unilateralism</a>, which dictates that the United States should use military force without any assistance from other nations whenever it believes there is a threat to its security or welfare. They believe the United States should act in the international arena in concert with strong alliances and broad international support. This was a major foreign policy issue of <a href="/wiki/John_Kerry" id="w">John Kerry</a>&#39;s 2004 presidential campaign; his platform attributed rifts with international allies to unilateralism.</p>
<p>In a general sense, the modern Democratic Party is more closely aligned with the <a href="/wiki/International_relations_theory" id="w">international relations theories</a> of <a href="/wiki/Liberal_international_relations_theory" id="w">liberalism</a>,  <a href="/wiki/Neoliberalism_in_international_relations" id="w">neoliberalism</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Functionalism_in_international_relations" id="w">functionalism</a> than <a href="/wiki/Realism_(international_relations)" id="w">realism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neorealism" id="w">neorealism</a>, though realism has some influence on the party.</p>
<a id="Legal_issues" name="Legal_issues"></a><h2>Legal issues</h2>
<a id="Torture" name="Torture"></a><h4>Torture</h4>
<p>Democrats are opposed to use of <a href="/wiki/Torture" id="w">torture</a> against individuals apprehended and held prisoner by the military of the United States, and deny that categorizing military prisoners as <a href="/wiki/Unlawful_combatants" id="w">unlawful combatants</a> excludes them from the rights granted under the <a href="/wiki/Geneva_Conventions" id="w">Geneva Conventions</a>. Democrats contend that torture is inhumane, decreases the United States&#39; moral standing in the world, and produces questionable results.</p>
<a id="USA_PATRIOT_Act" name="USA_PATRIOT_Act"></a><h4>USA PATRIOT Act</h4>
<p>All Democrats in the U.S. Senate except for <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin" id="w">Wisconsin</a> Senator <a href="/wiki/Russ_Feingold" id="w">Russ Feingold</a> voted for the original <a href="/wiki/USA_PATRIOT_Act" id="w">USA PATRIOT Act</a> legislation. After voicing concerns over the &#34;invasion of privacy&#34; and other <a href="/wiki/Civil_liberties" id="w">civil liberty</a> restrictions of the Act, the Democrats split on the renewal in 2006. Most Democratic Senators voted to renew it, while most Democratic Representatives voted against renewal. Renewal was allowed after many of the most invasive clauses in the Act were removed or curbed.</p>
<a id="Right_to_privacy" name="Right_to_privacy"></a><h4>Right to privacy</h4>
<p>The Democratic Party believes that individuals should have a <a href="/wiki/Right_to_privacy" id="w">right to privacy</a>, and generally supports laws which place restrictions on law-enforcement and intelligence agency monitoring of U.S. citizens. Some Democratic Party officeholders have championed consumer-protection laws that limit the sharing of consumer data between corporations. Most Democrats believe that government should not regulate consensual non-commercial sexual conduct (among adults), as a matter of personal privacy.</p>
<a id="Crime" name="Crime"></a><h4>Crime</h4>
<p>Democrats often focus on methods of crime prevention, believing that preventive measures save taxpayers&#39; money in prison, policing and medical costs, and prevent crime and murder. They emphasize improved community policing and more on-duty police officers in order to help accomplish this goal. The party&#39;s platform in 2000 and 2004 cited crackdowns on <a href="/wiki/Gang" id="w">gangs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade" id="w">drug trafficking</a> as preventive methods. The party&#39;s platforms have also addressed the issue of domestic violence, calling for strict penalties for offenders and protection for victims.</p>
<a id="Gun_control" name="Gun_control"></a><h4>Gun control</h4>
<p>With a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various <a href="/wiki/Gun_politics" id="w">gun control</a> measures, most notably the <a href="/wiki/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968" id="w">Gun Control Act of 1968</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act" id="w">Brady Bill</a> of 1993 and Crime Control Act of 1994.  However, many Democrats, especially rural, Southern, and Western Democrats, favor fewer restrictions on firearm possession and warned the party was defeated in the 2000 presidential election in rural areas because of the issue.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> In the national platform for 2004, the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 <a href="/wiki/Federal_assault_weapons_ban" id="w">Assault Weapons Ban</a>.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The Democratic Party evolved from <a href="/wiki/Anti-federalist" id="w">Anti-federalist</a> factions that opposed the <a href="/wiki/Hamiltonian_economic_program" id="w">fiscal policies</a> of <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton" id="w">Alexander Hamilton</a> in the early 1790s. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" id="w">Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" id="w">James Madison</a> organized these factions into the <a href="/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic-Republican Party</a>. The party favored states&#39; rights and strict adherence to the Constitution; it opposed a national bank and wealthy, moneyed interests. The Democratic-Republican Party ascended to power in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1800" id="w">election of 1800</a>. After the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" id="w">War of 1812</a>, the party&#39;s chief rival, the <a href="/wiki/Federalist_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Federalist Party</a>, disbanded. The party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" id="w">Andrew Jackson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren" id="w">Martin Van Buren</a>, became the Democratic Party.  Along with the <a href="/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Whig Party</a>, the Democratic Party was the chief party in the United States until the Civil War. The Whigs were a commercial party, and usually less popular, if better financed.  The Whigs divided over slavery after the Mexican war and faded away; Jackson had always attempted a neutral policy towards slavery. In the 1850&#39;s, under the stress of the <a href="/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Law" id="w">Fugitive Slave Law</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Kansas-Nebraska_Act" id="w">Kansas-Nebraska Act</a>, this became impossible, and the anti-slavery Democrats left the Party.  </p>
<p>The Democrats split over the choice of a successor to President <a href="/wiki/James_Buchanan" id="w">James Buchanan</a> along Northern and Southern lines, while the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Republican Party</a> gained an ascendancy in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1860" id="w">election of 1860</a>. As the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a> broke out, Northern Democrats were divided into <a href="/wiki/War_Democrats" id="w">War Democrats</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peace_Democrats" id="w">Peace Democrats</a>. Most War Democrats rallied to President <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" id="w">Abraham Lincoln</a> and the Republicans&#39; <a href="/wiki/National_Union_Party_(United_States)" id="w">National Union Party</a>. The Democrats benefited from white Southerners&#39; resentment of <a href="/wiki/Reconstruction" id="w">Reconstruction</a> after the war and consequent hostility to the Republican Party. After <a href="/wiki/Redeemers" id="w">Redeemers</a> ended Reconstruction in the 1870s, and the extremely violent disenfranchisement of African Americans took place in the 1890s, the South, voting Democratic, became known as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Solid_South" id="w">Solid South</a>.&#34; Though Republicans continued to control the White House until 1884, the Democrats remained competitive. The party was dominated by pro-business <a href="/wiki/Bourbon_Democrats" id="w">Bourbon Democrats</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Samuel_J._Tilden" id="w">Samuel J. Tilden</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grover_Cleveland" id="w">Grover Cleveland</a>, who represented mercantile, banking and railroad interests, opposed imperialism and overseas expansion, fought for the gold standard, opposed bimetallism, and crusaded against corruption, high taxes, and tariffs. Cleveland was elected to non-consecutive presidential terms in 1884 and 1892.</p>
<p>Agrarian Democrats demanding <a href="/wiki/Free_silver" id="w">free silver</a> overthrew the Bourbon Democrats in 1896 and nominated <a href="/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan" id="w">William Jennings Bryan</a> for the presidency (a nomination repeated by Democrats in 1900 and 1908). Bryan waged a vigorous campaign attacking Eastern moneyed interests, but he lost to Republican <a href="/wiki/William_McKinley" id="w">William McKinley</a>. The Democrats took control of the House in 1910 and elected <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" id="w">Woodrow Wilson</a> as president in 1912 and 1916. Wilson led Congress to, in effect, put to rest the issues of tariffs, money, and antitrust that had dominated politics for 40 years with new progressive laws. The <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a> in 1929 that occurred under Republican President <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Hoover" id="w">Herbert Hoover</a> and the Republican Congress set the stage for a more liberal government; the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives nearly uninterrupted from 1931 until 1995 and won most presidential elections until 1968. <a href="/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt" id="w">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>, elected to presidency in 1932, came forth with government programs called the <a href="/wiki/New_Deal" id="w">New Deal</a>. New Deal liberalism meant the promotion of social welfare, labor unions, civil rights, and regulation of business. The opponents, who stressed long-term growth, support for business, and low taxes, started calling themselves &#34;conservatives.&#34; </p>
<p>Issues facing parties and the United States after the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a> included the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement" id="w">Civil Rights Movement</a>. Republicans attracted conservatives and white Southerners from the Democratic coalition with their resistance to New Deal and <a href="/wiki/Great_Society" id="w">Great Society</a> liberalism and the Republicans&#39; use of the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Strategy" id="w">Southern Strategy</a>. African Americans, who traditionally supported the Republican Party, began supporting Democrats following the ascent of the Franklin Roosevelt administration, the New Deal, and the Civil Rights movement. The Democratic Party&#39;s main base of support shifted to the <a href="/wiki/Northeastern_United_States" id="w">Northeast</a>, marking a dramatic reversal of history. <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" id="w">Bill Clinton</a> was elected to the presidency in 1992 and 1996 and governed as a <a href="/wiki/New_Democrat" id="w">New Democrat</a> while the Democratic Party lost control of Congress in the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Revolution" id="w">election of 1994</a> to the Republican Party; the Democratic Party <a href="/wiki/United_States_general_elections%2C_2006" id="w">regained majority control of Congress in 2006</a>. Some of the party&#39;s key issues in the early 21st century have included the methods of how to combat terrorism, homeland security, labor rights, environmentalism, and the preservation of liberal government programs.</p>

Initially calling itself the &#34;Republican Party,&#34; Jeffersonians were labeled &#34;Democratic&#34; by the opposition <a href="/wiki/Federalist_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Federalists</a>, with the hope of stigmatizing them as purveyors of democracy or mob rule.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> By the Jacksonian era, the term &#34;The Democracy&#34; was in use by the party; the name &#34;Democratic Party&#34; was eventually settled upon.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> In the 20th and 21st centuries, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Democrat_Party_(phrase)" id="w">Democrat Party</a>&#34; is a political <a href="/wiki/Epithet" id="w">epithet</a> that is sometimes used by opponents to refer to the party. The current official name of the party is the &#34;Democratic Party.&#34;</p>
<p>The most common symbol for the party is the <a href="/wiki/Donkey" id="w">donkey</a>, although the party itself never officially adopted this symbol.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> The origins of this symbol are unknown, but several theories have been proposed. According to one theory, in its original form, the jackass was born in the intense mudslinging that occurred during the presidential race of <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_1828" id="w">1828</a> in which <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" id="w">Andrew Jackson</a> was sometimes called a jackass by his opponents. A <a href="/wiki/Political_cartoon" id="w">political cartoon</a> depicting Jackson riding and directing a donkey (representing the Democratic Party) was published in 1837. A political cartoon by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Nast" id="w">Thomas Nast</a> in an 1870 edition of <i><a href="/wiki/Harper%26%2339%3Bs_Magazine" id="w">Harper&#39;s Weekly</a></i> revived the donkey as a symbol for the Democratic Party. Cartoonists followed Nast and used the donkey to represent the Democrats, and the elephant to represent the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Republicans</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, the traditional symbol of the Democratic Party in <a href="/wiki/Midwest" id="w">Midwestern states</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Indiana" id="w">Indiana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" id="w">Kentucky</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oklahoma" id="w">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ohio" id="w">Ohio</a> was the <a href="/wiki/Rooster" id="w">rooster</a>, as opposed to the Republican <a href="/wiki/Eagle" id="w">eagle</a>. This symbol still appears on Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Indiana <a href="/wiki/Ballot" id="w">ballots</a>. For the majority of the 20th century, <a href="/wiki/Missouri" id="w">Missouri</a> Democrats used the <a href="/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty" id="w">Statue of Liberty</a> as their ballot <a href="/wiki/Emblem" id="w">emblem</a>. This meant that when <a href="/wiki/United_States_Libertarian_Party" id="w">Libertarian</a> candidates received <a href="/wiki/Ballot_access" id="w">ballot access</a> in Missouri in 1976, they could not use the Statue of Liberty, their national symbol, as the ballot emblem. Missouri Libertarians instead used the <a href="/wiki/Liberty_Bell" id="w">Liberty Bell</a> until 1995, when the <a href="/wiki/Mule" id="w">mule</a> became Missouri&#39;s state animal. From 1995 to 2004, there was some confusion among voters, as the Democratic ticket was marked with the Statue of Liberty, and it seemed that the Libertarians were using a donkey.</p>
<p>Although both major political parties (and many minor ones) use the traditional American red, white, and blue colors in their marketing and representations, since election night <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election%2C_2000" id="w">2000</a> the color blue has become the identified color of the Democratic Party, while the color red has become the identified color of the opposition Republican Party. That night, for the first time, all major broadcast television networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: <a href="/wiki/Blue_states" id="w">blue states</a> for <a href="/wiki/Al_Gore" id="w">Al Gore</a> (Democratic nominee) and red states for <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">George W.

Since then, the color blue has been widely used by the media to represent the party, much to the confusion of non-American observers, as blue is the traditional color of the <a href="/wiki/Right-wing_politics" id="w">right</a> and red the color of the <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" id="w">left</a> outside of the United States (c.f. red for the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Liberals</a> and blue for the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Conservatives</a> in <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, or red for <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" id="w">Labour</a> and blue for <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)" id="w">Conservative</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>). Blue has also been used by party supporters for promotional efforts (e.g BuyBlue, BlueFund) and by the party itself, which in 2006 unveiled the &#34;Red to Blue Program&#34; to support Democratic candidates running against Republican incumbents in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_general_elections%2C_2006" id="w">2006 midterm elections</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jefferson-Jackson_Day" id="w">Jefferson-Jackson Day</a> is the most common name given to the annual fundraising celebration held by local chapters of the Democratic Party. It is named after Presidents <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" id="w">Thomas Jefferson</a> and Andrew Jackson, whom the party regards as its distinguished early leaders.</p>
<p>The song &#34;<a href="/wiki/Happy_Days_Are_Here_Again" id="w">Happy Days Are Here Again</a>&#34; is the unofficial song of the Democratic Party. It was used prominently when <a href="/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt" id="w">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> was nominated for president at the <a href="/wiki/1932_Democratic_National_Convention" id="w">1932 Democratic National Convention</a> and remains a sentimental favorite for Democrats today. More recently, the emotionally similar song &#34;<a href="/wiki/Beautiful_Day" id="w">Beautiful Day</a>&#34; by the band <a href="/wiki/U2" id="w">U2</a> has become a favorite theme song for Democratic candidates. <a href="/wiki/John_Kerry" id="w">John Kerry</a> used the song during his 2004 presidential campaign, and it was used as a celebratory tune by several Democratic Congressional candidates in 2006.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
