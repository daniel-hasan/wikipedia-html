Nine cities submitting <b>bids to host the <a href="/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics" id="w">2012 Summer Olympics</a></b>{{Ref_label}} were recognised by the <a href="/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee" id="w">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC). The Committee shortlisted five of them—<a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/Madrid" id="w">Madrid</a>, <a href="/wiki/Moscow" id="w">Moscow</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>—from which London eventually prevailed; it will become the first city to host the <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Games" id="w">Olympic Games</a> for <a href="/wiki/London_Olympics" id="w">a third time</a>.<sup id="_ref-CNN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN" title="">[1]</a></sup> The bidding process for the 2012 Olympics was considered one of the most hotly contested in the history of the IOC.<sup id="_ref-MSNBC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MSNBC" title="">[2]</a></sup> Paris was seen as the front-runner for most of the campaign,<sup id="_ref-BBC frontrunner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC frontrunner" title="">[3]</a></sup> but last-minute lobbying by London&#39;s supporters was one factor that led to the success of its bid.<sup id="_ref-CNN_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CNN" title="">[1]</a></sup> Madrid was regarded as one of the favourites, but the city did not receive enough votes to surpass Paris and London.<sup id="_ref-Spain_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spain" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>After a technical evaluation of the nine original bids, the top five were shortlisted on <a href="/wiki/May_18" id="w">May 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, becoming official candidates. The remaining applicant cities—<a href="/wiki/Havana" id="w">Havana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" id="w">Istanbul</a>, <a href="/wiki/Leipzig" id="w">Leipzig</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" id="w">Rio de Janeiro</a>—were eliminated.<sup id="_ref-IOC2012election_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IOC2012election" title="">[5]</a></sup> Four of the five candidate cities were highly recognised national capitals, which lent an increased competitive interest to the final bidding phase. Paris and Madrid earned the top scores during the application phase, but in early 2005, a more thorough evaluation of the candidates put Paris and London in a close race that became tighter as the final vote approached. On <a href="/wiki/July_6" id="w">July 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, in a four-round <a href="/wiki/Exhaustive_ballot" id="w">exhaustive ballot</a> of the IOC (gathered at the <a href="/wiki/117th_IOC_Session" id="w">117th IOC Session</a> in <a href="/wiki/Singapore" id="w">Singapore</a>),  Moscow, New York City, and Madrid were eliminated in the first three rounds. London won the final round by a margin of four votes over Paris and secured the right to host the 2012 Olympics.</p>
<p>In the month after the election, members of the Paris 2012 delegation argued that the London delegation had violated IOC rules. The key points in the accusations were London 2012&#39;s abortive athlete incentive initiative and lobbying by then-British Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair" id="w">Tony Blair</a>.<sup id="_ref-wrongf_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wrongf" title="">[6]</a></sup> A public statement by IOC President <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Rogge" id="w">Jacques Rogge</a> dismissed these accusations, stating that the competition had been fair.<sup id="_ref-wrongg_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wrongg" title="">[7]</a></sup> Another controversy occurred during the bidding process when an undercover investigation by British television series <i><a href="/wiki/Panorama_(TV_series)" id="w">Panorama</a></i> revealed a corruption scandal associated with IOC member <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Slavkov" id="w">Ivan Slavkov</a> and Olympic agents, who offered to deliver votes from IOC members to any 2012 Olympic bid in return for financial favours.<sup id="_ref-BBC BuyingGames_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC BuyingGames" title="">[8]</a></sup> Still recovering from the effects of the <a href="/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal" id="w">Salt Lake City scandal</a>, the IOC reacted swiftly and punitively toward the rule-breaking individuals.<sup id="_ref-Slavkov expelled_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Slavkov expelled" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Bidding_process" name="Bidding_process"></a><h1>Bidding process</h1>
<p>The Olympic bidding process begins with the submission of a city&#39;s application to the <a href="/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee" id="w">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC) by its <a href="/wiki/National_Olympic_Committee" id="w">National Olympic Committee</a> (NOC) and ends with the election of the host city by the members of the IOC during an ordinary session. The process is governed by the <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Charter" id="w">Olympic Charter</a>, as stated in Chapter 5, Rule 34.<sup id="_ref-Charter_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Charter" title="">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Since 1999, the process has consisted of two phases. During the first phase, which begins immediately after the bid submission deadline, the &#34;applicant cities&#34; are required to answer a questionnaire covering themes of importance to a successful Games organisation. This information allows the IOC to analyse the cities&#39; hosting capacities and the strengths and weaknesses of their plans. Following a detailed study of the submitted questionnaires and ensuing reports, the IOC Executive Board selects the cities that are qualified to proceed to the next phase. The second phase is the true candidature stage: the accepted applicant cities (from now on referred to as &#34;candidate cities&#34;) are required to submit a second questionnaire in the form of an extended, more detailed, candidature file.<sup id="_ref-CityElectionProc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CityElectionProc" title="">[11]</a></sup> These files are carefully studied by the IOC Evaluation Commission, a group composed of IOC members, representatives of <a href="/wiki/List_of_international_sport_federations" id="w">international sport federations</a>, NOCs, athletes, the <a href="/wiki/International_Paralympic_Committee" id="w">International Paralympic Committee</a>, and international experts in various fields.<sup id="_ref-EvalCommis_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EvalCommis" title="">[12]</a></sup> The members of the Evaluation Commission then make four-day inspection visits to each of the candidate cities, where they check the proposed venues and are briefed about details of  the themes covered in the candidature file. The Evaluation Commission communicates the results of its inspections in a report sent to the IOC members up to one month before the electing IOC Session.<sup id="_ref-CityElectionProc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CityElectionProc" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The IOC Session in which a host city is elected takes place in a country that did not submit an application to stage the Olympics.<sup id="_ref-CityElectionProc_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CityElectionProc" title="">[11]</a></sup> The election is made by the assembled active IOC members (excluding honorary and honour members), each possessing one vote. Members from countries that have a city taking part in the election cannot vote while the city is in the running. The voting is conducted in a succession of rounds until one bid achieves an <a href="/wiki/Absolute_majority" id="w">absolute majority</a> of votes; if this does not happen in the first round, the bid with the fewest votes is eliminated and another voting round begins. In the case of a tie for the lowest number of votes, a special runoff vote is carried out, with the winner proceeding to the next round. After each round, the eliminated bid is announced.<sup id="_ref-ElectionProc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ElectionProc" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-SingElectionProc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SingElectionProc" title="">[14]</a></sup> Following the announcement of the host city, the successful bid delegation signs the &#34;Host City Contract&#34; with the IOC, which delegates the responsibilities of the Games organisation to the city and respective NOC.<sup id="_ref-HostCityContract_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HostCityContract" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

If a bid&#39;s score was higher than six (IOC&#39;s predefined benchmark score), the city was considered highly capable of hosting the Games; otherwise, its chances were very slim.<sup id="_ref-Report1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Report1" title="">[17]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/May_18" id="w">May 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, the IOC announced the cities accepted as candidates:<sup id="_ref-2012candidproc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2012candidproc" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>By <a href="/wiki/November_15" id="w">November 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, all candidates had submitted their candidature files to the IOC.

<p>The Parisian bid suffered two setbacks during the inspection: a number of strikes and demonstrations coincided with the visit, and a report was released stating that <a href="/wiki/Guy_Drut" id="w">Guy Drut</a>, IOC member and one of the key members of Paris&#39;s bid team, would face charges over alleged political party financial corruption.<sup id="_ref-wrongb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wrongb" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_6" id="w">June 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, the IOC released the inspection team&#39;s evaluation reports of the five candidate cities.<sup id="_ref-2012candidproc_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2012candidproc" title="">[16]</a></sup> Although these documents did not contain scores or rankings, the report for Paris was considered the most positive, followed closely by London, which had narrowed most of the gap observed at the time of the first-phase evaluation in 2004. New York City and Madrid also obtained very positive evaluations, while Moscow was considered the weakest bid.<sup id="_ref-wrongc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wrongc" title="">[19]</a></sup> On the same day, New York City&#39;s bid suffered a major setback following the report that the <a href="/wiki/State_of_New_York" id="w">State of New York</a> refused to fund <a href="/wiki/West_Side_Stadium" id="w">West Side Stadium</a>, a New York 2012 centrepiece.<sup id="_ref-wrongd_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wrongd" title="">[20]</a></sup> The New York City campaign devised an alternative plan within a week, but such a major change with only one month remaining before the final vote damaged the city&#39;s chances.</p>
<p>Throughout the bidding process and leading up to the vote at the <a href="/wiki/117th_IOC_Session" id="w">117th IOC Session</a>, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, particularly as its bid was the city&#39;s third in recent history (previous bids being for <a href="/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics_bids" id="w">1992</a> and <a href="/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics_bids" id="w">2008</a>). London was originally seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin, but this situation began to reverse with the appointment of <a href="/wiki/Sebastian_Coe" id="w">Sebastian Coe</a> as the head of London 2012, on <a href="/wiki/May_19" id="w">May 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>.<sup id="_ref-BidPhotoFinish_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BidPhotoFinish" title="">[21]</a></sup> In late August 2004, reports emerged that predicted a tie between London and Paris.<sup id="_ref-wronge_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wronge" title="">[22]</a></sup> In the final run-up to the 117th IOC Session, London and Paris appeared to be in an increasingly close contest.
