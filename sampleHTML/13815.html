In <a href="/wiki/Greek_mythology" id="w">Greek mythology</a>, <b>Heracles</b> or <b>Herakles</b> (&#34;glory of <a href="/wiki/Hera" id="w">Hera</a>&#34;, or &#34;Glorious through Hera,&#34; <b>Alcides</b> (original name) &#34;{{polytonic}} + {{polytonic}}, {{polytonic}})&#34; was a <a href="/wiki/Hero" id="w">divine hero</a>, the son of <a href="/wiki/Zeus" id="w">Zeus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alcmene" id="w">Alcmene</a>, nephew of <a href="/wiki/Amphitryon" id="w">Amphitryon</a><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and great-grandson of <a href="/wiki/Perseus" id="w">Perseus</a>. He was the greatest of the Greek heroes, a paragon of masculinity, the ancestor of royal clans who claimed to be <a href="/wiki/Heracleidae" id="w">Heracleidae</a> and a champion of the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Olympians" id="w">Olympian order</a> against <a href="/wiki/Chthonic" id="w">chthonic</a> monsters. In <a href="/wiki/Roman_mythology" id="w">Rome</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Modernity" id="w">modern</a> <a href="/wiki/Western_civilization" id="w">West</a>, he is known as <b><i><a href="/wiki/Hercules" id="w">Hercules</a></i></b>, with whom the later <a href="/wiki/Roman_Emperor" id="w">Roman Emperors</a>, in particular <a href="/wiki/Commodus" id="w">Commodus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maximianus" id="w">Maximianus</a>, often identified themselves. The Romans adopted the Greek version of his life and works essentially unchanged, but added anecdotal detail of their own, some of it linking the hero with the geography of the Central Mediterranean. Details of his <a href="/wiki/Cult_(religion)" id="w">cult</a> were adapted to Rome as well.</p>
<p>Extraordinary strength, <a href="/wiki/Courage" id="w">courage</a>, ingenuity, and sexual prowess with both males and females were among his characteristic attributes. Although he was not as clever as the likes of <a href="/wiki/Odysseus" id="w">Odysseus</a> or <a href="/wiki/Nestor_(mythology)" id="w">Nestor</a>, Heracles used his wits on several occasions when his strength did not suffice, such as when laboring for the king <a href="/wiki/Augeas" id="w">Augeas</a> of <a href="/wiki/Elis" id="w">Elis</a>, wrestling the giant <a href="/wiki/Antaeus" id="w">Antaeus</a>, or tricking <a href="/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)" id="w">Atlas</a> into taking the sky back onto his shoulders. Together with <a href="/wiki/Hermes" id="w">Hermes</a> he was the patron and protector of <a href="/wiki/Gymnasium_(ancient_Greece)" id="w">gymnasia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Palaestra" id="w">palaestrae</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> His iconographic attributes are the <a href="/wiki/Nemean_Lion" id="w">lion skin</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Club_(weapon)" id="w">club</a>. These qualities did not prevent him from being regarded as a playful figure who used games to relax from his labors and played a great deal with children.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> By conquering dangerous archaic forces he is said to have &#34;made the world safe for mankind&#34; and to be its benefactor.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Heracles was an extremely passionate and emotional individual, capable of doing both great deeds for his friends (such as wrestling with <a href="/wiki/Thanatos" id="w">Thanatos</a> on behalf of Prince <a href="/wiki/Admetus" id="w">Admetus</a>, who had regaled Heracles with his hospitality) and being a terrible enemy who would wreak horrible vengeance on those who crossed him, as Augeas, <a href="/wiki/Neleus" id="w">Neleus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Laomedon" id="w">Laomedon</a> all found out to their cost.  </p>
<a id="Origin_and_character" name="Origin_and_character"></a><h2>Origin and character</h2>
<p>Many popular stories were told of his life, the most famous being <a href="/wiki/The_Twelve_Labours" id="w">The Twelve labors of Heracles</a>; Alexandrian poets of the Hellenistic age drew his mythology into a high poetic and tragic atmosphere<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>. His figure, which initially drew on Near Eastern motifs such as the lion-fight, was known everywhere: his <a href="/wiki/Etruscan_mythology" id="w">Etruscan</a> equivalent was <b>Hercle</b>, a son of <a href="/wiki/Tinia" id="w">Tinia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Uni" id="w">Uni</a>.</p>
<p>Heracles was the greatest of Hellenic <a href="/wiki/Chthonic" id="w">chthonic</a> heroes, but unlike other Greek heroes, no tomb was identified as his. Heracles was both hero and god, as <a href="/wiki/Pindar" id="w">Pindar</a> says <i>heroes theos</i>; at the same festival sacrifice was made to him, first as a hero, with a chthonic <a href="/wiki/Libation" id="w">libation</a>, and then as a god, upon an altar: thus he embodies the closest Greek approach to a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Demi-god" id="w">demi-god</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> The core of the story of Heracles has been identified by Walter Burkert as originating in Neolithic hunter culture and traditions of <a href="/wiki/Shaman" id="w">shamanistic</a> crossings into the netherworld.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Hero_or_god%3F" name="Hero_or_god%3F"></a><h3>Hero or god?</h3>
<p>Heracles&#39; role as a culture hero, whose death could be a subject of mythic telling (see below), was accepted into the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Olympians" id="w">Olympian Pantheon</a> during Classical times. This created an awkwardness in the encounter with <a href="/wiki/Odysseus" id="w">Odysseus</a> in the episode of <i><a href="/wiki/Odyssey" id="w">Odyssey</a></i> XI, called the <a href="/wiki/Nekuia" id="w">Nekuia</a>, where Odysseus encounters Heracles in <a href="/wiki/Hades" id="w">Hades</a>:

<p>Ancient critics were aware of the problem of the aside that interrupts the vivid and complete description, in which Heracles recognizes Odysseus and hails him, and modern critics find very good reasons for denying that the verses beginning, in Fagles&#39; translation <i>His ghost I mean...</i> were part of the original composition: &#34;once people knew of Heracles&#39; admission to Olympus,&#34; they would not tolerate his presence in the underworld,&#34; remarks Friedrich Solmsen<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>, noting that the interpolated verses represent a compromise between conflicting representations of Heracles.</p>
<a id="Christian_dating" name="Christian_dating"></a><h3>Christian dating</h3>
<p>In Christian circles a <a href="/wiki/Euhemerism" id="w">Euhemerist</a> reading of the widespread Heracles/Hercules cult was attributed to a historical figure who had been offered cult status after his death. Thus <a href="/wiki/Eusebius_of_Caesarea" id="w">Eusebius</a>, <i>Preparation of the Gospel</i> (10.12), reported that <a href="/wiki/Saint_Clement" id="w">Clement</a> could offer historical dates for Hercules as a king in Argos: &#34;from the reign of Hercules in <a href="/wiki/Argos" id="w">Argos</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Deification" id="w">deification</a> of Hercules himself and of <a href="/wiki/Asclepius" id="w">Asclepius</a> there are comprised thirty-eight years, according to <a href="/wiki/Apollodorus_of_Athens" id="w">Apollodorus</a> the chronicler: and from that point to the deification of <a href="/wiki/Castor_and_Pollux" id="w">Castor and Pollux</a> fifty-three years: and somewhere about this time was the capture of <a href="/wiki/Troy" id="w">Troy</a>.&#34;</p>
<p>Readers with a literalist bent, following Clement&#39;s reasoning, have asserted from this remark that, since Heracles ruled over <a href="/wiki/Tiryns" id="w">Tiryns</a> in Argos at the same time that <a href="/wiki/Eurystheus" id="w">Eurystheus</a> ruled over <a href="/wiki/Mycenae" id="w">Mycenae</a>, and since at about this time <a href="/wiki/Linus_(mythology)" id="w">Linus</a> was Heracles&#39; teacher, one can conclude, based on <a href="/wiki/Jerome" id="w">Jerome</a>&#39;s date&#8212; in his <a href="/wiki/Universal_history" id="w">universal history</a>, his <i>Chronicon</i>&#8212; given to Linus&#39; notoriety in teaching Heracles in <a href="/wiki/1260s_BC" id="w">1264 BC</a>, that Heracles&#39; death and deification occurred 38 years later, in approximately 1226 BC.</p>
<a id="Cult_of_Heracles" name="Cult_of_Heracles"></a><h3>Cult of Heracles</h3>
<p>The ancient Greeks celebrated the festival of the <i><a href="/wiki/Herakleia" id="w">Herakleia</a></i>, which commemorated the death of Heracles, on the second day of the month of Metageitnion (which would fall in late July or early August). What is believed to be an <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egyptian</a> Temple of Heracles in the <a href="/wiki/Bahariya_Oasis" id="w">Bahariya Oasis</a> dates to 21 BC.</p>

<p>{{Greek myth}}
A major factor in the well-known tragedies surrounding Heracles is the hatred that the <a href="/wiki/Goddess" id="w">goddess</a> <a href="/wiki/Hera" id="w">Hera</a>, wife of <a href="/wiki/Zeus" id="w">Zeus</a>, had for him. A full account of Heracles must render it clear why Heracles was so tormented by Hera, when there are many illegitimate offspring sired by Zeus. Heracles was the fruit of the affair Zeus had with the mortal woman <a href="/wiki/Alcmene" id="w">Alcmene</a>. <a href="/wiki/Zeus" id="w">Zeus</a> made love to her after disguising himself as her husband, <a href="/wiki/Amphitryon" id="w">Amphitryon</a>, home early from war (Amphitryon did return later the same night, and Alcmene became pregnant with his son at the same time, a case of <a href="/wiki/Superfecundation" id="w">superfecundation</a>, where a woman carries twins sired by different fathers).<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Thus, Heracles&#39; very existence proved at least one of Zeus&#39;s many illicit affairs, and Hera often conspired against Zeus&#39;s mortal offspring, as revenge for her husband&#39;s infidelities. His twin mortal brother, son of Amphitryon was <a href="/wiki/Iphicles" id="w">Iphicles</a>, father of Heracles&#39; charioteer <a href="/wiki/Iolaus" id="w">Iolaus</a>.</p>
<p>On the night the twins sharing the same mother were to be born, Hera, knowing of her husband Zeus&#39;s adultery, persuaded Zeus to swear an oath that the child born that night to a member of the House of <a href="/wiki/Perseus" id="w">Perseus</a> would be High King. Once the oath was sworn, Hera hurried to Alcmene&#39;s dwelling and slowed the birth by forcing <a href="/wiki/Ilithyia" id="w">Ilithyia</a>, goddess of childbirth, to sit crosslegged with her clothing tied in knots, thereby causing Heracles to be trapped in the womb. Meanwhile, Hera caused <a href="/wiki/Eurystheus" id="w">Eurystheus</a> to be born prematurely, making him High King in place of Heracles. She would have permanently delayed Heracles&#39; birth had she not been fooled by <a href="/wiki/Galanthis" id="w">Galanthis</a>, Alcmene&#39;s servant, who lied to Ilithyia, saying that <a href="/wiki/Alcmene" id="w">Alcmene</a> had already delivered the baby. Upon hearing this, she jumped in surprise, untying the knots and inadvertently allowing <a href="/wiki/Alcmene" id="w">Alcmene</a> to give birth.</p>
<p>The child was originally given the name Alcides by his parents; it was only later that he became known as Heracles.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> He was renamed Heracles in an unsuccessful attempt to mollify Hera. A few months after he was born, Hera sent two serpents to kill him as he lay in his cot.  Heracles throttled a snake in each hand and was found by his nurse playing with their limp bodies as if they were child&#39;s toys.</p>
<a id="Youth" name="Youth"></a><h3>Youth</h3>
<p>After killing his music tutor <a href="/wiki/Linus_(mythology)" id="w">Linus</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Lyre" id="w">lyre</a>, he was sent to tend cattle on a mountain by his foster father Amphitryon. Here, according to an allegorical <a href="/wiki/Parable" id="w">parable</a>, &#34;The Choice of Heracles&#34;, invented by the sophist <a href="/wiki/Prodicus" id="w">Prodicus</a> (ca. 400 BCE), he was visited by two nymphs - Pleasure and Virtue - who offered him a choice between a pleasant and easy life or a severe but glorious life: he chose the latter. One of Heracles&#39; challenges was put to him by King <a href="/wiki/Thespius" id="w">Thespius</a> of <a href="/wiki/Thespiae" id="w">Thespiae</a> who wished him to kill the Lion of Cithaeron. As a reward, the king offered him the chance to impregnate each of his 50 daughters. Accordingly, Heracles did this in one night (sometimes referred to as his 13th Labour). </p>
<p>Later in <a href="/wiki/Thebes%2C_Greece" id="w">Thebes</a>, Heracles married King <a href="/wiki/Creon" id="w">Creon</a>&#39;s daughter, <a href="/wiki/Megara_(mythology)" id="w">Megara</a>. However, Hera drove Heracles into a fit of madness during which he killed both <a href="/wiki/Megara_(mythology)" id="w">Megara</a> and their children. Upon realizing what he had done, he fled to the <a href="/wiki/Delphi" id="w">Oracle of Delphi</a>. Unbeknownst to him, the Oracle was guided by Hera. He was directed to serve King <a href="/wiki/Eurystheus" id="w">Eurystheus</a> for 12 years and perform any task which he required, resulting in the Twelve Labours of Heracles.</p>

<p>Driven mad by Hera, Heracles slew his own wife and children. To expiate the crime, Heracles was required to carry out ten labors set by his arch-enemy, <a href="/wiki/Eurystheus" id="w">Eurystheus</a>, who had become king in Heracles&#39; place. Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Eurystheus claimed that the cleansing of the Augean stables and the killing of the Lernaean Hydra were not done by himself, and therefore set two further tasks, which Heracles performed successfully. Thus bringing the total number of tasks up to twelve.</p>
<p>Not all writers gave the labors in the same order.  <a href="/wiki/Apollodorus" id="w">Apollodorus</a> (2.5.1-2.5.12) gives the following order:

<p>After completing these tasks, Heracles joined the <a href="/wiki/Argonauts" id="w">Argonauts</a> in the search of the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Fleece" id="w">Golden Fleece</a>. They rescued heroines, conquered Troy, and helped the gods fight against the <a href="/wiki/Gigantes" id="w">Gigantes</a>. He also fell in love with Princess <a href="/wiki/Iole" id="w">Iole</a> of <a href="/wiki/Oechalia" id="w">Oechalia</a>. King <a href="/wiki/Eurytus" id="w">Eurytus</a> of <a href="/wiki/Oechalia" id="w">Oechalia</a> promised his daughter, <a href="/wiki/Iole" id="w">Iole</a>, to whoever could beat his sons in an archery contest. Heracles won but Eurytus abandoned his promise. Heracles&#39; advances were spurned by the king and his sons, except for one - Iole&#39;s brother <a href="/wiki/Iphitus" id="w">Iphitus</a>. Heracles killed the king and his sons–excluding <a href="/wiki/Iphitus" id="w">Iphitus</a>–and abducted Iole. Iphitus became Heracles&#39; best friend. But once again, Hera drove Heracles mad and he threw Iphitus over the city wall to his death. Once again, Heracles purified himself through three years of servitude - this time to Queen <a href="/wiki/Omphale" id="w">Omphale</a> of <a href="/wiki/Lydia" id="w">Lydia</a>.</p>
<a id="Omphale" name="Omphale"></a><h3>Omphale</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Omphale" id="w">Omphale</a> was a queen or princess of <a href="/wiki/Lydia" id="w">Lydia</a>.  As penalty for a murder, Heracles was her slave. He was forced to do women&#39;s work and wear women&#39;s clothes, while she wore the skin of the <a href="/wiki/Nemean_Lion" id="w">Nemean Lion</a> and carried his <a href="/wiki/Olive-wood" id="w">olive-wood</a> club. After some time, Omphale freed Heracles and married him. Some sources mention a son born to them who is variously named. For further details see <a href="/wiki/Omphale" id="w">Omphale</a>. It was at that time that the <a href="/wiki/Cercopes" id="w">cercopes</a>, mischievous wood spirits, stole Heracles&#39; weapons. He punished them by tying them to a stick with their faces pointing downward.</p>
<a id="Hylas" name="Hylas"></a><h3>Hylas</h3>
<p>While walking through the wilderness, Heracles was set upon by the <a href="/wiki/Dryopians" id="w">Dryopians</a>. He killed their king, <a href="/wiki/Theiodamas" id="w">Theiodamas</a>, and the others gave up and offered him Prince <a href="/wiki/Hylas" id="w">Hylas</a>. He took the youth on as his weapons bearer and beloved. Years later, Heracles and Hylas joined the crew of the <a href="/wiki/Argo" id="w">Argo</a>. As <a href="/wiki/Argonauts" id="w">Argonauts</a>, they only participated in part of the journey. In <a href="/wiki/Mysia" id="w">Mysia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hylas" id="w">Hylas</a> was kidnapped by a nymph.  Heracles, heartbroken, searched for a long time but Hylas had fallen in love with the nymphs and never showed up again. In other versions, he simply drowned. Either way, the Argo set sail without them.
Additional Notes: In the cult motion picture, Jason &#38; The Argonauts, Hylas is killed, crushed by the bronze giant Talos as he falls dead. Also, there is reference made to a custom of the local people of the area, whereby every year they would pretend to search for Hylas, calling his name.

<p>Before the <a href="/wiki/Trojan_War" id="w">Trojan War</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poseidon" id="w">Poseidon</a> sent a sea monster to attack <a href="/wiki/Troy" id="w">Troy</a>.

<a id="Marriage%2C_liaisons_and_death" name="Marriage%2C_liaisons_and_death"></a><h2>Marriage, liaisons and death</h2>
<p>Heracles had numerous liaisons with women as well as with boys. Some of the former were linked with later dynasties which claimed descent from his offspring, collectively referred to as the <a href="/wiki/Heracleidae" id="w">Heracleidae</a>.</p>
<a id="Heracles'_women" name="Heracles'_women"></a><h3>Heracles&#39; women</h3>
<p>During the course of his life, Heracles married four times. His first marriage was to <a href="/wiki/Megara_(mythology)" id="w">Megara</a>, whose three children he murdered in a fit of madness. Apollodoros (<i><a href="/wiki/Bibliotheke" id="w">Bibliotheke</a></i>) reports that Megara escaped and married Iolaus, <a href="/wiki/Euripides" id="w">Euripides</a> reports that Hercules shot Megara too. In versions where Megara escapes, he later gave in marriage to his beloved <a href="/wiki/Iolaus" id="w">Iolaus</a>.  His second wife was <a href="/wiki/Omphale" id="w">Omphale</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Lydia" id="w">Lydian</a> queen or princess to whom he was delivered as a slave. </p>
<p>His third marriage was to <a href="/wiki/Deianira" id="w">Deianira</a>, for whom he had to fight the river god <a href="/wiki/Achelous" id="w">Achelous</a>. (Upon Achelous&#39; death, Heracles removed one of his horns and gave it to some nymphs who turned it into the <a href="/wiki/Cornucopia" id="w">cornucopia</a>.) Soon after they wed, Heracles and Deianira had to cross a river, and a <a href="/wiki/Centaur" id="w">centaur</a> named <a href="/wiki/Nessus_(mythology)" id="w">Nessus</a> offered to help Deianira across but then attempted to rape her. Enraged, Heracles shot the centaur from the opposite shore with a poisoned arrow (tipped with the Lernaean Hydra&#39;s blood) and killed him. As he lay dying, Nessus plotted revenge and told Deianira to gather up his blood and spilled semen and, if she ever wanted to prevent Heracles from having affairs with other women, she should apply them to his vestments. Nessus knew that his blood had become tainted by the poisonous blood of the Hydra, and would burn through the skin of anyone it touched.</p>

<p>Later, when Deianira suspected that Heracles was fond of Iole, she soaked a shirt of his in the mixture.  Heracles&#39; servant, <a href="/wiki/Lichas" id="w">Lichas</a>, brought him the shirt and he put it on. Instantly he was in agony, the cloth burning into him. As he tried to remove it, the flesh ripped from his bones. Heracles chose a voluntary death, asking that a <a href="/wiki/Pyre" id="w">pyre</a> be built for him to end his suffering. After death the gods transformed him into an immortal, or alternatively, the fire burned away the mortal part of the demi-god, so that only the god remained. Because his mortal parts had been incinerated, he could now become a full god and join his father and the other Olympians on <a href="/wiki/Mount_Olympus_(Mountain)" id="w">Mount Olympus</a>. He then married <a href="/wiki/Hebe_(mythology)" id="w">Hebe</a>.</p>
<p>Another episode of his female affairs that stands out was his stay at the palace of King <a href="/wiki/Thespios" id="w">Thespios</a>, who encouraged Heracles to make love to his daughters, all fifty of them, in one night. They all got pregnant and all bore sons. Many of the kings of ancient Greece traced their lines to one or another of these, notably the kings of <a href="/wiki/Sparta" id="w">Sparta</a> and <a href="/wiki/Macedon" id="w">Macedon</a>.</p>

<p>As symbol of masculinity and warriorship, Heracles also had a number of <a href="/wiki/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece" id="w">pederastic</a> male beloveds. <a href="/wiki/Plutarch" id="w">Plutarch</a>, in his <i>Eroticos,</i> maintains that Heracles&#39; <a href="/wiki/Eromenos" id="w">eromenoi</a> (male lovers) were beyond counting. Of these, the one most closely linked to Heracles is the <a href="/wiki/Thebes%2C_Greece" id="w">Theban</a> <a href="/wiki/Iolaus" id="w">Iolaus</a>. Their story, an <a href="/wiki/Rite_of_passage" id="w">initiatory</a> myth thought to be of ancient origin, contains many of the elements of the Greek pederastic apprenticeship in which the older warrior is the educator and the younger his helper in battle. Thus, Iolaus is Heracles&#39;s charioteer and squire. In a notable testament to the closeness between the two heroes, Iolaus is also Heracles&#39; <i>symbomos,</i> (altar-sharer). Unlike all other heroes and gods, each of whom had his or her own altar, sacrifices to either hero could be offered at one and the same altar.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also in keeping with the initiatory pattern of the relationship, Heracles in the end gave his pupil a wife, symbolizing his entry into adulthood. Iolaus&#39;s ritual functions paralleled his relationship with Heracles. He was a patron of male love&#8212;Plutarch reports that down to his own time, male couples would go to Iolaus&#39;s tomb in Thebes to swear an oath of loyalty to the hero and to each other<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>&#8212;and he presided over initiations in the historical era, such as the one at <a href="/wiki/Agyrion" id="w">Agyrion</a> in central <a href="/wiki/Sicily" id="w">Sicily</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The tomb of Iolaus is also mentioned by Pindar.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of Heracles&#39; best-known love affairs, and one frequently represented in ancient as well as modern art, is the one with <a href="/wiki/Hylas" id="w">Hylas</a>. Though it is of more recent vintage (dated to the third century) than that with Iolaus, it too exemplifies in detail the normal cycle of a youth&#39;s initiatory process, consisting of education through service to a warrior, including sexual relations, and concluding with promotion to adult status and marriage. <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.androphile.org/preview/Library/Mythology/Greek/Hercules/Hylas/Hylas.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.androphile.org/preview/Library/Mythology/Greek/Hercules/Hylas/Hylas.htm">http://www.androphile.org/preview/Library/Mythology/Greek/Hercules/Hylas/Hylas.htm</a></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sparta" id="w">Sparta</a>, as a warrior city where <a href="/wiki/Pederastic" id="w">pederastic</a> <a href="/wiki/Pedagogy" id="w">pedagogy</a>&#8212;ostensibly of a chaste nature&#8212;was enshrined in the laws given by <a href="/wiki/Lycurgus_(Sparta)" id="w">Lycurgus</a>, the legendary legislator, also provided Heracles with an <a href="/wiki/Eromenos" id="w">eromenos</a>&#8212;<a href="/wiki/Elacatas" id="w">Elacatas</a>, who was honored there with a sanctuary and yearly games. The myth of their love is an ancient one.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Abdera%2C_Thrace" id="w">Abdera</a>&#39;s eponymous hero, <a href="/wiki/Abderus" id="w">Abderus</a>, was another of Heracles&#39; beloveds. In what is considered to be initiatory myth, he was said to have been entrusted with&#8212;and slain by&#8212;the carnivorous mares of Thracian <a href="/wiki/Mares_of_Diomedes" id="w">Diomedes</a>. Heracles founded the city of Abdera in <a href="/wiki/Thrace" id="w">Thrace</a> in his memory, where he was honored with athletic games. The topos of death in such stories is thought to symbolize the passage from one stage of life to another. <sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Among the lesser-known myths is that of <a href="/wiki/Iphitus" id="w">Iphitus</a>. Heracles&#39; subsequent murder of Iphitus is held to be evocative of an initiatory ritual.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Another such story is the one of his love for <a href="/wiki/Nireus" id="w">Nireus</a>, who was &#34;the most beautiful man who came beneath Ilion&#34; (<i>Iliad</i>, 673). Ptolemy adds that certain authors made Nireus out to be a son of Heracles, a fact thought to authenticate this tradition.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The last in this category&#8212;despite the fact that Greek literature preserves no mention of this role&#8212;is the story of <a href="/wiki/Philoctetes" id="w">Philoctetes</a>. He is also heir to the hero&#8212;and thus surely his disciple&#8212;and is the one who lights his pyre. Later he is the initiator of <a href="/wiki/Neoptolemus" id="w">Neoptolemus</a>, son of <a href="/wiki/Achilles" id="w">Achilles</a>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>There is also a series of lovers who are either later inventions or purely literary conceits. Among these are <a href="/wiki/Admetus" id="w">Admetus</a>, who assisted in the hunt for the <a href="/wiki/Calydonian_Boar" id="w">Calydonian Boar</a>;<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Adonis" id="w">Adonis</a>;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Corythus" id="w">Corythus</a>;<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Nestor_(mythology)" id="w">Nestor</a>, who was said to have been loved for his wisdom. His role as eromenos was perhaps to explain why he was the only son of <a href="/wiki/Neleus" id="w">Neleus</a> to be spared by the hero.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Telephus" id="w">Telephus</a> is the son of Heracles and <a href="/wiki/Auge" id="w">Auge</a>.

There is also, in some versions, reference to an episode where Heracles met and impregnated a half-serpentine woman, known as Echidna; her children, known as the Dracontidae, were the ancestors of the House of Cadmus.</p>
<a id="Death_of_Heracles" name="Death_of_Heracles"></a><h3>Death of Heracles</h3>
<p>This is described in <a href="/wiki/Ovid" id="w">Ovid&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Metamorphoses" id="w">Metamorphoses</a></i> Book IX.  Having wrestled and defeated <a href="/wiki/Achelous" id="w">Achelous</a>, god of the Acheloos river,  Heracles takes <a href="/wiki/Deianeira" id="w">Deianeira</a> as his wife.  Travelling to <a href="/wiki/Tiryns" id="w">Tiryns</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Centaur" id="w">centaur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nessus" id="w">Nessus</a>, offers to help Deianeira across a fast flowing river while Heracles swims it.  However, Nessus is true to the archetype of the mischievous centaur and tries to steal Deianara away while Heracles is still in the water.  Angry, Heracles shoots him with his arrows dipped in the poisonous blood of the <a href="/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra" id="w">Lernaean Hydra</a>.  Thinking of revenge, Nessus gives Deianara his <a href="/wiki/Shirt_of_Nessus" id="w">blood-soaked tunic</a> before he dies, telling her it will &#34;excite the love of her husband&#34;. <sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several years later, <a href="/wiki/Rumour" id="w">Rumour</a> tells Deianeira that she has a rival for the love of Heracles.  Deianeira, remembering Nessus&#39; words, gives Heracles the blood-stained shirt. Lichas, the herald, delivers the shirt to Heracles. However, it is still covered in the Hydra&#39;s blood from Heracles&#39; arrows, and this poisons him, tearing his skin and exposing his bones.  Before he dies, Heracles throws <a href="/wiki/Lichas" id="w">Lichas</a> into the sea, thinking he was the one who poisoned him (according to several versions, Lichas turns to stone, becoming a rock standing in the sea, named for him).  Heracles then uproots several trees and builds a <a href="/wiki/Funeral_pyre" id="w">funeral pyre</a>, which <a href="/wiki/Poeas" id="w">Poeas</a>, father of Philoctetes, lights. As his body burns, only his immortal side is left, and Zeus apotheosises him, raising him to Olympus as he dies.</p>
<p>No one but Heracles&#39; friend <a href="/wiki/Philoctetes" id="w">Philoctetes</a> (in some versions: <a href="/wiki/Poeas" id="w">Poeas</a>) would light his funeral pyre (in an alternate versions it is <a href="/wiki/Iolaus" id="w">Iolaus</a> who lights the pyre).  For this action, Philoctetes (or Poeas) received Heracles&#39; bow and arrows, which were later needed by the Greeks to defeat Troy in the Trojan War.
Philoctetes confronted <a href="/wiki/Paris_(mythology)" id="w">Paris</a> and shot a poisoned arrow at him. The Hydra poison would subsequently lead to the death of <a href="/wiki/Paris_(mythology)" id="w">Paris</a>. The Trojan War, however, would continue until the <a href="/wiki/Trojan_Horse" id="w">Trojan Horse</a> was used to defeat <a href="/wiki/Troy" id="w">Troy</a>.</p>

Via the <a href="/wiki/Greco-Buddhist" id="w">Greco-Buddhist</a> culture, Heraclean symbolism was transmitted to the far east. An example remains to this day in the <a href="/wiki/Nio" id="w">Nio</a> guardian deities in front of <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> Buddhist temples. <a href="/wiki/Herodotus" id="w">Herodotus</a> connected Heracles both to <a href="/wiki/Phoenicia" id="w">Phoenician</a> god <a href="/wiki/Melqart" id="w">Melqart</a> and to the <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egyptian</a> god <a href="/wiki/Shu_(Egyptian_deity)" id="w">Shu</a>. Temples dedicated to Heracles abounded all along the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea" id="w">Mediterranean Sea</a> coastal countries.  For example the temple of <i>Heracles Monoikos</i> (i.e. the lone dweller), built far from any nearby town upon a promontory in what is now the <a href="/wiki/Cote_d%26%2339%3BAzur" id="w">Cote d&#39;Azur</a>, gave its name to the area&#39;s more recent name, <a href="/wiki/Monaco" id="w">Monaco</a>.</p>
<p>The gateway to the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic ocean, where the southernmost tip of Spain and the northernmost of Morocco face each other, is, classically speaking, referred to as the Pillars of Hercules/Heracles, owing to the story that he set up two massive spires of stone to stabilise the area and ensure the safety of ships sailing between the two landmasses.</p>
<p>Organisations named after Heracles include the Greek football team <a href="/wiki/Iraklis_F.C." id="w">Iraklis F.C.</a>.</p>
<p>Heracles was canonized by <a href="/wiki/Aleister_Crowley" id="w">Aleister Crowley</a> as a saint in <a href="/wiki/Ecclesia_Gnostica_Catholica" id="w">Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Hercules_(DC_Comics)" id="w">Heracles</a> appeared as an enemy of the Amazons in the pages of <i><a href="/wiki/Wonder_Woman" id="w">Wonder Woman</a></i>. He would later reconcile with them, though. There is also a Marvel Comics superhero named <a href="/wiki/Hercules_(Marvel_Comics)" id="w">Hercules</a>, that is a member of the superhero team The Avengers. He claims to be the god of strength himself, descended from Olympus.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Hercules_(Disney_character)" id="w">Hercules</a> has appeared in several movies, such as a Disney animated movie that was loosely based on his myths, and the 1963 cult classic <a href="/wiki/Jason_and_the_Argonauts_(film)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Jason and the Argonauts&#39;&#39;</a>, where he appeared as a member of crew of the <i>Argo</i>, searching for the golden fleece.
