<p>{{infobox martial art term}}{{Nihongo}} is a <a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" id="w">Japanese</a> word that is used in association with the ancient <a href="/wiki/Japanese_martial_arts" id="w">Japanese martial arts</a>.  This word literally translates as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Wikt:%E5%8F%A4" id="w">old</a> <a href="/wiki/Wikt:%E6%B5%81" id="w">school</a>&#34; or &#34;traditional school&#34;. Koryū is a general term for Japanese schools of martial arts that predate the <a href="/wiki/Meiji_Restoration" id="w">Meiji Restoration</a> (the period from <a href="/wiki/1866" id="w">1866</a> to <a href="/wiki/1869" id="w">1869</a> which sparked major socio-political changes and led to the modernization of <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>). While there is no &#34;official&#34; cutoff date, the dates most commonly used are either 1868, the first year of the <a href="/wiki/Meiji_period" id="w">Meiji period</a>, or 1876, when the <i><a href="/wiki/Hait%C5%8D_edict" id="w">Haitōrei</a></i> edict banning the wearing of swords was pronounced.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The systems of Japanese martial arts that post-date the Meiji Restoration are known as <i><a href="/wiki/Gendai_budo" id="w">gendai budō</a></i>.  The most well known of these arts include <a href="/wiki/Judo" id="w">judo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kendo" id="w">kendo</a>, some schools of <i><a href="/wiki/Iaid%C5%8D" id="w">iaidō</a></i>, and <a href="/wiki/Aikido" id="w">aikido</a>.  These newer systems are commonly valued as sports or arts for self-improvement. The koryū systems of martial arts, however, are commonly far more revered as they are considered the teachings of the true Japanese martial arts, due to the fact that they were formed from Japan&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Feudal" id="w">feudal</a> military culture. </p>
<p>The koryū systems of the Japanese martial arts often contain both unarmed and armed fighting techniques. Within these ancient systems several different weapons are commonly taught to the students of the these arts.</p>
<a id="Kobudo_and_Koryu" name="Kobudo_and_Koryu"></a><h1>Kobudo and Koryu</h1>
<p><b>Kobudo</b> (古武道) is a <a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" id="w">Japanese</a> term that can be translated as &#34;old martial way.&#34; It was formerly known as Kobujutsu (&#34;old martial art&#34;), however, with the advent of <a href="/wiki/Martial_art" id="w">martial arts</a> generally becoming practiced for reasons other than that of practicality, it is now more commonly known as Kobudo.  Within <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>, it can refer to any traditional martial art (such as <a href="/wiki/Tenshin_Sh%C5%8Dden_Katori_Shint%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB" id="w">Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū</a>) and is synomonous with <a href="/wiki/Koryu" id="w">Koryu</a>, but outside of Japan it generally refers to several different weapon traditions of <a href="/wiki/Okinawan_kobudo" id="w">Okinawan</a> origin.</p>
<a id="The_Kory%C5%AB_and_the_Han" name="The_Kory%C5%AB_and_the_Han"></a><h1>The Koryū and the Han </h1>
<p>During the feudal period of Japanese history, many koryū schools were the <i>otome ryū</i>, (literally, &#34;that which flows but remains at home&#34;) of the <i><a href="/wiki/Han_(Japan)" id="w">han</a></i> (domain). Being an <i>otome ryū</i> entailed that the heads of these <i>ryū</i> (schools) would get a rice stipends from the <i>han<b>s total <i><a href="/wiki/Koku" id="w">koku</a></i> (a unit of measurement used to calculate rice revenues and used to measure the relative wealth of a <i>han</i>) in exchange for training the samurai of the <i>han</i>. However, there were exceptions to being funded by a specific <i>han</i>, and many <i>ryū</i> were never or only partially supported by a <i>han</i>. For example, <a href="/wiki/Tenshin_Sh%C5%8Dden_Katori_Shint%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB" id="w">Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū</a> was solely supported by donations from local landed <i>bushi</i> and was never attached to a specific domain. Likewise, Maniwa Nen-ryū was founded and supported by the peasant farmers of Maniwa village in Gunma Prefecture, as a means of village protection. A third example is <a href="/wiki/Kashima-Shinryu" id="w">Kashima Shin-ryū</a> which took its name from a famous Shinto shrine which would acquire funds to support itself from taxing the activities associated with lands owned or regulated by the temple, as well as serving as hereditary guardians of the Kashima shrine. These kinds of arrangements therefore allowed the heads of schools to devote themselves full-time to teaching in the schools, while providing assorted services to the school&#39;s benefactors.</b></i></p>
<p>It was not until the <a href="/wiki/Meiji_Restoration" id="w">Meiji Restoration</a> when this almost 500 year arrangement started to fall apart and various heads of schools had to seek other means of employment. Teaching their <i>ryū</i> to the general public was only one of many options. Today, few, if any, headmasters of a koryū or <i>kenjutsu</i> school make a living teaching their art, yet through their devotion, ensure their arts continue to thrive for generations.</p>
<a id="Kory%C5%AB_and_its_relation_to_Bujutsu_and_Gendai_Bud%C5%8D" name="Kory%C5%AB_and_its_relation_to_Bujutsu_and_Gendai_Bud%C5%8D"></a><h1> Koryū and its relation to Bujutsu and Gendai Budō </h1>

<p>It is often believed that <a href="/wiki/Kend%C5%8D" id="w">kendō</a> and <i><a href="/wiki/Iaid%C5%8D" id="w">iaidō</a></i> are more modern and thereby more advanced and or better systems of <i><a href="/wiki/Kenjutsu" id="w">kenjutsu</a></i> and koryū; this is inaccurate at best. The aims of <a href="/wiki/Bujutsu" id="w">bujutsu</a> (lit. &#34;martial methods&#34;) and <a href="/wiki/Bud%C5%8D" id="w">budō</a> (lit. &#34;martial way&#34;) are two distinct practices that serve distinctly different aims. </p>
<p>The primary objective of a student of a koryū is to engage in the practice of <i>bujutsu</i> in order to develop the combative mindset of his or her <i>ryū</i>, through which he will come to understanding the effective utilization of a broad range of weapons in mortal combat. The objective of <i>budō</i> is rather less terse, while many people enter into <i>budō</i> for reasons of self-defense, most <i>gendai budō</i> (modern martial arts) also seek to develop the spiritual, ethical, and or moral aspects of the individuals in conjunction with the physical and/or sporting aspects. Koryū has no sporting component and free sparring is rarely used due to the danger. While <i>bujutsu</i> and <i>budō</i> remain two distinct practices, they are not mutually exclusive, and the terms are used almost interchangeably in the Japanese language. The distinction, however subtle, between <i>bujutsu</i> and <i>budō</i> points to the essential difference and qualities of each approach and their relationship to koryū.</p>
