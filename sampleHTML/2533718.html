<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1> History </h1>
<p>The &#34;Fightin’ <b>Fifty-Fifth</b>&#34; has made significant contributions to the defense of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" id="w">United States of America</a> for more than 50 years.  Having won honor and distinction for its combat record since World War II with two <a href="/wiki/Distinguished_Unit_Citation" id="w">Distinguished Unit Citations</a>, the wing has since compiled an admirable record of achievements.  Since its inception, the unit has operated around the world, flying a wide variety of aircraft.</p>
<a id="55th_Wing" name="55th_Wing"></a><h2> 55th Wing </h2>
<p>On 1 November 1950, the <b>55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing</b> (55 SRW) activated and was bestowed with the awards and honors of the <a href="/wiki/55th_Operations_Group" id="w">55th Reconnaissance Group</a> at <a href="/wiki/Ramey_Air_Force_Base" id="w">Ramey Air Force Base</a>, Puerto Rico.  From 1950 to 1954 the Wing&#39;s task was to perform strategic reconnaissance, charting photography, precise electronic geodetic mapping, and electronic reconnaissance missions. In 1952, the wing returned to <a href="/wiki/Forbes_Air_Force_Base" id="w">Forbes AFB</a>, Kansas and converted to <a href="/wiki/B-50_Superfortress" id="w">RB-50s</a>.  The wing formally assumed a global strategic reconnaissance mission in 1954 and transited to the <a href="/wiki/B-47" id="w">RB-47E</a> &#34;Stratojet.&#34; The Wing was deployed at <a href="/wiki/Ben_Guerir_Air_Base" id="w">Ben Guerir Air Base</a>, in what was then French Morocco, between May and August 1955.</p>
<p>When the mapping and charting functions originally assigned to the 55th Reconnaissance Group were transferred on 1 May 1954, the wing assumed the mission of global strategic reconnaissance, including electronic reconnaissance. It also carried out weather reconnaissance operations until June 1963, and photographic reconnaissance missions until May 1964. </p>
<p>The 55 SRW moved to Offutt AFB, Nebraska, in August 1966.  That same year the 55th’s <a href="/wiki/38th_Reconnaissance_Squadron" id="w">38th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron</a> assumed responsibility for SAC’s airborne command and control system.  The <a href="/wiki/2d_Airborne_Command_and_Control_Squadron" id="w">2d Airborne Command and Control Squadron</a> inherited this mission after activation on April 1, 1970.  The <a href="/wiki/1st_Airborne_Command_and_Control_Squadron" id="w">1st Airborne Command and Control Squadron</a>, flying <a href="/wiki/E-4A" id="w">E-4A</a> aircraft, transferred to the 55th on November 1, 1975, bringing with it the National Emergency Airborne Command Post, now called the National Airborne Operations Center. The Wing flew reconnaissance operations during the U.S. military operations in Grenada in 1983 and Libya in 1986. On March 1, 1986, the 55 SRW became the host unit at Offutt after the inactivation of the 3902d Air Base Wing. </p>
<p>The Wing ended nearly twenty-five years of continuous Airborne Command Post (&#39;Looking Glass&#39;?) operations in 1990, assumed a modified alert posture, and continued worldwide reconnaissance.</p>
<p>The wing deployed to the Persian Gulf on August 8, 1990, and began 24-hour-a-day reconnaissance of the region for Central Command Commander Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, under <a href="/wiki/Operation_Desert_Shield" id="w">Operation DESERT SHIELD</a>.  At the start of <a href="/wiki/Operation_Desert_Shield" id="w">Operation DESERT STORM</a>, January 18, 1991, the wing continued to provide real-time information to theater commanders and remains there yet today.  </p>
<p>The 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing became the 55th Wing on September 1, 1991, to reflect the wing’s performance of a diversity of missions.  When SAC disestablished and <a href="/wiki/Air_Combat_Command" id="w">Air Combat Command</a> (ACC) established, the wing transferred to ACC and gained its fifth operational location.  The <a href="/wiki/24th_Reconnaissance_Squadron" id="w">24th Reconnaissance Squadron</a> at Eareckson AFB, Shemya, Alaska, joined the wing with its <a href="/wiki/Cobra_Eye" id="w">Cobra Eye</a> and <a href="/wiki/Boeing_RC-135" id="w">Cobra Ball</a> missions.  On April 1, 1993, the 55th Wing took operational control of the <a href="/wiki/11th_Airlift_Flight" id="w">11th Airlift Flight</a>.  The 11 ALF flew operational airlift missions in support of the commander of the United States Strategic Command and transported high-ranking military, Department of Defense officials, and members of Congress.  This unit has since inactivated and the mission has reverted back to Air Mobility Command.  The 2 ACCS also inactivated in 1994 with its mission transferring to the <a href="/wiki/7th_Airborne_Command_and_Control_Squadron" id="w">7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron</a>.   Likewise, the 24 RS inactivated in 1994 and its mission transferred to the newly activated <a href="/wiki/45th_Reconnaissance_Squadron" id="w">45th Reconnaissance Squadron</a>.  Also in 1994, the 1 ACCS National Emergency Airborne Command Post was renamed the National Airborne Operations Center to reflect the addition of a support role to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  </p>
<p>In October 1998, the 55th Wing transferred control of the <a href="/wiki/Boeing_EC-135" id="w">Boeing EC-135</a> <a href="/wiki/Looking_Glass" id="w">Looking Glass</a> mission to the United States Navy’s <a href="/wiki/E-6_Mercury" id="w">E-6B Mercury</a> TACAMO aircraft and the 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron, which flew the Looking Glass aircraft, inactivated.  In September 1999, the <a href="/wiki/338th_Combat_Training_Squadron" id="w">338th Combat Training Squadron</a> was activated and assigned to the <a href="/wiki/55th_Operations_Group" id="w">55th Operations Group</a>.  Additionally, in March 2000, the wing received its 16 RIVET JOINT aircraft.  The wing conducts operations from <a href="/wiki/Offutt_AFB" id="w">Offutt AFB</a>, Nebraska; <a href="/wiki/Kadena_AB" id="w">Kadena AB</a>, Japan; <a href="/wiki/RAF_Mildenhall" id="w">RAF Mildenhall</a>, United Kingdom; Souda Bay Naval Support Activity, Crete; and other locations around the world. The 55th Wing is the largest wing in Air Combat Command and the second largest in the Air Force.</p>
<p>The 55th SRW and the 55th Wing has been awarded the USAF&#39;s P. T. Cullen Award five times since 1971 for its contributions to photo and signal intelligence collection.</p>
