At the age of ten, his mother died, and at age thirteen, his father died, leaving young Elmo an <a href="/wiki/Orphan" id="w">orphan</a>. He was sent to live with his uncle on a ranch near <a href="/wiki/Wilder%2C_Idaho" id="w">Wilder, Idaho</a>.

<p>State Senator Smith would stand up to the influential trucking and powerful lumber industry lobbies to gain passage of an increase in the state highway tax.
