<b><i>The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/Bestseller" id="w">bestselling</a> 1997 <a href="/wiki/Non-fiction" id="w">non-fiction</a> book written by <a href="/wiki/Iris_Chang" id="w">Iris Chang</a> about the 1937–1938 <a href="/wiki/Nanking_Massacre" id="w">Nanking Massacre</a>, the massacre and atrocities committed by the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army" id="w">Imperial Japanese Army</a> after it captured <a href="/wiki/Nanjing" id="w">Nanjing</a>, then capital of <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China" id="w">China</a>, during the <a href="/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War" id="w">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>. It documents the events, based on the author&#39;s research, leading up to the Nanking Massacre and the atrocities that were committed. The book also presents the view that the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_government" id="w">Japanese government</a> has not done enough to redress the atrocities. It is one of the first major English-language books to introduce the Nanking Massacre to <a href="/wiki/Western_world" id="w">Western</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eastern_world" id="w">Eastern</a> readers alike, and has been translated into several languages.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The book was a source of fame for Chang but was also controversial; it has been praised as a work which &#34;shows more clearly than any previous account just what [the Japanese] did&#34;,<sup id="_ref-KirbyForward_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KirbyForward" title="">[2]</a></sup> and at the same time was criticised as &#34;seriously flawed&#34; and &#34;full of misinformation and harebrained explanations&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Fogel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fogel" title="">[3]</a></sup> It was received with both acclaim and criticism by the public and by academics. Chang&#39;s research on the book was credited with the finding of the diaries of <a href="/wiki/John_Rabe" id="w">John Rabe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minnie_Vautrin" id="w">Minnie Vautrin</a>, both of whom played important roles in the <a href="/wiki/Nanking_Safety_Zone" id="w">Nanking Safety Zone</a>, a designated area in Nanjing which protected Chinese civilians during the Nanking Massacre.<sup id="_ref-SFGate2005-04-17_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SFGate2005-04-17" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The book prompted <a href="/wiki/AOL" id="w">AOL</a> executive <a href="/wiki/Ted_Leonsis" id="w">Ted Leonsis</a> to fund and produce <i><a href="/wiki/Nanking_(film)" id="w">Nanking</a></i>, a 2007 <a href="/wiki/Documentary_film" id="w">documentary film</a> about the Nanking Massacre, after he read it.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Inspiration" name="Inspiration"></a><h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p>When Iris Chang was a child, she was told by her immigrant parents, who had escaped from <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> via <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Taiwan</a> to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, that during the Nanking Massacre, the Japanese &#34;sliced babies not just in half but in thirds and fourths&#34;. In the introduction of <i>The Rape of Nanking</i>, she wrote that throughout her childhood, the Nanking Massacre &#34;remained buried in the back of [her] mind as a metaphor for unspeakable evil&#34;.  When she searched the local public libraries in her school and found nothing, she wondered why nobody had written a book about it.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking7-8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking7-8" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The subject of the Nanking Massacre entered Chang&#39;s life again almost two decades later when she learned of producers who had completed documentary films about it. One of the producers was Shao Tzuping, who helped produce <i>Magee&#39;s Testament</i>, a film which contains footage of the Nanking Massacre itself, shot by the <a href="/wiki/Missionary" id="w">missionary</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Magee_(missionary)" id="w">John Magee</a>.<sup id="_ref-Princeton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Princeton" title="">[7]</a></sup> The other producer was Nancy Tong, who, together with Christine Choy, produced and co-directed <i>In The Name of the Emperor</i>, a film containing a series of interviews with Chinese, American, and Japanese citizens.<sup id="_ref-Princeton_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Princeton" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Chang began talking to Shao and Tong, and soon she was connected to a network of activists who felt the need to document and publicize the Nanking Massacre.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking8-9_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking8-9" title="">[8]</a></sup>  In December 1994, she attended a conference on the Nanking Massacre, held in <a href="/wiki/Cupertino%2C_California" id="w">Cupertino</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>, and it was what she saw and heard at the conference that motivated her to write <i>The Rape of Nanking</i>.<sup id="_ref-Penguin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Penguin" title="">[9]</a></sup>  As she wrote in the introduction of the book, while she was at the conference, she was &#34;suddenly in a panic that this terrifying disrespect for death and dying, this reversion in human social evolution, would be reduced to a footnote of history, treated like a harmless glitch in a computer program that might or might not again cause a problem, unless someone forced the world to remember it&#34;.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

Chang spent two years on research for the book.<sup id="_ref-SFGate2005-04-17_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SFGate2005-04-17" title="">[4]</a></sup> She found that raw source materials were available in the US, contained in the diaries, films, and photographs of American missionaries, journalists, and military officers who were in <a href="/wiki/Nanjing" id="w">Nanjing</a> at the time of the Nanking Massacre.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking11_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  Additionally, she traveled to Nanjing to interview survivors of the Nanking Massacre and to read Chinese accounts and confessions by Japanese army veterans.<sup id="_ref-SFGate1998_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SFGate1998" title="">[12]</a></sup> Chang did not, however, conduct research in Japan, and this left her vulnerable to criticisms on how she portrayed modern Japan in the context of how it deals with its World War II past.<sup id="_ref-SFGate1998_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SFGate1998" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chang&#39;s research led her to make what one <i><a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle" id="w">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i> article called &#34;significant discoveries&#34; on the subject of the Nanking Massacre, in the forms of the diaries of two Westerners that were in Nanjing leading efforts to save lives during the Japanese invasion.<sup id="_ref-SFGate2005-04-17_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SFGate2005-04-17" title="">[4]</a></sup> The first diary was that of John Rabe, a <a href="/wiki/Germans" id="w">German</a> <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Party" id="w">Nazi Party</a> member who was the leader of the Nanking Safety Zone, a <a href="/wiki/Demilitarized_zone" id="w">demilitarized zone</a> in Nanjing that Rabe and other Westerners set up to protect Chinese civilians.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>  The other diary belonged to the American missionary Minnie Vautrin, who saved the lives of about 10,000 women and children when she provided them with shelter in <a href="/wiki/Ginling_College" id="w">Ginling College</a>.<sup id="_ref-Vautrin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vautrin" title="">[14]</a></sup>  The diaries documented the events of the Nanking Massacre from the perspectives of their writers, and provided detailed accounts of atrocities that they saw, as well as information surrounding the circumstances of the Nanking Safety Zone. Chang dubbed Rabe the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Oskar_Schindler" id="w">Oskar Schindler</a> of Nanking&#34; and Vautrin the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Anne_Frank" id="w">Anne Frank</a> of Nanking&#34;.<sup id="_ref-SFGate2005-04-17_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SFGate2005-04-17" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Rabe&#39;s diary is over 800 pages, and contains one of the most detailed accounts of the Nanking Massacre.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Translated into English, it was published in 1998 by <a href="/wiki/Random_House" id="w">Random House</a> as a book on its own, called <i><a href="/wiki/The_Good_Man_of_Nanking:_The_Diaries_of_John_Rabe" id="w">The Good Man of Nanking: The Diaries of John Rabe</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  Vautrin&#39;s diary recounts her personal experience and feelings on the Nanking Massacre; in it, an entry reads, &#34;There probably is no crime that has not been committed in this city today.&#34;<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>  It was used as source material for a biographical book about Vautrin and her role during the Nanking Massacre, called <i><a href="/wiki/American_Goddess_at_the_Rape_of_Nanking:_The_Courage_of_Minnie_Vautrin" id="w">American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin</a></i>, written by Hua-ling Hu.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_book" name="The_book"></a><h1>The book</h1>
<p><i>The Rape of Nanking</i> is structured into three main parts.  The first part concentrates on the events of the Nanking Massacre, told from three different perspectives:  that of the Japanese military, the Chinese victims, and the Westerners who tried to help Chinese civilians.  The second part was written on the postwar reaction to the massacre, especially the reaction of the American and European governments.  The third part of the book is dedicated to examining the circumstances that, Chang believed, have kept knowledge of the massacre out of public consciousness decades after the war.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking14-15_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking14-15" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Atrocities" name="Atrocities"></a><h2>Atrocities</h2>
<p>The book depicted in detail the killing, torture, and rape that occurred during the Nanking Massacre.  Chang listed and described the kinds of torture that were visited upon the residents, including <a href="/wiki/Live_burial" id="w">live burials</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mutilation" id="w">mutilation</a>, &#34;death by fire&#34;, &#34;death by ice&#34;, and &#34;death by dogs&#34;.  Based on the testimony of a survivor of the massacre, Chang also described a killing contest amongst a group of Japanese soldiers to determine who could kill the fastest.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking83-88_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking83-88" title="">[20]</a></sup>  On the rape that occurred during the massacre, Chang wrote that &#34;certainly it was one of the greatest mass rapes in world history.&#34;  She estimated that the number of women raped ranged from twenty thousand to as many as eighty thousand,<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking89_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking89" title="">[21]</a></sup> and stated that women from all classes were raped, including <a href="/wiki/Buddhist_nun" id="w">Buddhist nuns</a>.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking90_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking90" title="">[22]</a></sup>  Furthermore, rape occurred in all locations and at all hours,<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking90-91_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking90-91" title="">[23]</a></sup> and women both very young and very old were raped.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking91a_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking91a" title="">[24]</a></sup>  Not even pregnant women were spared, Chang wrote, and that after gang rape, Japanese soldiers &#34;sometimes slashed open the bellies of pregnant women and ripped out the fetuses for amusement&#34;.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking91b_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking91b" title="">[25]</a></sup>  Not all rape victims were women, according to the book, Chinese men were sodomized and forced to perform repulsive sexual acts.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking95a_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking95a" title="">[26]</a></sup>  Some were forced to commit incest—fathers to rape their own daughters, brothers their sisters, sons their mothers.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking95b_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking95b" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Death_toll" name="Death_toll"></a><h2>Death toll</h2>
<p>Chang wrote of the death toll estimates given by different sources; Chinese military specialist Liu Fang-chu proposed a figure of 430,000, officials at the <a href="/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre_Memorial_Hall" id="w">Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall</a> and the procurator of the District Court of Nanjing in 1946 claimed at least 300,000 were killed, the <a href="/wiki/International_Military_Tribunal_for_the_Far_East" id="w">International Military Tribunal for the Far East</a> (IMTFE) judges concluded that more than 260,000 people were killed, Japanese historian Fujiwara Akira approximated 200,000, John Rabe, who &#34;never conducted a systematic count and left Nanking in February&#34;, estimated only 50,000 to 60,000, and Japanese author <a href="/wiki/Ikuhiko_Hata" id="w">Ikuhiko Hata</a> claimed the number killed was between 38,000 and 42,000.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking100_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking100" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>The book discussed the research of historian Sun Zhaiwei of the Jiangsu Academy of Social Sciences.  In a 1990 paper entitled <i>The Nanking Massacre and the Nanking Population</i>, Sun estimated the total number of people killed at 377,400.  Using Chinese burial records, he calculated that the number dead exceeded the figure of 227,400.  He then added estimates totalling 150,000 given by Japanese imperial army major Ohta Hisao in a confessional report about the Japanese army&#39;s disposal efforts of dead bodies, arriving at the sum of 377,400 dead.<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking101_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking101" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chang wrote that there is &#34;compelling evidence&#34; that the Japanese themselves, at the time, believed that the death toll may have been as high as 300,000.  She cited a message that <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Japan)" id="w">Japan&#39;s foreign minister</a> Hirota Koki relayed to his contacts in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_DC" id="w">Washington, DC</a> in the first month of the massacre on <a href="/wiki/January_17" id="w">January 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1938" id="w">1938</a>.  The message acknowledged that &#34;not less than three hundred thousand Chinese civilians [were] slaughtered, many cases in cold blood.&#34;<sup id="_ref-RapeOfNanking103-104_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RapeOfNanking103-104" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>

Kennedy</a>, a professor of history at <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" id="w">Stanford University</a>, also pointed out that while Chang noted that &#34;this book is not intended as a commentary on the Japanese character,&#34; she then wrote about the &#34;&#39;Japanese identity&#39;—a bloody business, in her estimation, replete with martial competitions, samurai ethics, and the fearsome warriors&#39; code of <a href="/wiki/Bushido" id="w">bushido</a>&#34;, making the inference that &#34;&#39;the path to Nanking&#39; runs through the very marrow of Japanese culture.&#34; Kennedy also suggested that &#34;accusation and outrage, rather than analysis and understanding, are this book&#39;s dominant motifs, and although outrage is a morally necessary response to Nanjing, it is an intellectually insufficient one.&#34; <sup id="_ref-Kennedy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kennedy" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Robert Entenmann, professor of history at <a href="/wiki/St._Olaf_College" id="w">St. Olaf College</a>, criticized that the &#34;Japanese historical background Chang presents is clichéd, simplistic, stereotyped, and often inaccurate.&#34;<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> On Chang&#39;s treatment of modern Japanese reaction to the massacre, he writes that Chang seemed &#34;unable to differentiate between some members of the ultranationalist fringe and other Japanese&#34;, and that &#34;her own ethnic <a href="/wiki/Prejudice" id="w">prejudice</a> implicitly pervades her book.&#34; Stating that Chang&#39;s description of the massacre is &#34;open to criticism&#34;, Entenmann further commented that Chang &#34;does not adequately explain why the massacre occurred&#34;.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle" id="w">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i> Staff Writer Charles Burress claimed that Chang&#39;s quote of a secret telegram sent by Japan&#39;s foreign minister in 1938 was incorrectly cited as &#34;compelling evidence&#34; that Japanese troops killed at least 300,000 Chinese civilians in Nanjing.<sup id="_ref-SFGate1998_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SFGate1998" title="">[12]</a></sup> According to Burress, the figure of 300,000 Chinese civilians killed actually came from a message sent by a British reporter, concerning deaths not only in Nanjing but in other places as well.  Additionally, Burress questioned her motivation for writing the book on whether she wrote it as an activist or as a historian, citing that the book &#34;draws its emotional impetus&#34; from her conviction to not let the Nanking Massacre be forgotten to the world.<sup id="_ref-SFGate1998_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SFGate1998" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Journalist Timothy M. Kelly<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> described the book as &#34;simple carelessness, sheer sloppiness, historical inaccuracies, and shameless plagiarism.&#34; He pointed out that &#34;Chang&#39;s discussion of Japanese history exhibits several gross errors,&#34; citing her writing of subjects such as 15th and 16th century Japan and <a href="/wiki/Matthew_C._Perry" id="w">Matthew C. Perry</a>.<sup id="_ref-Kelly_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kelly" title="">[46]</a></sup> According to Kelly, Chang also had <a href="/wiki/Plagiarism" id="w">plagiarized</a> passages and an illustration from <i>Japan&#39;s Imperial Conspiracy</i> by <a href="/wiki/David_Bergamini" id="w">David Bergamini</a>.<sup id="_ref-Kelly_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kelly" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>

<p>Burress criticized Chang&#39;s work in an article published in July 1998.<sup id="_ref-SFGate1998_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SFGate1998" title="">[12]</a></sup> He cited <a href="/wiki/Ikuhiko_Hata" id="w">Ikuhiko Hata</a>, a Japanese history professor at <a href="/wiki/Nihon_University" id="w">Nihon University</a>, who argued that 11 photos in the book were misrepresented or fake. One particular photo shows women and children walking across a bridge with Japanese soldiers, and captioned as &#34;The Japanese rounded up thousands of women. Most were gang-raped or forced into military prostitution.&#34; Hata claimed that the photo originally appeared in 1937 in a Japanese newspaper, as part of a series of photos that showed peaceful scenes of Chinese villagers under Japanese occupation.</p>
<p>Shudo Higashinakano, professor of Intellectual History at <a href="/wiki/Asia_University_(Japan)" id="w">Asia University</a>, pointed out 90 historical factual errors in the first 64 pages of <i>The Rape of Nanking</i>, some of which were corrected in the 1998 <a href="/wiki/Penguin_Books" id="w">Penguin Books</a> edition of the book.<sup id="_ref-Mistakes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mistakes" title="">[31]</a></sup>  Amongst the mistakes that were pointed out, for example, the book stated that for &#34;250 years Japanese military technology failed to advance beyond the bow and sword&#34;, but Japan had actually been producing their own guns since rifles were introduced to the country. Another mistake that was pointed out was that the book had referred to Matthew C. Perry as &#34;Commander Matthew Perry&#34; when he was actually a <a href="/wiki/Commodore_(USN)" id="w">commodore</a> and should be referred to as &#34;Commodore Matthew Perry&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Mistakes_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mistakes" title="">[31]</a></sup>  As further criticism of Chang&#39;s book, Higashinakano argued, in an opinion column that appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/Sankei_Shimbun" id="w">Sankei Shimbun</a></i>, that the book was &#34;pure baloney&#34;, that there was &#34;no witness of illegal executions or murders&#34;, and that &#34;there existed no &#39;Rape of Nanking&#39; as alleged by the Tokyo Trial.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Higashinakano_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Higashinakano" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>

<p>Kennedy criticized Chang&#39;s accusation of &#34;Western indifference&#34; and &#34;Japanese denial&#34; of the massacre as being &#34;exaggerated&#34;, commenting that &#34;the Western world in fact neither then nor later ignored the Rape of Nanking&#34; and that &#34;nor is Chang entirely correct that Japan has obstinately refused to acknowledge its wartime crimes, let alone express regret for them.&#34; Chang argues that Japan &#34;remains to this day a renegade nation,&#34; having &#34;managed to avoid the moral judgment of the civilized world that the Germans were made to accept for their actions in this nightmare time.&#34; However, according to Kennedy, this accusation has already become a cliche of Western criticism of Japan, most notably exemplified by <a href="/wiki/Ian_Buruma" id="w">Ian Buruma</a>&#39;s <i>The Wages of Guilt</i> (1994), whose general thesis might be summarized as &#34;Germany remembers too much, Japan too little.&#34; Kennedy pointed out that a vocal Japanese left has long kept the memory of Nanking alive, noting the <a href="/wiki/Resolution_to_renew_the_determination_for_peace_on_the_basis_of_lessons_learned_from_history" id="w">1995 resolution</a> of Japan&#39;s <a href="/wiki/House_of_Councillors" id="w">House of Councillors</a> that expressed &#34;deep remorse&#34; (<i>fukai hansei</i>) for the suffering that Japan inflicted on other peoples during World War II and clear <a href="/wiki/List_of_war_apology_statements_issued_by_Japan" id="w">apologies</a> (<i>owabi</i>) for Imperial Japan&#39;s offenses against other nations from two Japanese Prime Ministers. <sup id="_ref-Kennedy_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kennedy" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sonni Efron of <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" id="w">Los Angeles Times</a> warned that the bitter flap over Iris Chang&#39;s book may leave Westerners with the &#34;misimpression&#34; that little has been written in Japan about the Nanjing Massacre, when in fact the <a href="/wiki/National_Diet_Library" id="w">National Diet Library</a> holds at least 42 books about the Nanjing massacre and Japan&#39;s wartime misdeeds, 21 of which were written by liberals investigating Japan&#39;s wartime atrocities. In addition, Efron noted that geriatric Japanese soldiers have published their memoirs and have been giving speeches and interviews in increasing numbers, recounting the atrocities they committed or witnessed. After years of government-enforced denial, Japanese middle school textbooks now carry accounts of the Nanjing massacre as accepted truth. <sup id="_ref-once_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-once" title="">[48]</a></sup> Fogel also writes: &#34;Dozens of Japanese scholars are now actively engaged in research on every aspect of the war.... Indeed, we know many details of the Nanjing massacre, Japanese sexual exploitation of &#39;comfort women,&#39; and biological and chemical warfare used in China because of the trailblazing research&#34; of Japanese scholars.<sup id="_ref-Fogel_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fogel" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

 Chang attempted to respond to Burress&#39; criticism in a letter written to the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, but the letter was not published by the newspaper.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup>  In the letter, she offered criticism of her own concerning Burress&#39; article.<sup id="_ref-ChangLetter_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ChangLetter" title="">[50]</a></sup>  Chang found that it was a &#34;disturbing tendency&#34; that Burress quoted right-wing Japanese critics &#34;without demanding evidence to back up their allegations&#34;.  Furthermore, she claimed that Ikuhiko Hata, a source cited by Burress, was not &#34;regarded as a serious scholar&#34; either in Japan or in the US, because he was a regular contributor to &#34;ultra right-wing&#34; Japanese publications.  One such publication had published an article from a <a href="/wiki/Holocaust_denial" id="w">Holocaust denier</a> which claimed that no <a href="/wiki/Gas_chamber" id="w">gas chambers</a> were used in <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> to kill <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jews</a>.  On Burress&#39; criticism of her inaccurate photo captioning, Chang disputed the contention that the caption was wrong.  She wrote that her book dealt with the &#34;horror of the Japanese invasion of China&#34;, and that the caption reading &#34;The Japanese rounded up thousands of women.  Most were gang-raped or forced into military prostitution&#34; contained two statements of indisputable facts. Chang also argued against Burress&#39; claim of her incorrect citation of a telegram sent by Japan&#39;s foreign minister. She wrote that while the original figure of 300,000 Chinese civilian deaths in Nanjing was reported by a British reporter, this figure was cited in a message that Japan&#39;s foreign minister sent to his contacts in Washington, DC.  Being a figure used by a high-ranking Japanese government official, Chang claimed that this was evidence that the Japanese government recognized 300,000 as the number of Chinese civilian deaths.  Finally, she criticized Burress for his &#34;nitpick&#34; of small details in order to draw attention away from the scope and magnitude of the Nanking Massacre, writing that such was a &#34;common tactic&#34; of <a href="/wiki/Holocaust_denial" id="w">Holocaust deniers</a>.<sup id="_ref-ChangLetter_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ChangLetter" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Ritsumeikan_Asia_Pacific_University" id="w">Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University</a> stated that Chang&#39;s work dealt a &#34;severe blow&#34; to the &#34;Great Massacre School&#34; of thought, which advocates for the validity of the findings at the <a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Trials" id="w">Tokyo Trials</a>, the tribunal that was convened to try the leaders of the <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" id="w">Empire of Japan</a> for crimes committed during World War II. Askew further argued that &#34;the Great Massacre School has thus been forced into the (unusual) position of criticising a work that argues for a larger death toll.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Askew_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Askew" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>The book had not been published in a translated Japanese language edition until December 2007.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> Problems with translation efforts surfaced immediately after a contract was signed for the Japanese publishing of the book.

Hall,<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> revisionist historians in Japan organized a committee of right-wing scholars to condemn the book with repeated appearances at the <a href="/wiki/Foreign_Correspondents%26%2339%3B_Club" id="w">Foreign Correspondents&#39; Club</a> in <a href="/wiki/Tokyo" id="w">Tokyo</a> and throughout Japan.  They prevailed on Kashiwa Shobo, the contracted Japanese publisher of the book, to insist that Chang edit the book for &#34;corrections&#34; they wanted made, to delete photographs and alter maps, and to publish a rebuttal to Chang&#39;s book. Chang disagreed with the changes and, as a result, withdrew the Japanese publishing of the book.<sup id="_ref-Hall_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hall" title="">[57]</a></sup>  The rebuttal piece was nonetheless published in the form of a 288-page book, titled <i>A study of The Rape of Nanking</i>, written by <a href="/wiki/Nobukatsu_Fujioka" id="w">Nobukatsu Fujioka</a>, an education professor at <a href="/wiki/Tokyo_University" id="w">Tokyo University</a>,<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> and Higashinakano<sup id="_ref-Higashinakano_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Higashinakano" title="">[47]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Hall_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hall" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
