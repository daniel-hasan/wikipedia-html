<p>Runcorn was a small, isolated village until the coming of the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" id="w">Industrial Revolution</a>. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries it was a health resort. Towards the end of the 18th century, a port began to develop on the south bank of the River Mersey.  During the 19th century industries developed, in particular the manufacture of soap and alkali, quarrying, shipbuilding, engineering, and tanning. In the early 20th century, the prime industries were chemicals and tanning. The original village has grown to include what were outlying villages.  Except for chemicals, all the old industries have disappeared, and there has been diversification, in particular because of the close links to the motorway system, and the development of warehousing and distribution centres. A <a href="/wiki/New_town#United Kingdom" id="w">new town</a> was built to the east of the existing town in the 1960s and 1970s, and farther to the east, areas of private housing have been established; this has resulted in a doubling of the population from around 30,000 to its present level.  </p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>The earliest written reference to the town is in the <i><a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle" id="w">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a></i>, where it is spelled Rumcofan, literally “a wide cove or bay”. This word is derived from the <a href="/wiki/Old_English_language" id="w">Old English</a> words <i>rúm</i> (“wide” or “broad”) and <i>cofa</i> (“cave” or “cove”). Other historical spellings of Runcorn include Rumcoven, Ronchestorn, Runckhorne, and Runcorne.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Little is known about the early history of the settlement but isolated findings of objects from the <a href="/wiki/Stone_Age" id="w">Stone</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Age" id="w">Bronze</a> and <a href="/wiki/Iron_Age" id="w">Iron Ages</a> have been made and there is evidence of a <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Roman</a> presence in the area.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  The earliest recorded event in its history is the building by <a href="/wiki/Ethelfleda" id="w">Ethelfleda</a> of a fortification at Runcorn to protect the northern frontier of her kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Mercia" id="w">Mercia</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Viking" id="w">Vikings</a> in 915. The fort was built on Castle Rock overlooking the River Mersey at Runcorn Gap.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

Following the <a href="/wiki/Norman_conquest" id="w">Norman conquest</a>, Runcorn was not mentioned in the 1086 <a href="/wiki/Domesday_Book" id="w">Domesday</a> survey, although surrounding settlements were. <a href="/wiki/William_I_of_England" id="w">William the Conqueror</a> granted the <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Chester" id="w">earldom of Chester</a> to <a href="/wiki/Hugh_d%26%2339%3BAvranches%2C_1st_Earl_of_Chester" id="w">Hugh d&#39;Avranches</a> who granted the <a href="/wiki/Barons_of_Halton" id="w">barony of Halton</a> to Nigel.  It is likely that Nigel erected a <a href="/wiki/Motte_and_bailey" id="w">motte and bailey</a> castle on Halton Hill in the 1070s.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  In 1115, Nigel&#39;s son, William Fitznigel, founded an <a href="/wiki/Augustinian" id="w">Augustinian</a> <a href="/wiki/Priory" id="w">Priory</a> at Runcorn. In 1134 the priory was moved to Norton, about {{convert}} away. In 1391 the priory was raised to the higher status of <a href="/wiki/Abbey" id="w">abbey</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> In 1536 the monastery was dissolved, and around nine years later the buildings and some of the monastic lands were sold to Sir <a href="/wiki/Richard_Brooke" id="w">Richard Brooke</a> who converted the habitable part of the abbey into a house.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" id="w">Civil War</a> Halton Castle was held for the <a href="/wiki/Cavaliers" id="w">Royalists</a> by John Savage, 2nd <a href="/wiki/Earl_Rivers" id="w">Earl Rivers</a>, the Steward of Halton. It fell twice to Parliamentarian <a href="/wiki/Roundheads" id="w">Roundheads</a>. The first siege was led by <a href="/wiki/Sir_William_Brereton" id="w">Sir William Brereton</a> in 1643; the second was during the following year. Following this, a &#34;Council of War&#34; was held in Warrington in 1646 at which it was decided that the castle should be <a href="/wiki/Slighting" id="w">slighted</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>  In 1656, Runcorn was described as being &#34;nothing but a fair parish church, a parsonage and a few scattered tenements&#34;.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  And so it remained for over a century, an isolated and poor hamlet.  The only through traffic used the ferry which crossed from Runcorn to the north bank of the River Mersey.  Towards the end of the 18th century and in the early years of the 19th century the town was a health resort.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Soap and alkali works on the Bridgewater canal during the 19th century</div>
During the 18th century water transport had been improved in the area by the Mersey and <a href="/wiki/Irwell" id="w">Irwell</a> Navigation, the <a href="/wiki/Bridgewater_Canal" id="w">Bridgewater Canal</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Trent_and_Mersey_Canal" id="w">Trent and Mersey Canal</a>.  This gave Runcorn waterway connections with most of the interior of England through the canal system and with the sea along the River Mersey, thus forming the basis for the development of the <a href="/wiki/Port_of_Runcorn" id="w">Port of Runcorn</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  Later came the Runcorn to <a href="/wiki/Latchford" id="w">Latchford</a> canal, and the Weston canal which gave better access to the Weaver Navigation system.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>  Industries began to develop within and around the town, in particular quarrying for Runcorn <a href="/wiki/Sandstone" id="w">sandstone</a>, shipbuilding, engineering, the manufacture of soap and chemicals and tanning.  Runcorn was becoming an industrialised and highly polluted town.  During the later 19th century the town became increasingly dominated by the chemical and tanning industries.  </p>
<p>In 1868 the <a href="/wiki/Runcorn_Railway_Bridge" id="w">Runcorn Railway Bridge</a> was opened across the Mersey, giving Runcorn direct rail links with <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" id="w">Liverpool</a> and the rest of the country.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>  In the 1880s a pipeline was opened between Northwich and Weston Point, supplying brine to the salt and chemical works.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>  In 1894 the <a href="/wiki/Manchester_Ship_Canal" id="w">Manchester Ship Canal</a> was opened throughout its length.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>  This allowed ocean-going ships to travel inland as far as <a href="/wiki/Salford" id="w">Salford</a>, some of them calling at the port of Runcorn.  The rise in population between 1881 and 1891 and the drop by 1901 is explained by the number of people involved in constructing the ship canal.  In 1905 the <a href="/wiki/Widnes-Runcorn_Transporter_Bridge" id="w">Widnes-Runcorn Transporter Bridge</a> opened, giving a direct link for vehicular traffic for the first time between the two towns.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the first half of the 20th century the industry of the town continued to be dominated by chemicals and tanning.  In 1926 four chemical companies merged to form <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Chemical_Industries" id="w">Imperial Chemical Industries</a> (ICI).  As the century progressed there was diversification of industry. In 1961 the Transporter Bridge was replaced by Runcorn Road Bridge (since named the Silver Jubilee Bridge) which allowed a more efficient means of road traffic across Runcorn Gap.  The designation of Runcorn as a new town in 1964 brought major changes and more than doubled the population. Much of the architecture of the new town was innovative, especially the Southgate development designed by <a href="/wiki/James_Stirling_(architect)" id="w">Sir James Stirling</a> and built between 1970 and 1977.  Stirling&#39;s housing development was beset with problems and it was demolished in the early 1990s.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>  During the second half of the 20th century the tanneries closed and the chemical industry declined. At the same time, light industry developed together with warehouses and distribution centres.<sup id="_ref-ep_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ep" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

Runcorn is situated on a spur projecting into the River Mersey, which flows to the north and then to the west of the town. On the north bank of the river is another spur forming the West Bank area of Widnes; together these form Runcorn Gap, a narrowing of the River Mersey. Runcorn Gap is crossed by the <a href="/wiki/Runcorn_Railway_Bridge" id="w">Runcorn Railway Bridge</a>, which carries the Liverpool branch of the West Coast Main Line, and the <a href="/wiki/Silver_Jubilee_Bridge" id="w">Silver Jubilee Bridge</a>, which carries the A533 road.
