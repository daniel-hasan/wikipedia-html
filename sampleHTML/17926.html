The <b>League of Nations</b> was an <a href="/wiki/International_organization" id="w">international organization</a> founded as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919–1920. The League&#39;s goals included <a href="/wiki/Arms_control" id="w">disarmament</a>, preventing <a href="/wiki/War" id="w">war</a> through <a href="/wiki/Collective_security" id="w">collective security</a>, settling disputes between <a href="/wiki/Country" id="w">countries</a> through <a href="/wiki/Negotiation" id="w">negotiation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diplomacy" id="w">diplomacy</a> and improving global <a href="/wiki/Quality_of_life" id="w">welfare</a>. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked an armed force of its own and so depended on the <a href="/wiki/Great_power" id="w">Great Powers</a> to enforce its resolutions, keep to economic sanctions which the League ordered, or provide an army, when needed, for the League to use. However, they were often very reluctant to do so. <a href="/wiki/Benito_Mussolini" id="w">Benito Mussolini</a> stated that &#34;The League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out.&#34;  </p>
<p>After a number of notable <a href="/wiki/#Successes" id="w">successes</a> and some early <a href="/wiki/#Specific failures" id="w">failures</a> in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the <a href="/wiki/Axis_Powers" id="w">Axis Powers</a> in the 1930s. The onset of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">Second World War</a> suggested that the League had failed in its primary purpose — to avoid any future world war. The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a> replaced it after the end of the war and inherited a number of agencies and organizations founded by the League.</p>

</p>
<p>A predecessor of the League of Nations in many respects were the international <a href="/wiki/Hague_Conventions_(1899_and_1907)" id="w">Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)</a>. The &#34;Hague Confederation of States&#34; as the Neo-Kantian pacifist Walther Schücking called it, formed a universal alliance aiming at disarmament and the peaceful settlement of disputes through arbitration. The concept of a peaceful community of nations had previously been described in <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" id="w">Immanuel Kant</a>’s <i><a class="externallink" href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm">Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch</a></i> (1795). Following the failure of the Hague Peace Conferences - a third conference had been planned for 1915 - the idea of the actual League of Nations appears to have originated with <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_Affairs" id="w">British Foreign Secretary</a> <a href="/wiki/Edward_Grey%2C_1st_Viscount_Grey_of_Fallodon" id="w">Edward Grey</a>, and it was enthusiastically adopted by the <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic</a> <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" id="w">Woodrow Wilson</a> and his advisor <a href="/wiki/Colonel" id="w">Colonel</a> <a href="/wiki/Edward_M._House" id="w">Edward M. House</a> as a means of avoiding bloodshed like that of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>. The creation of the League was a centerpiece of Wilson&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Fourteen_Points" id="w">Fourteen Points for Peace</a>, specifically the final point: &#34;A general association of nations must be formed under lenient covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.&#34;</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference" id="w">Paris Peace Conference</a> accepted the proposal to create the League of Nations (<a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>: <i>Société des Nations</i>, <a href="/wiki/German_language" id="w">German</a>: <i>Völkerbund</i>) on <a href="/wiki/January_25" id="w">January 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1919" id="w">1919</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Covenant_of_the_League_of_Nations" id="w">Covenant of the League of Nations</a> was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on <a href="/wiki/June_28" id="w">June 28</a> <a href="/wiki/1919" id="w">1919</a>. Initially, the <a href="/wiki/Charter" id="w">Charter</a> was signed by 44 <a href="/wiki/State" id="w">states</a>, including 31 states which had taken part in the war on the side of the <a href="/wiki/Triple_Entente" id="w">Triple Entente</a> or joined it during the conflict. Despite Wilson&#39;s efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize" id="w">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1919, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> neither <a href="/wiki/Ratification" id="w">ratified</a> the Charter nor joined the League due to opposition in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" id="w">U.S. Senate</a>, especially influential <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Republicans</a> <a href="/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge" id="w">Henry Cabot Lodge</a> of <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Edgar_Borah" id="w">William E. Borah</a> of <a href="/wiki/Idaho" id="w">Idaho</a>, together with Wilson&#39;s refusal to compromise.</p>
<p>The League held its first meeting in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> on <a href="/wiki/January_10" id="w">January 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a>. Its first action was to ratify the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" id="w">Treaty of Versailles</a>, officially ending World War I. The headquarters of the League moved to <a href="/wiki/Geneva" id="w">Geneva</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_1" id="w">November 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a>, where the first general assembly of the League was held on <a href="/wiki/November_15" id="w">November 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a> with representatives from 41 nations in attendance.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/David_Kennedy" id="w">David Kennedy</a>, a professor at <a href="/wiki/Harvard_Law_School" id="w">Harvard Law School</a>, examined the League through the scholarly texts surrounding it, the establishing treaties, and voting sessions of the plenary.  Kennedy suggests the League is a unique moment when international affairs was &#34;institutionalized&#34; as opposed to the pre-World War I methods of law and politics (Kennedy, 1987).</p>
<a id="Symbols" name="Symbols"></a><h1>Symbols</h1>
<p>The League of Nations had neither an official <a href="/wiki/Flag" id="w">flag</a> nor <a href="/wiki/Logo" id="w">logo</a>. Proposals for adopting an official symbol were made during the League&#39;s beginning in 1921, but the member states never reached agreement. However, League of Nations organizations used varying logos and flags (or none at all) in their own operations. An international contest was held in 1929 to find a design, which again failed to produce a symbol. One of the reasons for this failure may have been the fear by the member states that the power of the supranational organization might supersede them.
Finally, in 1939, a semi-official emblem emerged: two five-pointed <a href="/wiki/Star_(symbol)" id="w">stars</a> within a blue <a href="/wiki/Pentagon" id="w">pentagon</a>. The pentagon and the five-pointed stars were supposed to symbolize the five <a href="/wiki/Continent" id="w">continents</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Race_(historical_definitions)" id="w">five races</a> of mankind. In a bow on top and at the bottom, the flag had the names in <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> (<i>League of Nations</i>) and <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a> (<i>Société des Nations</i>). This flag was used on the building of the <a href="/wiki/1939_New_York_World%26%2339%3Bs_Fair" id="w">New York World&#39;s Fair</a> in 1939 and 1940.</p>
<a id="Languages" name="Languages"></a><h1>Languages</h1>
<p>The official languages of the League of Nations were <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>, <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" id="w">Spanish</a> (from 1920). In 1921, there was a proposal by the Under-Secretary General of the League of Nations, Dr. <a href="/wiki/Nitobe_Inaz%C5%8D" id="w">Nitobe Inazō</a>, for the League to accept <a href="/wiki/Esperanto" id="w">Esperanto</a> as their working language. Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, <a href="/wiki/Gabriel_Hanotaux" id="w">Gabriel Hanotaux</a>. Hanotaux did not like how the <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French language</a> was losing its position as the international language of diplomacy and saw Esperanto as a threat. Two years later the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula.</p>
<a id="Structure" name="Structure"></a><h1>Structure</h1>
<p>The League had three principal organs: a <a href="/wiki/Secretariat" id="w">secretariat</a> (headed by the <a href="/wiki/General_secretary" id="w">General Secretary</a> and based in <a href="/wiki/Geneva" id="w">Geneva</a>), a Council, and an Assembly. The League also had numerous Agencies and Commissions. Authorization for any action required both a unanimous vote by the Council and a majority vote in the Assembly.</p>
<a id="Secretariat_and_Assembly" name="Secretariat_and_Assembly"></a><h2>Secretariat and Assembly </h2>
<p>The staff of the League&#39;s secretariat was responsible for preparing the agenda for the Council and Assembly and publishing reports of the meetings and other routine matters, effectively acting as the <a href="/wiki/Civil_service" id="w">civil service</a> for the League.</p>

<a id="Council" name="Council"></a><h2>Council</h2>
<p>The league Council had the authority to deal with any matter affecting <a href="/wiki/World_peace" id="w">world peace</a>. The Council began with four permanent members (the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>) and four non-permanent members, which were elected by the Assembly for a three-year period. The first four non-permanent members were <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brazil" id="w">Brazil</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>. The <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> was meant to be the fifth permanent member, but the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" id="w">United States Senate</a> was dominated by the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Republican Party</a> after the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Senate_election%2C_1918" id="w">1918 election</a> and voted on <a href="/wiki/March_19" id="w">March 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Ratification" id="w">ratification</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" id="w">Treaty of Versailles</a>, thus preventing American participation in the League. This prompted the United States to go back to policies of <a href="/wiki/Isolationism" id="w">isolationism</a>.</p>
<p>The initial composition of the Council was subsequently changed a number of times. The number of non-permanent members was first increased to six on <a href="/wiki/September_22" id="w">September 22</a> <a href="/wiki/1922" id="w">1922</a>, and then to nine on <a href="/wiki/September_8" id="w">September 8</a> <a href="/wiki/1926" id="w">1926</a>. <a href="/wiki/Weimar_Republic" id="w">Germany</a> also joined the League and became a fifth permanent member of the Council on the latter date, taking the Council to a total of fifteen members. When Germany and Japan later both left the League, the number of non-permanent seats was eventually increased from nine to eleven.
The Council met on average five times a year, and in extraordinary sessions when required. In total, 107 public sessions were held between 1920 and 1939.</p>
<a id="Other_bodies" name="Other_bodies"></a><h2>Other bodies</h2>
<p>The League oversaw the <a href="/wiki/Permanent_Court_of_International_Justice" id="w">Permanent Court of International Justice</a> and several other agencies and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems. These were the <a href="/wiki/Arms_control" id="w">Disarmament</a> Commission, the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" id="w">Health Organization</a>, the <a href="/wiki/International_Labour_Organization" id="w">International Labour Organization</a>, the <a href="/wiki/#Mandates" id="w">Mandates</a> Commission, the <a href="/wiki/International_Commission_on_Intellectual_Cooperation" id="w">International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation</a> (ancestor of the <a href="/wiki/UNESCO" id="w">UNESCO</a>), the Permanent Central <a href="/wiki/Opium" id="w">Opium</a> Board, the Commission for <a href="/wiki/Refugee" id="w">Refugees</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Slavery" id="w">Slavery</a> Commission. While the League itself is generally branded a failure, several of its Agencies and Commissions had successes within their respective mandates.</p>
<dl><dt><b>Disarmament Commission</b></dt><dd>The Commission obtained initial agreement by France, Italy, Japan, and Britain to limit the size of their navies.

Iraq became a member in 1932.</p>
<a id="Mandates" name="Mandates"></a><h1>Mandates</h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>League of Nations Mandates were established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. These territories were former <a href="/wiki/Colony" id="w">colonies</a> of the <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" id="w">German Empire</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Ottoman Empire</a> that were placed under the supervision of the League following <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>. There were three Mandate classifications:
</p><dl><dt><b>&#34;A&#34; Mandate</b></dt><dd>This was a territory which &#34;<i>had reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised, subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a &#34;Mandatory&#34; until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory.</i>&#34; These were mainly parts of the old Ottoman Empire.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>&#34;B&#34; Mandate</b></dt><dd>This was a territory which &#34;<i>was at such a stage that the Mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee:</i></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Freedom of <a href="/wiki/Conscience" id="w">conscience</a> and <a href="/wiki/Religion" id="w">religion</a></i></li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li><i>The maintenance of <a href="/wiki/Social_control" id="w">public order</a> and <a href="/wiki/Public_morality" id="w">morals</a></i></li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Prohibition of abuses such as the <a href="/wiki/Slave_trade" id="w">slave trade</a>, the arms traffic and the <a href="/wiki/Distilled_beverage" id="w">liquor</a> traffic</i></li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li><i>The prevention of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases and of military training of the natives for other than political purposes and the defence of territory</i></li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li><i>Equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other Members of the League.</i>&#34;</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dt><b>&#34;C&#34; Mandate</b></dt><dd>This was a territory &#34;<i>which, owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centres of civilisation, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatory, and other circumstances, can be best administered under the laws of the Mandatory.</i>&#34;</dd></dl>
<p>(Quotations taken from <i>The Essential Facts About the League of Nations</i>, a handbook published in <a href="/wiki/Geneva" id="w">Geneva</a> in 1939).</p>
<p>The territories were governed by &#34;Mandatory Powers&#34;, such as the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> in the case of the <a href="/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine" id="w">Mandate of Palestine</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa" id="w">Union of South Africa</a> in the case of <a href="/wiki/South-West_Africa" id="w">South-West Africa</a>, until the territories were deemed capable of self-government. There were fourteen mandate territories divided up among the six Mandatory Powers of the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>. In practice, the Mandatory Territories were treated as colonies and were regarded by critics as spoils of war. With the exception of <a href="/wiki/Iraq" id="w">Iraq</a>, which joined the League on <a href="/wiki/October_3" id="w">October 3</a> <a href="/wiki/1932" id="w">1932</a>, these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a>, a process that did not end until 1990. Following the demise of the League, most of the remaining mandates became <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Trust_Territories" id="w">United Nations Trust Territories</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the Mandates, the League itself governed the <a href="/wiki/Saarland" id="w">Saarland</a> for 15 years, before it was returned to <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Germany</a> following a plebiscite, and the <a href="/wiki/Free_city" id="w">free city</a> of <a href="/wiki/Free_City_of_Danzig" id="w">Danzig</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk" id="w">Gdańsk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a>) from <a href="/wiki/15_November" id="w">15 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a> to <a href="/wiki/1_September" id="w">1 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1939" id="w">1939</a>.</p>
<a id="Successes" name="Successes"></a><h1>Successes</h1>
<p>The League is generally considered to have failed in its mission to achieve disarmament, prevent war, settle disputes through diplomacy, and improve global welfare. However, it achieved significant successes in a number of areas.</p>
<a id="%C3%85land_Islands" name="%C3%85land_Islands"></a><h2>Åland Islands</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Åland" id="w">Åland</a> is a collection of around 6,500 islands mid-way between <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a> and <a href="/wiki/Finland" id="w">Finland</a>. The islands are exclusively <a href="/wiki/Swedish_language" id="w">Swedish</a>-speaking, but in 1809 Sweden had lost both Finland and the Åland islands to <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Russia" id="w">Imperial Russia</a>. When Finland in December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian <a href="/wiki/October_Revolution" id="w">October Revolution</a>, declared independence, most of the Ålanders wished the islands to become part of Sweden again; Finland, however, felt that the islands were part of their new nation, as the Russians had included them in the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Finland" id="w">Grand Duchy of Finland</a> formed in 1809. The Swedish government raised the issue with the League in 1921. After close consideration, the League determined that the islands should remain a part of Finland, but be governed autonomously, averting a potential war between the two countries.</p>
<a id="Albania" name="Albania"></a><h2>Albania</h2>
<p>The border between <a href="/wiki/Albania" id="w">Albania</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia" id="w">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> remained in dispute after the <a href="/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference" id="w">Paris Peace Conference</a> in 1919, and Yugoslavian forces occupied some Albanian territory. After clashes with Albanian tribesmen, the Yugoslav forces invaded farther. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. The commission found in favour of Albania, and the Yugoslav forces withdrew in 1921, albeit under protest. War was again prevented.</p>
<a id="Austria_and_Hungary" name="Austria_and_Hungary"></a><h2>Austria and Hungary</h2>
<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/First_World_War" id="w">First World War</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hungary" id="w">Hungary</a> were facing bankruptcy due to all the reparations they had to pay. The League arranged loans for the two nations and sent commissioners to oversee the spending of this money. These actions started Austria and Hungary on the road to economic recovery.</p>
<a id="Upper_Silesia" name="Upper_Silesia"></a><h2>Upper Silesia</h2>
<p>The Treaty of Versailles had ordered a <a href="/wiki/Plebiscite" id="w">plebiscite</a> in <a href="/wiki/Upper_Silesia" id="w">Upper Silesia</a> to determine whether the territory should be part of <a href="/wiki/Weimar_Republic" id="w">Germany</a> or <a href="/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic" id="w">Poland</a>. In the background, strong-arm tactics and discrimination against Poles led to <a href="/wiki/Riot" id="w">rioting</a> and eventually to the first two <a href="/wiki/Silesian_Uprisings" id="w">Silesian Uprisings</a> (1919 and 1920). In the plebiscite, roughly 59.6% (around 500,000) of the votes were cast for joining Germany, and this result led to the <a href="/wiki/Third_Silesian_Uprising" id="w">Third Silesian Uprising</a> in 1921. The League was asked to settle the matter. In 1922, a six-week investigation found that the land should be split; the decision was accepted by both countries and by the majority of Upper Silesians.</p>
<a id="Memel" name="Memel"></a><h2>Memel</h2>
<p>The port city of <a href="/wiki/Klaip%C4%97da" id="w">Memel</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Klaip%C4%97da" id="w">Klaipėda</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Klaip%C4%97da_Region" id="w">the surrounding area</a> was placed under League control after the end of the World War I and was governed by a French general for three years. Although the population was mostly <a href="/wiki/Germans" id="w">German</a>, the Lithuanian government placed a claim to the territory, with Lithuanian forces invading in 1923. The League chose to cede the land around Memel to Lithuania, but declared the port should remain an international zone; Lithuania agreed. While the decision could be seen as a failure (in that the League reacted passively to the use of force), the settlement of the issue without significant bloodshed was a point in the League&#39;s favour.</p>
<a id="Greece_and_Bulgaria" name="Greece_and_Bulgaria"></a><h2>Greece and Bulgaria</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>After an incident between sentries on the border between <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" id="w">Bulgaria</a> in 1925, Greek troops invaded their neighbour. Bulgaria ordered its troops to provide only token resistance, trusting the League to settle the dispute. The League did indeed condemn the Greek invasion, and called for both Greek withdrawal and compensation to Bulgaria. Greece complied, but complained about the disparity between their treatment and that of <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a> (see <a href="/wiki/#Corfu" id="w">Corfu</a>, below).</p>
<a id="Saar" name="Saar"></a><h2>Saar</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Saarland" id="w">Saar</a> was a province formed from parts of <a href="/wiki/Prussia" id="w">Prussia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Rhenish_Palatinate" id="w">Rhenish Palatinate</a> that was established and placed under League control after the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" id="w">Treaty of Versailles</a>. A plebiscite was to be held after fifteen years of League rule, to determine whether the region should belong to Germany or France. 90.3% of votes cast were in favour of becoming part of Germany in that 1935 referendum, and it became part of Germany again.</p>
<a id="Mosul" name="Mosul"></a><h2>Mosul</h2>
<p>The League resolved a dispute between <a href="/wiki/Iraq" id="w">Iraq</a> and <a href="/wiki/Turkey" id="w">Turkey</a> over the control of the former Ottoman province of <a href="/wiki/Mosul" id="w">Mosul</a> in 1926. According to the UK, which was awarded a League of Nations <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations#Mandates" id="w">A-mandate</a> over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A three person League of Nations committee was sent to the region in 1924 to study the case and in 1925 recommended the region to be connected to Iraq, under the condition that the UK would hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to assure the autonomous rights of the <a href="/wiki/Kurd" id="w">Kurdish</a> population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and it decided on <a href="/wiki/16_December" id="w">16 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1925" id="w">1925</a> to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted the League of Nations arbitration in the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne" id="w">Treaty of Lausanne</a> in 1923, it rejected the League&#39;s decision. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey made a treaty on <a href="/wiki/5_June" id="w">5 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1926" id="w">1926</a>, that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq.</p>
<a id="Liberia" name="Liberia"></a><h2>Liberia</h2>
<p>Following rumours of <a href="/wiki/Forced_labor" id="w">forced labor</a> in the independent African country of <a href="/wiki/Liberia" id="w">Liberia</a>, the League launched an investigation into the matter, particularly the alleged use of forced labor on the massive <i><a href="/wiki/Firestone_Tire_and_Rubber_Company" id="w">Firestone</a></i> rubber plantation in that country. In 1930, a report by the League implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labor, leading to the resignation of President <a href="/wiki/Charles_D.B._King" id="w">Charles D.B. King</a>, his vice-president and numerous other government officials. The League followed with a threat to establish a trusteeship over Liberia unless reforms were carried out, which became the central focus of President <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Barclay" id="w">Edwin Barclay</a>.</p>
<a id="Colombia_and_Peru" name="Colombia_and_Peru"></a><h2>Colombia and Peru</h2>
<p>{{main}}
After several border conflicts between <a href="/wiki/Colombia" id="w">Colombia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peru" id="w">Peru</a> in the early part of the 20th century, a Peruvian take-over of the Colombian border town <a href="/wiki/Leticia%2C_Colombia" id="w">Leticia</a> on <a href="/wiki/1_September" id="w">1 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1932" id="w">1932</a>, resulted in an armed conflict between the two nations. After months of diplomatic wrangling, the two nations accepted mediation by the League of Nations. A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded. In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarization of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the <a href="/wiki/Amazon_River" id="w">Amazon River</a> and <a href="/wiki/Putumayo_River" id="w">Río Putumayo</a>, and a pledge of nonaggression.</p>
<a id="Other_successes" name="Other_successes"></a><h2>Other successes</h2>
<p>The League also worked to combat the international trade in <a href="/wiki/Opium" id="w">opium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sexual_slavery" id="w">sexual slavery</a> and helped alleviate the plight of <a href="/wiki/Refugee" id="w">refugees</a>, particularly in Turkey in the period to 1926. One of its innovations in this area was its 1922 introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Nansen_passport" id="w">Nansen passport</a>, which was the first internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees. Many of the League&#39;s successes were accomplished by its various Agencies and Commissions.</p>

<a id="General_weaknesses" name="General_weaknesses"></a><h1>General weaknesses</h1>
<p>The League did not, in the long term, succeed. The outbreak of World War II was the immediate cause of the League&#39;s demise, but there was also a variety of other, more fundamental, flaws.</p>
<p>The League, like the modern United Nations, lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the <a href="/wiki/Power_(international)" id="w">Great Powers</a> to enforce its resolutions, which they were very reluctant to do. <a href="/wiki/Economic_sanctions" id="w">Economic sanctions</a>, which were the most severe measure the League could implement short of military action, were difficult to enforce and had no great impact on the target country, because they could simply trade with those outside the League. The problem is exemplified in the following passage, taken from <i>The Essential Facts About the League of Nations</i>, a handbook published in <a href="/wiki/Geneva" id="w">Geneva</a> in 1939:</p>
<dl><dd><i>&#34;As regards the military sanctions provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 16, there is <b>no legal obligation</b> to apply them… there may be a political and moral duty incumbent on states… but, once again, there is no obligation on them.&#34;</i></dd></dl>
<p>The League&#39;s two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League. So soon after World War I, the populations and governments of the two countries were <a href="/wiki/Pacifism" id="w">pacifist</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)" id="w">British Conservatives</a> were especially tepid on the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of the organization. Ultimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of <a href="/wiki/Collective_security" id="w">collective security</a> in favour of <a href="/wiki/Appeasement" id="w">appeasement</a> in the face of growing German militarism under <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a>.</p>
<p>Representation at the League was often a problem. Though it was intended to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their time as part of the League was short. In January 1920 when the League began, Germany was not permitted to join, due to strong dislike to the country after World War I.  Soviet Russia was also banned from the League, as their communist views were not welcomed by the victors of World War I.  One key weakness of the League was that the United States never joined, which took away much of the League&#39;s potential power. Even though US President <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" id="w">Woodrow Wilson</a> had been a driving force behind the League&#39;s formation, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" id="w">United States Senate</a> voted on <a href="/wiki/November_19" id="w">November 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1919" id="w">1919</a> not to join the League.</p>
<p>The League also further weakened when some of the main powers left in the 1930s. <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its invasion of the Chinese territory of <a href="/wiki/Manchuria" id="w">Manchuria</a>. Italy also began as a permanent member of the Council but withdrew in 1937. The League had accepted Germany as a member in 1926, deeming it a &#34;peace-loving country,&#34; but <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a> pulled Germany out when he came to power in 1933.</p>
<p>Another major power, the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a>, was a member only from 1934, when it joined to antagonise Germany (which had left the year before), to <a href="/wiki/December_14" id="w">December 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1939" id="w">1939</a>, when it was expelled for <a href="/wiki/Winter_War" id="w">aggression against Finland</a>. In expelling the Soviet Union, the League broke its own norms. Only 7 out of 15 members of the Council voted for the expelling (Great Britain, France, Belgium, Bolivia, Egypt, South African Union and the Dominican Republic), which was not a majority of votes as was required by the Charter to do so. Three of these members were chosen as members of the Council the day before the voting (South African Union, Bolivia and Egypt).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The League of Nations practically ceased functioning after that and was formally dismissed in 1946.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The League&#39;s neutrality tended to manifest itself as indecision. The League required a unanimous vote of its nine (later fifteen) member Council to enact a resolution, so conclusive and effective action was difficult, if not impossible. It was also slow in coming to its decisions. Some decisions also required unanimous consent of the Assembly; that is, agreement by every member of the League.</p>
<p>Another important weakness of the League was that it tried to represent all nations, but most members protected their own national interests and were not committed to the League or its goals. The reluctance of all League members to use the option of military action showed this to the full. If the League had shown more resolve initially, countries, governments and dictators may have been more wary of risking its wrath in later years. These failings were, in part, among the reasons for the outbreak of World War II.</p>
<p>When the British Cabinet discussed the concept of the League during the Great War, <a href="/wiki/Maurice_Hankey" id="w">Maurice Hankey</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary" id="w">Cabinet Secretary</a>, circulated a memorandum on the subject. He started by saying: &#34;Generally it appears to me that any such scheme is dangerous to us, because it will create a sense of security which is wholly fictitious&#34;.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> He attacked the British pre-war faith in the sanctity of treaties as delusional and concluded by claiming:</p>
<p /><blockquote>&#34;It [a League of Nations] will only result in failure and the longer that failure is postponed the more certain it is that this country will have been lulled to sleep. It will put a very strong lever into the hands of the well-meaning idealists who are to be found in almost every Government, who deprecate expenditure on armaments, and, in the course of time, it will almost certainly result in this country being caught at a disadvantage&#34;.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>The Foreign Office minister Sir <a href="/wiki/Eyre_Crowe" id="w">Eyre Crowe</a> also wrote a memorandum to the British Cabinet claiming that &#34;a solemn league and covenant&#34; would just be &#34;a treaty, like other treaties&#34;: &#34;What is there to ensure that it will not, like other treaties, be broken?&#34;. Crowe went on to express scepticism of the planned &#34;pledge of common action&#34; against aggressors because he believed the actions of individual states would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power. He also criticised the proposal for League economic sanctions because it would ineffectual and that &#34;It is all a question of real military preponderance&#34;. Universal disarmament was a practical impossibility, Crowe warned.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, the League&#39;s advocacy of disarmament for Britain and France (and other members) whilst at the same time advocating collective security meant that the League was unwittingly depriving itself of the only forceful means by which its authority would be upheld. This was because if the League was to force countries to abide by international law it would primarily be the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" id="w">Royal Navy</a> and the <a href="/wiki/French_Army" id="w">French Army</a> which would do the fighting. Furthermore, Britain and France were not powerful enough to enforce international law across the globe, even if they wished to do so. For its members, League obligations meant there was a danger that states would get drawn into international disputes which did not directly affect their respective national interests.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/23_June" id="w">23 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a>, in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy&#39;s war of conquest against Abyssinia, <a href="/wiki/British_Prime_Minister" id="w">British Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Baldwin" id="w">Stanley Baldwin</a> told the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons" id="w">House of Commons</a> that <a href="/wiki/Collective_security" id="w">collective security</a> &#34;failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions.... [T]he real reason, or the main reason, was that we discovered in the process of weeks that there was no country except the aggressor country which was ready for war.... [I]f collective action is to be a reality and not merely a thing to be talked about, it means not only that every country is to be ready for war; but must be ready to go to war at once. That is a terrible thing, but it is an essential part of collective security.&#34;</p>

The city was divided into Polish Cieszyn and Czech <a href="/wiki/Česk%C3%BD_T%C4%9B%C5%A1%C3%ADn" id="w">Český Těšín</a>.

After World War I, Poland and <a href="/wiki/Lithuania" id="w">Lithuania</a> both regained the independence that they had lost during the <a href="/wiki/Partitions_of_Lithuanian-Polish_Commonwealth" id="w">partitions of Lithuanian-Polish Commonwealth</a> in 1795. Though both countries shared centuries of common history in the <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Union" id="w">Polish-Lithuanian Union</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" id="w">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, rising Lithuanian <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" id="w">nationalism</a> prevented the re-creation of the former federated state. The city of <a href="/wiki/Vilnius" id="w">Vilna</a> (<a href="/wiki/Lithuanian_language" id="w">Lithuanian</a> Vilnius, <a href="/wiki/Polish_language" id="w">Polish</a> Wilno) was made the capital of Lithuania. Although Vilnius had been the cultural and political center of Grand Duchy of Lithuania since 1323, it happened that the majority of the population in the 20th century was Polish.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Polish-Soviet_War" id="w">Polish-Soviet War</a> in 1920, a Polish army took control of the city. Despite the Poles&#39; claim to the city, the League chose to ask Poland to withdraw: the Poles did not. The city and its surroundings were proclaimed a separate state of <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Central_Lithuania" id="w">Central Lithuania</a> and on <a href="/wiki/20_February" id="w">20 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1922" id="w">1922</a> the local parliament passed the Unification Act and the city was incorporated into Poland as the capital of the <a href="/wiki/Wilno_Voivodship" id="w">Wilno Voivodship</a>. Theoretically, British and French troops could have been asked to enforce the League&#39;s decision; however, France did not wish to antagonise Poland, which was seen as a possible ally in a future war against Germany or the Soviet Union, while Britain was not prepared to act alone. Both Britain and France also wished to have Poland as a &#39;buffer zone&#39; between Europe and the possible threat from Communist Russia. Eventually, the League accepted Wilno as a Polish town on <a href="/wiki/March_15" id="w">March 15</a> <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a>. Thus the Poles were able to keep it until the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet</a> invasion in 1939.</p>
<p>Lithuanian authorities declined to accept the Polish authority over Vilna and treated it as a constitutional capital. It was not until the <a href="/wiki/1938_ultimatum" id="w">1938 ultimatum</a> that Lithuania resolved diplomatic relations with Poland and thus de facto accepted the borders of its neighbour.</p>

Under the Treaty of Versailles, Germany had to pay reparations. They could pay in money or in goods at a set value; however, in 1922 Germany was not able to make its payment. The next year, France and <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a> chose to act upon this, and invaded the industrial heartland of Germany, the <a href="/wiki/Ruhr_Area" id="w">Ruhr</a>, despite this being in direct violation of the League&#39;s rules. With France being a major League member, and Britain hesitant to oppose its close ally, nothing was done in the League. This set a significant precedent – the League rarely acted against major powers, and occasionally broke its own rules.</p>
<a id="Corfu%2C_1923" name="Corfu%2C_1923"></a><h2>Corfu, 1923</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>One major boundary settlement that remained to be made after World War I was that between <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a> and <a href="/wiki/Albania" id="w">Albania</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Conference_of_Ambassadors" id="w">Conference of Ambassadors</a>, a <i><a href="/wiki/De_facto" id="w">de facto</a></i> body of the League, was asked to settle the issue. The Council appointed <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italian</a> general <a href="/wiki/Enrico_Tellini" id="w">Enrico Tellini</a> to oversee this. On <a href="/wiki/27_August" id="w">27 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a>, while examining the Greek side of the border, Tellini and his staff were murdered. Italian leader <a href="/wiki/Benito_Mussolini" id="w">Benito Mussolini</a> was incensed, and demanded the Greeks pay reparations and execute the murderers. The Greeks refused.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/31_August" id="w">31 August</a>, Italian forces occupied the island of <a href="/wiki/Corfu" id="w">Corfu</a>, part of Greece, with fifteen people being killed. Initially, the League condemned Mussolini&#39;s invasion, but also recommended Greece pay compensation, to be held by the League until Tellini&#39;s killers were found. Mussolini, though he initially agreed to the League&#39;s terms, set about trying to change them. By working with the Council of Ambassadors, he managed to make the League change its decision. Greece was forced to apologize and compensation was to be paid directly and immediately. Mussolini was able to leave Corfu in triumph. By bowing to the pressure of a large country, the League again set a dangerous and damaging example. This was one of the League&#39;s major failures.</p>
<a id="Mukden_Incident%2C_1931%E2%80%931933" name="Mukden_Incident%2C_1931%E2%80%931933"></a><h2>Mukden Incident, 1931–1933</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Mukden_Incident" id="w">Mukden Incident</a> was one of the League&#39;s major setbacks and acted as the catalyst for <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>&#39;s withdrawal from the organization. In the Mukden Incident, also known as the &#34;Manchurian Incident&#34;, the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> held control of the <a href="/wiki/South_Manchurian_Railway" id="w">South Manchurian Railway</a> in the <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">Chinese</a> region of <a href="/wiki/Manchuria" id="w">Manchuria</a>. They claimed that Chinese soldiers had <a href="/wiki/Sabotage" id="w">sabotaged</a> the railway, which was a major trade route between the two countries, on <a href="/wiki/September_18" id="w">September 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1931" id="w">1931</a>. In fact, it is thought that the sabotage had been contrived by officers of the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Kwantung_Army" id="w">Kwantung Army</a> without the knowledge of government in Japan, in order to catalyse a full invasion of Manchuria. In retaliation, the Japanese army, acting contrary to the civilian government&#39;s orders, occupied the entire region of Manchuria, which they renamed <a href="/wiki/Manchukuo" id="w">Manchukuo</a>. This new country was recognised internationally by only Italy and Germany - the rest of the world still saw Manchuria as legally a region of China. In 1932, Japanese air and sea forces bombarded the Chinese city of <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" id="w">Shanghai</a> and the short war of <a href="/wiki/January_28_Incident" id="w">January 28 Incident</a> broke out.</p>
<p>The Chinese government asked the League of Nations for help, but the long voyage around the world by sailing ship for League officials to investigate the matter themselves delayed matters. When they arrived, the officials were confronted with Chinese assertions that the Japanese had invaded unlawfully, while the Japanese claimed they were acting to keep peace in the area. Despite Japan&#39;s high standing in the League, the <a href="/wiki/Lytton_Report" id="w">Lytton Report</a> declared Japan to be in the wrong and demanded Manchuria be returned to the Chinese. However, before the report was voted upon by the Assembly, Japan announced intentions to invade more of China. When the report passed 42-1 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan voted against), Japan withdrew from the League.</p>
<p>According to the <i>Covenant</i> of the League of Nations, the League should have now placed economic sanctions against Japan, or gathered an army together and declared war against it. However, neither happened. Economic sanctions had been rendered almost useless due to the United States Congress voting against being part of the League, despite <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" id="w">Woodrow Wilson</a>&#39;s keen involvement in the drawing up of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" id="w">Treaty of Versailles</a> and his wish for America to join the League. Any economic sanctions the League now placed on its member states would be fairly pointless, as the state barred from trading with other member states could simply turn and trade with America. An army was not assembled by the League due to the self-interest of many of its member states. This meant that countries like Britain and France did not want to gather together an army for the League to use as they were too interested and busy with their own affairs - such as keeping control of their extensive colonial lands, especially after the turmoil of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>. Japan was therefore left to keep control of Manchuria, until the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> took over the area and returned it to China at the end of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> in 1945.</p>
<a id="Chaco_War%2C_1932-1935" name="Chaco_War%2C_1932-1935"></a><h2>Chaco War, 1932-1935</h2>
<p>{{main}}
The League failed to prevent the Chaco War between <a href="/wiki/Bolivia" id="w">Bolivia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paraguay" id="w">Paraguay</a> in 1932 over the arid <a href="/wiki/Gran_Chaco" id="w">Gran Chaco</a> region of <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South America</a>. Although the region was sparsely populated, it gave control of the <a href="/wiki/Paraguay_River" id="w">Paraguay River</a> which would have given one of the two <a href="/wiki/Landlocked" id="w">landlocked</a> countries access to the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a>, and there was also speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" id="w">petroleum</a>. Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932, when the Bolivian army, following the orders of President <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Salamanca_Urey" id="w">Daniel Salamanca Urey</a>, attacked a Paraguayan garrison at <a href="/wiki/Vanguardia" id="w">Vanguardia</a>. Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations, but the League did not take action when the Pan-American conference offered to mediate instead.</p>
<p>The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 100,000 casualties and bringing both countries to the brink of economic disaster. By the time a ceasefire was negotiated on <a href="/wiki/12_June" id="w">12 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1935" id="w">1935</a>, Paraguay had seized control over most of the region. This was recognized in a 1938 truce by which Paraguay was awarded three-quarters of the Chaco Boreal.</p>
<a id="Italian_invasion_of_Abyssinia%2C_1935%E2%80%931936" name="Italian_invasion_of_Abyssinia%2C_1935%E2%80%931936"></a><h2>Italian invasion of Abyssinia, 1935–1936</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Perhaps most famously, in October 1935, Benito Mussolini sent General <a href="/wiki/Pietro_Badoglio" id="w">Pietro Badoglio</a> and 400,000 troops to invade <a href="/wiki/Abyssinia" id="w">Abyssinia</a> (Ethiopia). The modern <a href="/wiki/Italian_Army" id="w">Italian Army</a> easily defeated the poorly armed Abyssinians, and captured <a href="/wiki/Addis_Ababa" id="w">Addis Ababa</a> in May 1936, forcing Emperor <a href="/wiki/Haile_Selassie" id="w">Haile Selassie</a> to flee. The Italians used <a href="/wiki/Chemical_warfare" id="w">chemical weapons</a> (<a href="/wiki/Mustard_gas" id="w">mustard gas</a>) and flame throwers against the Abyssinians.</p>
<p>The League of Nations condemned Italy&#39;s aggression and imposed economic sanctions in November 1935, but the sanctions were largely ineffective. As Stanley Baldwin, the British Prime Minister, later observed, this was ultimately because no one had the military forces on hand to withstand an Italian attack. On <a href="/wiki/9_October" id="w">9 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1935" id="w">1935</a>, the United States (a non-League member) refused to cooperate with any League action. It had embargoed exports of arms and war material to either combatant (in accordance with its new Neutrality Act) on <a href="/wiki/5_October" id="w">5 October</a> and later (<a href="/wiki/29_February" id="w">29 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a>) endeavoured (with uncertain success) to limit exports of oil and other materials to normal peacetime levels. The League sanctions were lifted on <a href="/wiki/4_July" id="w">4 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a>, but by that point they were a dead letter in any event.</p>
<p>In December 1935, the <a href="/wiki/Hoare-Laval_Pact" id="w">Hoare-Laval Pact</a> was an attempt by the British <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_Affairs" id="w">Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</a> Hoare and the French Prime Minister Laval to end the conflict in Abyssinia by drawing up a plan to partition Abyssinia into two parts - an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the Pact; however, news of the Pact was leaked and both the British and French public venomously protested against the Pact, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and Laval were forced to resign their positions, and both the British and French government disassociated with them respectively.</p>
<p>As was the case with Japan, the vigour of the major powers in responding to the crisis in Abyssinia was tempered by their perception that the fate of this poor and far-off country, inhabited by non-Europeans, was not a central interest of theirs.</p>
<a id="Spanish_Civil_War%2C_1936%E2%80%931939" name="Spanish_Civil_War%2C_1936%E2%80%931939"></a><h2>Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939</h2>
<p>{{main}}
On <a href="/wiki/17_July" id="w">17 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a>, armed conflict broke out between Spanish <i>Republicans</i> (the left-wing government of Spain) and <i>Nationalists</i> (the right-wing rebels, including most officers of the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Army" id="w">Spanish Army</a>). <a href="/wiki/Alvarez_del_Vayo" id="w">Alvarez del Vayo</a>, the Spanish minister of foreign affairs, appealed to the League in September 1936 for arms to defend its territorial integrity and political independence. However, the League could not itself intervene in the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" id="w">Spanish Civil War</a> nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict. Hitler and Mussolini continued to aid <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Franco" id="w">General Franco</a>’s Nationalist insurrectionists, and the Soviet Union aided the Spanish loyalists. The League did attempt to ban the intervention of foreign national <a href="/wiki/International_Brigades" id="w">volunteers</a>.</p>
<a id="Axis_re-armament" name="Axis_re-armament"></a><h2>Axis re-armament</h2>
<p>The League was powerless and mostly silent in the face of major events leading to World War II such as Hitler&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Remilitarisation_of_the_Rhineland" id="w">remilitarisation of the Rhineland</a>, occupation of the <a href="/wiki/Sudetenland" id="w">Sudetenland</a> and <i><a href="/wiki/Anschluss" id="w">Anschluss</a></i> of <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austria</a>, which had been forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. As with Japan, both Germany in 1933 – using the failure of the <a href="/wiki/World_Disarmament_Conference" id="w">World Disarmament Conference</a> to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext – and Italy in 1937 simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgment. The League commissioner in <a href="/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk" id="w">Danzig</a> was unable to deal with German claims on the city, a significant contributing factor in the outbreak of World War II in 1939. The final significant act of the League was to expel the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> in December 1939 after it <a href="/wiki/Winter_War" id="w">invaded Finland</a>.</p>
<a id="Demise_and_legacy" name="Demise_and_legacy"></a><h1>Demise and legacy</h1>
<p>The final meeting of the League of Nations was held in Geneva on April 18, 1946.  Delegates from 34 nations attended, and a motion was made to close the session, with the resolution that &#34;The League of Nations shall cease to exist except for the purpose of the liquidation of its assets.&#34;  The vote was 33-0 in favor, with Egypt abstaining.  At 5:43 pm Geneva time, Secretary Carl J. Hambro of Norway stated, &#34;I declare the twenty-first and last session of the General Assembly of the League of Nations closed.&#34; <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>.  </p>
<p>With the onset of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, it had been clear that the League had failed in its purpose – to avoid any future world war. During the war, neither the League&#39;s Assembly nor Council had been able or willing to meet, and its secretariat in <a href="/wiki/Geneva" id="w">Geneva</a> had been reduced to a skeleton staff, with many offices moving to North America.  At the 1945 <a href="/wiki/Yalta_Conference" id="w">Yalta Conference</a>, the Allied Powers agreed to create a new body to supplant the League&#39;s role.  This body was to be the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a>.  Many League bodies, such as the <a href="/wiki/International_Labour_Organization" id="w">International Labour Organization</a>, continued to function and eventually became affiliated with the UN.  The League&#39;s assets of $22,000,000 were then assigned to the U.N. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The structure of the United Nations was intended to make it more effective than the League. The principal <a href="/wiki/Allies" id="w">Allies</a> in World War II (<a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a>, <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">USSR</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">U.S.</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China" id="w">China</a>) became permanent members of the <a href="/wiki/UN_Security_Council" id="w">UN Security Council</a>, giving the new &#34;Great Powers&#34; significant international influence, mirroring the League Council. Decisions of the UN Security Council are binding on all members of the UN; however, unanimous decisions are not required, unlike the League Council. Permanent members of the UN Security Council were given a shield to protect their vital interests, which has prevented the UN acting decisively in many cases. Similarly, the UN does not have its own standing armed forces, but the UN has been more successful than the League in calling for its members to contribute to armed interventions, such as the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" id="w">Korean War</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Peacekeeping" id="w">peacekeeping</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" id="w">former Yugoslavia</a>. However, the UN has in some cases been forced to rely on economic sanctions. The UN has also been more successful than the League in attracting members from the nations of the world, making it more representative.</p>
