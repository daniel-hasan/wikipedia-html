<b>Hurricane Epsilon</b> was a long lasting <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">hurricane</a> of the <a href="/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a> in late November and early December over the central <a href="/wiki/Atlantic" id="w">Atlantic</a>. Hurricane Epsilon was the twenty-seventh tropical or subtropical storm and the fifteenth hurricane of the season and was one of the strongest <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane" id="w">Atlantic hurricanes</a> ever recorded so late in the year.</p>
<p>Hurricane Epsilon developed from an <a href="/wiki/Extratropical" id="w">extratropical</a> storm on <a href="/wiki/November_29" id="w">November 29</a> and gradually developed into a hurricane on <a href="/wiki/December_2" id="w">December 2</a>, despite a highly hostile environment. Epsilon then held onto hurricane status for several more days, despite all predictions by the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a>, before finally dissipating on <a href="/wiki/December_8" id="w">December 8</a>.</p>

Tropical Storm Epsilon developed out of an <a href="/wiki/Extratropical" id="w">extratropical</a> storm in the central <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_29" id="w">November 29</a> that had gradually gained tropical characteristics in the wake of <a href="/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Delta_(2005)" id="w">Tropical Storm Delta</a>.<sup id="_ref-EpsilonTCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EpsilonTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup> It was well east of <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a> at the time and never would get close to land. Epsilon gradually strengthened into a strong tropical storm before it weakened slightly on <a href="/wiki/December_1" id="w">December 1</a>. The official forecasts from the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> predicted Epsilon would weaken further in the highly sheared environment before becoming an extratropical system again.<sup id="_ref-NHC-disc10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHC-disc10" title="">[2]</a></sup> Unexpectedly, Tropical Storm Epsilon strengthened again on <a href="/wiki/December_2" id="w">December 2</a> and became a hurricane over cooler waters averaging 21 &#8211; 24°C (70 &#8211; 75°F) and continuing shear, conditions that are highly unfavorable to maintaining a tropical cyclone. The official forecasts continued to predict weakening and eventual dissipation but Epsilon defied them and remained at hurricane strength for several days. At one point on <a href="/wiki/December_4" id="w">December 4</a> it was thought that Epsilon had briefly weakened into a tropical storm, but later re-analysis showed that it had remained a hurricane. Hurricane Epsilon then strengthened further to its peak intensity of 85 mph&#160;(135&#160;km/h) just hours later.<sup id="_ref-EpsilonTCR_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EpsilonTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Hurricane Epsilon frustrated the forecasters, and the lack of any weakening led <a href="/wiki/NOAA" id="w">NOAA</a> hurricane forecaster Dr. <a href="/wiki/Lixion_Avila" id="w">Lixion Avila</a> to say &#34;There are no clear reasons — and I am not going to make one up — to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon…&#34;<sup id="_ref-NHC-disc21_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHC-disc21" title="">[3]</a></sup> The storm maintained its hurricane status for five days while most of the six-hourly forecasts during that period called for it to weaken below that intensity.<sup id="_ref-TCD-summary_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TCD-summary" title="">[4]</a></sup> Dr. Avila also claimed that Epsilon had developed a structure similar to one of an <a href="/wiki/Annular_hurricane" id="w">annular hurricane</a>, which enabled it to maintain its strength despite poor conditions.<sup id="_ref-NHC-disc26_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHC-disc26" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a> a strong upper-level flow from the northwest disrupted the organization of Hurricane Epsilon. The continuing shear then finally weakened it into a tropical storm that day. It quickly weakened further into a tropical depression on <a href="/wiki/December_8" id="w">December 8</a> and dissipated shortly thereafter.<sup id="_ref-EpsilonTCR_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EpsilonTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Impact_and_records" name="Impact_and_records"></a><h2>Impact and records</h2>
<p>As Hurricane Epsilon stayed well out to sea and never approached land, no <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches" id="w">warnings or watches</a> were issued. No ships reported experiencing tropical storm force winds from Epsilon and there were no reports of damages or fatalities.<sup id="_ref-EpsilonTCR_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EpsilonTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Tropical Storm Epsilon formed on <a href="/wiki/November_29" id="w">November 29</a>, it was the first known time that twenty-seven tropical or subtropical storms had formed in the Atlantic during one hurricane season. Hurricane Epsilon was only the sixth ever <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane" id="w">Atlantic hurricane</a> recorded in December. Epsilon also spent more time as a hurricane during December than any other Atlantic storm (beating the old record held by <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Lili_(1984)" id="w">Hurricane Lili</a> of 1984).<sup id="_ref-EpsilonTCR_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EpsilonTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup> Along with Lili, Epsilon was also one of only four known Atlantic tropical cyclones to strengthen into a hurricane in December.</p>
