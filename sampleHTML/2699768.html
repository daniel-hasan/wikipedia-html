<b>Tadhg Kennelly</b> (born <a href="/wiki/1_July" id="w">1 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1981" id="w">1981</a>) is a former <a href="/wiki/Gaelic_football" id="w">Gaelic football</a> player from <a href="/wiki/Listowel" id="w">Listowel</a>, <a href="/wiki/County_Kerry" id="w">County Kerry</a>, who is now a backline <a href="/wiki/Australian_rules_football" id="w">Australian rules football</a> player for the <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Swans" id="w">Sydney Swans</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Football_League" id="w">AFL</a>.  He is the son of <a href="/wiki/Tim_Kennelly" id="w">Tim Kennelly</a>, a former All-Ireland winner with <a href="/wiki/Kerry_GAA" id="w">Kerry</a>. Although often mispronounced as &#34;Tie&#34; in Australia, Kennelly&#39;s first name is in fact pronounced &#34;Tie-g&#34;. It is often described as the Irish language translation of the the English language name Timothy but in fact the two names are probably not related. </p>
<p>After his debut in 2001 (following elevation from the <a href="/wiki/AFL_Draft" id="w">rookie list</a>), he now is a permanent fixture in the Sydney line-up as a dashing rebound defender, wearing the no. 17 guernsey. He was second (behind <a href="/wiki/Leo_Barry" id="w">Leo Barry</a>) for <a href="/wiki/Rebound_(sports)" id="w">rebounds</a> (77) from the defensive <a href="/wiki/50-metre_arc" id="w">50-metre arc</a> in 2004. Tadhg has become a high-profile member of the Swans outfit, well-known for his exciting play, his nationality and his &#34;Talking With Tadhg&#34; articles on the Swans&#39; website.</p>
<p>Kennelly became the first <a href="/wiki/Irishman" id="w">Irishman</a> to win an <a href="/wiki/Australian_Football_League" id="w">AFL</a> premiership medal in 2005, after playing all 26 games for the <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Swans" id="w">Sydney Swans</a> that year. The hype surrounding Kennelly&#39;s appearance in the <a href="/wiki/AFL_Grand_Final" id="w">AFL Grand Final</a> was so much that <a href="/wiki/Network_Ten" id="w">Network Ten</a> sent out its usual game-day <a href="/wiki/Boundary_rider_(sport)" id="w">boundary rider</a>, <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Maher" id="w">Andrew Maher</a>, over to <a href="/wiki/County_Kerry" id="w">County Kerry</a> to visit Tadhg&#39;s family for the week and watch the Grand Final with them. </p>
<p>In December 2005, Kennelly&#39;s father <a href="/wiki/Tim_Kennelly" id="w">Tim</a> died suddenly at age 51.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/kennellys_champion_irish_dad_dies_after_being_there_for_tadghsswansfairytale/2005/12/07/1133829661245.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/kennellys_champion_irish_dad_dies_after_being_there_for_tadghsswansfairytale/2005/12/07/1133829661245.html">http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/kennellys_champion_irish_dad_dies_after_being_there_for_tadghsswansfairytale/2005/12/07/1133829661245.html</a> Kennelly has always expressed a desire to return home to Ireland and leave the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Football_League" id="w">AFL</a>, he has indicated a desire to emulate the success of his father and win an <a href="/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship" id="w">All-Ireland Senior Football Championship</a> medal with his native <a href="/wiki/County_Kerry" id="w">County Kerry</a>. It is believed his father&#39;s death may have some bearing on that decision.</p>
<p>On the last day of August, 2006, Tadhg Kennelly ended months of speculation by announcing he would be staying on with the Swans for a further 3 years. Kennelly says this will be his last AFL contract and will be returning to Ireland to live at the end of the three year contract. </p>
<p>There has been a recent movement amongst Sydney Swans fans to persuade Tadhg to change his mind and see out his football career in Sydney. One in particular, Colm MacGowan of Melbourne, had created a group on Facebook titled &#34;Keep Kennelly at the Swans&#34;.
