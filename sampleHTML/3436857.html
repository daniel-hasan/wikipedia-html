{{History of Ethiopia}}
<b>Aksumite currency</b> was the only native <a href="/wiki/Currency" id="w">currency</a> to be issued in <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a> without direct influence by an outside culture like the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Romans</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" id="w">Greeks</a>. It was issued and circulated from the middle of the height of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum" id="w">Kingdom of Aksum</a> under <a href="/wiki/Kings_of_Axum" id="w">King</a> <a href="/wiki/Endubis" id="w">Endubis</a> around AD <a href="/wiki/270" id="w">270</a> until it began its decline in the first half of the 7th century. No <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" id="w">sub-Saharan</a> state would mint coins after Aksum until the <a href="/wiki/Kilwa_Sultanate" id="w">Kilwa Sultanate</a> in the tenth century.<sup id="_ref-Munro150_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro150" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Aksum&#39;s currency served as a vessel of propaganda demonstrating the kingdom&#39;s wealth and promoting the national religion (first polytheistic and later <a href="/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox" id="w">Oriental Christianity</a>), as well as facilitating the Red Sea trade on which it thrived.<sup id="_ref-Munro155_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro155" title="">[2]</a></sup> The coinage has also proved invaluable in providing a reliable chronology of Aksumite kings due to the lack of extensive archaeological work in the area.<sup id="_ref-Encyc767_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc767" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Pre-coinage_period" name="Pre-coinage_period"></a><h2>Pre-coinage period</h2>
<p>Though the issuing of minted coins didn&#39;t begin until around 270, metal coins may have been used in Aksum centuries prior to centralized minting. The <i><a href="/wiki/Periplus_of_the_Erythraean_Sea" id="w">Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</a></i> mentions that the Aksumite state imported brass (<a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Gr.</a> <i>orokhalkos</i>), &#34;which they use[d] for ornaments and for cutting as money&#34;, and they imported &#34;a little money (<i>denarion</i>) for [use by] foreigners who live there.&#34; It can be inferred, therefore, that early Aksumite kings, located on the international trading waters of the <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" id="w">Red Sea</a>, recognized the utility of a standardized currency for facilitating both domestic and international trade.<sup id="_ref-Munro151_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro151" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Influences" name="Influences"></a><h2>Influences</h2>
<p>Though Aksumite coins are indigenous in design and creation, some outside influences encouraging the use of coins is undeniable. By the time coins were first minted in Aksum, there was widespread trade with <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Romans</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Red_sea" id="w">Red sea</a>; <a href="/wiki/Kushana" id="w">Kushana</a> or <a href="/wiki/Persia" id="w">Persian</a> influence also cannot be ruled out. Roman, <a href="/wiki/Himyar" id="w">Himyarite</a>, and Kushana coins have all been found in major Aksumite cities, however, only very small quantities have been attested and the circulation of foreign currency seems to have been limited.<sup id="_ref-Munro152_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro152" title="">[5]</a></sup> Though <a href="/wiki/South_Arabia" id="w">South Arabian</a> kingdoms had also minted coins, they had already gone out of use by the time of certain Aksumite involvement in South Arabia under <a href="/wiki/GDRT" id="w">GDRT</a>, and only very rarely produced <a href="/wiki/Electrum" id="w">electrum</a> or <a href="/wiki/Gold_coins" id="w">gold</a> denominations (<a href="/wiki/Silver_coins" id="w">silver</a> mainly in <a href="/wiki/Sabaeans" id="w">Saba&#39;</a> and Himyar, while <a href="/wiki/Bronze" id="w">bronze</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hadhramaut" id="w">Hadhramaut</a>), making influence unlikely. The major impetus, however, was not emulation but economical; the Red sea and its coasts had always been an international trade area and coins would greatly facilitate trade and wealth in the now &#34;world power.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Munro150_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro150" title="">[1]</a></sup> Despite these influences, the coins were of genuinely indigenous design, and foreign influences were relatively weak and few in number.<sup id="_ref-Encyc768_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc768" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Pre-Christian_period" name="Pre-Christian_period"></a><h1>Pre-Christian period</h1>
<p>Aksumite currency came in the later stages of the growth of the empire when its <a href="/wiki/Golden_age" id="w">golden age</a> had already begun. The minting of coins began around 270, beginning with the reign of Endubis.</p>
<a id="Source_of_materials" name="Source_of_materials"></a><h1>Source of materials</h1>
<a id="Gold" name="Gold"></a><h2>Gold</h2>
<p>Gold seems to have been acquired from a number of sources. Gold probably came from <i>Sasu</i> (southern <a href="/wiki/Sudan" id="w">Sudan</a>), as well as more nearby <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" id="w">Ethiopian</a> sources, though the latter isn&#39;t well documentated for the north. A gold trade from the southern areas of Ethiopia such as the medieval province/kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Innarya" id="w">Innarya</a> has been attested from the 6th century (i.e. from the writings of <a href="/wiki/Cosmas_Indicopleustes" id="w">Cosmas Indicopleustes</a>) and continued through <a href="/wiki/James_Bruce" id="w">James Bruce</a>&#39;s day (18th c.). Gold also came from more northerly sources such as <a href="/wiki/Gojjam" id="w">Gojjam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beja_people" id="w">Beja</a> lands, and what is now <a href="/wiki/Eritrea" id="w">Eritrea</a>, though the latter two are less certain.<sup id="_ref-Munro143_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro143" title="">[7]</a></sup> However, a recent gold exploration assay in Eritrea has found significant gold deposits at <a href="/wiki/Emba_Derho" id="w">Emba Derho</a>, and deposits are also attested at <a href="/wiki/Zara" id="w">Zara</a> in central-western Eritrea.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Silver_and_others" name="Silver_and_others"></a><h2>Silver and others</h2>
<p>While local sources of gold are attested during the Aksumite era, <a href="/wiki/Silver" id="w">silver</a> seems to have been rarer in Aksum. No mention of silver mines in the region exist until the 15th and 16th centuries. Though silver was imported as attested by the <i>Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</i>,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> given the preponderance of silver coins, it could not have been the only source of silver in Aksum. Furthermore, a significant number of the silver coins contain gold inlays (presumably to increase the value), which would have been unnecessary if silver were so rare that it had to be mainly imported.<sup id="_ref-Munro143_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro143" title="">[7]</a></sup> Silver may have been obtained from the refinement of gold, which sometimes occurs naturally with silver in an alloy called <a href="/wiki/Electrum" id="w">electrum</a>.<sup id="_ref-Encyc767_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc767" title="">[3]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Copper" id="w">Copper</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bronze" id="w">bronze</a> do not seem to have existed locally in the Aksumite empire, though they were noted as imports in the <i>Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</i>.<sup id="_ref-Munro143_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro143" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Value" name="Value"></a><h1>Value</h1>
<p>Though the gold coins were certainly the most valuable issue, followed by the silver one, the exact relationship between the three issues (gold, silver, and bronze) is not known. The supply of gold was closely controlled by the Aksumite state, as noted by Cosmas Indicopleustes, and other precious metals were undoubtedly also closely controlled, allowing the Aksumite state to ensure the usage of its currency. <sup id="_ref-Munro154_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro154" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The quality of the Aksumite coins were also closely controlled, usually of high purity. For example, the lowest purity of gold recorded thus far for Aphilas is 90%.<sup id="_ref-Munro159_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro159" title="">[11]</a></sup> Early issues were often very close to their theoretical weights, and some were even over.<sup id="_ref-Munro158_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro158" title="">[12]</a></sup>) However, the weight of the coins tended to decrease over time (though not continuously or uniformly).<sup id="_ref-Encyc767_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc767" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Munro159_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro159" title="">[11]</a></sup> This may have reflected a desire to conform to the Diocletian monetary reform of 312, when the <a href="/wiki/Aureus" id="w">aureus</a> was decreased from 1/60th of a pound to 1/72nd. Despite decreases in weight, the purity of the gold was largely maintained, even by later kings. The abundance of relative abundant Aksumite coins as well as the many that have yet to be found<sup id="_ref-Percent_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Percent" title="">[13]</a></sup> indicate that Aksum must have had access to large quantities of gold.<sup id="_ref-Munro159_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro159" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

The coins were often inscribed in <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a>, as much of its trade was with the &#34;Graecised Orient.&#34; Later inscriptions would make more use of <a href="/wiki/Ge%26%2339%3Bez_language" id="w">Ge&#39;ez</a>, the language of the Aksumites, perhaps indicating a decline in its use for more international trade (i.e. with Rome and India). The obverse of the coins would always feature an image of the king (almost always in profile) wearing either a crown or helmet/regnal headcloth. The headcloth had some image perhaps representing pleats, rays, or sunburst in the front, as well as the tied end of a cloth or fillet to hold the helmet or headcloth in place. Most coins also included an inscription (usually in Greek) meaning &#34;King of Aksum&#34; or King of the Aksumites&#34; (<i>Basileus AXWMITW</i>).<sup id="_ref-Munro154_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro154" title="">[10]</a></sup> However, many coins were also minted anonymously (or even posthumously), especially during the 5th century.<sup id="_ref-Encyc767_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc767" title="">[3]</a></sup> Inscriptions on the coins could include a <i>bisi</i> name (&#34;man of,&#34; <a href="/wiki/Ge%26%2339%3Bez_language" id="w">Ge&#39;ez</a> bə&#39;əsyä ብእስየ<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>) or an epithet (beginning with <i>Əllä</i>, Ge&#39;ez እለ &#34;he who&#34;) in addition to the king&#39;s personal name. <i>Bisi</i> names were used more often in conjuncture with personal names on earlier coins, while the epithets were more common in later years, being the only inscribed name in a few sources.<sup id="_ref-Encyc767_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc767" title="">[3]</a></sup> Greek text was used in conjunction with <a href="/wiki/Ge%26%2339%3Bez_alphabet" id="w">Ge&#39;ez</a> inscriptions, but was the only language used on the gold coins, with the exception of the <a href="/wiki/Ge%26%2339%3Bez_language" id="w">Ge&#39;ez language</a> coins of <a href="/wiki/Wazeba" id="w">Wazeba</a> and <a href="/wiki/MHDYS" id="w">MHDYS</a>. Over time, the Greek used on the coins (gold, silver and bronze) deteriorated, indicative of Aksum&#39;s decline. Moreover, beginning with <a href="/wiki/MHDYS" id="w">MHDYS</a> for bronze coins and Wazeba for silver coins, Ge&#39;ez gradually replaced Greek on the legends.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Mottoes" name="Mottoes"></a><h2>Mottoes</h2>
<p>Aksumite coins used a number of mottoes throughout the period in which they were minted, beginning in the early 4th century. Around this time, numerous anonymous bronze coins with simply <i>Βασιλεύς</i> (Basileus, &#34;King&#34;) on the obverse were minted by either <a href="/wiki/Ezana_of_Axum" id="w">King Ezana</a> or one of his successors. The coins bore the first example of an Aksumite motto on the reverse, &#34;May this please the people&#34; (<a href="/wiki/Greek_alphabet" id="w">Greek</a> TOYTOAPECHTHXWPA). It was later written in unvocalized Ge&#39;ez as &#34;ለሐዘበ ፡ ዘየደአ&#34; <i>LʾḤZB ZYDʾ</i> and under <a href="/wiki/Kaleb_of_Axum" id="w">King Kaleb</a> also &#34;ለሀገረ ፡ ዘየደአ&#34; <i>LHGR ZYDʾ</i>, &#34;may this please the city [country].&#34; Similar mottoes were used by other kings. Coins of the early 7th century Emperor <a href="/wiki/Armah" id="w">Armah</a> had inscribed on the back &#34;ፈሰሐ ፡ ለየከነ ፡ ለአዘሐበ&#34; <i>FŚḤ LYKN LʾḤZB</i> (vocalization: ፍሥሓ ፡ ለይኲን ፡ ለአሕዛብ ፡ <i>fiśśiḥā la-yikʷin la-&#39;aḥzāb</i>, &#34;Gladness let there be to the peoples&#34;).<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

Endubis, the first known <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum" id="w">Aksumite</a> king to mint coins, focused almost entirely on his image on both the obverse and reverse. The images were of his head and upper half of his chest in profile, wearing a regnal headcloth or helmet and abundant jewelry.  In addition to inscribing his regnal name, Endubis also noted his &#34;<i>bisi</i> name, a practice continued by his early successors, but often missing in later coins. The <i>bisi</i> name was a sort of tribal affiliation or &#34;ethnikon&#34; (i.e. a reference to the king&#39;s lineage) that was different for every king.<sup id="_ref-Munro154_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro154" title="">[10]</a></sup> Endubis also emphasized his religion through the pre-Christian symbol of the disk and crescent as a propaganda method (a purpose which the coins already served). A second motif used by Endubis and continued by following coins was that of two (though sometimes one in later years) ears of barley or wheat around the image of his head in profile. Though no inscriptional evidence exists, given its prominent position around the image of the king, the two ears of barley (or wheat) may have been representative symbols of the Aksumite state.<sup id="_ref-Munro155_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro155" title="">[2]</a></sup> Though later coins would be smaller, Endubis chose the Roman aureus to standardize Aksumite coin weights against, with gold issues at half-aureus around 2.70 grams (more precisely, the theoretical weight may have been 2.725g<sup id="_ref-Munro159_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro159" title="">[11]</a></sup>).<sup id="_ref-Munro154_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro154" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

Whereas all of Endubis&#39;s coins feature the king with a headcloth or helmet, Aphilas&#39;s coins show the king wearing an impressive high crown on top of the headcloth. The crown featured colonnades of arches supporting high spikes, on top of which rested large discs of unidentified composition. In addition to the crown and headcloth, Aphilas&#39;s coins included further images of regalia, such as a spear, a branch with berries, the depiction of the arms, the addition of tassels with fringes to the imperial robe, and more jewelry, such as amulets and bracelets. Despite this innovation, Aphilas continued to use the image of himself in the regnal headcloth in some coins, sometimes as the reverse, while his crowned image is only found on the obverse.<sup id="_ref-Munro156_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro156" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of his issues included his frontal image on the obverse, which ended with his reign and was only revived by the late kings. Two other minting features of Aphilas were also abandoned by later rulers.  One of these was the use of just the inscription &#34;King Aphilas&#34; as the reverse of a coin, the only purely epigraphical side ever used on an Aksumite coin. The other was his use of a single ear of barely or wheat as a reverse, though his use of two ears circling around the king&#39;s image continued.<sup id="_ref-Munro158_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro158" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Aphilas introduced a number of different standards for all three metals, some of which lasted through to the 7th century, while the use of others ended with his reign. His new gold coins (issued in conjunction with the older) of a quarter aureus and eighth aureus were soon abandoned (each are known from only one specimen), and 1/16th aureus coins have been found, though these are more likely to be deliberate debasements to increase profit (Aksumite gold was generally very pure, however<sup id="_ref-Munro159_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro159" title="">[11]</a></sup>).<sup id="_ref-Munro157_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro157" title="">[19]</a></sup> Aphilas&#39;s silver coin, however, issued at half the weight of the former, became the new Aksumite standard for silver up until the end of coinage. The older coin was presumably more valuable than needed, and the new coin remedied the problem. Aphilas&#39;s bronze issue, however, was instead doubled to 4.83 grams. The coin&#39;s rarity may attest to its quick withdrawal from the market, as is assumed with his quarter-aureus. These two issues are the only one of Aphilas&#39;s issues to portray him frontally, rather than in profile.<sup id="_ref-Munro158_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro158" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

During Ezana&#39;s reign a major change in both the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum" id="w">Aksumite kingdom</a> and its coinage took place as a result of the change of the official religion to <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a>, one of the first states ever to do so. While Ezana&#39;s coins in the first half of his reign are almost identical to thos of Aphilas, barring minimal weight reductions, those of his second half employ revolutionary designs. With his conversion to Christianity, Ezana began to feature the <a href="/wiki/Christian_cross" id="w">Cross</a> on his coins, the first time the Christian cross had ever been featured in coinage in the world. Some of his gold Christian coins are of the weight before <a href="/wiki/Constantine_I" id="w">Constantine I</a>&#39;s weight reform in 324, indicating a conversion before this date or perhaps a few years after, as the Aksumite coinage may not have changed weights immediately.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Along with the adoption of the Cross on his coins came, of course, the abandonment of the <a href="/wiki/Star_and_crescent" id="w">star and crescent</a> symbol on the coins.

<a id="Silver_coinage" name="Silver_coinage"></a><h2>Silver coinage</h2>
<p>Also starting with Endubis these coins were 2.11-2.5 grams in weight which is half the weight of a Roman <a href="/wiki/Antoninianus" id="w">antoninianus</a> of 3.5-4.5 <a href="/wiki/Gram" id="w">grams</a>. A <a href="/wiki/Denarius" id="w">Denarius</a> in the early 3rd century was 2.5-3.00 grams of 52% or less of silver, but the Aksum coins were almost pure silver at first later debased. The name is unknown so it is referred to as an <a href="/wiki/AR" id="w">AR</a> Unit.

<a id="Base_coinage" name="Base_coinage"></a><h2>Base coinage</h2>
<p>Most bronze and silver coins have mainly been found in Aksum territory with very few pieces found in <a href="/wiki/Judea" id="w">Judea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Meroe" id="w">Meroe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>. They are based roughlty on the size of older Roman <a href="/wiki/As_(coin)" id="w">As</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sestertius" id="w">Sestertius</a> in shape and thickness. The design also developed like Roman coins in first being good but then the pictures turn archaic and non recognisable. The name is unknown so it is referred to as a <a href="/wiki/AE" id="w">AE</a> diameter im mm Unit, like AE17 for a coin of 17 mm.

<a id="Trade" name="Trade"></a><h1>Trade</h1>
<p>At the time of Aksum&#39;s minting of currency, the state already had a long trade history with Greece, Rome, the Persian Empire, and India. That coinage began so late is in fact a little surprising. The late use of coinage may be attributed to the lack of a developed economy, required for coinage to be accepted.<sup id="_ref-Munro150_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro150" title="">[1]</a></sup> Most Aksumite coins were found in the large trade centres with very few in remote villages, where trade would be more through <a href="/wiki/Barter" id="w">barter</a> and not coinage based.<sup id="_ref-Munro152_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro152" title="">[5]</a></sup> In fact, the motivation for Aksum&#39;s initial minting of coins was for foreign trade and markets, as evidenced by the use of Greek on most of its coins.<sup id="_ref-Munro154_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro154" title="">[10]</a></sup> Moreover, gold coins seem to have been intended primarily for external trade, while copper and silver coins probably mainly circulated within the Aksumite empire, as the gold issues generally specified &#34;king of the Aksumites&#34; as title of the Aksumite king, whereas the title of silver and copper issues generally only read &#34;king.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Munro153_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro153" title="">[23]</a></sup> International use of Aksumite coins seems to have begun early on, as coins of King Ezana and even of King Aphilas (the second Aksumite ruler to issue coins) have been found in India.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Decline" name="Decline"></a><h1>Decline</h1>
<p>During the 7th century, Aksumite power began to fail, and Ethiopian society began to withdraw further into the <a href="/wiki/Ethiopian_highlands" id="w">highland hinterlands</a>, with the coastal areas becoming peripheral areas (whereas <a href="/wiki/Adulis" id="w">Adulis</a> on the coast was once the <a href="/wiki/Second_city" id="w">second city</a> of Aksum). The coins continued circulation, but were restricted to more local areas such as <a href="/wiki/Nubia" id="w">Nubia</a>, South Arabia and the <a href="/wiki/Horn_of_Africa" id="w">Horn of Africa</a>.</p>
<a id="Archaeology" name="Archaeology"></a><h1>Archaeology</h1>
<p>Due to the nature of the coins (e.g. providing kings&#39; names), they have proved essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum. An estimated 98% of the city of <a href="/wiki/Axum" id="w">Aksum</a> <sup id="_ref-IslamO_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IslamO" title="">[25]</a></sup> remains unexcavated, and other areas even more so. Through analysis of the number of coins produced and the style of coins, archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology, generally agreed upon until the late 6th and 7th century kings. Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins, inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two, who happen to be the most famous kings: <a href="/wiki/Ezana_of_Axum" id="w">Ezana</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kaleb_of_Axum" id="w">Kaleb</a>, both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity during the height of the Aksumite kingdom.<sup id="_ref-Encyc767_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc767" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many coins have been found in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, the central region of Aksum, though Aksumite coins are reported to have been found in <a href="/wiki/Arato" id="w">Arato</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lalibela" id="w">Lalibela</a>.<sup id="_ref-Munro152_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro152" title="">[5]</a></sup> Many coins have been also found further afield. Numerous hoards of coins (always gold save one silver coin) have been found in Southern Arabia, much more than in Aksum itself, attesting perhaps to an Aksumite presence in parts of the region (perhaps supporting the use of titles claiming control over parts of South Arabia from <a href="/wiki/GDRT" id="w">GDRT</a>&#39;s time). The hoards may be the remnants of hoards left in Kaleb&#39;s time (perhaps used to pay soldiers), when it was under an Aksumite governor. Outside of the <a href="/wiki/Horn_of_Africa" id="w">Horn of Africa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arabian_peninsula" id="w">Arabian peninsula</a>, coins have been found as far as <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Meroe" id="w">Meroe</a>, Egypt, and India.<sup id="_ref-Munro153_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Munro153" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Encyc768_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc768" title="">[6]</a></sup> Silver and copper coins are mainly found in Aksum, though some can be traced to <a href="/wiki/Palestine" id="w">Palestinian</a> pilgrim centers.<sup id="_ref-Encyc768_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc768" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to historical evidence, the coins&#39; use of Ge&#39;ez provides valuable linguistic information. Though rarely used, the <a href="/wiki/Ge%26%2339%3Bez_alphabet" id="w">vocalization of Ge&#39;ez</a> sometimes employed on Aksumite coins allows linguists to analyze vowel changes and shifts that cannot be represented in the older <a href="/wiki/Semitic_languages" id="w">Semitic</a> <a href="/wiki/Abjad" id="w">abjads</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language" id="w">Hebrew</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arabic_language" id="w">Arabic</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Arabian_alphabet" id="w">South Arabian</a>, and earlier, unvocalized Ge&#39;ez.<sup id="_ref-Encyc768_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyc768" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
