<p>The <b>Ozark School District #14</b> is a <a href="/wiki/School_district" id="w">public school district</a> in western <a href="/wiki/Arkansas" id="w">Arkansas</a> serving most of northern <a href="/wiki/Franklin_County%2C_Arkansas" id="w">Franklin County</a> and a small portion of western <a href="/wiki/Johnson_County%2C_Arkansas" id="w">Johnson County</a>.  The district is a member of the <b>Western Arkansas Educational Service Cooperative</b>, which includes districts in western Arkansas.  As of 2004, the student population of the district was about 1600.  It is important to note that the above figure was tallied before the <a href="/wiki/Altus-Denning_School_District" id="w">Altus-Denning School District</a> merged with this district the same year, making future tallies notably higher.  The district, most notably the high school,  is most famous for its mascot, the <a href="/wiki/Hillbilly" id="w">Hillbilly</a>.  Patrons claim that Ozark is the only district in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">Union</a> with the Hillbilly as its mascot, though both the nickname and comparable likenesses are used by other schools.  However, Ozark is the only district to use the nickname and likeness together.</p>

<a id="Mascot_and_Colors" name="Mascot_and_Colors"></a><h2>Mascot and Colors</h2>
<p>The school emblem (mascot) and <a href="/wiki/School_colors" id="w">colors</a> have been shared by all schools in the district.  The <b><a href="/wiki/Hillbilly" id="w">Hillbilly</a></b>, which is almost always depicted in purple overalls and armed with a <a href="/wiki/Shotgun" id="w">shotgun</a>, was adopted as the school emblem in 1935.  <b>Purple and gold</b> were adopted as the school colors the same year, replacing the red and white that had been used.  It&#39;s important to note that the mascot and colors were similar to that of what was then the <a href="/wiki/University_of_the_Ozarks" id="w">College of the Ozarks</a>, whose mascot was the Mountaineer until the 1980s.</p>
