The <b>Houston Independent School District (HISD)</b> is the largest <a href="/wiki/Public_school" id="w">public school</a> system in <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a> and the seventh-largest in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Houston ISD serves as a community <a href="/wiki/School_district" id="w">school district</a> for most of the city of <a href="/wiki/Houston" id="w">Houston</a> and several nearby and insular municipalities.</p>
<p>In the 2004â€“2005 school year, HISD had 302 campuses, approximately 209,000 students and over 12,000 teachers. With over 30,000 employees, HISD is one of the largest employers in the city of <a href="/wiki/Houston" id="w">Houston</a>.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>Houston ISD was established in the <a href="/wiki/1920s" id="w">1920s</a>, after the Texas Legislature voted to separate school and municipal governments. Houston ISD replaced the <a href="/wiki/Harrisburg_School_District_(Texas)" id="w">Harrisburg School District</a>.</p>
<p>Houston ISD absorbed portions of the <a href="/wiki/White_Oak_Independent_School_District_(Harris_County%2C_Texas)" id="w">White Oak Independent School District</a> in <a href="/wiki/1937" id="w">1937</a> and portions of the <a href="/wiki/Addicks_Independent_School_District" id="w">Addicks Independent School District</a> after its dissolution.</p>
<p>Houston ISD was desegregated by <a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>. Some <a href="/wiki/Hispanic" id="w">Hispanics</a> felt they were being discriminated against when they were being put with only <a href="/wiki/African_Americans" id="w">African Americans</a> as part of the desegregation plan, so many took their children out of the schools and put them in &#34;huelgas,&#34; or protest schools, until a ruling in <a href="/wiki/1973" id="w">1973</a> satisfied their demands.</p>
<a id="Secession_movements" name="Secession_movements"></a><h2>Secession movements</h2>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1977" id="w">1977</a>, group of citizens in western Houston tried to form Westheimer Independent School District out of a portion of Houston ISD. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fifth_Circuit" id="w">United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> rejected the appeals after formation of the district was denied.</p>
<p>HISD once served the Harris County portion of <a href="/wiki/Stafford%2C_Texas" id="w">Stafford</a>, until the <a href="/wiki/Stafford_Municipal_School_District" id="w">Stafford Municipal School District</a> was established in <a href="/wiki/1982" id="w">1982</a> to serve the entire city of Stafford. Most of Stafford was in <a href="/wiki/Fort_Bend_ISD" id="w">Fort Bend ISD</a>, with a small amount in Houston ISD.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Hurricane_Katrina" name="Hurricane_Katrina"></a><h2>Hurricane Katrina</h2>
<p>In 2005, HISD enrolled evacuees from the areas affected by <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" id="w">Hurricane Katrina</a> who were residing in Houston. The <a href="/wiki/Houston_Astrodome" id="w">Houston Astrodome</a>, the shelter used for hurricane evacuees, is located within the HISD boundaries.</p>
<p>Many Katrina evacuees stayed for the long term within the Houston ISD boundaries. Walnut Bend Elementary School&#39;s enrollment jumped from around 600 to around 800 with the addition of 184 evacuees; Walnut Bend, out of all of the Houston-area elementary schools, has taken in the most Katrina victims <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>. Nearby Paul Revere Middle School, located in the <a href="/wiki/Westchase%2C_Houston%2C_Texas" id="w">Westchase</a> district, gained 137 Katrina victims. Revere, out of all of the Houston-area middle schools, has taken in the most Katrina victims.</p>
<p>Houston ISD&#39;s &#34;West Region,&#34; which includes Walnut Bend and Revere, had about 1/5th of Houston ISD&#39;s schools but contained more than half of the 5,500 evacuees in Houston schools.</p>
<p>At the start of the 2006-2007 school year, around 2,900 Hurricane Katrina evacuees were still enrolled in Houston ISD schools. Around 700 of them were held back due to poor academic performance. 41% of evacuee 10th graders and 52% of evacuee juniors were held back.</p>
<p>According to the October 2006 &#34;For Your Information&#34; newsletter, the eleven HISD schools which took the largest number of evacuees were:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Elementary schools: Bonham, Foerster, McNamara, Walnut Bend</li>
<li>Middle schools: Fondren, Revere, <a href="/wiki/Sharpstown_Middle_School" id="w">Sharpstown Middle</a></li>
<li>High schools: <a href="/wiki/Lee_High_School_(Houston)" id="w">Lee</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sharpstown_High_School" id="w">Sharpstown High</a>, <a href="/wiki/Westbury_High_School_(Houston)" id="w">Westbury</a>, <a href="/wiki/Westside_High_School_(Houston)" id="w">Westside</a></li></ul>
<a id="New_district_organization" name="New_district_organization"></a><h2>New district organization</h2>
<p>Prior to Summer 2005, HISD had 13 administrative districts.  Originally, the number of districts were to be cut to three, but HISD decided on cutting the number to five in fall 2005.</p>
<a id="New_administration_building" name="New_administration_building"></a><h2>New administration building</h2>
<p>Houston ISD&#39;s administration building from July 1970 to March 2006 was the Hattie Mae White Administration Building (located at 3830 Richmond Avenue), and was labelled the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Taj_Mahal" id="w">Taj Mahal</a>&#34; due to the confusing layout of the complex. The 201,150 square foot complex cost six million <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">United States dollars</a>. The building had tropical indoor <a href="/wiki/Atrium_(architecture)" id="w">atriums</a>, causing critics to criticize the spending priorities of the district. When the district considered cutting a popular <a href="/wiki/Kindergarten" id="w">kindergarten</a> program for financial reasons, taxpayers voted many board members out of office.</p>
<p>The administration moved into a new complex in northwest Houston (located at 4400 West 18th Street) in spring 2006. The district sold the old complex for $38 million to a company which plans to demolish the site and develop mixed-use commercial property; demolition began on <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>. Demolition crews demolished the Will Rogers Elementary School, an adjacent elementary school located at 3101 Weslayan that closed in spring 2006.</p>
<p>Houston ISD named the new administration building &#34;Hattie Mae White Educational Support Center&#34;.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The preliminary fall enrollment for the 2006-2007 school year (203,163) had 7,000 fewer students than the 2005-2006 student enrollment (210,202), resulting in a more than 3% loss; the 2006-2007 enrollment was a 2.5% decrease from the fall 2004-2005 enrollment (208,454). From the preliminary 2006-2007 student count, the West and Central regions lost the most students, with a combined 4,400 student loss.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The enrollment reported for the year in February 2007 was 202,936.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>


<a id="Bilingual_education_and_magnet_and_Vanguard_schools" name="Bilingual_education_and_magnet_and_Vanguard_schools"></a><h1>Bilingual education and magnet and Vanguard schools</h1>
<p>HISD is highly regarded for the <a href="/wiki/Bilingual_education" id="w">bilingual education</a> of its predominantly <a href="/wiki/Hispanic" id="w">Hispanic</a> student body, including recruiting about 330 teachers from <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Central_America" id="w">Central</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South America</a>, <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rico" id="w">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippines</a> from 1998 to 2007 <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>HISD&#39;s magnet (Performing Arts, Science, Health Professions, Law Enforcement, etc) high schools are considered a model for other urban school districts as a way to provide a high quality education and keep top performing students in the inner city from fleeing to <a href="/wiki/Private_school" id="w">private schools</a> or <a href="/wiki/Exurb" id="w">exurban</a> school districts. Magnet schools are popular with parents and students that wish to escape low-performing schools and school violence.

<p>A <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">The New York Times</a></i> report which asserted that HISD did not report school violence to the police created controversy in the community as teachers, students, and parents expressed concern about the district&#39;s downplaying of campus violence. <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> HISD officials held a news conference after the publication of the story. During the conference, HISD asserted that <i>The New York Times</i> published the story in an attempt to discredit the <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush_administration" id="w">Bush administration</a>&#39;s new accountability standards for school districts nationwide, which were partly modeled after HISD&#39;s system.</p>
<a id="School_performance" name="School_performance"></a><h2>School performance</h2>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a> state audit of HISD&#39;s performance caused more controversy. One of the district&#39;s most publicized accomplishments during the Paige era was a dramatic reduction in dropout rates. When 16 secondary schools, including <a href="/wiki/Sharpstown_High_School" id="w">Sharpstown High School</a>, were audited, it was found that most of the students who left school from those schools in 2000-2001 should have been counted as dropouts, but were not <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>. It was found that the administrators at Sharpstown deliberately changed the dropout rate at the school. The Sharpstown controversy resulted in a recommendation to label the entire HISD as &#34;unacceptable.&#34; Former Sharpstown Assistant Principal Robert Kimball, found by an external investigator to have been involved in the false reporting, asserts that HISD coerced administrators at many schools to lie on dropout rates. HISD asserts that the fraud is only contained to Sharpstown, and that the false statistics at other schools were caused by confusion related to the state&#39;s system of tracking students who leave school. To improve data quality and regain its accountability rating, HISD altered its record-keeping training for school officials and sent teams of auditors into schools to check records. The superintendent met frequently with principals to press for improved data quality, and a districtwide data-integrity team monitored results.</p>
