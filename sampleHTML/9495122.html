The <b>February 2007 North America Winter Storm</b> (otherwise referred to as the <b>Valentine&#39;s Day Blizzard</b> or <b>Valentine&#39;s Day Storm</b>) was a massive <a href="/wiki/Winter_storm" id="w">winter storm</a> that affected most of the eastern half of <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a>, starting on <a href="/wiki/February_12" id="w">February 12</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> and peaking on <a href="/wiki/Valentine%26%2339%3Bs_Day" id="w">Valentine&#39;s Day</a>, <a href="/wiki/February_14" id="w">February 14</a>. The storm produced heavy snowfalls across the <a href="/wiki/Midwestern_United_States" id="w">midwestern United States</a> from <a href="/wiki/Nebraska" id="w">Nebraska</a> to <a href="/wiki/Ohio" id="w">Ohio</a> and produced similar conditions across parts of the <a href="/wiki/Northeastern_United_States" id="w">northeastern United States</a>,  and into Canada in <a href="/wiki/Ontario" id="w">Ontario</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quebec" id="w">Quebec</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_Brunswick" id="w">New Brunswick</a>. Significant <a href="/wiki/Sleet" id="w">sleet</a> and <a href="/wiki/Freezing_rain" id="w">freezing rain</a> fell across the southern <a href="/wiki/Ohio_Valley" id="w">Ohio Valley</a> and affected portions of the east coast of the United States, including the cities of <a href="/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Boston</a>, <a href="/wiki/Baltimore" id="w">Baltimore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Washington_D.C." id="w">Washington D.C.</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> and <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" id="w">Philadelphia</a>. </p>
<p>The southern portion of the storm produced severe thunderstorms with numerous tornadoes reported. One tornado hit a subdivision of <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana" id="w">New Orleans</a> that was still recovering from the effects of <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" id="w">Hurricane Katrina</a>, which hit the region in August 2005. In total, this storm system was responsible for 37 deaths across 13 U.S. states and Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec. The NOAA classified the storm as a Category 3 &#34;Major&#34; storm.<sup id="_ref-storm_category_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-storm_category" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The National Weather Service has determined that this storm was one of the three largest snowstorms to hit the inland areas of the northeastern United States since 1940.<sup id="_ref-storm_recordbooks_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-storm_recordbooks" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In sharp contrast to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak <a href="/wiki/Alberta_Clipper" id="w">Alberta Clippers</a> crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the <a href="/wiki/Jet_stream" id="w">jet stream</a> favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, led to the development of the storm.</p>
<p>Previously, portions of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Lakes" id="w">Great Lakes</a> were hit by a significant <a href="/wiki/Lake_effect_snow" id="w">lake effect snow</a> event which dumped incredible amounts of snow over portions of central New York. Several areas received over 115 inches (over 250 cm) of snow in a ten-day period just before the large winter storm as northwesterly winds and unfrozen lake surfaces due to the early winter warm weather favored the heavy snowfall. Several areas across <a href="/wiki/Michigan" id="w">Michigan</a> and Ontario also received significant amounts of snow with locally 1 meter of snow (3.3 feet) east of <a href="/wiki/Georgian_Bay" id="w">Georgian Bay</a> in Ontario.<sup id="_ref-cnn_newyork_squalls_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cnn_newyork_squalls" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Areas of the Appalachian Mountains in northern New England and Quebec received accumulations of over 16 inches (40 cm) with local amount exceeding 3 feet (90 cm) in parts of Vermont and 42 inches (105 cm)  in the <a href="/wiki/Adirondacks" id="w">Adirondacks</a> in New York State.

The City of Hamilton and the Niagara region, at their highest elevations, received just over 27.6 inches (70 cm) due to snowsqualls off of Lake Ontario. <a href="/wiki/Burlington%2C_Vermont" id="w">Burlington, Vermont</a> recorded record 24-hour snowfall, with 25.3 inches.<sup id="_ref-burlington_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-burlington" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>A notable feature of the system was its array of precipitation type. While the interior sections of the Northeast received mostly snow from the system, the Mid-Atlantic received snow, sleet, freezing rain and non-freezing rain. Due to the three-dimensional nature of the atmosphere, warm air was poised to overtake the cold air closer to the ground, causing precipitation to melt, then refreeze as either sleet or freezing rain.  As temperatures hovered around freezing on the southern edge of the storm track, light snow accompanied freezing rain and sleet. The freezing rain coated all surfaces with thick layers of ice, including power lines and tree limbs which break under the additional weight. Some locations in the Mid-Atlantic received several inches of sleet. Four inches of sleet caused travel difficulties and hampered cleanup efforts in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>. New York City&#39;s sanitation department admitted to not plowing city streets, expecting the frozen precipitation to change from ice to rain. However, this never happened. Instead, Temperatures dropped very quickly and caused the slush on sidewalks and roads to freeze into thick, rock hard sheets of ice.
Streets were almost impassable during the evening rush hour resulting in complete chaos.
