<p>Jerson Ravelo currently resides in Newark, N.J. with his son Jerson Jr. While many fighters pressure their children, particularly their namesakes, into following their fistic footsteps, Ravelo doesn&#39;t want that for his son.</p>
<p>&#34;I&#39;m doing this for my son and my family. As of right now, he doesn&#39;t even show no interest in boxing, which is good.&#34;</p>
<p>Ravelo&#39;s favorite fighter is Roy Jones Jr. &#34;The way he fights, the things that he&#39;s done are incredible&#34; says Ravelo. &#34;A lot of people don&#39;t give him credit. They talk about he never fought anybody, but like he said in his song, he just made them look like nobodies.&#34;</p>

<p>Ravelo was the 1998 <a href="/wiki/National_Golden_Gloves" id="w">National Golden Gloves</a> Middleweight champion. Ravelo also represented the <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Republic" id="w">Dominican Republic</a> as a Middleweight at the 2000 Syndey Olympic games, he was eliminated in the opening round by <a href="/wiki/Paul_Miller" id="w">Paul Miller</a> of Australia, on an 8-7 decision. </p>

<p>Upon turning professional, Ravelo signed a promotional deal with Lou Dibella&#39;s Dibella Entertainment. He made his debut as a professional on <a href="/wiki/January_27" id="w">January 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a> in <a href="/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden" id="w">Madison Square Garden</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>, where he defeated <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">America</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Miguel_Gutierrez" id="w">Miguel Gutierrez</a>. He became the first 2000 Olympian to reach double digit wins as a pro. In 2004 Ravelo was upset by <a href="/wiki/David_Alfonso_Lopez" id="w">David Alfonso Lopez</a> by TKO. </p>
<p>Ravelo says, &#34;Before that fight I didn&#39;t want to fight anymore. I didn&#39;t have no confidence because that was prior to me getting the surgeries and that was when I was coming back. It helped me come back to get my confidence back up and come back to reality. Before that fight, I was walking on a cloud.&#34;</p>
<p>Numerous injuries to his back and right hand hampered his career, and he didn&#39;t see any action in the year 2005 as a result.
In that time period, things soured with Jerson&#39;s promotional situation. The contract contained a clause stating that if Jerson was injured for over a year, Dibella Entertainment could terminate the contract. Ravelo was subsequentally released by Dibella.</p>
<p>&#34;Once a fighter has back problems&#34;, says Ravelo, &#34;he&#39;s always going to have back problems. I can go 6 months, a year without feeling my back at all. But I can wake up one day and for a week my back will be hurting me.&#34;</p>
<p>In 2006, Jerson signed a promotional contract with <a href="/wiki/The_Contender" id="w">The Contender</a> Group. &#34;They care about their fighters,&#34; Ravelo said. &#34;They&#39;re not trying to make a quick buck out of a fighter, they&#39;re looking long term.&#34; Returning from substantial layoffs, Ravelo reeled off three consecutive first round knockouts.</p>
<p>The next order of business was a showdown with then-undefeated <a href="/wiki/Allan_Green" id="w">Allan Green</a> of Tulsa, Oklahoma on October 14, 2006. Jerson was stopped in the eighth round. In that fight, Ravelo suffered another injury to his right hand.</p>
<p>Ravelo rebounded in 2007 with a unanimous decision over England&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Paul_Buchannan" id="w">Paul Buchannan</a>, whom he knocked down in the third round. That fight was a part of <a href="/wiki/The_Contender%26%2339%3Bs_USA_versus_UK" id="w">The Contender&#39;s USA versus UK</a> special.</p>
<p>Ravelo has gone through a who&#39;s who of trainers in his career, including <a href="/wiki/Mark_Breland" id="w">Mark Breland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Brooks" id="w">Tommy Brooks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Parks" id="w">Tommy Parks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Murray" id="w">Charles Murray</a>, Anthony Ham, Bouie Fischer and <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Suarez" id="w">Oscar Suarez</a>. He is currently trained by Nettles Nasser, who also guides <a href="/wiki/Henry_Crawford" id="w">Henry Crawford</a> and <a href="/wiki/Omar_Sheika" id="w">Omar Sheika</a>.</p>
<p>Of Nasser, Ravelo says, &#34;He&#39;s a good trainer. He teaches the right things. He tells you what to do. He motivates his fighters. I know he don&#39;t get a lot of credit because he&#39;s young. I think he&#39;s one of the better coaches out there.&#34;</p>
<p>Ravelo&#39;s current record stands at 18-2 (12 KO).</p>
