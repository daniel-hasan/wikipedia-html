The <b>meteorological history of Hurricane Ivan</b>, the longest tracked <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">tropical cyclone</a> of the <a href="/wiki/2004_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">2004 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, lasted from late August through late September. The hurricane developed from a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> that moved off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>. Tracking westward due to a <a href="/wiki/Ridge_(meteorology)" id="w">ridge</a>, favorable conditions allowed it to develop into Tropical Depression Nine on <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a> in the deep tropical <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a>. The cyclone gradually intensified until <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">September 5</a>, when it underwent <a href="/wiki/Rapid_deepening" id="w">rapid deepening</a> and reached Category 4 status on the <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale</a>; at the time Ivan was the southernmost <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales" id="w">major</a> <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane" id="w">hurricane</a> on record.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Ivan" id="w">Ivan</a> quickly weakened due to dry air, but it gradually reorganized, passing just south of <a href="/wiki/Grenada" id="w">Grenada</a> as a major hurricane on <a href="/wiki/September_7" id="w">September 7</a>. The hurricane attained <a href="/wiki/List_of_Category_5_Atlantic_hurricanes" id="w">Category 5</a> status in the central <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" id="w">Caribbean Sea</a>. Over the subsequent days its intensity fluctuated largely due to <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)" id="w">eyewall replacement cycles</a>, and Ivan passed just south of <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" id="w">Jamaica</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Cayman_Islands" id="w">Cayman Islands</a>, and western <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a> with winds at or slightly below Category 5 status. Turning northward and encountering unfavorable conditions, Ivan gradually weakened before making <a href="/wiki/Landfall_(meteorology)" id="w">landfall</a> just west of <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Shores%2C_Alabama" id="w">Gulf Shores, Alabama</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a> with winds of 120&#160;mph (195&#160;km/h). The cyclone quickly weakened to tropical depression status as it turned to the northeast, and Ivan transitioned into an <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" id="w">extratropical cyclone</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_18" id="w">September 18</a>.</p>
<p>The remnant low of Ivan turned to the south and southwest, and after crossing <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_21" id="w">September 21</a> it began to reacquire tropical characteristics. It became a tropical depression again on <a href="/wiki/September_22" id="w">September 22</a> to the southeast of <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a>, and Ivan reached winds of 60&#160;mph (95&#160;km/h) before weakening and moving ashore along southwestern Louisiana as a tropical depression; the circulation of Ivan dissipated after crossing into <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_25" id="w">September 25</a>. The cyclone broke several intensity records, and its duration was the tenth longest on record for an Atlantic hurricane.</p>

On <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>, a large <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> moved off the west coast of <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a>.

Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated the low redeveloped into Tropical Depression Ivan late on <a href="/wiki/September_22" id="w">September 22</a> while located about 175&#160;miles (280&#160;km) south-southeast of the mouth of the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_t" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In its first advisory on the re-developed cyclone, the National Hurricane Center classified the system Ivan <i>after considerable and sometimes animated in-house discussion of [its demise]... in the midst of a low-pressure and surface frontal system over the eastern United States... based primarily on the reasonable continuity observed in the analysis of the surface and low-level circulation.</i><sup id="_ref-disc67_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc67" title="">[27]</a></sup> Despite unfavorable shear and its disorganized cloud structure, the cyclone intensified to tropical storm status early on <a href="/wiki/September_23" id="w">September 23</a>, based on Hurricane Hunter reports.<sup id="_ref-disc68_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc68" title="">[28]</a></sup> As an area of deep convection developed over the center, Ivan reached winds of 60&#160;mph (95&#160;km/h),<sup id="_ref-disc70_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc70" title="">[29]</a></sup> though the winds decreased as thunderstorm activity diminished.<sup id="_ref-disc71_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc71" title="">[30]</a></sup> Ivan weakened to a tropical depression at 0000&#160;UTC on <a href="/wiki/September_24" id="w">September 24</a>, and two hours later it moved ashore near <a href="/wiki/Holly_Beach%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Holly Beach, Louisiana</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_u" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> Initial computer models forecasted the low-level circulation to turn southwestward and re-emerge into the Gulf of Mexico.<sup id="_ref-disc71_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-disc71" title="">[30]</a></sup> However, the storm rapidly weakened over land, and by 1200&#160;UTC on <a href="/wiki/September_24" id="w">September 24</a> Ivan degenerated into a remnant low pressure area over southeastern <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a>.<sup id="_ref-tcr_v" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tcr" title="">[1]</a></sup> The low turned to the south<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> and the circulation dissipated early on <a href="/wiki/September_25" id="w">September 25</a>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> The remnant trough reached the northwestern Gulf of Mexico later that day, briefly producing scatter thunderstorms<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> before it diminished.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
