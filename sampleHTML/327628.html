<p>The <b>Greco-Persian Wars</b> were a series of conflicts between several <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" id="w">Greek</a> city-states and the <a href="/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire" id="w">Persian Empire</a> that started in <a href="/wiki/499_BC" id="w">499 BC</a> and lasted until <a href="/wiki/448_BC" id="w">448 BC</a>.

Not all Greeks fought against the Persians; some were neutral and others allied with Persia, especially as its massive armies approached. </p>

By 493 BC, the last holdouts of the rebellion were subjugated by the Persian fleet, containing ships from Egypt and Phoenicia.The revolt was used as an opportunity by <a href="/wiki/Darius_the_Great" id="w">Darius the Great</a> to extend the empire&#39;s border to the islands of the East Aegean and the <a href="/wiki/Propontis" id="w">Propontis</a>, many of which had not been under the Persians before.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> While the Ionian city of Miletus was sacked, its temples stripped and population resettled,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> the other Ionian city-states found the Persians surprisingly conciliatory in the wake of the rebellion. Darius took direct control of the resettlement of the region through his son-in-law Mardonius. The flat-tribute system was replaced with a progressive tax based on the land-holdings of each city, democracies were established in some, if not all, of the Ionian city-states, prisoners were reintegrated into their home cities, and Darius actively encouraged the Persian nobility of the area to participate in Greek religious practices, especially those dealing with Apollo.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>  Records from the period indicate that the Persian and Greek nobility began to intermarry, and the children of Persian nobles were given Greek instead of Persian names. Darius&#39; conciliatory policies were used as a type of propaganda campaign against the mainland Greeks, so that in 491 BC, when Darius sent heralds throughout Greece demanding submission (<a href="/wiki/Earth_and_water" id="w">earth and water</a>), initially most city-states accepted the offer, Athens and Sparta being the most prominent exceptions.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Mardonius'_Campaign" name="Mardonius'_Campaign"></a><h3>Mardonius&#39; Campaign</h3>
<p>In the spring of <a href="/wiki/492_BC" id="w">492 BC</a>, an expeditionary force commanded by Darius&#39; son-in-law <a href="/wiki/Mardonius" id="w">Mardonius</a> was assembled in <a href="/wiki/Cilicia" id="w">Cilicia</a>. The objective was to subdue as many as they could of the Hellenic cities. Mardonius sent his army to the <a href="/wiki/Hellespont" id="w">Hellespont</a> while he took the fleet up the Aegean coast to Ionia. There he removed the tyrants and established popular governments in the Ionian cities.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> </p>
<p>From thence Mardonius continued on to the Hellespont and when his army and fleet had been assembled crossed the Hellespont into <a href="/wiki/Thrace" id="w">Thrace</a> and <a href="/wiki/Macedon" id="w">Macedon</a>, (both of which had been previously part of the Persian Empire before the Ionian revolt), subjugating all the people on his path. Thrace, which surrendered without defending themselves, was reorganized as a satrapy, and Macedonia was reduced from an ally to a client state. </p>
<p>The Vrygians, a local Thracian tribe, offered the strongest resistance, even managing in a daring night raid to wound Mardonius, but were eventually subjugated.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile the fleet conquered <a href="/wiki/Thassos" id="w">Thassos</a> and reached Acanthus (in the isthmus of the Athos peninsula) but while attempting to round the peninsula was nearly destroyed in a storm off <a href="/wiki/Mt._Athos" id="w">Mt. Athos</a>. 300 ships and 20,000 men were lost. Mardonius thus ordered the remnants of his troop to return to the Asian side of the Aegean.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Battle_of_Marathon" name="Battle_of_Marathon"></a><h4>Battle of Marathon</h4>
<p>{{Main}}</p>
<p>On the advice of Hippias, son of the former tyrant of Athens <a href="/wiki/Peisistratos_(Athens)" id="w">Peisistratus</a>, the Persian army landed in <a href="/wiki/Attica%2C_Greece" id="w">Attica</a> near <a href="/wiki/Marathon%2C_Greece" id="w">Marathon</a>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Modern sources estimate they were between 20,000 and 60,000 strong.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Pheidippides" id="w">Pheidippides</a>, a professional messenger, was sent by the Athenians to <a href="/wiki/Sparta" id="w">Sparta</a> for aid but the Spartans were prevented from leaving the city, either because of a religious festival (the <a href="/wiki/Karneia" id="w">Karneia</a>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> or because of a <a href="/wiki/Helot" id="w">helot</a> revolt mentioned by Plato.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Thus the only ally the <a href="/wiki/Athenians" id="w">Athenians</a> had in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon" id="w">Battle of Marathon</a> were the <a href="/wiki/Plataea" id="w">Plataeans</a>, with whom Athens had formed an alliance since the late <a href="/wiki/Sixth_century_BC" id="w">sixth century BC</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Miltiades, the Greek commander, marched his army of about 20,000 to Marathon to meet the invading force. After a period of about five days, the delay of which was probably beneficial to the Greeks as they had access to better supplies while the Persians supplies were being depleted as time went by, Miltiades ordered his forces to attack at a run. The rapid advance prevented the Persian archers taking position and loosing their arrows from afar. Miltiades knew that in hand to hand combat the Greek hoplite was superior. In spite of the rapid advance the centre of the Greek formation maintained formation and as the Persian centre counterattacked the Greeks who retreated in order. The Greek wings then closed in. They were able to defeat their opposites and join force behind the Persian centre, encircling it. A great slaughter followed.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> 600 dead Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield and buried against only 192 Athenian<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> and 420 Plataean dead.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Legend has it that a runner, after the battle, was sent as a messenger from Marathon to Athens to tell them the Athenians had been victorious. He cried &#34;Νενικήκαμεν!&#34; (We have been victorious!), then collapsed and died on the spot. This legend was the inspiration for the modern day Olympic event, the <a href="/wiki/Marathon" id="w">marathon</a>.</p>
<p>After the battle the Persian commanders had been given a signal of a raised shield and, hoping to catch Athens undefended, sailed with their fleet around Cape Sounion and tried to land at Phaleron. Athenian leaders had also seen the signal and, after leaving two tribes to guard the battlefield quickly moved the remaining forces into Athens. When the Persian came to Phaleron they found the Athenian army waiting for them. After this, the Persian fleet picked up the Eretrian prisoners and sailed back to Asia in defeat.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

The effects of the battle of Marathon were dramatic for both sides of the conflict.  The Athenians had proven their ability to fight and win against the Persian forces, which was indeed no small feat if Herodotus&#39;s words are to be accepted. As Cornelius Nepos said:</p>
<p><i>Than this battle there has hitherto been none more glorious; for never did so small a band overthrow so numerous a host</i> (Miltiades chapter IV, Translated by the Rev. John Selby Watson, MA)</p>
<p>The Greeks saw that they had the option to stand and fight, and soon after Marathon a number of city-states renounced their submission to Persia and joined with the Athenians and Spartans.</p>
<p>Perhaps more important was the impact Marathon had upon the Persians.  Marathon was the first defeat of regular Persian infantry forces since before the reign of Cyrus, over two generations before.  While the Ionian rebellion, the Persian inadequacy at sea, and the burning of Sardis all constituted a threat to Persian holdings in the region, Marathon signaled a threat to the whole of the Western part of the empire.  While the Persians had been unable to beat the Ionians at sea, the conflict had been settled by the superior Persian ground forces.  Now, with the defeat of the regular Persian infantry, the Persians had found themselves bested on land and sea by the relatively small city-state of Athens.</p>

<a id="Persian_Empire" name="Persian_Empire"></a><h3>Persian Empire</h3>
<p>After the defeat at Marathon Darius ordered all the cities of his vast empire to provide warriors, ships, horses and provisions to raise a great army for a third invasion but before he was ready to attack ( in 486 BC) an insurrection broke out in Egypt forcing a delay. In the next year Darius died after a reign of thirty-six years. His only failure in his life was that he could not capture Greece. His son and successor, Xerxes I was at first preoccupied with squashing the revolt in Egypt and a later one in Babylon before he could turn his attention westward to the European side of the Aegean. It wasn&#39;t until 480 BC that the expedition was ready to proceed. His only failure was also, as his fathers was, that he could not capture Greece.</p>
<p>The Persians had the sympathy of a number of Greek city-states,<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> including <a href="/wiki/Argos" id="w">Argos</a>, which had pledged to defect when the Persians reached their borders.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> The Alevades family that ruled <a href="/wiki/Larissa" id="w">Larissa</a> in <a href="/wiki/Thessaly" id="w">Thessaly</a> saw the invasion as an opportunity to extend their power.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Thebes%2C_Greece" id="w">Thebes</a> was willing to pass to the Persian side when Xerxes&#39; army reached their borders, and did so immediately following Thermopylae, though Herodotus hints that at Thermopylae it was already well known that Thebes had capitulated.</p>
<a id="Greek_City_States" name="Greek_City_States"></a><h3>Greek City States</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Macedon" id="w">Alexander I of Macedon</a>, who had supported the Greeks during the Ionian revolt had been forced to submit to Persia after the Mardonius&#39; Campaign. He was sympathetic to the Hellenic side, however, and sent valuable information to the Greeks regarding Xerxes plans and movements. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Leonidas_I" id="w">Leonidas I</a> assumed the throne of Sparta about 488 BC, succeeding his brother. </p>
<p>In Athens the hero of Marathon, Miltiades, convinced the Athenians to campaign in the Cyclades Islands in order to secure their frontier.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> His expedition failed and he was sorely wounded. His failure prompted an outcry on his return to Athens, enabling his political rivals to exploit his fall from grace.

<p>A new political leadership formed in Athens with Themistocles leading the democratic party and <a href="/wiki/Aristides" id="w">Aristides</a> the aristocratic party. <a href="/wiki/Ostracism" id="w">Ostracism</a> was first exercised in <a href="/wiki/488_BC" id="w">488 BC</a><sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> leading to the exile of politicians who advocated submission to Persia. </p>
<p>During this time Athens was at war with <a href="/wiki/Aegina" id="w">Aegina</a>.The ability of the Aeginian fleet to land unopposed at will in Attica and conduct raids led to public discontent. Themistocles convinced his fellow citizens to use the profits from the <a href="/wiki/Lavrion" id="w">Lavrion</a> silver mines to construct a fleet.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Alarm came to Greece after the Persian preparations had advanced to the construction of the bridges at Hellespontus and the channel at Athos.</p>

<a id="Size_of_the_Persian_Forces" name="Size_of_the_Persian_Forces"></a><h3>Size of the Persian Forces</h3>
<p>The numbers regarding the land and sea force Xerxes mustered for the invasion against Greece have been a subject of endless dispute. Modern scholars tend to reject the figures given in ancient texts as a result of miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors. The topic has been hotly debated but the general consensus revolves around the figure of 200,000.<sup id="_ref-souza_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-souza" title="">[51]</a></sup> Some place the upper limit at 250,000 total land forces. Others place even these numbers as too high.</p>
<p>The size of the Persian fleet is also disputed. According to Herodotus the Persian fleet numbered 1,207 triremes and 3,000 ships with 50 oars. <i><a href="/wiki/Galley#Penteconters" id="w">penteconter</a></i> (Greek πεντηκοντήρ) Many modern scholars concur with this number</p>

<p>Two bridges were constructed across the Hellespont made of Egyptian and Phoenician ships but they were destroyed by storm. Thus two new bridges were constructed, one of 314 <a href="/wiki/Triremes" id="w">triremes</a>, the other of 360. The army took seven days and nights to cross to the European side. One of the bridges was used by foot soldiers and the other by cavalry. Five major food depots had been set up along the path: at Lefki Akti on the Thracian side of the Hellespont, at <a href="/wiki/Tyrozis" id="w">Tyrozis</a> on lake <a href="/wiki/Bistonis" id="w">Bistonis</a>, at Doriskos at the <a href="/wiki/Evros_River" id="w">Evros river</a> estuary where the Asian army was linked up with the <a href="/wiki/Balkan" id="w">Balkan</a> allies, at <a href="/wiki/Eion" id="w">Eion</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Strymon_River" id="w">Strymon river</a> and at Therme, modern-day <a href="/wiki/Thessaloniki" id="w">Thessaloniki</a>. There, food had been sent from Asia for several years in preparation for the campaign. Animals had been bought and fattened, while the local populations had been ordered for several months to grind the grains into flour.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Persian army took 3 1/2 months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme, a journey of about 600 kilometres or 360 miles. It paused at Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet. Xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> A canal was dug over the isthmus of the Athos peninsula large enough to fit through two ships at a time, by which the fleet avoided the perilous journey around Cape Athos.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> </p>
<p>From there, the Persian fleet traveled down the coast, capturing a few Greek ships that were sent to monitor its movements.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> It fell into a storm off Mt. Pelion, between Casthanaia and Cape Sepias, which caused the loss of one third of the fleet.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> This was seen as divine retribution by the Greeks, reportedly lifting the morale of the allied force. </p>
<p>Battered from the storm, the Persian fleet rested at Aphetes.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> and rejoined the army at Therme.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> </p>

A force of 10,000 Athenians and Spartans led by Euenetus and <a href="/wiki/Themistocles" id="w">Themistocles</a> was dispatched to the <a href="/wiki/Vale_of_Tempe" id="w">vale of Tempe</a> between Thessaly and Macedon after a call by Thessalian cities that disliked the Alevades.  It arrived there traveling by ship to <a href="/wiki/Phthiotis" id="w">Phthiotis</a> and from there by land. There they blocked the pass, but were joined by few Thessalian horsemen. <a href="/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Macedon" id="w">Alexander I of Macedon</a> warned the allied force that Xerxes intended to pass through another pass, so they left the way they came. This happened at the time Xerxes was still at Abydos.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> All of Thessaly then defected to the Persians, as did many cities north of Thermopylae when they saw that help was not to come. It took Xerxes 13 days to travel from Therme to Thermopylae.</p>
<p>At Thermopylae, a force was assembled led by King <a href="/wiki/Leonidas_I" id="w">Leonidas</a> of Sparta who was only accompanied by the <a href="/wiki/300_Spartans" id="w">300 Spartans</a>, literally horsemen though they fought on foot and served as the royal bodyguard.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> </p>
<dl><dd><i>His general Artapanus, with 10,000 men, fought an engagement with Leonidas, the Spartan general, at Thermopylae; the Persian host was cut to pieces, while only two or three of the Spartans were slain.

The next day he ordered an attack with 50,000, but without success, and accordingly ceased operations</i> (Persica 27,Edited by Roger Pearse)</dd></dl>
<p>On the third day, a local man named Ephialtes betrayed the existence of a mountain path that led behind Greek positions. Leonidas and the 300 Spartans, as well as <a href="/wiki/Demophilus" id="w">Demophilus</a> and his contingent of 700 <a href="/wiki/Thespiae" id="w">Thespians</a>, proved their bravery by staying back to allow the rest of the army to escape.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> </p>

In the mean time a Greek naval force of 271 triremes attacked the Persian fleet off <a href="/wiki/Artemisium" id="w">Artemisium</a>,<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> with a fleet of 75 triremes guarding against a Persian encirclement at <a href="/wiki/Chalkis" id="w">Chalkis</a>. The Persians had indeed sent out a strong contingent to encircle the Greek fleet, but it fell in a storm off <a href="/wiki/Euboea" id="w">Euboea</a> and was damaged.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> Herodotus makes a direct parallel between the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium, even placing them on the same day.  While not a &#34;fight to the death&#34; as Thermopylae had become, Herodotus records that roughly half of the Athenian fleet had been destroyed or damaged beyond repair, in addition to other losses to the allied fleet overall,<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> while at the same time the small Greek fleet had done immense damage to the larger, bulkier Persian fleet, which, as would be seen again at Salamis, became trapped in the narrow strait and unable to manoeuvre. Furthermore fifteen Persian ships had been captured when they sailed in error to the Greek lines earlier.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> When news of the withdrawal from Thermopylae arrived, the Greek fleet secretly abandoned its position.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards Athens was evacuated, and the Greek fleet withdrew to <a href="/wiki/Salamis_Island" id="w">Salamis</a> to aid in the transfer of the population of Attica to the island.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> The Peloponnesians proposed a defensive line at the <a href="/wiki/Isthmus_of_Corinth" id="w">Isthmus of Corinth</a>, relying on the ground forces and using the fleet to keep the Isthmus supplied.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> Themistocles instead forced a confrontation with the Persian fleet at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis" id="w">Battle of Salamis</a> and routed the Persian fleet, forcing it to withdraw to the Ionian coast. According to a story related by Herodotus, before the battle, Xerxes had set up a throne on <a href="/wiki/Egaleo_(mountain)" id="w">Mt. Aegaleo</a>, so he could watch his great victory over the smaller Greek fleet. However, once again the narrow gulf provided little room for his heavy triremes to maneuver, allowing the lighter Greek ships to flank and destroy them. </p>
<p>After Salamis, Xerxes at first attempted to build a causeway across the channel to attack the Athenian evacuees on Salamis according to Herodotus.  <a href="/wiki/Strabo" id="w">Strabo</a>, who had access to works by other authors disagrees. He places the construction before the naval battle. Describing the coast between <a href="/wiki/Eleusis" id="w">Eleusis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Piraeus" id="w">Piraeus</a> notes:
</p><dl><dd><i>and to the passage to Salamis, about two stadia wide, across which Xerxes attempted to build a mole but was forestalled by the naval battle and the flight of the Persians</i> (Geography,9.1.13, translated by <a href="/wiki/H.L._Jones" id="w">H.L. Jones</a>)</dd></dl>
<p>Ctesias<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> also places this attempt before the battle. In any case this project was soon abandoned. The Greek cities of <a href="/wiki/Halkidiki" id="w">Halkidiki</a> rebelled against the Persians. Xerxes, fearing being trapped in Greece, halted his armies advance, withdrew with his family, retainers, the remaining fleet, and a large part of his army to <a href="/wiki/Sardis" id="w">Sardis</a>.

The following spring (<a href="/wiki/479_BC" id="w">479</a>), Mardonius twice offered Athens through <a href="/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Macedon" id="w">Alexander I of Macedon</a> a separate peace, but was rebuffed.

The remnants of the Persian army left Greece, but the largest part of them did not make it to Asia, being ambushed by the forces of Alexander of Macedon in the estuary of the Strymon river.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Reportedly, on the same day as the battle of Plataea a 110 ship Greek fleet commanded by the Spartan king <a href="/wiki/Leotychides" id="w">Leotychides</a> routed a repaired and refitted 300 ship Persian fleet guarded by 60,000 troops in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Mycale" id="w">Battle of Mycale</a>.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> Then they advanced towards the Hellespont intending to break the bridges.

<p>Encouraged by Xerxes&#39; failures, the Greeks of Asia Minor and the Cyclades revolted again. In <a href="/wiki/478_BC" id="w">478 BC</a>, a fleet composed of 20 Peloponnesian ships, 30 Athenian ships under <a href="/wiki/Aristides" id="w">Aristides</a>, and other allied forces, with the general command given to Pausanias, sailed to <a href="/wiki/Cyprus" id="w">Cyprus</a>. There they succeeded in liberating the Greek cities, but did not succeed in their sieges against the Phoenician cities. Thus Cyprus remained a base of the Persian fleet. The Greek fleet then sailed to Byzantium.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> Control of the Hellespont and Bosporus was of vital importance to Athens, since throughout the classical age Athens produced only 40% of the food required to feed her population, the rest being imported from the Greek colonies of the <a href="/wiki/Black_Sea" id="w">Black Sea</a>.</p>
<p>The city of Byzantium fell after a siege. Many Persians including nobility fell prisoner to the Greek forces. Pausanias, who was of the royal house of Agis, was greatly impressed by the new way of life he witnessed it and adopted it. He started wearing Persian dress and offering Persian-style banquets. He also mistreated the Ionian delegates. His Persian-style behaviour scandalised both the Ionians and the Peloponnesians and Pausanias was recalled to Sparta. There he faced charges that he was plotting with the Persian king to become tyrant of Greece, that he was in secret communication with him and that he had asked his daughter as his wife. He was acquitted of those charges, found guilty only of mistreating individuals in their private affairs and sentenced not to lead another campaign outside Sparta.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> Being impatient he took a warship from Hermion and travelled back to Byzantium. No longer welcome there, he crossed the Propontis to the Troas region where he stayed for some time.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup> What he did there is completely unknown. He was recalled to Sparta by special envoy where he was to be brought against charges that he was again plotting with the King of Kings and that he was planning a helot revolution. On his way back, while he was inside the Spartan state limits, he saw the <a href="/wiki/Ephoroi" id="w">ephoroi</a>, the elected council of five that ruled Sparta, approaching and one of them signalled to him that he was doomed. He took refuge in a nearby temple, where he died of starvation several days later. Some modern historians,<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> based on that he was never condemned  and that had he been in league with the Persians he would have sought refuge there and not return, claim this was all a fabrication by his political enemies in Sparta.</p>
<p>In the mean time, in <a href="/wiki/477_BC" id="w">477 BC</a> the Spartans had sent <a href="/wiki/Dorkis" id="w">Dorkis</a> as general in Byzantium with a small force.

Aristides, as leader of the Athenians, had made a very good impression on the Ionians with his character. Also, since Athenians were also Ionians, they were more trusted than the Dorian Spartans. A congress was called in the holy island of <a href="/wiki/Delos" id="w">Delos</a> where the alliance was formed. The members were given a choice of either offering armed forces or paying a tax on the joint treasury. Most cities chose the tax.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> Aristides spent the rest of his life occupied in the affairs of the alliance, dying (according to Plutarch) a few years later in Pontus determining what the tax of new members was to be.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup></p>

The city fell after he diverted the flow of the Strymon river and the walls collapsed. The campaign continued towards Doriskos, however the city refused to capitulate.

Finally, in <a href="/wiki/465_BC" id="w">465 BC</a>, with four triremes Kimon removed the last Persians from the Thracian peninsula; thus ended Persian presence in Europe. In the intervening years, Kimon had forced <a href="/wiki/Karystos" id="w">Karystos</a> in Euboea to join the league, conquered Skyros and sent Athenian colonists there, and suppressed Naxos&#39;s desertion in <a href="/wiki/468_BC" id="w">468 BC</a>.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/468_BC" id="w">468 BC</a> Kimon had gathered a force of 200 improved Athenian triremes in <a href="/wiki/Knidos" id="w">Knidos</a> and 100 allied triremes with 5,000 Athenian hoplites and campaigned in <a href="/wiki/Phaselis" id="w">Phaselis</a> in <a href="/wiki/Pamphylia" id="w">Pamphylia</a>.

<p>Ever since the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Eurymedon" id="w">battle of Eurymedon</a> in <a href="/wiki/466_BC" id="w">466 BC</a> Athens was engaged in operations against the Persian forces in Cyprus. In <a href="/wiki/462_BC" id="w">462 BC</a> Egypt rose again against Persia. Their king <a href="/wiki/Inaros" id="w">Inaros</a> asked in <a href="/wiki/460_BC" id="w">460 BC</a> Athens for assistance which was gladly rendered because Athens wished to colonise Egypt. The Persians had gathered a force of 400,000 (according to Ctesias and Diodorus)<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup> to suppress the revolution. A force of 200 Athenian triremes that was campaigning in Cyprus was immediately ordered for assistance.<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup> A battle took place on <a href="/wiki/Papremis" id="w">Papremis</a> in the west bank of the <a href="/wiki/Nile_river" id="w">Nile river</a>.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup> According to Diodorus who is our only source about Athenian engagement in this battle, the Athenian phalanx again defeated the numerically superior but individually inferior Persian archer. The Egyptians and <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Libya" id="w">Libyans</a> that were previously retreating on the rest of the front followed the breach in the Persian ranks the Athenians caused and won the battle. The Persian army retreated to <a href="/wiki/Memphis%2C_Egypt" id="w">Memphis</a>.<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup> A sea battle took place near there, where 40 Athenian under <a href="/wiki/Charitimedes" id="w">Charitimedes</a> and 15 Samian ships (of the 200 that had arrived) sunk 30 and captured 20 Persian ships, according to Ctesias.</p>
<p>In the mean time Athens was engaged in war in the Greek peninsula. While the helot revolution was in its final stages and Kimon in Athens, Argos rose against Sparta. The small force that was sent to quell this was defeated by a joint Athenian and Argos force in Oenoe in <a href="/wiki/460_BC" id="w">460 BC</a>. The war was generalised, and the allies of Plataea found themselves 19 years later at each other&#39;s throat.

<a id="Athens_Defeated_in_Egypt_but_Victorious_in_Cyprus" name="Athens_Defeated_in_Egypt_but_Victorious_in_Cyprus"></a><h3>Athens Defeated in Egypt but Victorious in Cyprus</h3>
<p>Between <a href="/wiki/459_BC" id="w">459 BC</a> and <a href="/wiki/456_BC" id="w">456 BC</a> the Egyptians and their Athenian allies were still engaged in the siege of the Persian force in Memphis. A large part of the Athenian fleet had been recalled to the Aegean to help with operations there. The Persians organised another force that, according to Ctesias, numbered 200,000 soldiers and 300 ships, though according to Diodorus had over 300,000 infantry and cavalry. It was led by <a href="/wiki/Megabyzus" id="w">Megabyzus</a>. A new battle took place near Memphis. Charitimedes was killed, king Inaros escaped to the naval base that had been set up in Prosoptis island on the Nile Delta. There, assisted by 6,000 Athenians and their fleet he was besieged for 18 months. The Persian generals did not dare land. They drained the land between the river bank and the island and surprised the Egyptians. The Egyptians quickly surrendered except king Inaros. The Athenians were left alone.<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup> Megabyzus negotiated with the Athenians their surrender and were allowed through Cyrene to return to their home. A number of them though was kept prisoner according to Ctesias. A fleet that was being sent to relieve the force at Prosoptis unaware they had surrendered was defeated by the Persians near Cape Mendesium. The result of this loss was that Cyprus fell again to the Persians.<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup> Athenians and their allies lost some 20,000 men in this campaign if Isocrates&#39; numbers are accepted.<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup> However these dead were very well remembered and Plato puts them along the dead of Euremedon and Cyprus.</p>
<p>Kimon after his recall and the five year peace was sent in Cyprus and Cilicia to fight the Persians. The Persians had helped several cities in Ionia that had tried to defect from the league.<sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup> With Kimon in Cyprus was sent a force of 200 triremes.<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup> They were facing a force of 300 Persian ships in Cyprus led by <a href="/wiki/Artabazus" id="w">Artabazus</a> and 300,000 soldiers in <a href="/wiki/Cilicia" id="w">Cilicia</a> led by Megabyzus. Kimon conquered Marion, but was unsuccessful in his siege of a Persian stronghold at <a href="/wiki/Kition" id="w">Kition</a> in Cyprus. He sent 60 ships to Egypt. During that siege of Kition he died of a wound or disease.<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[103]</a></sup> On his deathbed he ordered his army to lift the siege and retreat towards Salamis. His death was kept a secret from the Athenian army and their allies, until 30 days later the Athenians defeated both at land and sea the Persians. According to Thucydides both battles took place in Salamis.<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup> According to Diodorus though the land battle took place in Cilicia where the defeated fleet had fled.<sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup> Thus Kimon, even after his death, defeated the Persians.</p>
<a id="The_Peace_of_Callias" name="The_Peace_of_Callias"></a><h2>The Peace of Callias</h2>
<p>After this battle both enemies were exhausted. None of the sides were in full control of the whole of the Eastern Mediterranean. The king of Persia sent emissaries to Athens. Pericles responded favourably and, in the autumn of <a href="/wiki/449_BC" id="w">449 BC</a> according to Diodorus, sent <a href="/wiki/Callias" id="w">Callias</a> son of Ipponicus in <a href="/wiki/Susa" id="w">Susa</a> to negotiate. The exact nature of the agreement that became known as the <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Callias" id="w">peace of Callias</a> remains unclear (formal treaty or <a href="/wiki/Non-aggression_pact" id="w">non-aggression pact</a>). According to Diodorus it was an &#34;important treaty&#34;, Thucydides doesn&#39;t even mention it. The terms, according to Diodorus were:<sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[106]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul>
<li>All Greek cities of Asia were to be autonomous</li>
<li>Persian satraps were not to reach closer than three days walk from the sea</li>
<li>No Persian warship was to be in the area between Phaselis in Pamphylia and the Bosporus</li>
<li>If the Great king and his generals were to comply the Athenians were not to campaign against Artaxerxes</li></ul>
<p>After the peace was agreed Athenians recalled the 60 triremes from Egypt and their forces from Cyprus (apparently this was part of the agreement though it is not mentioned) and ceased operations in this front. The situation in Greece though had flared up and war continued there until the Thirty Year Peace of <a href="/wiki/445_BC" id="w">445 BC</a>. Afterwards Greece entered in what is called the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Pericles" id="w">Greek Golden Age</a>, a time of security and development.</p>
<a id="Later_Conflicts" name="Later_Conflicts"></a><h2>Later Conflicts</h2>
<p>The Persians and Greeks continued to meddle in each others&#39; affairs. The Persians entered the <a href="/wiki/Peloponnesian_War" id="w">Peloponnesian War</a> in 411 BC forming a mutual-defence pact with <a href="/wiki/Sparta" id="w">Sparta</a> and combining their naval resources against <a href="/wiki/Athens" id="w">Athens</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Tissaphernes" id="w">Tissaphernes</a>) in exchange for sole Persian control of Ionia. In 404 BC when <a href="/wiki/Cyrus_the_Younger" id="w">Cyrus the Younger</a> attempted to seize the Persian throne, he recruited 13,000 Greek mercenaries from all over the Greek world of which Sparta sent 700-800, believing they were following the terms of the treaty and unaware of the army&#39;s true purpose. After the failure of Cyrus, Persia tried to regain control of the Ionian city-states. The Ionians refused to capitulate and called upon Sparta for assistance, which she provided. Athens sided with the Persians, setting off the <a href="/wiki/Corinthian_War" id="w">Corinthian War</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Artaxerxes_II_of_Persia" id="w">Artaxerxes II</a>). Sparta was eventually forced to abandon Ionia and Persian authority was restored with the <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Antalcidas" id="w">peace of Antalcidas</a>. No other Greek force challenged Persia for nearly 60 years until <a href="/wiki/Phillip_II_of_Macedon" id="w">Phillip II of Macedon</a>, who, in <a href="/wiki/338_BC" id="w">338 BC</a> formed an alliance called οι Ελληνες (the Greeks), modelled after the alliance of 481 BC, and set in motion an invasion of the western part of Asia Minor. He was murdered before he could carry out his plan. His son, Alexander III of Macedon, known as <a href="/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" id="w">Alexander the Great</a>, set out in <a href="/wiki/334_BC" id="w">334 BC</a> with 38,000 soldiers.  Within three years his army had conquered the Persian Empire and brought the Achaemenid dynasty to an end, bringing Greek culture up to the banks of the <a href="/wiki/Indus_river" id="w">Indus river</a>.</p>

<p>What is known of this conflict today comes almost exclusively from the Greek sources. <a href="/wiki/Herodotus" id="w">Herodotus</a> of <a href="/wiki/Halicarnassus" id="w">Halicarnassus</a> after his exile from his home town, in the middle of the <a href="/wiki/5th_century_BC" id="w">5th century BC</a> travelled all over the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean" id="w">Mediterranean</a> and beyond, from <a href="/wiki/Scythia" id="w">Scythia</a> to <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a> collecting information over the Persian Wars and other events that he complied in his book <i>Ιστοριης Απόδειξη</i> (known in English as <i>The Histories</i>).

However ancient writers consider his work much better in quality than that of any of his predecessors which is why <a href="/wiki/Cicero" id="w">Cicero</a> called him father of history.<sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[109]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Thucydides" id="w">Thucydides</a> the Athenian intended to compile a work from where Herodotus ends until the end of the <a href="/wiki/Peloponnesian_War" id="w">Peloponnesian War</a> in <a href="/wiki/404_BC" id="w">404 BC</a>. His collection of books is entitled <i>Ξυγγραφη</i> (known in English as <i>The Peloponnesian War</i>). It is believed that he died before completing his work, as he gives a full account only of the first twenty years of the Peloponnesian War. There is little information on what happened before. The events that interest us here are recounted in Book I paragraphs 89 to 118.</p>
<p>Among later writers <a href="/wiki/Ephorus" id="w">Ephorus</a> wrote in the <a href="/wiki/4th_century_BC" id="w">4th century BC</a> a <a href="/wiki/Universal_history" id="w">universal history</a> which includes the events of these wars. <a href="/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus" id="w">Diodorus Siculus</a> wrote in the <a href="/wiki/1st_century_AD" id="w">1st century AD</a> a book of history since the beginning of time that also includes the history of this war. The closest thing to a Persian source in Greek literature is <a href="/wiki/Ctesias" id="w">Ctesias of Cnedus</a> who was <a href="/wiki/Artaxerxes_II" id="w">Artaxerxes Mnemon</a>&#39;s personal physician wrote a history of Persia according to Persian sources in the 4th century BC. In his work he also mocks Herodotus and claims that his information is accurate since he heard from the Persians. Unfortunately the works of these last writers have not survived complete. Since fragments of them are given in the <a href="/wiki/Bibliotheca_(Photius)" id="w">Myriobiblon</a> which was compiled by <a href="/wiki/Photius" id="w">Photius</a> that later became <a href="/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch" id="w">Ecumenical Patriarch</a> of <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a> in the <a href="/wiki/9th_century_AD" id="w">9th century AD</a>, in the book <i>Eklogai</i> by the emperor <a href="/wiki/Constantine_VII" id="w">Constantine VII</a> <a href="/wiki/Porphyrogenitos" id="w">Porphyrogenitos</a> (<a href="/wiki/913" id="w">913</a>-<a href="/wiki/919" id="w">919</a> AD) and the <a href="/wiki/Suda" id="w">Suda</a> dictionary <a href="/wiki/10th_century_AD" id="w">10th century AD</a> it is believed that they were lost with the destruction of the imperial library of the Holy Palace of Constantinople by the crusaders of the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_Crusade" id="w">Fourth Crusade</a> in <a href="/wiki/1204" id="w">1204</a>.</p>
<p>Thus historians are forced to supplement Herodotus&#39; and Thucydides&#39; information with works of later writers intended for other uses like <a href="/wiki/2nd_century_AD" id="w">2nd century AD</a> <a href="/wiki/Plutarch" id="w">Plutarch</a>&#39;s biographies and the tour guide of southern Greece compiled at the same time by the <a href="/wiki/Geographer" id="w">geographer</a> and traveller <a href="/wiki/Pausanias_(geographer)" id="w">Pausanias</a>, who is not to be confused with the Spartan general of the same name mentioned later.

<p>Herodotus doubles this number to account for support troops and thus he reports that the whole troop numbered 5,283,220 men in Greece,<sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[113]</a></sup> an estimate that has been rejected by modern historians. Other ancient sources contradict Heroditus. The poet <a href="/wiki/Simonides_of_Ceos" id="w">Simonides</a>, who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million. <a href="/wiki/Ctesias" id="w">Ctesias of Cnedus</a> who was <a href="/wiki/Artaxerxes_II" id="w">Artaxerxes Mnemon</a>&#39;s personal physician wrote a history of Persia that unfortunately has not survived, gave 800,000 as the total number of the original army that met in <a href="/wiki/Doriskos" id="w">Doriskos</a>. </p>
<p>Modern scholars tend to reject the figures given in ancient texts as a result of miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors. Their estimations are based on knowledge of the Persian military systems, their logistical capabilities, the Greek countryside, and supplies available along the army&#39;s route.The topic has been hotly debated but the general consensus revolves around the figure of 200,000.<sup id="_ref-souza_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-souza" title="">[51]</a></sup> Some place the upper limit at 250,000 total land forces. The main reason most often given for these values is the supply of water; Sir Frederick Maurice,<sup id="_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#_note-114" title="">[114]</a></sup> a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/General" id="w">general</a> in <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, was among the first to argue that the army could not have surpassed 175,000 due to lack of water. Many other modern scholars estimate that the land forces participating in the battle cannot have exceeded 100,000 soldiers.

<p>Another school contends that ancient sources do give somewhat realistic numbers. According to the texts the Greeks at the end of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Plataea" id="w">battle of Plataea</a>  mustered 110,000 (<a href="/wiki/Herodotus" id="w">Herodotus</a>) or 100,000 (<a href="/wiki/Pompeius" id="w">Pompeius</a>) troops: 38,700 <a href="/wiki/Hoplites" id="w">hoplites</a> and 71,300 or 61,300 <a href="/wiki/Peltast" id="w">peltasts</a> respectively, the difference probably being 10,000 <a href="/wiki/Helots" id="w">helots</a>. In that battle, according to Herodotus, they faced 300,000 Persians and 50,000 Greek allies. This gives a 3-to-1 ratio for the two armies, which proponents of the school consider a realistic proportion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Munro<sup id="_ref-132" class="reference"><a href="#_note-132" title="">[132]</a></sup> and Macan<sup id="_ref-133" class="reference"><a href="#_note-133" title="">[133]</a></sup> note Herodotus giving the names of six major commanders and 29 <i> μυρίαρχοι </i> (muriarxoi)—leaders of the <a href="/wiki/Baivabaram" id="w">baivabaram</a>, the basic unit of the Persian infantry, which numbered about 10,000-strong.<sup id="_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#_note-134" title="">[134]</a></sup> As troops were lost through attrition, the Persians preferred to dissolve crippled baivabarams to replenish the ranks of others.<sup id="_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="#_note-135" title="">[135]</a></sup> It is therefore likely that the units were at full strength.</p>
<p>According to that view lack of water is not the determining force. The available surface water in Greece today satisfies the needs of a much larger population than the number Xerxes&#39; troops, though the majority of that water is used for irrigation.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Hammond_(historian)" id="w">Nicholas Hammond</a> suggests the Persian army numbered about 242,000 for the expedition. The <a href="/wiki/Metrology" id="w">metrologist</a> <a href="/wiki/Livio_Catullo_Stecchini" id="w">Livio Catullo Stecchini</a> (who was a controversial figure) argues that the size of the Persian fighting forces were 700,000 infantry and cavalry.<sup id="_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#_note-136" title="">[136]</a></sup> Dr. Manousos Kampouris argues that Herodotus&#39; 1,700,000 for the infantry plus 80,000 cavalry (including support) is very realistic for various reasons including the size of the area from which the army was drafted (from modern-day <a href="/wiki/Libya" id="w">Libya</a> to <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a>), the lack of security against spies, the ratios of land troops to fleet troops, of infantry to cavalry and Persian troops to Greek troops.<sup id="_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="#_note-137" title="">[137]</a></sup> On the other hand Christos Romas believes that the Persian troops accompanying Xerxes were a little over 400,000.<sup id="_ref-138" class="reference"><a href="#_note-138" title="">[138]</a></sup></p>
<p>The size of the Persian fleet is also disputed. According to <a href="/wiki/Herodotus" id="w">Herodotus</a>, the Persian fleet numbered 1,207 triremes and 3,000 <a href="/wiki/Pentekontoroi" id="w">pentekontoroi</a>, ships with 50 rowers. He gives a detailed descripti

<p>Herodotus also claims that this was the number at Salamis, despite the losses earlier in storms off Sepias and Euboea, and at the battle off <a href="/wiki/Artemisium" id="w">Artemisium</a>.

<p>These numbers are close but not exactly what Herodotus claims and this have been interpreted as a confirmation of the 1,200 number. Among modern scholars Köster<sup id="_ref-144" class="reference"><a href="#_note-144" title="">[144]</a></sup> Olmstead, and Green have accepted this number. Commodore Simpsas<sup id="_ref-145" class="reference"><a href="#_note-145" title="">[145]</a></sup> interprets the 207 fast ship comment as that only these 207 were fully manned and the rest were not. Christos Romas<sup id="_ref-146" class="reference"><a href="#_note-146" title="">[146]</a></sup> believes that there were 1,200 ships gathered in Doriskos but the reinforcements that later came did not cover the losses from the storms and battles.

<p>According to Herodotus, the Greek city-states at Plataea fielded an army of hoplites listed in the table to the right. Also 71,300 light troops were sent. Of these 35,000 were <a href="/wiki/Helot" id="w">helots</a> of Sparta, 1,800 were <a href="/wiki/Thespiae" id="w">Thespians</a> and the other 34,500 are simply said to be from the other cities, about one per hoplite. <sup id="_ref-153" class="reference"><a href="#_note-153" title="">[153]</a></sup></p>
<p>This is a very large number for a Greek army. The <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" id="w">Byzantine Empire</a> rarely fielded armies larger than 100,000 while the modern Greek state raised an army of this size in the <a href="/wiki/Greco-Turkish_War_(1897)" id="w">Greek-Turkish War of 1897</a> and the <a href="/wiki/First_Balkan_War" id="w">First Balkan War</a> in <a href="/wiki/1912" id="w">1912</a>. Unlike the last two mentioned conflicts when only soldiers from 7 or 8 years were drafted what was fielded in Plataea was probably every able bodied man between the ages of 20 and 50 that owned weapons.</p>
<p>Among modern scholars others have accepted these numbers and have used them as a <a href="/wiki/Population_census" id="w">population census</a> of Greece at the time,<sup id="_ref-154" class="reference"><a href="#_note-154" title="">[154]</a></sup> others have claimed the light troop numbers bloated especially since they imply 7 helots for every Spartiat and others have claimed there were no light troops in Plataea, only hoplites, the light troops being nothing more than support troops.</p>
