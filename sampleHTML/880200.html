On <a href="/wiki/July_15" id="w">July 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1961" id="w">1961</a>, to meet the burgeoning educational demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing the establishment of a new university in the City of Boca Raton. Florida Atlantic University was built on a 1940s&#8211;era army airbase in Boca Raton. During World War II, the airfield served as the <a href="/wiki/Army_Air_Corps" id="w">Army Air Corps</a>&#39; sole radar training facility. The base was built on the existing <a href="/wiki/Boca_Raton_Airport" id="w">Boca Raton Airport</a> and on 5,860&#160;acres (23.7&#160;kmÂ²) of adjacent land.<sup id="_ref-Morikami_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Morikami" title="">[10]</a></sup> A majority of the land was acquired from <a href="/wiki/Japanese-American" id="w">Japanese-American</a> farmers from the failing <a href="/wiki/Yamato_Colony%2C_Florida" id="w">Yamato Colony</a>. The land was seized through <a href="/wiki/Eminent_domain" id="w">eminent domain</a>, leaving many Japanese-Americans little recourse in the early days of World War II.<sup id="_ref-Morikami_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Morikami" title="">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Boca Raton airbase was used for radar training, anti-submarine patrols along the coast, and as a stop-over point for planes being ferried to Africa and Europe via South America.  It had a troop strength of 16,000&#160;men, with approximately 1,200&#160;civilian workers. The airfield was composed of four runways, each stretching 5,200&#160;feet (1.58&#160;km) long, set in a triangle shape, with one runway bisecting the triangle. These runways are still visible on the Boca Campus today and are mainly used for parking. Over the course of the war, the airfield would grow to encompass more than 800&#160;buildings serving approximately 100,000&#160;airmen, including those who were aboard the <a href="/wiki/Enola_Gay" id="w">Enola Gay</a> when it dropped a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" id="w">nuclear weapon</a> on <a href="/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" id="w">Hiroshima</a>.<sup id="_ref-B Historical Society_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-B Historical Society" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Brogan Add_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brogan Add" title="">[12]</a></sup> As the war drew to a close Boca Raton Army Airfield saw a steady decline in use. By the end of 1945, about only 100&#160;planes were stationed at the airbase.<sup id="_ref-Boca Airport 1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Boca Airport 1" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-FAU Curl_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FAU Curl" title="">[14]</a></sup> By early 1947, the military decided to transfer future radar training operations to Kessler Air Force Base in <a href="/wiki/Mississippi" id="w">Mississippi</a>. This decision was finalized when on <a href="/wiki/September_17" id="w">September 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale_Hurricane" id="w">Fort Lauderdale Hurricane</a> struck South Florida. According to historian Donald Curl, &#34;the 1947 storm caused extensive damage to the hurriedly-built frame structures of the base and was responsible for widespread flooding.&#34;<sup id="_ref-FAU Curl_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FAU Curl" title="">[14]</a></sup> These conditions led the <a href="/wiki/Us_air_force" id="w">Air Force</a> to abandon the site earlier than originally planned.<sup id="_ref-FAU Curl_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FAU Curl" title="">[14]</a></sup> The departure of the air force in 1947 would leave Boca Raton Army Airfield essentially abandoned. Historian Roger Miller, who visited the airfield during this period, describes the airbase as having &#34;a small operations office to check into and out of, a deteriorating and empty mess hall, and about twenty-odd other wooden buildings of World War II vintage.&#34;<sup id="_ref-FAU Miller_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FAU Miller" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>Florida Atlantic University opened on <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1964" id="w">1964</a>, with an initial student body of 867&#160;students in five colleges.

On-campus housing for students was first added in September 1965, when Algonquin Hall opened.<sup id="_ref-Legacy History_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Legacy History" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Admissions Standards_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Admissions Standards" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Florida Atlantic&#39;s history is one of continuing expansion as the university&#39;s service population has grown. The university originally served only upper-division and graduate level students, because Florida intended the institution &#34;to complement the state&#39;s community college system, accepting students who had earned their associate degrees from those institutions.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Legacy History_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Legacy History" title="">[17]</a></sup> Florida Atlantic began its expansion beyond a one-campus university in 1971, when it opened its Commercial Boulevard campus in <a href="/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale" id="w">Fort Lauderdale</a>. Due to a rapidly expanding population in South Florida, in 1984 Florida Atlantic took another major step by opening its doors to undergraduate students. The following year, the university added its third campus, in downtown Fort Lauderdale on Las Olas Boulevard.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">President Brogan&#39;s residence at Baldwin House on the Boca Raton Campus</div> 1989, the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Legislature" id="w">Florida Legislature</a> recognized demands for higher education in South Florida by designating Florida Atlantic as the lead state university serving Broward County. To fill this role, the university would establish a campus in <a href="/wiki/Dania_Beach" id="w">Dania Beach</a> in 1997 and another campus in the City of <a href="/wiki/Davie%2C_Florida" id="w">Davie</a> in western <a href="/wiki/Broward_County" id="w">Broward County</a> in 1990. Florida Atlantic later purchased 50 acres (0.2&#160;kmÂ²) of land in  <a href="/wiki/Port_St._Lucie%2C_Florida" id="w">Port St. Lucie</a> in 1994 to establish a campus on the <a href="/wiki/Treasure_Coast" id="w">Treasure Coast</a>.

<p>The university offers two honors options: the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College and a University Scholars Program. The Wilkes Honors College is located on the John D. MacArthur campus in Jupiter, Florida. It offers a <a href="/wiki/Liberal_arts_college" id="w">liberal art education</a> in the platform of a public university, yet is comparable to a private liberal arts college.<sup id="_ref-HC FAQ_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HC FAQ" title="">[24]</a></sup> The Boca Raton campus houses the University Scholars Program, which offers special honors seminars, forums, courses, and advanced course substitution for freshman.</p>
<p>Florida Atlantic University&#39;s admission requirements have been traditionally considered low.<sup id="_ref-Trad Low_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Trad Low" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Grades_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grades" title="">[26]</a></sup> Recently, however, the institution has begun gradually increasing standards to improve its graduation and retention rates. Starting in the summer of 2004, Florida Atlantic began denying entry to students with low GPAs and <a href="/wiki/SAT" id="w">SAT</a> scores. Prospective students were directed to take remedial courses at a community college to better prepare them for success at the university. The higher admissions standards required a 3.2&#160;<a href="/wiki/GPA" id="w">GPA</a> and an SAT score of at least 1000 for admittance in 2007. This increase was not without controversy. Critics argued it would place an even greater reliance on the already burgeoning local community college system. These colleges had turned away over 22,000&#160;people in 2004 and would be forced to turn away even more prospective students in the future.<sup id="_ref-Admissions Standards_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Admissions Standards" title="">[5]</a></sup> It was announced in 2007 that university officials were again looking to raise admissions standards to improve the institution&#39;s success rates. Florida Atlantic&#39;s six-year graduation rate places it second lowest in the state university system at just 36.5%. While this is partly due to the fact that the university serves a large percentage of part-time students, data also show problems among traditional undergraduate students. In 2000, about 16% of freshmen dropped out within six years, while 25% transferred to a community college. Critics are again questioning the increase in standards, arguing since Florida Atlantic is also trying to increase its freshmen enrollment, it should focus on becoming more appealing to prospective students.<sup id="_ref-Grades_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grades" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>For the 2007&#8211;2008 academic year, the average high school GPA for an entering freshman was 3.2, with a 1041 score on the SAT.<sup id="_ref-Facts_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Facts" title="">[4]</a></sup> The university&#39;s average GPA of 3.3 for the 2006&#8211;2007 academic year was the second lowest of the 11&#160;universities in the state system.<sup id="_ref-Grades_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grades" title="">[26]</a></sup> The average class size for undergraduates is 33&#160;students, and for graduate classes, 12&#160;students.

One new practice that is intended to become tradition is &#34;Bury the Burrow in Red,&#34;  which calls for Florida Atlantic students to wear as much red as possible and fill the <a href="/wiki/FAU_Arena" id="w">Burrow</a>, the university&#39;s multi-purpose arena, during the annual <a href="/wiki/College_basketball" id="w">basketball</a> face-off between Florida Atlantic and nearby <a href="/wiki/Florida_International_University" id="w">Florida International University</a> (FIU).<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> The official spirit group supporting Florida Atlantic athletics is the &#34;prOWLers.&#34; The group began in February 2002 to support the men&#39;s basketball program during the teamâs run for the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Sun_Conference" id="w">Atlantic Sun Conference Championship</a>. The group is funded by the Student Alumni Association, and can now be found at most sporting events cheering for Florida Atlantic.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> In addition, the university has two other spirit organizations which support specific sports: the &#34;Rowdy Rexes&#34; support the basketball programs, and the &#34;Crazy Coonies&#34; support the baseball program.<sup id="_ref-FAU Trad_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FAU Trad" title="">[49]</a></sup> </p>
