Colbert was invited to speak at the dinner by Mark Smith, outgoing president of the White House Press Corps Association. According to a report in <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_(magazine)" id="w">New York</a></i> magazine, &#34;Smith later told the <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">Times</a></i> he hadn&#39;t seen much of Colbert&#39;s work.&#34;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Colbert gave his after-dinner remarks in front of an audience that the <a href="/wiki/Associated_Press" id="w">Associated Press</a> described as a &#34;Who&#39;s Who of power and celebrity&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ap-2006.04.30_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ap-2006.04.30" title="">[12]</a></sup> More than 2,500 guests attended the event,<sup id="_ref-nytimes-bush-twins_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nytimes-bush-twins" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-onethemedia-guess-who_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-onethemedia-guess-who" title="">[14]</a></sup> including <a href="/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States" id="w">First Lady</a> <a href="/wiki/Laura_Bush" id="w">Laura Bush</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff" id="w">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pace" id="w">Peter Pace</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General" id="w">U.S. Attorney General</a> <a href="/wiki/Alberto_Gonzales" id="w">Alberto Gonzales</a>, <a href="/wiki/AOL" id="w">AOL</a> co-founder <a href="/wiki/Steve_Case" id="w">Steve Case</a>, model/tennis player <a href="/wiki/Anna_Kournikova" id="w">Anna Kournikova</a>, and actor <a href="/wiki/George_Clooney" id="w">George Clooney</a>.<sup id="_ref-washpost-all-georges_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washpost-all-georges" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> For his performance, Colbert took on the role of the character that he plays on his television show, <i>The Colbert Report</i>. He spoke directly to President Bush several times, <a href="/wiki/Satire" id="w">satirically</a> praising his <a href="/wiki/American_foreign_policy" id="w">foreign policy</a>, lifestyle, and beliefs, and referring to his declining <a href="/wiki/Approval_rating" id="w">approval rating</a> and popular reputation.</p>
<p>Many of Colbert&#39;s jokes were directed at President Bush, while other jokes lampooned the journalists and other figures present at the dinner. Although most of the speech was prepared specifically for the event, several segments were lifted, largely unchanged, from <i>The Colbert Report</i>, particularly from the opening &#34;<a href="/wiki/Truthiness" id="w">truthiness</a>&#34; monologue on the first episode of the show, where Colbert advocated speaking from &#34;the gut&#34; rather than the brain and denounced books as &#34;all fact, no heart.&#34; Colbert framed this part of the speech as though he were agreeing with Bush&#39;s own philosophies, saying that he and Bush are &#34;not brainiacs on the nerd patrol,&#34;<sup id="_ref-improved transcript_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-improved transcript" title="">[17]</a></sup> thus implicitly criticizing the way Bush positions himself as an <a href="/wiki/Anti-intellectualism" id="w">anti-intellectual</a>.</p>
<p>Following this introduction to his style and general philosophy, Colbert listed a series of absurd &#34;beliefs that I live by,&#34; such as &#34;I believe in America. I believe it exists.&#34; He also alluded to <a href="/wiki/Outsourcing" id="w">outsourcing</a> to China, and satirized the traditional <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Republican</a> opposition to &#34;<a href="/wiki/Big_government" id="w">big government</a>&#34; by referencing the <a href="/wiki/Iraq_War" id="w">Iraq War</a>, saying, &#34;I believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least. And by these standards, we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq.&#34;<sup id="_ref-improved transcript_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-improved transcript" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Colbert then segued into a segment poking fun at Bush&#39;s sinking <a href="/wiki/Approval_rating" id="w">approval ratings</a>:</p>
<dl><dd>&#34;Now, I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32 percent approval rating. But guys like us, we don&#39;t pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in &#39;reality.&#39; And reality has a well-known liberal bias. ... Sir, pay no attention to the people who say <a href="/wiki/Is_the_glass_half_empty_or_half_full%3F" id="w">the glass is half empty</a>, because 32% means it&#39;s two-thirds empty. There&#39;s still some liquid in that glass, is my point. But I wouldn&#39;t drink it. The last third is usually <a href="/wiki/Saliva" id="w">backwash</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-improved transcript_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-improved transcript" title="">[17]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Following this, Colbert continued his mock defense of Bush by satirizing Bush&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Photo_op" id="w">photo ops</a> aboard the <a href="/wiki/USS_Abraham_Lincoln_(CVN-72)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Abraham Lincoln&#39;&#39;</a>,<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> at the site of the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks" id="w">collapsed World Trade Center</a>,<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> and in cities devastated by <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" id="w">Hurricane Katrina</a>:<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<dl><dd>&#34;I stand by this man. I stand by this man because he stands for things. Not only <i>for</i> things, he stands <i>on</i> things. Things like aircraft carriers, and rubble, and recently flooded city squares. And that sends a strong message: that no matter what happens to America, she will always rebound—with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world.&#34;<sup id="_ref-improved transcript_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-improved transcript" title="">[17]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Colbert then wrapped up the portion of his monologue specifically directed at Bush by parodying his <a href="/wiki/Energy_policy_of_the_United_States" id="w">energy policy</a>, using Laura Bush&#39;s reading initiative as a springboard to mock-criticize books for being &#34;<a href="/wiki/Elitist" id="w">elitist</a>,&#34; and complimenting Bush for being &#34;steady&#34;: &#34;Events can change; this man&#39;s beliefs never will.  He believes the same thing Wednesday as he did Monday.  No matter what happened Tuesday.&#34;<sup id="_ref-improved transcript_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-improved transcript" title="">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Next, Colbert took time to harshly criticize the <a href="/wiki/White_House_Press_Corps" id="w">White House Press Corps</a>, who hosted the event, and the <a href="/wiki/Media_bias_in_the_United_States" id="w">media</a> in general. Addressing the audience, he remarked:</p>
<dl><dd>&#34;Over the last five years, you people were so good—over <a href="/wiki/Economic_Growth_and_Tax_Relief_Reconciliation_Act_of_2001" id="w">tax cuts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Weapons_of_mass_destruction" id="w">WMD</a> intelligence, the effect of <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" id="w">global warming</a>. We Americans didn&#39;t want to know, and you had the courtesy not to try to find out. ... And then you write, &#39;Oh, they&#39;re just <i><a href="/wiki/Rearranging_the_deck_chairs_on_the_Titanic" id="w">rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic</a></i>.&#39; First of all, that is a <i>terrible</i> metaphor. This administration is not sinking. This administration is <i>soaring</i>. If anything, they are rearranging the deck chairs on the <i><a href="/wiki/LZ_129_Hindenburg" id="w">Hindenburg</a></i>!&#34;<sup id="_ref-improved transcript_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-improved transcript" title="">[17]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>For the remainder of his speech, Colbert joked about a number of people in the audience, including Peter Pace, <a href="/wiki/Antonin_Scalia" id="w">Antonin Scalia</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_McCain" id="w">John McCain</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_C._Wilson" id="w">Joe Wilson</a>. During this section, he made another reference to global warming while talking about interviewing <a href="/wiki/Jesse_Jackson" id="w">Jesse Jackson</a>: &#34;You can ask him anything, but he&#39;s going to say what he wants, at the pace that he wants. It&#39;s like boxing a glacier. Enjoy that metaphor, by the way, because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is.&#34;</p>
<p>Colbert received a chilly reception from the audience.<sup id="_ref-onethemedia-guess-who_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-onethemedia-guess-who" title="">[14]</a></sup> His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, apart from the enthusiastic laughter of a few in the audience, such as Antonin Scalia&#39;s hearty laughter as Colbert teased him.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> This was in stark contrast to the warm reception that Bush received at the event for his skit with <a href="/wiki/Look-alike" id="w">impersonator</a> <a href="/wiki/Steve_Bridges" id="w">Steve Bridges</a>, which immediately preceded Colbert&#39;s monologue.<sup id="_ref-editor-and-publisher-2006.04.29_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-editor-and-publisher-2006.04.29" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-nytimes-truthiness-bums_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nytimes-truthiness-bums" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the end of his monologue, Colbert introduced what he characterized as an audition video to become the new <a href="/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary" id="w">White House Press Secretary</a> (<a href="/wiki/Scott_McClellan" id="w">Scott McClellan</a> having recently left the position). The video spliced clips of difficult questions from the White House press corps with responses from Colbert as Press Secretary. Colbert&#39;s podium included controls marked &#34;eject,&#34; &#34;Gannon&#34; (a reference to erstwhile White House reporter <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Gannon" id="w">Jeff Gannon</a>, who once asked Bush a question that some in the press corps considered &#34;so friendly it might have been planted&#34;<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>), and &#34;volume,&#34; which he used to silence a critical question by <a href="/wiki/David_Gregory_(journalist)" id="w">David Gregory</a>.</p>
<p>The video continued with Colbert fleeing the briefing room and the White House, only to be pursued by <a href="/wiki/Helen_Thomas" id="w">Helen Thomas</a>, who has been a vocal critic of the Bush administration.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-bush_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bush" title="">[24]</a></sup> The footage of Thomas&#39; pursuit of Colbert is not spliced, as Thomas had agreed to participate in the video. At one point, Colbert picks up an emergency phone and explains that Thomas &#34;won&#39;t stop asking why we invaded Iraq.&#34; The dispatcher responds with, &#34;Hey, why <i>did</i> we invade Iraq?&#34; The entire second half of the video is a spoof of <a href="/wiki/Horror_film" id="w">horror film</a> <a href="/wiki/Clich%C3%A9" id="w">clichés</a>, particularly the film <i><a href="/wiki/Westworld" id="w">Westworld</a></i>, with melodramatic music accompanying Thomas&#39;s slow, unwavering pursuit of Colbert, and Colbert loudly screaming &#34;No!&#34; at various intervals.</p>
<p>Several of Bush&#39;s aides and supporters walked out during Colbert&#39;s speech, and one former aide commented that the President had &#34;that look that he&#39;s ready to blow.&#34;<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Although President Bush shook Colbert&#39;s hand after his presentation, Colbert received an icy response from First Lady Laura Bush.<sup id="_ref-onethemedia-guess-who_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-onethemedia-guess-who" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-editor-and-publisher-2006.04.29_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-editor-and-publisher-2006.04.29" title="">[3]</a></sup>

<p>However, others saw no intentional snub of Colbert by the press.
