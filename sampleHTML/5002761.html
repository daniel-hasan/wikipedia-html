<p>In the city of Lismore the four largest industries by employment are; retail sector, health care, education and agriculture. St John&#39;s College, originally an agricultural secondary school, has a major part in two of these sectors and of course participates indirectly in the others as well.<br/></p>
<p>The school&#39;s name is often shortened to &#34;Woodlawn&#34; rather than being named fully. After 75 years the name is a source of pride and honour throughout the local and educational communities. The School was founded by the <a href="/wiki/Society_of_Mary_(Marists)" id="w">Marists</a> who continue to play a role in the running of the school. The first lay Rector (Principal) is Glenn Roff who holds the role currently.</p>

Is respected as being the most exciting, engaged and fun night of the college, it its known as the best swimming carnival in the Northern Rivers and is the first event for the new year 12 to engage its new responsibilities.

<p>The course varies between 3 and 3.5 Kilometres depending on year level and gender and also the time to beat varies, ranging from 30 to 40 minutes to earn extra points. The Cross Country is run over the rolling hills nearby and is notoriously easy to walk yet very challenging to run.</p>

<p>St John&#39;s day has recently been combined with the college youth day to become &#34;St John&#39;s Youth Day&#34; and is the event where Yr 12 takes control and has some fun with half the day dedicated to fun activities designed by Year 12&#39;s for the rest of the college to enjoy. The profits made from the events go back through the school in the fashion of the Year 12 gift at the end of their years.<br/></p>
