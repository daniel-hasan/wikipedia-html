<p>On July 7, 1892, <a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Bonifacio" id="w">Andrés Bonifacio</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Warehouseman" id="w">warehouseman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Clerk" id="w">clerk</a> from <a href="/wiki/Manila" id="w">Manila</a>, founded the <i><a href="/wiki/Katipunan" id="w">Katipunan</a></i>, a secret organization which aimed to gain independence from Spanish colonial rule by armed revolt. The <i>Katipunan</i> spread throughout the provinces, and the <a href="/wiki/Philippine_Revolution" id="w">Philippine Revolution</a> of 1896 was led by its members.<sup id="_ref-agoncillo_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-agoncillo" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Past_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Past" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>While a charismatic and decisive figure, Bonifacio suffered defeats at the hands of the Spaniards in battles he personally led, including the very first major battle at <a href="/wiki/San_Juan_del_Monte" id="w">San Juan del Monte</a>, Manila (now <a href="/wiki/Pinaglabanan" id="w">Pinaglabanan</a>).<sup id="_ref-agoncillo_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-agoncillo" title="">[3]</a></sup> Some historians have thus considered him an ineffectual military leader, but others have argued the opposite by virtue of <a href="/wiki/Chain_of_command" id="w">chain of command</a> as other lower-ranking commanders whom he directed were successful.<sup id="_ref-guerrero_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guerrero" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Fighters in <a href="/wiki/Cavite" id="w">Cavite</a> province won early victories. One of the most influential and popular Caviteño leaders was <a href="/wiki/Emilio_Aguinaldo" id="w">Emilio Aguinaldo</a>, mayor of <a href="/wiki/Kawit%2C_Cavite" id="w">Cavite El Viejo</a> (modern-day <a href="/wiki/Kawit%2C_Cavite" id="w">Kawit</a>), who now controlled much of eastern Cavite. Eventually, Aguinaldo and his faction gained control of the movement. The <i>Katipunan</i> was superseded by a revolutionary government, of which Aguinaldo was elected president, and the “outmaneuvered”<sup id="_ref-Past_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Past" title="">[4]</a></sup> Bonifacio was executed for treason.<sup id="_ref-agoncillo_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-agoncillo" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Past_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Past" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The conflict between Bonifacio and Aguinaldo has subsquently become a controversial matter among Filipino historians. At least one, <a href="/wiki/Nick_Joaquin" id="w">Nick Joaquin</a>, has opined that the Revolution of 1896 as led by the Caviteños is to be distinguished from Bonifacio&#39;s failed uprising in Manila.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Others such as <a href="/wiki/Teodoro_Agoncillo" id="w">Teodoro Agoncillo</a> and Milagros C. Guerrero have noted that Bonifacio organized the <i>Katipunan</i> into a government prior to the outbreak of hostilities, with him as president.<sup id="_ref-agoncillo_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-agoncillo" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-guerrero_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guerrero" title="">[5]</a></sup> This government was called <i>Republika ng Katagalugan</i>, after &#34;<a href="/wiki/Tagalog_people" id="w">Tagalog</a>&#34;, the name of an ethnic group, used to refer to all natives.<sup id="_ref-guerrero_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guerrero" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Regardless, Aguindalo&#39;s national government and presidency are usually considered the first in Philippine history.</p>

<p>By December 1897, the futility of the struggle was becoming apparent on both sides and came to a stalemate. In August 1897, armistice negotiations were opened between Aguinaldo and the current Spanish governor-general, <a href="/wiki/Fernando_Primo_de_Rivera" id="w">Fernando Primo de Rivera</a>. By mid-December, an agreement was reached in which the governor would pay Aguinaldo a sum described in the agreement as &#34;$800,000 (Mexican)&#34; in three installments if Aguinaldo would go into exile.<sup id="_ref-Aguinaldo1899ch2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Aguinaldo1899ch2" title="">[7]</a></sup> Aguinaldo then established himself in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a>.<sup id="_ref-Aguinaldo1899ch2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Aguinaldo1899ch2" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-agoncillo_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-agoncillo" title="">[3]</a></sup> Before leaving, Aguinaldo denounced the Revolution, exhorted Filipino combatants to disarm and declared those who continued hostilities to be bandits.<sup id="_ref-Past_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Past" title="">[4]</a></sup> However, some Filipino revolutionaries did continue armed struggle against the Spanish colonial government.<sup id="_ref-Past_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Past" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-novel_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-novel" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-timeline_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timeline" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-brands_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brands" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-David_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-David" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Aguinaldo wrote retrospectively in 1899 that he had met with U.S. <a href="/wiki/Consul" id="w">Consuls</a> E. Spencer Pratt and Rounceville Wildman in Singapore between 22 and 25 April, and that they persuaded him to again take up the mantle of leadership in the revolution, with Pratt communicating with Admiral Dewey by telegram, passing assurances from Dewey to Aguinaldo that the United States would at least recognize the Independence of the Philippines under the protection of the United States Navy, and adding that there was no necessity for entering into a formal written agreement because the word of the Admiral and of the United States Consul were in fact equivalent to the most solemn pledge that their verbal promises and assurance would be fulfilled to the letter and were not to be classed with Spanish promises or Spanish ideas of a man’s word of honour.<sup id="_ref-Aguinaldo1899ch3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Aguinaldo1899ch3" title="">[13]</a></sup> Aguinaldo reports agreeing to return to the Philippines, traveling from Singapore to Hong Kong aboard the steamship <i>Malacca</i>, onwards from Hong Kong on American despatch-boat <i>McCulloch</i>, and arriving in Cavite on May 19.<sup id="_ref-Aguinaldo1899ch3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Aguinaldo1899ch3" title="">[13]</a></sup>  The New York Times wrote on <a href="/wiki/August_6" id="w">August 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1899" id="w">1899</a> that Pratt had obtained a court order enjoining the publication of certain statements &#34;... which might be regarded as showing a positive connection&#34; between himself and Aguinaldo.<sup id="_ref-NYTimes1899-08-26_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYTimes1899-08-26" title="">[14]</a></sup>  The Times reports the court ruling to uphold Mr. Pratt&#39;s position that he had &#34;no dealings of a political character&#34; with Aguinaldo and the book publisher withdrew from publication statements to the contrary.<sup id="_ref-NYTimes1899-08-26_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYTimes1899-08-26" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In Cavite, Aguinaldo reports meeting with Admiral Dewey, and recalls: &#34;I asked whether it was true that he had sent all the telegrams to the Consul at Singapore, Mr. Pratt, which that gentleman had told me he received in regard to myself. The Admiral replied in the affirmative, adding that the United States had come to the Philippines to protect the natives and free them from the yoke of Spain. He said, moreover, that America is exceedingly well off as regards territory, revenue, and resources and therefore needs no colonies, assuring me finally that there was no occasion for me to entertain any doubts whatever about the recognition of the Independence of the Philippines by the United States.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Aguinaldo1899ch3_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Aguinaldo1899ch3" title="">[13]</a></sup> By late May, Dewey had been ordered by the U.S.  <a href="/wiki/Department_of_the_Navy" id="w">Department of the Navy</a> to distance himself from Aguinaldo lest he make untoward commitments to the Philippine forces.<sup id="_ref-LOC-outbreak_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LOC-outbreak" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a matter of months after Aguinaldo&#39;s return, the Philippine Army conquered nearly all of Spanish-held ground within the Philippines. With the exception of Manila, which was completely surrounded by the Philippine Army of 12,000, the Filipinos now controlled the Philippines. Aguinaldo also turned over 15,000 Spanish prisoners to the Americans, offering them valuable intelligence. On <a href="/wiki/June_12" id="w">June 12</a>, Aguinaldo declared <a href="/wiki/Philippine_Declaration_of_Independence" id="w">independence</a> at his house in Cavite El Viejo.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_13" id="w">August 13</a>, with American commanders unaware that a peace protocol had been signed between Spain and the United States on the previous day, American forces captured the city of Manila from the Spanish.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Governor-General Fermin Jaudenes had made a secret agreement with Dewey and General <a href="/wiki/Wesley_Merritt" id="w">Wesley Merritt</a>. Jaudenes specifically requested to surrender only to the Americans, not to the Filipino rebels. In order to save face, he proposed a mock battle with the Americans preceding the Spanish surrender; the Filipinos would not even be allowed to enter the city. Dewey and Merritt agreed to this, and no one else in either camp knew about the agreement. On the eve of the mock battle, General <a href="/wiki/Thomas_M._Anderson" id="w">Thomas M. Anderson</a> telegraphed Aguinaldo, “Do not let your troops enter Manila without the permission of the American commander. On this side of the Pasig River you will be under fire”.<sup id="_ref-agoncillo_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-agoncillo" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the beginning of the war between Spain and America, Americans and Filipinos had been allies against Spain in all but name; now Spanish and Americans were in a partnership that excluded the Filipino insurgents. Fighting between American and Filipino troops almost broke out as the former moved in to dislodge the latter from strategic positions around Manila on the eve of the attack. Aguinaldo had been told bluntly by the Americans that his army could not participate and would be fired upon if it crossed into the city. The insurgents were infuriated at being denied triumphant entry into their own capital, but Aguinaldo bided his time. Relations continued to deteriorate, however, as it became clear to Filipinos that the Americans were in the islands to stay.<sup id="_ref-LOC-outbreak_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LOC-outbreak" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/June_12" id="w">June 12</a> declaration of Philippine independence had not been recognized by either the United States or Spain, and the Spanish government ceded the Philippines to the United States in the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1898)" id="w">1898 Treaty of Paris</a>, which was signed on <a href="/wiki/December_10" id="w">December 10</a> <a href="/wiki/1898" id="w">1898</a>, in consideration for an indemnity for Spanish expenses and assets lost. </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/January_1" id="w">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1899" id="w">1899</a>, Aguinaldo was declared <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Philippines" id="w">President of the Philippines</a> — the first and only president of what would be later called the <a href="/wiki/First_Philippine_Republic" id="w">First Philippine Republic</a>. He later organized a Congress at <a href="/wiki/Malolos" id="w">Malolos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bulacan" id="w">Bulacan</a> to draft a <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Philippines" id="w">constitution</a>.<sup id="_ref-agoncillo_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-agoncillo" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Admiral Dewey later argued that he had promised nothing regarding the future:</p>

In December 1898, the U.S. purchased the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam from <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a> as part of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1898)" id="w">Treaty of Paris</a> for the sum of <a href="/wiki/United_States_Dollar" id="w">US $20</a> million, after the U.S. defeated <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Spanish-American_War" id="w">Spanish-American War</a>. The U.S. government made plans to make the Philippines an American territory. However, the Filipinos, fighting for <a href="/wiki/Philippine_independence" id="w">independence</a> from Spain since 1896, had already declared independence on <a href="/wiki/June_12" id="w">June 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1898" id="w">1898</a>, and had considered the Americans allies.</p>
<p>Tensions between the Philippine and the American governments existed because of the conflicting movements for independence and colonization, aggravated by the feelings of betrayal on the part of Aguinaldo, who had been brought to the islands by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" id="w">United States Navy</a> on the understanding that the Americans would help his cause.</p>
<a id="First_shots" name="First_shots"></a><h2> First shots </h2>
<p>One common view of how the conflict began was that on <a href="/wiki/February_4" id="w">February 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1899" id="w">1899</a>, a misunderstanding occurred between the two nations. A Filipino soldier was shot by an American soldier, <a href="/wiki/William_W._Grayson" id="w">William W. Grayson</a>, at now Silencio Street, Manila. Grayson&#39;s own account states:</p>
<p>{{quote}}</p>
<p>It is believed{{who}} that American aggression led to the first shot that sparked the war. McKinley himself encouraged his commanders to shoot first, ask later.{{Fact}} Another view posits he was probably drunk.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Fighting soon erupted in <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Manila_(1899)" id="w">Manila</a>. It caused 2,000 casualties for Filipinos and 250 for the Americans. One Lt. Alfred C. Alford of the Kansas 20th may well be among the first Americans to perish in the conflict; he was <a href="/wiki/Killed_in_action" id="w">killed in action</a> in an advance on February 6.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo subsequently tried to stop the hostilities and sent emissaries to the Americans, but General <a href="/wiki/Elwell_Otis" id="w">Elwell Otis</a> replied: &#34;Fighting having begun, must go on to the grim end.&#34;<sup id="_ref-agoncillo_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-agoncillo" title="">[3]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">U.S. President</a> <a href="/wiki/William_McKinley" id="w">William McKinley</a> later told reporters “that the <i>insurgents</i> had attacked <a href="/wiki/Manila" id="w">Manila</a>” in justifying war on the Philippines.</p>
<p>The McKinley administration subsequently declared Aguinaldo to be an “outlaw bandit”, and no formal <a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_war" id="w">declaration of war</a> was ever issued. Two reasons have been suggested for this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Calling the war the <i>Philippine Insurrection</i> made it appear to be a rebellion against a lawful government.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></li>

An American military force of 126,000 soldiers was needed to conquer the country, and the force was regularly engaged in war against Filipino forces for another decade. Also, <a href="/wiki/Macabebe" id="w">Macabebe</a> Filipinos were recruited by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" id="w">United States Army</a>.

<p>By the end of February 1899, the Americans had prevailed in the struggle for Manila, and the Philippine Army was forced to retreat north.

<a id="Guerrilla_war_phase" name="Guerrilla_war_phase"></a><h2> Guerrilla war phase </h2>
<p>In 1900, Aguinaldo shifted from conventional to guerrilla warfare, a means of operation which better suited their disadvantaged situation and made American occupation of the Philippine <a href="/wiki/Archipelago" id="w">archipelago</a> all the more difficult over the next few years. In fact, during just the first four months of the guerrilla war, the Americans had nearly 500 casualties. The Philippine Army began staging bloody ambushes and raids, such as the guerrilla victories at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Paye" id="w">Paye</a>, <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Catubig" id="w">Catubig</a>, <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Makahambus" id="w">Makahambus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Pulang_Lupa" id="w">Pulang Lupa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Balangiga_Massacre" id="w">Balangiga</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Mabitac" id="w">Mabitac</a>. At first, it even seemed as if the Filipinos would fight the Americans to a stalemate and force them to withdraw. This was even considered by President McKinley at the beginning of the phase.</p>
<p>The shift to guerrilla warfare, however, only angered the Americans into acting more ruthlessly than before. They began taking no prisoners, burning whole villages, and routinely shooting surrendering Filipino soldiers. Much worse were the <a href="/wiki/Concentration_camps" id="w">concentration camps</a> that civilians were forced into, after being suspected of being guerrilla sympathizers. Thousands of civilians died in these camps. In nearly all cases, the civilians suffered much more than the guerrillas.</p>
<p>The subsequent American repression towards the population tremendously reduced the materials, men, and morale of many Filipino soldiers, compelling them in one way or another to surrender.</p>

<p>The Philippine Army continued suffering defeats from the better armed American Army during the conventional warfare phase, forcing Aguinaldo to continuously change his base of operations, which he did for nearly the length of the entire war.</p>

On <a href="/wiki/March_23" id="w">March 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1901" id="w">1901</a>, General <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Funston" id="w">Frederick Funston</a> and his troops captured Aguinaldo in <a href="/wiki/Palanan%2C_Isabela" id="w">Palanan, Isabela</a>, with the help of some Filipinos (called the <a href="/wiki/Macabebe%2C_Pampanga" id="w">Macabebe Scouts</a> after their home locale) who had joined the Americans&#39; side. The Americans pretended to be captives of the Macabebes, who were dressed in Philippine Army uniforms. Once Funston and his “captors” entered Aguinaldo&#39;s camp, they immediately fell upon the guards and quickly overwhelmed them and the weary Aguinaldo.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_1" id="w">April 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1901" id="w">1901</a>, at the <a href="/wiki/Malaca%C3%B1ang_Palace" id="w">Malacañang Palace</a> in Manila, Aguinaldo swore an oath accepting the authority of the United States over the Philippines and pledging his allegiance to the American government. Three weeks later he publicly called on his followers to lay down arms. “Let the stream of blood cease to flow; let there be an end to tears and desolation,” Aguinaldo said. “The lesson which the war holds out and the significance of which I realized only recently, leads me to the firm conviction that the complete termination of hostilities and a lasting peace are not only desirable but also absolutely essential for the well-being of the Philippines.”<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>The capture of Aguinaldo dealt a severe blow to the Filipino cause, but not as much as the Americans had hoped. The less competent General <a href="/wiki/Mariano_Trias" id="w">Mariano Trias</a> succeeded him but surrendered shortly after.
Command then fell to the highly regarded General <a href="/wiki/Miguel_Malvar" id="w">Miguel Malvar</a>{{Fact}}, who originally had taken a defensive stance against the Americans, but now launched all-out offensives against the American-held towns in the <a href="/wiki/Batangas" id="w">Batangas</a> region. Though his victories were small, they were a testament that the war was not yet over.</p>
<p>In response, General <a href="/wiki/J._Franklin_Bell" id="w">J. Franklin Bell</a> performed tactics that countered Malvar&#39;s guerrilla strategy. Forcing civilians to live in hamlets, interrogating suspected guerrillas (and regular civilians alike), and his execution of <a href="/wiki/Scorched_earth" id="w">scorched earth</a> campaigns took a heavy toll on the Filipino revolutionaries.</p>
<p>Bell also relentlessly pursued Malvar and his men, breaking ranks, dropping morale, and forcing the surrender of many of the Filipino soldiers. Finally, in April 1902, after barely escaping capture, Malvar surrendered along with his sick wife and children and some of his most trusted officers who stood with him until the end. By the end of the month, nearly 3,000 of Malvar&#39;s men also surrendered.</p>
<p>With the surrender of Malvar, the last truly capable general of the Philippine Army,{{Fact}} the Filipino fight began to dwindle even further. Command changed hands frequently, as each general, one after another, was killed, captured, or surrendered.</p>
<p>The United States government declared the conflict officially over in 1902. The Filipino leaders, for the most part, accepted that the Americans had won.</p>
<a id="Post-1902_hostilities" name="Post-1902_hostilities"></a><h3>Post-1902 hostilities</h3>
<p>Some Filipino nationalist historians like <a href="/wiki/Renato_Constantino" id="w">Renato Constantino</a> have suggested that the war unofficially continued for nearly a decade, since bands of guerrillas, quasi-religious armed groups and other resistance groups continued to roam the countryside, still clashing with American Army or Philippine Constabulary patrols.<sup id="_ref-Past_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Past" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Simeon Ola of <a href="/wiki/Guinobatan%2C_Albay" id="w">Guinobatan, Albay</a> in the Bicol region has been suggested as the last Filipino general to surrender (on September 25, 1903) in place of Malvar.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1902, a veteran <i>Katipunan</i> member  and self-proclaimed <i>generalisimo</i> named <a href="/wiki/Macario_Sakay" id="w">Macario Sakay</a> attempted to form <a href="/wiki/Katagalugan" id="w">his own Republic</a>, called <i>Katagalugan</i> after Bonifacio&#39;s, in southern <a href="/wiki/Luzon" id="w">Luzon</a>.

<p>Quasi-religious armed groups included the <i>pulajanes</i> (so called because of their red garments), <i>colorum</i> (from a corruption of the Latin <i>in saecula saeculorum</i>, part of the <a href="/wiki/Glory_Be_to_the_Father" id="w">Glory Be to the Father</a> prayer), and <i>Dios-Dios</i> (literally &#34;God-God&#34;) groups of assorted provinces . These groups were mostly composed of farmers and other poor people led by messianic leaders, and they subscribed to a blend of <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" id="w">Roman Catholicism</a> and folk beliefs. For example, they used <a href="/wiki/Amulet" id="w">amulets</a> (called <i>agimat</i> or <i>anting-anting</i>), believing they would become bulletproof. One of these leaders was Dionisio Seguela, better known as <a href="/wiki/Papa_Isio" id="w">Papa Isio</a> (<i>Pope Isio</i>).  The last of these groups were wiped out or had surrendered by 1913.<sup id="_ref-Past_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Past" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>These resistance movements were all dismissed by the American government as banditry, fanaticism or cattle rustling.<sup id="_ref-Past_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Past" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="American_opposition_to_the_war" name="American_opposition_to_the_war"></a><h2> American opposition to the war </h2>
<p>Some Americans, notably William Jennings Bryan, <a href="/wiki/Mark_Twain" id="w">Mark Twain</a>, <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie" id="w">Andrew Carnegie</a>, Ernest Crosby, and other members of the <a href="/wiki/American_Anti-Imperialist_League" id="w">American Anti-Imperialist League</a>, strongly objected to the annexation of the Philippines. Other Americans mistakenly thought that the Philippines wanted to become part of the United States. Anti-imperialist movements claimed that the United States had betrayed its lofty goals of the Spanish–American War by becoming a <a href="/wiki/Colonialism" id="w">colonial</a> power, merely replacing Spain in the Philippines. Other anti-imperialists opposed annexation on <a href="/wiki/Racism" id="w">racist</a> grounds.

<p><a href="/wiki/Mark_Twain" id="w">Mark Twain</a> famously opposed the war by using his influence in the press. He felt it betrayed the ideals of American democracy by not allowing the Filipino people to choose their own destiny.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Some Filipinos wounded by the fighting in 1899</div></div>

During the war 4,324 American soldiers died, 1,000–1,500 of which were from actual combat; the remainder died of disease. 2,818 were wounded. There were also 2,000 casualties that the <a href="/wiki/Philippine_Constabulary" id="w">Philippine Constabulary</a> suffered during the war, over one thousand of which were fatalities. Philippine military deaths are estimated at 20,000 with 16,000 actually counted, while civilian deaths numbered between 250,000 and 1,000,000 Filipinos. These numbers take into account those killed by war, malnutrition, and a <a href="/wiki/Cholera" id="w">cholera</a> epidemic that raged during the war.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> The Philippine-American War Centennial Initiative gives an estimate of 510,000 civilian deaths, and 20,000 military deaths, excluding 100,000 deaths from the Moro Rebellion.{{Fact}} The American military and Philippine Constabulary still suffered periodic losses combating small bands of Moro guerillas in the far south until 1913.</p>
<p>The high Filipino casualty figures were a combination of the superior arms and even more superior numbers of the Americans, who were equipped with the most modern, up-to-date weapons in the world, including superb <a href="/wiki/Krag-J%C3%B8rgensen#American Krag-Jørgensen rifles" id="w">Krag-Jørgensen</a> bolt-action rifles and <a href="/wiki/Machine_gun" id="w">machine guns</a>, and who were also well-led. Furthermore, U.S. warships stood ready to destroy Philippine positions when needed. In contrast, the Filipinos were armed with a motley collection of rifles such as <a href="/wiki/Mauser" id="w">Mausers</a>, many which had been taken from dead enemy soldiers or smuggled into the country by their fellow Filipinos. Their <a href="/wiki/Artillery" id="w">artillery</a> was not much better, consisting mostly of worn-out artillery pieces captured from the Spanish. Although they did have a few <a href="/wiki/Maxim_gun" id="w">Maxim</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gatling_gun" id="w">Gatling</a> machine guns, along with a few modern <a href="/wiki/Krupp" id="w">Krupp</a> artillery pieces, these were highly prized and taken to the rear for fear of capture before they could play any decisive role. Ammunition and rifles became more scarce as the war dragged on, and Filipinos were forced to manufacture their own, like the homemade <i><a href="/wiki/Paltik" id="w">paltik</a></i>. Still most did not even have firearms. Many used <a href="/wiki/Bolo_knife" id="w">bolos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spear" id="w">spears</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lance" id="w">lances</a> in fighting, which also contributed to high casualty figures when such obsolete weapons were used against the Americans&#39; superior arms. However the Filipinos did have the advantage of knowing their own country and rough terrain well, in contrast to the Americans who were fighting on foreign terrain.</p>
<p>In recognition of United States military service during the Philippine-American War, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_military" id="w">United States military</a> created two service decorations which were known as the <a href="/wiki/Philippine_Campaign_Medal" id="w">Philippine Campaign Medal</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Philippine_Congressional_Medal" id="w">Philippine Congressional Medal</a>.</p>
<p>In 1916, the United States granted the Philippines self-government and promised eventual independence, which came in 1946.</p>

<p>In 1908, <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Arellano_Remondo" id="w">Manuel Arellano Remondo</a>, in a book entitled &#34;General Geography of the Philippine Islands&#34;, wrote:
“The population decreased due to the wars, in the five-year period
from 1895 to 1900, since, at the start of the first insurrection, the population was estimated at 9,000,000, and at present (1908), the inhabitants of the Archipelago do not exceed 8,000,000 in number.”<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>U.S. attacks into the countryside often included scorched earth campaigns where entire villages were burned and destroyed, torture (<i><a href="/wiki/Water_cure" id="w">water cure</a></i>) and the concentration of civilians into “protected zones” (<i><a href="/wiki/Concentration_camps" id="w">concentration camps</a></i>). Many of the civilian casualties resulted from disease and famine.</p>
<a id="American_soldiers'_letters_and_response" name="American_soldiers'_letters_and_response"></a><h4> American soldiers&#39; letters and response </h4>
<p>From almost the beginning of the war, soldiers wrote home describing, and usually bragging about, atrocities committed against Filipinos, soldiers and civilians alike. Increasingly, such personal letters, or portions of them, reached a national audience as anti-imperialist editors across the nation reproduced them.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>Once these accounts were widely reproduced, the War Department was forced to demand that General Otis investigate their authenticity. For each press clipping, he forwarded it to the writer’s commanding officer, who would then convince the soldier to write a retraction.</p>
<p>Private Charles Brenner of the <a href="/wiki/Kansas" id="w">Kansas</a> regiment resisted such pressure. He insisted that <a href="/wiki/Colonel_Funston" id="w">Colonel Funston</a><sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> had ordered that all prisoners be shot and that Major Metcalf and Captain Bishop enforced these orders. Otis was obliged to order the Northern Luzon sector commander, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_MacArthur%2C_Jr." id="w">General MacArthur</a>, to look into the charge. Brenner confronted MacArthur’s aide with a corroborating witness, Private Putman, who confessed to shooting two prisoners after Bishop or Metcalf ordered, “Kill them! Damn it, Kill them!” MacArthur sent his aide’s report on to Otis with no comment. Otis ordered Brenner court-martialed “for writing and conniving at the publication of an article which... contains willful falsehoods concerning himself and a false charge against Captain Bishop.” The judge advocate in Manila convinced Otis that such a trial could open a <a href="/wiki/Pandora%E2%80%99s_box" id="w">Pandora’s box</a> because “facts would develop implicating many others.”</p>
<p>General Otis sent the Brenner case to Washington writing: “After mature deliberation, I doubt the wisdom of court-martial in this case, as it would give the insurgent authorities a knowledge of what was taking place and they would assert positively that our troops had practiced inhumanities, whether the charge should be proven or not, as they would use it as an excuse to defend their own barbarities;” and Otis went on, justifying the war crimes, “and it is not thought that his charge is very grievous under the circumstances then existing, as it was very early in the war, and the patience of our men was under great strain.”<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Towards the end of 1899, General Otis attempted to repair his battered image. He began to work to win new friends among the journalists in Manila and bestowed favors on any journalist who gave him favorable press.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Concentration_camps" name="Concentration_camps"></a><h4> Concentration camps </h4>
<p>As one historian wrote about <a href="/wiki/Marinduque" id="w">Marinduque</a>, the first island with concentration camps:</p>
<dl><dd>“The triple press of concentration (camps), devastation, and harassment led Abad (the Marinduque commander) …to request a truce to negotiate surrender terms… The Army pacified Marinduque not by winning the allegiance of the people, but by imposing coercive measures to control their behavior and separate them from the insurgents in the field. Ultimately, military and security measures proved to be the (essential element) of Philippine pacification.”<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>This assessment could probably be applied to all of the Philippines.</p>
<a id="Filipino_atrocities" name="Filipino_atrocities"></a><h3> Filipino atrocities </h3>
<p>To counter the bad press back in America, General Otis stated that insurgents tortured American prisoners in “fiendish fashion”, some of whom were buried alive, or worse, up to their necks in anthills to be slowly devoured. Others were castrated, had the removed parts stuffed into their mouths, and were then left to suffocate or bleed to death. It was also stated that some prisoners were deliberately infected with <a href="/wiki/Leprosy" id="w">leprosy</a> before being released to spread the disease among their comrades. Spanish priests were horribly mutilated before their congregations, and natives who refused to support Emilio Aguinaldo were slaughtered by the thousands. American newspaper headlines announced the “Murder and Rapine” by the “Fiendish Filipinos.” <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Wheeler" id="w">General “Fighting Joe” Wheeler</a> insisted that it was the Filipinos who had mutilated their own dead, murdered women and children, and burned down villages, solely to discredit American soldiers.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other events dubbed atrocities included those by General <a href="/wiki/Vicente_Lukban" id="w">Vicente Lukban</a>, the Filipino commander who masterminded the <a href="/wiki/Balangiga_Massacre" id="w">Balangiga Massacre</a> in <a href="/wiki/Samar" id="w">Samar</a> province, a surprise attack that killed over fifty American soldiers. Media reports stated that many of the bodies were mutilated.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> The attack itself triggered American reprisals in Samar, ordered by General <a href="/wiki/Jacob_H._Smith" id="w">Jacob Hurd Smith</a>, who said, &#34;I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn, the more you kill and burn the better it will please me. I want all persons killed who are capable of bearing arms in actual hostilities against the United States&#34;, and defined this as everyone over ten years old. To his credit, Major <a href="/wiki/Littleton_Waller" id="w">Littleton Waller</a> countermanded it to his own men. Nevertheless, some of his men &#34;undoubtedly&#34; carried out atrocities.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sergeant Hallock testified in the <a href="/wiki/Lodge_Committee" id="w">Lodge Committee</a> that natives were given the <a href="/wiki/Water_cure" id="w">water cure</a>, “…in order to secure information of the murder of Private O&#39;Herne of Company I, who had been not only killed, but roasted and otherwise tortured before death ensued.”<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the Filipino side, information regarding atrocities comes from the eyewitnesses and the participants themselves. In his <i>History of the Filipino People</i> <a href="/wiki/Teodoro_Agoncillo" id="w">Teodoro Agoncillo</a> writes that the Filipino troops could match and even exceed the Americans&#39; penchant for brutality. Kicking, slapping, and spitting at faces were common. In some cases, ears and noses were cut off and salt applied to the wounds. In other cases, captives were buried alive. These atrocities occurred regardless of Aguinaldo&#39;s orders and circulars concerning the good treatment of prisoners.<sup id="_ref-agoncillo_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-agoncillo" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reporters_and_Red_Cross_accounts_contradict_Otis" name="Reporters_and_Red_Cross_accounts_contradict_Otis"></a><h3> Reporters and Red Cross accounts contradict Otis </h3>
<p>During the closing months of 1899, Emilio Aguinaldo attempted to counter General Otis’s account by suggesting that neutral parties — foreign journalists or representatives of the <a href="/wiki/International_Red_Cross" id="w">International Red Cross</a> — inspect his military operations. Otis refused, but Emilio Aguinaldo managed to smuggle in four reporters — two English, one Canadian, and a Japanese — into the Philippines. The correspondents returned to Manila to report that American captives were “treated more like guests than prisoners,” were “fed the best that the country affords, and everything is done to gain their favor.” The story went on to say that American prisoners were offered commissions in the Filipino army and that three had accepted. The four reporters were expelled from the Philippines as soon as their stories were printed.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Emilio Aguinaldo also released some American prisoners so they could tell their own stories. In a <a href="/wiki/Boston_Globe" id="w">Boston Globe</a> article entitled “With the Goo Goo’s” Paul Spillane described his fair treatment as a prisoner. Emilio Aguinaldo had even invited American captives to the christening of his baby and had given each a present of four dollars, Spillane recounted.</p>
<p>Naval Lieutenant J.C. Gilmore, whose release was forced by American cavalry pursuing Aguinaldo into the mountains, insisted that he had received “considerable treatment” and that he was no more starved than were his captors. Otis responded to these two articles by ordering the “capture” of the two authors, and that they be “investigated”, therefore questioning their loyalty.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>When F.A. Blake of the International Red Cross arrived at Emilio Aguinaldo’s request, Otis kept him confined to Manila, where Otis’s staff explained all of the Filipinos&#39; violations of civilized warfare. Blake managed to slip away from an escort and venture into the field. Blake never made it past American lines, but even within American lines he saw burned out villages and “horribly mutilated bodies, with stomachs slit open and occasionally decapitated.” Blake waited to return to <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" id="w">San Francisco</a>, where he told one reporter that “American soldiers are determined to kill every Filipino in sight.”<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Ratio_of_Filipinos_wounded" name="Ratio_of_Filipinos_wounded"></a><h3> Ratio of Filipinos wounded </h3>
<p>The most conclusive evidence that the enemy wounded were being killed, came from the official reports of Otis and his successor, General <a href="/wiki/Arthur_MacArthur%2C_Jr." id="w">Arthur MacArthur, Jr.</a>, which claimed fifteen Filipinos killed for every one wounded. In the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>, the ratio had been five wounded for every soldier killed, which is close to historical norm. Otis attempted to explain this anomaly by the superior marksmanship of rural southerners and westerners in the U.S. military, who had hunted all their lives.
MacArthur added a racial twist, asserting that Anglo-Saxons do not succumb to wounds as easily as do men of “inferior races.”<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the south, Muslim Filipinos resisted until 1913— the so-called <a href="/wiki/Moro_rebellion" id="w">Moro rebellion</a>. They were never part of Aguinaldo&#39;s movement but independently fought the Americans.</p>
<p>During this conflict, the Americans realized a need to be able to stop a charging tribesman with a single shot. To fill this need, the <a href="/wiki/M1911_pistol" id="w">M1911 pistol</a> was later developed using larger caliber ammunition (<a href="/wiki/.45_ACP" id="w">.45 ACP</a>), resulting in additional <a href="/wiki/Stopping_power" id="w">stopping power</a>.

<p>The Roman Catholic Church was disestablished, and a considerable amount of church land was purchased and redistributed. However, the bulk of the land was quickly bought up by American companies with little going to Filipino peasants.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>During the U.S. occupation, <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> was declared the official language, although the languages of the Philippine people were <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" id="w">Spanish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Visayan_languages" id="w">Visayan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tagalog_language" id="w">Tagalog</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ilokano_language" id="w">Ilokano</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pangasinan_language" id="w">Pangasinan</a> and other native languages. The English requirement barred many from political office and ensured a dependency on American administrators.</p>
<p>Also, five hundred and forty American teachers were imported aboard the <i><a href="/wiki/USS_Thomas" id="w">USS Thomas</a></i>. The first task of the <a href="/wiki/Thomasites" id="w">Thomasites</a> was to reform the education system to one that maintained an anti-Spanish curriculum but glossed over existing American atrocities.{{Fact}} It also ensured that <a href="/wiki/Filipino_nationalism" id="w">Filipino nationalism</a> would rise no more as an important force..</p>
