Despite having an estimated population of 175,255 as of 2006, it anchors the <a href="/wiki/List_of_United_States_metropolitan_areas" id="w">36th</a> <a href="/wiki/Providence_metropolitan_area" id="w">largest metropolitan population</a> in the country, with an estimated <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_areas" id="w">MSA</a> population of 1,622,520, exceeding that of Rhode Island by about 60% due to its reaching into southern <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Massachusetts</a>.<sup id="_ref-metro_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-metro" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Situated at the mouth of the <a href="/wiki/Providence_River" id="w">Providence River</a>, on <a href="/wiki/Narragansett_Bay" id="w">Narragansett Bay</a>, the city&#39;s small footprint is crisscrossed by seemingly erratic streets and a rapidly changing demographic using them.</p>
<p>Providence was founded in 1636 by <a href="/wiki/Roger_Williams_(theologian)" id="w">Roger Williams</a>, a religious exile from the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony" id="w">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a>. He named the area in honor of &#34;God&#39;s merciful Providence&#34; which he believed was responsible for his finding such a haven to settle. After being one of the first cities in the country to industrialize, Providence became noted for its <a href="/wiki/Jewelry" id="w">jewelry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Silver_(household)" id="w">silverware</a> industry.  Today, Providence city proper alone is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning, which has shifted the former&#39;s economy into service industries, though it still retains significant manufacturing work. The city was once nicknamed the &#34;Beehive of Industry&#34;, while today &#34;The Renaissance City&#34; is more common, though as of 2000 census, its poverty rate was still among the ten highest for cities over 100,000.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-poverty_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-poverty" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

The area which is now Providence was first settled in June 1636 by <a href="/wiki/Roger_Williams_(theologian)" id="w">Roger Williams</a>, and was one of the original <a href="/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies" id="w">Thirteen Colonies</a> of the United States.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Williams secured a title from the <a href="/wiki/Narragansett_(tribe)" id="w">Narragansett</a> natives around this time and gave the city its present name. Williams also cultivated Providence as a refuge for persecuted religious dissenters, as he himself had been exiled from <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Massachusetts</a>.<sup id="_ref-3.5-centuries_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3.5-centuries" title="">[9]</a></sup> Providence&#39;s growth would be slow during the next quarter-century &#8212; the subsuming of its territory into surrounding towns, difficulty of farming the land, and differing of local traditions and land conflicts all slowed development.<sup id="_ref-3.5-centuries_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3.5-centuries" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>

In the mid-1770s, the British government levied taxes that impeded Providence&#39;s maritime, fishing and agricultural industries, the mainstay of the city&#39;s economy.  One example was the <a href="/wiki/Sugar_Act" id="w">Sugar Act</a>, which impacted Providence&#39;s distilleries and its trade in rum and slaves. These taxes caused Providence to join the other colonies in renouncing allegiance to the British Crown. In response to enforcement of unpopular trade laws, Providence residents spilled the first blood of the American Revolution in the notorious <a href="/wiki/Gasp%C3%A9e_Affair" id="w">Gaspée Affair</a> of 1772.<sup id="_ref-3.5-centuries_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3.5-centuries" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though during the <a href="/wiki/Revolutionary_War" id="w">Revolutionary War</a> the city escaped enemy occupation, the capture of nearby <a href="/wiki/Newport%2C_Rhode_Island" id="w">Newport</a> disrupted industry and kept the population on alert. Troops were quartered for various campaigns and <a href="/wiki/Brown_University" id="w">Brown University</a>&#39;s University Hall was used as a barracks and military hospital.<sup id="_ref-3.5-centuries_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3.5-centuries" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Providence in the mid-20th century</div>
Following the war, the economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, particularly machinery, tools, silverware, jewelry and textiles. At one time, Providence boasted some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country, including <a href="/wiki/Brown_%26amp%3B_Sharpe" id="w">Brown &#38; Sharpe</a>, Nicholson File, and Gorham Silverware, and was the country&#39;s ninth-largest city<sup id="_ref-3.5-centuries_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3.5-centuries" title="">[9]</a></sup>  The city&#39;s industries attracted many immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Sweden, England, Italy, Portugal, Cape Verde, and French Canada. Economic and demographic shifts caused social strife, notably with a series of race riots between whites and blacks during the 1820s. In response to these troubles and the economic growth, Providence residents ratified a city charter in 1831.<sup id="_ref-3.5-centuries_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3.5-centuries" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">Civil War</a>, local politics split over slavery as many had ties to Southern cotton. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, the number of military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city&#39;s manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union. Providence thrived postwar, waves of immigrants and land annexations brought the population from 54,595 in 1865 to 175,597 by 1900.<sup id="_ref-3.5-centuries_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3.5-centuries" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The city began to see a decline by the mid-1920s as industries, notably textiles, shut down. The <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a> hit the city hard, and Providence&#39;s downtown was flooded by the <a href="/wiki/New_England_Hurricane_of_1938" id="w">New England Hurricane of 1938</a> soon after. The city saw further decline as a result of nation-wide trends, with the construction of highways and increased suburbanization.<sup id="_ref-3.5-centuries_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3.5-centuries" title="">[9]</a></sup> From the 1950s to the 1980s, Providence was a notorious bastion of <a href="/wiki/Organized_crime" id="w">organized crime</a>.<sup id="_ref-mob_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mob" title="">[10]</a></sup> The mafia boss <a href="/wiki/Raymond_L.S._Patriarca" id="w">Raymond L.S.

The city&#39;s eponymous &#34;Renaissance&#34; began in the 1970s. From 1975 until 1982, <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">$606</a> million of local and national Community Development funds were invested throughout the city, and the hitherto falling population began to stabilize. In the 1990s, Mayor <a href="/wiki/Vincent_Cianci%2C_Jr" id="w">Vincent Cianci, Jr</a> showcased the city&#39;s strength in arts and pushed for further revitalization, ultimately resulting in the opening up of the city&#39;s natural rivers (which had been paved over), relocation of a large section of railroad underground, creation of <a href="/wiki/Waterplace_Park" id="w">Waterplace Park</a> and river walks along the river&#39;s banks, and construction of the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Bank of America Skating Rink) in <a href="/wiki/Downtown%2C_Providence%2C_Rhode_Island" id="w">downtown</a> and the 1.4 million ft² <a href="/wiki/Providence_Place" id="w">Providence Place</a> Mall.<sup id="_ref-3.5-centuries_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3.5-centuries" title="">[9]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>New investment triggered within the city, with <a href="/wiki/Current_and_Recent_Construction_Projects_in_Providence" id="w">new construction</a> including numerous condo projects, hotels, and a new office highrise all filling in the freed space.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>  Despite new investment, poverty remains an entrenched problem as it does in most <a href="/wiki/Post-industrial" id="w">post-industrial</a> New England cities.  Nearly 30 percent of the city population lives below the poverty line.<sup id="_ref-census_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-census" title="">[13]</a></sup> Recent increases in real estate values further exacerbate problems for those at marginal income levels, as Providence had the highest rise in median housing price of any city in the United States from 2004 to 2005.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

The Providence city limits enclose a small geographic region, with a total area of 20.5&#160;square miles (53.2&#160;km²). 18.5&#160;square miles (47.8&#160;km²) of it is land and the remaining 2.1&#160;square miles (5.3&#160;km²) (roughly 10%) of it is water.</p>
<p>Providence is located at the head of <a href="/wiki/Narragansett_Bay" id="w">Narragansett Bay</a>, with the <a href="/wiki/Providence_River" id="w">Providence River</a> running into the bay through the center of the city,<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> formed by the confluence of the <a href="/wiki/Moshassuck_River" id="w">Moshassuck</a> and <a href="/wiki/Woonasquatucket_River" id="w">Woonasquatucket</a> Rivers.  The Waterplace Park amphitheater and riverwalks line the river&#39;s banks through <a href="/wiki/Downtown%2C_Providence%2C_Rhode_Island" id="w">downtown</a>. Constitution Hill (near downtown), College (or Prospect) Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and is New England&#39;s largest Italian district) are the most prominent of the city&#39;s hills.

The city of Providence is geographically very compact, characteristic of <a href="/wiki/Eastern_seaboard" id="w">eastern seaboard</a> cities which developed prior to use of the automobile. For this reason, Providence has the <a href="/wiki/List_of_U.S._cities_with_most_pedestrian_commuters" id="w">eighth-highest percentage</a> of pedestrian commuters.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The street layout is somewhat chaotic &#8212; over one thousand streets (a great number for the city&#39;s size) run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places like Market Square.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Downtown Providence has numerous 19th century mercantile buildings in the <a href="/wiki/Federal_style_architecture" id="w">Federal</a> and Victorian architectural styles, as well as several post-modern and modernist buildings, are located throughout this area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development. Fountain Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two.  </p>
<p>The newer area includes <a href="/wiki/Providence_Place_Mall" id="w">Providence Place Mall</a> (1999), a <a href="/wiki/The_Westin_Providence" id="w">Westin hotel</a> (1993), <a href="/wiki/GTECH" id="w">GTECH</a> (2006), new condominium construction, and <a href="/wiki/Waterplace_Park" id="w">Waterplace Park</a> (1994); the area tends toward newer development since much of it is land reclaimed in the 1970s from a mass of railroad tracks which was referred to colloquially as the &#34;Chinese Wall&#34;.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> This part of Downtown is characterized by open spaces, wide roads, and intent landscaping.</p>

The <a href="/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Providence" id="w">largest structure</a>, to date, is the art-deco-styled former Industrial Trust Tower, currently the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_America_Tower_(Providence)" id="w">Bank of America Building</a> at 426 <a href="/wiki/Foot_(unit_of_length)" id="w">feet</a> (130 <a href="/wiki/Metre" id="w">m</a>).<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> By contrast, nearby to it is the second tallest <a href="/wiki/Sovereign_Bank_Tower_(Providence)" id="w">One Financial Center</a>, designed in modern taut-skin cladding, constructed a half century later.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> In between the two is <a href="/wiki/50_Kennedy_Plaza" id="w">50 Kennedy Plaza</a>.

<p>The city&#39;s southern waterfront, away from the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a decommissioned Russian submarine, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The <a href="/wiki/Fox_Point_Hurricane_Barrier" id="w">Fox Point Hurricane Barrier</a> is also found here, built to protect Providence from <a href="/wiki/Storm_surge" id="w">storm surge</a>, like that it had endured in the <a href="/wiki/New_England_Hurricane_of_1938" id="w">1938 New England Hurricane</a> and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
