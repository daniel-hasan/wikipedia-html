In <a href="/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien" id="w">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Fiction" id="w">fictional</a> universe of <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth" id="w">Middle-earth</a>, the <b>eagles</b> were immense flying <a href="/wiki/Bird" id="w">birds</a> that were <a href="/wiki/Sapience" id="w">sapient</a> and could speak. Often emphatically referred to as the <b>Great Eagles</b>,<sup id="_ref-WH_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WH" title="">[1]</a></sup> they appear in various parts of his <a href="/wiki/Tolkien%26%2339%3Bs_legendarium" id="w">legendarium</a>, from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Silmarillion" id="w">The Silmarillion</a></i> and the accounts of <a href="/wiki/N%C3%BAmenor" id="w">Númenor</a> to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hobbit" id="w">The Hobbit</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" id="w">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>.</p>
<p>These creatures are usually assumed to have been similar to actual <a href="/wiki/Eagle" id="w">eagles</a> (for example, as an independent species of the subfamily <i><a href="/wiki/Buteoninae" id="w">Buteoninae</a></i>), but much larger. In <i>The Silmarillion</i>, <a href="/wiki/#Thorondor" id="w">Thorondor</a> is said to have been the greatest of them and of all birds, with a <a href="/wiki/Wingspan" id="w">wingspan</a> of 30 <a href="/wiki/Fathom" id="w">fathoms</a> (180&#160;ft or 60&#160;m).<sup id="_ref-Silm13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silm13" title="">[2]</a></sup> Elsewhere, the eagles have varied in nature and size both within Tolkien&#39;s writings and in later visualisations and films.</p>
<a id="Appearances" name="Appearances"></a><h2>Appearances</h2>
<p>The difference between &#34;common&#34; and Great Eagles is prominently described in <i>The Hobbit</i>:
</p><blockquote>Eagles are not kindly birds. Some are cowardly and cruel. But the ancient race of the northern mountains were the greatest of all birds; they were proud and strong and noble-hearted.<sup id="_ref-H6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H6" title="">[3]</a></sup></blockquote>

<a id="First_Age" name="First_Age"></a><h3>First Age</h3>
<p>Throughout <i>The Silmarillion</i>, the Eagles are particularly associated with <a href="/wiki/Manw%C3%AB" id="w">Manwë</a>, the ruler of the sky and Lord of the <a href="/wiki/Vala_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Valar</a> (angels or &#34;gods&#34;). In <i><a href="/wiki/Ainulindal%C3%AB" id="w">Ainulindalë</a></i> it is recounted that &#34;spirits in the shape of hawks and eagles&#34; brought news from Middle-earth to his halls upon <a href="/wiki/Taniquetil" id="w">Taniquetil</a>, the highest mountain in the Blessed Realm of <a href="/wiki/Valinor" id="w">Valinor</a>,<sup id="_ref-Ainulindale-Silm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ainulindale-Silm" title="">[4]</a></sup> although later in the book the same is said of birds in general.<sup id="_ref-Silm13_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silm13" title="">[2]</a></sup> (On the different conceptions, see <i><a href="/wiki/#Nature of the Eagles" id="w">Nature</a></i> below.)</p>
<p>Upon their first appearance in the main narrative, it is stated that the Eagles had been &#34;sent forth&#34; to Middle-earth by Manwë. He commanded them to live in the mountains north of the land of <a href="/wiki/Beleriand" id="w">Beleriand</a>, in order to &#34;watch upon&#34; <a href="/wiki/Morgoth" id="w">Morgoth</a>,<sup id="_ref-Silm13_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silm13" title="">[2]</a></sup> the ultimate evil power who had made war upon the <a href="/wiki/Elf_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Elves</a> and <a href="/wiki/Man_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Men</a>, and to help the exiled <a href="/wiki/Noldor" id="w">Noldorin</a> Elves &#34;in extreme cases&#34;.<sup id="_ref-MR138_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MR138" title="">[5]</a></sup> The eagles were ruled by <a href="/wiki/#Thorondor" id="w">Thorondor</a>, who dwelt (apparently with the majority of his folk) in the <a href="/wiki/Echoriath" id="w">Encircling Mountains</a> to the west of <a href="/wiki/Dorthonion" id="w">Dorthonion</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Silm18_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silm18" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>When the Hidden City of <a href="/wiki/Gondolin" id="w">Gondolin</a> was built by <a href="/wiki/Turgon" id="w">Turgon</a> between the Encircling Mountains, the eagles of Thorondor became his allies, bringing him news and keeping spies off the borders. Because of their guardianship, the <a href="/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Orcs</a> of Morgoth did not dare to approach either the nearby mountains, or the important ford of <a href="/wiki/Brithiach" id="w">Brithiach</a> to the south;<sup id="_ref-Tuor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tuor" title="">[8]</a></sup> the eagles&#39; watch had been redoubled after the coming of <a href="/wiki/Tuor" id="w">Tuor</a>,<sup id="_ref-WH_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WH" title="">[1]</a></sup> enabling Gondolin to remain undiscovered the longest of all Elven realms. When the city fell at last, the eagles of Thorondor protected the fugitives, driving away the orcs that ambushed them in the mountain passes.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Eagles fought alongside the army of the Valar, Elves and Men during the <a href="/wiki/War_of_Wrath" id="w">War of Wrath</a> at the end of the <a href="/wiki/First_Age" id="w">First Age</a>, when Morgoth was overthrown. In <i>The Silmarillion</i> it is recounted that after the appearance of winged <a href="/wiki/Dragon_(Middle-earth)" id="w">dragons</a>, &#34;all the great birds of heaven&#34; gathered under the leadership of Thorondor to <a href="/wiki/E%C3%A4rendil" id="w">Eärendil</a>, destroying the majority of the dragons during a battle in the air.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Second_Age" name="Second_Age"></a><h3>Second Age</h3>
<p>Tolkien mentioned the eagles in his accounts of the island of <a href="/wiki/N%C3%BAmenor" id="w">Númenor</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Second_Age" id="w">Second Age</a>. He stated that three eagles guarded the summit of <a href="/wiki/Meneltarma" id="w">Meneltarma</a>, the Holy Mountain, appearing whenever one approached the hallow and staying in the sky during the <a href="/wiki/N%C3%BAmenor#Traditions" id="w">Three Prayers</a>. The Númenóreans called them &#34;the Witnesses of Manwë&#34; and believed that these eagles had been &#34;sent by him from Aman to keep watch upon the Holy Mountain and upon all the land.&#34;<sup id="_ref-DN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DN" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>There was another eyrie upon the tower of the King&#39;s House in the capital <a href="/wiki/Armenelos" id="w">Armenelos</a>, always inhabited by a pair of eagles, until the days of <a href="/wiki/Tar-Ancalimon" id="w">Tar-Ancalimon</a> and the coming of Shadow to Númenor.<sup id="_ref-DN_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DN" title="">[11]</a></sup> In addition, it is stated that many eagles lived upon the hills around <a href="/wiki/Sorontil" id="w">Sorontil</a> in the north of the island,<sup id="_ref-DN_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DN" title="">[11]</a></sup> although in the last case it is unclear whether these were &#34;great&#34; or common eagles.</p>
<p>When the Númenóreans had finally forsaken their former beliefs and began to speak openly against the <a href="/wiki/Ban_of_the_Valar" id="w">Ban of the Valar</a>, it was in the way of eagle-shaped storm clouds, called the &#34;Eagles of the Lord of the West&#34;, that Manwë tried to reason or threaten them.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Third_Age" name="Third_Age"></a><h3>Third Age</h3>
<p>By the end of the <a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">Third Age</a>, a colony of Eagles lived in the northern parts of the <a href="/wiki/Misty_Mountains" id="w">Misty Mountains</a>, as described in <i>The Hobbit</i>. They mostly nested upon the eastward slopes not far from the <a href="/wiki/High_Pass" id="w">High Pass</a> leading from <a href="/wiki/Rivendell" id="w">Rivendell</a>, and thus in the direct vicinity of the Goblin Town beneath the Mountains. It is stated that these Eagles often afflicted the goblins and &#34;stopped whatever wickedness they were doing&#34;; however, their relationship with the local <a href="/wiki/Woodmen_of_Mirkwood" id="w">Woodmen</a> was only cool, as the eagles often hunted their sheep.<sup id="_ref-H6_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H6" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the events of the book, eagles of this colony rescued <a href="/wiki/Thorin_II_Oakenshield" id="w">Thorin</a>&#39;s company from a band of goblins and <a href="/wiki/Warg" id="w">wargs</a>,<sup id="_ref-H6_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H6" title="">[3]</a></sup> ultimately carrying the dwarves to the <a href="/wiki/Carrock" id="w">Carrock</a>.<sup id="_ref-H7_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H7" title="">[13]</a></sup> Later, having espied the mustering of goblins all over the Mountains, a great number of Eagles gathered under <a href="/wiki/#Lord of the Eagles" id="w">their leader</a> and participated in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Five_Armies" id="w">Battle of Five Armies</a> near the <a href="/wiki/Lonely_Mountain" id="w">Lonely Mountain</a>. It was only with their help that the Dwarves, Men and Elves managed to defeat the goblins.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> a prominent (though behind-the-scene) role is played by <a href="/wiki/#Gwaihir" id="w">Gwaihir</a>, and the Eagles appear in great numbers towards the end of the book. In a parallel to <i>The Hobbit</i>, they arrived at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Morannon" id="w">Battle of the Morannon</a>, helping the Host of the West against the <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" id="w">Nazgûl</a>. Several of them rescued <a href="/wiki/Frodo_Baggins" id="w">Frodo Baggins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Samwise_Gamgee" id="w">Samwise Gamgee</a> from <a href="/wiki/Orodruin" id="w">Mount Doom</a> after the <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" id="w">One Ring</a> had been destroyed.<sup id="_ref-RK2-4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RK2-4" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Thorondor" name="Thorondor"></a><h3>Thorondor</h3>
<p>The Lord of Eagles in the First Age, said in <i>The Silmarillion</i> to be the &#34;mightiest of all birds that have ever been&#34;, with a wingspan of thirty fathoms and a golden beak.<sup id="_ref-Silm13_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silm13" title="">[2]</a></sup> His name translates from <a href="/wiki/Sindarin" id="w">Sindarin</a>, an Elven tongue devised by Tolkien, as &#39;King of Eagles&#39;;<sup id="_ref-Etymologies_THORON-, TĀ-_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Etymologies_THORON-, TĀ-" title="">[16]</a></sup> its cognate form in <a href="/wiki/Quenya" id="w">Quenya</a>, another Elven language, is <b>Sorontar</b>.<sup id="_ref-WH_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WH" title="">[1]</a></sup> He led the eagles during most of their appearances in <i>The Silmarillion</i>, and has a significant role of his own.</p>
<p>Thorondor first enters the narrative when he helped the Elven-prince <a href="/wiki/Fingon" id="w">Fingon</a> rescue his kinsman <a href="/wiki/Maedhros" id="w">Maedhros</a> from imprisonment upon <a href="/wiki/Thangorodrim" id="w">Thangorodrim</a>.<sup id="_ref-Silm13_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silm13" title="">[2]</a></sup> After the <a href="/wiki/Dagor_Bragollach" id="w">Dagor Bragollach</a>, he saved <a href="/wiki/Fingolfin" id="w">Fingolfin</a>&#39;s body from defilement by his slayer Morgoth, giving the Dark Lord a scar on his face and carrying the Elven-king&#39;s corpse to the Encircling Mountains north of Gondolin, where it was buried by Turgon.<sup id="_ref-Silm18_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silm18" title="">[7]</a></sup> Shortly afterwards, Thorondor espied <a href="/wiki/H%C3%BArin" id="w">Húrin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Huor" id="w">Huor</a> at the feet of the Mountains, and sent two of his servants to fetch them and bear to Gondolin, fulfilling thus the intentions of Vala <a href="/wiki/Ulmo" id="w">Ulmo</a>.<sup id="_ref-Silm18_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Silm18" title="">[7]</a></sup> Thorondor and two other eagles rescued <a href="/wiki/L%C3%BAthien" id="w">Lúthien</a> and the wounded <a href="/wiki/Beren" id="w">Beren</a> from the doors of <a href="/wiki/Angband_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Angband</a> during their <a href="/wiki/Quest_of_the_Silmaril" id="w">Quest of the Silmaril</a>, taking them to <a href="/wiki/Doriath" id="w">Doriath</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Lord_of_the_Eagles" name="Lord_of_the_Eagles"></a><h3>Lord of the Eagles</h3>
<p>While in <i>The Silmarillion</i> the title &#34;Lord of the Eagles&#34; applies to Thorondor, in <i>The Hobbit</i> it evidently has another significance. No eagles are identified by name in this book, and titles &#34;the Lord of the Eagles&#34; or &#34;the Great Eagle&#34; distinguish their leader from others. It is stated that once he had been healed from an arrow-wound by <a href="/wiki/Gandalf" id="w">Gandalf</a>, and that it was in the memory of this service that his eagles helped the dwarves.<sup id="_ref-H6_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H6" title="">[3]</a></sup> After his participating in the Battle of Five Armies, he was given the title <i>King of All Birds</i> and wore a golden crown.<sup id="_ref-H7_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H7" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many readers assume that it was Gwaihir that led the eagles in this story. However, in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Return_of_the_King" id="w">The Return of the King</a></i> Gandalf says that Gwaihir has carried him twice before the Battle of the Morannon,<sup id="_ref-RK2-4_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RK2-4" title="">[15]</a></sup> while the proper count would be three or four times if Gwaihir and the Lord of the Eagles were the same individual.</p>
<a id="Gwaihir" name="Gwaihir"></a><h3>Gwaihir</h3>
<p>An eagle from the Misty Mountains that helped Gandalf before and during the <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Ring" id="w">War of the Ring</a>; his name means <b>Wind-lord</b> in Sindarin,<sup id="_ref-Etymologies_WAIWA-, KHER-_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Etymologies_WAIWA-, KHER-" title="">[18]</a></sup> and he is said to have been descended from Thorondor.<sup id="_ref-RK2-4_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RK2-4" title="">[15]</a></sup> While Gwaihir was patrolling the land around the southern borders of the Mountains upon <a href="/wiki/Radagast_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Radagast</a>&#39;s orders, he espied Gandalf imprisoned upon the top of <a href="/wiki/Orthanc" id="w">Orthanc</a> and carried him to <a href="/wiki/Edoras" id="w">Edoras</a>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Next time, he found the wizard upon the summit of <a href="/wiki/Celebdil" id="w">Celebdil</a> after his battle with the <a href="/wiki/Durin%26%2339%3Bs_Bane" id="w">Balrog</a>, and took him to <a href="/wiki/Lothl%C3%B3rien" id="w">Lothlórien</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Gwaihir participated in the Battle of the Morannon, and when the Mount Doom erupted, he carried Gandalf to it, in order to save Frodo and Sam.<sup id="_ref-RK2-4_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RK2-4" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eagles named &#34;Gwaihir&#34; and &#34;Landroval&#34; (or, in even earlier texts, &#34;Gwaewar&#34; and &#34;Lhandroval&#34;) also appear in J. R. R. Tolkien&#39;s manuscripts of <i>The Silmarillion</i>, where they are stated to have been the two vassals of Thorondor who helped to bear Beren and Lúthien from Angband.<sup id="_ref-LR301-3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LR301-3" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The passage was removed from the published <i>Silmarillion</i> by <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Tolkien" id="w">Christopher Tolkien</a> to escape the seeming confusion with <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, although later he admitted that he was unable to interpret his father&#39;s intentions and regretted the suppression.<sup id="_ref-LR301-3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LR301-3" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>An eagle who helped to carry Frodo and Sam from Mount Doom, said in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> to have been the brother of Gwaihir and descendant of Thorondor.<sup id="_ref-RK2-4_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RK2-4" title="">[15]</a></sup> His name means &#39;wide-wing&#39; in Sindarin,<sup id="_ref-Etymologies_LAD-, RAM-_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Etymologies_LAD-, RAM-" title="">[23]</a></sup> and it was also used for an eagle of the First Age, either the same as that of the Third or not (see above).</p>
<a id="Meneldor" name="Meneldor"></a><h3>Meneldor</h3>
<p>A younger companion of Gwaihir and Landroval in the rescue of Frodo and Sam.

<a id="Concept_and_creation" name="Concept_and_creation"></a><h2>Concept and creation</h2>
<p>The Great Eagles already appeared in the first tale about Middle-earth that Tolkien wrote in late <a href="/wiki/1910s" id="w">1910s</a>, <i>The Fall of Gondolin</i>, published in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Book_of_Lost_Tales" id="w">The Book of Lost Tales</a></i>. The role of Thorondor was expanded in stages, with the successive introduction of relevant plot elements; and after the conception of Númenor entered in 1936-7, the notion that the eagles were the messengers of Manwë was further elaborated. Shortly after, Tolkien introduced the eagles into <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, repeating in the latter both some plot elements and names.</p>
<p>In several early texts Tolkien wrote that, before moving to Crissaegrim after the death of Fingolfin, the eagles of Thorondor nested upon the peaks of <a href="/wiki/Thangorodrim" id="w">Thangorodrim</a> above Morgoth&#39;s fortress of <a href="/wiki/Angband_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Angband</a>.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Tuor_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tuor" title="">[8]</a></sup> Christopher Tolkien assumed that this idea was later abandoned.<sup id="_ref-Tuor_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tuor" title="">[8]</a></sup> Another rejected proposal was that after Beren&#39;s death Lúthien would not pass of grief, but would be carried to Valinor by Thorondor who would have been &#34;summoned&#34; by <a href="/wiki/Melian" id="w">Melian</a> the Maia.<sup id="_ref-LR301-3_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LR301-3" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>The eagles possessed a notable characteristic that distinguished them from other birds in early writings. Tolkien originally described that <a href="/wiki/E%C3%A4" id="w">Eä</a>, the World, was bounded by the <a href="/wiki/Walls_of_Night" id="w">Walls of Night</a>, and that the space above the surface of the Earth up to the Walls was divided into three regions.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Common birds could keep aloft only within the lower layer,<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> while the Eagles of Manwë could fly &#34;beyond the lights of heaven to the edge of darkness.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Ainulindale-LR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ainulindale-LR" title="">[29]</a></sup> The conception of limited world and of the layers of the firmament was rejected during the writing of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>The eagle-shaped clouds that appeared in Númenor were one of Tolkien&#39;s recurring associations with the downfall of the island, just like the images of a sloping mountain and an overwhelming wave;<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> they were also introduced by him into two abandoned time-travel stories, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lost_Road" id="w">The Lost Road</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Notion_Club_Papers" id="w">The Notion Club Papers</a></i>. In a sketch for the former, Tolkien projected that it would be &#34;Sorontur&#34; (Thorondor) himself that appeared in Númenor to the protagonist of the story.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Tolkien&#39;s painting of an eagle on a crag appears in some editions of <i>The Hobbit</i>. According to Christopher Tolkien, the author based this picture on a painting by <a href="/wiki/Archibald_Thorburn" id="w">Archibald Thorburn</a> of an immature <a href="/wiki/Golden_Eagle" id="w">Golden Eagle</a>, which Christopher found for him in <i>The Birds of the British Isles</i> by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Coward" id="w">Thomas Coward</a>.{{ME-fact}} However, Tolkien&#39;s use of this model does not necessarily mean that his birds were ordinary Golden Eagles.</p>
<a id="Nature_of_the_Eagles" name="Nature_of_the_Eagles"></a><h3>Nature of the Eagles</h3>
<p>The question of the Great Eagles&#39; nature was faced by Tolkien with apparent hesitation. In early writings there was no need to define it precisely, since he imagined that, beside the Valar, &#34;many lesser spirits... both great and small&#34; had entered the <a href="/wiki/E%C3%A4" id="w">Eä</a> upon its creation;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> and such talking and sapient creatures as the Eagles or <a href="/wiki/Huan" id="w">Huan</a> the Hound, in Tolkien&#39;s own words, &#34;have been rather lightly adopted from less &#39;serious&#39; mythologies.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MR409-11_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MR409-11" title="">[34]</a></sup> The phrase &#34;spirits in the shape of hawks and eagles&#34; in <i>Ainulindalë</i> derives from that stage of writing.<sup id="_ref-Ainulindale-LR_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ainulindale-LR" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the completion of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Tolkien introduced a strict &#34;system&#34; of living creatures:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Incarnates or the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Children_of_Il%C3%BAvatar" id="w">Children of Ilúvatar</a>&#34;: Elves, Men, <a href="/wiki/Dwarf_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Dwarves</a> and Orcs, — those who possessed <i><a href="/wiki/F%C3%ABa_and_hr%C3%B6a" id="w">fëar</a></i> or souls, with the defining characteristic of being able to speak;<sup id="_ref-QE_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-QE" title="">[35]</a></sup></li>

<p>For some time Tolkien considered the Eagles as bird-shaped Maiar;<sup id="_ref-MR138_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MR138" title="">[5]</a></sup> however, later he realised that the statement about Gwaihir and Landroval being the descendants of Thorondor had already appeared in print in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>,<sup id="_ref-MR409-11_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MR409-11" title="">[34]</a></sup> while the notion of the &#34;Children of the Valar&#34; had been rejected by him long before.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> In what his son presented as the last of J.&#160;R.&#160;R.&#160;Tolkien&#39;s notes on this topic, he decided that the Great Eagles were common animals that &#34;were taught language by the Valar, and raised to a higher level — but they still had no <i>fëar</i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MR409-11_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MR409-11" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

In <a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy" id="w">&#39;&#39;The Lord of the Rings&#39;&#39; film trilogy</a> directed by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Jackson" id="w">Peter Jackson</a>, these creatures are 6&#160;m (20&#160;ft) tall with a maximum wingspan of 23&#160;m (75&#160;ft).{{ME-fact}} A notable derivation from the book is that Gandalf summons Gwaihir to Orthanc with the aid of a by-passing <a href="/wiki/Moth" id="w">moth</a> (the role of Radagast was not included into the film). The same moth also appears to him before the Eagles arrive at the Battle of the Morannon.</p>
<p>Tolkien&#39;s Great Eagles are likely to have been the inspiration for similar creatures appearing in various fantasy genres, such as the <a href="/wiki/Giant_eagle_(Dungeons_%26amp%3B_Dragons)" id="w">Giant eagles</a> in the role-playing game <a href="/wiki/Dungeons_%26amp%3B_Dragons" id="w">Dungeons &#38; Dragons</a>.</p>
