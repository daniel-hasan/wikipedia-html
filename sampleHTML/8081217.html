<p><b>Rudolf Duala Manga Bell</b> (1873–<a href="/wiki/8_August" id="w">8 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Duala_people" id="w">Duala</a> <a href="/wiki/Rulers_of_the_Duala" id="w">king</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rebellion" id="w">resistance leader</a> in the <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" id="w">German</a> <a href="/wiki/Colonialism" id="w">colony</a> of <a href="/wiki/Kamerun" id="w">Kamerun</a>. After being educated in both Kamerun and Europe, he succeeded his father, <a href="/wiki/Manga_Ndumbe_Bell" id="w">Manga Ndumbe Bell</a>, on <a href="/wiki/2_September" id="w">2 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1908" id="w">1908</a>. Manga Bell styled himself after European rulers, and he generally supported the colonial German authorities. He was quite wealthy and educated, although his father left him a substantial debt.</p>
<p>In 1910, the German <a href="/wiki/Reichstag_(institution)" id="w">Reichstag</a> developed a plan by which the riverain Duala would be moved inland to allow for wholly European riverside settlements. Manga Bell became the leader of pan-Duala resistance to the policy. He and the other chiefs at first pressured the administration through letters, petitions, and legal arguments, but these were ignored or rebutted. Manga Bell turned to other European governments for aid, and he sent representatives to the leaders of other Cameroonian peoples to suggest the overthrow of the German regime. Sultan <a href="/wiki/Ibrahim_Njoya" id="w">Ibrahim Njoya</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Bamum_people" id="w">Bamum people</a> reported his actions to the authorities, and the Duala leader was arrested. After a summary trial, Manga Bell was <a href="/wiki/Hanging" id="w">hanged</a> for <a href="/wiki/High_treason" id="w">high treason</a> on <a href="/wiki/8_August" id="w">8 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a>. His actions made him a <a href="/wiki/Martyr" id="w">martyr</a> in Cameroonian eyes. Writers such as Mark W. DeLancey, Mark Dike DeLancey, and Helmuth Stoecker view his actions as an early example of Cameroonian <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" id="w">nationalism</a>.</p>
<a id="Early_life_and_reign" name="Early_life_and_reign"></a><h2>Early life and reign</h2>
<p>Rudolf Duala Manga Bell was born in 1873 in <a href="/wiki/Douala" id="w">Douala</a> in the German colony of <a href="/wiki/Kamerun" id="w">Kamerun</a>. He was the eldest son of <a href="/wiki/Manga_Ndumbe_Bell" id="w">Manga Ndumbe Bell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rulers_of_the_Duala" id="w">king</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Bell_lineage" id="w">Bell lineage</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Duala_people" id="w">Duala people</a>. Manga Bell was raised to appreciate both African and European ways of life. His Westernised uncle, <a href="/wiki/David_Mandessi_Bell" id="w">David Mandessi Bell</a>, had a great impact on him,<sup id="_ref-A&D 126_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 126" title="">[1]</a></sup> and the young Manga Bell attended school in both Douala and <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a>.<sup id="_ref-DeLancey 168_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DeLancey 168" title="">[2]</a></sup> During the 1890s, he attended the <a href="/wiki/Gymnasium_of_Ulm" id="w">Gymnasium of Ulm</a>, Germany, although no direct record of his time there survives. Manga Bell was made <i>Ein-Jähriger</i>, indicating that he held a certificate for education beyond the primary level but below the <i><a href="/wiki/Abitur" id="w">Abitur</a></i> earned for completion of secondary studies.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> When the prince returned to Kamerun, he was one of the most highly educated men in the colony.<sup id="_ref-A&D 132_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 132" title="">[4]</a></sup> He made other periodic visits to Europe, such as when he travelled to <a href="/wiki/Berlin" id="w">Berlin</a>, Germany, and <a href="/wiki/Manchester" id="w">Manchester</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, with his father in 1902. In Manchester, he met the mayor at town hall and was mentioned in the October edition of the <i><a href="/wiki/African_Times" id="w">African Times</a></i> (where the editor doubted that he and his father were actual royalty).<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Manga Bell married Emily Engome Dayas, the daughter of an <a href="/wiki/English_people" id="w">English</a> trader and a Duala woman.<sup id="_ref-A&D 126_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 126" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>When his father died on <a href="/wiki/2_September" id="w">2 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1908" id="w">1908</a>, Manga Bell became the king of the Duala Bell lineage. He was traditionally installed on <a href="/wiki/2_May" id="w">2 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1910" id="w">1910</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Paramount_chief" id="w">paramount chief</a> of <a href="/wiki/Bonaberi" id="w">Bonaberi</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Manga Bell inherited an 8,000 mark pension,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Cocoa" id="w">cocoa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Timber" id="w">timber</a> interests in the <a href="/wiki/Mungo_River" id="w">Mungo River</a> valley, property and <a href="/wiki/Real_estate" id="w">real estate</a> in Douala,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> and a lucrative position as head of an appeals court with jurisdiction over the Cameroon littoral.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> His father and grandfather, <a href="/wiki/Ndumbe_Lobe_Bell" id="w">Ndumbe Lobe Bell</a>, left him in a strong political position with Bell dominant over the other Duala lineages.<sup id="_ref-A&D 132_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 132" title="">[4]</a></sup> However, his father also left him a substantial debt of 7,000 <a href="/wiki/German_gold_mark" id="w">marks</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Rudolf Duala Manga Bell was forced to rent buildings to European interests and move his own offices inland to the Douala neighbourhood of <a href="/wiki/Bali%2C_Douala" id="w">Bali</a>.<sup id="_ref-A&D 133_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 133" title="">[11]</a></sup> He owned 200 hectares of cocoa plantations in 1913, a large amount by Duala standards;<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> his debt had been reduced to 3,000 marks by <a href="/wiki/13_July" id="w">13 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1912" id="w">1912</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Manga Bell&#39;s reign was European in character.<sup id="_ref-A&D 126_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 126" title="">[1]</a></sup> His relations with the Germans were largely positive, and he was viewed as a good citizen and collaborator.<sup id="_ref-A&D 133_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 133" title="">[11]</a></sup> Nevertheless, at times he ran afoul of the colonial administrators. In 1910, for example, the German authorities arrested him and accused him (with no proof) of collusion with a large <a href="/wiki/Bank_robbery" id="w">bank robbery</a>.<sup id="_ref-A&D 132_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 132" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Duala_land_problem" name="Duala_land_problem"></a><h2>Duala land problem</h2>
<p>Manga Bell&#39;s real problems with the regime began later in 1910. The Germans outlined a plan to relocate the Duala people inland from the <a href="/wiki/Wouri_River" id="w">Wouri River</a> to allow European-only settlement of the area. The expropriations affected all of the Duala lineages except <a href="/wiki/Bonaberi_lineage" id="w">Bonaberi</a>,<sup id="_ref-A&D 133_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 133" title="">[11]</a></sup> so Duala public opinion was strongly against it, and for the first time in their history, the Duala clans presented a united front.<sup id="_ref-A&D 132_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 132" title="">[4]</a></sup> Manga Bell&#39;s position as leader of the dominant Bell clan, coupled with his character, education, and finances, made him a natural leader for this opposition. Manga Bell and other Duala rulers sent a letter to the <a href="/wiki/Reichstag" id="w">Reichstag</a> in November 1911 to protest the land seizures. The Germans were surprised at Manga Bell&#39;s involvement,<sup id="_ref-A&D 133_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 133" title="">[11]</a></sup> but they ignored the complaint. The chiefs sent another letter in March 1912. Still, the Germans moved forward with their plan on <a href="/wiki/15_January" id="w">15 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1913" id="w">1913</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The chiefs warned in writing on <a href="/wiki/20_February" id="w">20 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1913" id="w">1913</a> that this violation &#34;may well prompt the natives to consider whether it might be wiser under the circumstances to revoke the [<a href="/wiki/German-Duala_Treaty" id="w">German-Duala Treaty</a> of 1884] and enter into a treaty with another power.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Stoecker 172_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stoecker 172" title="">[15]</a></sup> Manga Bell argued that the expropriation plan ignored the treaty&#39;s promise &#34;that the land cultivated by us now and the places the towns are built on shall be the property of the present owners and their successors&#34;<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> and contradicted statements by Governor <a href="/wiki/Theodor_Seitz" id="w">Theodor Seitz</a> that he would leave Bell lands alone as he constructed a railroad in the colony.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The Germans countered that the German-Duala treaty gave them the authority to manage Duala lands as they saw fit. That August, they removed Manga Bell from office and from the <a href="/wiki/Civil_service" id="w">civil service</a> and stripped him of his annual pension of 3,000 marks.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> In his place, they propped up his brother, <a href="/wiki/Henri_Lobe_Bell" id="w">Henri Lobe Bell</a>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Reichstag debated the expropriation for the first half of 1914. Manga Bell enlisted the aid of  <a href="/wiki/Hellmut_von_Gerlach" id="w">Hellmut von Gerlach</a>, a German journalist. Gerlach managed to secure a suspension order from the Reichstag Budget Commission in March, but the order was overturned when Colonial Secretary <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_Solf" id="w">Wilhelm Solf</a> convinced elements of the press, businessmen in the colony, politicians, and other groups to finally rally behind the expropriation.<sup id="_ref-Stoecker 172_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stoecker 172" title="">[15]</a></sup> Manga Bell and the Duala requested permission to send envoys to Germany to plead their case, but the authorities denied them.<sup id="_ref-Ngoh 107_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ngoh 107" title="">[20]</a></sup> In secret, Manga Bell sent <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Ngoso_Din" id="w">Adolf Ngoso Din</a> to Germany to hire a lawyer for the Duala and pursue the matter in court.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>The desperate Manga Bell turned to other European governments and to the leaders of other African ethnic groups for support.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The contents of his correspondence with European powers are unknown; he may have simply sought to spread word of his cause.<sup id="_ref-A&D 136_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 136" title="">[23]</a></sup> His envoys to African leaders reached <a href="/wiki/Bali%2C_Cameroon" id="w">Bali</a>, <a href="/wiki/Balong" id="w">Balong</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dschang" id="w">Dschang</a>, <a href="/wiki/Foumban" id="w">Foumban</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ngaound%C3%A9r%C3%A9" id="w">Ngaoundéré</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yabassi" id="w">Yabassi</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Yaound%C3%A9" id="w">Yaoundé</a>.<sup id="_ref-Ngoh 107_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ngoh 107" title="">[20]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Charles_Atangana" id="w">Karl Atangana</a>, leader of the <a href="/wiki/Beti-Pahuin" id="w">Ewondo and Bane peoples</a>, kept Manga Bell&#39;s plan secret but urged the Duala leader to reconsider.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Beti-Pahuin" id="w">Bulu</a> lands on the other hand, <a href="/wiki/Martin-Paul_Samba" id="w">Martin-Paul Samba</a> agreed to contact the <a href="/wiki/French_Third_Republic" id="w">French</a> for military support if Manga Bell petitioned the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland" id="w">British</a>.<sup id="_ref-A&D&N_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D&N" title="">[25]</a></sup> However, there is no evidence that Manga Bell ever did so.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> In Foumban, <a href="/wiki/Ibrahim_Njoya" id="w">Ibrahim Njoya</a>, sultan of the <a href="/wiki/Bamum_people" id="w">Bamum people</a>, rejected the plan and informed the <a href="/wiki/Basel_Mission" id="w">Basel Mission</a> on <a href="/wiki/27_April" id="w">27 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a> that Manga Bell was planning a pan-Kamerun rebellion. The missionaries alerted the Germans.<sup id="_ref-A&D&N_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D&N" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Historians are split on the nature of Manga Bell&#39;s actions. Mark W. DeLancey and Mark Dike DeLancey name him &#34;an early nationalist&#34;, and Helmuth Stoecker says that his actions &#34;had begun to organize a resistance movement embracing the whole of Cameroon and cutting across tribal differences&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Stoecker 172_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stoecker 172" title="">[15]</a></sup> However, Ralph A.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/6_May" id="w">6 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a>, Bezirksamtmann <a href="/wiki/Herrmann_R%C3%B6hm" id="w">Herrmann Röhm</a> wrote to the <a href="/wiki/Kuti_Agricultural_Station" id="w">Kuti Agricultural Station</a> (where Manga Bell&#39;s envoy was being held),</p>
<p /><blockquote>We are not confronted with any direct danger of some kind of violent action by the Duala.

On <a href="/wiki/1_June" id="w">1 June</a>, Röhm wrote to the administration in <a href="/wiki/Buea" id="w">Buea</a> that based on his calculations of Manga Bell&#39;s annual income from cocoa and timber exports, and accounting for his debts to European interests, the Duala merchants would likely not see it in their interests to oppose the expropriation further.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> At the urging of Solf, the Germans arrested Manga Bell and Ngoso Din and charged them with <a href="/wiki/High_treason" id="w">high treason</a>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Their trial was held on <a href="/wiki/7_August" id="w">7 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a>.<sup id="_ref-Ngoh 115_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ngoh 115" title="">[31]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> had just begun, and an attack by the Allied <a href="/wiki/West_Africa_Campaign_(World_War_I)" id="w">West Africa Campaign</a> in Kamerun was imminent; accordingly, the trial was rushed. No direct record of the proceedings survives. The dossier of evidence used against Manga Bell claimed that he had been raising funds from inland and that his outspoken opposition was causing unrest among the inland peoples.<sup id="_ref-A&D 136_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 136" title="">[23]</a></sup> The regime claimed that Manga Bell had admitted to contacting foreign countries for aid against Germany,<sup id="_ref-Ngoh 115_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ngoh 115" title="">[31]</a></sup> but a 1927 recollection by the official defense attorney—riddled as it is with inaccuracies and racist statements—claims that Manga Bell maintained his innocence throughout.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Requests for the accused men&#39;s lives to be spared came from <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Vieter" id="w">Heinrich Vieter</a> of the Catholic <a href="/wiki/Pallottine_Mission_to_Cameroon" id="w">Pallottine Mission</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Basel_Mission" id="w">Basel Mission</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Baptist_Mission_to_Cameroon" id="w">Baptist Mission</a>, but Governor <a href="/wiki/Karl_Ebermeier" id="w">Karl Ebermeier</a> rejected their pleas.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/8_August" id="w">8 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a>,<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Rudolf Duala Manga Bell and Adolf Ngoso Din were <a href="/wiki/Hanging" id="w">hanged</a>.

<p>Manga Bell&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment" id="w">execution</a> made him a <a href="/wiki/Martyr" id="w">martyr</a> to the people of Cameroon and painted the Duala as an heroic people.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> His story became <a href="/wiki/Legend" id="w">legend</a><sup id="_ref-A&D 132_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-A&D 132" title="">[4]</a></sup> and came to represent &#34;the myth of extreme colonial oppression, based upon the catastrophic climax of German rule in Douala&#34;.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> Manga Bell was still popular well into the 1920s. &#34;Tet&#39;Ekombo&#34;, a hymn to him composed in 1929, has remained popular.
