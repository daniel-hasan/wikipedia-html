<p><b>Union Station</b> in <a href="/wiki/San_Diego%2C_California" id="w">San Diego, California</a>, was built by the <a href="/wiki/Atchison%2C_Topeka_and_Santa_Fe_Railway" id="w">Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway</a> to replace the existing <a href="/wiki/Victorian_architecture" id="w">Victorian</a>-style structure erected in 1887 for the <a href="/wiki/California_Southern_Railroad" id="w">California Southern Railroad</a> Company. The <b>Santa Fe Depot</b> (as it was originally designated) officially opened on <a href="/wiki/March_8" id="w">March 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1915" id="w">1915</a>, to accommodate visitors to the <a href="/wiki/Panama-California_Exposition_(1915)" id="w">Panama-California Exposition</a>. The depot was completed during a particularly optimistic period in the City&#39;s development, and represents the battle waged by the City of San Diego to become the <a href="/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States" id="w">West Coast</a> terminus of the Santa Fe Railway system’s <a href="/wiki/Transcontinental_railroad" id="w">transcontinental railroad</a>, a fight that was ultimately lost to the City of <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles%2C_California" id="w">Los Angeles</a>. </p>
<p>In its heyday, the facility not only handled Santa Fe traffic but also that of the <a href="/wiki/San_Diego_and_Arizona_Railway" id="w">San Diego and Arizona Railway</a> (SD&#38;A) and <a href="/wiki/San_Diego_Electric_Railway" id="w">San Diego Electric Railway</a> (SDERy). The designation was officially changed to <b>San Diego Union Station</b> in response to the SD&#38;A&#39;s completion of its own transcontinental line in December 1919. The Santa Fe resumed solo operation of the station in January, 1951 when the <a href="/wiki/San_Diego_and_Arizona_Eastern_Railway" id="w">San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway</a> (successor to the SD&#38;A) discontinued passenger service, the SDERy having ceased operation some two years prior.</p>
<p>The historic Santa Fe Depot is located in Centre City (downtown) San Diego and is still an active transportation center, providing services to Amtrak, the San Diego Coaster, the San Diego Trolley, and the MTS bus system. </p>
<a id="Architecture" name="Architecture"></a><h1>Architecture</h1>
<p>The magnificent complex was designed by <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco%2C_California" id="w">San Francisco</a> architects Bakewell &#38; Brown as a &#34;monumental reminder&#34; of <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California&#39;s</a> <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spanish</a> heritage. The <a href="/wiki/Mission_Revival_Style_architecture" id="w">Mission Revival</a> styling reflects the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas" id="w">colonial Spanish</a> history of the state, and was intended to harmonize with the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Colonial_Revival_Style_architecture" id="w">Spanish Colonial Revival Style</a> buildings of the Exposition.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The size and grandeur far surpassed anything the Santa Fe had ever built in the West.

A 27-foot by 650-foot-long <a href="/wiki/Arcade_(architecture)" id="w">arcade</a> connected the passenger terminal with the <a href="/wiki/Baggage" id="w">baggage</a> and express rooms.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> An enlarged bus depot was installed in the southeast portico in 1942.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The massive arch of the front entrance is flanked by twin <i><a href="/wiki/Campanile" id="w">campaniles</a></i>, each topped by a colorful tile-covered dome and displaying Santa Fe&#39;s blue &#34;cross&#34; emblem on all four sides.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_20" id="w">June 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/1879" id="w">1879</a>, the Santa Fe Railway received a land grant from the <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexican</a> government that allowed them to extend their reach through the valley of <a href="/wiki/Sonora" id="w">Sonora</a> through to the coastal town of <a href="/wiki/Guaymas" id="w">Guaymas</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_California" id="w">Gulf of California</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Sonora_Railway" id="w">Sonora Railway</a> (an <a href="/wiki/Operating_subsidiary" id="w">operating subsidiary</a>) allowed the Santa Fe to effectively compete with the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Pacific_Railroad" id="w">Southern Pacific Railroad</a> for business on the <a href="/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States" id="w">West Coast of the United States</a>. Traffic on the line, however, was light, and Santa Fe pushed further westward in search of a suitable Pacific terminus. Since 1845, the citizens of San Diego (then essentially a sleepy fishing village) had attempted to establish a direct rail link to the east without success.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Texas_and_Pacific_Railway" id="w">Texas and Pacific Railway</a> Company (known as the T&#38;P) was created by federal charter in 1871 with the purpose of building a southern <a href="/wiki/Transcontinental_railroad" id="w">transcontinental railroad</a> between <a href="/wiki/Marshall%2C_Texas" id="w">Marshall, Texas</a>, and San Diego. The T&#38;P had a significant foothold in Texas by the mid 1880s but construction difficulties delayed westward progress until American financier <a href="/wiki/Jay_Gould" id="w">Jay Gould</a> acquired an interest in the railroad in 1879. The T&#38;P never reached San Diego but instead met the Southern Pacific at <a href="/wiki/Sierra_Blanca%2C_Texas" id="w">Sierra Blanca, Texas</a>, in 1881.</p>

</p>
<p>In the wake of this setback, the Santa Fe was approached by the <b>Citizens Railroad Committee of San Diego</b>, who had formed a syndicate for the purpose of building a rail line to connect with the A&#38;P in eastern <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>. Santa Fe provided financial assistance to the group, which also founded the California Southern Railroad Company (CSRR) on <a href="/wiki/October_23" id="w">October 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1880" id="w">1880</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> A <a href="/wiki/Roundhouse" id="w">roundhouse</a>, workshops, and <a href="/wiki/Classification_yard" id="w">classification yards</a> were built in <a href="/wiki/National_City%2C_California" id="w">National City</a>, a suburb of San Diego. A <a href="/wiki/Wharf" id="w">wharf</a> was also constructed to accommodate ship traffic. Initial plans were made to construct 18 miles (29 km) of main line track extending north from the new complex. As of <a href="/wiki/January_12" id="w">January 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1882" id="w">1882</a>, the California Southern commenced regular passenger and freight service between its National City terminus and Fallbrook Junction, just north of <a href="/wiki/Oceanside%2C_California" id="w">Oceanside</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Tracklaying continued and proceeded steadily northward until <a href="/wiki/August_14" id="w">August 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1882" id="w">1882</a>, when a connection was made with the Southern Pacific&#39;s line in <a href="/wiki/Colton%2C_California" id="w">Colton</a>. The California Southern&#39;s attempts to cross over the SP tracks a year later led to a <a href="/wiki/Frog_war" id="w">frog war</a> that ended on <a href="/wiki/August_11" id="w">August 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1883" id="w">1883</a>, with a court order in the CSRR&#39;s favor.

</p>
<p>A real estate boom in the spring of 1887 brought thousands of people to Southern California, many of them traveling on &#34;The Santa Fé Route&#34; to San Diego. The California Southern constructed a new <a href="/wiki/Victorian_architecture" id="w">Victorian</a>-style depot to handle the throngs of people coming to the Southland.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The structure sported dark red paint with dark green trim.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Recurring washouts in the <a href="/wiki/Temecula%2C_California" id="w">Temecula Canyon</a>, however, often disrupted service; in response, the Santa Fe began construction of its 126-mile-long &#34;<a href="/wiki/Surf_Line" id="w">Surf Line</a>&#34; between Los Angeles&#39; <a href="/wiki/La_Grande_Station" id="w">La Grande Station</a> and the National City depot. From 1886 to 1888, the <a href="/wiki/Riverside%2C_Santa_Ana_and_Los_Angeles_Railway" id="w">Riverside, Santa Ana and Los Angeles Railway</a> built a branch line from <a href="/wiki/Highgrove%2C_California" id="w">Highgrove</a> southwest via <a href="/wiki/Riverside%2C_California" id="w">Riverside</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Santa_Ana%2C_California" id="w">Santa Ana</a> and from <a href="/wiki/Orange%2C_California" id="w">Orange</a> northwest to Los Angeles. Also in 1888, the <a href="/wiki/San_Bernardino_and_San_Diego_Railway" id="w">San Bernardino and San Diego Railway</a> completed its line from <a href="/wiki/Oceanside%2C_California" id="w">Oceanside</a> north to Santa Ana, completing what was originally called the &#34;Los Angeles-San Diego Short Line.&#34; The inland route was finally abandoned in 1891, leaving the newer, coastal route as the only line to San Diego from the north.</p>
<p>It was generally felt that with the completion of the <a href="/wiki/Panama_Canal" id="w">Panama Canal</a> in 1914, San Diego would logically become the principal <a href="/wiki/Ship_transport" id="w">port of call</a> for the Atlantic-Pacific sea trade. To that end, the City decided to stage an international exposition in celebration of the opening of the Canal, and to tout San Diego as the first <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">U.S.</a> port for ships traveling north after passing through the facility. But San Diego, even with its natural landlocked harbor, was 100 miles farther south than Los Angeles, which translated into an additional day of travel for both freight and passenger trains; in order for Santa Fe to compete with the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Pacific_Railroad" id="w">Southern Pacific Railroad</a>, the company needed a port closer to its rival&#39;s transcontinental terminus. Santa Fe transferred most of its engine terminal yard to <a href="/wiki/San_Bernardino%2C_California" id="w">San Bernardino</a> in 1887, then established an interim port facility in <a href="/wiki/Redondo_Beach%2C_California" id="w">Redondo Beach</a> the following year. But when the railroad relocated its port operations to <a href="/wiki/San_Pedro%2C_California" id="w">San Pedro&#39;s</a> newly-dredged, manmade harbor in 1911, it effectively ended San Diego&#39;s hopes to become the <a href="/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States" id="w">West Coast&#39;s</a> southernmost commercial port.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Santa_Fe_Depot" name="Santa_Fe_Depot"></a><h2>Santa Fe Depot</h2>
<p>Though the elegant California Southern depot had served San Diego for nearly three decades, the station was not adequate to handle the expected flood of visitors through the &#34;Silver Gate&#34; in 1915. In fact, the Santa Fe had considered replacing the aging &#34;D&#34; Street station with a larger, more modern edifice.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Plans were drawn up for a new station complex in the Mission Revival Style, befitting the upcoming Exposition. The large, graceful <a href="/wiki/Palm_tree" id="w">palm trees</a> that graced the old depot were boxed and stored for re-planting alongside the new building. Construction began on a site just east of the existing structure on <a href="/wiki/January_15" id="w">January 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a>, and was completed on <a href="/wiki/December_31" id="w">December 31</a>, at a total cost of <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">$300</a>,000. A <a href="/wiki/Fred_Harvey_Company" id="w">Fred Harvey Company</a> lunch counter and dining room were incorporated into the floor plan. The old wooden structure was razed during the few days before the opening; the <a href="/wiki/Clock_tower" id="w">clock tower</a> was ceremonially toppled on <a href="/wiki/March_7" id="w">March 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1915" id="w">1915</a>.</p>
<p>The facility opened for business on <a href="/wiki/March_8" id="w">March 8</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Oliver J. Stough, the last surviving veteran of the <a href="/wiki/Mexican-American_War" id="w">Mexican-American War</a>, was given the honor of purchasing the first ticket.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> At the outset, the Santa Fe had three daily local trains and one express train running between Los Angeles and San Diego. During the exposition nine scheduled trains ran on during the week (eight only made stops at <a href="/wiki/Fullerton%2C_California" id="w">Fullerton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Santa_Ana%2C_California" id="w">Santa Ana</a>, while the ninth was a local that stopped at all of the &#34;Surf Line&#34; stations). Twelve trains operated on weekends, many running in multiple sections. Four helper locomotives were assigned to the Sorrento Grade to help trains over the hill for the duration of the Exposition.</p>
