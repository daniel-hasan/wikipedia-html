<b>Prairie Avenue</b> is a north–south thoroughfare on the <a href="/wiki/South_side_(Chicago)" id="w">South Side</a> of <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a>, which historically extended from 16th street in the <a href="/wiki/Near_South_Side%2C_Chicago" id="w">Near South Side</a> <a href="/wiki/Community_areas_of_Chicago" id="w">community area</a> of <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_Illinois" id="w">Chicago</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cook_County%2C_Illinois" id="w">Cook County</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">USA</a> to the city&#39;s southern limits and beyond. The street has a rich history from its origins as a major <a href="/wiki/Trail" id="w">trail</a> for <a href="/wiki/Horseback_rider" id="w">horseback riders</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carriage" id="w">carriages</a>. During the last three decades of the 19th century, a six-<a href="/wiki/City_block" id="w">block</a> section of the street served as the residence of many of Chicago’s elite families and an additional four-block section was also known for grand homes. The upper six-block section includes the historic <a href="/wiki/Prairie_Avenue_District" id="w">Prairie Avenue District</a>.</p>
<p>Several of Chicago&#39;s most important <a href="/wiki/History_of_Chicago" id="w">historical figures</a> have lived on the street. This is especially true of the period of recovery from the <a href="/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire" id="w">Great Chicago Fire</a> of 1871 when many of the most important families in the city moved to the street. Residents of the street have influenced the evolution of the city and have played prominent national and international roles. They have influenced the <a href="/wiki/Political_history_of_Chicago" id="w">political history</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_architecture" id="w">architecture</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_Chicago" id="w">culture</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_Chicago" id="w">economy</a>, as well as the <a href="/wiki/Law_and_government_of_Chicago" id="w">law and government</a> of Chicago. The street has over time been influenced by the <a href="/wiki/Demographics_of_Chicago" id="w">demographics</a> of Chicago. </p>
<p>The importance of the street has declined, but it still has landmark buildings and is the backbone of an historic district. Additionally, the street is being redeveloped to host valuable and important condominiums. Recently, developments have extended the street north to accommodate new <a href="/wiki/High-rise" id="w">high-rise</a> <a href="/wiki/Condominiums" id="w">condominiums</a> along <a href="/wiki/Roosevelt_Road_(Chicago)" id="w">Roosevelt Road</a> (12th street).  The redevelopment has extended the street so that it has prominent buildings bordering <a href="/wiki/Grant_Park_(Chicago)" id="w">Grant Park</a> with Prairie Avenue addresses.</p>

Prairie Avenue once served as an <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Indian</a> trail linking <a href="/wiki/Fort_Dearborn" id="w">Fort Dearborn</a> to <a href="/wiki/Forts_of_Fort_Wayne%2C_Indiana" id="w">Fort Wayne</a> in <a href="/wiki/Indiana" id="w">Indiana</a> and thus derived its name from the vast <a href="/wiki/Midwest" id="w">midwestern</a> <a href="/wiki/Prairie" id="w">prairie</a> land between the two endpoints.<sup id="_ref-SCRS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SCRS" title="">[1]</a></sup>  In 1812, the <a href="/wiki/Fort_Dearborn_massacre" id="w">Fort Dearborn massacre</a> occurred in the area that is now the northern section of the street, in what is known as the <a href="/wiki/Near_South_Side%2C_Chicago" id="w">Near South Side</a> <a href="/wiki/Community_areas_of_Chicago" id="w">community area</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Over time, the district has evolved from an upscale neighborhood to a factory district and back to an upscale neighborhood. Zoning in 1853 anticipated residential development, although only one grand villa existed at the time. By 1877, the eleven-block area of Prairie Avenue, as well as Calumet Avenue, housed elite residences. By 1886, the finest mansions in the city, each equipped with its own carriage house, stood on Prairie Avenue.<sup id="_ref-NC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NC" title="">[3]</a></sup>  In the 1880s and 1890s, mansions for <a href="/wiki/George_Pullman" id="w">George Pullman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Field" id="w">Marshall Field</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_J._Glessner" id="w">John J.

In the 1850s, railroad related industries prospered near the lumber district along the South Branch of the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_River" id="w">Chicago River</a>. Thus, the business district began to supplant the elegant residences along <a href="/wiki/Michigan_Avenue_(Chicago)" id="w">Michigan</a> and Wabash Avenues south of Jackson Boulevard.<sup id="_ref-EOC562_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EOC562" title="">[6]</a></sup> Shortly after the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">Civil War</a>, the city&#39;s wealthy residents settled on Prairie Avenue due to its proximity to the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Loop" id="w">Loop</a> less than a mile away and the fact that traveling there did not involve crossing the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_River" id="w">Chicago River</a>. In 1870, <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Thompson" id="w">Daniel Thompson</a> erected the first large upper-Prairie Avenue home.  <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Field" id="w">Marshall Field</a> followed in 1871 with a <a href="/wiki/Richard_Morris_Hunt" id="w">Richard Morris Hunt</a> design.<sup id="_ref-EOC644_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EOC644" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Prairie Avenue was the most posh Chicago address by the time of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire" id="w">Great Chicago Fire</a> of 1871.<sup id="_ref-EOC562_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EOC562" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

Many of South Michigan Avenue&#39;s elegant villas were destroyed in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire" id="w">Great Chicago Fire</a> of 1871.<sup id="_ref-EOC772_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EOC772" title="">[8]</a></sup>  The post-fire South Side of <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a> grew rapidly as all economic classes left the city’s center. Many of Chicago’s elite families settled along Prairie Avenue. By the 1870s and 1880s, Prairie Avenue was the location of elaborate houses between 16th Street and 22nd Street (now <a href="/wiki/Cermak_Road" id="w">Cermak Road</a>).<sup id="_ref-EOC771_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EOC771" title="">[9]</a></sup> In 1886, the urban elite, including <a href="/wiki/George_Pullman" id="w">George Pullman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Field" id="w">Marshall Field</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philip_Armour" id="w">Philip Armour</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_B._Sherman" id="w">John B.

Businesses, such as the <a href="/wiki/Pullman_Company" id="w">Pullman Company</a>, <a href="/wiki/Armour_%26amp%3B_Company" id="w">Armour &#38; Company</a> and <a href="/wiki/D._H._Burnham_%26amp%3B_Company" id="w">D. H.

<p>However, as the turn of the century came, industry’s pervasive reach, increased railroad soot, and an encroaching vice district, caused the area to become less desirable, and the social elite vacated the region for quieter neighborhoods such as <a href="/wiki/Kenwood%2C_Chicago" id="w">Kenwood</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Near_North_Side%2C_Chicago#Gold Coast" id="w">Gold Coast</a> and more commonly the suburban <a href="/wiki/North_Shore_(Chicago)" id="w">North Shore</a>.<sup id="_ref-EOC772_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EOC772" title="">[8]</a></sup>  The <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Tribune" id="w">Chicago Tribune</a> highlighted 1898 Prairie Avenue as a place that was undesirable to those for whom it was affordable, and unaffordable to those for whom it was desirable.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  Light industry and vacant lots overtook Prairie Avenue during the second half of the twentieth century. The elegant mansions were mostly torn down or fell into extreme disrepair.<sup id="_ref-EOC644_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EOC644" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Influence" name="Influence"></a><h1>Influence</h1>
<p>During the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s, upper Prairie Avenue residents were central to cultural and social fabric of the city. The economy was supported by the thousands of jobs created by the <a href="/wiki/Pullman_Car_Company" id="w">Pullman Car Company</a> and <a href="/wiki/Armour_and_Company" id="w">Armour and Company</a>. Chicago&#39;s richest man, Marshall Fields changed the buying habits of the city. John Shorthall saved the property from total choas after the <a href="/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire" id="w">Great Chicago Fire</a> by saving property records. At one point in the 1880s, sixteen of the 60 members of the <a href="/wiki/Commercial_Club_of_Chicago" id="w">Commercial Club of Chicago</a> lived on Prairie Avenue.  <a href="/wiki/George_Armour" id="w">George Armour</a> headed the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, which became the <a href="/wiki/Art_Institute_of_Chicago" id="w">Art Institute of Chicago</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>As home to many of Chicago&#39;s leading families, Prairie Avenue became home to many important political movements. Woman&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Suffrage" id="w">suffrage</a> had activists, such as Illinois Women Suffrage Association President Jane Jones, on Prairie Avenue.  <a href="/wiki/Illinois_Central_Railroad_Co._v._State_of_Illinois" id="w">Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. State of Illinois</a>, {{ussc}}, pitted the public welfare of the city against the railroad industry and was the foundation for the public trust doctrine which facilitated the city&#39;s reclamation of much of the lakefront. Prairie Avenue residents bolstered other efforts to fight against the railroads. The concentration of wealth also made Prairie Avenue the target of complaints about taxation inequities.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many of these leading families also took part in <a href="/wiki/Philanthropy" id="w">philanthropy</a>.  <a href="/wiki/John_Shorthall" id="w">John Shorthall</a>, founder of Chicago Title &#38; Trust and Prairie Avenue resident, created the Illinois Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and convened local and state societies to unite under a national organization (<a href="/wiki/American_Society_for_the_Prevention_of_Cruelty_to_Animals" id="w">American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</a>) that could combine its political strength and lobby Congress.
