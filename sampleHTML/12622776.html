<b><i>Bonaparte Crossing the Alps</i></b> (also called <b><i>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</i></b>, despite the existence of <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_Crossing_the_Alps" id="w">another painting with that name</a>) is an 1848–1850<sup id="_ref-liver_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liver" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Oil_painting" id="w">oil-on-canvas</a> portrait of <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte" id="w">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, by <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> <a href="/wiki/Artist" id="w">artist</a> <a href="/wiki/Hippolyte_Delaroche" id="w">Hippolyte Delaroche</a>.<sup id="_ref-www_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-www" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-first_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-first" title="">[3]</a></sup> The painting depicts Bonaparte leading his army through the <a href="/wiki/Alps" id="w">Alps</a> on a mule,{{Ref label}} a journey Napoleon and his army of soldiers made in the spring of 1800,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> in an attempt to surprise the Austrian army in Italy.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The work was inspired by <a href="/wiki/Jacques-Louis_David" id="w">Jacques-Louis David&#39;s</a> series of five <i><a href="/wiki/Napoleon_Crossing_the_Alps" id="w">Napoleon Crossing the Alps</a></i> paintings (1801–1805). David&#39;s works also show Napoleon&#39;s journey through the <a href="/wiki/Great_St._Bernard_Pass" id="w">Great St. Bernard Pass</a>, but there are significant stylistic differences between the two conceptions. Delaroche&#39;s Napoleon is cold and downcast, whereas David&#39;s wears a pristine uniform, and is idealized as a hero. Delaroche was commissioned to paint a <a href="/wiki/Realism_(arts)" id="w">realistic</a> portrait; the style of which was emerging at the time.<sup id="_ref-liver_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liver" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-book1a_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-book1a" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the painting largely represented and was one of the pioneers of an emerging style, the work was criticised by several authorities on the subject. The reasons for this varied from Delaroche&#39;s depiction of the scene to a general disapproval of Delaroche himself. Many of those who were in the latter state of mind felt that Delaroche was trying to match the genius of Napoleon in some way, and had failed miserably in doing so.<sup id="_ref-liv_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liv" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

</p><a id="Historical_background" name="Historical_background"></a><h3> Historical background </h3>
<p>As part of his <a href="/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars:_Campaigns_of_1798" id="w">1798 campaign</a> during the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars" id="w">French Revolutionary Wars</a>, Napoleon prepared to invade and conquer <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>, which was at the time a province of the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Ottoman Empire</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Such a military action promised numerous benefits, including securing French trade interests, and inhibiting <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">British</a> access to <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>. By the first of July that same year, Napoleon had landed on the shores of Egypt.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> However, after a lengthy <a href="/wiki/French_invasion_of_Egypt_(1798)" id="w">chain of conflicts</a> that resulted in heavy casualties, the campaign resulted in an Ottoman-British victory, and Napoleon was forced to return to France.</p>
<p>When he arrived, he found that while he was in Egypt, <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austrian</a> forces had retaken Italy. In order to regain the upper hand, he planned to launch a surprise assault on the Austrian army stationed in the <a href="/wiki/Cisalpine_Republic" id="w">Cisalpine Republic</a>. Based on the assumption that the Austrians would never expect Napoleon&#39;s large force to be able to traverse the Alps, he chose that as his route.<sup id="_ref-aaa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aaa" title="">[11]</a></sup> He selected the shortest route through the Alps, the <a href="/wiki/Great_St_Bernard_Pass" id="w">Great St Bernard Pass</a>, which would enable him to reach his destination as quickly as possible.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>

Following his crossing of the Alps, Napoleon commenced military operations against the Austrian army. Despite an inauspicious start to the campaign, the Austrian forces were driven back to Marengo after nearly a month. There, a <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Marengo_(1800)" id="w">a large battle</a> took place on <a href="/wiki/June_14" id="w">June 14</a>, which resulted in the Austrian evacuation of Italy.<sup id="_ref-liver_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liver" title="">[1]</a></sup> Although Napoleon&#39;s army was victorious, it suffered more casualties: approximately 1,100 to the Austrians&#39;s 960.{{ref label}}</p>
<a id="Delaroche" name="Delaroche"></a><h3>Delaroche</h3>
<p>Delaroche&#39;s early works had been based on topics from the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible&#39;s</a> <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament" id="w">Old Testament</a>, but gradually his interests switched to painting scenes from English and French history.<sup id="_ref-www2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-www2" title="">[17]</a></sup> He &#39;combined colouristic skill with an interest in detailed scenes from history&#39;.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup><i>Bonaparte Crossing the Alps</i>, which was painted roughly eight years before Delaroche&#39;s death, exemplifies this phase in Delaroche&#39;s career.</p>
<p>Delaroche was involved in politics artistically, both in rebellion against political bodies in this way, and in support of the latter. As an advocate of the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" id="w">French Revolution</a>,<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> he was frequently commissioned to create banners for revolutionary parades and asked to paint works that would spark political unrest. However, it was this attachment to the revolution that was the reasoning behind his imprisoning in 1794, for a period of one year. Although Delaroche&#39;s career seemed to be at end, he was able reinvent himself by painting a self-portrait in prison. By the time he left prison, his reputation was secured and, when Napoleon was <a href="/wiki/First_French_Empire" id="w">crowned emperor of the French</a>, he gave Delaroche the position of First Painter.<sup id="_ref-antiq_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-antiq" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>The commissioning aside, Delaroche was inspired to create <i>Bonaparte Crossing the Alps</i> because he felt that he both looked like Napoleon, and that his achievements were comparable to Napoleon&#39;s.<sup id="_ref-www_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-www" title="">[2]</a></sup> It is likely that Delaroche&#39;s painting is relatively historically accurate; details such as Napoleon&#39;s clothes appear to have been researched by Delaroche in an effort at authenticity.<sup id="_ref-liv_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liv" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

</p><a id="Commissioning_of_painting" name="Commissioning_of_painting"></a><h3>Commissioning of painting</h3>
<p>The painting was commissioned by Arthur George, <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Onslow" id="w">Third Earl of Onslow</a>, after Delaroche and George visited the <a href="/wiki/Louvre" id="w">Louvre</a> in Paris, where they saw David&#39;s version of the famous event. It had only recently been re-hung in the museum after a resurgence of interest in Napoleon, nearly 40 years after he was exiled.{{ref label}} Agreeing that the painting was unrealistic, George, who owned a sizable collection of Napoleonic paraphernalia, commissioned Delaroche to create a more realistic depiction.<sup id="_ref-live_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-live" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Contrast_to_David's_depiction" name="Contrast_to_David's_depiction"></a><h3>Contrast to David&#39;s depiction</h3>
<p>The contrast between Jacques-Louis David&#39;s depiction of the same scene (of Napoleon traversing the Alps on his way to Italy), which was a flattering portrait that the king of Spain requested<sup id="_ref-antiq_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-antiq" title="">[20]</a></sup>{{ref label}} for Napoleon<sup id="_ref-liverpool_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liverpool" title="">[22]</a></sup> (as a gift) and Delaroche&#39;s depiction in <i>Bonaparte Crossing the Alps</i> is easily apparent. 
The first and most significant difference is in Napoleon, in his clothing, and in his general stature. David&#39;s version depicts Napoleon, dressed in an immaculate, multi-coloured uniform with a billowing cape. Delaroche&#39;s version, however, sees Napoleon in a fairly ordinary, gray coat with the sole purpose of keeping the cold away, rather than showing him as the <a href="/wiki/Symbol" id="w">symbol</a> he may have represented - that of a gallant and powerful war leader, which is the impression given in David&#39;s version.
However, there is another significant difference in Napoleon himself, in the way he holds himself. David&#39;s Napoleon is flamboyant,<sup id="_ref-liverpool_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liverpool" title="">[22]</a></sup> confident in his leadership of the French army, and in his ability to cross the Alps and defeat the Austrians in Italy. Delaroche&#39;s Napoleon is instead downcast, gaunt and embittered by the harsh cold. His eyes and expressionless face evidence his weariness, his tiredness a result of the long and unstable trek.
The last properly significant difference in the two art works (excluding the actual setting, background, men seen in the distance etc.) is the difference in the animals that Napoleon rides on. In David&#39;s version, Napoleon rides a large, strong steed with a long mane, and this is one figment of David&#39;s version that is irrefutably untrue - Napoleon is known to have ridden a mule on his journey (which was borrowed from a local peasant),<sup id="_ref-liver_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liver" title="">[1]</a></sup> rather than a horse.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-book_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-book" title="">[15]</a></sup> This presence of a horse rather than a mule was one of the most major grounds for Delaroche&#39;s  criticism of David&#39;s version, and is the basis of Delaroche&#39;s claim that <i>Bonaparte Crossing the Alps</i>, which includes a mule, is a more realistic portrayal of the scene.</p>

<p>Napoleon is seen wearing clothing appropriate for his location: over his uniform he wears a long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains a piece of his dignity in the gold-trimmed black <a href="/wiki/Bicorne" id="w">bicorne</a> he wears on his head.<sup id="_ref-book1a_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-book1a" title="">[7]</a></sup> The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On the left of the mule is his guide, <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Nicholas_Dorsaz" id="w">Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz</a>,<sup id="_ref-Fr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fr" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-aaa_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aaa" title="">[11]</a></sup> who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.</p>
<p>Elements of the cold, harsh environment of the Alps are apparent: distant mountains capped in snow rise up behind Napoleon and his troupe, while a steep cliff face appears on his left, and the path underfoot has a thick layer of ice.
More members of Napoleon&#39;s entourage can be seen slightly behind him, their robust figures accentuating Bonaparte&#39;s fragility.<sup id="_ref-book1a_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-book1a" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Napoleon is shown to be as he would have been high up in the mountains, as a mortal and imperilled man. While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon&#39;s figure (and contrasts in the extreme with David&#39;s version, which shows Napoleon impervious to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche&#39;s artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he really would have been in the situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon&#39;s iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.<sup id="_ref-www_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-www" title="">[2]</a></sup>

<a id="Artistic_style" name="Artistic_style"></a><h3>Artistic style</h3>
<p>Along with the mass of white seen behind Napoleon, the amber sunlight glow, originating from the West of Napoleon&#39;s troupe, is the central source of lighting in the painting. It introduces <a href="/wiki/Contrast_(vision)" id="w">contrast</a> when coupled with shadow, and, by illumination, highlights key aspects of the scene; this is particularly seen by the light that falls across Bonaparte&#39;s pigeon chest.<sup id="_ref-book1a_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-book1a" title="">[7]</a></sup> Napoleon and the mule he is saddled on are richly <a href="/wiki/Texture" id="w">textured</a> visually by the contrasting light and shade, as is the guide leading the mule. The ice and snow layers, also, are made whiter by the sunshine from the West, brightening the whole scene. However, the overhanging cliff on the left of Napoleon&#39;s guide and the legs of the mule both cast shadows to balance the lighting scheme of the painting.</p>
<p>The textural hues and schemes that Delaroche uses in this painting are quite detailed and well considered, especially in regards to the most important figures; such aspects of the work were described as being &#39;...rendered with a fidelity that has not omitted the plait of a drapery, the shaggy texture of the four-footed animal, nor a detail of the harness on his back&#39;.<sup id="_ref-liv_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liv" title="">[8]</a></sup>
The mule, especially its fur, was intensely textured and detailed to make it look visually rough and bristly, and the mule itself weary and worn. The same techniques were applied to the red and yellow adornments draped and hung over the animal.
The central detail of Napoleon is applied to his coat, in its ruffles and creases. Much detail and textural diversity is given to the guide too, most particularly to his face, his green, wind-caught tunic, and his leather boots.</p>
<p>Delaroche&#39;s attention to detail and literal precision in this painting evidences and demonstrates the slow but steady evolution of realism in art during the <a href="/wiki/19th_century" id="w">19th century</a>, and how its popularity began to rise.<sup id="_ref-liver_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liver" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h2> Reception </h2>
<p>The work, despite its attempt to depict Napoleon realistically, was criticised by several authorities for a variety of reasons. A few disapproved of Delaroche&#39;s choice of painting, while others disapproved of Delaroche himself, saying, in some form, that he sought the genius of Napoleon, to no avail.<sup id="_ref-liv_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-liv" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Soon after its completion, the work was taken to <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, and there, in <a href="/wiki/1850" id="w">1850</a>, it was reviewed by the critic of <i><a href="/wiki/Athenaeum_(magazine)" id="w">the Atheneum</a></i>,{{ref label}} a literary magazine.<sup id="_ref-Anth_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anth" title="">[25]</a></sup> The magazine&#39;s comments on the work indicated that, while they praised the painting for several of its features, they criticised Delaroche, for various reasons:</p>
<p>{{bquote}}</p>
<p>Some were displeased with Delaroche&#39;s work at the time in general, and, in part, <i>Bonaparte Crossing the Alps</i>, criticising what was described as his &#39;lowered standards in art&#39;. Such critics included <i><a href="/wiki/The_Gentleman%26%2339%3Bs_Magazine" id="w">The Gentleman&#39;s Magazine</a></i>, who wrote the following text about Delaroche:</p>
<p>{{bquote}}</p>
<p>Whether Delaroche had lost the sympathy referred to by his imprisonment, or by his promotion to the position of First Painter, is not clear, but it seems as though <i>The Gentleman&#39;s Magazine</i> did not feel he was bringing anything novel into the artistic spectrum by his use of realism in the painting.</p>
