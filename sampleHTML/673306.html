<p><b><i>Night of the Ghouls</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/1959" id="w">1959</a> <a href="/wiki/Ed_Wood%2C_Jr." id="w">Ed Wood</a> <a href="/wiki/Horror_film" id="w">horror</a> <a href="/wiki/Film" id="w">film</a>, a sequel of sorts to <i><a href="/wiki/Bride_of_the_Monster" id="w">Bride of the Monster</a></i>. The film was not publicly exhibited until <a href="/wiki/1987" id="w">1987</a>, as Wood could not afford to pay the lab fees to process the negatives, so they were held at a post-production house for 23 years.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a>, millionaire Wade Williams was informed about the film by Kathy Wood, and paid the outstanding lab fees, in addition to giving it a new title, as Wood had called it <i>Revenge of the Dead</i> (which is odd, because it was extensively covered in the third issue of <a href="/wiki/Famous_Monsters_of_Filmland" id="w">Famous Monsters of Filmland</a> magazine in the summer of 1959 as &#34;Night of the Ghouls&#34;). The film received limited theatrical play, and was simultaneously released on home video.</p>

<ul>
<li>This was 1 of 5 films featured on the cinema marquee in the movie &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Midnight_Hour" id="w">The Midnight Hour</a>&#34;</li>
<li>Towards the beginning of the film, in the police station, a picture of Wood is visible on the wall.</li>
<li>This film is part of what Wood aficionados refer to as &#34;The Kelton Trilogy&#34;, a trio of films featuring <a href="/wiki/Paul_Marco" id="w">Paul Marco</a> as &#34;Officer Kelton&#34;, a whining, reluctant policeman. The other two films are <i><a href="/wiki/Bride_of_the_Monster" id="w">Bride of the Monster</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Plan_9_from_Outer_Space" id="w">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a></i>. </li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Tom_Mason" id="w">Tom Mason</a> appeared in this film, credited as &#34;Thomas R. Mason&#34;. Mason was the man Wood used to replace <a href="/wiki/Bela_Lugosi" id="w">Bela Lugosi</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Plan_9_From_Outer_Space" id="w">Plan 9 From Outer Space</a></i>; this was his only other feature film appearance.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Kenne_Duncan" id="w">Kenne Duncan</a> had previously worked for Wood in a <a href="/wiki/Television" id="w">TV</a> on trick shooting and in Wood&#39;s 1953 TV pilot <i>Crossroad Avenger</i>.</li>
<li>The character of Dr. Acula also appeared in an unrealized Ed Wood film project of the same name. The role was originally intended for <a href="/wiki/Bela_Lugosi" id="w">Bela Lugosi</a>.  &#34;Dr. Acula&#34; has been a frequently used pun-name of <a href="/wiki/Forrest_J._Ackerman" id="w">Forrest J. Ackerman</a> since the 1940s.</li>
<li>Although claimed to be a follow up to <i><a href="/wiki/Bride_of_the_Monster" id="w">Bride of the Monster</a></i>, <i>Night of the Ghouls</i> featured only two characters from that film (Kelton and Lobo), and, in a <a href="/wiki/Retcon" id="w">retcon</a>, it is claimed that Lt. Bradford had worked on the earlier case when he in fact appeared nowhere in <i>Bride</i>. His exploration of Dr. Acula&#39;s house was borrowed from Wood&#39;s short film <i>Final Curtain</i> and given a voice-over to integrate it into the current story. As a result, there was no room for Harvey B. Dunn, who played Captain Tom Robbins in <i>Bride</i>, to reprise his earlier role. Instead, he was given a small supporting role as a frightened motorist who encounters one of the &#34;ghouls&#34;.</li>
<li>In the sitcom <i><a href="/wiki/Scrubs_(TV_series)" id="w">Scrubs</a></i> the main character J.D. is making a movie called &#34;Dr. Acula&#34;.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Misfits" id="w">Misfits</a> song called &#34;Ghouls Night Out&#34; is named after this movie.</li></ul>
