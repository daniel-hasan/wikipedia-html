In <a href="/wiki/Pre-Columbian" id="w">Pre-Columbian</a> times Key West was inhabited by the <a href="/wiki/Calusa" id="w">Calusa</a> people. The first <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> to visit was <a href="/wiki/Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n" id="w">Juan Ponce de León</a> in 1521. As Florida became a <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spanish</a> colony, a fishing and salvage village  with a small garrison was established here.{{Fact}}</p>
<a id="Cayo_Hueso" name="Cayo_Hueso"></a><h2>Cayo Hueso</h2>
<p><i>Cayo Hueso</i> (pronounced kī-yo-wess-so) is the original <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" id="w">Spanish</a> name for the island of Key West.  Spanish-speaking people also use the term <b><a href="/wiki/Es:Cayo_Hueso" id="w">Cayo Hueso</a></b> when referring to Key West.  It literally means &#34;bone key&#34;.  It is said that the island was littered with the remains (bones) from an <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Indian</a> battlefield or burial ground.  The most widely accepted theory of how the name changed to Key West is that it is a <a href="/wiki/False_friend" id="w">false friend</a> <a href="/wiki/Anglicization" id="w">anglicization</a> of the word, being that the word &#34;<i>hueso</i>&#34; (pronounced wess-so) sounds like it could mean &#34;west&#34; in English.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Other theories of how the island was named are that the name indicated that it was the westernmost Key,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> or that the island was the westernmost key with a reliable supply of water.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many businesses on the island use the name, such as <i>Casa Cayo Hueso</i>, <i>Cayo Hueso Resorts</i>, <i>Cayo Hueso Consultants</i>, <i>Cayo Hueso y Habana Historeum</i>, etc. </p>
<p>In 1763, when <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">Great Britain</a> took control of Florida, the community of <a href="/wiki/Spaniard" id="w">Spaniards</a> and <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native Americans</a> were moved to <a href="/wiki/Havana" id="w">Havana</a>.  Florida returned to Spanish control 20 years later, but there was no official resettlement of the island. Informally the island was used by <a href="/wiki/Fishermen" id="w">fishermen</a> from <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a> and from the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Bahamas" id="w">Bahamas</a>, who were later joined by others from the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> after the latter nation&#39;s independence. While claimed by Spain, no nation exercised <i><a href="/wiki/De_facto" id="w">de facto</a></i> control over the community there for some time.</p>

<p>In 1815 the Spanish <a href="/wiki/Governor" id="w">governor</a> in <a href="/wiki/Havana%2C_Cuba" id="w">Havana, Cuba</a> deeded the <a href="/wiki/Island" id="w">island</a> of Key West to Juan Pablo Salas, an officer of the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Navy" id="w">Royal Spanish Navy Artillery</a> posted in <a href="/wiki/Saint_Augustine%2C_Florida" id="w">Saint Augustine, Florida</a>. After Florida was transferred to the United States, Salas was so eager to sell the island that he sold it twice - first for a sloop valued at $575, and then to a U.S. <a href="/wiki/Businessman" id="w">businessman</a> John W. Simonton, during a meeting in a Havana <a href="/wiki/Cafe" id="w">cafe</a>, for the equivalent of $2,000 in pesos in 1821.  The sloop trader quickly sold the island to a General <a href="/wiki/John_Geddes" id="w">John Geddes</a>, a former governor of <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina" id="w">South Carolina</a>, who tried in vain to secure his rights to the property before Simonton, with the aid of some influential friends in Washington, was able to gain clear title to the island.  Simonton had wide-ranging business interest in <a href="/wiki/Mobile%2C_Alabama" id="w">Mobile, Alabama</a>. He bought the island because a friend, John Whitehead, had drawn his attention on the opportunities presented by the island&#39;s strategic location. John Whitehead had been stranded in Key West after a <a href="/wiki/Shipwreck" id="w">shipwreck</a> in 1819 and he had been impressed by the potential offered by the deep <a href="/wiki/Harbor" id="w">harbor</a> of the island. The island was indeed considered the <b>&#34;<a href="/wiki/Gibraltar" id="w">Gibraltar</a> of the West&#34;</b> because of its strategic location on the {{convert}} wide deep shipping lane <a href="/wiki/Straits_of_Florida" id="w">Straits of Florida</a> between the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf Of Mexico</a>. On <a href="/wiki/March_25" id="w">March 25</a>, 1822, <a href="/wiki/Matthew_C._Perry" id="w">Matthew C. Perry</a> sailed the schooner <a href="/wiki/USS_Shark_(1821)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Shark&#39;&#39;</a> to Key West and planted the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Flag" id="w">flag</a>, physically claiming the Keys as United States property.  Perry reported on <a href="/wiki/Piracy" id="w">piracy</a> problems in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" id="w">Caribbean</a>. 
Perry renamed Cayo Hueso (Key West) to &#34;Thompson&#39;s Island&#34; for the Secretary of the <a href="/wiki/Navy" id="w">Navy</a> <a href="/wiki/Smith_Thompson" id="w">Smith Thompson</a> and the harbor &#34;Port Rodgers&#34; for <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" id="w">War of 1812</a> hero <a href="/wiki/John_Rodgers_(naval_officer%2C_War_of_1812)" id="w">John Rodgers</a>.

<a id="First_developers" name="First_developers"></a><h2>First developers</h2>
<p>Soon after his purchase, Simonton subdivided the island into plots and sold 3 undivided quarters of each plot to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>John Mountain and U.S. Consul John Warner who quickly resold their quarter to Pardon C. Greene who took up residence on the island</li>
<li>John Whitehead, his friend who had advised him to buy Key West</li>
<li>John Fleeming (nowadays spelled Fleming)</li></ul>
<p><b>John Simonton</b> spent the winter in Key West and the summer in Washington where he lobbied hard for the development of the island and to establish a naval base on the island, both to take advantage of the island&#39;s strategic location and to bring law and order to the town. He died in 1854.</p>
<p><b>Pardon C. Greene</b> is the only one of the 4 &#34;founding fathers&#34; to establish himself permanently on the island where he became quite prominent as head of &#34;P.C. Greene and Company&#34;. He also served briefly as Mayor. He died in 1838 at the age of 57.</p>
<p><b>John Whitehead</b> lived in Key West for only eight years. He became a partner in the firm of &#34;P.C. Greene and Company&#34; from 1824-1827. A lifelong bachelor, he left the island for good in 1832. He came back only once during the Civil War in 1861 and died the next year.</p>
<p><b>John W.C. Fleeming</b> was English born and was active in mercantile business in Mobile, Alabama where he befriended John Simonton. Fleeming spent only a few months in Key West in 1822 and left for Massachusetts where he married. He returned to Key West in 1832 with the intention of developing salt manufacturing on the island but died the same year at the young age of 51.</p>
<p>The names of the 4 &#34;founding fathers&#34; of modern Key West were given to main arteries of the island when it was first platted in 1829 by William Adee Whitehead, John Whitehead&#39;s younger brother. That first plat and the names used remained mostly intact and is still in use today. Duval street, the island&#39;s main street is named after Florida&#39;s first territorial Governor who served between 1822 and 1834, the longest serving Governor in Florida&#39;s U.S. history.</p>
<p>William Whitehead became chief editorial writer for the &#34;Enquirer&#34; a local newspaper in 1834. He had the genius of preserving copies of his newspaper as well as copies from the &#34;Key West Gazette&#34;, its predecessor. He later sent those copies to the Monroe County Clerk for preservation which gives us a precious view on life in Key West in the early days (1820-1840).</p>

Some residents use the term &#34;Conch&#34; to refer to a person born in Key West, while the term &#34;Fresh Water Conch&#34; refers to a resident not born in Key West but who has lived in Key West for seven years or more.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>    However, the true original meaning of <i>Conch</i> applies only to someone with European ancestry that immigrated from the Bahamas.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  It is said that when a baby was born, the family would put a conch shell on a pole in front of their home. </p>

<p>Legend has it that Ernest Hemingway wrote <a href="/wiki/A_Farewell_to_Arms" id="w">A Farewell to Arms</a> while living above the show room of a Key West Ford dealership at 314 Simonton Street <a class="externallink" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=314+Simonton+Street,+Key+West,+Fl&#38;ll=24.558365,-81.802783&#38;spn=0.026074,0.05197&#38;om=1" rel="nofollow" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=314+Simonton+Street,+Key+West,+Fl&#38;ll=24.558365,-81.802783&#38;spn=0.026074,0.05197&#38;om=1">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=314+Simonton+Street,+Key+West,+Fl&#38;ll=24.558365,-81.802783&#38;spn=0.026074,0.05197&#38;om=1</a> while awaiting delivery of a Ford <a href="/wiki/Roadster" id="w">Roadster</a> purchased by the uncle of his wife Pauline in 1928.</p>
<p>Hardware store owner Charles Thompson introduced him to deep sea fishing.  Among the group that went fishing was Joe Russell (also known as <a href="/wiki/Sloppy_Joe%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">Sloppy Joe</a>).  Russell was reportedly the model for Freddy in <i>To Have and Have Not</i>. Portions of the original manuscript were found at Sloppy Joe’s Bar after his death.  The group had nicknames for each other and Hemingway wound up with &#34;Papa&#34;.</p>
<p>Pauline&#39;s rich uncle Gus Pfeiffer bought the <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway_House" id="w">907 Whitehead Street house</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=907+Whitehead+Street,+Key+West,+Fl&#38;ll=24.551105,-81.800466&#38;spn=0.026076,0.05197&#38;om=1" rel="nofollow" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=907+Whitehead+Street,+Key+West,+Fl&#38;ll=24.551105,-81.800466&#38;spn=0.026076,0.05197&#38;om=1">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=907+Whitehead+Street,+Key+West,+Fl&#38;ll=24.551105,-81.800466&#38;spn=0.026076,0.05197&#38;om=1</a> in 1931 as a wedding present.  Legend says the Hemingways installed a swimming pool for $20,000 in the late 1930s (equivalent in 2006 to $250,000).  It was such a high price that Hemingway is said to have put a penny in the concrete saying &#34;Here, take the last penny I&#39;ve got!&#34;  The penny is still there.</p>
<p>During his stay he wrote or worked on: <i><a href="/wiki/Death_in_the_Afternoon" id="w">Death in the Afternoon</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls" id="w">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Snows_of_Kilimanjaro" id="w">The Snows of Kilimanjaro</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Short_Happy_Life_of_Francis_Macomber" id="w">The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber</a></i>. He used Depression-era Key West as the locale for <i>To Have and Have Not</i> — his only novel set in the United States.</p>
<p>Pauline and Hemingway divorced in 1939 and Hemingway only occasionally visited while returning from Havana until his suicide in 1961.</p>
<p>The six or seven-toed <a href="/wiki/Polydactyl_cat" id="w">polydactyl</a> cats descended from Hemingway&#39;s original pet &#39;Snowball&#39; still live on the grounds and are cared for at the Hemingway House, despite complaints by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in which the Key West City Commission exempted the home from a law prohibiting more than four domestic animals per household.</p>
<a id="Tennessee_Williams" name="Tennessee_Williams"></a><h4>Tennessee Williams</h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" id="w">Tennessee Williams</a> first became a regular visitor to Key West in 1941, and is said to have written the first draft of <a href="/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(play)" id="w">A Streetcar Named Desire</a> while staying in 1947 at the La Concha Hotel.  He bought a permanent house in 1949 and listed Key West as his primary residence until his death in 1983. In contrast to Hemingway&#39;s grand house in Old Town, Williams home at 1431 Duncan Street <a class="externallink" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=1431+Duncan+Street,+Key+West,+Fl&#38;ll=24.555906,-81.786261&#38;spn=0.026075,0.05197&#38;om=1" rel="nofollow" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=1431+Duncan+Street,+Key+West,+Fl&#38;ll=24.555906,-81.786261&#38;spn=0.026075,0.05197&#38;om=1">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=1431+Duncan+Street,+Key+West,+Fl&#38;ll=24.555906,-81.786261&#38;spn=0.026075,0.05197&#38;om=1</a> in the &#34;unfashionable&#34; New Town neighborhood is a very modest bungalow.  The house is privately owned and not open to the public.  The Academy Award–winning film version of his “The Rose Tattoo” was shot on the island in 1956.  The Tennessee Williams Theatre is located on the campus of Florida Keys Community College on Stock Island. <a class="externallink" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=5901+College+Road,+Key+West,+Fl&#38;ll=24.577217,-81.746521&#38;spn=0.02607,0.05197&#38;om=1" rel="nofollow" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=5901+College+Road,+Key+West,+Fl&#38;ll=24.577217,-81.746521&#38;spn=0.02607,0.05197&#38;om=1">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=5901+College+Road,+Key+West,+Fl&#38;ll=24.577217,-81.746521&#38;spn=0.02607,0.05197&#38;om=1</a></p>
<p>Williams had a series of rentals all over the U.S. but the only home he owned was in Key West.</p>
<p>Even though Hemingway and Williams were in Key West at the same time, they reportedly only met once -- at Hemingway&#39;s Cuba home Finca Vigia.</p>

<p>Key West is much closer to <a href="/wiki/Havana" id="w">Havana</a> than it is to <a href="/wiki/Miami" id="w">Miami</a>, about half the distance.</p>
<p>In 1890 Key West had a population of nearly 18,800 and was the biggest and richest city in Florida.  Half the residents were said to be of Cuban origin and Key West regularly had Cuban mayors, including <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Manuel_de_C%C3%A9spedes" id="w">Carlos Manuel de Céspedes</a> Father of the Cuban Republic, who was elected mayor in 1876. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oaghe007.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oaghe007.php">http://www.amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oaghe007.php</a> Cubans were actively involved in reportedly 200 factories in town producing 100 million cigars annually.  <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mart%C3%AD" id="w">José Martí</a> made several visits to seek recruits for Cuban independence starting in 1891, and founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party during his visit to Key West. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oaghe007.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oaghe007.php">http://www.amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oaghe007.php</a></p>
<p>The Battleship <a href="/wiki/USS_Maine_(ACR-1)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Maine&#39;&#39;</a> sailed from Key West on its fateful visit to Havana, where it blew up, igniting the <a href="/wiki/Spanish-American_War" id="w">Spanish-American War</a>.  Crew men from the ship are buried in Key West and the Navy investigation into the blast occurred at the Key West Customs House.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Pan_American_Airlines" id="w">Pan American Airlines</a> was founded in Key West originally to fly visitors to Havana in 1926.  </p>

<p>Key West was flooded with refugees during the <a href="/wiki/Mariel_Boatlift" id="w">Mariel Boatlift</a>.  Refugees continue to come ashore and on at least one occasion, most notably in April 2003, flew hijacked Cuban Airlines planes into the city&#39;s airport.<a class="externallink" href="https://www.keysso.net/community_news/April_2003/April_2003.htm" rel="nofollow" title="https://www.keysso.net/community_news/April_2003/April_2003.htm">https://www.keysso.net/community_news/April_2003/April_2003.htm</a>.</p>

In 1982 Key West, and the rest of the Florida Keys, briefly declared its &#34;<a href="/wiki/Independence" id="w">independence</a>&#34; as the <b><a href="/wiki/Conch_Republic" id="w">Conch Republic</a></b> in a protest over a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol" id="w">United States Border Patrol</a> <a href="/wiki/Blockade" id="w">blockade</a>. This blockade was set up on U.S. 1 where the Northern end of the Overseas Highway meets the mainland at <a href="/wiki/Florida_City" id="w">Florida City</a>. This blockade was in response to the <a href="/wiki/Mariel_Boatlift" id="w">Mariel Boatlift</a>. A seventeen mile (27 km) traffic jam ensued while the <a href="/wiki/Border_Patrol" id="w">Border Patrol</a> stopped every car leaving the Keys supposedly searching for illegal aliens attempting to enter the mainland United States. This paralyzed the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Keys" id="w">Florida Keys</a>, which rely heavily on the tourism industry.  Flags, T-shirts and other merchandise representing the <a href="/wiki/Conch_Republic" id="w">Conch Republic</a> are still popular souvenirs for visitors to Key West, and the Conch Republic Independence Celebration--including parades and parties--is celebrated every April 23.</p>

Key West was always an important military post since it sits at the northern edge of the deep water channel connecting the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico (the southern terminus {{convert}} south is Cuba) via the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Straits" id="w">Florida Straits</a>.  Because of this Key West since the 1820s had been dubbed the &#34;Gibraltar of the West.&#34;  Fort Taylor was initially built on the island.  The Navy added a small base from which the <a href="/wiki/USS_Maine" id="w">USS Maine</a> sailed to its demise in <a href="/wiki/Havana" id="w">Havana</a> at the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Spanish-American_War" id="w">Spanish-American War</a>.  </p>
<p>At the beginning of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> the Navy increased its presence from 50 acres to 3,000 acres (12 km²) including {{convert}} of all of <a href="/wiki/Boca_Chica_Key" id="w">Boca Chica Key</a> and the construction of <a href="/wiki/Fleming_Key" id="w">Fleming Key</a> from landfill.  The Navy built the first water line extending the length of the keys.  At its peak 15,000 military and 3,400 civilians were at the base.  Included in the base are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>NAS Key West</b> - This is the main facility on Boca Chica where the Navy trains its pilots.  Staff are housed at Sigsbee Park.  In 2006 there were 1,650 active-duty; 2,507 family members; 35 Reserve; and 1,312 civilians listed at the base.  In the 1990s the Navy worked out an agreement with the <a href="/wiki/National_Park_Service" id="w">National Park Service</a> to stop <a href="/wiki/Sonic_booms" id="w">sonic booms</a> near <a href="/wiki/Fort_Jefferson" id="w">Fort Jefferson</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Dry_Tortugas" id="w">Dry Tortugas</a>.  Many of the training missions are directed at the <i>Marquesas &#34;Patricia&#34; Target</i> 29 nautical miles due west of the base.  The target is a grounded ship hulk 306-feet in length that is visible only at low tide.  Bombs are not actually dropped on the target.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Truman Annex</b> - The area next to Fort Taylor became a submarine pen and was used for the Fleet Sonar School.  Harry S. Truman was to make the commandant&#39;s house his winter White House.  The Fort Taylor Annex was later renamed the <a href="/wiki/Truman_Annex" id="w">Truman Annex</a>.  This portion has largely been decommissioned and turned over to private developers and the City of Key West.  However there are still a few offices including the new NOAA Hurricane Forecasting Center there.  The Navy still owns its piers.</li>
<li><b>Trumbo Annex</b> - The docking area on what had been the railroad yard for the Flager Overseas Railroad is now used by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard" id="w">Coast Guard</a>.</li></ul>

The Navy&#39;s pier is called the <i>Navy <a href="/wiki/Mole_(architecture)" id="w">Mole</a>.</i></p>
<p>In 1984 the city opened a pier right on <a href="/wiki/Mallory_Square" id="w">Mallory Square</a>.  The decision was met with considerable opposition from people who felt it would disrupt the tradition of watching the sunset at Mallory Square.  </p>

<a id="Old_Town/New_Town" name="Old_Town/New_Town"></a><h4>Old Town/New Town</h4>
<a id="Old_Town" name="Old_Town"></a><h5>Old Town</h5>
<p>The original Key West neighborhood in the <b>west</b> (although perceived as south) is called &#34;Old Town&#34; and comprises the <a href="/wiki/Key_West_Historic_District" id="w">Key West Historic District</a>.  It includes the major tourist destinations of the island including <a href="/wiki/Mallory_Square" id="w">Mallory Square</a>, <a href="/wiki/Duval_Street" id="w">Duval Street</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Truman_Annex" id="w">Truman Annex</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fort_Zachary_Taylor" id="w">Fort Zachary Taylor</a>. It is where you find the classic bungalows and guest mansions.</p>
<p>Generally, the structures date from 1886 to 1912. The basic features that distinguish the local architecture include wood frame construction of one to two-and-a-half story structures set on foundation piers about three feet above the ground. Exterior characteristics of the buildings are peaked &#34;tin&#34; roofs, horizontal wood siding, pastel shades of paint, side-hinged louvered shutters, covered porches (or balconies, galleries, or verandas) along the fronts of the structures, and wood lattice screens covering the area elevated by the piers.</p>

<p>The island has more than doubled in size via landfill.  The new section on the <b>east</b> (perceived as north) is called &#34;New Town.&#34; It contains shopping centers, strip malls and the island&#39;s commercial airport. Its most famous resident was <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" id="w">Tennessee Williams</a>, whose house is privately owned and not open to the public.</p>

One of the biggest attractions on the island is a concrete replica of a <a href="/wiki/Buoy" id="w">buoy</a> at the corner of South and Whitehead Streets that claims to be the southernmost point in the contiguous 48 states (see <a href="/wiki/Extreme_Points_of_the_United_States" id="w">Extreme Points</a> for more information.)  The point was originally just marked with a sign, which was often stolen.  In response to this, the city of Key West erected the now famous monument in 1983.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Brightly painted and labeled &#34;SOUTHERNMOST POINT CONTINENTAL U.S.A.&#34;, it is one of the most visited and photographed attractions in Key West.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  
Land on the <a href="/wiki/Truman_Annex" id="w">Truman Annex</a> property just west of the buoy is the true southernmost point, but it has no marker since it is U.S. Navy land and cannot be entered by civilian tourists.  The private yards directly to the east of the buoy and the beach areas of Truman Annex and <a href="/wiki/Fort_Zachary_Taylor" id="w">Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Park</a> also lie farther south than the buoy.

The claim &#34;90 Miles to Cuba&#34; on the monument isn&#39;t entirely accurate either, since Cuba at its closest point is 94 statute miles from Key West.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)" id="w">Precipitation</a> is characterized by dry and wet seasons.  The period of November through April receives abundant sunshine and slightly less than 25 percent of the annual rainfall.  This rainfall usually occurs in advance of cold fronts in a few heavy or light showers.  May through October is normally the <a href="/wiki/Wet_season" id="w">wet season</a>, receiving approximately 53 percent of the yearly total in numerous showers and <a href="/wiki/Thunderstorms" id="w">thunderstorms</a>. Rain falls on most days of the wet season.  Early morning is the favored time for these showers, which is different from mainland Florida, where showers and thunderstorms usually occur in the afternoon.  Easterly (tropical) waves during this season occasionally bring excessive rainfall, while infrequent <a href="/wiki/Hurricanes" id="w">hurricanes</a> may be accompanied by unusually heavy amounts.

Hurricanes rarely hit Key West and the island has been relatively lucky.  Locals say that <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Wilma" id="w">Hurricane Wilma</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_24" id="w">October 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, was the worst storm in memory.  The entire island was told to evacuate.  Business owners were forced to close their businesses. After the hurricane had passed, a storm surge sent 8&#39; of water inland, completely inundating a large portion of the lower Keys.  Low-lying areas of Key West and the lower Keys, including major tourist destinations were under up to 3&#39; of water.  Sixty percent of the homes in Key West were flooded.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>  The higher parts of Old Town, such as the <a href="/wiki/Solares_Hill" id="w">Solares Hill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Key_West_Cemetery" id="w">cemetery</a> areas, did not flood due to their higher elevations of 12-18&#39;.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>  The surge destroyed tens of thousands of cars throughout the lower Keys, and many houses were flooded with 1-2 feet of sea water.
