<b>Albert E. Jacomb</b> (c. <a href="/wiki/1873" id="w">1873</a>–<a href="/wiki/1946" id="w">1946</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Printer_(publisher)" id="w">printer</a> and founding member of the <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_Great_Britain" id="w">Socialist Party of Great Britain</a>.</p>
<p>Originally with his brother Josiah, Jacomb ran a printing shop in <a href="/wiki/Stratford%2C_London" id="w">Stratford</a> where he produced much early SPGB literature, including the <i><a href="/wiki/Socialist_Standard" id="w">Socialist Standard</a></i> from <a href="/wiki/1904" id="w">1904</a> to <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a>, as well as work for <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" id="w">trade unions</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1906" id="w">1906</a> the Jacomb brothers were involved in a scandal regarding the book <i><a href="/wiki/Womanhood_(book)" id="w">Womanhood</a></i> which they printed and sold. Although this book probably dealt with <a href="/wiki/Contraception" id="w">contraception</a> and the like, it was deemed <a href="/wiki/Obscene" id="w">obscene</a> by the authorities. The brothers were arrested and charged with selling indecent literature.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jacomb wrote two Socialist Party pamphlets, <i>Socialism</i> (<a href="/wiki/1920" id="w">1920</a>) and <i>The Socialist Party: Its Principles and Policies</i> (<a href="/wiki/1934" id="w">1934</a>), and was a prolific writer for the <i><a href="/wiki/Socialist_Standard" id="w">Socialist Standard</a></i>. He was an Executive Committee member from <a href="/wiki/1909" id="w">1909</a> to <a href="/wiki/1919" id="w">1919</a> and was also on the Editorial Committee. At a local level he was branch secretary for <a href="/wiki/East_London%2C_England" id="w">East London</a> in <a href="/wiki/1905" id="w">1905</a> and <a href="/wiki/East_Ham" id="w">East Ham</a> in <a href="/wiki/1906" id="w">1906</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the <a href="/wiki/1930s" id="w">1930s</a> he came into conflict with the Party, primarily over the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" id="w">Spanish Civil War</a>. Essentially Jacomb thought the Party should support the Republican side in a ‘war for democracy’. During the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a> his differences became stronger, and in a letter of <a href="/wiki/25_April" id="w">25 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a> he stated that he intended to publicly attack the SPGB as “a hindrance to the revolution”. This was too much and on <a href="/wiki/30_June" id="w">30 June</a> he was charged with action detrimental to the interests of the Party. The results of the party poll on his expulsion (207 votes in favour, 1 against) were announced on <a href="/wiki/15_December" id="w">15 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>. Subsequently he produced two pamphlets, <i>AE Jacomb’s case against the Socialist Party</i> and <i>Jacomb Again</i>.</p>
<p>He died in <a href="/wiki/1946" id="w">1946</a> aged 73.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
