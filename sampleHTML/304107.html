<b>Albert Benjamin &#34;Happy&#34; Chandler, Sr.</b> (<a href="/wiki/July_14" id="w">July 14</a> <a href="/wiki/1898" id="w">1898</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/June_15" id="w">June 15</a> <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a>) was twice <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Kentucky" id="w">governor of Kentucky</a>, a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" id="w">U.S. Senator</a>, the 2nd <a href="/wiki/Baseball_Commissioner" id="w">Commissioner of Major League Baseball</a>, and a member of the <a href="/wiki/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>. His jovial attitude earned him the nickname &#34;Happy,&#34; which stuck for the remainder of his life.<sup id="_ref-powell_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chandler&#39;s first term as governor is still regarded as one of the most productive of any Kentucky governor.<sup id="_ref-kye_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[2]</a></sup> Following on this success, he unsuccessfully tried to unseat <a href="/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_Senate" id="w">Senate Majority Leader</a> and fellow Kentuckian <a href="/wiki/Alben_Barkley" id="w">Alben Barkley</a>, but was appointed to the Senate shortly after the election due to the death of the state&#39;s junior senator. He would later resign this position to become Commissioner of Baseball, steering it through the difficult period of <a href="/wiki/Racial_integration" id="w">integration</a>, which many concede led to his not being offered a second contract for the position. Instead, twenty years after his first term as governor of Kentucky, Chandler returned to the Governor&#39;s Mansion using the slogan &#34;Be Like Your Pappy and Vote For Happy.&#34;<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Later in life, Chandler&#39;s commitment to <a href="/wiki/Civil_rights" id="w">civil rights</a> was questioned as he supported <a href="/wiki/Dixiecrat" id="w">Dixiecrat</a> <a href="/wiki/Strom_Thurmond" id="w">Strom Thurmond</a>&#39;s bid for President. Having been elected to his first term at the age of 37, Kentucky&#39;s &#34;Boy Governor&#34; was both the last surviving governor of any <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">U.S. state</a> to serve before 1939 and the last living Senator to have served before 1940 by the time of his death in 1991.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>

<p>Chandler was born <a href="/wiki/July_14" id="w">July 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1898" id="w">1898</a> in <a href="/wiki/Corydon%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Corydon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henderson_County%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Henderson County</a> <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" id="w">Kentucky</a> the son of Joseph Sephus and Callie Saunders-Chandler. His childhood was a difficult one. According to his <a href="/wiki/Autobiography" id="w">autobiography</a>, his earliest memory was his mother abandoning the family when he was four years old.<sup id="_ref-chandler_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chandler" title="">[4]</a></sup> Though cared for by his father and other relatives, by age eight, he was selling newspapers to supplement the family&#39;s income. At sixteen, his fourteen-year-old brother died after falling from a tree while picking cherries.<sup id="_ref-chandler_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chandler" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chandler graduated high school in 1917, and, against his father&#39;s wishes, enrolled at <a href="/wiki/Transylvania_University" id="w">Transylvania University</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lexington%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, with only &#34;a red sweater, a <a href="/wiki/Five_dollar_bill" id="w">five dollar bill</a>, and a smile.&#34; During his matriculation, he starred in three sports, captaining the <a href="/wiki/Basketball" id="w">basketball</a> and <a href="/wiki/Baseball" id="w">baseball</a> teams, and playing <a href="/wiki/Quarterback" id="w">quarterback</a> on the <a href="/wiki/American_football" id="w">football</a> team. He also joined the <a href="/wiki/Pi_Kappa_Alpha" id="w">Pi Kappa Alpha</a> fraternity after being denied membership in <a href="/wiki/Kappa_Alpha" id="w">Kappa Alpha</a>. Throughout his educational career, he worked odd jobs to support himself. In the fall semester of 1918, with his nation in the midst of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, Chandler volunteered to serve in the Student Army Training Corps, although the corps disbanded with the signing of an armistice in November.<sup id="_ref-chandler_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chandler" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chandler graduated from Transylvania in <a href="/wiki/1921" id="w">1921</a>, taking with him both a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor%26%2339%3Bs_degree" id="w">bachelor&#39;s degree</a> and his life-long nickname, &#34;Happy,&#34; which he was given because of his jovial attitude.<sup id="_ref-harrison_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup> From there, Chandler studied at <a href="/wiki/Harvard_Law_School" id="w">Harvard Law School</a>, coaching high school athletics to earn money. He returned to Lexington in 1922, attaining a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Laws" id="w">Bachelor of Laws</a> from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Kentucky" id="w">University of Kentucky</a> two years later. Again, he funded his education by coaching high school sports in nearby <a href="/wiki/Versailles%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Versailles</a>.<sup id="_ref-powell_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[1]</a></sup> For the next five years, Chandler was an assistant football coach at <a href="/wiki/Centre_College" id="w">Centre College</a> in <a href="/wiki/Danville%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Danville</a>, simultaneously practicing law in Versailles.<sup id="_ref-powell_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>While representing Margaret Hall, an Episcopal girls school, Chandler met <a href="/wiki/Keysville%2C_Virginia" id="w">Keysville, Virginia</a> native Mildred Watkins. He eventually persuaded his new love to break her engagement to another man. Despite Watkins&#39; eventual confession of having been married previously and being the mother of a two-year-old daughter, the two married on <a href="/wiki/November_12" id="w">November 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1925" id="w">1925</a>. Chandler immediately adopted Watkins&#39; daughter, Marcella, and the couple eventually had three children together: Mimi, Ben and Dan.<sup id="_ref-chandler_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chandler" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Early_political_career" name="Early_political_career"></a><h2>Early political career</h2>
<p>Chandler&#39;s career in politics began with an appointment by Judge Ben Williams to the post of master commissioner of the <a href="/wiki/Woodford_County%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Woodford County</a> Circuit Court in 1928. Only a year later, he was elected to represent Kentucky&#39;s 22<sup>nd</sup> Senate District in the <a href="/wiki/Kentucky_General_Assembly" id="w">Kentucky General Assembly</a>. He made a name for himself primarily on two issues: the repeal of <a href="/wiki/Parimutuel_betting" id="w">parimutuel betting</a> and a plan to build a hydroelectric dam on <a href="/wiki/Cumberland_Falls" id="w">Cumberland Falls</a>. Chandler opposed both proposals, and both eventually failed.<sup id="_ref-chandler_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chandler" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Split_with_Governor_Laffoon" name="Split_with_Governor_Laffoon"></a><h3>Split with Governor Laffoon</h3>
<p>In 1931, Chandler was elected <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Kentucky" id="w">lieutenant governor</a> of the state by a wide margin.<sup id="_ref-powell_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[1]</a></sup> Although Chandler and the elected governor, <a href="/wiki/Ruby_Laffoon" id="w">Ruby Laffoon</a> were both <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democrats</a>, Chandler soon split with his running mate and ended up working against many of his programs, particularly on the issue of a state <a href="/wiki/Sales_tax" id="w">sales tax</a>, which Laffoon supported but Chandler opposed.<sup id="_ref-harrison_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup> As lieutenant governor, Chandler also served as the presiding officer in the state senate, though his political opponents passed measures to limit his customary powers in retaliation for his split with Laffoon.<sup id="_ref-harrison_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Laffoon had hand-picked Thomas Rhea to succeed him as governor, but Chandler had other ideas. Advised by political allies, Chandler made the boldest move of his political career. Acting as governor while Laffoon was out of the state &#8211; as provided by the <a href="/wiki/Kentucky_Constitution" id="w">Kentucky Constitution</a> at the time &#8211; Chandler called the legislature into special session and pushed through a bill calling for candidates for governor to be chosen by <a href="/wiki/Primary_election" id="w">primaries</a> rather than elected at the party conventions. This bucking of the <a href="/wiki/Political_machine" id="w">political machine</a> made him a hero in the eyes of many voters.<sup id="_ref-harrison_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="First_term_as_governor" name="First_term_as_governor"></a><h3>First term as governor</h3>
<p>Chandler did succeed in his bid for governor in 1935, defeating Rhea in a runoff primary and disposing of <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Republican</a> challenger King Swope by a hefty margin. At a mere 37 years old, Chandler was dubbed the &#34;Boy Governor.&#34;  As promised, he quickly oversaw the repeal of the state&#39;s sales tax, compensating for the financial loss to the state by raising <a href="/wiki/Excise_tax" id="w">excise</a> and <a href="/wiki/Income_tax" id="w">income</a> taxes.<sup id="_ref-kye_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[2]</a></sup> The 1935 repeal of Kentucky&#39;s prohibition amendment gave Chandler a further source of revenue &#8211; a tax on <a href="/wiki/Whiskey" id="w">whiskey</a>. Frugality and fiscal responsibility became hallmarks of Chandler&#39;s administration. The Government Reorganization Act of 1936 so streamlined the state&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Bureaucracy" id="w">bureaucracy</a> that Chandler was able to cut the state&#39;s outstanding debt by 75%, a whopping $28.5 million.<sup id="_ref-harrison_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Chandler increased spending on several projects and proposals throughout his term, however. He supported the state&#39;s Old Age Pension Law<sup id="_ref-eok_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eok" title="">[6]</a></sup> and created a pension fund for the state&#39;s teachers. In 1936, he allocated $2 million to improve the state&#39;s rural roads and led the state to participate in the federal <a href="/wiki/Rural_Electrification_Act" id="w">Rural Electrification Act</a>. He also provided for free textbooks for students in public schools, and dramatically increased funding for schools, colleges, and universities in the state. By the end of Chandler&#39;s first year in office, University of Kentucky president Frank L. McVey proclaimed that &#34;much more has been accomplished than would have been thought possible.&#34;<sup id="_ref-harrison_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chandler&#39;s heroics continued during the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River_flood_of_1937" id="w">Ohio River flood of 1937</a>, when he personally supervised the evacuation of a partly-flooded <a href="/wiki/Penitentiary" id="w">penitentiary</a> in <a href="/wiki/Frankfort%2C_Kentucky" id="w">Frankfort</a>.<sup id="_ref-harrison_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup> Though he opposed the <a href="/wiki/Closed_shop" id="w">closed shop</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sit-down_strike" id="w">sit-down strike</a> tactics used by the state&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Labor_union" id="w">labor unions</a>, Chandler also earned a reputation as a friend of organized labor by creating a state Department of Industrial Relations and supporting the federal <a href="/wiki/Child_Labor_Amendment" id="w">Child Labor Amendment</a>, though it was never ratified.<sup id="_ref-harrison_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup> During his tenure as governor, he earned <a href="/wiki/Doctor_of_Laws" id="w">Doctor of Laws</a> degrees from Transylvania in 1936 and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Kentucky_College_of_Law" id="w">University of Kentucky College of Law</a> in 1937.<sup id="_ref-powell_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Service_in_the_United_States_Senate" name="Service_in_the_United_States_Senate"></a><h3>Service in the United States Senate</h3>
<p>In 1938, while still serving as governor, Chandler challenged <a href="/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_Senate" id="w">Senate Majority Leader</a> (and future <a href="/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States" id="w">Vice President</a>) <a href="/wiki/Alben_Barkley" id="w">Alben Barkley</a> in the Democratic primary for Barkley&#39;s seat in Congress. Though Chandler lost to the very popular Barkley, President <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" id="w">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> felt compelled to make a trip to the state to support Barkley&#39;s candidacy.<sup id="_ref-kye_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chandler would get his chance at the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" id="w">Senate</a> soon enough, however. In 1939, the state&#39;s junior Senator, <a href="/wiki/M._M._Logan" id="w">M. M. Logan</a>, died. Under an arrangement with Lieutenant Governor <a href="/wiki/Keen_Johnson" id="w">Keen Johnson</a>, Chandler resigned his position, elevating Johnson to the governorship. Johnson, in turn, appointed Chandler to fill Logan&#39;s seat in the Senate. Chandler retained the seat in a special election in 1940, and was re-elected to a full term in <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>, defeating former ally <a href="/wiki/John_Y._Brown%2C_Sr." id="w">John Y. Brown</a>.<sup id="_ref-harrison_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>During his tenure in the Senate, Chandler usually backed the policies of President Roosevelt.<sup id="_ref-harrison_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup> As a member of the Senate&#39;s Military Affairs Committee, he was vocal in his opposition to prioritizing the European front over defeating <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>.<sup id="_ref-harrison_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup> He and five other senators toured American military bases, successfully lobbying to strengthen those in the <a href="/wiki/Aleutian_Islands" id="w">Aleutian Islands</a> area.<sup id="_ref-shriners_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shriners" title="">[7]</a></sup> It was also during his time in the Senate that he developed a friendship with comedian <a href="/wiki/Bob_Hope" id="w">Bob Hope</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Commissioner_of_Baseball" name="Commissioner_of_Baseball"></a><h2>Commissioner of Baseball</h2>
<p>When baseball&#39;s first <a href="/wiki/Baseball_Commissioner" id="w">commissioner</a>, Judge <a href="/wiki/Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis" id="w">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a>, died in 1944, an official in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_War" id="w">War Department</a> began campaigning for Chandler&#39;s election to the post. Despite being the last candidate put forth in the April <a href="/wiki/1945_in_baseball" id="w">1945</a> meetings, he was elected by a unanimous vote of the team owners, and resigned his Senate seat in October of that year.<sup id="_ref-mlb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mlb" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Chandler clashed with <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn_Dodgers" id="w">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> manager <a href="/wiki/Leo_Durocher" id="w">Leo &#34;the Lip&#34; Durocher</a> over Durocher&#39;s association with gambling figures and his marriage to actress <a href="/wiki/Laraine_Day" id="w">Laraine Day</a>, which came amid allegations from Day&#39;s ex-husband that Durocher had stolen her away from him.<sup id="_ref-rogers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rogers" title="">[10]</a></sup> Before the start of the 1947 season, Chandler suspended Durocher for the entire season, citing &#34;conduct detrimental to baseball.&#34;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The Dodgers went on to win the pennant that season under replacement manager <a href="/wiki/Burt_Shotton" id="w">Burt Shotton</a>.<sup id="_ref-rogers_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rogers" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chandler became known as &#34;the players&#39; commissioner&#34; for his work on their behalf.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> During his service, he presided over the establishment of a pension fund for players, but his most significant contribution was overseeing the initial steps toward <a href="/wiki/Racial_integration" id="w">integration</a> of the major leagues, beginning with the debut of <a href="/wiki/Jackie_Robinson" id="w">Jackie Robinson</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers" id="w">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> in <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a>. This move was controversial with some team owners and was credited by many in the sports community with Chandler&#39;s failure to be selected for another term as Commissioner after the expiration of his first one in <a href="/wiki/1951_in_baseball" id="w">1951</a>.<sup id="_ref-harrison_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Second_term_as_governor" name="Second_term_as_governor"></a><h2>Second term as governor</h2>
<p>After being forced out as Commissioner of Baseball, Chandler returned to Versailles and continued to practice law. His hiatus from public life would be short lived, however. While prohibited by the <a href="/wiki/Kentucky_Constitution" id="w">Kentucky Constitution</a> from serving <i>consecutive</i> terms as governor, nothing prohibited Chandler from seeking a second gubernatorial term in 1955, twenty years after his first bid. He secured the Democratic nomination over challenger <a href="/wiki/Bert_T._Combs" id="w">Bert T. Combs</a>, and took the general election from Republican Edwin R. Denny by landslide.<sup id="_ref-kye_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Much had changed in the years since Chandler&#39;s first term as governor. In 1948, he had embraced the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Dixiecrats" id="w">Dixiecrats</a>,&#34; a Southern faction that had broken from the national Democratic Party, and their segregationist presidential nominee, <a href="/wiki/Strom_Thurmond" id="w">Strom Thurmond</a>.<sup id="_ref-eb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eb" title="">[13]</a></sup> This move had alienated him from some in his own party at the state level as well.<sup id="_ref-kye_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[2]</a></sup> Nevertheless, he was able to make positive changes in the state in his second term, continuing his themes of improving education and <a href="/wiki/Public_works" id="w">public works</a>. He oversaw the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/Chandler_Medical_Center" id="w">University of Kentucky Medical Center</a> which bears his name. Having already integrated baseball, in 1956, Chandler used <a href="/wiki/United_States_National_Guard" id="w">National Guard</a> troops to enforce <a href="/wiki/Racial_integration" id="w">racial integration</a> of schools in two Kentucky towns.<sup id="_ref-kye_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kye" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Later_career" name="Later_career"></a><h2>Later career</h2>
<p>Chandler remained active in Kentucky politics long after his final term as governor ended. He lost the Democratic gubernatorial primary to <a href="/wiki/Edward_T._Breathitt" id="w">Edward T.

<p>In his last years, Chandler remained active as a member of the Boards of Trustees of both Transylvania University and the University of Kentucky.<sup id="_ref-harrison_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-harrison" title="">[5]</a></sup> During a meeting of the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees finance committee on <a href="/wiki/April_5" id="w">April 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1988" id="w">1988</a>, Chandler drew the ire of several student groups by using a racial <a href="/wiki/Epithet" id="w">epithet</a>. During a discussion of the university&#39;s <a href="/wiki/1985" id="w">1985</a> decision to dispose of its investments in <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a>, Chandler, a member of the Board, remarked &#34;You know <a href="/wiki/Zimbabwe" id="w">Zimbabwe</a>&#39;s all nigger now. There aren&#39;t any whites.&#34;<sup id="_ref-nyt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nyt" title="">[14]</a></sup> He later apologized for his comments.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
