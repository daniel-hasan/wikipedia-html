<a id="Early_life_and_family" name="Early_life_and_family"></a><h1>Early life and family</h1>
<p>Polk was born <a href="/wiki/November_14" id="w">November 14</a> <a href="/wiki/1788" id="w">1788</a> near <a href="/wiki/Bridgeville%2C_Delaware" id="w">Bridgeville</a>, <a href="/wiki/Delaware" id="w">Delaware</a>, son of Charles and Mary Manlove Polk. The Polk family originally came from <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a> and <a href="/wiki/U.S._President" id="w">U.S. President</a> <a href="/wiki/James_K._Polk" id="w">James K. Polk</a> was a distant cousin. Robert Polk settled in <a href="/wiki/Somerset_County%2C_Maryland" id="w">Somerset County</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maryland" id="w">Maryland</a> in 1660 and the <a href="/wiki/Delaware" id="w">Delaware</a> family descended from him. Charles Polk, Sr. was a veteran of the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution" id="w">American Revolution</a>, having served in Colonel <a href="/wiki/David_Hall" id="w">David Hall</a>&#39;s regiment in 1777. He was a large landowner in the <a href="/wiki/Bridgeville%2C_Delaware" id="w">Bridgeville</a> area, served eight years in the <a href="/wiki/Delaware_House_of_Representatives" id="w">State House</a>, and was a member of the <a href="/wiki/Delaware" id="w">Delaware</a> Constitutional Convention of 1792.</p>
<p>After his father&#39;s death in 1795, Charles, Jr. attended Westtown Boarding School in <a href="/wiki/Chester_County%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Chester County</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a> and then studied <a href="/wiki/Law" id="w">Law</a> with <a href="/wiki/Kensey_Johns_(jurist)" id="w">Kensey Johns, Sr.</a>, but never practiced. By 1812 he was the owner of the <i>Knife and Fork</i> Tavern near <a href="/wiki/Bridgeville%2C_Delaware" id="w">Bridgeville</a>. He married Mary Elizabeth Purnell and they had nine children, including, Charles, William Alexander, and Theodore. In 1816 Polk purchased a large tract of land at Big Stone Beach, near Milford, in what is now Milford Hundred, in <a href="/wiki/Kent_County%2C_Delaware" id="w">Kent County</a>, <a href="/wiki/Delaware" id="w">Delaware</a>. He established his residence there on <a href="/wiki/Delaware_Bay" id="w">Delaware Bay</a>. They were members of the <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian_Church_(USA)" id="w">Presbyterian Church</a>.</p>
<a id="Political_career" name="Political_career"></a><h1>Political career</h1>
<p>Polk was a member of the <a href="/wiki/Federalist_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Federalist Party</a>, which was the majority party in <a href="/wiki/Kent_County%2C_Delaware" id="w">Kent</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sussex_County%2C_Delaware" id="w">Sussex County</a>, but was nearly matched in popularity statewide by the <a href="/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic-Republican Party</a> because of that party&#39;s strength in <a href="/wiki/New_Castle_County%2C_Delaware" id="w">New Castle County</a>. As a result statewide elections were usually close and hard fought. <a href="/wiki/Delaware" id="w">Delaware</a> was the last state in the country to have an effective <a href="/wiki/Federalist_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Federalist Party</a>, it having virtually disappeared everywhere else. By 1827 members of the old Jeffersonian <a href="/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic-Republican Party</a> had split into a <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" id="w">Jacksonian</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic</a> faction or an <a href="/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams" id="w">Adams</a>/<a href="/wiki/Henry_Clay" id="w">Clay</a> faction, known initially as the <a href="/wiki/National_Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">National Republicans</a>, and later as <a href="/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Whigs</a>. The remaining <a href="/wiki/Federalist_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Federalists</a>, which were many in <a href="/wiki/Delaware" id="w">Delaware</a>, did likewise.</p>
<p>Polk, and most of the <a href="/wiki/Federalist_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Federalists</a> in <a href="/wiki/Delaware" id="w">Delaware</a>, joined the <a href="/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams" id="w">Adams</a>/<a href="/wiki/Henry_Clay" id="w">Clay</a> faction, and began a <a href="/wiki/National_Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">National Republican</a>, then <a href="/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Whig</a> ascendancy in <a href="/wiki/Delaware" id="w">Delaware</a> politics. Like the <a href="/wiki/Federalist_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Federalists</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Whigs</a> were especially strong in <a href="/wiki/Kent_County%2C_Delaware" id="w">Kent</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sussex_County%2C_Delaware" id="w">Sussex County</a>, but were nearly matched by the new <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic Party</a> majority in <a href="/wiki/New_Castle_County%2C_Delaware" id="w">New Castle</a>. The upstate /downstate competition continued as before, just under new names.</p>
<p>Polk first represented <a href="/wiki/Sussex_County%2C_Delaware" id="w">Sussex County</a>, and served two terms in the <a href="/wiki/Delaware_House_of_Representatives" id="w">State House</a> in the 1814 and 1815 sessions. After moving to <a href="/wiki/Kent_County%2C_Delaware" id="w">Kent County</a> he was elected to the <a href="/wiki/Delaware_House_of_Representatives" id="w">State House</a> again, this time from <a href="/wiki/Kent_County%2C_Delaware" id="w">Kent County</a>. He served two more terms in the 1818 and 1824 sessions. Polk was also elected to the <a href="/wiki/Kent_County%2C_Delaware" id="w">Kent County</a> Levy Court in 1819. In 1824 he was elected to the <a href="/wiki/Delaware_Senate" id="w">State Senate</a> and served one term including the 1825, 1826 and 1827 sessions. He was the <a href="/wiki/Speaker_(politics)" id="w">Speaker</a> in the 1826 session. </p>
<a id="Governor_of_Delaware" name="Governor_of_Delaware"></a><h1>Governor of Delaware</h1>
<p>In 1826, the <a href="/wiki/Federalist_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Federalist Party</a> selected Polk as their candidate for <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Delaware" id="w">Governor</a>, and after a hard fought campaign, he was elected, narrowly defeating the <a href="/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic-Republican</a> candidate, <a href="/wiki/David_Hazzard" id="w">David Hazzard</a>. He served one term as <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Delaware" id="w">Governor of Delaware</a> from <a href="/wiki/January_16" id="w">January 16</a> <a href="/wiki/1827" id="w">1827</a> to <a href="/wiki/January_19" id="w">January 19</a> <a href="/wiki/1830" id="w">1830</a>. </p>
<p>Legislation was passed in 1829 that called for the creation of school districts in each <a href="/wiki/Hundred_(division)#United States" id="w">hundred</a> throughout the state, with small schools placed within two miles of every student. This was an ambitious and creative plan to improve secondary education developed and promoted by <a href="/wiki/Willard_Hall" id="w">Willard Hall</a>, now the <a href="/wiki/United_States_District_Judge" id="w">United States District Judge</a> for <a href="/wiki/Delaware" id="w">Delaware</a>. There was some state funding, but the expectation was the localities would supplement it. Many did not.</p>
<p>During Polk&#39;s term declining agricultural yields due to worn out soil were a matter of great concern. To address the concern, the <a href="/wiki/Delaware_General_Assembly" id="w">Delaware General Assembly</a> hired an expert from the Franklin Institute in <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Philadelphia</a>, who provided a good deal of helpful advice on the use of fertilizers. As it happened, the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Chesapeake_and_Delaware_Canal" id="w">Chesapeake and Delaware Canal</a> was beginning, and some farmers in <a href="/wiki/New_Castle_County%2C_Delaware" id="w">New Castle County</a> realized the marl obtained from the dredging would enrich their soil. Using this soil, the first peach trees were planted near <a href="/wiki/Delaware_City%2C_Delaware" id="w">Delaware City</a>.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many thought the problem lay elsewhere. No doubt, reflecting this thinking Polk, as <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Delaware" id="w">Governor</a> in 1837, blamed the problem on inadequate labor, saying the problem lay with &#34;the wretched condition of the colored population which infests the state...irresponsible, lawless, and miserable...a migratory tribe without fixed abode, alternatively roving from city to country.&#34; He and others were concerned about the large number of free <a href="/wiki/African-Americans" id="w">African-Americans</a> and rather than addressing the issue directly, sought to restrict their entry into <a href="/wiki/Delaware" id="w">Delaware</a>. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
