It is interesting to note that Archbishop Harty had a very close affinity to La Salle since he was schooled in his grade school and high school years in the U. S. in De La Salle Christian Brother-run schools. In 1921, the school moved to its present site on <a href="/wiki/De_La_Salle_University-Manila" id="w">Taft Avenue</a> and the Brothers have since opened schools in Greenhills, <a href="/wiki/Mandaluyong_City" id="w">Mandaluyong City</a>; <a href="/wiki/Antipolo%2C_Rizal" id="w">Antipolo, Rizal</a>; <a href="/wiki/Lipa_City" id="w">Lipa City</a>, <a href="/wiki/Batangas" id="w">Batangas</a>; <a href="/wiki/Bacolod%2C_Negros_Occidental" id="w">Bacolod, Negros Occidental</a>; <a href="/wiki/Iligan" id="w">Iligan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lanao_del_Norte" id="w">Lanao del Norte</a>; <a href="/wiki/Dasmari%C3%B1as%2C_Cavite" id="w">Dasmariñas, Cavite</a> and Alabang, <a href="/wiki/Muntinlupa_City" id="w">Muntinlupa City</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

The school&#39;s location in Southern <a href="/wiki/Metro_Manila" id="w">Metro Manila</a> also helps in achieving the government&#39;s goal of dispersing educational institutions over the Metro, as well as the goal of the Brothers in the Philippines of making their resources available to as many communities as possible.<sup id="_ref-history_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<div class="caption">700px</div></p>
<p>The campus is situated on an irregularly-shaped lot located at the heart of the Ayala Alabang Village.  The campus&#39;s master plan was designed by the firm of Filipino architect, <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Ma%C3%B1osa" id="w">Francisco Mañosa</a>.  In the master plan, the main objective was the creation of a unified learning environment, with the school grounds having a countryside atmostphere.  In this view, alterations to the natural elements of the lot were kept at a minimum.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>When the school opened in <a href="/wiki/1978" id="w">1978</a>, there was only one building available for use, the St. La Salle Building, then called the &#34;Main Building.&#34;  At present, the campus is composed of a number of structures which have been necessitated by the burgeoning school population.
