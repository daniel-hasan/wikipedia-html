The <b>national parks of England and Wales</b> are areas of relatively undeveloped and scenic landscape that are designated under the <a href="/wiki/National_Parks_and_Access_to_the_Countryside_Act_1949" id="w">National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949</a>. Despite the name, <a href="/wiki/National_park" id="w">national parks</a> in <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wales" id="w">Wales</a> are quite different from those in many other countries, where national parks are owned and managed by the government as a protected community resource, and permanent human communities are not a part of the landscape. In England and Wales, designation as a national park can include substantial settlements and land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and land within a national park remains largely in private ownership.</p>
<p>There are currently 12 national parks (<a href="/wiki/Welsh_language" id="w">Welsh</a>: <i>parciau cenedlaethol</i>) in England and Wales.  A further area in England &#8212; the <a href="/wiki/South_Downs" id="w">South Downs</a> &#8212; is in the process of being designated as a national park. Each park is operated by its own <a href="/wiki/National_Park_Authority" id="w">National Park Authority</a>, with two &#34;statutory purposes&#34;:
</p>
<ol>
<li>to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, <a href="/wiki/Wildlife" id="w">wildlife</a> and cultural heritage of the area, and</li>
<li>to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the park&#39;s special qualities by the public.</li></ol>
<p>An estimated 110 million people visit the national parks of England and Wales each year. Recreation and tourism bring visitors and funds into the parks, to sustain their <a href="/wiki/Conservation_ethic" id="w">conservation</a> efforts and support the local population through jobs and businesses. These visitors also bring problems, such as <a href="/wiki/Erosion" id="w">erosion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Traffic_congestion" id="w">traffic congestion</a>, and conflicts over the use of the parks&#39; resources.</p>

<p>Before the 19th century relatively wild, remote areas were often seen simply as uncivilised and dangerous. In 1725 <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Defoe" id="w">Daniel Defoe</a> described the <a href="/wiki/Peak_District" id="w">High Peak</a> as &#34;the most desolate, wild and abandoned country in all England.&#34;. However, by the early 19th century, <a href="/wiki/Romantic_Poetry" id="w">romantic poets</a> such as <a href="/wiki/George_Gordon_Byron%2C_6th_Baron_Byron" id="w">Byron</a>, <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge" id="w">Coleridge</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Wordsworth" id="w">Wordsworth</a> wrote about the inspirational beauty of the &#34;untamed&#34; countryside.<sup id="_ref-natparks_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-natparks" title="">[1]</a></sup> Wordsworth described the <a href="/wiki/Lake_District" id="w">Lake District</a> as a &#34;sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy&#34; in 1810. This early vision took over a century, and much controversy, to take legal form in the UK with the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949.</p>
<p>The idea for a form of national parks was first proposed in the United States in the 1860s, where <a href="/wiki/National_Parks" id="w">National Parks</a> were established to protect <a href="/wiki/Wilderness" id="w">wilderness</a> areas such as <a href="/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park" id="w">Yosemite</a>. This model has been used in many other countries since, but not in the United Kingdom. After thousands of years of human integration into the landscape, Britain lacks natural areas of wilderness. Furthermore, those areas of natural beauty so cherished by the romantic poets were often only maintained and managed in their existing state by human activity, usually agriculture.</p>

<p>By the early 1930s, increasing public interest in the countryside, coupled with the growing and newly mobile urban population, was generating increasing friction between those seeking access to the countryside and landowners. Alongside of direct action trespasses, such as the <a href="/wiki/Mass_trespass_of_Kinder_Scout" id="w">mass trespass of Kinder Scout</a>, several voluntary bodies took up the cause of public access in the political arena.</p>
<p>In 1931, <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Addison%2C_1st_Viscount_Addison" id="w">Christopher Addison</a> (later Lord Addison) chaired a government committee that proposed a &#39;National Park Authority&#39; to choose areas for designation as national parks.<sup id="_ref-UKNPhistory_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UKNPhistory" title="">[2]</a></sup> A system of national reserves and nature sanctuaries was proposed:</p>
<dl><dd>&#34;(i) to safeguard areas of exceptional natural interest against (a) disorderly development and (b) spoliation; (ii) to improve the means of access for pedestrians to areas of natural beauty; and (iii) to promote measures for the protection of <a href="/wiki/Flora_(plants)" id="w">flora</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fauna_(animals)" id="w">fauna</a>.&#34;</dd></dl>
<p>However, no further action was taken after the intervention of the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1931" id="w">1931 General Election</a>.</p>
<p>The voluntary Standing Committee on National Parks first met on <a href="/wiki/26_May" id="w">26 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1936" id="w">1936</a> to put the case to the government for national parks in the UK. After World War II, the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" id="w">Labour Party</a> proposed the establishment of national parks as part of the post-war reconstruction of the UK. A report by <a href="/wiki/John_Dower" id="w">John Dower</a>, secretary of the Standing Committee on National Parks,<sup id="_ref-FAQS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FAQS" title="">[3]</a></sup> to the Minister of Town and Country Planning in 1945 was followed in 1947 by a Government committee, this time chaired by Sir <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Hobhouse" id="w">Arthur Hobhouse</a>, which prepared legislation for national parks, and proposed 12 national parks. Sir Arthur had this to say on the criteria for designating suitable areas:</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/National_Parks_and_Access_to_the_Countryside_Act_1949" id="w">National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949</a> was passed with all party support. The first 10 national parks were designated as such in the 1950s under the Act in mostly poor-quality agricultural <a href="/wiki/Upland_(geology)" id="w">upland</a>. The land was still owned by individual landowners, often private estates, but also property owned by public bodies such as <a href="/wiki/The_Crown" id="w">the Crown</a>, or charities which allow and encourage access such as the <a href="/wiki/National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty" id="w">National Trust</a>. Accessibility from the <a href="/wiki/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom#List of cities" id="w">cities</a> was also considered important.</p>
<p>Other areas were also considered: for example, parts of the coast of <a href="/wiki/Cornwall" id="w">Cornwall</a> were considered as a possible national park in the 1950s but were thought to be too disparate to form a single coherent national park and were eventually designated as an <a href="/wiki/Areas_of_Outstanding_Natural_Beauty_in_England_and_Wales" id="w">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> (AONB) instead. The north <a href="/wiki/Pennines" id="w">Pennines</a> were also considered for designation as a national park in the 1970s but the proposal was thought to be administratively too difficult because the area was administered by 5 different <a href="/wiki/County_council" id="w">county councils</a>.</p>
<a id="Later_additions" name="Later_additions"></a><h2>Later additions</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/The_Broads" id="w">Broads</a> are not in the strictest sense a national park, being run by a separately constituted Broads Authority set up by a special <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Parliament" id="w">Act of Parliament</a> in 1988<sup id="_ref-UKNPhistory_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UKNPhistory" title="">[2]</a></sup> and that the conservation is subordinate to navigational concerns (see Sandford Principle below) but it is generally regarded as being &#34;equivalent to&#34; a national park.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/New_Forest" id="w">New Forest</a> was designated as a national park on <a href="/wiki/March_1" id="w">March 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>.<sup id="_ref-NFfaq_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NFfaq" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>A further national park in the <a href="/wiki/South_Downs" id="w">South Downs</a> is proposed, and received support from the government in September 1999. The South Downs is the last of the 12 areas chosen in the 1947 Hobhouse Report which has yet to become a national park. As of February 2005, a <a href="/wiki/Public_inquiry" id="w">public inquiry</a> is being held to decide the boundaries of the proposed national park.

<a id="Organisation" name="Organisation"></a><h1>Organisation</h1>
<p>Since April 1997, following the <a href="/wiki/Environment_Act_1995" id="w">Environment Act 1995</a>, each national park has been managed by its own National Park Authority.<sup id="_ref-UKNPhistory_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UKNPhistory" title="">[2]</a></sup> Previously, all but the <a href="/wiki/Peak_District" id="w">Peak District</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Lake_District" id="w">Lake District</a> were governed by the local <a href="/wiki/County_council" id="w">county councils</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Peak_District" id="w">Peak District</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Lake_District" id="w">Lake District</a>, the first two national parks to be designated, were under the control of Planning Boards that were independent of the local county councils.</p>
<p>Each Authority is required to carry out two &#34;statutory purposes&#34;:<sup id="_ref-natparks_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-natparks" title="">[1]</a></sup>
</p>
<ol>
<li>to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area; and</li>
<li>to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the parks&#39; special qualities by the public.</li></ol>
<p>These purposes can conflict: in such cases, under the &#39;<a href="/wiki/Sandford_Principle" id="w">Sandford Principle</a>&#39;, conservation comes first. This principle was given <a href="/wiki/Statute" id="w">statutory</a> force by section 62 of the Environment Act 1995. In pursuing these purposes, National Park Authorities also have a duty to foster the social and economic well-being of their local communities.</p>
<p>Slightly over half the members of each National Park Authority are appointees from the Principal Local Authorities covered by the park; the remainder are appointed by the <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Environment%2C_Food_and_Rural_Affairs" id="w">Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a>, some to represent local <a href="/wiki/Civil_parish" id="w">parish councils</a>, others selected to represent the &#34;national interest&#34;.<sup id="_ref-natparks_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-natparks" title="">[1]</a></sup> The Broads Authority also has members appointed by the <a href="/wiki/Countryside_Agency" id="w">Countryside Agency</a>, <a href="/wiki/English_Nature" id="w">English Nature</a>, <a href="/wiki/Great_Yarmouth" id="w">Great Yarmouth</a> Port Authority and the <a href="/wiki/Environment_Agency" id="w">Environment Agency</a>. The National Park and Broad Authorities are covered by similar regulatory controls to those applied to local councils.</p>
<p>Funding for national parks is complex, but essentially the full cost of each Park Authority is funded from central government funds. In the past this was partly paid for by local authorities, and refunded to them from the government to varying degrees. In 2003/2004, the Park Authorities received around £35.5 million of central government funding.</p>
<p>The Countryside Agency and the <a href="/wiki/Countryside_Council_for_Wales" id="w">Countryside Council for Wales</a> are the statutory bodies responsible for designating new national parks, subject to approval by the Secretary of State. The <a href="/wiki/Association_of_National_Park_Authorities" id="w">Association of National Park Authorities</a> exists to provide the Park Authorities with a single voice when dealing with government and its agencies. The <a href="/wiki/Council_for_National_Parks" id="w">Council for National Parks</a> is a charity that works to protect and enhance the national parks of England and Wales.</p>
<a id="Planning_in_national_parks" name="Planning_in_national_parks"></a><h1>Planning in national parks</h1>
<p>National Park Authorities are strategic and local planning authorities for their areas. They are responsible for maintaining the <a href="/wiki/Local_Development_Framework" id="w">Local Development Framework</a> &#8212; the <a href="/wiki/Spatial_planning" id="w">spatial planning</a> guide for their area. They also grant planning consent for development, within the constraints of the Framework. This gives them very considerable direct control over residential and industrial development, and the design of buildings and other structures; as well as strategic matters such as mineral extraction. </p>
<p>The National Park Authorities&#39; planning powers vary only slightly from other authorities, but the policies and their interpretation are stricter than elsewhere. This is supported and encouraged by the Government who regard:

<a id="Conflicts_in_national_parks" name="Conflicts_in_national_parks"></a><h1>Conflicts in national parks</h1>
<p>The National Park Authorities have two roles: to conserve and enhance the park, and to promote its use by visitors. These two objectives cause frequent conflicts between the needs of different groups of people. It is estimated that the national parks of England and Wales receive 110 million visitors each year. Although recreation and tourism brings many benefits to an area, it also brings a number of problems. The national funding offered to National Park Authorities is partly in recognition of the extra difficulties created in dealing with these conflicts.
</p><dl><dt><b>Congestion of villages and beauty spots</b></dt><dd>Some of the most popular &#34;<a href="/wiki/Honeypot_(geography)" id="w">honeypot</a>&#34; areas attract large numbers of visitors, resulting in overcrowded <a href="/wiki/Car_park" id="w">car parks</a>, blocked roads, and overstretched local facilities, particularly on Sundays in the summer and on <a href="/wiki/Bank_holiday" id="w">bank holidays</a>. Examples include the areas near <a href="/wiki/Keswick%2C_Cumbria" id="w">Keswick</a> in the Lake District and <a href="/wiki/Buxton" id="w">Buxton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bakewell" id="w">Bakewell</a> in the Peak District.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>Erosion</b></dt><dd>Walking and use of other public <a href="/wiki/Rights_of_way_in_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">rights-of-way</a> is an extremely popular use of all the national parks. Heavy use of the most popular paths leads to considerable erosion, but strengthening of paths can be unsightly. Particularly heavy wear is caused by sponsored walks, walks promoted by national books and magazines, by horse riding on unsurfaced <a href="/wiki/Bridleway" id="w">bridleways</a>, and use of off-road vehicles on <a href="/wiki/Green_lane" id="w">green lanes</a>. Examples include <a href="/wiki/Dovedale" id="w">Dovedale</a> in the Peak District. <a href="/wiki/Over-grazing" id="w">Over-grazing</a>, for example, by sheep on hill and moorland areas, can also reduce vegetation, leading to increased erosion.</dd></dl><dl><dt><b>Damage and disturbance to wildlife</b></dt><dd><a href="/wiki/Wildlife" id="w">Wildlife</a> may be disturbed by the level of use on some of the areas of the parks that are open to the public. <a href="/wiki/Moorland" id="w">Moorland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chalk_downland" id="w">chalk downland</a> is easily damaged by regular use, and takes many years to recover.

In some villages where tourist shops are in the majority and there are few shops catering for the local people, the local community may feel pushed out by the tourists. Houses are often very expensive in tourist villages as there is demand for them as <a href="/wiki/Second_home" id="w">second homes</a> or <a href="/wiki/Holiday_home" id="w">holiday homes</a> by <a href="/wiki/Holiday_cottage" id="w">holiday cottage</a> firms or well-off people who live elsewhere, or who move to a local home from which they commute to work, making them unaffordable for local people.
