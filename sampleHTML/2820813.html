''The Land That Time Forgot'' is a 1975 fantasy/adventure film based upon the 1918 novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The adapted screenplay was created by Michael Moorcock. The film was produced by Britain's Amicus Productions and directed by Kevin Connor. The cast included Doug McClure and Keith Barron.The story is set in World War I and involves the survivors of the sinking of a British merchant ship who are taken on board a German U-boat and travel to a fantastical land where dinosaurs still roam.

The film was a sleeper hit and inspired Amicus to make two more Burroughs adaptations, ''At the Earth's Core'' (1976), with McClure, Peter Cushing, and Caroline Munro, and ''The People That Time Forgot'' (1977), a direct sequel to ''Land'' starring Patrick Wayne, Sarah Douglas, and McClure in a cameo appearance. All three films were distributed in the United States by American International Pictures.
