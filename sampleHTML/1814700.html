<p>An <b>intelligent designer</b>, also referred to as an <b>intelligent agent</b>, is the willed and self-conscious entity that the <a href="/wiki/Intelligent_design_movement" id="w">intelligent design movement</a> argues had some role in the <a href="/wiki/Origin_of_life" id="w">origin</a> and/or development of life and who supposedly has left scientific evidence of this <a href="/wiki/Intelligent_design" id="w">intelligent design</a>. They also use the term &#34;intelligent cause&#34; implying their <a href="/wiki/Teleology" id="w">teleological</a> supposition of direction and purpose in features of the universe and of living things.
The intelligent design movement is a <a href="/wiki/Neo-creationist" id="w">neo-creationist</a> campaign that arose out of the previous <a href="/wiki/Christian_fundamentalism" id="w">Christian fundamentalist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Evangelism" id="w">evangelistic</a> <a href="/wiki/Creation_science" id="w">creation science</a> movement.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Proponents of <a href="/wiki/Intelligent_design" id="w">intelligent design</a> argue to the public that their concept does not posit the identity of the designer as part of this effort. But in statements to their constituency, which consists largely of <a href="/wiki/Christian_right" id="w">Christian conservatives</a>, they identify the designer as <a href="/wiki/God#Biblical definition of God" id="w">God</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-debate_won_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-debate_won" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dembski_logos_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dembski_logos" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ruling_context_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ruling_context" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/William_Dembski" id="w">William Dembski</a> states in his book <i><a href="/wiki/Design_Inference" id="w">Design Inference</a></i> that the nature of the intelligent designer cannot be inferred from intelligent design. All leading intelligent design proponents have stated identifying or characterizing the designer is beyond the scope of intelligent design as a line of inquiry. Proponents had hoped that, by avoiding invoking <a href="/wiki/Creation_(theology)" id="w">creation</a> by a specific supernatural entity, (such as that employed by <a href="/wiki/Creation_science" id="w">creation science</a>), intelligent design would be considered scientific and not violate the <a href="/wiki/Establishment_clause" id="w">establishment clause</a> of the <a href="/wiki/US_constitution" id="w">US constitution</a>. Proponents feared that were intelligent design identified as a restatement of previous forms of creationism, it would be precluded from being taught in public schools after the <a href="/wiki/1987" id="w">1987</a> <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" id="w">Supreme Court of the United States</a> decision in <i><a href="/wiki/Edwards_vs_Aguillard" id="w">Edwards vs Aguillard</a></i>. This line of reasoning was not particularly persuasive to many in the scientific community, which largely rejected intelligent design as both a line of scientific inquiry and as a basis for a sound education in science.</p>
<p>On December 20, 2005 <a href="/wiki/United_States_federal_courts" id="w">federal district court</a> ruled  in <a href="/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District" id="w">Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</a> that intelligent design was not science and was essentially religious in nature. The ruling not only rendered that public school district&#39;s requirement endorsing intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in science classes unconstitutional
on the grounds that its inclusion violates the <a href="/wiki/Establishment_Clause" id="w">Establishment Clause</a> of the <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">First Amendment</a>, but validated the objections of critics who discounted proponent&#39;s claim that the identity was not God.</p>
<p>Highlighting these mutually exclusive claims about the designer, Dembski, despite having said that the intelligent designer or designers could be any <a href="/wiki/Deity" id="w">god</a> or gods, or even <a href="/wiki/Space_alien" id="w">space aliens</a>, has also said that &#34;intelligent design should be understood as the evidence that God has placed in nature to show that the physical world is the product of intelligence and not simply the result of mindless material forces&#34;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> and that &#34;Intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John&#39;s Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory.&#34;<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Michael_Behe" id="w">Michael Behe</a>, in his book <a href="/wiki/Darwin%26%2339%3Bs_Black_Box" id="w">Darwin&#39;s Black Box</a>, suggested the designer might be a <a href="/wiki/Time_travel" id="w">time traveling</a> cell biologist, apparently ignoring that such a hypothesis results in a <a href="/wiki/Grandfather_paradox" id="w">grandfather paradox</a>.</p>
<p>At various times each of the leading proponents in the intelligent design movement have clearly expressed that they consider the <a href="/wiki/Abrahamic_God" id="w">Abrahamic God</a> <a href="/wiki/Elohim" id="w">Elohim</a> in his role as a <a href="/wiki/Creator_God" id="w">creator God</a>, to be the intelligent designer and denied that intelligent designer is God, depending on which audience they are addressing. On example is William Dembski, who on his blog in response to the question &#34;Is the designer responsible for biological complexity God?&#34; said &#34;not necessarily&#34; and &#34;To ask who or what is the designer of a particular object is to ask for the immediate intelligent agent responsible for its design. The point is that God is able to work through derived or surrogate intelligences, which can be anything from angels to organizing principles embedded in nature.&#34;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Yet to the intelligent design movement&#39;s conservative Christian constituents Dembski has said &#34;intelligent design should be understood as the evidence that God has placed in nature to show that the physical world is the product of intelligence and not simply the result of mindless material forces. This evidence is available to all apart from the special revelation of God in salvation history as recounted in Scripture. ... Intelligent design makes it impossible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. This gives intelligent design incredible traction as a tool for apologetics, opening up the God-question to individuals who think that science has buried God&#34;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> and &#34;Thus, in its relation to Christianity, intelligent design should be viewed as a ground-clearing operation that gets rid of the intellectual rubbish that for generations has kept Christianity from receiving serious consideration.&#34;<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Stephen_C._Meyer" id="w">Stephen C.

<p>In addition, the intelligent movement seeks as a well-documented agenda the overall goal &#34;to defeat materialism&#34; and the &#34;materialist world view&#34; as represented by evolution, and replace it with &#34;a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.&#34;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Phillip_E._Johnson" id="w">Phillip E.

<p>Opinion as to the amount of creation the intelligent designer has done varies within the ID movement.  <a href="/wiki/Michael_Behe" id="w">Michael Behe</a>&#39;s concept of <a href="/wiki/Irreducible_complexity" id="w">irreducible complexity</a> has <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" id="w">natural selection</a> accounting for most of <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolution</a> but the intelligent designer contributing the design of some <a href="/wiki/Protein" id="w">proteins</a>.

Though most in the ID movement seem to be <a href="/wiki/Old_Earth_Creationist" id="w">Old Earth Creationists</a>, a few are <a href="/wiki/Young_Earth_Creationist" id="w">Young Earth Creationists</a> who believe in <a href="/wiki/Ex-nihilo" id="w">ex-nihilo</a>.</p>
<p>The amount of creation that the intelligent designer did has also been criticised by <a href="/wiki/Young_Earth_Creationist" id="w">Young Earth Creationists</a> as not being specific enough, and particularly contradicting their beliefs of <a href="/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy" id="w">Biblical inerrancy</a> and a young earth. <sup id="_ref-aig_views_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aig_views" title="">[15]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-morris_design_not_enough_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-morris_design_not_enough" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some intelligent design proponents say the intelligent designer <a href="/wiki/Fine-tuned_universe" id="w">fine-tuned the universe&#39;s</a> <a href="/wiki/Physical_constant" id="w">physical constants</a> in such a way that life is the result of the universe&#39;s physical constants being related to one another in a fashion that permits life to exist. The <a href="/wiki/Fine-tuned_universe" id="w">fine-tuned universe argument</a> is a central premise or presented as a given in many of the published works of prominent intelligent design proponents, such as <a href="/wiki/William_A._Dembski" id="w">William A. Dembski</a> and <a href="/wiki/Michael_Behe" id="w">Michael Behe</a>.</p>
<a id="Criticism" name="Criticism"></a><h1> Criticism </h1>

<p>Intelligent design has been presented by its proponents as a &#34;big tent&#34; strategy into which several accounts of creation can fit. Were a scientific version of intelligent design approved for inclusion in public school science curricula, then a path would be opened for discussion of alternatives to not only <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" id="w">natural selection</a> but <a href="/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)" id="w">naturalism</a> as well, and eventually religious accounts on the <a href="/wiki/Origin_of_life" id="w">origin of life</a>.  The vast majority of scientists reject the concept of intelligent design and an intelligent designer. Instead, the most widely accepted explanation is that physical processes such as natural selection can account for the complexity of life and other phenomena and features of the universe. Attempts to insert theories of intelligent design into public school science curricula fits in with the intelligent design movement&#39;s social aims, via the overturning of Western secularism as detailed in the <a href="/wiki/Wedge_strategy" id="w">Wedge strategy</a>. The concept of the intelligent designer has been criticised as a <a href="/wiki/God_of_the_gaps#The &#34;God-of-the-gaps argument&#34; in modern usage" id="w">God-of-the-gaps</a> argument. Introducing the hypothesis of an intelligent designer introduces the unsolved problem of accounting for the origin of such a designer (<a href="/wiki/First_cause" id="w">first cause</a>).</p>
<p>By raising the question of the need for a designer for objects with irreducible complexity, intelligent design also raises the question, &#34;what designed the designer?&#34;  <a href="/wiki/Richard_Dawkins" id="w">Richard Dawkins</a> has argued that &#34;If complex organisms demand an explanation, so does a complex designer. And it&#39;s no solution to raise the theologian&#39;s plea that God (or the intelligent designer) is simply immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation,&#34;<sup id="_ref-dawkins_complexdesigner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dawkins_complexdesigner" title="">[17]</a></sup> since such an answer would be unscientific.  With religious creationism, the question &#34;what created God?&#34; can be answered with theological arguments, but in intelligent design, the chain of designers can be followed back indefinitely in an <a href="/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down" id="w">infinite regression</a>, leaving the question of the creation of the first designer dangling. As a result, intelligent design does not explain how the complexity happened in the first place; it just moves it.<sup id="_ref-dawkins_time_2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dawkins_time_2" title="">[18]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Elliott_Sober" id="w">Elliott Sober</a> says that by intelligent design&#39;s own arguments, a designer capable of creating irreducible complexity must also be irreducibly complex: &#34;Any mind in nature that designs and builds an irreducibly complex system is itself irreducibly complex&#34;<sup id="_ref-sober_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sober" title="">[19]</a></sup> Sober says that this an argument that intelligent design proponents still need to respond to.</p>
<p>If intelligent design proponents invoke an <a href="/wiki/Uncaused_causer" id="w">uncaused causer</a> or <a href="/wiki/Deity" id="w">deity</a> to resolve this problem,<sup id="_ref-wdd2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wdd2" title="">[20]</a></sup> they contradict a fundamental assumption of intelligent design that design requires a designer<sup id="_ref-fundamental_assumption_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fundamental_assumption" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-sc_indicates_design_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sc_indicates_design" title="">[22]</a></sup> and reduce intelligent design to religious creationism.  Another possible counter-argument might be an <a href="/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down" id="w">infinite regression</a> of designers. However, admitting infinite numbers of objects also allows any arbitrarily improbable event to occur <sup id="_ref-arbitrarily_improbable_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-arbitrarily_improbable" title="">[23]</a></sup>, such as an object with &#34;specific&#34; complexity assembling itself by chance. Again, this contradicts a fundamental assumption of intelligent design that a designer is needed for every specifically complex object, producing a logical contradiction.</p>
<p>Critics contend the claim that positing a designer which explains gaps in our understanding yet does not need to be itself explained as not a contribution to knowledge but as a <a href="/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9" id="w">thought-terminating cliché</a>.<sup id="_ref-Rosenhouse_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rosenhouse" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_Dover_trial" name="The_Dover_trial"></a><h1>The Dover trial</h1>

<p>In 2005, intelligent design proponents arguments regarding the identity of a designer became an issue considered by the court in <a href="/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District" id="w">Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</a>, the &#34;Dover trial,&#34; where plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy requiring the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolution</a> as an &#34;explanation of the origin of life&#34; thus violated the <a href="/wiki/Establishment_Clause" id="w">Establishment Clause</a> of the <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">First Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>. In his ruling, the judge stated

<p>Jones also commented that the appearance of design is <a href="/wiki/Subjectivity" id="w">subjective</a>,

When I preach from the Bible, as I often do at churches and on Sundays, I don&#39;t start with Genesis. I start with John 1:1. In the beginning was the word.

However, as Dr. Haught testified, anyone familiar with Western religious thought would immediately make the association that the tactically unnamed designer is God, as the description of the designer in Of Pandas and People (hereinafter &#34;Pandas&#34;) is a &#34;master intellect,&#34; strongly suggesting a supernatural deity as opposed to any intelligent actor known to exist in the natural world. (P-11 at 85). Moreover, it is notable that both Professors Behe and Minnich admitted their personal view is that the designer is God and Professor Minnich testified that he understands many leading advocates of ID to believe the designer to be God. (21:90 (Behe); 38:36-38 (Minnich)). Although proponents of the IDM occasionally suggest that the designer could be a space alien or a time-traveling cell biologist, no serious alternative to God as the designer has been proposed by members of the IDM, including Defendants&#39; expert witnesses. (20:102-03 (Behe)). In fact, an explicit concession that the intelligent designer works outside the laws of nature and science and a direct reference to religion is Pandas’ rhetorical statement, &#34;what kind of intelligent agent was it [the designer]&#34; and answer: &#34;On its own science cannot answer this question. It must leave it to religion and philosophy.&#34; (P-11 at 7; 9:13-14 (Haught)). A significant aspect of the IDM is that despite Defendants&#39; protestations to the contrary, it describes ID as a religious argument. In that vein, the writings of leading ID proponents reveal that the designer postulated by their argument is the God of Christianity.&#34; <a href="http://sources.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/2:Context">Dover trial ruling: Context</a> <a href="/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District" id="w">Kitzmiller v.
