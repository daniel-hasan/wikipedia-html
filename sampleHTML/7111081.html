The <b>Victoria Cross for New Zealand</b> (<b>VC</b>) is a <a href="/wiki/Military_decoration" id="w">military decoration</a> awarded for valour &#34;in the face of the enemy&#34; to members of the <a href="/wiki/Military_of_New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand Armed Forces</a>. It may be awarded to a person of any <a href="/wiki/Military_rank" id="w">rank</a> in any service and civilians under military command, and is presented to the recipient by the <a href="/wiki/Governor-General_of_New_Zealand" id="w">Governor-General of New Zealand</a> during an investiture held at <a href="/wiki/Government_House%2C_Wellington" id="w">Government House, Wellington</a>. As the highest award for gallantry in New Zealand it takes precedence over other <a href="/wiki/Post-nominal_letters" id="w">postnominals</a> and medals.<sup id="_ref-Modclub_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Modclub" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The original VC was introduced in <a href="/wiki/1856" id="w">1856</a> by <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Victoria</a> to reward acts of valour during the <a href="/wiki/Crimean_War" id="w">Crimean War</a>. The Victoria Cross for New Zealand was established in 1999 and, as of July 2007, has been awarded only once. The original medal had been awarded 23 times to 22 individual New Zealand military personnel; New Zealander <a href="/wiki/Charles_Upham" id="w">Captain Charles Upham</a> receiving a <a href="/wiki/Medal_bar" id="w">bar</a>. Only 14 medals have been awarded since the end of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">Second World War</a>. The medal itself is made from the <a href="/wiki/Gunmetal" id="w">gunmetal</a> of a weapon supposedly captured at the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1854-1855)" id="w">siege of Sevastopol</a>, but several historians have since questioned the true origin of the gunmetal.<sup id="_ref-Glanfield_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glanfield" title="">[2]</a></sup> Due to its rarity, the VC is highly prized and the medal has been sold for over <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" id="w">£200</a>,000 at auction. Originally all <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth</a> personnel were issued with the same award, but in the last 50 years, three countries have introduced separate award systems. New Zealand created a new award system that replaced several Commonwealth Honours with separate awards.</p>

<p>{{Details}}</p>
<p>The original <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Cross" id="w">Victoria Cross</a> was created by Royal warrant by <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Victoria</a> in 1856. It was created to recognise incidents of gallantry that were unconnected with a man&#39;s lengthy or meritorious service. Queen Victoria signed a Royal Warrant on <a href="/wiki/29_January" id="w">29 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1856" id="w">1856</a> that officially recognised the VC.<sup id="_ref-Ashcroft_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ashcroft" title="">[3]</a></sup> The order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the <a href="/wiki/Crimean_War" id="w">Crimean War</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Australian and New Zealand Victoria Crosses are made from the same gunmetal as the originals.<sup id="_ref-nzgovdept_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nzgovdept" title="">[5]</a></sup> It was originally intended that the VCs would be cast from the <a href="/wiki/Bronze" id="w">bronze</a> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Cascabel">cascabels</a> of two <a href="/wiki/Cannon" id="w">cannons</a> that were captured from the <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russians</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1854-1855)" id="w">siege of Sevastopol</a>.<sup id="_ref-beharry359_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beharry359" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Navalmuseum_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Navalmuseum" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The historian John Glanfield has since proven through the use of X-Rays of older Victoria Crosses that the metal used for VCs is in fact from antique Chinese guns and not of Russian origin.<sup id="_ref-Glanfield_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Glanfield" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Navalmuseum_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Navalmuseum" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The barrels of the cannon in question are stationed outside the Officers&#39; Mess at the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Artillery_Barracks" id="w">Royal Artillery Barracks</a> at <a href="/wiki/Woolwich" id="w">Woolwich</a>. The remaining portion of the only remaining cascabel, weighing 10&#160;kilograms (385&#160;oz), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment <a href="/wiki/Royal_Logistic_Corps" id="w">Royal Logistic Corps</a> at <a href="/wiki/Donnington%2C_Telford" id="w">Donnington, Telford</a>. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, Hancocks of London, has been responsible for the production of every VC awarded since its inception.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Separate_Commonwealth_awards" name="Separate_Commonwealth_awards"></a><h3>Separate Commonwealth awards</h3>
<p>In the last 20 years several <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth</a> countries have introduced their own honours systems, separate from the <a href="/wiki/British_Honours_System" id="w">British Honours System</a>. <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a><sup id="_ref-nzgovdept_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nzgovdept" title="">[5]</a></sup> have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the <a href="/wiki/Military_Cross" id="w">Military Cross</a> with their own awards. Most Commonwealth countries, however, still recognise some form of the VC as their highest decoration for valour.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Australia was the first Commonwealth nation to create its own VC, on <a href="/wiki/15_January" id="w">15 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a>. Although it is a separate award, its appearance is identical to its British counterpart.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Canada followed suit when in 1993 Queen Elizabeth signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian VC, which is also similar to the British version, except that the legend has been changed from <small>FOR VALOUR</small> to the <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> <small>PRO VALORE</small>.<sup id="_ref-CTVVChist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CTVVChist" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>New Zealand was the third country to create the VC as part of its own honours system.<sup id="_ref-nzgovdept_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nzgovdept" title="">[5]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/21_September" id="w">21 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a>, it was announced by the then Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Jenny_Shipley" id="w">Ms Shipley</a> that the Queen had approved the formal institution of a <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand_gallantry_awards" id="w">new range of Royal awards</a> to recognise acts of gallantry and bravery performed by New Zealanders. The awards were designed to be the final major element in the development of a distinct New Zealand Royal honours system.</p>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>The start of the process came with proposals released in 1995 by the <i>Honours Advisory Committee</i> that reviewed the honours system. Until May 1996, New Zealand made recommendations for various British awards for acts of gallantry performed during military operations and acts of bravery by civilians including the <a href="/wiki/Victoria_Cross" id="w">Victoria Cross</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_Cross" id="w">George Cross</a>. However, the British Government&#39;s review and simplification of their awards system provided an ideal opportunity for New Zealand to also develop a unique and simplified system.<sup id="_ref-gallawrdsPR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gallawrdsPR" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Appearance" name="Appearance"></a><h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>The Victoria Cross for New Zealand is identical to the original design. The decoration is a <a href="/wiki/Cross_patt%C3%A9e" id="w">cross pattée</a>, 41&#160;millimetres high, 36&#160;millimetres wide, bearing a crown surmounted by a lion, and the inscription <small>FOR VALOUR</small>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> This was originally to have been <small>FOR BRAVERY</small>, until it was changed on the recommendation of <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Victoria</a>, who thought some might erroneously consider that only the recipients of the VC were brave in battle.<sup id="_ref-Navalmuseum_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Navalmuseum" title="">[7]</a></sup> The decoration, suspension bar and link weigh about 27&#160;grams (0.87&#160;<a href="/wiki/Troy_ounce" id="w">troy ounces</a>).<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>The cross is suspended by a ring from a <a href="/wiki/Serif" id="w">seriffed</a> &#34;V&#34; to a bar ornamented with laurel leaves, through which the ribbon passes.  The reverse of the suspension bar is engraved with the recipient&#39;s name, rank, number and unit. On the reverse of the medal is a circular panel on which the date of the act for which it was awarded is engraved in the centre.<sup id="_ref-vvaa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vvaa" title="">[17]</a></sup> The ribbon is crimson, 38&#160;millimetres (1.5 inches) wide. Although the warrants state the colour as being red it is defined by most commentators as being crimson or &#34;wine-red&#34;.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

The Royal Warrant states that the &#34;Awards of a New Zealand Gallantry Award and of a Bar to an Award shall be made by Us, Our Heirs and Successors, only on a recommendation by Our Prime Minister of New Zealand or a Minister of the Crown acting for Our Prime Minister.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Warrant_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Warrant" title="">[19]</a></sup> As with the original Victoria Cross any recommendations will pass through the <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand_Defence_Force" id="w">military hierarchy</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Defence_(New_Zealand)" id="w">Minister for Defence</a>.<sup id="_ref-Govrefpack_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Govrefpack" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>The original Victoria Cross had been awarded to <a href="/wiki/List_of_New_Zealander_Victoria_Cross_recipients" id="w">21 New Zealanders</a>.

As of <a href="/wiki/2_July" id="w">2 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, the Victoria Cross for New Zealand has been awarded only once. It was announced <sup id="_ref-fullcitation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fullcitation" title="">[21]</a></sup> that Corporal <a href="/wiki/Bill_Apiata" id="w">Bill (Willie) Apiata</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Special_Air_Service_of_New_Zealand" id="w">NZ SAS</a> was awarded the Victoria Cross for New Zealand for his actions in saving the life of a &#34;comrade under heavy fire from opposing forces&#34; during the Afghanistan conflict in 2004.<sup id="_ref-PressRelease_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PressRelease" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Govrefpack_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Govrefpack" title="">[20]</a></sup> Bill Apiata received his medal from <a href="/wiki/Governor-General_of_New_Zealand" id="w">Governor-General</a> <a href="/wiki/Anand_Satyanand" id="w">Anand Satyanand</a> with the approval of the Queen at a ceremony held at <a href="/wiki/Government_House%2C_Wellington" id="w">Government House, Wellington</a> on <a href="/wiki/26_July" id="w">26 July</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>. <sup id="_ref-VCreceived_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VCreceived" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
