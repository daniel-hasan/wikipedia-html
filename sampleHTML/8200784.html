<p><b><i>Beyond Fantasy Fiction</i></b> was a US <a href="/wiki/Fantasy_fiction_magazine" id="w">fantasy fiction magazine</a> edited by <a href="/wiki/H._L._Gold" id="w">H. L. Gold</a>, of which only ten issues were published, from 1953 to 1955.  Although not a commercial success, it included several significant short stories by distinguished authors, such as <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" id="w">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ray_Bradbury" id="w">Ray Bradbury</a> and <a href="/wiki/Philip_K._Dick" id="w">Philip K. Dick</a>.<sup id="_ref-BFF_DA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BFF_DA" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The publication has been described by critics as a successor to the tradition of <i><a href="/wiki/Unknown_(magazine)" id="w">Unknown</a></i>, a fantasy magazine that folded in 1943 and was noted for printing fantasy with a rational basis, such as stories about werewolves with a scientific explanation. A selection of stories from <i>Beyond</i> was published in paperback form in 1963, also under the title <i>Beyond</i>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/James_Gunn_(author)" id="w">James Gunn</a>, a historian of science fiction, regarded the magazine as the best of the fantasy magazines launched in the early 1950s, and science fiction encyclopediast <a href="/wiki/Donald_H._Tuck" id="w">Donald H. Tuck</a> felt it printed very good material.  Not every critic felt <i>Beyond</i> was completely successful, however; <a href="/wiki/P._Schuyler_Miller" id="w">P. Schuyler Miller</a>, in a 1963 review, commented that the stories were most successful when they did not try to emulate <i>Unknown</i>.</p>

<p><i>Beyond Fantasy Fiction</i> was a fantasy-oriented companion to the more successful <i><a href="/wiki/Galaxy_Science_Fiction" id="w">Galaxy Science Fiction</a></i>, which launched in 1950; <i>Beyond</i> had been planned by editor H.&#160;L. Gold from the time <i>Galaxy</i> was launched, but had to wait until <i>Galaxy</i> was firmly established.<sup id="_ref-TM_65_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TM_65" title="">[2]</a></sup>  <i>Beyond<b>s first issue, dated July 1953, included an editorial by Gold in which he laid out the magazine&#39;s scope, excluding (in his words) only &#34;the probably possible&#34; and &#34;the unentertaining&#34;.<sup id="_ref-mag_Jul_53_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mag_Jul_53" title="">[3]</a></sup> Gold recruited <a href="/wiki/Sam_Merwin" id="w">Sam Merwin</a>, who had recently quit as editor of <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Universe" id="w">Fantastic Universe</a>,</i> to help in editing, though Gold was listed as editor on the masthead of both magazines.<sup id="_ref-TM_65_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TM_65" title="">[2]</a></sup>  A typical issue of <i>Beyond</i> included a couple of stories that were long enough to be listed as <a href="/wiki/Novella" id="w">novellas</a> or <a href="/wiki/Novelette" id="w">novelettes</a>, with the contents filled out with shorter works, usually for a total of at least seven stories.<sup id="_ref-isfdb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-isfdb" title="">[4]</a></sup> </b></i></p>
<p>The first issue featured <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Sturgeon" id="w">Theodore Sturgeon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Damon_Knight" id="w">Damon Knight</a> and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Matheson" id="w">Richard Matheson</a>.

 of the ten covers were <a href="/wiki/Surrealism" id="w">surrealist</a>, which was an unusual artistic choice for a genre magazine.  The cover painting for the first issue was by <a href="/wiki/Richard_M._Powers" id="w">Richard M. Powers</a>; Gold was one of the very few American magazine editors to use his work, though Powers was prolific in the paperbacks.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  In addition to Powers, René Vidmer and Arthur Krusz (among others) contributed cover art.  The magazine carried interior artwork, usually multiple illustrations, for almost every story; and in addition, each story included a facsimile of the author&#39;s signature, set at the end of the text.  The best-known interior artist <i>Beyond</i> used was <a href="/wiki/Ed_Emshwiller" id="w">Ed Emshwiller</a>, though there were several other regulars.  The magazine carried almost no non-fiction, though there were occasional &#34;filler&#34; pieces to fill spaces at the end of stories.<sup id="_ref-BFF_54_1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BFF_54_1" title="">[6]</a></sup>  There were no book reviews, and only the first issue carried an editorial.<sup id="_ref-isfdb_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-isfdb" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The magazine was not commercially successful: at that time circulation figures were not required to be published annually, as they were later,<sup id="_ref-ASF_1965_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ASF_1965" title="">[7]</a></sup> so the actual circulation figures are not known. It lasted less than two years, its demise caused in part by the decreasing popularity of fantasy and horror fiction.<sup id="_ref-TM_65_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TM_65" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Bibliographic_details" name="Bibliographic_details"></a><h1>Bibliographic details</h1>
<p>The publisher was Galaxy Publishing Corporation, New York.  The magazine was initially titled <i>Beyond Fantasy Fiction</i>, and this remained the title on the masthead throughout the ten-issue run.  However, issue 9 changed the title to simply <i>Beyond Fiction</i> on the cover, spine, and table of contents.  Issue 10 used the new, shorter title on the cover and spine, but reverted to <i>Beyond Fantasy Fiction</i> for the table of contents.<sup id="_ref-mags_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mags" title="">[14]</a></sup>  As a result the magazine is often listed as having changed its name for the last two issues.<sup id="_ref-isfdb-tuck_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-isfdb-tuck" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The magazine began as a 160-page <a href="/wiki/Digest_size" id="w">digest</a>, priced at 35 cents.  The price stayed the same throughout the run, but the page count was cut to 128 for the eighth issue, September 1954.  The magazine was bimonthly, but issues 9 and 10 did not carry month and year dates, which has led different bibliographers to catalogue them in different ways.  However, the masthead for these issues indicates that the magazine remained bimonthly, and so they are now usually catalogued as November 1954 and January 1955, respectively; the copyright dates on the last two issues correspond to these dates.  The volume numbering was completely regular; volume 1 had six numbers, and volume 2 ceased with its fourth number.<sup id="_ref-isfdb-tuck_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-isfdb-tuck" title="">[15]</a></sup>  The stories were printed in the two-column format usual to digest magazines.<sup id="_ref-mags_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mags" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>A British edition of the magazine ran for four issues on a bimonthly schedule starting in November 1953 and finishing in May 1954.  These copied the first four issues of the US version, with slightly cut contents. They were numbered 1 to 4 but were not dated.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  Ten years after the magazine folded, nine stories from <i>Beyond</i> were collected into the 160-page paperback <i>Beyond</i>, published in 1963 by <a href="/wiki/Berkley_Books" id="w">Berkley Books</a> (F712) and edited by Thomas Dardis (who was not credited on the book).<sup id="_ref-Clute_Grant_2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Clute_Grant_2" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
