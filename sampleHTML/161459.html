<b>James Philip Milner</b> (born <a href="/wiki/4_January" id="w">4 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1986" id="w">1986</a>) is an <a href="/wiki/English_people" id="w">English</a> <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">footballer</a> who plays as a <a href="/wiki/Winger_(sport)" id="w">winger</a> and left-sided <a href="/wiki/Midfielder" id="w">midfielder</a> for the English club <a href="/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C." id="w">Newcastle United</a>. </p>
<p>As a child, Milner&#39;s talent in football, <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricket</a> and <a href="/wiki/Long-distance_track_event" id="w">long-distance running</a> was recognised. He represented his school in these sports and played football for amateur teams from <a href="/wiki/Rawdon%2C_West_Yorkshire" id="w">Rawdon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Horsforth" id="w">Horsforth</a>. He supported <a href="/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C." id="w">Leeds United</a> from a young age and was a <a href="/wiki/Season_ticket" id="w">season ticket</a> holder at the club.</p>
<p>Milner began his career at Leeds United by joining the club&#39;s academy in 1996; he was later taken on as a trainee. Milner made his inaugural appearance for the first-team in 2002, aged only 16, and gained prominence as the youngest player to score in the <a href="/wiki/Premier_League" id="w">Premier League</a>. </p>
<p>While at Leeds United, Milner spent time on loan at <a href="/wiki/Swindon_Town_F.C." id="w">Swindon Town</a> to gain experience as a first-team player. Following his move to Newcastle United, he was loaned to <a href="/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C." id="w">Aston Villa</a> for a season. He has since established himself as a regular starter in the Newcastle first team. His main role on the team is to create scoring opportunities. He has now made more than 100 appearances for Newcastle, as well as making a record number of appearances for the <a href="/wiki/England_national_under-21_football_team" id="w">England under-21</a> side.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Born in <a href="/wiki/Wortley%2C_West_Yorkshire" id="w">Wortley</a> and raised in <a href="/wiki/Horsforth" id="w">Horsforth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Leeds" id="w">Leeds</a>, Milner played most of his football in his childhood for Westbrook School in Horsforth. Graeme Coulson, a coach from <a href="/wiki/Rawdon%2C_West_Yorkshire" id="w">Rawdon</a>, recognised Milner&#39;s talent and persuaded him to play for Rawdon in several tournaments, including a presitigious one in Rawdon Meadows, according to Coulson; in Rawdon&#39;s victory in the final, Milner scored four goals.<sup id="_ref-Milner child_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milner child" title="">[1]</a></sup>
{{Quote_box}}</p>
<p>Milner was described as a &#34;first class&#34; student at his school; he left with 11 <a href="/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education" id="w">GCSEs</a> and an award for his performance in <a href="/wiki/Physical_education_class" id="w">physical education</a>.<sup id="_ref-Milner child_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milner child" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Sunday Telegraph_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sunday Telegraph" title="">[2]</a></sup> Milner also showed talent in <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricket</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sprint_(race)" id="w">sprinting</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cross_country_running" id="w">long-distance running</a>. He played for the Yorkshire Schools cricket team, was the cross-country champion at his school for three consecutive years and was the district champion over 100&#160;metres for two years in row.<sup id="_ref-Milner child_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milner child" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Milner took as much interest in watching football as he did playing it. He supported the professional football club, <a href="/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C." id="w">Leeds United</a>, from a young age. His earliest memory of Leeds is of watching them win the <a href="/wiki/FA_Youth_Cup" id="w">FA Youth Cup</a> in 1993. He and his parents, Peter and Lesley, were Leeds United <a href="/wiki/Season_ticket" id="w">season ticket</a> holders; Milner even became a <a href="/wiki/Ballboy#Sport" id="w">ballboy</a> so he could get closer to the action.<sup id="_ref-findarticles_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findarticles" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Milner was 10 years old, he joined the Leeds United Academy after being spotted by a <a href="/wiki/Scout_(sport)" id="w">scout</a> while playing for <a href="/wiki/Horsforth#Education" id="w">Westbrook</a> Juniors in Horsforth.<sup id="_ref-Milner child_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milner child" title="">[1]</a></sup> At the academy, Milner played against contemporaries from other clubs in the north, including future <a href="/wiki/Manchester_United" id="w">Manchester United</a> striker <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Rooney" id="w">Wayne Rooney</a>. His role model was Leeds-born <a href="/wiki/Alan_Smith" id="w">Alan Smith</a>, who was then a Leeds striker. Milner believed playing with Smith put him through a learning curve, as Smith had done what Milner aspired to doâ€”to come through the academy and play for the first team.<sup id="_ref-findarticles_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findarticles" title="">[3]</a></sup> Having made good progress at the Academy, Milner was taken on as a trainee there after leaving school.<sup id="_ref-Milner child_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milner child" title="">[1]</a></sup> However, his father insisted that he attend college once a week to continue his education.<sup id="_ref-findarticles2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findarticles2" title="">[4]</a></sup> Milner remarked later that he did not want to get excited and think that he &#34;had already made it&#34;. He also said he could hardly believe he was playing alongside first-team Leeds players such as <a href="/wiki/David_Batty" id="w">David Batty</a> and <a href="/wiki/Olivier_Dacourt" id="w">Olivier Dacourt</a>.<sup id="_ref-Sunday Telegraph_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sunday Telegraph" title="">[2]</a></sup> He continued to improve his skills in the youth team, and played for the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_national_football_team" id="w">Republic of Ireland</a> at under-14 level and England at under-15 and -17 levels.<sup id="_ref-Milner child_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milner child" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> He helped the England under-17 team win the 2002 Nationwide summer tournament against <a href="/wiki/Italy_national_football_team" id="w">Italy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic_national_football_team" id="w">Czech Republic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team" id="w">Brazil</a>, scoring a goal against Brazil.<sup id="_ref-Under-17_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Under-17" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

Milner&#39;s debut for Leeds United came on <a href="/wiki/10_November" id="w">10 November</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a> in a game against <a href="/wiki/West_Ham_United" id="w">West Ham United</a>, when he came on as a <a href="/wiki/Substitute_(football)" id="w">substitute</a> for <a href="/wiki/Jason_Wilcox" id="w">Jason Wilcox</a> for the last six minutes. The appearance made him the second youngest player ever to play in the <a href="/wiki/Premier_League" id="w">Premier League</a>, at the age of 16 years and 309 days.<sup id="_ref-ESPN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ESPN" title="">[8]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/Boxing_Day" id="w">Boxing Day</a> of that year, he became the youngest player to score in the Premier League, with a goal in a 2&#8211;1 win against <a href="/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C." id="w">Sunderland</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> He celebrated both this and his debut with a &#34;quiet night in&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Sunday Telegraph_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sunday Telegraph" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In a match against <a href="/wiki/Chelsea_F.C." id="w">Chelsea</a> a month later, Milner scored again, using &#34;a beauti[ful]&#34; first touch of the ball to avoid a tackle from Chelsea defender, <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Desailly" id="w">Marcel Desailly</a>. This created a yard of space for him to deliver a shot that curled towards the goal from {{convert}} away.<sup id="_ref-Chelsea goal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chelsea goal" title="">[10]</a></sup> Reporters were impressed by his overall performance in the game, especially by his desire, confidence and ability with both feet. Chelsea manager <a href="/wiki/Claudio_Ranieri" id="w">Claudio Ranieri</a> said after the game that he had performed like a much more experienced player.<sup id="_ref-Chelsea2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chelsea2" title="">[11]</a></sup> The performance prompted comparisons to England internationals <a href="/wiki/Michael_Owen" id="w">Michael Owen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Rooney" id="w">Wayne Rooney</a>, who had also came to prominence as teenagers.<sup id="_ref-Chelsea_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chelsea" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a> even asked in a poll on their <a href="/wiki/Website" id="w">website</a> if he was a better prospect than Rooney.<sup id="_ref-Chelsea goal_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chelsea goal" title="">[10]</a></sup>

At the start of the <a href="/wiki/2003-04_in_English_football" id="w">2003&#8211;04 season</a>, Milner was sent on a month-long loan to <a href="/wiki/Football_League_One" id="w">Division Two</a> side <a href="/wiki/Swindon_Town_F.C." id="w">Swindon Town</a> to gain experience as a first-team player. Before the stint, he saw it as a valuable experience that would progress him as a player.<sup id="_ref-findarticles_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findarticles" title="">[3]</a></sup> He spent a month with Swindon, scoring two goals in six games. Milner also continued to develop on the international scene. He represented England at Under-20 level at the <a href="/wiki/2003_FIFA_World_Youth_Championship" id="w">2003 World Youth Championship</a>. Soon after this, Under-21 manager <a href="/wiki/Peter_Taylor_(footballer_born_1953)" id="w">Peter Taylor</a> called him up to the <a href="/wiki/England_national_under-21_football_team" id="w">England Under-21 side</a> and Milner made his debut for them against <a href="/wiki/Sweden_national_under-21_football_team" id="w">Sweden</a> on <a href="/wiki/30_March" id="w">30 March</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, Leeds United&#39;s fortunes were different as they struggled in the league. The team received a lot of negative attention from the media, and several first-team players were sold. Milner believed that this experience made him emotionally stronger and taught him how to deal with team problems.<sup id="_ref-findarticles_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findarticles" title="">[3]</a></sup> Leeds&#39; eventual <a href="/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation" id="w">relegation</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Championship" id="w">Championship</a> led to speculation over Milner&#39;s future at the club. <a href="/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C." id="w">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C." id="w">Aston Villa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Everton_F.C." id="w">Everton</a> all expressed an interest in signing him.<sup id="_ref-ESPN_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ESPN" title="">[8]</a></sup> Ultimately, Villa and Everton did not make offers and Milner rejected an offer from Tottenham as they were based too far from his family home where he lived.<sup id="_ref-findarticles3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findarticles3" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Milner plots Leeds deal
_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Milner plots Leeds deal
" title="">[17]</a></sup> Leeds insisted that he would not be sold and the chairman of the club at the time even referred to him as &#34;the future of Leeds&#34;.<sup id="_ref-findarticles_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findarticles" title="">[3]</a></sup> Nonetheless, financial problems eventually forced Leeds to sell him to <a href="/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C." id="w">Newcastle United</a> for an initial price of Â£3,600,000. The final total paid was Â£5,000,000, after a certain number of appearances for the new club. Although Milner was not happy to be leaving the club he had supported as a child, he wished to do what was &#34;in the club&#39;s best interest&#34;<sup id="_ref-findarticles_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findarticles" title="">[3]</a></sup> and in July 2004, he agreed a five-year deal with Newcastle.<sup id="_ref-ESPN_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ESPN" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<div class="framecaption">Milner, warming up before a pre-season friendly match</div></div>

Milner made his first appearance for <a href="/wiki/Newcastle_United" id="w">Newcastle United</a> during their pre-season tour of Asia, and scored his first goal for the club in a 1&#8211;1 draw against <a href="/wiki/Kitchee_SC" id="w">Kitchee</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a>.<sup id="_ref-Impact_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Impact" title="">[18]</a></sup> During this tour, he took the opportunity to observe how Newcastle striker <a href="/wiki/Alan_Shearer" id="w">Alan Shearer</a> dealt with attention from fans and the media. He said that his association with people like Shearer gave him a better idea of how to deal with the media.<sup id="_ref-Sunday Telegraph_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sunday Telegraph" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Milner&#39;s first Premier League game for Newcastle came against <a href="/wiki/Middlesbrough_F.C." id="w">Middlesbrough</a> on <a href="/wiki/18_August" id="w">18 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, in which he played on the extreme right of the field as a <a href="/wiki/Winger_(sport)" id="w">winger</a>, despite having featured regularly on the left for Leeds. When asked about this after the game, Milner said he had no preference where on the pitch he played.<sup id="_ref-position_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-position" title="">[19]</a></sup> A month later he made his debut in European competition, when Newcastle played in the <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Cup" id="w">UEFA Cup</a> against <a href="/wiki/Hapoel_Bnei_Sakhnin_FC" id="w">Bnei Sakhnin</a> from <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a>, after coming on as a substitute for <a href="/wiki/Shola_Ameobi" id="w">Shola Ameobi</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> In the same month, he scored his first competitive goal for the club, also as a substitute, in a 3&#8211;1 win against <a href="/wiki/West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C." id="w">West Bromwich Albion</a>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> It looked probable he would soon start a game.</p>
<p>However, the situation changed for Milner after Newcastle manager <a href="/wiki/Bobby_Robson" id="w">Bobby Robson</a>, whom Milner considered his mentor, was sacked and replaced by <a href="/wiki/Graeme_Souness" id="w">Graeme Souness</a>. Under Souness, he started 13 league games, but did not play his first full Premier League game for Newcastle until April 2005. By the end of the season, he had made 41 appearances in all competitions and scored once. Souness did not make Milner a regular in the Newcastle side and controversially remarked that the club would not win &#34;with a team of James Milners&#34;. Milner&#39;s response to this statement was reported as &#34;mature&#34;. He did however confirm that he was frustrated at not being used as a starter for most of the season.<sup id="_ref-Rooney_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rooney" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Despite playing less at club level, Milner scored his first goal for the England Under-21 side during the <a href="/wiki/2004-05_in_English_football" id="w">2004&#8211;05</a> season. The goal came in a qualification game for the <a href="/wiki/2007_UEFA_European_Under-21_Football_Championship" id="w">2007 European Under-21 Championship</a>, against <a href="/wiki/Wales_national_under-21_football_team" id="w">Wales</a>. During the game, in which he played in the centre of midfield, he also set up a scoring chance for <a href="/wiki/Darren_Bent" id="w">Darren Bent</a>. England won the game 2&#8211;0.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the start of the <a href="/wiki/2005-06_in_English_football" id="w">2005&#8211;06</a> season, Milner scored in Newcastle&#39;s 3&#8211;1 away win against <a href="/wiki/FK_ZTS_Dubnica" id="w">FK ZTS Dubnica</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Intertoto_Cup" id="w">Intertoto Cup</a>, and also set up Shearer for the team&#39;s third goal.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> His good run of form in this competition continued when he scored in the next round against <a href="/wiki/Deportivo_de_La_Coru%C3%B1a" id="w">Deportivo la CoruÃ±a</a>. Despite these goals, a clause in Newcastle&#39;s purchase of <a href="/wiki/Nolberto_Solano" id="w">Nolberto Solano</a> from <a href="/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C." id="w">Aston Villa</a> resulted in Milner being loaned to Villa for the rest of the season. Villa manager <a href="/wiki/David_O%26%2339%3BLeary" id="w">David O&#39;Leary</a>, who had managed Milner at Leeds, was happy to acquire Milner in this deal, saying that he believed Villa got the better of the deal and that he hoped to improve him as a player.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Aston_Villa" name="Aston_Villa"></a><h4>Aston Villa</h4>
<p>Milner made his Villa debut on <a href="/wiki/12_September" id="w">12 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> in a Premiership match against <a href="/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C." id="w">West Ham</a>. Five days later, he scored his first goal for the club in a 1&#8211;1 draw against <a href="/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C." id="w">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. In a <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Cup" id="w">League Cup</a> game less than a week later, he helped his side recover from being 3&#8211;1 down at half-time, to win 8&#8211;3 against <a href="/wiki/Wycombe_Wanderers_F.C." id="w">Wycombe Wanderers</a>, scoring two goals in the second half comeback.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Throughout the season, Milner was positive about his team. He remained confident that Villa would recover after making a poor start to the season and praised the quality of the squad, as well as its spirit.<sup id="_ref-team_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-team" title="">[29]</a></sup></p> 
<p>Milner was generally seen as a positive signing in a season that was disappointing for Villa.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Milner himself also received the loan move positively, saying that he would like to join Villa permanently because of the probability of becoming a regular starter, but admitted that the possibility of this happening was beyond his control.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> 
Manager <a href="/wiki/David_O%26%2339%3BLeary" id="w">David O&#39;Leary</a> confirmed during the season that he would like Milner to join the club permanently, but doubted he would be given the opportunity to sign him.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> He even pulled out of signing <a href="/wiki/Robert_Huth" id="w">Robert Huth</a> so that he would have the funds to sign Milner permanently if the opportunity arose.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Shortly before the end of his loan spell, negotiations between Villa and Newcastle began.</p>
<p>The newly appointed Newcastle manager <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Roeder" id="w">Glenn Roeder</a> appeared to appreciate Milner&#39;s ability more than Souness and expressed a desire that he remain a Newcastle player. Thisâ€”the departure of O&#39;Leary and the shortage of transfer funds at Villaâ€”meant that a deal to sign Milner permanently seemed unlikely.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> In June, it became even less likely when Villa rejected an offer of Milner as part of a trade for <a href="/wiki/Gareth_Barry" id="w">Gareth Barry</a>.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> However, the deal was resurrected when Villa were taken over by American billionaire <a href="/wiki/Randy_Lerner" id="w">Randy Lerner</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Martin_O%26%2339%3BNeill" id="w">Martin O&#39;Neill</a> was appointed as new Villa manager. Villa made an improved offer on <a href="/wiki/30_August" id="w">30 August</a>, which was accepted by Newcastle chairman <a href="/wiki/Freddy_Shepherd" id="w">Freddy Shepherd</a>. Media sources quoted the transfer fee as being Â£4,000,000. A move to Villa appeared to have been agreed, but at the last moment Newcastle recalled Milner and the talks broke down.<sup id="_ref-Roeder_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Roeder" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>

This proved to be the case, as Milner was a starter in the Newcastle side for the entire season.<sup id="_ref-Roeder_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Roeder" title="">[36]</a></sup> </p>
<p>He also continued to impress at international level, scoring the winning goal for the England Under-21 side in a 3&#8211;2 win over <a href="/wiki/Switzerland_national_under-21_football_team" id="w">Switzerland</a>. The win secured England a place in the playoff stage of the <a href="/wiki/2007_UEFA_European_Under-21_Football_Championship" id="w">2007 Under-21 European Championship</a> qualifiers.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Newcastle made a poor start in the <a href="/wiki/Premier_League" id="w">Premier League</a>, but in European competition, Milner played a key role in helping them advance through the group stage of the <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Cup_2006-07" id="w">UEFA Cup</a>. Shortly after, rumours began to spread that he would be sold during the <a href="/wiki/Transfer_window" id="w">transfer window</a> in January, although both Milner and Roeder dismissed these rumours.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/1_January" id="w">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, he scored his first goal of the season in a 2&#8211;2 draw with <a href="/wiki/Manchester_United" id="w">Manchester United</a>. The goal came from was a &#34;stunning&#34; shot from {{convert}} away.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> He scored two more goals during the next three weeks, against <a href="/wiki/Birmingham_City_F.C." id="w">Birmingham City</a> and then against <a href="/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C." id="w">West Ham United</a>. Both of these were scored from at least {{convert}} away. Later in the season, Roeder praised the progress Milner had made and said that he believed him to be the hardest training player at the club. Also during the season, Milner displayed his ability to play comfortably in a range of different positions by scoring and setting up goals with both feet from both sides.<sup id="_ref-Lampard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lampard" title="">[42]</a></sup> As a result, Milner signed a new contract at Newcastle in January, which secured his future at the club until 2011.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> He signed another four-year contract in May 2007, when <a href="/wiki/Sam_Allardyce" id="w">Sam Allardyce</a> took over as manager of Newcastle.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> Milner later confirmed that he was happy about his future at the club and with the new manager.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> Allardyce said during the season that Milner was so keen to play, that he was concerned he would &#34;burn out mentally [and] physically&#34;. As a result, Milner played mainly as a substitute in the early part of the season.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>In June, Milner competed for England at the <a href="/wiki/European_Under-21_Football_Championship" id="w">European Under-21 Football Championship</a>. He played in all four of England&#39;s matches and was booked in the semi-final against <a href="/wiki/Netherlands_national_under-21_football_team" id="w">the Netherlands</a>, which meant he would have missed the final. The game was decided by a penalty shootout, in which Milner scored twice and England lost 13&#8211;12.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> Milner&#39;s performance in the tournament led to rumours that he would make his full England debut in a friendly against <a href="/wiki/Germany_national_football_team" id="w">Germany</a>, but he was not included in the squad for the match.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> He was however included in the Under-21 squad for a friendly against <a href="/wiki/Romania_national_under-21_football_team" id="w">Romania</a>, which ended in a 1&#8211;1 draw.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> A month later, Milner set an England Under-21 record by making his 30th appearance for the side in a 3&#8211;0 win against <a href="/wiki/Montenegro_national_under-21_football_team" id="w">Montenegro</a>. During this game, he set up the first goal from a corner.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> Historically, players with several England Under-21 appearances have not progressed to become regulars in the senior side, which has led some to doubt whether he would be able to successfully make the transition.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> In October, he scored his third goal for the Under-21 side in a 3&#8211;0 win over <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_national_under-21_football_team" id="w">Republic of Ireland</a>.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> Later that month, he scored Newcastle&#39;s 500th home <a href="/wiki/Premier_League" id="w">Premier League</a> goal in a 3&#8211;1 win over <a href="/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C." id="w">Tottenham Hotspur</a>.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> A second Premier League goal of the season came fortuitously in the <a href="/wiki/Tyne-Wear_derby" id="w">Tyne-Wear derby</a> from a shot intended as a <a href="/wiki/Cross_(football)" id="w">cross</a>.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> Allardyce highly praised Milner during the season, saying &#34;He can only get better from here&#34;.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>

<p>Milner has a positive and unselfish approach to football and is regarded as being fairly quick.<sup id="_ref-findarticles2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-findarticles2" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-team_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-team" title="">[29]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-TheFA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TheFA" title="">[57]</a></sup> Because of this, his main role on the team is as a wide midfielder who creates scoring opportunities, as well as taking the ball past defenders. While he does not score many goals, he is good at providing <a href="/wiki/Assist_(football)" id="w">assists</a>. Former teammate <a href="/wiki/Nolberto_Solano" id="w">Nolberto Solano</a> said that because of his speed, Milner would become an important team player.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>Milner has the ability to pass and shoot with both feet, but names defending as one of his weaknesses.<sup id="_ref-interview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview" title="">[59]</a></sup> He therefore usually goes forward for <a href="/wiki/Set_piece_(football)" id="w">set pieces</a> and is often a candidate to take <a href="/wiki/Corner_kick" id="w">corners</a> and <a href="/wiki/Direct_free_kick" id="w">free kicks</a><sup id="_ref-everything2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-everything2" title="">[60]</a></sup>â€”this is supported by his ability to produce accurate <a href="/wiki/Cross_(football)" id="w">crosses</a> and play on either side of the field.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> Despite these positive qualities, some commentators criticise his crossing ability.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup>

<p>Milner has been described as &#34;a good reader of the game&#34;;<sup id="_ref-nufc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nufc" title="">[64]</a></sup> his awareness of players around him, and his willingness to pass, have been called mature for a player of his age.<sup id="_ref-Chelsea_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chelsea" title="">[12]</a></sup> His awareness allows him to pass the ball from a range of positions to teammates making forward runs, and also gives him the confidence to take on defenders.<sup id="_ref-everything2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-everything2" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>Milner believes that he is a hard-worker, confident and relaxed,<sup id="_ref-interview_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview" title="">[59]</a></sup> and expresses willingness to play as much as possible.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> His good work ethic in training has been compared to that of <a href="/wiki/Frank_Lampard" id="w">Frank Lampard</a>.<sup id="_ref-Lampard_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lampard" title="">[42]</a></sup> Milner feels that <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Rooney" id="w">Wayne Rooney</a>&#39;s move to <a href="/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C." id="w">Manchester United</a> and success as a player has taken a lot of pressure off his own career, commenting, &#34;I have been able to concentrate on football and ignore everything else.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Rooney_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rooney" title="">[22]</a></sup>
