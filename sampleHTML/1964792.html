<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>Originally the site of the <i>Ein Husub</i> police station during the <a href="/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine" id="w">British Mandate of Palestine</a>, the location was captured by the <a href="/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces" id="w">Israel Defense Forces</a> in 1948. The village of Ir Ovot was founded in 1967, in an area deserted apart from a small military base and roadside cafe on the way to <a href="/wiki/Eilat" id="w">Eilat</a>. It was founded by a group of American <a href="/wiki/Messianic_Judaism" id="w">Messianic Jews</a> led by former <a href="/wiki/Law_student" id="w">law student</a> and <a href="/wiki/Court_clerk" id="w">court clerk</a> Simcha Pearlmutter, a Jew from <a href="/wiki/Miami" id="w">Miami</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, who that year decided that <a href="/wiki/Jesus" id="w">Jesus</a> was the Messiah, and took a Christian <a href="/wiki/Bigamy" id="w">second wife</a> in addition to his Jewish one.<sup id="_ref-JPost_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JPost" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Haaretz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haaretz" title="">[2]</a></sup>
<a href="/wiki/Oboth" id="w">Oboth</a> (<a href="/wiki/Book_of_Numbers" id="w">Numbers</a> {{sourcetext}}; <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Deuteronomy" id="w">Deuteronomy</a> {{sourcetext}}) was <a href="/wiki/Stations_list" id="w">one of the camping stations</a> used by the <a href="/wiki/Israelite" id="w">Israelites</a> during <a href="/wiki/The_Exodus" id="w">their Exodus</a> from <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>.</p>
<p>The group was eventually joined by a few Jews and a number of <a href="/wiki/Gentile" id="w">gentiles</a> who supported the self-styled <a href="/wiki/Rabbi" id="w">Rabbi</a> Pearlmutter. After disputes with the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Agency" id="w">Jewish Agency</a>, Pearlmutter found a political and financial sponsor in the <a href="/wiki/Satmar_(Hasidic_dynasty)" id="w">Satmar</a> Hasidic group, despite Pearlmutter&#39;s adoption of Christianity. After establishing his alliance with Satmar, Pearlmutter declared himself to be an <a href="/wiki/Anti-Zionism" id="w">anti-Zionist</a>. Throughout the 1970s, Ir Ovot, which featured a <a href="/wiki/Cheder" id="w">cheder</a>, synagogue, communal <a href="/wiki/Dining_room" id="w">dining room</a>, and members&#39; meeting, was considered a <a href="/wiki/Haredi" id="w">Haredi</a> <a href="/wiki/Kibbutz" id="w">kibbutz</a>, but a 1982 conflict between Pearlmutter and the <a href="/wiki/Edah_HaChareidis" id="w">Edah HaChareidis</a> in Jerusalem led to the departure of his first, Jewish wife, and their children. His second wife remained even after his 2004 death. Officially dissolved as a formal association in the mid-1980s by two court-assigned liquidators, after further conflicts with local government over land leasing rights, the families remained in individual capacities. The village was joined by a German family in 2003, which has since become host for groups from <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a> coming to take part in the agricultural work.<sup id="_ref-JPost_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JPost" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Haaretz_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haaretz" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since 1984, the <a href="/wiki/Evangelicalism" id="w">Evangelical Christian</a> &#34;Blossoming Rose&#34; has run a program for seasonal North American Christian volunteering in Ir Ovot&#39;s agriculture and operations. They were a driving force in financing and enlarging the archaeological dig, and have embarked on the development of the &#34;Tamar&#34; archaeological park at the site.</p>

<p>A third fortress from the Late First Temple period from the 7th–6th centuries BCE was found, though because only the walls&#39; foundations remain, reconstructing the floor plan has been difficult. However, an eastern wall with two towers set {{convert}} apart was reconstructed.<sup id="_ref-Tamar_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tamar" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>A pit full of smashed clay and stone, which were reassembled into 74 <a href="/wiki/Cultic" id="w">cultic</a> vessels, was also found, indicating a probable Edomite shrine. <a href="/wiki/Censer" id="w">Censers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chalice_(cup)" id="w">chalices</a>, <a href="/wiki/Altar" id="w">altars</a> and human <a href="/wiki/Figurine" id="w">figurines</a> were unearthed outside the fortress wall on the site&#39;s northern edge in 1993, near the foundations of a small building that seems to have been a shrine.
