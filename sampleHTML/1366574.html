<b>Simonov monastery</b> (<a href="/wiki/Russian_language" id="w">Russian</a>: Симонов монастырь) in <a href="/wiki/Moscow" id="w">Moscow</a> was established in 1370 by monk Feodor, a nephew and disciple of St <a href="/wiki/Sergius_of_Radonezh" id="w">Sergius of Radonezh</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Monastery" id="w">monastery</a> land formerly belonged to Simeon Khovrin, a <a href="/wiki/Boyar" id="w">boyar</a> of <a href="/wiki/Principality_of_Theodoro" id="w">Greek extraction</a> and progenitor of the great clan of <a href="/wiki/Golovin" id="w">Golovins</a>. He took monastic vows in the cloister under the name Simon (hence the name); many of his descendants are also buried there. In <a href="/wiki/1379" id="w">1379</a>, the monastery was moved half a mile to the east. Its original location, where bodies of the warriors killed in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Kulikovo" id="w">Battle of Kulikovo</a> had been buried, is still commemorated by the old Simonov church. <div style="wigth:300px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:300px-simonov_1895.jpg" title="Simonov monastery in the 19th century"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300px-simonov_1895.jpg" alt="Simonov monastery in the 19th century" title="Simonov monastery in the 19th century" class="location-left type-thumb" width="300px" />

<p>During the 15th century, the cloister was the richest in Moscow. Among the learned monks who lived and worked there were <a href="/wiki/Vassian_Patrikeyev" id="w">Vassian Patrikeyev</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maximus_the_Greek" id="w">Maximus the Greek</a>. A white stone cathedral was erected in 1405; it was later enlarged by order of <a href="/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible" id="w">Ivan the Terrible</a>. As the monastery defended southern approaches to Moscow, it was heavily fortified in the 1640s. The last addition to the complex was a huge multi-storied <a href="/wiki/Belfry_(architecture)" id="w">bell-tower</a>, modelled after <a href="/wiki/Ivan_the_Great_Bell_Tower" id="w">Ivan the Great Bell Tower</a> of <a href="/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin" id="w">Moscow Kremlin</a>.</p>
<p>The monastery was abolished by the <a href="/wiki/Bolsheviks" id="w">Bolsheviks</a> in <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a>, and soon thereafter most of its buildings were demolished to make way for an automobile plant. Surviving structures all date back to the 17th century and include three <a href="/wiki/Tower" id="w">towers</a> of cannon-like appearance and auxiliary buildings in the <a href="/wiki/Naryshkin_baroque" id="w">Naryshkin baroque</a> style. Recently the Moscow government announced plans for a full-scale reconstruction of the famous cloister.</p>
