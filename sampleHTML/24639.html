<b><i>Press Gang</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> children&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Television" id="w">television</a> <a href="/wiki/Comedy-drama" id="w">comedy-drama</a> consisting of forty-three episodes across five series that were broadcast from <a href="/wiki/1989_in_television" id="w">1989</a> to <a href="/wiki/1993_in_television" id="w">1993</a>. It was produced by Richmond Film &#38; Television for <a href="/wiki/Central_Independent_Television" id="w">Central</a>, and screened on the <a href="/wiki/ITV" id="w">ITV</a> network in its regular weekday afternoon children&#39;s strand, <i><a href="/wiki/CiTV" id="w">Children&#39;s ITV</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-newtonm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newtonm" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Aimed at older children and teenagers, the programme was based around the activities of a children&#39;s newspaper, the <i>Junior Gazette</i>, produced by pupils from the local <a href="/wiki/Comprehensive_school" id="w">comprehensive school</a>. In later series it would be depicted as a commercial venture. The show interspersed comedic elements with the dramatic. As well as addressing <a href="/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship" id="w">interpersonal relationships</a> (particularly in the Lynda-Spike <a href="/wiki/Story_arc" id="w">story arc</a>), the show tackled issues such as <a href="/wiki/Solvent_abuse" id="w">solvent abuse</a>, <a href="/wiki/Child_abuse" id="w">child abuse</a> and <a href="/wiki/Firearm" id="w">firearms</a> control.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Written by ex-teacher <a href="/wiki/Steven_Moffat" id="w">Steven Moffat</a>, over half of the episodes were directed by <a href="/wiki/Bob_Spiers" id="w">Bob Spiers</a>, a noted <a href="/wiki/British_comedy" id="w">British comedy</a> director who had previously worked on classics such as <i><a href="/wiki/Fawlty_Towers" id="w">Fawlty Towers</a></i>. Critical reception was very positive, particularly for the quality of its writing,  and has attracted a <a href="/wiki/Cult_following" id="w">cult following</a> with a wide age range.<sup id="_ref-newtonm_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newtonm" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Famous journalist Matt Kerr (<a href="/wiki/Clive_Wood" id="w">Clive Wood</a>) arrives from <a href="/wiki/Fleet_Street" id="w">Fleet Street</a> to edit the local newspaper.

Some of the team are &#34;star pupils&#34;. However, some members have reputations of delinquency. One such pupil, Spike Thompson (<a href="/wiki/Dexter_Fletcher" id="w">Dexter Fletcher</a>) is forced to work on the paper rather than being expelled from school. He is immediately attracted to editor Lynda Day (<a href="/wiki/Julia_Sawalha" id="w">Julia Sawalha</a>), but they bicker, throwing <a href="/wiki/One-liner_joke" id="w">one-liners</a> at each other. Their relationship develops and they have an on-off relationship.<sup id="_ref-newtons2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newtons2" title="">[4]</a></sup> They regularly discuss their feelings, especially in the concluding episodes of each series. In the final episode for the third series, &#34;Holding On&#34;, Spike unwittingly expresses his strong feelings to Lynda whilst being taped.<sup id="_ref-holdingon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-holdingon" title="">[5]</a></sup> Jealous of his American girlfriend, Zoe, Lynda puts the cassette on her <a href="/wiki/Personal_stereo" id="w">personal stereo</a>, ruining their relationship. The on-screen chemistry between the two leads was reflected off-screen as they became an item for several years.<sup id="_ref-Moffcomm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Moffcomm" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the Lynda and Spike <a href="/wiki/Story_arc" id="w">story arc</a> runs throughout the series, most episodes feature self-contained stories and sub-plots.  Amongst lighter stories, such as one about Colin accidentally attending a funeral dressed as a pink rabbit, the show tackled many serious issues. Jeff Evans, writing in the <i>Guinness Television Encyclopedia</i>, writes that the series adopts a &#34;far more adult approach&#34; than &#34;previous efforts in the same vein&#34; such as <i><a href="/wiki/A_Bunch_of_Fives" id="w">A Bunch of Fives</a>.</i> Some critics also compared it with <i><a href="/wiki/Hill_Street_Blues" id="w">Hill Street Blues</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Lou_Grant_(TV_series)" id="w">Lou Grant</a></i> &#34;and other thoughtful US dramas, thanks to its realism and its level headed treatment of touchy subjects.&#34;<sup id="_ref-evans_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-evans" title="">[8]</a></sup> The first series approached <a href="/wiki/Solvent_abuse" id="w">solvent abuse</a> in &#34;How To Make A Killing&#34;, and the <a href="/wiki/NSPCC" id="w">NSPCC</a> assisted in the production of the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Something_Terrible" id="w">Something Terrible</a>&#34; episodes about <a href="/wiki/Child_abuse" id="w">child abuse</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  The team were held hostage by a gun enthusiast in series three&#39;s &#34;The Last Word&#34;,<sup id="_ref-lw_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lw" title="">[10]</a></sup> while the final episode approaches <a href="/wiki/Drug_abuse" id="w">drug abuse</a>.<sup id="_ref-tac_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tac" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-newtons5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-newtons5" title="">[12]</a></sup> The issue led episodes served to develop the main characters, so that &#34;Something Terrible&#34; is more &#34;about Colin&#39;s redemption [from selfish capitalist], rather than Cindy&#39;s abuse.&#34;<sup id="_ref-moffint_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-moffint" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/British_Film_Institute" id="w">British Film Institute</a>, &#34;<i>Press Gang</i> managed to be perhaps the funniest children&#39;s series ever made and at the same time the most painfully raw and emotionally honest. The tone could change effortlessly and sensitively from farce to tragedy in the space of an episode.&#34;<sup id="_ref-screenonline_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-screenonline" title="">[14]</a></sup> Although the series is sometimes referred to as a comedy, Moffat insists that it is a drama with jokes in it. The writer recalls &#34;a long running argument with Geoff Hogg (film editor on <i>Press Gang</i>) about whether <i>Press Gang</i> was comedy. He insisted that it was and I said it wasn&#39;t - it was just funny.&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Some innuendo leads Moffat to claim that it &#34;had the dirtiest jokes in history, we got away with tons of stuff ... We nearly got away with a joke about <a href="/wiki/Anal_sex" id="w">anal sex</a>, but they spotted it at the last minute.&#34;<sup id="_ref-herring_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-herring" title="">[16]</a></sup> In one episode Lynda says she&#39;s going to &#34;butter him up&#34;, and, when asked whilst on a date in a restaurant if he was staying at the hotel, Colin replies &#34;I shouldn&#39;t think so: it&#39;s only the first date.&#34;<sup id="_ref-chance_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chance" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jeff Evans also comments that the series was filmed cinematically, dabbling &#34;in dream sequences, flashbacks, fantasies and, on one-occasion, a <i><a href="/wiki/Moonlighting_(TV_series)" id="w">Moonlighting</a></i>-esque parody of the film <i><a href="/wiki/It%26%2339%3Bs_a_Wonderful_Life" id="w">It&#39;s a Wonderful Life</a></i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-evans_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-evans" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-daydreams_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-daydreams" title="">[18]</a></sup> The show had a strong awareness of continuity, with some stories, incidents and minor characters referred to throughout the series. Actors who played short-term characters in the first two series were invited back to reprise their roles in future episodes.  David Jefford (Alex Crockett) was resurrected from 1989&#39;s &#34;Monday - Tuesday&#34; to appear in the final episode &#34;<a href="/wiki/There_Are_Crocodiles" id="w">There Are Crocodiles</a>&#34;,<sup id="_ref-tac_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tac" title="">[11]</a></sup> while the same actress (Aisling Flitton) who played a wrong number in &#34;Love and the Junior Gazette&#34;<sup id="_ref-love_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-love" title="">[19]</a></sup> was invited to reprise her character for the third season episode &#34;Chance is a Fine Thing.&#34;<sup id="_ref-chance_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chance" title="">[17]</a></sup>  &#34;Attention to detail&#34; such as this is, according to <a href="/wiki/Paul_Cornell" id="w">Paul Cornell</a>, &#34;one of the numerous ways that the series respects the intelligence of its viewers.&#34;<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the team leaves school, the paper gains financial independence and runs commercially. Assistant editor Kenny (<a href="/wiki/Lee_Ross_(actor)" id="w">Lee Ross</a>), leaves at the end of series three to be replaced by Julie (<a href="/wiki/Lucy_Benjamin" id="w">Lucy Benjamin</a>), who was the head of the graphics team in season one.</p>
<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h1>Production</h1>
<a id="Inception" name="Inception"></a><h2>Inception</h2>
<p>Bill Moffat, a headmaster from <a href="/wiki/Glasgow" id="w">Glasgow</a>, had an idea for a children&#39;s television programme called <i>The Norbridge Files</i>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> He showed it to a producer who came to his school when it was used as the location for <a href="/wiki/Harry_Secombe" id="w">Harry Secombe</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Highway_(TV_series)" id="w">Highway</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-herring_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-herring" title="">[16]</a></sup> Producer <a href="/wiki/Sandra_C._Hastie" id="w">Sandra C. Hastie</a> liked the idea and showed it to Bill Ward, of Richmond Films and Television. When she requested a script, Moffat suggested that his 25-year old son, Steven, an English teacher, should write it. Hastie said that it was &#34;the best ever first script&#34; that she had read.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> </p>
<p>All 43 episodes were written by Steven Moffat. During production of series two, he was having an unhappy personal life after the break-up of his first marriage. His wife&#39;s new lover was represented in the episode &#34;The Big Finish?&#34; by the character Brian Magboy (<a href="/wiki/Simon_Schatzberger" id="w">Simon Schatzberger</a>), a name inspired by Brian: Maggie&#39;s boy. Moffat brought in the character so that all sorts of unfortunate things would happen to him, such as having a <a href="/wiki/Typewriter" id="w">typewriter</a> dropped on his foot.<sup id="_ref-big finish_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-big finish" title="">[23]</a></sup> This period in Moffat&#39;s life would also be reflected in his sitcom <i><a href="/wiki/Joking_Apart" id="w">Joking Apart</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Central had confidence in the project, so rather than the show being shot at their studios in <a href="/wiki/Nottingham" id="w">Nottingham</a> as planned, they granted Richmond a £2 million budget. This enabled it to be shot on <a href="/wiki/16mm_film" id="w">16mm film</a>, rather than the regular, less expensive <a href="/wiki/Videotape" id="w">videotape</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Filming_location" id="w">on location</a>, making it very expensive compared to most children&#39;s television.<sup id="_ref-putp_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-putp" title="">[25]</a></sup> These high production costs almost lead to its cancellation at the end of the second series, by which time Central executive Lewis Rudd was unable to commission programmes by himself.<sup id="_ref-big finish_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-big finish" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Directors" name="Directors"></a><h2>Directors</h2>
<p>Over half of the episodes were directed by <a href="/wiki/Bob_Spiers" id="w">Bob Spiers</a>, a noted British comedy director who had previously worked on <i><a href="/wiki/Fawlty_Towers" id="w">Fawlty Towers</a></i> amongst many other programmes. He would work again with Moffat on his sitcom <i><a href="/wiki/Joking_Apart" id="w">Joking Apart</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Murder_Most_Horrid" id="w">Murder Most Horrid</a></i>, and with Sawalha on <i><a href="/wiki/Absolutely_Fabulous" id="w">Absolutely Fabulous</a></i>. According to Moffat, Spiers was the &#34;principle director&#34; taking an interest in the other episodes and setting the visual style of the show. Spiers particularly used <a href="/wiki/Tracking_shot" id="w">tracking shots</a>, sometimes requiring more dialogue to be written to accommodate the length of the shot. The other directors would come in and &#34;do a Spiers&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Moffcomm_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Moffcomm" title="">[6]</a></sup> All of the directors were encouraged to attend the others&#39; shoots so that the visual style would be consistent.<sup id="_ref-hastie_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hastie" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first two episodes were directed by <a href="/wiki/Colin_Nutley" id="w">Colin Nutley</a>.

<a id="Location" name="Location"></a><h2>Location</h2>
<p>Whilst the show was set in the fictional town of Norbridge, it was mostly filmed in <a href="/wiki/Uxbridge%2C_London" id="w">Uxbridge</a>, a suburb of <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>.<sup id="_ref-moffint_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-moffint" title="">[13]</a></sup>  The first series was filmed entirely on location, but after the demolition of the building used as the original newspaper office, interior shots were filmed in <a href="/wiki/Pinewood_Studios" id="w">Pinewood Studios</a> for the second series, and the exterior of the building wasn&#39;t seen beyond that series.  Subsequent series were filmed at <a href="/wiki/Shepperton_Studios" id="w">Lee International Studios</a> at <a href="/wiki/Shepperton" id="w">Shepperton</a> (series three and four) and <a href="/wiki/Twickenham_Studios" id="w">Twickenham Studios</a> (series five).<sup id="_ref-petford_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-petford" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

The <a href="/wiki/Theme_music" id="w">theme music</a> was composed by Peter Davis, John Mealing and John G. Perry.<sup id="_ref-petford_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-petford" title="">[27]</a></sup> The opening titles show the main characters striking a pose, with the name of the respective actor in a typewriter style typeface. Moffat says that if the credits look &#34;cheesy&#34; now, they also did back in 1989.<sup id="_ref-Moffcomm_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Moffcomm" title="">[6]</a></sup> They were re-recorded for series three, in the same style, to address the actors&#39; ages and alterations to the set.</p>
<p>Many of the closing titles in the first two series were accompanied by dialogue from two characters. Episodes that ended on a particularly sombre tone, such as &#34;Monday-Tuesday&#34;<sup id="_ref-m-t_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-m-t" title="">[31]</a></sup> and &#34;Yesterday&#39;s News&#34;,<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> used only appropriately sombre music to accompany the end credits. After an emphatic climax, &#34;At Last a Dragon&#34; used an enhanced version of the main theme with more extravagant use of electric guitar. Moffat felt that the voiceovers worked well in the first season, but that they were not as good in the second. Hastie recalls that Moffat was &#34;extremely angry&#34; that <i><a href="/wiki/Drop_the_Dead_Donkey" id="w">Drop the Dead Donkey</a></i> had adopted the style. They were dropped after the second series.<sup id="_ref-hastie_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hastie" title="">[26]</a></sup> The cast, according to Moffat, were &#34;grumpy with having to turn up to a recording studio to record them.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Lynda Day</b> (<a href="/wiki/Julia_Sawalha" id="w">Julia Sawalha</a>) is the editor of the <i>Junior Gazette</i>. She is strong and opinionated, and is feared by many of her team. Moffat has said that the character was partly based on the show&#39;s &#34;ball-breaking&#34; producer, Sandra C. Hastie.<sup id="_ref-Moffcomm_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Moffcomm" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-bbcreviews2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbcreviews2" title="">[34]</a></sup> In the 2007 <a href="/wiki/BBC_Four" id="w">BBC Four</a> series <i>Children&#39;s TV on Trial</i>, journalist <a href="/wiki/Johann_Hari" id="w">Johann Hari</a> says that Lynda is &#34;very much a product of the 1980s ... a woman in charge who&#39;s brittle, very fierce, has no power of <a href="/wiki/Empathy" id="w">empathy</a>, is very cruel to the people around her.&#34;<sup id="_ref-hari_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hari" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p /><blockquote>The consequences of Lynda&#39;s complete lack of compassion and her cruelty, how it effects the people around her, and how it eventually leads to her own destruction and death ... anyone who knows anything about Britain in the <a href="/wiki/1980s" id="w">1980s</a> can see some pretty clear parallels with our own <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" id="w">Prime Minister</a>.<sup id="_ref-hari_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hari" title="">[35]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Although she appears very tough, she occasionally exposes her feelings. She quits the paper at the end of &#34;Monday-Tuesday&#34;, and in &#34;Day Dreams&#34; laments &#34;Why do I get everything in my whole stupid life wrong?&#34;<sup id="_ref-daydreams_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-daydreams" title="">[18]</a></sup> Intimidated by socialising, she <a href="/wiki/Hiccup" id="w">hiccups</a> at the idea.

The mixture of Lynda&#39;s sensitive side and her <a href="/wiki/Self-sufficiency" id="w">self-sufficient</a> attitude is illustrated in the series&#39; final episode &#34;There Are Crocodiles.&#34; Reprimanding the ghost of Gary (Mark Sayers), who died after taking a drug overdose, she says:</p>
<p /><blockquote>Look, I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re dead OK? I <i>do</i> care. But to be perfectly honest with you, I don&#39;t care a lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died. Are you seriously claiming no one told you it was dangerous? ... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately? ...

So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.<sup id="_ref-tac_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tac" title="">[11]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Having the protagonist repent in hell is, according to Moffat, &#34;always a  novel way to end a teen-romance series.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Moffcomm_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Moffcomm" title="">[6]</a></sup> Whether or not Lynda dies is ambiguous.

<b>James &#34;Spike&#34; Thomson</b> (<a href="/wiki/Dexter_Fletcher" id="w">Dexter Fletcher</a>) is an American delinquent, forced to work on the paper rather than being excluded from school. He is immediately attracted to Lynda, and he establishes himself as an important member of the reporting team having been responsible for getting their first lead story. He usually has a range of one-liners, though is often criticised, particularly by Lynda, for excessive joking. However, Spike often consciously uses humour to lighten the tone, such as in &#34;Monday-Tuesday&#34; when he tries to cheer up Lynda after she feels responsible for David&#39;s suicide.<sup id="_ref-m-t_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-m-t" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>The character was originally written as English, until producer Hastie felt that an American character would enhance the chance of overseas sales. This meant that English-born Fletcher had to act in an <a href="/wiki/Regional_accents_of_English_speakers" id="w">American accent</a> for all five years. Moffat says that he isn&#39;t &#34;sure [that] lumbering Dexter with that accent was a smart move.&#34;<sup id="_ref-moffint_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-moffint" title="">[13]</a></sup> His accent, however, was so convincing that many are surprised to learn that Fletcher is English.<sup id="_ref-dexter_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dexter" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Kenny Phillips</b> (<a href="/wiki/Lee_Ross_(actor)" id="w">Lee Ross</a>) is one of Lynda&#39;s (few) long-term friends and is her assistant editor in the first three seasons. Kenny is much calmer than Lynda, though is still dominated by her. Despite this, he is one of the few people able to stand up to Lynda, in his own quiet way. Although he identifies himself as &#34;sweet&#34;, he is unlucky in love: Jenny (<a href="/wiki/Sadie_Frost" id="w">Sadie Frost</a>), the girlfriend he meets in &#34;How to Make a Killing&#34;,<sup id="_ref-htmak_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-htmak" title="">[28]</a></sup> dumps him because he is too understanding.<sup id="_ref-love_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-love" title="">[19]</a></sup> His secret passion for writing music is revealed at the end of series two, which was influenced by Ross&#39; interests. Colin organizes and markets a concert for him, and series two ends with Kenny performing &#34;You Don&#39;t Feel For Me&#34; (written by Ross himself).<sup id="_ref-big finish_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-big finish" title="">[23]</a></sup> Lee Ross was only able to commit to the first six episodes of the 12-episode series three and four filming block because he was expecting a film role.<sup id="_ref-hastie_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hastie" title="">[26]</a></sup> Thus, by series four, Kenny has left for <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>.</p>
<p><b>Colin Mathews</b> (<a href="/wiki/Paul_Reynolds_(actor)" id="w">Paul Reynolds</a>) is the <a href="/wiki/Thatcherite" id="w">Thatcherite</a> in charge of the paper&#39;s finances and advertising.

<p><b>Sarah Jackson</b> (<a href="/wiki/Kelda_Holmes" id="w">Kelda Holmes</a>) is the paper&#39;s lead writer. Although she is intelligent she gets stressed, such as during her interview for editorship of the <i>Junior Gazette</i>.
