The <b>Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 cars</b> form one of the four types of <a href="/wiki/Rolling_stock" id="w">rolling stock</a> found on Singapore&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)" id="w">Mass Rapid Transit</a> system. These are the oldest trains on the system, which have been running since the MRT system&#39;s inception in <a href="/wiki/1987" id="w">1987</a>, and are still in operation today. These trains are owned by <a href="/wiki/SMRT_Corporation" id="w">SMRT Corporation</a>, and run on the <a href="/wiki/North_South_Line" id="w">North South</a> and <a href="/wiki/East_West_MRT_Line" id="w">East West Lines</a>, both of which are operated by SMRT Corporation. A major overhaul program is being planned for the trains. 66 trainsets consisting of 6 cars each were purchased at a cost of <a href="/wiki/Singapore_dollar" id="w">S$581</a>.5 million. </p>
<p>These trains were manufactured from <a href="/wiki/1986" id="w">1986</a> to <a href="/wiki/1989" id="w">1989</a> in three batches, headed by <a href="/wiki/Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries_Rolling_Stock_Company" id="w">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</a> (21 trainsets), collaborating with <a href="/wiki/Nippon_Sharyo" id="w">Nippon Sharyo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tokyu_Car_Corp" id="w">Tokyu Car Corp</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kinki_Sharyo" id="w">Kinki Sharyo</a> as a Japanese consortium. No visible difference can be found in any of these batches, being built to agreed specifications. The trains are now undergoing refurbishment and due to be completed by 2008.</p>

</p><a id="Interior" name="Interior"></a><h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of these trains consists mostly of plastic, with glass partitions separating the seating areas from the passenger doors and metal grab poles. Straps line the middle of every car. The colour scheme of the interior are also different. The cab cars (trailer cars at the ends of the train) have an orange colour scheme. The second and fifth motor cars sport a blue interior, while the middle two motor cars use a green colour scheme. These trains have no visual passenger information systems, but have an automatic built-in audio announcement system.</p>

<p>LCD monitors were installed in a C151 (carriage number 3132) car in the late 90s as part of a pilot program for <a href="/wiki/TV_Mobile" id="w">TV Mobile</a> trial runs. They have since been removed.</p>
<p>A four-car unit is further built by Kawasaki to serve its rounds as a <a href="/wiki/Money_train" id="w">money train</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_2006" id="w">November 2006</a>, the doors of three cars (carriage number 3006, 1006 and 2006) have each been installed with a dynamic in-train system displaying station information for testing, similar to the ones in use by Hong Kong <a href="/wiki/MTR" id="w">MTR</a>, but they have been removed before the end of the year without entering in service.</p>
<p>A tender has been placed by SMRT for the design, supply, manufacture, installation and testng of the above system, renamed &#34;Active Route Map Display System&#34;. It is expected to be installed on the C151 and C651 cars in 2008, since they do not feature onboard electronic displays.                               42 Trains will still Enter Service</p>

<p>SMRT Corporation is currently refurbishing the C151 trains and this will be completed by around <a href="/wiki/2008" id="w">2008</a>. On 14 February 2006, <a href="/wiki/Mitsui" id="w">Mitsui</a> &#38; Co, RM Transit Technology, Lexbuild and <a href="/wiki/Rotem" id="w">Rotem</a> Company have received an order to refurbish all 396 carriages costing <a href="/wiki/S%24" id="w">S$142</a>.7 million. The renewal works will include the refurbishment of seats and other interior fixtures, allocation of space for wheelchair personnel, the upgrading of onboard telecommunications equipment, and the improvement of the internal appearance of the cars. </p>
<p>The exterior of refurbished trains will resemble that of <a href="/wiki/Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries_%26amp%3B_Nippon_Sharyo_C751B_cars" id="w">C751B cars</a>, except that they will have flat frontal structures. The train wall and door panels are all white, as in the C751 cars, and the seats are red in cars 1 and 6, blue in cars 2 and 5, and green in cars 3 and 4. The end of each row of seats has two darker colored seats, which are the priority seats.  Seats of the new cars were increased in length from 43cm to 48cm , having four seats from each seven seats to have a dark version of the corresponding colour of each car and the rest of the seats in every seven seats with a lighter one. The number of seats per row now 7 down from previously 9, was a decision which found unpopularity among commuters due to less seating capacity. Extra standing area has also been provided to increase the capacity of the refurbished cars. </p>
<p>The engine components have been retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space is available only on the end of two middle cars nearest to the lifts in above ground stations. LED displays that blink when doors are closing were introduced except that it is positioned in the upper middle section of the door. More speakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles are now located near the doors and at both ends of each carriage. The air-conditioning system has been changed to match the system used similarly by the C751Bs. The run number displays of refurbished trains remain unchanged. The announcement system has also been changed to match the ones used in the C751B cars.</p>
<p>SMRT Corporation has also cited reasons of wear and tear of important components over the past two decades of service and water leaks from the air-conditioning system of some trains. The company chose this option in favour over new rolling stock, which would have cost S$792 million. On <a href="/wiki/5_November" id="w">5 November</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, the first refurbished train began revenue services. Refurbishment of other trains will take place at the rate of 21 days per train and as of 28th December 2007, 21 refurbished trains had entered revenue service.</p>
<a id="Car_numbers" name="Car_numbers"></a><h1>Car numbers</h1>
<p>The car numbers of the trains range from x001 to x132, where x depends on the carriage type. Individual cars are assigned a 4 digit serial number by the rail operator SMRT.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The first digit depends upon whether the car is the first, second or third car from either end of the train, where the first car equals 3, the second equals 1 &#38; the third equals 2.</li>
<li>The other 3 digits is the train identification number. A full length train of 6 cars have 2 different identification number, one for the first 3 cars, and the same number plus 1, for the other three. The smaller number is always an odd number.For example, a train would consist of 6 cars with serial number 3033, 1033, 2033, 2034, 1034, 3034 respectively.</li></ul>
