The <b>United States ten-dollar bill</b> ($10) is a <a href="/wiki/Denomination_(currency)" id="w">denomination</a> of <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">United States currency</a>.  <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury" id="w">U.S. Secretary of the Treasury</a> <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton" id="w">Alexander Hamilton</a> is currently featured on the <a href="/wiki/Obverse" id="w">obverse</a> of the bill, while the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury" id="w">U.S. Treasury</a> is featured on the <a href="/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse" id="w">reverse</a>. (Hamilton is one of two non-presidents featured on currently issued U.S. bills. The other is <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" id="w">Benjamin Franklin</a>, on the <a href="/wiki/United_States_one_hundred-dollar_bill" id="w">$100 bill</a>.) All $10 bills issued today are <a href="/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Note" id="w">Federal Reserve Notes</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Engraving_and_Printing" id="w">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</a> says the &#34;average life&#34; of a $10 bill in circulation is 18 months before it is replaced due to wear. Approximately 11% of all newly printed US <a href="/wiki/Banknote" id="w">banknotes</a> are $10 bills.  Ten dollar bills are delivered by Federal Reserve Banks in yellow straps.</p>
<p>The source of the face on the $10 bill is <a href="/wiki/John_Trumbull" id="w">John Trumbull</a>’s 1805 portrait of Hamilton that belongs to the portrait collection of <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Hall" id="w">New York City Hall</a>.  The $10 bill is the only U.S. paper currency in circulation in which the portrait faces to the left (the <a href="/wiki/Large_denominations_of_United_States_currency" id="w">$100,000 bill</a> features a portrait of <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" id="w">Woodrow Wilson</a> facing to the left, but it is no longer in circulation). </p>
