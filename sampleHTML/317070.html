<p><b>Rena Mero Lesnar</b> (born <b>Rena Greek</b> on <a href="/wiki/August_8" id="w">August 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a> in <a href="/wiki/Jacksonville%2C_Florida" id="w">Jacksonville, Florida</a>) is an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Model_(person)" id="w">model</a>, <a href="/wiki/Actor" id="w">actress</a>, and former <a href="/wiki/Professional_wrestling" id="w">professional wrestler</a>. She is primarily known for her stints in <a href="/wiki/World_Wrestling_Entertainment" id="w">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> as the buxom <b>Sable</b> character. As Sable, she was one of the first <a href="/wiki/WWE_Diva" id="w">WWE Divas</a>, gained considerable popularity, and was featured on the cover of <i><a href="/wiki/Playboy" id="w">Playboy</a></i> three times.<sup id="_ref-alumni_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-alumni" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Born <b>Rena Greek</b> in <a href="/wiki/Jacksonville%2C_Florida" id="w">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, she was active in her youth and was interested in activities such as gymnastics, horseback riding, and softball. After winning her first beauty pageant at 12 years of age, she eventually became a model, working with companies such as <a href="/wiki/L%26%2339%3BOr%C3%A9al" id="w">L&#39;Or√©al</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pepsi" id="w">Pepsi</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Guess_(clothing)" id="w">Guess?</a>.<sup id="_ref-askmen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-askmen" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Greek married Wayne Richardson in 1986, and had a daughter with him named Mariah in 1988. The two remained married until Richardson died in 1991. She met her second husband, professional wrestler and former <a href="/wiki/Boxing" id="w">boxer</a> <a href="/wiki/Marc_Mero" id="w">Marc Mero</a>, who had been performing in <a href="/wiki/World_Championship_Wrestling" id="w">World Championship Wrestling</a> as &#34;Johnny B.

<p>Rena Mero made her World Wrestling Federation debut as Sable at <i><a href="/wiki/WrestleMania_XII" id="w">WrestleMania XII</a></i> in March 1996, escorting <a href="/wiki/Triple_H" id="w">Hunter Hearst Helmsley</a> to the ring as he took on the returning <a href="/wiki/Warrior_(wrestler)" id="w">The Ultimate Warrior</a>.<sup id="_ref-alumni_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-alumni" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-release_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-release" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-homelife_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-homelife" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Rena&#39;s first major <a href="/wiki/List_of_professional_wrestling_slang#A" id="w">angles</a> as Sable involved her then real-life husband, who debuted at <i>WrestleMania XII</i> as &#34;Wildman&#34; Marc Mero. After witnessing Sable being <a href="/wiki/Kayfabe" id="w">kayfabe</a> mistreated by Helmsley backstage, the &#34;Wildman&#34; attacked Helmsley and took Sable as his <a href="/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)" id="w">manager</a>.<sup id="_ref-alumni_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-alumni" title="">[1]</a></sup> She remained Mero&#39;s manager until his injury in 1997. Between 1997 and the time he returned from his injury in 1998, Sable became popular on her own.<sup id="_ref-alumni_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-alumni" title="">[1]</a></sup> In her next storyline, a returning Marc Mero (now known as &#34;Marvelous&#34; Marc Mero) became jealous, refused to let Sable get any of the spotlight, and mistreated her. The duo entered into a <a href="/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)" id="w">feud</a> with <a href="/wiki/Gertrude_Vachon" id="w">Luna Vachon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dustin_Rhodes" id="w">The Artist Formerly Known as Goldust</a>, which climaxed in a match at <i><a href="/wiki/WrestleMania_XIV" id="w">WrestleMania XIV</a></i>. Sable delivered a superkick to Goldust and executed a <a href="/wiki/Powerbomb" id="w">powerbomb</a> (known as the &#34;Sable bomb&#34;) on Luna. She also delivered a <a href="/wiki/Cutter_(professional_wrestling)#TKO" id="w">TKO</a> and pinned Luna to finish the match, with the crowd chanting Sable&#39;s name in the background.<sup id="_ref-oww_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oww" title="">[5]</a></sup> At the following <a href="/wiki/Pay-per-view" id="w">pay-per-view</a> event, <i><a href="/wiki/WWE_Unforgiven#1998" id="w">Unforgiven 1998</a></i>, Sable lost to Luna in the promotion&#39;s first <a href="/wiki/List_of_professional_wrestling_match_types#Bra and Panties match" id="w">Evening Gown match</a> after being distracted by Marc Mero.<sup id="_ref-insidepulse_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-insidepulse" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Marc&#39;s interference at <i>Unforgiven</i>, Sable came to the ring and challenged Marc to a match. Sable then kicked him in the groin and delivered a Sable bomb to get revenge.<sup id="_ref-alumni_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-alumni" title="">[1]</a></sup> Sable eventually broke away from &#34;Marvelous&#34; Marc Mero, who debuted <a href="/wiki/Jacqueline_Moore" id="w">Jacqueline</a> as his new manager, resulting in a storyline feud between the two women.<sup id="_ref-alumni_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-alumni" title="">[1]</a></sup> The two met in a <a href="/wiki/Bikini" id="w">bikini</a> contest in July at <i><a href="/wiki/WWF_Fully_Loaded#1998" id="w">Fully Loaded 1998</a></i>. Sable, only wearing impressions of hands painted on her exposed <a href="/wiki/Breast" id="w">breasts</a>, won the contest. However, the next night on <i><a href="/wiki/WWE_Raw" id="w">RAW</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Vince_McMahon" id="w">Vince McMahon</a> disqualified Sable from the previous night&#39;s contest since she did not actually wear a bikini. The match was then awarded to Jacqueline. In response, Sable gave McMahon the double <a href="/wiki/Finger_(gesture)" id="w">finger</a>.<sup id="_ref-crz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-crz" title="">[7]</a></sup> At <i><a href="/wiki/SummerSlam_(1998)" id="w">SummerSlam 1998</a></i>, Sable and her mystery partner, federation newcomer <a href="/wiki/Adam_Copeland" id="w">Edge</a>, defeated Marc Mero and Jacqueline in a <a href="/wiki/Professional_wrestling_tag_team_match_types#mixed tag team match" id="w">mixed tag team match</a>.<sup id="_ref-oww_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oww" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sable and Jacqueline faced off for the newly reinstated <a href="/wiki/WWE_Women%26%2339%3Bs_Championship" id="w">WWF Women&#39;s Title</a> on the <a href="/wiki/September_21" id="w">September 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a> edition of <i>RAW</i>. Jacqueline claimed the title after Marc Mero interfered.<sup id="_ref-crz2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-crz2" title="">[8]</a></sup> However, on <a href="/wiki/November_15" id="w">November 15</a> <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a> at <i><a href="/wiki/Survivor_Series_(1998)" id="w">Survivor Series</a></i>, she <a href="/wiki/List_of_professional_wrestling_slang#D" id="w">dropped</a> the title to Sable, who won after powerbombing both Marc and Jacqueline during the match.<sup id="_ref-oww_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oww" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-alumni_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-alumni" title="">[1]</a></sup> During this time, Rena had a guest appearance on an episode of the <a href="/wiki/USA_Network" id="w">USA Network</a> show <i><a href="/wiki/Pacific_Blue_(TV_series)" id="w">Pacific Blue</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-slam_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-slam" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-askmen_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-askmen" title="">[2]</a></sup> Sable then briefly entered a storyline where she was forced to play a subservient role to Vince and <a href="/wiki/Shane_McMahon" id="w">Shane McMahon</a>, but the storyline did not progress very far.</p>
<p>Sable holds the record for most diva match wins in 1998, ahead of both Luna Vachon and Jacqueline.<sup id="_ref-crz3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-crz3" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Heel_turn_(1999)" name="Heel_turn_(1999)"></a><h3>Heel turn (1999)</h3>
<p>In 1999, Sable was <a href="/wiki/Kayfabe" id="w">kayfabe</a> attacked by a masked woman named Spider Lady, who turned out to be Luna. Sable defeated Luna in a <a href="/wiki/List_of_professional_wrestling_match_types#Texas Bullrope match" id="w">Strap Match</a> at the <i><a href="/wiki/Royal_Rumble_(1999)" id="w">Royal Rumble</a></i> after an assist from a <a href="/wiki/List_of_professional_wrestling_slang#P" id="w">planted</a> female Sable fan, who turned out to be WWF newcomer <a href="/wiki/Terri_Poch" id="w">Tori</a>.<sup id="_ref-oww_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oww" title="">[5]</a></sup> Tori&#39;s debut signified a change in Sable&#39;s persona.</p>
<p>After the <i>Royal Rumble</i>, Rena (under her Sable ring name) was featured as the cover girl for the April 1999 issue of <i>Playboy</i>.<sup id="_ref-slam_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-slam" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-alumni_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-alumni" title="">[1]</a></sup> The issue was the hottest selling issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Playboy" id="w">Playboy</a></i> in 15 years. Surrounding the release of the issue, the Sable character turned <a href="/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)" id="w">heel</a> by &#34;going Hollywood&#34; and having an inflated ego. Rarely defending her title, Sable continually berated her fan Tori, and she feuded with both Tori and Luna Vachon (who had turned <a href="/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)" id="w">face</a>). She debuted a new <a href="/wiki/Catch_phrase" id="w">catch phrase</a>: &#34;This is for all the women who want to be me and all the men who come to see me&#34; and a dance move called &#34;the <a href="/wiki/Grinding_(dance)" id="w">grind</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-alumni_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-alumni" title="">[1]</a></sup> The feud with Tori led to a match at <i><a href="/wiki/WrestleMania_XV" id="w">WrestleMania XV</a></i>. During the contest, <a href="/wiki/Nicole_Bass" id="w">Nicole Bass</a> debuted as Sable&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Bodyguard" id="w">bodyguard</a> and helped Sable win the match.<sup id="_ref-owow_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-owow" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sable went on with Nicole Bass making Bass do all of her dirty work. Sable continued to hold the championship for almost 6 months, but on <a href="/wiki/May_10" id="w">May 10</a> <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a>, <a href="/wiki/Debra_Marshall" id="w">Debra</a> &#34;won&#34; the Women&#39;s Championship from Sable in an Evening Gown Match. Normally in an Evening Gown Match, the winner is the woman who forcibly removes her opponent&#39;s dress, which Sable did. However, (<a href="/wiki/Kayfabe" id="w">kayfabe</a>) <a href="/wiki/List_of_authority_figures_in_professional_wrestling#Commissioners" id="w">WWF Commissioner</a> <a href="/wiki/Shawn_Michaels" id="w">Shawn Michaels</a> ruled that the woman who had lost her dress was the winner, making Debra the new Women&#39;s Champion. With this, Sable became the first woman to lose a title without losing it by <a href="/wiki/Pin_(wrestling)" id="w">pinfall</a> or <a href="/wiki/Professional_wrestling#Submission" id="w">submission</a>.<sup id="_ref-askmen_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-askmen" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In June 1999, Rena Mero quit the WWF and filed a $110 million lawsuit against the company, citing allegations of <a href="/wiki/Sexual_harassment" id="w">sexual harassment</a> and unsafe working conditions.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-release_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-release" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-homelife_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-homelife" title="">[4]</a></sup> During the course of the lawsuit, <a href="/wiki/Vince_McMahon" id="w">Vince McMahon</a> counter-sued Rena over control of the stagename &#34;Sable&#34;.<sup id="_ref-owow_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-owow" title="">[11]</a></sup> Mero reduced the amount she was seeking in damages, and they eventually settled out of court in August 1999.<sup id="_ref-release_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-release" title="">[3]</a></sup> Subsequently, her husband Marc was released from his WWF contract. Rena Mero used her real name for her appearance in the September 1999 issue of <i>Playboy</i>.

<p>During this time, Rena made appearances on <i><a href="/wiki/The_Howard_Stern_Show" id="w">The Howard Stern Show</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Late_Night_with_Conan_O%26%2339%3BBrien" id="w">Late Night with Conan O&#39;Brien</a></i>.

Rena returned to the World Wrestling Federation (now known as <a href="/wiki/World_Wrestling_Entertainment" id="w">World Wrestling Entertainment</a>) on the <a href="/wiki/April_3" id="w">April 3</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a> episode of <i><a href="/wiki/WWE_Friday_Night_SmackDown!" id="w">SmackDown!</a></i>, reprising her role as Sable. Sable continued as a heel and spent several months in a storyline with new Playboy covergirl <a href="/wiki/Torrie_Wilson" id="w">Torrie Wilson</a>. Sable would follow Torrie down to her matches, talk with her backstage, and on one occasion she left Torrie in a tag match alone to fend for herself. Sable eventually challenged Torrie Wilson to a showdown bikini contest at <a href="/wiki/WWE_Judgment_Day#2003" id="w">Judgment Day 2003</a>. After Sable got the bigger applause, Torrie removed another layer of clothing, and <a href="/wiki/List_of_professional_wrestling_match_types#Special referee" id="w">Special Guest Referee</a> <a href="/wiki/Tazz" id="w">Tazz</a> declared Torrie the winner. After the match, Torrie went up to Sable and kissed her before exiting the ring. Sable had a brief feud with the guest judge Tazz, dumping water on him on the following edition of <i>SmackDown!</i>, as a means of gaining revenge for declaring Wilson the winner.</p>
<p>Sable then feuded with <a href="/wiki/Stephanie_McMahon" id="w">Stephanie McMahon</a> in a storyline where she was Vince McMahon&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Mistress_(lover)" id="w">mistress</a>.<sup id="_ref-release_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-release" title="">[3]</a></sup> Vince appointed Sable as Stephanie McMahon&#39;s personal assistant against Stephanie&#39;s will, sparking the feud between the duo. During the feud, they competed in several catfights, a food fight, a parking lot brawl, and a match where Sable bashed a clipboard over Stephanie&#39;s head. At <i><a href="/wiki/WWE_Vengeance#2003" id="w">Vengeance 2003</a></i>, Sable defeated Stephanie after interference by her new ally, <a href="/wiki/Matt_Bloom" id="w">A-Train</a>. At <i><a href="/wiki/SummerSlam_(2003)" id="w">SummerSlam</a></i>, Sable accompanied A-Train in his match against <a href="/wiki/The_Undertaker" id="w">The Undertaker</a>, which he lost. After the match, The Undertaker held Sable so that Stephanie could use a <a href="/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks#Spear" id="w">Spear</a> attack on her. After <i>Summerslam</i>, Mr. McMahon and Sable focused on getting rid of Stephanie for good, so Vince made an <a href="/wiki/&amp;quot%3BI_Quit%26quot%3B_match" id="w">&#34;I Quit&#34; match</a> at <i><a href="/wiki/WWE_No_Mercy#2003" id="w">No Mercy 2003</a></i>. In the match, Sable slapped Stephanie and was attacked by <a href="/wiki/Linda_McMahon" id="w">Linda McMahon</a>. She also handed Vince the lead pipe that he used to choke Stephanie out for the win.<sup id="_ref-oww_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oww" title="">[5]</a></sup> During the contest, she was notably &#34;heckled&#34; by play-by-play commentator <a href="/wiki/Michael_Cole" id="w">Michael Cole</a>.</p>
<p>Sable briefly became a face again when she appeared on the cover of <i>Playboy</i> magazine for the third time in her career. On the cover, she appeared with fellow diva Torrie Wilson, making them the first WWE Divas to pose in <i>Playboy</i> together. Surrounding the release of the cover, the duo feuded with <i>RAW</i> divas <a href="/wiki/Stacy_Keibler" id="w">Stacy Keibler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jackie_Gayda" id="w">Miss Jackie</a>, even though all four women were faces at the time. The two teams squared off at <i><a href="/wiki/WrestleMania_XX" id="w">WrestleMania XX</a></i> in an Interpromotional Tag Team Evening Gown match, but the divas started the match in their underwear, making it more of a <a href="/wiki/Lingerie" id="w">lingerie</a> match.<sup id="_ref-oww_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-oww" title="">[5]</a></sup> Sable and Wilson were victorious.<sup id="_ref-release_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-release" title="">[3]</a></sup> The change was rumored to have occurred because Sable had suffered damage to her <a href="/wiki/Breast" id="w">breast</a>.<sup id="_ref-owow2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-owow2" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following <i>WrestleMania XX</i>, Sable quickly turned heel again and engaged in another short feud with Torrie Wilson. The feud culminated in a match at <i><a href="/wiki/WWE_Great_American_Bash#2004" id="w">The Great American Bash 2004</a></i>, which Sable won. Sable&#39;s final appearance in WWE would be on <i>SmackDown!</i> when she, <a href="/wiki/Dawn_Marie_Psaltis" id="w">Dawn Marie</a>, and Torrie Wilson accompanied <a href="/wiki/Eddie_Guerrero" id="w">Eddie Guerrero</a> to the ring in his lowrider.

The engagement was called off in early 2005, but they were engaged again in January 2006. They eventually married.<sup id="_ref-homelife_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-homelife" title="">[4]</a></sup> It was reported by Yahoo! Sports that they were no longer married;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> however, this was proven to be false in a recent interview with Sable in which she confirmed they are still married.<sup id="_ref-homelife_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-homelife" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
