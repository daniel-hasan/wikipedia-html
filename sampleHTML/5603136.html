<p>&#34;<b>Being Boring</b>&#34; is a single by the British pop group the <a href="/wiki/Pet_Shop_Boys" id="w">Pet Shop Boys</a>. As the second single from the 1990 album <i><a href="/wiki/Behaviour_(album)" id="w">Behaviour</a></i>, after &#34;So Hard&#34; which was released before the album, &#34;Being Boring&#34; was not particularly successful upon release, reaching only number twenty in the <a href="/wiki/UK_singles_chart" id="w">UK singles chart</a> and being the first single released by the group not to get into the top ten since &#34;<a href="/wiki/Opportunities_(Let%26%2339%3Bs_Make_Lots_of_Money)" id="w">Opportunities (Let&#39;s Make Lots of Money)</a>&#34; four years previously. </p>
<p>The song is concerned with the idea of growing up and how people&#39;s perceptions and values change as they grow older. The title apparently materialised after someone in Japan accused the duo of being boring. The title is also derived from a <a href="/wiki/Zelda_Fitzgerald" id="w">Zelda Fitzgerald</a> quotation, &#34;she refused to be bored chiefly because she wasn&#39;t boring&#34;.</p>
<p>The track was originally pieced together in a studio in West Glasgow, where the music for &#39;My October symphony&#39;, &#39;The end of the world&#39; and the unreleased &#39;Love and war&#39; were also done.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Live" name="Live"></a><h4>Live</h4>
<p>Despite this, &#34;Being Boring&#34; has been a regularly-played song at concerts and it&#39;s considered one of the best and most beautiful &#34;Pet&#39;s songs&#34; by the fans. Ironically, due to various factors, including it being hard to sing, it wasn&#39;t performed on the Performance Tour in 1991. This led to many fans, including <a href="/wiki/Axl_Rose" id="w">Axl Rose</a> complaining of its omission.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Video" name="Video"></a><h4>Video</h4>
<p>The video, the first by fashion-photographer <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Weber_(photographer)" id="w">Bruce Weber</a>, totally in black and white, shows a house party and begins with a nude swimmer and a message: &#34;I came from Newcastle in the North of England. We used to have lots of parties where everyone got dressed up and on one party invitation was the quote &#39;she was never bored because she was never boring&#39;. The song is about growing up - the ideals that you have when you&#39;re young and how they turn out&#34;.</p>
<p>Australian singer <a href="/wiki/Merril_Bainbridge" id="w">Merril Bainbridge</a> <a href="/wiki/Cover_version" id="w">covered</a> the song as the tenth track from her debut album <i><a href="/wiki/The_Garden_(Merril_Bainbridge_album)" id="w">The Garden</a></i> released in <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a>.</p>
<a id="B-side" name="B-side"></a><h4>B-side</h4>
<p>The b-side, &#34;We all feel better in the dark&#34; was written around a piece of music Chris Lowe had composed. As he explains, &#34;The idea came from a tape I bought from a health food shop round the corner from the studio:<i>The Secrets Of Sexual Attraction</i>. The words are terrible. Awful. Embarrassing.&#34; <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The track proved to be a fan favourite and was performed live during their Performance Tour in 1991. The remix 12&#34; includes two mixes of the track by <a href="/wiki/Brothers_In_Rhythm" id="w">Brothers In Rhythm</a>.</p>
