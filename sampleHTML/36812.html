<b>Pericles</b> (also spelled <b>Perikles</b>) (ca. <a href="/wiki/495_BC" id="w">495</a>&#8211;<a href="/wiki/429_BC" id="w">429 BC</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a>: {{polytonic}}, meaning &#34;<i>surrounded by glory</i>&#34;) was a prominent and influential <a href="/wiki/Statesman" id="w">statesman</a>, orator, and general of <a href="/wiki/History_of_Athens" id="w">Athens</a> during the city&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Golden_Age" id="w">Golden Age</a>&#8211;specifically, the time between the <a href="/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars" id="w">Persian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peloponnesian_War" id="w">Peloponnesian</a> wars. He was descended, through his mother, from the powerful and historically influential <a href="/wiki/Alcmaeonidae" id="w">Alcmaeonid</a> family.</p>
<p>Pericles had such a profound influence on Athenian society that <a href="/wiki/Thucydides" id="w">Thucydides</a>, his contemporary historian, acclaimed him as &#34;the first citizen of Athens.&#34; Pericles turned the <a href="/wiki/Delian_League" id="w">Delian League</a> into an Athenian empire and led his countrymen during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War. The period during which he led Athens, roughly from <a href="/wiki/461_BC" id="w">461</a> to <a href="/wiki/429_BC" id="w">429 BC</a>, is sometimes known as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Age_of_Pericles" id="w">Age of Pericles</a>,&#34; though the period thus denoted can include times as early as the <a href="/wiki/Persian_Wars" id="w">Persian Wars</a>, or as late as the next century.</p>
<p>Pericles promoted the arts and literature; this was a chief reason Athens holds the reputation of being the educational and cultural centre of the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" id="w">ancient Greek</a> world. He started an ambitious project that built most of the surviving structures on the <a href="/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens" id="w">Acropolis</a> (including the <a href="/wiki/Parthenon" id="w">Parthenon</a>). This project beautified the city, exhibited its glory, and gave work to the people.<sup id="_ref-Blois_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Blois" title="">[1]</a></sup> Furthermore, Pericles fostered <a href="/wiki/Athenian_democracy" id="w">Athenian democracy</a> to such an extent that critics call him a <a href="/wiki/Populism" id="w">populist</a>.<sup id="_ref-Muhl_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Muhl" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Ruden 80_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ruden 80" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Pericles was born around 495 BC, in the <a href="/wiki/Deme" id="w">deme</a> of <a href="/wiki/Cholargos" id="w">Cholargos</a> just north of Athens.{{Cref}} He was the son of the politic <a href="/wiki/Xanthippus" id="w">Xanthippus</a>, who, although <a href="/wiki/Ostracism" id="w">ostracized</a> in 485–4 BC, returned to Athens to command the Athenian contingent in the Greek victory at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Mycale" id="w">Mycale</a> just five years later. Pericles&#39; mother, Agariste, was a scion of the powerful and controversial noble family of the Alcmaeonidae, and her familial connections played a crucial role in starting Xanthippus&#39; political career. Agariste was the great-granddaughter of the tyrant of <a href="/wiki/Sicyon" id="w">Sicyon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cleisthenes_of_Sicyon" id="w">Cleisthenes</a>, and the niece of the supreme Athenian reformer <a href="/wiki/Cleisthenes" id="w">Cleisthenes</a>, another Alcmaeonid.{{Cref}}<sup id="_ref-Br_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Br" title="">[4]</a></sup> According to <a href="/wiki/Herodotus" id="w">Herodotus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plutarch" id="w">Plutarch</a>, Agariste dreamed, a few nights before Pericles&#39; birth, that she had borne a lion.<sup id="_ref-Her_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Her" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Pl3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl3" title="">[6]</a></sup> One interpretation of the anecdote treats the lion as a traditional symbol of greatness, but the story may also allude to the unusual size of Pericles&#39; skull, which became a popular target of contemporary comedians.<sup id="_ref-Pl3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl3" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Ehr239_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ehr239" title="">[7]</a></sup> (Although Plutarch claims that this deformity was the reason that Pericles was always depicted wearing a helmet, this is not the case; the helmet was actually the symbol of his official rank as <a href="/wiki/Strategos" id="w">strategos</a> (general)).<sup id="_ref-Cunn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cunn" title="">[8]</a></sup>

<p>Around <a href="/wiki/462_BC" id="w">462</a>&#8211;<a href="/wiki/461_BC" id="w">461 BC</a> the leadership of the democratic party decided it was time to take aim at the <a href="/wiki/Areopagus" id="w">Areopagus</a>, a traditional council controlled by the Athenian aristocracy, which had once been the most powerful body in the state.<sup id="_ref-For_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-For" title="">[20]</a></sup> The leader of the party and mentor of Pericles, <a href="/wiki/Ephialtes_of_Athens" id="w">Ephialtes</a>, proposed a sharp reduction of the Areopagus’ powers.

According to <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" id="w">Aristotle</a>, Pericles&#39; stance can be explained by the fact that his principal political opponent, Cimon, was rich and generous, and was able to secure public favor by lavishly bestowing his sizable personal fortune.<sup id="_ref-Ar27_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ar27" title="">[18]</a></sup> The historian Loren J.

<p>In 461 BC, Pericles achieved the political elimination of this formidable opponent using the weapon of <a href="/wiki/Ostracism" id="w">ostracism</a>.

<p>Such measures impelled Pericles&#39; critics to regard him as responsible for the gradual degeneration of the Athenian democracy. <a href="/wiki/Constantine_Paparregopoulus" id="w">Constantine Paparrigopoulos</a>, a major modern Greek historian, argues that Pericles sought for the expansion and stabilization of all democratic institutions.<sup id="_ref-Papar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Papar" title="">[26]</a></sup> Hence, he enacted legislation granting the lower classes access to the political system and the public offices, from which they had previously been barred on account of limited means or humble birth.<sup id="_ref-ConP_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ConP" title="">[27]</a></sup> According to Samons, Pericles believed that it was necessary to raise the demos, in which he saw an untapped source of Athenian power and the crucial element of Athenian military dominance.<sup id="_ref-Samons65_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Samons65" title="">[28]</a></sup> (The fleet, backbone of Athenian power since the days of Themistocles, was manned almost entirely by members of the lower classes.<sup id="_ref-Fine377-378_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fine377-378" title="">[29]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Cimon, on the other hand, apparently believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed. He was certain that democracy had reached its peak and Pericles’ reforms were leading to the stalemate of populism. According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles&#39; death, sank into the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy.

Thucydides managed, initially, to incite the passions of the ecclesia in his favor, but, when Pericles, the leader of the democrats, took the floor, he put the conservatives in the shade.

The Samian War was the last significant military event before the Peloponnesian War. After Thucydides&#39; ostracism, Pericles was re-elected yearly to the generalship, the only office he ever officially occupied, although his influence was so great as to make him the <i>de facto</i> ruler of the state.

<p>Pericles and his friends were never immune from attack, as preeminence in democratic Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule.<sup id="_ref-For2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-For2" title="">[66]</a></sup> Just before the eruption of the Peloponnesian war, Pericles and two of his closest associates, Phidias and his companion, <a href="/wiki/Aspasia" id="w">Aspasia</a>, faced a series of personal and judicial attacks. </p>
<p>Phidias, who had been in charge of all building projects, was first accused of embezzling gold intended for the statue of <a href="/wiki/Athena" id="w">Athena</a> and then of impiety, because, when he wrought the battle of the <a href="/wiki/Amazons" id="w">Amazons</a> on the shield of Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man, and also inserted a very fine likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.<sup id="_ref-P31_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-P31" title="">[67]</a></sup> Pericles&#39; enemies also found a false witness against Phidias, named Menon. </p>

<p>Pericles was convinced that the war against Sparta, which could not conceal its envy of Athens&#39; pre-eminence, was inevitable if not to be welcomed.<sup id="_ref-Podlecki158_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Podlecki158" title="">[75]</a></sup> Therefore he did not hesitate to send troops to <a href="/wiki/Corcyra" id="w">Corcyra</a> to reinforce the Corcyraean fleet, which was fighting against <a href="/wiki/Corinth" id="w">Corinth</a>.<sup id="_ref-Th31-54_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th31-54" title="">[76]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/433_BC" id="w">433 BC</a> the enemy fleets confronted each other at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Sybota" id="w">Battle of Sybota</a> and a year later the Athenians fought Corinthian colonists at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Potidaea" id="w">Battle of Potidaea</a>; these two events contributed greatly to Corinth&#39;s lasting hatred of Athens. During the same period, Pericles proposed the <a href="/wiki/Megarian_decree" id="w">Megarian Decree</a>, which resembled a modern trade embargo. According to the provisions of the decree, Megarian merchants were excluded from the market of Athens and the ports in its empire. This ban strangled the Megarian economy and strained the fragile peace between Athens and Sparta, which was allied with Megara. According to George Cawkwell, a <a href="/wiki/Praelector" id="w">praelector</a> in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_history" id="w">ancient history</a>, with this decree Pericles breached the Thirty Years Peace &#34;but, perhaps, not without the semblance of an excuse&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Cawkwell_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cawkwell" title="">[77]</a></sup> The Athenians&#39; justification was that the Megarians had cultivated the sacred land consecrated to <a href="/wiki/Demeter" id="w">Demeter</a> and had given refuge to runaway slaves, a behavior which the Athenians considered to be impious.<sup id="_ref-Buckley322_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Buckley322" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p>After consultations with its allies, Sparta sent a deputation to Athens demanding certain concessions, such as the immediate expulsion of the Alcmaeonidae family including Pericles and the retraction of the Megarian Decree, threatening war if the demands were not met. The obvious purpose of these proposals was the instigation of a confrontation between Pericles and the people; this event, indeed, would come about a few years later.<sup id="_ref-Th127_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th127" title="">[79]</a></sup> At that time, the Athenians unhesitatingly followed Pericles&#39; instructions. In the first legendary oration Thucydides puts in his mouth, Pericles advised the Athenians not to yield to their opponents&#39; demands, since they were militarily stronger.<sup id="_ref-Th140-144_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Th140-144" title="">[80]</a></sup> Pericles was not prepared to make unilateral concessions, believing that &#34;if Athens conceded on that issue, then Sparta was sure to come up with further demands&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Platias100-103_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Platias100-103" title="">[81]</a></sup> Consequently, Pericles asked the Spartans to offer a <i>quid pro quo</i>. In exchange for retracting the Megarian Decree, the Athenians demanded from Sparta to abandon their practice of periodic expulsion of foreigners from their territory (<a href="/wiki/Xenelasia" id="w">xenelasia</a>) and to recognize the autonomy of its allied cities, a request implying that Sparta&#39;s hegemony was also ruthless.<sup id="_ref-Vlachos20_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vlachos20" title="">[82]</a></sup> The terms were rejected by the Spartans, and, with neither side willing to back down, the two sides prepared for war. According to Athanasios G. Platias and Constantinos Koliopoulos, professors of strategic studies and <a href="/wiki/International_politics" id="w">international politics</a>, &#34;rather than to submit to coercive demands, Pericles chose war&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Platias100-103_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Platias100-103" title="">[81]</a></sup> Another consideration that may well have influenced Pericles&#39; stance was the concern that revolts in the empire might spread if Athens showed herself weak.<sup id="_ref-Ehr264_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ehr264" title="">[83]</a></sup></p>

The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a hostile action, the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries.<sup id="_ref-ThII12_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ThII12" title="">[84]</a></sup> With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded <a href="/wiki/Attica" id="w">Attica</a>, but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta&#39;s strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to within the walls of Athens.<sup id="_ref-ThII14_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ThII14" title="">[85]</a></sup></p>
<p>No definite record exists of how exactly Pericles managed to convince the residents of Attica to agree to move into the crowded urban areas.

This promise was prompted by his concern that Archidamus, who was a friend of his, might pass by his estate without ravaging it, either as a gesture of friendship or as a calculated political move aimed to alienate Pericles from his constituents.<sup id="_ref-ThII13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ThII13" title="">[88]</a></sup>

<p>In any case, seeing the pillage of their farms, the Athenians were outraged, and they soon began to indirectly express their discontent towards their leader, who many of them considered to have drawn them into the war. Even in the face of mounting pressure, Pericles did not give in to the demands for immediate action against the enemy or revise his initial strategy. He also avoided convening the ecclesia, fearing that the populace, outraged by the unopposed ravaging of their farms, might rashly decide to challenge the vaunted Spartan army in the field.<sup id="_ref-ThII22_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ThII22" title="">[89]</a></sup> As meetings of the assembly were called at the discretion of its rotating presidents, the &#34;prytanies&#34;, Pericles had no formal control over their scheduling; rather, the respect in which Pericles was held by the prytanies was apparently sufficient to persuade them to do as he wished.<sup id="_ref-KaganPe69_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KaganPe69" title="">[90]</a></sup> While the Spartan army remained in Attica, Pericles sent a fleet of 100 ships to loot the coasts of the <a href="/wiki/Peloponnese" id="w">Peloponnese</a> and charged the cavalry to guard the ravaged farms close to the walls of the city.<sup id="_ref-ThX18_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ThX18" title="">[91]</a></sup> When the enemy retired and the pillaging came to an end, Pericles proposed a decree according to which the authorities of the city should put aside 1,000 talents and 100 ships, in case Athens was attacked by naval forces. According to the most stringent provision of the decree, even proposing a different use of the money or ships would entail the penalty of death. During the autumn of 431 BC, Pericles led the Athenian forces that invaded Megara and a few months later (winter of <a href="/wiki/431_BC" id="w">431 BC</a>-<a href="/wiki/430_BC" id="w">430 BC</a>) he delivered his monumental and emotional <a href="/wiki/Pericles%26%2339%3B_Funeral_Oration" id="w">Funeral Oration</a>, honoring the Athenians who died for their city.<sup id="_ref-ThII35-46_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ThII35-46" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>

<p>Just before his death, Pericles&#39; friends were concentrated around his bed, enumerating his virtues during peace and underscoring his nine war trophies.

<p>Pericles, following Athenian custom, was first married to one of his closest relatives, with whom he had two sons, Xanthippus and Paralus.

<p>The woman he really adored was <a href="/wiki/Aspasia_of_Miletus" id="w">Aspasia of Miletus</a>. She became Pericles&#39; mistress and they began to live together as if they were married.

His greatest personal tragedy was the death of his sister and of both his legitimate sons,  Xanthippus and Paralus, all affected by the epidemic, a calamity he never managed to overcome.

<p>Some contemporary scholars, for example Sarah Ruden, call Pericles a populist, a demagogue and a hawk,<sup id="_ref-Ruden_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ruden" title="">[106]</a></sup> while other scholars admire his charismatic leadership. According to Plutarch, after assuming the leadership of Athens, &#34;he was no longer the same man as before, nor alike submissive to the people and ready to yield and give in to the desires of the multitude as a steersman to the breezes&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Pl15_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl15" title="">[107]</a></sup> It is told that when his political opponent, Thucydides, was asked by Sparta&#39;s king, Archidamus, whether he or Pericles was the better fighter, Thucydides answered without any hesitation that Pericles was better, because even when he was defeated, he managed to convince the audience that he had won.<sup id="_ref-Helios_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Helios" title="">[9]</a></sup> In matters of character, Pericles was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians, since &#34;he kept himself untainted by corruption, although he was not altogether indifferent to money-making&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Pl6_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl6" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thucydides, an admirer of Pericles, maintains that Athens was &#34;in name a democracy but, in fact, governed by its first citizen&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Thuc65_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Thuc65" title="">[100]</a></sup> Through this comment, the historian illustrates what he perceives as Pericles&#39; charisma to lead, convince and, sometimes, to manipulate. Although Thucydides mentions the fining of Pericles, he does not mention the accusations against Pericles but instead focuses on Pericles&#39; integrity.{{Cref}}<sup id="_ref-Thuc65_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Thuc65" title="">[100]</a></sup> On the other hand, in one of his dialogues, <a href="/wiki/Plato" id="w">Plato</a> rejects the glorification of Pericles and quotes <a href="/wiki/Socrates" id="w">Socrates</a> as saying: &#34;As far as I know, Pericles made the Athenians slothful, garrulous and avaricious, by starting the system of public fees&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Gorgias515_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gorgias515" title="">[108]</a></sup>  
Plutarch mentions other criticism of Pericles&#39; leadership: &#34;many others say that the people were first led on by him into allotments of public lands, festival-grants, and distributions of fees for public services, thereby falling into bad habits, and becoming luxurious and wanton under the influence of his public measures, instead of frugal and self-sufficing&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Pl9_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl9" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thucydides argues that Pericles &#34;was not carried away by the people, but he was the one guiding the people&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Thuc65_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Thuc65" title="">[100]</a></sup> His judgement is not unquestioned; some 20th century critics, such as Malcolm F. McGregor and John S. Morrison, proposed that he may have been a charismatic public face acting as an advocate on the proposals of advisors, or the people themselves.<sup id="_ref-McG_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McG" title="">[109]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Morrison76-77_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Morrison76-77" title="">[110]</a></sup> According to King, by increasing the power of the people, the Athenians left themselves with no authoritative leader.

<a id="Military_achievements" name="Military_achievements"></a><h3>Military achievements</h3>
<p>For more than 20 years Pericles led numerous expeditions, mainly naval ones.

Thucydides&#39; modern commentators are still trying to unravel the puzzle of Pericles&#39; orations and to figure out if the wording belongs to the Athenian statesman or the historian.{{Cref}} Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations,{{Cref}} no historians are able answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.{{Cref}} Although Pericles was a main source of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic literary style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides&#39; own cold and analytical writing style.{{Cref}} This might, however, be the result of the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography. That is to say, Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes.</p>
<p>Kagan states that Pericles adopted &#34;an elevated mode of speech, free from the vulgar and knavish tricks of mob-orators&#34; and, according to <a href="/wiki/Diodorus_Siculus" id="w">Diodorus Siculus</a>, he &#34;excelled all his fellow citizens in skill of oratory&#34;.<sup id="_ref-War_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-War" title="">[128]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#_note-129" title="">[129]</a></sup> According to <a href="/wiki/Plutarch" id="w">Plutarch</a>, he avoided using gimmicks in his speeches, unlike the passionate <a href="/wiki/Demosthenes" id="w">Demosthenes</a>, and always spoke in a calm and tranquil manner.<sup id="_ref-Plutarch5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Plutarch5" title="">[130]</a></sup> The biographer points out, however, that the poet <a href="/wiki/Ion_of_Chios" id="w">Ion</a> reported that Pericles&#39; speaking style was &#34;a presumptuous and somewhat arrogant manner of address, and that into his haughtiness there entered a good deal of disdain and contempt for others&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Plutarch5_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Plutarch5" title="">[130]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Gorgias" id="w">Gorgias</a>, in Plato&#39;s homonymous dialogue, uses Pericles as an example of powerful oratory.<sup id="_ref-Gorgias455d_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gorgias455d" title="">[131]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Menexenus" id="w">Menexenus</a>, however, Socrates casts aspersions on Pericles&#39; rhetorical fame, claiming ironically that, since Pericles was educated by Aspasia, a trainer of many orators, he would be superior in rhetoric to someone educated by <a href="/wiki/Antiphon_(person)" id="w">Antiphon</a>.<sup id="_ref-Menexenus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Menexenus" title="">[132]</a></sup> He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries&#39; veneration of Pericles.<sup id="_ref-Monoson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Monoson" title="">[133]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ancient Greek writers call Pericles &#34;Olympian&#34; and vaunt his talents; referring to him &#34;thundering and lightening and exciting Greece&#34; and carrying the weapons of Zeus when orating.<sup id="_ref-ArDi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ArDi" title="">[134]</a></sup> According to <a href="/wiki/Quintilian" id="w">Quintilian</a>, Pericles would always prepare assiduously for his orations and, before going on the rostrum, he would always pray to the Gods, so as not to utter any improper word.<sup id="_ref-Qui_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Qui" title="">[135]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Pl8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pl8" title="">[136]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Richard_Claverhouse_Jebb" id="w">Sir Richard C. Jebb</a> concludes that &#34;unique as an Athenian statesman, Pericles must have been in two respects unique also as an Athenian orator; first, because he occupied such a position of personal ascendancy as no man before or after him attained; secondly, because his thoughts and his moral force won him such renown for eloquence as no one else ever got from Athenians&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Jebb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jebb" title="">[137]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h3>Legacy</h3>

<p>Pericles&#39; most visible legacy can be found in the literary and artistic works of his Golden Age, most of which survive to this day. The Acropolis, though in ruins, still stands and is a symbol of modern Athens. Paparrigopoulos wrote that these masterpieces are &#34;sufficient to render the name of Greece immortal in our world&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Pap_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pap" title="">[120]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In politics, Victor L. Ehrenberg argues that a basic element of Pericles&#39; legacy is Athenian imperialism, which denies true democracy and freedom to the people of all but the ruling state.<sup id="_ref-Ehren332_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ehren332" title="">[138]</a></sup> The promotion of such an arrogant imperialism is said to have ruined Athens.<sup id="_ref-Starr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Starr" title="">[139]</a></sup> Nonetheless, other analysts maintain an Athenian humanism illustrated in the Golden Age.<sup id="_ref-Power_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Power" title="">[140]</a></sup> The freedom of expression is regarded as the lasting legacy deriving from this period.<sup id="_ref-Katula18_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Katula18" title="">[141]</a></sup> Pericles is lauded as &#34;the <a href="/wiki/Ideal_type" id="w">ideal type</a> of the perfect statesman in ancient Greece&#34; and his Funeral Oration is nowadays synonymous with the struggle for participatory democracy and civic pride.<sup id="_ref-Pap_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pap" title="">[120]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Mattson32_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mattson32" title="">[142]</a></sup></p>
