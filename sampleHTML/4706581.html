<p><b>Hurricane Gustav</b> was a <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 2</a> hurricane that paralleled the <a href="/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States" id="w">East Coast of the United States</a> in September during the <a href="/wiki/2002_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">2002 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. Gustav was the seventh named storm and first hurricane of the season. Initially a subtropical depression north of the <a href="/wiki/Bahamas" id="w">Bahamas</a>, Gustav passed slightly to the east of the <a href="/wiki/Outer_Banks" id="w">Outer Banks</a> of <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> as a tropical storm before moving northeastward and making two landfalls in <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Canada" id="w">Atlantic Canada</a> as a Category 1 hurricane. The storm was responsible for one death and $100,000 in damage, mostly in <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a>. The interaction between Gustav and a non-tropical system produced strong winds that caused an additional $240,000 (2002 USD) in damage in <a href="/wiki/New_England" id="w">New England</a>, but this damage was not directly attributed to Gustav.</p>
<p>Gustav spent the early part of its life as a <a href="/wiki/Subtropical_cyclone" id="w">subtropical storm</a>, and was the first such storm to be named from the current lists by the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a>. Previously, subtropical storms were not given names.<sup id="_ref-FAQ_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FAQ" title="">[1]</a></sup> Gustav was also the latest-forming first hurricane of the season since 1941.</p>

An area of disturbed weather in association with a weak <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" id="w">surface trough</a> and a stronger upper-level trough between the <a href="/wiki/Bahamas" id="w">Bahamas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a> developed on <a href="/wiki/September_6" id="w">September 6</a>.<sup id="_ref-TCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TCR" title="">[2]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/High_pressure_area" id="w">High pressure ridging</a> strengthened by <a href="/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Fay_(2002)" id="w">Tropical Storm Fay</a> caused the trough to become more organized and close off into a broad non-tropical low on <a href="/wiki/September_7" id="w">September 7</a>.<sup id="_ref-TCR_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TCR" title="">[2]</a></sup> By <a href="/wiki/September_8" id="w">September 8</a>, the system had developed enough convection near its center of circulation to be classified <a href="/wiki/Subtropical_cyclone" id="w">Subtropical Depression</a> Eight while located southeast of <a href="/wiki/Cape_Hatteras" id="w">Cape Hatteras</a>, <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a>.<sup id="_ref-TCR_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TCR" title="">[2]</a></sup> Later that day, data from a <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Hunter" id="w">Hurricane Hunter</a> reconnaissance aircraft indicated that the system had strengthened into a subtropical storm, and the depression was upgraded to Subtropical Storm Gustav.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gustav moved erratically to the west-northwest toward the <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a>-<a href="/wiki/South_Carolina" id="w">South Carolina</a> border over the next two days, slowly strengthening and acquiring more tropical characteristics.

On <a href="/wiki/September_8" id="w">September 8</a>, forecasters at the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a> predicted that Gustav would approach the <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> coast, and issued a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_watches_and_warnings" id="w">tropical storm watch</a> from <a href="/wiki/Cape_Fear" id="w">Cape Fear</a> to the North Carolina &#8211; <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a> border.

<p>Gustav was the first subtropical storm to be given a name from the <a href="/wiki/Lists_of_tropical_cyclone_names" id="w">current name lists</a> by the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a>. Prior to the 2002 season, Atlantic subtropical storms were either not named or given a name from a separate name list.<sup id="_ref-FAQ_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FAQ" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Gustav attained hurricane status on <a href="/wiki/September_11" id="w">September 11</a>, it became the latest first hurricane to form in any season since <a href="/wiki/1941_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1941</a>, when the first hurricane developed on <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>.
