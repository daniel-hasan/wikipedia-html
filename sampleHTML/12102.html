<div class="thumbcaption">The <a href="/wiki/Renaissance_Center" id="w">Renaissance Center</a> in Detroit, Michigan, is General Motors&#39; world headquarters</div></p>
<p>General Motors (GM) was founded on <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1908" id="w">1908</a> in <a href="/wiki/Flint%2C_Michigan" id="w">Flint, Michigan</a>, as a <a href="/wiki/Holding_company" id="w">holding company</a> for <a href="/wiki/Buick" id="w">Buick</a>, then controlled by <a href="/wiki/William_C._Durant" id="w">William C. Durant</a>, and acquired <a href="/wiki/Oldsmobile" id="w">Oldsmobile</a> later that year. The next year, Durant brought in <a href="/wiki/Cadillac" id="w">Cadillac</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elmore_(automobile)" id="w">Elmore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oakland_automobile" id="w">Oakland</a> (later known as Pontiac) and several others. In 1909, General Motors acquired the Reliance Motor Truck Company of <a href="/wiki/Owosso%2C_Michigan" id="w">Owosso, Michigan</a>, and the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of <a href="/wiki/Pontiac%2C_Michigan" id="w">Pontiac, Michigan</a>, the predecessors of <a href="/wiki/GMC" id="w">GMC</a> Truck. Durant lost control of GM in 1910 to a bankers&#39; trust, because of the large amount of debt taken on in its acquisitions coupled with a collapse in new vehicle sales. A few years later, Durant would start the <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet" id="w">Chevrolet</a> Motor car company and through this he secretly purchased a controlling interest in GM. Durant took back control of the company after one of the most dramatic <a href="/wiki/Proxy_wars" id="w">proxy wars</a> in American business history. Shortly after, he again lost control for good after the new vehicle market collapsed. <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Sloan" id="w">Alfred Sloan</a> was picked to take charge of the corporation and led it to its post war global dominance. This unprecedented growth of GM would last through the late 70&#39;s and into the early 80&#39;s.</p>
<p>The General Motors Aftermarket Business in the US manages four brands; Goodwrench, ACDelco, GM Performance Parts and GM Accessories.  GM Aftersales operates globally.</p>

General Motors was named one of the &#34;100 Best Companies for Working Mothers&#34; in 2004 by <i>Working Mothers</i> magazine. GM has also given millions of dollars in computers to colleges of <a href="/wiki/Engineering" id="w">Engineering</a> through its PACE Awards program.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Together with the <a href="/wiki/United_Auto_Workers" id="w">United Auto Workers</a>, GM created a joint venture dedicated to the quality of life needs of employees in 1985. The UAW-GM Center for Human Resources in <a href="/wiki/Detroit" id="w">Detroit</a> is dedicated to providing GM salaried employees and GM UAW members programs and services related to medical care, diversity issues, education, training and <a href="/wiki/Tuition" id="w">tuition</a> assistance, as well as programs related to work and family concerns, in addition to the traditional union-employer <a href="/wiki/Health_and_safety" id="w">health and safety</a> partnership.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Marketing" name="Marketing"></a><h2> Marketing </h2>
<p>At one time, each of GM&#39;s automotive divisions were targeted to specific market segments and despite some shared components, each distinguished itself from its stablemates with unique styling and technology. The shared components and common corporate management created substantial <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_scale" id="w">economies of scale</a>, while the distinctions between the divisions created an orderly upgrade path, with an entry-level buyer starting out with a practical and economical <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet" id="w">Chevrolet</a> and moving through offerings of the different divisions until the purchase of a <a href="/wiki/Buick" id="w">Buick</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cadillac" id="w">Cadillac</a>.</p>
<p>The postwar automobile industry became enamored with the concept of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Planned_obsolescence" id="w">planned obsolescence</a>&#34;, implemented by both technical and styling innovations with a typical 3-year product cycle. In this cycle, a new basic body shell is introduced and then modified for the next two years with minor styling changes. GM, <a href="/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company" id="w">Ford</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Chrysler_Corporation" id="w">Chrysler</a> competed vigorously in this new restyling environment.</p>
<a id="Distinguishing_the_brands" name="Distinguishing_the_brands"></a><h3> Distinguishing the brands </h3>
<p>By 1958, the divisional distinctions within GM began to blur with the availability of high-performance engines in <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet" id="w">Chevrolets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pontiac" id="w">Pontiacs</a>. The introduction of higher trim models such as the <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Impala" id="w">Chevrolet Impala</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pontiac_Bonneville" id="w">Pontiac Bonneville</a> priced in line with some <a href="/wiki/Oldsmobile" id="w">Oldsmobile</a> and <a href="/wiki/Buick" id="w">Buick</a> offerings was also confusing to consumers. By the time <a href="/wiki/Pontiac" id="w">Pontiac</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oldsmobile" id="w">Oldsmobile</a> and <a href="/wiki/Buick" id="w">Buick</a> introduced similarly styled and priced compact models in 1961, the old &#34;step-up&#34; structure between the divisions was nearly over.</p>
<a id="Compacts_arrive" name="Compacts_arrive"></a><h3> Compacts arrive </h3>
<p>The 1960s saw the creation of compact and intermediate classes. The <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvair" id="w">Chevrolet Corvair</a> was a 6-cylinder answer to the <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle" id="w">Volkswagen Beetle</a>, the Chevy II was created to match Ford&#39;s conventional <a href="/wiki/Ford_Falcon_(North_America)" id="w">Falcon</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Camaro" id="w">Chevrolet Camaro</a>/<a href="/wiki/Pontiac_Firebird" id="w">Pontiac Firebird</a> was GMs counter measure to the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Mustang" id="w">Ford Mustang</a>. Among intermediates, the <a href="/wiki/Oldsmobile_Cutlass" id="w">Oldsmobile Cutlass</a> nameplate became so popular during the 1970s that <a href="/wiki/Oldsmobile" id="w">Oldsmobile</a> applied the Cutlass name to most of its products in the 1980s. By the mid 1960s, most of GM&#39;s vehicles were built on a few common <i>platforms</i> and in the 1970s GM began to use nearly identical body panel stampings, differing only in internal and external trim items. </p>
<p>The 1971 <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Vega" id="w">Chevrolet Vega</a> was GMs launch into the new subcompact class. Problems associated with its innovative <a href="/wiki/Aluminum" id="w">aluminum</a> engines would damage GMs reputation more than perhaps any other vehicle in its history. During the late 1970s, GM would initiate a wave of <a href="/wiki/Downsizing" id="w">downsizing</a> starting with the <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Caprice" id="w">Chevrolet Caprice</a> which was reborn into what was the size of the <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Chevelle" id="w">Chevrolet Chevelle</a>, the Malibu would be the size of the Nova, and the Nova was replaced by the troubled front-wheel drive <a href="/wiki/Citation" id="w">Citation</a>.</p>
<a id="Rebadging_era" name="Rebadging_era"></a><h3> Rebadging era </h3>
<p>By the 1980s, GM frequently &#34;rebadged&#34; one division&#39;s successful vehicle into several models across the divisions, all positioned close to one another in the market place. Thus a new GM model&#39;s main competition might be another model spawned off the same platform. This led to market &#34;<a href="/wiki/Cannibal#Other uses of the word" id="w">cannibalization</a>&#34; with the divisions spending time stealing sales from one another. Even today, the company&#39;s GMT360 mid-sized light truck platform has spawned the basic <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Trailblazer" id="w">Chevrolet Trailblazer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oldsmobile_Bravada" id="w">Oldsmobile Bravada</a>, <a href="/wiki/GMC_Envoy" id="w">GMC Envoy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Isuzu_Ascender" id="w">Isuzu Ascender</a>, <a href="/wiki/Buick_Rainier" id="w">Buick Rainier</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saab_9-7X" id="w">Saab 9-7X</a>. Though each model had a more or less distinct mission, the trucks can hardly be discerned from one another. </p>
<a id="GM_in_the_new_century" name="GM_in_the_new_century"></a><h3> GM in the new century </h3>
<p>In the late 1990s, the U.S. economy was on the rise and GM and <a href="/wiki/Ford" id="w">Ford</a> gained market share producing enormous profits primarily from the sale of light trucks and sport-utility vehicles.  From 2000 to 2001, the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Reserve" id="w">Federal Reserve</a> in a move to quell the stock market, made twelve successive interest rate increases. Following the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks" id="w">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, a severe stock market decline caused a pension and benefit fund underfunding crisis.   GM began its <i>Keep America Rolling</i> campaign, which boosted sales, and other auto makers were forced to follow suit. The U.S. automakers saw sales increase to leverage costs as gross margins deteriorated.  Although retiree health care costs remain a significant issue, General Motors&#39; investment strategy has generated a $17.1 billion surplus in 2007 in its $101 billion U.S pension fund portfolio, a $35 billion reversal from its $17.8 billion of underfunding.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2004, GM redirected resources from the development of new sedans to an accelerated refurbishment of their light trucks and <a href="/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle" id="w">SUVs</a> for introduction as 2007 models in early 2006. Shortly after this decision, fuel prices increased by over 50% and this in turn affected both the trade-in value of used vehicles and the perceived desirability of new offerings in these market segments. The current marketing plan is to extensively tout these revised vehicles as offering the best fuel economy <i>in their class</i> (of vehicle). GM claims its hybrid trucks will have gas-mileage improvements of 25%. </p>
<p>In the summer of 2005, GM announced that its corporate chrome emblem &#34;<a href="/wiki/Mark_of_Excellence" id="w">Mark of Excellence</a>&#34; will begin appearing on all recently introduced and all-new 2006 model vehicles produced and sold in North America. The move is seen as an attempt by GM to link its name and vehicle brands more closely. </p>
<p>In 2005, GM promoted sales through an employee discount to all buyers. Marketed as the lowest possible price, GM cleared an inventory buildup of 2005 models to make way for its 2006 lineup. While the promotion was a temporary shot in the arm for sales, it did not help the company&#39;s bottom line. GM has since changed its marketing strategy to a no haggle sticker policy in which all vehicle prices are lowered, but incentives are reduced, if not eliminated.</p>
<a id="GM_in_China" name="GM_in_China"></a><h3> GM in China </h3>
<p>General Motors is the best selling auto maker in <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Buick" id="w">Buick</a> brand is especially strong, led by the <a href="/wiki/Buick_Excelle" id="w">Buick Excelle</a> subcompact. <a href="/wiki/Cadillac" id="w">Cadillac</a> initiated sales in <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> in 2004, starting with imports from the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. GM pushed the marketing of the <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet" id="w">Chevrolet</a> brand in <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> in 2005 as well, moving the former <a href="/wiki/Buick_Sail" id="w">Buick Sail</a> to that marque. The company manufactures most of its China-market vehicles locally, through its <a href="/wiki/Shanghai_GM" id="w">Shanghai GM</a> joint venture.  Shanghai GM, a joint venture between the Chinese company SAIC and General Motors, was created on March 25, 1997.  The Shanghai GM plant was opened December 15, 1998 when the first Chinese-built Buick came off the assembly line.  The <a href="/wiki/SAIC-GM-Wuling_Automobile" id="w">SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile</a> joint-venture is also successful selling trucks and vans under the <a href="/wiki/SAIC-GM-Wuling_Automobile" id="w">Wuling</a> marque.GM plans to create a research facility in Shanghai for $250m to develop hybrid cars and alternative energy vehicles.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Labor_relations" name="Labor_relations"></a><h2> Labor relations </h2>
<p>{{main}}   
On September 24, 2007 General Motors workers represented by the <a href="/wiki/United_Auto_Workers" id="w">United Auto Workers</a> union went on the first nationwide strike against GM since 1970. The ripple effect of the strike reached into Canada the following day as two car assembly plants and a transmission facility were forced to close.  However overnight a tentative agreement was reached and UAW officials declared the end of the strike in a news conference at 4 a.m. on September 26.  By the following day, all GM workers in both countries were back to work.</p>
<a id="Outcome_of_Strike" name="Outcome_of_Strike"></a><h3> Outcome of Strike </h3>
<p>A new labor contract was ratified by UAW members exactly one week after the tentative agreement was reached, passing by a majority 62% vote. In the contract are several product and employment guarantees stretching well into the next decade. One of GM&#39;s key future products, the Chevy Volt, was promised to the GM Poletown/Detroit-Hamtramack plant in 2010. Also included is a VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association) which will transfer retiree health care obligations to the UAW by 2010. This eliminates more than 50 billion dollars from GM&#39;s healthcare tab. It will be funded by 30 billion in cash and 1.4 billion in GM stock paid to the UAW over the next 4 years of the contract. It also eliminates 70% of the labor cost gap with GM&#39;s Japanese rivals.</p>

<p>General Motors is both active in environmental causes and, as a major industrial force, implicated in ecologically harmful activity. The company has long worked on alternative-technology vehicles, and has recently led the industry with clean burning Flexfuel vehicles that can run on either E-85 (ethanol) or <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" id="w">gasoline</a>.

<p>The process of obtaining the EV1, GM&#39;s first electric vehicle, was difficult. The vehicle could not be purchased outright. Instead, General Motors offered a closed-end lease for three years, with no renewal or residual purchase options.   The EV1 was only available from specialist Saturn dealerships, and only in California and Arizona.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/general-motors-ev1" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.answers.com/topic/general-motors-ev1">http://www.answers.com/topic/general-motors-ev1</a> Before reviewing leasing options, a potential lessee would be taken through a &#39;pre-qualification&#39; process in order to learn how the EV1 was different from other vehicles.

<p>Several weeks before the debut of the movie, the <a href="/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution" id="w">Smithsonian Institution</a> announced that its EV1 display was being permanently removed and the EV1 car put into storage. GM is a major financial contributor to the museum, but both parties denied that this fact contributed to the removal of the display.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060711/AUTO01/607110368/1148" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060711/AUTO01/607110368/1148">http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060711/AUTO01/607110368/1148</a></p>
<p>General Motors has responded to complaints about the scrapping of the EV1 program and they dispute the existence of any conspiracy surrounding its demise.  An entry was posted on the <a class="externallink" href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/">GM FastLane Blog</a> in 2006 in which GM defended its decision by saying that it was unable to guarantee the vehicles could continue to be maintained in a safe operating state. <a class="externallink" href="http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html">http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html</a>  </p>
<p>GM alleges that during the four years available to the public, only 800 EV1&#39;s were released. Over $1 billion was spent on the EV1 program, with a great portion used for consumer incentives and marketing. With a waiting list of 5,000 applicants, only 50 individuals actually were willing to accept a lease on the EV1. Suppliers ceased production of replacement parts due to the low demand for the EV1.  This made repairs and continued safety of the vehicles difficult. The EV1 was designed as a developmental vehicle and was never intended for serial production. </p>
<p>The limitations of storage technology and the expense of production would have made the cars impractical for the vast majority of consumers; a production EV1 would have met limited demand and would have been priced out of reach of most. Had sufficient demand existed to justify mass production and had costs and technologies been able to support mass production, GM would have been more receptive to the idea. </p>
<p>General Motors (GM) has responded to allegations made in the film through a blog post entitled <a class="externallink" href="http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html">&#39;&#39;Who Ignored the Facts About the Electric Car?&#39;&#39;</a>. In it, Dave Barthmuss writes: &#34;Sadly, despite the substantial investment of money and the enthusiastic fervor of a relatively small number of EV1 drivers — including the filmmaker — the EV1 proved far from a viable commercial success.&#34; Barthmuss notes investments in electric vehicle technology since the EV1: <a href="/wiki/Two-Mode_Hybrid" id="w">Two-Mode Hybrid</a>, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell vehicle programs.  The filmmakers suggested that GM did not immediately channel its technological progress with the EV1 into these projects, and instead let the technology languish while focusing on more immediately profitable enterprises such as SUVs. Contrary to this suggestion, as Barthmuss points out, GM is bullish on hydrogen:</p>
<p>According to GM, not all of the EV1&#39;s were destroyed.  Many were donated to research institutions and facilities, along with museums. Some are still owned by General Motors themselves, and are kept at their Technical Design center in <a href="/wiki/Warren%2C_Michigan" id="w">Warren, Michigan</a>, and can occasionally be seen on the road within a close area of the tech center. <a class="externallink" href="http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html">http://fyi.gmblogs.com/2006/06/who_ignored_the_facts_about_th.html</a></p>

<a id="Corporate_restructuring" name="Corporate_restructuring"></a><h2> Corporate restructuring </h2>
<p>After gaining market share in the late 1990s and making enormous profits General Motors stock soared to over $80 a share. However, in 2000, twelve successive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve led to a severe stock market decline following the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks" id="w">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, caused a pension and benefit funds crisis at General Motors and many other American companies. General Motor&#39;s rising retiree health care costs and Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) fund deficit prompted the company to enact a broad restructuring plan.  Although GM had already taken action to fully fund its pension plan, its OPEB fund became an issue for its corporate bond ratings. GM had expressed its disagreement with the bond ratings; moveover, GM&#39;s benefit funds were performing at higher than expected rates of return.  Then, following a $10.6 billion loss in 2005, GM acted quickly to implement its restructuring plan. For the first quarter of 2006 GM earned $400 million, signaling a turnaround had already begun even though many aspects of the restructuring plan had not yet taken effect. Although retiree health care costs remain a significant issue, General Motors&#39; investment strategy has generated a $17.1 billion surplus in 2007 in its $101 billion U.S pension fund portfolio, a $35 billion reversal from its $17.8 billion of underfunding.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>In February 2005, GM successfully bought itself out of a put option with <a href="/wiki/Fiat" id="w">Fiat</a> for $2 billion USD (€1.55 billion).

As part of the deal, GM granted <a href="/wiki/Fiat" id="w">Fiat</a> a <a href="/wiki/Put_option" id="w">put option</a> which, if exercised between January 2004 and July 2009, could have forced GM to buy <a href="/wiki/Fiat" id="w">Fiat</a>.
