<p>Construction began in <a href="/wiki/National_City%2C_California" id="w">National City</a>, just south of San Diego, in 1881, and proceeded northward to the present day city of <a href="/wiki/Oceanside%2C_California" id="w">Oceanside</a>.  From there, the line turned to the northeast through <a href="/wiki/Temecula_Canyon" id="w">Temecula Canyon</a>, then on to the present cities of <a href="/wiki/Lake_Elsinore%2C_California" id="w">Lake Elsinore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Perris%2C_California" id="w">Perris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Riverside%2C_California" id="w">Riverside</a> before a connection to the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Pacific_Railroad" id="w">Southern Pacific Railroad</a> (SP) in <a href="/wiki/Colton%2C_California" id="w">Colton</a>.

<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1> History </h1>
<p>The California Southern was organized on <a href="/wiki/July_10" id="w">July 10</a> <a href="/wiki/1880" id="w">1880</a>, as a means to connect San Diego to a connection with the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad at an as-yet undetermined point.  Among the organizers were <a href="/wiki/Frank_Kimball" id="w">Frank Kimball</a>, a prominent landowner and rancher from San Diego who also represented the Chamber of Commerce and the Board of City Trustees of San Diego, <a href="/wiki/Kidder%2C_Peabody_and_Company" id="w">Kidder, Peabody and Company</a>, one of the main financial investment companies involved in the <a href="/wiki/Atchison%2C_Topeka_and_Santa_Fe_Railway" id="w">Santa Fe</a>, <a href="/wiki/B.P._Cheney" id="w">B.P.

Wilbur</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Nickerson_(ATSF)" id="w">Thomas Nickerson</a> who was president of the Santa Fe.  The organizers set a deadline of <a href="/wiki/January_1" id="w">January 1</a> <a href="/wiki/1884" id="w">1884</a> to complete the connection, a deadline that was later adjusted due to problems in the construction of the Atlantic and Pacific that forced it to stop at <a href="/wiki/Needles%2C_California" id="w">Needles, California</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The California Southern built its track northward from a point in National City, south of San Diego.  The route, portions of which are still in use, connected the present day cities of National City, San Diego, <a href="/wiki/Fallbrook%2C_California" id="w">Fallbrook</a>, <a href="/wiki/Temecula%2C_California" id="w">Temecula</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lake_Elsinore%2C_California" id="w">Lake Elsinore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Perris%2C_California" id="w">Perris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Riverside%2C_California" id="w">Riverside</a>, <a href="/wiki/San_Bernardino%2C_California" id="w">San Bernardino</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colton%2C_California" id="w">Colton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cajon%2C_California" id="w">Cajon</a> (not to be confused with <a href="/wiki/El_Cajon%2C_California" id="w">El Cajon</a>), <a href="/wiki/Victorville%2C_California" id="w">Victorville</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barstow%2C_California" id="w">Barstow</a>.</p>
<p>In Barstow, then known as Waterman, the California Southern would connect to another Santa Fe subsidiary, the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_and_Pacific_Railroad" id="w">Atlantic and Pacific Railroad</a>.  The Atlantic and Pacific was chartered in 1866 to build a railroad connection westward from <a href="/wiki/Springfield%2C_Missouri" id="w">Springfield, Missouri</a>, connecting <a href="/wiki/Albuquerque%2C_New_Mexico" id="w">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>, then along the 35th <a href="/wiki/Circle_of_latitude" id="w">parallel</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Colorado_River" id="w">Colorado River</a>.  From there, the railroad was to continue to the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a> following whatever proved to be the best route.  The route was scheduled to be completed by <a href="/wiki/July_4" id="w">July 4</a> <a href="/wiki/1878" id="w">1878</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  However, the Southern Pacific was able to get a clause favorable to their own interests inserted into the charter:</p>
<dl><dd>&#34;... the Southern Pacific Railroad ... is hereby authorized to connect with the said Atlantic and Pacific railroad formed under this act, at such point, near the boundary line of the State of California, as they shall deem most suitable for a railroad line to San Francisco.&#34;<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Southern Pacific had already established a connection to <a href="/wiki/Mojave%2C_California" id="w">Mojave</a>, so their crews built eastward from there through Barstow (then called Waterman) to <a href="/wiki/Needles%2C_California" id="w">Needles, California</a>, completing the connection across the Colorado River on <a href="/wiki/August_3" id="w">August 3</a> <a href="/wiki/1883" id="w">1883</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The California segment was leased to the Santa Fe in August 1884,<sup id="_ref-W73_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-W73" title="">[6]</a></sup> and fully acquired by the Santa Fe under foreclosure in 1897.</p>

The California Southern began construction in National City on land originally acquired by <a href="/wiki/Frank_Kimball" id="w">Frank Kimball</a>.  The railroad&#39;s main <a href="/wiki/Classification_yard" id="w">yards</a> and <a href="/wiki/Locomotive" id="w">locomotive</a> maintenance shops were located here, and until the connection was made with Barstow, all tools and equipment ordered by the railroad arrived here by ship around <a href="/wiki/Cape_Horn" id="w">Cape Horn</a> from points in the eastern <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, while the wooden <a href="/wiki/Railroad_tie" id="w">ties</a> arrived by ship from <a href="/wiki/Oregon" id="w">Oregon</a>.<sup id="_ref-Fallbrook Line_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fallbrook Line" title="">[7]</a></sup> Surveys and construction between National City and San Diego were well underway by March 1881. The railroad reached Fallbrook and opened between there and San Diego in January 1882.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1881 and 1882, the California Southern received ten locomotive shipments by sea at National City.  The last three of these, delivered in November 1882 aboard the ship <i>Anna Camp</i>, have been identified as the last three locomotives ever delivered to the United States Pacific coast after traveling around Cape Horn.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Temecula_Canyon" name="Temecula_Canyon"></a><h2> Temecula Canyon </h2>
<p>In order to connect to the Atlantic and Pacific line in the quickest way possible, surveyors and engineers for the California Southern pushed the route through <a href="/wiki/Fallbrook%2C_California" id="w">Fallbrook</a> and <a href="/wiki/Temecula%2C_California" id="w">Temecula</a>, bypassing what was at the time the pueblo of Los Angeles.  What the railroad didn&#39;t understand was the nature of Southern California&#39;s dry washes.  The local inhabitants told the railroad of the dangers of building through such an area, that it could become a raging torrent of water, but the railroad built through the canyon anyway.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the warnings, track work through the canyon proceeded at a quick pace.  The line was completed to Fallbrook on <a href="/wiki/January_2" id="w">January 2</a> <a href="/wiki/1882" id="w">1882</a>, then to Temecula on <a href="/wiki/March_27" id="w">March 27</a> <a href="/wiki/1882" id="w">1882</a>.<sup id="_ref-D&K27_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-D&K27" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many parts of the canyon had suffered storms. In February 1884 a storm hit. The train was delayed and the canyon walls brought boulders crashing down on the rails. On <a href="/wiki/February_3" id="w">February 3</a>, the train was unable to get through. A few days later, the wires were down. The train from Colton to <a href="/wiki/San_Diego" id="w">San Diego</a> was unable to get through. Disaster had been averted because young Charlie Howell hurried up the tracks from his family homestead near Willow Glen and somehow managed to stop the train.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>  A series of devastating <a href="/wiki/Washout" id="w">washouts</a> on the section through Temecula Canyon occurred amid heavy rain storms that flooded the area starting on <a href="/wiki/February_16" id="w">February 16</a> <a href="/wiki/1884" id="w">1884</a>, just six months after the first trains operated the entire route between San Diego and San Bernardino.  The storms brought more than 40&#160;inches of rain in a four-week period.  Two thirds of the mainline through the canyon were washed out with ties seen floating as far as {{mi to km}} away in the ocean.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>  Temporary track repairs were made after the first storms, but later in the month, additional rains and flooding washed out the entire route through the canyon.  Repairs were estimated at nearly <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">$320</a>,000, a figure that could not be recouped effectively.<sup id="_ref-W73_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-W73" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The canyon was finally bypassed completely with the completion of the <a href="/wiki/Surf_Line" id="w">Surf Line</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_12" id="w">August 12</a> <a href="/wiki/1888" id="w">1888</a>, and the line through the canyon was relegated to <a href="/wiki/Branch_line" id="w">branch line</a> status.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_crossing_at_Colton" name="The_crossing_at_Colton"></a><h2> The crossing at Colton </h2>
<p>Construction of the California Southern was repeatedly interrupted by Santa Fe&#39;s rival, <a href="/wiki/Southern_Pacific_Railroad" id="w">Southern Pacific Railroad</a> (SP).  In one instance, the California Southern was to build a <a href="/wiki/Level_junction" id="w">level junction</a> across the SP tracks in <a href="/wiki/Colton%2C_California" id="w">Colton</a>, a crossing which still exists today.  California Southern engineer <a href="/wiki/Fred_T._Perris" id="w">Fred T. Perris</a> ordered the crossing built and acquired the track section for the railroad.  When the track was delivered to <a href="/wiki/National_City%2C_California" id="w">National City</a> in July 1883, SP officials hired the sheriff there to seize the track section and prevent its installation.  The sheriff kept the track under 24-hour guard, but Perris&#39;s men were able to retake the track while the sheriff napped, loaded the track on a <a href="/wiki/Flatcar" id="w">flatcar</a> and started northward with it toward Colton, where it was to be installed.</p>
<p>Perris had obtained a court order on <a href="/wiki/August_11" id="w">August 11</a> <a href="/wiki/1883" id="w">1883</a>, that would legally allow the California Southern to install the new track section, and his crew was ready to install it as soon as SP&#39;s <i>Overland Mail</i> passed the point of intersection between the two railroads.  However, at that moment an SP <a href="/wiki/Locomotive" id="w">locomotive</a> arrived at the scene pulling a single <a href="/wiki/Gondola_(rail)" id="w">gondola</a> and stopped.  The engineer of the SP locomotive then drove the train back and forth slowly at the crossing point in an effort to prevent the California Southern crew from installing the crossing.  It was believed that the gondola held a number of SP men with rifles and other weapons who crouched below the walls of the car so as not to be seen.<sup id="_ref-D&K27_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-D&K27" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jacob_Nash_Victor" id="w">Jacob Nash Victor</a>, another California Southern construction engineer, was the foreman at Colton.  In a letter that Victor wrote to <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Nickerson_(ATSF)" id="w">Thomas Nickerson</a>, then president of the California Southern, he stated:</p>
<dl><dd>&#34;I thought it advisable to have final order of court printed and each SP employee served.  It was also asserted that headquarters at San Francisco had not received the final order. The danger of a riot was so imminent, by legal advice I had the order telegraphed to the Sheriff at SF to serve on the President or Secy. ... In the meantime the Sheriff [in Colton] had organized a posse, with arms and was waiting for order of court to clear the track, on our application.&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The major investors in <a href="/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, were mostly replaced by investors from <a href="/wiki/New_York%2C_New_York" id="w">New York</a> and <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> at the annual meeting on <a href="/wiki/May_9" id="w">May 9</a>.  The investors replaced the company&#39;s board of directors with a new board that included <a href="/wiki/George_C._Magoun" id="w">George C. Magoun</a> (who would later be linked with the company&#39;s 1893 receivership).  The new investors disliked the number of subsidiary companies and sought to further consolidate them.  The California Southern, California Central and <a href="/wiki/Redondo_Beach_Railway" id="w">Redondo Beach Railway</a> companies were consolidated into the <a href="/wiki/Southern_California_Railway" id="w">Southern California Railway</a> on <a href="/wiki/November_7" id="w">November 7</a> <a href="/wiki/1889" id="w">1889</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>  The Santa Fe finally purchased outright the holdings of the Southern California railroad on <a href="/wiki/January_17" id="w">January 17</a> <a href="/wiki/1906" id="w">1906</a>, ending the railway&#39;s subsidiary status and making it fully a part of the Santa Fe railroad.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p>Much of the original <a href="/wiki/Right-of-way_(railroad)" id="w">right-of-way</a> graded and used by the California Southern is still in active daily use by contemporary railroad companies.  Several structures originally built for or by the railroad, or in some cases the remains of these structures, can also still be seen along the line.  Some of the buildings that remain are still in use in their primary purposes.</p>

The two ends of the former railroad are still in use as of 2006.  The section between Barstow and Riverside through <a href="/wiki/Cajon_Pass" id="w">Cajon Pass</a>, which includes the disputed <a href="/wiki/Colton_Crossing" id="w">crossing in Colton</a>, remains one of the busiest rail freight corridors in the United States, seeing trains of <a href="/wiki/BNSF_Railway" id="w">BNSF Railway</a> and <a href="/wiki/Union_Pacific_Railroad" id="w">Union Pacific Railroad</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Amtrak" id="w">Amtrak</a>&#39;s daily <i><a href="/wiki/Southwest_Chief" id="w">Southwest Chief</a></i> passenger train.  At Cajon, the concrete pads that once served as the <a href="/wiki/Slab-on-grade_foundation" id="w">foundations</a> for the railroad&#39;s station facilities and water tanks there still remain long after the buildings that were atop them have been removed.  Not all of the track through Cajon Pass is in its original 1885 location.  The Santa Fe made a few realignments of track through the pass during the 20th century to straighten some curves along <a href="/wiki/Cajon_Creek" id="w">Cajon Creek</a> (between Cajon and San Bernardino), lower gradients for eastbound trains with the addition of a separate track through what has come to be known as <a href="/wiki/Sullivan%26%2339%3Bs_Curve" id="w">Sullivan&#39;s Curve</a>, and to reduce some curvatures and lower the pass&#39;s overall summit elevation by 50&#160;<a href="/wiki/Foot_(unit_of_length)" id="w">ft</a> (15&#160;<a href="/wiki/Metre" id="w">m</a>).</p>
<p>The maintenance shops in San Bernardino are still in use by BNSF Railway, although not to the extent that they were used in the 20th century.  The <a href="/wiki/San_Bernardino_(Amtrak_station)" id="w">San Bernardino station</a> that was opened by the California Southern was destroyed by fire on <a href="/wiki/November_16" id="w">November 16</a> <a href="/wiki/1916" id="w">1916</a>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> It was replaced in 1918<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> by the Santa Fe with the current structure that now serves <a href="/wiki/Metrolink_(Southern_California)" id="w">Metrolink</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Metrolink_San_Bernardino_Line" id="w">San Bernardino Line</a> commuter trains on runs that terminate at <a href="/wiki/Union_Station_(Los_Angeles)" id="w">Los Angeles Union Station</a>.  Limited service from San Bernardino to Riverside is provided by some San Bernardino Line trains, and the <a href="/wiki/Metrolink_Riverside_Line" id="w">Metrolink Riverside Line</a> terminates at the Riverside station although it reaches the station via a more southerly route.  South of Riverside, the track is still in place to Perris, where the <a href="/wiki/Orange_Empire_Railway_Museum" id="w">Orange Empire Railway Museum</a> resides with a connection to the mainline.</p>

At the southern end, the section between San Diego and Oceanside also sees heavy use by <a href="/wiki/Amtrak_California" id="w">Amtrak California</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Pacific_Surfliner" id="w">Pacific Surfliner</a></i> trains as well as those of the <a href="/wiki/San_Diego_Coaster" id="w">San Diego Coaster</a>.
