<p>The son of Simon Cantrell (1658–1744), he was educated at <a href="/wiki/Derby_School" id="w">Derby School</a> (where a relation, the Rev. Thomas Cantrell, 1649-1698, was headmaster)<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Emmanuel_College%2C_Cambridge" id="w">Emmanuel College, Cambridge</a>. He matriculated at Cambridge in 1701, graduated <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts" id="w">BA</a> in 1705 and <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(Oxford%2C_Cambridge_and_Dublin)" id="w">MA</a> in 1710<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dnb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Cantrell was ordained a <a href="/wiki/Priest" id="w">priest</a> at <a href="/wiki/Lichfield" id="w">Lichfield</a> in 1709. In 1712, the corporation of <a href="/wiki/Derby" id="w">Derby</a> gave him the vicarage of St Alkmund, Derby<sup id="_ref-dnb_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[3]</a></sup>, a living he kept for more than sixty stormy years, until his death at the age of eighty-nine. </p>
<p>Cantrell had a quarrelsome nature, and even before his induction as Vicar of St Alkmund&#39;s parish he fell out with its vestry, insisting on exercising his right to appoint one of the two churchwardens for the parish<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dnb_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[3]</a></sup>. Within months of his appointment, he was preaching against non-conformity, claiming that:</p>

<p>He refused to bury children baptized by dissenters, which led to a furious controversy in Derby. In any event, Cantrell&#39;s bishop refused to support his stance.<sup id="_ref-dnb_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>One of Cantrell&#39;s best-known works was a scholarly dissertation denying the claim by the <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian" id="w">Presbyterian</a> minister Ferdinando Shaw that <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" id="w">King Charles I</a> had been baptized only by a Presbyterian and never by an <a href="/wiki/Anglicanism" id="w">Episcopal</a> minister.<sup id="_ref-dnb_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Cantrell was often embattled in defending his clerical rights, including the right to plant trees in the churchyard, to control the contents of the parish register, and so forth, generally claiming the matter in hand was about an important principle and part of a wider defence of clerical rights.<sup id="_ref-dnb_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[3]</a></sup> In 1729, he defeated the Corporation of Derby (the patrons of his living) in a legal battle over the parish&#39;s small tithes, which the Corporation had taken away from him for insulting the Mayor of Derby. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>When his battles led to the forced sale of much of his library, he was offered the vicarage of <a href="/wiki/Brecon" id="w">Brecon</a> through the influence of <a href="/wiki/Henry_Sacheverell" id="w">Dr Henry Sacheverell</a>, but declined it.<sup id="_ref-dnb_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When Cantrell granted a licence for the secret marriage of Annabella Wilmot of <a href="/wiki/Osmaston" id="w">Osmaston</a>, Derbyshire, this led to the Ecclesiastical Courts Bill 1733.<sup id="_ref-dnb_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Doubt has been cast on the claim in William Hutton&#39;s <i>History of Derby</i> (1791) that at the time of the <a href="/wiki/Jacobite_rising" id="w">Jacobite rising</a> in <a href="/wiki/1745" id="w">1745</a> Cantrell was a Jacobite and drank the health of the <a href="/wiki/James_Francis_Edward_Stuart" id="w">Old Pretender</a>.<sup id="_ref-dnb_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hutton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hutton" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
