<b>Distribution</b> (or <b>placement</b>) is one of the four aspects of <a href="/wiki/Marketing" id="w">marketing</a>. A distributor is the <a href="/wiki/Middleman" id="w">middleman</a> between the manufacturer and retailer. After a product is manufactured it is typically shipped (and usually sold) to a distributor. The distributor then sells the product to <a href="/wiki/Retailer" id="w">retailers</a> or customers.</p>

<a id="The_distribution_channel" name="The_distribution_channel"></a><h2>The distribution channel </h2>

<p>Frequently there may be a chain of intermediaries, each passing the product down the chain to the next organization, before it finally reaches the consumer or end-user. This process is known as the &#39;distribution chain&#39; or the &#39;channel.&#39; Each of the elements in these chains will have their own specific needs, which the producer must take into account, along with those of the all-important end-user.</p>
<a id="Channels" name="Channels"></a><h3>Channels</h3>

<p>A number of alternate &#39;channels&#39; of distribution may be available:</p>

<ul>
<li>Selling direct, such as via mail order, Internet and telephone sales</li>
<li>Agent, who typically sells direct on behalf of the producer</li>
<li>Distributor (also called wholesaler), who sells to retailers</li>
<li>Retailer (also called <a href="/wiki/Dealer" id="w">dealer</a> or <a href="/wiki/Reseller" id="w">reseller</a>), who sells to end customers</li>
<li>Advertisement typically used for consumption goods</li></ul>
<p>Distribution channels may not be restricted to physical products alone. They may be just as important for moving a service from producer to consumer in certain sectors, since both direct and indirect channels may be used. Hotels, for example, may sell their services (typically rooms) directly or through travel agents, tour operators, airlines, tourist boards, centralized reservation systems, etc.</p>
<p>There have also been some innovations in the distribution of services. For example, there has been an increase in <a href="/wiki/Franchising" id="w">franchising</a> and in rental services - the latter offering anything from televisions through tools. There has also been some evidence of service integration, with services linking together, particularly in the travel and tourism sectors. For example, links now exist between airlines, hotels and car rental services. In addition, there has been a significant increase in retail outlets for the service sector. Outlets such as estate agencies and building society offices are crowding out traditional grocers from major shopping areas.</p>
<a id="Channel_members" name="Channel_members"></a><h3>Channel members</h3>

<p>Distribution channels can thus have a number of levels. Kotler defined the simplest level, that of direct contact with no intermediaries involved, as the &#39;zero-level&#39; channel.</p>
<p>The next level, the &#39;one-level&#39; channel, features just one intermediary; in consumer goods a retailer, for industrial goods a distributor. In small markets (such as small countries) it is practical to reach the whole market using just one- and zero-level channels.</p>
<p>In large markets (such as larger countries) a second level, a wholesaler for example, is now mainly used to extend distribution to the large number of small, neighborhood retailers.</p>
<p>In Japan the chain of distribution is often complex and further levels are used, even for the simplest of consumer goods.</p>
<p>In Bangladesh Telecom Operators are using different Chains of Distribution, especially &#39;second level&#39;.</p>
<p>In IT and Telecom industry levels are named &#34;tiers&#34;. A one tier channel means that vendors <a href="/wiki/Information_Technology" id="w">IT</a> product manufacturers (or software publishers) work directly with the dealers. A one tier / two tier channel means that vendors work directly with dealers and with distributors who sell to dealers.</p>
<a id="The_internal_market" name="The_internal_market"></a><h3>The internal market</h3>
<p>Many of the marketing principles and techniques which are applied to the external customers of an organization can be just as effectively applied to each subsidiary&#39;s, or each department&#39;s, &#39;internal&#39; customers.</p>
<p>In some parts of certain organizations this may in fact be formalized, as goods are transferred between separate parts of the organization at a `transfer price&#39;. To all intents and purposes, with the possible exception of the pricing mechanism itself, this process can and should be viewed as a normal buyer-seller relationship. The fact that this is a captive market, resulting in a `monopoly price&#39;, should not discourage the participants from employing marketing techniques.</p>
<p>Less obvious, but just as practical, is the use of `marketing&#39; by service and administrative departments; to optimize their contribution to their `customers&#39; (the rest of the organization 
in general, and those parts of it which deal directly with them in particular). In all of this, the lessons of the non-profit organizations, in dealing with their clients, offer a very useful parallel.</p>
<a id="Channel_Decisions" name="Channel_Decisions"></a><h3>Channel Decisions</h3>


<ul>
<li>Channel strategy</li>
<li>Product (or service)&#60;&#62;Cost&#60;&#62;Consumer location</li></ul>
<a id="Channel_management" name="Channel_management"></a><h2>Channel management </h2>
<p>The channel decision is very important. In theory at least, there is a form of trade-off: the cost of using intermediaries to achieve wider distribution is supposedly lower. Indeed, most consumer goods manufacturers could never justify the cost of selling direct to their consumers, except by mail order. In practice, if the producer is large enough, the use of intermediaries (particularly at the agent and wholesaler level) can sometimes cost more than going direct.</p>
<p>Many of the theoretical arguments about channels therefore revolve around cost. On the other hand, most of the practical decisions are concerned with control of the consumer. The small company has no alternative but to use intermediaries, often several layers of them, but large companies &#39;do&#39; have the 
choice. </p>
<p>However, many suppliers seem to assume that once their product has been sold into the channel, into the beginning of the distribution chain, their job is finished. Yet that distribution chain is merely assuming a part of the supplier&#39;s responsibility; and, if he has any aspirations to be market-oriented, his job should really be extended to managing, albeit very indirectly, all the processes involved in that chain, until the product or service arrives with the end-user. This may involve a number of 
decisions on the part of the supplier:</p>

<ul>
<li>Channel membership</li>
<li>Channel motivation</li>
<li>Monitoring and managing channels</li></ul>
<a id="Channel_membership" name="Channel_membership"></a><h3>Channel membership</h3>

<ol>
<li>Intensive distribution - Where the majority of resellers stock the `product&#39; (with convenience products, for example, and particularly the brand leaders in consumer goods markets) price competition may be evident.  </li>
<li>Selective distribution - This is the normal pattern (in both consumer and industrial markets) where `suitable&#39; resellers stock the product.  </li>
<li>Exclusive distribution - Only specially selected resellers or <a href="/wiki/Authorized_dealer" id="w"> authorized dealers</a> (typically only one per geographical area) are allowed to sell the `product&#39;.</li></ol>
<a id="Channel_motivation" name="Channel_motivation"></a><h3>Channel motivation</h3>
<p>It is difficult enough to motivate direct employees to provide the necessary sales and service support. Motivating the owners and employees of the independent organizations in a distribution chain requires even greater effort. There are many devices for achieving such motivation. Perhaps the most usual is `incentive&#39;: the supplier offers a better margin, to tempt the owners in the channel to push the product 
rather than its competitors; or a competition is offered to the distributors&#39; sales personnel, so that they are tempted to push the product. At the other end of the spectrum is the almost symbiotic relationship that the all too rare supplier in the computer field develops with its agents; where the agent&#39;s personnel, support as well as sales, are trained to almost the same standard as the supplier&#39;s own staff.</p>
<a id="Monitoring_and_managing_channels" name="Monitoring_and_managing_channels"></a><h3>Monitoring and managing channels</h3>
<p>In much the same way that the organization&#39;s own sales and distribution activities need to be monitored and managed, so will those of the distribution chain.</p>
<p>In practice, many organizations use a mix of different channels; in particular, they may complement a direct salesforce, calling on the larger accounts, with agents, covering the smaller customers and prospects.</p>
<a id="Vertical_marketing" name="Vertical_marketing"></a><h3>Vertical marketing</h3>
<p>This relatively recent development integrates the channel with the original supplier - producer, wholesalers and retailers working in one unified system. This may arise because one member 
of the chain owns the other elements (often called `corporate systems integration&#39;); a supplier owning its own retail outlets, this being &#39;forward&#39; integration. It is perhaps more likely that a retailer will own its own suppliers, this being &#39;backward&#39; integration. (For example, MFI, the furniture retailer, owns Hygena which makes its kitchen and bedroom units.) The integration can also be by franchise (such as that offered by McDonald&#39;s hamburgers and Benetton clothes) or simple co-operation (in the way that Marks &#38; Spencer co-operates with its suppliers).</p>
<p>Alternative approaches are &#39;contractual systems&#39;, often led by a wholesale or retail co-operative, and `administered marketing systems&#39; where one (dominant) member of the distribution chain uses its position to co-ordinate the other members&#39; activities. This has traditionally been the form led by manufacturers.</p>
<p>The intention of vertical marketing is to give all those involved (and particularly the supplier at one end, and the retailer at the other) &#39;control&#39; over the distribution chain. This removes one set of variables from the marketing equations.</p>
<p>Other research indicates that vertical integration is a strategy which is best pursued at the mature stage of the market (or product). At earlier stages it can actually reduce profits. It is arguable that it also diverts attention from the real business of the organization. Suppliers rarely excel in retail operations and, in theory, retailers should focus on their sales outlets rather than on manufacturing facilities ( Marks &#38; Spencer, for example, very deliberately provides considerable amounts of technical assistance to its suppliers, but does not own them).</p>
<a id="Horizontal_marketing" name="Horizontal_marketing"></a><h3>Horizontal marketing</h3>
<p>A rather less frequent example of new approaches to channels is where two or more non-competing organizations agree on a joint venture - a joint marketing operation - because it is beyond 
the capacity of each individual organization alone. In general, this is less likely to revolve around marketing synergy.</p>
