<p>{{nihongo}}, also known as <i>Final Fantasy XI: Online</i>, is a <a href="/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game" id="w">massively multiplayer online role-playing game</a> developed and published by <a href="/wiki/Square_Co." id="w">Square</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Square_Enix" id="w">Square Enix</a>) as a part of the <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy" id="w">Final Fantasy</a></i> video game series.

It was then localized and released for the North American market on <a href="/wiki/October_28" id="w">October 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>. An <a href="/wiki/Xbox_360" id="w">Xbox 360</a> version was released worldwide in <a href="/wiki/April" id="w">April</a> <a href="/wiki/2006_in_video_gaming" id="w">2006</a> as the system&#39;s first MMORPG.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The new Vana&#39;diel Collection 2008 disks for <a href="/wiki/Playstation_2" id="w">Playstation 2</a> had installation issues on the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_3" id="w">PlayStation 3</a> causing them to be unuseable without the original installs. However, this problem was fixed on December 18, 2007, when firmware update 2.10 allowed the disc to work properly.</p>
<p>The story is set in <a href="/wiki/Vana%26%2339%3Bdiel" id="w">Vana&#39;diel</a>, where various tasks can be performed to improve a character&#39;s powers or to complete quests. Five races are available to guide through the storylines of the 3 nations, the 4 expansion packs, and 2 sets of Dynamis realms. There are also numerous sub-plots, stories that players can experience while playing the hundreds of quests available in the game.</p>
<p>In January 2004, Square Enix announced that a total of over 500,000 users using more than 1 million characters were playing the game. As of 2006 there are currently between 200,000 and 300,000 active players logging in per day (see <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XI#Reception" id="w">Reception</a>) and the game is the dominant MMORPG in the Japanese market.<sup id="_ref-edge_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-edge" title="">[2]</a></sup> Four expansions for the game have been released since 2002, capitalizing on the game&#39;s success. Square Enix, as well as other sources, have reported that the number of users continues to grow at a steady pace.</p>
<a id="Gameplay" name="Gameplay"></a><h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>{{main}}
<i>Final Fantasy XI</i> is unlike <a href="/wiki/List_of_Final_Fantasy_media" id="w">previous titles in the series</a> in many ways. The player is able to customize their characters in limited ways, including race, gender, face, hair color, body size, job, and allegiance. Unlike previous Final Fantasy games, all battles occur in real time, and enemies are no longer randomly encountered.<sup id="_ref-official_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-official" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are 32 worlds (a cluster of servers) available for play, and one world used by Square-Enix. Server names use names of summons from previous <i>Final Fantasy</i> titles such as <a href="/wiki/Ifrit" id="w">Ifrit</a> and <a href="/wiki/Devil" id="w">Diabolos</a>. PC, PS2, and Xbox 360 players from across all geographic locations play together on the same servers. There are no region-specific servers, unlike other online games, such as <i><a href="/wiki/World_of_Warcraft" id="w">World of Warcraft</a></i>. </p>
<a id="Interface" name="Interface"></a><h3>Interface</h3>
<p>Players have the option of using any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and <a href="/wiki/Game_controller" id="w">controller</a> to play <i>Final Fantasy XI</i>. If a player using PS2 or Xbox 360 does not have a keyboard, the game also provides a method for him or her to communicate within the game (although it would be significantly slower than having a hardware keyboard input). The <a href="/wiki/HUD_(computer_gaming)" id="w">heads-up display</a> in &#34;Final Fantasy XI&#34; consists of a log window, menus, and several game information elements. The log window at the bottom of the screen displays system messages, battle messages, and text input by other players. Players may choose to filter what appears in the log window. &#34;Menus&#34; allow the player to access different commands, status windows, and configuration options. As well as the main menu, which contains the majority of the options for the game, the &#34;action command menu&#34; appears just above the log window and gives the player several options to interact with the game world. Several menu options are available through the use of keyboard shortcuts as well.<sup id="_ref-manual_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-manual" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">A player engaged in combat with a monster</div></div>

Gameplay in <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> consists of two major components: <a href="/wiki/Quest_(gaming)" id="w">quests</a>, which do not advance the main storyline but fill out the game&#39;s fantasy world, and missions, through which the main storyline of the game is told.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Quests may be undertaken for various rewards. Missions are undertaken to advance in rank, to access new areas and gain new privileges and to advance the various storylines in the game. Each nation has its own set of missions, which a player must complete to advance in rank; a player may only complete missions for his home country.</p>
<p>Battles in <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> take place in the same world in which players move around, unlike previous <i>Final Fantasy</i> games in which a battle would take place in a new screen. Monsters within the game operate under a system of &#34;claim&#34; and &#34;enmity&#34;. A monster is &#34;claimed&#34; the moment a player performs any offensive action upon it, including but not limited to attacks, usage of offensive job abilities and casting an (offensive) spell. With some exceptions, once a monster is claimed it can only be attacked by players in the party or alliance of the player that claimed it. A monster will focus its attention on whoever has built up the most enmity. Players have a number of means at their disposal, from spells to abilities to items, to both build up enmity and shed it.</p>
<p>Although there was originally no system allowing players to compete in battle with each other, it was eventually added to the game. The Player vs. Player (PvP) system is known as <i>Conflict</i>. Players may only compete directly against one another under very specific circumstances. Conflict happens only in &#34;matches&#34; that players enter by their own consent; players cannot attack one another outside of these circumstances. There are two types of Conflict matches. In <i>Ballista</i>, the objective is to score points by throwing a rock, or &#34;Petra,&#34; into a castle-like construction called a &#34;Rook.&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> In <i>Brenner</i>, a newer PvP type, players must steal the opposing team&#39;s flame and place them in &#34;Flammen-Brenner&#34; on their side. By maintaining these flames, points are awarded. The team with the most points by the end of the round is announced the winner.</p>
<a id="Crafting_and_Hobbies" name="Crafting_and_Hobbies"></a><h3>Crafting and Hobbies</h3>
<p>In addition to completing quests and missions, players can participate in several side activities or mini-games.<sup id="_ref-official_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-official" title="">[3]</a></sup> Various means of item collection allow the player to retrieve items from the world. Harvesting produces items from plants, excavating produces bone items, logging produces varying kinds of wood and mining produces metal ores and uncut gemstones. Fishing in <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> is a sort of <a href="/wiki/Minigame" id="w">minigame</a> where a player must measure their strength against the strength of fish that bite at their line. Gardening in <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> is when a player raises plants in their residence (also referred to as a mog house). Clamming is a <a href="/wiki/Minigame" id="w">minigame</a> where players collect as many fish or sea creatures as possible without going over a limit predetermined by the size bucket they&#39;re carrying. <a href="/wiki/Chocobo" id="w">Chocobo</a> digging is when a player commands a bird called a chocobo to dig up items from random spots on the ground.</p>
<p><i>Final Fantasy XI</i> has a fairly complex item creation system, in which players use elemental crystals obtained by fighting the various monsters to turn specific combinations of items into other items in a process called &#34;synthesis&#34;. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Also, unlike <i>World of Warcraft</i>, each synthesis has a chance of failure (which can be reduced by increasing the skill related to the recipe but cannot be eliminated) while most recipes have a small chance to produce a high-quality item (this chance is increased by increasing the skill related to the recipe; high quality items generally have better stats), which also means that the risk-reward factor on certain items are extremely high. Different recipes, using different classes of ingredients and different craft skills, will produce different types of items. There are nine types of crafting skills; some recipes requires a player to have two or even three skills at certain levels for the player to be able to even attempt to synthesize the item. Other recipes also call for additional key items that a player must possess in order to be able to create certain items.</p>
<a id="Game_Economy" name="Game_Economy"></a><h3>Game Economy</h3>
<p><i>Final Fantasy XI</i> has an almost entirely player-based economy with a heavy reliance on &#34;Auction Houses&#34; in each of the major cities of Vana&#39;diel. The only monsters in the game that drop any in-game currency known as <a href="/wiki/Common_elements_of_Final_Fantasy#Currency" id="w">gil</a> when defeated are the Beastmen, humanoids which fight against player characters. However, Beastmen drop very small amounts of gil, meaning that unlike other games in the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series, it is very difficult to make much money merely by slaughtering monsters. Various items used in crafting, as well as sometimes extremely rare items, may drop off the monsters that are defeated. Although the game economy is mostly in the hands of the players, there are certain economic controls in place. Money may go to a <a href="/wiki/Non-player_character" id="w">non-player character</a> (NPC), as when players purchase items from NPC merchants or rent certain forms of transportation.  Fees are also levied by certain NPC&#39;s to store sets of armor or holiday event items.  A fee is charged to place items up for auction at the Auction House and in certain cities. Players making purchases from player-run &#34;bazaars&#34; within these cities are taxed a percentage of the item&#39;s set price. Since transportation, auction house, item storage, and tax fees do not go to players, these <a href="/wiki/Gold_sink" id="w">gilsinks</a> effectively remove money from the economy.</p>

The world of <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> is known as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Vana%26%2339%3Bdiel" id="w">Vana&#39;diel</a>&#34;. It consists of two main landmasses with two smaller islands flanking them, which in turn are surrounded by small islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the northern glaciers to the southern deserts.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The four main cities in Vana&#39;diel are Bastok, San d&#39;Oria, Windurst, and Jeuno. The expansion <i>Treasures of Aht Urhgan</i> added the large Aht Urhgan Whitegate/Al Zahbi city area. The rest of Vana&#39;diel is made up of a number of outdoor, dungeon, and minor town areas split into various regions. While most areas are accessible by walking, various modes of transportation, ranging from the classic <i>Final Fantasy</i> <a href="/wiki/Chocobo" id="w">chocobo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Common_elements_of_Final_Fantasy#Airships" id="w">airships</a> to special spells, facilitate movement across the game world.{{cn}} </p>
<p>The five playable races in <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> are Elvaan, strong melee fighters, reasonable healers but weak in black magic; Hume, a race resembling humans, with no notable strengths or weaknesses; Galka, a genderless race, strong and tough, but weak with magic; Mithra, agile and dexterous, but physically weak, cat-like humanoids of which only the females of the race are playable characters and Tarutaru, tiny humanoids with incredible power over black magic, but physically weak.<sup id="_ref-official_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-official" title="">[3]</a></sup> <div style="wigth:200px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:200px-newworld.JPG" title="Map of The Aht Urghan Empire"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200px-newworld.JPG" alt="Map of The Aht Urghan Empire" title="Map of The Aht Urghan Empire" class="location-right type-thumb" width="200px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Map of The Aht Urghan Empire</div></div>
 In addition to the player races, there are two primary non-playable races known as the Zilart, an ancient race which is the focus of the first two game expansions, and the Kuluu, a race of beings similar to the Zilart and thought to be inferior to it. There is also a huge supporting cast of NPCs who give quests and missions and appear in the game&#39;s storylines. The game features several typical <a href="/wiki/Monsters_of_Final_Fantasy" id="w">&#39;&#39;Final Fantasy&#39;&#39; monsters</a> as well as Beastmen, which includes races such as the Goblin, Orc, Yagudo, and Quadav. Some of these creatures follow the Shadow Lord, one source of the game&#39;s conflict.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are nine major plotlines in <i>Final Fantasy XI</i>, including the storylines of the 3 nations (San d&#39;Oria, Bastok, and Windurst), the four expansion packs (Rise of the Zilart, Chains of Promathia, Treasures of Aht Urhgan, and Wings of the Goddess) and 2 sets of Dynamis realms. The Dynamis storylines are unique in that the storyline progresses through clearing special Dynamis zones, not through completing missions as with the other storylines in the game (although due to the nature of the Dynamis storyline, players must have other storylines advanced to a certain point in order to start it). There are also numerous sub-plots that players can experience while solving the hundreds of quests available in the game.</p>
<a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2>Development</h2>
<p>After the English localization of <i><a href="/wiki/Chrono_Cross" id="w">Chrono Cross</a></i>, development began on <i>Final Fantasy XI</i>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The Japanese game players were told to expect English speaking players, since the game makers intended to create a unified game world instead of different ones balkanized by language.<sup id="_ref-E3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-E3" title="">[11]</a></sup> This development allowed for a 66% reduction of potential costs in setup.<sup id="_ref-game_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-game" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Different creatures had to have their names standardized, as they are called by different names in the Japanese and American versions.<sup id="_ref-E3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-E3" title="">[11]</a></sup> The game cost 2–3 billion <a href="/wiki/Japanese_yen" id="w">yen</a> (~$17–25 million) to create along with the <a href="/wiki/PlayOnline" id="w">PlayOnline</a> Network Service and was assumed to become profitable over a five year timespan.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> It was originally announced that there would be simultaneous release on both the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_2" id="w">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href="/wiki/Personal_computer" id="w">PCs</a> as well as concurrent Japanese and American release.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The game was developed and ran on the <a href="/wiki/NVIDIA" id="w">NVIDIA</a> <a href="/wiki/GeForce_4_Series" id="w">GeForce 4 Ti</a> <a href="/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" id="w">GPU</a>, which the President of Square described as the most powerful graphics processor available at the time.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Following an August 2001 Beta test in Japan, a public Japanese Beta test was done in December 2001.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> The game was the first developed under Square&#39;s new philosophy to develop for &#34;all platforms and media&#34;.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Release" name="Release"></a><h3>Release</h3>
<p><i>Final Fantasy XI</i> was listed as one of <a href="/wiki/IGN" id="w">IGN</a>&#39;s most anticipated games of 2004.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> There were objections raised to naming the game the eleventh in the series, since there was question of whether the game would have a structured story (a fear that was proven to be unfounded); it was suggested that the game instead be named &#34;<i>Final Fantasy Online</i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A few options are currently available for prospective players of <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> to sample the game. The first of these offered by Square-Enix was a free 30 day trial for the game included with the purchase of an <a href="/wiki/Alienware" id="w">Alienware</a> PC or a <a href="/wiki/Logitech" id="w">Logitech</a> computer accessory. The trial offered codes for downloading the core game and registration with PlayOnline and Final Fantasy XI. This promotion is no longer proactively offered, though the codes provided for these trials are still valid.</p>
<p>The second method to obtain a free trial involved the &#34;Buddy Pass,&#34; a code included in the &#34;Vana&#39;diel Collection&#34; and &#34;Vana&#39;diel Collection 2007&#34; Windows releases of the game and given away in a promotion by Square-Enix during the 2005 iGames World Tour, which allows a friend to download the core game and play free for 30 days.</p>
<p>The newest option available to prospective players is the <i>Final Fantasy XI Starter Pack</i>, released by <a href="/wiki/Square_Enix" id="w">Square Enix</a> on 20 July 2007 with an MSRP of $3.99, including registration codes for PlayOnline, <i>Final Fantasy XI</i>, and <a href="/wiki/Minigames_of_Final_Fantasy#Tetra Master" id="w">Tetra Master</a> and an installation disc for the core game and its three current expansions. The disc would allow the player to test the game for 30 days, after which content IDs could be purchased from Square-Enix for the normal prices. Additionally, content IDs for the three expansion packs are now available for purchase from Square-Enix.</p>
<p>All releases of <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> include the first 30 days of play for free.</p>

When news was first circulated about an expansion to <i>Final Fantasy XI</i>, it was thought that the game&#39;s title would be <i>Final Fantasy XI: Vision of Girade</i> (Which wasn&#39;t too far from the truth; it was released in Japan as <i>Final Fantasy XI: Visions of Zilart</i>) and was unclear whether it would be a free upgrade or not.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/October_28" id="w">October 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>, <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> was released in <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a> on the personal computer along with the first expansion <i><a href="/wiki/Expansions_of_Final_Fantasy_XI#Rise of the Zilart" id="w">Rise of the Zilart</a></i>, with a <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_2" id="w">PlayStation 2</a> release on <a href="/wiki/March_23" id="w">March 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> In 2006 it was also made available on the <a href="/wiki/Xbox_360" id="w">Xbox 360</a>, the first collaboration of Square Enix and <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" id="w">Microsoft</a>.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The Xbox Live version was also beta tested to see how their online playing system supported <i>Final Fantasy XI</i>.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> The Xbox version was the first game on the Xbox 360 to require the use of their hard drive addition.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second expansion to the game, <i><a href="/wiki/Expansions_of_Final_Fantasy_XI#Chains of Promathia" id="w">Chains of Promathia</a></i>, was released in Japan on <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, and a bundled version of the game complete with the two expansion packs was released in Europe on the same date.

<a id="Updates" name="Updates"></a><h3>Updates</h3>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_14" id="w">June 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, the game server was down for four hours for maintenance to the database servers, bug fixes on the text interface and a new patch for the game client.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> This is thought to be the first patch ever released for a console game.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/July_8" id="w">July 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, Square also shut down the item auction system due to some players exploiting the system.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup>
In early 2006, Square Enix discovered that a group of players had found a way to generate the game currency and exchange it for real currency, which in turn drove up prices for all items across the game. In response, 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300 billion Gil was removed from circulation. This effort is an attempt to stop the interaction between real and <a href="/wiki/Virtual_economy" id="w">virtual economy</a> in the online game.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> Square Enix has stated that the trade of items for real currency is officially a violation of the <a href="/wiki/Terms_of_Service" id="w">Terms of Service</a> for <i>Final Fantasy XI</i>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> In July 2006, Square Enix banned or suspended over 8,000 other accounts for similar manipulation and commerce.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Since the update, Square Enix has been regularly banning players&#39; accounts found in violation of the terms, some of them using third-party tools, effectively removing billions of gil from the in-game economy.

<p>As of <a href="/wiki/March_2007" id="w">March 2007</a>, the PC version of Final Fantasy XI is compatible with <a href="/wiki/Windows_Vista" id="w">Windows Vista</a>. After working with Microsoft to resolve Final Fantasy XI&#39;s incompatibility issues with Windows Vista, Square Enix released a downloadable version of the PlayOnline client which is compatible with the <a href="/wiki/Operating_system" id="w">operating system</a>, fixing the main incompatibility issue. While smaller bugs are still known to exist, such as the client not launching correctly through <a href="/wiki/Windows_Media_Center" id="w">Windows Media Center</a>, the new client allows Final Fantasy XI to run correctly on Windows Vista.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>As of <a href="/wiki/December_2006" id="w">December 2006</a>, the PlayStation 2 versions of PlayOnline and Final Fantasy XI install and run on PlayStation 3. A download from the PlayStation Store and ten gigabytes of available disk space (for the PS2 drive image) are required to enable support for the software on PlayStation 3 for the original installs.</p>

Unlike <i>Final Fantasy X</i>, <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> does not have any voice actors for cutscenes, only for battle cries and related sounds. The only voice acting is the opening CGI to the game, none of the non-player characters speak during gameplay. Instead text descriptions are used to indicate what they are communicating to the players. The opening CGI also features choral music with lyrics in <a href="/wiki/Esperanto" id="w">Esperanto</a>. According to its composer, <a href="/wiki/Nobuo_Uematsu" id="w">Nobuo Uematsu</a>, the choice of language was meant to symbolize the developers&#39; hope that their online game could contribute to cross-cultural communication and cooperation.</p>
<p>The music of <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> was <a href="/wiki/Video_game_music" id="w">scored</a> by <a href="/wiki/Nobuo_Uematsu" id="w">Nobuo Uematsu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Naoshi_Mizuta" id="w">Naoshi Mizuta</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Kumi_Tanioka" id="w">Kumi Tanioka</a>. The expansion packs were scored by Mizuta alone after Tanioka left to pursue other projects and Uematsu left Square Enix. A holiday score titled <i>Jeuno -Starlight Celebration-</i> could be heard in the city of Jeuno during mid to late December. It was first introduced on December 2004 and has been played each December since then. The music can also be heard while in the area known as Dynamis - Tavnazia. A vocal, <i>Distant Worlds</i>, performed by Izumi Masuda, composed by Uematsu and arranged by Mizuta, was later released in a July <a href="/wiki/2005_in_music" id="w">2005</a> patch and was released on the Japan <a href="/wiki/ITunes" id="w">iTunes</a> Music Store of 13 September <a href="/wiki/2005_in_music" id="w">2005</a>.</p>
<p>Nobuo Uematsu noted the increased difficulty of scoring a game for which there was no linear plotline, a major change from the previous ten <i>Final Fantasy</i> games. It was also the first game in the series for which he composed while he was no longer a Square employee.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> The 2004–2005 concert series, <a href="/wiki/Dear_Friends_-Music_from_Final_Fantasy-" id="w">Dear Friends -Music from Final Fantasy-</a>, featured &#34;Ronfaure&#34; from <i>Final Fantasy XI</i>.

<p>The game has also spawned several written works. Starting in 2003, a series of novels titled <i>Final Fantasy XI: 星の誓い</i> was written by Miyabi Hasegawa and was released in Japanese,<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> German,<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> and French.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> In 2004, a Japanese-exclusive <a href="/wiki/Manhwa" id="w">manhwa</a> titled <i>Final Fantasy XI ~The Out of Orders~</i> was created by artist Kim Byung Jin and story writer Kim Sungjae.

<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h2>Reception</h2>
<p>By December of 2002, Square president Yoichi Wada announced that there were over 200,000 subscribers to <i>Final Fantasy XI</i>, allowing the company to break even and start making a profit.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> In January 2004, Square Enix announced that over 500,000 users utilizing over 1 million characters were playing the game. Having also been released on the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_2" id="w">PlayStation 2</a> as well as the personal computer, it became the first cross platform <a href="/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game" id="w">MMORPG</a> ever created.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> Right before its release on the PlayStation 2, a third of the players were thought to be English speaking.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> There are also currently between 200,000 and 300,000 active players daily.<sup id="_ref-game_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-game" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>For the April-September 2004 financial period, Square Enix saw online gaming, particularly <i>Final Fantasy XI</i>, sales increase by 101 percent and operating profit increase by 230.9 percent.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> As of summer 2006, revenues have continued to hold steady from subscription services.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> Since its <a href="/wiki/Xbox_360" id="w">Xbox 360</a> release it has become by <a href="/wiki/August_14" id="w">August 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, the 6th most played game at Xbox Live.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was rated an 8.4 at GameStats.com.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> It was thought to be a well done but unoriginal game, and in fact with only Japanese servers running North American players were forced to play with already much more experienced Japanese players; all the quests had literally already been beaten.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> GameSpot criticized it for having an unconventional control system, a lengthy installation, and having no player versus player aspects.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> Other problems have included EXP grind which involves constant battles to access different parts of the game, and overcrowded camp sites.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> With regard to the <a href="/wiki/Xbox_360" id="w">Xbox 360</a> release, there has been criticism that the game would only work if accompanied by a hard drive.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> However, this is understandable due to the fact that the game does not stream, but must be installed prior to use.</p>
<p>Through further development, many issues, concerns and complaints about the game have been addressed. New servers were added, allowing American players to start on fresh servers without far more experienced players.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> Although, much content had already been completed and could be easily researched, new quests have been continually added with each update.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> With new expansions and updates, the size of the game has greatly increased, however, the Vana&#39;diel Collection DVD has greatly reduced install time. In April of 2004, Ballista, the first form of player versus player was released,<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> followed by Brenner, a second form of player versus player, in February of 2006.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> Developers have also reduced the amount of experience needed to fully level a character end game, as well as included new ways to gain experience such as easily obtainable items which grant increased experience for defeating enemies.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Final Fantasy XI</i> was awarded the grand prize from the Japan&#39;s Consumer Entertainment Software Association (CESA) for 2002–2003 along with <i><a href="/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin" id="w">Taiko no Tatsujin</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> It was also named IGN&#39;s Game of the Month for March 2004, citing the game&#39;s huge customization and its successful cross-platform and cross-language game world.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> A <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> themed lobby is present in the online game <i><a href="/wiki/Hot_Shots_Golf_(series)" id="w">Minna no Golf Online</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> It also won GameSpy&#39;s 2003 PC MMORPG Game of the Year Award.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
