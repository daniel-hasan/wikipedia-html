<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h2>Background</h2>
<p>Desmond Mpilo Tutu was born in <a href="/wiki/Klerksdorp" id="w">Klerksdorp</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transvaal" id="w">Transvaal</a> on 7 October, 1931. Tutu&#39;s  family moved to <a href="/wiki/Johannesburg" id="w">Johannesburg</a> when he was 12 years old. Although he wanted to become a <a href="/wiki/Physician" id="w">physician</a>, his family could not afford the training, and he followed his father&#39;s footsteps into <a href="/wiki/Teaching" id="w">teaching</a>. Tutu studied at the <a href="/wiki/Pretoria_Bantu_Normal_College" id="w">Pretoria Bantu Normal College</a> from 1951 through 1953, and went on to teach at <a href="/wiki/Johannesburg_Bantu_High_School" id="w">Johannesburg Bantu High School</a>, where he remained until 1957.  He resigned following the passage of the <a href="/wiki/Bantu_Education_Act" id="w">Bantu Education Act</a>, in protest of the poor educational prospects for African South Africans. He continued his studies, this time in <a href="/wiki/Theology" id="w">theology</a>, and in 1960 was ordained as an <a href="/wiki/Anglican" id="w">Anglican</a> <a href="/wiki/Minister" id="w">minister</a>.

He returned to Southern Africa and from 1967 until 1972 used his lectures to highlight the circumstances of the African population. He wrote a letter to <a href="/wiki/B.J._Vorster" id="w">Prime Minister Vorster</a>, in which he described the situation in South Africa as a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" id="w">powder barrel</a> that can explode at any time.&#34;  The letter was never answered.

Tutu consistently advocated <a href="/wiki/Reconciliation" id="w">reconciliation</a> between all parties involved in apartheid through his writings and lectures at home and abroad. Though he was most firm in denouncing South Africa&#39;s white-ruled government, Tutu was also harsh in his criticism of the violent tactics of some anti-apartheid groups such as the <a href="/wiki/African_National_Congress" id="w">African National Congress</a> and denounced <a href="/wiki/Terrorism" id="w">terrorism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">Communism</a>.</p>

<p>In the debate about <a href="/wiki/Anglican_views_of_homosexuality" id="w">Anglican views of homosexuality</a> he has opposed Christian discrimination against homosexuals.

However, Tutu states that forgiveness is not turning a blind eye to wrongs; true reconciliation exposes the awfulness, the abuse, the pain, the hurt, the truth. It could even sometimes make things worse. It is a risky undertaking but in the end it is worthwhile, because in the end only an honest confrontation with reality can bring healing.</p>

We pray for those who made it happen, help us to forgive them and help us so that we in our turn will not make others suffer.&#34;<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>  Some found this statement offensive, with Rabbi Marvin Hier of the <a href="/wiki/Simon_Wiesenthal_Center" id="w">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> calling it “a gratuitous insult to Jews and victims of Nazism everywhere.” <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>  Tutu was subjected to racial slurs during this visit to Israel, with vandals writing &#34;Black Nazi pig&#34; on the walls of the St. George&#39;s Cathedral in East Jerusalem, where he was staying.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2002, when delivering a public lecture in support of divestment, Tutu said &#34;My heart aches. I say why are our memories so short. Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation? Have they forgotten the collective punishment, the home demolitions, in their own history so soon?

Have they forgotten that God cares deeply about the downtrodden?&#34;<sup id="_ref-tutu_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tutu" title="">[8]</a></sup>  He argued that Israel could never live in security by oppressing another people, and continued, &#34;People are scared in this country [the US], to say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful - very powerful. Well, so what? For goodness sake, this is God&#39;s world! We live in a moral universe. The apartheid government was very powerful, but today it no longer exists. Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Pinochet, Milosevic, and Idi Amin were all powerful, but in the end they bit the dust.&#34;<sup id="_ref-tutu_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tutu" title="">[8]</a></sup>  The latter statement was criticized by some Jewish groups, including the <a href="/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League" id="w">Anti-Defamation League</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  When he edited and reprinted parts of his speech in 2005, Tutu replaced the phrase &#34;Jewish lobby&#34; with &#34;pro-Israel lobby&#34;.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>  </p>

<p>After a decade of freedom for <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a>, Archbishop Tutu was honored with the invitation to deliver the annual Nelson Mandela Foundation Lecture. On <a href="/wiki/November_23" id="w">November 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a> Tutu was given the address entitled, &#34;Look to the Rock from Which You Were Hewn&#39;.  This lecture, critical of the <a href="/wiki/African_National_Congress" id="w">ANC</a>-controlled government, stirred a pot of controversy between Tutu and <a href="/wiki/Thabo_Mbeki" id="w">Thabo Mbeki</a>, calling into question &#34;the right to criticise.&#34;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nu.ac.za/ccs/default.asp?3,28,10,1763" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nu.ac.za/ccs/default.asp?3,28,10,1763">http://www.nu.ac.za/ccs/default.asp?3,28,10,1763</a>  After the first round of volleys were fired, <a href="/wiki/South_African_Press_Association" id="w">South African Press Association</a> <a href="/wiki/Journalist" id="w">journalist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ben_Maclennan" id="w">Ben Maclennan</a> reported Tutu&#39;s response as:<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>
</p><blockquote>
<p>&#34;Thank you Mr President for telling me what you think of me, that I am--a liar with scant regard for the truth, and a charlatan posing with his concern for the poor, the hungry, the oppressed and the voiceless.&#34; --Tutu. (Ben Maclennan, Sapa, 2004-12-02)
</p></blockquote>

<p>In January 2005, Tutu added his voice to the growing dissent over terrorist suspects held at <a href="/wiki/Camp_X-Ray" id="w">Camp X-Ray</a> in <a href="/wiki/Guant%C3%A1namo_Bay%2C_Cuba" id="w">Guantanamo Bay</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>, referring to detentions without trial as &#34;utterly unacceptable.&#34;</p>

<p>In February 2006 Tutu took part in the 9th Assembly of the <a href="/wiki/World_Council_of_Churches" id="w">World Council of Churches</a>, held in <a href="/wiki/Porto_Alegre" id="w">Porto Alegre</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brazil" id="w">Brazil</a>.

<a id="Beit_Hanoun" name="Beit_Hanoun"></a><h3> Beit Hanoun </h3>
<p>Desmond Tutu was named to head a United Nations fact-finding mission to the <a href="/wiki/Gaza_Strip" id="w">Gaza Strip</a> town of <a href="/wiki/Beit_Hanoun" id="w">Beit Hanoun</a>, where, in a <a href="/wiki/Beit_Hanoun_November_2006_incident" id="w">November 2006 incident</a> the <a href="/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces" id="w">Israel Defense Forces</a> killed 19 civilians after troops wound up a week-long incursion aimed at curbing <a href="/wiki/2006_Israel-Gaza_conflict" id="w">Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel</a> from the town.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>. Tutu planned to travel to the Palestinian territory to &#34;assess the situation of victims, address the needs of survivors and make recommendations on ways and means to protect Palestinian civilians against further Israeli assaults,&#34; according to the president of the UN <a href="/wiki/Human_Rights_Council" id="w">Human Rights Council</a>, <a href="/wiki/Luis_Alfonso_De_Alba" id="w">Luis Alfonso De Alba</a>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Israeli officials expressed concern that the report would be biased against Israel.  </p>
<p>Tutu cancelled the trip in mid-December, saying that Israel had refused to grant him the necessary travel clearance after more than a week of discussions. A spokesman from the Israeli foreign ministry indicated that no final decision had been made, to which Tutu responded, &#34;At times <i>not</i> making a decision <i>is</i> making a decision. We couldn&#39;t obviously wait in limbo indefinitely.&#34;<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League" id="w">Anti-Defamation League</a> stated that the appointment of Tutu as head of the mission is not appropriate on the grounds that he would be a prepossessed observer, and criticized the mission for having not &#34;address[ed] the continuing barrage of <a href="/wiki/Kassam" id="w">Kassam</a> rockets fired into Israel by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, killing and maiming Israeli citizens...Tutu has already publicly expressed his anti-Israel views and his opinions regarding what happened in Beit Hanoun, and combined with the one-sided anti-Israel mandate provided by the resolution, the results of the mission are all-but preordained&#34;<sup id="_ref-ADL on Beit Hanoun _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ADL on Beit Hanoun " title="">[32]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li>&#34;When missionaries came to South Africa, we had the land, they had the Bible. Then they told us, &#39;Let&#39;s close our eyes and pray.&#39; When we opened our eyes we saw that we have the Bible, they have the land.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;My heart aches. I say why are our memories so short. Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation? Have they forgotten the collective punishment, the home demolitions, in their own history so soon? Have they turned their backs on their profound and  chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Good is stronger than evil; love is stronger than hate; light is stronger than darkness; life is stronger than death. Victory is ours, through him who loves us.&#34;</li>

<p>{{Expand}}
In August 2006 Archbishop Tutu publicly urged <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Zuma" id="w">Jacob Zuma</a>, the South African politician who had been accused of sexual crimes and corruption, to drop out of the ANC&#39;s presidential succession race. Zuma&#39;s personal advisor responded by accusing Tutu of having double standards and &#34;selective amnesia&#34; (as well as being old). <a href="/wiki/Elias_Khumalo" id="w">Elias Khumalo</a> claims the archbishop “had found it so easy to accept the apology from the apartheid government that committed unspeakable atrocities against millions of South Africans”, yet now “cannot find it in his heart to accept the apology from this humble man who has erred”.
