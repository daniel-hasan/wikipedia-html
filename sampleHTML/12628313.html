Biography
Darin Dunn was born in Stuttgart, Germany to American Missionaries Frank and Sherry Dunn where he spent his first three years. Upon leaving Germany his family, which included his older brother Trey, his older sister Stacy and later younger brother Jonathan, settled in San Antonio, Texas.Aside from six years in Yorktown, Virginia Dunn spent his entire childhood in Texas.;

In 2002 Dunn released his first album All Fear Is Gone.Despite being a relatively new musician at the time Dunn wrote three of the tracks and played most of the instruments himself.This album included the talents of long time collaborators Wendy Semones and Michael Dalton, a formula that would repeat itself on each of Dunnâ€™s first three albums.Despite its achievements the album received very little promotion and thus very few copies were sold.;

Following his debut album Dunn decided to take a few years off from recording to work on his skills.He sang at churches, restaurants, retreats, reunions, fairs, picnics and festivals.He took any gig he could get and surrounded himself with experienced musicians.After four years he headed back to the studio. ;

In 2006 Dunn released his second album Content With Obscurity which is viewed as his breakthrough album.This time around Dunn wrote all but three of the songs, took on all of the producing duties, as well as providing Lead Vocals, Background Vocals, Choir vocals, 6 string guitars, 12 string guitars, nylon string guitars, electric guitars, bass guitars, drum programming, harmonicas, percussion, keyboards, string synthesizer, mandolin and banjo. The album also featured the stylings of violin virtuoso Jackie Turner. Fueled by internet buzz (mostly from iTunes and MySpace) Content With Obscurity went on to triple the sales of his first album.;

Riding on the success of that album Dunn returned to the studio in 2007 for his third album Dare To Die.On Dare To Die Dunn once again collaborated with his brother Jonathan Dunn for two tracks on the album and wrote the other eight by himself. This album also featured the talents of noted guitarist Darin Cabell.Dare To Die has been Dunn's biggest album to date and it has relied solely on internet sales, physical as well as digital.;

Dunn now lives in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and continues to write and record as he works on his upcoming album.
