</p>
<a id="Birth" name="Birth"></a><h3>Birth</h3>
<p>Teika was born to a minor and distant branch of the aristocratic and courtly clan, the <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_family" id="w">Fujiwara</a>, in 1162, sometime after the Fujiwara regents had lost their political pre-eminence in the Imperial court during the <a href="/wiki/H%C5%8Dgen_Rebellion" id="w">Hōgen Rebellion</a>. His branch of the clan sought prestige and power in the court by aligning itself with the Mikohidari family, and by specializing in artistic endeavors, principally poetry. Such specialization was not unusual; branches of extended clans were not in a position to compete directly in politics with the head branch of the clan (or indeed other clans because of their junior status), but could compete in more restricted aesthetic pursuits. (The Mikohidari, also known as the Miko, were a <a href="/wiki/Cadet_branch" id="w">cadet branch</a> of the Fujiwaras, through <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Michinaga" id="w">Fujiwara no Michinaga</a>&#39;s sixth son, <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Nagaie" id="w">Fujiwara no Nagaie</a> (1005-1064); the Mikohidari were themselves aligned with the more senior <a href="/wiki/Kuj%C5%8D_family" id="w">Kujō</a> branch of the original Fujiwara, who opposed the <a href="/wiki/Rokuj%C5%8D_family" id="w">Rokujō family</a>)</p>
<p>Teika&#39;s grandfather was the venerable poet <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Toshitada" id="w">Fujiwara no Toshitada</a>. His father was <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Shunzei" id="w">Fujiwara Shunzei</a> (1114-1204), a well known and greatly respected poet (and judge of poetry competitions), who had compiled the seventh Imperial anthology of <i>waka</i> (the <i><a href="/wiki/Senzai_Wakash%C5%AB" id="w">Senzai Wakashū</a></i>). His sister would also become a well-respected poet of <i>waka</i> and <a href="/wiki/Renga" id="w">renga</a>, known as Kengozen or  <a href="/wiki/Shunzei%26%2339%3Bs_Daughter" id="w">Shunzei&#39;s Daughter</a>, whom he would occasionally seek out for poetic advice. His elder brother, Fujiwara no Nariee (sometimes romanized as &#34;Nariie&#34;; 藤原俊成), would be somewhat successful in court, but not nearly as much as his sister.<sup id="_ref-sister_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sister" title="">[8]</a></sup> Teika&#39;s foster-brother, the priest <a href="/wiki/Jakuren" id="w">Jakuren</a> or &#34;Sadanaga&#34; c. 1139-1202 <i>would</i> be successful as a poet although his career was cut tragically short; he had been  adopted by Shunzei when Shunzei&#39;s younger brother &#34;retired from the world&#34;.<sup id="_ref-foster-brother_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-foster-brother" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Career" name="Career"></a><h3>Career</h3>
<p>Teika&#39;s goals as the senior male of his branch were to inherit and cement his father&#39;s position in poetry, and to advance his own reputation (thereby also improving the political fortunes of his own clan in the court). While his life would be marked by repeated illness<sup id="_ref-illness_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-illness" title="">[10]</a></sup>and wildly shifting fortunes- only partially moderated by his father&#39;s long-lasting influence in court (Shunzei would live to the advanced age of 90), the young and poetically inclined <a href="/wiki/Cloistered_rule" id="w">Retired Emperor</a> <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Go-Toba" id="w">Go-Toba</a>&#39;s  patronage would prove to lead to some of Teika&#39;s greatest successes.<sup id="_ref-gotoba-crucial_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gotoba-crucial" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Go-Toba's_patronage" name="Go-Toba's_patronage"></a><h4>Go-Toba&#39;s patronage</h4>
<p>The Retired Emperor Go-Toba announced, in the second year of his abdication (1200, the second year of the <a href="/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dji_(era)" id="w">Shōji</a> era) that he would be conducting a poetry contest. <sup id="_ref-shoji-era-contest_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shoji-era-contest" title="">[12]</a></sup>; Retired Emperors frequently became more influential after their retirement from the office of Emperor rather than as the actual Emperor, since they were from the highly restricting ceremonial requirements and politics of the court. Go-Toba was 20 when he abdicated; he was the consummate amateur, skilled at playing the <a href="/wiki/Lute" id="w">lute</a>, considered an authority on traditional learning and courtly precedent, excellent at playing <i><a href="/wiki/Go_(board_game)" id="w">Go</a></i>, and  fond of <a href="/wiki/Equestrianism" id="w">equestrian</a> pursuits such as horseback archery, shooting at running dogs, and swordsmanship.<sup id="_ref-amateur_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amateur" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Go-Toba regarded all these pursuits as hobbies, taking one up and dropping another. One of these was his support of poetry, especially the <a href="/wiki/Waka_(poetry)" id="w">waka</a>. Immediately after his abdication, he had announced  that he would hold two poetry contests, each requiring a number of preeminent poets to compose some 100 <i>waka</i> in a particular thematic progression, known as the <i>hyakushu</i> genre of poem sequences. The first contest (<i>Go-Toba no In shodo hyakushu</i> - &#34;Ex-Emperor Go-Toba&#39;s First Hundred-Poem Sequences&#34;) was considered a crucial political nexus; if a clan&#39;s poet did well and impressed the powerful (and youthful) Go-Toba, the clan would benefit considerably.<sup id="_ref-sequence-name_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sequence-name" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Teika-sarashina-nikki-calligraphy.png" title="Another example of Teika&#39;s calligraphy; here he has copied a portion of [[Sugawara no Takasue no musume]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;Sarashina nikki&#39;&#39;"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teika-sarashina-nikki-calligraphy.png" alt="Another example of Teika&#39;s calligraphy; here he has copied a portion of [[Sugawara no Takasue no musume]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;Sarashina nikki&#39;&#39;" title="Another example of Teika&#39;s calligraphy; here he has copied a portion of [[Sugawara no Takasue no musume]]&#39;s &#39;&#39;Sarashina nikki&#39;&#39;" class="location-right type-thumb" />

<p>Teika&#39;s diary records that he looked forward to this chance to improve himself. He was 38, and had reached middle age. While he was recognized as a talented poet, his career was stagnant;  he had been in the Palace Guards of the Left for twenty years, and had not been promoted for nearly 10. He was &#34;Lesser Commander of the Palace Guards of the Left&#34; with little prospect of further advancement.<sup id="_ref-lesser-commander_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lesser-commander" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>He had wider political problems: The influence of his patrons,  the Kujōs, over the Emperors had declined drastically. <a href="/wiki/Minamoto_no_Michichika" id="w">Minamoto no Michichika</a> (d. 1202) had insinuated himself into Imperial circles through Go-Toba&#39;s former nursemaid; with this leverage, Michichika&#39;s adopted daughter (the then Shogun&#39;s daughter, who had decided to marry his daughter off to the Emperor, using Michichika as a go-between - contrary to the Shogun&#39;s usual policy if favoring Kujo no Kanezane. The Shogun&#39;s lack of confidence allowed Michichika to push Go-Toba into firing Kanezane as <a href="/wiki/Kampaku" id="w">kampaku</a> in 1196<sup id="_ref-keene-667_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keene-667" title="">[16]</a></sup>) became Go-Toba&#39;s concubine (making Michichika the Retired Emperor Go-Toba&#39;s father in law), and she bore him his first heir in 1195; the shame of this usurpation led Go-Toba&#39;s first wife, Ninshi, to retire from the
court. As Ninshi was the daughter of the Kujō&#39;s leader <a href="/wiki/Kujo_no_Kanezane" id="w">Kujo no Kanezane</a>, the Kujō&#39;s influence in court  diminished considerably, even to the extent of <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Kanezane" id="w">Kanezane</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minamoto_no_Yoshitsune" id="w">Yoshitsune</a> (d. 1206; once the regent and prime minister) <sup id="_ref-pg 663_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pg 663" title="">[17]</a></sup>being driven from the court in 1196;<sup id="_ref-rokujo-decline_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rokujo-decline" title="">[18]</a></sup>with the diminution of their influence, so dimmed Teika&#39;s prospects. Teika expressed his disappointment through poetry, such as this example, written when he was &#34;passed over for promotion in the spring list&#34; in 1187 (he would eventually be promoted in 1190, but as his good and encouraging friend <a href="/wiki/Saigyo" id="w">Saigyo</a> died that year, it was cold comfort):</p>

<p>In fact, Teika was initially not invited, the instigation of the rival Rokujō clan&#39;s leader, Suetsune <sup id="_ref-suetsune_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-suetsune" title="">[20]</a></sup>and the connivance of Michichika.<sup id="_ref-connivance_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-connivance" title="">[21]</a></sup> Suetsune and Teika were bitter enemies; just a few months before, Teika had humiliated Suetsune by calling him &#34;that fake poet&#34; and publicly refusing to participate in a poetry competition with Suetsune.<sup id="_ref-Seeds-1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seeds-1" title="">[22]</a></sup>His revenge was well-done; Teika was furious, writing in his <i>Meigetsuki</i>: :<i>&#34;I never heard of such a thing as choosing only senior poets </i>[writes Teika about the pretext used to exclude him]<i>. I can just see Suetsune at the bottom of this, contriving by some bribe that I be left out. It has to be Suetsune, Tsuneie, that whole family. Well, I have no regrets, for there is no possible hope for me now. But I did write in confidence to Kintsune so this may all come out eventually.

<p>Teika&#39;s appeals to the unrelenting Michichika failed<sup id="_ref-and-god-hardened-his-heart_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-and-god-hardened-his-heart" title="">[25]</a></sup>, and so Shunzei stepped in with an eloquent letter (the well-known <i>Waji sojo</i>; &#34;Appeal in Japanese&#34; - writing in Japanese as opposed to the official Chinese was considered a mark of sincerity<sup id="_ref-and-god-hardened-his-heart_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-and-god-hardened-his-heart" title="">[25]</a></sup>) addressed to Go-Toba, arguing that such an exclusion was without precedent, and motivated by base jealousy on their opponent&#39;s part:
</p><dl><dd><i>&#34;Of late the people who call themselves poets have all been mediocrities. The poems they compose are unpleasant to hear, wordy and and lacking in finesse.&#34;<sup id="_ref-seeds-654_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-seeds-654" title="">[26]</a></sup></i></dd></dl>
<p>As Keene writes, &#34;He denounced by name Teika&#39;s enemy Suetsune, calling
him an ignoramus, and urged Gotoba not to be misled by his machinations.&#34;<sup id="_ref-seeds-654_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-seeds-654" title="">[26]</a></sup>Gotoba relented at this appeal
from a man he greatly respected (the second time Shunzei had so interceded on Teika&#39;s behalf; the first time was in 1185 when Teika had lost his temper and struck a superior - the lesser general
Masayuki - with a lamp)<sup id="_ref-miner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-miner" title="">[27]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-keene-and-masayuki_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keene-and-masayuki" title="">[28]</a></sup>. He allowed Teika, along with two other &#34;young&#34; poets, Fujiwara no Ietaka (1159-1237; 1158-1237, according to Brower<sup id="_ref-brower-age_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brower-age" title="">[29]</a></sup>), adopted son of Jakuren and pupil to Shunzei<sup id="_ref-ietaka_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ietaka" title="">[30]</a></sup>, and Takafusa (1148-1209)<sup id="_ref-brower-age_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brower-age" title="">[29]</a></sup>to enter the contest. Teika was overjoyed at this turn of events:
</p><dl><dd><i>&#34;Early this morning came a message from Lord Kintsune that last evening the Ex-Emperor ordered my inclusion among the participants for the hundred-poem sequences.....To have been added to the list for this occasion fills me with inexpressible joy. Though they can hinder me no more, I am still convinced that the trouble was all due to the machinations of those evil men.

<p>Teika furiously worked for more than two weeks<sup id="_ref-long-composition_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-long-composition" title="">[32]</a></sup>
to complete the full sequence, and when he finally turned his <i>Shoji hyakushu</i> in a day late, Go-Toba was so eager he read the poems immediately. Go-Toba&#39;s personal secretary, Minamoto Ienaga, kept a diary (the <i>Minamoto Ienaga nikki</i>) which eulogistically concerned itself with Go-Toba&#39;s poetic activities,<sup id="_ref-ienaga-diary_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ienaga-diary" title="">[33]</a></sup>and he records that it was Teika&#39;s hundred-poem sequence, and more specifically, poem number 93 which was directly responsible for Teika&#39;s being granted the special permission necessary to be admitted to the Retired Emperor&#39;s court (distinct from the reigning emperor&#39;s court; this special admittance was crucial to any future patronage); this is scarcely surprising as the 100-poem sequences submitted were of uniformly high quality (more poems originating in the sequences Go-Toba commissioned were included in the <i>Shin Kokinshū</i> than from any other source except the enormous &#34;Poetry Contest in 1,500 Rounds&#34;).<sup id="_ref-655-keene_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-655-keene" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

<p>Interestingly, this poem is both a fine example of the <i>jukkai</i> (&#34;personal grievances&#34;<sup id="_ref-definition-of-jukkai_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-definition-of-jukkai" title="">[36]</a></sup>) genre and as Minamoto no Ienaga first pointed out<sup id="_ref-shunzei's-poem_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shunzei's-poem" title="">[37]</a></sup>, also an allusion to the poem (preserved, along with Go-Shirakawa&#39;s reply, in the Imperial anthology <i><a href="/wiki/Senzai_Wakash%C5%AB" id="w">Senzai Wakashū</a></i><sup id="_ref-shunzei-to-Go-Shirakawa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shunzei-to-Go-Shirakawa" title="">[38]</a></sup>) Shunzei had sent Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa 14 years previously, imploring him to forgive Teika for striking a superior with a candlestick; &#34;the allusion conveys the hope that just as Shunzei&#39;s poem obtained his erring son&#39;s restoration to rank and office under Go-Shirakawa, now Teika&#39;s own poem will win him admission to Go-Toba&#39;s Court despite his connection with the &#34;disgraced&#34; Kujō faction.&#34;<sup id="_ref-long-composition_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-long-composition" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Teika_and_Go-Toba_quarrel" name="Teika_and_Go-Toba_quarrel"></a><h4>Teika and Go-Toba quarrel</h4>
<p>This favorable patronage and collaboration eventually soured even as Teika&#39;s relation with <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Juntoku" id="w">Emperor Juntoku</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minamoto_no_Sanetomo" id="w">Minamoto no Sanetomo</a> deepened, over many things such as differences in how one should use &#34;association and progression&#34; (as Brower terms it) in poetic sequences. In 100-poem sequences and the like, the poems were usually in one of several groups (the four seasons were common ones, as was love); the poems generally formed an integrated sequence in which they dealt with the same subject matter, proceeding from stage to stage (for instance, a sequence on Love might proceed from loneliness, to falling in love, to a mature relationship, and then the sorrow when it ends) or which refer to elements of previous poems (a technique later central to <a href="/wiki/Renga" id="w">renga</a> sequences). Go-Toba used such techniques consistently and often, whereas Teika&#39;s use was more erratic.  During the compilation of the <i>Shin Kokinshū</i>, there were other differences, apparently over how wide-ranging a net to throw for poems:
</p><dl><dd><i>&#34;In a situation like the present, where he [Go-Toba]has included poems by a great many people one has never heard of, whose names have remained in almost total obscurity for generations, and persons who have only recently begun to attract attention had as many as ten poems apiece included- in such a situation it is no particular distinction for me to have forty-odd [46]poems chosen, or for Ietaka to have a score or more. The Ex-Sovereign&#39;s recent decisions make it appear he is choosing men rather than poems- a questionable procedure.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-too-many-indies_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-too-many-indies" title="">[43]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Teika&#39;s displeasure manifested itself in more petty ways, such as refusing to attend a banquet in 1205 (300 years after the <i>Kokinshū</i> was completed) celebrating the official completion of the <i>Shin Kokinshū</i> because there was no precedent for such a banquet (apparently he was not convinced by the precedent of the banquet celebrating the completion of the <i><a href="/wiki/Nihon_Shoki" id="w">Nihon Shoki</a></i>)<sup id="_ref-keene-658_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keene-658" title="">[44]</a></sup>; Go-Toba reciprocated by cutting Teika out of the process of continually revising the <i>Shin Kokinshū</i><sup id="_ref-coolness_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-coolness" title="">[45]</a></sup> (while it was officially complete by the date of the banquet, it was <i>de facto</i> incomplete as the Japanese Preface only existed in rough drafts<sup id="_ref-keene-658_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keene-658" title="">[44]</a></sup>and because Go-Toba would continue revising the selection of poems for some time thereafter, only releasing the final edition approximately 6 years later, sometime after the ninth month of 1210;<sup id="_ref-tinkering-with-shinkokinshu_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tinkering-with-shinkokinshu" title="">[46]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-keene-659_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keene-659" title="">[47]</a></sup>indeed, Go-Toba would continue revising it until his death, although the later revisions are not extant).<sup id="_ref-tit-for-tat_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tit-for-tat" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition, there apparently were serious personality conflicts, which lead Go-Toba to write once, after praising Teika&#39;s poetry, that:
</p><dl><dd><i>&#34;The way Teika behaved, as if he knew all about poetry, was really quite extraordinary. Especially when he was defending his own opinion, he would act like the man who insisted a stag was a horse. He was utterly oblivious of others, and would exceed all reason, refusing to listen to anything other people had to say.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-arrogant-teika_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-arrogant-teika" title="">[49]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>(The stag and horse anecdote refers to the ancient Chinese <a href="/wiki/Chao_Kao" id="w">Chao Kao</a> (d. 207 BCE), who revolted after an incident in which he brought a stag to the Imperial court, claimed it was actually a horse, and saw that more of the officials sycophantically agreed with him, rather than the emperor who pointed out that the horse was actually a stag.)</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Donald_Keene" id="w">Donald Keene</a> believes that as Teika grew more important, he resented Go-Toba&#39;s peremptory use of him.<sup id="_ref-Teika-as-servant_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Teika-as-servant" title="">[50]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-illness_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-illness" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-old-and-lame_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-old-and-lame" title="">[51]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-tiring_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tiring" title="">[52]</a></sup>In his later years, Go-Toba took issue not merely with Teika&#39;s personality, but also with his poetry, complaining of Teika&#39;s more liberal style that Teika (among other things<sup id="_ref-the-many-faults-of-teika_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-the-many-faults-of-teika" title="">[53]</a></sup>) &#34;by contrast, paid no attention whatsoever to the topic. For this reason in recent times even beginners have all come to be like this. It is outrageous. Only when one concentrates very hard upon a compound topic and composes a poem which centers upon the topic is the result of any interest. This modern style is sheer carelessness. It is absolutely essential to practice composing poems on compound topics in the correct way.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Japanese-poetry2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Japanese-poetry2" title="">[54]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-modern-carelessness_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-modern-carelessness" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>In any event, the precipitating events were two incidents, one in 1207 and the next in 1220. In 1207, Go-Toba decided to organize the creation of 46 landscape screens for the Saishō Shitennō Temple which he had had built in 1205 (interestingly, apparently &#34;in order to enlist divine aid in the overthrow the feudal government&#34;)<sup id="_ref-screens-to-overthrow-uncle-sam_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-screens-to-overthrow-uncle-sam" title="">[56]</a></sup>; each of these screens would also have a <i>waka</i> on the famous landscape depicted, composed by a leading poet, who would compose the requisite 46, with the best poems for each landscape selected. Of course, Teika was asked to contribute, but one (on the &#34;Wood of Ikuta&#34;, a famous and picturesque woodland attached to the <a href="/wiki/Ikuta_Shrine" id="w">Ikuta Shrine</a> of <a href="/wiki/Settsu_Province" id="w">Settsu Province</a>, modern-day <a href="/wiki/Kobe" id="w">Kobe</a>; it was famous for being a battlefield between the <a href="/wiki/Minamoto" id="w">Minamoto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Taira" id="w">Taira</a> clans, as well as for its scenic beauty<sup id="_ref-wood-of-ikuta_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wood-of-ikuta" title="">[57]</a></sup>) was rejected by Go-Toba; not because it was a bad poem, but because it was a &#34;poor model&#34;, as Keene puts it.<sup id="_ref-estrangement-1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-estrangement-1" title="">[58]</a></sup>Teika, already annoyed by the minimal notice for the contest and the lack of time for composing the poems (he had to turn them in two days after he was first informed of the contest), began complaining about Go-Toba and attacking his poetic judgement, both with regard to the <i>Shin Kokinshū</i> and the poems selected from the screens.<sup id="_ref-criticism_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-criticism" title="">[59]</a></sup>Nothing came of this incident, but nevertheless, the damage had been done.<sup id="_ref-coolness_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-coolness" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second incident took place in the second month of 1220 and is described in a preface to the two poems concerned as recorded in Teika&#39;s personal anthology, the <i>Shū gusō</i>; during the 6-year period covering such events as Teika&#39;s banishment from Go-Toba&#39;s court and Go-Toba&#39;s participation in the <a href="/wiki/J%C5%8Dky%C5%AB_War" id="w">Jōkyū War</a> of 1221, Teika&#39;s diary is silent.<sup id="_ref-silent-diary_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-silent-diary" title="">[60]</a></sup> Teika was asked to participate in a poem competition on the 13th of the second month; Teika declined, citing as a reason the anniversary of his mother&#39;s death 26 years previous, in 1194. Go-Toba and his officials sent several letters to him, strongly urging him to come, and Teika eventually gave in, arriving with only two waka. The headnote to the two poems reads:</p>
<dl><dd><i>&#34;Having been summoned to the palace for a poetry gathering on the thirteenth day of the second month in the second year of Shokyu [1220], I had begged to be excused because of a ritual defilement, it being the anniversary of my mother&#39;s death. I thought no more about it, but quite unexpectedly in the evening of the appointed day, the Archivist Iemitsu come with a letter from the ex-emperor, saying that I was not the hold back on account of the defilement, but was to come in any case. I continued to refuse, but after the ex-emperor had sent two more letters insisting on my presence, I hastily wrote down the following two poems and took them with me.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-teika's-version_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-teika's-version" title="">[61]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>The first <i>waka</i> was critical of Go-Toba but otherwise fairly innocuous, but the second was quite pointed, obliquely attacking Go-Toba both for forcing Teika to attend Go-Toba&#39;s contest when Teika was memorializing his mother and also for insufficiently promoting Teika  (the final line is a variation on a phrase dealing with &#34;double griefs&#34;):</p>

<p>Go-Toba saw this attack as both ingratitude of the rankest sort and the culmination of a series of affronts, this latest being petty resentment at what Go-Toba would have seen as a flimsy pretext for attempting to get out of the poetry competition. Accordingly, he banished Teika from his court, a banishment that would last for more than a year; this feud distressed devotees of poetry.<sup id="_ref-juntoku_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-juntoku" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Teika_in_the_ascendancy" name="Teika_in_the_ascendancy"></a><h4>Teika in the ascendancy</h4>
<p>Possibly another a factor in this estrangement was politics - Teika had had the good fortune of being selected in 1209 as a poetry teacher to the new and young <a href="/wiki/Shogun" id="w">shogun</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minamoto_no_Sanetomo" id="w">Minamoto no Sanetomo</a>; the Shogunate was a rival and superior authority to that of the Emperors and the Imperial court. It was probably to the unhappy Sanetomo that Teika addressed the prefatory essay to his didactic collection, <i>Kindai shūka</i> (&#34;Superior Poems of Our Time&#34;), and his treatise on poetry <i>Maigetsusho</i> (&#34;Monthly Notes&#34;). Go-Toba would become an enemy of the then-bedridden Teika.  Fortunately for Teika, Go-Toba would be exiled by the <a href="/wiki/Kamakura_shogunate" id="w">Kamakura shogunate</a> in 1221 for the rest of life to the <a href="/wiki/Oki_Islands" id="w">Oki Islands</a> after Go-Toba led a failed rebellion against the Shogunate (the <a href="/wiki/J%C5%8Dky%C5%AB_War" id="w">Jōkyū War</a>) which Go-Toba had long hated;<sup id="_ref-go-toba-fought-the-law-and-the-law-won_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-go-toba-fought-the-law-and-the-law-won" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>Teika&#39;s political fortunes improved in this period, as it was after Go-Toba&#39;s exile that Teika was appointed compiler of the ninth imperial anthology, the <i><a href="/wiki/Shinchokusen_Wakash%C5%AB" id="w">Shinchokusen Wakashū</a></i> (&#34;New Imperial Collection&#34;; completed c. 1234). While it was a great honor, it was poorly received except by conservatives. According to <a href="/wiki/Donald_Keene" id="w">Donald Keene</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shunzei%26%2339%3Bs_Daughter" id="w">Shunzei&#39;s Daughter</a>&#34;declared that if it had not been compiled by Teika she would have refused even to take it into her hands.&#34; (From a letter sent to <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Tameie" id="w">Fujiwara no Tameie</a>, Teika&#39;s son) <sup id="_ref-pg-706_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pg-706" title="">[65]</a></sup>. She and others also criticized it for apparently deliberately excluding any of the objectively excellent poems produced by the three <a href="/wiki/Retired_Emperor" id="w">Retired Emperors</a> exiled in the aftermath of the Jōkyū War <sup id="_ref-pg-706_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pg-706" title="">[65]</a></sup>This absence has been variously attributed to vengefulness on the part of Teika, or simply a desire to not potentially offend the Kamakura shogunate.<sup id="_ref-no-emperors_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-no-emperors" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p>Teika was advanced at the age of 70 to the court rank of &#34;Gon Chūnagon&#34; (<i>Acting Middle Counselor</i>; this was the second highest office in the Supreme Council of State). </p>
<p>But even Teika&#39;s improved fortunes could not insulate him entirely from the various famines and disasters that wracked the country in this period, and which greatly exacberated his illnesses:
</p><dl><dd><i>&#34;Today I had my servants dig up the garden (the north one), and plant wheat there. Even if we only grow a little, it will sustain our hunger in a bad year. Don&#39;t make fun of me! What other stratagem does a poor old man have?&#34; (</i>Meigetsuki<i>, 13th day of the 10th month, 1230)<sup id="_ref-famine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-famine" title="">[67]</a></sup></i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><i>&#34;Starving people collapse, and their dead bodies fill the streets. Every day the numbers increase....The stench has gradually reached my house.

<p>During the later portions of his life, Teika experimented with refining his style of <i>ushin</i>, teaching and writing it; in addition to his critical works and the manuscripts he studied and copied out, he experimented with the then-very young and immature form of <i><a href="/wiki/Renga" id="w">renga</a></i>- &#34;They are an amusement to me in my dotage.&#34;<sup id="_ref-renga_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-renga" title="">[68]</a></sup>He died in 1241, in <a href="/wiki/Kyoto" id="w">Kyoto</a>, and was buried at a <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" id="w">Buddhist</a> temple named &#34;Shokokuji&#34;.</p>
<a id="Rival_descendants" name="Rival_descendants"></a><h3>Rival descendants</h3>
<p>One of his 27 children by various women<sup id="_ref-what-a-womanizer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-what-a-womanizer" title="">[69]</a></sup>(and one of two legitimate sons), <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Tameie" id="w">Fujiwara no Tameie</a> (1198-1275; he is remembered  as a reluctant heir, in youth inclining rather to <a href="/wiki/Kemari" id="w">court football</a> at the encouragement of Go-Toba<sup id="_ref-criticism_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-criticism" title="">[59]</a></sup>than to poetry), would carry on Teika&#39;s poetic legacy. Tameie&#39;s descendants would split into three branches: the conservative elder <a href="/wiki/Nij%C5%8D" id="w">Nijō</a> branch (founded by Tameie&#39;s elder son, <a href="/wiki/Tameuji_no_Teika" id="w">Tameuji no Teika</a> (1222-1286); the middle branch of the Kyōgoku founded by <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Tamenori" id="w">Fujiwara no Tamenori</a> (1226-1279), which, before it went extinct in 1332 with the death of Fujiwara no Tamekane, merged with the Reizei at the prompting of the nun <a href="/wiki/Abutsu" id="w">Abutsu</a>; and the younger, more liberal <a href="/wiki/Reizei" id="w">Reizei</a> branch, founded by Tameie&#39; younger son <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Tamesuke" id="w">Fujiwara no Tamesuke</a> (b. 1263) by the Abutsu (d. <i>circa</i> 1283; a poet and a great <a href="/wiki/Diarist" id="w">diarist</a>, especially remembered for her diary <i>Isayoi Nikki</i> (&#34;Diary of the Waning Moon&#34;) chronicling her legal battles to get the Kamakura shogunate to stop Tameuji from disinheriting Tamesuke of the Hosokawa estate near the capital that Tameie had left Tamesuke).<sup id="_ref-miner-lineage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-miner-lineage" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is a testament to Teika&#39;s importance that the poetic history of the next centuries is in large part a story of the battles between the rival branches; indeed, it is this rivalry that is chiefly responsible for the great number of forgeries attributed to Teika. When the Reizei lost a court case concerning possession of the Hosokawa estate Tameie had willed to Tamesuke, they were ordered to hand over the valuable manuscripts and documents inherited from Teika and Tameie over to the Nijō; they outwardly complied, but along with the few genuine documents whose existence the Nijō had already learned of, they mostly included forgeries which the Nijō had little choice but to accept. In retaliation, the Nijō manufactured a number of forgeries of their own, the better to buttress their claims.<sup id="_ref-forgery_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-forgery" title="">[71]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-buttress-texts_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-buttress-texts" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>
<p>After a period of Reizei ascendancy under <a href="/wiki/Rezei_no_Tamehide" id="w">Rezei no Tamehide</a> (great-grandson of Teika) (b. 1302?, d. 1372), they suffered a decline and a consequent rise in the fortunes of the Nijō, as Tamehide&#39;s son, Iametuni, became a <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" id="w">Buddhist</a> monk. However, the Nijō soon suffered setbacks of their own under the wastrel Nijō no Tameshige (b. 1325, d. 1385), whose promising son, Nijō no Tametō (b. 1341, d. 1381), died comparatively young, killed by a brigand.</p>
<p>In a further disaster for the Nijō, Tametō&#39;s son, Nijō no Tamemigi was killed by a brigand as well in 1399 (?), effectively wiping out the Nijō as an organized force. Under the grandson of Tamehide, Tanemasa (b. 1361, d. 1417), the Rezei achieved temporary victory in the time of <a href="/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dtetsu" id="w">Shōtetsu</a>.<sup id="_ref-Shōtetsu_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shōtetsu" title="">[73]</a></sup>Ironically, the once-liberal Reizei would become associated during and after the <a href="/wiki/Meji_Era" id="w">Meji Era</a> with the ultra-conservatives of the &#34;Palace School&#34;.</p>

<p>Teika selected the works for the <i>Ogura <a href="/wiki/Hyakunin_Isshu" id="w">Hyakunin Isshu</a></i>, an anthology of a hundred poems by a hundred poets. His <i>Ogura Hyakunin Isshū</i> was later thought to be a book of <i>waka</i> theory in which all types of ideal <i>waka</i> and all techniques were laid out; disputes over specific style and whether to be conservative or liberal that divided his descendants into a number of feuding schools/clans like the <a href="/wiki/Reizei" id="w">Reizei</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kyogoku" id="w">Kyogoku</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Nij%C5%8D" id="w">Nijō</a>.</p>
<p>Teika made many <sup id="_ref-many-copies_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-many-copies" title="">[75]</a></sup>manuscript copies of Japanese classics, including such landmarks of Japanese literature as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji" id="w">The Tale of Genji</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Ise_monogatari" id="w">The Tales of Ise</a></i> and the <i><a href="/wiki/Kokin_Wakash%C5%AB" id="w">Kokinshū</a></i> anthology<sup id="_ref-Kokinshu_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kokinshu" title="">[76]</a></sup>. In his days, the ancient Japanese pronunciations were lost or difficult to understand, rendering the <a href="/wiki/Orthography" id="w">orthography</a> of <a href="/wiki/Kana" id="w">kana</a> confused and uncertain. Teika researched old documents and recovered the earlier system of deciding between interpretations of <a href="/wiki/Kana" id="w">kana</a>, and developed a systematic orthography which was used until the modern Meiji period. He applied his kana system to his manuscripts, which were known for their accuracy and general high quality and called <i>Teika bon</i> (&#34;Teika text&#34;).  Using his method he was able to document the accurate pronunciation of earlier <i>waka</i> like the ones in the <i><a href="/wiki/Kokin_Wakash%C5%AB" id="w">Kokin Wakashū</a></i>.

Teika wrote in his <i>Maigetsusho</i> that the best poems were spontaneous and original, but nevertheless traditional:
</p><dl><dd><i>&#34;But such a notion is quite erroneous. For if we were to call such verses as that superior, then any poem at all we might write could be a fine one. No, first the powers of invention must be freed by reciting endless possibilities over and over to oneself. Then, suddenly and spontaneously, from among all the lines one is composing, may emerge a poem whose treatment of the topic is different from the common run, a verse that is somehow superior to the rest. It is full of poetic feeling, lofty in cadence, skillful, with resonances above and beyond the words themselves. It is dignified in effect, its phrasing original, yet smooth and gentle. It is interesting, suffused with an atmosphere subtle yet clear. It is richly evocative, its emotion not tense and nervous but sensible from the appropriateness of the imagery. Such a poem is not to be composed by conscious effort, but if a man will only persist in unremitting practice, he may produce one spontaneously.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-Maigetsusho-2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Maigetsusho-2" title="">[78]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>The following is an example of how Teika used old and classic imagery such as Takasago and Onoe, as well as pine and cherry trees, in fresh ways:</p>

<p>His poems were described as remarkable for their elegance and exemplars of Teika&#39;s ideals, in his early and later years (respectively; Teika considerably modified his personal beliefs during his 40s, after the death of Shunzei,and simplified his style of composition), of the styles of <a href="/wiki/Yoen" id="w">yoen</a>- one of the ten orthodox styles Teika defined and defended in his poetic criticism, with some of the others being the <i>onihishigitei</i> (&#34;demon-quelling force&#34;) style, the style of <i>sabi</i> or &#34;loneliness&#34; (closely related to <a href="/wiki/Mono_no_aware" id="w">mono no aware</a>), the style of <a href="/wiki/Yugen" id="w">yugen</a>, or &#34;mystery and depth&#34;; the yoen style was concerned with &#34;ethereal beauty&#34;, and <i><a href="/wiki/Ushin" id="w">ushin</a></i> (&#34;deep feeling&#34; or &#34;conviction of feeling&#34;. This shift in style from yoen to ushin was intended to achieve a certain sort of <i>makoto</i>, or <a href="/wiki/Integrity" id="w">integrity</a><sup id="_ref-Japanese-poetry_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Japanese-poetry" title="">[80]</a></sup>; Teika sometimes referred to his aim as <i>ushin</i> (&#34;deep feeling&#34;), which confusingly was also the name of one of the ten styles. The yoen style was one of the most popular in his time due in no small part to Teika&#39;s  of it (yoen had first been described by <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Mototoshi" id="w">Fujiwara no Mototoshi</a> in the 1150s, but had been only marginally successful); years later, the <a href="/wiki/Symbolists" id="w">Symbolists</a> would admire and emulate (to a degree) his use of language to evoke atmosphere in his brief poems in the yoen style. An excellent example (and one later chosen for an Imperial anthology) is the first poem below:</p>

A diary Teika wrote about a trip to Kumano he took with Go-Toba and Michichika; like his other diary, it is written in classical Chinese, except for the wakas along the way to the shrines there that Go-Toba was so devoted to that this trip was but one of more than thirty. Teika seems not to have enjoyed the trip; his diary often records concern over his health and matters of decorum such as the proper clothes to wear. <sup id="_ref-kumano_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kumano" title="">[82]</a></sup></li>

This sequence was constructed when he was 47, after the death of Shunzei, which depressed Teika, as evidenced by his writing in the <i>Kindai shūka</i> that he had &#34;forgotten the color of the followers of words; the well-springs of inspiration have run dry.&#34;)<sup id="_ref-Brower-shuka_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brower-shuka" title="">[85]</a></sup></li>

As its comprehensiveness might suggest, it is an extremely valuable resource for understanding the court and Teika&#39;s place in the Imperial court, even despite its incompleteness- available extant versions consist of 56 scrolls (the Reizei family possesses in its family library <a href="/wiki/Holograph" id="w">holographs</a> of 56 and copies of two more), while scholars estimate that the original was comprised of over 180 scrolls.) Among its many interesting passages (some quoted previously) about Teika&#39;s career and life is a famous passage from the ninth month of 1180 about Teika&#39;s indifference to political or military advancement, in which he aristocratically remarked that &#34;Reports of disturbances and punitive expeditions fill one&#39;s ears, but I pay them no attention. The red banners and the expeditions against the traitors are no concern of mine.&#34; (Here, &#34;red banners&#34; probably refers to the Imperial standard; the last line is possibly a reference to a poem by <a href="/wiki/Po_Chu-i" id="w">Po Chu-i</a> in which he tells of how he has been effectively exiled and passes his time playing <a href="/wiki/Go_(board_game)" id="w">Go</a>).</li>

The son of Shunzei, Teika lived to an advanced age constantly plagued by both recurring illness and reverses and advances in his family&#39;s fortunes. Similarly, his poetry and critical writings also underwent a series of changes in the course of his life, leaving behind the most substantial and intense poetic legacy by a single poet in Japanese history.&#34;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.temcauley.staff.shef.ac.uk/teika.shtml" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.temcauley.staff.shef.ac.uk/teika.shtml">http://www.temcauley.staff.shef.ac.uk/teika.shtml</a></li>
<li>&#34;Teika&#39;s unique reputation rested in part upon his accomplishment as the leading figure among the many fine poets of the <i>Shinkokin Jidai</i>, the period of fifty-odd years in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries when revival and innovation in the native poetry were exemplified in <i><a href="/wiki/Shin_Kokin_Wakash%C5%AB" id="w">Shin Kokinshū</a></i>, c. 1204, the eighth, and in many respects the greatest, of the imperially sponsored anthologies of classical verse. As one of the six compilers of the anthology, and with forty-six of his poems included in it, Teika stood at the forefront of the younger and more innovative poets of his day, and his various experiments with diction, rhetoric, and figurative language, as well as with new styles, modes, and aesthetic effects, were widely imitated by his contemporaries. After his death, his quarreling descendants were recognized as the ultimate authorities on all poetic matters, and through them Teika&#39;s influence pervaded six hundred years of Japanese poetic history.&#34;   Extract from &#34;<a class="externallink" href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0027-0741%28198524%2940%3A4%3C399%3AFTM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-S" rel="nofollow" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0027-0741%28198524%2940%3A4%3C399%3AFTM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-S"> Fujiwara Teika&#39;s Maigetsusho</a>&#34; by Robert H.
