She was a <a href="/wiki/Poet" id="w">poet</a>, <a href="/wiki/Memoir" id="w">memoirist</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Epigram" id="w">epigrammatist</a>, but believed her life was her true work of art. {{Fact}}</p>
<p>Her salon, held at her home on Paris&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Rive_Gauche" id="w">Left Bank</a> for more than 60 years, brought together writers and artists from around the world, including many of the leading figures in French literature as well as the American and British <a href="/wiki/Modernists" id="w">Modernists</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Lost_Generation" id="w">Lost Generation</a>.  She worked to promote writing by women, forming a &#34;Women&#39;s Academy&#34; in response to the all-male <a href="/wiki/French_Academy" id="w">French Academy</a>, while also providing support and inspiration to male writers from <a href="/wiki/Remy_de_Gourmont" id="w">Remy de Gourmont</a> to <a href="/wiki/Truman_Capote" id="w">Truman Capote</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>She was openly <a href="/wiki/Lesbian" id="w">lesbian</a> and began publishing love poems to women under her own name as early as 1900, considering scandal &#34;the best way of getting rid of nuisances&#34;.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  In her writings she supported <a href="/wiki/Feminism" id="w">feminism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paganism" id="w">paganism</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pacifism" id="w">pacifism</a>.  She opposed <a href="/wiki/Monogamy" id="w">monogamy</a> and had many overlapping long- and short-term relationships, including an on-and-off romance with poet <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e_Vivien" id="w">Renée Vivien</a> and a 50-year relationship with painter <a href="/wiki/Romaine_Brooks" id="w">Romaine Brooks</a>.  Her life and love affairs served as inspiration for many novels, ranging from the salacious French bestseller <i>Sapphic Idyll</i> to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Well_of_Loneliness" id="w">The Well of Loneliness</a></i>, arguably the most famous lesbian novel of the 20th century.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>

Natalie Barney was born in 1876 to Albert Clifford Barney, son of a wealthy manufacturer of railway cars in <a href="/wiki/Dayton%2C_Ohio" id="w">Dayton, Ohio</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Alice_Pike_Barney" id="w">Alice Pike Barney</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  When she was six years old her family spent the summer at <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>&#39;s Long Beach Hotel, where <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Wilde" id="w">Oscar Wilde</a> happened to be speaking on his American lecture tour.  Wilde scooped her up as she ran past him fleeing a group of small boys, held her out of their reach, then sat her down on his knee and told her a story.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The next day he joined Barney and her mother on the beach; their conversation changed the course of Alice&#39;s life, inspiring her to pursue art seriously despite her husband&#39;s disapproval.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  She later studied under <a href="/wiki/Carolus-Duran" id="w">Carolus-Duran</a> and <a href="/wiki/James_McNeill_Whistler" id="w">James McNeill Whistler</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Many of her paintings are now in the <a href="/wiki/Smithsonian_American_Art_Museum" id="w">Smithsonian American Art Museum</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Like many girls of her time, Barney had a haphazard education.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  Her interest in the <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French language</a> began with a <a href="/wiki/Governess" id="w">governess</a> who motivated her by reading <a href="/wiki/Jules_Verne" id="w">Jules Verne</a>&#39;s stories aloud, so that she had to learn quickly to understand them.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>  Later she and her younger sister <a href="/wiki/Laura_Clifford_Barney" id="w">Laura Clifford Barney</a> attended Les Ruches, a French boarding school founded by feminist <a href="/wiki/Marie_Souvestre" id="w">Marie Souvestre</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  As an adult, she spoke fluently and without an accent; she made her home in Paris, and nearly all her published works were written in French.</p>
<p>When she was ten, her family moved from Ohio to <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>, spending summers in <a href="/wiki/Bar_Harbor_(town)%2C_Maine" id="w">Bar Harbor, Maine</a>.  As the rebellious and unconventional daughter of one of the wealthiest families in town, she was frequently mentioned in Washington newspapers.  In her early twenties she made headlines by galloping through Bar Harbor while driving a second horse on a lead ahead of her, and by riding astride instead of <a href="/wiki/Sidesaddle" id="w">sidesaddle</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

Barney said she knew by age 12 that she was lesbian,<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> and was determined to &#34;live openly, without hiding anything&#34;.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>  In 1899, after seeing the <a href="/wiki/Courtesan" id="w">courtesan</a> <a href="/wiki/Liane_de_Pougy" id="w">Liane de Pougy</a> at a dance hall in Paris, she presented herself at de Pougy&#39;s residence in a page costume and announced that she was a &#34;page of love&#34; sent by <a href="/wiki/Sappho" id="w">Sappho</a>.  Although de Pougy was one of the most famous women in France, constantly sought after by wealthy and titled men, Barney&#39;s audacity charmed her.  Their brief affair became the subject of de Pougy&#39;s tell-all <i><a href="/wiki/Roman_%C3%A0_clef" id="w">roman à clef</a></i> <i>Idylle Saphique</i> (<i>Sapphic Idyll</i>).  Published in 1901, the book became the talk of Paris and was reprinted at least 69 times in its first year; soon it was well known that Barney was the model for one of the characters.  By that time, however, the two had already broken up, after quarreling repeatedly over Barney&#39;s desire to &#34;rescue&#34; de Pougy from her life as a courtesan.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Barney herself contributed a chapter to <i>Idylle Saphique,</i> in which she described reclining at de Pougy&#39;s feet in a screened box at the theater, watching <a href="/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt" id="w">Sarah Bernhardt</a> play <a href="/wiki/Prince_Hamlet" id="w">Hamlet</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  During intermission Barney, as &#34;Flossie&#34;, compares Hamlet&#39;s situation with that of women:  &#34;What is there for women who feel the passion for action when pitiless Destiny hold them in chains?  Destiny made us women at a time when the law of men is the only law that is recognized.&#34;<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>  She also wrote her own <a href="/wiki/Epistolary_novel" id="w">epistolary novel</a> about the affair, <i>Lettres à une Connue</i> (<i>Letters to a Woman I Have Known</i>).  Although she failed to find a publisher for the book, and later called it naive and clumsy, it is notable for its discussion of <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality" id="w">homosexuality</a>, which Barney regarded as natural, comparing it to <a href="/wiki/Albinism" id="w">albinism</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup>  &#34;My queerness&#34;, she said, &#34;is not a vice, is not deliberate, and harms no one.&#34;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Ren%C3%A9e_Vivien" name="Ren%C3%A9e_Vivien"></a><h2> Renée Vivien </h2>
<p>In November 1899 Barney met the poet Pauline Tarn, better known by her pen name <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e_Vivien" id="w">Renée Vivien</a>.  For Vivien it was love at first sight, while Barney became fascinated with Vivien after hearing her recite one of her poems,<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> which she described as &#34;haunted by the desire for death&#34;.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>  Their romantic relationship was also a creative exchange that inspired both of them to write; Barney provided a feminist theoretical framework that Vivien explored in her poetry.  They adapted the imagery of the <a href="/wiki/Symbolist" id="w">Symbolist</a> poets and the conventions of <a href="/wiki/Courtly_love" id="w">courtly love</a> to describe love between women, and found examples of heroic women in history and myth.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Sappho" id="w">Sappho</a> was an especially important influence; they studied <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> in order to read the surviving fragments of her poetry in the original, and both wrote plays about her life.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

Vivien saw Barney as a <a href="/wiki/Muse" id="w">muse</a>; as Barney put it, &#34;she had found new inspiration through me, almost without knowing me.&#34;  Barney felt that Vivien had cast her as a <i><a href="/wiki/Femme_fatale" id="w">femme fatale</a></i> and that she wanted &#34;to lose herself... entirely in suffering&#34; for the sake of her art.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>  Vivien also believed in <a href="/wiki/Fidelity" id="w">fidelity</a>, which Barney was unwilling to agree to.  In 1901, while Barney was visiting her family in Washington, D.C., Vivien stopped answering her letters.  Barney tried for years to get her back, at one point persuading a friend, the operatic mezzo-soprano <a href="/wiki/Emma_Calv%C3%A9" id="w">Emma Calvé</a>, to sing under Vivien&#39;s window so that she could throw a poem, wrapped around a bouquet of flowers, up to her on her balcony.  Both flowers and poem were intercepted and returned by a governess.<sup id="_ref-jay-11_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jay-11" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1904 she wrote <i>Je Me Souviens</i> (<i>I Remember</i>), an intensely personal prose poem about their relationship, and presented a single handwritten copy to Vivien in an attempt to win her back.  They reconciled and travelled together to <a href="/wiki/Lesbos_Island" id="w">Lesbos</a>, where they lived happily together for a short time and talked about starting a school of poetry for women like the one that, according to tradition, Sappho had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before.  Soon, however, Vivien received a letter from her lover Hélène, the Baroness de Zuylen de Nyevelt, and decided to go to <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" id="w">Constantinople</a> to break up with her in person.  She planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward, but instead she stayed with the Baroness.  This time the breakup was permanent.<sup id="_ref-jay-11_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jay-11" title="">[25]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>In the following years Vivien&#39;s health declined rapidly.  According to <a href="/wiki/Colette" id="w">Colette</a>, a friend and neighbor of Vivien&#39;s, she drank heavily—rinsing her mouth with perfumed water to conceal the extent of her drinking—and ate almost nothing.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup>  Colette&#39;s account has led some to refer to Vivien as <a href="/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa" id="w">anorexic</a>,<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> though that diagnosis did not yet exist during her lifetime.  She was also addicted to the sedative <a href="/wiki/Chloral_hydrate" id="w">chloral hydrate</a>.  In 1908 she attempted suicide by overdosing on <a href="/wiki/Laudanum" id="w">laudanum</a>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup>  She died the following year.  In a memoir written fifty years later, Barney said &#34;She could not be saved.  Her life was a long suicide.  Everything turned to dust and ashes in her hands.&#34;<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Cover of the 1900 edition of <i>Quelques Portraits-Sonnets de Femmes</i>.</div> 
In 1900 Barney published her first book, a collection of poems entitled <i>Quelques Portraits-Sonnets de Femmes</i> (<i>Some Portrait-Sonnets of Women</i>).  The poems used traditional French verse forms—Barney disapproved of <a href="/wiki/Free_verse" id="w">free verse</a>—and a formal, old-fashioned style.  They have been described as &#34;apprentice work&#34;.  By publishing them, however, Barney became the first woman poet to openly write about love of women since Sappho.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Her mother contributed pastel illustrations of the subjects of the poems, unaware that three of the four women who modeled for her were her daughter&#39;s lovers.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Reviews were generally positive, glossing over the lesbian theme of the poems—or even misrepresenting it; the <i>Washington Mirror</i> said Barney &#34;writes odes to men&#39;s lips and eyes; not like a novice, either.&#34;<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>  But a headline in a society gossip paper—&#34;Sappho Sings in Washington&#34;—alerted her father, who bought and destroyed the publisher&#39;s remaining stock and printing plates.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption"><i>Waterlily</i>, a portrait of Barney&#39;s cousin Ellen Goin, was one of the illustrations for <i>Quelques Portraits-Sonnets de Femmes</i>.</div>
To escape her father&#39;s notice, Barney published her next book, <i>Cinq Petits Dialogues Grecs</i> (<i>Five Short Greek Dialogues</i>, 1901), under the <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" id="w">pseudonym</a> Tryphé.  The name came from the works of <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Lou%C3%BFs" id="w">Pierre Louÿs</a>, who helped to edit and revise the <a href="/wiki/Manuscript" id="w">manuscript</a>; she also dedicated the book to him.  The first of the dialogues is set in ancient Greece and contains a long description of Sappho, who is &#34;more faithful in her inconstancy than others in their fidelity&#34;; another argues for <a href="/wiki/Paganism" id="w">paganism</a> over <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a>.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Barney&#39;s father&#39;s death in 1902 left her with a substantial fortune, freeing her from any need to conceal the authorship of her books; she never used a pseudonym again.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Je Me Souviens</i> was published in 1910, after Vivien&#39;s death.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup>  The same year, Barney published <i>Actes et Entr&#39;actes</i> (<i>Acts and Interludes</i>), a collection of short plays and poems.  One of the plays, <i>Equivoque</i> (<i>Ambiguity</i>), is a revisionist version of the legend of <a href="/wiki/Sappho" id="w">Sappho</a>&#39;s death: instead of throwing herself off a cliff for the love of the sailor <a href="/wiki/Phaon" id="w">Phaon</a>, she does so out of grief that Phaon is marrying the woman she loves.  The play incorporates quotations from Sappho&#39;s fragments, with Barney&#39;s own footnotes in Greek.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Barney did not take her poetry as seriously as Vivien did; she said &#34;if I had one ambition it was to make my life itself into a poem.&#34;<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup>  Her plays were performed only in amateur productions in her garden; according to <a href="/wiki/Karla_Jay" id="w">Karla Jay</a>, most of them lack coherent plots and &#34;would probably baffle even the most sympathetic audience&#34;.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>  After 1910 she primarily wrote the epigrams and memoirs for which she is better known.  A final book of poetry, <i>Poems &#38; Poemes: Autres Alliances</i>, appeared in 1920; it collected romantic poetry in both French and English.  Barney asked Ezra Pound to edit the poems, but ignored the detailed recommendations he made.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Salon" name="Salon"></a><h2>Salon</h2>
<p>For over 60 years, Barney hosted a literary <a href="/wiki/Salon_(gathering)" id="w">salon</a>—a weekly gathering at which people met to socialize and discuss literature, art, music, and any other topic of interest. Barney worked to feature women&#39;s writing while also hosting some of the most prominent male writers of her time; she brought together <a href="/wiki/Expatriate" id="w">expatriate</a> <a href="/wiki/Modernists" id="w">Modernists</a> with members of the <a href="/wiki/French_Academy" id="w">French Academy</a>. Her salon was, according to Joan Schenkar, &#34;a place where lesbian assignations <i>and</i> appointments with academics could coexist in a kind of cheerful, cross-pollinating, cognitive dissonance&#34;.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>The salon evolved from the gatherings Barney held at her house in <a href="/wiki/Neuilly-sur-Seine" id="w">Neuilly</a> in the early 1900s, where the entertainment included poetry readings, theatricals (in which <a href="/wiki/Colette" id="w">Colette</a> sometimes performed), and once, a dance performance by <a href="/wiki/Mata_Hari" id="w">Mata Hari</a>, who rode into the garden as <a href="/wiki/Lady_Godiva" id="w">Lady Godiva</a> on a white horse harnessed with <a href="/wiki/Turquoise" id="w">turquoise</a> <a href="/wiki/Cloisonn%C3%A9" id="w">cloisonné</a>.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>

It may have been the play <i>Equivoque</i> that led to her leaving Neuilly in 1909.  According to a contemporary newspaper article, her landlord objected to her holding an outdoor performance of a play about Sappho, which he felt &#34;followed nature too closely&#34;.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup>  She cancelled her lease and rented the <i>pavillon</i> at 20, Rue Jacob in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Latin_Quarter_(Paris)" id="w">Latin Quarter</a> where her salon was held until the late 1960s:  a small two-story house, separated on three sides from the main building on the street.  Adjoining the <i>pavillon</i> was a large, overgrown garden with a <a href="/wiki/Doric_order" id="w">Doric</a> &#34;Temple of Friendship&#34; tucked into one corner.  In its new location the salon developed a more decorous outward face, focusing on poetry readings and conversation—in part because Barney had been told the <i>pavillon&#39;s</i> floors would not hold up to large dancing parties.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup>  Frequent guests during this period included <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Lou%C3%BFs" id="w">Pierre Louÿs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Claudel" id="w">Paul Claudel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philippe_Berthelot" id="w">Philippe Berthelot</a>, and the translator <a href="/wiki/J._C._Mardrus" id="w">J.

<p>During <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, the salon became a haven for those opposed to the war.  <a href="/wiki/Henri_Barbusse" id="w">Henri Barbusse</a> once gave a reading from his anti-war novel <i>Under Fire</i>, and Barney hosted a Women&#39;s Congress for Peace at the Rue Jacob.

The two schemed together to subsidize <a href="/wiki/Paul_Val%C3%A9ry" id="w">Paul Valéry</a> and <a href="/wiki/T._S._Eliot" id="w">T. S. Eliot</a> so they could quit their jobs and focus on writing; Valéry, however, found other <a href="/wiki/Patrons" id="w">patrons</a>, and Eliot refused the grant.  Pound introduced Barney to the <a href="/wiki/Avant-garde" id="w">avant-garde</a> composer <a href="/wiki/George_Antheil" id="w">George Antheil</a>, and while her own taste in music leaned toward the traditional, she hosted premieres of Antheil&#39;s <i>Symphony for Five Instruments</i> and <i>First String Quartet</i> at the Rue Jacob.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup>  It was also at Barney&#39;s salon that Pound met his longtime <a href="/wiki/Mistress_(lover)" id="w">mistress</a>, the violinist <a href="/wiki/Olga_Rudge" id="w">Olga Rudge</a>.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1927, Barney started an <i>Académie des Femmes</i> (Women&#39;s Academy) to honor women writers—a response to the influential French Academy, founded in the 17th century by <a href="/wiki/Louis_XIII" id="w">Louis XIII</a>, whose 40 &#34;immortals&#34; included no women at the time. Unlike the French Academy, it was not a formal organization, but a series of readings held as part of the regular Friday salons.  Honorees included <a href="/wiki/Colette" id="w">Colette</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gertrude_Stein" id="w">Gertrude Stein</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anna_Wickham" id="w">Anna Wickham</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rachilde" id="w">Rachilde</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lucie_Delarue-Mardrus" id="w">Lucie Delarue-Mardrus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mina_Loy" id="w">Mina Loy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Djuna_Barnes" id="w">Djuna Barnes</a>, and (posthumously) <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e_Vivien" id="w">Renée Vivien</a>.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup>  </p>

Barney drew a diagram for her 1929 book <i>Aventures de l&#39;Esprit</i> (<i>Adventures of the Mind</i>), crowding over a hundred names of people who had attended the salon into a crude map of the house, garden, and Temple of Friendship.  The first half of the book contained reminiscences of 13 male writers she had known or met over the years; the second half devoted a chapter to each of the members of the <i>Académie des Femmes</i>.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup>  This gender-balanced structure was not reflected in the book&#39;s packaging, which listed seven of the male writers included in the book, then added &#34;... and some women.&#34;</p>
<p>In the late 20s, <a href="/wiki/Radclyffe_Hall" id="w">Radclyffe Hall</a> drew a crowd; her novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Well_of_Loneliness" id="w">The Well of Loneliness</a></i> had recently been banned in the UK.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup>  A reading by the poet <a href="/wiki/Edna_St._Vincent_Millay" id="w">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a> packed the salon in 1932.  At another Friday in the 1930s, <a href="/wiki/Virgil_Thomson" id="w">Virgil Thomson</a> sang from <i><a href="/wiki/Four_Saints_in_Three_Acts" id="w">Four Saints in Three Acts</a></i>, an opera based on a libretto by Gertrude Stein.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>Of the famous Modernist writers who spent time in Paris, <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway" id="w">Ernest Hemingway</a> never made an appearance at the salon.  <a href="/wiki/James_Joyce" id="w">James Joyce</a> came once or twice, but didn&#39;t care for it.  <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Proust" id="w">Marcel Proust</a> never attended a Friday, though he did come to 20, Rue Jacob once to talk to Barney about lesbian culture as research for <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>.  His visit had to be postponed repeatedly due to his poor health, and when it finally did happen, he was too nervous to bring up the subject he had come to discuss.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Epigrams_and_novel" name="Epigrams_and_novel"></a><h2>Epigrams and novel</h2>

<p><i>Èparpillements</i> (<i>Scatterings</i>, 1910) was Barney&#39;s first collection of <i>pensées</i>—literally, thoughts.  This literary form had been associated with salon culture in France since the 17th century, when the genre was perfected at the salon of <a href="/wiki/Madeleine_de_Souvr%C3%A9%2C_marquise_de_Sabl%C3%A9" id="w">Madame de Sablé</a>.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup>  Barney&#39;s <i>pensées</i>, like de Sablé&#39;s own <i>Maximes</i>, were short, often one-line <a href="/wiki/Epigrams" id="w">epigrams</a> or <i><a href="/wiki/Bon_mot" id="w">bon mots</a></i> such as &#34;There are more evil ears than bad mouths&#34; and &#34;To be married is to be neither alone nor together.&#34;<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup>  </p>

Her literary career got a boost after she sent a copy of <i>Èparpillements</i> to <a href="/wiki/Remy_de_Gourmont" id="w">Remy de Gourmont</a>, a French poet, literary critic, and philosopher who had become a recluse after contracting the disfiguring disease <a href="/wiki/Lupus_vulgaris" id="w">lupus vulgaris</a> in his thirties.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup>  He was impressed enough to invite her to one of the Sunday gatherings at his home, at which he usually received only a small group of old friends.  She was a rejuvenating influence in his life, coaxing him out for evening car rides, dinners at the Rue Jacob, a masked ball, even a short cruise on the <a href="/wiki/Seine" id="w">Seine</a>.  He turned some of their wide-ranging conversations into a series of letters that he published in the <i><a href="/wiki/Mercure_de_France" id="w">Mercure de France</a></i>, addressing her as <i>l&#39;Amazone,</i> a French word that can mean either <i>horsewoman</i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Amazons" id="w">Amazon</a></i>; the letters were later collected in book form.  He died in 1915, but the nickname he gave her would stay with her all her life—even her tombstone identifies her as &#34;the Amazon of Remy de Gourmont&#34;—and his <i>Letters to the Amazon</i> left readers wanting to know more about the woman who had inspired them.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>Barney obliged in 1920 with <i>Pensées d&#39;une Amazone</i> (<i>Thoughts of an Amazon</i>), her most overtly political work.  In the first section, &#34;Sexual Adversity, War, and Feminism&#34;, she developed <a href="/wiki/Feminism" id="w">feminist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pacifism" id="w">pacifist</a> themes, describing war as an &#34;involuntary and collective suicide ordained by man&#34;.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup>  In war, she said, men &#34;father death as women mother life, with courage and without choice&#34;.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup>  The epigrammatic form makes it difficult to determine the details of Barney&#39;s views; ideas are presented only to be dropped, and some <i>pensées</i> seem to contradict others.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup>  Some critics interpret her as saying that the aggression that leads to war is visible in all male relationships.  Karla Jay, however, argues that her philosophy was not that sweeping, and is better summed up by the epigram &#34;Those who <i>love</i> war lack the love of an adequate sport—the art of living.&#34;<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another section of <i>Pensées d&#39;une Amazone</i>, &#34;Misunderstanding, or Sappho&#39;s Lawsuit&#34;, gathered historical writings about homosexuality along with her own commentary.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup>  She also covered topics such as alcohol, friendship, old age, and literature, writing &#34;Novels are longer than life&#34;<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> and &#34;Romanticism is a childhood ailment; those who had it young are the most robust.&#34;<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup>  A third volume, <i>Nouvelles Pensées de l&#39;Amazone</i> (<i>New Thoughts of the Amazon</i>), appeared in 1939.</p>
<p><i>The One Who is Legion, or A.D.&#39;s After-Life</i> (1930) was Barney&#39;s only book written entirely in English, as well as her only novel.  Illustrated by <a href="/wiki/Romaine_Brooks" id="w">Romaine Brooks</a>, it concerns a <a href="/wiki/Suicide" id="w">suicide</a>, known only as A.D., who is brought back to life as a <a href="/wiki/Hermaphrodite" id="w">hermaphroditic</a> being and reads the book of her own life.  This <a href="/wiki/Fictional_book" id="w">book-within-a-book</a>, entitled <i>The Love-Lives of A.D.</i>, is a collection of hymns, poems and epigrams, much like Barney&#39;s own other writings.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Major_relationships" name="Major_relationships"></a><h2> Major relationships </h2>
<p>Barney practiced, and advocated, what would today be called <a href="/wiki/Polyamory" id="w">polyamory</a>.  As early as 1901, in <i>Cinq Petits Dialogues Grecs,</i> she  argued in favor of multiple relationships and against jealousy;<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> in <i>Èparpillements</i> she wrote &#34;One is unfaithful to those one loves in order that their charm does not become mere habit.&#34;<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup>  While she could be jealous herself, she actively encouraged at least some of her lovers to be <a href="/wiki/Nonmonogamy" id="w">nonmonogamous</a> as well.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Due in part to Jean Chalon&#39;s early biography of her, published in English as <i>Portrait of a Seductress</i>, she has become more widely known for her many relationships than for her writing or her salon.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup>  She once wrote out a list, divided into three categories:  liaisons, demi-liaisons, and adventures.  <a href="/wiki/Colette" id="w">Colette</a> was a demi-liaison, while the artist and furniture designer <a href="/wiki/Eyre_de_Lanux" id="w">Eyre de Lanux</a>, with whom she had an off-and-on affair for several years, was listed as an adventure.  Among the liaisons—the relationships that she considered most important—were <a href="/wiki/Olive_Custance" id="w">Olive Custance</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e_Vivien" id="w">Renée Vivien</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elisabeth_de_Gramont" id="w">Elisabeth de Gramont</a>, <a href="/wiki/Romaine_Brooks" id="w">Romaine Brooks</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dolly_Wilde" id="w">Dolly Wilde</a>.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup>  Of these, the three longest relationships were with de Gramont, Brooks, and Wilde; from 1927, she was involved with all three of them simultaneously, a situation that ended only with Wilde&#39;s death.  Her shorter affairs, such as those with Colette and <a href="/wiki/Lucie_Delarue-Mardrus" id="w">Lucie Delarue-Mardrus</a>, often evolved into lifelong friendships.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Elisabeth de Gramont in 1889.</div>
Elisabeth de Gramont, the <a href="/wiki/Duchess" id="w">Duchess</a> of Clermont-Tonnerre, was a writer best known for her popular memoirs.  A descendant of <a href="/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France" id="w">Henry IV of France</a>, she had grown up among the aristocracy; when she was a child, according to Janet Flanner, &#34;peasants on her farm... begged her not to clean her shoes before entering their houses&#34;.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup>  She looked back on this lost world of wealth and privilege with little regret, and became known as the &#34;red duchess&#34; for her support of <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialism</a>.  She was married and had two daughters in 1910, when she met Natalie Barney; her husband is said to have been violent and tyrannical.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup>  They eventually separated, and in 1918 she and Barney wrote up a marriage contract stating that &#34;[n]o one union shall be so strong as this union, nor another joining so tender—nor relationship so lasting.&#34;<sup id="_ref-rapazzini_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rapazzini" title="">[74]</a></sup> </p>
<p>De Gramont accepted Barney&#39;s nonmonogamy—perhaps reluctantly at first—and went out of her way to be gracious to her other lovers,<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> always including Romaine Brooks when she invited Barney to vacation in the country.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup>  The relationship continued until de Gramont&#39;s death in 1954.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Natalie Barney and Romaine Brooks, circa 1915.</div>
Barney&#39;s longest relationship was with the American <a href="/wiki/Painter" id="w">painter</a> Romaine Brooks, whom she met around <a href="/wiki/1914" id="w">1914</a>.  Brooks specialized in <a href="/wiki/Portraiture" id="w">portraiture</a> and was noted for her somber palette of gray, black, and white.  During the 1920s she painted portraits of several members of Barney&#39;s social circle, including de Gramont and Barney herself.  </p>
<p>Brooks tolerated Barney&#39;s casual affairs well enough to tease her about them, and had a few of her own over the years, but could become jealous when a new love became serious.  Usually she simply left town, but at one point she gave Barney an ultimatum to choose between her and Dolly Wilde—relenting once Barney had given in.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup>  At the same time, while Brooks was devoted to Barney, she did not want to live with her as a full-time couple; she disliked Paris, disdained Barney&#39;s friends, hated the constant socializing on which Barney thrived, and felt that she was fully herself only when alone.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup>  To accommodate Brooks&#39;s need for solitude they built a summer home consisting of two separate wings joined by a dining room, which they called <i>Villa Trait d&#39;Union</i>, the hyphenated villa.  Brooks also spent much of the year in Italy or travelling elsewhere in Europe, away from Barney.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> They remained devoted to one another for over fifty years.</p>
<a id="Dolly_Wilde" name="Dolly_Wilde"></a><h3>Dolly Wilde</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Dolly_Wilde" id="w">Dolly Wilde</a> was the niece of <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Wilde" id="w">Oscar Wilde</a> and the last of her family to bear the Wilde name.  She was renowned for her epigrammatic wit but, unlike her famous uncle, never managed to apply her gifts to any publishable writing; her letters are her only legacy.  She did some work as a translator and was often supported by others, including Natalie Barney, whom she met in 1927.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>
<p>Like Vivien, Wilde seemed bent on self-destruction.  She drank heavily, was addicted to heroin, and attempted suicide several times.  Barney financed <a href="/wiki/Detoxification" id="w">detoxifications</a>, which were never effective; she emerged from one nursing-home stay with a new dependency on the sleeping draught <a href="/wiki/Paraldehyde" id="w">paraldehyde</a>, then available over-the-counter.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1939 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and refused surgery, seeking alternative treatments.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup>  The following year, <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> separated her from Barney; she fled <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> for <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> while Barney went to <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a> with Brooks.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup>  She died in 1941 from causes that have never been fully explained, possibly a paraldehyde overdose.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
<a id="World_War_II_and_after" name="World_War_II_and_after"></a><h2> World War II and after </h2>

<p>Barney&#39;s attitudes during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> have been controversial.  In 1937, Una, Lady Troubridge had complained that Barney &#34;talked a lot of half-baked nonsense about the tyranny of <a href="/wiki/Fascism" id="w">fascism</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup>  Barney herself was one-eighth <a href="/wiki/Jewish" id="w">Jewish</a>, and since she spent the war in <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a> with Romaine Brooks, risked deportation to a <a href="/wiki/Concentration_camp" id="w">concentration camp</a>—a fate she avoided only by wiring her sister Laura for a notarized document attesting to her <a href="/wiki/Confirmation" id="w">confirmation</a>.  Nevertheless, having no other source of information about the war, she believed <a href="/wiki/Axis_Powers" id="w">Axis</a> <a href="/wiki/Propaganda" id="w">propaganda</a> that portrayed the <a href="/wiki/Allies" id="w">Allies</a> as the aggressors, so that pro-<a href="/wiki/Fascism" id="w">Fascism</a> seemed to her to be a logical consequence of her <a href="/wiki/Pacifism" id="w">pacifism</a>.  An unpublished memoir she wrote during the war years is  pro-Fascist and <a href="/wiki/Anti-Semitic" id="w">anti-Semitic</a>, quoting speeches by <a href="/wiki/Hitler" id="w">Hitler</a> apparently with approval.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used as evidence that she was not Jewish;<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup> alternatively, she may have been influenced by <a href="/wiki/Ezra_Pound" id="w">Ezra Pound</a>&#39;s anti-Semitic radio broadcasts.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup>  Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing passage on a ship to the United States.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup>  By the end of the war her sympathies had again changed, and she saw the Allies as liberators.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Villa Trait d&#39;Union</i> was destroyed by bombing.  After the war, Brooks declined to live with Barney in Paris; she remained in Italy, and they visited each other frequently.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup>  Their relationship remained <a href="/wiki/Monogamous" id="w">monogamous</a> until the mid-1950s, when Barney met her last new love, Janine Lahovary, the wife of a retired <a href="/wiki/Romania" id="w">Romanian</a> ambassador.

The salon resumed in 1949 and continued to attract young writers for whom it was as much a piece of history as a place where literary reputations were made.  <a href="/wiki/Truman_Capote" id="w">Truman Capote</a> was an intermittent guest for almost ten years; he described the decor as &#34;totally turn-of-the-century&#34; and remembered that Barney introduced him to the models for several characters in <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Proust" id="w">Marcel Proust</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time" id="w">In Search of Lost Time</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Alice_B._Toklas" id="w">Alice B. Toklas</a> became a regular after Gertrude Stein&#39;s death in 1946.  Fridays in the 1960s honored <a href="/wiki/Mary_McCarthy_(author)" id="w">Mary McCarthy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marguerite_Yourcenar" id="w">Marguerite Yourcenar</a>, who in 1980—eight years after Barney&#39;s death—became the first female member of the French Academy.<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup></p>
<p>Barney did not return to writing epigrams, but did publish two volumes of memoirs about other writers she had known, <i>Souvenirs Indiscrets</i> (<i>Indiscreet Memories</i>, 1960) and <i>Traits et Portraits</i> (<i>Traits and Portraits</i>, 1963).  She also worked to find a publisher for Brooks&#39;s memoirs and to place her paintings in galleries.<sup id="_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[96]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the late 1960s Brooks became increasingly reclusive and paranoid; she sank into a depression and refused to see the doctors Barney sent.  Bitter at Lahovary&#39;s presence during their last years, which she had hoped they would spend alone together, she finally broke off contact with Barney.  Barney continued to write to her, but received no replies.  Brooks died in December 1970, and Barney on <a href="/wiki/February_2" id="w">February 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1972" id="w">1972</a>.<sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[97]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>By the end of Barney&#39;s life her work had been largely forgotten.  Only in the 1980s did she begin to be recognized for what Karla Jay calls an &#34;almost uncanny anticipation&#34; of the concerns of later feminist writers.<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup>  English translations of some of her memoirs, essays, and epigrams appeared in 1992, but most of her plays and poetry are still untranslated.</p>
<p>Her indirect influence on literature, through her salon and her many literary friendships, can be seen in the number of writers who have addressed or portrayed her in their works.  <i>Claudine S&#39;en Va</i> (<i><a href="/wiki/Claudine_and_Annie" id="w">Claudine and Annie</a></i>, 1903) by <a href="/wiki/Colette" id="w">Colette</a> contains a brief appearance by Barney as &#34;Miss Flossie,&#34;<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup> echoing the nickname she had earlier been given in de Pougy&#39;s novel <i>Idylle Saphique</i>.  <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e_Vivien" id="w">Renée Vivien</a> wrote many poems about her, as well as a Symbolist novel, <i>Une Femme M&#39;Apparut</i> (<i>A Woman Appeared to Me</i>, 1904), in which she is described as having &#34;eyes ... as sharp and blue as a blade.... The charm of peril emanated from her and drew me inexorably.&#34;<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Remy_de_Gourmont" id="w">Remy de Gourmont</a> addressed her in his <i>Letters to the Amazon</i>, and <a href="/wiki/Truman_Capote" id="w">Truman Capote</a> mentioned her in his last, unfinished novel <i><a href="/wiki/Answered_Prayers:_The_Unfinished_Novel" id="w">Answered Prayers</a></i>.  She also appeared in two later novels by writers who never met her: Francesco Rapazzini&#39;s <i>Un Soir chez l&#39;Amazone</i> (<i>An Evening with the Amazon</i>, 2004) is a historical novel about Barney&#39;s salon, while Anna Livia&#39;s <i>Minimax</i> (1991) portrays both her and Renee Vivien as still-living vampires.</p>
<p>According to Lillian Faderman, &#34;There was probably no lesbian in the four decades between 1928 and the late 1960s capable of reading English or any of the eleven languages into which the book was translated who was unfamiliar with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Well_of_Loneliness" id="w">The Well of Loneliness</a></i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup>  Although the novel&#39;s author, Radclyffe Hall, intended it as an argument for greater tolerance for what she called &#34;<a href="/wiki/Sexual_inversion" id="w">sexual inverts</a>&#34;, it has often been criticized by lesbian readers for its protagonist&#39;s self-hatred and its use of terms like &#34;freak&#34; and &#34;mistake of nature&#34;.<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup>  Barney, as the salon hostess Valérie Seymour, appears in the novel as the symbol of a different attitude.<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[103]</a></sup>  &#34;Valérie, placid and self-assured, created an atmosphere of courage; everyone felt very normal and brave when they gathered together at Valérie Seymour&#39;s.&#34;<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Lucie_Delarue-Mardrus" id="w">Lucie Delarue-Mardrus</a> wrote love poems to Barney in the early years of the century, and in 1930 depicted her in a novel, <i>L&#39;Ange et les Pervers</i> (<i>The Angel and the Perverts</i>), in which she said she &#34;analyzed and described Natalie at length as well as the life into which she initiated me&#34;.  The <a href="/wiki/Protagonist" id="w">protagonist</a> of the novel is a <a href="/wiki/Hermaphrodite" id="w">hermaphrodite</a> named Marion who lives a double life, frequenting literary salons in female dress, then changing from skirt to trousers to attend gay soirées. Barney is Laurette Wells, a salon hostess who spends much of the novel trying to win back an ex-lover loosely based on Renée Vivien.<sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup> The book&#39;s portrayal of her is at times harshly critical, but she is the only person whose company Marion enjoys.  He/she tells Wells that she is &#34;perverse... dissolute, self-centered, unfair, stubborn, sometimes miserly... [but] a genuine rebel, ever ready to incite others to rebellion.... [Y]ou are capable of loving someone just as they are, even a thief—in that lies your only fidelity.  And so you have my respect.&#34;<sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[106]</a></sup></p>
<p>After meeting Barney in the 1930s, the Russian poet <a href="/wiki/Marina_Ivanovna_Tsvetaeva" id="w">Marina Ivanovna Tsvetaeva</a> addressed her in a <i>Letter to the Amazon</i> (1934) in which she expressed her conflicted feelings about love between women.  The result, according to <a href="/wiki/Terry_Castle" id="w">Terry Castle</a>, is &#34;an entirely cryptic, paranoid, overwhelming piece of reverie&#34;.<sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[107]</a></sup></p>
<p>Barney and the women in her social circle are the subject of <a href="/wiki/Djuna_Barnes" id="w">Djuna Barnes</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Ladies_Almanack" id="w">Ladies Almanack</a></i> (1928), a <i><a href="/wiki/Roman_%C3%A0_clef" id="w">roman à clef</a></i> written in an archaic, <a href="/wiki/Rabelaisian" id="w">Rabelaisian</a> style, with Barnes&#39;s own illustrations in the style of <a href="/wiki/Elizabethan" id="w">Elizabethan</a> <a href="/wiki/Woodcuts" id="w">woodcuts</a>.  She has the lead role as Dame Evangeline Musset, &#34;who was in her Heart one Grand Red Cross for the Pursuance, the Relief and the Distraction, of such Girls as in their Hinder Parts, and their Fore Parts, and in whatsoever Parts did suffer them most, lament Cruelly&#34;.<sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[108]</a></sup>  &#34;[A] Pioneer and a Menace&#34; in her youth, Dame Musset has reached &#34;a witty and learned Fifty&#34;;<sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[109]</a></sup> she rescues women in distress, dispenses wisdom, and upon her death is elevated to sainthood.  Also appearing pseudonymously are Elisabeth de Gramont, <a href="/wiki/Romaine_Brooks" id="w">Romaine Brooks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dolly_Wilde" id="w">Dolly Wilde</a>, <a href="/wiki/Radclyffe_Hall" id="w">Radclyffe Hall</a> and her partner Una, Lady Troubridge, <a href="/wiki/Janet_Flanner" id="w">Janet Flanner</a> and Solita Solano, and <a href="/wiki/Mina_Loy" id="w">Mina Loy</a>.<sup id="_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#_note-110" title="">[110]</a></sup>  The obscure language, inside jokes, and ambiguity of <i>Ladies Almanack</i> have kept critics arguing about whether it is an affectionate satire or a bitter attack, but Barney herself loved the book and reread it throughout her life.<sup id="_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#_note-111" title="">[111]</a></sup></p>
