<p>The <b>Sikh diaspora</b> is a relatively recent term used to describe the phenomenon of <a href="/wiki/Sikh" id="w">Sikh</a> migration from the traditional Sikh heartland of the <a href="/wiki/Punjab_region" id="w">Punjab</a>.  The starting point of the diaspora is commonly accepted to have begun after the fall of the <a href="/wiki/Sikh_Empire" id="w">Sikh Empire</a> in 1849 and the Empire&#39;s subsequent annexation into the <a href="/wiki/British_Raj" id="w">British Raj</a>.  The most famous personification of the Sikh diaspora was the first, <a href="/wiki/Duleep_Singh" id="w">Maharajah Duleep Singh</a>, the last &#39;King&#39; of the Sikhs who was coerced into a lifetime exile by the <a href="/wiki/British_Raj" id="w">British Raj</a>.  Since <a href="/wiki/Duleep_Singh" id="w">Duleep Singh</a>&#39;s exile, the rate of Sikh migration from the Punjab has remained high; however the destination for Sikh migrants has changed during the ensuing 150 years.  The development of the Sikh diaspora concept has given diaspora Sikhs a conscious political and cultural identity, which forms a reference point for their &#39;Sikhism&#39;.  This phenomena has seen a corresponding development in scientific research literature that explores Sikh diaspora issues.    </p>
<a id="The_Sikhs" name="The_Sikhs"></a><h2>The Sikhs</h2>

<p>Numbering approximately 23 million worldwide, the Sikhs are adherents to the fifth largest organized religion in the world, Sikhism.  The Sikhs make up 0.39%<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> of the world population of which approximately 83% live in India. Of the Indian Sikh community 14.6 million, i.e. 76% of all Indian Sikhs, live in the northern Indian State of <a href="/wiki/Punjab_(India)" id="w">Punjab (India)</a>, where they form a majority 59.9% of the population. Substantial communities of Sikhs, i.e. greater than 200,000, live in the Indian States/Union territories of <a href="/wiki/Haryana" id="w">Haryana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rajasthan" id="w">Rajasthan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh" id="w">Uttar Pradesh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Delhi" id="w">Delhi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh" id="w">Himachal Pradesh</a>,<a href="/wiki/Maharashtra" id="w">Maharashtra</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uttarakhand" id="w">Uttarakhand</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir" id="w">Jammu and Kashmir</a><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="Historical_migration_patterns" name="Historical_migration_patterns"></a><h2>Historical migration patterns</h2>

<p>The Sikhs as a political entity, distinct from other Indian traditions, can be said to of have begun with the martyrdom of the fifth Sikh Guru, <a href="/wiki/Arjan_Dev" id="w">Guru Arjan Dev Ji</a> in 1606, Sikh distinction was further enhanced by the establishment of the Sikh &#39;Pure&#39; brotherhood or <a href="/wiki/Khalsa" id="w">Khalsa</a> (ਖਲਸਾ), by <a href="/wiki/Gobind_Singh" id="w">Guru Gobind Singh Ji</a> in 1699<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>.  This gives the Sikhs, as an organized political grouping, a relatively recent history of around 400 years.  Migrations of Sikhs during the era of the Gurus were limited to the boundaries of modern day <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a>, and in particular restricted to the Sikh tribal heartland of the <a href="/wiki/Punjab_Region" id="w">Punjab Region</a>.  The development of the <a href="/wiki/Sikh_Confederacy" id="w">Sikh Confederacy</a> and the development of the <a href="/wiki/Sikh_Empire" id="w">Sikh Empire</a> (1716-1849), led to Sikhs migrating to conquered parts of their empire such as <a href="/wiki/Ladakh" id="w">Ladakh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peshawar" id="w">Peshawar</a>.  However these migrations were limited, transitory and unsustained, depending on the <a href="/wiki/Sikh_Empire" id="w">Empire&#39;s</a> fluctuating boundaries.  During the time of the <a href="/wiki/Sikh_Empire" id="w">Sikh Empire</a>, there was a net cultural immigration, with <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic" id="w">Napoleonic</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> influences vying for the &#39;ear&#39; of the then Sikh Maharajah <a href="/wiki/Ranjit_Singh" id="w">Ranjit Singh</a><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>.  With respect to the Sikh diaspora, the most important political aspect of this period was the historical establishment of a Sikh homeland; the idea of a powerful Sikh state was a reality.</p>

<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Dalip_singh_winterhalter.jpg" title="Maharajah [[Duleep Singh]], the first and most famous member of the Sikh diaspora"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalip_singh_winterhalter.jpg" alt="Maharajah [[Duleep Singh]], the first and most famous member of the Sikh diaspora" title="Maharajah [[Duleep Singh]], the first and most famous member of the Sikh diaspora" class="location-right type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Maharajah <a href="/wiki/Duleep_Singh" id="w">Duleep Singh</a>, the first and most famous member of the Sikh diaspora</div>
Sikh migration from the Punjab began in earnest in the second half of the 19th century when the <a href="/wiki/British_Raj" id="w">British Raj</a> had successfully completed its annexation of the <a href="/wiki/Punjab_region" id="w">Punjab</a>.  The pivotal action in the British annexation was the lifetime exile of the then eleven year old Marahrajah, <a href="/wiki/Duleep_Singh" id="w">Duleep Singh</a>, thus making Singh the first (although unwilling) member of the Sikh diaspora. </p>
<p>Although a largely secular figure who did little for the Sikh body politic, Axel (2001)<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>argues that Duleep Singh&#39;s exile has had a major impact on the Sikh diaspora psyche.  Axel(2001)<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> says that <a href="/wiki/Duleep_Singh" id="w">Duleep Singh</a> is the archetypal &#39;tragic hero&#39; figure in Sikh culture, &#34;a King without a Kingdom, a Sikh separated from his people&#34;; the contrast between <a href="/wiki/Duleep_Singh" id="w">Duleep Singh</a> and his strong ruler father, <a href="/wiki/Ranjit_Singh" id="w">Ranjit Singh</a>, makes <a href="/wiki/Duleep" id="w">Duleep</a>&#39;s exile even more &#39;galling&#39; for the Sikhs and results in a strong sense of communal injustice, which is a later trait in the diaspora&#39;s development.</p>
<p>Having annexed the <a href="/wiki/Sikh_Kingdom" id="w">Sikh Kingdom</a>, the <a href="/wiki/British_Raj" id="w">British Raj</a> preferentially recruited Sikhs in the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Civil_Service" id="w">Indian Civil Service</a> and, in particular, the <a href="/wiki/British_Indian_Army" id="w">British Indian Army</a>, which led to migration of Sikhs to different parts of <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">British India</a> and the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British Empire</a><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>.    Semiskilled artisans were also transported from the Punjab to British <a href="/wiki/East_Africa" id="w">East Africa</a> to help in the building of railways. After World War II, Sikhs emigrated from both India and Pakistan, most going to the <a href="/wiki/Sikhism_in_United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a> but many also headed for <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a>. Some of the Sikhs who had settled in eastern Africa were expelled by Ugandan dictator <a href="/wiki/Idi_Amin" id="w">Idi Amin</a> in 1972<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>.  Sikhs are primarily an agrarian community and with the pressures of having only a limited amount of land, high birth rates and the desire to make a better living, the male offspring of Sikh farmers were encouraged to migrate to foreign countries.  Subsequently the main &#39;push&#39; factor for Sikh migration has been economic with significant Sikh communities now being found in <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" id="w">Malaysia</a>, <a href="/wiki/East_Africa" id="w">East Africa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australasia" id="w">Australasia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thailand" id="w">Thailand</a>.</p>
<a id="Agitation_for_a_homeland" name="Agitation_for_a_homeland"></a><h2>Agitation for a homeland</h2>

<p>Axel (2001)<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> argues that the Sikh diaspora community, having established themselves in foreign countries begin to fetishize the past and nurture idealized designs for their &#39;lost&#39; Sikh empire.  This come into fruition to a certain degree with the establishment of <a href="/wiki/Punjab_(India)" id="w">Indian Punjab</a> in 1966 as a Sikh majority state.  However Tatla(1998)<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> argues that the marginalization and sense of grievance that Indian Sikhs were facing due to <a href="/wiki/Indira_Ghandi" id="w">Indira Ghandi</a>&#39;s heavy handed tactics, were amplified in the Sikh diaspora.  Subsequently, the Sikh diaspora, especially in Canada<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> and the UK become willing suppliers of logistical and financial support when the organic agitation for a separate Sikh nation, <a href="/wiki/Khalistan" id="w">Khalistan</a>, began in the late 1970s.  The actions taken by the Indian government to counter the Sikh separatist movement, via 1984&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Operation_Bluestar" id="w">Operation Bluestar</a>, had a seismic effect on the Sikh diaspora.  Axel (2001) <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> argues that the desecration of the Sikh&#39;s holiest shrine, <a href="/wiki/Golden_Temple" id="w">Harimander Sahib</a>, and the following <a href="/wiki/Anti-Sikh_riots" id="w">anti-Sikh riots</a> in which thousands of Sikhs were massacred; led to a resurgence in Sikh religiosity and a strengthening of ties with their Sikh brethren in <a href="/wiki/Punjab" id="w">Punjab</a>.  Diaspora Sikhs felt betrayed by India, and the events of 1984 defined their Sikhism and underlined a distinct commonality shared with other diaspora Sikhs.  Mark Tully<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> describes 1984s <a href="/wiki/Operation_Bluestar" id="w">Operation Bluestar</a> as the Sikh&#39;s &#39;<a href="/wiki/9/11" id="w">9/11</a>&#39;, this was certainly the case for diaspora Sikhs, who in the main could only watch on in horror as the events of 1984 played out on TV.</p>
<p>In 1971 Dr Jagit Singh Chohan, an ex-minister in a short-lived government of <a href="/wiki/Akali" id="w">Akali</a> dissidents, saw an alignment of like-minded Sikhs.  Chohan placed a half-page advertisement in The New York Times of 12 October 1971, making several claims about Punjab as a Sikh homeland.  However Chohan won little sympathy from ordinary Sikhs<sup id="_ref-Sikh Religion_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sikh Religion" title="">[15]</a></sup>
.</p>

<p>Tatla summarises the change in Sikh diaspora community leaders post 1984 a being a &#34;painful transition from a self-confident community with haughty discourse, to the self-defensive strategies of a vulnerable minority&#34;<sup id="_ref-Sikh Religion_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sikh Religion" title="">[15]</a></sup>.  Organisations such as the International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), the Babbar Khalsa and the Council of Khalistan emerged within the diaspora, and these agencies rallied against &#34;Hindu imperialism&#34; and lobbied to join the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization <a href="/wiki/UNPO" id="w">UNPO</a> aligning the Sikh cause with other ethnic groups seeking freedom, citing cases of Jews, Palestinians, Kurds, Armenians, Kashmiris, Nagas and Tamils.</p>

<p>Whilst the rate of Sikh migration from the <a href="/wiki/Punjab_(India)" id="w">Punjab</a> has remained high, traditional patterns of Sikh migration, that favored English speaking countries, particularly the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> has changed in the past decade due to factors such as stricter immigration procedures.  Moliner(2006)<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> states that as a consequence of the &#39;fact&#39; that Sikh migration to the UK had &#34;become virtually impossible since the late 1970s&#34;, Sikh migration patterns altered to continental Europe.  <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a> has now emerged as a fast-growing area for Sikh migration<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>, with <a href="/wiki/Reggio_Emilia" id="w">Reggio Emilia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Vicenza" id="w">Vicenza</a> province being areas of significant Sikh population clusters <sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup>.  The Italian Sikhs are generally involved in the areas of <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" id="w">agriculture</a>, agro-processing, machine tools and <a href="/wiki/Horticulture" id="w">horticulture</a><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Axel (2001)<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> argues that the history of the Sikh diaspora, its psyche of grievance and the violence inflicted on it, means that the notion of the Sikh diaspora as a community today inevitably converges on the notion of Khalistan.  In addition to this, Axel points out the &#39;nightmare&#39; scenario facing the Sikh diaspora; the Indian state &#39;demands&#39; the &#39;Unity-in-Diversity&#39; model of &#39;rashtriya ekta&#39; (national integration) which Axel contends is signified by &#34;the denial of difference through surrender, assimilation and integration&#34;.  Since the formation of the Khalsa, the Sikhs have defined themselves though their &#39;separateness&#39; and have differentiated themselves philosophically and physically from other Indian religious communities, thus the process of &#39;rashtriya ekta&#39; is a threat to Sikhi itself.  Any &#39;weakening&#39; or &#39;dilution&#39; Sikhi in the Punjab, is doubly painful for the Sikh diaspora for it means a corresponding weakness in Khalistan, which, both real and imaginary, epitomizes the Sikh diasporic place today.</p>
