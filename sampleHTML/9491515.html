<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h1>Early life</h1>
<p>Blackstone was born in <a href="/wiki/Branford%2C_Connecticut" id="w">Branford</a>, <a href="/wiki/Connecticut" id="w">Connecticut</a>, the sixth child, and fourth son, of James Blackstone and Sarah Beach. His father, James, served in the <a href="/wiki/Connecticut_Senate" id="w">Connecticut Senate</a> representing the sixth district. The family is descended from <a href="/wiki/William_Blaxton" id="w">William Blaxton</a>, who arrived in <a href="/wiki/New_England" id="w">New England</a> in the seventeenth century.<sup id="_ref-hinman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hinman" title="">[3]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/William_Blackstone" id="w">William Blackstone</a> is a distant cousin.<sup id="_ref-hinman_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hinman" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Health issues caused Blackstone to drop out of school in 1847, and he began working for <a href="/wiki/Roswell_B._Mason" id="w">Roswell B. Mason</a>, surveying the <a href="/wiki/New_York_and_New_Haven_Railroad" id="w">New York and New Haven Railroad</a>.  He only worked on the NY&#38;NH for a year before becoming an assistant <a href="/wiki/Railroad_engineer" id="w">engineer</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Stockbridge_and_Pittsfield_Railroad" id="w">Stockbridge and Pittsfield Railroad</a>.  Again, he only remained with the firm a short time before leaving for the <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Valley_Railroad" id="w">Vermont Valley Railroad</a>.  In 1851, Roswell invited Blackstone to supervise construction of the <a href="/wiki/Illinois_Central_Railroad" id="w">Illinois Central Railroad</a> between <a href="/wiki/Bloomington%2C_Illinois" id="w">Bloomington</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dixon%2C_Illinois" id="w">Dixon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a>.<sup id="_ref-SC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SC" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Blackstone accepted the job and moved to <a href="/wiki/La_Salle%2C_Illinois" id="w">La Salle, Illinois</a>.<sup id="_ref-hinman_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hinman" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Career_and_life" name="Career_and_life"></a><h1>Career and life </h1>
<p>Blackstone was elected <a href="/wiki/Mayor" id="w">mayor</a> of LaSalle in 1854 and served a single term, his only foray into elected office.  After leaving office, he returned to working on railroads, first as chief engineer of the <a href="/wiki/Joliet_and_Chicago_Railroad" id="w">Joliet and Chicago Railroad</a>, which would eventually become the Chicago and Alton Railroad.<sup id="_ref-hinman_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hinman" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Blackstone became president of the Joliet and Chicago Railroad in 1861,<sup id="_ref-hinman_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hinman" title="">[3]</a></sup> and he kept the line solvent while other divisions were filing for bankruptcy.  When the system was reorganized, he was named president of the board of directors for the company.  <a href="/wiki/John_Drake_(1826-1895)" id="w">John Drake</a> also served on the <a href="/wiki/Board_of_Directors" id="w">Board of Directors</a>.<sup id="_ref-TBC155_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TBC155" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Although Blackstone served with the Alton Railroad for more than a quarter century, he refused a salary. When the Board of Directors voted to pay him $10,000 per year, he turned it down.<sup id="_ref-obit_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-obit" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1899, a group of investors headed by <a href="/wiki/E._H._Harriman" id="w">E. H. Harriman</a> wanted to purchase the Alton Railroad but Blackstone disapproved of the sale.  After many months of wrangling, Blackstone transferred all of his stock in the company to the United States Trust Company and resigned as president, effective <a href="/wiki/April_1" id="w">April 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1899" id="w">1899</a>.  This action allowed the Harriman-led group to assume control of the line.<sup id="_ref-stock_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stock" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to his employment and activities with the railroads, Blackstone was the first president of the company that controlled the <a href="/wiki/Union_Stock_Yards" id="w">Union Stock Yards</a>.<sup id="_ref-naming_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-naming" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1868, Blackstone married Isabella Farnsworth Norton, the daughter of a successful businessman from <a href="/wiki/Norwich%2C_Connecticut" id="w">Norwich, Connecticut</a>.</p>
<p>Blackstone died of <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" id="w">pneumonia</a> on <a href="/wiki/May_26" id="w">May 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1900" id="w">1900</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a>, Illinois.

<a id="Blackstone_Mansion" name="Blackstone_Mansion"></a><h1>Blackstone Mansion</h1>
<p>Blackstone built a <a href="/wiki/Mansion" id="w">mansion</a> for himself at 252 <a href="/wiki/Michigan_Avenue_(Chicago)" id="w">Michigan Avenue</a> in Chicago in what is now the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Landmark" id="w">Chicago Landmark</a> <a href="/wiki/Historic_Michigan_Boulevard_District" id="w">Historic Michigan Boulevard District</a>.<sup id="_ref-obit_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-obit" title="">[6]</a></sup> The property later became the site of the <a href="/wiki/Blackstone_Hotel" id="w">Blackstone Hotel</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Blackstone_Theatre" id="w">Blackstone Theatre</a>.<sup id="_ref-TBC155_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TBC155" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Following the <a href="/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire" id="w">Great Chicago Fire</a> in 1871, he invited his friend <a href="/wiki/John_Crerar" id="w">John Crerar</a> to stay with him, which Crerar proceeded to do for twelve years.  Crerar donated the <a href="/wiki/John_Crerar_Library" id="w">John Crerar Library</a> and Blackstone continued to donate funds toward the maintenance of the building throughout his life. The Crerar Library has now merged with the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" id="w">University of Chicago</a>{{fact}}</p>
<a id="Bequests" name="Bequests"></a><h1>Bequests</h1>
<p>Blackstone donated a library of 5,000 books and a building to Branford, Connecticut with the only stipulation that it be named in honor of his father. A <a href="/wiki/Charter" id="w">charter</a> was devised for the library by the <a href="/wiki/Connecticut_General_Assembly" id="w">Connecticut State Legislature</a> vesting control of the library in a self-perpetuating board of trustees consisting of six residents of Branford and the librarian of <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" id="w">Yale University</a>.<sup id="_ref-branford_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-branford" title="">[9]</a></sup> The building was designed by Chicago architect <a href="/wiki/Solon_Spencer_Beman" id="w">Solon Spencer Beman</a>.<sup id="_ref-branford_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-branford" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1904, Isabella Blackstone donated the <a href="/wiki/Blackstone_Library" id="w">T.B. Blackstone Memorial Branch Library</a> to the city of Chicago. Located at the intersection of Blackstone Avenue, Lake Park Avenue, and Forty-ninth Street, the library is modeled after the James Blackstone Library in Branford, Connecticut.  Blackstone Avenue  running along the 1436 east  block from 4900 south (starting behind Blackstone Library) to 10350 south is named after him.<sup id="_ref-SC_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SC" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also, the Blackstone&#39;s funded Blackstone Hall in the Art Institute of Chicago Building.  This two story ground level ground-level gallery was added next to the east wall of the original building for display of architectural and sculptural <a href="/wiki/Casting" id="w">casts</a>.<sup id="_ref-tAICMS10_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tAICMS10" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Support_for_Zionism" name="Support_for_Zionism"></a><h1>Support for Zionism</h1>
<p>Blackstone was an early financial supporter of his cousin, <a href="/wiki/William_Eugene_Blackstone" id="w">William Eugene Blackstone</a>,<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> who in 1891 proposed giving <a href="/wiki/Palestine" id="w">Palestine</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jews</a>.  It is not clear, however, whether this support is indicative of his personal position on the topic of <a href="/wiki/Zionism" id="w">zionism</a>.</p>
