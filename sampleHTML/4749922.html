The <b>Youngstown Ohio Works</b> baseball team was a <a href="/wiki/Minor_league_baseball" id="w">minor league</a> club that was known for winning the premier championship of the <a href="/wiki/Ohio-Pennsylvania_League" id="w">Ohio–Pennsylvania League</a> in 1905,<sup id="_ref-ohio-pa-1905_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ohio-pa-1905" title="">[1]</a></sup> and for launching the professional career of <a href="/wiki/Pitcher" id="w">pitcher</a> <a href="/wiki/Roy_Castleton" id="w">Roy Castleton</a> a year later.<sup id="_ref-Society for American Baseball Research _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society for American Baseball Research " title="">[2]</a></sup> A training ground for several players and officials who later established careers in <a href="/wiki/Major_league_baseball" id="w">major league baseball</a>, the team proved a formidable regional competitor and also won the 1906 league championship. </p>
<p>During its brief span of activity, the Ohio Works team faced challenges that reflected common difficulties within the Ohio-Pennsylvania League, including weak financial support for teams.<sup id="_ref-sp217_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sp217" title="">[3]</a></sup> Following a dispute over funding, the team&#39;s owners sold the club to outside investors, just a few months before the opening of the 1907 season.<sup id="_ref-baseball-reference_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baseball-reference" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The club&#39;s strong record and regional visibility spurred the growth of amateur and minor league baseball in the Youngstown area, and the community&#39;s minor league teams produced notable players throughout the first half of the 20th century.<sup id="_ref-Landolf_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Landolf" title="">[5]</a></sup> In the late 1990s, this tradition was rekindled, with the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/Mahoning_Valley_Scrappers" id="w">Mahoning Valley Scrappers</a>, a minor league team based in neighboring <a href="/wiki/Niles%2C_Ohio" id="w">Niles, Ohio</a>.<sup id="_ref-scrappers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scrappers" title="">[6]</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The team opened the 1905 season with an unexpected 4&#8211;1 loss to the Canton Protectives, inspiring a local newspaper to comment that the Youngstown team made &#34;as many errors as hits while Canton fielded almost perfectly and hit opportunely&#34;.<sup id="_ref-vind-yo-05-03-1905_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vind-yo-05-03-1905" title="">[10]</a></sup> The Ohio Works club gained steam, however, and began to win games. On <a href="/wiki/May_11" id="w">May 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1905" id="w">1905</a>, the Youngstown team garnered controversy when <i>The Akron Times-Democrat</i> reported that the Ohio Works&#39; sponsors provided player salaries that nearly doubled those offered by other clubs in the Ohio–Pennsylvania League.<sup id="_ref-vind-yo-05-11-1905_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vind-yo-05-11-1905" title="">[11]</a></sup> In a report on the outcry in Akron, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Vindicator" id="w">The Youngstown Daily Vindicator</a></i> warned that, &#34;if the Youngstown backers keep adding and force the other clubs to add to the salaries, it is a question of only a short time until independent baseball will be an impossibility&#34;.<sup id="_ref-vind-yo-05-11-1905_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vind-yo-05-11-1905" title="">[11]</a></sup> The newspaper article concluded that the large salaries provided by the Ohio Works&#39;s sponsors placed a special burden on teams based in &#34;smaller cities&#34;.<sup id="_ref-vind-yo-05-11-1905_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vind-yo-05-11-1905" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p> 
<p>Competition among league participants was intense, and games were often raucous affairs. On <a href="/wiki/July_16" id="w">July 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1905" id="w">1905</a>, a riot broke out during a contest with a team in neighboring Niles, Ohio. According to a newspaper account, the trouble began when two female fans became involved in a &#34;hair-pulling fight&#34;. At one point, two &#34;well-known men&#34; were arrested for &#34;taking an umbrella from a woman and breaking it after she had been annoying them with it&#34;. Finally, dozens of fans swarmed into the field, where they &#34;pushed around the umpire and interfered with the defensive play of the Youngstown fielders&#34;.<sup id="_ref-vind-yo-04-11-99_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vind-yo-04-11-99" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In September 1905, the Youngstown Ohio Works won the first league championship, though sources disagree on the club&#39;s final record. This confusion may be due to the disorganized nature of the new league, with its sprawling roster of teams.<sup id="_ref-ohio-pa-1905_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ohio-pa-1905" title="">[1]</a></sup> According to the <i>Spalding Guide</i> (1906), &#34;The failure to furnish official reports was probably due to the clubs being new to a league&#34;.<sup id="_ref-sp289_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sp289" title="">[13]</a></sup> Baseball researcher Jim Holl summarizes the varied accounts as follows: &#34;<i>The Reach Guide</i> (1906) credits Youngstown with an 84–32 won–lost record where the <i>Spalding Guide</i> of the same year list a 90–35 record. The <i>Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball</i> (1993) tells a third story, giving Youngstown an 88–35 mark&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ohio-pa-1905_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ohio-pa-1905" title="">[1]</a></sup> Despite this uncertainty over the club&#39;s record, its championship status was not in dispute, and the team became popularly known as &#34;the Champs&#34;.<sup id="_ref-vindy-yo-06-19-06_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vindy-yo-06-19-06" title="">[14]</a></sup> This moniker, however, was not officially connected to a Youngstown-based ball club until 1907, when it became the legal name of the Ohio Works&#39; local successors.<sup id="_ref-Filchia258_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Filchia258" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

By the outset of the 1906 season, the Ohio–Pennsylvania League had trimmed down to a more manageable eight teams. Departing teams included franchises from Barberton, Braddock, Bucyrus, Butler, Canton, Homestead, Kent, Lima, Massillon, McKeesport, Mount Vernon, Niles, Steubenville, Washington, and Wooster. At the same time, the league attracted new teams from <a href="/wiki/New_Castle%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">New Castle, Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mansfield%2C_Ohio" id="w">Mansfield, Ohio</a>.<sup id="_ref-Society for American Baseball Research_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society for American Baseball Research" title="">[15]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Early in the season, as the Ohio Works team prepared for a second game with the Zanesville Moguls (close rivals in the 1905 championship games),<sup id="_ref-sp289_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sp289" title="">[13]</a></sup> the club manager, Hogan, spoke confidently on their chances of capturing the league pennant. &#34;If the boys go through the season as they are playing now, we will have no trouble winning out&#34;, he said to a reporter with <i>The Youngstown Daily Vindicator</i>. &#34;Our pitchers are in good condition and are holding the opposing batsmen to few hits. It is the pitching staff that has saved many a game for us. We have no .350 batters on the club, but any man on it is liable to step in and break up a game&#34;.<sup id="_ref-vindy-yo-06-19-06_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vindy-yo-06-19-06" title="">[14]</a></sup> A local newspaper confirmed Hogan&#39;s assessment of the team, observing that only one player, outfielder Will Thomas, had worked up a <a href="/wiki/Batting_average" id="w">batting average</a> of .306.<sup id="_ref-vindy-yo-06-25-1906_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vindy-yo-06-25-1906" title="">[16]</a></sup> Nevertheless, as Hogan predicted, the team defeated the Moguls, with a final score of 11&#8211;8. The game&#39;s highlights included the pitching of &#34;Long John&#34; Kennedy, who kept the Moguls to seven hits, and the batting of Edward Hilley, who &#34;unloosened a drive to middle field that permitted him to go all the way around&#34;.<sup id="_ref-vindy-yo-06-21-1906_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vindy-yo-06-21-1906" title="">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Hogan&#39;s overall confidence in the club was rewarded. The Youngstown team closed the season with an 84–53 record and won its second consecutive Ohio&#8211;Pennsylvania League championship.<sup id="_ref-baseball-reference_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baseball-reference" title="">[4]</a></sup> The star of the Ohio Works team was a gangling, left-handed pitcher named Roy Castleton, a <a href="/wiki/Utah" id="w">Utah</a> native who went on to pitch for the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Yankees" id="w">New York Highlanders</a> and Cincinnati Reds.<sup id="_ref-Society for American Baseball Research _b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society for American Baseball Research " title="">[2]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/August_17" id="w">August 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1906" id="w">1906</a>, Castleton gained national recognition when he pitched a <a href="/wiki/Perfect_game" id="w">perfect game</a> against rival Akron, shutting them out at 4–0.<sup id="_ref-Society for American Baseball Research _c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Society for American Baseball Research " title="">[2]</a></sup> With Castleton&#39;s assistance, the Youngstown Ohio Works claimed its third consecutive Ohio state pennant, a prize distinct from the league championship.<sup id="_ref-vindy-yo-10-14-06_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vindy-yo-10-14-06" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

Despite the club&#39;s apparent success, disagreements over funding led to its sale and relocation. On <a href="/wiki/February_18" id="w">February 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1907" id="w">1907</a>, the <i>Zanesville Signal</i> reported that Hogan had received permission from &#34;the Messrs.

<p>The ball club manager&#39;s evident frustration during this period was reflected in comments published in <i>The Youngstown Daily Vindicator</i> almost a week after the team&#39;s sale. When questioned on his widely publicized decision to resign as manager of the Youngstown club before the opening of the 1907 season, Hogan reportedly said that he had received &#34;the short end of the deal&#34;.<sup id="_ref-vindy-yo-2-24-07_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vindy-yo-2-24-07" title="">[21]</a></sup> No reference was made to the club&#39;s sale.<sup id="_ref-vindy-yo-2-24-07_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vindy-yo-2-24-07" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>The former Ohio Works manager was apparently not the only observer to suggest that Joseph McDonald engaged in &#34;unsportsmanlike tactics&#34;.<sup id="_ref-vindy-yo-05-02-20_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vindy-yo-05-02-20" title="">[22]</a></sup> A feature story, that appeared in <i>The Youngstown Daily Vindicator</i> in 1920, stated that McDonald took deliberate steps in 1907 to replace the Ohio Works team with a more seasoned club from <a href="/wiki/Homestead%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Homestead, Pennsylvania</a>.<sup id="_ref-vindy-yo-05-02-20_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vindy-yo-05-02-20" title="">[22]</a></sup> The new club became known officially as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Youngstown_Champs" id="w">Youngstown Champs</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Filchia258_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Filchia258" title="">[9]</a></sup> Rumors of McDonald&#39;s supposed strategy apparently angered local baseball fans.<sup id="_ref-vindy-yo-05-02-20_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vindy-yo-05-02-20" title="">[22]</a></sup> According to the 1920 feature article, the Youngstown media highlighted the Champs&#39; unexpected loss to the amateur <a href="/wiki/Rayen_High_School_(Youngstown%2C_Ohio)" id="w">Rayen</a> Athletics in 1907.<sup id="_ref-vindy-yo-05-02-20_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vindy-yo-05-02-20" title="">[22]</a></sup> The Champs, however, went on to win the Ohio–Pennsylvania League championship, closing the season with an 86–52 record.<sup id="_ref-baseball-reference_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-baseball-reference" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Meanwhile, former Ohio Works players in Zanesville struggled to regain their previous momentum. At the close of the 1907 season, the Zanesville club placed a lackluster third in the eight-team <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania-Ohio-Maryland_League" id="w">Pennsylvania-Ohio-Maryland League</a>, a Division D league that enjoyed far less prestige than the Ohio&#8211;Pennsylvania League.<sup id="_ref-POM_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-POM" title="">[23]</a></sup> In 1908, Hogan&#39;s final season as manager, the team was christened as the <a href="/wiki/Zanesville_Infants" id="w">Zanesville Infants</a> and joined the <a href="/wiki/Central_League" id="w">Central League</a>.<sup id="_ref-central_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-central" title="">[24]</a></sup> Further research is needed to determine the Zanesville Infants&#39; league ranking at the close of the 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up.<sup id="_ref-central_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-central" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>With the notable exception of Castleton, the progress of former Ohio Works players is difficult to track. Much is known about their ex-manager&#39;s subsequent career, however. In 1909, Hogan moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he signed future <a href="/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum" id="w">Hall of Fame</a> pitcher <a href="/wiki/Stan_Coveleski" id="w">Stan Coveleski</a> to his first professional contract.<sup id="_ref-roy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-roy" title="">[25]</a></sup> In 1909, the <a href="/wiki/Lancaster_Red_Roses" id="w">Lancaster Red Roses</a> worked up a 75-39 record,<sup id="_ref-rose_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rose" title="">[26]</a></sup> seizing the championship of the <a href="/wiki/Tri-State_League" id="w">Tri-State League</a>.<sup id="_ref-sp181_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sp181" title="">[27]</a></sup> As <i>Spalding&#39;s Baseball Guide</i> (1910) reported: &#34;Lancaster, under manager Marty Hogan, won its first pennant in the league, and the top rung of the ladder was only gained by the hardest kind of fighting&#34;.<sup id="_ref-sp181_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sp181" title="">[27]</a></sup> The following year, however, the Red Roses&#39; performance fell short of the previous season when it placed second, with 63 wins and 47 losses.<sup id="_ref-rose2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rose2" title="">[28]</a></sup> Then, in 1911, Hogan&#39;s last year as manager of the Lancaster team, the club placed a disappointing fourth in the eight-team league,<sup id="_ref-rose2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rose2" title="">[28]</a></sup> with 54 wins and losses, respectively.<sup id="_ref-rose_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rose" title="">[26]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Hogan went on to manage clubs in Zanesville and <a href="/wiki/Fond_Du_Lac%2C_Wisconsin" id="w">Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin</a>.<sup id="_ref-nyt-07-20-13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nyt-07-20-13" title="">[29]</a></sup>.

In the mid-1910s, he permanently resettled in Youngstown, where he helped to organize the Youngstown Gun Club and became athletic director of Thomas Field, a ballpark owned by the local Brier Hill Industrial Works. Hogan died in Youngstown in 1923, several months after being injured in an automobile accident.<sup id="_ref-vindy-yo-08-17-23_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vindy-yo-08-17-23" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
