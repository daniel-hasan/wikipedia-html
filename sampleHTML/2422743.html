<p><b>CXCR4</b>, also called <b>fusin</b>, is an alpha-<a href="/wiki/Chemokine" id="w">chemokine</a> receptor specific for stromal-derived-factor-1 (<a href="/wiki/Stromal_cell-derived_factor-1" id="w">SDF-1</a> also called CXCL12), a molecule endowed with potent <a href="/wiki/Chemotactic" id="w">chemotactic</a> activity for <a href="/wiki/Lymphocytes" id="w">lymphocytes</a>. This receptor is one of several chemokine receptors that <a href="/wiki/HIV" id="w">HIV</a> isolates can use to infect CD4+ T cells.  Traditionally, HIV <a href="/wiki/Isolates" id="w">isolates</a> that use CXCR4 are known as T-cell tropic isolates.  Typically these viruses are found late in infection.  It is unclear whether the emergence of CXCR4-using HIV is a consequence or a cause of <a href="/wiki/Immunodeficiency" id="w">immunodeficiency</a>.</p>
<p>Besides, CXCR4 is <a href="/wiki/Upregulated" id="w">upregulated</a> during the implantantion window in natural and HRT cycles in the endometrium, producing, in presence of a human <a href="/wiki/Blastocyst" id="w">blastocyst</a>, a surface polarization of the CXCR4 receptors suggesting that this receptor is implicated in the adhesion phase of human <a href="/wiki/Implantation" id="w">implantation</a>.</p>
<p>CXCR4&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ligand" id="w">ligand</a> <a href="/wiki/Stromal_cell-derived_factor-1" id="w">SDF-1</a> is known to be important in <a href="/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell" id="w">hematopoietic stem cell</a> homing to the bone marrow and in hematopoietic stem cell <a href="/wiki/Quiescence" id="w">quiescence</a>. Unusually for chemokines, SDF-1 and CXCR4 are a relatively &#34;monogamous&#34; ligand-receptor pair (other chemokines tend to use several different chemokine receptors in a fairly &#34;promiscuous&#34; manner). Because the interaction between SDF-1 and CXCR4 plays an important role in holding <a href="/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cells" id="w">hematopoietic stem cells</a> in the bone marrow, drugs that block the CXCR4 receptor appear to be capable of &#34;mobilizing&#34; hematopoietic stem cells into the bloodstream as <a href="/wiki/Peripheral_blood_stem_cells" id="w">peripheral blood stem cells</a>. <a href="/wiki/Peripheral_blood_stem_cell_mobilization" id="w">Peripheral blood stem cell mobilization</a> is very important in <a href="/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation" id="w">hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</a> (as a recent  alternative to transplantation of surgically-harvested <a href="/wiki/Bone_marrow" id="w">bone marrow</a>) and is currently performed using drugs such as <a href="/wiki/G-CSF" id="w">G-CSF</a>. <a href="/wiki/G-CSF" id="w">G-CSF</a> is a growth factor for <a href="/wiki/Neutrophils" id="w">neutrophils</a> (a common type of white blood cells), and may act by increasing the activity of neutrophil-derived proteases such as <a href="/wiki/Neutrophil_elastase" id="w">neutrophil elastase</a> in the bone marrow leading to proteolytic degradation of SDF-1. <a href="/wiki/AMD3100" id="w">AMD3100</a> is an investigational drug, not yet in routine clinical use, which directly blocks the CXCR4 receptor: it appears to be a very efficient inducer of <a href="/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_mobilization" id="w">hematopoietic stem cell mobilization</a> in animal and human studies.</p>
