<b>Batman</b> (originally referred to as <b>the Bat-Man</b> and still referred to at times as <b>the Batman</b>) is a <a href="/wiki/Fictional_character" id="w">fictional</a> <a href="/wiki/Comic_book" id="w">comic book</a> <a href="/wiki/Superhero" id="w">superhero</a> co-created by artist <a href="/wiki/Bob_Kane" id="w">Bob Kane</a> and writer <a href="/wiki/Bill_Finger" id="w">Bill Finger</a> (although only Kane receives official credit)<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and published by <a href="/wiki/DC_Comics" id="w">DC Comics</a>. The character made his <a href="/wiki/First_appearance" id="w">first appearance</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Detective_Comics" id="w">Detective Comics</a></i> #27 (May 1939). Batman&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Secret_identity" id="w">secret identity</a> is <b>Bruce Wayne</b>, a wealthy industrialist, playboy, and philanthropist. Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in <a href="/wiki/Gotham_City" id="w">Gotham City</a>, assisted by various supporting characters including his sidekick <a href="/wiki/Robin_(comics)" id="w">Robin</a> and his butler <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" id="w">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, and fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters&#39; roots in film and <a href="/wiki/Pulp_magazine" id="w">pulp magazines</a>. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any <a href="/wiki/Superpower_(ability)" id="w">superpowers</a>; he makes use of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime. </p>
<p>Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_(comic_book)" id="w">Batman</a></i>. As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The <a href="/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)" id="w">late 1960s &#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39;</a> <a href="/wiki/Television_series" id="w">television series</a> utilized a <a href="/wiki/Camp_(style)" id="w">camp</a> aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in the 1986 miniseries <i><a href="/wiki/Batman:_The_Dark_Knight_Returns" id="w">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></i>, by writer-artist <a href="/wiki/Frank_Miller_(comics)" id="w">Frank Miller</a>.

<p>Kane himself, in his 1989 <a href="/wiki/Autobiography" id="w">autobiography</a>, detailed Finger&#39;s contributions to Batman creation:
{{cquote}}</p>
<p>Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not, originally, say &#34;Batman created by Bob Kane&#34;; his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story&#39;s actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Siegel" id="w">Jerry Siegel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joe_Shuster" id="w">Joe Shuster</a> began receiving a &#34;created by&#34; credit on the Superman titles, along with <a href="/wiki/William_Moulton_Marston" id="w">William Moulton Marston</a> being given the byline for creating <a href="/wiki/Wonder_Woman" id="w">Wonder Woman</a>, Batman stories began saying &#34;Created by Bob Kane&#34; in addition to the other credits. </p>
<p>Finger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgement for his Batman writing; in the letters page of <i>Batman</i> #169 (Feb. 1965) for example, editor <a href="/wiki/Julius_Schwartz" id="w">Julius Schwartz</a> names him as the creator of the <a href="/wiki/Riddler" id="w">Riddler</a>, one of Batman&#39;s recurring villains. However, Finger&#39;s contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline. Kane wrote, &#34;Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by&#34;.<sup id="_ref-creation_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-creation" title="">[5]</a></sup>  At the time of Finger&#39;s death in 1974, DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co-creator. This lack of credit has influenced more recent creators entering the field. <a href="/wiki/Ed_Brubaker" id="w">Ed Brubaker</a>, a recent writer of <i>Detective Comics</i> noted that, &#34;if you&#39;re ever in a situation where you&#39;re worried that you&#39;re not getting proper credit for what you’re doing, you can say to your editor, &#39;Hey, I’m feeling like Bill Finger over here. And I don&#39;t want to get Fingered.&#39; And they&#39;ll understand. Everybody gets it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Jerry_Robinson" id="w">Jerry Robinson</a>, who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit.  He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Comics_Journal" id="w">The Comics Journal</a></i>,
{{cquote}}</p>
<p>Although Kane initially rebutted Finger&#39;s claims at having created the character, writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that &#34;it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the &#39;&#39;Batman, t&#39; (<a href="/wiki/Sic" id="w">sic</a>) as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters. This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue.&#34; Kane himself also commented on Finger&#39;s lack of credit. &#34;The trouble with being a &#39;ghost&#39; writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without &#39;credit&#39;. However, if one wants the &#39;credit&#39;, then one has to cease being a &#39;ghost&#39; or follower and become a leader or innovator.&#34;<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> In 1989, Kane revisited Finger&#39;s situation,  recalling in interview, {{cquote}}</p>

The first Batman story, &#34;The Case of the Chemical Syndicate,&#34; was published in <i>Detective Comics</i> #27 (May 1939). Finger said, &#34;Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps&#34;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals and was not above using firearms. Batman proved a hit character, and he received his own solo title in 1940, while continuing to star in <i>Detective Comics</i>. By that time, National was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company&#39;s other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company&#39;s success.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The two characters were featured side-by-side as the stars of <i><a href="/wiki/World%26%2339%3Bs_Finest_Comics" id="w">World&#39;s Finest Comics</a></i>, which was originally titled <i>World&#39;s Best Comics</i> when it debuted in fall 1940. Creators including <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Robinson" id="w">Jerry Robinson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dick_Sprang" id="w">Dick Sprang</a> also worked on the strips during this period.</p>
<p>Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and Kane&#39;s artistic depiction of Batman evolved. Kane noted within six issues he drew the character&#39;s jaw more pronounced and lengthened the ears on the costume; &#34;About a year later he was almost the full figure, my mature Batman,&#34; Kane said.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Batman&#39;s characteristic utility belt was introduced in <i>Detective Comics</i> #29 (July 1939), followed by the batarang and the first bat-themed vehicle in #31 (September 1939), and the character&#39;s origin was revealed in #33 (November 1939). The early pulp-influenced portrayal of Batman started to soften in <i>Detective Comics</i> #38 in 1940 with the introduction of Robin, Batman&#39;s kid sidekick.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Robin was introduced based on Finger&#39;s suggestion Batman needed a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Doctor_Watson" id="w">Watson</a>&#34; with whom Batman could talk.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Sales nearly doubled, despite Kane&#39;s preference for a solo Batman, and it sparked a proliferation of &#34;kid sidekicks.&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> The first issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_(comic_book)" id="w">Batman</a></i> was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent antagonists, the <a href="/wiki/Joker_(comics)" id="w">Joker</a> and <a href="/wiki/Catwoman" id="w">Catwoman</a>, but for one of the stories in the issue where Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death. That story prompted editor <a href="/wiki/Whitney_Ellsworth" id="w">Whitney Ellsworth</a> to issue a decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> By 1942 the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> In the years following <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, DC Comics &#34;adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de-emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy.&#34; The impact of this editorial approach was evident in <i>Batman</i> comics of the postwar period; removed from the &#34;bleak and menacing world&#34; of the strips of the early 1940s, Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a &#34;bright and colorful&#34; environment.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<a id="1950-1963" name="1950-1963"></a><h3>1950-1963</h3>
<p>Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s. In the story &#34;The Mightiest Team In the World&#34; in <i><a href="/wiki/Superman_(comic_book)" id="w">Superman</a></i> #76 (June 1952), Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discovers each other&#39;s secret identity.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Following the success of this story, <i>World&#39;s Finest Comics</i> was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together, instead of the separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The team-up of the characters was &#34;a financial success in an era when those were few and far between;&#34;<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> this series of stories ran until the book&#39;s cancellation in 1986.</p>
<p>Batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist <a href="/wiki/Fredric_Wertham" id="w">Fredric Wertham</a>&#39;s book <i><a href="/wiki/Seduction_of_the_Innocent" id="w">Seduction of the Innocent</a></i> in 1954. Wertham&#39;s thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupt the morals of the youth. Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed <a href="/wiki/Homosexual" id="w">homosexual</a> overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> Wertham&#39;s criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/Comics_Code_Authority" id="w">Comics Code Authority</a>. The tendency towards a &#34;sunnier Batman&#34; in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the Comics Code.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> It has also been suggested by scholars that the characters of <a href="/wiki/Batwoman" id="w">Batwoman</a> (in 1956) and <a href="/wiki/Bette_Kane" id="w">Bat-Girl</a> (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay, and the stories took on a campier, lighter feel.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the late 1950 Batman stories gradually become more <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a>-oriented, an attempt at mimicking the success of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> New characters such as Batwoman, <a href="/wiki/Ace_the_Bat-Hound" id="w">Ace the Bat-Hound</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bat-Mite" id="w">Bat-Mite</a> were introduced. Batman has adventures involving either odd transformations or dealing with bizarre space aliens. In 1960, Batman debuted as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Justice_League" id="w">Justice League of America</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Brave_and_the_Bold" id="w">The Brave and the Bold</a></i> #28 (February 1960) and went on to appear in several Justice League comic series starting later that same year.</p>

<p>By 1964, sales on Batman titles had fallen drastically; Bob Kane noted that as a result &#34;[DC was] planning to kill Batman off altogether.&#34;<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Editor <a href="/wiki/Julius_Schwartz" id="w">Julius Schwartz</a> was soon assigned to the Batman titles and presided over drastic changes. Beginning with 1964&#39;s <i>Detective Comics</i> #327 (May 1964) &#8212; cover-billed as the &#34;New Look&#34; &#8212; Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary and return him to more detective-oriented stories, including a redesign of Batman&#39;s equipment, the <a href="/wiki/Batmobile" id="w">Batmobile</a>, and his costume (introducing the yellow ellipse behind the costume&#39;s bat-insignia), and brought in artist <a href="/wiki/Carmine_Infantino" id="w">Carmine Infantino</a> to help in this makeover. The space aliens and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace, and Bat-Mite were retired. Batman&#39;s erstwhile butler Alfred was killed and replaced with Aunt Harriet, who came to live with Bruce Wayne and <a href="/wiki/Dick_Grayson" id="w">Dick Grayson</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

The debut of the <a href="/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39;</a> television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character. The success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry, and <i>Batman</i> reached a circulation of close to 900,000 copies.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Elements such as the character of <a href="/wiki/Batgirl" id="w">Batgirl</a> and the show&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Camp_(style)" id="w">campy</a> nature were introduced into the comics; the series also initiated the return of Alfred. Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968. In the aftermath the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again. As Julius Schwartz noted, &#34;When the television show was a success, I was asked to be campy, and of course when the show faded, so did the comic books.&#34;<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Starting in 1969, writer <a href="/wiki/Dennis_O%26%2339%3BNeil" id="w">Dennis O&#39;Neil</a> and artist <a href="/wiki/Neal_Adams" id="w">Neal Adams</a> made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a &#34;grim avenger of the night.&#34;<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> O&#39;Neil said his idea was &#34;simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after.&#34;<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> O&#39;Neil and Adams first collaborated on the story &#34;The Secret of the Waiting Graves&#34; (<i>Detective Comics</i> #395, Jan. 1970). Few stories were true collaborations between O&#39;Neil, Adams, Schwartz, and inker <a href="/wiki/Dick_Giordano" id="w">Dick Giordano</a>, and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s; nevertheless the influence of their work was &#34;tremendous.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Giordano said, &#34;We went back to a grimmer, darker Batman, and I think that&#39;s why these stories did so well . . .

Batman&#39;s history has undergone various revisions, both minor and major. Few elements of the character&#39;s history have remained constant. Scholars William Uricchio and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, &#34;Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades.&#34;<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

In Batman&#39;s first appearance in <i>Detective Comics</i> #27, he is already operating as a crime fighter.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> Batman&#39;s origin is first presented in <i>Detective Comics</i> #33 in November 1939, and is later fleshed out in <i>Batman</i> #47. As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable <a href="/wiki/Gotham_City" id="w">Gotham City</a> socialites. Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named <a href="/wiki/Joe_Chill" id="w">Joe Chill</a> on their way home from the movie theater. Bruce Wayne swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents&#39; lives. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. &#34;Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot&#34;, Wayne remarks, &#34;so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...&#34; As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>In early strips, Batman&#39;s career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named <a href="/wiki/Julie_Madison" id="w">Julie Madison</a>.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin.

<a id="Silver_Age" name="Silver_Age"></a><h3>Silver Age</h3>
<p>{{see also}}
The <a href="/wiki/Silver_Age_of_comic_books" id="w">Silver Age of comic books</a> in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced <a href="/wiki/Flash_(Barry_Allen)" id="w">Barry Allen</a> as a new, updated version of <a href="/wiki/Flash_(comics)" id="w">The Flash</a>. Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as <a href="/wiki/Multiverse_(DC_Comics)" id="w">Earth-One</a>. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature a large number of science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until <i>Detective Comics</i> #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.</p>

After the introduction of DC Comics&#39; <a href="/wiki/Multiverse_(DC_Comics)" id="w">multiverse</a> in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the <a href="/wiki/Batman_(Earth-Two)" id="w">Earth-Two Batman</a>, a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle (as shown in <i><a href="/wiki/Superman_Family" id="w">Superman Family</a></i> #211) and fathers <a href="/wiki/Huntress_(Helena_Wayne)" id="w">Helena Wayne</a>, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the <a href="/wiki/Dick_Grayson#Earth-Two Dick Grayson" id="w">Earth-Two Robin</a>) Gotham&#39;s protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or <a href="/wiki/Green_Lantern" id="w">Green Lantern</a>, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> Nevertheless, details of Batman&#39;s history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in <i>Batman</i> #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> In 1980 then-editor <a href="/wiki/Paul_Levitz" id="w">Paul Levitz</a> commissioned the <i>Untold Legend of the Batman</i> <a href="/wiki/Limited_series" id="w">limited series</a> to thoroughly chronicle Batman&#39;s origin and history.</p>
<p>Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in <i><a href="/wiki/World%26%2339%3Bs_Finest_Comics" id="w">World&#39;s Finest Comics</a></i>, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series&#39; cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the <a href="/wiki/Justice_League" id="w">Justice League of America</a>, appearing in its first story in 1960s <i><a href="/wiki/Brave_and_the_Bold" id="w">Brave and the Bold</a></i> #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, <i>Brave and the Bold</i> became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different <a href="/wiki/DC_Universe" id="w">DC Universe</a> superhero each month.</p>
<p>In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics&#39; effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City&#39;s crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman&#39;s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous Joker, and the arrival of <a href="/wiki/Ra%26%2339%3Bs_Al_Ghul" id="w">Ra&#39;s Al Ghul</a>. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes <a href="/wiki/Nightwing" id="w">Nightwing</a>.</p>
<p>In the final issue of <i>Brave and the Bold</i> in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the <a href="/wiki/Outsiders_(comics)" id="w">Outsiders</a>.  He serves as the team&#39;s leader until <i>Batman and the Outsiders</i> #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.</p>
<a id="Modern_Batman" name="Modern_Batman"></a><h3>Modern Batman</h3>
<p>After the 12-issue <a href="/wiki/Limited_series" id="w">limited series</a> <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i>, DC Comics <a href="/wiki/Retcon" id="w">rebooted</a> the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman&#39;s origin in the storyline <a href="/wiki/Batman:_Year_One" id="w">Year One</a> from <i>Batman</i> #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman&#39;s Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham&#39;s police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman&#39;s existence. While Dick Grayson&#39;s past remains much the same, the history of <a href="/wiki/Jason_Todd" id="w">Jason Todd</a>, the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following <i>Crisis</i>, DC launched a new Batman title called <i><a href="/wiki/Legends_of_the_Dark_Knight" id="w">Legends of the Dark Knight</a></i> in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the &#34;Year One&#34; period. Various stories from <a href="/wiki/Jeph_Loeb" id="w">Jeph Loeb</a> and <a href="/wiki/Matt_Wagner" id="w">Matt Wagner</a> also touch upon this era.

In 1988&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Batman:_A_Death_in_the_Family" id="w">Batman: A Death in the Family</a>&#34; storyline from <i>Batman</i> #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker. Subsequently Batman takes an even darker, often excessive approach to his crimefighting. Batman works solo until the decade&#39;s close, when <a href="/wiki/Robin_(Tim_Drake)" id="w">Tim Drake</a> becomes the new Robin.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> In 2005 writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor.</p>
<p>Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, the same year that DC published the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Death_of_Superman" id="w">Death of Superman</a>&#34; storyline, the publisher released the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Knightfall" id="w">Knightfall</a>&#34; storyline. In the storyline&#39;s first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of &#34;Knightfall&#34;, the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman&#39;s adventures, and Bruce Wayne&#39;s quest to become Batman once more.  The story arcs realign in &#34;KnightsEnd&#34;, as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to his role as Batman.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>1994&#39;s company-wide crossover <i><a href="/wiki/Zero_Hour_(comics)" id="w">Zero Hour</a></i> changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes&#39; killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing <a href="/wiki/Joe_Chill" id="w">Joe Chill</a> from the new continuity, rendering stories such as &#34;Year Two&#34; non-canon.</p>
<p>Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison&#39;s 1996 relaunch of the series, titled <i>JLA</i>. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team&#39;s successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade&#39;s closing crossover arc. In 1998&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Batman:_Cataclysm" id="w">Cataclysm</a>&#34; storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/No_Man%26%2339%3Bs_Land_(comics)" id="w">No Man&#39;s Land</a>.&#34; While <a href="/wiki/Lex_Luthor" id="w">Lex Luthor</a> rebuilds Gotham at the end of the &#34;No Man&#39;s Land&#34; storyline, he then frames Bruce Wayne for murder in the &#34;Bruce Wayne: Murderer?&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Bruce_Wayne:_Fugitive" id="w">Bruce Wayne: Fugitive</a>&#34; story arcs; Wayne is eventually acquitted.</p>
<p>DC&#39;s 2005 <a href="/wiki/Limited_series" id="w">limited series</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Identity_Crisis_(comics)" id="w">Identity Crisis</a></i>, reveals that JLA member <a href="/wiki/Zatanna" id="w">Zatanna</a> had edited Batman&#39;s memories, leading to his deep loss of trust in the rest of the superhero community. Batman later creates the <a href="/wiki/OMACs" id="w">Brother I</a> satellite surveillance system to watch over the other heroes. Its eventual co-opting by <a href="/wiki/Maxwell_Lord" id="w">Maxwell Lord</a> is one of the main events that leads to the <i><a href="/wiki/Infinite_Crisis" id="w">Infinite Crisis</a></i> miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In <i>Infinite Crisis</i> #7, <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Luthor%2C_Jr." id="w">Alexander Luthor, Jr.</a> mentions that in the newly-rewritten history of the &#34;New Earth&#34;, created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne - again, Joe Chill - was captured, thus undoing the <a href="/wiki/Retcon" id="w">retcon</a> created after <i>Zero Hour</i>. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs. Following <i>Infinite Crisis</i>, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to &#34;rebuild Batman&#34;. In the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Batman:_Face_the_Face" id="w">Face the Face</a>&#34; storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. At the end of the story arc, Bruce adopts Tim as his son.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> The follow-up story arc in <i>Batman</i>, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Batman_%26amp%3B_Son" id="w">Batman &#38; Son</a>&#34;, introduces <a href="/wiki/Damian_Wayne" id="w">Damian Wayne</a>, who is Batman&#39;s son with <a href="/wiki/Talia_al_Ghul" id="w">Talia al Ghul</a>.

<a id="Characterization" name="Characterization"></a><h2>Characterization</h2>
<p>Batman&#39;s primary character traits can be summarized as &#34;wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and obsession.&#34;<sup id="_ref-pearson pg 186_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pearson pg 186" title="">[45]</a></sup> The details and tone of Batman&#39;s characterization have varied over the years due to different intrepretations. Dennis O&#39;Neil noted that character consistency wasn&#39;t a major concern during earlier editorial regimes; he said, &#34;Julie Schwartz did a Batman in <i>Batman</i> and <i>Detective</i> and Murray Boltinoff did a Batman in the <i>Brave and the Bold</i> and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not coordinate their efforts, did not pretend to, did not want to, were not asked to. Continuity was not important in those days.&#34;<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>A main component that defines Batman as a character is his origin story. Bob Kane said he and Bill Finger discussed the character&#39;s background and decided that &#34;there&#39;s nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes.&#34;<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> Batman is thus driven to fight crime in order to avenge the death of his parents.<sup id="_ref-pearson pg 186_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pearson pg 186" title="">[45]</a></sup> While details of Batman&#39;s origin have varied from version to version, the &#34;reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions&#34; of the character.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> The origin is the source of many of the character&#39;s traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character&#39;s adventures.<sup id="_ref-pearson pg 186_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pearson pg 186" title="">[45]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as &#34;a dionysian figure, a force for anarchy that imposes an individual order.&#34;<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> Dressed as a bat, Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime fighting.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Bruce_Wayne" name="Bruce_Wayne"></a><h3>Bruce Wayne</h3>
<p>In his secret identity, Batman is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy businessman who lives in Gotham City. Like Superman, the prominent persona of Batman&#39;s dual identities varies with time. Modern-age comics have tended to portray &#34;Bruce Wayne&#34; as the facade, with &#34;Batman&#34; as the truer representation of his personality (in counterpoint to the post-Crisis Superman, whose &#34;Clark Kent&#34; persona is the &#39;real&#39; personality, and &#34;Superman&#34; is the act). </p>
<p>To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is often seen as an irresponsible, superficial playboy who lives off his family&#39;s personal fortune (amassed when Bruce&#39;s family invested in Gotham real estate before the city was a bustling metropolis) and the profits of <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Enterprises" id="w">Wayne Enterprises</a>, a major private technology firm that he inherits. However, Wayne is also known for his contributions to charity, notably through his Wayne Foundation charity.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> Bruce creates the playboy public persona to aid in throwing off suspicion of his secret identity, often acting dim-witted and self-absorbed to further the act.</p>
<a id="Skills%2C_abilities%2C_and_resources" name="Skills%2C_abilities%2C_and_resources"></a><h2>Skills, abilities, and resources</h2>
<p>Unlike many superheroes, Batman has no superpowers and instead relies on &#34;his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess.&#34;<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> Batman is physically at the peak of human ability in dozens of areas, notably <a href="/wiki/Martial_arts" id="w">martial arts</a>, acrobatics, strength, and escape artistry. Intellectually, he is just as peerless; Batman is one of the world&#39;s greatest scientists, engineers, criminologists, and tacticians, as well as a master of disguise, often gathering information under the identity of <a href="/wiki/Matches_Malone" id="w">Matches Malone</a>. He is regarded as one of the DC Universe&#39;s greatest detectives. Rather than simply outfighting his opponents, Batman often uses cunning and planning to outwit them. In Grant Morrison&#39;s first storyline in <i>JLA</i>, Superman describes Batman as &#34;the most dangerous man on Earth,&#34; able to defeat a team of superpowered aliens all by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup>  </p>
<a id="Costume" name="Costume"></a><h3>Costume</h3>
<p>{{main}}
Batman&#39;s costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals. The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various stories and media, but the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape, a <a href="/wiki/Cowl" id="w">cowl</a> covering most of the face featuring a pair of batlike ears, and a stylized bat emblem on the chest, plus the ever-present <a href="/wiki/Batman%26%2339%3Bs_utility_belt" id="w">utility belt</a>. The costumes&#39; colors are traditionally blue and grey although black or black with dark blue highlights are frequently substituted for the blue. Batman&#39;s gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from the sides. A yellow ellipse around the bat logo on the character&#39;s chest was added in 1964, and became the hero&#39;s trademark symbol, akin to the red and yellow &#34;S&#34; symbol of Superman.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl&#39;s ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O&#39;Neil said, &#34;We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don&#39;t have to look the same . . . Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>

Batman utilizes a large arsenal of specialized gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian <a href="/wiki/Les_Daniels" id="w">Les Daniels</a> credits <a href="/wiki/Gardner_Fox" id="w">Gardner Fox</a> with creating the concept of Batman&#39;s arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in <i>Detective Comics</i> #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the <a href="/wiki/Batarang" id="w">batarang</a> and the &#34;Batgyro&#34; in <i>Detective Comics</i> #31 and #32 (September; October, 1939).<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> Batman&#39;s primary vehicle is the Batmobile, which is usually depicted as an imposing black car with large <a href="/wiki/Tailfin" id="w">tailfins</a> that suggest a bat&#39;s wings. Batman&#39;s other vehicles include the <a href="/wiki/Batplane" id="w">Batplane</a> (aka the Batwing), <a href="/wiki/Batboat" id="w">Batboat</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bat-Sub" id="w">Bat-Sub</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Batcycle" id="w">Batcycle</a>.</p>
<p>In proper practice, the &#34;bat&#34; prefix (as in batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s <a href="/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Batman&#39;&#39; live-action television show</a> and the <i><a href="/wiki/Super_Friends" id="w">Super Friends</a></i> animated series) stretched the practice to <a href="/wiki/Camp_(style)" id="w">camp</a> proportions. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such ridiculous, satirical &#34;bat-&#34; names as the bat-computer, bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, <a href="/wiki/Shark" id="w">shark</a> repellent bat-spray, and bat-rope. The storyline &#34;A Death in the Family&#34; suggests that given Batman&#39;s grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the &#34;bat&#34; prefix on his own. </p>
<p>Batman keeps most of his field equipment in a signature piece of apparel, a utility belt. Over the years it is shown to contain a virtually limitless variety of crimefighting tools. Different versions of the belt have these items stored in either pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it.</p>
<p>In some of his early appearances, Batman uses guns (see especially <i>Detective Comics</i> #32, September 1939), but he uses them less over time, later eschewing their use because a gun was used to murder his parents. Some stories relax this rule, allowing Batman to arm his vehicles for the purpose of disabling other vehicles or removing inanimate obstacles. In two stories, <i>The Dark Knight Returns</i> and <i>The Cult</i>, Batman used machine guns loaded with rubber bullets rather than live ammunition. In the 1989 <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_(1989_film)" id="w">Batman</a></i> film, firearms figure more prominently in the Dark Knight&#39;s arsenal; machine guns and grenades are mounted on the Batmobile, and missiles and machine cannons on the Batwing. </p>
<a id="Bat-Signal" name="Bat-Signal"></a><h3>Bat-Signal</h3>
<p>{{main}}
One of the best-known elements of the Batman mythos is the Bat-Signal. When Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a <a href="/wiki/Searchlight" id="w">searchlight</a> with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens that shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.</p>
<p>In various incarnations, most notably the 1960s <a href="/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)" id="w">Batman TV series</a>, Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent cake cover on top. The line connects directly to Wayne Manor, specifically to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne&#39;s study.</p>
<a id="Batcave" name="Batcave"></a><h3>Batcave</h3>
<p>{{main}}
The Batcave is Batman&#39;s secret headquarters, consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his residence, <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Manor" id="w">Wayne Manor</a>. It serves as his command centre for both local and global surveillance, as well as housing his vehicles and equipment for his war on crime. It also is a storeroom for Batman&#39;s memorabilia. In both the comic <i>Batman: Shadow of the Bat</i> issue #45, and the 2005 film <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_Begins" id="w">Batman Begins</a></i>, the cave is said to have been part of the <a href="/wiki/Underground_Railroad" id="w">Underground Railroad</a>. Of the heroes and villains who see the Batcave, few know where it is located. The cave is also home to a large colony of bats which Batman can summon to a scene with a sonic device. Batman also has several little caches throughout the city, linked together through his computer, where he stores extra equipment.</p>

Batman&#39;s interactions with the characters around him, both heroes and villains, help to define the character.<sup id="_ref-pearson pg 186_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pearson pg 186" title="">[45]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_police" id="w">Commissioner</a> <a href="/wiki/James_Gordon_(comics)" id="w">James &#34;Jim&#34; Gordon</a>, Batman&#39;s ally in the Gotham City police, debuted along with Batman in <i>Detective Comics</i> #27 and has been a consistent presence since then. However, the most important supporting role in the Batman mythos is filled by the hero&#39;s young sidekick Robin.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> The first Robin, Dick Grayson, eventually leaves his mentor and becomes the hero Nightwing. The second Robin, <a href="/wiki/Jason_Todd" id="w">Jason Todd</a>, is beaten to death by the Joker but later returns as an adversary. <a href="/wiki/Robin_(Tim_Drake)" id="w">Tim Drake</a>, the third Robin, first appears in 1989 and has gone on to star in his own comic series.

<p>Batman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the Justice League of America and the Outsiders. Batman has often been paired in adventure with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the co-stars of <i>World&#39;s Finest</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Superman/Batman" id="w">Superman/Batman</a></i> series. In pre-Crisis continuity, the two are depicted as close friends; however, in current continuity, they have a mutually respectful but uneasy relationship, with an emphasis on their differing views on crimefighting and justice.</p>
<p>Batman is involved romantically with many women throughout his various incarnations. These range from society women such as <a href="/wiki/Vicki_Vale" id="w">Vicki Vale</a> and <a href="/wiki/Silver_St._Cloud" id="w">Silver St. Cloud</a>, to allies like <a href="/wiki/Sasha_Bordeaux" id="w">Sasha Bordeaux</a>, to even villainesses such as Catwoman and <a href="/wiki/Talia_al_Ghul" id="w">Talia al Ghul</a>. While these relationships tend to be short, Batman&#39;s attraction to Catwoman is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear. Authors have gone back and forth over the years as to how Batman manages the &#39;playboy&#39; aspect of Bruce Wayne&#39;s personality; at different times he embraces or flees from the women interested in attracting &#34;Gotham&#39;s most eligible bachelor&#34;.</p>
<p>Other supporting characters in Batman&#39;s world include former Batgirl <a href="/wiki/Barbara_Gordon" id="w">Barbara Gordon</a>, Commissioner Gordon&#39;s daughter who, now confined to a wheelchair due to a gunshot wound inflicted by the Joker, serves the superhero community at large as the <a href="/wiki/Hacker_(computer_security)" id="w">computer hacker</a> Oracle; Azrael, a would-be assassin who replaces Bruce Wayne as Batman for a time; <a href="/wiki/Cassandra_Cain" id="w">Cassandra Cain</a>, an assassin&#39;s daughter whose allegiance is put in scrutiny after a stint as Batgirl, Batwoman, a young socialite who operates in Gotham City during Batman&#39;s absence following <i>Infinite Crisis</i>; <a href="/wiki/Huntress" id="w">Huntress</a>, the sole surviving member of a mob family turned Gotham vilgilante who has worked with Batman on occasion; Ace the Bat-Hound, Batman&#39;s pet dog; and Bat-Mite, an extra-dimensional imp who adores Batman.</p>

The producers of <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i> would go to work on the animated feature film release <i><a href="/wiki/Batman:_Mask_of_the_Phantasm" id="w">Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</a></i> (1993), as well as the futuristic <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_Beyond" id="w">Batman Beyond</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Justice_League_(animated_series)" id="w">Justice League</a></i> series. Like <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>, these productions starred <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Conroy" id="w">Kevin Conroy</a> as the voice of Batman/Bruce Wayne. In 2004, a new animated series titled <i><a href="/wiki/The_Batman_(TV_series)" id="w">The Batman</a></i> made its debut with <a href="/wiki/Rino_Romano" id="w">Rino Romano</a> as the title character. In 2005 <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Nolan" id="w">Christopher Nolan</a> directed <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_Begins" id="w">Batman Begins</a></i>, a <a href="/wiki/Reboot_(continuity)" id="w">reboot</a> of the film franchise starring <a href="/wiki/Christian_Bale" id="w">Christian Bale</a> as Batman. A sequel to Nolan&#39;s film, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_(film)" id="w">The Dark Knight</a></i>, is due for release in July 2008.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup></p>

There has been some controversy over various sexual interpretations made regarding the content of Batman comics. Homosexual interpretations have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist Fredric Wertham asserted in <i><a href="/wiki/Seduction_of_the_Innocent" id="w">Seduction of the Innocent</a></i> that &#34;Batman stories are psychologically homosexual&#34;. He claimed that &#34;The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies, of the nature of which they may be unconscious&#34;. Wertham wrote, &#34;Only someone ignorant of the fundamentals of psychiatry and of the psychopathology of sex can fail to realize a subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature &#39;Batman&#39; and his young friend &#39;Robin&#39;&#34;.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>
<p>Andy Medhurst wrote in his essay &#34;Batman, Deviance, and Camp&#34; that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because &#34;he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality,&#34; &#34;the 1960s TV series remains a touchstone of camp,&#34; and &#34;[he] merits analysis as a notably successful construction of masculinity.&#34;<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup></p>
<p>Creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions. Writer Alan Grant has stated, &#34;The Batman I wrote for 13 years isn&#39;t gay. Denny O&#39;Neil&#39;s Batman, Marv Wolfman&#39;s Batman, everybody&#39;s Batman all the way back to Bob Kane... none of them wrote him as a gay character. Only <a href="/wiki/Joel_Schumacher" id="w">Joel Schumacher</a> might have had an opposing view&#34;. Writer <a href="/wiki/Devin_Grayson" id="w">Devin Grayson</a> has commented, &#34;It depends who you ask, doesn&#39;t it? Since you&#39;re asking me, I&#39;ll say no, I don&#39;t think he is ... I certainly understand the gay readings, though&#34;.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup> While Frank Miller has described the relationship between Batman and the Joker as a &#34;homophobic nightmare&#34;,<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup> he views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting, concluding, &#34;He&#39;d be <i>much</i> healthier if he were gay&#34;.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Burt_Ward" id="w">Burt Ward</a> has also remarked upon this interpretation in his autobiography <i>Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights</i>, noting the relationship could be interpreted as a sexual one, with the show&#39;s double entendres and lavish camp also possibly offering ambiguous interpretation.<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some continue to play off the homosexual interpretations of Batman. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused to allow permission for the reprinting of four panels (from <i>Batman</i> #79, 92, 105 and 139) to illustrate Christopher York&#39;s paper <i>All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s</i>.<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup> Another happened in the summer of 2005, when painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup> DC threatened both artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling the works and demanded all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them.<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup></p>
