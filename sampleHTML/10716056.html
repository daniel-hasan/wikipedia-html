<p>In June 1931, <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Sergeyevich_Vakhmistrov" id="w">Vladimir Sergeyevich Vakhmistrov</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Scientific_Research_Institute_of_the_Air_Forces" id="w">Soviet Scientific Research Institute of the Air Forces</a> started work on combinations of fighters rigidly attached to heavy bomber aircraft. The system was envisioned to serve several purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Delivery of fighters beyond their conventional range</li>
<li>Provision of bombers with escort fighters</li>
<li>Use of fighters for dive bombing with heavier bombs than they would be able to take off with on their own</li>
<li>Using the added thrust of parasite aircraft to get a heavily-laden bomber airborne.<sup id="_ref-shavrov_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shavrov" title="">[1]</a></sup></li></ol>
<p>In all <i>Zveno</i> configurations, all aircraft were piloted and all had their engines turned on — it was expected that the combined thrust would more than offset the weight and actually improve the performance of the mothership compared to conventional bombers.<sup id="_ref-stefan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stefan" title="">[2]</a></sup> The fighters were rigidly attached via pyramid-shaped metal frames with bomb latches controlled by the fighter pilots (on Zveno-1, the front latched were controlled by the bomber crew, while the back latch was controlled by the pilot, this was changed to all-pilot control in the next version).<sup id="_ref-stefan_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stefan" title="">[2]</a></sup> The original design included umbilical fuel lines which permitted the fighters to use fuel from the bomber while attached,<sup id="_ref-stefan_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stefan" title="">[2]</a></sup> although this was not fully implemented in practice.</p>
<p>The first successful flight of <b>Zveno-1</b> using a <a href="/wiki/Tupolev_TB-1" id="w">Tupolev TB-1</a> mothership and two <a href="/wiki/Tupolev_I-4" id="w">Tupolev I-4</a> fighters mounted on top of the wings took place on <a href="/wiki/3_December" id="w">3 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1931" id="w">1931</a>. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed.<sup id="_ref-stefan_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stefan" title="">[2]</a></sup> After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from the bomber.<sup id="_ref-stefan_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stefan" title="">[2]</a></sup> As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and <b>Zveno-2</b> <a href="/wiki/Tupolev_TB-3" id="w">Tupolev TB-3</a> carrying three <a href="/wiki/Polikarpov_I-5" id="w">Polikarpov I-5</a> fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber.<sup id="_ref-stefan_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stefan" title="">[2]</a></sup> To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted on top of the fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air.<sup id="_ref-stefan_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stefan" title="">[2]</a></sup> At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.<sup id="_ref-stefan_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stefan" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <b>Zveno-3</b> in which TB-3 carried two <a href="/wiki/Grigorovich_I-Z" id="w">Grigorovich I-Z</a> fighters under the wings presented a different challenge — the I-Z was a monoplane with fixed landing gear which touched the ground while it was suspended under the mothership. To accommodate the uneven ground during takeoffs, the fighters were attached via a floating frame that permitted vertical movement relative to the TB-3. However, immediately after takeoff the I-Z pilots had to push forward on the control sticks to lock the frame in the fixed bottom position — if the fighter-bomber was not rigid in flight, the bomber became extremely difficult to control.<sup id="_ref-stefan_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stefan" title="">[2]</a></sup> During one of the test flights, I-Z pilot Korotkov incorrectly timed the locking maneuver and the lift generated by his fighter broke the docking frame and crashed him into the bottom of the mothership&#39;s wing. As the bomber came in for an emergency landing with both fighters still attached, the slow landing speed of the TB-3 resulted in loss of lift for the I-Z which fell away, killing Korotkov.<sup id="_ref-stefan_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stefan" title="">[2]</a></sup> This was the most serious accident of the entire Zveno program despite the inherent complexity of carrying as many as five aircraft, performing mid-air launches and dockings, and damage to the motherships by propellers and landing gear of the fighters. Tests with various combinations of aircraft determined that top-mounted configurations presented the most difficulty in docking due to turbulent airflow coming off the mothership&#39;s wings.<sup id="_ref-shavrov_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shavrov" title="">[1]</a></sup> The problem of safe underwing attachment was solved with the appearance of the <a href="/wiki/Polikarpov_I-16" id="w">Polikarpov I-16</a> fighter with retractable landing gear. This permitted the use of the same rigid mounting frames as for the top-mounted aircraft.<sup id="_ref-stefan_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stefan" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The mothership and its fighters were unofficially nicknamed the <i>Vakhmistrov&#39;s Circus</i> (Цирк Вахмистрова).<sup id="_ref-ivanov_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ivanov" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1938, Vakhmistrov devised <b>Zveno-SPB</b> (SPB: Sostavnoi Pikiruyuschiy Bombardirovschik, Combined Dive Bomber) which consisted of a <a href="/wiki/Tupolev_TB-3" id="w">Tupolev TB-3-4AM-34FRN</a> mothership and two <a href="/wiki/Polikarpov_I-16" id="w">Polikarpov I-16 Type 5</a> fighters.

The three-aircraft Zveno-SPB had a total takeoff weight of 22000 kg (48,500 lb), a top speed of 268 km/h (145 knots, 165 mph),<sup id="_ref-shavrov_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shavrov" title="">[1]</a></sup> and a range of 2500 km (1,350 NM, 1,550 mi).<sup id="_ref-ivanov_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ivanov" title="">[3]</a></sup> The use of a mothership increased the range of the I-16s by 80%.<sup id="_ref-ivanov_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ivanov" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The SPB first flew in July 1937, with TB-3 piloted by Stefanovskiy, and I-16s piloted by Nikolayev and Taborovskiy.<sup id="_ref-shavrov_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shavrov" title="">[1]</a></sup> Following the successful test program in 1938, Zveno-SPB was accepted into service.

<p>Zveno-SPB saw limited but successful combat use during the <a href="/wiki/Great_Patriotic_War" id="w">Great Patriotic War</a>. In the opening stages, the Black Sea Fleet Air Force was tasked with destroying industrial targets in <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Nazi Germany</a>-allied <a href="/wiki/Romania" id="w">Romania</a>. The most important of these was the <a href="/wiki/King_Carol_I_Bridge" id="w">King Carol I Bridge</a> over <a href="/wiki/Danube" id="w">Danube</a> which carried the <a href="/wiki/Ploie%C5%9Fti" id="w">Ploieşti</a>-<a href="/wiki/Constan%C5%A3a" id="w">Constanţa</a> <a href="/wiki/Pipeline_transport" id="w">oil pipeline</a>. After several failed attempts to destroy the heavily protected bridge with conventional bombers, the task was given to the Zveno squadron. As a combat test, it was decided to first attack the Constanţa <a href="/wiki/Oil_depot" id="w">oil depot</a>. On <a href="/wiki/26_July" id="w">26 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, two Zveno-SPB aircraft performed a successful attack on the depot in broad daylight with no losses. The fighters disconnected 40 km (22 NM, 25 mi) from the target and returned to the home airfield under their own power.<sup id="_ref-ivanov_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ivanov" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first of the two bridge raids took place on <a href="/wiki/10_August" id="w">10 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>.

The main limiting factor was the lack of high-output <a href="/wiki/Mikulin_AM-34" id="w">Mikulin AM-34FRN</a> engines, as the other versions were not powerful enough to get the aircraft airborne.<sup id="_ref-ivanov_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ivanov" title="">[3]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/16_August" id="w">16 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nikolai_Gerasimovich_Kuznetsov" id="w">Admiral Kuznetsov</a> asked <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" id="w">Joseph Stalin</a> for additional AM-34FRN-engined TB-3s from the Air Force so they could be converted to Zveno-SPB carriers, but the request was denied as the Air Force had suffered heavy losses in the opening days of the war.<sup id="_ref-ivanov_r" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ivanov" title="">[3]</a></sup> In the meantime, the five aircraft continued flying operational sorties, destroying a <a href="/wiki/Dry_dock" id="w">dry dock</a> in Constanţa on <a href="/wiki/17_August" id="w">17 August</a> and a bridge across the <a href="/wiki/Dnieper_River" id="w">Dnieper River</a> on <a href="/wiki/28_August" id="w">28 August</a>, losing one I-16 in the process.<sup id="_ref-ivanov_s" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ivanov" title="">[3]</a></sup> During the repeat attack the next day, four Zveno-launched I-16s engaged several <a href="/wiki/Messerschmitt_Bf_109" id="w">Messerschmitt Bf 109s</a>, shooting down two.<sup id="_ref-ivanov_t" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ivanov" title="">[3]</a></sup> Despite the high success rate, Zveno missions ended by 1942 due to high vulnerability of the obsolete TB-3s and I-16s in the face of enemy air superiority.
