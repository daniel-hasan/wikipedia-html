<b>Fashion in fourteenth century Europe</b> was marked by the beginning of a period of experimentation with different forms of clothing.  Costume historian <a href="/wiki/James_Laver" id="w">James Laver</a> suggests that the mid-14th century marks the emergence of recognizable &#34;<a href="/wiki/Fashion" id="w">fashion</a>&#34; in clothing<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>, in which <a href="/wiki/Fernand_Braudel" id="w">Fernand Braudel</a> concurs.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The draped garments and straight seams of previous centuries were replaced by curved seams and the beginnings of <a href="/wiki/Tailor" id="w">tailoring</a>, which allowed clothing to more closely fit the human form. Also, the use of lacing and buttons allowed a snugger fit to clothing.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="General_trends" name="General_trends"></a><h2>General trends</h2>
<p>In the course of the century the length of male hem-lines progressively reduced, and by the end of the century it was fashionable for men to omit the long loose over-garment of previous centuries (whether called gown, kirtle, or other names)  altogether, putting the emphasis on a tailored top that fell little below the waist — a silhouette that is still reflected in men&#39;s costume today.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>From this century onwards Western fashion changes at a pace quite unknown to other civilizations, whether ancient or contemporary.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  In most other cultures only major political changes, such as the Muslim conquest of India, produced radical changes in clothing, and in China, Japan, and the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Ottoman Empire</a> fashion changed only slightly over periods of several centuries.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>  </p> 
<p>The French court during the minority and illness of <a href="/wiki/Charles_VI_of_France" id="w">Charles VI</a>, filled with ambitious princes with a taste for luxury, was a fountain of innovation in fashion.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Italian clothing was led by the <a href="/wiki/Visconti" id="w">Visconti</a> court in Milan.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Wool" id="w">Wool</a> was the most important material for clothing, due to its numerous favorable qualities, such as the ability to take dye and its being a good insulator.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>This century saw the beginnings of the <a href="/wiki/Little_Ice_Age" id="w">Little Ice Age</a>, and glazing was rare, even for the rich (most houses just had wooden shutters for the winter). Trade in textiles continued to grow throughout the century, and formed an important part of the economy for many areas from England to Italy. Clothes were very expensive, and employees, even high-ranking officials, were usually supplied with, typically, one outfit per year, as part of their remuneration. </p>

<a href="/wiki/Woodblock_printing" id="w">Woodblock printing</a> of cloth was known throughout the century, and was probably fairly common by the end; <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>
this is hard to assess as artists tended to avoid trying to depict patterned cloth due to the difficulty of doing so.   <a href="/wiki/Embroidery" id="w">Embroidery</a> in wool, and silk or gold thread for the rich, was used for decoration.  <a href="/wiki/Edward_III_of_England" id="w">Edward III</a> established an embroidery workshop in the <a href="/wiki/Tower_of_London" id="w">Tower of London</a>, who presumably produced the robes he and his Queen wore in 1351 of red velvet &#34;embroidered with clouds of silver and eagles of pearl and gold, under each alternate cloud an eagle of pearl, and under each of the other clouds a golden eagle, every eagle having in its beak a Garter with the motto <i><a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Garter" id="w">hony soyt qui mal y pense</a>&#34; embroidered thereon</i>.&#34; <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Although wool was used for the outer layers of clothing, <a href="/wiki/Linen" id="w">linen</a>, made from the <a href="/wiki/Flax" id="w">flax</a> plant, was generally used for clothing that was directly in contact with the skin, as it was not as coarse as wool and therefore much more pleasant.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  Unlike wool, linen could also be laundered and bleached in the sun.  <a href="/wiki/Cotton" id="w">Cotton</a>, imported raw from Egypt and elsewhere, was used for padding and quilting, and cloths such as <a href="/wiki/Buckram" id="w">buckram</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fustian" id="w">fustian</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Silk" id="w">Silk</a> was the finest fabric of all.  In Northern Europe, silk was an imported and very expensive luxury.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>  The well-off could afford woven <a href="/wiki/Brocade" id="w">brocades</a> from Italy or even further afield. Fashionable Italian silks of this period featured repeating patterns of <a href="/wiki/Roundel" id="w">roundels</a> and animals, deriving from <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Ottoman</a> silk-weaving centres in <a href="/wiki/Bursa" id="w">Bursa</a>, and ultimately from <a href="/wiki/Yuan_Dynasty" id="w">Yuan Dynasty</a> <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> via the <a href="/wiki/Silk_Road" id="w">Silk Road</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A fashion for <i>mi-parti</i> or <i>parti-coloured</i> garments made of two contrasting fabrics, one on each side, arose for men in mid-century<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>, and was especially popular at the English court.  Sometimes just the hose would be different colours on each leg.</p>
<p>Checkered and plaid fabrics were occasionally seen; a parti-colored cotehardie depicted on the St. Vincent altarpiece in Catalonia is reddish-brown on one side and plaid on the other, and remains of plaid and checkered wool fabrics dating to the 14th century have also been discovered in London.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Fur was mostly worn as an inside lining for warmth; inventories from Burgundian villages show that even there a fur-lined coat (rabbit, or the more expensive cat) was one of the commonest garments.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Vair" id="w">Vair</a>, the fur of the squirrel, white on the belly and grey on the back, was particularly popular through most of the century and can be seen in many <a href="/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript" id="w">illuminated manuscript</a> illustrations, where it is shown as a white and blue-grey softly striped or checkered pattern lining cloaks and other outer garments; the white belly fur with the merest edging of grey was called <a href="/wiki/Miniver" id="w">miniver</a>.<sup id="_ref-Med1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Med1" title="">[17]</a></sup>  A fashion in men&#39;s clothing for the dark furs <a href="/wiki/Sable" id="w">sable</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marten" id="w">marten</a> arose around 1380, and squirrel fur was thereafter relegated to formal ceremonial wear.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup><a href="/wiki/Ermine" id="w">Ermine</a> was worn by royalty, with tufts of black fur worked through the white for decorative effect, as in the Wilton Diptych above.</p>

The innermost layer of clothing were the <i>braies</i> or <a href="/wiki/Breeches#Etymology" id="w">breeches</a>, a loose undergarment, usually made of linen, which was held up by a belt.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>  Next came the shirt, which was generally also made of linen, and which was considered an undergarment, like the breeches.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Hose_(clothing)" id="w">Hose</a> or <a href="/wiki/Chausses" id="w">chausses</a> made out of wool were used to cover the legs, and were generally brightly colored,<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>, and often had leather soles, so that they did not have to be worn with shoes.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>  The shorter clothes of the second half of the century required these to be a single garment like modern tights, whereas otherwise they were two separate pieces covering the full length of each leg.  Hose were generally tied to the breech belt, or to the breeches themselves, or to a <a href="/wiki/Doublet_(clothing)" id="w">doublet</a>.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>A doublet was a buttoned jacket that was generally of hip length.  Similar garments were called <a href="/wiki/Cotehardie" id="w">cotehardie</a>, <i>pourpoint</i>, <i>jaqueta</i> or <i>jubón</i>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>,  These garments were worn over the shirt and the hose.</p>
<a id="Gown_and_coteheardie" name="Gown_and_coteheardie"></a><h3>Gown and coteheardie</h3>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Gown" id="w">gown</a>, tunic or <a href="/wiki/Kirtle" id="w">kirtle</a> was usually worn over the shirt or doublet.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup>  As with other outer garments, it was generally made of wool.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Over this, a man might also wear an over-kirtle, <a href="/wiki/Cloak" id="w">cloak</a>, or a hood.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Servants and working men wore their kirtles at various lengths, including as low as the knee or calf.  However the trend during the century was for hem-lengths to shorten for all classes. </p>
<p>However, in the second half of the century, courtiers are often shown, if they have the figure for it, wearing nothing over their closely tailored cotehardie.  A French <a href="/wiki/Chronicle" id="w">chronicle</a> records:&#34; Around that year (1350), men, in particular noblemen and their squires, took to wearing tunics so short and tight that they revealed what modesty bids us hide.  This was a most astonishing thing for the people&#34;<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> 
This fashion may well have derived from military clothing, where long loose gowns were naturally not worn in action.   At this period, the most dignified figures, like King Charles in the illustration, continue to wear long gowns - although as the Royal Chamberlain, de Vaudetar was himself a person of very high rank.  This abandonment of the gown to emphasise a tight top over the torso, with breeches or trousers below, was to become the distinctive feature of European men&#39;s fashion for centuries to come.  </p>

Over <a href="/wiki/Plate_armour" id="w">armour</a> he is shown wearing a short fitted <i>arming-coat</i> or <i>jupon</i> or <i>gipon</i>, the original of which was hung above and still survives. This has the quartered arms of England and France, with a rather similar effect to a parti-coloured jacket.  The &#34;charges&#34; (figures) of the arms are embroidered in gold on linen pieces, <a href="/wiki/Appliqu%C3%A9" id="w">appliquéd</a> onto coloured silk velvet fields.  It is vertically quilted, with wool stuffing and a silk satin lining.  This type of coat, originally worn out of sight under armour, was in fashion as an outer garment from about 1360 until early the next century.  Only this and a child&#39;s version (Chartres Cathedral) survive.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>  As an indication of the rapid spread of fashion between the courts of Europe, a manuscript chronicle illuminated in Hungary by 1360 shows very <a href="/wiki/Chronicon_Pictum" id="w">similar styles</a> to Edward&#39;s English version.  </p>
<p>Edward&#39;s son, King <a href="/wiki/Richard_II_of_England" id="w">Richard II of England</a>, led a court that, like many in Europe late in the century, was extremely refined and fashion-conscious.  He himself is credited with having invented the <a href="/wiki/Handkerchief" id="w">handkerchief</a>; &#34;little pieces [of cloth] for the lord King to wipe and clean his nose,&#34; appear in the Household Rolls (accounts), which is the first documentation of their use.  He distributed jewelled <a href="/wiki/Livery" id="w">livery</a> badges with his personal emblem of the white <a href="/wiki/Hart" id="w">hart</a> (deer) to his friends, like the one he himself wears in the <a href="/wiki/Wilton_Diptych" id="w">Wilton Diptych</a> (above).  In the miniature (left) of Chaucer reading to his court both men and women wear very high collars and quantities of jewellery.  The King (standing to the left of Chaucer - his face has been defaced) wears a patterned gold-coloured costume with matching hat.  Most of the men wear <a href="/wiki/Chaperon_(headgear)" id="w">chaperon</a> hats, and the women have their hair elaborately dressed.  Male courtiers enjoyed wearing fancy-dress for festivities; the disastrous <a href="/wiki/Charles_VI_of_France#The Bal des Ardents" id="w">Bal des Ardents</a> in 1393 in Paris is the most famous example.   Men as well as women wore decorated and jewelled clothes; for the entry of the <a href="/wiki/Isabeau_of_Bavaria" id="w">Queen of France</a> into Paris in 1389, the <a href="/wiki/Philip_II%2C_Duke_of_Burgundy" id="w">Duke of Burgundy</a> wore a velevet doublet embroidered with forty sheep and forty swans, each with a pearl bell round its neck.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>A new garment, the <a href="/wiki/Houppelande" id="w">Houppelande</a>, appeared around 1380 and was to remain fashionable well into the next century.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>   It was essentially a gown with fullness falling from the shoulders, very full trailing sleeves, and the high collar favored at the English court.  The extravagance of the sleeves was criticised by moralists. </p>

During this century, the <a href="/wiki/Chaperon_(headgear)" id="w">chaperon</a> made a transformation from being a utilitarian hood with a small cape to becoming a complicated and fashionable hat worn by the wealthy in town settings.  This came when they began to be worn with the opening for the face placed instead on the top of the head.</p>
<p>Belts were worn at the waist early in the period, and very low on the hips with the tightly fitted fashions of the later half of the century.  Belt pouches or purses were used, and long daggers, usually hanging diagonally to the front.</p>
<p>In armour, the century saw increases in the amount of <a href="/wiki/Plate_armour" id="w">plate armour</a> worn, and by the end of the century the full suit had been developed, although mixtures of <a href="/wiki/Chain_mail" id="w">chain mail</a> and plate remained more common.  The visored <a href="/wiki/Bascinet" id="w">bascinet</a> helmet was a new development in this century.

<a id="Underwear" name="Underwear"></a><h3>Underwear</h3>

<p>The innermost layer of a woman&#39;s clothing was a linen or woolen <a href="/wiki/Chemise" id="w">chemise or smock</a>, although there is some mention of a &#34;breast girdle&#34; or &#34;breast band&#34; which may have been the precursor of a modern <a href="/wiki/Brassiere" id="w">bra</a>.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Women also wore hose or stockings, although women&#39;s hose generally only reached to the knee. <sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>All classes and both sexes are usually shown sleeping naked.</p>
<a id="Gowns_and_outerwear" name="Gowns_and_outerwear"></a><h3>Gowns and outerwear</h3>

<p>Over the chemise, women wore a loose or fitted gown called a <i>cotte</i> or <a href="/wiki/Kirtle" id="w">kirtle</a>, usually ankle or floor-length, and with <a href="/wiki/Train_(clothing)" id="w">trains</a> for formal occasions.  Fitted kirtles had full skirts made by adding triangular gores to widen the hem without adding bulk at the waist.  Kirtles had long sleeves.</p>
<p>Various sorts of overgowns were worn over the kirtle, and are called by different names by costume historians. When fitted, this garment is often called a <a href="/wiki/Cotehardie" id="w">cotehardie</a> and might have hanging sleeves.  Over time the hanging part of the sleeve became longer and narrower until it was the merest streamer, called a <i>tippet</i>.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sleeveless overgowns or <a href="/wiki/Tabard" id="w">tabards</a> derive from the <a href="/wiki/Cyclas" id="w">cyclas</a>, an unfitted rectangle of cloth with an opening for the head that was worn in the <a href="/wiki/13th_century" id="w">13th century</a>.  By the early 14th century, the sides began to be sewn together, creating a sleeveless overgown or surcoat.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Outdoors, women wore cloaks or mantles, often lined in fur.  The Houppelande was also adopted by women late in the century.  Women invariably wore their Houppelandes floor-length.</p>
<a id="Headdresses" name="Headdresses"></a><h3>Headdresses</h3>

<a id="Northern_and_western_Europe" name="Northern_and_western_Europe"></a><h4>Northern and western Europe</h4>
<p>Married women in Northern and Western Europe wore some type of headcovering.  The <i>barbet</i> was a band of linen that passed under the chin and was pinned on top of the head; it descended from the earlier <a href="/wiki/Wimple" id="w">wimple</a> (in French, <i>barbe</i>), which was now worn only by older women, widows, and <a href="/wiki/Nun" id="w">nuns</a>.  The barbet was worn with a linen fillet or headband, or with a linen cap called a coif, with or without a <i>couvrechef</i> (<a href="/wiki/Kerchief" id="w">kerchief</a>) or <a href="/wiki/Veil#History" id="w">veil</a> overall. <sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> It passed out of fashion by mid-century.</p>
<p><div style="wigth:100px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:100px-JoanofBourbon.jpg" title="A [[crespine]]"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100px-JoanofBourbon.jpg" alt="A [[crespine]]" title="A [[crespine]]" class="location-left type-thumb" width="100px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">A <a href="/wiki/Crespine" id="w">crespine</a></div></div>

The barbet and fillet or barbet and veil could also be worn over the <i>crespine</i>, a thick hairnet or <a href="/wiki/Snood_(headgear)" id="w">snood</a>.  Overtime, the crespine evolved into a mesh of jeweler&#39;s work that confined the hair on the sides of the head, and even later, at the back.  This metal crespine was also called a <i>caul</i>, and remained stylish long after the barbet had fallen out of fashion.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Italy" name="Italy"></a><h4>Italy</h4>
<p>Uncovered hair was acceptable for women in the Italian states.  Many women twisted their long hair with cords or ribbons and wrapped the twists around their heads, often without any cap or veil.  Hair was also worn braided.  Older women and widows wore a veil and wimple, and a simple knotted kerchief was worn while working. In the image at right, one woman wears a red hood draped over her twisted and bound hair.</p>
