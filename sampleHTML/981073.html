<p><b><i>Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia</i></b> (<b>Olga Nikolaevna Romanova</b>) (in <a href="/wiki/Russian_language" id="w">Russian</a> Великая Княжна Ольга Николаевна; {{OldStyleDate}} – <a href="/wiki/July_17" id="w">July 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a>) was the eldest daughter of the last <a href="/wiki/Autocracy" id="w">autocratic</a> ruler of the Russian Empire, <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia" id="w">Emperor Nicholas II</a>, and of <a href="/wiki/Alexandra_Fyodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse)" id="w">Empress Alexandra of Russia</a>.</p>
<p>During her lifetime, Olga&#39;s future marriage offered great speculation within Russia. Matches were rumored with <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duke_Dmitri_Pavlovich_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carol_II_of_Romania" id="w">Crown Prince Carol of Romania</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Edward, Prince of Wales</a>, eldest son of Britain&#39;s <a href="/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George V</a>, and with <a href="/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Yugoslavia" id="w">Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia</a>. Olga herself wanted to marry a Russian and remain in her home country. During <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, Olga nursed wounded soldiers in a military hospital until her own nerves gave out and, thereafter, oversaw administrative duties at the hospital.</p>
<p>Olga&#39;s murder following the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917" id="w">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> resulted in her <a href="/wiki/Canonization" id="w">canonization</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Passion_bearer" id="w">passion bearer</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church" id="w">Russian Orthodox Church</a>. She was an elder sister of the famous <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_Nikolaevna_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia</a>, who was widely rumored to have survived the assassination of the Imperial Family. In later years, when dozens of people made claims to be surviving members of the imperial family, a woman named <a href="/wiki/Marga_Boodts" id="w">Marga Boodts</a> claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga. Few people took Boodts&#39; claim seriously.</p>

Besides Anastasia, Olga&#39;s other siblings were <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Tatiana_Nikolaevna_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duchesses Tatiana</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Maria_Nikolaevna_of_Russia" id="w">Maria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tsarevich_Alexei_of_Russia" id="w">Tsarevich Alexei of Russia</a>. Olga&#39;s Russian title (<i>Velikaya Knyazhna</i> Великая Княжна) is most precisely translated as &#34;Grand Princess&#34;, meaning that Olga, as an &#34;imperial highness&#34; was higher in rank than other princesses in Europe who were &#34;royal highnesses&#34;. However, &#34;Grand Duchess&#34; is the usual English translation.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Olga&#39;s friends and family generally called her simply Olga Nikolaevna or nicknamed her &#34;Olishka&#34; or &#34;Olya&#34;. Among her godparents was her great-grandmother, <a href="/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Victoria</a>. Olga was most often paired with her sister Tatiana. The two girls shared a room, dressed alike, and were known as &#34;The Big Pair&#34;.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>From her earliest years she was known for her compassionate heart and desire to help others, but also for her temper, blunt honesty and moodiness. As a small child, she once lost patience while posing for a portrait painter and told the man, &#34;You are a very ugly man and I don&#39;t like you one bit!&#34;<sup id="_ref-Eagar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eagar" title="">[3]</a></sup> The Tsar&#39;s children were raised as simply as possible, sleeping on hard camp cots unless they were ill, taking cold baths every morning.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Servants called Olga and her siblings by their first names and <a href="/wiki/Patronymic" id="w">patronyms</a> rather than by their royal titles.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> However, Olga&#39;s governess and tutors also noted some of the autocratic impulses of the daughter of the Tsar of All the Russias, one of the wealthiest men in the world. On a visit to a museum where state carriages were on display, Olga once ordered one of the servants to prepare the largest and most beautiful carriage for her daily drive. Her wishes were not honored, much to the relief of her governess, <a href="/wiki/Margaretta_Eagar" id="w">Margaret Eagar</a>. She also felt the rights of eldest children should be protected. When she was told the Biblical story of <a href="/wiki/Joseph_(Hebrew_Bible)" id="w">Joseph</a> and his coat of many colors, she sympathized with the eldest brothers rather than Joseph. She also sympathized with Goliath rather than David in the Biblical story of <a href="/wiki/David_and_Goliath" id="w">David and Goliath</a>.<sup id="_ref-Eagar_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eagar" title="">[3]</a></sup> When her French tutor, Pierre Gilliard, was teaching her the formation of French verbs and the use of auxiliaries, ten-year-old Olga responded, &#34;I see, monsieur. The auxiliaries are the servants of the verbs. It&#39;s only poor &#39;avoir&#39; which has to shift for itself.&#39;&#34;<sup id="_ref-Gilliard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilliard" title="">[6]</a></sup>
Olga loved to read and, unlike her four siblings, enjoyed school work.
&#34;The eldest, Olga Nicolaevna, possessed a remarkably quick brain,&#34; recalled her French tutor, <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Gilliard" id="w">Pierre Gilliard</a>. &#34;She had good reasoning powers as well as initiative, a very independent manner, and a gift for swift and entertaining repartee.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Gilliard_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilliard" title="">[6]</a></sup> She enjoyed reading about <a href="/wiki/Politics" id="w">politics</a> and read <a href="/wiki/Newspaper" id="w">newspapers</a>. Olga also reportedly enjoyed choosing from her mother&#39;s book selection. When she was caught taking a book before her mother read it, she would tell Alexandra that she must wait to read the novel until Olga had determined whether it was an appropriate book for her to read.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Margaret Eagar also noted that Olga was bright but said she had little experience with the world because of her sheltered life. She and her sisters had little understanding of money because they had not had an opportunity to shop in stores or to see money exchange hands. Young Olga once thought that a hat maker who came to the palace had given her a new hat as a present. Olga was once frightened when she witnessed a policeman arresting someone on the street. She thought the policeman would come to arrest her because she had behaved badly for Miss Eagar. When reading a history lesson, she remarked that she was glad she lived in current times, when people were good and not as evil as they had been in the past. When she was eight, in November 1903, Olga learned about death first hand when her first cousin, <a href="/wiki/Princess_Elisabeth_of_Hesse" id="w">Princess Elisabeth of Hesse</a>, died of <a href="/wiki/Typhoid_fever" id="w">typhoid fever</a> while on a visit to the Romanovs at their Polish estate. &#34;My children talked much of cousin Ella and how God had taken her spirit, and they understood that later God would take her body also to heaven,&#34; wrote Eagar. &#34;On Christmas morning when Olga awoke, she exclaimed at once, &#39;Did God send for cousin Ella&#39;s body in the night?&#39; I felt startled at such a question on Christmas morning, but answered, &#39;Oh, no, dear, not yet.&#39; She was greatly disappointed, and said, &#39;I thought He would have sent for her to keep Christmas with Him.&#39;&#34;<sup id="_ref-Eagar_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eagar" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

</p>
<p>&#34;Her chief characteristics&#160;... were a strong will and a singularly straightforward habit of thought and action,&#34; wrote her mother&#39;s friend <a href="/wiki/Anna_Vyrubova" id="w">Anna Vyrubova</a>, who recalled Olga&#39;s hot temper and her struggles to keep it under control. &#34;Admirable qualities in a woman, these same characteristics are often trying in childhood, and Olga as a little girl sometimes showed herself willful and even disobedient.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Vyrubova_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vyrubova" title="">[8]</a></sup> Olga idolized her father and wore a necklace with an icon of St. Nicholas on her chest.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> She, like her siblings, enjoyed games of tennis and swimming with her father during their summer holidays and often confided in him when she went with him on long walks.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Though she also loved Alexandra, her relationship with her mother was somewhat strained during her adolescence and early adulthood. &#34;Olga is always most unamiable about every proposition, though may end by doing what I wish,&#34; wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on <a href="/wiki/March_13" id="w">March 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1916" id="w">1916</a>. &#34;And when I am severe — sulks me.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Bokhanov124_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bokhanov124" title="">[11]</a></sup> In another letter to Nicholas during World War I, Alexandra complained that Olga&#39;s grumpiness, bad humor and general reluctance to make an official visit to the hospital where she usually worked as a Red Cross nurse made things difficult.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Olga also occasionally found her mother&#39;s attitude trying. Parlormaid Elizaveta Nikolaevna Ersberg told her niece that the Tsar paid closer attention to the children than Alexandra did and Alexandra often was ill with a migraine or quarreled with the servants.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> In 1913, Olga complained in a letter to her grandmother, <a href="/wiki/Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)" id="w">Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna</a> about her mother&#39;s invalidism. &#34;As usual her heart isn&#39;t well,&#34; Olga wrote. &#34;It&#39;s all so unpleasant.&#34;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Marie_of_Edinburgh" id="w">Queen Marie of Romania</a>, who met Olga and her sisters when they visited Romania on a state trip in 1914, commented in her memoirs that the girls were natural and confided in her when Alexandra wasn&#39;t present, but when she appeared &#34;they always seemed to be watching her every expression so as to be sure to act according to her desires.&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>As an adolescent, Olga received frequent reminders from her mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses. On <a href="/wiki/January_11" id="w">January 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1909" id="w">1909</a>, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse &#34;nervous&#34; when she was tired and not feeling well.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Olga responded on <a href="/wiki/January_12" id="w">January 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1909" id="w">1909</a> that she would try to do better but it wasn&#39;t easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes had good reason to be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/January_24" id="w">January 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1909" id="w">1909</a>, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname &#34;Unmounted Cossack&#34;, again: &#34;You are growing very big — don&#39;t be so wild and kick about and show your legs, it is not pretty. I never did so when your age or when I was smaller and younger even.&#34;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Three years later, Alexandra blamed sixteen-year-old Olga, who was sitting beside her seven-year-old brother, for failing to control the misbehaving Tsarevich Alexei during a family dinner. The spoiled Alexei teased others at the table, refused to sit up in his chair, wouldn&#39;t eat his food and licked his plate. The Tsarina&#39;s expectation was unreasonable, said <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duke_Konstantin_Konstantinovich_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia</a>, a distant cousin of the imperial family. &#34;Olga cannot deal with him,&#34; he wrote in his diary on <a href="/wiki/March_18" id="w">March 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1912" id="w">1912</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Court official A.

Despite his occasional misbehavior, Olga, like all her family, doted on the long-awaited heir Tsarevich Alexei, or &#34;Baby&#34;. The little boy suffered frequent attacks of <a href="/wiki/Hemophilia" id="w">hemophilia</a> and nearly died several times. Like their mother, Olga and her three sisters were also potentially carriers of the hemophilia gene. Olga&#39;s younger sister Maria reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a>, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the <a href="/wiki/Hemophilia" id="w">hemophilia</a> gene like their mother, who inherited the trait from her maternal grandmother <a href="/wiki/Queen_Victoria" id="w">Queen Victoria</a>.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not haemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Olga&#39;s mother relied on the counsel of <a href="/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin" id="w">Grigori Rasputin</a>, a Russian peasant and wandering <i><a href="/wiki/Starets" id="w">starets</a></i> or &#34;holy man&#34;, and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions. Olga and her siblings were also taught to view Rasputin as &#34;Our Friend&#34; and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, Olga&#39;s aunt <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a> was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Olga, her sisters and brother, were all wearing their long white nightgowns. &#34;All the children seemed to like him,&#34; Olga Alexandrovna recalled. &#34;They were completely at ease with him.&#34;<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, one of the girls&#39; governesses, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, was horrified in 1910 that Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns and wanted him barred. Although Rasputin&#39;s contacts with the children were completely innocent, Nicholas asked Rasputin to avoid going to the nurseries in the future to avoid further scandal. Alexandra eventually had the governess fired. Tyutcheva took her story to other members of the family.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Nicholas&#39;s sister <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Xenia_Alexandrovna_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia</a> was horrified by Tyutcheva&#39;s story. She wrote on <a href="/wiki/March_15" id="w">March 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1910" id="w">1910</a> that she couldn&#39;t understand:</p>
<dl><dd>&#34;...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he&#39;s only a <a href="/wiki/Khlysts" id="w">&#39;&#39;khlyst&#39;&#39;</a>!) He&#39;s always there, goes into the nursery, visits Olga and Tatiana while they are getting ready for bed, sits there talking to them and <i>caressing</i> them. They are careful to hide him from Sofia Ivanovna, and the children don&#39;t dare talk to her about him. It&#39;s all quite unbelievable and beyond understanding.&#34;<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, another nurse for the royal children, was at first a devotee of Rasputin, but later was disillusioned by him. She claimed that she was raped by Rasputin in the spring of 1910.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> The Empress refused to believe her and said that everything Rasputin did was holy. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova&#39;s claim had been immediately investigated, but &#34;they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard.&#34; Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four Grand Duchesses.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Rasputin had released ardent, though by all accounts completely innocent in nature, letters written by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses to him. They circulated throughout society, fueling rumors. Pornographic cartoons circulated depicting Rasputin having relations with the empress, with her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra&#39;s displeasure, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> Despite the rumors, the imperial family&#39;s association with Rasputin continued until Rasputin was murdered on <a href="/wiki/December_17" id="w">December 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1916" id="w">1916</a>. &#34;Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy &#39;courses&#39; for their age and their souls have much developed,&#34; Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on <a href="/wiki/December_6" id="w">December 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1916" id="w">1916</a>, a few weeks before Rasputin was killed.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> However, as she grew older, Olga was less inclined to see Rasputin as her friend and was more aware of how his friendship with her parents affected the stability of her country. Olga wrote in her diary the day after the murder that she suspected <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duke_Dmitri_Pavlovich_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia</a>, her first cousin once removed and the man she had at one time been expected to marry, was the murderer of &#34;Father Grigory.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Dmitri and <a href="/wiki/Felix_Yussupov" id="w">Felix Yussupov</a>, the husband of her first cousin <a href="/wiki/Princess_Irina_of_Russia" id="w">Princess Irina of Russia</a>, were among the murderers. In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared &#34;cold and visibly terribly upset&#34; by Rasputin&#39;s death and sat &#34;huddled up closely together&#34; on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov reported that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on the reverse side by Olga, her sisters and mother. However, Olga was the only member of the family who did not attend Rasputin&#39;s funeral, according to the diary of her first cousin once removed <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duke_Andrei_Vladimirovich_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia</a>.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> According to the memoirs of <a href="/wiki/Valentina_Ivanovna_Chebotareva" id="w">Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva</a>, a woman who nursed with Olga during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, Olga said in February 1917, about a month after the murder, that while it might have been necessary for Rasputin to be killed, it should never have been done &#34;so terribly.&#34; She was ashamed that the murderers were her relatives.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Inspired by her religious upbringing, Olga took control of a portion of her sizable fortune when she was twenty and began to respond independently to requests for charity. One day when she was out for a drive she saw a young child using crutches. She asked about the child and learned that the youngster&#39;s parents were too poor to afford treatment. Olga set aside an allowance to cover the child&#39;s medical bills.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> A court official, Alexander Mossolov, recalled that Olga&#39;s character was &#34;even, good, with an almost angelic kindness&#34; by the time she was a young woman.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

<p>Olga was a chestnut-blonde with bright blue eyes, a broad face and a turned up nose.

<p>Olga and her younger sisters were surrounded by young men assigned to guard them at the palace and on the imperial yacht Standard and were used to mingling with them and sharing holiday fun during their annual summer cruises. When Olga was fifteen, a group of officers aboard the imperial yacht gave her a portrait of <a href="/wiki/Michelangelo" id="w">Michelangelo&#39;s</a> nude <a href="/wiki/David_(Michelangelo)" id="w">David</a>, cut out from a newspaper, as a present for her <a href="/wiki/Name_day" id="w">name day</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_11" id="w">July 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1911" id="w">1911</a>. &#34;Olga laughed at it long and hard,&#34; her indignant fourteen-year-old sister Tatiana wrote to her aunt <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Olga_Alexandrovna_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a>. &#34;And not one of the officers wishes to confess that he has done it.

<p>At the same time the teenage Olga was enjoying her innocent flirtations, society was buzzing about her future marriage. In November 1911 a full dress ball was held at <a href="/wiki/Livadia_Palace" id="w">Livadia</a> to celebrate her sixteenth birthday and her entry into society. Her hair was put up for the first time and her first ballgown was pink. Her parents gave her a diamond ring and a diamond and pearl necklace as a birthday present and symbol that she had become a young woman.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> A. Bogdanova, the wife of a general and hostess of a monarchist salon, wrote in her diary the following summer, on <a href="/wiki/June_7" id="w">June 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1912" id="w">1912</a>, that Olga had been betrothed the previous night to <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duke_Dmitri_Pavlovich_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia</a>, her first cousin once removed. In his book <i>The Rasputin File</i>, Edvard Radzinsky speculates that the betrothal was broken off due to Dmitri&#39;s dislike for <a href="/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin" id="w">Grigori Rasputin</a>, his association with <a href="/wiki/Felix_Yussupov" id="w">Felix Yussupov</a> and rumors that Dmitri was bisexual.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> However, no other sources mention an official betrothal to Dmitri Pavlovich. Before <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, there was also some discussion of a marriage between Olga and <a href="/wiki/Carol_II_of_Romania" id="w">Prince Carol of Romania</a>, but Olga did not like Carol. During a visit to Romania in the spring of 1914, she struggled to make small talk with the Romanian crown prince.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> Carol&#39;s mother, <a href="/wiki/Queen_Marie_of_Romania" id="w">Queen Marie of Romania</a>, was unimpressed with Olga as well, finding her manners too brusque and her broad, high cheek-boned face &#34;not pretty.&#34;<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> The plans were, in any event, put on hold upon the outbreak of war in 1914. <a href="/wiki/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Prince Edward</a>, eldest son of England&#39;s <a href="/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George V</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Yugoslavia" id="w">Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia</a> were also discussed as potential suitors, though none were considered seriously. Olga told Gilliard that she wanted to marry a Russian and remain in her own country. She said her parents would not force her marry anyone she could not like.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>While society was discussing matches with princes, Olga fell in love with a succession of officers. In late 1913, Olga fell in love with Pavel Voronov, a junior officer on the imperial yacht <i>Standart</i>, but such a relationship would have been impossible due to their differing ranks. Voronov was engaged a few months later to one of the ladies in waiting. &#34;God grant him good fortune, my beloved,&#34; a saddened Olga wrote on his wedding day, &#34;It&#39;s sad, distressing.&#34;<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> Later, in her diaries of 1915 and 1916, Olga frequently mentioned a man named Mitya with great affection.<sup id="_ref-Bokhanov124_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bokhanov124" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>According to the diary of Valentina Chebotareva, a woman who nursed with Olga during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, Olga&#39;s &#34;golden Mitya&#34; was Dmitri Chakh-Bagov, a wounded soldier she cared for when she was a <a href="/wiki/Red_Cross" id="w">Red Cross</a> nurse. Chebotareva wrote that Olga&#39;s love for him was &#34;pure, naive, without hope&#34; and that she tried to avoid revealing her feelings to the other nurses. She talked to him regularly on the telephone, was depressed when he left the hospital, and jumped about exuberantly when she received a message from him. Dmitri Chakh-Bagov adored Olga and talked of killing Rasputin for her if she only gave the word, because it was the duty of an officer to protect the imperial family even against their will. However, he also reportedly showed other officers the letters Olga had written to him when he was drunk.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> Another young man, Volodia Volkomski, appeared to have affection for her as well. &#34;(He) always has a smile or two for her,&#34; wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on <a href="/wiki/December_16" id="w">December 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1916" id="w">1916</a>.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other suitors within the family were suggested, among them Olga&#39;s first cousin once removed <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duke_Boris_Vladimirovich_of_Russia" id="w">Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia</a>. Alexandra refused to entertain the idea of her innocent daughter marrying the jaded, much older Boris Vladimirovich. &#34;An inexperienced girl would suffer terribly, to have her husband 4, or 5th hand or more,&#34; Alexandra wrote.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> She was also aware that Olga&#39;s heart lay elsewhere.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>

Olga experienced her first brush with violence at age fifteen, when she witnessed the assassination of the government minister <a href="/wiki/Pyotr_Stolypin" id="w">Pyotr Stolypin</a> during a performance at the Kiev Opera House. &#34;Olga and Tatiana had followed me back to the box and saw everything that happened,&#34; Tsar Nicholas II wrote to his mother, <a href="/wiki/Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)" id="w">Dowager Empress Maria</a>, on <a href="/wiki/September_10" id="w">September 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1911" id="w">1911</a>. &#34;...It had made a great impression on Tatiana, who cried a lot, and they both slept badly.&#34;<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> Three years later, she saw gunshot wounds close up when she trained to become a <a href="/wiki/Red_Cross" id="w">Red Cross</a> nurse. Olga, her sister Tatiana, and her mother Tsarina Alexandra treated wounded soldiers at a hospital on the grounds of <a href="/wiki/Tsarskoye_Selo" id="w">Tsarskoye Selo</a>.</p>
<p>Olga was disdainful of her cousin <a href="/wiki/Princess_Irina_of_Russia" id="w">Princess Irina of Russia&#39;s</a> husband <a href="/wiki/Felix_Yussupov" id="w">Felix Yussupov</a>, the man who eventually murdered Rasputin in December 1916. Yussupov had taken advantage of a law permitting men who were only sons to avoid military service. He was in civilian dress at a time when many of the Romanov men and the wounded soldiers Olga cared for were fighting. &#34;Felix is a &#39;downright civilian&#39;, dressed all in brown, walked to and fro about the room, searching in some bookcases with magazines and virtually doing nothing; an utterly unpleasant impression he makes — a man idling in such times,&#34; Olga wrote to her father, Tsar Nicholas, on <a href="/wiki/March_5" id="w">March 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1915" id="w">1915</a> after paying a visit to the Yussupovs.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> She was also strongly patriotic. In July 1915, while discussing the wedding of an acquaintance with fellow nurses, Olga said she understood why the ancestry of the groom&#39;s German grandmother was being kept hidden. &#34;Of course he has to conceal it,&#34; she burst out. &#34;I quite understand him, she may perhaps be a real bloodthirsty German.&#34;<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> Olga&#39;s unthinking comments hurt her mother, who had been born in Germany, reported fellow nurse Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup>
Nursing during the war provided Olga and her sister Tatiana with exposure to experiences they had not previously had. The girls enjoyed talking with fellow nurses at the hospital, women they would never have met if not for the war, and knew the names of their children and their family stories.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> On one occasion, when a lady in waiting who usually picked up the girls from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, the two girls decided to go shopping in a store when they had a break. They ordered the carriage driver to stop in a shopping district and went into a store where they were not recognized because of their nursing uniforms. However, they discovered that they didn&#39;t know how to buy anything because they had never used money. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to go about purchasing an item from a store.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>Olga cared for and pitied the soldiers she helped to treat. However, the stress of caring for wounded, dying men eventually also took its toll on the sensitive, moody Olga&#39;s nerves. Her sister Maria reported in a letter that Olga broke three panes of a window on a &#34;caprice&#34; with her umbrella on <a href="/wiki/September_5" id="w">September 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1915" id="w">1915</a>.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> On another occasion, she destroyed items in a cloakroom when she was &#34;in a rage,&#34; according to the memoirs of Valentina Chebotareva. On <a href="/wiki/October_19" id="w">October 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1915" id="w">1915</a> she was assigned office work at the hospital because she was no longer able to bear the gore of the operating theater.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> She was given <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" id="w">arsenic</a> injections in October 1915, at the time considered a treatment for depression or nervous disorders.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Sophie_Buxhoeveden" id="w">Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden</a>, one of her mother&#39;s ladies in waiting, recalled that Olga had to give up nursing and instead only supervised the hospital wards because she had &#34;overtired herself&#34; and became &#34;nervous and anaemic.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Buxhoeveden_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Buxhoeveden" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the accounts of courtiers, Olga knew the financial and political state of the country during the war and revolution. She reportedly also knew how much the Russian people disliked her mother and father. &#34;She was by nature a thinker,&#34; remembered <a href="/wiki/Gleb_Botkin" id="w">Gleb Botkin</a>, the son of the family&#39;s physician, <a href="/wiki/Eugene_Botkin" id="w">Yevgeny Botkin</a>, &#34;and as it later seemed to me, understood the general situation better than any member of her family, including even her parents. At least I had the impression that she had little illusions in regard to what the future held in store for them, and in consequence was often sad and worried.&#34;<sup id="_ref-king_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-king" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Captivity_and_death" name="Captivity_and_death"></a><h2>Captivity and death</h2>
<p>The family was arrested during the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917" id="w">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> and was imprisoned first at their home in Tsarskoye Selo and later at private residences in <a href="/wiki/Tobolsk" id="w">Tobolsk</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yekaterinburg" id="w">Yekaterinburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Siberia" id="w">Siberia</a>. &#34;Darling, you must know how awful it all is,&#34; Olga wrote in a letter to a friend from Tobolsk.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>Olga tried to draw comfort from her faith and her proximity to her family. To her &#34;beloved mama&#34;, with whom she had sometimes had a difficult relationship, she wrote a poem in April 1917, while the family was still imprisoned at Tsarskoye Selo: &#34;You are filled with anguish for the sufferings of others. And no one&#39;s grief has ever passed you by. You are relentless, only towards yourself, forever cold and pitiless. But if only you could look upon your own sadness from a distance, just once with a loving soul — Oh, how you would pity yourself, how sadly you would weep.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Olga_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Olga" title="">[64]</a></sup> In another letter from Tobolsk, Olga wrote: &#34;Father asks to&#160;... remember that the evil which is now in the world will become yet more powerful, and that it is not evil which conquers evil, but only love ...&#34;<sup id="_ref-Christopher_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Christopher" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>A poem copied into one of her notebooks prays for patience and the ability to forgive her enemies:</p>
<dl><dd>&#34;Send us, Lord, the patience, in this year of stormy, gloom-filled days, to suffer popular oppression, and the tortures of our hangmen. Give us strength, oh Lord of justice, Our neighbor&#39;s evil to forgive, And the Cross so heavy and bloody, with Your humility to meet, In days when enemies rob us, To bear the shame and humiliation, Christ our Savior, help us. Ruler of the world, God of the universe, Bless us with prayer and give our humble soul rest in this unbearable, dreadful hour. At the threshold of the grave, breathe into the lips of Your slaves inhuman strength — to pray meekly for our enemies.&#34;<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p>There was one report that her father gave Olga a small <a href="/wiki/Revolver" id="w">revolver</a>, which she concealed in a boot while in captivity at Tsarskoe Selo and at Tobolsk. Colonel Eugene Kobylynsky, their sympathetic jailer, pleaded with the grand duchess to surrender her revolver before she, her sisters, and brother were transferred to Yekaterinburg. Olga reluctantly gave up her gun and was left unarmed.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<p>The family had been briefly separated in April 1918 when the Bolsheviks moved Nicholas, Alexandra, and Maria to Yekaterinburg. Alexei and the three other young women remained behind because Alexei had suffered another attack of hemophilia. The Empress chose Maria to accompany her because &#34;Olga&#39;s spirits were too low&#34; and level-headed Tatiana was needed to take care of Alexei.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> In May 1918 the remaining children and servants boarded the ship <i>Rus</i> that ferried them from Tobolsk to Yekaterinburg. Aboard ship, Olga was distressed when she saw one of the guards slip from a ladder and injure his foot. She ran to the man and explained that she had been a nurse during the war and wanted to look at his foot. He refused her offer of treatment. All through the afternoon, Olga fretted over the guard, whom she called &#34;her poor fellow.&#34;<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> At Tobolsk Olga and her sisters had sewed jewels into their clothing in hopes of hiding them from the Bolsheviks. That night the guards forbade the young women to lock their bedroom doors. Olga, Tatiana, and Anastasia remained fully clothed. Guards looking for the hidden jewels harassed them, having been tipped off by one or more servants in the group. Olga&#39;s English tutor, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Sydney_Gibbes" id="w">Sydney Gibbes</a>, was haunted to the end of his life by the memory of the grand duchesses&#39; screams and his inability to protect them.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup>

On <a href="/wiki/July_14" id="w">July 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a>, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family and reported that Olga and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> Olga was twenty-two when she was killed with her family at the <a href="/wiki/Ipatiev_House" id="w">Ipatiev House</a> in <a href="/wiki/Ekaterinburg" id="w">Ekaterinburg</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_17" id="w">July 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a>.

<p>Several people claimed to be surviving members of the Romanov family following the assassinations. A woman named Marga Boodts claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga.

<p>Remains later identified through DNA testing as the Romanovs and their servants were discovered in the woods outside Yekaterinburg in 1991.

On <a href="/wiki/August_23" id="w">August 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky&#39;s memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones are from a boy who was roughly between the ages of ten and thirteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three years old. Anastasia was seventeen years, one month old at the time of the assassination, while her sister Maria was nineteen years, one month old and her brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday. Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old at the time of the assassination. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found &#34;shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber.&#34; The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes. Tests are still being conducted on the remains to determine whether they are the remains of the two missing Romanov children.<sup id="_ref-_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-" title="">[77]</a></sup> </p>
