The <b>Kingdom of Tonga</b> (<a href="/wiki/Tongan_language" id="w">Tongan</a> for <i>&#34;south&#34;</i>) is the only <a href="/wiki/Archipelago" id="w">archipelago</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a> never to have been formally colonized. It lies south of <a href="/wiki/Samoa" id="w">Samoa</a> and east of <a href="/wiki/Fiji" id="w">Fiji</a> and is about a third of the way between <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" id="w">Hawaii</a>.</p>
<p>The islands are also known as the <b>Friendly Islands</b> because of the friendly reception <a href="/wiki/Captain_Cook" id="w">Captain Cook</a> received. He happened to arrive at the time of <i>{{okina}}inasi</i> festival, the yearly donation of the first fruits to the <a href="/wiki/Tu%26%2339%3Bi_Tonga" id="w">Tu{{okina}}i Tonga</a> and was invited to the festivities. According to the writer <a href="/wiki/William_Mariner_(writer)" id="w">William Mariner</a>, in reality the chiefs had wanted to kill Cook during the gathering, but had been unable to agree on a plan. </p>
<p>Tonga is the only surviving <a href="/wiki/Monarchy" id="w">monarchy</a> among the island nations of the Pacific Ocean.  </p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Archaeological evidence shows that the first settlers in Tonga sailed from the <a href="/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Islands" id="w">Santa Cruz Islands</a>, as part of the original <a href="/wiki/Austronesian_languages" id="w">Austronesian</a>-speakers&#39; (<a href="/wiki/Lapita" id="w">Lapita</a>) migration which originated out of S.E. Asia some 6,000 years ago. Archaeological dating places Tonga as the oldest known site in <a href="/wiki/Polynesia" id="w">Polynesia</a> for the distinctive Lapita ceramic ware, at 2,800&#8211;2,750 years ago. The &#34;<a href="/wiki/Lapita" id="w">Lapita</a>&#34; people lived and sailed, traded, warred, and intermarried in the islands now known as Tonga, <a href="/wiki/Samoa" id="w">Samoa</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Fiji" id="w">Fiji</a> for 1,000 years, before more explorers set off towards the east to discover the <a href="/wiki/Marquesas" id="w">Marquesas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tahiti" id="w">Tahiti</a>, and eventually the rest of the islands of the Pacific Ocean. For this reason, Tonga, Samoa and Fiji are described by anthropologists as the cradle of Polynesian culture and civilization.</p>
<p>By the 12th century, Tongans, and the Tongan paramount chief, the <a href="/wiki/Tu%26%2339%3Bi_Tonga" id="w">Tu{{okina}}i Tonga</a>, were known across the Pacific, from <a href="/wiki/Niue" id="w">Niue</a> to <a href="/wiki/Tikopia" id="w">Tikopia</a>, sparking some historians to refer to a &#39;<a href="/wiki/Tu%26%2339%3Bi_Tonga_Empire" id="w">Tongan Empire</a>&#39;. A network of interacting navigators, chiefs, and adventurers might be a better term although the empire did have its own dynasties. In the 15th century and again in the 17th, civil war erupted. It was in this context that the first Europeans arrived, beginning with <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Dutch</a> explorers <a href="/wiki/Willem_Schouten" id="w">Willem Schouten</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Le_Maire" id="w">Jacob Le Maire</a> in <a href="/wiki/1616" id="w">1616</a>, who called on the northern island of <a href="/wiki/Niuatoputapu" id="w">Niuatoputapu</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Abel_Tasman" id="w">Abel Tasman</a>, who visited <a href="/wiki/Tongatapu" id="w">Tongatapu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ha%26%2339%3Bapai" id="w">Ha{{okina}}apai</a> in <a href="/wiki/1643" id="w">1643</a>. Later noteworthy European visits were by <a href="/wiki/Captain_Cook" id="w">Captain Cook</a> in <a href="/wiki/1773" id="w">1773</a>, <a href="/wiki/1774" id="w">1774</a>, and <a href="/wiki/1777" id="w">1777</a>, the first London <a href="/wiki/Missionaries" id="w">missionaries</a> in <a href="/wiki/1797" id="w">1797</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Methodism" id="w">Wesleyan Methodist</a> <a href="/wiki/Walter_Lawry_Buller" id="w">Walter Lawry Buller</a> in <a href="/wiki/1822" id="w">1822</a>.</p>
<p>Tonga was united into a <a href="/wiki/Polynesia" id="w">Polynesian</a> kingdom in <a href="/wiki/1845" id="w">1845</a> by the ambitious young warrior, strategist, and orator <a href="/wiki/Taufa%26%2339%3Bahau" id="w">Tāufa{{okina}}āhau</a>. He held the chiefly title of <a href="/wiki/Tu%26%2339%3Bi_Kanokupolu" id="w">Tu{{okina}}i Kanokupolu</a>, but was baptised with the name King George. In <a href="/wiki/1875" id="w">1875</a>, with the help of missionary Shirley Baker, he declared Tonga a constitutional monarchy, formally adopted the western royal style, emancipated the &#39;serfs&#39;, enshrined a code of law, land tenure, and freedom of the press, and limited the power of the chiefs.</p>
<p>Tonga became a British <a href="/wiki/Protected_state" id="w">protected state</a> under a Treaty of Friendship on <a href="/wiki/18_May" id="w">18 May</a>, <a href="/wiki/1900" id="w">1900</a>, when European settlers and rival Tongan chiefs tried to oust the second king. Within the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British Empire</a>, which posted no higher permanent representative on Tonga than a British <a href="/wiki/Consul_(representative)" id="w">Consul</a> (1901-1970), it was part of the <a href="/wiki/British_Western_Pacific_Territories" id="w">British Western Pacific Territories</a> (under a colonial <a href="/wiki/High_Commissioner" id="w">High Commissioner</a>, then residing on Fiji) from 1901 until <a href="/wiki/1952" id="w">1952</a>.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Friendship and Tonga&#39;s protectorate status ended in 1970 under arrangements established prior to her death by Queen <a href="/wiki/Salote_Tupou_III" id="w">Salote Tupou III</a>. Tonga joined the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth of Nations</a> in 1970 (atypically as an autochthonous monarchy, that is one with its own hereditary monarch rather than <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Elizabeth II</a>), and the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a> in <a href="/wiki/September_1999" id="w">September 1999</a>. While exposed to colonial forces, Tonga has never lost <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_Oceania" id="w">indigenous</a> governance, a fact that makes Tonga unique in the Pacific and gives Tongans much pride, as well as confidence in their monarchical system. As part of cost cutting measures across the British Foreign Service, the British Government closed the <a href="/wiki/British_High_Commission" id="w">British High Commission</a> in Nuku{{okina}}alofa in <a href="/wiki/March_2006" id="w">March 2006</a>, transferring representation of British interests in Tonga to the UK High Commissioner in Fiji. The last resident British High Commissioner was His Excellency Mr. Paul Nessling.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

<a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2>Politics</h2>
<p>{{main}}
Tonga is a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" id="w">constitutional monarchy</a>. The reverence for the monarch is likened to that held in earlier centuries for the sacred paramount chief, the Tu{{okina}}i Tonga. Criticism of the monarch is held to be contrary to Tongan culture and etiquette. A direct descendant of the first monarch, King <a href="/wiki/George_Tupou_V" id="w">George Tupou V</a>, his family, some powerful nobles, and a growing non-royal elite caste live in much wealth, with the rest of the country living in relative poverty. The effects of this disparity are mitigated by three factors: education, medicine, and land tenure.</p>
<p>Tonga&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Education" id="w">education</a> system is free and mandatory for all children up to the age of fourteen, with only  nominal fees for secondary education, and foreign-funded scholarships for post-secondary education. Tongans are well-educated, with a 98% <a href="/wiki/Literacy" id="w">literacy</a> rate, and higher education up to and including medical and graduate degrees. </p>
<p>Tongans also have universal access to a socialized medicine system. Tongan land is constitutionally protected and cannot be sold to foreigners (although it may be leased). While there is a land shortage on the urbanized main island of <a href="/wiki/Tongatapu" id="w">Tongatapu</a> (where 70% of the population resides), there is farm land available in the outlying islands. The majority of the population engages in some form of subsistence production of food, with approximately half producing almost all of their basic food needs through farming, sea harvesting, and animal husbandry. Women and men have equal access to education and health care, and are fairly equal in employment, but women are discriminated against in land holding, electoral politics, and government ministries. However, in Tongan tradition women enjoy a higher social status then men, a cultural trait that is unique among the insular societies of the Pacific.</p>
<p>There is a pro-<a href="/wiki/Democracy" id="w">democracy</a> movement in Tonga, which emphasizes reforms including better representation in the Parliament for the majority commoners, and better accountability in matters of state. An overthrow of the monarchy itself is not part of the movement and the institution of monarchy continues to hold popular support, even while reforms are advocated. Until recently, the governance issue was generally ignored by the leaders of other countries, but major aid donors and neighbours <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a> and <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> are now expressing concerns about some Tongan government actions.</p>
<p>Following the precedents of Queen Sālote, and with numerous international advisors, the government of Tonga under King Tāufa{{okina}}āhau Tupou IV has monetized the economy, internationalized the medical and education system, and enabled access by commoners to increasing forms of material wealth (houses, cars, and other commodities), education, and overseas travel. The government has supported Olympic and other international sports competition, and contributed Peacekeepers to the United Nations (notably to <a href="/wiki/Bougainville_Province" id="w">Bougainville</a> and the Solomon Islands). The Tongan government also supported the American &#39;<a href="/wiki/Coalition_of_the_willing" id="w">coalition of the willing</a>&#39; action in Iraq, and a small number of Tongan soldiers were deployed, as part of an American force, to Iraq in late 2004. However, the contingent of 40+ troops returned home on 17 December 2004.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> In 2007, another contingent was sent to Iraq as part of Tonga&#39;s continuous support for the coalition.</p>
<p>The previous king, Tāufa{{okina}}āhau and his government have made some problematic economic decisions and are accused of wasting millions of dollars in poor investments.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The problems have mostly been driven by attempts to increase national revenue through a variety of schemes, including searching for oil (despite geological reports indicating no possible oil);<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> considering making Tonga a nuclear waste disposal site (an idea floated in the mid-90s by the current crown prince);<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> selling Tongan Protected Persons Passports (which eventually forced Tonga to nationalize the purchasers, sparking ethnicity-based concerns within Tonga);<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> registering foreign ships (which proved to be engaged in illegal activities, including shipments for <a href="/wiki/Al-Qaeda" id="w">al-Qaeda</a>);<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> claiming geo-orbital satellite slots (the revenue from which seems to belong to the Princess Royal, not the state);<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> holding a long-term charter on an unusable <a href="/wiki/Boeing_757" id="w">Boeing 757</a> that was sidelined in <a href="/wiki/Auckland" id="w">Auckland</a> Airport, leading to the collapse of Royal Tongan Airlines;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> building an airport hotel and potential casino with an Interpol-accused criminal;{{Fact}} and approving a factory for exporting <a href="/wiki/Cigarette" id="w">cigarettes</a> to China (against the advice of Tongan medical officials, and decades of health promotion messaging).<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The king has proved vulnerable to speculators with big promises and lost several million (reportedly 26 million USD) to <a href="/wiki/Jesse_Bogdonoff" id="w">Jesse Bogdonoff</a>, a financial adviser who called himself the king&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Jester" id="w">Court Jester</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The police have imprisoned pro-democracy leaders, and the government repeatedly confiscated the newspaper <i>The Tongan Times</i> (which was printed in New Zealand and sold in Tonga) because the editor had been vocally critical of the king&#39;s mistakes.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Notably, the <i>Kele{{okina}}a</i>, produced specifically to critique the government and printed in Tonga by pro-democracy leader {{okina}}Akilisi Pōhiva, was not banned during that time.

<p>In mid-2003, the government passed a radical constitutional amendment to &#34;Tonganize&#34; the press, by licensing and limiting freedom of the press, so as to protect the image of the monarchy. The amendment was defended by the government and by royalists on the basis of traditional cultural values. Licensure criteria include 80% ownership by Tongans living in the country. As of February 2004, those papers denied licenses under the new act included the <i>Taimi {{okina}}o Tonga</i> (<i>Tongan Times</i>), the <i>Kele{{okina}}a</i> and the <i>Matangi Tonga</i>, while those which were permitted licenses were uniformly church-based or pro-government. The bill was opposed in the form of a several-thousand-strong protest march in the capital, a call by the Tu{{okina}}i Pelehake (a prince, nephew of the king and elected member of parliament) for Australia and other nations to pressure the Tongan government to democratize the electoral system, and a legal writ calling for a judicial investigation of the bill. The latter was supported by some 160 signatories, including seven of the nine elected &#34;People&#39;s Representatives&#34;. The strong-arm tactics and gaffes have overshadowed the good that the aged king had done in his lifetime, as well as the many beneficial reforms of his son, {{okina}}Aho{{okina}}eitu {{okina}}Unuaki{{okina}}otonga Tuku{{okina}}aho (Lavaka Ata {{okina}}Ulukālala), who was Prime Minister from <a href="/wiki/3_January" id="w">3 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a> to <a href="/wiki/11_February" id="w">11 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>. The former Crown Prince and current monarch, Tupouto{{okina}}a, and Pilolevu, the Princess Royal, remained generally silent on the issue. In total, the changes threatened to destabilize the polity, fraction support for the status quo, and place further pressure on the monarchy.</p>
<p>In 2005 the government spent several weeks negotiating with striking civil service workers before reaching a settlement. The civil unrest that ensued was not limited to just Tonga; protests outside the king&#39;s New Zealand residence made headlines, too. A constitutional commission is currently (2005-06) studying proposals to update the constitution.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Prime Minister Prince <a href="/wiki/&amp;%2339%3BAho%26%2339%3Beitu_%26%2339%3BUnuaki%26%2339%3Botonga_Tuku%26%2339%3Baho" id="w">{{okina}}Aho{{okina}}eitu {{okina}}Unuaki{{okina}}otonga Tuku{{okina}}aho (Lavaka Ata {{okina}}Ulukālala)</a> resigned suddenly on <a href="/wiki/11_February" id="w">11 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, and also gave up his other cabinet portfolios. He was replaced in the interim by the elected Minister of Labour, Dr <a href="/wiki/Feleti_Sevele" id="w">Feleti Sevele</a>.</p>
<p>The co-chairman of the constitutional reform commission His Royal Highness <a href="/wiki/Tu%26%2339%3Bipelehake_(%26%2339%3BUluvalu)" id="w">{{okina}}Uluvalu</a> (Prince Tuipelehake), 55, who was a nephew of the King, and his wife, Kaimana Aleamotu{{okina}}a, 45, were killed by an 18-year old female teenager driving a <a href="/wiki/Ford_Mustang" id="w">Ford Mustang</a> as she was racing in a California freeway near Menlo Park about 30 miles south of <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" id="w">San Francisco</a>, California, on <a href="/wiki/5_July" id="w">5 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>. The teenager was reported to have been travelling around 100mph upon hitting the red Ford Explorer carrying the two and also instantly killing the driver of the Explorer. The teenager was not hurt in the accident.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Tongan government formally announced on Monday, <a href="/wiki/11_September" id="w">11 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> that King Tupou IV died late Sunday night in Mercy Hospital in <a href="/wiki/Auckland" id="w">Auckland</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a>, where he had been receiving treatment for much of the past year. He was 88 and had reigned for 41 years.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>He was succeeded by his eldest son, Tupouto{{okina}}a, now ruling under the title Siaosi Tupou V.</p>
<p>The public expected some changes under the new monarch. On <a href="/wiki/2006_Tonga_riots" id="w">November 16, 2006, rioting broke out</a> in the capital city of Nuku&#39;alofa when it seemed that the parliament would adjourn for the year without having made any advances in increasing democracy in government. Government buildings, offices, and shops were looted and burned. <sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

Tonga&#39;s economy is characterized by a large non monetary sector and a heavy dependence on remittances from the half of the country&#39;s population that lives abroad, chiefly in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. The monetary sector of the economy is dominated and largely owned by the royal family and nobles. This is particularly true of the telecommunications and satellite services. Much of small business, particularly retail establishments on Tongatapu, is now dominated by recent <a href="/wiki/Overseas_Chinese" id="w">Chinese</a> immigrants who arrived under a cash-for-passports scheme that ended in 1998.</p>
<p>The manufacturing sector consists of <a href="/wiki/Cottage_industry" id="w">handicrafts</a> and a few other very smallscale industries, all of which contribute only about 3% of GDP. Commercial business activities also are inconspicuous and, to a large extent, are dominated by the same large trading companies found throughout the South Pacific. In September 1974, the country&#39;s first commercial trading bank, the Bank of Tonga, opened.</p>
<p>Rural Tongans rely on <a href="/wiki/Plantation" id="w">plantation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Subsistence_agriculture" id="w">subsistence agriculture</a>. <a href="/wiki/Coconut" id="w">Coconuts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vanilla_bean" id="w">vanilla beans</a>, <a href="/wiki/Banana" id="w">bananas</a> and root crops such as yams, taro and cassava, are the major <a href="/wiki/Cash_crop" id="w">cash crops</a>. The processing of coconuts into copra and <a href="/wiki/Desiccation" id="w">desiccated</a> (dried) coconut was once the only significant industry but deteriorating prices on the world market has brought this once vibrant industry, as everywhere throughout the island nations of the south Pacific, to a complete standstill. Pigs and poultry are the major types of <a href="/wiki/Livestock" id="w">livestock</a>. Horses are kept for draft purposes, primarily by farmers working their &#39;api &#39;uta (a plot of bushland). More cattle are being raised, and beef imports are declining. The export of squash to Japan once brought relief to a struggling economy but recently local farmers are increasingly wary of this market due to price fluctuations, not to mention the huge financial risks involved.</p>
<p>Tonga&#39;s development plans emphasize a growing private sector, upgrading agricultural productivity, revitalizing the squash and vanilla bean industries, developing tourism, and improving the island&#39;s communications and transportation systems. Substantial progress has been made, but much work remains to be done. A small but growing construction sector is developing in response to the inflow of aid monies and remittances from Tongans abroad. It remains to be said that the most significant contributor to Tonga&#39;s economy are remmittances from Tongans living abroad. In recognition of such a crucial contribution, the present Tongan government has created a new department within the Prime Minister&#39;s Office with the sole purpose of catering for the needs of Tongans living abroad. Furthermore, the Tongan Parliament in 2007 ammended citizenship laws to allow Tongans especially those living overseas to hold dual citizenship.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to discover ways to diversify. One hope is seen in <a href="/wiki/Fishery" id="w">fisheries</a>; tests have shown that sufficient skipjack tuna pass through Tongan waters to support a fishing industry. Another potential development activity is exploitation of <a href="/wiki/Forest" id="w">forests</a>, which cover 35% of the kingdom&#39;s land area but are decreasing as land is cleared. Coconut trees past their prime bearing years also provide a potential source of <a href="/wiki/Timber" id="w">timber</a>.</p>
<p>The tourist industry is relatively undeveloped; however, the government recognizes that tourism can play a major role in economic development, and efforts are being made to increase this source of revenue. Cruise ships often stop in Nuku{{okina}}alofa and Vava{{okina}}u.</p>
<p>Vava&#39;u in fact is well known for its whale watching, game fishing, surfing, beaches and the like and is increasingly becoming a major player in the South Pacific tourism market.</p>
<p>Real estate companies have also just started to spring up in Tonga; as such, they were basically unheard of less than a decade ago. These have provided a way of making income for many Tongans as nearly every male Tongan has plots of land that he has never seen and the leasing of this valuable and attractive land allows the Tongan to live in a comfort not experienced before. There are also many Tongans who work as commission agents and earn a living by finding available land parcels and bringing them to local ex-pats or computer savvy Tongans to list on-line. Some of these so-called real estate companies have done more harm than good and one would be wise to be careful when dealing with them, however for the most part acquiring real estate in Tonga is a simple, straight forward and hassle free process.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>In 2005 the country became eligible to become a member of the <a href="/wiki/World_Trade_Organization" id="w">World Trade Organization</a>, however on <a href="/wiki/25_July" id="w">25 July</a> 2006 it was announced that Tonga has deferred its membership of the WTO until July next year according to the Tongan Prime Minister, Dr Feleti Sevele.</p>
<p>The delay he said did not mean that Tonga was withdrawing its WTO membership application, but to give Tonga more time to improve its tariff system.</p>
<a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2>Demographics</h2>
<p>{{main}}
Almost two-thirds of the 112,422 inhabitants of the Kingdom of Tonga live on its main island, Tongatapu. Although an increasing number of Tongans have moved into the only urban and commercial centre, Nuku{{okina}}alofa, where European and indigenous cultural and living patterns have blended, village life and kinship ties continue to be important throughout the country. Everyday life is heavily influenced by Polynesian traditions and especially by the Christian faith; for example, all commerce and entertainment activities cease from midnight Saturday until midnight Sunday, and the constitution declares the Sabbath to be sacred, forever. The majority of Tongans are Methodists <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> with a <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church_in_Tonga" id="w">significant Catholic minority</a>.

<p>Primary education between ages 6 and 14 is compulsory and free in state schools. Mission schools provide about 8% of the primary and 90% of the secondary level of education. State schools make up for the rest. Higher education includes teacher training, nursing and medical training, a small private university, a women&#39;s business college, and a number of private agricultural schools. Most higher education is pursued overseas.</p>

The Tongan archipelago has been inhabited for perhaps 3,000 years, since settlement in late <a href="/wiki/Lapita" id="w">Lapita</a> times. The <a href="/wiki/Culture" id="w">culture</a> of its inhabitants has surely changed greatly over this long time period. Before the arrival of European explorers in the late 1600s and early 1700s, the Tongans were in frequent contact with their nearest Oceanic neighbors, <a href="/wiki/Fiji" id="w">Fiji</a> and <a href="/wiki/Samoa" id="w">Samoa</a>. In the 1800s, with the arrival of Western traders and missionaries, Tongan culture changed dramatically. Some old beliefs and habits were thrown away, and others adopted. Some accommodations made in the 1800s and early 1900s are now being challenged by changing Western civilization.</p>
<p>Contemporary Tongans often have strong ties to overseas lands. Many Tongans have emigrated to <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> to seek employment and a higher standard of living. U.S. cities with significant Tongan American populations include <a href="/wiki/San_Mateo%2C_California" id="w">San Mateo, California</a>; <a href="/wiki/East_Palo_Alto%2C_California" id="w">East Palo Alto, California</a>; <a href="/wiki/Oakland%2C_California" id="w">Oakland, California</a>; <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles%2C_California" id="w">Los Angeles, California</a>; <a href="/wiki/Salt_Lake_City%2C_Utah" id="w">Salt Lake City, Utah</a>; <a href="/wiki/Honolulu%2C_Hawaii" id="w">Honolulu, Hawaii</a>; and <a href="/wiki/Euless%2C_Texas" id="w">Euless, Texas</a> (in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex). Large Tongan communities can also be found in <a href="/wiki/Auckland%2C_New_Zealand" id="w">Auckland, New Zealand</a> and in <a href="/wiki/Sydney%2C_Australia" id="w">Sydney, Australia</a>. This Tongan <a href="/wiki/Diaspora" id="w">diaspora</a> is still closely tied to relatives at home, and a significant portion of Tonga&#39;s income derives from remittances to family members (often aged) who prefer to remain in Tonga.</p>
<p>Tongans, therefore, often have to operate in two different contexts, which they often call <i>anga fakatonga</i>, the traditional Tongan way, and <i>anga fakapãlangi</i>, the Western way. A culturally adept Tongan learns both sets of rules and when to switch between them.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Rugby_union" id="w">Rugby union</a> is the national sport in Tonga, and the <a href="/wiki/Tonga_national_rugby_union_team" id="w">national team</a> (&#39;Ikale Tahi or Sea Eagles) has performed quite well on the international stage. Although the national team has not performed as well as neighboring <a href="/wiki/Samoa" id="w">Samoa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fiji" id="w">Fiji</a>, Tonga has competed at four <a href="/wiki/Rugby_World_Cup" id="w">Rugby World Cups</a>, the first being in <a href="/wiki/1987_Rugby_World_Cup" id="w">1987</a>. The <a href="/wiki/2007_Rugby_World_Cup" id="w">2007 Rugby World Cup</a> was its most successful to date, with Tonga winning both of its first two matches, against the <a href="/wiki/United_States_national_rugby_union_team" id="w">USA</a> 25-15 and <a href="/wiki/Samoa_national_rugby_union_team" id="w">Samoa</a> 19-15; and came very close to upsetting the eventual winners of the 2007 tournament, the South African Springboks, losing 30-25 in the end. They then lost to England 36-20 in their last pool game to end their hopes of making the knockout stages but were by no means disgraced. In fact, by picking up third place in their pool games behind South Africa and England, Tonga has since been rewarded with automatic qualification for the 2011 Rugby World Cup to be held in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Its best result prior to 2007 was in <a href="/wiki/1995_Rugby_World_Cup" id="w">1995</a> when they won one game beating Ivory Coast 29-11, and <a href="/wiki/1999_Rugby_World_Cup" id="w">1999</a> when they won one game beating Italy 28-25 (although with only 14 men they lost heavily to England in 1999, 10-101). Tonga performs the &#39;<a href="/wiki/Sipi_Tau" id="w">Sipi Tau</a>&#39; (war dance) before its matches. Tonga used to compete in the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Tri-Nations" id="w">Pacific Tri-Nations</a> against Samoa and Fiji which has now been replaced by the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Nations_Cup" id="w">IRB Pacific 6 Nations</a> involving as well Japan, the second string <a href="/wiki/All_Blacks" id="w">All Blacks</a> (Junior All Blacks) and <a href="/wiki/Wallabies" id="w">Wallabies</a> (Australia A) although from 2008 the Junior All Blacks would be replaced by the Maori All Blacks. At club level, there are the <a href="/wiki/Datec_Cup_Provincial_Championship" id="w">Datec Cup Provincial Championship</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Rugby_Cup" id="w">Pacific Rugby Cup</a>. Rugby union is governed by the <a href="/wiki/Tonga_Rugby_Football_Union" id="w">Tonga Rugby Football Union</a>, which is also a member of the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Islands_Rugby_Alliance" id="w">Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance</a>. Tonga contributes to the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Islanders_rugby_union_team" id="w">Pacific Islanders rugby union team</a>.  <a href="/wiki/Jonah_Lomu" id="w">Jonah Lomu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Viliami_Ofahengaue" id="w">Viliami (William) &#39;Ofahengaue</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_Smith_(rugby_player)" id="w">George Smith</a> are all of Tongan descent.  Rugby is popular in the nation&#39;s schools and students from schools such as <a href="/wiki/Tupou_College" id="w">Tupou College</a> are regularly offered scholarships from New Zealand, Australia and <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>. It should be added, however, that many players of Tongan descent also make it big in the Australian <a href="/wiki/National_Rugby_League" id="w">National Rugby League</a> competition. These include Willy Mason, Brent Kite, Willy Tonga, Anthony Tupou, Antonio Kaufusi, Israel Folau, to name but a few.</p>
