<p>The <b>music of Minnesota</b> has played a role in the historical and cultural development of <a href="/wiki/Minnesota" id="w">Minnesota</a>.  As with the culture of Minnesota in general, the state&#39;s music scene centers on the <a href="/wiki/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul" id="w">Minneapolis-Saint Paul</a> area, and most of the Minnesotan artists who have become nationally popular either came from that area or debuted there.  Rural Minnesota has also produced a flourishing folk music scene, with a long tradition of traditional <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Sweden" id="w">Swedish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Finland" id="w">Finnish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Norway" id="w">Norwegian music</a>.<sup id="_ref-Garland_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Garland" title="">[1]</a></sup> Minnesota&#39;s modern local music scene is home to thousands of local bands, many of which perform with some regularity.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Some performers from nearby regions of neighboring states, such as western Wisconsin and Fargo, North Dakota, are often considered a part of the Minnesota music scene.  </p>
<p>Minneapolis has produced a number of famous performers, such as <a href="/wiki/Bob_Dylan" id="w">Bob Dylan</a>, who was born in Duluth, grew up in Hibbing, and began his musical career in the Minneapolis area, and <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Jam_and_Terry_Lewis" id="w">Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis</a>, who eventually formed <a href="/wiki/The_Time_(band)" id="w">The Time</a> and <a href="/wiki/Record_producer" id="w">produced</a> for <a href="/wiki/Gladys_Knight" id="w">Gladys Knight</a> and <a href="/wiki/Janet_Jackson" id="w">Janet Jackson</a>.  Minneapolis&#39; most influential contributions to <a href="/wiki/American_popular_music" id="w">American popular music</a> began in the 1970s and 1980s, when the city&#39;s music scene &#34;expanded the state&#39;s cultural identity&#34; and launched the careers of acclaimed performers like the multi-platinum <a href="/wiki/Soul_music" id="w">soul</a> singer <a href="/wiki/Prince_(artist)" id="w">Prince</a>, and cult favorites <a href="/wiki/The_Replacements" id="w">The Replacements</a> and <a href="/wiki/H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC" id="w">H체sker D체</a>.

Thousands of <a href="/wiki/Norwegian_people" id="w">Norwegians</a> settled in Minnesota between 1825 and 1925. Subcultures formed based around village of origin (<i>bygde</i>), and then formed organizations to maintain their home dialect and musical traditions. These organizations held annual meetings (<i>stevne</i>) which featured folk dancing, singing, fiddling and poetry. In the late 1860s, male choirs with primarily Norwegian and Swedish singers formed in cities and Lutheran colleges in Minnesota. These choirs sang a variety of popular and patriotic songs, hymns and folk tunes. In the 1880s, these choirs inspired the organization of singing societies that sponsored music festivals; the largest of these singing societies is the <a href="/wiki/Norwegian_Singers_Association_of_America" id="w">Norwegian Singers Association of America</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Union_of_Scandinavian_Singers" id="w">Union of Scandinavian Singers</a>.<sup id="_ref-Garland_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Garland" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The end of the 19th century also saw the foundation of two long-running music groups, the <a href="/wiki/Thursday_Musical_Chorus" id="w">Thursday Musical Chorus</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Apollo_Men%26%2339%3Bs_Musical_Group" id="w">Apollo Men&#39;s Musical Group</a>.  Two of the most important Minnesota institutions were founded in the early 20th century, namely the MacPhail School of Violin (1907, later becoming the <a href="/wiki/MacPhail_Center_for_Music" id="w">MacPhail Center for Music</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/Minneapolis_Symphony_Orchestra" id="w">Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra</a> (1903, later the <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_Orchestra" id="w">Minnesota Orchestra</a>).<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Minneapolis became a home for <a href="/wiki/Vaudeville" id="w">vaudeville</a>, especially Scandinavian-American vaudeville. This field was known as <i>bondkomik</i> (Norwegian) or <i>bondkomiker</i> (Swedish), and featured multi-act plays, dances, songs and monologues. Vaudeville shows usually ended with social dancing. Minneapolis&#39; most famous performers were the <a href="/wiki/Olson_sisters" id="w">Olson sisters</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hjalmar_Peterson" id="w">Hjalmar Peterson</a> and Ernest and Clarence Iverson (<a href="/wiki/Slim_Jim_%26amp%3B_the_Vagabond_Kid" id="w">Slim Jim &#38; the Vagabond Kid</a>). After World War 1, Scandinavian musical pride diminished, a process accelerated by economic decline in the 1930s; rural and regional dance music slowly died out and became largely unknown.  During this era, however, the <i><a href="/wiki/Leikarring" id="w">Leikarring</a></i> movement began, which celebrated national Norwegian folk dance and song through musical societies like Minnesota&#39;s <i>Norrona Leikarring</i>.<sup id="_ref-Garland_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Garland" title="">[1]</a></sup>  </p>

Local radio host <a href="/wiki/Leigh_Kamman" id="w">Leigh Kamman</a> is linked to jazz in Minnesota, as he has now been covering it for more than sixty years.

Minnesota is home to many ethnic groups, but the state&#39;s folk music is best known in the areas of <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Sweden" id="w">Swedish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Finland" id="w">Finnish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Norway" id="w">Norwegian musics</a>.  These ethnic communities frequently settled near each other, in Minnesota and in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, North Dakota and South Dakota, and their musical and cultural identities grew blurred.  Norwegians and Swedes very frequently lived near each other in Minnesota, for example, and their music merged into a perceived Scandinavian identity, rather than uniquely Swedish or Norwegian. Their music is perceived as <i><a href="/wiki/Old-time_music" id="w">old-time music</a></i>, and is also influenced by the area&#39;s German, Irish, English, Polish and other Northern and Central European musics.<sup id="_ref-Garland_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Garland" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

Minnesotan musicians from all genres have gained notoriety over the years, with the singing <a href="/wiki/The_Andrews_Sisters" id="w">Andrews Sisters</a> gaining worldwide prominence during World War II.

Prior to the evolution of punk in the 1970s, there was little rock and roll tradition from Minneapolis, which author Steven Blush attributed to a lack of anything to &#34;rebel against&#34;, noting that it was Minneapolis&#39; friendly atmosphere that made future hardcore punk musicians &#34;crazy and rebellious&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> The first rock band from Minneapolis to achieve national prominence was the <a href="/wiki/Surf_rock" id="w">surf rock</a> group <a href="/wiki/The_Trashmen" id="w">The Trashmen</a> who formed in 1962 and had a hit two years later with &#34;Surfin&#39; Bird&#34;.

<p>Bob Dylan, a <a href="/wiki/Hibbing%2C_Minnesota" id="w">Hibbing</a> native, became the first major mainstream solo star from Minnesota in the 1960s, known for his unique lyricism and <a href="/wiki/Folk-rock" id="w">folk-rock</a> style.  He spent a brief period in Minneapolis, attending the University of Minnesota, where he played free shows on the West Bank of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Minnesota" id="w">University of Minnesota</a> Minneapolis campus.  He was associated with <a href="/wiki/Dinkytown" id="w">Dinkytown</a>, the local center for young fans of folk music, where he listened to a wide variety of folk and blues.  The city&#39;s local folk scene produced a few well-known performers in the 1960s, besides Dylan, who spent much of his early career based out New York; these include the guitarist <a href="/wiki/Leo_Kottke" id="w">Leo Kottke</a> and the trio <a href="/wiki/Koerner%2C_Ray_%26amp%3B_Glover" id="w">Koerner, Ray &#38; Glover</a>.

<p>These later sources brought the Minneapolis music scene to national attention; the period from about 1977 to 1987 was a period of incredible dynamism in the Minneapolis music scene, with offshoots in the punk scene including Soul Asylum, <a href="/wiki/Babes_in_Toyland_(band)" id="w">Babes in Toyland</a>, the Clams and many other seminal favorites, while Prince&#39;s immense power in the industry (which peaked during this period) created a rhythm and blues mini-empire at his <a href="/wiki/Paisley_Park_Studios" id="w">Paisley Park Studios</a>, based in suburban <a href="/wiki/Chanhassen%2C_Minnesota" id="w">Chanhassen</a>.</p>
