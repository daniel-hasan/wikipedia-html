<p>Nailatikau&#39;s career spanned 20 years in the <a href="/wiki/Military_of_Fiji" id="w">military</a> and 17 years in the <a href="/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Fiji" id="w">diplomatic service</a>.  Following his education at Bau District School, Draiba Fijian School, Levuka Public School and Queen Victoria School, Nailatikau trained as a soldier in <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a>.  In <a href="/wiki/1966" id="w">1966</a>, he served on secondment in the 1st Battalion, <a href="/wiki/Royal_New_Zealand_Infantry_Regiment" id="w">Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment</a> and was posted to <a href="/wiki/Sarawak" id="w">Sarawak</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" id="w">Malaysia</a>, during <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" id="w">Indonesia&#39;s</a> &#34;<a href="/wiki/Konfrontasi" id="w">Konfrontasi</a>&#34; against Malaysia. He proved to be a popular and highly respected officer.  When he returned to the <a href="/wiki/Fiji_Infantry_Regiment" id="w">Fiji Infantry Regiment</a>, he rose steadily through the ranks.  By <a href="/wiki/1987" id="w">1987</a>, he held the rank of Brigadier-General, and was the Commander of the Royal Fiji Military Forces.

<a id="Diplomatic_career" name="Diplomatic_career"></a><h1> Diplomatic career </h1>

<p>Nailatikau retired from the Army and decided to pursue a new career in the diplomatic service.

He withdrew his nomination, however, in favour of <a href="/wiki/Laisenia_Qarase" id="w">Laisenia Qarase</a>, who was considered more of a consensus candidate, but became Deputy Prime Minister and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ministers_for_Fijian_Affairs" id="w">Minister for Fijian Affairs</a> in the interim <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_(Fiji)" id="w">Cabinet</a>.  In 2001, after democracy had been restored in a <a href="/wiki/Fiji_election_of_2001" id="w">general election</a>, he defeated, by a vote of 41 to 29, <a href="/wiki/Joeli_Kalou" id="w">Joeli Kalou</a> for the position of <a href="/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Representatives_(Fiji)" id="w">Speaker</a> of the House of Representatives, a position he held until after the 2006 elections.</p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/14_June" id="w">14 June</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, Nailatikau was appointed the <a href="/wiki/UNAIDS" id="w">UNAIDS</a> Special Representative for the Pacific.  According to the <a href="/wiki/Joint_United_Nations_Program_on_HIV/AIDS" id="w">Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS</a>, he was chosen because his political position, his respect throughout the Pacific region, and his outspokenness on <a href="/wiki/AIDS" id="w">AIDS</a>-related issues.  He has previously served as a UNAIDS Pacific spokesman, and in October<a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a> chaired the first conference of Pacific Parliamentarians on the Role of Pacific Parliamentarians in the fight against HIV/AIDS, in <a href="/wiki/Suva" id="w">Suva</a>.</p>
<p>Nailatikau&#39;s outspoken calls to tackle the AIDS crisis have attracted controversy.  On <a href="/wiki/22_November" id="w">22 November</a> 2005, he called on people to recognize the reality that promiscuity existed, and that <a href="/wiki/Safe_sex" id="w">safe sex</a> needed to be promoted to combat the associated AIDS risk.  It was unrealistic to deny promiscuity and just promote abstinence, he considered, adding that this was a matter of life and death.  He also called on churches to face the reality that promiscuity existed among their own congregations, and to meet the problem &#34;head on&#34; and play a part in promoting the use of condoms.</p>
<p>He represented the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA)<a class="externallink" href="http://www.cpahq.org" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cpahq.org">http://www.cpahq.org</a> at the World AIDS Conference in Toronto in August 2006.</p>
