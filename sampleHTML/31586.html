<p>Ty Cobb was born in <a href="/wiki/Narrows%2C_Georgia" id="w">Narrows</a>, <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)" id="w">Georgia</a>, in 1886 as the first of three children to Amanda Chitwood Cobb and William Herschel Cobb.</p>
<p>Ty spent his first years in baseball as a member of the Royston Rompers, the semi-pro Royston Reds, and the Augusta Tourists of the <a href="/wiki/South_Atlantic_League" id="w">Sally League</a>.  However, the Tourists cut Cobb two days into the season.<sup id="_ref-StumpPage57_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-StumpPage57" title="">[17]</a></sup>  He then went to try out for the <a href="/wiki/Anniston%2C_Alabama" id="w">Anniston</a> Steelers of the semi-pro Tennessee-Alabama League, with his father&#39;s stern admonition still ringing in his ears: &#34;Don&#39;t come home a failure.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Kanfer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kanfer" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-StumpPage63_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-StumpPage63" title="">[19]</a></sup> After joining the Steelers for a monthly salary of $50,<sup id="_ref-StumpPage64_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-StumpPage64" title="">[20]</a></sup> Cobb promoted himself by sending several postcards written under different aliases to <a href="/wiki/Grantland_Rice" id="w">Grantland Rice</a>, the sports editor of the <i><a href="/wiki/The_Atlanta_Journal-Constitution" id="w">Atlanta Journal</a></i>.

<a id="The_early_years" name="The_early_years"></a><h4>The early years</h4>
<p>Three weeks after his mother killed his father, Cobb played center field for the Detroit Tigers.  On <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1905" id="w">1905</a>, in his first major league at-bat, Cobb doubled off the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Yankees" id="w">New York Highlanders</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Jack_Chesbro" id="w">Jack Chesbro</a>.  That season, Cobb managed to bat only .240 in 41 games.  Nevertheless, he showed enough promise as a rookie for the Tigers to give him a lucrative $1,500 contract for 1906.</p>

</p>
<p>Although rookie hazing was customary, Cobb could not endure it in good humor, and he soon became alienated from his teammates. He later attributed his hostile temperament to this experience: &#34;These old-timers turned me into a snarling wildcat.&#34;<sup id="_ref-NGECobb_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NGECobb" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>The following year (<a href="/wiki/1906_in_sports" id="w">1906</a>) he became the Tigers&#39; full-time center fielder and hit .316 in 98 games.  He would never hit below that mark again.  Cobb, firmly entrenched in center field, led the Tigers to three consecutive <a href="/wiki/American_League_pennant_winners_1901-68" id="w">American League Pennants</a> from 1907-1909.  Detroit would lose each <a href="/wiki/World_Series" id="w">World Series</a>, however, with Cobb&#39;s <a href="/wiki/World_Series" id="w">post-season</a> numbers being much below his career standard.</p>
<p>In one notable <a href="/wiki/1907_in_sports" id="w">1907</a> game, Cobb reached first, stole second, stole third, and then stole home on consecutive attempts (He did this twice more in his career).<sup id="_ref-stolenbases_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stolenbases" title="">[31]</a></sup>  He finished that season with a league high .350 batting average, 212 hits, 49 steals and 119 <a href="/wiki/Run_batted_in" id="w">Runs batted in</a> (RBI).<sup id="_ref-BaseballRefCobbCareerStats_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BaseballRefCobbCareerStats" title="">[26]</a></sup> At age 20, Cobb became the youngest player to win a <a href="/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_batting_champions" id="w">batting championship</a> and held this record until 1955 when fellow Detroit Tiger <a href="/wiki/Al_Kaline" id="w">Al Kaline</a> won the batting title when he was one day younger than Cobb.<sup id="_ref-BaseballPageKaline_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BaseballPageKaline" title="">[32]</a></sup> Despite great success on the field, Cobb was no stranger to controversy off it.

In September 1907, Cobb began a relationship with <a href="/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company" id="w">The Coca-Cola Company</a> that would last the remainder of his life.  By the time he died, he owned over 20,000 shares of stock and three <a href="/wiki/Bottling_company" id="w">bottling plants</a>: one in <a href="/wiki/Santa_Maria%2C_California" id="w">Santa Maria</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>; one in <a href="/wiki/Twin_Falls%2C_Idaho" id="w">Twin Falls</a>, <a href="/wiki/Idaho" id="w">Idaho</a>; and one in <a href="/wiki/Bend%2C_Oregon" id="w">Bend</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oregon" id="w">Oregon</a>.

<p>The following season, the Tigers defeated the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox" id="w">Chicago White Sox</a> for the pennant. Cobb again won the batting title with a .324 batting average. Despite another loss in the Series, Cobb had something to celebrate.

<p>The Tigers won the American League pennant again in <a href="/wiki/1909_in_baseball" id="w">1909</a>. During the Series, Cobb stole home in the second game, igniting a three-run rally, but that was the high point for Cobb. He ended batting a lowly .231 in his last World Series, as the Tigers lost in seven games. Although he performed poorly in the post-season, Cobb won the <a href="/wiki/Triple_crown_(baseball)" id="w">Triple Crown</a> by hitting .377 with 107 RBI and nine home runs – all <a href="/wiki/Inside-the-park_home_run" id="w">inside-the-park</a>.

Cobb was regarded not just as an athlete, but a psychological competitor. (He regarded baseball as &#34;something like a war,&#34; and <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Gehringer" id="w">Charlie Gehringer</a> said, &#34;Every time at bat for him was a crusade.&#34;<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup>)  The baseball historian <a href="/wiki/John_Thorn" id="w">John Thorn</a> has said, &#34;He is testament to how far you can get simply through will... Cobb was pursued by demons.&#34;</p>
<p>Cobb was having a typically fine year in {{by}}, which included a 40-game <a href="/wiki/Hitting_streak" id="w">hitting streak</a>. Still, <a href="/wiki/Shoeless_Joe_Jackson" id="w">”Shoeless” Joe Jackson</a> had a .009 point lead on him in batting average. What happened next is discussed in Cobb&#39;s autobiography. Near the end of the season, Cobb’s Tigers had a long series against Jackson and the <a href="/wiki/Cleveland_Indians" id="w">Cleveland Naps</a>. Fellow Southerners, Cobb and Jackson were personally friendly both on and off the field. Cobb used that friendship for his advantage.  Whenever Jackson said anything to him, he ignored him. When Jackson persisted, Cobb snapped angrily at Jackson, making him wonder what he could have done to enrage Cobb. As soon as the series was over, Cobb unexpectedly greeted Jackson and wished him well. Cobb felt that it was these mind games that caused Jackson to &#34;fall off&#34; to a final average of .408, while Cobb himself finished with a .420 average.<sup id="_ref-BaseballLibraryTyCobb_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BaseballLibraryTyCobb" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Cobb led the AL in numerous categories besides batting average, including 248 hits, 147 runs scored, 127 RBI, 83 stolen bases, 47 doubles, 24 triples, and a .621 slugging average. The only major offensive category in which Cobb did not finish first was home runs, where <a href="/wiki/Frank_Baker" id="w">Frank Baker</a> surpassed him 11-8. He was awarded another Chalmers, this time for being voted the AL MVP by the <a href="/wiki/Baseball_Writers_Association_of_America" id="w">Baseball Writers Association of America</a>.</p>
<p>The game that may best illustrate Cobb&#39;s unique combination of skills and attributes occurred on <a href="/wiki/May_12" id="w">May 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1911" id="w">1911</a>. Playing against the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Yankees" id="w">New York Yankees</a>, Cobb scored a run from first base on a single to right field, then scored another run from second base on a wild pitch. In the 7th inning, he tied the game with a 2-run double. The Yankee catcher began vociferously arguing the call with the <a href="/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)" id="w">umpire</a>, going on at such length that the other Yankee infielders gathered nearby to watch. Realizing that no one on the Yankees had called time, Cobb strolled unobserved to third base, and then casually walked towards home plate as if to get a better view of the argument. He then suddenly slid into home plate for the game&#39;s winning run.<sup id="_ref-BaseballLibraryTyCobb_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BaseballLibraryTyCobb" title="">[6]</a></sup> It was performances like this that led <a href="/wiki/Branch_Rickey" id="w">Branch Rickey</a> to say later that &#34;[Cobb] had brains in his feet.&#34;<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_15" id="w">May 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1912" id="w">1912</a>, Cobb assaulted Claude Lueker, a heckler, in the stands in New York. Lueker and Cobb traded insults with each other throughout the first three innings, and the situation climaxed when Lueker called Cobb a &#34;half-nigger&#34;. Cobb, in his discussion of the incident (<i>My Life in Baseball: The True Record</i>, Ty Cobb and Al Stump, Doubleday, 1961, pp.131-135), avoided such explicit words, but alluded to it by saying the man was &#34;reflecting on my mother&#39;s color and morals&#34;. Cobb also states in the book that he warned Highlanders manager <a href="/wiki/Harry_Wolverton" id="w">Harry Wolverton</a> that if something wasn&#39;t done about the man, there would be trouble. No action was taken. Finally, at the end of the sixth inning, and after being challenged by teammates Sam Crawford and Jim Delahanty to do something about it, Cobb climbed into the stands and attacked the handicapped Lueker, who due to an industrial accident had lost all of one hand and three fingers on his other hand. When onlookers shouted at Cobb to stop because the man had no hands, Cobb reportedly replied, &#34;I don&#39;t care if he has no feet!&#34;<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> The league suspended him, and his teammates, though not fond of Cobb, went on strike to protest the suspension, and to the lack of protection of players from abusive fans, prior to the <a href="/wiki/May_18" id="w">May 18</a> game in Philadelphia.<sup id="_ref-StumpPages208_209_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-StumpPages208_209" title="">[41]</a></sup> For that one game, Detroit fielded a replacement team made up of college and sandlot ballplayers, plus two Detroit coaches, and lost, 24-2. Some of major league baseball&#39;s all-time negative records were established in this game, notably the 26 hits allowed by <a href="/wiki/Allan_Travers" id="w">Allan Travers</a>, who pitched the sport&#39;s most unlikely <a href="/wiki/Complete_game" id="w">complete game</a>.<sup id="_ref-BaseballLibraryTravers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BaseballLibraryTravers" title="">[42]</a></sup> The strike ended when Cobb urged his teammates to return to the field. According to Cobb, this incident led to the formation of a players&#39; union, the &#34;Ballplayers&#39; Fraternity&#34; (formally the Fraternity of Professional Baseball Players of America), an early version of what is now called the <a href="/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Players_Association" id="w">Major League Baseball Players Association</a>, and garnered some concessions from the owners.<sup id="_ref-KossuthPartIII_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KossuthPartIII" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-StumpPages209_210_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-StumpPages209_210" title="">[44]</a></sup>
During Cobb&#39;s career, he was involved in numerous fights, both on and off the field, and several profanity-laced shouting matches.  For example, Cobb and umpire <a href="/wiki/Billy_Evans" id="w">Billy Evans</a> arranged to settle their in-game differences with a fistfight, to be conducted under the grandstand after the game.  Members of both teams were spectators, and broke up the scuffle after Cobb had knocked Evans down, pinned him, and began choking him.  Cobb once slapped a black elevator operator for being &#34;uppity.&#34; When a black night watchman intervened, Cobb pulled out a knife and stabbed him (The matter was later settled out of court).<sup id="_ref-NGECobb_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NGECobb" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#34;Sure, I fought,&#34; said an unrepentant Cobb in a revealing quote.  &#34;I had to fight all my life just to survive.  They were all against me.  Tried every dirty trick to cut me down, but I beat the bastards and left them in the ditch.&#34;</p>

<p>By {{by}}, <a href="/wiki/Babe_Ruth" id="w">Babe Ruth</a> had established himself as a power hitter, something Cobb was not considered.  When Cobb and the Tigers showed up in New York to play the Yankees for the first time that season, writers billed it as a showdown between two stars of competing styles of play.  Ruth hit two homers and a triple during the series, compared to Cobb&#39;s one single.</p>
<p>As Ruth&#39;s popularity grew, Cobb became increasingly hostile toward him.  Cobb saw Ruth not only as a threat to his style of play, but also to his style of life.  While Cobb preached ascetic self-denial, Ruth gorged on hot dogs, beer, and women.<sup id="_ref-Nation05082006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nation05082006" title="">[53]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-MF112006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MF112006" title="">[54]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-SPTimes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SPTimes" title="">[55]</a></sup>  Perhaps what angered him the most about Ruth was that despite Ruth&#39;s total disregard for his physical condition and traditional baseball, he was still an overwhelming success and brought fans to the ballparks in record numbers to see him set his own records.</p>
<p>After enduring several years of seeing his fame and notoriety usurped by Ruth, Cobb decided that he was going to show that swinging for the fences was no challenge for a top hitter.  On <a href="/wiki/May_5" id="w">May 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1925" id="w">1925</a>, Cobb began a two-game hitting spree better than any even Ruth had unleashed.  He was sitting in the <a href="/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)" id="w">dugout</a> talking to a reporter and told him that, for the first time in his career, he was going to swing for the fences.  That day, Cobb went 6 for 6, with two singles, a double, and three home runs.<sup id="_ref-BaseballLibMay1925_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BaseballLibMay1925" title="">[56]</a></sup>  His 16 total bases set a new AL record. The next day he had three more hits, two of which were home runs. His single his first time up gave him 9 consecutive hits over three games.  His five homers in two games tied the record set by <a href="/wiki/Cap_Anson" id="w">Cap Anson</a> of the old Chicago NL team in 1884.<sup id="_ref-BaseballLibMay1925_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BaseballLibMay1925" title="">[56]</a></sup> Cobb wanted to show that he could hit home runs when he wanted, but simply chose not to do so.  At the end of the series, 38-year-old Cobb had gone 12 for 19 with 29 total bases, and then went happily back to bunting and hitting-and-running.  For his part, Ruth&#39;s attitude was that &#34;I could have had a lifetime .600 average, but I would have had to hit them singles. The people were paying to see me hit home runs.&#34;<sup id="_ref-BaseballLibFrommer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BaseballLibFrommer" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_19" id="w">August 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1921" id="w">1921</a>, in the second game of a double header against <a href="/wiki/Elmer_Myers" id="w">Elmer Myers</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox" id="w">Boston Red Sox</a>, Cobb collected his 3,000th hit.

Cobb signed the deal on his 34th birthday for $32,500.  To say the least, the signing caught the baseball world off-guard.  Universally disliked (even by the members of his own team) but a legendary player, Cobb&#39;s management style left a lot to be desired.  He expected as much from his players as he gave, and most of the men did not meet his standard.<sup id="_ref-OReilly_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OReilly" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ngeorgiacobb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ngeorgiacobb" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>

<p>Cobb blamed his lackluster managerial record (479 wins-444 losses) on Navin, who was arguably an even more frugal man than Cobb.  Navin passed up a number of quality players that Cobb wanted to add to the team.  In fact, Navin had saved money by hiring Cobb to manage the team.</p>
<p>Also in 1922, Cobb tied a batting record set by <a href="/wiki/Wee_Willie_Keeler" id="w">Wee Willie Keeler</a>, with four five-hit games in a season.

<p>Cobb finally called it quits from a 22-year career as a Tiger in November <a href="/wiki/1926_in_sports" id="w">1926</a>.

<p>Cobb played regularly in 1927 for a young and talented team that finished second to one of the greatest teams of all time, the 1927 Yankees, which won 110 games.  He returned to Detroit to a tumultuous welcome on <a href="/wiki/May_11" id="w">May 11</a> 1927.  Cobb doubled in his first at bat, to the cheers of Tiger fans.  On <a href="/wiki/July_18" id="w">July 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1927" id="w">1927</a>, Cobb became the first player to enter the <a href="/wiki/4000_hit_club" id="w">4000 hit club</a> when he doubled off former teammate <a href="/wiki/Sam_Gibson" id="w">Sam Gibson</a> of the Detroit Tigers at <a href="/wiki/Navin_Field" id="w">Navin Field</a>.<sup id="_ref-BaseballLibraryTyCobb_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BaseballLibraryTyCobb" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

After Johnson hit Detroit&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ossie_Vitt" id="w">Ossie Vitt</a> with a pitch in August of 1915, seriously injuring him, Cobb realized that Johnson was fearful of hitting opponents.

<p>A personal achievement came in February 1936, when the first <a href="/wiki/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Hall of Fame</a> election results were announced.  Cobb had been named on 222 of 226 ballots, outdistancing Babe Ruth, <a href="/wiki/Honus_Wagner" id="w">Honus Wagner</a>, <a href="/wiki/Christy_Mathewson" id="w">Christy Mathewson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Walter_Johnson" id="w">Walter Johnson</a>, the only others to earn the necessary 75% of votes to be elected in that first year.

<p>By then, Cobb drank and smoked heavily, and spent a great deal of time complaining about the lack of fundamental skills with modern-day players.<sup id="_ref-NGECobb_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NGECobb" title="">[16]</a></sup>  Cobb had positive things to say about <a href="/wiki/Stan_Musial" id="w">Stan Musial</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phil_Rizzuto" id="w">Phil Rizzuto</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Jackie_Robinson" id="w">Jackie Robinson</a>, but few others.{{Fact}}  However, Cobb was known to help out young players.

<p>Cobb&#39;s competitive fires continued to burn after retirement. At the 1947 <a href="/wiki/Old_Timers_Game" id="w">Old Timers Game</a> in <a href="/wiki/Yankee_Stadium" id="w">Yankee Stadium</a>, Cobb warned catcher <a href="/wiki/Benny_Bengough" id="w">Benny Bengough</a> to move back, claiming he was rusty and hadn&#39;t swung a bat in almost 20 years.

<p>Another bittersweet moment in Cobb&#39;s life reportedly came in the late 1940s when he and sportswriter Grantland Rice were returning from the <a href="/wiki/The_Masters_Tournament" id="w">Masters</a> golf tournament.  Stopping at a South Carolina liquor store, Cobb noticed that the man behind the counter was &#34;Shoeless&#34; Joe Jackson, who had been banned from baseball almost 30 years earlier following the <a href="/wiki/Black_Sox" id="w">Black Sox</a> scandal.  But Jackson did not appear to recognize him, and finally Cobb asked, &#34;Don&#39;t you know me, Joe?&#34;  “Sure I know you, Ty,” replied Jackson, “but I wasn’t sure you wanted to speak to me.

His new wife was 40-year-old Frances Fairburn Cass, a <a href="/wiki/Divorcee" id="w">divorcee</a> from <a href="/wiki/Buffalo%2C_New_York" id="w">Buffalo, New York</a>.<sup id="_ref-TimeCobb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TimeCobb" title="">[75]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-StumpPage412_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-StumpPage412" title="">[76]</a></sup> This childless marriage also failed, and they divorced in 1956.<sup id="_ref-Time05211956_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Time05211956" title="">[77]</a></sup></p>
<p>When two of his three sons died young, Cobb was alone, with few friends left.  He began to be generous with his wealth, donating $100,000 in his parents&#39; name for his hometown to build a modern 24 bed hospital, <a href="/wiki/Cobb_Memorial_Hospital" id="w">Cobb Memorial Hospital</a>, which is now part of the <a href="/wiki/Ty_Cobb_Healthcare_System" id="w">Ty Cobb Healthcare System</a>.  He also established the <a href="/wiki/Cobb_Educational_Fund" id="w">Cobb Educational Fund</a>, which awarded scholarships to needy Georgia students bound for college, by endowing it with a $100,000 donation in 1953.<sup id="_ref-TyCobbMuseumPhilanthropy_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TyCobbMuseumPhilanthropy" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cobb knew that another way he could share his wealth was by having biographies written that would set the record straight and teach young players how to play. <a href="/wiki/John_McCallum_(author)" id="w">John McCallum</a> spent some time with Cobb to write a combination how-to and biography entitled <i>The Tiger Wore Spikes: An Informal Biography of Ty Cobb</i> that was published in 1956.<sup id="_ref-TigerWoreSpikes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TigerWoreSpikes" title="">[78]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-BaseballWithBrains_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BaseballWithBrains" title="">[79]</a></sup></p>
<p>After McCallum completed his research for the book, Cobb was again alone and had a longing to return to Georgia. In December of 1959, Cobb was diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/Prostate_cancer" id="w">prostate cancer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus" id="w">diabetes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hypertension" id="w">high blood pressure</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bright%26%2339%3Bs_disease" id="w">Bright&#39;s disease</a>, a degenerative kidney disorder.<sup id="_ref-NGECobb_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NGECobb" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-TyCobbMuseumDYK_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TyCobbMuseumDYK" title="">[80]</a></sup> He did not trust his initial diagnosis, however, so he went to Georgia to seek advice from doctors he knew, and they found his prostate to be cancerous. They removed it at <a href="/wiki/Emory_University" id="w">Emory University Hospital</a> in Atlanta, but that did little to help Cobb. From this point until the end of his life, Cobb criss-crossed the country, going from his lodge in Tahoe to the hospital in Georgia.</p>
<p>It was also during his final years that Cobb began work on his autobiography, <i>My Life in Baseball: The True Record,</i> with writer <a href="/wiki/Al_Stump" id="w">Al Stump</a>.  Their collaboration was contentious, and after Cobb&#39;s death, Al Stump&#39;s side of the story was described in some of his other works, including the film <i><a href="/wiki/Cobb_(film)" id="w">Cobb</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h2>Death</h2>
<p>In his last days, Cobb spent some time with the old movie comedian <a href="/wiki/Joe_E._Brown_(comedian)" id="w">Joe E. Brown</a>, talking about the choices Cobb had made in his life.  He told Brown that he felt that he had made mistakes, and that he would do things differently if he could.  He had played hard and lived hard all his life, and had no friends to show for it at the end, and he regretted it.  Publicly, however, Cobb claimed not to have any regrets: &#34;I&#39;ve been lucky. I have no right to be regretful of what I did.&#34;<sup id="_ref-NewsweekJuly1961_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NewsweekJuly1961" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p>He checked into Emory Hospital for the last time in June 1961, bringing with him a paper bag with over $1 million in <a href="/wiki/Bond_(finance)" id="w">negotiable bonds</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Luger_pistol" id="w">Luger pistol</a>.<sup id="_ref-Zacharias_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zacharias" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-StumpPage28_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-StumpPage28" title="">[82]</a></sup> His first wife, Charlie, his son Jimmy and other family members came to be with him for his final days.

<p>Approximately 150 friends and relatives attended a brief service in <a href="/wiki/Cornelia%2C_Georgia" id="w">Cornelia, Georgia</a>, and drove to the Cobb Family mausoleum in Royston for the burial.

<p>At the time of his death. Cobb&#39;s estate was reported to be worth at least US$11,780,000, including $10 million worth of <a href="/wiki/General_Electric" id="w">General Electric</a> stock and $1.78 million in <a href="/wiki/The_Coca-Cola_Company" id="w">Coke</a> stock.<sup id="_ref-NYT09031951_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT09031951" title="">[85]</a></sup> Cobb&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Will_(law)" id="w">will</a> left a quarter of his estate to the Cobb Educational Fund, and distributed the rest among his children and grandchildren.

<p>Efforts to create a Ty Cobb Memorial in Royston initially failed, primarily because most of the artifacts from his life were sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame in <a href="/wiki/Cooperstown%2C_New_York" id="w">Cooperstown, New York</a>, and the Georgia town was viewed as too remote to make a memorial worthwhile.  However, on <a href="/wiki/July_17" id="w">July 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a>, the 37th anniversary of Cobb&#39;s death, the <a href="/wiki/Ty_Cobb_Museum" id="w">Ty Cobb Museum</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Franklin_County_Sports_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Franklin County Sports Hall of Fame</a> opened its doors in Royston.  On that day, Cobb was one of the first members to be inducted into the Franklin County Sports Hall of Fame. On <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, his hometown hosted a 1905 baseball game to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Cobb&#39;s first major league game.  Players in the game included many of Cobb&#39;s descendants as well as many citizens from his hometown of Royston.  Another early-1900s baseball game was played in his hometown at Cobb Field on <a href="/wiki/September_30" id="w">September 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, with Cobb&#39;s descendants and Roystonians again playing. Cobb&#39;s personal <a href="/wiki/Batboy" id="w">batboy</a> from his major league years was also in attendance and threw out the <a href="/wiki/Ceremonial_first_pitch" id="w">first pitch</a>. A third Ty Cobb Vintage Baseball Game was played on <a href="/wiki/October_6" id="w">October 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>. Many of Cobb&#39;s family and other relatives were in attendance for a &#34;family reunion&#34; theme. Appearing at the game again was Cobb&#39;s personal batboy who, with his son and grandson, made a large donation and a plaque to the Ty Cobb Museum in honor of their family&#39;s relationship with the Cobb family.</p>

<p>Ty Cobb&#39;s legacy also includes legions of collectors of his early tobacco card issues as well as game used memorabilia and autographs.  Perhaps the most curious item remains the 1909 Ty Cobb with Ty Cobb Cigarettes back, leaving some to believe Cobb either had or attempted to have his own brand of cigarettes.  Very little about the card is known other than its similarity to the 1909 T206 Red Portrait card published by the American Tobacco Company, and until 2005 only a handful were known to exist.  That year, a sizable cache of the cards was brought to auction by the family of a Royston, Georgia man who had stored them in a book for almost 100 years.{{Fact}}.</p>
<a id="Crawford-Cobb_rivalry" name="Crawford-Cobb_rivalry"></a><h1>Crawford-Cobb rivalry</h1>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sam_Crawford" id="w">Sam Crawford</a> and Ty Cobb were teammates for parts of thirteen seasons.  They played beside each other in right and center field, and Crawford followed Cobb in the <a href="/wiki/Batting_order" id="w">batting order</a> year after year.  Despite the physical closeness, the two had a complicated relationship.</p>
<p>Initially, they had a student-teacher relationship.  Crawford was an established star when Cobb arrived, and Cobb eagerly sought his advice.  In interviews with <a href="/wiki/Al_Stump" id="w">Al Stump</a>, Cobb told of studying Crawford’s base stealing technique and of how Crawford would teach him about pursuing fly balls and throwing out base runners.  Cobb told Stump he would always remember Crawford’s kindness.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Sam Crawford and Ty Cobb clown around with a camera, circa 1908</div></div>
</p>
<p>The student-teacher relationship gradually changed to one of jealous rivals.{{Fact}}  Cobb was not popular with his teammates, and as Cobb became the biggest star in baseball, Crawford was unhappy with the preferential treatment given to Cobb.{{Fact}}  Cobb was allowed to show up late for spring training and was given private quarters on the road – perks not offered to Crawford.  The competition between the two was intense.  Crawford recalled that, if he went three for four on a day when Cobb went hitless, Cobb would turn red and sometimes walk out of the park with the game still on.  When it was initially (and erroneously) reported that <a href="/wiki/Nap_Lajoie" id="w">Nap Lajoie</a> had won the batting title, Crawford was alleged to have been one of several Tigers who sent a telegram to Lajoie congratulating him on beating Cobb.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup></p>
<p>In retirement, Cobb wrote a letter to a writer for <a href="/wiki/The_Sporting_News" id="w">The Sporting News</a> accusing Crawford of not helping in the outfield and of intentionally fouling off balls when Cobb was stealing a base.  Crawford learned about the letter in 1946 and accused Cobb of being a “cheapskate” who never helped his teammates.  He said that Cobb had not been a very good fielder, &#34;so he blamed me.&#34;  Crawford denied intentionally trying to deprive Cobb of stolen bases, insisting that Cobb had “dreamed that up.”<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup></p>
<p>When asked about the feud, Cobb attributed it to jealousy.  He felt that Crawford was “a hell of a good player,” but he was “second best” on the Tigers and “hated to be an also ran.”  Cobb biographer Richard Bak noted that the two “only barely tolerated each other” and agreed with Cobb that Crawford’s attitude was driven by Cobb’s having stolen Crawford’s thunder.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although they may not have spoken to each other, Cobb and Crawford developed an uncanny ability to communicate nonverbally with looks and nods on the base paths.  They became one of the most successful <a href="/wiki/Double_steal" id="w">double steal</a> pairings in baseball history.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>After Cobb died, a reporter found hundreds of letters in Cobb’s home that Cobb had written to influential people lobbying for Crawford’s induction into the Hall of Fame.  Crawford was reportedly unaware of Cobb’s efforts until after Cobb had died.<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>

<p>Independent researchers have raised questions from time to time about Cobb&#39;s exact career totals. Hits have been re-estimated at between 4,189 and 4,192.
