<p>The motorway, which was first proposed in the 1930s, and originally conceived as two separate routes, was built in stages between 1971 and 1976, with construction beginning at Pole Moor and finishing in <a href="/wiki/Tarbock" id="w">Tarbock</a>. The motorway also absorbed part of the Stretford-Eccles bypass, which was built between 1957 and 1960.

<a id="Origin_of_the_road" name="Origin_of_the_road"></a><h3>Origin of the road</h3>
<p>The origins of the M62 date back to the 1930s, where the need for a route between <a href="/wiki/Lancashire" id="w">Lancashire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire" id="w">Yorkshire</a> had been agreed after discussion by the respective highway authorities of the counties.<sup id="_ref-mcr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mcr" title="">[6]</a></sup> At the same time, it was envisaged that a route between Liverpool and Hull was also needed, connecting the two ports to industrial Yorkshire.<sup id="_ref-wry_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wry" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some years later, after <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Transport" id="w">Minister of Transport</a> appointed engineers to inspect road standards between the <a href="/wiki/A580_road" id="w">A580 road</a> in <a href="/wiki/Swinton%2C_Greater_Manchester" id="w">Swinton</a> and the <a href="/wiki/A1_road" id="w">A1 road</a> near <a href="/wiki/Selby" id="w">Selby</a>.<sup id="_ref-wry_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wry" title="">[7]</a></sup> In 1949, that year&#39;s Road Plan for South Lancashire specified the need for the <a href="/wiki/Dual_carriageway" id="w">dualling</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grade_separation" id="w">grade separation</a> of the <a href="/wiki/A580_road" id="w">A580 road</a>, and bypasses of both <a href="/wiki/Huyton" id="w">Huyton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cadishead" id="w">Cadishead</a>.<sup id="_ref-mersey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mersey" title="">[8]</a></sup> In 1952, the route for a trans-Pennine motorway, known as <b>The <a href="/wiki/Lancashire" id="w">Lancashire</a>-<a href="/wiki/Yorkshire" id="w">Yorkshire</a> Motorway</b>, was laid down, with <a href="/wiki/Ferrybridge" id="w">Ferrybridge</a> chosen as the eastern terminus rather than Selby.<sup id="_ref-wry_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wry" title="">[7]</a></sup> By the 1960s, however, the proposed dualling of the A580 in Lancashire was considered inadequate, and there was &#34;an urgent need&#34; to link Liverpool to the motorway network.<sup id="_ref-mersey_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mersey" title="">[8]</a></sup> The route of the Lancashire-Yorkshire motorway was also considered inadequate as it failed to cater for several industrial towns in Yorkshire.<sup id="_ref-wry_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wry" title="">[7]</a></sup> When James Drake visited the United States in 1962, his experience with the <a href="/wiki/Interstate_Highway_system" id="w">Interstate Highway system</a> led him to conclude that the <b>Merseyside Expressway</b>, planned only to run between Liverpool and the <a href="/wiki/M6_motorway" id="w">M6</a>, would need extending to the <a href="/wiki/M63_motorway" id="w">Stretford-Eccles Bypass</a>, thus creating a continuous motorway between Liverpool and <a href="/wiki/Ferrybridge" id="w">Ferrybridge</a> (a link between Ferrybridge and Hull was not considered until 1964).<sup id="_ref-archive_ouse_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-archive_ouse" title="">[9]</a></sup> Initially these plans were unpopular and unsupported by the <a href="/wiki/Department_for_Transport" id="w">Ministry of Transport</a>, but nevertheless the scheme was added to the Road Plan in 1963.<sup id="_ref-mersey_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mersey" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<a id="West_of_Manchester" name="West_of_Manchester"></a><h4>West of Manchester</h4>
<p>Originally, the section of the M62 west of <a href="/wiki/Manchester" id="w">Manchester</a> was intended to be a separate motorway linking <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" id="w">Liverpool</a> with <a href="/wiki/Salford" id="w">Salford</a>, but a continuous motorway between <a href="/wiki/Leeds" id="w">Leeds</a> and Liverpool was deemed to be more feasible,<sup id="_ref-pathetic_m52_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pathetic_m52" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-m602_cbrd_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-m602_cbrd" title="">[13]</a></sup> known as the <b>M52</b>.

<p>The section between Tarbock and Liverpool was the last section of the motorway to be completed, in 1976, due to the difficulties of building an urban motorway. In total, two <a href="/wiki/Viaduct" id="w">viaducts</a>, ten bridges and seven underpasses had to be constructed to secure the structural integrity of the surrounding residential area. The motorway, however, reached only as far as Queen&#39;s Drive (Junction 4), leaving the first three junctions unbuilt.<sup id="_ref-mersey_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mersey" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

In addition to passing Warrington, Manchester, Huddersfield, Halifax, Bradford, Leeds and Wakefield, the towns of Huyton, St Helens, Widnes, Bury, Rochdale, Dewsbury, Pontefract, Selby and Goole are designated as <a href="/wiki/Primary_status" id="w">primary destinations</a> along the road. The road is a terminus to two motorways: the <a href="/wiki/M57_motorway" id="w">M57 motorway</a> near Prescot and the <a href="/wiki/M18_motorway" id="w">M18 motorway</a> near <a href="/wiki/Rawcliffe%2C_East_Riding_of_Yorkshire" id="w">Rawcliffe</a>; and has four spur routes: the <a href="/wiki/M602_motorway" id="w">M602 motorway</a>, which serves Manchester, the <a href="/wiki/A627(M)_motorway" id="w">A627(M) motorway</a>, which serves Oldham and Rochdale, the <a href="/wiki/M606_motorway" id="w">M606 motorway</a>, which serves Bradford, and the <a href="/wiki/M621_motorway" id="w">M621 motorway</a>, which serves Leeds. Despite Hull being listed as a primary destination,<sup id="_ref-simj30_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-simj30" title="">[49]</a></sup> the motorway downgrades near North Cave, sixteen miles west.<sup id="_ref-mwdb_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mwdb" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-simj38_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-simj38" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>The motorway starts on Queen&#39;s Drive, on Liverpool&#39;s middle ring road. From there it runs eastward to Liverpool&#39;s outer ring road, the M57. The route has three exits for Warrington: Junction 8, which also houses Ikea,<sup id="_ref-simj8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-simj8" title="">[51]</a></sup> Junction 9, which interchanges with the <a href="/wiki/A49_road" id="w">A49 road</a>, originally intended to be a motorway itself,<sup id="_ref-simj9_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-simj9" title="">[52]</a></sup> and Junction 11. Between these is Junction 10, which is a <a href="/wiki/Stack_interchange#Cloverstack" id="w">cloverstack interchange</a> with the <a href="/wiki/M6_motorway" id="w">M6 motorway</a>. The M62 then crosses <a href="/wiki/Chat_Moss" id="w">Chat Moss</a> before interchanging with the <a href="/wiki/M60_motorway" id="w">M60 motorway</a>.<sup id="_ref-simuneven_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-simuneven" title="">[53]</a></sup> Due to original plans being to extend the section of the motorway into Manchester, motorists must turn off to stay on the route into Yorkshire.</p>

In Greater Manchester, the motorway shares seven junctions, 12 to 18, with the M60 motorway. Junction 13, which is signposted for Swinton, is situated only half a mile from Junction 12, leaving exiting motorists the hazard of crossing the still-merging M62 traffic.<sup id="_ref-simunj13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-simunj13" title="">[54]</a></sup>After this, there is Worsley Braided Interchange, which, in addition to serving Junctions 14 and 15, also serves Junctions 1 to 3 of the <a href="/wiki/M61_motorway" id="w">M61 motorway</a>, which terminates to <a href="/wiki/Preston" id="w">Preston</a>. </p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The M62 passes Scammonden Water in <a href="/wiki/West_Yorkshire" id="w">West Yorkshire</a>.</div>
Near Junction 22, the motorway gains a lane to climb Windy Hill,<sup id="_ref-simuneven_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-simuneven" title="">[53]</a></sup> before crossing the border into Yorkshire and interchanging with the rural A672 road, reaching the highest point of any motorway in England on the bridge. There is then a seven-mile travel through the Pennines to the next junction, passing Scammonden Water and Stott Hall Farm. The next junction is Junction 23, which is only accessible for westbound traffic. After this, the road dips through a valley to Junction 24<sup id="_ref-simj24_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-simj24" title="">[55]</a></sup> and drops slowly before interchanging with the A644 road at Junction 25.<sup id="_ref-simlorry_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-simlorry" title="">[56]</a></sup> Between Junctions 22 and 25, the road is used as a border between the metropolitan boroughs of <a href="/wiki/Calderdale" id="w">Calderdale</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kirklees" id="w">Kirklees</a>.<sup id="_ref-cmbc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cmbc" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>At Junction 26, named Chain Bar, the motorway interchanges with several roads: the M606 motorway, a spur into Bradford, the <a href="/wiki/A58_road" id="w">A58 road</a>, which runs between Prescot and <a href="/wiki/Wetherby" id="w">Wetherby</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/A638_road" id="w">A638 road</a>, which runs to Doncaster. The next junction also serves a spur route: the M621 motorway, before bypassing Leeds to the south to the interchange with the M1 motorway, Lofthouse Interchange, at Junction 29. East of Leeds, the motorway serves <a href="/wiki/Wakefield" id="w">Wakefield</a> at Junction 30 and crosses by the <a href="/wiki/River_Calder" id="w">River Calder</a>. At Junction 32a, the road is crossed by the <a href="/wiki/A1(M)_motorway" id="w">A1(M) motorway</a>, which also runs parallel to it for a short distance. The next junction serves the A162 road, previously the A1, and Ferrybridge service station. After Ferrybridge, the motorway becomes relatively flat, except for a mile-long bridge that crosses the <a href="/wiki/River_Ouse%2C_Yorkshire" id="w">River Ouse</a>. For approximately ten miles after this, the road runs towards Hull, serving <a href="/wiki/Howden" id="w">Howden</a> and North Cave, before downgrading to the A63 road.</p>
