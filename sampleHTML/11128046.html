The beginnings of Raëlian history goes back to the history of Raël, which concerns the origins of Raël, his personage, and his works, which developed from Claude Vorilhon.  The personage purportedly began as the result of encounters described in Raelian Messages, mainly from <i>The Book Which Tells the Truth</i> (1974) and <i>Extraterrestrials Took Me to their Planet</i> (1975).  None of these encounters is verified from a factual standpoint but they tie in to the beliefs of Raëlians.</p>
<p>Raëlian books are a primary source of Raël&#39;s history.  Translated portions of the original text are distributed freely worldwide in 33 languages through <a href="/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" id="w">HTTP</a>.<sup id="_ref-The Raelian Movement: Downloads_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Raelian Movement: Downloads" title="">[4]</a></sup>   Some of the books include the contents of multiple <a href="/wiki/Ra%C3%ABlian_Church" id="w">Raelian</a> books and have testimonials, footnotes, updates, and hyperlinks appended to them.  In addition to the Raëlian books, a Canadian sociologist named <a href="/wiki/Susan_J._Palmer" id="w">Susan J.

<p>According to Raëlian beliefs, on the morning of <a href="/wiki/December_13" id="w">December 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1973" id="w">1973</a> (<a href="/wiki/Julian_Date" id="w">Julian Date</a> 2442029),<sup id="_ref-GMT+1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GMT+1" title="">[6]</a></sup> Claude Vorilhon &#8212; who was at the time a professional test driver and automobile <a href="/wiki/Journalist" id="w">journalist</a> for the Autopop Magazine &#8212; had a first meeting with an extraterrestrial humanoid, an Eloha (plural: Elohim), who landed a UFO within an inactive volcano called <a href="/wiki/Fr:Puy_de_Lassolas" id="w">Puy de Lassolas</a> near the capital of <a href="/wiki/Auvergne_(region)" id="w">Auvergne</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> (<a href="/wiki/Clermont-Ferrand" id="w">Clermont-Ferrand</a>).<sup id="_ref-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 3-9._a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 3-9." title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Two days later, in the third meeting, an Eloha referred to <a href="/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)" id="w">similar</a> insignias: one engraved his spaceship and one on his spacesuit.  Both were formed by interlocked triangles which according to the Eloha, means &#34;as above, so below&#34; enclosing <a href="/wiki/Swastika" id="w">swastika</a> which means &#34;all is cyclic in infinite time&#34;. In Raëlism, the <a href="/wiki/Swastika" id="w">swastika</a> symbolizes, &#34;The choice between paradise, which the peaceful use of science makes possible, and the hell of returning to the primitive stage where humanity submits to nature instead of dominating and benefiting from it.&#34; This is the original emblem of the Raelian Movement which is used primarily in the African and Asian continents.<sup id="_ref-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 62._a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 62." title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Three days later, Claude Vorilhon meets Yahweh Elohim for the last time that year on a Tuesday. On that day, Vorilhon was given the name for the religious movement which he was to establish. The six-letter name is &#34;MADECH&#34;, which stands for &#34;<i>m</i>ouvement pour l‘<i>a</i>ccueil <i>d</i>es <i>E</i>lohim <i>c</i>réateurs de l’<i>h</i>umanité&#34; or &#34;movement for welcoming the Elohim, creators of humanity&#34;. It also stands for &#34;<i>M</i>oise <i>a</i> <i>d</i>evancé <i>E</i>lie et le <i>Ch</i>rist&#34; meaning &#34;<a href="/wiki/Moses" id="w">Moses</a> preceded <a href="/wiki/Elijah" id="w">Elijah</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Christ" id="w">Christ</a>&#34;.  The &#34;New Commandments&#34; presented to him on that Tuesday concerned the establishment of Geniocracy, Economic Humanitarianism, World Government, and his mission to catalyze these endeavors and to hasten the return of the Elohim<sup id="_ref-Elohim_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Elohim" title="">[9]</a></sup> to <a href="/wiki/Earth" id="w">Earth</a>.<sup id="_ref-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 104._a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 104." title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/September_19" id="w">September 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1974" id="w">1974</a>, Claude Vorilhon held his first public conference Paris, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> which attracted more than 2000 people.<sup id="_ref-Rael: Messenger of the Elohim_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rael: Messenger of the Elohim" title="">[11]</a></sup>  Soon after, Rael founded and began to establish MADECH.<sup id="_ref-Rael: Messenger of the Elohim_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rael: Messenger of the Elohim" title="">[11]</a></sup>  In <a href="/wiki/December_13" id="w">December 13</a>, this was brought into fruition as 170 MADECH members gathered at Puy de Lassolas and formed an organization of &#34;a president, a treasurer, and a secretary&#34; who each signed a 10,000 <a href="/wiki/Franc" id="w">franc</a> check payable towards the publication of the first Raëlian book.<sup id="_ref-Palmer, p. 37._a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Palmer, p. 37." title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Susan_J._Palmer" id="w">Susan J. Palmer</a> commented that in <i>UFO platform societies</i> like the MADECH organization, there was no obligation of membership and commitment like those found in cults, but rather an open place where people could freely exchange their views and relate their experiences on the subject of UFOs.  Only the first Raëlian book had surfaced at the time, and Palmer says it had comprised largely of a &#34;creation myth and eschatology&#34; but it had &#34;no rituals, no priesthood, no experiential dimension, and no coherent system of ethics&#34; which would lead to an organized movement that had any chance of committing to large projects guided by a leader.<sup id="_ref-Palmer, p. 57._a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Palmer, p. 57." title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/Fr:Place_de_la_R%C3%A9publique" id="w">Place de la République</a> in <a href="/wiki/March_1975" id="w">March 1975</a>, Claude Vorhilon staged a purging of leaders which hampered his own creativity.<sup id="_ref-Palmer, p. 38._a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Palmer, p. 38." title="">[14]</a></sup> In the following month, Claude Vorhilon called for a meeting of the MADECH organization, which held its headquarters in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>, and as its president, he conducted it with the intention to rid the organization from the kind of occultism and <a href="/wiki/Pseudoscience" id="w">pseudoscience</a> which contradicted his <a href="/wiki/Physicalism" id="w">physicalist</a> point of view.<sup id="_ref-Palmer, p. 37._b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Palmer, p. 37." title="">[12]</a></sup> In addition to this, the MADECH officials had an increasing desire to blend in with the rest of the <a href="/wiki/Ufologists" id="w">ufologists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Trekkies" id="w">trekkies</a> and were becoming less interested in the Raëlian view of <a href="/wiki/Elohim" id="w">Elohim</a> extraterrestrials.  A schism was becoming more apparent among the officials, and subsequently Vorilhon dismissed all of them.  Their positions were replaced by an inner circle of seven people whose mission was to inform the public of the Raëlian messages and to raise funds for building an <a href="/wiki/Ra%C3%ABlian_embassy_for_extraterrestrials" id="w">embassy for extraterrestrials</a>.<sup id="_ref-Palmer, p. 37._c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Palmer, p. 37." title="">[12]</a></sup>  Vorilhon says he resigned as president of MADECH by that June, because it seemed to him that MADECH could survive on its own and that he had made a mistake by structuring it into a form that he likened to a &#34;petanque club or a war veterans&#39; association.&#34;  Then he speaks of a personal desire to settle in the countryside and write an autobiography of events happening prior to his purported extraterrestrial encounters beginning in <a href="/wiki/December_13" id="w">December 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1973" id="w">1973</a>.<sup id="_ref-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143._a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143." title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>In his book <i>Intelligent Design</i>, Raël claims the following events occurred.  In <a href="/wiki/July_31" id="w">July 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a>, along with his wife Marie-Paul and a devoted MADECH member, François, Raël sights a UFO near his new home in the countryside near <a href="/wiki/Clermont-Ferrand" id="w">Clermont-Ferrand</a>,<sup id="_ref-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143._b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 142-143." title="">[15]</a></sup> the town he previously had lived in.<sup id="_ref-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 135._a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', p. 135." title="">[16]</a></sup>  The glowing craft performed aerial start-and-go maneuvers along a zigzag path.

According to him a spacecraft suddenly landed and shone a bright light behind a bush.  He said he then met the same extraterrestrial from his first encounter in <a href="/wiki/December_13" id="w">December 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1973" id="w">1973</a>. He said after a few words, he was taken up in that spacecraft with the Eloha and sent to a remote base relatively close to the solar system where he was given a resort-style relaxation treatment.<sup id="_ref-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 145-148._a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Raël, ''Intelligent Design'', pp. 145-148." title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>He said that on the morning of <a href="/wiki/October_8" id="w">October 8</a>, received a lecture from Yahweh Elohim about his current achievement towards the foundation of MADECH, the need for <a href="/wiki/Geniocracy" id="w">geniocracy</a>, Buddhism, and about the ideas of God and Soul, and later traveled to the Planet of the Eternals.  He said the planet orbited around a very large star and had a climate similar to the rain forests of Earth. He later claimed to have sat down with the Eloha and had a meal with the major prophets including Buddha, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed. He said that a guide showed him installations which houses machines for creating biological robots. He gave a picture of his mother to a machine which he claimed created similarly-appearing biological robot.  He said that in the night, he received an introduction to bedroom his future home at the Planet of the Eternals and was presented young, mature female biological robots. He said that before reaching a climax, he wore a helmet which plays music controlled by his thoughts which the females danced to.

<p>He said that on the morning of <a href="/wiki/October_9" id="w">October 9</a>, he took a scented bath and that soon after, Yahweh Elohim (an extraterrestrial) presented Claude Vorilhon to a machine which maximized his faculties. Yahweh Elohim then gave advice to him, the one who has become Claude Raël.

The first room served as an attraction for their proposed <a href="/wiki/Ra%C3%ABlian_embassy_for_extraterrestrials" id="w">Raëlian embassy for extraterrestrials</a>.  Audio visual presentations in six other rooms displayed teachings about the Raëlian message, sightings, and government cover-ups concerning UFOs.  In 2001, <i>UFOland</i> was closed to the public.  The reason given by the director for <i>UFOland</i> was that the revenue did not justify the costs—including two hour trips from Montreal.<sup id="_ref-Palmer, p. 65._a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Palmer, p. 65." title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
