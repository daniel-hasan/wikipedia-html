<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h2>Plot</h2>
<p>As Governor <a href="/wiki/Weatherby_Swann" id="w">Weatherby Swann</a> and his young daughter, <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Swann" id="w">Elizabeth</a>, sail to <a href="/wiki/Port_Royal" id="w">Port Royal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" id="w">Jamaica</a>, their ship, HMS <i><a href="/wiki/Dauntless_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" id="w">Dauntless</a></i> encounters a <a href="/wiki/Shipwreck" id="w">shipwreck</a> with a sole survivor, young <a href="/wiki/Will_Turner" id="w">Will Turner</a>. Elizabeth finds and takes a gold skull medallion from around the unconscious Will&#39;s neck and hides it, fearing he will be accused of piracy. She glimpses the ghostly ship, the <i><a href="/wiki/Black_Pearl" id="w">Black Pearl</a></i> disappearing into the mist. Eight years later, <a href="/wiki/James_Norrington" id="w">Captain James Norrington</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" id="w">Royal Navy</a> is promoted to <a href="/wiki/Commodore_(rank)" id="w">Commodore</a>. At his ceremony, he proposes to Elizabeth. Before answering, she faints and tumbles into the bay because the <a href="/wiki/Corset" id="w">corset</a> she was wearing was so tight that she had trouble breathing. The skull medallion she is wearing emits a mysterious pulse through the water. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, pirate <a href="/wiki/Captain_Jack_Sparrow" id="w">Captain Jack Sparrow</a> has arrived in Port Royal to commandeer a ship. Seeing Elizabeth fall, he rescues her. After the commodore comes to Elizabeth&#39;s aid and attempts to arrest Jack due to his well known status as a pirate, Jack escapes and ducks into a blacksmith shop where he encounters Will Turner, now a blacksmith&#39;s apprentice and self-taught expert swordsman. Following a duel with Turner, Jack is knocked unconscious by a third party in the fight, Will&#39;s sleeping master, and jailed. That night, Port Royal is besieged by the <i>Black Pearl</i> and its undead crew, called by Elizabeth&#39;s medallion. Elizabeth is captured and invokes <i>parley</i>&#8212;an agreement ensuring one&#39;s safety until meeting and negotiating with the opposing side. To protect her identity, Elizabeth tells Captain <a href="/wiki/Hector_Barbossa" id="w">Hector Barbossa</a> her last name is &#34;Turner&#34;. She negotiates for the pirates to cease the attack on Port Royal in exchange for the medallion. Barbossa agrees, but keeps Elizabeth prisoner, believing she is the key to breaking an ancient curse they are under.

Unable to persuade <a href="/wiki/James_Norrington" id="w">Commodore Norrington</a> to take immediate action, Will, who is in love with Elizabeth, persuades Jack to help him rescue Elizabeth in exchange for freeing him from jail. Jack agrees but only after learning Will&#39;s last name. They commandeer the HMS <i><a href="/wiki/Interceptor_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" id="w">Interceptor</a></i> and recruit a crew in <a href="/wiki/Geography_of_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean#Tortuga" id="w">Tortuga</a>. They set sail for <a href="/wiki/Isla_de_Muerta" id="w">Isla de Muerta</a>, a mysterious island to which the pirates have gone to break the curse. Along the way, Will learns that Jack was the <i>Black Pearl&#39;s</i> former captain. When Jack shared the bearings to an <a href="/wiki/Aztec" id="w">Aztec</a> treasure, First Mate Barbossa instigated a <a href="/wiki/Mutiny" id="w">mutiny</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marooning" id="w">marooned</a> Jack on an island. Jack escaped three days later, a feat no one was expecting. The pirates found and spent the treasure but soon learned it was cursed&#8212;rendering them into immortal skeletal beings whose true forms are only revealed in moonlight. The curse can only be lifted when every coin and each pirate&#39;s blood is returned to the chest. <a href="/wiki/William_%26quot%3BBootstrap_Bill%26quot%3B_Turner" id="w">William &#34;Bootstrap Bill&#34; Turner</a> sent a coin to his son, William, believing the crew should remain cursed for what they did to Jack. Barbossa had Bootstrap tied to a cannon and thrown overboard only to realize later his blood was also needed to break the curse; now, a Turner kin must take his place. Believing Elizabeth is Bootstrap&#39;s child, Barbossa poises her over the Aztec chest, anoints the last coin with her <a href="/wiki/Blood" id="w">blood</a> and drops it into the chest&#8212;the curse remains in effect. </p>
<p>On the island, Will suspects Sparrow may betray him and knocks him out. He rescues Elizabeth, and they escape to the <i>Interceptor</i>. A groggy Jack, found later by his muntinous crew, barters with Barbossa&#8212;in exchange for revealing Bootstrap&#39;s real child, as he wants to once again captain the <i>Black Pearl</i>. Jack&#39;s negotiations come to naught, however, when the <i>Pearl</i> pursues the <i>Interceptor</i>, sinking her and taking the crew captive. Onboard the Pearl, however, Jack learns the real reason why he was marooned ten years ago in a throwaway comment that Barbossa made, after he attempts to convince Barbossa to allow him to negotiate a peaceful return of the medallion. &#34;See, Jack, that was the attitude that lost you the Pearl in the first place. People are easier to search when they&#39;re dead.&#34; Will reveals that he is Bootstrap Bill&#39;s true offspring and demands that Elizabeth and the crew be freed. Otherwise, he threatens to shoot himself and fall overboard, lost forever. Barbossa agrees, noting again the lack of specifics with which their demands were made, and strands Elizabeth and Jack on a deserted island (the same island Jack was marooned on ten years before) and throws Jack&#39;s crew into the brig. Will is taken back to Isla de Muerta for the ritual. </p>
<p>Elizabeth burns a cache of abandoned <a href="/wiki/Rum" id="w">rum</a> to create a signal fire that is spotted by Norrington. She convinces Norrington to rescue Will by accepting his earlier marriage proposal. Arriving at the island, Norrington follows Jack&#39;s instructions and sets an ambush outside the cave while Jack goes inside and persuades Barbossa to form an alliance. He tells him to delay breaking the curse until after they have taken the <i><a href="/wiki/Dauntless_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" id="w">Dauntless</a></i> and killed the crew. Jack then sneaks a coin from the chest, rendering himself immortal. The <i>Black Pearl</i>&#39;s crew then take an underwater march towards the HMS <i>Dauntless</i>. After an exchange of comments, Jack reveals his true intentions when he knocks one of the <i>Black Pearl</i>&#39;s crew unconscious and, throwing the man&#39;s sword to Will, send the two of them into an attack against Barbossa and his remaining men. In the ensuing fight, Jack reveals that he is immortal, and continues dueling Barbossa, until Elizabeth makes an appearance and begins running towards the chest with Will just behind her. Seeing the opportunity, Jack tosses his bloodied coin at the chest, which Will catches, and then shoots Barbossa when Barbossa turned his gun on Elizabeth. It appears that Jack had wasted the one shot he&#39;d kept for ten years, until Will returns the last two medallions to the chest, breaking the curse. After he sees the blood stain on his shirt, he finally feels something stating, &#34;I feel...cold.&#34; No longer immortal, the fatally wounded Barbossa falls into the gold of Isla de Muerta, dead. Realizing they are no longer cursed, the now-mortal pirates surrender to the navy, while the ones recently stabbed fall down upon the deck of the <i>Dauntless</i>, dead. <div style="wigth:225px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:225px-Barbossa_Skeleton.jpg" title="Barbossa reveals himself to be cursed to Elizabeth"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/225px-Barbossa_Skeleton.jpg" alt="Barbossa reveals himself to be cursed to Elizabeth" title="Barbossa reveals himself to be cursed to Elizabeth" class="location-none type-thumb" width="225px" />

<p>After the fight, Jack requests to be taken back to his ship. However, his newly chosen crew from Tortuga had sailed off in the <i>Pearl</i>, after Jack previously informed them that, should a situation arise, &#39;keep to the code&#39;. Without a ship or other methods of transport away from the waiting navy, Will, Elizabeth and an unwilling Jack sail back towards the Navy. After returning to Port Royal, Jack is about to be executed. Believing Jack to be a good man, and deserving of life, Will first tells Elizabeth that he loves her while Jack&#39;s long list of crimes against the crown are cited out towards the English crowd by a disbelieving hangman. Afterwards, he makes an attempt to rescue Jack, which Elizabeth aids, due to her love for Will and her identical judgement of Jack&#39;s character. However, Jack and Will, although making valiant progress, are both re-captured by the troops and surrounded. But Elizabeth steps in, lending her support and declaring that she loves Will. Norrington releases her from their engagement, and Will is pardoned. Jack gives his version of a farewell to all those present, and escapes the Navy and their weapons by &#39;falling&#39; into the bay, after noting the presence of Cotton&#39;s parrot, one of Jack&#39;s Tortuga crew. Taking this as a sign that his ship is near, he makes his dramatic exit. His crew, who escaped with the <i>Black Pearl</i>, rescue him, and return to him his trademark tricorne hat and coat. With the whole crew present, Anamaria announces to Jack and the rest of the crew that Jack is, once again, the captain of the <i>Black Pearl</i>. On top of the cliff, Norrington is impressed enough to allow Jack one day&#39;s head start before giving pursuit.</p>
<p>After the credits the monkey Jack swims up to the treasure chest, takes a coin from the chest and becomes cursed once again.</p>

For budget reasons, the ships were built on docks, with only six days spent in the open sea for the battle between the <i>Black Pearl</i> and the <i>Interceptor</i>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The <i>Dauntless</i> and the <i>Black Pearl</i> were built on barges, with <a href="/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" id="w">computer-generated imagery</a> finishing the structures.<sup id="_ref-epic_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-epic" title="">[11]</a></sup> The <i>Black Pearl</i> was also built on the <a href="/wiki/Spruce_Goose#Postwar" id="w">Spruce Goose stage</a>, in order to control fog and lighting.<sup id="_ref-epic_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-epic" title="">[11]</a></sup> The <i>Interceptor</i> was a replica of the <i><a href="/wiki/Lady_Washington" id="w">Lady Washington</a></i>, fully repainted before going on a 40-day voyage beginning <a href="/wiki/December_2" id="w">December 2</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, arriving on location on <a href="/wiki/January_12" id="w">January 12</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> A miniature was also built for the storm sequence.<sup id="_ref-epic_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-epic" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h3>Production</h3>
<p>Shooting began on <a href="/wiki/October_9" id="w">October 9</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a> and wrapped by March 2003.<sup id="_ref-greg_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-greg" title="">[6]</a></sup> The quick shoot was only marred by two accidents: as Jack Sparrow steals the <i>Interceptor</i>, three of the ropes attaching it to the <i>Dauntless</i> did not break at first, and when they did snap debris hit Depp&#39;s knee, though he was not injured, and the way the incident played out on film made it look like Sparrow merely ducks. A more humorous accident was when the boat Sparrow was supposed to arrive in at Port Royal sank.<sup id="_ref-director_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-director" title="">[1]</a></sup> In October the crew was shooting scenes at Rancho Palos Verdes, by December they were shooting at St. Vincent and in January they were at the cavern set at Los Angeles.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> The script often changed with Elliott and Rossio on set, with additions such as Gibbs (<a href="/wiki/Kevin_McNally" id="w">Kevin McNally</a>) telling Will how Sparrow escaped from an island, strapping two turtles together with rope made of his back hair, and Pryce was written into the climactic battle to keep some empathy for the audience.<sup id="_ref-director_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-director" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Due to the quick schedule of the shoot, <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26amp%3B_Magic" id="w">Industrial Light &#38; Magic</a> immediately began visual effects work. While the skeletal forms of the pirates revealed by moonlight take up relatively little screentime, the crew knew their computer-generated forms had to convince in terms of replicating performances and characteristics of the actors, or else the transition would not work. Each scene featuring them was shot twice: a reference plate with the actors, and then without them to add in the skeletons,<sup id="_ref-perfection_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-perfection" title="">[7]</a></sup> an aesthetic complicated by Verbinski&#39;s decision to shoot the battles with handheld cameras.<sup id="_ref-director_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-director" title="">[1]</a></sup> The actors also had to perform their scenes again on the <a href="/wiki/Motion_capture" id="w">motion capture</a> stage.<sup id="_ref-epic_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-epic" title="">[11]</a></sup> With the shoot only wrapping up four months before release, Verbinski spent eighteen-hour days on the edit,<sup id="_ref-director_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-director" title="">[1]</a></sup> while at the same time spending time on six hundred effects shots, two hundred and fifty of which were merely removing modern sailboats from shots.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> He also had to quickly manage the score with <a href="/wiki/Klaus_Badelt" id="w">Klaus Badelt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hans_Zimmer" id="w">Hans Zimmer</a>, who headed 15 composers to finish the score quickly.<sup id="_ref-director_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-director" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h2>Reception</h2>
<p>Before its release, many had expected <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> to be a flop, as the pirate genre had not been successful for years, with <i><a href="/wiki/Cutthroat_Island" id="w">Cutthroat Island</a></i> (1995) a notable flop, that the film was based on a theme park ride, and that Johnny Depp rarely made a big film.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Walt Disney Pictures also took a big risk in allowing it to be the first <a href="/wiki/PG-13" id="w">PG-13</a> rated film by the studio, with one executive noting that she found the film too intense for her five-year old child.<sup id="_ref-talk_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-talk" title="">[3]</a></sup> Nonetheless, the studio was confident enough to add <i>The Curse of the Black Pearl</i> subtitle to the film in case sequels were made.<sup id="_ref-greg_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-greg" title="">[6]</a></sup> Their confidence paid off: <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</i> grossed approximately $47 million in its U.S. opening weekend, before grossing $305 million domestically in a worldwide total of approximately $654 million, becoming the fourth highest grossing film of 2003.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critics favourably received the film, as indicated by a 79% &#34;fresh&#34; rating on <a href="/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" id="w">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, with 153 positive reviews out of 193 listed.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Alan Morrison of <i><a href="/wiki/Empire_(magazine)" id="w">Empire</a></i> felt it was &#34;the best blockbuster of the summer&#34;, acclaiming all the comic performances despite his disappointment with the swashbuckling sequences.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Roger_Ebert" id="w">Roger Ebert</a> acclaimed Depp and Rush&#39;s performances, with &#34;It can be said that [Depp&#39;s] performance is original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, like this in any other movie... his behavior shows a lifetime of rehearsal.&#34; However, he felt the film went for too long,<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> a criticism shared by <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Turan" id="w">Kenneth Turan&#39;s</a> highly negative review, feeling it &#34;spends far too much time on its huge supporting cast of pirates (nowhere near as entertaining as everyone assumes) and on bloated adventure set pieces that redound to no one&#39;s credit&#34;, despite having also enjoyed Depp&#39;s performance.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>For his performance as <a href="/wiki/Jack_Sparrow" id="w">Captain Jack Sparrow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Depp" id="w">Johnny Depp</a> won Best Actor at the <a href="/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards" id="w">Screen Actors Guild Awards</a>, the <a href="/wiki/MTV_Movie_Awards" id="w">MTV Movie Awards</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Empire_Awards" id="w">Empire Awards</a>, and was also nominated but didn&#39;t win at the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Globe" id="w">Golden Globes</a>, the <a href="/wiki/BAFTA_Awards" id="w">BAFTA Awards</a> and the <a href="/wiki/76th_Academy_Awards" id="w">76th Academy Awards</a>, in which <i>The Curse of the Black Pearl</i> was also nominated for Makeup, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, and Visual Effects.
