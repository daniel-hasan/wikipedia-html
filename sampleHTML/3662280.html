<p>Humphreys started his career with <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C." id="w">Sheffield Wednesday</a> in 1996. Whilst with the club, he was loaned out to <a href="/wiki/Scunthorpe_United_F.C." id="w">Scunthorpe United</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cardiff_City_F.C." id="w">Cardiff City</a>. He left the club in 2001 and joined <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_United_F.C." id="w">Cambridge United</a> for a short period, after which he joined current club <a href="/wiki/Hartlepool_United_F.C." id="w">Hartlepool United</a>. He joined <a href="/wiki/Port_Vale_F.C." id="w">Port Vale</a> on loan in 2006.</p>
<a id="Childhood_and_early_career" name="Childhood_and_early_career"></a><h1>Childhood and early career</h1>
<p>Humphreys was introduced to <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">football</a> from an early age, his <a href="/wiki/Grandfather" id="w">grandfather</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Humphreys" id="w">Ernest Humphreys</a>, played for <a href="/wiki/Millwall_F.C." id="w">Millwall</a>, <a href="/wiki/Motherwell_F.C." id="w">Motherwell</a> and <a href="/wiki/St._Mirren_F.C." id="w">St. Mirren</a>. His dad, John Humphreys, also had trials with <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C." id="w">Sheffield United</a>.<sup id="_ref-tearstocheers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tearstocheers" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Humphreys grew up as a Sheffield United fan and joined their academy, which he described as a &#34;dream come true&#34;. However, they released him when we he was 13.<sup id="_ref-tearstocheers_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tearstocheers" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Humphreys then played for the Sheffield Boys and was one of their few players who did not play for a professional club. However, that soon changed when Humphreys was scouted by a <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C." id="w">Sheffield Wednesday</a> scout and he joined their centre of excellence.<sup id="_ref-tearstocheers_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tearstocheers" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Sheffield_Wednesday" name="Sheffield_Wednesday"></a><h1>Sheffield Wednesday</h1>
<p>In 1995, after leaving <a href="/wiki/Newfield_Secondary_School" id="w">Newfield Secondary School</a>, Humphreys became part of <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C." id="w">Sheffield Wednesday</a>’s <a href="/wiki/Youth_system" id="w">youth squad</a>. For the youth squad Humphreys played as a <a href="/wiki/Midfielder#Winger" id="w">left winger</a> and was offered a professional contract.<sup id="_ref-tearstocheers_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tearstocheers" title="">[2]</a></sup> Due to the injuries of strikers <a href="/wiki/David_Hirst" id="w">David Hirst</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mark_Bright" id="w">Mark Bright</a>, Wednesday manager <a href="/wiki/David_Pleat" id="w">David Pleat</a> gave Humphreys the opportunity to go on Wednesday’s <a href="/wiki/Season_%2528sports%2529#Pre-season" id="w">pre-season</a> tour of <a href="/wiki/The_Netherlands" id="w">the Netherlands</a>.<sup id="_ref-tearstocheers_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tearstocheers" title="">[2]</a></sup></p> 
<p>Humphreys played the first game and scored twice. He then played in the second game against <a href="/wiki/FC_Utrecht" id="w">FC Utrecht</a> and scored again. <a href="/wiki/Johan_Cruijff" id="w">Johan Cruijff</a> was the guest of honour for that game and he praised Humphreys and said he was the next <a href="/wiki/Marco_van_Basten" id="w">Marco van Basten</a>.<sup id="_ref-tearstocheers_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tearstocheers" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Humphreys dreams of Cardiff joy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Humphreys dreams of Cardiff joy" title="">[3]</a></sup> Humphreys pre-season form earned him a full league debut in Wednesday’s opening match against <a href="/wiki/Aston_Villa" id="w">Aston Villa</a>. In this match Humphreys scored a goal that was recorded at 95.9<a href="/wiki/Miles_per_hour" id="w">mph</a>, one of the hardest goals in the history of football.<sup id="_ref-The hardest recorded shot in football - ever_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The hardest recorded shot in football - ever" title="">[4]</a></sup> Humphreys also scored in the following match against <a href="/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C." id="w">Leeds United</a>. Two games later, Humphreys scored a much talked about goal when he went on a 50 yard run and scored a spectacular chipped goal against <a href="/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C." id="w">Leicester City</a>.<sup id="_ref-Mon 22nd Nov 1999 - Humpreys signs for City_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mon 22nd Nov 1999 - Humpreys signs for City" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Ritchie Humphreys CNNSI_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ritchie Humphreys CNNSI" title="">[6]</a></sup> Humphreys was seen as the driving force behind Sheffield Wednesday&#39;s shock early lead at the top of The Premiership.<sup id="_ref-The Managerial Merry-Go-Round_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The Managerial Merry-Go-Round" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

His performances earned him a place in the England team for the <a href="/wiki/1997_FIFA_World_Youth_Championship" id="w">1997 FIFA U-20 World Cup</a> in <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" id="w">Malaysia</a>.<sup id="_ref- Football: Shepherd strikes as England ride luck_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- Football: Shepherd strikes as England ride luck" title="">[8]</a></sup> Humphreys wore the much coveted <a href="/wiki/Number_9#In_sports" id="w">number 9 shirt</a> for that tournament. </p>
<p>For the next two seasons, after Sheffield Wednesday signed an influx of foreign players such as <a href="/wiki/Paulo_Di_Canio" id="w">Paulo Di Canio</a> and <a href="/wiki/Benito_Carbone" id="w">Benito Carbone</a>, Humphreys failed to hold down a regular place and he only played a total of 31 games in those two seasons.<sup id="_ref-Di Canio and Wednesday Set For Divorce_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Di Canio and Wednesday Set For Divorce" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Sheff Wed 1997/1998 player appearances_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sheff Wed 1997/1998 player appearances" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Sheff Wed 1998/1999 player appearances_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sheff Wed 1998/1999 player appearances" title="">[11]</a></sup> Humphreys was then sent on loan to <a href="/wiki/Cardiff_City_F.C." id="w">Cardiff</a> where he played 11 matches, scoring twice.<sup id="_ref-Mon 22nd Nov 1999 - Humpreys signs for City_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mon 22nd Nov 1999 - Humpreys signs for City" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Cardiff 1999/2000 player appearances_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cardiff 1999/2000 player appearances" title="">[12]</a></sup> He was then sent on loan to <a href="/wiki/Scunthorpe_United_F.C." id="w">Scunthorpe United</a> in August 1999,<sup id="_ref-PFA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFA" title="">[13]</a></sup> where he played six matches and again scored twice.<sup id="_ref-Scunthorpe 1999/2000 player appearances_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Scunthorpe 1999/2000 player appearances" title="">[14]</a></sup> After a brief return to the Wednesday side for the <a href="/wiki/2000-01_in_English_football" id="w">2000&#8211;01</a> season, Humphreys decided to leave Wednesday in order to play more first team football was allowed to join <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_United_F.C." id="w">Cambridge United</a> on trial.<sup id="_ref- Humphreys signs for Us_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- Humphreys signs for Us" title="">[15]</a></sup> Humphreys impressed on trial scoring 3 goals in 7 games and it looked likely that Cambridge manager <a href="/wiki/Roy_McFarland" id="w">Roy McFarland</a> was going to offer him a contract. However, Humphreys&#39; trial was cut abruptly after he broke his foot.<sup id="_ref-Humphreys joins Hartlepool on trial_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Humphreys joins Hartlepool on trial" title="">[16]</a></sup> After the sacking of Roy McFarland, new Cambridge manager <a href="/wiki/John_Beck" id="w">John Beck</a> was reluctant to offer Humphreys a new <a href="/wiki/Contract" id="w">contract</a> until he had seen him play.<sup id="_ref-Humphreys signs for Hartlepool_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Humphreys signs for Hartlepool" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

&#39; first season at the club would end in disappointment as he missed the decisive <a href="/wiki/Penalty_kick" id="w">penalty</a> in the <a href="/wiki/The_Football_League#The_Play-Offs" id="w">play-off</a> semi final defeat to <a href="/wiki/Cheltenham_Town_F.C." id="w">Cheltenham Town</a>, which cost Hartlepool a place in <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Second_Division" id="w">Division Two</a>.

<p>When Humphreys returned to pre-season training for the following season, he was playfully <a href="/wiki/Teasing" id="w">teased</a> over his penalty miss.<sup id="_ref-tearstocheers2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tearstocheers2" title="">[23]</a></sup> Humphreys took the motto &#34;that anything that doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger&#34; and was determined to come back stronger. Humphreys started the <a href="/wiki/2002-03_in_English_football" id="w">2002&#8211;03</a> season with a goal against <a href="/wiki/Carlisle_United_F.C." id="w">Carlisle</a> on the opening day of the season.<sup id="_ref- Carlisle 1-3 Hartlepool_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- Carlisle 1-3 Hartlepool" title="">[24]</a></sup> Throughout the course of the season, Humphreys would be played prominently as a left winger. Humphreys finished the season as an ever present in the Hartlepool squad, adding 11 goals to his name in the process and helped Hartlepool gain promotion to Division 2. His performances won him the Player of the Season award from the supporters.<sup id="_ref- Details - Ritchie Humphreys_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- Details - Ritchie Humphreys" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Humphreys takes top player honour_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Humphreys takes top player honour" title="">[26]</a></sup> During this season it was revealed that Humphreys had been writing a diary, which he published and named it &#34;From Tears to Cheers2, in reference to his tears at Cheltenham.<sup id="_ref-Humphreys looking for new chapter of success_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Humphreys looking for new chapter of success" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>The following two seasons once again saw Humphreys as an ever-present in the Hartlepool side under new manager <a href="/wiki/Neale_Cooper" id="w">Neale Cooper</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/2003-04_in_English_football" id="w">2003&#8211;04</a> season, Hartlepool once again made the play-offs, only to go out after conceding two last minute goals to <a href="/wiki/Bristol_City_F.C." id="w">Bristol City</a>, a memory which Humphreys described as more painful than Cheltenham.<sup id="_ref-Play-off heartache too much for Humphreys_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Play-off heartache too much for Humphreys" title="">[28]</a></sup> Due to the injuries of <a href="/wiki/Micky_Barron" id="w">Micky Barron</a>, Humphreys began regularly captaining the side.<sup id="_ref-Keep it up, skipper tells Boyd_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Keep it up, skipper tells Boyd" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/2004-05_in_English_football" id="w">2004&#8211;05</a> season, Humphreys helped Hartlepool once again make the play-offs. During the play-off semi-final against <a href="/wiki/Tranmere_Rovers_F.C." id="w">Tranmere</a>, Humphreys had the task of taking a penalty for Hartlepool in <a href="/wiki/Sudden_death_%2528sport%2529#Football_.28soccer.29" id="w">sudden death</a>. This was the first time Humphreys had taken a penalty since his crucial miss at Cheltenham.

Humphreys believes that of all the play-off defeats he has suffered that the controversial loss to Wednesday was the hardest to take.<sup id="_ref-Play-off loss a new low for Humphreys_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Play-off loss a new low for Humphreys" title="">[31]</a></sup> Before the end of the season Humphreys extended his contract by a further two years.<sup id="_ref- Humphreys caps a memorable week with new deal _b" class="reference"><a href="#_note- Humphreys caps a memorable week with new deal " title="">[30]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The following season, <a href="/wiki/2005-06_in_English_football" id="w">2005&#8211;06</a>, saw Humphreys become the first player to make 200 consecutive league appearances for Hartlepool.<sup id="_ref-Record breaker_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Record breaker" title="">[32]</a></sup> For this season Humphreys&#39; moved to <a href="/wiki/Defender_(football)" id="w">left back</a> due to <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Robertson" id="w">Hugh Robertson</a> being injured. Unfortunately Hartlepool and Humphreys suffered relegation. Despite this Humphreys was named the  Supporters and Players&#39; Player of the Season as well as the North East Football Awards Football League Player of the Season.<sup id="_ref-8: Ritchie Humphreys_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8: Ritchie Humphreys" title="">[33]</a></sup> </p>
<p>For the <a href="/wiki/2006-07_in_English_football" id="w">2006&#8211;07</a> season, <a href="/wiki/Danny_Wilson_(footballer)" id="w">Danny Wilson</a> was appointed the new manager, Wilson had previously managed Humphreys at Sheffield Wednesday. On <a href="/wiki/22_August" id="w">22 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, Humphreys was dropped for Hartlepool’s match against <a href="/wiki/Hereford_United_F.C." id="w">Hereford United</a>. After making 230 consecutive appearances, this was the first time Humphreys had not played since October 2001. Shortly after that match, Humphreys joined <a href="/wiki/Port_Vale_F.C." id="w">Port Vale</a> on a month&#39;s loan.<sup id="_ref-Humphreys leaves Pools_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Humphreys leaves Pools" title="">[34]</a></sup> This was the third time that Danny Wilson had loaned Humphreys out during his career, the only times Humphreys had ever been loaned out. Port Vale tried to extend Humphreys&#39; loan deal by at least another month,<sup id="_ref-Port Vale keen to keep Humphreys_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Port Vale keen to keep Humphreys" title="">[35]</a></sup> but Hartlepool refused and Humphreys returned. Humphreys later stated that he had no intentions of leaving Hartlepool.<sup id="_ref-Good to be back says Humphreys_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Good to be back says Humphreys" title="">[36]</a></sup> </p>
<p>After a bad start to the season, Hartlepool were struggling near the lower reaches of the table. However, this changed against <a href="/wiki/Accrington_Stanley_F.C." id="w">Accrington Stanley</a> when Humphreys scored a spectacular last minute winner.<sup id="_ref- Post Pilgrim Papers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note- Post Pilgrim Papers" title="">[37]</a></sup> This sent Hartlepool on 23 match unbeaten streak. During that streak, Humphreys scored another spectacular goal against <a href="/wiki/Walsall_F.C." id="w">Walsall</a> to give Hartlepool the lead in a victory that sent them into second place.<sup id="_ref-Humphreys left foot sets Pools apart from the rest_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Humphreys left foot sets Pools apart from the rest" title="">[38]</a></sup> Hartlepool would remain in the top two for the remainder of the season and secured promotion, narrowly missing out on the title. Humphreys performances earned him a place in the League Two PFA Team of the Year.<sup id="_ref-Ronaldo secures PFA awards double _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ronaldo secures PFA awards double " title="">[39]</a></sup> Humphreys was also awarded the <a href="/wiki/Monkey_Business" id="w">Monkey Business</a> Achievement Award for this contribution to the season.<sup id="_ref-Nelson and Liddle Big Winners_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nelson and Liddle Big Winners" title="">[40]</a></sup> However these awards proved small in comparison to when Humphreys was <a href="/wiki/Orders%2C_decorations%2C_and_medals_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">honoured</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen</a> for making a &#34;significant contribution to local and national life&#34; earlier on in the season.<sup id="_ref-Humphreys is pride of Hartlepool_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Humphreys is pride of Hartlepool" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
