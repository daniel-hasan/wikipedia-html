The Bergs were never religiously observant, although being <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jewish</a> did contribute to Moe&#39;s sense of being an outsider in mid-<a href="/wiki/Twentieth_century" id="w">twentieth century</a> America.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Casey_Stengel" id="w">Casey Stengel</a> once described Berg as &#34;the strangest man ever to play baseball.&#34;<sup id="_ref-SABR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SABR" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>A graduate of <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton University</a> and <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Law_School" id="w">Columbia Law School</a>, Berg <a href="/wiki/Polyglot_(person)" id="w">spoke several languages</a> and regularly read 10 newspapers a day. His reputation was fueled by his successful appearances as a contestant on the radio <a href="/wiki/Quiz_show" id="w">quiz show</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Information%2C_Please!" id="w">Information, Please!</a></i>. Berg answered questions about the derivation of words and names from <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a>, historical events in Europe and the Far East, and ongoing international conferences.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>As an agent of the United States government, Berg traveled to <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" id="w">Yugoslavia</a> to gather intelligence on resistance groups the government was considering supporting. He was then sent on a mission to <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>, where he interviewed various physicists concerning the <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> nuclear program. After the war, Berg was occasionally employed by the OSS&#39;s successor, the <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" id="w">Central Intelligence Agency</a>, but was unemployed by the mid-1950s. He spent the last two decades of his life without work, living with various siblings.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Moe Berg was born the third and last child of Bernard Berg, a <a href="/wiki/Pharmacist" id="w">pharmacist</a>, and Rose Tashker, a homemaker, both Jewish, in the <a href="/wiki/Harlem" id="w">Harlem</a> section of <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>, a few blocks from the <a href="/wiki/Polo_Grounds" id="w">Polo Grounds</a>. When Berg was three and a half, he begged his mother to let him start school. In 1906, Bernard Berg bought a pharmacy in <a href="/wiki/Newark%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">West Newark</a>. In 1910 the Berg family moved again, to the <a href="/wiki/Roseville%2C_Newark%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Roseville</a> section of Newark. Roseville offered Bernard Berg everything he wanted in a neighborhood &#8212; good schools, middle-class residents, and very few Jews.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Berg began playing baseball, at the age of seven, for the Roseville <a href="/wiki/Methodist_Episcopal_Church" id="w">Methodist Episcopal Church</a> baseball team under the less ethnic pseudonym Runt Wolfe. In 1918, at the age of 16, Berg graduated from <a href="/wiki/Barringer_High_School" id="w">Barringer High School</a>. During his senior season, the <i><a href="/wiki/Newark_Star-Ledger" id="w">Newark Star-Eagle</a></i> selected a nine-man &#34;dream team&#34; for <a href="/wiki/1918_in_sports" id="w">1918</a> from the city&#39;s best prep and public high school baseball players, and Berg was named the team&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Third_baseman" id="w">third baseman</a>. Barringer was the first in a series of institutions Berg joined in his life where his religion made him unusual. Most of the other students were East Side Italian Catholics or Protestants from <a href="/wiki/Forest_Hill%2C_Newark%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Forest Hill</a>, but there were not many Jews, just as Bernard wanted it.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>After graduating from Barringer, Berg enrolled in <a href="/wiki/New_York_University" id="w">New York University</a>. He spent two semesters there and played baseball and <a href="/wiki/Basketball" id="w">basketball</a>. In 1919, he transferred to <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton University</a> and never again mentioned that he attended NYU for a year, presenting himself exclusively as a Princeton man.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Berg received a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts" id="w">B.A.</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latin_honors" id="w">magna cum laude</a> in modern languages. He had studied seven languages: Latin, Greek, <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" id="w">Spanish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italian_language" id="w">Italian</a>, <a href="/wiki/German_language" id="w">German</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sanskrit_language" id="w">Sanskrit</a>.

During his freshman year, Berg played <a href="/wiki/First_baseman" id="w">first base</a> on an undefeated team. Beginning in his sophomore year, he was the starting <a href="/wiki/Shortstop" id="w">shortstop</a>. He was not a great hitter and was a slow baserunner, but he had a strong, accurate throwing arm and sound baseball instincts. In his senior season, he was captain of the team and had a .337 <a href="/wiki/Batting_average" id="w">batting average</a>, batting .611 against Princeton&#39;s arch-rivals, <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" id="w">Harvard</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" id="w">Yale</a>. Crossan Cooper, Princeton&#39;s second baseman, and Berg communicated plays in Latin when there was a man on second base.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_26" id="w">June 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a>, Yale defeated Princeton 5 – 1 at <a href="/wiki/Yankee_Stadium" id="w">Yankee Stadium</a> to win the <a href="/wiki/Big_Three_(colleges)" id="w">Big Three</a> title. Berg had an outstanding day, getting two hits in four <a href="/wiki/At_bat" id="w">at bats</a> (2 – 4) with a <a href="/wiki/Single_(baseball)" id="w">single</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Double_(baseball)" id="w">double</a>, and making several marvelous plays at shortstop. Both the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants" id="w">New York Giants</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers" id="w">Brooklyn Robins</a> desired &#34;Jewish blood&#34; on their teams, to appeal to the large Jewish community in New York, and expressed interest in Berg. The Giants were especially interested, but they already had two future <a href="/wiki/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Hall of Famers</a> at shortstop, <a href="/wiki/Dave_Bancroft" id="w">Dave &#34;Beauty&#34; Bancroft</a> and <a href="/wiki/Travis_Jackson" id="w">Travis Jackson</a>. The Robins were a mediocre team, where Berg would have a better chance to play. On <a href="/wiki/June_27" id="w">June 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a>, Berg signed his first big league contract for $5,000 with the Robins.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>Berg&#39;s first game with the Robins came the very next day against the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies" id="w">Philadelphia Phillies</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Baker_Bowl" id="w">Baker Bowl</a>. Berg came in at the start of the seventh inning, replacing <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Ruether" id="w">Dutch Ruether</a>, when the Robins were winning 13 – 4. Berg handled five chances without an <a href="/wiki/Error_(baseball)" id="w">error</a> and caught a line drive to start a game-ending <a href="/wiki/Double_play" id="w">double play</a>. He ended up going 1 – 1, getting a single up the middle off of <a href="/wiki/Clarence_Mitchell_(baseball)" id="w">Clarence Mitchell</a>, and scoring a run.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> For the season, Berg batted .186 and made 22 errors in 47 games.<sup id="_ref-br_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-br" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the season ended, Berg took his first trip abroad, sailing from New York to <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>. He settled in the <a href="/wiki/Quartier_Latin" id="w">Latin Quarter</a> in an apartment that overlooked the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Paris" id="w">Sorbonne</a>, where he enrolled in 22 different classes.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> In Paris he developed a habit he kept for the rest of his life: reading several newspapers daily.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Until Berg finished reading a paper, he considered it &#34;alive&#34; and refused to let anyone else touch it. When he was finished with it, he would consider the paper &#34;dead&#34; and anybody could read it.<sup id="_ref-SABR_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SABR" title="">[3]</a></sup> In January <a href="/wiki/1924_in_sports" id="w">1924</a>, instead of heading back to New York and getting himself into shape for the upcoming baseball season, Berg toured Italy and <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>During <a href="/wiki/Spring_training" id="w">spring training</a> at the Robins facility in <a href="/wiki/Clearwater%2C_Florida" id="w">Clearwater</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, Manager <a href="/wiki/Wilbert_Robinson" id="w">Wilbert Robinson</a> could see that Berg&#39;s hitting had not improved, and optioned him to the <a href="/wiki/Minneapolis_Millers" id="w">Minneapolis Millers</a> of the <a href="/wiki/American_Association_(20th_century)" id="w">American Association</a>. Berg did not take the demotion well and threatened to quit baseball, but by mid-April he reported to the Millers. Berg did very well once he became the Millers regular third baseman, hitting close to .330, but in July his average plummeted and he was back on the bench. On <a href="/wiki/August_19" id="w">August 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1924" id="w">1924</a> Berg was loaned to the <a href="/wiki/Toledo_Mud_Hens" id="w">Toledo Mud Hens</a>, a poor team ravaged by injuries. Berg was immediately inserted into the lineup at shortstop when Rabbit Helgeth refused to pay a $10 fine for poor play and was suspended. Major league scout <a href="/wiki/Mike_Gonzalez" id="w">Mike Gonzalez</a> sent a telegram to the Dodgers evaluating Berg with the curt, but now famous, line, &#34;Good field, no hit.&#34; Berg finished the season with a .264 average.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>By April <a href="/wiki/1925_in_sports" id="w">1925</a>, he was starting to show promise as a hitter with the Reading Keystones of the <a href="/wiki/International_League" id="w">International League</a>. Because of his .311 batting average and 124 <a href="/wiki/Run_batted_in" id="w">RBIs</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox" id="w">White Sox</a> exercised their option they had with Reading, paying $6,000 for him, and moved Berg up to the big leagues the following year.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Career_as_a_catcher_(1926_%E2%80%93_34)" name="Career_as_a_catcher_(1926_%E2%80%93_34)"></a><h3>Career as a catcher (1926 – 34)</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/1926_in_sports" id="w">1926</a> season began with Berg informing the White Sox that he would skip spring training and the first two months of the season to complete his first year of law school at <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" id="w">Columbia University</a>, and Berg did not join the White Sox until May 28. <a href="/wiki/Bill_Hunnefield_(baseball_player)" id="w">Bill Hunnefield</a> was signed by the White Sox to take Berg&#39;s place at shortstop, and was having a very good year, batting over .300. Playing in only 41 games, Berg batted a lowly .221.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Berg returned to Columbia after the season to continue working on his law degree. Despite <a href="/wiki/Charles_Comiskey" id="w">Charles Comiskey</a> offering him more money to come to spring training, Berg declined, and informed the White Sox that he would be reporting late for the 1927 season. Noel Dowling, a professor to whom Berg explained his situation, told Berg to take extra classes in the fall, and said that he would arrange with the dean a leave of absence from law school the following year, 1928.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because he reported late, Berg spent the first three months of the season on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to <a href="/wiki/Catcher" id="w">catchers</a> <a href="/wiki/Ray_Schalk" id="w">Ray Schalk</a>, Harry McCurdy, and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Yankees" id="w">New York Yankees</a>. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher <a href="/wiki/Ted_Lyons" id="w">Ted Lyons</a> refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him who he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>In Berg&#39;s debut as a starting catcher, he not only had to worry about catching Lyons&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Knuckleball" id="w">knuckleball</a>, but also about facing the Yankees&#39; <a href="/wiki/Murderers%26%2339%3B_Row" id="w">Murderers&#39; Row</a> lineup, which included <a href="/wiki/Babe_Ruth" id="w">Babe Ruth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lou_Gehrig" id="w">Lou Gehrig</a> and <a href="/wiki/Earle_Combs" id="w">Earle Combs</a>. Lyons beat the Yankees 6-3, holding Ruth hitless. Berg made the defensive play of the game when he caught a poor throw from the outfield, spun and tagged out <a href="/wiki/Joe_Dugan" id="w">Joe Dugan</a> at the plate. Berg caught eight more times during the final month and a half of the season.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>To prepare for the 1928 season, Berg traveled to a lumber camp in New York&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Adirondack_Mountains" id="w">Adirondack Mountains</a> three weeks prior to reporting to the White Sox spring training facility in <a href="/wiki/Shreveport%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Shreveport</a>, <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a>. The hard labor did wonders for him, as he reported to spring training on <a href="/wiki/March_2" id="w">March 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1928_in_sports" id="w">1928</a> in excellent shape. By the end of the season, Berg had established himself as the starting catcher.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>At law school, Berg failed Evidence and did not graduate with the Class of 1929, but he did pass the New York State <a href="/wiki/Bar_examination" id="w">bar exam</a>.

<p>Berg was back in the starting lineup on <a href="/wiki/May_23" id="w">May 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1930" id="w">1930</a>, but his knee would not allow him to play every day. He ended up getting into only 20 games the whole season and finished with a .115 batting average. During the winter, he took a job with the respected <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street" id="w">Wall Street</a> law firm, Satterlee and Canfield (now Satterlee, Stephens, Burke &#38; Burke). The <a href="/wiki/Cleveland_Indians" id="w">Cleveland Indians</a> picked up Berg on <a href="/wiki/April_2" id="w">April 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1931_in_sports" id="w">1931</a> when Chicago put him on waivers, but he only played in 10 games, and had 13 at bats and only 1 hit for the entire season.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_21" id="w">February 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1939" id="w">1939</a>, Berg made his first of three appearances on the radio quiz show, <i>Information, Please!</i>. After missing the first question, Berg put on a dazzling performance.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Of his appearance, <a href="/wiki/Kenesaw_Mountain_Landis" id="w">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> told him, &#34;Berg, in just thirty minutes you did more for baseball than I&#39;ve done the entire time I&#39;ve been commissioner.&#34;<sup id="_ref-D1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-D1" title="">[33]</a></sup> On his third appearance, <a href="/wiki/Clifton_Fadiman" id="w">Clifton Fadiman</a>, the moderator, started asking Berg too many personal questions.

<a id="Spying_for_the_U.S._Government" name="Spying_for_the_U.S._Government"></a><h3>Spying for the U.S. Government</h3>
<p>With the <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" id="w">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> by the Japanese on <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, the United States was thrust into <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>. To do his part for the war effort, Berg accepted a position with <a href="/wiki/Nelson_Rockefeller" id="w">Nelson Rockefeller</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Inter-American_Affairs" id="w">Office of Inter-American Affairs</a> on <a href="/wiki/January_5" id="w">January 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>. Nine days later, his father, Bernard, died.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> During the summer of 1942, Berg screened the footage he shot of Tokyo Bay for intelligence officers of the <a href="/wiki/Military_of_the_United_States" id="w">United States military</a>. The film may or may not have helped <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel" id="w">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Doolittle" id="w">Jimmy Doolittle</a> plan his famous <a href="/wiki/Doolittle_Raid" id="w">Doolittle Raid</a>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>From August 1942 until February 1943, Berg was on assignment in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" id="w">Caribbean</a> and <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South America</a>. His job was to monitor the health and physical fitness of the American troops stationed there. Berg, along with several other OIAA agents, left in June 1943 because they thought South America posed little threat to the United States, and they wanted to be someplace where their talents would be put to better use.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_2" id="w">August 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a>, Berg accepted a position with the <a href="/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services" id="w">Office of Strategic Services</a> for a salary of $3,800 a year. In September, he was assigned to the <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_(OSS)" id="w">Secret Intelligence</a> branch of the OSS and given a place at the OSS Balkans desk. In this role, he parachuted into <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia#Yugoslavia during the Second World War" id="w">Yugoslavia</a> to evaluate the various resistance groups operating against the Nazis to determine which was the strongest. He talked to both <a href="/wiki/Draza_Mihajlovic" id="w">Draza Mihajlovic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Josip_Broz_Tito" id="w">Josip Broz</a> and reviewed their forces, deciding that Josip Broz had the stronger and better supported group. His evaluations were used to help determine the amount of support and aid to give each group.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> In late 1943, Berg was assigned to Project Larson, an OSS operation set up by OSS Chief of Special Projects John Shaheen. The stated purpose of the project was to kidnap Italian <a href="/wiki/Rocket" id="w">rocket</a> and <a href="/wiki/Missile" id="w">missile</a> specialists out of Italy and bring them to the U.S. However, there was another project hidden within Larson called Project AZUSA with the goal of interviewing Italian <a href="/wiki/Physics" id="w">physicists</a> to see what they knew about <a href="/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg" id="w">Werner Heisenberg</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_von_Weizs%C3%A4cker" id="w">Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker</a>. It was similar in scope and mission to the <a href="/wiki/Operation_Alsos" id="w">Alsos</a> project.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>From May to mid-December, Berg hopped around Europe interviewing physicists and trying to convince several to leave Europe and work in America. At the beginning of December news about Heisenberg giving a lecture in <a href="/wiki/Zurich" id="w">Zurich</a>, <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a> reached the OSS, and Berg was assigned the task of attending the lecture and determining &#34;if anything Heisenberg said convinced him the Germans were close to a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" id="w">bomb</a>.&#34; If Berg came to the conclusion that the Germans were close, he had orders to shoot Heisenberg; Berg determined that the Germans were not close. During his time in Switzerland, Berg became close friends with the physicist <a href="/wiki/Paul_Scherrer" id="w">Paul Scherrer</a>. Berg returned to the United States on <a href="/wiki/April_25" id="w">April 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>, and resigned from the Strategic Services Unit, the successor to the OSS, in August. He was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom" id="w">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> on October 10, but he rejected the award on December 2. His sister later accepted it on his behalf after he died.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<a id="After_World_War_II" name="After_World_War_II"></a><h3>After World War II</h3>
<p>In 1952, Berg was hired by the CIA to use his old contacts from World War II to gather information about Soviet atomic science. For the $10,000 plus expenses that Berg received, the CIA got nothing in return. The CIA officer who spoke with Berg when he returned from Europe said that he was &#34;flaky.&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>For the next 20 years, Berg had no real job, living off friends and relatives who put up with him because of his great charm. When they would ask what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> He lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up.<sup id="_ref-SABR_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SABR" title="">[3]</a></sup> After being evicted from his brother&#39;s home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained for the rest of his life.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>He received a handful of votes in <a href="/wiki/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> voting (4 in 1958, and 5 in 1960).</p>
<p>Berg was dark, heavy-featured, mysterious, <a href="/wiki/Sybaritic" id="w">sybaritic</a>, courageous, and impeccably mannered. Women were attracted to the cultured, lifelong bachelor. When he was criticized for &#34;wasting&#34; his intellectual talent on the sport he loved, Berg replied: &#34;I&#39;d rather be a ballplayer than a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.&#34;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Moe_Berg_1902" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Moe_Berg_1902">http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Moe_Berg_1902</a></p>
<p>Berg received many requests to write his memoirs, but turned them down; he almost wrote them in 1960, but he quit after the co-writer assigned to him confused him with <a href="/wiki/Moe_Howard" id="w">Moe Howard</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Three_Stooges" id="w">Three Stooges</a>.<sup id="_ref-SABR_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SABR" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Moe Berg died on <a href="/wiki/May_29" id="w">May 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/1972" id="w">1972</a>, at age 70, from injuries sustained in a fall at home. A nurse at the Newark, New Jersey hospital where he died recalled his final words as, &#34;How did the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Mets" id="w">Mets</a> do today?&#34; (They won.)<sup id="_ref-Retrosheet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Retrosheet" title="">[44]</a></sup> His remains were cremated and spread over <a href="/wiki/Mount_Scopus" id="w">Mount Scopus</a> in <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a>. It has been said he really did want to write his memoirs; however, his death precluded that. Thus, much of his life remained a mystery that he took to the grave with him.</p>
<p>Berg was inducted into the <a href="/wiki/National_Jewish_Sports_Hall_of_Fame" id="w">National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame</a> in <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a>,<sup id="_ref-NJHOF_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NJHOF" title="">[45]</a></sup> and the <a href="/wiki/Baseball_Reliquary" id="w">Baseball Reliquary</a>’s Shrine of the Eternals in 2000.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> His is the only <a href="/wiki/Baseball_card" id="w">baseball card</a> on display at the headquarters of the <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" id="w">Central Intelligence Agency</a>.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
