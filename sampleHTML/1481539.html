<b>Kevin Peter Pietersen</b> <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" id="w">MBE</a> (born <a href="/wiki/27_June" id="w">27 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1980" id="w">1980</a> in <a href="/wiki/Pietermaritzburg" id="w">Pietermaritzburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal_Province" id="w">Natal</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a>) is an English <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricketer</a>. He is an attacking right-handed <a href="/wiki/Batsman" id="w">batsman</a> and occasional <a href="/wiki/Off_spin" id="w">off spin</a> <a href="/wiki/Bowler_(cricket)" id="w">bowler</a> who plays for <a href="/wiki/Hampshire_County_Cricket_Club" id="w">Hampshire County Cricket Club</a> and is a member of both the <a href="/wiki/English_cricket_team" id="w">England</a> <a href="/wiki/Test_cricket" id="w">Test match</a> and <a href="/wiki/One_Day_International" id="w">One Day International</a> teams. </p>
<p>He made his <a href="/wiki/First-class_cricket" id="w">first-class</a> debut for <a href="/wiki/KwaZulu_Natal_cricket_team" id="w">Natal</a> in 1997 before <a href="/wiki/International_cricketers_of_South_African_origin" id="w">moving to England</a> after voicing his displeasure at the <a href="/wiki/Racial_quota" id="w">racial quota</a> system in place in South Africa,<sup id="_ref-cricinfo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cricinfo" title="">[1]</a></sup> and in order to further his opportunities for playing at international level.  Being born of an English mother gave Pietersen eligibility to play for England, and after serving a qualifying period of four years playing at <a href="/wiki/County_cricket" id="w">county</a> level, he was called up almost immediately into the national side. He made his international debut in the One-day International match against <a href="/wiki/Zimbabwe_national_cricket_team" id="w">Zimbabwe</a> in 2004,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> and his Test match debut in the <a href="/wiki/2005_Ashes_series" id="w">2005 Ashes series</a> against <a href="/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team" id="w">Australia</a> the following year.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>  
<p>Pietersen quickly became the fastest batsman to reach both 1000 and 2000 runs in One-day International cricket,<sup id="_ref-fastest to 1000_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fastest to 1000" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-fastest to 2000_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fastest to 2000" title="">[5]</a></sup> and currently has the highest average of any England player to have played more than 20 innings of one-day cricket.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> He also has the second-highest run total from his first 25 Tests, behind only the Australian <a href="/wiki/Donald_Bradman" id="w">Donald Bradman</a>.<sup id="_ref-brenkley_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brenkley" title="">[7]</a></sup> He became only the third English batsman to top the ICC One-day International rankings, doing so in March 2007.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Early_and_personal_life" name="Early_and_personal_life"></a><h2>Early and personal life</h2>
<p>Born of an <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> mother and an <a href="/wiki/Afrikaner" id="w">Afrikaner</a> father, Penny and Jannie,<sup id="_ref-cricinfo_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cricinfo" title="">[1]</a></sup> Pietersen had a strict and well-disciplined childhood, along with his three brothers Tony, Greg and Bryan;<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> he learned valuable lessons from this &#34;fantastic&#34; approach to parenting, and said: &#34;Discipline is good. It taught me that I didn&#39;t always have to have what I wanted; that what I needed was different from what I wanted.&#34;<sup id="_ref-cooke_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cooke" title="">[10]</a></sup> Bryan is currently playing club and second XI cricket in England.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pietersen attended <a href="/wiki/Maritzburg_College" id="w">Maritzburg College</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pietermaritzburg" id="w">Pietermaritzburg</a>, and made his <a href="/wiki/First-class_cricket" id="w">first-class cricket</a> debut for <a href="/wiki/KwaZulu_Natal_cricket_team" id="w">Natal</a>&#39;s B team in 1997, aged 17, where he was regarded predominantly as an <a href="/wiki/Off_spin" id="w">off spin</a> bowler and a hard-hitting lower-order batsman.<sup id="_ref-Brenkley2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brenkley2" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-notts_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-notts" title="">[13]</a></sup> After two seasons, he moved to England for a five-month spell as the overseas player for club side <a href="/wiki/Cannock" id="w">Cannock</a> CC, and helped them win the <a href="/wiki/Birmingham_and_District_Premier_League" id="w">Birmingham and District Premier League</a> in 2000.<sup id="_ref-cannock_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cannock" title="">[14]</a></sup> This first spell away from home did not leave him with fond memories for England, in particular &#34;those horrible Black Country accents&#34;, living in a single room above a squash court, and working in the club bar.<sup id="_ref-cooke_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cooke" title="">[10]</a></sup>  However, he returned to newly-renamed <a href="/wiki/KwaZulu_Natal_cricket_team" id="w">KwaZulu Natal</a> side a better cricketer, a lack of opportunities to bowl having improved his batting.<sup id="_ref-cannock_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cannock" title="">[14]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Pietersen is widely portrayed in the media as having a self-assured personality, described by <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Boycott" id="w">Geoffrey Boycott</a> as being &#34;cocky and confident&#34;.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> England test captain <a href="/wiki/Michael_Vaughan" id="w">Michael Vaughan</a> counters this, saying, &#34;KP is not a confident person. He obviously has great belief in his ability but that&#39;s not quite the same thing...And I know KP wants to be loved. I try to text him and talk to him as often as I can because I know he is insecure.&#34;<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> He has been noted for his unusual haircuts, with his peroxide blond dyed streak of hair along the middle of his head during the <a href="/wiki/2005_Ashes_series" id="w">2005 Ashes series</a> being described as a &#34;dead skunk&#34; look.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> During the <a href="/wiki/2006-07_Ashes" id="w">2006&#8211;07 Ashes</a> tour, the Australian team, noted for their efforts to dominate opponents psychologically, dubbed him &#34;The Ego&#34;, or &#34;FIGJAM&#34; (Fuck I&#39;m Good, Just Ask Me).<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup>  Other <a href="/wiki/Nickname" id="w">nicknames</a> include <i>KP</i>, <i>Kelves</i> and <i>Kapes</i>.<sup id="_ref-cricinfo_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cricinfo" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pietersen was rumoured to be dating model <a href="/wiki/Caprice_Bourret" id="w">Caprice Bourret</a> who accompanied him to the <a href="/wiki/International_Cricket_Council" id="w">ICC</a> awards in October 2005,<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> but he is now engaged to <a href="/wiki/Liberty_X" id="w">Liberty X</a> singer <a href="/wiki/Jessica_Taylor_(Liberty_X)" id="w">Jessica Taylor</a>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The couple plan to marry later in 2007, with former England team-mate <a href="/wiki/Darren_Gough" id="w">Darren Gough</a> acting as best man.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> The couple married on 29th December 2007 at the Manor House Hotel in Wiltshire.</p>
<a id="Domestic_career" name="Domestic_career"></a><h2>Domestic career</h2>
<p>He impressed members of <a href="/wiki/Nasser_Hussain" id="w">Nasser Hussain</a>&#39;s England side when playing for <a href="/wiki/KwaZulu_Natal_cricket_team" id="w">KwaZulu Natal</a> in 1999; he took four top-order wickets and, despite batting at number nine, scored 61 <a href="/wiki/Not_out" id="w">not out</a> from 57 balls, hitting four sixes.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> Hussain then recommended that Pietersen secure a contract with an English county side.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the praise from the England side, Pietersen was dropped from the Natal first team. Pietersen felt that this was due to the country&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Racial_quota" id="w">racial quota</a> system, in which provincial sides were required to have at least four non-white players.<sup id="_ref-cricinfo_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cricinfo" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-storm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-storm" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Pietersen&#39;s view was that players should be judged on merit, and described it as &#34;heartbreaking&#34; when he was left out of the side, although he later reflected &#34;it turned out it was the best thing that could have happened&#34;.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Pietersen has since firmly criticised the quota system,<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> which he feels forced him out of the country of his birth. He has also criticised <a href="/wiki/Graeme_Smith" id="w">Graeme Smith</a>, who became captain of the South African side in 2003, calling him &#34;an absolute muppet, childish and strange&#34; and that his behaviour &#34;leaves a lot to be desired&#34;.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Smith opposed this, saying, &#34;I&#39;m patriotic about my country, and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t like Kevin Pietersen. The only reason that Kevin and I have never had a relationship is because he slated South Africa&#34;.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> His outspoken views published in his autobiography, <i>Crossing the Boundary</i>, in September 2006, and in an interview for South African magazine <i><a href="/wiki/GQ_(magazine)" id="w">GQ</a></i>, led to unsuccessful calls for an <a href="/wiki/International_Cricket_Council" id="w">ICC</a> investigation regarding bringing the game into disrepute.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-storm_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-storm" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2000, <a href="/wiki/Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club" id="w">Nottinghamshire</a> coach <a href="/wiki/Clive_Rice" id="w">Clive Rice</a>, who had seen Pietersen play in 1997 in South Africa at a schools week, heard that Pietersen was playing club cricket in Birmingham and offered him a three-year contract to play for the county.<sup id="_ref-notts_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-notts" title="">[13]</a></sup>  His maiden first-class century came on his Nottinghamshire debut against <a href="/wiki/Loughborough_UCCE" id="w">Loughborough UCCE</a>.<sup id="_ref-kpzone_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kpzone" title="">[31]</a></sup> In his first season he made 1,275 runs with an impressive <a href="/wiki/Batting_average" id="w">batting average</a> of 57.95,<sup id="_ref-Booth_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Booth" title="">[32]</a></sup> including 218 not out in an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 352 with <a href="/wiki/John_Morris_(cricketer)" id="w">John Morris</a> at <a href="/wiki/Derby" id="w">Derby</a> in July, after having been out <a href="/wiki/Lbw" id="w">lbw</a> for a <a href="/wiki/Duck_(cricket)" id="w">duck</a> in the first innings.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> These performances led to praise in the <i><a href="/wiki/Wisden_Cricketers%26%2339%3B_Almanack" id="w">Wisden Cricketers&#39; Almanack</a></i>: &#34;If he can maintain his first season&#39;s form, the name of Pietersen should be pencilled in for future Test squads.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Booth_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Booth" title="">[32]</a></sup> This form did indeed continue into the following year: he made another unbeaten double-century, against <a href="/wiki/Middlesex_County_Cricket_Club" id="w">Middlesex</a>, taking part in a partnership of 316 for the fourth wicket with <a href="/wiki/Darren_Bicknell" id="w">Darren Bicknell</a>.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> This period proved to be a <a href="/wiki/Purple_prose" id="w">purple patch</a> for the batsman, scoring four consecutive centuries (254 not out, 122, 147 and 116) in one week in August.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 2003, Pietersen scored 1,546 <a href="/wiki/First-class_cricket" id="w">first-class</a> runs, and 764 runs in <a href="/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket" id="w">limited overs cricket</a>.<sup id="_ref-kpzone_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kpzone" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> He was selected for the 2003&#8211;04 <a href="/wiki/ECB_National_Academy" id="w">ECB National Academy</a> tour of India, and had a successful tour scoring 523 runs including three centuries in his six first-class innings to record an average of 104.60,<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>  and making 131 in a one-day match against India A in <a href="/wiki/Bangalore" id="w">Bangalore</a>.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Nottinghamshire were relegated in 2003, Pietersen requested a release from his contract, saying &#34;I haven&#39;t been happy for a while....The pitch at <a href="/wiki/Trent_Bridge" id="w">Trent Bridge</a> has been one of my problems... I could have done so much better if the wicket had been good.&#34;<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> This led to a public row with club captain <a href="/wiki/Jason_Gallian" id="w">Jason Gallian</a>, where Gallian allegedly threw Pietersen&#39;s kit off the <a href="/wiki/Trent_Bridge" id="w">Trent Bridge</a> balcony and broke his bat:
</p><blockquote>During the game I told the captain that I was not happy and that I wanted to leave. After the game we spoke in the dressing room and then I went to have dinner. I got a call saying the captain had trashed my equipment. I was told the captain had said, &#39;if he does not want to play for Notts he can f*** off.&#39; I have not spoken to Gallian since, nor have I received an apology.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></blockquote> Pietersen was made to honour the last year of his contract at Nottinghamshire, but &#34;didn&#39;t enjoy it at all&#34;.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> In October 2004, he joined <a href="/wiki/Hampshire_County_Cricket_Club" id="w">Hampshire</a> under the captaincy of <a href="/wiki/Shane_Warne" id="w">Shane Warne</a>.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup>

<p>After becoming a regular in the international side, Pietersen rarely gets an opportunity to play domestic cricket. Having an England &#34;central contract&#34; means that Pietersen is only released to play for Hampshire at the discretion of the national coach. After being left out of the national side to face <a href="/wiki/Bangladesh_national_cricket_team" id="w">Bangladesh</a> in May 2005, Pietersen had several good innings in the four-day county championship, including two centuries.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> He only played twice for the county in 2006, and has played once so far in 2007, with an unbeaten 66 against <a href="/wiki/Ireland_cricket_team" id="w">Ireland</a>.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

The tour of <a href="/wiki/Zimbabwe" id="w">Zimbabwe</a> caused several players to voice their concerns about the <a href="/wiki/Robert_Mugabe" id="w">Robert Mugabe</a> regime, the security issues in  the country and the standard of the <a href="/wiki/Zimbabwe_cricket_team" id="w">Zimbabwean</a> side.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Steve_Harmison" id="w">Steve Harmison</a> was the first to boycott the tour for &#34;political and sporting reasons&#34;,<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> and all-rounder <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Flintoff" id="w">Andrew Flintoff</a> was reported to be considering taking a moral stand himself.

<p>Pietersen was upset not to be initially in the squad to tour <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a>.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> With Flintoff withdrawing due to injury,<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Pietersen was recalled to the squad,<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> and cemented his place in the first team with 97 off 84 balls in the warm-up match against South Africa A, in the face of a hostile crowd.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> Throughout the tour, Pietersen was subjected to a barrage of abuse from the South African crowd, who regarded him somewhat like a <a href="/wiki/Traitor" id="w">traitor</a>.<sup id="_ref-Brenkley2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Brenkley2" title="">[12]</a></sup> He said:
</p><blockquote>I knew I was going to cop a lot of stick but it will be like water off a duck&#39;s back...I expected stick at the start of the innings, and I&#39;m sure it will carry on through the whole series. But I just sat back and laughed at the opposition, with their swearing and &#39;traitor&#39; remarks... some of them can hardly speak English. My affiliation is with England. In fact, I&#39;m starting to speak too much like <a href="/wiki/Darren_Gough" id="w">Darren Gough</a>...

Despite press speculation, Pietersen was not picked for the <a href="/wiki/Test_cricket" id="w">Tests</a> against <a href="/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team" id="w">Bangladesh</a>&#8212;his early season form being dogged by a foot injury<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup>&#8212;but with his county form improving, he was selected for the <a href="/wiki/Twenty20" id="w">Twenty20</a> match against <a href="/wiki/Australian_cricket_team" id="w">Australia</a> at <a href="/wiki/Southampton" id="w">Southampton</a>, making 34 from 18 balls and taking three catches as England won by 100 runs.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the triangular ODI series against Australia and Bangladesh, Pietersen did not get to bat in the first match at <a href="/wiki/The_Oval" id="w">The Oval</a> as England won by 10 wickets, but scored 91 off 65 balls in the match in <a href="/wiki/Bristol" id="w">Bristol</a> against Australia.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> In the remainder of the triangular series, Pietersen scored quickly, although without other half-centuries.

In the much anticipated Ashes series in Australia, Pietersen was widely judged to be England&#39;s best player, scoring 490 runs in five matches and averaging over 50. He started well with a defiant 92 in the first Test despite England losing by 277 runs,<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup> and then backed up his good form with a century in the second Test in <a href="/wiki/Adelaide" id="w">Adelaide</a>,
sharing a 310-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Paul Collingwood.
