<b>Freedom of religion </b> is a guarantee by a <a href="/wiki/Government" id="w">government</a> for <i>freedom of belief</i> for individuals and <i>freedom of worship</i> for individuals and groups. It is generally recognized to also include the freedom not to follow any religion.  Freedom of religion is considered by many in many nations and people to be a fundamental <a href="/wiki/Human_right" id="w">human right</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In a country with a <a href="/wiki/State_religion" id="w">state religion</a>, freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths.  In the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a>, toleration of <a href="/wiki/Judaism" id="w">Judaism</a> was a contentious issue throughout <a href="/wiki/Christendom" id="w">Christendom</a>. Today, there are concerns about the persecution of religious minorities in <a href="/wiki/Sharia" id="w">Islamic states</a> (for example the <a href="/wiki/Persecution_of_Bah%C3%A1%26%2339%3B%C3%ADs" id="w">persecution of Bahá&#39;ís</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Status_of_religious_freedom_in_Iran" id="w">status of religious freedom in Iran</a>) and in some Communist states such as <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_Korea" id="w">North Korea</a>, as well as other forms of intolerance in other countries (for example banning the wearing of prominent religious articles in <a href="/wiki/Turkey" id="w">Turkey</a><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> or banning the Quran in United States courts where a Bible is allowed<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>)  Freedom of religion as a legal concept is related to but not identical with <a href="/wiki/Religious_toleration" id="w">religious toleration</a>, <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state" id="w">separation of church and state</a>, or <i><a href="/wiki/La%C3%AFcit%C3%A9" id="w">laïcité</a></i> (a <a href="/wiki/Secular_state" id="w">secular state</a>).</p>
<p>Where individuals and not governments are concerned, religious toleration is generally taken to refer to an attitude of acceptance towards other people&#39;s religions. Such toleration does not require that one view other religions as equally true; rather, the assumption is that each citizen will grant that others have the right to hold and practice their own beliefs. Against this backdrop, proselytism can be a contentious issue, as it could be regarded as an offense against the validity of others&#39; religious beliefs, including the belief in no religion at all.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" id="w">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> adopted by the 58 Member States of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" id="w">United Nations General Assembly</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_10" id="w">December 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1948" id="w">1948</a>, at the <a href="/wiki/Palais_de_Chaillot" id="w">Palais de Chaillot</a> in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> defines freedom of religion and belief as follows: <i>Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.</i>

<a id="History_of_freedom_of_religion" name="History_of_freedom_of_religion"></a><h1>History of freedom of religion</h1>
<p>Historically <i>freedom of religion</i> has been used to refer to the tolerance of different theological systems of belief, while <i>freedom of worship</i> was defined as freedom of individual action.  Each of these have existed to varying degrees.  While many countries have accepted some form of religious freedom, this has also often been limited in practice through punitive taxation, repressive social legislation, and political disenfranchisement. Compare examples of individual freedom in <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Muslim" id="w">Muslim</a> tradition of <a href="/wiki/Dhimmi" id="w">dhimmis</a>, literally &#34;protected individuals&#34; professing an officially tolerated non-Muslim religion. </p>
<a id="Antiquity" name="Antiquity"></a><h2>Antiquity</h2>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Classical_antiquity" id="w">Antiquity</a> a <a href="/wiki/Syncretism" id="w">syncretic</a> point-of-view often allowed communities of traders to operate under their own customs. When street mobs of separate quarters clashed in a <a href="/wiki/Hellenistic" id="w">Hellenistic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Roman</a> city, the issue was generally perceived to be an infringement of  community rights. The Greek-Jewish clashes at <a href="/wiki/Cyrene" id="w">Cyrene</a> provided one example of cosmopolitan cities as scenes of tumult.  </p>
<p>Some of the historical exceptions have been in regions where one of the revealed religions has been in a position of power: <a href="/wiki/Judaism" id="w">Judaism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zoroastrianism" id="w">Zoroastrianism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Islam</a>. Others have been where the established order has felt threatened, as shown in the <a href="/wiki/Trial_of_Socrates" id="w">trial of Socrates</a> or where the ruler has been deified, as in Rome, and refusal to offer token <a href="/wiki/Sacrifice" id="w">sacrifice</a> was similar to refusing to take an <a href="/wiki/Oath_of_allegiance" id="w">oath of allegiance</a>. This was the core for resentment and the <a href="/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians" id="w">persecution of early Christian communities</a>.</p>
<p>The first mother of religious freedom was established in the ancient <a href="/wiki/Persian_Empire" id="w">Persian Empire</a> by its founder <a href="/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great" id="w">Cyrus the Great</a> in the 6th century BC, as stated in his <a href="/wiki/Cyrus_cylinder" id="w">Cyrus cylinder</a>.</p>
<p>Freedom of religious worship was established in the <a href="/wiki/Maurya_Empire" id="w">Maurya Empire</a> of <a href="/wiki/History_of_India" id="w">ancient India</a> by <a href="/wiki/Ashoka_the_Great" id="w">Ashoka the Great</a> in the 3rd century BC, which was encapsulated in the <a href="/wiki/Edicts_of_Ashoka" id="w">Edicts of Ashoka</a>.</p>

The Norman <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sicily" id="w">Kingdom of Sicily</a> under <a href="/wiki/Roger_II_of_Sicily" id="w">Roger II</a> was characterised by its multi-ethnic nature and religious tolerance. Normans, Jews, Muslim Arabs, Byzantine Greeks, Longobards and &#34;native&#34; Sicilians lived in harmony.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Rather than exterminate the Muslims of Sicily, the Roger II&#39;s grandson Emperor <a href="/wiki/Frederick_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Frederick II of Hohenstaufen</a> (1215—1250) allowed them to settle on the mainland and build mosques. Not least, he enlisted them in his — Christian — army and even into his personal bodyguards.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the fall of the city of <a href="/wiki/Granada" id="w">Granada</a> in <a href="/wiki/1492" id="w">1492</a>, the Muslim population was promised religious freedom by the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Granada" id="w">Treaty of Granada</a>, but that promise was short-lived. In 1501, Granada&#39;s Muslims were given an ultimatum to either convert to Christianity or to emigrate. The majority converted, but only superficially, continuing to dress and speak as they had before and to secretly practice <a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Islam</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Morisco" id="w">Moriscos</a> (converts to Christianity) were ultimately expelled from <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a> between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by <a href="/wiki/Philip_III_of_Spain#Expulsion of the Moors (1609–1610)" id="w">Philip III</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic Church</a> kept a tight rein on religious expression throughout the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" id="w">Middle Ages</a>. Jews were alternately tolerated and persecuted, the most notable examples of the latter being the expulsion of all <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Spain" id="w">Jews</a> from Spain in <a href="/wiki/1492" id="w">1492</a>. Some of those who remained and converted were tried as heretics in the <a href="/wiki/Inquisition" id="w">Inquisition</a> for allegedly practicing Judaism in secret. Despite the persecution of Jews, they were the most tolerated non-Catholic faith in Europe. </p>
<p>However, the latter was in part a reaction to the growing movement that became the <a href="/wiki/Reformation" id="w">Reformation</a>. As early as 1380, <a href="/wiki/John_Wycliffe" id="w">John Wycliffe</a> in England denied <a href="/wiki/Transubstantiation" id="w">transubstantiation</a> and began his translation of the Bible into English. He was condemned in a <a href="/wiki/Papal_Bull" id="w">Papal Bull</a> in 1410, and all his books were burned.</p>
<p>In 1414, <a href="/wiki/Jan_Hus" id="w">Jan Hus</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Bohemia" id="w">Bohemian</a> preacher of reformation, was given a safe conduct by the Holy Roman Emperor to attend the <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Constance" id="w">Council of Constance</a>. Not entirely trusting in his safety, he made his will before he left. His forebodings proved accurate, and he was burned at the stake on <a href="/wiki/July_6" id="w">July 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1415" id="w">1415</a>. The Council also decreed that Wycliffe&#39;s remains be disinterred and cast out. This decree was not carried out until 1428.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther" id="w">Martin Luther</a> published his famous 95 Theses in <a href="/wiki/Wittenberg" id="w">Wittenberg</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_31" id="w">October 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/1517" id="w">1517</a>. His aim was to stop the sale of <a href="/wiki/Indulgence" id="w">indulgences</a> and reform the Church from within, but this was not the result. In 1521, he was given the chance to recant at the <a href="/wiki/Diet_of_Worms" id="w">Diet of Worms</a> before <a href="/wiki/Charles_V%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, then only 19. After he refused to recant, he was declared heretic. Partly for his own protection, he was sequestered on the <a href="/wiki/Wartburg" id="w">Wartburg</a> in the possessions of <a href="/wiki/Frederick_III%2C_Elector_of_Saxony" id="w">Frederick III, Elector of Saxony</a>, where he translated the <a href="/wiki/New_Testament" id="w">New Testament</a> into German. He was excommunicated by Papal Bull in 1521.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Protestant" id="w">Protestant</a> movement, however, continued to gain ground in his absence and spread to <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>. <a href="/wiki/Ulrich_Zwingli" id="w">Ulrich Zwingli</a> preached reform in <a href="/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich" id="w">Zürich</a> from 1520 to 1523. He opposed the sale of indulgences, celibacy, pilgrimages, pictures, statues, relics, altars, and organs. This culminated in outright war between the Swiss <a href="/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland" id="w">cantons</a> that accepted Protestantism and the Catholics. The Catholics were victorious, and Zwingli was killed in battle in 1531. The Catholic cantons were magnanimous in victory.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in Germany <a href="/wiki/Philip_Melanchthon" id="w">Philip Melanchthon</a> drafted the <a href="/wiki/Augsburg_Confession" id="w">Augsburg Confession</a> as a common confession for the Lutherans and the free territories. It was presented to Charles V in 1530.</p>
<p>The defiance of Papal authority proved contagious, and in 1533, when <a href="/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England" id="w">Henry VIII of England</a> was excommunicated for his divorce and remarriage to Anne Boleyn, he promptly established a state church with bishops appointed by the crown. This was not without internal opposition, and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_More" id="w">Thomas More</a>, who had been his prime minister, was executed in 1535 for opposition to Henry.</p>
<p>In 1535, the Swiss canton of <a href="/wiki/Geneva" id="w">Geneva</a> became Protestant, but the Protestants often proved as intolerant of differences of opinion as the Catholics. In 1536, the <a href="/wiki/Bern" id="w">Bernese</a> imposed the reformation on the canton of <a href="/wiki/Vaud" id="w">Vaud</a> by conquest. They sacked the cathedral in <a href="/wiki/Lausanne" id="w">Lausanne</a> and destroyed all its art and statuary. <a href="/wiki/John_Calvin" id="w">John Calvin</a>, who had been active in Geneva was expelled in 1538 in a power struggle, but he was invited back in 1540.

The same kind of seesaw back and forth between Protestantism and Catholicism was evident in England when <a href="/wiki/Mary_I_of_England" id="w">Mary I of England</a> returned that country briefly to the Catholic fold in 1553. However, her half-sister, <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England" id="w">Elizabeth I of England</a> was to restore the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" id="w">Church of England</a> in 1558, this time permanently. The <a href="/wiki/King_James_Bible" id="w">King James Bible</a> commissioned by King <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_England" id="w">James I of England</a> and published in 1611 proved a landmark for Protestant worship.</p>
<p>However, intolerance of dissident forms of Protestantism continued, as evidenced by the exodus of the <a href="/wiki/Pilgrims" id="w">Pilgrims</a> who sought refuge, first in the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a>, and ultimately in America, founding the <a href="/wiki/Plymouth_Colony" id="w">Plymouth Colony</a> in <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Massachusetts</a> in 1620.  <a href="/wiki/William_Penn" id="w">William Penn</a>, the founder of <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" id="w">Philadelphia</a> was involved in a case which had a profound effect upon future American law and those of England.  In a classic case of <a href="/wiki/Jury_nullification" id="w">jury nullification</a> the jury refused to convict William Penn of preaching a <a href="/wiki/Quaker" id="w">Quaker</a> sermon, which was illegal.  Even though the jury was imprisoned for their acquittal, they stood by their decision and helped establish the freedom of religion.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" id="w">Holy Roman Empire</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_V%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Charles V</a> agreed to tolerate Lutheranism in 1555 at the <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Augsburg" id="w">Peace of Augsburg</a>. Each state was to take the religion of its prince, but within those states, there was not necessarily religious tolerance. Citizens of other faiths could relocate to a more hospitable environment.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1558" id="w">1558</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Transylvania" id="w">Transylvanian</a> <a href="/wiki/Diet_(assembly)" id="w">Diet</a> of <a href="/wiki/Turda" id="w">Turda</a> declared free practice of both the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Catholic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lutheranism" id="w">Lutheran</a> religions, but prohibited <a href="/wiki/Calvinism" id="w">Calvinism</a>. Ten years later, in <a href="/wiki/1568" id="w">1568</a> the Diet extended the freedom to all religions, declaring that &#34;It is not allowed to anybody to intimidate anybody with captivity or expelling for his religion&#34;. The Edict of Turda is considered by mostly Hungarian historians as the first legal guarantee of religious freedom in the Christian Europe.</p>
<p>In France, although peace was made between Protestants and Catholics at the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Saint_Germain" id="w">Treaty of Saint Germain</a> in 1570, persecution continued, most notably in the <a href="/wiki/Massacre_of_Saint_Bartholomew%26%2339%3Bs_Day" id="w">Massacre of Saint Bartholomew&#39;s Day</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_24" id="w">August 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1572" id="w">1572</a>, in which many Protestants throughout France were killed. It was not until the converted Protestant prince <a href="/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France" id="w">Henry IV of France</a> came to the throne that religious tolerance was formalized in the <a href="/wiki/Edict_of_Nantes" id="w">Edict of Nantes</a> in 1598. It would remain in force for over 80 years until its revocation in 1685 by <a href="/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France" id="w">Louis XIV of France</a>. Intolerance remained the norm until the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" id="w">French Revolution</a>, when state religion was abolished and all Church property confiscated.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1573" id="w">1573</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Confederation_(1573)" id="w">Warsaw Confederation</a> formalized in the newly formed <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" id="w">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> the freedom of religion that had a long tradition in the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Poland_(1385%E2%80%931569)" id="w">Kingdom of Poland</a>. The first extensive <a href="/wiki/History_of_Jews_in_Poland" id="w">Jewish</a> emigration from Western Europe to Poland occurred at the time of the <a href="/wiki/First_Crusade" id="w">First Crusade</a> in 1098. Under <a href="/wiki/Boleslaus_III_of_Poland" id="w">Boleslaus III</a> (1102&#8211;1139), the Jews, encouraged by the tolerant régime of this ruler, settled throughout Poland, including over the border into <a href="/wiki/Lithuania" id="w">Lithuanian</a> territory as far as <a href="/wiki/Kiev" id="w">Kiev</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Lipka_Tatars" id="w">Tatars</a> who settled in Lithuania, Ruthenia and modern-day eastern Poland were allowed to preserve their <a href="/wiki/Islamic" id="w">Islamic</a> religion in exchange for military service. </p>
<p>Bohemia (present-day <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" id="w">Czech Republic</a>) enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1620, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period of time. The so-called <a href="/wiki/Bohemia#Hussite Bohemia" id="w">Basel Compacts of 1436</a> declared the freedom of religion and peace between Catholics and <a href="/wiki/Utraquism" id="w">Utraquists</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1609" id="w">1609</a>, Emperor <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_II" id="w">Rudolf II</a> granted Bohemia greater religious liberty with his Letter of Majesty. The privileged position of the Catholic Church in the <a href="/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Bohemia" id="w">Czech kingdom</a> was firmly established after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_White_Mountain" id="w">Battle of White Mountain</a> in 1620. Gradually freedom of religion in <a href="/wiki/Czech_lands" id="w">Bohemian lands</a> came to an end and Protestants fled or were expelled from the country. A devout Catholic, Emperor <a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor" id="w">Ferdinand II</a> forcibly converted Austrian and Bohemian Protestants.</p>

<p>This issue was addressed by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Paine" id="w">Thomas Paine</a> in his pamphlet, <a href="/wiki/Common_Sense_(pamphlet)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Common Sense&#39;&#39;</a> (1776):

<p>Freedom of religion in the <a href="/wiki/Indian_subcontinent" id="w">Indian subcontinent</a> is exemplified by the reign of King Piyadasi (304 B.C to 232 B.C) (<a href="/wiki/Asoka" id="w">Asoka</a>). One of King Asoka&#39;s main concern was to reform governmental institutes and exercise moral principles in his attempt to create a <a href="/wiki/Edicts_of_Ashoka" id="w">just and humane society</a>. Later, he promoted the principles of <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" id="w">Buddhism</a> and the creation of a just, understanding  and fair society was held as an important principle for many ancient rulers of this time in the East. </p>
<p>The importance of <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_worship" id="w">freedom of worship</a> in India was encapsulated in an inscription of <a href="/wiki/Asoka" id="w">Asoka</a>:</p>
<p>{{Quotation}}</p>
<p>Religious freedom and the right to worship freely was a practice that had been appreciated and promoted by most ancient India dynasties. This had been the underlying attitude of most rulers of <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> since this period from before 300 B.C. until 1200 AD. The initial entry of <a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Islam</a> into <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" id="w">South Asia</a> came in the first century after the death of the Prophet <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" id="w">Muhammad</a>. When around 1210 AD the <a href="/wiki/Islamic_empires_in_India" id="w">Islamic Sultanates</a> invaded India from the north-east, gradually the principle of freedom of religion deteriorated in this part of the world.

<a id="Contemporary_debates" name="Contemporary_debates"></a><h1>Contemporary debates</h1>
<p>The contemporary idea of religious freedom as a human right remains a contested topic. The major areas of debate are listed below. </p>
<a id="Islam" name="Islam"></a><h2>Islam</h2>

<p>Some Islamic theologians quote the <a href="/wiki/Quran" id="w">Quran</a> (&#34;There is no compulsion in religion,&#34; Sura 2:257) to show scriptural support for religious freedom. However, other verses and the Hadith mandate severe treatment for unbelievers, which is reflected in the high levels of intolerance shown in many past and contemporary Islamic societies.  </p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Iran" id="w">Iran</a>, the constitution recognizes four religions whose status is formally protected: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.<sup id="_ref-fdih1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fdih1" title="">[7]</a></sup>  The constitution, however, also set the groundwork for the institutionalized <a href="/wiki/Persecution_of_Bah%C3%A1%26%2339%3B%C3%ADs" id="w">persecution of Bahá&#39;ís</a>,<sup id="_ref-ihrdc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ihrdc" title="">[8]</a></sup> who have been subjected to arrests, beatings, executions, confiscation and destruction of property, and the denial of civil rights and liberties, and the denial of access to higher education.<sup id="_ref-fdih1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fdih1" title="">[7]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>, a <a href="/wiki/16_December" id="w">16 December</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> judgment of the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Constitutional_Court_of_Egypt" id="w">Supreme Administrative Council</a> created a clear demarcation between recognized religions — Islam, Christianity and Judaism — and all other religious beliefs;<sup id="_ref-middle_east_times_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-middle_east_times" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-washingtontimes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washingtontimes" title="">[10]</a></sup> no other religious affiliation is officially admissible.<sup id="_ref-ahram_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ahram" title="">[11]</a></sup> The ruling leaves members of other religious communities, including Bahá&#39;ís, without the ability to obtain the necessary government documents to have rights in their country, essentially denying them of all rights of citizenship.<sup id="_ref-ahram_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ahram" title="">[11]</a></sup> They cannot obtain ID cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, and passports; they also cannot be employed, educated, treated in public hospitals or vote among other things.<sup id="_ref-ahram_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ahram" title="">[11]</a></sup> See <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_identification_card_controversy" id="w">Egyptian identification card controversy</a>.</p>

 <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic Church</a> affirmed religious freedom for all in the <a href="/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council" id="w">Second Vatican Council</a> Declaration <i><a href="/wiki/Dignitatis_Humanae" id="w">Dignitatis Humanae</a></i>. This was itself inspired by the work of the <a href="/wiki/Jesuit" id="w">Jesuit</a> theologian <a href="/wiki/John_Courtney_Murray" id="w">John Courtney Murray</a>. Some Orthodox Christians, especially those living in <a href="/wiki/Democratic" id="w">democratic</a> countries, support religious freedom for all, as evidenced by the position of the <a href="/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarchate" id="w">Ecumenical Patriarchate</a>. Many Protestant Christian churches, including some <a href="/wiki/Baptists" id="w">Baptists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Churches_of_Christ_in_Australia" id="w">Churches of Christ</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church" id="w">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mainline_(Protestant)" id="w">main line</a> churches have a commitment to religious freedoms. The Mormons (<a href="/wiki/Mormons" id="w">Latter-Day Saints</a>) also affirm religious freedom.</p>
<p>However others such as African scholar Makau Mutua have argued that Christian insistence on the propagation of their faith to native cultures as an element of religious freedom has resulted in a corresponding denial of religious freedom to native traditions and led to their destruction. As he states in the book produced by the Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief -- &#34;Imperial religions have necessarily violated individual conscience and the communal expressions of Africans and their communities by subverting African religions.&#34; <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Changing_religion" name="Changing_religion"></a><h2>Changing religion</h2>
<p>Among the most contentious areas of religious freedom is the &#34;Right to Change&#34; one&#39;s religion. </p>
<p>Other debates have centered around restricting certain kinds of missionary activity by
religions. Many Islamic states, and others such as China, severely restrict missionary activities of other religions. <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a>, among European countries, has generally looked unfavorably on missionary activities of denominations others than the majority church and proselytizing is constitutionally prohibited. <sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A different kind of critique of the freedom to propagate religion has come from non-Abrahamic traditions such as the African and Indian. African scholar <a href="/wiki/Makau_Mutua" id="w">Makau Mutua</a> criticizes religious evangelism on the ground of cultural annihilation by what he calls &#34;proselytizing universalist faiths.&#34;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>{{Quotation}}</p>
<p>Some Indian scholars have similarly argued that the right to propagate religion is not culturally or religiously neutral.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Sri_Lanka" id="w">Sri Lanka</a> there have been debates regarding a bill on religious freedom that seeks to protect indigenous religious traditions from certain kinds of missionary activities. Debates have also occurred in various states of <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> regarding similar laws, particularly those that restrict conversions using force, fraud or allurement.</p>
<a id="Religious_practice_versus_secular_law" name="Religious_practice_versus_secular_law"></a><h2>Religious practice versus secular law</h2>

<p>Religious practice may also conflict with secular law creating debates on religious freedom. For instance, even though <a href="/wiki/Polygamy" id="w">polygamy</a> is permitted in Islam it is prohibited in secular law in many Western countries. Does prohibiting polygamy then curtail the religious freedom of Muslims? The USA and India, for instance, have taken two different views of this. In India, polygamy is permitted, but only for Muslims, under Muslim Personal Law. In the USA, polygamy is prohibited for all. This was a major source of conflict between the early <a href="/wiki/Mormon" id="w">Mormon</a> Church and the United States until the Church finally amended its position on polygamy. </p>
<p>Similar issues have also arisen in the context of the religious use of <a href="/wiki/Psychedelic" id="w">psychedelic</a> substances by Native American tribes in the United States as well as other Native practices.  </p>

<a id="International_law" name="International_law"></a><h2>International law</h2>
<p>In international law the freedom of <a href="/wiki/Religion" id="w">religion</a> and belief is protected by the <a href="/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights" id="w">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR). This protection extends to specifically non-religious beliefs, such as <a href="/wiki/Humanism_(life_stance)" id="w">Humanism</a>.</p>
<a id="US_foreign_relations" name="US_foreign_relations"></a><h1>US foreign relations </h1>
<p>The United States formally considers religious freedom in its foreign relations.  The <a href="/wiki/International_Religious_Freedom_Act_of_1998" id="w">International Religious Freedom Act of 1998</a> established the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Commission_on_International_Religious_Freedom" id="w">United States Commission on International Religious Freedom</a> which investigates the records of over 200 other nations with respect to religious freedom, and makes recommendations to submit nations with egregious records to ongoing scrutiny and possible economic sanctions.  Many human rights organizations have urged the United States to be still more vigorous in imposing sanctions on countries that do not permit or tolerate religious freedom.</p>
<p>Some critics charge that the United States policy on religious freedom is largely directed towards the rights of Christians, particularly the ability for Christian missionaries to evangelize, in other countries.</p>
