<p><b>Grand Central Station</b> was a <a href="/wiki/Train_station#Terminus stations" id="w">passenger railroad terminal</a> in downtown <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a> from <a href="/wiki/1890" id="w">1890</a> to <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a>.  It was located at 201 W. Harrison Street in the south-western part of the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Loop" id="w">Chicago Loop</a>, the block bounded by between Harrison Street, Wells Street, Polk Street and the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_River" id="w">Chicago River</a>.  Grand Central Station was designed by architect <b><a href="/wiki/Solon_Spencer_Beman" id="w">Solon Spencer Beman</a></b> for the <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin_Central_Railway" id="w">Wisconsin Central Railway</a>, and was completed by the <a href="/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Chicago_Terminal_Railroad" id="w">Chicago and Northern Pacific Railroad</a>. </p>
<p>Grand Central Station was eventually purchased by the <b><a href="/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad" id="w">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a></b>, which used the station as the Chicago terminus for its passenger rail service, including its glamorous <i><a href="/wiki/Capitol_Limited_(B%26amp%3BO)" id="w">Capitol Limited</a></i> to <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>  Major tenant railroads included the <a href="/wiki/Soo_Line_Railroad" id="w">Soo Line Railroad</a>, successor to the Wisconsin Central, the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Great_Western_Railway" id="w">Chicago Great Western Railway</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Pere_Marquette_Railway" id="w">Pere Marquette Railroad</a>.

<p>In October <a href="/wiki/1889" id="w">1889</a>, a subsidiary of the <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin_Central_Railway" id="w">Wisconsin Central Railway</a> (WC) began constructing a new passenger terminal at the southwest corner of Harrison Street and Wells Street (then called Fifth Avenue) in Chicago, to replace a temporary facility built nearby. The location of this new depot, along the south branch of the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_River" id="w">Chicago River</a>, was selected to take advantage of the bustling passenger and freight market travelling on nearby <a href="/wiki/Lake_Michigan" id="w">Lake Michigan</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>   </p>

</p>
<p>The station was executed in the <a href="/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture" id="w">Norman Castellated</a> architectural style by architect <a href="/wiki/Solon_Spencer_Beman" id="w">Solon S. Beman</a>, who had gained notoriety as the designer of the <a href="/wiki/Pullman%2C_Chicago" id="w">Pullman company neighborhood</a>. Constructed of <a href="/wiki/Brick" id="w">brick</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brownstone" id="w">brownstone</a> and <a href="/wiki/Granite" id="w">granite</a>, it was 228&#160;feet (70&#160;meters) wide on the side facing Harrison Street and 482&#160;feet (147&#160;meters) long on the side facing Wells.  Imposing arches, <a href="/wiki/Crenellation" id="w">crenellations</a>, a spacious arched carriage-court facing Harrison Street, and a multitude of towers dominated the walls.  Its most famous feature, however, was an impressive 247&#160;foot (75&#160;meter) tower at the northeast corner of the property.  Beman, an early advocate of the <a href="/wiki/Floating_raft_system" id="w">Floating raft system</a> to solve Chicago&#39;s unique swampy soil problems, designed the tower to sit within a floating foundation supported by 55&#160;foot (16.8&#160;meter) deep <a href="/wiki/Deep_foundation" id="w">piles</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Early on, an 11,000&#160;pound (4,990&#160;kilogram) bell in the tower rang in the hours.  At some point, however, the bell was removed, but the tower (and its huge clock, 13 feet (4 meters) in diameterâ€”at one time among the largest in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>) remained.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The interior of the Grand Central Station was decorated as extravagantly as the exterior.  The waiting room, for example, had marble floors, <a href="/wiki/Corinthian_order" id="w">Corinthian-style columns</a>, stained-glass windows and a marble fireplace, and a restaurant.  The station also had a 100-room <a href="/wiki/Hotel" id="w">hotel</a>, but accommodations ended late in 1901.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

Not as famous as the clocktower but equally architecturally unique was Grand Central Station&#39;s self-supporting glass and steel <a href="/wiki/Train_shed" id="w">train shed</a>, 555&#160;feet (169&#160;meters) long, 156&#160;feet (48&#160;meters) wide and 78&#160;feet (24&#160;meters) tall, among the largest in the world at the time it was constructed.  The trainshed, considered an architectual gem and a marvel of engineering long after it was built, housed six tracks and had platforms long enough to accommodate fifteen-car passenger trains.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  When it was finally completed, the station had cost its railroad owners one million dollars to build.</p>
<p>Grand Central Station was formally opened on <a href="/wiki/December_8" id="w">December 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1890" id="w">1890</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Chicago_Terminal_Railroad" id="w">Chicago and Northern Pacific Railroad</a>, a subsidiary of the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Pacific_Railway" id="w">Northern Pacific Railway</a>.  Seeking access to the Chicago railway market, the Northern Pacific had purchased Grand Central and the trackage leading up to it from the Wisconsin Central with the intention of making the station its eastern terminus. When it opened, Grand Central hosted trains from the WC (which connected with its former trackage in <a href="/wiki/Forest_Park%2C_Illinois" id="w">Forest Park, Illinois</a>), and the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Great_Western_Railway" id="w">Minnesota and Northwestern Railroad</a> (M&#38;NW), which made also a connection at Forest Park.  By December 1891, the tenants also included the <a href="/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad" id="w">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a>, and in 1903, the <a href="/wiki/Pere_Marquette_Railway" id="w">Pere Marquette Railway</a> also started using the station.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Weakened by the prolonged economic downturn of the <a href="/wiki/Panic_of_1893" id="w">Panic of 1893</a>, the Northern Pacific went bankrupt in October of 1893, and was forced to end its ownership of the Chicago and Northern Pacific, including Grand Central Station.

<p>The smallest of Chicago&#39;s passenger rail terminals, Grand Central Station was a relatively quiet place, even during its heyday.  Grand Central never became a prominent destination for large numbers of cross-country travellers, nor for the daily waves of commuters from the suburbs, that other Chicago terminals were.  In 1912, for example, Grand Central served 3,175 passengers per dayâ€”representing only 4.5 percent of the total number for the city of Chicagoâ€”and serviced an average of 38 trains per day (including 4 B&#38;O suburban trains).  This number paled in comparison to the 146 trains served by <a href="/wiki/Dearborn_Station_(Chicago)" id="w">Dearborn Station</a>, the 191 by <a href="/wiki/LaSalle_Street_Station" id="w">LaSalle Street Station</a>, the 281 at <a href="/wiki/Union_Station_(Chicago)" id="w">Union Station</a>, the 310 by the <a href="/wiki/Ogilvie_Transportation_Center" id="w">Chicago and North Western Terminal</a> and the 373 trains per day at <a href="/wiki/Central_Station_(Chicago_terminal)" id="w">Central Station</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The station did host some of Baltimore and Ohio&#39;s most famous passenger trains, including the <i><a href="/wiki/Capitol_Limited_(B%26amp%3BO)" id="w">Capitol Limited</a></i> to <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>.  Unfortunately, however, the circuitous trackage leading up to the station from the east led these trains miles out of their way through the industrial southwest and west side of the city (See map to the left).  As for the other tenants, the <a href="/wiki/Soo_Line_Railroad" id="w">Soo Line Railroad</a> (which purchased the WC in 1909), the M&#38;NW (which became known as the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Great_Western_Railway" id="w">Chicago Great Western Railway</a> in 1893), and the <a href="/wiki/Pere_Marquette_Railway" id="w">Pere Marquette Railway</a> (which was merged into the <a href="/wiki/Chesapeake_and_Ohio_Railway" id="w">Chesapeake and Ohio Railway</a> in 1947), none were anywhere near as serious players in the intercity passenger rail market as the B&#38;O.</p>

The lightly-used terminal became ominously quiet in the years following <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> when Grand Central had served 26 intercity passenger trainsâ€”down from nearly 40 at its busiest.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Passenger trains were dropped and service was curtailed, and by 1956 the Chicago Great Western, which as late as 1940 had ran six trains per day in and out of Grand Central<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> had stopped operating passenger service into Chicago altogether. As a result, by 1963 only ten intercity trains remainedâ€”down from 26 in 1945 and nearly 40 at its busiestâ€”and six of those were operated by the Baltimore and Ohio.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>  The number of passengers that used the remaining service shriveled proportionately: by 1969, the year the station closed, the station only served an average of 210 passengers per day.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>The precipitous decline in passenger traffic at Grand Central was hardly an isolated occurrence: by the late 1960s, all six of Chicago&#39;s terminals witnessed sharply lower numbers of passengers and trains. However, due to its small size, its age and perceived obsolescence,<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> Grand Central in particular was the target of a long-term political effort by the city government to encourage passenger carriers to consolidate the their terminals in the south Loop.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> It was ultimately this political effort, which was reaching its zenith just as reduced passenger traffic created excess terminal capacity within the city, that sealed the fate of Grand Central, described in 1969 as &#34;decaying, dreary, and sadly out of date.&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Faced with decreasing passenger numbers and intense political pressure to consolidate, the railroads operating into Grand Central Station re-routed their trains into other Chicago terminals, beginning with the Soo Line into <a href="/wiki/Central_Station_(Chicago_terminal)" id="w">Central Station</a> in <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> The remaining six Baltimore and Ohio and ex-Pere Marquette trains last used Grand Central Station on <a href="/wiki/November_8" id="w">November 8</a>, <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a> and were routed into their new terminus at the <a href="/wiki/Ogilvie_Transportation_Center" id="w">Chicago and North Western Terminal</a> the following day.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Sitting unused with acres of abandoned terminal trackage to its south, Grand Central Station&#39;s value as an architectural and engineering masterpiece was discounted by its railroad owner, which believed the value of the land for urban redevelopment to be very substantial.  As a result, the trackage was scrapped and the entirety of the terminal was razed by the railroad in <a href="/wiki/1971" id="w">1971</a>.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Present-day" name="Present-day"></a><h1>Present-day</h1>
<p>Redevelopment of the propertyâ€”the main reason for Grand Central&#39;s speedy demiseâ€”has been slow.  In 1986, a single 17-story apartment building, the first and only construction of a planned development known as <b>River City</b>, was constructed on the former coach yard and approaches to the terminal.  At an earlier point, River City was meant to be a complex of three 68-story office and residential towers stretching along the Chicago River from Harrison to Roosevelt, but only the smaller apartment building was ever completed.  Plans for an office tower, condominiums, or retail development on the Grand Central Station terminal site have all been proposed over the past several years, and all have been shelved.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The land on the corner of Harrison and Wells, the lot on which the station itself stood, which is still owned by <a href="/wiki/CSX_Transportation" id="w">CSX Transportation</a> (the successor company to the B&#38;O), continues to be vacant. The site is currently a <i>de facto</i> <a href="/wiki/Dog_park" id="w">dog park</a> used by local residents, although outlines of platforms and building foundations hint at the lot&#39;s former use.</p>

<p>At the time Grand Central was completed, passenger trains approached the terminal by crossing the Chicago River to the southwest over a bridge between Taylor Street and <a href="/wiki/Roosevelt_Road" id="w">Roosevelt Road</a>, constructed in 1885. This first bridge was replaced by a taller structure in 1901 to accommodate larger boats and ships on the south branch of the river.  When the Chicago River was straightened and widened in the 1930s, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_War" id="w">War Department</a> insisted the Baltimore and Ohio build a new bridge adjacent to that of the <a href="/wiki/St._Charles_Air_Line_Railroad" id="w">St. Charles Air Line Railroad</a> which crossed the river between 15th and 16th Streets.  The new bridge&#39;s location, about seven blocks south of their previous crossing, exacerbated the circuitous route of the B&#38;OCT trackage leading to Grand Central Station.  Both the B&#38;O bridge, and of the St. Charles Air Line immediately adjacent to it, were built in 1930, and both are <a href="/wiki/Bascule_bridge" id="w">bascule bridges</a>.  </p>
<p>The B&#38;OCT bridge, like the terminal and the tracks, has been abandoned.  However, it was not dismantled and remains permanently locked in an &#34;open&#34; position. Because they are bascule bridges, both the B&#38;OCT and the Air Line bridges each have a counterweight of their own, and in this case, they share a common third counterweight between them.  This design allowed them to operate in unison, with an operator from the B&#38;OCT in charge of operating both bridges.  This has led to a curious historical oddity, as the CSX, successor railroad to the B&#38;O, owns a useless bridge that it cannot abandon, because the bridge is needed to continue operating a second bridge it does not own.  An uncertain but inevitable future awaits the old B&#38;OCT bridge, as the trackage it once served will surely never be rebuilt.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
