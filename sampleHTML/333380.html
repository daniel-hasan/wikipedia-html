<p>American pornography refers mainly to the <a href="/wiki/Internet" id="w">internet</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adult_movies" id="w">adult movies</a>, publications (with mainstream journals <i><a href="/wiki/Playboy" id="w">Playboy</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Penthouse_magazine" id="w">Penthouse</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Hustler_(magazine)" id="w">Hustler</a></i>) and <a href="/wiki/Pay-per-view" id="w">pay-per-view</a> broadcasting. The so-called portable porn market is in its initial stage in the US.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Cellphone companies are reluctant to become partners with the adult entertainment for fear of being stigmatised by community standards.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 1979 Revision of the Federal Criminal Code stated that &#34;in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" id="w">Los Angeles</a> alone, the porno business does $100 million a year in gross retain volume&#34; while &#34;the average porno magazine sells for between $6 and $10 each&#34;. According to the 1986 Attorney General&#39;s Commission on Pornography, American adult entertainment industry has grown considerably over the past thirty years by continually changing and expanding to appeal to new markets, though the production is considered to be low-profile and clandestine.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> The total income of modern country&#39;s adult entertainment is often rated at $10-13 billion,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> of which 4-6 billion are legal. The figure is often credited to a study by <a href="/wiki/Forrester_Research" id="w">Forrester Research</a> and was lowered in 1998.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Other sources, quoted by <a href="/wiki/Forbes" id="w">Forbes</a> (Adams Media Research, Veronis Suhler Communications Industry Report, IVD), even taking into consideration all possible means (video networks and pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite, <a href="/wiki/Web_site" id="w">web sites</a>, in-room hotel movies, phone sex, sex toys and magazines) mention the $2.6-3.9 billion figure (without the cellphone component). <i>USA Today</i> claimed in 2003 that websites such as <a class="externallink" href="http://www.danni.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.danni.com/">Danni&#39;s Hard Drive</a> and <a class="externallink" href="http://www.cybererotica.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cybererotica.com/">Cybererotica.com</a> generated $2 billion in revenue in that year, which was allegedly about 10% of the overall domestic porn market at the time.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> The adult movies income (from sale and rent) was once estimated by &#34;<a href="/wiki/Adult_Video_News" id="w">AVN</a> Publications&#34; at $4.3 billion but the figure obtaining is unclear.

The term &#34;pornography&#34; (from <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> πόρνη (pórnē), a prostitute) first comes from an 1857 British <a href="/wiki/Medical_dictionary" id="w">medical dictionary</a>, which defined it as &#34;a description of prostitutes or of prostitution, as a matter of public hygiene&#34;,<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> therefore pornography by itself was not a widely used term in nineteenth-century America<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> and the term did not appear in any version of <i><a href="/wiki/American_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language" id="w">American Dictionary of the English Language</a></i> in its early editions. The dictionary introduced the entry in 1864, defining it primarily as a &#34;treatment of, or a treatise on, the subject of prostitutes or prostitution&#34;. Early charges used the term &#34;obscenity&#34; as well as after <i>Miller v. California</i>, though the term &#34;pornography&#34; remained as a reference entry:</p>

During the Warren Court (1953-1969), the first notable to face the cases of such kind, justices Potter Stewart, <a href="/wiki/Byron_White" id="w">Byron White</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Goldberg" id="w">Arthur Goldberg</a> shared the opinion that only hardcore pornography was not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> This position was contested notably by <a href="/wiki/United_States_Solicitor_General" id="w">U.S. Solicitor General</a> <a href="/wiki/James_Lee_Rankin" id="w">James Lee Rankin</a> (in office 1956-1961),<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> but in Jacobellis v. Ohio Stewart concluded that criminal obscenity laws are constitutionally limited under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to hardcore pornography.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Concurring in the 1957 <a href="/wiki/Roth_v._United_States" id="w">Roth v. United States</a> Justice <a href="/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan_II" id="w">John Marshall Harlan II</a> wrote: &#34;[E]ven assuming that pornography cannot be deemed ever to cause in an immediate sense, criminal...conduct, other interests within the proper cognizance of the State may be protected by the prohibition placed on such materials.&#34; The 1967 <a href="/wiki/Public_Law" id="w">Public Law</a> 90-100 found the traffic in pornography to be &#34;a matter of national concern&#34;, as well as in obscenity.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> In this period the Court considered pornography to have two major dimensions. The first can be defined as dealing with sexual representations that are offensive to public morality or taste, which concerned the Court notably in the 1966 <a href="/wiki/Ginzburg_v._United_States" id="w">Ginzburg v. United States</a> case. The second centers on the effect of pornography on specific individuals or classes, which is the focus of most public discussions and prior Court pornography decisions. This dimension was mentioned only twice in the array of decisions made in 1966. A frustration was expressed notably by Justice <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Black" id="w">Hugo Black</a> in the 1966 <a href="/wiki/Mishkin_v._New_York" id="w">Mishkin v. New York</a>: &#34;I wish once more to express my objections to saddling this Court with the irksome and inevitably unpopular and unwholesome task of finally deciding by a case-by-case, sight-by-sight personal judgment of the members of this Court what pornography (whatever that means) is too hard core for people to see or read.&#34;<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> In the 1974 <a href="/wiki/Hamling_v._United_States" id="w">Hamling v. United States</a> decision the Supreme Court said that just because pornographic materials are for sale and purchased around the country, &#34;does not make them witnesses of virtue... Mere availability of similar materials by itself means nothing more than that other persons are engaged in similar activities.&#34;<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> The 1976 <i><a href="/wiki/American_Heritage_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language" id="w">American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</a></i> defined that pornography consists of &#34;written, graphic, or other forms of communication intended to excite lascivious feelings&#34;. Since determining what is pornography and what is &#34;soft core&#34; and &#34;hard core&#34; are subjective questions to judges, juries and law enforcement officials, it is difficult to define, since the law cases cannot print examples for the courts to follow.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Rehnquist_Court" id="w">Rehnquist Court</a> further enhanced the power of community controls on pornography.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Current Chief Justice <a href="/wiki/John_Roberts" id="w">John Roberts</a> told at the confirmation hearing on his nomination: &#34;...it&#39;s my understanding under the Supreme Court&#39;s doctrine that pornographic expression is not protected to the same extent at least as political and core speech, and the difficulty that the Court has addressed in these different areas of course is always defining what is or is not pornography...&#34;<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

The so-called &#34;sex wars&#34; of the late seventies<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> challenged the traditional understanding of the gender role.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Andrea_Dworkin" id="w">Andrea Dworkin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Catharine_MacKinnon" id="w">Catharine MacKinnon</a> became well-known often-cited anti-pornography authors.

Other notable American anti-pornography activists to belong to this camp are <a href="/wiki/Robin_Morgan" id="w">Robin Morgan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Susan_Griffin" id="w">Susan Griffin</a>. Ordinary <a href="/wiki/Libertarian" id="w">libertarians</a>, who separate sex and violence, take MacKinnon and Dworkin to task for their refusal to leave sexual expression alone.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> This was done particularly by Gillian Rodgerson and Elizabeth Wilson in <i>Pornography and Feminism: The Case Against Censorship</i>: &#34;Yet this theoretical cocktail of biologism and <a href="/wiki/Behaviourism" id="w">behaviourism</a> is lethal. To see men as naturally programmed for violence is to endorse the most conservative views on human nature, and to see it as unchanging and unchangeable&#34;. Rodgerson and Wilson argue that pornography plays a relatively minor role in the wider regime of <a href="/wiki/Sexist" id="w">sexist</a> practices pervading women&#39;s lives.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>The famous Indianapolis definition of pornography by Dworkin and MacKinnon paralleled their Minneapolis ordinance. The first was rejected by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Seventh_Circuit" id="w">United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> for several reasons. The ordinance did not use any of the accepted terms that the Supreme Court had developed over time for determining when material is obscene, including &#34;prurient interest&#34;, &#34;offensiveness&#34; or &#34;local community standarts&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Moral_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Moral" title="">[45]</a></sup> Another concern was the way the women were depicted in the work. If women were referred to in the approved fashion stressing equality, the activity involved would be regardless of how sexually explicit it was.<sup id="_ref-Moral_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Moral" title="">[45]</a></sup> The Court also indicated that if women were referred to in a disapproving way depicting them as subversive or as enjoying humiliation, the activity would be unlawful regardless of the &#34;literary, artistic or political qualities of the work taken as a whole&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Moral_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Moral" title="">[45]</a></sup> Judge <a href="/wiki/Frank_Easterbrook" id="w">Frank Easterbrook</a> said: &#34;We accept the premises of this legislation. Depictions of subordination tend to perpetuate subordination. The subordinate status of women in turn leads to affront and lower pay at work, insult and injury at home, battery and <a href="/wiki/Rape" id="w">rape</a> on the streets... but... this simply demonstrates the power of pornography as speech.&#34;<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> <i>Conceptions of Democracy in American Constitutional Argument: The Case of Pornography Regulation</i> by <a href="/wiki/Frank_Michelman" id="w">Frank Michelman</a>, issued by Tennessee Law Review (vol. 56, no. 291, 1989) partially consented that &#34;pornography is political expression in that it promulgates a certain view of women&#39;s natures and thus of women&#39;s appropriate relations and treatment in society&#34;, but also concluded that the Indianopolis ordinance was precisely designed to suppress that particular view by censoring pornography.

<p>Another matter, which frequently circulates in American anti-pornography movement is a close bond of pornography with rape. According to <i>Porn Up, Rape Down</i> by <a href="/wiki/Northwestern_University" id="w">Northwestern University</a> Law Professor Anthony D’amato, &#34;the incidence of rape in the United States has declined 85 per cent in the past 25 years while access to pornography has become freely available to teenagers and adults&#34;. Recognizing that the Nixon and Reagan Commissions tried to show that exposure to pornographic materials produced social violence, D&#39;amato concludes that &#34;the reverse may be true: that pornography has reduced social violence&#34;. D&#39;amato suggests there are two predominant reasons why an increase in the availability of pornography has led to a reduction in rape. First, using pornographic material provides an easy avenue for the sexually desirous to &#34;get it out of their system&#34;. Second, D&#39;amato points to the so-called &#34;Victorian effect&#34;. It dates back to the British <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era" id="w">Victorian era</a> where people covered up their bodies with an immense amount of clothing, generating a greater mystery as to what they looked like naked. D&#39;amato suggests that the free availability of pornography since the 1970s, and the recent bombardment of internet pornography, has de-mystified sex, thus satisfying the sexually curious.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
