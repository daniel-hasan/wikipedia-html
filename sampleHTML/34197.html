An <b>X-ray</b> (or <b>Röntgen ray</b>) is a form of <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" id="w">electromagnetic radiation</a> with a <a href="/wiki/Wavelength" id="w">wavelength</a> in the range of 10 to 0.01 <a href="/wiki/Nanometer" id="w">nanometers</a>, corresponding to <a href="/wiki/Frequency" id="w">frequencies</a> in the range 30 <a href="/wiki/Hertz" id="w">PHz</a> to 30 <a href="/wiki/Hertz" id="w">EHz</a>. X-rays are primarily used for diagnostic <a href="/wiki/Radiography" id="w">radiography</a> and <a href="/wiki/X-ray_crystallography" id="w">crystallography</a>.  X-rays are a form of <a href="/wiki/Ionizing_radiation" id="w">ionizing radiation</a> and as such can be dangerous. In many languages it is called <i>Röntgen radiation</i> after one of the first investigators of the X-rays, <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_Conrad_R%C3%B6ntgen" id="w">Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen</a>.</p>
<a id="Unit_of_measure_and_exposure" name="Unit_of_measure_and_exposure"></a><h1>Unit of measure and exposure</h1>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/R%C3%B6ntgen_equivalent_man" id="w">rem</a> is the traditional unit of dose equivalent. This describes the Energy delivered by <span class="math">\gamma</span> or X-radiation (indirectly ionizing radiation) for humans. The SI counterpart is the sievert (Sv). One sievert is equal to 100 rem. Because the rem is a relatively large unit, typical equivalent dose is measured in millirem (mrem), or one thousandth of a rem.</p>
<p>The average person living in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> is exposed to approximately 150 mrem annually from <a href="/wiki/Background_radiation" id="w">background sources</a> alone. </p>
<p>Reported dosage due to dental X-rays seems to vary significantly. Depending on the source, a typical dental X-ray of a human results in an exposure of perhaps, 3<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>, 40<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>, 300<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>, or as many as 900<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> mrems.</p>

<p>X-rays are a type of <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation" id="w">electromagnetic radiation</a> with wavelengths of around 10<sup>-10</sup> metres. When medical X-rays are being produced, a thin metallic sheet is placed between the emitter and the target, effectively filtering out the lower energy (soft) X-rays. This is often placed close to the window of the <a href="/wiki/X-ray_tube" id="w">X-ray tube</a>. The resultant X-ray is said to be <i>hard.</i> Soft X-rays overlap the range of <a href="/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet" id="w">extreme ultraviolet</a>. The frequency of hard X-rays is higher than that of soft X-rays, and the wavelength is shorter. Hard X-rays overlap the range of &#34;long&#34;-wavelength (lower energy) <a href="/wiki/Gamma_rays" id="w">gamma rays</a>, however the distinction between the two terms depends on the source of the radiation, not its wavelength; X-ray <a href="/wiki/Photon" id="w">photons</a> are generated by energetic <a href="/wiki/Electron" id="w">electron</a> processes, gamma rays by transitions within <a href="/wiki/Atomic_nucleus" id="w">atomic nuclei</a>.</p>

<p>The basic production of X-rays is by accelerating electrons in order to collide with a metal target. (In medical applications, this is usually <a href="/wiki/Tungsten" id="w">tungsten</a> or a more crack resistant alloy of <a href="/wiki/Rhenium" id="w">rhenium</a> (5%) and tungsten (95%), but sometimes <a href="/wiki/Molybdenum" id="w">molybdenum</a> for more specialised applications, such as when soft X-rays are needed as in mammography. In crystallography, a <a href="/wiki/Copper" id="w">copper</a> target is most common, with <a href="/wiki/Cobalt" id="w">cobalt</a> often being used when fluorescence from <a href="/wiki/Iron" id="w">iron</a> content in the sample might otherwise present a problem). Here the electrons suddenly decelerate upon colliding with the metal target and if enough energy is contained within the electron it is able to knock out an electron from the inner <a href="/wiki/Electron_shell" id="w">shell</a> of the metal atom and as a result electrons from higher energy levels then fill up the vacancy and X-ray photons are emitted. This process is extremely inefficient (~0.1%) and thus to produce reasonable flux of X-rays plenty of energy has to be wasted into heat which has to be removed. </p>
<p>The spectral lines generated depends on the target (anode) element used and thus are called characteristic lines. Usually these are transitions from upper shells into K shell (called <a href="/wiki/K-alpha" id="w">K lines</a>), into L shell (called L lines) and so on.  There is also a continuum <i><a href="/wiki/Bremsstrahlung" id="w">Bremsstrahlung</a></i> radiation given off by the electrons as they are scattered by the strong electric field near the high-<i>Z</i> (<a href="/wiki/Proton" id="w">proton</a> number) nuclei.</p>
<p>X-rays can detect <a href="/wiki/Cancer" id="w">cancer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cyst" id="w">cysts</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tumor" id="w">tumors</a>. Due to their short wavelength, in medical applications X-rays act more like a particle than a wave. This is in contrast to their application in crystallagraphy, where their wave-like nature is most important.</p>
<p>Nowadays, for many (non-medical) applications, X-ray production is achieved by <a href="/wiki/Synchrotron" id="w">synchrotrons</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Synchrotron_light" id="w">synchrotron light</a>).</p>
<p>To create a blood or artery X-ray, also called digital angiography, iodine is injected into the veins and a digitized image is created. Then, a second image is established of only the parts of the X-rayed section without iodine. The first image is subtracted then a final image is produced containing both the first and second images together.  Lastly, the results are printed. The doctor or surgeon then compares the results of the angiography to a perfect angiography structure to see if there are any malfunctions.</p>
<p>To take an X-ray of the bones, no iodization is required. Short X-ray pulses are shot through a body at first. Next, the bones absorb the most waves because they are more dense and contain calcium which absorbs more rays than the carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms of the soft tissue because there are more electrons in a calcium atom.</p>
<a id="Detectors" name="Detectors"></a><h1>Detectors</h1>
<a id="Photographic_plate" name="Photographic_plate"></a><h2>Photographic plate</h2>
<p>The detection of X-rays is based on various methods. The most commonly known method are a <a href="/wiki/Photographic_plate" id="w">photographic plate</a>, X-ray <a href="/wiki/Photographic_film" id="w">film</a> in a cassette, and <a href="/wiki/Rare_earth_element" id="w">rare earth</a> screens.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Photographic_plate" id="w">photographic plate</a> or film is used in <a href="/wiki/Hospital" id="w">hospitals</a> to produce images of the internal organs and bones of a patient. They are also used in industrial radiography processes.  Since photographic plates are sensitive to X-rays, they provide a convenient and easy means of recording the image. X-ray film is usually provided as pre-loaded paper cartridges with the film inside a light proof paper envelope.  An additional paper coated in a thin layer of lead is often included in contact with the photographic film.  The lead reflects the x-rays back through the photo film thus more or less doubling the sensitivity of the assembly.  Thus the photographic film has to be used the right way round, and is marked as such.  The emulsion is frequently coated on both sides of the film or plate in order to increase the sensitivity further. </p>
<p>The part of the patient to be X-rayed is placed between the X-ray source and the photographic receptor to produce what is a shadow of all the internal structure of that particular part of the body being X-rayed. The X-rays are blocked by dense tissues such as bone and pass through soft tissues. Those areas where the X-rays strike the photographic receptor turn black when it is developed. So where the X-rays pass through &#34;soft&#34; parts of the body such as organs, muscle, and skin, the plate or film turns black. Contrast compounds containing <a href="/wiki/Barium" id="w">barium</a> or <a href="/wiki/Iodine" id="w">iodine</a>, which are <a href="/wiki/Radiopaque" id="w">radiopaque</a>, can be injected in the artery of a particular organ, or given intravenously. The contrast compounds essentially block the X-rays and hence the circulation of the organ can be more readily seen. Many years ago <a href="/wiki/Thorium" id="w">thorium</a> was used as a contrast medium (Thorotrast) — this caused many people to be injured or even die from the effects of the radiation from the thorium.</p>
<p>Photographic plates are losing favour in many X-ray facilities because of the necessity to have processing facilities readily to hand, and because the photographic plates themselves, plus the processing chemicals are relatively expensive consumables.</p>
<a id="Photostimulable_phosphors_(PSPs)" name="Photostimulable_phosphors_(PSPs)"></a><h2>Photostimulable phosphors (PSPs)</h2>
<p>An increasingly common method of detecting X-rays is the use of Photostimulable Luminescence (PSL), pioneered by Fuji in the 1980s. In modern hospitals a PSP plate is used in place of the photographic plate. After the plate is X-rayed, excited electrons in the phosphor material remain &#39;trapped&#39; in &#39;colour centres&#39; in the crystal lattice until stimulated by a laser beam passed over the plate surface. The light given off during laser stimulation is collected by a photomultiplier tube and the resulting signal is converted into a digital image by computer technology, which gives this process its common name, <a href="/wiki/Computed_radiography" id="w">computed radiography</a> (also referred to as <b>digital radiography</b>). The PSP plate can be used over and over again, and existing x-ray equipment requires no modification to use them.</p>
<a id="Geiger_counter" name="Geiger_counter"></a><h2>Geiger counter</h2>
<p>Initially, most common detection methods were based on the <a href="/wiki/Plasma_(physics)" id="w">ionization of gases</a>, as in the <a href="/wiki/Geiger_counter" id="w">Geiger-Müller counter</a>: a sealed volume, usually a cylinder, with a mica, polymer or thin metal window contains a gas, and a wire, and a high voltage is applied between the cylinder (<a href="/wiki/Cathode" id="w">cathode</a>) and the wire (<a href="/wiki/Anode" id="w">anode</a>). When an X-ray photon enters the cylinder, it ionizes the gas and forms ions and electrons. Electrons accelerate toward the anode, in the process causing further ionization along their trajectory. This process, known as an avalanche, is detected as a sudden flow of current, called a &#34;count&#34; or &#34;event&#34;.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the electrons form a virtual cathode around the anode wire drastically reducing the electric field in the outer portions of the tube. This halts the collisional ionizations and limits further growth of avalanches. As a result, all &#34;counts&#34; on a Geiger counter are the same size and it can give no indication as to the particle energy of the radiation, unlike the <a href="/wiki/Proportional_counter" id="w">proportional counter</a>. The intensity of the radiation is measurable by the Geiger counter as the counting-rate of the system.</p>
<p>In order to gain energy spectrum information a <a href="/wiki/Diffraction" id="w">diffracting</a> crystal may be used to first separate the different photons, the method is called <a href="/wiki/Wavelength_dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy" id="w">wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy</a> (<a href="/wiki/WDX" id="w">WDX</a> or WDS). Position-sensitive detectors are often used in conjunction with dispersive elements. Other detection equipment may be used which are inherently energy-resolving, such as the aforementioned <a href="/wiki/Proportional_counter" id="w">proportional counters</a>. In either case, use of suitable pulse-processing (MCA) equipment allows digital spectra to be created for later analysis.</p>
<p>For many applications, counters are not sealed but are constantly fed with purified gas (thus reducing problems of contamination or gas aging). These are called &#34;flow counter&#34;.</p>
<a id="Scintillators" name="Scintillators"></a><h2>Scintillators</h2>
<p>Some materials such as <a href="/wiki/Sodium_iodide" id="w">sodium iodide</a> (NaI) can &#34;convert&#34; an X-ray photon to a visible photon; an electronic detector can be built by adding a <a href="/wiki/Photomultiplier" id="w">photomultiplier</a>. These detectors are called &#34;<a href="/wiki/Scintillator" id="w">scintillators</a>&#34;, filmscreens or &#34;<a href="/wiki/Scintillation_counter" id="w">scintillation counters</a>&#34;. The main advantage of using these is that an adequate image can be obtained while subjecting the patient to a much lower dose of X-rays.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">X-ray during <a href="/wiki/Cholecystectomy" id="w">Cholecystectomy</a></div></div>

X-rays are also used in &#34;real-time&#34; procedures such as <a href="/wiki/Angiography" id="w">angiography</a> or contrast studies of the hollow organs (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Barium_enema" id="w">barium enema</a> of the small or large intestine) using <a href="/wiki/Fluoroscopy" id="w">fluoroscopy</a> acquired using an <a href="/wiki/X-ray_image_intensifier" id="w">X-ray image intensifier</a>. <a href="/wiki/Angioplasty" id="w">Angioplasty</a>, medical interventions of the arterial system, rely heavily on X-ray-sensitive contrast to identify potentially treatable lesions.</p>
<a id="Direct_semiconductor_detectors" name="Direct_semiconductor_detectors"></a><h2>Direct semiconductor detectors</h2>
<p>Since the 1970s, new <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor_detector" id="w">semiconductor detectors</a> have been developed (<a href="/wiki/Silicon" id="w">silicon</a> or <a href="/wiki/Germanium" id="w">germanium</a> doped with <a href="/wiki/Lithium" id="w">lithium</a>, Si(Li) or Ge(Li)). X-ray photons are converted to electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor and are collected to detect the X-rays. When the temperature is low enough (the detector is cooled by <a href="/wiki/Peltier_effect" id="w">Peltier effect</a> or even cooler <a href="/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen" id="w">liquid nitrogen</a>), it is possible to directly determine the X-ray energy spectrum; this method is called <a href="/wiki/Energy_dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy" id="w">energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy</a> (EDX or EDS); it is often used in small <a href="/wiki/X-ray_fluorescence" id="w">X-ray fluorescence</a> <a href="/wiki/Spectroscopy" id="w">spectrometers</a>. These detectors are sometimes called &#34;<a href="/wiki/Solid_state" id="w">solid state</a> detectors&#34;. <a href="/wiki/Cadmium_telluride" id="w">Cadmium telluride</a> (<a href="/wiki/Cadmium" id="w">CdTe</a>) and its alloy with <a href="/wiki/Zinc" id="w">zinc</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cadmium_zinc_telluride" id="w">cadmium zinc telluride</a> detectors have an increased sensitivity, which allows lower doses of X-rays to be used.</p>
<p>Practical application in <a href="/wiki/Medical_imaging" id="w">medical imaging</a> didn&#39;t start taking place until the 1990s. Currently amorphous <a href="/wiki/Selenium" id="w">selenium</a> is used in commercial large area flat panel X-ray detectors for <a href="/wiki/Mammography" id="w">mammography</a> and chest <a href="/wiki/Radiography" id="w">radiography</a>. Current research and development is focussed around pixel detectors, such as <a href="/wiki/CERN" id="w">CERN</a>&#39;s energy resolving <a href="/wiki/Medipix" id="w">Medipix</a> detector.</p>
<p>Note: A standard <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor" id="w">semiconductor</a> <a href="/wiki/Diode" id="w">diode</a>, such as a 1N4007, will produce a small amount of current when placed in an X-ray beam. A test device once used by Medical Imaging Service personnel was a small project box that contained several diodes of this type in <a href="/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits#Series circuits" id="w">series</a>, which could be connected to an <a href="/wiki/Oscilloscope" id="w">oscilloscope</a> as a quick diagnostic. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Silicon_drift_detector" id="w">Silicon drift detectors</a> (SDDs), produced by conventional <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor_fabrication" id="w">semiconductor fabrication</a>, now provide a cost-effective and high resolving power radiation measurement. Unlike conventional X-ray detectors, such as Si(Li)s, they do not need to be cooled with liquid nitrogen.</p>
<a id="Scintillator_plus_semiconductor_detectors_(indirect_detection)" name="Scintillator_plus_semiconductor_detectors_(indirect_detection)"></a><h2>Scintillator plus semiconductor detectors (indirect detection)</h2>
<p>With the advent of large semiconductor array detectors it has become possible to design detector systems using a scintillator screen to convert from X-rays to visible light which is then converted to electrical signals in an array detector.  Indirect Flat Panel Detectors (FPDs) are in widespread use today in medical, dental, veterinary and industrial applications. A common form of these detectors is based on <a href="/wiki/Amorphous_silicon" id="w">amorphous silicon</a> <a href="/wiki/TFT" id="w">TFT</a>/<a href="/wiki/Photodiode" id="w">photodiode</a> arrays. </p> 
<p>The array technology is a variant on the amorphous silicon TFT arrays used in many <a href="/wiki/Flat_panel_display" id="w">flat panel displays</a>, like the ones in computer laptops. The array consists of a sheet of glass covered with a thin layer of silicon that is in an amorphous or disordered state. At a microscopic scale, the silicon has been imprinted with millions of transistors arranged in a highly ordered array, like the grid on a sheet of graph paper. Each of these <a href="/wiki/Thin_film_transistor" id="w">thin film transistors</a> (TFTs) are attached to a light-absorbing photodiode making up an individual <a href="/wiki/Pixel" id="w">pixel</a> (picture element).  Photons striking the photodiode are converted into two <a href="/wiki/Charge_carrier" id="w">carriers of electrical charge</a>, called electron-hole pairs.  Since the number of charge carriers produced will vary with the intensity of incoming light photons, an electrical pattern is created that can be swiftly converted to a voltage and then a digital signal, which is interpreted by a computer to produce a digital image.  Although silicon has outstanding electronic properties, it is not a particularly good absorber of X-ray photons. For this reason, X-rays first impinge upon <a href="/wiki/Scintillator" id="w">scintillators</a> made from eg. <a href="/wiki/Gadolinium_oxysulfide" id="w">gadolinium oxysulfide</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cesium_iodide" id="w">cesium iodide</a>. The scintillator absorbs the X-rays and converts them into visible light photons that then pass onto the photodiode array.</p>
<a id="Visibility_to_the_human_eye" name="Visibility_to_the_human_eye"></a><h2>Visibility to the human eye</h2>
<p>While generally considered invisible to the human eye, in special circumstances X-rays can be visible. Brandes, in an experiment a short time after <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen" id="w">Röntgen&#39;s</a> landmark 1895 paper, reported after dark adaptation and placing his eye close to an X-ray tube, seeing a faint &#34;blue-gray&#34; glow which seemed to originate within the eye itself.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/invisiblelight.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/invisiblelight.htm">http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/invisiblelight.htm</a> Upon hearing this, Röntgen reviewed his record books and found he too had seen the effect. When placing an X-ray tube on the opposite side of a wooden door Röntgen had noted the same blue glow, seeming to emanate from the eye itself, but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube. Later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough to make the glow plainly visible and the <a href="/wiki/Experiment" id="w">experiment</a> was thereafter readily repeatable. The knowledge that X-rays are actually faintly visible to the dark-adapted naked eye has largely been forgotten today; this is probably due to the desire not to repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and harmful experiment with <a href="/wiki/Ionizing_radiation" id="w">ionizing radiation</a>. It is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility: it could be due to conventional detection (excitation of <a href="/wiki/Rhodopsin" id="w">rhodopsin</a> molecules in the retina), direct excitation of retinal nerve cells, or secondary detection via, for instance, X-ray induction of <a href="/wiki/Phosphorescence" id="w">phosphorescence</a> in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light.</p>
<p>If the intensity of an X-ray beam is high enough, the <a href="/wiki/Ionization" id="w">ionization</a> of the air will make the beam visible with a white glow.</p>

Since Röntgen&#39;s discovery that X-rays can identify bony structures, X-rays have been developed for their use in <a href="/wiki/Medical_imaging" id="w">medical imaging</a>. <a href="/wiki/Radiology" id="w">Radiology</a> is a specialized field of <a href="/wiki/Medicine" id="w">medicine</a>. Radiographers employ <a href="/wiki/Radiography" id="w">radiography</a> and other techniques for <a href="/wiki/Diagnostic_imaging" id="w">diagnostic imaging</a>. Indeed, this is probably the most common use of X-ray technology.</p>
<p>X-rays are especially useful in the detection of pathology of the <a href="/wiki/Bone" id="w">skeletal system</a>, but are also useful for detecting some disease processes in <a href="/wiki/Soft_tissue" id="w">soft tissue</a>. Some notable examples are the very common <a href="/wiki/Chest_X-ray" id="w">chest X-ray</a>, which can be used to identify lung diseases such as <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" id="w">pneumonia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lung_cancer" id="w">lung cancer</a> or <a href="/wiki/Pulmonary_edema" id="w">pulmonary edema</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Abdominal_X-ray" id="w">abdominal X-ray</a>, which can detect <a href="/wiki/Ileus" id="w">ileus</a> (blockage of the <a href="/wiki/Intestine" id="w">intestine</a>), free air (from visceral perforations) and free fluid (in <a href="/wiki/Ascites" id="w">ascites</a>). In some cases, the use of X-rays is debatable, such as <a href="/wiki/Gallstone" id="w">gallstones</a> (which are rarely <a href="/wiki/Radiopaque" id="w">radiopaque</a>) or <a href="/wiki/Kidney_stone" id="w">kidney stones</a> (which are often visible, but not always). Also, traditional plain X-rays pose very little use in the imaging of soft tissues such as the <a href="/wiki/Brain" id="w">brain</a> or <a href="/wiki/Muscle" id="w">muscle</a>.

The experiment involved creating a potential difference in a vacuum and slowly reducing the completeness of the vacuum by introducing mercury vapour into it. From the paper: &#34;according to the length of time during which the mercury was boiled, the &#39;electric&#39; light turned violet, then purple, then a beautiful green...and then the light became invisible&#34;. This progression was the result of the wavelength of the radiation caused by the electric current decreasing beyond the visible range and into X-ray wavelengths.</p>
<a id="Johann_Hittorf" name="Johann_Hittorf"></a><h2>Johann Hittorf</h2>
<p>Physicist <a href="/wiki/Johann_Hittorf" id="w">Johann Hittorf</a> (1824 - 1914) observed <a href="/wiki/Vacuum_tube" id="w">tubes</a> with energy rays extending from a negative electrode. These rays produced a fluorescence when they hit the glass walls of the tubes. In 1876 the effect was named &#34;<a href="/wiki/Cathode_ray" id="w">cathode rays</a>&#34; by <a href="/wiki/Eugen_Goldstein" id="w">Eugen Goldstein</a>, and today are known to be streams of <a href="/wiki/Electron" id="w">electrons</a>.  Later, English physicist <a href="/wiki/William_Crookes" id="w">William Crookes</a> investigated the effects of electric currents in gases at low pressure, and constructed what is called the Crookes tube. It is a glass cylinder mostly (but not completely) evacuated, containing electrodes for discharges of a high voltage electric current. He found, when he placed unexposed photographic plates near the tube, that some of them were flawed by shadows, though he did not investigate this effect.  Crookes also noted that his cathode rays caused the glass walls of his tube to glow a dull blue colour.  Crookes failed to realise that it wasn&#39;t actually the cathode rays that caused the blue glow, but the low level x-rays produced when the cathode rays struck the glass.

<p>As a result of experiments into what he called cold light <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Pulyui" id="w">Ivan Pulyui</a> is reputed to have developed an X-ray emitting device as early as 1881. He reputedly first demonstrated an X-ray photograph of a 13-year-old boy&#39;s broken arm and an X-ray photograph of his daughter&#39;s hand with a pin lying under it. The device became known as the Pulyui lamp and was mass-produced for a period. Reputedly, Pulyui personally presented one to Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen who went on to be credited as the major developer of the technology. Pulyui published his results in a scientific paper, Luminous Electrical Matter and the Fourth State of Matter in the Notes of the Austrian Imperial Academy of Sciences (1880-1883), but expressed his ideas in an obscure manner using obsolete terminology. Pulyui did gain some recognition when the work was translated and published as a book by the Royal Society in the UK.
</p><a id="Nikola_Tesla" name="Nikola_Tesla"></a><h2>Nikola Tesla</h2>
<p>In April 1887, <a href="/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" id="w">Nikola Tesla</a> began to investigate X-rays using high voltages and tubes of his own design, as well as Crookes tubes. From his technical publications, it is indicated that he invented and developed a special single-electrode X-ray tube <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>, which differed from other X-ray tubes in having no target electrode. The principle behind Tesla&#39;s device is nowadays called the <a href="/wiki/Bremsstrahlung" id="w">Bremsstrahlung</a> process, in which a high-energy secondary X-ray emission is produced when charged particles (such as electrons) pass through matter. By 1892, Tesla performed several such experiments, but he did not categorize the emissions as what were later called X-rays. Tesla generalized the phenomenon as <a href="/wiki/Radiant_energy" id="w">radiant energy</a> of &#34;invisible&#34; kinds.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Tesla stated the facts of his methods concerning various experiments in his 1897 X-ray lecture <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> before the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Academy_of_Sciences" id="w">New York Academy of Sciences</a>. Also in this lecture, Tesla stated the method of construction and safe operation of X-ray equipment. His X-ray experimentation by vacuum high field emissions also led him to alert the scientific community to the biological hazards associated with X-ray exposure.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Fernando_Sanford" name="Fernando_Sanford"></a><h2>Fernando Sanford</h2>

<p>X-rays were first generated and detected by <a href="/wiki/Fernando_Sanford" id="w">Fernando Sanford</a> (1854-1948), the foundation Professor of Physics at <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" id="w">Stanford University</a>, in 1891. From 1886 to 1888 he had studied in the <a href="/wiki/Hermann_Helmholtz" id="w">Hermann Helmholtz</a> laboratory in Berlin, where he became familiar with the cathode rays generated in vacuum tubes when a voltage was applied across separate electrodes, as previously studied by <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz" id="w">Heinrich Hertz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Philipp_Lenard" id="w">Philipp Lenard</a>.  His letter of <a href="/wiki/January_6" id="w">January 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1893" id="w">1893</a> (describing his discovery as &#34;electric photography&#34;) to The <a href="/wiki/Physical_Review" id="w">Physical Review</a> was duly published and an article entitled <i>Without Lens or Light, Photographs Taken With Plate and Object in Darkness</i> appeared in the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Examiner" id="w">San Francisco Examiner</a>. <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Heinrich_Hertz" name="Heinrich_Hertz"></a><h2>Heinrich Hertz</h2>
<p>In 1892, <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz" id="w">Heinrich Hertz</a> began experimenting and demonstrated that cathode rays could penetrate very thin metal foil (such as <a href="/wiki/Aluminium" id="w">aluminium</a>). <a href="/wiki/Philipp_Lenard" id="w">Philipp Lenard</a>, a student of Heinrich Hertz, further researched this effect. He developed a version of the cathode tube and studied the penetration by X-rays of various materials. Philipp Lenard, though, did not realize that he was producing X-rays. <a href="/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz" id="w">Hermann von Helmholtz</a> formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before Röntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light (<i>Wiedmann&#39;s Annalen</i>, Vol. XLVIII).  However, he did not work with actual X-rays. </p>
<a id="Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen" name="Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen"></a><h2>Wilhelm Röntgen</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_8" id="w">November 8</a> <a href="/wiki/1895" id="w">1895</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_Conrad_R%C3%B6ntgen" id="w">Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> physics professor, began observing and further documenting X-rays while experimenting with vacuum tubes. Röntgen, on <a href="/wiki/December_28" id="w">December 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1895" id="w">1895</a>, wrote a preliminary report &#34;<i>On a new kind of ray: A preliminary communication</i>&#34;. He submitted it to the <a href="/wiki/W%C3%BCrzburg" id="w">Würzburg</a>&#39;s Physical-Medical Society journal. This was the first formal and public recognition of the categorization of X-rays. Röntgen referred to the radiation as &#34;X&#34;, to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. The name stuck, although (over Röntgen&#39;s great objections), many of his colleagues suggested calling them <b>Röntgen rays</b>. They are still referred to as such in many languages. Röntgen received the first <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" id="w">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for his discovery.</p>
<p>Röntgen was working on a primitive <a href="/wiki/Cathode" id="w">cathode</a> ray generator that was projected through a glass partially evacuated tube. Suddenly he noticed a faint green light against the wall. The odd thing he had noticed, was that the light from the cathode ray generator was traveling through a bunch of the materials in its way (paper, wood, and books). He then started to put various objects in front of the generator, and as he was doing this, he noticed that the outline of the bones from his hand were displayed on the wall. Röntgen said he did not know what to think and kept experimenting. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper translated &#34;On a New Kind of Radiation&#34; and gave a demonstration in 1896.</p>
<p>Rontgen discovered its medical use when he saw a picture of his wife&#39;s hand on a photographic plate formed due to X-rays. His wife&#39;s hand&#39;s photograph was the first ever photograph of a human body part using X-rays.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Diagram of a water cooled X-ray tube. (simplified/outdated)</div> 1895, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Edison" id="w">Thomas Edison</a> investigated materials&#39; ability to fluoresce when exposed to X-rays, and found that <a href="/wiki/Calcium_tungstate" id="w">calcium tungstate</a> was the most effective substance. Around March 1896, the fluoroscope he developed became the standard for medical X-ray examinations. Nevertheless, Edison dropped X-ray research around 1903 after the death of <a href="/wiki/Clarence_Madison_Dally" id="w">Clarence Madison Dally</a>, one of his glassblowers. Dally had a habit of testing X-ray tubes on his hands, and acquired a <a href="/wiki/Cancer" id="w">cancer</a> in them so tenacious that both arms were <a href="/wiki/Amputation" id="w">amputated</a> in a futile attempt to save his life.</p>
<a id="The_20th_century_and_beyond" name="The_20th_century_and_beyond"></a><h2>The 20th century and beyond</h2>

<p>Prior to the 20th century and for a short while after, x-rays were generated in cold cathode tubes.  These tubes had to contain a small quantity of gas (invariably air) as a current will not flow in such a tube if they are fully evacuated.  One of the problems with early x-ray tubes is that the generated x-rays caused the glass to absorb the gas and consequently the efficiency quickly falls off.  Larger and more frequently used tubes were provided with a means of restoring the air.  This often took the form of small side tube which contained a small piece of mica - a substance that traps comparatively large quantities of air within its structure.  A small electrical heater heats the mica and causes it to release a small amount of air restoring the tube&#39;s efficiency.  However the mica itself has a limited life and the restore process was consequently difficult to control.</p>
<p>In 1904, Flemming invented the <a href="/wiki/Thermionic_valve" id="w">thermionic diode valve</a> (tube).  This used a heated cathode which permitted current to flow in a vacuum.  The principle was quickly applied to x-ray tubes, and hard vacuum heated cathode x-ray tubes completely solved the problem of efficiency reduction.</p>
<p>Two years later, physicist <a href="/wiki/Charles_Glover_Barkla" id="w">Charles Barkla</a> discovered that X-rays could be scattered by gases, and that each element had a characteristic X-ray. He won the 1917 <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" id="w">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for this discovery. <a href="/wiki/Max_von_Laue" id="w">Max von Laue</a>, Paul Knipping and Walter Friedrich observed for the first time the <a href="/wiki/Diffraction" id="w">diffraction</a> of X-rays by crystals in 1912. This discovery, along with the early works of <a href="/wiki/Paul_Peter_Ewald" id="w">Paul Peter Ewald</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Henry_Bragg" id="w">William Henry Bragg</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Lawrence_Bragg" id="w">William Lawrence Bragg</a> gave birth to the field of X-ray <a href="/wiki/Crystallography" id="w">crystallography</a>. The <a href="/wiki/X-ray_tube#Coolidge_tube" id="w">Coolidge tube</a> was invented the following year by <a href="/wiki/William_D._Coolidge" id="w">William D. Coolidge</a> which permitted continuous production of X-rays; this type of tube is still in use today.</p>

<p>The use of X-rays for medical purposes (to develop into the field of <a href="/wiki/Radiation_therapy" id="w">radiation therapy</a>) was pioneered by Major <a href="/wiki/John_Hall-Edwards" id="w">John Hall-Edwards</a> in <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" id="w">Birmingham</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/X-ray_microscope" id="w">X-ray microscope</a> were invented in the 1950s. The <a href="/wiki/Chandra_X-ray_Observatory" id="w">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> launched on July 23, 1999, has been allowing the exploration of the very violent processes in the universe which produce X-rays. Unlike visible light, which is a relatively stable view of the universe, the X-ray universe is unstable, it features stars being torn apart by <a href="/wiki/Black_hole" id="w">black holes</a>, galactic collisions, and novas, <a href="/wiki/Neutron_star" id="w">neutron stars</a> that build up layers of plasma that then explode into space.</p>
<p>An <a href="/wiki/X-ray_laser" id="w">X-ray laser</a> device was proposed as part of the <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" id="w">Reagan</a> administration&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative" id="w">Strategic Defense Initiative</a> in the 1980s, but the first and only test of the device (a sort of laser &#34;blaster&#34;, or <a href="/wiki/Death_ray" id="w">death ray</a>, powered by a thermonuclear explosion) gave inconclusive results. For technical and political reasons, the overall project (including the X-ray laser) was de-funded (though was later revived by the second <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">Bush</a> administration as <a href="/wiki/National_Missile_Defense" id="w">National Missile Defense</a> using different technologies).</p>
