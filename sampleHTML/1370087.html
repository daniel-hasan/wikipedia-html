<p>Edward Curtis was born near <a href="/wiki/Whitewater%2C_Wisconsin" id="w">Whitewater, Wisconsin</a>. <sup id="_ref-loc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-loc" title="">[3]</a></sup> Curtis&#39; father, Rev. Johnson Asahel Curtis (1840-1887), was a minister and a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Civil_War" id="w">United States Civil War</a> veteran. Rev. Curtis was born in <a href="/wiki/Ohio" id="w">Ohio</a>. Rev. Curtis&#39; father was born in <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, and his mother in <a href="/wiki/Vermont" id="w">Vermont</a>. Edward&#39;s mother, Ellen Sheriff (1844-1912), was born in <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a>; and both her parents were born in <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>. Curtis&#39; siblings were Raphael Curtis (1862-c1885), who also was called Ray Curtis; Eva Curtis (1870-?); and <a href="/wiki/Asahel_Curtis" id="w">Asahel Curtis</a> (1875-1941). <sup id="_ref-census1880_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-census1880" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Around 1874 the family moved from Wisconsin to <a href="/wiki/Minnesota" id="w">Minnesota</a>, and Curtis built his own camera. In 1880 the family was living in <a href="/wiki/Cordova_Township%2C_Minnesota" id="w">Cordova Township, Minnesota</a>, where Johnson Curtis was working as a retail grocer. <sup id="_ref-census1880_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-census1880" title="">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-pbs_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pbs" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>

<p>In 1885 at the age of seventeen Edward became an apprentice photographer in <a href="/wiki/St._Paul%2C_Minnesota" id="w">St. Paul, Minnesota</a>. In 1887 the family moved to <a href="/wiki/Seattle%2C_Washington" id="w">Seattle, Washington</a>, where Edward purchased a new camera and became a partner in an existing photographic studio with Rasmus Rothi. Edward paid $150 for his 50 percent share in the studio. After about six months, Curtis left Rothi and formed a new partnership with Thomas Guptill. The new studio was called Curtis and Guptill, Photographers and Photoengravers. <sup id="_ref-makepeace_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makepeace" title="">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-loc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-loc" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1895 Curtis met and photographed <a href="/wiki/Princess_Angeline" id="w">Princess Angeline</a> (c1800-1896) aka Kickisomlo, the daughter of <a href="/wiki/Chief_Sealth" id="w">Chief Sealth</a> of <a href="/wiki/Seattle" id="w">Seattle</a>.

In 1906 <a href="/wiki/J.P._Morgan" id="w">J.P.

Morgan was to receive 25 sets and 500 original prints as his method of repayment. Curtis&#39; goal was not just to photograph, but to document, as much American Indian (Native American) traditional life as possible before that way of life disappeared. He wrote in the introduction to his first volume in 1907: &#34;The information that is to be gathered ... respecting the mode of life of one of the great races of mankind, must be collected at once or the opportunity will be lost.&#34; Curtis made over 10,000 wax cylinder recordings of Indian language and music. He took over 40,000 photographic images from over 80 tribes. He recorded tribal lore and history, and he described traditional foods, housing, garments, recreation, ceremonies, and funeral customs. He wrote biographical sketches of tribal leaders, and his material, in most cases, is the only recorded history. <sup id="_ref-makepeace_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makepeace" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Divorce" name="Divorce"></a><h1>Divorce</h1>
<p>In 1910 the family was living in Seattle and on <a href="/wiki/October_16" id="w">October 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1916" id="w">1916</a>, Clara filed for divorce. In 1919 she was granted the divorce and received the Curtis&#39; photographic studio and all of his original camera negatives as her part of the settlement. Edward went with his daughter, Beth, to the studio and destroyed all of his original glass negatives, rather than have them become the property of his ex-wife, Clara. Clara went on to manage the Curtis studio with her sister, Nellie M. Phillips (1880-?), who was married to Martin Lucus (1880-?). In 1920 Beth Curtis and her sister Florence Curtis were living in a boarding house in Seattle.

Around 1922 Curtis moved to Los Angeles with his daughter Beth, and opened a new photo studio. To earn money he worked as an assistant cameraman for <a href="/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille" id="w">Cecil B. DeMille</a> and was an uncredited assistant cameraman in the 1923 filming of <i>The Ten Commandments</i>. On October 16, 1924 Curtis sold the rights to his ethnographic motion picture <i>In the Land of the Head-Hunters</i> to the <a href="/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History" id="w">American Museum of Natural History</a>. He was paid $1,500 for the master print and the original camera negative.

<p>In 1927 after returning from <a href="/wiki/Alaska" id="w">Alaska</a> to Seattle with his daughter Beth, he was arrested for failure to pay alimony over the preceding 7 years. The total owed was $4,500, but the charges were dropped. For Christmas of 1927, the family was reunited at daughter Florence&#39;s home in <a href="/wiki/Medford%2C_Oregon" id="w">Medford, Oregon</a>. This was the first time since the divorce that Curtis was with all of his children at the same time, and it had been thirteen years since he had seen Katherine. In 1928, desperate for cash, Edward sold the rights to his project to <a href="/wiki/J._P._Morgan%2C_Jr." id="w">J.P Morgan&#39;s son</a>. In 1930 he published the concluding volume of <i>The North American Indian</i>.  In total about 280 sets were sold of his now completed <i>opus magnum</i>. In 1930 his ex-wife, Clara, was still living in Seattle operating the photo studio with their daughter Katherine. His other daughter, Florence Curtis, was still living in Medford, Oregon with her husband Henry Graybill. In 1932 his ex wife, Clara, drowned while rowing in <a href="/wiki/Puget_Sound" id="w">Puget Sound</a>, and his daughter, Katherine moved to California to be closer to her father and her sister, Beth. <sup id="_ref-makepeace_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makepeace" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1935 the rights and remaining unpublished material were sold by the Morgan estate to the Charles E. Lauriat Company in Boston for $1,000 plus a percentage of any future royalties. This included 19 complete bound sets of <i>The North American Indian</i>, thousands of individual paper prints, the copper printing plates, the unbound printed pages, and the original glass-plate negatives.

<a id="Curtis_archive_at_the_Library_of_Congress" name="Curtis_archive_at_the_Library_of_Congress"></a><h1>Curtis archive at the Library of Congress</h1>
<p /><blockquote>
<p>The Prints and Photographs Division Curtis collection consists of more than 2,400 silver-gelatin, first generation photographic prints &#8212; some of which are sepia-toned &#8212; made from Curtis&#39;s original glass negatives. Most of the photographic prints are 5&#34; x 7&#34; although nearly 100 are 11&#34; x 14&#34; and larger; many include the Curtis file or negative number within the image at the lower left-hand corner.

Acquired by the <a href="/wiki/Library_of_Congress" id="w">Library of Congress</a> through copyright deposit from about 1900 through 1930, the dates on the images reflect date of registration, not when the photograph was actually taken. About two-thirds (1,608) of these images were not published in the North American Indian volumes and therefore offer a different and unique glimpse into Curtis&#39;s work with indigenous cultures. The original glass plate negatives which had been stored and nearly forgotten in the basement of New York&#39;s <a href="/wiki/The_Morgan_Library_%26amp%3B_Museum" id="w">Pierpont Morgan Library</a> were dispersed during World War II. Many others were destroyed and some were sold as junk.<sup id="_ref-loc_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-loc" title="">[3]</a></sup>

<p>Around 1970, Karl Kernberger of <a href="/wiki/Santa_Fe%2C_New_Mexico" id="w">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a> went to Boston to search for Curtis&#39; original copper plates and <a href="/wiki/Photogravure" id="w">photogravures</a> at the Charles E. Lauriat rare bookstore. He discovered almost 285,000 original photogravures as well as all the original copper plates. With Jack Loeffler; and David Podwa, they jointly purchased all of the surviving Curtis material that was owned by Charles Emelius Lauriat (1874-1937). The collection was later purchased by another group of investors led by Mark Zaplin of Santa Fe. The Zaplin Group owned the plates until 1982, when they sold them to a California group led by Kenneth Zerbe, the current owner of the plates as of 2005. </p>

<p>Dr. <a href="/wiki/Charles_Goddard_Weld" id="w">Charles Goddard Weld</a> purchased 110 prints that Curtis had made for his 1905-1906 exhibit and donated them to the <a href="/wiki/Peabody_Essex_Museum" id="w">Peabody Essex Museum</a>, where they remain.  The 14&#34; by 17&#34; prints are each unique and remain in pristine condition.  Clark Worswick, curator of photography for the museum, describes them as:
</p><blockquote>
<p>&#34;...Curtis&#39; most carefully selected prints of what was then his life’s work...certainly these are some of the most glorious prints ever made in the history of the photographic medium. The fact that we have this man’s entire show of 1906 is one of the minor miracles of photography and museology.&#34; <sup id="_ref-pem_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pem" title="">[7]</a></sup>

<a id="Controversy" name="Controversy"></a><h1>Controversy</h1>
<p>Curtis has been praised as a gifted photographer but also criticized for manipulating his images by professional ethnologists. Curtis&#39; photographs have been charged with misrepresenting Native American people and cultures by portraying them in the popular notions and stereotypes of the times. Although the early twentieth century was difficult time for most Native communities in America, not all natives were doomed to becoming a &#34;vanishing race.&#34;<sup id="_ref-vanish_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vanish" title="">[8]</a></sup> At a time when natives&#39; rights were being denied and their treaties were unrecognized by the federal government, many natives were successfully adapting to western society. By reinforcing the native identity as the <a href="/wiki/Noble_savage" id="w">noble savage</a> and a tragic vanishing race, Curtis detracted attention from the true plight of American natives at the time when he was witnessing their squalid conditions on reservations first-hand and their attempt to find their place in Western culture and adapt to their changing world.<sup id="_ref-vanish_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vanish" title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In many of his images Curtis removed parasols, suspenders, wagons, and other traces of Western and material culture from his pictures. In his photogravure <a class="externallink" href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/curt:@field(DOCID+@lit(cp06005))" rel="nofollow" title="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/curt:@field(DOCID+@lit(cp06005))">&#39;&#39;In a Piegan Lodge&#39;&#39;</a>, published in <i>The North American Indian</i>, Curtis retouched the image to remove a clock between the two men seated on the ground.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>He also is known to have paid natives to pose in staged scenes, wear historically inaccurate dress and costumes, dance and partake in simulated ceremonies.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> In Curtis&#39; picture <a class="externallink" href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/curt:@field(DOCID+@lit(cp03002))" rel="nofollow" title="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/curt:@field(DOCID+@lit(cp03002))">&#39;&#39;Oglala War-Party&#39;&#39;</a>, the image shows 10 Oglala men wearing feather headdresses, on horseback riding down hill. The photo caption reads, &#34;a group of Sioux warriors as they appeared in the days of inter tribal warfare, carefully making their way down a hillside in the vicinity of the enemy&#39;s camp.&#34; In truth headdresses would have only been worn during special occasions and, in some tribes, only by the chief of the tribe. The photograph was taken in 1907 when natives had been relegated onto reservations and warring between tribes had ended. Curtis paid natives to pose as warriors at a time when they lived with little dignity, rights, and freedoms. He altered and manipulated his pictures to create an ethnographic simulation of Native tribes untouched by Western society.</p>
