<p><b><i>The Giver</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/Soft_science_fiction" id="w">soft science fiction</a> <a href="/wiki/Novel" id="w">novel</a> written by <a href="/wiki/Lois_Lowry" id="w">Lois Lowry</a> and published on <a href="/wiki/April_16" id="w">April 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1993" id="w">1993</a>. It is set in a future society which is at first presented as a <a href="/wiki/Utopia" id="w">utopia</a> and gradually appears more and more <a href="/wiki/Dystopia" id="w">dystopic</a>; therefore, it could be considered <i><a href="/wiki/Anti-utopia" id="w">anti-utopian</a></i>. The novel follows a boy named Jonas through the twelfth year of his life. Jonas&#39; society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to &#34;Sameness&#34;, a plan which has also eradicated <a href="/wiki/Emotion" id="w">emotional</a> depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of &#34;Receiver of Memory,&#34; the person who stores all the memories of the time before Sameness, in case they are ever needed to aid in decisions that others lack the experience to make. As Jonas receives the memories from his predecessor—-the &#34;Giver&#34;-—he discovers how shallow his community&#39;s life has become.</p>
<p>Despite controversy and criticism that the book&#39;s subject material is inappropriate for young children, <i>The Giver</i> won the 1994 <a href="/wiki/Newbery_Medal" id="w">Newbery Medal</a> and has sold more than 5.3 million copies. In the <a href="/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States" id="w">United States</a> and Canada it is a part of many <a href="/wiki/Middle_school" id="w">middle school</a> reading lists, but it is also on many banned book lists. The novel forms a loose trilogy with <i><a href="/wiki/Gathering_Blue" id="w">Gathering Blue</a></i> (2000) and <i><a href="/wiki/Messenger_(novel)" id="w">Messenger</a></i> (2004), two other books set in the same future era.</p>
<a id="Plot_summary" name="Plot_summary"></a><h2> Plot summary </h2>


<p>At first glance, the novel&#39;s setting seems to be a <a href="/wiki/Utopia" id="w">utopia</a>, where all possible steps are taken to eliminate <a href="/wiki/Pain" id="w">pain</a> and anguish. The people are almost always compliant; families share their dreams and feelings on a daily basis to defuse emotional buildup. This society remains harmonious by matching up husbands and wives based on compatibility of personality. There is also a subtle theme of <a href="/wiki/Technology" id="w">technology</a> having only a minimal role in <a href="/wiki/Society" id="w">society</a>; throughout the book, it is taken for granted that Jonas&#39;s community is without such technologies as <a href="/wiki/Television" id="w">television</a>, <a href="/wiki/Computer" id="w">computers</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Radio" id="w">radio</a>. Transportation is mostly limited to bikes; however, cars and <a href="/wiki/Airplane" id="w">airplanes</a> exist in small numbers.  </p>
<p>Lowry describes creating the pain-free world of <a href="/wiki/Jonas_(The_Giver)" id="w">Jonas&#39;</a> Community in her <a href="/wiki/Newbery_Medal" id="w">Newbery Award</a> speech:	 
</p><blockquote>
<p>I tried to make Jonas&#39;s world seem familiar, comfortable, and safe, and I tried to <a href="/wiki/Seduce" id="w">seduce</a> the reader. I seduced myself along the way. It did feel good, that world. I got rid of all the things I <a href="/wiki/Fear" id="w">fear</a> and dislike; all the <a href="/wiki/Violence" id="w">violence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poverty" id="w">poverty</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prejudice" id="w">prejudice</a> and <a href="/wiki/Injustice" id="w">injustice</a>, and I even threw in good manners as a way of life because I liked the idea of it.<br/>One child has pointed out, in a letter, that the people in Jonas&#39;s world didn&#39;t even have to do dishes.<br/>It was very, very tempting to leave it at that.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>  
</p></blockquote>

<p>As <a href="/wiki/Time" id="w">time</a> progresses in the novel, however, it becomes clear that the society has lost contact with the ideas of <a href="/wiki/Family" id="w">family</a> and <a href="/wiki/Love" id="w">love</a>, at least in the &#34;more complete&#34; sense at which Lowry hints. Children are born to designated &#34;Birthmothers&#34; and then family units can apply for children. If the family unit applies for the maximum allowed number of two, it will always be one boy and one girl. This is to keep the genders even. After family units have served the purpose of raising the children in a stable environment, they cease to exist, the parents going to a communal housing facility for childless adults, and the children becoming involved in their work and starting monogenerational families of their own, forgetting their foster parents who are growing old. The community maintains this process using pills which suppress <a href="/wiki/Emotion" id="w">emotions</a>, mainly romantic <a href="/wiki/Love" id="w">love</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sexuality" id="w">sexuality</a>, which they refer to as &#34;Stirrings.&#34;</p>
<p>All the land near the Community and around the other, similar communities clustered about the nearby <a href="/wiki/River" id="w">river</a> has been flattened to aid <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" id="w">agriculture</a> and <a href="/wiki/Transportation" id="w">transportation</a>. A vaguely described system of <a href="/wiki/Climate" id="w">Climate</a> Control is used so that the <a href="/wiki/Weather" id="w">weather</a> remains constant. It is implied that <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" id="w">genetic engineering</a> has been used extensively to manipulate human beings so that they physically conform with Sameness.</p>
<p>The Community is run by a Council of Elders that assigns each <a href="/wiki/12_(number)" id="w">12</a>-<a href="/wiki/Year" id="w">year</a>-old the job he or she will perform for the rest of his or her <a href="/wiki/Life" id="w">life</a>. People are bound by an extensive set of rules touching every aspect of life, which if violated would require a simple but somewhat ceremonious apology. In some cases, violating the rules is &#34;winked at&#34;: older siblings invariably teach their younger brothers and sisters how to ride a <a href="/wiki/Bicycle" id="w">bicycle</a> before the children are officially permitted to learn the skill. If a member of the community has committed serious infractions three times before, he or she may be punished by &#34;release&#34;. &#34;Release&#34; is a thing at which the characters hint throughout the book; eventually, it is revealed to be a system of <a href="/wiki/Euthanasia" id="w">euthanasia</a> through <a href="/wiki/Lethal_injection" id="w">lethal injection</a>, employed not only as punishment, but also to ensure a monotony of means by which <a href="/wiki/Death" id="w">death</a> occurs.</p>
<p>The book is told from a <a href="/wiki/Third_person_limited_omniscient" id="w">third-person limited</a> point of view. The <a href="/wiki/Protagonist" id="w">protagonist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jonas" id="w">Jonas</a>, is followed as he awaits the Ceremony of Twelve. Jonas lives in a standard family unit with his mother (a <a href="/wiki/Judge" id="w">judge</a>) and father (a &#34;Nurturer&#34;). He is selected to be &#34;Receiver of <a href="/wiki/Memory" id="w">Memory</a>&#34;, because of his unusual &#34;Capacity to See-Beyond&#34;, which is an ability to do something unusual, such as <a href="/wiki/Colorblindness" id="w">see color</a>, which all the other people were genetically changed not to see, or hear <a href="/wiki/Music" id="w">music</a> (as in the case of Jonas&#39;s mentor). He trains for the position of Receiver by receiving memories from the aged incumbent, known to the community as &#34;The Receiver&#34;, and to Jonas as &#34;The Giver&#34;, who is burdened by the emotional weight of the memories.  These memories are images from the world as it existed before the time called Sameness, &#34;back and back and back&#34;, things that no one else in Jonas&#39;s world remembers. </p>
<p>Through the Giver, who becomes his teacher and surrogate grandfather, Jonas telepathically receives memories of things eliminated from his world: <a href="/wiki/Violence" id="w">violence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sadness" id="w">sadness</a>, and loss, as well as true <a href="/wiki/Love" id="w">love</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beauty" id="w">beauty</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joy" id="w">joy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adventure" id="w">adventure</a>, <a href="/wiki/Animals" id="w">animals</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Family" id="w">family</a>. Having knowledge of these complex and powerful concepts alienates Jonas from his friends and family, as well as making him more cynical towards his previously sheltered life, as he often discusses with the Giver. Eventually, these revelations prompt Jonas to seek to change the community and return emotion &#38; meaning to the world. He and the Giver plan on doing this by having Jonas leave the community, which would cause all of the memories he was given to be released to the rest of the people, allowing them to feel the powerful emotions that Jonas and the Giver feel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jonas&#39;s family temporarily houses a baby named <a href="/wiki/Gabriel" id="w">Gabriel</a>, because he is unable to sleep throughout the night and disturbs the other babies in the nursery. Jonas learns that unlike the other people in his community, &#34;Gabe&#34; can receive memories from Jonas, which he uses to help calm the baby. Because Gabriel still cannot sleep through the night without crying after the extra year he was given to learn how to sleep soundly, he was now destined to be Released. Desperate, Jonas flees the community with Gabe. At first, the escape seems successful. Soon, however, food runs out and they grow weak. They find a snow covered hill with a sled on top, which Jonas remembers from the first memory he ever Received. He and Gabriel board the sled and go down the hill where they hear singing.</p>
<p>The ending is ambiguous, and Jonas&#39; future and even survival are left unresolved. Their survival is made apparent, however, in <i><a href="/wiki/Messenger_(novel)" id="w">Messenger</a>,</i> a sequel novel written much later. This book is recommended for kids from ages 8 to 14.</p>
<a id="Main_Characters_in_''The_Giver''" name="Main_Characters_in_''The_Giver''"></a><h2>Main Characters in &#39;&#39;The Giver&#39;&#39;</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Jonas</b> – The protagonist, an eleven year-old when the novel opens, is selected to become Receiver of Memory at his Ceremony of Twelve. He has &#39;pale&#39; eyes and often sees a &#39;change in scenery&#39;. His Assignment is the most honored and respected one, and Jonas has the intelligence, integrity and courage needed to become a Receiver. Besides The Giver, he is the only person to see a full, emotional, world. As he begins his training with The Giver and slowly understands the truth about the community, Jonas feels that things must change. Planning together with The Giver, Jonas decides to flee with Gabriel away from the community forever in order to unleash all the memories that have been kept from the citizens for so long.</li>
<li><b>The Giver</b> – The incumbent Receiver of Memory, who stores human experiences from the time before Sameness. The Community&#39;s Elders rely upon his &#34;wisdom&#34; in the event of emergencies; because no one wants the pain that comes with keeping the necessary memories, this &#34;honor&#34; is restricted to one individual. He is frustrated at the Elders for only consulting him during emergencies instead of all of the time, and seems somewhat disgusted by the actions of the community&#39;s people, though he tells Jonas that they &#34;know nothing&#34; and therefore cannot be blamed. His real name is never given in the story.</li>
<li><b>Jonas&#39;s Mother</b> – An intelligent, practical woman who serves her Community as a judge. </li>
<li><b>Jonas&#39;s Father</b> –  A caring man, something of the ideal father figure, who works as a Nurturer for children in their first year of life. Later, Jonas learns that his father is, sometimes, responsible for the Release of defective children. </li>
<li><b>Lily</b> – Jonas&#39;s talkative, curious, enthusiastic and outgoing younger sister who likes to take care of Gabriel. She is also very good at story telling and could be picked as the next story teller for the community</li>
<li><b>Asher</b> – Jonas&#39;s best friend. Asher is a fun-loving, hasty boy who usually speaks too fast mixing up his words. He is assigned as an Assistant Director of Recreation.</li>
<li><b>Fiona</b> – Female friend of both Jonas and Asher. Her <a href="/wiki/Red_hair" id="w">red hair</a> represents a failure of genetic engineering, as the Giver notes: &#34;We never completely mastered Sameness. The genetic scientists are still... trying to work the kinks out. Hair like Fiona&#39;s must drive them crazy.&#34; She works as a Caretaker for the Old. Despite her kind demeanor, she is learning to Release the elderly without emotion. Jonas&#39;s first &#39;Stirrings&#39;, or sexual feelings, were expressed in his dreams of her. One may wonder if Jonas is still interested in Fiona after he finds out the truth, but the relationship between Jonas and Fiona was never revisited.</li>
<li><b>Gabriel</b> – An infant from the Nurturing Center whom Jonas&#39;s father takes home for extra care. Slow in development and highly emotional, Gabriel is at risk of Release. Jonas takes him on his journey to Elsewhere. Gabriel is able to Receive memories from Jonas. He is also one of the only people other than Jonas, The Giver, and Rosemary to have pale <a href="/wiki/Eye" id="w">eyes</a>. It is implied that the pale eyes are an indicator of the ability to receive memories. </li>
<li><b>Rosemary</b> – The Elders&#39; previous selection to be the new Receiver of Memory, when Jonas was a Two. Her training failed, in a way which impacted the entire Community: defeated by the memories of loss and hurt which the Giver was forced to transfer, she asked for Release. Once she was released, choosing to <a href="/wiki/Lethal_injection" id="w">inject the lethal material</a> into herself by her own choice, the memories transferred to her became part of the public consciousness, akin to <a href="/wiki/Collective_memory" id="w">collective memory</a>. The Giver reveals that Rosemary was his <a href="/wiki/Daughter" id="w">daughter</a>, though some readers believe The Giver uses the term &#34;daughter&#34; <a href="/wiki/Metaphorically" id="w">metaphorically</a>.</li>
<li><b>Caleb</b> – A child who drowned in the river near the town. Because of release, &#34;natural&#34; or accidental death is not known, so this shocks the community. They chant his name all day in a &#34;Ceremony of Loss&#34; until it fades from their memories.</li>
<li><b>Katharine</b> - A Six with pale eyes when Jonas was about thirteen.  She is mentioned by Jonas as a potential replacement for him, but is too young for training, forcing the community to bear the weight of Jonas&#39;s memories.</li>
<li><b>The Chief Elder</b> - The person who is effectively the head of government in the Community. She is elected into her position; not selected.</li>
<li><b>The Elders</b> - The Elders are responsible for all the important decision making in the Community. They are led by the Chief Elder.</li></ul>
<a id="Major_themes" name="Major_themes"></a><h2>Major themes</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Color" id="w">Color</a> represents diversity and a depth of feeling beyond that which the majority of society enjoys. In <i>The Giver,</i> however, objects do not &#34;gain&#34; color through intense emotional experiences on the part of their observers; rather, Jonas learns to see the colors which objects intrinsically possess. Apparently, the transition to Sameness involved removing <a href="/wiki/Color_vision" id="w">color vision</a> from the people, although the Giver implies that <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineers" id="w">genetic engineers</a> also attempted (without total success) to remove the variability in the human population; even <a href="/wiki/Eye_color" id="w">light eyes</a> (which may or may not indicate that the person possessing such eyes is meant to be a Receiver; Jonas appears to think such) and <a href="/wiki/Red_hair" id="w">red hair</a> are rarities.</p>
<p>A motif of <a href="/wiki/Nudity" id="w">nudity</a> recurs in several places. During his volunteer hours (a time when children aged Eight to Twelve explore their Community and prepare for an eventual career), Jonas assists in the House of the Old, where the most aged members of the Community reside. Lowry describes how Jonas bathes an old woman, Larissa; he enjoys the trusting, carefree nature of the experience, which reminds him of his father caring for an infant. Jonas muses about how his Community has strict rules against nakedness in almost all circumstances. He personally finds them a nuisance, such as the admonition to keep oneself entirely covered while changing for athletic games, and does not understand why the Community would institute such precautions. Later, the tenderness of the bathing scene gains a sexual edge, when Jonas dreams about cajoling a female friend, the red-haired Fiona, to remove her clothes and climb into a tub so that he can bathe her. Jonas recounts this dream at his family&#39;s breakfast dream-telling, and his parents recognize it as an early sign of what they call &#34;The Stirrings&#34; which in this book is the name given to sexual feelings. Special pills are taken to remove any such feelings, so a person is not upset with their choice of a spouse, which is chosen for them by The Elders.</p>
<p>Music plays a role in <i>The Giver,</i> despite its presence being very subdued. Just as it is possible to read well into the novel without realizing that its characters do not <a href="/wiki/Color_vision" id="w">see color</a> — often until the Giver mentions to Jonas that a thing called &#34;color&#34; once existed — it is also easy to miss the fact that the Community has no music. One of the few clues is when Larissa describes a Ceremony of Release for an old man who was leaving the Community. &#34;We chanted the <a href="/wiki/Anthem" id="w">anthem</a>,&#34; she says, a phrasing which implies an absence of melody. Later, when the Giver is instructing Jonas, it is learned that as a boy, the Giver had a faculty much like Jonas&#39;s ability to &#34;See Beyond&#34;. In the Giver&#39;s case, it was <i>Hearing Beyond</i>: he began to hear &#34;something truly remarkable, which is called <i>music</i>&#34;. This sense is more mystical than Jonas&#39;s, in that it can be understood how objects have color which people are unable to see, but it cannot identify a natural source of music, unless the Giver discovered he could hear musical patterns in everyday <a href="/wiki/Sound" id="w">sound</a>, as <a href="/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" id="w">Mozart</a> reputedly did.</p>
<p>Another important theme in <i>The Giver</i> is the selection of a citizens&#39; career based on what they are most naturally suited for. This aspect of the novel could be inspired by the <a href="/wiki/Plato" id="w">Platonic</a> ideal espoused in <a href="/wiki/The_Republic" id="w">The Republic</a>.{{Or}}</p>
<a id="Literary_significance_and_criticism" name="Literary_significance_and_criticism"></a><h2>Literary significance and criticism</h2>
<p>The critical reception of Lowry&#39;s work has been polarized.  On the one hand, one finds critics like <a href="/wiki/Anita_Silvey" id="w">Anita Silvey</a>, whose <i>100 Best Books for Children</i> calls <i>The Giver</i> one of the 1990s&#39; greatest <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a> novels for children and young adults.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  A review in the <i><a href="/wiki/Christian_Science_Monitor" id="w">Christian Science Monitor</a></i> says, &#34;Lowry&#39;s powerful book, simply and directly written, offers an inspiring defense of freedom. Both adventurous and skillfully plotted, this book is recommended for young readers 8 and up.&#34;<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>The Giver</i> has become something of a <a href="/wiki/Canonical" id="w">canonical</a> work among educators who believe that young adult audiences respond best to contemporary literature. These teachers postulate that &#34;teenagers need a separate body of literature written to speak directly to the adolescent experience [...] and plots that revolve around realistic, contemporary topics&#34;. (Of course, Lowry&#39;s futuristic setting means that this <i>particular</i> young adult book can only address &#34;contemporary topics&#34; in an <a href="/wiki/Allegory" id="w">allegorical</a> fashion, a point which raises questions of its own.) In this view, a &#34;classics-only&#34; curriculum can stunt a developing reader&#39;s appetite for words; there are naturally teachers who argue the opposite side of the argument, and press to keep older works on the reading lists.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lowry&#39;s most celebrated and controversial novel has also found a home in &#34;City Reads&#34; programs, library-sponsored reading clubs on city-wide or larger scales. <a href="/wiki/Waukesha_County%2C_Wisconsin" id="w">Waukesha County, Wisconsin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Milwaukee_County%2C_Wisconsin" id="w">Milwaukee County, Wisconsin</a> chose to read <i>The Giver,</i> for example, as did <a href="/wiki/Middletown%2C_Connecticut" id="w">Middletown, Connecticut</a>; <a href="/wiki/Bloomington%2C_Illinois" id="w">Bloomington, Illinois</a>; <a href="/wiki/Valparaiso%2C_Indiana" id="w">Valparaiso, Indiana</a>; <a href="/wiki/Rochester%2C_Minnesota" id="w">Rochester, Minnesota</a>; <a href="/wiki/Central_Valley%2C_New_York" id="w">Central Valley, New York</a>; <a href="/wiki/Centre_County%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Centre County, Pennsylvania</a>; <a href="/wiki/Montgomery_County%2C_Maryland" id="w">Montgomery County, Maryland</a> and others.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some adult reviewers writing for adults have commented that the story is not likely to stand up to the sort of probing literary criticism used in &#34;serious&#34; circles. For instance, 50 children are born each year by the group of &#34;birthmothers&#34; who each have 3 children — therefore 17 new &#34;birthmothers&#34; are required each year, even though this profession is looked down upon in the book. Karen Ray, writing in the <i>New York Times,</i> detects &#34;occasional logical lapses&#34;, but quickly adds that the book &#34;is sure to keep older children reading. And thinking&#34;.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>  In a similar vein, Natalie Babbitt of the <i>Washington Post</i> calls Lowry&#39;s work &#34;a warning in narrative form&#34;, saying:</p>
<p /><blockquote>
<p>The story has been told before in a variety of forms—<a href="/wiki/Ray_Bradbury" id="w">Ray Bradbury</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit_451" id="w">Fahrenheit 451</a></i> comes to mind—but not, to my knowledge, for children. It&#39;s well worth telling, especially by a writer of Lowry&#39;s great skill. If it is exceedingly fragile—if, in other words, some situations don&#39;t survive that well-known <a href="/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief" id="w">suspension of disbelief</a>—well, so be it. <i>The Giver</i> has things to say that can&#39;t be said too often, and I hope there will be many, many young people who will be willing to listen.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Another recurrent theme was the very fragile balance between utopia and dystopia. At the beginning of the book Jonas has entire trust in his community. But then a change provoked by his new-come knowledge made him see how very deprived the Community and its members were of all &#34;real&#34; life. Throughout the book the reader is led to wondering whether an actual utopia exists. {{Fact}}</p>

<p>For a decade after <i>The Giver</i> was published, readers debated the meaning of its ambiguous conclusion, with little more information than Lowry&#39;s elusive statements in select interviews.</p>
<p>After several years of this uncertainty, Lowry revealed the next episode in the characters&#39; lives in her <a href="/wiki/Novel" id="w">novel</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Messenger_(novel)" id="w">Messenger</a></i> (2004), set seven years after <i>The Giver</i> concludes. Only Gabriel is mentioned by name, but the young man known as &#34;Leader&#34; is clearly Jonas; he possesses both the ability to see beyond and eyes of a startling, deep <a href="/wiki/Blue" id="w">blue</a>. Alert readers may also notice what was possibly a reference to Jonas in the final pages of <i><a href="/wiki/Gathering_Blue" id="w">Gathering Blue</a></i> (2000). However, this link was tenuous and uncertain until <i>Messenger</i> made it explicit.</p>
<p><i>The Giver</i> also influenced <a href="/wiki/Rodman_Philbrick" id="w">Rodman Philbrick</a>, who cited <i>The Giver</i> as inspiration for his novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Last_Book_in_the_Universe" id="w">The Last Book in the Universe</a></i> (2000).</p>
<a id="Adaptations" name="Adaptations"></a><h2>Adaptations</h2>
<p>Oregon Children&#39;s Theatre (Portland, Oregon) premiered a stage adaptation of &#34;The Giver&#34; by <a href="/wiki/Eric_Coble" id="w">Eric Coble</a> in March 2006 to critical acclaim <a class="externallink" href="http://www.wweek.com/calendar/3218/performance/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.wweek.com/calendar/3218/performance/">http://www.wweek.com/calendar/3218/performance/</a>.

<p>In the fall of 1994, actor <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Bridges" id="w">Jeff Bridges</a> and his ASIS Productions film company established an agreement with Lancit Media Productions to adapt <i>The Giver</i> to film. In the years following, members of the partnership changed and the production team grew in size, but little motion was seen toward making the film. At one point, screenwriter Ed Neumeier was signed to create the screenplay. Later, Neumeier was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Todd_Alcott" id="w">Todd Alcott</a><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Walden_Media" id="w">Walden Media</a> became the central production company.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
