<p>After the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Ottoman Empire</a> under <a href="/wiki/Mehmet_II" id="w">Sultan Mehmet II</a> <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople" id="w">took Constantinople</a> in May <a href="/wiki/1453" id="w">1453</a>, Mani remained under the control of the Despotate of Morea. In May <a href="/wiki/1460" id="w">1460</a>, Mehmet occupied the Peloponnese. The Despotate of Morea had been ruled by the two brothers of <a href="/wiki/Constantine_XI" id="w">Constantine XI</a>, who had died defending Constantinople. However, neither <a href="/wiki/Demetrios_Palaiologos" id="w">Demetrios Palaiologos</a> nor <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Palaiologos" id="w">Thomas Palaiologos</a> chose to follow his example and defend the Peloponnese. Instead, Thomas fled to <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>, while Demetrios sought refuge with Mehmet. <a href="/wiki/Helena_Palaiologina" id="w">Helena Palaiologina</a>, a daughter of Demetrios and Theodora Asanina, was given in marriage to Mehmet II.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24" title="">[23]</a></sup> </p>	
<p>Kladas, a Greek from Laconia, was granted lordship by Mehmet over <a href="/wiki/Elos" id="w">Elos</a> and Varvounia in <a href="/wiki/1461" id="w">1461</a>. Mehmet hoped that Kladas would defend Laconia from the Maniots.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24" title="">[23]</a></sup> During that time, Mani&#39;s population grew as a result of an influx of refugees who came from other areas of Greece.<sup id="_ref-Kassis38_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis38" title="">[24]</a></sup>{{hcref}} In <a href="/wiki/1463" id="w">1463</a>, Kladas turned against the Ottomans and joined the Venetians. He led the Maniots against the Ottomans with Venetian aid until <a href="/wiki/1479" id="w">1479</a>, when the Venetians made peace with the Ottomans and gave the Ottomans the right to rule <i>Brazzo di Maina</i>. Kladas refused to accept the conditions, and so the Venetians put a price on his head.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the end of the Turco-Venetian War, the Venetians left the Maniots to fend for themselves. Many of the Greeks who had revolted alongside the Venetians were massacred by the Ottomans, but many of them fled to find refuge in Mani. The Maniots continued to resist, and Mehmet sent an army of 2,000 infantry and 300 cavalry against Mani under the command of Ale Boumico.<sup id="_ref-Kassis28_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis28" title="">[25]</a></sup> The Venetians, trying to gain favor with the Porte, handed over some Maniot rebels. The Ottomans reached Oitylo before Kladas, and the Maniots attacked and massacred them. Only a few escaped; amongst them was Ale Boumico. Kladas invaded the Laconian plain with 14,000 Maniots and killed the Turkish inhabitants.<sup id="_ref-Kassis29_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis29" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>A month later, a larger force under the command of <a href="/wiki/Ahmed_Bey" id="w">Ahmed Bey</a> invaded Mani and drove Kladas to <a href="/wiki/Porto_Kagio" id="w">Porto Kagio</a>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>

<p>From <a href="/wiki/1500" id="w">1500</a> to <a href="/wiki/1570" id="w">1570</a>, Mani kept its autonomy without any invasion from the Ottomans.<sup id="_ref-Kassis29_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis29" title="">[26]</a></sup> The Ottomans were busy driving the Venetians out of the Peloponnese and succeeded in <a href="/wiki/1540" id="w">1540</a>, when they conquered Monemvasia and <a href="/wiki/Nafplio" id="w">Nafplio</a>. The Ottomans under <a href="/wiki/Selim_II" id="w">Selim II</a>, preparing to invade the Venetian island of <a href="/wiki/Cyprus" id="w">Cyprus</a>, built a fortress in Mani, at Porto Kagio, and they also garrisoned Passavas. The aim of this was to cut off the Venetians&#39; communication lines and to keep the Maniots at bay. Alarmed, the Maniots called upon Venetian assistance, and the Venetian navy in combination with the Maniot army captured the castle.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos25_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos25" title="">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Cyprus fell later that year, but the combined fleets of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_League_(Mediterranean)" id="w">Holy League</a> defeated the Ottoman fleet at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Lepanto" id="w">Battle of Lepanto</a> (<a href="/wiki/1571" id="w">1571</a>). The Greeks assumed that <a href="/wiki/John_of_Austria" id="w">John of Austria</a> would champion their revolt under the command of the bishop of Monemvasia.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos25_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos25" title="">[31]</a></sup> The promised army never arrived, and by <a href="/wiki/1572" id="w">1572</a> the bishop was forced to retreat to Mani. The Maniots failed when they appealed to <a href="/wiki/Pope_Gregory_VIII" id="w">Pope Gregory VIII</a> to convince <a href="/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain" id="w">Philip II of Spain</a> in providing military support.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<a id="17th_century" name="17th_century"></a><h2>17th century</h2>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/1603" id="w">1603</a>, the Maniots approached <a href="/wiki/Pope_Clement_VIII" id="w">Pope Clement VIII</a>, who had recently taken up the <a href="/wiki/Crusade" id="w">cross</a>. Clement died two years later, and the Maniots began to seek a new champion, centering their attention on the King of Spain, <a href="/wiki/Philip_III_of_Spain" id="w">Philip III</a>.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26" title="">[32]</a></sup> They urged him to land his army at Porto Kagio and promised to join him with 15,000 armed men as well as 80,000 other Peloponnesians.<sup id="_ref-Kassis29_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis29" title="">[26]</a></sup> The Maniots also sent envoys to some major powers of the Mediterranean, as for example the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Venice" id="w">Republic of Venice</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Ancien_R%C3%A9gime_in_France" id="w">Kingdom of France</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Genoa" id="w">Republic of Genoa</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Tuscany" id="w">Grand Duchy of Tuscany</a>, and once again <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a>. These states were interested and sent several expeditionary forces to Mani, but with the exception of a Spanish expedition that sacked Passavas they all failed to achieve anything.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Maniots found a champion in <a href="/wiki/1612" id="w">1612</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Gonzaga" id="w">Charles Gonzaga</a>, Duke of Mantua and Nevers. Charles was a descendant of the Byzantine Emperor <a href="/wiki/Andronicus_II_Palaeologus" id="w">Andronicus II Palaeologus</a> through his grandmother, who was of the line of <a href="/wiki/Theodore_I_of_Montferrat" id="w">Theodore I of Montferrat</a>, Andronicus&#39; son.<sup id="_ref-Kassis30_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis30" title="">[33]</a></sup> Through this connection he claimed the throne of Constantinople. He began plotting with the Maniots, who addressed him as <i>King Constantine Palaeologus</i>. When the Porte heard about this, they sent Arslan in command of an army of 20,000 men and 70 ships to invade Mani. He succeeded in ravaging Mani and imposing taxes on the Maniots (which they did not pay). This caused Nevers to move more actively for his crusade. Nevers sent envoys to the courts of Europe looking for support. In <a href="/wiki/1619" id="w">1619</a>, he recruited six ships and a number men, but he was forced to abort the mission because of the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Thirty_Years%26%2339%3B_War" id="w">Thirty Years&#39; War</a>.<sup id="_ref-Kassis30_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis30" title="">[33]</a></sup>The idea of the crusade faded and Nevers died in 1637.<sup id="_ref-Kassis30_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis30" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1645" id="w">1645</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Turkish-Venetian_War" id="w">Turkish-Venetian War</a> or &#34;Cretan War&#34; began. The Republic of Venice was attempting to defend <a href="/wiki/Crete" id="w">Crete</a>, one of their provinces since 1204, from an attempt to expand the Ottoman Empire, initially under <a href="/wiki/Ibrahim_I" id="w">Ibrahim I</a>. The Maniots supported the Venetians by offering them ships. In <a href="/wiki/1659" id="w">1659</a>, Admiral <a href="/wiki/Francesco_Morosini" id="w">Francesco Morosini</a>, with 13,000 Maniots as his allies, occupied <a href="/wiki/Kalamata" id="w">Kalamata</a>, a large city near Mani. In 1667, during the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Candia" id="w">Siege of Candia</a>, some Maniot pirate ships sneaked into the Ottoman fleet and managed to loot and burn some ships. However, Candia fell in 1669, and Crete became part of the Ottoman Empire.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26" title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Kassis30_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis30" title="">[33]</a></sup>{{hcref}}</p>
<p>With Crete captured, the Ottomans turned their attention to Mani. The <a href="/wiki/Grand_Vizier" id="w">Grand Vizier</a>, <a href="/wiki/K%C3%B6pr%C3%BCl%C3%BC_Faz%C4%B1l_Ahmet_Pasha" id="w">Köprülü Fazıl Ahmet Pasha</a>, sent the pirate <a href="/wiki/Hasan_Baba" id="w">Hasan Baba</a> to subdue Mani. Baba arrived in Mani demanding that the Maniots surrender hostages, but instead he was answered with bullets. During the night, ten Maniots went and cut the hawsers of Hasan&#39;s ships. This caused some of Baba&#39;s ships to founder on some rocks, and the Maniots, taking advantage of the situation, attacked and killed the Turks and seized the ships. Baba managed to escape with only one ship.<sup id="_ref-Kassis30-1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis30-1" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the prisons of <a href="/wiki/Bagno" id="w">Bagno</a>, there was a notorious twenty-five-year-old Maniot pirate named <a href="/wiki/Liberakis_Gerakis" id="w">Liberakis Gerakis</a>. At the age of fifteen, he was in the Venetian galleys as a rower. After being released by the Venetians, he continued piracy and was captured by the Turks in <a href="/wiki/1667" id="w">1667</a>. The Grand Vizier decided to give him amnesty if he cooperated with the Turks and helped them conquer Mani. Gerakis agreed and in <a href="/wiki/1670" id="w">1670</a> became the bey of Mani. One of Gerakis&#39; first acts was to exile his clan&#39;s enemies, the Iatriani family and the Stephanopoulos family from Oitylo. The Iatriani fled in <a href="/wiki/1670" id="w">1670</a> and settled in <a href="/wiki/Livorno" id="w">Livorno</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tuscany" id="w">Tuscany</a>. The Stephanopoulos clan was forced to leave Oitylo in <a href="/wiki/1676" id="w">1676</a>, and after having gained permission from the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Genoa" id="w">Republic of Genoa</a>, went to <a href="/wiki/Corsica" id="w">Corsica</a>.

<p>Liberakis soon fell out of favor with the Turks since he joined his fellow Maniots in piracy and was captured in <a href="/wiki/1682" id="w">1682</a>.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos27_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos27" title="">[36]</a></sup> With Ottoman forces preoccupied with the Austrians, the Venetians under Morosini saw their opportunity to take over Turkish-held territories in the Peloponnese. The Turkish general in the Peloponnese, <a href="/wiki/Ismael" id="w">Ismael</a>, discovered this plan and attacked Mani with 10,000 men. The Turks ravaged the plains, but during the night the Maniots attacked and killed 1,800 Turks. The other Turks retreated to the castles of Kelefa and Zarnatas, where they were besieged by the Maniots. After brief sieges, the Maniots managed to capture both <a href="/wiki/Koroni" id="w">Koroni</a> and Kelefa. However, Ismael returned with 10,000 infantry and 2,500 artillery and started besieging the Maniots at Kelefa. The Turks nearly succeeded in breaching the walls before 4,500 Venetians under the command of Morosini arrived and forced the Turks to retreat to <a href="/wiki/Kastania" id="w">Kastania</a> with the Maniots in pursuit.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos28_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos28" title="">[37]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Kassis32_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis32" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Venetians, with assistance of the Greeks, conquered the rest of the <a href="/wiki/Peloponnese" id="w">Peloponnese</a> and then besieged <a href="/wiki/Athens" id="w">Athens</a>.

Liberakis immediately launched several raids into Venetian-held territories of the Peloponnese. However, when the Ottomans attempted to poison Liberakis, he defected to the Venetian side.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos29_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos29" title="">[39]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Kassis33_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis33" title="">[40]</a></sup> The Venetians made Liberakis a Knight of St. Mark and recognized him as ruler of <a href="/wiki/Roumeli" id="w">Roumeli</a>.

By this time, the main Maniot army of 5,000 men and 2,000 women had established a defensive position at Trikefalia, which was on mountainous terrain above the town of <a href="/wiki/Parasyros" id="w">Parasyros</a>.

The Maniots knew that if they sent envoys to the Turks, they would be executed by Hassán if the negotiations failed. The Maniots sent six men to discuss the terms.<sup id="_ref-Kassis35_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis35" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Six Maniot envoys were sent to Hassán and, without bowing, asked him what he wanted. Hassán&#39;s demands entailed the children of ten captains as hostages, all Maniot-held arms, and an annual head-tax to be paid  as punishment for supporting the Russians. The Maniots answered Hassán&#39;s demands saying, <i>We prefer to die rather than give to you our guns and children. We don&#39;t pay taxes, because our land is poor.</i> Hassán became furious and had the six men decapitated and impaled on stakes so that the Maniots could see them.<sup id="_ref-Kassis36_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis36" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

The Egyptians, not expecting any resistance, were caught by surprise at this sudden attack and were forced to retreat to a fortified position on the beach where they could receive support from their ships. Eventually, 300 Maniots arrived from other towns, and the Egyptians were forced to either swim to their ships or be slain.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62" title="">[61]</a></sup> Not only was Ibrahim&#39;s defeat costly, as he lost 1,000 men, but his plan to invade and conquer Mani was utterly ruined.

<p>Ibrahim, annoyed by his defeats at Vergas and Diro, plundered the Peloponnese for a month before turning his attention back to Mani.

As he advanced towards Polytsaravo, he was stopped by Theodoros Stathakos, who together with his family of thirteen people was waiting in their tower.

He noticed that Konstantinos and Georgios were waiting at the church doors. As he passed them, he briefly stopped before proceeding into the church. As he was about to step into the church, Konstantinos fired his gun and the bullet hit Capodistrias at the back of the head while at the same time Georgios stabbed him through the heart. Capodistrias collapsed into the arms of his attendants. Capodistrias&#39; bodyguard shot Konstantinos as he was running, and Konstantinos was hit by several more bullets before he died.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/1833" id="w">1833</a>, <a href="/wiki/Otto_of_Greece" id="w">Otto von Wittelsbach</a>, a son of <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_I_of_Bavaria" id="w">Ludwig I of Bavaria</a> and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, became <a href="/wiki/King_of_Greece" id="w">King of Greece</a> after he was appointed by the <a href="/wiki/Great_Powers" id="w">Great Powers</a>. Since he was underage, he had a Council of Regency headed by <a href="/wiki/Josef_Ludwig_von_Armansperg" id="w">Josef Ludwig von Armansperg</a> governing the country for him.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos58_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos58" title="">[54]</a></sup> One of the Council&#39;s first acts was to try to subdue the unruly Maniots and pull down their towers; another was to free Petros and Tzanis from their prisons.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos35_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos35" title="">[68]</a></sup> The council sent an army of <a href="/wiki/Bavarians" id="w">Bavarians</a> in order to tame Messa Mani.<sup id="_ref-Kassis43_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis43" title="">[69]</a></sup> They made it to Areopolis, but during the night the Maniots surrounded and captured them, forcing them to leave the area.<sup id="_ref-Kassis44_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis44" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_14" id="w">May 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1834" id="w">1834</a>, four companies of Bavarian troops, assisted by four cannon, laid siege to the town of <a href="/wiki/Petrovouni" id="w">Petrovouni</a>. Ultimately, 800 Maniots from the surrounding towns attacked the Bavarians. The Bavarians were massacred as most of them were either slain by the Maniots or fell into a ravine near the town while escaping. Later that year, an army of 6,000 men with five cannon under the command of General <a href="/wiki/Schmaltz" id="w">Schmaltz</a>, assisted by five squadrons of royalist Maniots, once again besieged Petrovouni. When news of an army of 1,000 Maniots was approaching, they retreated to Gytheio.<sup id="_ref-Kassis44_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis44" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Council decided that they could not subdue the Maniots by force, so they decided to send a diplomat, <a href="/wiki/Max_Feder" id="w">Max Feder</a>, with the intention of subduing Mani. He went to different Maniot families and offered them positions if they supported the king. Many of the Achamnomeri (see note α below) and some Megalogenites were convinced by his offers and complied. However, several of the older families and the poorer Achamnomeri rejected the offer, because the former did not want to be dependent on a king and the latter did not want governors with superior rights. In <a href="/wiki/Kitta" id="w">Kitta</a>, this division caused bloodshed when the king&#39;s supporters started fighting the other Maniots under the command of <a href="/wiki/Giorgaros_Skylakakis" id="w">Giorgaros Skylakakis</a>.<sup id="_ref-Kassis44_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis44" title="">[70]</a></sup> Feder soon arrived with his new allies and blew up Skylakakis and all his allies in his towers. Thus was Mani finally subdued.<sup id="_ref-Kassis45_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis45" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Late_19th_century" name="Late_19th_century"></a><h2>Late 19th century</h2>

<p>During Otto&#39;s rule, blood was spilled in Mani because of the <a href="/wiki/Vendettas" id="w">vendettas</a>, which have plagued the area for centuries.<sup id="_ref-Kassis45_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis45" title="">[71]</a></sup> The vendettas continued until <a href="/wiki/1870" id="w">1870</a>, when a Maniot vendetta was halted by the efforts of a regular army with artillery support.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos36_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos36" title="">[72]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/1841" id="w">1841</a>, <a href="/wiki/Crete" id="w">Crete</a> revolted against the Ottomans. The Maniots, described as <i>cousins</i> of the Cretans, rushed to Crete to support them. The Cretans, together with the Maniots, forced the Turks into a fortress, where they besieged them. A combined Ottoman-English fleet managed to subdue the Cretans and make the Maniots go back to Mani. In <a href="/wiki/1866" id="w">1866</a>, a new revolution sparked in Crete, and 2,000 Maniots under the command of <a href="/wiki/Petropoulakis" id="w">Petropoulakis</a> went to assist their cousins. However, the Cretans were defeated, and the Maniots were again forced to retreat to Mani.<sup id="_ref-Kassis45_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis45" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<a id="20th_century" name="20th_century"></a><h2>20th century</h2>

<p>At the start of the <a href="/wiki/20th_century" id="w">20th century</a>, Greece was involved with the <a href="/wiki/Greek_Struggle_for_Macedonia" id="w">Macedonian Struggle</a>, military conflicts against the <a href="/wiki/VMRO" id="w">Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization</a>, and Turkish forces in <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Ottoman</a>-occupied <a href="/wiki/Macedonia_(region)" id="w">Macedonia</a>. Many volunteers from Mani took part in the war. The Maniots also took part in the series of wars that followed including the <a href="/wiki/Balkan_Wars" id="w">Balkan Wars</a>, <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Greco-Turkish_War_(1919-1922)" id="w">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a>. The participation of troops from Mani in these wars under <a href="/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Greece" id="w">Constantine I of Greece</a>, created strong <a href="/wiki/Royalist" id="w">royalist</a> feelings amongst Maniots. That&#39;s why most Maniots stayed loyal to Constantine during the Greek <a href="/wiki/National_Schism" id="w">National Schism</a>.<sup id="_ref-Kassis46_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis46" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, the Maniots significantly contributed to the <a href="/wiki/Hellenic_Army" id="w">Hellenic Army</a>. During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Greece" id="w">Battle of Greece</a>, a Maniot named Colonel <a href="/wiki/Konstantinos_Davakis" id="w">Konstantinos Davakis</a> was among the leaders of the armed forces.<sup id="_ref-Kassis46_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis46" title="">[73]</a></sup> Davakis, in command of the Pindus Detachment, defeated the Italians at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Pindus" id="w">Battle of Pindus</a> (<a href="/wiki/October_28" id="w">October 28</a> - <a href="/wiki/November_13" id="w">November 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a>), despite the Italians having more advanced weaponry.</p>
<p>Later, the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" id="w">Royal Navy</a> of the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> defeated the <a href="/wiki/Regia_Marina" id="w">Regia Marina</a> of Italy in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_Matapan" id="w">Battle of Cape Matapan</a> (<a href="/wiki/March_27" id="w">March 27</a> - <a href="/wiki/March_29" id="w">March 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>) on Cape <a href="/wiki/Tenaro" id="w">Tenaro</a>. However, <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Nazi Germany</a> attacked Greece in order to support the Italians. The Greeks were forced to retreat, and soon Mani revived its forgotten role as a center for refugees. In April 1941, the British started evacuating their troops from Porto Kagio. By the end of that month, Mani and the rest of Greece were under <a href="/wiki/Axis_occupation_of_Greece_during_World_War_II" id="w">Italian and German occupation</a>.<sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos141_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos141" title="">[74]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the occupation, Mani became a stonghold of the German-collaborating <a href="/wiki/Security_Battalions" id="w">Security Battalions</a>, because of the anti-communist sentiment of the Maniots. The Germans and Italians left of Greece in <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>, but as soon as they left the <a href="/wiki/Greek_Civil_War" id="w">Greek Civil War</a> began.

<p>Today, Mani is divided between two prefectures, <a href="/wiki/Laconia" id="w">Laconia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Messenia" id="w">Messenia</a>. Mani has around 18,000 inhabitants, with the most important and populous town being <a href="/wiki/Gytheio" id="w">Gytheio</a>. Mani&#39;s main source of income is tourism. The most famous of the tourist attractions are the <a href="/wiki/Caves_of_Diro" id="w">Caves of Diro</a>, which are two caves that have underwater rivers flowing through them.</p>
<a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h1>Culture</h1>
<p>{{Greek people}}
</p><a id="Dances" name="Dances"></a><h2>Dances</h2>

<p>Two dances come from Mani: Palio Maniatiko (Greek: Old Maniot) and the Modern Maniatiko. The Palio Maniatiko is only found in Mani and is described as an ancient dance.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> The Modern Maniatiko is the modern version of the Palio Maniatiko dance and includes certain aspects of the <a href="/wiki/Kalamatiano" id="w">Kalamatiano</a> dance in it. Like the Palio Maniatiko it is only danced in Mani.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Piracy" name="Piracy"></a><h2>Piracy</h2>

<p>Part of Maniot culture entailed <a href="/wiki/Piracy" id="w">piracy</a>. The Maniots were famous and fearsome pirates whose ships dominated the Maniot coastline. The Maniots became pirates because Mani was not a very fertile land and the Maniots did not have many natural resources. The Maniots considered piracy a legitimate response to the fact that their land was poor, and it became their main source of income.<sup id="_ref-Barrow16_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barrow16" title="">[79]</a></sup> The pirate raids were not stopped by the local priests of the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" id="w">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>, who in fact blessed the ships before they left and sometimes accompanied them on raids. Most of the Maniot pirates came from Messa Mani.<sup id="_ref-Barrow17>Barrow, ''The Mani_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barrow17>Barrow, ''The Mani" title="">[80]</a></sup> The main victims of Maniot pirates were the Ottomans, but the Maniots also targeted ships of powerful European countries.<sup id="_ref-Kassis38_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis38" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Superstition" name="Superstition"></a><h2>Superstition</h2>

<p>The Maniots are a very superstitious people.<sup id="_ref-Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani" title="">[81]</a></sup> Maniots mainly believe in <a href="/wiki/Witchcraft" id="w">witches</a>, <a href="/wiki/Demon" id="w">demons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vampire" id="w">vampires</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ghost" id="w">ghosts</a>.<sup id="_ref-Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani" title="">[81]</a></sup> When <a href="/wiki/Henry_Herbert%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Carnarvon" id="w">Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon</a>, was touring Mani in 1839, he found a fresh egg by the side of the road and offered it to a Maniot soldier who escorted him, who declined the offer claiming that if a <a href="/wiki/Hag" id="w">hag</a> had enchanted it he would have to marry her.<sup id="_ref-Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani" title="">[81]</a></sup> The Maniots thought that certain areas were haunted by demons.<sup id="_ref-Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Barrow18>Barrow, ''The Mani" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Vendettas" name="Vendettas"></a><h2>Vendettas</h2>

<p>Another important aspect of Maniot culture were the <a href="/wiki/Vendetta" id="w">vendettas</a> which frequently plagued Mani. Usually, the decision to start a vendetta was made at a family gathering. The main aim of a vendetta was usually to wipe out the other family.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup> The families involved locked themselves in their towers and whenever they got the chance murdered members of the opposing family.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> The other families in the village normally locked themselves in their towers in order not to get in the way of the fighting.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some vendettas went on for months, sometimes years. In vendettas, the families could have a truce or <i>treva</i>, if one family needed to attend a religious ceremony or when it was time to harvest the crops.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> As soon as the treva ended, the killing could resume. Vendettas usually ended when one family was exterminated or when the defeated family left the town. Sometimes families came to terms, and vendettas stopped when the Turks invaded.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> The longest treva occurred when the Mavromichales declared war on the Turks in 1821. Vendettas continued after the liberation of Greece even though the Regency tried to demolish the towers.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Ethnology" name="Ethnology"></a><h1>Ethnology</h1>

<p>The inhabitants of Mani consider themselves direct descendants of the ancient Spartans. After the Romans took over Laconia, many of the citizens who were loyal to the laws of <a href="/wiki/Lycurgus_(Sparta)" id="w">Lycurgus</a> decided to flee to the mountains of Mani rather than be in Achean or, later, Roman service.<sup id="_ref-Hall, Hellander, Simcock and Willet263_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hall, Hellander, Simcock and Willet263" title="">[88]</a></sup> Even though it seems highly unlikely, Kassis claims that Maniots rarely mated with non-Maniots until the 20th century.<sup id="_ref-Kassis20_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kassis20" title="">[89]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mani became a refuge during the <a href="/wiki/4th_century" id="w">4th century</a> when the <a href="/wiki/Barbarian_invasions" id="w">barbarian invasions</a> started in Europe. When the Avars and Slavs invaded the Peloponnese, many Greek refugees fled to Mani since the invaders could not infiltrate the mountainous terrain. According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, the Maniots were not conquered by the Slavs, <i>Be it known that the inhabitants of Castle Maina are not from the race of aforesaid Slavs but from the older Romaioi, who up to the present time are termed Hellenes.</i><sup id="_ref-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
