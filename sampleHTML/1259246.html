<p>The <b>Battle of Greece</b> (also known as <b>Operation Marita</b>, {{lang-de}})<sup id="_ref-C3-4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-C3-4" title="">[1]</a></sup> was a <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> battle that occurred on the Greek mainland and in southern <a href="/wiki/Albania" id="w">Albania</a>. The battle was fought between the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" id="w">Allied</a> (<a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">British Commonwealth</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Axis_powers_of_World_War_II" id="w">Axis</a> (<a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Nazi Germany</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861-1946)" id="w">Fascist Italy</a>) forces. With the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Crete" id="w">Battle of Crete</a> and several naval actions, the Battle of Greece is considered part of the wider <a href="/wiki/Aegean_Sea" id="w">Aegean</a> component of the <a href="/wiki/Balkans_Campaign" id="w">Balkans Campaign</a> of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>The Battle of Greece is generally regarded as a continuation of the <a href="/wiki/Greco-Italian_War" id="w">Greco-Italian War</a>, which began when Italian troops invaded Greece on <a href="/wiki/October_28" id="w">October 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a>. Within weeks the Italians were driven from Greece and Greek forces pushed on to occupy much of southern <a href="/wiki/Albania" id="w">Albania</a>. In March 1941, a major Italian counterattack failed, and Germany was forced to come to the aid of its ally. Operation Marita began on <a href="/wiki/April_6" id="w">April 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, with German troops invading Greece through <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" id="w">Bulgaria</a> in an effort to secure its southern flank. The combined Greek and British forces fought back with great tenacity, but were vastly outnumbered and outgunned, and finally collapsed. <a href="/wiki/Athens" id="w">Athens</a> fell on <a href="/wiki/April_27" id="w">April 27</a>. However, the British Commonwealth managed to evacuate  about 50,000 troops.{{Cref}} The Greek campaign ended in a quick and complete German victory with the fall of <a href="/wiki/Kalamata" id="w">Kalamata</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Peloponnese" id="w">Peloponnese</a>; it was over within twenty-four days.  Nevertheless, both German and Allied officials have expressed their admiration for the strong resistance of the Greek soldiers.</p>
<p>Some historians regard the German campaign in Greece as decisive in determining the course of World War II, maintaining that it fatally delayed the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)" id="w">Axis invasion of the Soviet Union</a>. Others hold that the campaign had no influence on the launching of <a href="/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa" id="w">Operation Barbarossa</a>, and characterize British intervention in Greece as a hopeless undertaking, a &#34;political and sentimental decision&#34; or even a &#34;a definite strategic blunder.&#34; </p>

<a id="Military_preparations" name="Military_preparations"></a><h2>Military preparations</h2>
<a id="Topography" name="Topography"></a><h3>Topography</h3>
<p>To enter Northern Greece, the German army was compelled to cross the <a href="/wiki/Rhodope_mountains" id="w">Rhodope mountains</a>, which possessed few river valleys or passes capable of accommodating the movement of large military units. Two invasion courses were located west of <a href="/wiki/Kyustendil" id="w">Kyustendil</a>; another was along the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border, via the <a href="/wiki/Strimon" id="w">Strimon</a> valley to the south. Greek border fortifications had been adapted for the terrain, and a formidable defense system covered the few available roads. The Strimon and <a href="/wiki/Nestos_River" id="w">Nestos</a> rivers cut across the mountain range along the Greek-Bulgarian frontier, and both of their valleys were protected by strong fortifications, as part of the larger <a href="/wiki/Metaxas_Line" id="w">Metaxas Line</a>. This system of concrete pillboxes and field fortifications  was constructed along the Bulgarian border in the late 1930s, and was based on principles similar to those applied to the <a href="/wiki/Maginot_Line" id="w">Maginot Line</a>. Its strength resided mainly in the inaccessibility of the intermediate terrain leading up to the defense positions.<sup id="_ref-CB75_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB75" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Strategic_factors" name="Strategic_factors"></a><h3>Strategic factors</h3>
<p>The mountainous terrain of Greece favored a defensive strategy, and the high ranges of the Rhodope, <a href="/wiki/Epirus_(region)" id="w">Epirus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pindus" id="w">Pindus</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mount_Olympus" id="w">Olympus</a> mountains offered many opportunities to stop an invader. However, sufficient air power was required to prevent defending ground forces from becoming trapped in the many defiles. Although an invading force from Albania can be stopped by a relatively small number of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern part of the country was difficult to defend against an attack from the north.<sup id="_ref-CB77_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB77" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following a conference in Athens that March, the British command believed that they would combine with Greek forces to occupy the <a href="/wiki/Haliacmon_Line" id="w">Haliacmon Line</a>&#8212;a short front facing northeastward along the <a href="/wiki/Vermion_Mountains" id="w">Vermion Mountains</a>, and the lower <a href="/wiki/Haliacmon" id="w">Haliacmon</a> river.

The strategically important port of <a href="/wiki/Thessaloniki" id="w">Thessaloniki</a> lay practically indefensible, and transportation of British troops to the city remained dangerous.<sup id="_ref-Mc106-107_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mc106-107" title="">[30]</a></sup> Papagos proposed to take advantage of the area&#39;s difficult terrain and prepare fortifications, while at the same time protecting Thessaloniki.

The British believed that the Greek rivalry with Bulgaria&#8212;the Metaxas line was designed specifically for use in the event of war with Bulgaria&#8212;as well as their traditionally good terms with the Yugoslavs, left their north-western border largely undefended.<sup id="_ref-B37_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-B37" title="">[33]</a></sup> Despite their concerns over the vulnerability of the border system, and their awareness that it was likely to collapse in the event of a German thrust from the Strimon and <a href="/wiki/Axios_River" id="w">Axios</a> rivers, the British eventually conceded to the Greek command. On <a href="/wiki/March_4" id="w">March 4</a>, Dill accepted the plans for the Metaxas line, and on <a href="/wiki/March_7" id="w">March 7</a>, agreement was ratified by the <a href="/wiki/British_Cabinet" id="w">British Cabinet</a>.<sup id="_ref-LM_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LM" title="">[34]</a></sup> The overall command was to be retained by Papagos, and the Greek and British commands resigned themselves to fighting a delaying action in the northeastern part of the country.<sup id="_ref-CB77_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB77" title="">[28]</a></sup> Nevertheless, the British did not move their troops, because General Wilson regarded them as too weak to maintain such a broad front line. Instead, he took a position some forty miles west of the Axios, across the Haliacmon Line.<sup id="_ref-Zi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zi" title="">[35]</a></sup> The two main objectives in establishing this position were to maintain contact with the Greek First Army in Albania, and to deny German access to Central Greece. This had the advantage of requiring a smaller force than other options, while still allowing more time for preparation. However, it meant abandoning nearly the whole of Northern Greece, and was thus unacceptable to the Greeks for both political and psychological reasons. Moreover, the left flank of the line was susceptible to flanking from Germans operating through the <a href="/wiki/Monastir" id="w">Monastir</a> gap in Yugoslavia.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> However, the possibility of a rapid disintegration of the Yugoslav Army, and a German thrust into the rear of the <a href="/wiki/Vermio" id="w">Vermion</a> position, was not taken into consideration.<sup id="_ref-CB77_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB77" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>The German strategy was based on utilization of the <a href="/wiki/Blitzkrieg" id="w">blitzkrieg</a> tactics which had proved successful during the invasions of Western Europe, and confirmed their effectiveness during the <a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_Yugoslavia" id="w">invasion of Yugoslavia</a>.

Once Thessaloniki was captured, Athens and the port of <a href="/wiki/Piraeus" id="w">Piraeus</a> would be the next principal targets. With Piraeus and the <a href="/wiki/Isthmus_of_Corinth" id="w">Isthmus of Corinth</a> in German hands, the withdrawal and evacuation of British and Greek forces would be fatally compromised.<sup id="_ref-CB77_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB77" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Fifth Yugoslav Army was given responsibility for the defense of the southeastern border between <a href="/wiki/Kriva_Palanka" id="w">Kriva Palanka</a> and the Greek border. At the time of the German attack, the Yugoslav troops were not yet fully mobilized, and lacked a sufficient amount of modern equipment or weapons to be fully effective. Following the entry of German forces into Bulgaria, the majority of Greek troops were evacuated from <a href="/wiki/Western_Thrace" id="w">Western Thrace</a>. By this time, the total strength of the Greek forces defending the Bulgarian border totaled roughly 70,000 men, under the command of the Greek Second Army.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_28" id="w">March 28</a>, the Greek forces in Central Macedonia&#8212;the 12th and 20th Infantry Divisions&#8212;were put under the command of General Wilson, who established his headquarters northwest of <a href="/wiki/Larissa" id="w">Larissa</a>. The New Zealand division took a position north of Mount Olympus, while the Australian division blocked the Haliacmon valley up to the Vermion range. The Royal Air Force continued to operate from airfields in Central and Southern Greece; however, few planes could be diverted to the theater. The British forces were near to fully motorized, but their equipment was more suited to desert warfare than to the steep mountain roads of Greece. There was a shortage of tanks and anti-aircraft guns, and the lines of communication across the Mediterranean were vulnerable, because each convoy had to pass close to enemy-held islands in the Aegean; despite the fact that the British Navy dominated the <a href="/wiki/Aegean_Sea" id="w">Aegean Sea</a>. These <a href="/wiki/Logistics" id="w">logistical</a> problems were aggravated by the limited availability of shipping and capacity of the Greek ports.<sup id="_ref-CB79-80_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB79-80" title="">[38]</a></sup> </p>

<a id="German_plan_of_attack_and_assembly" name="German_plan_of_attack_and_assembly"></a><h3>German plan of attack and assembly</h3>
<p>The German plan of attack was informed by their army&#39;s experiences during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_France" id="w">Battle of France</a>. Their strategy was to create a diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the Greek Army of sufficient manpower for the defense of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armored wedges through the weakest links of the defense chain, the ability to penetrate into enemy territory would be more easily achieved, and would not necessitate the maneuver of their armor behind an infantry advance. Once the weak defense system of Southern Yugoslavia were overrun by German armor, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia. Thus possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver.<sup id="_ref-CB82-83_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB82-83" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Yugoslav coup d&#39;etat led to a sudden change in the plan of attack, and confronted the Twelfth Army with a number of difficult problems. According to the March 28 Directive No. 25, the Twelfth Army was to regroup its forces in such a manner that a mobile task force would be available to attack via <a href="/wiki/Ni%C5%A1" id="w">Niš</a> toward <a href="/wiki/Belgrade" id="w">Belgrade</a>. With only nine days left before <a href="/wiki/D-Day" id="w">D-Day</a>, every hour became valuable, and each fresh assembly of troops would need time to mobilize. By the evening of <a href="/wiki/April_5" id="w">April 5</a>, each attack force intended to enter either Southern Yugoslavia or Greece had been assembled.<sup id="_ref-CB83-84_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB83-84" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

The XL Panzer Corps&#8212;which had been intended for use in an attack across southern Yugoslavia&#8212;began their assault at 05:30 a.m., and made thrusts across the Bulgarian frontier at two separate points. By the evening of <a href="/wiki/April_8" id="w">April 8</a>, the <a href="/wiki/1st_SS_Division_Leibstandarte_SS_Adolf_Hitler" id="w">1st SS Division Adolf Hitler</a> captured <a href="/wiki/Prilep" id="w">Prilep</a>, thus severing an important rail line between Belgrade and Thessaloniki, and isolating Yugoslavia from its allies. The Germans were now in possession of terrain which was favorable to the continuation of the offensive. On the evening of <a href="/wiki/April_9" id="w">April 9</a>, General Stumme deployed his forces north of Monastir, in preparation for the extension of the attack across the Greek border toward <a href="/wiki/Florina" id="w">Florina</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/German_2nd_Panzer_Division" id="w">2nd Panzer Division</a> (XVIII Mountain troops) entered Yugoslavia from the east on the morning of April 6, and advanced westward through the Strimon Valley.

The Metaxas Line was defended by the <a href="/wiki/Hellenic_Army_IV_Army_Corps" id="w">Eastern Macedonia Army Section</a>, which comprised the 7th, 14th and 17th Infantry Divisions under the command of Lieutenant General Konstantinos Bakopoulos. The line ran for c.170 km along the river Nestos to the east, and then to the east following the Bulgarian border as far as <a href="/wiki/Belasica" id="w">Mount Beles</a> near the Yugoslav border. The fortifications were designed to garrison an army of over 200,000 troops, but due to a lack of available manpower, the actual number was roughly 70,000. As a result of the low numbers, the line&#39;s defenses were thinly spread.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>The initial German attacks against the line were undertaken by a single German infantry unit reinforced by two mountain divisions of the XVIII Mountain Corps. These first forces encountered strong resistance, and had limited success.<sup id="_ref-BCB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BCB" title="">[46]</a></sup> A German report at the end of the first day described how the <a href="/wiki/German_5th_Mountain_Division" id="w">German 5th Mountain Division</a> &#34;was repulsed in the Rupel Pass despite strongest air support and sustained considerable casualties&#34;.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> Of the twenty-four forts which made up the Metaxas Line, only two had fallen, and then only after they had been destroyed.<sup id="_ref-B50_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-B50" title="">[48]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The line was penetrated following a three-day struggle during which the Germans pummeled the forts with <a href="/wiki/Artillery" id="w">artillery</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dive_bomber" id="w">dive bombers</a>. The main credit for this achievement must be given to the <a href="/wiki/German_6th_Mountain_Division" id="w">6th Mountain Division</a>, which crossed a 7,000-foot snow-covered mountain range and broke through at a point that had been considered inaccessible by the Greeks. The force reached the rail line to Thessaloniki on the evening of April 7. The other XVIII Mountain Corps units advanced step by step under great hardship. The 5th Division, together with the reinforced 125th Infantry Regiment, penetrated the Strimon defenses on April 7, and attacked along both banks of the river,  clearing one bunker after another as they passed. Nevertheless the unit suffered heavy casualties, to the extent that it was withdrawn from further action after it had reached its objective location. The 72d Infantry Division advanced from <a href="/wiki/Gotse_Delchev_(town)" id="w">Nevrokop</a> across the mountains, and, although it was handicapped by a shortage of pack animals, medium artillery, and mountain equipment, it managed to break through the Metaxas Line on the evening of April 9, when it reached the area northeast of <a href="/wiki/Serres%2C_Greece" id="w">Serres</a>.<sup id="_ref-CB88_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB88" title="">[49]</a></sup> Even after General Bakopoulos surrendered the Metaxas Line, isolated fortresses held out for days, and were not taken until heavy artillery was utilised against them.

<p>The XXX Infantry Corps on the deft wing reached its designated objective on the evening of <a href="/wiki/April_8" id="w">April 8</a>, when the 164th Infantry Division captured <a href="/wiki/Xanthi" id="w">Xanthi</a>. The 50th Infantry Division advanced far beyond <a href="/wiki/Komotini" id="w">Komotini</a> towards the Nestos river, which both divisions reached on the next day. On April 9, the Greek Second Army capitulated unconditionally following the collapse of Greek resistance east of the Axios river. In an April 9 estimate of the situation, Field Marshal List expressed the opinion that as a result of the swift advance of the mobile units, his 12th Army was now in a favorable position to gain access to Central Greece by breaking the enemy buildup behind the Axios river. On the basis of this estimate List requested the transfer of the 5th Panzer Division from First Panzer Group to the XL Panzer Corps. He reasoned that its presence would give additional punch to the German thrust through the Monastir gap. For the continuation of the campaign he formed two attack groups, an eastern one under the command of XVIII Mountain Corps, and a western group led by <a href="/wiki/XL_Panzer_Corps" id="w">XL Panzer Corps</a>.<sup id="_ref-CB89-91_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB89-91" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>

<p>Wilson faced the prospect of being pinned by Germans operating from Thessaloniki, while being flanked by the German XL Panzer Corps descending through the Monastir Gap. On <a href="/wiki/April_13" id="w">April 13</a>, he decided to withdraw all British forces to the Haliacmon river, and then to the narrow pass at <a href="/wiki/Thermopylae" id="w">Thermopylae</a>.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> On April 14 the 9th Panzer Division established a bridgehead across the Haliacmon river, but an attempt to advance beyond this point was stopped by intense enemy fire. This defense had three main components: the <a href="/wiki/Platamon" id="w">Platamon</a> tunnel area between Olympus and the sea, the Olympus pass itself, and the <a href="/wiki/Servia%2C_Greece" id="w">Servia</a> pass to the southeast. By channelling the attack through these three defiles, the new line offered far greater defensive strength for the limited forces available. The defenses of the Olympus and Servia passes consisted of the 4th New Zealand Brigade, 5th New Zealand Brigade, and the 16th Australian Brigade. For the next three days the advance of the 9th Panzer Division was stalled in front of these resolutely held positions.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> </p>

As the invading Germans advanced deep into Greek territory, the Greek First Army operating in Albania was reluctant to retreat. General Wilson described this unwillingness as &#34;the fetishistic doctrine that not a yard of ground should be yielded to the Italians.&#34;<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> It was not until <a href="/wiki/April_13" id="w">April 13</a> that the first Greek elements began to withdraw toward the Pindus mountains. The Allies&#39; retreat to Thermopylae uncovered a route across the Pindus mountains by which the Germans might flank the Greek army in a rearguard action. An SS regiment was given the mission of cutting off the Greek First Army&#39;s line of retreat from Albania by driving westward to the <a href="/wiki/Metsovon" id="w">Metsovon</a> pass, and from there to Ioannina.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/April_14" id="w">April 14</a>, heavy fighting took place at Kastoria pass, where the Germans blocked the Greek withdrawal.

<p>General Papagos rushed Greek units to the Metsovon pass where the Germans were expected to attack.

<p>{{details}}
As early as <a href="/wiki/April_16" id="w">April 16</a>, the German command realized that the British were evacuating troops on ships at Volos and Piraeus. The whole campaign had taken on the character of a pursuit. For the Germans it was now primarily a question of maintaining contact with the retreating British forces, and foiling their evacuation plans. German infantry divisions were withdrawn from action due to a lack of mobility. The 2d and 5th Panzer Divisions, the 1st SS Motorized Infantry Regiment, and both mountain divisions launched a pursuit on enemy forces.<sup id="_ref-CB103_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB103" title="">[69]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>To allow an evacuation of the main body of British forces, Wilson ordered the rear guard to make a last stand at the historic Thermopylae pass, the gateway to Athens. General Freyberg was given the task of defending the coastal pass, while Mackay was to hold the village of <a href="/wiki/Brallos" id="w">Brallos</a>.

These brigades, the Australian 19th and 6th New Zealand were to hold the passes as long as possible, allowing the other units to withdraw. The Germans attacked on <a href="/wiki/April_24" id="w">April 24</a> at 11:30 a.m., met fierce resistance, lost fifteen tanks and sustained considerable casualties.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> The Allies held out the entire day; with the delaying action accomplished, they retreated in the direction of the evacuation beaches and set up another rearguard at Thebes.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> The Panzer units launching a pursuit along the road leading across the pass made slow progress because of the steep gradient and a large number of difficult hairpin bends.<sup id="_ref-CB104_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB104" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>

The Greek campaign ended in a complete German victory. The British did not have the necessary military resources in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" id="w">Middle East</a> to permit them to carry out simultaneous Iarge-scale operations in North Africa and the Balkans. Moreover, even if they had been able to block the German advance into Greece, they would have been unable to exploit the situation by a counterthrust across the Balkans. In enumerating the reasons for the quick and complete German victory in Greece, the following factors seem to have been of the greatest significance:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Germany&#39;s superiority in ground forces and equipment;<sup id="_ref-McC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McC" title="">[97]</a></sup></li>
<li>German supremacy in the air combined with the inability of the Greeks to provide to the RAF more airfields;<sup id="_ref-CB116-118_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB116-118" title="">[98]</a></sup></li>
<li>Inadequacy of the British expeditionary force, since the Imperial force available was small;<sup id="_ref-McC_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McC" title="">[97]</a></sup></li>
<li>Poor condition of the Greek Army and its shortage of modern equipment;<sup id="_ref-CB116-118_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB116-118" title="">[98]</a></sup></li>
<li>Inadequate port, road and railway facilities;<sup id="_ref-Mc471-472_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mc471-472" title="">[99]</a></sup></li>
<li>Absence of a unified command and lack of cooperation between the British, Greek, and Yugoslav forces;<sup id="_ref-CB116-118_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB116-118" title="">[98]</a></sup></li>
<li>Turkey&#39;s strict neutrality;<sup id="_ref-CB116-118_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB116-118" title="">[98]</a></sup> and</li>
<li>The early collapse of Yugoslav resistance.<sup id="_ref-CB116-118_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CB116-118" title="">[98]</a></sup> </li></ol>
<p>After the defeat of the Allies, the decision to send British forces into Greece was met with fierce criticism in the UK. Field Marshal <a href="/wiki/Alan_Brooke" id="w">Alan Brooke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_the_Imperial_General_Staff" id="w">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a> during World War II, considered intervention in Greece to be &#34;a definite strategic blunder&#34;, as it denied Wavell the necessary reserves to complete the conquest of <a href="/wiki/History_of_Libya_as_Italian_Colony" id="w">Italian-held Libya</a>, or to successfully withstand <a href="/wiki/Erwin_Rommel" id="w">Erwin Rommel</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Afrika_Korps" id="w">Afrika Korps</a> March offensive. It thus prolonged the <a href="/wiki/North_African_Campaign" id="w">North African Campaign</a>, which otherwise might have been successfully concluded within <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>.<sup id="_ref-B113_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-B113" title="">[100]</a></sup> In 1947 de Guingand asked the British government to recognize the mistakes it made when it laid out its strategy in Greece.<sup id="_ref-R624_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-R624" title="">[101]</a></sup> Buckley, on the other hand, argued that, if the UK had not answered its commitment of 1939 to defend Greece&#39;s independence, it would have severely damaged the ethical rationalizations of its struggle against Nazi Germany.<sup id="_ref-B138_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-B138" title="">[102]</a></sup> According to Professor of History, Heinz Richter, Churchill tried through the campaign in Greece to influence the political atmosphere in the United States, and he insisted on this strategy even after the defeat.<sup id="_ref-R424_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-R424" title="">[103]</a></sup> According to <a href="/wiki/John_Keegan" id="w">John Keegan</a>, &#34;the Greek campaign had been an old-fashioned gentlemen&#39;s war, with honor given and accepted by brave adversaries on each side&#34;, and the Greek and Allied forces, being vastly outnumbered, &#34;had, rightly, the sensation of having fought the good fight.&#34;<sup id="_ref-K158_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-K158" title="">[104]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Freyberg and Blamey had also serious doubts about the feasibility of the operation, but failed to advise their governments of their reservations and apprehensions.<sup id="_ref-Mc475-476_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mc475-476" title="">[105]</a></sup> The campaign caused a furor in Australia, when it became known that, when he received his first warning of the move to Greece on <a href="/wiki/February_18" id="w">February 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>, General Blamey was worried but had not informed the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Government" id="w">Australian Government</a>, having been told by General Wavell that <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Australia" id="w">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Menzies" id="w">Menzies</a> had already given his approval of the plan.<sup id="_ref-Mc476_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mc476" title="">[106]</a></sup> Indeed, the proposal had been accepted by a meeting of the War Cabinet in London at which Mr Menzies was present, but the Australian Prime Minister had been told by Churchill that both Freyberg and Blamey approved of the expedition.<sup id="_ref-R338_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-R338" title="">[107]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/March_5" id="w">March 5</a>, in a letter to Menzies, Blamey said that &#34;the plan is, of course, what I feared: piecemeal dispatch to Europe&#34;, and the next day he called the operation &#34;most hazardous&#34;. However, thinking that he was agreeable, the Australian Government had already committed the Australian Imperial Force to the Greek Campaign.<sup id="_ref-Mc115-476_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mc115-476" title="">[108]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1942 members of the <a href="/wiki/British_Parliament" id="w">British Parliament</a> characterized the campaign in Greece as a &#34;political and sentimental decision&#34;. Eden rejected the critics, argued that the UK&#39;s decision was unanimous, and asserted that the Battle of Greece delayed the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union.<sup id="_ref-R638-639_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-R638-639" title="">[109]</a></sup> This is an argument that some historians, such as Keegan have also used, in order to prove that Greek resistance may have been a turning point in World War II.<sup id="_ref-K144_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-K144" title="">[110]</a></sup> According to <a href="/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl" id="w">Leni Riefenstahl</a>, Hitler said that &#34;if the Italians hadn&#39;t attacked Greece and needed our help, the war would have taken a different course. We could have anticipated the Russian cold by weeks and conquered Leningrad and Moscow. There would have been no <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad" id="w">Stalingrad</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#_note-111" title="">[111]</a></sup> Despite his reservations, Brooke seems also to have conceded that the start of the offensive against the Soviet Union was in fact delayed because of the Balkan Campaign.<sup id="_ref-B113_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-B113" title="">[100]</a></sup> John N. Bradley and Thomas B. Buell conclude that &#34;although no single segment of the Balkan campaign forced the Germans to delay Barbarossa, obviously the entire campaign did prompt them to wait.&#34;<sup id="_ref-BB101_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BB101" title="">[112]</a></sup> On the other hand, Richter calls Eden&#39;s arguments a &#34;falsification of history&#34;.<sup id="_ref-R639-640_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-R639-640" title="">[113]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Basil_Liddell_Hart" id="w">Basil Liddell Hart</a> and de Guingand asserted that, even if Operation Marita delayed the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, this is not enough to vindicate the decision of the British government, because this was not its initial strategic goal.<sup id="_ref-R640_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-R640" title="">[114]</a></sup> In 1952 a scientific research of the Historical Branch of the UK Cabinet Office concluded that the Balkan Campaign had no influence on the launching of Operation Barbarossa.<sup id="_ref-R640_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-R640" title="">[114]</a></sup> According to Robert Kirchubel, &#34;the main causes for deferring Barbarossa&#39;s start from <a href="/wiki/May_15" id="w">May 15</a> to <a href="/wiki/June_22" id="w">June 22</a> were incomplete logistical arrangements, and an unusually wet winter that kept rivers at full flood until late spring.&#34;<sup id="_ref-K16_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-K16" title="">[115]</a></sup></p>

<p>In a speech made at the Reichstag in 1941, Hitler expressed his admiration for the Greek resistance,{{Cref}} saying of the campaign: &#34;Historical justice obliges me to state that of the enemies who took up positions against us, the Greek soldier particularly fought with the highest courage.
