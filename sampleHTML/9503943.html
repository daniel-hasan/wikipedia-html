<b>Equine nutrition</b> refers to the feeding of <a href="/wiki/Horse" id="w">horses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pony" id="w">ponies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mule" id="w">mules</a>, <a href="/wiki/Donkey" id="w">donkeys</a>, and other <a href="/wiki/Equidae" id="w">equines</a>. Correct and balanced <a href="/wiki/Nutrition" id="w">nutrition</a> is a critical component of proper <a href="/wiki/Horse_care" id="w">horse care</a>.</p>
<p>Horses are <a href="/wiki/Herbivores" id="w">herbivores</a>, a type of non-<a href="/wiki/Ruminant" id="w">ruminant</a> known as a &#34;hind-gut fermentor.&#34;  What this means is that horses have only one stomach, similar to humans.  However, unlike humans, they also have to digest plant fiber that comes from <a href="/wiki/Grass" id="w">grass</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hay" id="w">hay</a>.  Therefore, unlike <a href="/wiki/Ruminant" id="w">ruminants</a>, who digest <a href="/wiki/Fiber" id="w">fiber</a> in plant matter by use of a multichambered <a href="/wiki/Stomach" id="w">stomach</a>, horses use bacterial fermentation that occurs in the organ known as the <i><a href="/wiki/Cecum" id="w">cecum</a></i> (or <i>caecum</i>) to break down <a href="/wiki/Cellulose" id="w">cellulose</a>.  <sup id="_ref-Rutgers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rutgers" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In practical terms, horses prefer to eat small amounts of food steadily throughout the day, as they do in nature when <a href="/wiki/Grazing" id="w">grazing</a> on <a href="/wiki/Pasture" id="w">pasture</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, it is important to remember the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities. </p>
<p>The digestive system of the horse is somewhat delicate.  Because horses are unable to <a href="/wiki/Regurgitate" id="w">regurgitate</a> food, except from the <a href="/wiki/Esophagus" id="w">esophagus</a>, if they overeat or eat something poisonous, <a href="/wiki/Vomit" id="w">vomiting</a> is not an option.<sup id="_ref-Vet handbook_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vet handbook" title="">[3]</a></sup>  They also have a long, complex <a href="/wiki/Large_intestine" id="w">large intestine</a> and a balance of beneficial bacteria in their <a href="/wiki/Cecum" id="w">cecum</a> that can be upset by rapid changes in feed.  Because of these factors, they are very susceptible to <a href="/wiki/Horse_colic" id="w">colic</a>, which is a leading cause of death in horses.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Therefore, horses require clean, high-quality feed, provided at regular intervals, and may become ill if subjected to abrupt changes in their diets. <sup id="_ref-March_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-March" title="">[5]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Horses are also sensitive to molds and toxins.  For this reason, they must never be fed contaminated fermentable materials such as lawn clippings.<sup id="_ref-Nevada_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nevada" title="">[6]</a></sup>  Fermented <a href="/wiki/Silage" id="w">silage</a>, sometimes called &#34;haylage&#34; is fed to horses in some places; however, contamination or failure of the fermentation process that allows any mold or spoilage may be toxic.<sup id="_ref-Carbohydrates_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carbohydrates" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Haylage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haylage" title="">[8]</a></sup>  </p>
<a id="The_digestive_system" name="The_digestive_system"></a><h1>The digestive system</h1>
<p>{{Main}}
Horses and other members of the <i><a href="/wiki/Equidae" id="w">Equidae</a></i> family are adapted by <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_biology" id="w">evolutionary biology</a> to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, horses ate <a href="/wiki/Prairie" id="w">prairie</a> grasses in semi-arid regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Therefore, their digestive system was made to work best with a small but steady flow of food that does not change much from day to day. </p>
<a id="Chewing_and_swallowing" name="Chewing_and_swallowing"></a><h2>Chewing and swallowing</h2>
<p>Digestion begins in the <a href="/wiki/Mouth" id="w">mouth</a>.  First, the animal selects pieces of <a href="/wiki/Forage" id="w">forage</a> and picks up finer foods, such as <a href="/wiki/Grain" id="w">grain</a>, with sensitive, <a href="/wiki/Prehensile" id="w">prehensile</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lip" id="w">lips</a>.  The front <a href="/wiki/Horse_teeth" id="w">teeth</a> of the horse, called <a href="/wiki/Incisor" id="w">incisors</a>, clip <a href="/wiki/Forage" id="w">forage</a>, and food is ground up for swallowing by the <a href="/wiki/Premolar" id="w">premolars</a> and <a href="/wiki/Molars" id="w">molars</a>. <sup id="_ref-Vet handbook_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vet handbook" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Esophagus" id="w">esophagus</a> carries food to the stomach. The esophagus enters the stomach at an acute angle, creating a one-way valve, with a powerful spincter mechanism at the gastroesophageal junction, which is why horses cannot <a href="/wiki/Vomit" id="w">vomit</a>.<sup id="_ref-Vet handbook_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vet handbook" title="">[3]</a></sup>  The esophagus is also the area of the digestive tract where horses may suffer from <a href="/wiki/Choke_(horse)" id="w">choke</a>.

<a id="The_stomach_and_small_intestine" name="The_stomach_and_small_intestine"></a><h2>The stomach and small intestine</h2>
<p>Horses have a relatively small <a href="/wiki/Stomach" id="w">stomach</a> for their size, which limits the amount of feed that can be taken in at one time.  The average sized horse has a stomach with a capacity of only four gallons, and works best when it contains about two gallons. One reason continuous foraging or several small feedings per day are better than one or two large meals is because the stomach begins to empty when it is 2/3 full, whether the food in the stomach is processed or not.<sup id="_ref-Vet handbook_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vet handbook" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Small_intestine" id="w">small intestine</a> is 50 to 70 feet long and holds 10 to 12 gallons. This is the major digestive organ where most nutrients are absorbed.<sup id="_ref-Digestive system_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Digestive system" title="">[10]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Bile" id="w">Bile</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Liver" id="w">liver</a> acts here, combined with <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" id="w">enzymes</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Pancreas" id="w">pancreas</a> and small intestine itself.  Equids do not have a <a href="/wiki/Gall_bladder" id="w">gall bladder</a>, so bile flows constantly, another reason for a slow but steady supply of food.  Most nutrition is absorbed into the bloodstream from the small intestine.<sup id="_ref-Vet handbook_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vet handbook" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_cecum_and_large_intestine" name="The_cecum_and_large_intestine"></a><h2>The cecum and large intestine</h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Cecum" id="w">cecum</a> is the first section of the <a href="/wiki/Large_intestine" id="w">large intestine</a>. It is also known as the &#34;water gut&#34; or &#34;hind gut.&#34; It is a cul-de-sac pouch,<sup id="_ref-Digestive system_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Digestive system" title="">[10]</a></sup> about 4 feet long that holds 7 to 8 gallons. It digests <a href="/wiki/Cellulose" id="w">cellulose</a> plant <a href="/wiki/Fiber" id="w">fiber</a> through bacterial <a href="/wiki/Fermentation_(biochemistry)" id="w">fermentation</a>.<sup id="_ref-Rutgers_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rutgers" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The reason horses must have their diets changed slowly is so the bacteria in the cecum are able to modify and adapt to the different chemical structure of new feedstuffs.<sup id="_ref-Digestive system_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Digestive system" title="">[10]</a></sup> Too abrupt a change in diet can cause colic, as the new food is not properly digested.</p>
<p>The large <a href="/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)" id="w">colon</a>, small colon, and <a href="/wiki/Rectum" id="w">rectum</a> make up the remainder of the <a href="/wiki/Large_intestine" id="w">large intestine</a>. The large colon is 10-12 feet long and holds up to 20 gallons of semi-liquid matter.  Its main purpose it to absorb carbohydrates which were broken down from cellulose in the cecum. Due to its many twists and turns, it is a common place for a type of <a href="/wiki/Horse_colic" id="w">horse colic</a> called an impaction.<sup id="_ref-Rutgers_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rutgers" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Digestive system_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Digestive system" title="">[10]</a></sup>  The small colon is 10-12 feet long, holds about 5 gallons, is the area where the majority of water is absorbed, and where <a href="/wiki/Fecal" id="w">fecal</a> balls are formed. The <a href="/wiki/Rectum" id="w">rectum</a> is about one foot long, and acts as a holding chamber for waste, which is then expelled from the body via the <a href="/wiki/Anus" id="w">anus</a>.<sup id="_ref-Vet handbook_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vet handbook" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Nutrients" name="Nutrients"></a><h1>Nutrients</h1>
<p>Like all animals, equines require five main classes of nutrients to survive: <a href="/wiki/Water" id="w">water</a>, energy (primarily in the form of <a href="/wiki/Fat" id="w">fats</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carbohydrates" id="w">carbohydrates</a>), <a href="/wiki/Protein" id="w">proteins</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vitamin" id="w">vitamins</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Minerals" id="w">minerals</a>.<sup id="_ref-Purdue_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Purdue" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Water" name="Water"></a><h2>Water</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Water" id="w">Water</a> makes up between 62-68% of a horse&#39;s body weight and is essential for life.<sup id="_ref-Kane_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kane" title="">[12]</a></sup>  Horses can only live a few days without water,<sup id="_ref-Purdue_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Purdue" title="">[11]</a></sup> becoming dangerously dehydrated if they lose 8-10% of their natural body water.<sup id="_ref-Kane_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kane" title="">[12]</a></sup> Therefore, it is critically important to provide access to a fresh, clean, and adequate supply of water.</p>
<p>An average 1000 lb (450kg) horse drinks 10 to 12 gallons of water per day, more in hot weather, when eating dry forage such as <a href="/wiki/Hay" id="w">hay</a>, or when consuming high levels of salt, potassium, and magnesium.  Horses drink less water in cool weather or when on lush <a href="/wiki/Pasture" id="w">pasture</a>, which has a relatively higher water content. When under hard work, or if a <a href="/wiki/Mare_(horse)" id="w">mare</a> is <a href="/wiki/Lactating" id="w">lactating</a>, water requirements may be as much as four times greater than normal.<sup id="_ref-Rutgers_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rutgers" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-water_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-water" title="">[13]</a></sup> Though they need a great deal of water, horses spend very little time drinking; usually 1-8 minutes a day, spread out in 2-8 episodes.<sup id="_ref-Kane_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kane" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Water plays an important part in digestion. The forages and grains horses eat are mixed with saliva in the mouth to make a moist bolus that can be easily swallowed.

Horses that are not subjected to hard work or extreme conditions usually have more than adequate amounts of vitamins in their diet if they are receiving fresh, green, leafy forages.  Sometimes a vitamin supplement is needed when feeding low-quality hay, if a horse is under stress (illness, traveling, showing, racing, and so on), or not eating well.  Grain has a different balance of nutrients than forage, and so requires specialized supplementation to prevent an imbalance of vitamins and minerals.<sup id="_ref-Rutgers_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rutgers" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Minerals are required for maintenance and function of the <a href="/wiki/Skeleton" id="w">skeleton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nerve" id="w">nerves</a> and muscles. These include <a href="/wiki/Calcium" id="w">calcium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phosphorus" id="w">phosphorus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sodium" id="w">sodium</a>, <a href="/wiki/Potassium" id="w">potassium</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Chloride" id="w">chloride</a>, and are commonly found in most good-quality feeds.

<p>Hay, particularly alfalfa, is sometimes compressed into pellets or cubes.  Processed hay can be of more consistent quality and is more convenient to ship and to store.  It is also easily obtained in areas that may be suffering localized hay shortages.  However, these more concentrated forms can be overfed and horses are somewhat more prone to <a href="/wiki/Choke_(horse)" id="w">choke</a> on them. On the other hand, hay pellets and cubes can be soaked until they break apart into a pulp or thick slurry, and in this state are a very useful source of food for horses with <a href="/wiki/Horse_teeth" id="w">tooth</a> problems such as dental disease, tooth loss due to age, or structural anomalies.</p>
<p><i>Haylage</i>, also known as <i>Round bale silage</i> is a term for grass sealed in airtight plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States.<sup id="_ref-Pony2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pony2" title="">[23]</a></sup> Because haylage is a type of <a href="/wiki/Silage" id="w">silage</a>, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale.<sup id="_ref-Haylage_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haylage" title="">[8]</a></sup>If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent <a href="/wiki/Botulism" id="w">botulism</a> toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.</p>
<p>Another type of forage sometimes provided to horses is <a href="/wiki/Beet_pulp" id="w">beet pulp</a>, a byproduct left over from the processing of <a href="/wiki/Sugar_beet" id="w">sugar beets</a>, which is high in energy as well as fiber.<sup id="_ref-Myths_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Myths" title="">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Sometimes, <a href="/wiki/Straw" id="w">straw</a> or <a href="/wiki/Chaff" id="w">chaff</a> from <a href="/wiki/Cereal_grain" id="w">cereal grains</a> is fed to animals.

</p><a id="Grains" name="Grains"></a><h4>Grains</h4>

<p>Whole or crushed <a href="/wiki/Grain" id="w">grains</a> are the most common form of concentrated feed, sometimes referred to generically as &#34;oats&#34; or &#34;corn&#34; even if those grains are not present, also sometimes called &#34;straights&#34; in the <a href="/wiki/UK" id="w">UK</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Oat" id="w">Oats</a> are the most popular <a href="/wiki/Grain" id="w">grain</a> for horses. Oats have a lower digestible energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the equine digestive system. They are also more palatable and digestible other grains.<sup id="_ref-Horse sense_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Horse sense" title="">[18]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Carbohydrates_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carbohydrates" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Maize" id="w">Corn</a>, referred to as <a href="/wiki/Maize" id="w">Maize</a> in the UK, is the second most palatable grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, is easy to over-feed corn, causing <a href="/wiki/Obesity" id="w">obesity</a>, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn should never be fed because it is poisonous to horses.<sup id="_ref-Purdue_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Purdue" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Barley" id="w">Barley</a> is also fed to horses, but needs to be processed to crack the seed hull and allow easier digestibility.<sup id="_ref-Carbohydrates_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carbohydrates" title="">[7]</a></sup> It is frequently fed in combination with oats and corn, a mix informally referred to by the acronym &#34;COB&#34; (for Corn, Oats and Barley).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Wheat" id="w">Wheat</a> is generally not used as a concentrate.  However, <a href="/wiki/Wheat_bran" id="w">wheat bran</a> is sometimes added to the diet of a horse for supplemental nutrition, usually moistened and in the form of a bran mash.<sup id="_ref-Carbohydrates_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carbohydrates" title="">[7]</a></sup>  Wheat bran is high in phosphorus, so must be fed carefully so that it does not cause an imbalance in the Ca:P ratio of a ration.  Once touted for a laxative effect, this use of bran is now considered unnecessary, as horses, unlike humans, obtain sufficient fiber in their diets from other sources.<sup id="_ref-Myths_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Myths" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Mixes_and_Pellets" name="Mixes_and_Pellets"></a><h4>Mixes and Pellets</h4>
<p>Many feed manufacturers combine various grains and add additional vitamin and mineral supplements to create a complete premixed feed that is easy for owners to feed and of predictable nutritional quality.<sup id="_ref-Horse sense_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Horse sense" title="">[18]</a></sup>  Some of these prepared feeds are manufactured in pelleted form, others retain the grains in their original form.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> In many cases <a href="/wiki/Molasses" id="w">molasses</a> as a binder to keep down dust and for increased palatability.<sup id="_ref-Carbohydrates_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carbohydrates" title="">[7]</a></sup> Grain mixes with added molasses are usually called &#34;Sweet feed&#34; in the USA and &#34;Coarse mix&#34; in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>. Pelleted or <i>extruded</i> feeds (sometimes referred to as &#34;nuts&#34; in the UK) may be easier to chew and result in less wasted feed. Horses generally eat pellets as easily as grain. However, pellets are also more expensive, and even &#34;complete&#34; rations do not eliminate the necessity for forage.<sup id="_ref-Briggs_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Briggs" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Supplements" name="Supplements"></a><h4>Supplements</h4>
<p>The average modern horse on good hay or pasture with light work usually does not need supplements; however, horses subjected to stress due to age, intensive athletic work, or reproduction may need additional nutrition.<sup id="_ref-Penn_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Penn" title="">[20]</a></sup> Extra fat and protein are sometimes added to the horse&#39;s diet, along with vitamin and mineral supplements.<sup id="_ref-fat_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fat" title="">[16]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Soybean" id="w">Soybean</a> meal is a common protein supplement, and averages about 44% crude protein.

Most horses only need quality forage, water and a salt or mineral block.<sup id="_ref-Purdue_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Purdue" title="">[11]</a></sup> Grain or other concentrates are often not necessary.<sup id="_ref-March_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-March" title="">[5]</a></sup>  But, when grain or other concentrates are fed, quantities must be carefully monitored. To do so, horse feed is measured by weight, not volume.  For example, 1 lb. of oats has a different volume than 1 lb. of corn.<sup id="_ref-Rutgers_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rutgers" title="">[1]</a></sup> When continuous access to feed is not possible, it is more consistent with natural feeding behavior to provide three small feedings per day instead of one or two large ones.  However, even two daily feedings is preferable to only one.<sup id="_ref-Nevada_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nevada" title="">[6]</a></sup> To gauge the amount to feed, a weight tape, available at most feed stores, can be used to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of a horse&#39;s weight.  The tape measures the circumference of the horse&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Horse_anatomy" id="w">barrel</a>, just behind the withers and elbows, and the tape is calibrated to convert inches or centimeters into approximate pounds or kilograms.</p>
<p>Actual amounts fed vary by the size of the horse, the age of the horse, the climate, and the work to which the animal is put.  In addition, <a href="/wiki/Genetic" id="w">genetic</a> factors play a role.  Some animals are naturally <a href="/wiki/Easy_keeper" id="w">easy keepers</a>, which means that they can thrive on relatively small amounts of food and are prone to <a href="/wiki/Obesity" id="w">obesity</a> and other health problems if overfed.  Others are <a href="/wiki/Hard_keeper" id="w">hard keepers</a>, meaning that they are prone to be thin and require considerably more food to maintain a healthy weight.  </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Veterinarian" id="w">Veterinarians</a> are usually a good source for recommendations on appropriate types and amounts of feed for a specific horse.  There are also numerous books written on the topic.  Feed manufacturers usually offer very specific guidelines for how to select and properly feed products from their company, and in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, the local office of the <a href="/wiki/Cooperative_Extension_Service" id="w">Cooperative Extension Service</a> can provide educational materials and expert recommendations.</p>
<a id="Feeding_forages" name="Feeding_forages"></a><h2>Feeding forages</h2>
<p>Equids always require forage.  When possible, nutritionists recommend it be available at all times, at least when doing so does not overfeed the animal and lead to <a href="/wiki/Obesity" id="w">obesity</a>.  It is safe to feed a ration that is 100% forage<sup id="_ref-March_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-March" title="">[5]</a></sup> (along with water and supplemental salt), and any feed ration should be at least 50% forage.<sup id="_ref-Feeding factors_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Feeding factors" title="">[21]</a></sup> Hay with alfalfa or other legumes has more concentrated nutrition and so is fed in smaller amounts than grass hay, though many hays have a mixture of both types of plant.  </p>
<p>When <a href="/wiki/Beet_pulp" id="w">beet pulp</a> is fed, a ration of 2 to 5 pounds is usually soaked in water for 3 to 4 hours prior to feeding in order to make it more palatable, and to minimize the risk of choke and other problems.  It is usually soaked in a proportion of one part beet pulp to two parts water.  Beet pulp is usually fed in addition to hay, but occasionally is a replacement for hay when fed to very old horses who can no longer chew properly.<sup id="_ref-Myths_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Myths" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some pelleted rations are designed to be a &#34;complete&#34; feed that contains both hay and grain, meeting all the horse&#39;s nutritional needs.  However, even these rations should have some hay or pasture provided, a minimum of a half-pound of forage for every 100 pounds of horse, in order to keep the digestive system functioning properly and to meet the horse&#39;s urge to graze.<sup id="_ref-Briggs_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Briggs" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Recent studies address the level of various <a href="/wiki/Non-structural_carbohydrate" id="w">non-structural carbohydrates</a> (NSC), such as <a href="/wiki/Fructan" id="w">fructan</a>, in forages.  Too high an NSC level causes difficulties for animals prone to <a href="/wiki/Laminitis" id="w">laminitis</a> or <a href="/wiki/Equine_polysaccharide_storage_myopathy" id="w">equine polysaccharide storage myopathy</a> (EPSM).  NSC cannot be determined by looking at forage, but hay and pasture grasses can be tested for NSC levels.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Feeding_concentrates" name="Feeding_concentrates"></a><h2>Feeding concentrates</h2>
<p>Concentrates, when fed, are recommended to be provided in quantities no greater than 1% of a horse&#39;s body weight per day,<sup id="_ref-Penn_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Penn" title="">[20]</a></sup> and preferably in two or more feedings.<sup id="_ref-Rutgers_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rutgers" title="">[1]</a></sup>  If a ration needs to contain a higher percent of concentrates, such as that of a <a href="/wiki/Horse_racing" id="w">race horse</a>, bulky grains such as oats should be used as much as possible; a loose mass of feed helps prevent impaction colic.<sup id="_ref-LSU_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LSU" title="">[34]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Peptic_ulcer" id="w">Peptic ulcers</a> are linked to a too-high concentration of grain in the diet, particularly noticed modern racehorses, where some studies show such ulcers affecting up to 90% of all race horses.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In general, the portion of the ration that should be grain or other concentrated feed is 0 to 10% grain for mature idle horses; between 20 to 70% for horses at work, depending on age, intensity of activity and energy requirements.<sup id="_ref-Feeding factors_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Feeding factors" title="">[21]</a></sup> Concentrates should not be fed to horses within one hour before or after a heavy workout.<sup id="_ref-March_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-March" title="">[5]</a></sup> Concentrates also need to be adjusted to level of performance.<sup id="_ref-Purdue_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Purdue" title="">[11]</a></sup> Not only can excess grain and inadequate exercise lead to behavior problems,<sup id="_ref-Myths_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Myths" title="">[15]</a></sup> it may also trigger <a href="/wiki/Equine_Exertional_Rhabdomyolysis" id="w">Equine Exertional Rhabdomyolysis</a>, or &#34;tying up,&#34; in horses prone to the condition.<sup id="_ref-LSU_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LSU" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Access_to_water" name="Access_to_water"></a><h2>Access to water</h2>
<p>Horses normally require free access to all the fresh, clean <a href="/wiki/Water" id="w">water</a> they want, and to avoid dehydration, should not be kept from water longer than four hours at any one time.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> However, water may need to be temporarily limited in quantity when a horse is very hot after a heavy workout. As long as a hot horse continues to work, it can drink its fill at periodic intervals, provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources.  But when the workout is over, a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30—90 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time. However, dehydration is also a concern, so some water needs to be offered during the cooling off process.  A hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked.  Sometimes the thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout, which is another reason to offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period.<sup id="_ref-water_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-water" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Myths_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Myths" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even a slightly dehydrated horse is at higher risk of developing impaction <a href="/wiki/Horse_colic" id="w">colic</a>. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed.<sup id="_ref-Kane_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kane" title="">[12]</a></sup> Thus, it is especially important for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses&#39; natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add <a href="/wiki/Electrolytes" id="w">electrolytes</a> to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.<sup id="_ref-Kane_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kane" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>It is important to track the weight of a pony carefully, by use of a weight tape.

Like ponies, <a href="/wiki/Mule" id="w">mules</a> and <a href="/wiki/Donkey" id="w">donkeys</a> are also very hardy and generally need less concentrated feed than horses.  Mules need less protein than horses and do best on grass hay with a vitamin and mineral supplement.<sup id="_ref-Fuess_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fuess" title="">[39]</a></sup>  If mules are fed concentrates, they only need about half of what a horse requires.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Like horses, mules require fresh, clean water, but are less likely to over-drink when hot.<sup id="_ref-Fuess_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fuess" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Donkeys, like mules, need less protein and more fiber than horses. They do best when allowed to consume small amounts of food over long periods, as is natural for them in an arid climate. They can meet their nutritional needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought. If they are worked long hours or do not have access to pasture, they require hay or a similar dried forage, with no more than a 1:4 ratio of legumes to grass.  They also require salt and mineral supplements, and access to clean, fresh water.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup>  Like ponies and mules, in a lush climate, donkeys are prone to obesity and are at risk of laminitis.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Treats" name="Treats"></a><h2>Treats</h2>
<p>Many people like to feed horses special treats such as <a href="/wiki/Carrot" id="w">carrots</a>, sugar cubes, peppermint candies or specially manufactured horse &#34;cookies.&#34;  Horses do not need treats, and due to the risk of colic or choke, many horse owners do not allow their horses to be given treats.  There are also behavioral issues that some horses may develop if given too many treats, particularly a tendency to bite if hand-fed, and for this reason many horse trainers and riding instructors discourage the practice.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, if treats are allowed, carrots and compressed hay pellets are common, nutritious, and generally not harmful.  Apples are also acceptable, though it is best if they are first cut into slices.  Horse &#34;cookies&#34; are often specially manufactured out of ordinary grains and some added molasses.  They generally will not cause nutritional problems when fed in small quantities.   However, many types of human foods are potentially dangerous to a horse and should not be fed.  This includes bread products, meat products, candy, and carbonated or alcoholic beverages.  </p>
<p>It was once a common practice to give horses a weekly <i>bran mash</i> of wheat bran mixed with warm water and other ingredients.  It is still done regularly in some places.  While a warm, soft meal is a treat many horses enjoy, and was once considered helpful for its laxative effect, it is not nutritionally necessary.  An old horse with poor teeth may benefit from food softened in water, a mash may help provide extra <a href="/wiki/Hydration" id="w">hydration</a>, and a warm meal may be comforting in cold weather, but horses have far more fiber in their regular diet than do humans, and so any assistance from bran is unnecessary. There is also a risk that too much wheat bran may provide excessive phosphorus, unbalancing the diet, and a feed of unusual contents fed only once a week could trigger a bout of colic.<sup id="_ref-Myths_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Myths" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Feed_storage" name="Feed_storage"></a><h1>Feed storage</h1>
<p>All hay and concentrated feeds must kept dry and free of <a href="/wiki/Mold" id="w">mold</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rodent" id="w">rodent</a> feces and other types of contamination that may cause illness in horses.<sup id="_ref-March_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-March" title="">[5]</a></sup> Feed kept outside or otherwise exposed to moisture can develop mold quite quickly.  Due to fire hazards, hay is often stored under an open shed or under a tarp, rather than inside a horse barn itself, but should be kept under some kind of cover.  Concentrates take up less storage space, are less of a fire hazard, and are usually kept in a barn or enclosed shed.  A secure door or latched gate between the animals and any feed storage area is critical.  Horses accidentally getting into stored feed and eating too much at one time is a common but preventable way that horses develop colic or laminitis.  (<i>see</i> &#34;Illnesses related to improper feeding,&#34; <i>below</i>)</p>
<p>It is also important to never give a horse feed that was contaminated by the remains of a dead animal, it is a potential source of <a href="/wiki/Botulism" id="w">botulism</a>.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> This is not an uncommon situation.  For example, <a href="/wiki/Mouse" id="w">mice</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bird" id="w">birds</a> can get into poorly stored grain and be trapped; hay bales sometimes accidentally contain <a href="/wiki/Snake" id="w">snakes</a>, mice, or other small animals that were caught in the <a href="/wiki/Hay" id="w">baling</a> machinery during the harvesting process.  </p>
<a id="Feeding_behavior" name="Feeding_behavior"></a><h1>Feeding behavior</h1>
<p>Horses can become anxious or stressed if there are long periods of time between meals. They also do best when they are fed on a regular schedule, they are creatures of habit and easily upset by changes in routine.<sup id="_ref-Rutgers_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rutgers" title="">[1]</a></sup>  When horses are in a herd, their <a href="/wiki/Horse_behavior" id="w">behavior</a> is hierarchical;<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> the higher-ranked animals in the herd eat and drink first.  Low-status animals, who eat last, may not get enough food, and if there is little available feed, higher-ranking horses may keep lower-ranking ones from eating at all.  Therefore, unless a herd is on pasture that meets the nutritional needs of all individuals, it is important to either feed horses separately,<sup id="_ref-Purdue_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Purdue" title="">[11]</a></sup> or spread  feed out in separate areas to be sure all animals get roughly equal amounts of food to eat.  In some situations where horses are kept together, they may still be placed into separate herds, depending on nutritional needs; overweight horses are kept separate from thin horses so that rations may be adjusted accordingly. </p>
<a id="Dental_issues" name="Dental_issues"></a><h1>Dental issues</h1>
<p>{{Main}}
Horses&#39; <a href="/wiki/Horse_teeth" id="w">teeth</a> continually erupt throughout their life, are worn down as they eat, and can develop uneven wear patterns that can interfere with chewing.  For this reason, horses need a <a href="/wiki/Horse_care" id="w">dental examination</a> at least once a year, and particular care must be paid to the dental needs of older horses.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> The process of grinding off uneven wear patterns on a horse&#39;s teeth is called <i>floating</i> and can be performed by a <a href="/wiki/Veterinarian" id="w">veterinarian</a> or a specialist in equine dentistry.</p>
<a id="Illnesses_related_to_improper_feeding" name="Illnesses_related_to_improper_feeding"></a><h1>Illnesses related to improper feeding</h1>
<p>Colic, choke, and laminitis can be life-threatening when a horse is severely affected, and <a href="/wiki/Veterinarian" id="w">veterinary</a> care is necessary to properly treat these conditions.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup>  Other conditions, while not life-threatening, may have serious implications for the long-term health and soundness of a horse.</p>
<a id="Colic" name="Colic"></a><h2>Colic</h2>
<p>{{Main}}
<a href="/wiki/Horse_colic" id="w">Horse colic</a> itself is not a disease, but rather a description of symptoms connected to abdominal pain.<sup id="_ref-Vet handbook_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vet handbook" title="">[3]</a></sup>  It can occur due to any number of digestive upsets, from mild bloating due to excess intestinal gas to life-threatening impactions. <sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> Colic is most often caused by a change in diet, either a planned change that takes place too quickly, or an accidental change, such as a horse getting out of its barn or paddock and ingesting unfamiliar plants. But colic has many other possible triggers including insufficient water, an irregular feeding schedule, stress, and illness.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup>  Because the horse cannot vomit and has a limited capacity to detoxify harmful substances, anything upsetting to the horse must travel all the way through the digestive system to be expelled.</p>
<a id="Choke" name="Choke"></a><h2>Choke</h2>
<p>{{Main}}
<a href="/wiki/Choke_(horse)" id="w">Choke</a> is not as common as colic, but is nonetheless commonly considered a veterinary emergency.  The most common cause of choke is horses not chewing their food thoroughly, usually because of eating their food too quickly, especially if they do not have sufficient access to water, but also sometimes due to dental problems that make chewing painful. It is exceedingly difficult for a horse to expel anything from the esophagus, and immediate treatment is often required. Unlike choking in humans, choke in horses does not cut off respiration.<sup id="_ref-Vet handbook_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vet handbook" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Laminitis" name="Laminitis"></a><h2>Laminitis</h2>
<p>{{Main}}
Horses are also susceptible to <a href="/wiki/Laminitis" id="w">laminitis</a>, a disease of the lamina of the <a href="/wiki/Horse_hoof" id="w">hoof</a>.  Laminitis has many causes, but the most common is related to a <a href="/wiki/Sugar" id="w">sugar</a> and starch overload from a horse overeating certain types of food, particularly too much <a href="/wiki/Pasture" id="w">pasture</a> grass high in <a href="/wiki/Fructan" id="w">fructan</a> in early spring and late fall, or by getting into excessive quantities of grain.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Growth_disorders" name="Growth_disorders"></a><h2>Growth disorders</h2>
<p>Young horses that are overfed or are fed a diet with an improper calcium:phosphorus ratio over time may develop a number of growth and <a href="/wiki/Orthopedic" id="w">orthopedic</a> disorders, including <a href="/wiki/Epiphysitis" id="w">epiphysitis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Osteochondrosis" id="w">osteochondrosis</a> and a several conditions grouped under the popular term &#34;contracted tendons.&#34;  If not properly treated, damage can be permanent.  However, they can be treated if caught in time, given proper veterinary care, and any  improper feeding practices are corrected.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup>  Young horses being fed for rapid growth in order to be shown or sold as <a href="/wiki/Yearling_(horse)" id="w">yearlings</a> are at particularly high risk.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup>  Adult horses with an improper diet may also develop a range of metabolic problems.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Equine_Exertional_Rhabdomyolysis" id="w">Equine Exertional Rhabdomyolysis</a>, or &#34;tying up,&#34; is a condition to which only some horses are susceptible.
