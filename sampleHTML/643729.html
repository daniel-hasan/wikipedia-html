<p>In <a href="/wiki/Music" id="w">music</a>, <b>arch form</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Section_(music)" id="w">sectional</a> <a href="/wiki/Musical_form" id="w">structure</a> for a piece of music based on <a href="/wiki/Repetition" id="w">repetition</a>, in reverse order, of all or most musical sections such that the overall form is <a href="/wiki/Symmetric" id="w">symmetric</a>, most often around a central movement. The sections need not be repeated verbatim but must at least share <a href="/wiki/Theme_(music)" id="w">thematic</a> material.</p>
<p>It creates interest through interplay among &#34;memory, variation, and progression.&#34; Though the form appears to be static and to deny progress, the pairs of movements create a &#34;unidirectional process&#34; with the center, and the form &#34;actually engenders specific expressive possibilities that would otherwise be unavailable for the work as a whole.&#34; (Wilson 1992, p.32)</p>
