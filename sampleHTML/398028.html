<p><b><i>Night</i></b> is a work by <a href="/wiki/Elie_Wiesel" id="w">Elie Wiesel</a> based on his experience, as a young <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism" id="w">Orthodox Jew</a>, of being sent with his family to the German <a href="/wiki/Death_camp" id="w">death camp</a> at <a href="/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp" id="w">Auschwitz</a>, and later to the <a href="/wiki/Concentration_camp" id="w">concentration camp</a> at <a href="/wiki/Buchenwald" id="w">Buchenwald</a>.<sup id="_ref-AP_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AP" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wiesel was 16 years old when Buchenwald was liberated in April 1945.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Having lost his faith in <a href="/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Judaism" id="w">God</a> and humanity, he vowed not to speak of his experiences for ten years, at the end of which he wrote his story in <a href="/wiki/Yiddish" id="w">Yiddish</a>, which was published in Buenos Aires in 1955. In May that year, the French novelist <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mauriac" id="w">François Mauriac</a> persuaded him to write the story for a wider audience.<sup id="_ref-Seidman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seidman" title="">[3]</a></sup> Fifty years later, the 109-page volume, described as devastating in its simplicity,<sup id="_ref-Franklin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[4]</a></sup> ranks alongside <a href="/wiki/Primo_Levi" id="w">Primo Levi</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/If_This_is_a_Man" id="w">If This is a Man</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Anne_Frank" id="w">Anne Frank</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl" id="w">The Diary of a Young Girl</a></i> as one of the bedrocks of <a href="/wiki/Category:Holocaust_literature" id="w">Holocaust literature</a>.</p>
<p>Wiesel deploys a sparse and fragmented <a href="/wiki/Narrative" id="w">narrative</a> style, with frequent shifts in point of view.<sup id="_ref-Fine7_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fine7" title="">[5]</a></sup> It is &#34;the style of the chroniclers of the <a href="/wiki/Ghetto" id="w">ghettos</a>,&#34; he writes, &#34;where everything had to be said swiftly, with one breath. You never knew when the enemy might kick in the door ...&#34;<sup id="_ref-rivers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rivers" title="">[6]</a></sup> The recurring themes are Wiesel&#39;s increasing disgust with mankind and his loss of faith in God, reflected in the inversion of the father-child relationship as his father declines to a helpless state and the teenager becomes his resentful caregiver. &#34;If only I could get rid of this dead weight, so that I could use all my strength to struggle for my own survival ... Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.&#34;<sup id="_ref-N101_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N101" title="">[7]</a></sup> In <i>Night</i>, everything is inverted, every value destroyed. &#34;Here there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends,&#34; a <a href="/wiki/Kapo_(concentration_camp)" id="w">Kapo</a> tells him. &#34;Everyone lives and dies for himself alone.&#34;<sup id="_ref-N105_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N105" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Night</i> is the first book in a <a href="/wiki/Trilogy" id="w">trilogy</a> &#8212; <i>Night</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Dawn_(novel)" id="w">Dawn</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Day_(novel)" id="w">Day</a></i> &#8212; reflecting Wiesel&#39;s state of mind during and after the <a href="/wiki/Holocaust" id="w">Holocaust</a>. The titles mark his transition from darkness to light, according to the Jewish tradition of counting the beginning of a new day from <a href="/wiki/Sunset" id="w">nightfall</a>, from <a href="/wiki/Genesis" id="w">Genesis</a> (1:5): &#34;And there was evening, and there was morning, one day.&#34;<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>&#34;In <i>Night</i>,&#34; Wiesel said, &#34;I wanted to show the end, the finality of the event. Everything came to an end &#8212; man, history, literature, religion, God. There was nothing left. And yet we begin again with night.&#34;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>Wiesel was born on <a href="/wiki/September_30" id="w">September 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1928" id="w">1928</a> in <a href="/wiki/Sighetu_Marma%C5%A3iei" id="w">Sighet</a>, a village in the <a href="/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains" id="w">Carpathian mountains</a> in northern Transylvania, which was annexed by <a href="/wiki/Hungary" id="w">Hungary</a> in 1940. With his father Shlomo, his mother Sarah, and his three sisters &#8212; Hilda, Beatrice, and seven-year-old Tzipora &#8212; he lived as part of a close-knit community of between 10,000 and 20,000 mostly <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism" id="w">Orthodox</a> Jews.</p>
<p>When Germany invaded Hungary at midnight on <a href="/wiki/March_18" id="w">March 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>, few believed they were in danger, and <i>Night</i> opens with Moshe the <a href="/wiki/Beadle" id="w">Beadle</a>, the caretaker in Wiesel&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Synagogue" id="w">synagogue</a> and the town&#39;s humblest resident &#8212; &#34;awkward as a clown&#34;<sup id="_ref-N1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N1" title="">[11]</a></sup> but much loved &#8212; warning his neighbors in vain to save themselves.</p>
<p>As the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" id="w">Allies</a> prepared for the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Normandy" id="w">liberation of Europe</a> in May and June that year, Wiesel and his family, along with 15,000 other Jews from Sighet, and 18,000 from neighboring villages, were being deported by the Germans to Auschwitz.<sup id="_ref-Fine5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fine5" title="">[12]</a></sup> His mother and his youngest sister were immediately sent to the <a href="/wiki/Gas_chamber#Nazi Germany" id="w">gas chambers</a>. Hilda and Beatrice survived, separated from the rest of the family. Wiesel and his father managed to stay together, surviving hard labor and a <a href="/wiki/Death_marches_(Holocaust)" id="w">long march</a> in the snow to Buchenwald, where Wiesel watched his father die, just weeks before the Allies liberated the camp.</p>

<p><i>Night<b>s narrator is Eliezer, a studious and deeply pious <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism" id="w">Orthodox</a> <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jewish</a> teenager, who studies the <a href="/wiki/Talmud" id="w">Talmud</a> by day, and at night runs to the synagogue to &#34;weep over the <a href="/wiki/Tisha_B%26%2339%3BAv#The destructions" id="w">destruction</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem" id="w">Temple</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-N14_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N14" title="">[14]</a></sup> In the synagogue, Moshe the Beadle and Eliezer talk about the <a href="/wiki/Kabbalah" id="w">Kabbalah</a> and the mysteries of the universe, Moshe teaching him that &#34;man raises himself toward God by the questions he asks Him,&#34; and that &#34;every question possess[es] a power that [does] not lie in the answer.&#34;<sup id="_ref-N2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N2" title="">[13]</a></sup><i>Night</i> returns repeatedly to this theme of a spiritual <a href="/wiki/Faith" id="w">faith</a> sustained, not by answers, but by questions.</b></i></p>
<p>When the Hungarian government rules that Jews unable to prove their citizenship will be expelled, Moshe is crammed onto a cattle train and taken to <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a>. Somehow he manages to escape, miraculously saved by God, he believes, in order that he in turn might save the Jews of Sighet. He hurries back to the village to tell what he calls &#34;the story of my own death.&#34;<sup id="_ref-N17_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N17" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p /><blockquote>There was no longer any joy in his eyes. He no longer sang. He no longer talked to me of God or the <a href="/wiki/Kabbalah" id="w">Kabbalah</a>, but only of what he had seen. People refused not only to believe his stories, but even to listen to him.<sup id="_ref-N4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N4" title="">[16]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Moshe runs from one Jewish household to the next. &#34;<i>Jews, listen to me! It&#39;s all I ask of you. No money. No pity. Just listen to me!</i>&#34;<sup id="_ref-N17_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N17" title="">[15]</a></sup> The cattle train crossed the border into Poland, he tells them, where it was taken over by the <a href="/wiki/Gestapo" id="w">Gestapo</a>, the German secret police. The Jews were transferred to lorries and driven to the forest in <a href="/wiki/Galicia_(Central_Europe)" id="w">Galicia</a>, near Kolomaye, where they were forced to dig pits. When they had finished, each prisoner had to approach the hole, present his neck, and was shot. Babies were thrown into the air and used as targets by machine gunners. Moshe tells them about Malka, the young girl who took three days to die, and Tobias, the tailor who begged to be killed before his sons; and how he, Moshe, was shot in the leg and taken for dead. But the Jews of Sighet would not listen.</p>
<p /><blockquote><i>He&#39;s just trying to make us pity him. What an imagination he has!</i> they said. Or even: <i>Poor fellow. He&#39;s gone mad.</i>
<p>
And as for Moshe, he wept.<sup id="_ref-N4_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N4" title="">[16]</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Over the next 18 months, restrictions on Jews gradually increase. No valuables are to be kept in Jewish homes. They are not allowed to visit restaurants, attend the synagogue, or leave home after six in the evening. They must wear the <a href="/wiki/Yellow_badge#Used by the Nazis" id="w">yellow star</a> at all times. Eliezer&#39;s father makes light of it:

<p>An order is then received from the <a href="/wiki/Schutzstaffel" id="w">SS</a> that all the Jews in Sighet are to be transferred to one of two <a href="/wiki/Ghetto#Second World War" id="w">ghettos</a>, which are jointly run like a small town, each with its own council or <i><a href="/wiki/Judenrat" id="w">Judenrat</a></i>.</p>
<p /><blockquote>The barbed wire which fenced us in did not cause us any real fear. We even thought ourselves rather well off; we were entirely self-contained. A little Jewish republic ...

<p>In May 1944, the <i>Judenrat</i> is informed that the ghetto will be closed with immediate effect, and its residents deported.

<p>The remainder of <i>Night</i> describes Eliezer&#39;s initial, desperate efforts not to be parted from his father, not even to lose sight of him; his grief and shame at witnessing his father&#39;s decline into helplessness; and as their relationship changes and the young man becomes the older man&#39;s caregiver, his resentment and guilt, because he fears that his father&#39;s existence threatens his own. The stronger Eliezer&#39;s instinct for physical survival becomes, the weaker grow the bonds that tie him to other people. </p>
<p>His loss of faith in human relationships is mirrored in his loss of faith in God, who remains silent. During the first night in Auschwitz, he and his father wait in line to be thrown into a firepit. He watches a lorry draw up beside the pit and deliver its load of children into the fire.

</p><blockquote>Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.<br/>
<p>Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.<br/>
Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.<sup id="_ref-N32_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N32" title="">[26]</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Ellen Fine writes that this passage summarizes all the themes of <i>Night</i>: the death of God, children, innocence, self. With the loss of his sense of self, Eliezer also loses his sense of time.<sup id="_ref-Fine15_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fine15" title="">[27]</a></sup> This <i>défaite du moi</i>, dissolution of the self, is a recurring theme in Holocaust literature, writes Fine.<sup id="_ref-Fine16_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fine16" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p /><blockquote>I glanced at my father. How he had changed! ... The night was gone. So much had happened within such a few hours that I had lost all sense of time. When had we left our houses? And the ghetto? And the train?  Was it only a week? One night &#8212; <i>one single night</i>?<sup id="_ref-N34_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N34" title="">[24]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>God is not lost to Eliezer entirely. Later, during the hanging of a child, which the camp is forced to watch, he hears someone in the crowd ask: <i>Where is God? Where is he?</i> Not heavy enough for the weight of his body to break his neck, the boy dies slowly and in agony, &#34;struggling between life and death.&#34; Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink and his eyes still clear, and weeps.</p>
<p /><blockquote>Behind me, I heard the same man asking: <i>Where is God now?</i><br/>
<p>And I heard a voice within me answer him: <i>... Here He is &#8211; He is hanging here on this gallows</i>.<sup id="_ref-N61_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N61" title="">[29]</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Fine writes that this is the central event in <i>Night</i>, evoking the imagery of a religious sacrifice, <a href="/wiki/Isaac" id="w">Isaac</a> bound to the altar or <a href="/wiki/Jesus" id="w">Jesus</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Crucifixion" id="w">cross</a>.<sup id="_ref-Fine28_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fine28" title="">[30]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Kazin" id="w">Alfred Kazin</a> wrote of the scene that it has &#34;made this book famous ...

<p /><blockquote>Blessed be God&#39;s name? Why, but why would I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused thousands of children to burn in His mass graves? Because He kept six <a href="/wiki/Crematorium" id="w">crematoria</a> working day and night, including <a href="/wiki/Shabbat" id="w">Sabbath</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_holiday" id="w">Holy Days</a>?

<a id="Death_march" name="Death_march"></a><h2>Death march</h2>
<p>In or around August 1944, Eliezer and Shlomo are transferred from Auschwitz II-Birkenau to <a href="/wiki/Monowice" id="w">Auschwitz III</a>, the work camp at Buna-Monowitz, their lives reduced to the avoidance of violence and the constant search for food. &#34;Bread, soup &#8212; these were my whole life. I was a body. Perhaps less than that even: a starved stomach.&#34;<sup id="_ref-N50_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N50" title="">[32]</a></sup> The only time they experience joy is when the Americans bomb the camp. &#34;[W]e were no longer afraid of death; at any rate, not of that death. Every bomb that exploded filled us with joy and gave us new confidence in life.&#34;<sup id="_ref-N57_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N57" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>In January 1945, with the Soviet army approaching, the Germans decide to flee the camp, taking around 60,000 inmates, mostly Jews, to camps in Germany, on what becomes known as the <a href="/wiki/Death_marches_(Holocaust)" id="w">death marches</a>, shooting anyone too weak to continue. Eliezer and Shlomo march to <a href="/wiki/Gliwice" id="w">Gleiwitz</a> to be put on a freight train to <a href="/wiki/Buchenwald" id="w">Buchenwald</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Weimar" id="w">Weimar</a>.</p>
<p /><blockquote>An icy wind blew in violent gusts. But we marched without faltering.<br/>
<p>Pitch darkness. Every now and then, an explosion in the night. They had orders to fire on any who could not keep up. Their fingers on the triggers, they did not deprive themselves of this pleasure. If one of us had stopped for a second, a sharp shot finished off another filthy son of a bitch.<br/>
Near me, men were collapsing in the dirty snow. Shots.<sup id="_ref-N81_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N81" title="">[34]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Taking rest in a shed after marching 50 miles, Rabbi Eliahou asks if anyone has seen his son. They had stuck together for three years, &#34;always near each other, for suffering, for blows, for the ration of bread, for prayer,&#34; but the rabbi lost sight of him in the crowd and is now scratching through the snow looking for his son&#39;s corpse. &#34;<i>I hadn&#39;t any strength left for running. And my son didn&#39;t notice. That&#39;s all I know</i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-N86_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N86" title="">[35]</a></sup> Wiesel doesn&#39;t tell Rabbi Eliahou that the son had noticed the <a href="/wiki/Rabbi" id="w">rabbi</a> limping, and had run faster, letting the distance between them grow.</p>
<p /><blockquote>A terrible thought loomed up in my mind: he had wanted to get rid of his weak father! ... [He] had sought this separation in order to get rid of the burden, to free himself from an encumbrance ... And, in spite of myself, a prayer rose in my heart, to that God in whom I no longer believed. My God, Lord of the Universe, give me strength never to do what Rabbi Eliahou&#39;s son has done.<sup id="_ref-N87_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N87" title="">[36]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>The inmates march as far as Gleiwitz, where they spend two days and nights locked inside cramped barracks without food, water, or heat, literally sleeping on top of one another, so that every morning the living wake up on top of corpses. Then there is more marching to the train station and onto a cattle wagon with no roof, and no room to sit or lie down until the other inmates make space by throwing the dead onto the tracks. They travel for ten days and nights, still with no food, and with only the snow falling on them for water. Of the 100 Jews in Wiesel&#39;s wagon, 12 survive the journey.</p>
<p /><blockquote>I woke from my apathy just at the moment when two men came up to my father. I threw myself on top of his body. He was cold. I slapped him. I rubbed his hand, crying:<br/>
<p><i>Father! Father! Wake up. They&#39;re trying to throw you out of the carriage ...</i><br/>
His body remained inert ...<br/>
I set to work to slap him as hard as I could. After a moment, my father&#39;s eyelids moved slightly over his glazed eyes. He was breathing weakly.<br/>
<i>You see</i>, I cried.<br/>
The two men moved away.<sup id="_ref-N94_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N94" title="">[37]</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<a id="Buchenwald" name="Buchenwald"></a><h2>Buchenwald</h2>
<p>The Germans are waiting for the new inmates with loudhailers and orders to head straight for a hot bath. Wiesel is desperate for the heat of the water, but his father sinks into the snow, unable to move.</p>
<p /><blockquote>I could have wept with rage. Having lived through so much, suffered so much, could I leave my father to die now? Now, when we could have a good hot bath and lie down? ... He had become like a child, weak, timid, vulnerable ... I showed him the corpses all around him; they too had wanted to rest here ... I yelled against the wind ... I felt I was not arguing with him, but with death itself, with the death he had already chosen.<sup id="_ref-N100_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N100" title="">[38]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>An alert sounds, the camp lights goes out, and Eliezer, exhausted, follows the crowd to the barracks, leaving his father behind. He wakes at dawn on a wooden bunk, remembering that he has a father, and goes in search of him.</p>
<p /><blockquote>But at that same moment this thought came into my mind. <i>Don&#39;t let me find him! If only I could get rid of this dead weight, so that I could use all my strength to struggle for my own survival, and only worry about myself.</i> Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.<sup id="_ref-N101_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N101" title="">[7]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>His father is in another block, sick with <a href="/wiki/Dysentery" id="w">dysentery</a>. The other men in the bunk, a <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">Frenchman</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Pole</a>, attack Shlomo because he can no longer go outside to relieve himself. Eliezer is unable to protect him. &#34;Another wound to the heart, another hate, another reason for living lost.&#34;<sup id="_ref-N104_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N104" title="">[39]</a></sup> Begging for water one night from his bunk, where he has lain for a week, Shlomo is beaten by an <a href="/wiki/Schutzstaffel" id="w">SS</a> officer on the head with a <a href="/wiki/Truncheon" id="w">truncheon</a> for making too much noise. Eliezer lies in the bunk above and does nothing.</p>
<p /><blockquote>I did not move. I was afraid. My body was afraid of also receiving a blow. Then my father made a rattling noise and it was my name: <i>Eliezer</i>.<sup id="_ref-N106_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-N106" title="">[40]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>
I did not weep, and it pained me that I could not weep. But I had no more tears.

Eliezer&#39;s father missed his freedom by only a few weeks.

<p>He writes that, for ten years, he kept his story to himself, refusing even to discuss it. In 1979, he wrote: &#34;So heavy was my anguish that I made a vow: not to speak, not to touch upon the essential for at least ten years. Long enough to see clearly. Long enough to learn to listen to the voices crying inside my own. Long enough to regain possession of my memory.

<p>By the end of the journey, Wiesel had an 862-page manuscript that he called <i>Un di Velt Hot Geshvign</i> (<i>And the World Remained Silent</i>).<sup id="_ref-rivers319_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rivers319" title="">[44]</a></sup> On the ship, he was introduced by friends to Mark Turkov, a publisher of Yiddish texts, and he writes in his memoir that he gave Turkov the only copy of his precious manuscript.<sup id="_ref-rivers241_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rivers241" title="">[45]</a></sup> It was published as a 245-page volume the same year in <a href="/wiki/Buenos_Aires" id="w">Buenos Aires</a>, the 117th book in a series of Yiddish memoirs of Europe and the war, called <i>Dos poylishe yidntum</i> (Polish Jewry). Whereas the other books in the series were testimonials to the victims, Ruth Wisse writes in <i>The Modern Jewish Canon</i> that <i>Night</i> stood out as a &#34;highly selective and isolating literary narrative&#34; influenced by Wiesel&#39;s reading of the French <a href="/wiki/Existentialism" id="w">existentialists</a>.<sup id="_ref-Franklin_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The book attracted no literary interest and Wiesel continued with his journalism. In May 1955, he decided to interview the French prime minister, <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Mendes-France" id="w">Pierre Mendes-France</a>, and approached the novelist and <a href="/wiki/Nobel_laureate" id="w">Nobel laureate</a> <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mauriac" id="w">François Mauriac</a>, a friend of the prime minister, for an introduction.</p>
<p /><blockquote>The problem was that [Mauriac] was in love with <a href="/wiki/Jesus" id="w">Jesus</a>. He was the most decent person I ever met in that field &#8212; as a writer, as a <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism" id="w">Catholic</a> writer. Honest, sense of integrity, and he was in love with Jesus. He spoke only of Jesus. Whatever I would ask &#8212; Jesus. Finally, I said, &#34;What about Mendès-France?&#34; He said that Mendès-France, like Jesus, was suffering ...
<p>
When he said Jesus again I couldn&#39;t take it, and for the only time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day. I said, &#34;Mr. Mauriac,&#34; we called him Maître, &#34;ten years or so ago, I have seen children, hundreds of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it.&#34; I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping. I have rarely seen an old man weep like that, and I felt like such an idiot ... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, &#34;You know, maybe you should talk about it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-academy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-academy" title="">[46]</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Wiesel writes in his memoir that he translated <i>Un di Velt Hot Geshvign</i>, and sent Mauriac the new manuscript within a year. Even with Mauriac&#39;s connections, no publisher could be found at first. They said it was too morbid, that no one would read it. &#34;Nobody wants to hear these stories,&#34; they told Wiesel.<sup id="_ref-academy_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-academy" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1958, Jerome Linden of <i>Les Editions de Minuit</i>, agreed to release a 178-page French translation retitled <i>La Nuit</i>, dedicated to Shlomo, Sarah, and Tzipora, with a preface by Mauriac,<sup id="_ref-rivers319_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rivers319" title="">[44]</a></sup> and then the same difficulty was encountered again finding an American publisher. According to Wiesel: &#34;Some thought the book too slender (American readers seemed to prefer fatter volumes), others too depressing (American readers seemed to prefer optimistic books). Some felt that its subject was too little known, others that it was too well known.&#34;<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>

It sold just 1,046 copies over the next 18 months, but attracted interest from reviewers, leading to television interviews with Wiesel and meetings with literary figures like <a href="/wiki/Saul_Bellow" id="w">Saul Bellow</a>. &#34;The English translation came out in 1960, and the first printing was 3,000 copies,&#34; Wiesel said in an interview. &#34;And it took three years to sell them.

Gary Weissman of <a href="/wiki/East_Carolina_University" id="w">East Carolina University</a> writes in <i>Fantasies of Witnessing: Postwar Efforts to Experience the Holocaust</i> that <i>Night</i> has been called a &#34;novel/autobiography,&#34; an &#34;autobiographical novel,&#34; a &#34;non-fictional novel,&#34; a &#34;semi-fictional memoir,&#34; a &#34;fictional-autobiographical novel,&#34; a &#34;fictionalized  autobiographical memoir,&#34; and a &#34;memoir-novel.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Weissman65_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weissman65" title="">[49]</a></sup> Weissman argues that <i>Night</i> is regarded as defying all categories, and notes Irving Abrahamson&#39;s introduction to the latter&#39;s collection of Wiesel&#39;s work: &#34;Night is an unprecedented book, the beginning of something new in literature, if not in religion.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Weissman67_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weissman67" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mauriac" id="w">François Mauriac</a> wrote in the foreword to the first French edition that <i>Night</i> is &#34;different, distinct, unique ... a book to which no other could be compared.&#34; When the first American edition was published, A. Alverez wrote in <i>Commentary</i> that it was &#34;almost unbearably painful, and certainly beyond criticism.&#34;<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ruth Franklin argues that the book&#39;s impact stems from its construction, which she calls &#34;exquisite.&#34; Its language is plain, but &#34;every sentence feels weighted and deliberate, every episode carefully chosen and delineated. It is also shockingly brief; it can be read in an hour, and carried in a pocket. One has the sense of merciless experience mercilessly distilled to its essence ... To read it is to lose one&#39;s own innocence about the Holocaust all over again.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Franklin_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The simplicity and power of the narrative has come at the cost of literal truth, writes Franklin. The Yiddish version was more of a historical work than a literary one, and it was political and angry. Wiesel blamed the Jewish concept of <a href="/wiki/Jews_as_a_chosen_people" id="w">chosenness</a> as the source of the Jews&#39; troubles,<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> and complained bitterly about how quickly the world had forgotten the Holocaust. &#34;Today, Germany is a sovereign state. The German army has been resuscitated ... War criminals stroll through the streets of <a href="/wiki/Hamburg" id="w">Hamburg</a> and <a href="/wiki/Munich" id="w">Munich</a> ... [T]here are anti-Semites in Germany, France, and even the United States who tell the world that the &#39;story&#39; of six million assassinated Jews is nothing but a <a href="/wiki/Holocaust_denial" id="w">hoax</a> ...&#34;<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p>In preparation for publication in France, Wiesel and his publisher pruned everything that was not entirely necessary, and Franklin writes that it was a work of art that emerged, rather than a faithful narrative.<sup id="_ref-Franklin_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Naomi Seidman, professor of Jewish Culture at the <a href="/wiki/Graduate_Theological_Union" id="w">Graduate Theological Union</a> in Berkeley, wrote a comparative analysis of the Yiddish and French texts for a 1996 article in <i>Jewish Social Studies</i>. She documented the transition from a historical account of events to what she sees as an autobiographical novel, concluding that <i>Night</i> transforms the Holocaust into a &#34;religious <a href="/wiki/Theology" id="w">theological</a>&#34; event. She writes that &#34;[i]n the aftermath of God&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Abdication" id="w">abdication</a>, the site and occasion of this abdication &#8212; &#34;the Holocaust&#34; &#8212; takes on theological significance, and the witness becomes both <a href="/wiki/Priest" id="w">priest</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prophet" id="w">prophet</a> of this new religion,&#34; quoting Wiesel, who has said that &#34;Auschwitz is as important as <a href="/wiki/Biblical_Mount_Sinai" id="w">Sinai</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Seidman_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seidman" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Seidman concludes that there was not one Holocaust survivor in <i>Night</i>, but two, &#34;a Yiddish and a French,&#34; a view that <a href="/wiki/Holocaust_denial" id="w">Holocaust deniers</a> have exploited to imply that Wiesel has not been truthful about some of the scenes,<sup id="_ref-Franklin_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[4]</a></sup> and which led to Seidman herself being accused of Holocaust revisionism in letters to the editor.<sup id="_ref-Manseau_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Manseau" title="">[57]</a></sup> Seidman told the <i><a href="/wiki/The_Forward" id="w">Jewish Daily Forward</a></i> that, in re-writing, rather than simply translating <i>Un di Velt Hot Geshvign</i> for publication in France, Wiesel had replaced an &#34;angry survivor&#34; who regards &#34;testimony as a refutation of what the Nazis did to the Jews,&#34; with one who is &#34;haunted by death, whose primary complaint is directed against God, not the world, [or] the Nazis.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Manseau_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Manseau" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>Seidman supports her thesis that the Yiddish and French versions are two books written for different audiences by comparing the parts of the text that survived the editing process, and pointing out what she sees as significant differences. For example, in the Yiddish, Wiesel writes that, after liberation, some of the camp survivors, the &#34;Jewish boys,&#34; run off to &#34;<i>fargvaldikn daytshe shikses&#34;</i> (&#34;<a href="/wiki/Rape" id="w">rape</a> German <a href="/wiki/Shiksa" id="w">shiksas</a>&#34;), whereas in the French, they are just &#34;young men&#34; who go &#34;<i>coucher aves les filles</i>&#34; (&#34;to sleep with girls&#34;).<sup id="_ref-Seidman_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seidman" title="">[3]</a></sup> Seidman argues that the Yiddish version is for the Jewish readers, who want to hear about Jewish boys taking revenge by raping German <a href="/wiki/Gentile" id="w">non-Jews</a>. For the rest of the world &#8212; the largely <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christian</a> readership &#8212; the anger is removed, and they are simply young men sleeping with girls.<sup id="_ref-Seidman_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seidman" title="">[3]</a></sup> Seidman writes that Wiesel, perhaps taking advice from <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mauriac" id="w">François Mauriac</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism" id="w">Roman Catholic</a>, deliberately suppressed what his Jewish readership wanted to read about: the need for <a href="/wiki/Vengeance" id="w">vengeance</a>. She asks: &#34;Was it worth translating the Holocaust out of the language of the largest portion of its victims and into the language of those who were, at best, absent, and at worst, complicitous in the <a href="/wiki/Genocide" id="w">genocide</a>?&#34;<sup id="_ref-Seidman_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seidman" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="When_the_original_version_was_written" name="When_the_original_version_was_written"></a><h2>When the original version was written</h2>
<p>There is also confusion as to when the first version was written. Werner Kelber of <a href="/wiki/Rice_University" id="w">Rice University</a> writes that how the text originated speaks directly to the question of whether <i>Night</i> is a <i>cri de coeur</i>, a &#34;primal, authorial outcry following a decade of silence,&#34; as Wiesel has at times presented it, or a &#34;literarily mediated&#34; text with an &#34;elaborate compositional, editorial and translational history.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Kelber_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kelber" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wiesel has implied in interviews that it was his May 1955 meeting with Mauriac that first propelled him to break his vow of silence. In an interview published by the <a href="/wiki/American_Academy_of_Achievement" id="w">American Academy of Achievement</a>, he said: &#34;[Mauriac] took me to the elevator and embraced me. And that year, the tenth year, I began writing my narrative. After it was translated from Yiddish into French, I sent it to him. We were very, very close friends until his death. That made me not publish, but write.&#34;<sup id="_ref-academy_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-academy" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, as Naomi Seidman notes, and as Wiesel himself writes in <i>All Rivers Run to the Sea</i>,<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> Mark Turkov, the publisher in Argentina, had been given the Yiddish manuscript in 1954 &#8212; one year before Wiesel&#39;s meeting with Mauriac.<sup id="_ref-Seidman_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seidman" title="">[3]</a></sup> In <i>Rivers</i>, Wiesel writes that the first version of <i>Night</i> was written on a boat <i>en route</i> to Brazil in 1954, and that he handed the original 862-page manuscript to Turkov. Although Turkov promised he would return the original manuscript, Wiesel writes that he didn&#39;t see it again, but later in <i>Rivers</i>, he explains that he &#34;cut down the original manuscript from 862 pages to the 245 of the published Yiddish edition.&#34;<sup id="_ref-rivers319_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rivers319" title="">[44]</a></sup> Seidman writes that &#34;[t]hese confusing and possibly contradictory reports on the various versions of <i>Night</i> have generated a chain of similarly confusing critical comments.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Seidman_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seidman" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Ruth Franklin writes that <i>Night&#39;s</i> &#34;resuscitation&#34; by <a href="/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey" id="w">Oprah Winfrey</a> came at a difficult time for the genre of memoir, after a previous <a href="/wiki/Oprah%26%2339%3Bs_Book_Club" id="w">Oprah&#39;s Book Club</a> author, <a href="/wiki/James_Frey" id="w">James Frey</a>, was found to have fabricated parts of his autobiography, <i>A Million Little Pieces</i>. She argues that Winfrey&#39;s endorsement of Wiesel&#39;s work was a &#34;canny move,&#34; perhaps designed to restore the book club&#39;s credibility with a book regarded as &#34;beyond criticism.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Franklin_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Night</i> has a useful lesson to teach, writes Franklin, about the &#34;complexities of memoir and memory.&#34; The story of how it came to  be written &#34;reveals just how many factors come into play in the <a href="/wiki/Narrative_paradigm" id="w">creation of a memoir</a> &#8212; the obligation to remember and to testify, certainly, but also the artistic and even moral obligation to construct a credible <a href="/wiki/Persona" id="w">persona</a> and to craft a beautiful work. Fact, we know, can be stranger than fiction; but truth in prose, it turns out, is not always the same thing as truth in life.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Franklin_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wiesel tells a story about a visit to a <a href="/wiki/Rebbe" id="w">Rebbe</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism" id="w">Hasidic</a> <a href="/wiki/Rabbi" id="w">rabbi</a>, he hadn&#39;t seen for 20 years. The Rebbe is upset to learn that Wiesel has become a writer, and wants to know what kind of material he writes. &#34;Stories,&#34; Wiesel replies, &#34;... true stories.&#34;</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><blockquote>&#34;About people you knew?&#34; Yes, about people I might have known. &#34;About things that happened?&#34; Yes, about things that happened or could have happened. &#34;But they did not?&#34; No, not all of them did. In fact, some were invented from almost the beginning to almost the end. The Rebbe leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger: &#34;That means you are writing lies!&#34; I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defense. Yet, I had to justify myself: &#34;Things are not that simple, Rebbe. Some events do take place but are not true; others are, although they never occurred.<sup id="_ref-Weissman68_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Weissman68" title="">[60]</a></sup></blockquote></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
