<p><b><i>X-Men 2099</i></b> is a <a href="/wiki/Comic_book" id="w">comic book</a> published by <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Comics" id="w">Marvel</a> from 1993 to 1996 that explores the possibility of what a team of <a href="/wiki/X-Men" id="w">X-Men</a> would be like in the year <a href="/wiki/2099" id="w">2099</a>. It extends the <a href="/wiki/Marvel_2099" id="w">Marvel 2099</a> <a href="/wiki/Imprint" id="w">imprint</a>, which features other future versions of popular <a href="/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Comics_characters" id="w">Marvel characters</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Spider-Man_2099" id="w">Spider-Man 2099</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hulk_2099" id="w">Hulk 2099</a>. The series was written by <a href="/wiki/John_Francis_Moore_(comics)" id="w">John Francis Moore</a>, and largely pencilled by <a href="/wiki/Ron_Lim" id="w">Ron Lim</a>.</p>
<p>The series began in October 1993 and lasted 35 issues along with two specials. It spawned a line of <a href="/wiki/Action_figure" id="w">action figures</a>, mostly featuring the more popular characters in the book, and the planned <a href="/wiki/Spin-off" id="w">spin-off</a> <i><a href="/wiki/X-Nation_2099" id="w">X-Nation 2099</a></i>. In issue 20, the title received a minor makeover, officially joining the <a href="/wiki/Marvel_2099" id="w">2099 imprint</a> and changing its name to <i>X-Men 2099 A.D.</i>, the A.D. standing for “After <a href="/wiki/Doom_2099" id="w">Doom</a>.” At the series&#39; end, it was folded into <i><a href="/wiki/2099:_World_of_Tomorrow" id="w">2099: World of Tomorrow</a></i>, though members of the team were rarely seen after this point.</p>
<p>The first issue featured a blue foil cover on cardstock and the double-sized 25th issue&#39;s cover was extra-glossy with foil letters, metallic silver ink, and embossed characters on a heavier wraparound cover.</p>
