<p>The <b>evacuation of <a href="/wiki/East_Prussia" id="w">East Prussia</a></b> refers to the evacuation of the <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_German" id="w">German</a> civilian population and military personnel in East Prussia and the <a href="/wiki/Klaip%C4%97da_region" id="w">Klaipėda region</a> between <a href="/wiki/20_January" id="w">20 January</a>, and March <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>, as part of the <a href="/wiki/Evacuation_of_German_civilians_during_the_end_of_World_War_II" id="w">Evacuation of German civilians</a> towards the end of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>. It is not to be confused with the <a href="/wiki/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II" id="w">Expulsion</a> after the war had ended, under Soviet occupation.</p>
<p>The evacuation, which had been delayed for months, was initiated due to fear of the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a> advances during the <a href="/wiki/East_Prussian_Offensive" id="w">East Prussian Offensive</a>. Some parts of the evacuation were planned as a military necessity, <a href="/wiki/Operation_Hannibal" id="w">Operation Hannibal</a> being the most important military operation involved in the evacuation. However, many refugees took to the roads on their own because of reported <a href="/wiki/Soviet" id="w">Soviet</a> atrocities against Germans in the areas under Soviet control. Allegations of Soviet atrocities were disseminated not only through the official news and <a href="/wiki/Nazi_propaganda" id="w">propaganda</a> outlets of the <a href="/wiki/Third_Reich" id="w">Third Reich</a>, but also by rumors that swept through the military and civilian population.</p>
<p>Despite having detailed evacuation plans for some areas, authorities of the Third Reich, including the <a href="/wiki/Gauleiter" id="w">Gauleiter</a> of East Prussia, <a href="/wiki/Erich_Koch" id="w">Erich Koch</a>, delayed action until <a href="/wiki/January_20" id="w">January 20</a>, when it was too late for an orderly evacuation, and the civil services were eventually overwhelmed by the huge number of those wishing to evacuate. Coupled with the panic caused by the speed of the Soviet advance, civilians caught in the middle of combat, and the bitter winter weather, many thousands of refugees died during the evacuation period.</p>
<p>The Soviets took complete control of East Prussia in May 1945. Most of the German civil population managed to evacuate, though about 300,000 were killed during the Soviet offensive. However, there were still 193,000 Germans in East Prussia after the end of the war, though some were later <a href="/wiki/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II" id="w">expelled</a> by the Soviet authorities. The census made by the Soviets in 1950 indicated an ethnic German population in East Prussia of 164,000.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

The <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet</a> army initiated an offensive into <a href="/wiki/East_Prussia" id="w">East Prussia</a> in October <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>, but it was temporarily driven back two weeks later. After that, the <a href="/wiki/Propagandaministerium" id="w">German Ministry of Propaganda</a> reported that <a href="/wiki/War_crime" id="w">war crimes</a> had taken place in East Prussian villages, in particular in <a href="/wiki/Nemmersdorf_massacre" id="w">Nemmersdorf</a>, where (according to the Ministry) inhabitants had been raped and killed by the advancing Soviets.<sup id="_ref-Beevor-3-4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Beevor-3-4" title="">[2]</a></sup> Since the Nazi war effort had largely stripped the civil population of able-bodied men for service in the military, the victims of the atrocity were primarily old men, women, and children. Upon the Soviet withdrawal from the area, German authorities sent in film crews to document what had happened, and invited observers as further witnesses. A documentary film from the footage obtained during this effort was put together and shown in cinemas in East Prussia, with the intention of hardening civilian and military resolve in resisting the Soviets. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Nazi propaganda about the atrocities at Nemmersdorf, as well as on other crimes committed in East Prussia, convinced the remaining civilians that they should not get caught by the advancing enemy.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

Murders of Axis <a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war" id="w">prisoners of war</a> and German civilians are known from cases at Soviet military tribunals. Also, when Soviet troops moved into East Prussia, large numbers of enslaved <i><a href="/wiki/Ostarbeiter" id="w">Ostarbeiter</a></i> (&#34;Eastern workers&#34;) were freed, and knowledge of the suffering and deaths of many of these workers hardened the attitude of many Soviet soldiers towards East Prussians. <sup id="_ref-Beevor-75-82_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Beevor-75-82" title="">[6]</a></sup>

<p>The evacuation plans for parts of <a href="/wiki/East_Prussia" id="w">East Prussia</a> were ready in the second half of 1944.

<p>Initially, <a href="/wiki/Erich_Koch" id="w">Erich Koch</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Gauleiter" id="w">Gauleiter</a> of East Prussia, did not agree with the evacuation of the civilians (until <a href="/wiki/20_January" id="w">20 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>), and ordered that civilians trying to flee the region without permission, would be instantly shot. This did not, however, prevent Koch and many other Nazi functionaries from being among the first to flee during the Soviet advance. However, between <a href="/wiki/12_January" id="w">12 January</a> and mid-February 1945, almost 8.5 million Germans fled the Eastern provinces of the Reich.<sup id="_ref-Beevor-83_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Beevor-83" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Most of the refugees were women and children heading to the <a href="/wiki/Neisse" id="w">Neisse</a> region, southeast of <a href="/wiki/Berlin" id="w">Berlin</a>, carrying goods on improvised <a href="/wiki/Means_of_transport" id="w">means of transport</a>, such as wooden wagons and carts, as all the motorized vehicles and fuel were confiscated by the <a href="/wiki/Wehrmacht" id="w">Wehrmacht</a>.
