Plans to build a stadium in east Manchester were first formulated as part of the city&#39;s bid to host the <a href="/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics" id="w">2000 Summer Olympics</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Manchester_City_Council" id="w">Manchester City Council</a> commissioning a design for an 80,000 capacity stadium on a <a href="/wiki/Brownfield_land" id="w">brownfield</a> site known colloquially as <i>Eastlands</i>. However, in October 1993 the games were awarded to <a href="/wiki/Sydney" id="w">Sydney</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>. Manchester subsequently made a successful bid to host the <a href="/wiki/2002_Commonwealth_Games" id="w">2002 Commonwealth Games</a>, using the stadium plans from the Olympic bid. In 1996, the planned stadium competed with <a href="/wiki/Wembley_Stadium" id="w">Wembley Stadium</a> to gain funding to become the national stadium but the money was used to redevelop Wembley.
The stadium&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Foundation_stone" id="w">foundation stone</a> was laid by <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Tony_Blair" id="w">Tony Blair</a> in December 1999,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and construction began in January 2000.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The stadium was designed by <a href="/wiki/Arup" id="w">Arup</a> and constructed by <a href="/wiki/John_Laing_plc" id="w">John Laing</a> at a cost of approximately £110 million, £77 million of which was provided by <a href="/wiki/Sport_England" id="w">Sport England</a>, with the remainder funded by Manchester City Council.<sup id="_ref-legacy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-legacy" title="">[3]</a></sup> For the Commonwealth Games the stadium featured a single lower tier running around three sides of the <a href="/wiki/Athletics_(track_and_field)" id="w">athletics</a> track, and second tiers to the two sides, with an open-air temporary stand at one end. The first public event at the stadium was the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games on <a href="/wiki/25_July" id="w">25 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>. Among the dignitaries present at the ceremony was <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. During the ten days of competition, the stadium hosted all athletics events and the <a href="/wiki/Rugby_sevens" id="w">rugby sevens</a>. Four Commonwealth records were set at the stadium, including the women&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Triple_jump" id="w">triple jump</a> and the women&#39;s <a href="/wiki/5000_meters" id="w">5000&#160;m</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

 the Commonwealth Games, extensive work was carried out on the stadium to convert it for use as a football stadium. Following the success of athletics events at the Commonwealth Games, the decision to convert the stadium into a football venue received criticism from athletics figures such as <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(athlete)" id="w">Jonathan Edwards</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sebastian_Coe" id="w">Sebastian Coe</a>,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> but redevelopment was deemed necessary to give the venue a financially viable long-term future. The track was removed and relaid at other athletics venues, and the ground level was lowered to make way for an additional tier of seating. The temporary stand was dismantled, and replaced with a permanent structure of similar design to the opposite end. This extensive work took a year and added 12,000 seats. Manchester City F.C. moved to the new ground for the <a href="/wiki/FA_Premier_League_2003-04" id="w">2003–04 season</a>. The conversion cost £35 million, which was paid for by the football club.</p>
<p>The first football match at the stadium was a <a href="/wiki/Exhibition_game" id="w">friendly</a> between Manchester City and <a href="/wiki/FC_Barcelona" id="w">Barcelona</a> on <a href="/wiki/10_August" id="w">10 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>. Manchester City won the game 2-1, with the first <a href="/wiki/Football_pitch#Goals" id="w">goal</a> at the stadium scored by <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Anelka" id="w">Nicolas Anelka</a>. The first competitive match followed four days later, a <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Cup_2002-03" id="w">UEFA Cup</a> contest between Manchester City and <a href="/wiki/Football_in_Wales" id="w">Welsh</a> side <a href="/wiki/The_New_Saints_F.C." id="w">TNS</a>, which City won 5-0. The record football attendance at the stadium is 47,321, which was set at a Premier League game when Manchester City drew with <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_F.C." id="w">Liverpool F.C.</a> 0-0 on <a href="/wiki/30_December" id="w">30 December</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.</p>
<p>The stadium has also hosted several other sporting events. It became the 50th stadium to host an England international football match when <a href="/wiki/England_national_football_team" id="w">England</a> played <a href="/wiki/Japan_national_football_team" id="w">Japan</a> on <a href="/wiki/1_June" id="w">1 June</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, and on <a href="/wiki/30_October" id="w">30 October</a> of that year it played host to a <a href="/wiki/Rugby_league" id="w">rugby league</a> match between <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain_national_rugby_league_team" id="w">Great Britain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Australia_national_rugby_league_team" id="w">Australia</a> in the <a href="/wiki/2004_Rugby_League_Tri-Nations" id="w">Tri-Nations</a> series. In June 2005 the stadium hosted <a href="/wiki/England_women%26%2339%3Bs_national_football_team" id="w">England</a>&#39;s opening game in the <a href="/wiki/2005_UEFA_Women%26%2339%3Bs_Championship" id="w">UEFA Women&#39;s Championship</a>, setting an attendance record for the competition.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> It is rated as a 4 star stadium by <a href="/wiki/UEFA" id="w">UEFA</a>, and has been selected to host the 2008 <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Cup" id="w">UEFA Cup</a> Final.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>

<p>The stadium has a number of unofficial alternative names. <i>Eastlands</i> was used before the stadium was officially named and is still in common use, and <i>City of Manchester Stadium</i> is sometimes abbreviated to <i>COMS</i> when written. <i>The Blue Camp</i>, a pun on <a href="/wiki/FC_Barcelona" id="w">Barcelona</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Camp_Nou" id="w">Nou Camp</a>, found little favour.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The stadium has generally received positive feedback from fans, coming second behind <a href="/wiki/Old_Trafford_(football)" id="w">Old Trafford</a> in a 2005 poll to find the United Kingdom&#39;s favourite football ground.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> However, the atmosphere inside the stadium has sometimes faced criticism, with detractors regarding the atmosphere as inferior to that of Maine Road. But the atmosphere has improved as the seasons have gone by with the fans getting used to the stadium.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

 interior of the City of Manchester Stadium is a continuous oval bowl, with three tiers of seating at the sides, and two tiers at each end. While the seating is continuous, each side of the stadium has its own name in the manner of a traditional football ground. Initially, all sides of the stadium were named by compass direction (<i>North Stand</i> and <i>South Stand</i> for the ends, <i>East Stand</i> and <i>West Stand</i> for the sides). In February 2004 the West Stand was renamed the <i><a href="/wiki/Colin_Bell" id="w">Colin Bell</a> Stand</i> in honour of the former player.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The South Stand has been officially named the <i><a href="/wiki/Key_103" id="w">Key 103</a> Stand</i> for sponsorship reasons since 2003,<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> though this designation is largely ignored by supporters. A portion of the North Stand is designated the <i>Family Stand</i>, and is reserved for supporters with children. The East Stand is unofficially known as <i>the Kippax</i> after the corresponding stand at Maine Road. Supporters of visiting teams are allocated part of the South Stand. There are 68 <a href="/wiki/Luxury_box" id="w">executive boxes</a> around the stadium, located along the West, North and East Stands. The boxes on the East and West stands seat 10 people inside and outside, while the boxes on the North Stand seat 8 people inside and outside.

The stadium roof is <a href="/wiki/Toroid" id="w">toroidal</a> in shape, and is suspended from steel cables attached to eight towers, which also provide access to the upper tiers of seating via spiral ramps. The areas without seating in each corner have moveable <a href="/wiki/Louver" id="w">louvres</a>, to allow for ventilation of the <a href="/wiki/Football_pitch" id="w">pitch</a>. Entry is gained by <a href="/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification" id="w">RFID</a> smart card rather than the traditional manned <a href="/wiki/Turnstile" id="w">turnstile</a>. This system can admit up to 1,200 people per minute around all entrances.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> A service tunnel running under the stadium provides access for emergency vehicles, and allows the visiting team&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Coach_(vehicle)" id="w">coach</a> to enter the stadium directly. Inside the stadium are six <a href="/wiki/Theme_restaurant" id="w">themed restaurants</a>, two of which have views of the pitch, and a number of conference facilities.
