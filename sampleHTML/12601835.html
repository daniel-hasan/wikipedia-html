There are literary, archaeological, epigraphic and numismatic <b>sources of ancient Tamil history</b>. The foremost among these sources is the <a href="/wiki/Sangam_literature" id="w">Sangam literature</a>, generally dated to the last centuries BCE to early centuries CE. The poems in Sangam literature contain vivid descriptions of the different aspects of life and society in <a href="/wiki/Tamilakam" id="w">Tamilakam</a> during this age; scholars agree that, for the most part, these are reliable accounts. Greek and Roman literature, around the dawn of the <a href="/wiki/Christian_era" id="w">Christian era</a>, give details of the maritime trade between Tamilakam and the <a href="/wiki/Roman_empire" id="w">Roman empire</a>, including the names and locations of many ports on both coasts of the Tamil country. </p>
<p>Archaeological excavations of several sites in <a href="/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" id="w">Tamil Nadu</a> have yielded remnants from the Sangam era, such as different kinds of pottery, pottery with inscriptions, imported ceramic ware, industrial objects, brick structures and spinning whorls. Techniques such as <a href="/wiki/Stratigraphy" id="w">stratigraphy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paleography" id="w">paleography</a> have helped establish the date of these items to the Sangam era. The excavated artifacts have provided evidence for existence of different economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature such as agriculture, weaving, smithy, gem cutting, building construction, pearl fishing and painting.  </p>
<p>Inscriptions found on caves and pottery are another source for studying the history of Tamilakam. Writings in <a href="/wiki/Tamil-Brahmi" id="w">Tamil-Brahmi</a> script have been found in many locations in <a href="/wiki/Kerala" id="w">Kerala</a> and Tamil Nadu, mostly recording grants made by the kings and chieftains. References are also made to other aspects of the Sangam society. Coins issued by the Tamil kings of this age have been recovered from river beds and urban centers of their kingdoms. Most of the coins carry the emblem of the corresponding dynasty on their reverse, such as the bow and arrow of the <a href="/wiki/Chera_dynasty" id="w">Cheras</a>; some of them contain portraits and written legends helping numismatists assign them to a certain period.</p>

By far, the most important source of ancient Tamil history is the corpus of Tamil poems, referred to as <a href="/wiki/Sangam_literature" id="w">Sangam literature</a>, generally dated from the last centuries of the pre-Christian era to the early centuries of the Christian era.<sup id="_ref-subrahmanian_tamilsource_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-subrahmanian_tamilsource" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-sahitya_sangamdate_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sahitya_sangamdate" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-brittanica_age_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brittanica_age" title="">[3]</a></sup> It consists of 2381 known poems, with a total of over 50000 lines, written by 473 poets.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Each poem belongs to one of two types: <i>Akam</i> (inside) and <i>Puram</i> (outside). The <i>akam</i> poems deal with inner human emotions such as love and the <i>puram</i> poems deal with outer experiences such as society, culture and warfare. They contain descriptions of various aspects of life in the ancient Tamil country. The <i><a href="/wiki/Maduraikkanci" id="w">Maduraikkanci</a></i> by Mankudi Maruthanaar contains a full-length description of <a href="/wiki/Madurai" id="w">Madurai</a> and the Pandyan country under the rule of Nedunj Cheliyan III.<sup id="_ref-sastri2_maduraikanci_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sastri2_maduraikanci" title="">[6]</a></sup> The <i><a href="/wiki/Netunalvatai" id="w">Netunalvatai</a></i> by Nakkirar contains a description of the king’s palace. The <i><a href="/wiki/Purananuru" id="w">Purananuru</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Agananuru" id="w">Agananuru</a></i> collections contain poems sung in praise of various kings and also poems that were composed by the kings themselves. The Sangam age anthology <i><a href="/wiki/Pathirruppaththu" id="w">Pathirruppaththu</a></i> provides the genealogy of two collateral lines for three or four generations of the Cheras, along with describing the Chera country, in general. The poems in <i><a href="/wiki/Ainkurnuru" id="w">Ainkurnuru</a></i>, written by numerous authors, were compiled by Kudalur Kizhar at the instance of Chera King <i>Yanaikkatcey Mantaran Ceral Irumporai</i>.The Chera kings are also mentioned in other works such as  <i>Akananuru</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Kuruntokai" id="w">Kuruntokai</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Natrinai" id="w">Narrinai</a></i> and <i>Purananuru</i>.<sup id="_ref-krishnamurthy_cherasangam_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-krishnamurthy_cherasangam" title="">[7]</a></sup> The <i><a href="/wiki/Pattinappaalai" id="w">Pattinappaalai</a></i> describes the Chola port city of <a href="/wiki/Kaveripumpattinam" id="w">Kaveripumpattinam</a> in great detail.</p>
<p>The historical value of the Sangam poems has been critically analysed by scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries. Sivaraja Pillay, a 20th century historian, while constructing the genealogy of ancient Tamil kings from Sangam literature, insists that the Sangam poems show no similarities with ancient Puranic literature and medieval Tamil literature, both of which contain, according to him, fanciful myths and impossible legends. He feels that the Sangam literature is, for the most part, a plain unvarnished tale of the happenings of a by-gone age.<sup id="_ref-sivaraj_reliability_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sivaraj_reliability" title="">[8]</a></sup> Scholars like Dr. Venkata Subramanian,<sup id="_ref-venkatasubramanian_reliability_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-venkatasubramanian_reliability" title="">[9]</a></sup> Dr. N.

Pillay<sup id="_ref-jkpillay_reliability_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jkpillay_reliability" title="">[12]</a></sup> concur with this view. Noted historian K.A.N. Sastri dates the presently available Sangam corpus to the early centuries of the Christian Era. He asserts that the picture drawn by the poets is in obedience to literary tradition and must have been based on solid foundation in the facts of contemporary life; he proceeds to use the Sangam literature to describe the government, culture and society of the early Pandyan kingdom.<sup id="_ref-sastri_reliability_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sastri_reliability" title="">[13]</a></sup> Kanakalatha Mukund, while describing the mercantile history of Tamilakam, points out that the heroic poetry in Sangam literature often described an ideal world rather than reality, but the basic facts are reliable and an important source of Tamil history. Her reasoning is that they have been supported by archaeological and numismatic evidence and the fact that similar vivid descriptions are found in works by different poets.<sup id="_ref-mukund_reliability_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mukund_reliability" title="">[14]</a></sup> Dr. Husaini relies on Sangam literature to describe the early Pandyan society and justifies his source by saying that some of the poetical works contain really trustworthy accounts of early Pandyan kings and present facts as they occurred, though they never throw much light about the chronology of their rule.<sup id="_ref-husaini_reliability_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-husaini_reliability" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Among the critics of using Sangam literature for historical studies is Herman Tieken, who maintains that the Sangam poems were composed in the 8th or 9th century CE and that they attempt to describe a period much earlier than when they were written.<sup id="_ref-tiekenbook_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tiekenbook" title="">[16]</a></sup>

<a id="Archeological_sources" name="Archeological_sources"></a><h2>Archeological sources</h2>

<p>According to Abraham, the Sangam era corresponds roughly to the period 300 BCE - 300 CE, based on archaeology.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Many historical sites have been excavated in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, many of them in the second half of the 20th century. One of the most important archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu is Arikamedu, located 3 km south of Pondicherry. According to Wheeler, it was an Indo-Roman trading station that flourished during the first two centuries CE. It has been suggested that Arikamedu was first established as a settlement ca. 250 BCE and lasted until 200 CE.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> Kodumanal and Perur, villages on the banks of the Noyyal river in Coimbatore district, were situated on the ancient trade route between Karur and the west coast, across the Palghat gap on the Western Ghats. Both sites have yielded remains belonging to the Sangam age.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> Kaveripumpattinam, also known as Puhar or Poompuhar, is located near the Kaveri delta and played a vital role in the brisk maritime history of ancient Tamilakam. Excavations have been carried out both on-shore and off-shore at Puhar and the findings have brought to light the historicity of the region. The artefacts excavated date between 300 BCE and early centuries CE. Some of the off-shore findings indicate that parts of the ancient city may have submerged under the advancing sea, as alluded to by the Sangam literature.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> Korkai, a port of the Pandyas at the Tamraparani basin, is now located 7 km inland due to the retreating shoreline caused by sediment deposition. Alagankulam, near the Vaigai delta, was another port city of the Pandyas and an archaeological site that has been excavated in the recent years. Both the Pandyan ports have provided clues about local occupations, such as pearl fishing.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>  Other sites that have yielded remnants from the Sangam age include Kanchipuram, Kunnattur, Malayampattu and Vasavasamudram along the Palar river; Sengamedu and Karaikadu along the Pennar river; Perur, Tirukkampuliyur, Alagarai and Urayur along the Kaveri river.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup>
These excavations have yielded different varieties of ceramics such as black and red ware, rouletted ware and Russet coated ware, both locally made and imported kinds. Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Other artifacts such as brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items, remains of seeds and shells provide clues about the nature of the settlements and the other aspects of life during the Sangam age. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in the material records of Tamilakam are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup>
</p><a id="Evidence_for_economic_activities" name="Evidence_for_economic_activities"></a><h3>Evidence for economic activities</h3>

<p>Archeological evidence for agriculture in the Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping seems to have been undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil - this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found at the bottom of the reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>A research survey at Kodumanal has unearthed the remains of an ancient blast furnace, its circular base distinguishable by its white colour, probably the result of high temperature. Around the base, many iron slags, some with embedded burnt clay, vitrified brick-bats, many terracotta pipes with vitrified mouths and a granite slab, which may have been the anvil, have been recovered. Absence of potsherds and other antiquities has suggested that the smelting place was located outside the boundary of habitation. More furnaces were discovered at the same site with burnt clay pieces with rectangular holes. The pieces were part of the furnace wall, the holes designed to allow a natural draught of air to pass through evenly into the furnace. Many vitrified crucibles were also recovered from this site; one of them notable because it was found in an in situ position.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> Evidence of steel making is also found in the crucibles excavated at this site.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> In addition to iron and steel, the metallurgy seems to have possibly extended to copper, bronze, lead, silver and gold objects.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> At Arikamedu, there were indications of small-scale workshops containing the remains of working in metal, glass, semiprecious stones, ivory and shell.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> Kodumanal has yielded evidence for the practice of weaving, in the form of a number of intact terracotta spindle whorls pierced at the centre by means of an iron rod, indicating the knowledge of cotton spinning and weaving. To further strengthen this theory, a well preserved piece of woven cotton cloth was also recovered from this site.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Dyeing vats were spotted at Arikamedu.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many brick structures have been located at Kaveripumpattinam during on-shore, near shore and off-shore explorations; these provide proof for building construction during Sangam age. The on-shore structure include an I-shaped wharf and a structure that looks like a reservoir. The wharf has a number of wooden poles planted in its structure to enable anchorage of boats and to facilitate the handling of cargo. Among other structures, there is a Buddhist vihara with parts of it decorated using moulded bricks and stucco. Near shore excavations yielded a brick structure and a few terracotta ring wells. Off-shore explorations located a fifteen course brick structure, three courses of dressed stone blocks, brick bats and pottery.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> At Arikamedu, there were indications of a structure built substantially of timber, possibly a wharf. Conical jars that could have been used for storing wine and oil have been found near structures that could have been shops or storage areas. Evidence of continued building activity are present at this site, with the most distinctive structures being those of a possible warehouse, dyeing tanks and lined pits.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kodumanal was popular for the gem-cutting industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz are located in the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are remnants of many of the items imported from and exported to the Roman empire, at Arikamedu. Imported items recovered from here include ceramics such as amphorae and sherds of Arretine ware, glass bowls, Roman lamps, a crystal gem and an object resembling a stylus. Artifacts that may have been meant for export include jewellery, worked ivory, textiles and perhaps leather or leather-related products.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> Similar looking ornaments have been recovered from Arikamedu and Palatine Hill in Rome, further confirming that this site was a leading trade center.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> The Pandyan port city Alagankulam has yielded a rouletted pottery ware that bears the figure of a ship on the shoulder portion. This figure is very similar to a finding reported from Ostia, an ancient port of the Romans.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> Wharf-like structures found at many port cities indicate that they might have been used as docks. Based on marine explorations of various port-sites, it has been suggested that stone anchors may have been used since as early as 3rd century BCE.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Epigraphical_sources" name="Epigraphical_sources"></a><h2>Epigraphical sources</h2>

<p>During the later half of the 20th century, several inscriptions of the Sangam age have been discovered in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Most of them are written in Tamil-Brahmi script and are found in rocks or on pottery. The information obtained from such inscriptions have been used to corroborate some of the details provided by the Sangam literature.
</p><a id="Cave_inscriptions" name="Cave_inscriptions"></a><h3>Cave inscriptions</h3>
<p>The 2nd and 13th rock edicts of Asoka (273 - 232 BCE) refers to the Pandyas, Cholas, Cheras and the Satiyaputras. According to the edicts, these kingdoms lay outside the southern boundary of the Mauryan Empire. The Hathigumpha inscription of the Kalinga King, Kharavela, (c. 150 BCE) refers to the arrival of a tribute of jewels and elephants from the Pandyan king. It also talks about a league of Tamil kingdoms that had been in existence 113 years before then.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup>
The earliest epigraphic records of the Tamil country in Tamil Nadu were found in Mangulam village near Madurai. The cave inscriptions, deciphered in 1966, have been dated to 2nd century BC and record the gift of a monastery by Pandyan king Nedunj Cheliyan to a Jain monk. These inscriptions are also the oldest Jain inscriptions in South India and among the oldest in all of India.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> References to Sangam age Chera dynasty are found in Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions of 3rd century CE found on rocks in Edakal hill in Wynad district of Kerala.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> The ancient port city of Tondi is mentioned in inscriptions found in Kilavalavu village near Madurai.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> The early part of the 20th century saw the discovery of about 39 inscriptions in a dozen locations, all near Madurai. The most significant of these were the ones at Alagarmalai and Sittannavasal. The Alagarmalai inscriptions, dated to the 1st century BCE, record the endowments made by a group of merchants from Madurai. Another set of inscriptions from 2nd century CE, found at Pugalur village near Karur, document the construction of a rock shelter by a Chera king of the Irumporai line for a Jain monk, <i>Cenkayapan</i>. Cave inscriptions at Arachalur, dated to the 4th century CE, provide evidence for the cultivation of music and dance in the Tamil country.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> One of the earliest inscriptional evidence of the chieftains of the Sangam age was found at Jambai, a village near the town of Tirukkoyilur in Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu. These inscriptions belonging to the 1st century CE record the grants made by the chieftain Atiyaman Netuman Anci who ruled from Takatur. According to epigraphist I. Mahadevan, there were some reservations initially, about the linguistic details in the inscriptions, but further investigations have confirmed their authenticity.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> Inscriptions from 2nd century CE found at Mannarkoil village in Tirunelveli district contain a reference to a <i>katikai</i>, which could mean an assembly of learned persons or an institution of higher learning. An inscription belonging to the early Cholas has been discovered near Tiruchirappalli and has been dated between the 2nd and 4th century CE.
An analysis of the geographical sites of these cave inscriptions points to the possibility of the Tamil-Brahmi script having been created at Madurai around the 3rd century BCE and its disseminations to other parts of Tamil country thereafter.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Pottery_inscriptions" name="Pottery_inscriptions"></a><h3>Pottery inscriptions</h3>
<p>Inscriptions on pottery, written in Tamil-Brahmi, have been found from about 20 archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu. Using methods such as stratigraphy and palaeography, these have been dated between 2nd century BCE and 3rd century CE. Similar inscriptions in Tamil-Brahmi have also been found outside ancient Tamil country in <a href="/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh" id="w">Andhra Pradesh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sri_Lanka" id="w">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thailand" id="w">Thailand</a><sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> and the <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" id="w">Red Sea</a> coast in <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>.
<a href="/wiki/Arikamedu" id="w">Arikamedu</a>, the ancient port city of <a href="/wiki/Chola_Dynasty" id="w">Cholas</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Urayur" id="w">Urayur</a>, their capital, have yielded several fragmentary pottery inscriptions, all dated to the Sangam age. <a href="/wiki/Kodumanal" id="w">Kodumanal</a>, a major industrial center known for the manufacture of gems during this period, had remains of pottery with insciptions in Tamil, <a href="/wiki/Prakrit" id="w">Prakrit</a> and Sinhala-Prakrit. <a href="/wiki/Alagankulam" id="w">Alagankulam</a>, a thriving sea port of the early <a href="/wiki/Pandyan_Kingdom" id="w">Pandyas</a>, has yielded pottery inscriptions that mention several personal names including the name of a <a href="/wiki/Chera_dynasty" id="w">Chera</a> prince. One of the pottery sherds contained the depiction of a large <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Roman</a> ship. Many other ancient sites such as <a href="/wiki/Kanchipuram" id="w">Kanchipuram</a>, <a href="/wiki/Karur" id="w">Karur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Korkai" id="w">Korkai</a> and <a href="/wiki/Puhar" id="w">Puhar</a> have all yielded pottery with inscriptions on them. Outside of the Tamil Nadu and <a href="/wiki/Kerala" id="w">Kerala</a>, inscriptions in Tamil-Brahmi have been found in <a href="/wiki/Srikakulam" id="w">Srikakulam</a> district in Andhra Pradesh, <a href="/wiki/Jaffna" id="w">Jaffna</a> in Sri Lanka, ancient Roman ports of <a href="/wiki/Qusier_al-Qadim" id="w">Qusier al-Qadim</a> and <a href="/wiki/Berenike" id="w">Berenike</a> in Egypt. The inscriptions at Berenike refer to a Tamil chieftain Korran.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Other_inscriptions" name="Other_inscriptions"></a><h3>Other inscriptions</h3>
<p>Apart from caverns and pottery, Tamil-Brahmi writings are also found in coins, seals and rings of the Sangam age. Many of them have been picked up from the Amaravathi river bed near Karur. A smaller number of inscribed objects have been picked up from the beds of other rivers like South Pennar and Vaigai. An oblong piece of polished stone with Tamil-Brahmi inscription has been located in a museum in the ancient port city of Khuan Luk Pat in southern Thailand. Based on the inscription, the object has been identified as a touchstone (<i>uraikal</i>) used for testing the fitness of gold. The inscription is dated to 3rd or 4th century CE.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Polity_from_inscriptions" name="Polity_from_inscriptions"></a><h3>Polity from inscriptions</h3>
<p>Epigraphy provides an account of various aspects of Sangam polity and has been used to verify some of the information provided by sources such as literature and numismatics. The names of various kings and chieftains occurring  in the inscriptions include Nedunj Cheliyan, Peruvaluthi, Cheras of the Irumporai family, Tittan, Netunkilli, Adiyaman, Pittan and Korrantai. References to  administration includes the chiefs, superintendents, titles of ministers, palace of merchants and the village assembly. Religious references to Buddhist and Jain monks are found frequently, which have provided valuable information explaining the spread of those religions in Tamilakam. Brief mentions of various aspects of the Sangam society such as agriculture, trade, commodities, occupations, the social stratification, flora, fauna, music and dance, names of cities and names of individuals are also found in the inscriptions.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Numismatic_sources" name="Numismatic_sources"></a><h2>Numismatic sources</h2>
<p>Another important source of studying ancient Tamil history are the coins that have been found in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. The coins belonging to the Sangam age, found in <a href="/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" id="w">Tamil Nadu</a> are generally classified into three categories. The first category consists of <a href="/wiki/Numismatic_terminology#P " id="w">punch-marked</a> coins from <a href="/wiki/Magadha" id="w">Magadha</a> (<a href="/wiki/400_BCE" id="w">400 BCE</a> - <a href="/wiki/187_BCE" id="w">187 BCE</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/Satavahanas" id="w">Satavahanas</a> (<a href="/wiki/200_BCE" id="w">200 BCE</a> - <a href="/wiki/200" id="w">200 CE</a>). The second category is made up of coins from the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Roman Empire</a> dated from <a href="/wiki/31_BCE" id="w">31 BCE</a> to <a href="/wiki/217" id="w">217 CE</a>, coins of Phonecians and Seleucids and coins from the Mediterranean region (c. <a href="/wiki/300_BCE" id="w">300 BCE</a>). The third category of Sangam age Tamil coins are  the punch-marked silver, copper and lead coins dated 200 BCE - 200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. The coins belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading relationships that the Tamil people had with the kingdoms of northern India and the outside world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam  age Tamil polity. The third category of coins, however, have provided direct testimony to the existence of ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Pandyan_coins" name="Pandyan_coins"></a><h3> Pandyan coins </h3>
<p>Among the many coins attributed to the early Pandyas, are a series of punch-marked coins made of silver and copper, that are considered to belong to the earliest period.  Six groups of silver punch-marked coins and one group of copper coins have been analysed so far.  All of these punch-marked coins have a stylised fish symbol on their <a href="/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse" id="w">reverse</a>, which is considered the royal emblem of the Pandyas.  On the <a href="/wiki/Obverse" id="w">obverse</a> of these coins are a variety symbols such as the sun, the sadarachakra, the trishul, a dog, stupa etc.  The first group of silver coins was found at <a href="/wiki/Bodinayakanur" id="w">Bodinayakanur</a>, in a hoard containing 1124 coins all belonging to the same type.  The remaining coins in the five silver group and the copper group were all found in the Vaigai river bed near <a href="/wiki/Madurai" id="w">Madurai</a>.  Four of the six silver groups have been assigned  a date close to the end of the <a href="/wiki/Mauryan" id="w">Mauryan</a> rule, c. <a href="/wiki/187_BCE" id="w">187 BCE</a>.  Since <a href="/wiki/Tamilakam" id="w">Tamilakam</a> was deficient in metallic silver and since Roman silver did not become available in abundance until later, around 44 BCE, it has been postulated that the Pandyan kings melted silver from the coins brought in by trade with <a href="/wiki/Magadha" id="w">Magadha</a> or some foreign location other than <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Rome</a>.  The names of the Pandyan kings who issued this series of coins is not clear.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> Another series of coins, all made of copper and found near Madurai, have the fish symbol on the reverse and among other symbols on the obverse, have the legend <i>Peruvaluthi</i> written in the <a href="/wiki/Tamil-Brahmi" id="w">Tamil-Brahmi</a> script.  They have been assigned a date of around 200 BCE and are considered to have been issued by the Pandyan king Peruvaluthi. These coins are represent some of the few instances where the names of Sangam kings appear in non-literary sources.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> Sangam literature mentions the importance attached to Vedic sacrifices by Tamil kings including the Pandyan Mudukudumi Peruvaludhi.  This fact is also corroborated by the discovery of several Pandyan coins that are referred to as the <i>Vedic sacrifice</i> series.  These coins have symbols on their obverse that depict the sacrifices, such as a horse tied to the <i>yuba-stambha</i>, a <i>yagna kunta</i> and a <i>nandhipada</i>.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> More coins with animal symbols such as the tortoise, the elephant and the bull have been found and assigned to the Pandyan kings. Some of them even have a human portrait, possibly of the king who issued those coins, on their obverse. There are also Pandyan coins belonging to the 1st century BCE that have symbols depicting pearls, signifying the importance of pearl fishery to the Pandyan kingdom.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> The excavations at Algankulam, near Madurai, recovered two copper coins of the early Pandyas along with Northern Black Polished Ware. These coins have been assigned a broad time period ranging from 200 BCE to 200 CE.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Chera_coins" name="Chera_coins"></a><h3>Chera coins</h3>
<p>Many of the coins assigned to the Chera kings of Sangam age have been found near the Amaravathi river bed in Karur and elsewhere in Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu state. They depict the royal emblem of the Cheras, the bow and arrow symbol, on the reverse. Among the Chera coins, the Makkotai series bears a unique pattern not found in other Tamil coins of its age. They contain both the portrait of a king (facing right) and a written legend, in this case the word Makkotai written in Tamil-Brahmi script. They have tentatively been identified with the Chera king Cheraman Makkotai. These coins exhibit similarities with the Roman coins of emperors Augustus and Tiberius; like the Roman coins, the portraits on the Makkotai series do not show any jewellery on the king. They are thought to be made of two separate pieces joined by lead, a practice prevalent elsewhere in India at that time. Official seals of the king Makkotai have also been recovered from the river bed; these seals contain the portrait facing left and the legend Makkotai written backwards (right-to-left). The reverse of the seals is blank. The Makkotai coins and the seals have been assigned a date range of 100 BCE to end of 100 AD.  Another aspect of the portraits on the Makkotai coins are that they do not have identical head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they all have the same written legend. Such an observation has been made of coins assigned to the Western Kshatrapas of Gujarat, which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera coins. Scholars who analyzed the varying portraiture on the Kshatrapa coins have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the coins all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his different ages or that the coins could be of different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their coins. Based on such theories, the Chera coins could either belong to the single king Cheraman Makkotai or to a series of his successors.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another series of Chera coins depicts various animals along with symbols on its obverse and the Cheran emblem on its reverse. Elephant, horse, bull, tortoise and lion are the animals depicted in this series, along with snake and fish. Symbols of inanimate objects include arched hills, battle axe, conch, river, swastika, trident, flowers and the sun.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>
<p>A few other coins that contain a portrait and a legend have been unearthed; a coin assigned to Kuttuvan Kotai with his portrait and the legend ‘’Kuttuvan Kotai’’ is notable for the occurrence of the pulli in the legend. Based on paleography of the script, it has been assigned a date of late 1st century to early 2nd century CE. A coin belonging to 100 CE with the legend ‘’Kollipurai’’ and a full-body portrait of a warrior has been assigned to the king Kopperum Cheral Irumporai, as he was known as the victor of Kolli in literature. Another coin of roughly the same period of 100 CE with the legend ‘’Kolirumporaiy’’ and a warrior portrait has been found; it has not been assigned to a single king, but based on the legend, there are at least six Chera kings who could be associated with it.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Chola_coins" name="Chola_coins"></a><h3>Chola coins</h3>
<p>The number of Chola coins discovered so far are not as many as those of Pandyas; most of them have been found from archeological excavations at Puhar and Arikamedu, and also beds of rivers Amaravathi near Karur and South Pennar near Tirukkoilur.  An early Chola coin has also been found in Thailand. The Chola coins do not contain a portrait or a legend and all of them depict symbols of animals and other inanimate objects like the animal series of the Cheras. But, all of them carry the symbol of a tiger, the Chola emblem, on their reverse. One of the coins has been assigned a date earlier than 200 BCE and some other to about the time of Roman influence, which is around the dawn of the Christian era.<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Coins_of_Chieftains" name="Coins_of_Chieftains"></a><h3>Coins of Chieftains</h3>
<p>Parts of the Sangam age Tamil country were ruled over by several independent chieftains, along side the three crowned monarchs. Among them, coins belonging to the chieftains of the Malayaman clan have been found in Tamil Nadu. Many of them contain a written legend on the obverse and all of them have the image of a flowing river on their obverse. Based on the legends some of these coins have been assigned to specific rulers such as Tirukkannan, also known as Malaiyan Choliya Enadi Tirukkannan, and  Tirumudi Kari. A series of coins without a legend but with a horse as the principal motif on the obverse have been assigned to the Malayaman chieftains, because of the river symbol on the obverse. Numismatist R. Krishnamurthy, dates these coins to the period between 100 BCE  and 100 CE.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup></p>
