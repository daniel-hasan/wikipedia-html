<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h1> Early life </h1>
<p>Ellington was born at 155 Kennington Road, Kennington, London, the youngest of four children.  His father was Harry Pitts Brown (c.1877–1920), an African American music-hall comedian and entertainer, and his mother was Eva Stenkell Rosenthal (b. c.1879), a Russian Jew. His father died when Brown was four years old.  He was brought up as a strictly Orthodox Jew. He attended South London Jewish School (1924–30), before entering show business at the age of twelve, when he appeared in an acting role on the London stage.</p>
<a id="Musical_style" name="Musical_style"></a><h1> Musical style </h1>
<p>Ellington specialised in <a href="/wiki/Jazz" id="w">jazz</a> but experimented with many other genres throughout the show&#39;s history and his musical style was heavily influenced by the comedic jump blues of <a href="/wiki/Louis_Jordan" id="w">Louis Jordan</a>. Ellington&#39;s band was one of the first in the UK to feature the stripped-back guitar/bass/drums/piano format that became the basis of <a href="/wiki/Rock%26%2339%3Bn%26%2339%3Broll" id="w">rock&#39;n&#39;roll</a>, as well as being one of the first groups in Britain to prominently feature the <a href="/wiki/Electric_guitar" id="w">electric guitar</a>. They were also reputedly the very first jazz band in the UK to use an <a href="/wiki/Amplification" id="w">amplified</a> bass.</p>
<p>Early in the show&#39;s run, there were many jokes linking Ellington to the <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">African</a> nation of <a href="/wiki/Ghana" id="w">Ghana</a>, thus leading Ellington to say that he came from Ghana. In truth, Ellington was born to a <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russian</a> Jewish mother and an <a href="/wiki/African-American" id="w">African-American</a> father in <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
