Clark was <a href="/wiki/Valedictorian" id="w">valedictorian</a> of his class at <a href="/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy" id="w">West Point</a>, was awarded a <a href="/wiki/Rhodes_Scholarship" id="w">Rhodes Scholarship</a> to the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" id="w">University of Oxford</a> where he obtained a degree in <a href="/wiki/Philosophy%2C_Politics%2C_and_Economics" id="w">PPE</a> (Philosophy, Politics &#38; Economics), and later graduated from the <a href="/wiki/Command_and_General_Staff_College" id="w">Command and General Staff College</a> with a master&#39;s degree in <a href="/wiki/Military_science" id="w">military science</a>. He spent 34 years in the Army and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" id="w">Department of Defense</a>, receiving many <a href="/wiki/Awards_and_decorations_of_the_United_States_military" id="w">military decorations</a>, several honorary <a href="/wiki/Knight" id="w">knighthoods</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom" id="w">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>.</p>
<p>Clark commanded <a href="/wiki/1999_NATO_bombing_of_the_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" id="w">Operation Allied Force</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Kosovo_War" id="w">Kosovo War</a> during his term as the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Powers_Europe" id="w">Supreme Allied Commander Europe</a> of <a href="/wiki/NATO" id="w">NATO</a> from 1997 to 2000. Some of Clark&#39;s command decisions during the conflict, such as his statements at press briefings and his actions at <a href="/wiki/Pri%C5%A1tina_International_Airport" id="w">Priština International Airport</a>, were heavily criticized. At times, he had a difficult relationship with <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense" id="w">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="/wiki/William_Cohen" id="w">William Cohen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff" id="w">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> General <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Shelton" id="w">Hugh Shelton</a>, which led to rumors Clark was forced into retirement, though both he and the Department of Defense said his retirement was merely standard personnel movement.</p>
<p>Clark joined the 2004 race for the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic Party</a> <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)_presidential_primaries%2C_2004" id="w">presidential nomination</a> as a candidate on <a href="/wiki/September_17" id="w">September 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>, but withdrew from the primary race on <a href="/wiki/February_11" id="w">February 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a> in favor of campaigning for the eventual Democratic nominee, <a href="/wiki/John_Kerry" id="w">John Kerry</a>.

<p>Kanne came from the <a href="/wiki/Kohen" id="w">Kohen</a> family line,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> and Clark&#39;s son has characterized his grandparents&#39; marriage, between <a href="/wiki/Judaism" id="w">Jewish</a> Benjamin and <a href="/wiki/Methodism" id="w">Methodist</a> Veneta Kanne,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> as &#34;about as multicultural as you could&#39;ve gotten in 1944.&#34;<sup id="_ref-AmerSon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AmerSon" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Clark was born Wesley Kanne in Chicago on <a href="/wiki/December_23" id="w">December 23</a> <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>. His father Benjamin died on <a href="/wiki/December_6" id="w">December 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1948" id="w">1948</a>, following which his mother then moved the family to <a href="/wiki/Little_Rock%2C_Arkansas" id="w">Little Rock</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arkansas" id="w">Arkansas</a>. This move was made for a variety of reasons, including escaping the greater cost of living in a large city such as Chicago, the support Veneta&#39;s family in Arkansas could provide, and her feeling of being an outsider to the remaining Kanne family as she did not share their religion.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Once in Little Rock, Veneta married Viktor Clark, whom she met while working as a secretary for a local bank.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Viktor raised Wesley as his son, and officially <a href="/wiki/Adoption" id="w">adopted</a> him on Wesley&#39;s 16th birthday. Wesley&#39;s name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark&#39;s name actually replaced that of Wesley&#39;s biological father on his <a href="/wiki/Birth_certificate" id="w">birth certificate</a>, something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Veneta raised Wesley without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Semitic activities of the <a href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan" id="w">Ku Klux Klan</a> occurring in the South at the time.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Although his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a <a href="/wiki/Baptist" id="w">Baptist</a> church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

Clark&#39;s military career began <a href="/wiki/July_2" id="w">July 2</a> <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a> when he entered the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy" id="w">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="/wiki/West_Point%2C_New_York" id="w">West Point</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>. Clark later said an important influence on his view of the military came from <a href="/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur" id="w">Douglas MacArthur</a>&#39;s famous <a href="http://sources.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty%2C_honor%2C_country">&#34;Duty, honor, country&#34;</a> speech given to the class of 1962, only months before Clark entered West Point. A recording of the speech was played for Clark&#39;s class when they first arrived.<sup id="_ref-AmerSon_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AmerSon" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-westpoint_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-westpoint" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Clark sat in the &#34;first chair&#34; in many of his classes, a position held by the highest performer in class. Clark participated heavily in <a href="/wiki/Debate" id="w">debate</a>, was consistently within the top 5% of his class as a whole (earning him a &#34;Distinguished Cadet&#34; patch on his uniform), and ultimately graduated as <a href="/wiki/Valedictorian" id="w">valedictorian</a> of West Point. The valedictorian is first to choose which career field of the Army to serve in, and Clark selected <a href="/wiki/Armoured_forces" id="w">armor</a>. He met Gertrude Kingston, his future wife, at a <a href="/wiki/United_Service_Organizations" id="w">USO</a> dance for <a href="/wiki/Midshipman#United States Navy" id="w">midshipmen</a> and West Point cadets.<sup id="_ref-AmerSon_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AmerSon" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-westpoint_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-westpoint" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Clark eventually applied for a <a href="/wiki/Rhodes_Scholarship" id="w">Rhodes Scholarship</a> and learned in December of his senior year at West Point that he had been accepted. He spent his summer at the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Airborne_School" id="w">United States Army Airborne School</a> at <a href="/wiki/Fort_Benning" id="w">Fort Benning</a>, Georgia. Clark worked in the <a href="/wiki/Philosophy%2C_Politics%2C_and_Economics" id="w">Philosophy, Politics, and Economics</a> (PPE) program during his Rhodes Scholarship, completing his degree at <a href="/wiki/Magdalen_College%2C_Oxford" id="w">Magdalen College</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" id="w">University of Oxford</a> in August 1968. While he was at Oxford, a Jewish cousin of Clark&#39;s who lived in <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> telephoned Clark and informed him of his Jewish heritage (after asking his mother if she would allow it). Clark spent three months after graduation at <a href="/wiki/Fort_Knox" id="w">Fort Knox</a>, Kentucky, going through Armor Officer Basic Course, then went on to <a href="/wiki/Ranger_School" id="w">Ranger School</a> at Fort Benning. He was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Captain_(United_States)" id="w">captain</a> and was assigned as commander of the A <a href="/wiki/Company_(military_unit)" id="w">Company</a> of the 4th Battalion, 68th Armor, <a href="/wiki/82nd_Airborne_Division_(United_States)" id="w">82nd Airborne Division</a> at <a href="/wiki/Fort_Riley" id="w">Fort Riley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kansas" id="w">Kansas</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

Clark was assigned a position in the <a href="/wiki/1st_Infantry_Division_(United_States)" id="w">1st Infantry Division</a> and flew to <a href="/wiki/Vietnam" id="w">Vietnam</a> on <a href="/wiki/May_21" id="w">May 21</a> <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a> during the U.S. involvement in the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" id="w">Vietnam War</a>. He worked as a staff officer, collecting data and helping in operations planning, and was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Star_Medal" id="w">Bronze Star</a> for his work with the staff. Clark was then given command of A Company, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in January 1970. In February, only one month into his command, he was shot four times by a <a href="/wiki/Viet_Cong" id="w">Viet Cong</a> soldier with an <a href="/wiki/AK-47" id="w">AK-47</a>. The wounded Clark shouted orders to his men, who <a href="/wiki/Counterattack" id="w">counterattacked</a> and defeated the Viet Cong force. Clark had injuries to his right shoulder, right hand, right hip, and right leg, and was sent to <a href="/wiki/Valley_Forge_General_Hospital" id="w">Valley Forge Army Hospital</a> in <a href="/wiki/Phoenixville%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Phoenixville</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a> to recuperate.

<p>Clark had converted to <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Catholicism</a>, his wife Gertrude&#39;s religion, while in Vietnam. He saw his son, Wesley Clark, Jr., for the first time while at the Valley Forge Hospital.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Clark commanded C Company, 6th Battalion, 32nd Armor, <a href="/wiki/194th_Armored_Brigade_(United_States)" id="w">194th Armored Brigade</a>, a company composed entirely of wounded soldiers, at Fort Knox. Clark has said this command is what made him decide to continue his military career past the four-year commitment required by West Point, which would have concluded in 1971. Clark completed his Armor Officer Advanced Course while at Fort Knox, taking additional elective courses and writing an article that won the Armor Association Writing Award. His next posting was to the office of the <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_Staff_of_the_United_States_Army" id="w">Army Chief of Staff</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>, where he worked in the &#34;Modern Volunteer Army&#34; program from May to July 1971. He then served as a <a href="/wiki/Social_studies" id="w">social studies</a> instructor at West Point for three years from July 1971 to 1974.<sup id="_ref-confirmbio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-confirmbio" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

Clark&#39;s theory was one of applying force swiftly, which was being advocated by many soldiers at the time, a concept that would eventually become established as U.S. national security policy in the form of the <a href="/wiki/Weinberger_Doctrine" id="w">Weinberger Doctrine</a> and its successor, the <a href="/wiki/Powell_Doctrine" id="w">Powell Doctrine</a>.

He was one of only 14 appointed out of 2,307 applicants.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Lynn also gave Clark a six-week assignment to assist <a href="/wiki/John_Otho_Marsh%2C_Jr." id="w">John Marsh</a>, then a counselor to the President. Clark was approached during his fellowship to help push for a memorial to the Vietnam War. He worked with the movement that ultimately helped lead to the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial" id="w">Vietnam Veterans Memorial</a> in Washington, D.C. Clark took two commands with the <a href="/wiki/1st_Armored_Division_(United_States)" id="w">1st Armored Division</a> based in <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> from August 1976 to February 1978, first over the 3rd Battalion 35th Armor and then the entire 3rd Brigade.<sup id="_ref-confirmbio_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-confirmbio" title="">[21]</a></sup> Clark&#39;s brigade commander while in the former position said Clark was &#34;singularly outstanding, notably superb.&#34; Regarding his term as brigade commander, one of his battalion commanders called Clark the &#34;most brilliant and gifted officer [he&#39;d] ever known.&#34;<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> He was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Meritorious_Service_Medal_(United_States)" id="w">Meritorious Service Medal</a> for his work with the division.</p>

Haig personally selected Clark to serve as a special assistant on his staff, a post he held from February 1978 to June 1979. While on staff at <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Powers_Europe" id="w">SHAPE</a>, Clark wrote policy reports and coordinated two multinational military exercises. As a result of his work on Haig&#39;s staff, Clark was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel_(United_States)" id="w">lieutenant colonel</a> and was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Legion_of_Merit" id="w">Legion of Merit</a>.

Following his graduation, Clark worked in Washington, D.C. from July 1983 to 1984 in the offices of the <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_Staff_of_the_United_States_Army" id="w">Chief and Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the United States Army</a>, and earned a second Legion of Merit for his work. He then served as the Operations Group commander at the <a href="/wiki/Fort_Irwin_Military_Reservation" id="w">Fort Irwin Military Reservation</a> from August 1984 to June 1986. He was awarded yet another Legion of Merit and a Meritorious Service Medal for his work at Fort Irwin, and was then given a brigade command at Fort Carson in 1986. He commanded the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry there from April 1986 to March 1988. Veneta Clark, Wesley&#39;s mother, fell ill as he began this command and died on <a href="/wiki/Mother%26%2339%3Bs_Day" id="w">Mother&#39;s Day</a> in 1986. After Fort Carson, Clark returned to the Command and General Staff College to direct and further develop the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) there until October 1989. The BCTP was created to teach senior officers war-fighting skills, according to the commanding general at the time.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Then on <a href="/wiki/November_1" id="w">November 1</a> <a href="/wiki/1989" id="w">1989</a> Clark became a general with his promotion to <a href="/wiki/Brigadier_General#United States" id="w">brigadier general</a>.<sup id="_ref-confirmbio_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-confirmbio" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Clark returned to Fort Irwin and commanded the <a href="/wiki/Fort_Irwin_Military_Reservation" id="w">National Training Center</a> (NTC) from October 1989 to 1991. The <a href="/wiki/Gulf_War" id="w">Gulf War</a> occurred during Clark&#39;s command, and many <a href="/wiki/United_States_National_Guard" id="w">National Guard</a> divisional round-out brigades trained under his command. Multiple generals commanding American forces in <a href="/wiki/Iraq" id="w">Iraq</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kuwait" id="w">Kuwait</a> said Clark&#39;s training helped bring about results in the field and that he had successfully begun training a new generation of the military that had moved past Vietnam-era strategy. He was awarded yet another Legion of Merit for his &#34;personal efforts&#34; that were &#34;instrumental in maintaining&#34; the NTC, according to the citation.

<p>Army regulations set a so-called &#34;ticking clock&#34; upon the promotion to a three-star general, essentially requiring that Clark be promoted to another post within 2 years from his initial promotion or retire. This deadline ended in 1996 and Clark said he was not optimistic about receiving such a promotion because rumors at the time suggested General <a href="/wiki/Dennis_Reimer" id="w">Dennis Reimer</a> did not want to promote him although &#34;no specific reason was given&#34;.<sup id="_ref-wmr68_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wmr68" title="">[37]</a></sup> General Robert Scales admitted that it was likely Clark&#39;s reputation of intelligence within the military was responsible for feelings of resentment against him from other generals.

While collecting information to outline military options for resolving the conflict, Clark met with <a href="/wiki/Army_of_Republika_Srpska" id="w">Bosnian military</a> leaders including <a href="/wiki/Ratko_Mladi%C4%87" id="w">Ratko Mladić</a>, who was later accused of <a href="/wiki/War_crime" id="w">war crimes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Genocide" id="w">genocide</a>.

He was, as with SOUTHCOM, not the original nominee for the position. The Army had already selected another general for the post. Because President Clinton and General Shalikashvili believed Clark was the best man for the post, Clark eventually got the nomination.

Clark also addressed issues related to his then-current command of USSOUTHCOM, such as support for the <a href="/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation" id="w">School of the Americas</a> and his belief that the United States must continue aid to some <a href="/wiki/South_America" id="w">South American</a> nations to effectively fight the <a href="/wiki/War_on_Drugs" id="w">War on Drugs</a>.<sup id="_ref-confirm_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-confirm" title="">[41]</a></sup> Clark was quickly confirmed by a <a href="/wiki/Voice_vote" id="w">voice vote</a> the same day as his confirmation hearing,<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> giving him the command of 109,000 American troops, their 150,000 family members, 50,000 civilians aiding the military, and all American military activities in 89 countries and territories of <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" id="w">Middle East</a>.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> The position made Clark the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Powers_Europe" id="w">Supreme Allied Commander Europe</a> (SACEUR), which granted him overall command of NATO military forces in Europe.</p>

<a id="Pri%C5%A1tina_International_Airport" name="Pri%C5%A1tina_International_Airport"></a><h5>Priština International Airport</h5>
<p>One of Clark&#39;s most argued decisions during his SACEUR command was his attempted operation at <a href="/wiki/Pri%C5%A1tina_International_Airport" id="w">Priština International Airport</a> immediately after the end of the Kosovo War. <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russian</a> forces had arrived in Kosovo and were heading for the airport on <a href="/wiki/June_12" id="w">June 12</a> <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a>, two days after the bombing campaign ended, expecting to help police that section of Kosovo. Clark, on the other hand, had planned for the <a href="/wiki/Kosovo_Force" id="w">Kosovo Force</a> to police the area. Clark called then-Secretary General of NATO <a href="/wiki/Javier_Solana" id="w">Javier Solana</a>, and was told &#34;of course you have to get to the airport&#34; and &#34;you have transfer of authority&#34; in the area. The <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> commander of the Kosovo Force, General <a href="/wiki/Mike_Jackson" id="w">Mike Jackson</a>, however refused to block the Russians through military action saying &#34;I&#39;m not going to start the <a href="/wiki/Third_World_War" id="w">Third World War</a> for you.&#34; Jackson has said he refused to take action because he did not believe it was worth the risk of a military confrontation with the Russians. American General <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Shelton" id="w">Hugh Shelton</a> called Jackson&#39;s refusal &#34;troubling,&#34; and hearings in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" id="w">United States Senate</a> suggested it may amount to <a href="/wiki/Insubordination" id="w">insubordination</a>, with Senator <a href="/wiki/John_Warner" id="w">John Warner</a> suggesting holding hearings regarding whether the refusal was legal and potentially changing those rules if it was.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> British <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Staff_(United_Kingdom)" id="w">Chief of the Defence Staff</a> <a href="/wiki/Charles_Guthrie%2C_Baron_Guthrie_of_Craigiebank" id="w">
Charles Guthrie</a>, however, agreed with Jackson and told Clark this on the day Jackson refused the order.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> Russian military action in Kosovo was eventually stopped peacefully, as some nations, including <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" id="w">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Romania" id="w">Romania</a> (both of which sought eventual NATO membership), disallowed Russian aircraft to fly over their territory, halting their ability to bring in forces.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Retirement" name="Retirement"></a><h2>Retirement</h2>
<p>Clark received another call from General Shelton in July 1999 in which he was told that Secretary Cohen wanted Clark to leave his command in April 2000. Clark was surprised by this, as he saw SACEURs as being expected to serve at least 3 years and often asked to stay on for a 4th, while this date would give him less than 3 years of service at the post.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> Clark was told that this was necessary because General <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Ralston" id="w">Joseph Ralston</a> was leaving his post as the <a href="/wiki/Vice_Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff" id="w">Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> and would need another 4-star command within 60 days or he would be forced to retire. Ralston was not going to be appointed <a href="/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff" id="w">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> due to an extramarital affair in his past, and the SACEUR position was said to be the last potential post for him.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> Clark said this explanation &#34;didn&#39;t wash&#34; because he believed the legalities could have been sorted out to let him serve a full 3 years.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> Clinton signed onto Ralston&#39;s reassignment, although <a href="/wiki/David_Halberstam" id="w">David Halberstam</a> wrote that both he and Madeleine Albright were angered at Clark&#39;s treatment.

<p>Rumors persisted that Clark was forced out due to his contentious relationship with some in Washington D.C.; however, he has dismissed them, calling it a &#34;routine personnel action,&#34; and the Department of Defense said it was merely a &#34;general rotation of American senior ranks.&#34;<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> However, a NATO ambassador told the <i><a href="/wiki/International_Herald_Tribune" id="w">International Herald Tribune</a></i> that Clark&#39;s dismissal seemed to be a &#34;political thing from the United States.&#34;<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup> General Hugh Shelton would say of Clark during his 2004 campaign that &#34;the reason he came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart.

<p>Clark had earned an average of <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$40</a>,000 per year over the course of his military career and, according to <i>The New York Times</i>, retired with &#34;precious little in the bank to show for years of public service.&#34;<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> Clark set himself three initial goals in civilian life — to earn $40 million in the business world to let him practice <a href="/wiki/Philanthropy" id="w">philanthropy</a>, to become a <a href="/wiki/Professor" id="w">professor</a>, and to become a <a href="/wiki/Professional_golfer" id="w">professional golfer</a>.

Clark began a <a href="/wiki/Public_speaker" id="w">public speaking tour</a> in the summer of 2000 and approached several former government officials for advice on work after life in government, including <a href="/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">House Speaker</a> <a href="/wiki/Newt_Gingrich" id="w">Newt Gingrich</a>, <a href="/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff" id="w">White House Chief of Staff</a> <a href="/wiki/Mack_McLarty" id="w">Mack McLarty</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Richard_Holbrooke" id="w">Richard Holbrooke</a>.

She told him that the war in Kosovo would have never taken place under a Bush administration, as they adhered more to <a href="/wiki/Realpolitik" id="w">realpolitik</a>. Clark found such an administration unsettling, as he had been selected for the SACEUR position because he believed more in the <a href="/wiki/Interventionism_(politics)" id="w">interventionist</a> policies of the Clinton administration.

<p>Clark met with a group of wealthy <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> Democrats including Alan Patricof to tell them he was considering running for the presidency in the 2004 election. Patricof, a supporter of <a href="/wiki/Al_Gore" id="w">Al Gore</a> in 2000, met with all the Democratic candidates and ultimately supported Clark in 2004.

<p>Clark spent time during these early stages of the draft movement deciding whether to run, a decision he said was based heavily on deciding whether to expose his family to a presidential campaign. His wife, Gert, said she was &#34;initially... not delighted about it,&#34; but later changed her mind after hearing their son Wesley Clark, Jr. say that &#34;things have to change, and we&#39;re willing to do it.

Clark, coming from a non-political background, had no position papers to define his agenda for the public. Once in the campaign, however, several volunteers established a network of connections with the media, and Clark began to explain his stances on a variety of issues. He was, as he had told <i><a href="/wiki/The_Washington_Post" id="w">The Washington Post</a></i> in October, pro-choice and pro-affirmative action. He called for a repeal of recent Bush <a href="/wiki/Tax_cut" id="w">tax cuts</a> for people earning more than $200,000 and suggested providing healthcare for the uninsured by altering the current system rather than transferring to a completely new <a href="/wiki/Universal_health_care" id="w">universal health care</a> system.

Clark also proposed a global effort to strengthen American relations with other nations, reviewing the <a href="/wiki/USA_PATRIOT_Act" id="w">PATRIOT Act</a>, and investing $100 billion in <a href="/wiki/Homeland_security" id="w">homeland security</a>. Finally, he put out a budget plan that claimed to save $2.35 trillion over ten years through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts, sharing the cost of the <a href="/wiki/Iraq_War" id="w">Iraq War</a> with other nations, and cutting government waste.<sup id="_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#_note-106" title="">[106]</a></sup> Clark had testified before the <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services" id="w">House Committee on Armed Services</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_26" id="w">September 26</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a><sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[107]</a></sup> that while he supported the <a href="/wiki/Iraq_Resolution" id="w">Iraq Resolution</a> he believed the country should try other options before the more immediate war President Bush had been calling for at the time, and this testimony was later used during his presidential campaign to portray Clark as pro-war although <a href="/wiki/FactCheck" id="w">FactCheck</a> called this a &#34;classic case of ripping quotes out of their full context in order to create a false picture.&#34;<sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[108]</a></sup> Clark testified before this committee again in 2005,<sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[109]</a></sup> a hearing <a href="/wiki/Dana_Milbank" id="w">Dana Milbank</a> of <i>The Washington Post</i> characterized as having a &#34;different tune&#34; as some of Clark&#39;s 2002 testimony that had been portrayed by some committee members as &#34;fuzzy stuff&#34; and &#34;dumb clichés&#34; had proven itself true in the ensuing two and a half years.<sup id="_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#_note-110" title="">[110]</a></sup></p>

Clark said, &#34;At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that&#39;s too simple a question,&#34; then &#34;I don&#39;t know if I would have or not. I&#39;ve said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position — on balance, I probably would have voted for it.&#34; Finally, Clark&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Press_secretary" id="w">press secretary</a> clarified his position as &#34;you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution.&#34; After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">The New York Times</a></i> ran a story with the headline &#34;Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War&#34;.<sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[113]</a></sup> Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season, being forced to continue to clarify his position such as at the second primary debate when he said, &#34;I think it&#39;s really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can&#39;t get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it&#39;s been a huge strategic mistake for this country.&#34;<sup id="_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#_note-114" title="">[114]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another media incident started during the New Hampshire primary September 27, 2003, when Clark was asked by <a href="/wiki/Space_shuttle" id="w">space shuttle</a> astronaut <a href="/wiki/Jay_C._Buckey" id="w">Jay C. Buckey</a> what his vision for the space program was after the <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster" id="w">Space Shuttle Columbia disaster</a>. Clark responded he was a great believer in the exploration of space but wanted a vision well beyond that of a new shuttle or space plane. &#34;I would like to see mankind get off this planet. I&#39;d like to know what&#39;s out there beyond the solar system.&#34; Clark thought such a vision could probably require a lifetime of research and development in various fields of science and technology. Then at the end of his remarks, Clark dropped a bombshell when he said &#34;I still believe in <a href="/wiki/Mass-energy_equivalence" id="w">&#39;&#39;E&#39;&#39;&#160;=&#160;&#39;&#39;mc&#39;&#39;²</a>. But I can&#39;t believe that in all of human history we&#39;ll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go. I happen to believe that mankind can do it. I&#39;ve argued with physicists about it. I&#39;ve argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It&#39;s my only faith-based initiative.&#34;<sup id="_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#_note-115" title="">[115]</a></sup> This led to a series of headlines deriding the response, such as &#34;Beam Us Up, General Clark&#34; in <i>The New York Times</i>, &#34;Clark is Light-Years Ahead of the Competition&#34; in <i>The Washington Post</i>, &#34;General Relativity (Retired)&#34; on the <a href="/wiki/U.S._News_%26amp%3B_World_Report" id="w">U.S. News &#38; World Report</a> website, and &#34;Clark Campaigns at Light Speed&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Wired_(magazine)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Wired&#39;&#39;</a> magazine.<sup id="_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#_note-116" title="">[116]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#_note-117" title="">[117]</a></sup></p>

Several polls from September to November of 2003 showed Clark leading the Democratic field of candidates or as a close second to <a href="/wiki/Howard_Dean" id="w">Howard Dean</a>. The <a href="/wiki/John_Edwards" id="w">John Edwards</a> campaign brought on Hugh Shelton — the general who had said Clark was made to leave the SACEUR post early due to &#34;integrity and character issues&#34; — as an advisor, a move that drew criticism from the Clark campaign.<sup id="_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#_note-118" title="">[118]</a></sup> Since Dean consistently polled in the lead in the <a href="/wiki/Iowa_caucus" id="w">Iowa caucuses</a>, Clark opted out of participating in the caucuses entirely to focus on later primaries instead. The <a href="/wiki/Iowa_Democratic_Party_caucuses%2C_2004" id="w">2004 Iowa caucuses</a> marked a turning point in the campaign for the Democratic nomination, however, as front-runners Dean and <a href="/wiki/Dick_Gephardt" id="w">Dick Gephardt</a> garnered results far lower than expected, and <a href="/wiki/John_Kerry" id="w">John Kerry</a> and John Edwards campaigns&#39; benefited in Clark&#39;s absence.
