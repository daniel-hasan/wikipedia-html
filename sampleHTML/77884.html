<b>Greensboro</b> ({{IPAEng}}{{Fact}}) is a city in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">U.S. state</a> of <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a>. It is the third-largest city, by population, in North Carolina and the largest city in <a href="/wiki/Guilford_County%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Guilford County</a> and the surrounding <a href="/wiki/Piedmont_Triad" id="w">Piedmont Triad</a> metropolitan region. As of the 2000 <a href="/wiki/U.S._Census" id="w">census</a>, Greensboro was home to 223,891 residents. Its estimated <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> population was 240,955. </p>
<p>The city is located at the intersection of two major interstate highways (<a href="/wiki/Interstate_85" id="w">I-85</a> and <a href="/wiki/Interstate_40" id="w">I-40</a>) in the <a href="/wiki/Piedmont_(United_States)" id="w">Piedmont</a> (&#34;foot of the mountains&#34;) region of central North Carolina.</p>
<p>In 1808, <b>Greensborough</b> (as was the spelling prior to 1895) was planned around a central courthouse square to succeed the nearby town of <a href="/wiki/Guilford_Court_House" id="w">Guilford Court House</a> as the <a href="/wiki/County_seat" id="w">county seat</a>. This act moved the county courts closer to the geographical center of the county, a location more easily reached by a greater numberthe majority of the county&#39;s citizens.</p>
<p>In 2003, the previous Greensboro - <a href="/wiki/Winston-Salem" id="w">Winston-Salem</a> - <a href="/wiki/High_Point%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">High Point</a> <a href="/wiki/United_States_metropolitan_area" id="w">metropolitan statistical area</a> (MSA) was re-defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, resulting in the formation of the Greensboro-High Point MSA and the Winston-Salem MSA. The 2006 population estimate for the Greensboro-High Point MSA was 685,378. The Greensboro - Winston-Salem - High Point <a href="/wiki/Combined_statistical_area" id="w">combined statistical area</a> (CSA), popularly referred to as the <a href="/wiki/Piedmont_Triad" id="w">Piedmont Triad</a>, had an estimated population of 1,513,576 in 2006. <i>Source: US Bureau of the Census, Released April 2007</i></p>

</p><a id="Early_history" name="Early_history"></a><h3> Early history </h3>
<p>The city was named for Major General <a href="/wiki/Nathanael_Greene" id="w">Nathanael Greene</a>, commander of the American forces at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Guilford_Court_House" id="w">Battle of Guilford Court House</a> on <a href="/wiki/March_15" id="w">March 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1781" id="w">1781</a>.,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> The Americans lost that battle but the <a href="/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory" id="w">Pyrrhic victory</a> slowed <a href="/wiki/Charles_Cornwallis%2C_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis" id="w">Cornwallis</a>&#39; British forces enough to allow the Americans to prepare to defeat them at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Yorktown_(1781)" id="w">Battle of Yorktown</a>, where the British were forced to surrender on <a href="/wiki/October_19" id="w">October 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1781" id="w">1781</a>, after a 20-day siege, thus ending the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution" id="w">American Revolution</a>. Historian David McCullough considers Nathanael Greene to be &#34;the best general&#34; in the American military during the Revolution, including George Washington.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>    
<p>Greensboro was established near the geographic center of Guilford County, on land that was &#34;an unbroken forest with thick undergrowth of huckleberry bushes, that bore a finely flavored fruit.&#34;<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Property for the future village was purchased for $98, and three north-south streets (Greene, Elm, Davie) were laid out intersecting with three east-west streets (Gaston, Market, Sycamore).<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The courthouse stood at the center of the intersection of Elm and Market streets. By 1821, the town was home to 369 residents.</p> 
<p>In the early <a href="/wiki/1840s" id="w">1840s</a>, Greensboro was selected by the state government at the request of then <a href="/wiki/John_Motley_Morehead" id="w">Governor Morehead</a> (whose estate, <a href="/wiki/Blandwood" id="w">Blandwood</a> is located in Greensboro) for inclusion on a new <a href="/wiki/Railroad" id="w">railroad</a> line. The city grew substantially in size and soon became known as the Gate City due to its role as a transportation hub for the state.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The railroads transported goods to and from <a href="/wiki/Textile" id="w">textile</a> mills, which grew up with their own mill villages around the city. Many of these businesses remained in the city until the 21st century, when most of them went bankrupt, reorganized, and/or merged with other companies. Greensboro remains as a major textile headquarters city with the main offices of International Textile Group (Cone, Burlington Industries), Galey &#38; Lord, Unifi, and <a href="/wiki/VF_Corporation" id="w">VF Corporation</a> (<a href="/wiki/Wrangler" id="w">Wrangler</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lee_(Jeans)" id="w">Lee</a>, North Face, <a href="/wiki/Vanity_Fair" id="w">Vanity Fair</a>). The importance of rail traffic continues for the city, as Greensboro serves as a major regional freight hub, and four <a href="/wiki/Amtrak" id="w">Amtrak</a> passenger trains stop in Greensboro daily on the main <a href="/wiki/Norfolk_Southern" id="w">Norfolk Southern</a> line between <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans" id="w">New Orleans</a> by way of <a href="/wiki/Atlanta" id="w">Atlanta</a>. </p>

<div class="thumbcaption">A Picture of Blandwood Mansion, an Alexander Jackson Davis designed Tuscan Villa</div></div>
 the city developed slowly, early wealth generated from cotton trade and merchandising led to the construction of several notable buildings. The earliest building, later named <a href="/wiki/Blandwood_Mansion_and_Gardens" id="w">Blandwood Mansion and Gardens</a>, built in 1795. Additions to this residence in 1846 designed by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Jackson_Davis" id="w">Alexander Jackson Davis</a> of <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> made the house an influential landmark in the nation as America&#39;s earliest Tuscan Villa. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Other significant estates followed, including &#34;Dunleith&#34; designed by Samuel Sloan, Bellemeade, and the Bumpass-Troy House (now operating as an inn).</p>
<a id="Civil_War_and_Reconstruction" name="Civil_War_and_Reconstruction"></a><h3> Civil War and Reconstruction </h3>
<p>The city played an important role in politics at the end of the Civil War. During the closing days of the conflict, the Confederate Cabinet members evacuated the Confederate Capital, Richmond, Virginia, and moved south. The group reassembled in Greensboro on <a href="/wiki/April_11" id="w">April 11</a>, and for five days, Greensboro served as the temporary capital of the Confederacy.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> At nearly the same time, Governor <a href="/wiki/Zebulon_Baird_Vance" id="w">Zebulon B. Vance</a> fled the capital of North Carolina in anticipation of the arrival of Union General Sherman.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> For a brief period beginning <a href="/wiki/April_16" id="w">April 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1865" id="w">1865</a>, the capital of North Carolina was temporarily maintained in Greensboro.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Governor Vance proclaimed the North Carolina Surrender Declaration on April 28, 1865.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Later, Vance turned himself over to Union officials in the parlor of Blandwood Mansion. In the words of historian Blackwell Robinson, &#34;Greensboro witnessed not only the demise of the Confederacy but also that of the old civil government of the state&#34; of North Carolina. <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Industrialization_and_growth" name="Industrialization_and_growth"></a><h3> Industrialization and growth </h3>
<p>In the 1890s, the city continued to attract attention from northern industrialists, including Moses and Ceasar Cone of Baltimore.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The Cone brothers established large-scale textile plants, changing Greensboro from a village to a city within a decade. By 1900, Greensboro was considered a center of the Southern textile industry, with large scale factories producing denim, flannel, and overalls.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Prosperity brought to the city through textiles resulted in the construction of notable twentieth century civic architecture, including the Guilford County Courthouse, West Market Street <a href="/wiki/Methodist" id="w">Methodist</a> Church by S. W. Faulk, several buildings designed by Frank A. Weston, and <a href="/wiki/UNCG" id="w">UNCG</a>&#39;s Main Building designed by Orlo Epps. </p>
<p>During the twentieth century, Greensboro continued to expanded in wealth and population. Rapid growth led to construction of grand commercial and civic buildings, many of which remain standing today, designed by hometown architects Charles Hartmann and Harry Barton. Other notable industries became established in the city, including Vicks Cemical Co, Carolina Steel Corporation, and Pomona Terra Cotta Works. <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> During this period of growth, Greensboro experienced an acute housing shortage. Builders sought to maintain a construction goal of 80 to 100 affordable housing units per year in order to provide homes for workers. <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Greensboro&#39;s real estate was considered &#34;the wonder of the state&#34; during the 1920s. Growth continued through the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a>, as Greensboro added an estimated 200 new families per year to its population.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> The city earned a reputation as a well-planned community, with a strong emphasis on education, parks, and a profitable employment base.</p> 
<p>As Greensboro evolved into one of North Carolina&#39;s primary cities, changes began to occur within its traditional social structure. On <a href="/wiki/February_1" id="w">February 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1960" id="w">1960</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greensboro_Four" id="w">four black college students</a> from <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_Agricultural_and_Technical_State_University" id="w">North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College</a> sat down at an all-white <a href="/wiki/F.W._Woolworth_Company" id="w">Woolworth&#39;s</a> lunch counter, and refused to leave after they were denied service. Hundreds of others soon joined in this <a href="/wiki/Sit-in" id="w">sit-in</a>, which lasted several months. Such protests quickly spread across the South, ultimately leading to the <a href="/wiki/Desegregation" id="w">desegregation</a> of Woolworth&#39;s and other chains. The original lunch counter and stools now sit in the <a href="/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution" id="w">Smithsonian</a>, but a museum is under development in the original building where the event took place. (As of May 2007, efforts to finally open the International Civil Rights Museum were postponed due to budget constraints.)</p>
<p>Prosperity brought new levels of development involving nationally and internationally known architects. <a href="/wiki/Walter_Gropius" id="w">Walter Gropius</a> designed a factory building in the city in 1944<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup>. Greensboro-based Ed Loewenstein contributed designs for projects throughout the region. <a href="/wiki/Eduardo_Catalano" id="w">Eduardo Catalano</a>, and George Matsumoto both brought designs to the city that challenged North Carolinians with modernist architectural concepts and forms. </p>
<p>In spite of this period of progress, old wounds had yet to heal. On <a href="/wiki/November_3" id="w">November 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/1979" id="w">1979</a>, members of the <a href="/wiki/Communist_Workers_Party_(U.S.)" id="w">Communist Workers Party (CWP)</a> were holding an anti-<a href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan" id="w">Ku Klux Klan</a> rally, when a group of KKK and <a href="/wiki/Neo-Nazis" id="w">neo-Nazis</a> caravaned into the Morningside Heights neighborhood where the rally was being held and ambushed the protest. Four local TV news stations filmed the event as it happened. The Klansmen/Nazis (members of the recently formed United Racist Front) allegedly were given directions and a parade permit by an undercover agent of the <a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol%2C_Tobacco_and_Firearms" id="w">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</a> who attended Klan meetings and (it is widely believed) acted as the final impetus for the violent clash.{{Fact}} The alleged actions of the BATF agent, as well as the evidence of other government informers who worked with the Klan at the time, have led to allegations of city/state/federal wrongdoing by members of the CWP.{{Fact}}  Although a pistol likely was fired by a CWP organizer (allegedly into the air) and the Klan caravan was beaten with sticks prior to stopping, only the anti-Klan protesters were injured and killed.{{Fact}} Five CWP members died and seven were wounded. Television footage of the event was shown nationwide, and the event became known as the <a href="/wiki/Greensboro_Massacre" id="w">Greensboro Massacre</a>. The accused Klansman and neo-Nazis all were acquitted by an all-white jury in two separate criminal trials. In 1985, a civil suit found five police officers and two other individuals liable for $350,000 in damages to be paid to the Greensboro Justice Fund.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Southside Neighborhood in downtown Greensboro</div></div>
 Southside is among the oldest neighborhoods in the city and has experienced major redevelopment. </p>
<p>The Aycock and Fisher Park neighborhoods were established in 1895 and 1901, respectively. The Aycock neighborhood features large Queen Anne residences of the turn-of-the-twentieth century, as well as Foursquare, Craftsman, and Colonial Revival styles.</p>
<p>Irving Park, developed in 1911 around the golf course of the Greensboro Country Club, was modelled on nearby <a href="/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort" id="w">Pinehurst</a> by designer John Nolan. The prestigious neighborhood includes large homes on ample lots, and remains popular today.</p>
<p>The urbanization of Greensboro during the early twentieth century was influenced greatly by the popularity of the automobile, which enabled citizens to live farther from the city center in more suburban surroundings. A series of &#34;streetcar suburbs&#34; were established, including Latham Park, Sunset Hills, Lindley Park, Hamilton Lakes, Starmount, Lake Daniel, Rankin, O. Henry Oaks, and Glenwood. Many of these neighborhoods include some of the city&#39;s finest public parks. Recent neighborhood additions include sprawling large-scale planned unit developments such as Adams Farm, Lake Jeanette, The Cardinal, New Irving Park, and Reedy Fork Ranch.</p>

<p>Greensboro is located at {{coor dms}} (36.079868, -79.819416).{{GR}}</p>
<p>According to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau" id="w">United States Census Bureau</a>, the city has a total area of 109.2&#160;<a href="/wiki/Square_mile" id="w">square miles</a> (283.0&#160;<a href="/wiki/Km%C2%B2" id="w">km²</a>), of which, 104.7&#160;square miles (271.2&#160;km²) of it is land and 4.5&#160;square miles (11.8&#160;km²) of it (4.16%) is water.</p>
<p>Greensboro is situated among the gently rolling hills of North Carolina&#39;s Piedmont and is situated midway between the state&#39;s Blue Ridge and Great Smokey mountains to the west and Atlantic beaches and Outer Banks to the east. The view of the city from its highest building&#8212;the Lincoln Financial tower&#8212;reveals that the town is populated with large numbers of green trees, lending perhaps another dimension of significance to its name. The city is at the nexus of several major freeways, with Interstates 40, 85, and the planned <a href="/wiki/Interstate_73" id="w">I-73</a> passing through its borders.</p>

<a id="Asian_American_Community" name="Asian_American_Community"></a><h3>Asian American Community</h3>
<p>About 4,000 <a href="/wiki/Vietnamese_people" id="w">Vietnamese</a> have resettled in the Greensboro area since 1979 as refugees or secondary migrants. They are a diverse population culturally, ethnically, and religiously, and not organized through any broad based structure. The <a href="/wiki/Degar" id="w">Montagnards</a> (French for &#34;mountain people&#34;) are immigrants from a number of different tribes from the Highlands of <a href="/wiki/Vietnam" id="w">Vietnam</a>. They had been isolated mountain farmers and hunter-gatherers until the Vietnam War, when the U.S. government recruited them as front-line soldiers for the U.S. Army Special Forces. About 5,000 of the Motagnards have settled in Guilford County making it the largest Montagnard community in the world outside Vietnam. A few hundred Nung, a tribal group from northern Vietnam, also have resettled in the city and are often grouped with the Montagnard tribes. </p>
<p>In the early 1980s, the first <a href="/wiki/Cambodian" id="w">Cambodian</a> refugees resettled in Greensboro. The stable community of about 60 large families, representing about 500 people, are closely affiliated with the Greensboro <a href="/wiki/Buddhist" id="w">Buddhist</a> Center. An additional 800 former Cambodians live around the Triad including a large population in nearby <a href="/wiki/Davidson_County" id="w">Davidson County</a>. </p>
<p>Greensboro was not an initial resettlement area for Laotians. However, since the mid 1980s, many families have come as secondary migrants from other states, and now the Laotian population is stabilized at about 1000 people. A few families of hill tribe refugees from <a href="/wiki/Laos" id="w">Laos</a>, mostly <a href="/wiki/Hmong_people" id="w">Hmong</a>, live in Guilford County, plus more than 50 college students attending the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). Other Laotian hill tribe populations that have relocated to th Greensboro area include approximately 200 <a href="/wiki/Khmu" id="w">Khmu</a> refugees as well as smaller groups representing other tribes. About 2,000 Korean immigrants, many well established, are represented in Guilford County. The local Chinese Association, comprised primarily of mainland Chinese, has a few hundred members. Ethnic Chinese living in Greesboro number in the thousands.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">Indian</a> immigrant population, estimated to be more than 2,000, is well established in the Greensboro area and has a long history there. Many Indian immigrants are associated with the city&#39;s university and medical communities and have formed multiple community organizations. There are an estimated 600 <a href="/wiki/Pakistanis" id="w">Pakistanis</a> living in the area, as well as an estimated 1,000 <a href="/wiki/Palestinians" id="w">Palestinians</a>, with additional thousands in the greater Piedmont Triad region. (Many Palestinians relocated to the area following the war in 1967.) A few hundred <a href="/wiki/Israeli" id="w">Israeli</a> nationals also have relocated to the Triad, particularly for international business purposes.</p>
<a id="African_American_Community" name="African_American_Community"></a><h3>African American Community</h3>
<p>There are close to 15,000 people from many of the 54 African nations living in and around Greensboro (however no official population numbers are available because the census categorizes these people as African-American or Black). About 10 percent of Guilford County&#39;s African population immigrated as refugees. The African Services Coalition, a nonprofit organization composed of representatives from different African communities, seeks to foster cooperation between the various communities. Some communities have roots at N.C. A&#38;T State University that date from the 1960s, when the university first was recognized as a valuable educational resource by developing countries. The Nigerian population is an older, well-established community believed to be the largest African community in the area, numbering about 3,500 persons, including second and third generations and reflecting a variety of religious and tribal traditions. </p>
<p>Many of those of Nigerian lineage in Guilford County initially immigrated to New York, New Jersey or Washington D.C, then settled in the Greensboro area after obtaining official immigration status. Guilford County has a multigenerational Ghanaian-heritage population consisting of approximately 450 people. The few new arrivals are mostly international students at area universities, or friends and family members of longer-term residents. A well established community of about 800 people of Sierra Leonese ancestry has made Guilford County its home. This population has not increased significantly in recent years because the temporary protective status that was at one time available to immigrants from their homeland has ended.</p>
<p>Greensboro&#39;s Sudanese population is a diverse population, with most individuals having come to Guilford County within the last five years, currently numbering more than 2,700. Many of these immigrants are fleeing the long-standing Sudanese civil war. A group of young Sudanese from the south, commonly referred to as the &#34;Lost Boys&#34;, have resettled recently in Greensboro as refugees. The majority of the areas Sudanese, however, are from the Muslim northern region of that country. In the last year, many of the Sudanese have become U.S. citizens, which has enabled them to relocate additional family members from the Sudan, yielding a population increase of several hundred in the community within the last year.</p>
<p>There are approximately 400 refugees from <a href="/wiki/Somalia" id="w">Somalia</a> who have arrived in Greensboro within the last six years, including Benadir from the city of Mogadishu and newly arriving refugees from the Bantu tribe. There are an estimated 1,200 Liberians settled in Guilford County. This population includes some refugees who are recent arrivals, and others who have lived in Guilford County for many years. In the last couple of years, a few hundred Liberian refugees who had been living in refugee camps in the <a href="/wiki/Ivory_Coast" id="w">Ivory Coast</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ghana" id="w">Ghana</a> have resettled in Guilford County.</p>
<a id="Eastern_European_American_Community" name="Eastern_European_American_Community"></a><h3>Eastern European American Community</h3>
<p>New residents also have arrived from Eastern Europe, from the former <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" id="w">Yugoslavia</a> (including Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia), and others from former Yugoslavia that have immigrated since 1994 as refugees, about 2,000 people. Greensboro has become a resettlement site in the past few years for approximately 250 Russian and Ukrainian Jewish refugees.</p>
<a id="Latin_American_Community" name="Latin_American_Community"></a><h3>Latin American Community</h3>
<p>According to the 2002 and 2003 estimates of the Latino population in Guilford County (published by Faith Action Inc.), there was a 4% increase in Latino population between those years, and in 2003 the population was estimated to be 26,981. Although there were not follow up studies using this method, we can estimate that, if the population has continued to increase by 4% annually, the current Latino community would number approximately 29,182. Other studies indicate the rate of increase may be even greater. More than two thirds of the area&#39;s Latino immigrants are from Mexico, though it is thought that all 26 Latin American countries are represented in the region. Most Latino  residents have arrived since 1990, and their arrival is expected to continue and increase as long as economic opportunities prevail. </p>
