<p><b>Sarah Trimmer</b> (<i><a href="/wiki/N%C3%A9e" id="w">née</a></i> Kirby) (<a href="/wiki/6_January" id="w">6 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1741" id="w">1741</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/15_December" id="w">15 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1810" id="w">1810</a>) was a noted writer and critic of British <a href="/wiki/Children%26%2339%3Bs_literature" id="w">children&#39;s literature</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Eighteenth_century" id="w">eighteenth century</a>. Her periodical, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian_of_Education" id="w">The Guardian of Education</a></i>, helped to define the emerging genre by seriously reviewing children&#39;s literature for the first time; it also provided the first history of children&#39;s literature, establishing a canon of the early landmarks of the genre that scholars still use today. Trimmer&#39;s most popular children&#39;s book, <i><a href="/wiki/Fabulous_Histories" id="w">Fabulous Histories</a></i>, inspired numerous children&#39;s animal stories and remained in print for over a century.</p>
<p>Trimmer was an active philanthropist as well as author; she founded several <a href="/wiki/Sunday_school" id="w">Sunday schools</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charity_school" id="w">charity schools</a> in her parish. To further these educational projects, she not only wrote textbooks but she also penned manuals for other women interested in starting their own schools. Trimmer&#39;s efforts inspired other women, such as <a href="/wiki/Hannah_More" id="w">Hannah More</a>, to establish Sunday school programs and to write for children and the poor.</p>
<p>Trimmer was in many ways dedicated to maintaining the social and political status quo in her works. As a <a href="/wiki/High_church" id="w">high church</a> <a href="/wiki/Anglican" id="w">Anglican</a>, she was intent on promoting the Established Church of Britain and on teaching young children and the poor the doctrines of <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a>. Her writings outlined the benefits of social hierarchies, arguing that each class should remain in its God-given position. Yet, while supporting many of the traditional political and social ideologies of her time, Trimmer questioned others, such as those surrounding gender and the family.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Trimmer was born on <a href="/wiki/6_January" id="w">6 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1741" id="w">1741</a> in <a href="/wiki/Ipswich" id="w">Ipswich</a> to Joshua and Sarah (Bell) Kirby; her father was a noted artist and served as President of the <a href="/wiki/Society_of_Artists" id="w">Society of Artists</a>.  Trimmer had one younger brother, William; she was apparently the better writer, for she would sometimes compose his school essays for him.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> As a young girl, Trimmer attended Mrs. Justiner’s boarding school in Ipswich, an experience she always remembered fondly.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> In 1755, the family moved to <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> when her father, who had written several important works on <a href="/wiki/Perspective_(graphical)" id="w">perspective</a>, became the tutor of perspective to the Prince of Wales.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> Because of her father&#39;s connections within the artistic community, Trimmer was able to meet the painters <a href="/wiki/William_Hogarth" id="w">William Hogarth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Gainsborough" id="w">Thomas Gainsborough</a> as well as the by-then legendary writer and critic <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Johnson" id="w">Samuel Johnson</a>. She made a favorable impression on Johnson when she immediately produced her pocket copy of <a href="/wiki/John_Milton" id="w">John Milton&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Paradise_Lost" id="w">Paradise Lost</a></i> (1667) to help settle a dispute between her father and Johnson over a particular passage. Johnson, delighted that she admired Milton enough to carry his works with her at all times, &#34;subsequently invited her to his house and presented her with a volume of his famous periodical <i><a href="/wiki/The_Rambler" id="w">The Rambler</a></i>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> In 1759, at the urging of his former pupil the Prince of Wales (soon to be <a href="/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">George III</a>), her father was made Clerk of the Works to the Royal Household at <a href="/wiki/Kew_Palace" id="w">Kew Palace</a> and the family moved to <a href="/wiki/Kew" id="w">Kew</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> There she met James Trimmer, whom she married on <a href="/wiki/21_September" id="w">21 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1762" id="w">1762</a>; after their marriage, the couple moved to <a href="/wiki/Brentford" id="w">Old Brentford</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

Trimmer was close to her parents; after her marriage, she walked to visit her father every day, later accompanied by her eldest children. She and her husband had twelve children in all—six boys and six girls. Trimmer was responsible for her children&#39;s education and it was the combination of her duties as a mother and a teacher that initially sparked her interest in education.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Raikes" id="w">Robert Raikes</a>, Trimmer also became active in the <a href="/wiki/Sunday_school" id="w">Sunday school</a> movement, founding the first Sunday school for poor children in Old Brentford in 1786. She and two of the ministers in her parish, Charles Sturgess and Charles Coates, organized a fund drive and established several schools for the poor children of the neighborhood.<sup id="_ref-Yarde31_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yarde31" title="">[8]</a></sup> Initially, five hundred boys and girls wanted to attend Trimmer&#39;s Sunday school; unable to accommodate such numbers, she decided to exclude those under five years of age and restricted each family to one pupil.<sup id="_ref-Yarde31_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yarde31" title="">[8]</a></sup> The parish set up three schools, each with about thirty students—one for older boys, one for younger boys and one for girls.<sup id="_ref-Yarde31_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yarde31" title="">[8]</a></sup> While some other educational reformers of the period such as <a href="/wiki/Mary_Wollstonecraft" id="w">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> argued for co-educational instruction, Trimmer was opposed to such pedagogical changes; she believed in educating the sexes separately.<sup id="_ref-Rodgers1189_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rodgers1189" title="">[9]</a></sup> The students were taught to read, with the aim of teaching them to read the Bible. The students were also encouraged to keep clean—&#34;a present of a brush and comb was given to all who desired them&#34;.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Trimmer&#39;s schools became so well-known and admired that Raikes, Trimmer&#39;s initial inspiration, recommended those who needed assistance organizing a Sunday school to turn to Trimmer; even <a href="/wiki/Queen_Charlotte" id="w">Queen Charlotte</a> asked Trimmer&#39;s advice on founding a Sunday school at Windsor.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>After her visit with the queen, Trimmer was inspired to write <i>The Œconomy of Charity</i>, which describes how readers, specifically women, can establish Sunday schools in their own communities.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> However, her book accomplished much more than this. While proponents of Sunday schools such as Raikes and Trimmer claimed that the schools would help control the growing social unrest of the poor, critics claimed that these schools would only encourage the social upheaval they were trying to quell.<sup id="_ref-Wills1578_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wills1578" title="">[13]</a></sup> The Hon. John Byng, for example, issued the dire warning that &#34;not only would education &#39;teach them to read seditious pamphlets, books and publications against Christianity&#39;… but it would render them unfit for &#39;the laborious employment to which their rank in society had destined them&#39;&#34;.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Trimmer agreed that the poor were &#34;destined&#34; by God to be poor but would argue that her schools reinforced that divine social hierarchy. The Sunday school debate was waged in churches, in Parliament and in print; in publishing <i>The Œconomy of Charity</i>, Trimmer was entering this vigorous debate. As scholar Deborah Wills has argued:</p>
<p>{{quote}}</p>
<p>For example, Trimmer contends that Sunday schools teach their pupils not merely to read the Bible but how to draw the proper theological and political conclusions from it.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Furthermore, Trimmer argues that the responsibility for educating the poor rests on the shoulders of the middle class alone. By eliminating the aristocracy from an active role in her philanthropic programs, &#34;Trimmer ensures that those who actually regulate the Sunday School curriculum are those who will both embody and perpetuate bourgeois culture”.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> As Wills points out, this distinguishes her from other philanthropists of the time such as <a href="/wiki/Hannah_More" id="w">Hannah More</a>.</p>

<p>Trimmer also founded and oversaw <a href="/wiki/Charity_school" id="w">charity schools</a> in her neighborhood. She directed promising students from her Sunday schools, which met only once a week, to these charity schools, which met several times a week. As she wrote in her journal, these schools seemed to her to &#34;afford a happy prospect of rescuing many poor children from vice and profligacy&#34;.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> While the Sunday schools were funded by subscription, that is, donations from people within the parish, the charity schools were largely funded by the <a href="/wiki/Society_for_Promoting_Christian_Knowledge" id="w">Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge</a> (SPCK), which had funded the first charity schools around a century earlier.<sup id="_ref-Yarde403_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yarde403" title="">[19]</a></sup> Trimmer criticized the rote learning that went on in traditional charity schools and tried to institute a more dynamic <a href="/wiki/Catechism" id="w">catechetical</a> method in her own schools that would stimulate students to ask questions.<sup id="_ref-Rodgers1189_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rodgers1189" title="">[9]</a></sup> She wrote in her journal, “my earnest desire is to compose a course of teaching for Charity Schools, by which the children may learn in reality, and not by rote, the principles of the Christian Religion, as taught in the Scriptures&#34;.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Trimmer also established schools of industry to which she directed her less promising pupils. These schools would teach girls, for example, how to knit and spin. Initially, Trimmer believed that the schools would turn a profit since the girls would spin and knit all day long; however, the girls were unskilled and turned out poor products that could not be sold. Trimmer viewed this project as a failure.<sup id="_ref-Yarde403_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Yarde403" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>William Keutsch, a modern scholar of the eighteenth century, has criticized Trimmer&#39;s projects as naive and moralistic:</p>
<p>{{quote}}</p>
<p>Although Sunday schools such as the ones established by Trimmer have often been characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle class to impose their morality on the lower classes, Thomas Laqueur has argued that the poor embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Literary_career" name="Literary_career"></a><h2>Literary career</h2>
<p>In a literary career that spanned more than a quarter of a century, Trimmer authored somewhere between thirty-three<sup id="_ref-Grenby89_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grenby89" title="">[22]</a></sup> and forty-four texts.<sup id="_ref-Heath385_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Heath385" title="">[23]</a></sup> She wrote in a wide range of genres: textbooks, teaching manuals, children&#39;s literature, political pamphlets and critical periodicals. While many of her texts were for children, some of her works, such as <i>The Œconomy of Charity</i>, were also for specific adult audiences. Still others were written for both children and adults, such as <i>The Servant’s Friend</i> (1786–7), which was meant to instruct servants of all ages.<sup id="_ref-Grenby89_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grenby89" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Throughout her career, Trimmer worked with four different publishers — John Marshall, T.N. Longman, G. Robinson, and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Johnson_(publisher)" id="w">Joseph Johnson</a> — and, by 1800, she had the most works of any author in the <a href="/wiki/John_Newbery" id="w">Newbery</a> catalogue, the catalogue that sold the most children&#39;s literature.<sup id="_ref-Grenby89_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grenby89" title="">[22]</a></sup> Eventually, Trimmer stopped publishing with Joseph Johnson, because she disagreed with his politics—he was a supporter of the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" id="w">French Revolution</a> and was publishing works that she considered subversive.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Title page from the first edition of <i>An Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature</i> (1780)</div></div>

Trimmer&#39;s first book was <i>An easy introduction to the knowledge of nature, and reading the holy scriptures, adapted to the capacities of children</i> (1780), which built on the revolution in children&#39;s literature begun by <a href="/wiki/Anna_Laetitia_Barbauld" id="w">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</a>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> In the &#34;Preface&#34;, Trimmer writes that <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Watts" id="w">Isaac Watts&#39;s</a> <i>Treatise on Education</i> was the inspiration for the work and that &#34;a book containing a kind of general survey of the works of Nature would be very useful, as a means to open the mind by gradual steps to the knowledge of the SUPREME BEING, preparatory to their reading the holy scriptures&#34;.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> In the text, the reader follows a mother and her two children, Charlotte and Henry (perhaps named after two of Trimmer&#39;s own children<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>), on a series of nature walks during which the mother describes the wonders of God&#39;s creation. In 1793, a version of this book was added to the catalogue of the <a href="/wiki/Society_for_Promoting_Christian_Knowledge" id="w">Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge</a>; after 77 years, it had sold over 750,000 copies.<sup id="_ref-Ruwe101_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ruwe101" title="">[28]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Aileen Fyfe, a historian interested in the relationship between science and religion, has argued that Trimmer&#39;s text, although inspired by Barbauld&#39;s books, differs dramatically from Barbauld&#39;s in its religious orientation. Barbauld was a <a href="/wiki/English_dissenter" id="w">Dissenter</a> and more inclined, according to Fyfe, to &#34;encourage curiosity, observation, and reasoning&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Fyfe469_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fyfe469" title="">[29]</a></sup> In contrast, Trimmer, as a <a href="/wiki/High_church" id="w">high church</a> <a href="/wiki/Anglicanism" id="w">Anglican</a>, depicted nature as &#34;awe-inspiring&#34; and as a reflection not only of God&#39;s divinity but also of his goodness.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> These beliefs are reflected even in the structure of the text; Trimmer&#39;s aim was to convey a sense of the awe, therefore her text does not progress in an orderly fashion through a study of the natural world. Barbauld&#39;s texts, however, emphasize the slow accumulation of knowledge as well as logical thinking. Thus <i>Evenings at Home</i>, which she co-wrote with her brother, John Aikin, has a &#34;systematic structure&#34;.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> Another difference between the two writers lies in the role of authority: whereas Barbauld&#39;s texts and those she wrote with her brother, emphasize dialogues between teacher and pupil, Trimmer&#39;s textual conversations, Fyfe notes, were &#34;controlled by the parent&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Fyfe469_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fyfe469" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, Donelle Ruwe, a scholar of eighteenth-century children&#39;s literature, has pointed out that <i>An Easy Introduction</i> is not entirely a conservative text—it challenges eighteenth-century notions of the proper roles for women laid out in conduct manuals such as those written by John Gregory and <a href="/wiki/James_Fordyce" id="w">James Fordyce</a>. The mother in Trimmer&#39;s text acts as a &#34;spiritual leader&#34; and demonstrates that a woman is capable of &#34;theological reasoning&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Ruwe101_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ruwe101" title="">[28]</a></sup> Such depictions challenge  <a href="/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" id="w">Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#39;s</a> claims that women are capable only of memorizing religious dogma and not of sophisticated reasoning. Furthermore, Trimmer&#39;s mother tries to educate her children in a straightforward manner instead of employing the &#34;manipulative&#34; tricks of the tutor in Rousseau&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Emile:_Or%2C_On_Education" id="w">Emile</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Ruwe101_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ruwe101" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>A few years later, inspired by <a href="/wiki/Madame_de_Genlis" id="w">Madame de Genlis&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Ad%C3%A8le_et_Th%C3%A9odore" id="w">Adèle et Théodore</a></i> (1782), Trimmer commissioned sets of illustrations of the Bible for which she provided the commentary; she also published print/commentary sets of ancient history and British history. These various sets were very popular and could be purchased together (commentary and prints) or individually. The prints were usually hung on walls or bound into books.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Books_for_charity_schools" name="Books_for_charity_schools"></a><h3>Books for charity schools</h3>
<p>Because, in Trimmer&#39;s opinion, there was a dearth of good educational material to use in charity schools, she decided to write her own. The series of books she produced between 1786 and 1798 were used in Britain and its colonies well into the nineteenth century.<sup id="_ref-Heath385_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Heath385" title="">[23]</a></sup> Trimmer was a savvy promoter of her materials; she knew that her books would not reach large numbers of poor children in charity schools unless they were funded and publicized by the <a href="/wiki/Society_for_Promoting_Christian_Knowledge" id="w">SPCK</a>. She wrote in her journal “my scheme without its aid, will fall to the ground&#34;.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Thus, she joined the society in 1787. In 1793, she sent twelve copies of her treatise <i>Reflections upon the Education in Charity Schools with the Outlines of a Plan Appropriate Instruction for the Children of the Poor</i> to the subcommittee that chose the books funded by the organization. In the treatise, she argued that the current charity school curriculum was outdated (it was over 100 years old) and needed to be replaced. She suggested a list of seven books that she herself would write:
</p><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>A Spelling Book in two Parts</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>Scripture Lessons from the Old Testament</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>Scripture Lessons from the New Testament</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>Moral Instructions from the Scriptures</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>Lessons on the Liturgy from the Book of Common Prayer</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>Exemplary Tales</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd>
<ul>
<li>The Teacher&#39;s Assistant</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>The committee largely accepted her proposal.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> The <i>Charity School Spelling Book</i> was printed first and was the most widely-used. It was one of the first children&#39;s books for the poor that was small but still had large type and large margins (features often considered appropriate only for books for more privileged readers). The stories themselves were also innovative: they emphasized the ordinary lives of ordinary children—&#34;these children climbed trees, played with fire, threw cricket bats at sheep and begged in the streets&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Heath3923_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Heath3923" title="">[35]</a></sup> The book was adopted by <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Bell_(educationalist)" id="w">Andrew Bell</a> around 1800 for his <a href="/wiki/Bell-Lancaster_method" id="w">Madras</a> system of education and by various educational societies throughout Britain and its colonies; it was even used to educate adult slaves in Antigua and Jamaica.<sup id="_ref-Heath3923_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Heath3923" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>The proposed &#34;Scripture Lessons&#34; became Trimmer&#39;s <i>An Abridgement of Scripture History, consisting of Lessons selected from the Old Testament, for the Use of Schools and Families</i> which was an anthology of selections from the Bible. Like the <i>Charity School Spelling Book</i>, it was adopted throughout the British educational system and was part of school life well into the mid-nineteenth century. In 1798 SPCK published <i>Scripture Catechisms, Part I and II</i>; these works were intended to aid the teacher while the <i>Abridgements</i> (a short-hand name for the <i>Scripture Histories</i> of both the Old and New Testament that Trimmer eventually published) were intended to aid the pupil. The &#34;Exemplary Tales&#34; seem not to have been written exactly as planned but Trimmer&#39;s <i>Servant&#39;s Friend</i> and <i>Two Farmers</i> fulfilled the purpose she outlined in her plan of publishing pleasurable moral tales. These two books served as Sunday school prizes as well. <i>The Teacher&#39;s Assistant</i> was an instruction aid and was also widely adopted throughout British schools. The only texts not published by the SPCK were Trimmer&#39;s adaptations and commentaries on the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, which she had printed elsewhere.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

<a id="''Fabulous_Histories''" name="''Fabulous_Histories''"></a><h3>&#39;&#39;Fabulous Histories&#39;&#39;</h3>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Fabulous_Histories" id="w">Fabulous Histories</a></i> (later known as <i>The Story of the Robins</i>), Trimmer&#39;s most popular work, was first published in 1786, and remained in print until the beginning of the twentieth century.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> It tells the story of two families, a robin family and a human family, who learn to live together congenially. Most importantly, the human children and the baby robins must learn to adopt virtue and to shun vice. For Trimmer, practicing kindness to animals as a child would hopefully lead one to &#34;universal benevolence&#34; as an adult. According to Samuel Pickering, Jr., a scholar of eighteenth-century children&#39;s literature, “in its depiction of eighteenth-century attitudes toward animals, Mrs. Trimmer’s <i>Fabulous Histories</i> was the most representative children’s book of the period&#34;.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup>  The text expresses most of the themes that would come to dominate Trimmer&#39;s later works, such as her emphasis on retaining social hierarchies; as Tess Cosslett, a scholar of children&#39;s literature explains, “the notion of hierarchy that underpins <i>Fabulous Histories</i> is relatively stable and fixed. Parents are above children in terms of authority, and humans above animals, in terms both of dominion and compassion: poor people should be fed before hungry animals… [but] the hierarchical relation of men and women is not so clearly enforced.&#34;<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Moira Ferguson, a scholar of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, places these themes in a larger historical context, arguing that &#34;the fears of the author and her class about an industrial revolution in ascendance and its repercussions are evident. Hence, [the] text attacks cruelty to birds and animals while affirming British aggression abroad.  …The text subtly opts for conservative solutions: maintenance of order and established values, resignation and compliance from the poor at home, expatriation for foreigners who do not assimilate easily.”<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> A second overarching theme in the text is rationality; Trimmer expresses the common fear of the power of fiction in her preface, explaining to her childish readers that her <a href="/wiki/Fable" id="w">fable</a> is not real and that animals cannot <i>really</i> speak.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Like many social critics during the eighteenth century, Trimmer was concerned about fiction&#39;s potentially damaging impact on young readers. With the rise of the <a href="/wiki/Novel" id="w">novel</a> and its concomitant private reading, there was a great fear that young people and especially women would read racy and adventurous stories without the knowledge of their parents and, perhaps even more worrisome, interpret the books as they pleased. Trimmer therefore always referred to her text as <i>Fabulous Histories</i> and never as <i>The Story of the Robins</i> in order to emphasize its reality; moreover, she did not allow the book to be illustrated within her lifetime—pictures of talking birds would only have reinforced the paradox of the book (it was fiction parading as a history).<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Yarde has also speculated that most of the characters in the text are drawn from Trimmer&#39;s own acquaintances and family.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>

<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Later in her life, Trimmer published the influential <i>Guardian of Education</i> (June 1802 &#8211; September 1806), which included ideas for instructing children and reviews of contemporary children&#39;s books.<sup id="_ref-Grenby10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Grenby10" title="">[44]</a></sup> Although one previous attempt had been made to regularly review children&#39;s books in Britain,<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> according to Matthew Grenby, &#34;it was a far less substantial and sustained enterprise than Trimmer’s&#34;.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> The <i>Guardian</i> included not only reviews of children&#39;s books but also extracts from texts Trimmer thought would edify her adult readers. She aimed “to assess the current state of educational policy and praxis in Britain and to shape its future direction&#34;.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> To do so, she evaluated the educational theories of <a href="/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" id="w">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" id="w">John Locke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mary_Wollstonecraft" id="w">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hannah_More" id="w">Hannah More</a>, <a href="/wiki/Madame_de_Genlis" id="w">Madame de Genlis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Lancaster" id="w">Joseph Lancaster</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Bell_(educationalist)" id="w">Andrew Bell</a>, among others. In her “Essay on Christian Education,” also published separately later, she proposed her own comprehensive educational program.</p>
<p>Trimmer took her reviewing very seriously and her over 400 reviews constitute a set of distinct values.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> As Grenby puts it, &#34;her initial questions of any children’s books that came before her were always first, was it damaging to religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established social hierarchy&#34;.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> Religion was always Trimmer&#39;s first priority and her emphasis on <a href="/wiki/Biblical_inerrancy" id="w">Biblical inerrancy</a> illustrates her fundamentalism.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> She criticized books that included scenes of death, characters who were insane, and representations of sexuality, as well as books that might frighten children.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> She typically praised books that encouraged intellectual instruction, such as <a href="/wiki/Anna_Laetitia_Barbauld" id="w">Anna Barbauld&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Lessons_for_Children" id="w">Lessons for Children</a></i> (1778-79).</p>
<p>Trimmer&#39;s fundamentalism, Grenby argues, does not necessarily mark her as the rigid thinker that many critics have presumed her to be.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> Grenby points out that Trimmer, like Rousseau, believed children were naturally good; in this, she was arguing against centuries of tradition, particularly <a href="/wiki/Puritan" id="w">Puritanical</a> attitudes towards raising children.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> She also agreed with &#34;Rousseau’s key idea [while ironically attacking Rousseau&#39;s works themselves], later taken up by the Romantics, that children should not be forced to become adults too early&#34;.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>The Guardian of Education</i> established <a href="/wiki/Children%26%2339%3Bs_literature" id="w">children&#39;s literature</a> as a genre with her reviews. Moreover, in one of her early essays, “Observations on the Changes which have taken place in Books for Children and Young Persons&#34;, Trimmer wrote the first history of children&#39;s literature, setting out the first canon of children&#39;s literature. Its landmark books are still cited today by scholars as important in the development of the genre.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Fairy_tales" name="Fairy_tales"></a><h4>Fairy tales</h4>
<p>Trimmer is perhaps most famous now for her condemnation of <a href="/wiki/Fairy_tales" id="w">fairy tales</a>, such as the various translations of <a href="/wiki/Charles_Perrault" id="w">Charles Perrault&#39;s</a> <i>Histoires ou Contes du Temps passé</i> (originally published in 1697), because they endorsed an irrational view of the world and suggested that children could become successful too easily (in other words, they did not have to work).<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> Chapbooks were the literature of the poor and Trimmer was attempting to separate children&#39;s literature from texts she associated with the lower classes; she also feared that children might gain access to this cheap literature without their parents&#39; knowledge.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> Trimmer criticized the values associated with fairy tales, accusing them of perpetuating superstition and unfavorable images of step-parents.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> Rather than seeing Trimmer as a censor of fairy tales, therefore, Nicholas Tucker has argued, &#34;by considering fairy tales as fair game for criticism rather than unthinking worship, Mrs Trimmer is at one with scholars today who have also written critically about the ideologies found in some individual stories&#34;.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the reasons Trimmer believed fairy tales were dangerous was because they led child readers into a fantasy world where adults could not follow and control their exposure to harmful experiences.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> She was just as horrified by the graphic illustrations included with some fairy tale collections, complaining that &#34;little children, whose minds are susceptible of every impression; and who from the liveliness of their imaginations are apt to convert into realities whatever forcibly strikes their fancy&#34; should not be allowed to see such scenes as <a href="/wiki/Bluebeard" id="w">Blue Beard</a> hacking his wife&#39;s head off.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<a id="French_revolution_and_religion" name="French_revolution_and_religion"></a><h4>French revolution and religion</h4>
<p>In the pages of <i>The Guardian of Education</i>, Trimmer denounced the <a href="/wiki/French_revolution" id="w">French revolution</a> and the philosophers whose works she believed underpinned it, particularly <a href="/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" id="w">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>. She argued that there was a vast conspiracy, organized by the atheistic and democratic revolutionaries of France, to overthrow the legitimate governments of Europe. These conspirators were attempting to overturn traditional society by &#34;endeavouring to infect the minds of the rising generation, through the medium of <i>Books of Education</i> and <i>Children&#39;s Books</i>&#34; (emphasis Trimmer&#39;s).<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> Her views were shaped by <a href="/wiki/Abb%C3%A9_Barruel" id="w">Abbé Barruel&#39;s</a> <i>Memoirs, Illustrating the History of Jacobinism</i> (1797–8) (she extracted large sections from this text into the <i>Guardian</i> itself) but also by her fears of <a href="/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars" id="w">the ongoing wars between France and Britain during the 1790s</a>.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> Trimmer emphasized Christianity above all in her writings and maintained that one should to turn to God in times of trial. As M. Nancy Cutt argues in her book on children&#39;s literature, Trimmer and writers like her &#34;claimed emphatically that the degree of human happiness was in direct proportion to the degree of submission to the divine Will. Thus they repudiated the moralists’ view that learning should exalt reason and work to the temporal happiness of the individual, which was governed by the best interests of society&#34;.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> Trimmer and her allies contended that French pedagogical theories led to an immoral nation, specifically, &#34;deism, infidelity and revolution&#34;.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Bell_vs._Lancasterian_school_system_debate" name="Bell_vs._Lancasterian_school_system_debate"></a><h3>Bell vs. Lancasterian school system debate</h3>
<p>In 1789, <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Bell_(educationalist)" id="w">Andrew Bell</a> invented the <a href="/wiki/Bell-Lancaster_method" id="w">Madras</a> system of education to order to instruct British colonial subjects in <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>; it was a disciplinary system which employed a hierarchy of student monitors and very few teachers (economical for the colonies, Bell argued). He published a book, <i>Experiment in Education</i> (1797), in order to explain his system, one that he thought could be adapted for the poor in England (in it he endorsed many of Trimmer&#39;s own books). A year after reading the <i>Experiment</i>, an English <a href="/wiki/Quaker" id="w">Quaker</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Lancaster" id="w">Joseph Lancaster</a>, adopted many of its principles for his school in London and then published his own book, <i>Improvements in Education</i> (1803), which repeated many of Bell&#39;s ideas. Because of his Quaker sympathies, Lancaster did not encourage the teaching of the doctrines of Britain&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Anglicanism" id="w">Established Church</a>.<sup id="_ref-Darton15960_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Darton15960" title="">[66]</a></sup> Trimmer, appalled by the suggestion that British children did not need to be brought up within the Established Church, wrote and published her <i>Comparative View</i> of the two systems in 1805, creating a schism between two very similar systems. According to F. J. Harvey Darton, an early scholar of children&#39;s literature, “her effect upon English education… was very considerable, even extraordinary. The two rival systems, Bell’s and Lancaster’s, were hotly debated all over the country, and the war between Bell and the Dragon, as a cartoonist labelled it, raged in all the magazines, even in the <i><a href="/wiki/Edinburgh_Review" id="w">Edinburgh Review</a></i>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Darton15960_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Darton15960" title="">[66]</a></sup> Out of the debate “arose the two great societies – the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Children of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church, and the British and Foreign School Society – upon whose work, fundamentally, the whole of [Britain&#39;s] later elementary school system was based&#34;.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>

<p>Trimmer&#39;s husband died in 1792; this affected her quite deeply, as is evidenced in her journal. In 1800, she and some of her daughters were forced to move to another house in <a href="/wiki/Brentford" id="w">Brentford</a>. This was painful for Trimmer, who wrote in her diary:</p>

<a id="Reception_and_legacy" name="Reception_and_legacy"></a><h2>Reception and legacy</h2>
<p>Trimmer&#39;s most popular book, <i>Fabulous Histories</i>, was reprinted for at least 133 years and had a profound impact on generations of readers and writers.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> In 1877, when the firm of Griffith and Farran published it as part of their &#34;Original Juvenile Library,&#34; they advertised it as &#34;the delicious story of Dicksy, Flapsy, and Pecksy, who can have forgotten it? It is as fresh today as it was half a century ago.&#34;<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> Tess Cosslett has also suggested that the names of Trimmer&#39;s birds—Dicksy, Pecksy, Flapsy and Robin—bear a striking resemblance to the rabbits—Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter—in <a href="/wiki/Beatrix_Potter" id="w">Beatrix Potter&#39;s</a> children&#39;s books.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> Trimmer also influenced the children&#39;s writers of her own age; <a href="/wiki/William_Godwin" id="w">William Godwin&#39;s</a> <i>Fables, Ancient and  Modern</i> (1805), for example, imitates Trimmer&#39;s <i>Ladder to Learning</i>.<sup id="_ref-Ruwe34_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ruwe34" title="">[72]</a></sup> </p>
<p>While Trimmer was highly respected for her charity work during her lifetime and for her books long after her death, her reputation began to wane at the end of the nineteenth century and plummeted during the twentieth century. One reason for this is that her textbooks, so widely used during the first half of the century, were replaced by secular books in the second half of the century.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> The tone of her books was no longer seen as consonant with British society. An early scholar of children&#39;s literature, Geoffrey Summerfield, describes her this way: “Of all the morally shrill women active in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, she was probably the shrillest. Unbalanced, frenetic, paranoid, she may have been, but no one could deny her energy and perseverance in defending the souls of the children of England from the assaults of the devil.”<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> Recently, however, children&#39;s literature scholars have attempted to view eighteenth-century children&#39;s literature within its historical context rather than judge it against modern tastes; scholars such as Grenby, Ruwe, Ferguson, Fyfe and Cosslett have reassessed Trimmer&#39;s work. Because Trimmer does not fit the mold of twentieth-century feminism — that is, since she did not rebel against the social mores of her society as did <a href="/wiki/Mary_Wollstonecraft" id="w">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> — she did not attract the attention of early feminist scholars.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> However, as Ruwe points out, “by the confluence of political, historical, and pedagogical events at the turn of the century, a woman such as Trimmer was able to gain a greater visibility in the realm of public letters than was perhaps typical before or after&#34;;<sup id="_ref-Ruwe34_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ruwe34" title="">[72]</a></sup> Trimmer was a &#34;role model for other women authors&#34;, and these later authors often acknowledged their debt explicitly, as did the author of <i>The Footsteps to Mrs. Trimmer’s Sacred History</i>.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup></p>

<p>There is no good biography of Trimmer. Many of the same details of her life, drawn primarily from her son Henry Scott Trimmer&#39;s account of her life attached to her journal, are repeated in Balfour, Grenby, Rodgers, Schnorrenberg, Wills and Yarde.
