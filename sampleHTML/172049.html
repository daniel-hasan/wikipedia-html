<p><b>Adrian Malcolm Conan Doyle</b> (<a href="/wiki/November_19" id="w">November 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1910" id="w">1910</a> - <a href="/wiki/June_3" id="w">June 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>) was the youngest son of <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle" id="w">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, and his father&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Literary_executor" id="w">literary executor</a>.  Adrian Doyle was described as a race-car driver, big-game hunter, explorer, and writer.  He was born in <a href="/wiki/Crowborough" id="w">Crowborough</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> and died in <a href="/wiki/Geneva" id="w">Geneva</a>, <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>. His wife&#39;s name was Anna. He was the founder of the Arthur Conan Doyle Foundation in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Either alone or with the assistance of <a href="/wiki/John_Dickson_Carr" id="w">John Dickson Carr</a>, Adrian Doyle produced additional <a href="/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes" id="w">Sherlock Holmes</a> stories.  The basis of his production was to complete the tales referenced in his father&#39;s stories, but which his father had never written.   These Sherlock Holmes tales were written in <a href="/wiki/1952" id="w">1952</a> and <a href="/wiki/1953" id="w">1953</a>, but have been republished subsequently. In <a href="/wiki/1954" id="w">1954</a> a hard cover collection of the stories was published, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Exploits_of_Sherlock_Holmes" id="w">The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/List_of_authors_of_new_Sherlock_Holmes_stories" id="w">Other authors</a> have also written Sherlock Holmes stories based on the same references within the original tales.  </p>

<p>On September 12, 1942, the <a href="/wiki/Associated_Press" id="w">Associated Press</a> announced that an authentic, unpublished Sherlock Holmes story had been found by Adrian Conan Doyle. Written in his father&#39;s uniquely neat handwriting, the story was buried in a chest that contained family documents.  Adrian Conan Doyle refused to publish it. A month later, the <a href="/wiki/Baker_Street_Irregulars" id="w">Baker Street Irregulars</a> wrote a letter to the <a href="/wiki/Saturday_Review_of_Literature" id="w">Saturday Review of Literature</a>, insisting that the story be published. In the United States, <i><a href="/wiki/Cosmopolitan_(magazine)" id="w">Cosmopolitan</a></i> magazine obtained it and published it in their August 1948 issue under the uncharacteristic title <i>The Case of the Man who was Wanted</i>. It was also published in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>&#39;s <i>Sunday Dispatch</i> magazine the following January. Sherlockian <a href="/wiki/Vincent_Starrett" id="w">Vincent Starrett</a> doubted that the story was written by the elder Doyle and suggested that Adrian was the author. In September 1945, a letter was received by <a href="/wiki/Hesketh_Pearson" id="w">Hesketh Pearson</a>, a biographer of Arthur Conan Doyle. The letter stated, &#34;My pride is not unduly hurt by your remark that &#39;The Man who was Wanted&#39; is certainly not up to scratch for the sting is much mitigated by your going on to remark that it carries the authentic trade&#8211;mark! This, I feel, is a great compliment to my one and only effort at plagiarism.&#34; The letter was written by an <a href="/wiki/Architect" id="w">architect</a> named Arthur Whitaker. He had sent the story to Arthur Conan Doyle in 1911 with a suggestion that they publish it as a joint collaboration. Doyle refused, but sent Whitaker a check for £10 in payment for the story. Whitaker retained a carbon copy. After seeing it attributed in the <i>Sunday Dispatch</i> to Arthur Conan Doyle, Whitaker wrote a letter to Denis Conan Doyle explaining the true authorship. Denis forwarded the letter to his brother Adrian, who became angry, demanded proof, and threatened legal action. In 1949, the Doyles admitted, after seeing the carbon copy and listening to people who had read it in 1911, that Whitaker was the author. The story, which was thought by many people to be the work of Arthur Conan Doyle, has been published recently in the collection <i>The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
