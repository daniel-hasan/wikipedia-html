<p>The <b>Blob</b> (<b>Frederick J. Dukes</b>) is a <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Comics" id="w">Marvel Comics</a> <a href="/wiki/Supervillain" id="w">supervillain</a>, an adversary of the <a href="/wiki/X-Men" id="w">X-Men</a>. Created by writer <a href="/wiki/Stan_Lee" id="w">Stan Lee</a> and artist/co-writer <a href="/wiki/Jack_Kirby" id="w">Jack Kirby</a>, he first appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/Uncanny_X-Men" id="w">X-Men</a></i> #3 (<a href="/wiki/1964#January" id="w">January 1964</a>).</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)" id="w">mutant</a>, the Blob claims to be unmovable. He possesses an extreme amount of pliable body mass, which grants him superhuman strength and his own <a href="/wiki/Gravitation" id="w">gravitational pull</a>. Possessing the mindset of a bully, he mostly uses his powers for petty crime and as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Mutants" id="w">Brotherhood of Mutants</a> and <a href="/wiki/Freedom_Force_(comics)" id="w">Freedom Force</a>.</p>
<p>He is one of the most prominent, long-running mutants to be de-powered as a result of the <i><a href="/wiki/Decimation_(comics)" id="w">Decimation</a></i> storyline.</p>

<a id="Early_years" name="Early_years"></a><h2>Early years</h2>
<p>Born in <a href="/wiki/Lubbock%2C_Texas" id="w">Lubbock, Texas</a>, Fred J. Dukes starts out as a member of a <a href="/wiki/Circus" id="w">circus</a> <a href="/wiki/Sideshow" id="w">sideshow</a> under the name &#34;the Blob&#34;. He is contacted by <a href="/wiki/Professor_X" id="w">Charles Xavier</a>, who tells him that he (Dukes) is a mutant, and asks him to join the X-Men. At the mansion, the other X-Men dislike Dukes for his obnoxious attitude. The Blob refuses Xavier&#39;s invitation, saying he is better than the other X-Men. When Xavier tries erasing his mind of what has transpired, the Blob escapes. He gathers up the other Circus members and they attack the mansion. Xavier is able to wipe everyone&#39;s minds, and the Blob goes back to the circus.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Joining_the_Brotherhood" name="Joining_the_Brotherhood"></a><h2>Joining the Brotherhood</h2>
<p>The mutant <a href="/wiki/Magneto_(comics)" id="w">Magneto</a> soon seeks out the Blob to recruit him into his <a href="/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Mutants" id="w">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>, restoring his memory through a jarring blow to the head. The Blob temporarily accepts the invitation, but leaves when it is revealed that Magneto has no real concern for the Blob&#39;s safety.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> He teams up with <a href="/wiki/Unus_the_Untouchable" id="w">Unus</a>, who soon becomes his confidant.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The Blob also serves as a member of <a href="/wiki/Factor_Three" id="w">Factor Three</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> He briefly works as an operative for the <a href="/wiki/Secret_Empire" id="w">Secret Empire</a>, where he fights the <a href="/wiki/Beast_(comics)" id="w">Beast</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> With the reorganized Brotherhood, the Blob fights <a href="/wiki/Professor_X" id="w">Professor X</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Defenders_(comics)" id="w">Defenders</a>.

<p>He remains with the Brotherhood, becoming a special operative of the federal government when the Brotherhood is reformed as the government-sponsored <a href="/wiki/Freedom_Force_(comics)" id="w">Freedom Force</a>.

<p>After Freedom Force&#39;s dissolution, the Blob participates in other versions of the Brotherhood, including one led by <a href="/wiki/Toad_(comics)" id="w">Toad</a> and another led by Professor X; the Blob takes over as leader of the latter when Xavier leaves. </p>
<p>The psychic entity <a href="/wiki/Onslaught_(comics)" id="w">Onslaught</a> later recruits Blob, vastly upgrading his powers and abilities. During this time the Blob fights various members of <a href="/wiki/X-Force" id="w">X-Force</a> and is soundly defeated in each encounter. Months later, Dukes joins the new Brotherhood led once again by Mystique, alongside Toad, <a href="/wiki/Sabretooth_(comics)" id="w">Sabretooth</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Mastermind_(Martinique_Jason)" id="w">daughter</a> of the original <a href="/wiki/Mastermind_(Jason_Wyngarde)" id="w">Mastermind</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="/wiki/Exodus_(comics)" id="w">Exodus</a> recreates the Brotherhood of Mutants, Blob offers to join but is quickly dismissed by Exodus, who considers him useless. This is a major blow to Dukes&#39;s already weak self-esteem, for which he seeks the counsel of therapist <a href="/wiki/Sean_Garrison_(comics)" id="w">Sean Garrison</a>. After a session, Blob attacks the Xavier Institute, though he is defeated by the combined efforts of the <a href="/wiki/New_Mutants" id="w">New Mutants</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Hellions_(comics)" id="w">Hellions</a>. He is then arrested by <a href="/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D." id="w">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>.</p>
<a id="Post_M-Day" name="Post_M-Day"></a><h2>Post M-Day</h2>
<p>Due to the <a href="/wiki/Scarlet_Witch" id="w">Scarlet Witch</a>&#39;s depowering of 90% of Earth&#39;s mutants, the Blob is one of the <a href="/wiki/Decimation_(comics)" id="w">thousands to lose their power</a>, though his epidermis does not shrink to compensate for his loss of mass, leaving him with huge folds of loose skin. The depressed Blob attempts to commit <a href="/wiki/Suicide" id="w">suicide</a>, but his skin folds prevent him from cutting through to any major blood vessels on his throat.</p>
<p>Someone that resembles the Blob is seen apprehended by the <a href="/wiki/Thunderbolts_(comics)" id="w">Thunderbolts</a> and is seen in the <a href="/wiki/Folding_Castle" id="w">Folding Castle</a>&#39;s Detention Quadrant.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Blob later resurfaces as a member of the <a href="/wiki/X-Cell" id="w">X-Cell</a>, a group of depowered mutants who attack Mutant Town in defiance of the <a href="/wiki/Decimation_(comics)" id="w">Decimation</a>. After mistakenly getting into a fight with <a href="/wiki/Rictor" id="w">Rictor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jamie_Madrox" id="w">Multiple Man</a> and getting in a cheap shot on Rictor, he stole a car. With fellow X-Cell member, <a href="/wiki/Fatale_(comics)" id="w">Fatale</a>, he attempted to flee, eventually hitting an open manhole (left open earlier in the day by <a href="/wiki/Strong_Guy" id="w">Strong Guy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wolfsbane_(comics)" id="w">Wolfsbane</a>) and causing the car to crash leaving Blob hanging from the car. When both of them ran afoul of Marrow, Blob was thrown from the car.</p>
<a id="Powers_and_abilities" name="Powers_and_abilities"></a><h1>Powers and abilities</h1>
<p>Before being depowered, the Blob&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)" id="w">mutant</a> physiology grants him a number of advantages. He has superhuman strength and great resistance to physical injury due to a further mutation. The Blob&#39;s elastic, blubbery skin has proven to be difficult to penetrate by gunfire, missiles, and even <a href="/wiki/Wolverine_(comics)" id="w">Wolverine&#39;s</a> claws; though with sufficient force the claws can lacerate his flesh.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> On one occasion, a concentrated optic blast fired by <a href="/wiki/Cyclops_(comics)" id="w">Cyclops</a> is sufficient to puncture a hole through his shoulder, much to the shock of Dukes himself. He can also alter his personal mono-directional <a href="/wiki/Gravitation" id="w">gravity</a> field beneath himself to make himself virtually immovable as long as he is in contact with the ground, although an incredible force can uproot him, along with a chunk of whatever he is standing on. The only beings on record to have been able to move the Blob against his wishes are the <a href="/wiki/Hulk_(comics)" id="w">Hulk</a><sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Strong_Guy" id="w">Strong Guy</a> (powered-up near his limit by absorbing <a href="/wiki/Kinetic_energy" id="w">kinetic energy</a>),<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> although <a href="/wiki/Colossus_(comics)" id="w">Colossus</a> has managed to lift Dukes by digging underground and raising the piece of earth Dukes stands on, stating this as an exception to his immovability.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> Despite his morbidly obese appearance, the Blob&#39;s agility is that of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently catches his opponents by surprise.</p>
<p>The Blob&#39;s superhuman strength has greatly increased over the years, in a manner similar to that of the <a href="/wiki/Thing_(comics)" id="w">Thing</a>. This improvement is said to be a result of his ongoing mutation.</p>
<p>The Blob is vulnerable to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth and ears do not have the same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee is able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream.  On another occasion, <a href="/wiki/Sleepwalker_(comics)" id="w">Sleepwalker</a> defeats the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain.  Dukes can be incapacitated by drinking alcohol, although due to his immense mass, it requires a great amount.</p>
<a id="Other_versions" name="Other_versions"></a><h1>Other versions</h1>
<a id="''Age_of_Apocalypse''" name="''Age_of_Apocalypse''"></a><h2>&#39;&#39;Age of Apocalypse&#39;&#39;</h2>
<p>Blob appears briefly in the <i><a href="/wiki/Age_of_Apocalypse" id="w">Age of Apocalypse</a></i> as a test subject that <a href="/wiki/Henry_McCoy" id="w">Henry McCoy</a> was toying in the Breeding Pens in a direct violation of the Kelly Pact that <a href="/wiki/Apocalypse_(comics)" id="w">Apocalypse</a> signed in order to keep the Human High Council occupied and at bay while he rallied his forces.</p>
<p>McCoy considered Blob&#39;s mutation useless which enraged Blob. Dukes freed himself, and attacked his experimenter. <a href="/wiki/Havok_(comics)" id="w">Havoc</a> came to McCoy&#39;s rescue, but Dukes proved to be even too much for the Prelate to handle. His pseudo freedom was fleeting for moments later the head of the pens, Havoc&#39;s older brother <a href="/wiki/Cyclops_(comics)" id="w">Cyclops</a>, showed up to deliver a searing optic blast that would put him back in his place.</p>
<p>When the Age of Apocalypse was revisited in the 10th anniversary, Blob was a member of <a href="/wiki/Mister_Sinister" id="w">Sinister</a>&#39;s team known as <a href="/wiki/Sinister_Six" id="w">Sinister Six</a>. It appears that McCoy had his powers altered in a manner that allowed Blob to project his gravitational field outward. When the Sinister Six met the X-Men in battle, Dukes&#39; new powers were used to sweep the X-Men off their feet with the <a href="/wiki/Silver_Samurai" id="w">Silver Samurai</a> receiving a double dose. <a href="/wiki/Quicksilver_(comics)" id="w">Quicksilver</a> attempted to fell the behemoth with multiple punches, but Dukes remained standing regardless of how many hits he got in. It was not until <a href="/wiki/Rogue_(comics)" id="w">Rogue</a> stepped in with a punch that had the power necessary to overtake him that the mammoth would topple over. Following the Sinister Six&#39;s defeat, <a href="/wiki/Psylocke" id="w">Psylocke</a> was able to undo his mind control.</p>
<a id="''Cable_%26_Deadpool''" name="''Cable_%26_Deadpool''"></a><h2>&#39;&#39;Cable &#38; Deadpool&#39;&#39;</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cable_%26amp%3B_Deadpool" id="w">Deadpool&#39;s search for Cable</a> across alternate timelines forces an encounter with the Blob of &#34;an age of Apocalypse&#34; (not to be confused with the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Apocalypse" id="w">X-Men story arc of the same name</a>). In this reality, Blob has taken the mantle of Famine, one of the <a href="/wiki/Horsemen_of_Apocalypse#Other versions" id="w">Horsemen of Apocalypse</a>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<a id="%5B%5BHouse_of_M%5D%5D" name="%5B%5BHouse_of_M%5D%5D"></a><h2>[[House of M]]</h2>
<p>Blob is seen as a member of the Genoshan Black Ops version of the <a href="/wiki/Marauders_(comics)" id="w">Marauders</a>. It was later revealed that Dukes is a member of a NYPD strike team called the Brotherhood<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<a id="''Marvel_Zombies''" name="''Marvel_Zombies''"></a><h2>&#39;&#39;Marvel Zombies&#39;&#39;</h2>
<p>Blob appears twice in the <i><a href="/wiki/Marvel_Zombies" id="w">Marvel Zombies</a></i> universe. He is alive when first encountered, but being pursued by several zombie versions of Marvel characters, including Pyro and Toad. Later, he is revealed to have been similarly transformed, fighting alongside <a href="/wiki/Zombified" id="w">zombified</a> members of <a href="/wiki/Freedom_Force_(comics)" id="w">Freedom Force</a>.</p>
<a id="Ultimate_Blob" name="Ultimate_Blob"></a><h2>Ultimate Blob</h2>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Ultimate_Marvel" id="w">Ultimate Universe</a>, Blob is a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. His powers are similar to that of his <a href="/wiki/Earth-616" id="w">Earth-616</a> counterpart, although he has been moved by a helicopter during the <i><a href="/wiki/Weapon_X" id="w">Weapon X</a></i> saga, suggesting that he may be less powerful. He seems to eat constantly, and is often seen browsing the internet or chatting to people via instant messaging. One such incident sees the Blob pretend to be a model/physicist named Naomi, who <a href="/wiki/Cybersex" id="w">cyber-seduces</a> the X-Man <a href="/wiki/Beast_(comics)" id="w">Beast</a> — leading to the discovery of Magneto&#39;s survival and, eventually, to the <i><a href="/wiki/Ultimate_War" id="w">Ultimate War</a></i> saga. Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, the Ultimate version of Blob has threatened to eat his enemies.</p>
