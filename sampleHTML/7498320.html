<p>The Rus launched the first large-scale raid in 913. A fleet of 500 ships reached the southern shores of the Caspian Sea through the country of the Khazars. In order to secure a peaceful passage through the land of the Khazars, the Rus promised the Khazars half of their spoils. They sailed down the <a href="/wiki/Dnieper_River" id="w">Dnieper River</a> into the Black Sea, then into the <a href="/wiki/Sea_of_Azov" id="w">Sea of Azov</a>, then up the <a href="/wiki/Don_River_(Russia)" id="w">Don River</a> past the Khazar city of <a href="/wiki/Sarkel" id="w">Sarkel</a>, and then by a <a href="/wiki/Portage" id="w">portage</a> reached the Volga, which led them into the Caspian Sea.<sup id="_ref-Logan201_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Logan201" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Rus attacked in the <a href="/wiki/Gorgan" id="w">Gorgan</a> region around Abaskun, pillaging the countryside as they went. An attempt to repel them as they lay in anchor near islands in the southwestern part of the Caspian Sea proved unsuccessful; and they were then able to roam and raid at will.

Exhausted by the disease and the siege, the Rus &#34;left by night the fortress in which they had established their quarters, carrying on their backs all they could of their treasure, gems, and fine raiment, boys and girls as they wanted, and made for the Kura River, where the ships in which they had issued from their home were in readiness with their crews, and 300 Russes whom they had been supporting with portions of their booty.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Vernadsky69_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vernadsky69" title="">[12]</a></sup> The Muslims then exhumed from the Rus graves the weapons that had been buried beside the warriors.<sup id="_ref-Logan202_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Logan202" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

</p>
<p>The sources are not clear about the roots of the conflict between <a href="/wiki/Khazaria" id="w">Khazaria</a> and Rus, so several possibilities have been suggested. The Rus had an interest in removing the Khazar hold on the Volga trade route because the Khazars collected duties from the goods transported by the Volga. Byzantine incitement also apparently played a role. Khazars were the allies of the Byzantines until the reign of <a href="/wiki/Romanus_I_Lecapenus" id="w">Romanus I Lecapenus</a>, who persecuted the <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jews</a> of his empire. According to the <a href="/wiki/Schechter_Letter" id="w">Schechter Letter</a>, the Khazar ruler <a href="/wiki/Joseph_(Khazar)" id="w">Joseph</a> responded to the persecution of Jews by &#34;doing away with many <a href="/wiki/Christian" id="w">Christians</a>&#34; and Romanus retaliated by inciting <a href="/wiki/Oleg_of_Novgorod" id="w">Oleg of Novgorod</a> (called <i>Helgu</i> in the letter) against Khazaria.<sup id="_ref-Rus_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rus" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The conflict may also have been spurred by the Khazars&#39; decision to close passage down the Volga in response to the raid of 943. In the <a href="/wiki/Khazar_Correspondence" id="w">Khazar Correspondence</a>, written around 950–960, the Khazar ruler Joseph reported his role as defender of the Muslim polities of the <a href="/wiki/Caspian_Sea" id="w">Caspian</a> region against Rus incursions: &#34;I have to wage war with them [Rus], for if I would give them any chance at all they would lay waste the whole land of the Muslims as far as <a href="/wiki/Baghdad" id="w">Baghdad</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Earlier conflict between Muslim elements of the Khazar army and Rus marauders in c. 912 may have contributed to this arrangement and the hostility of the Rus against Khazaria.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 965, <a href="/wiki/Sviatoslav_I_of_Kiev" id="w">Sviatoslav I of Kiev</a> finally went to war against <a href="/wiki/Khazaria" id="w">Khazaria</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Legendary_saga" id="w">legendary saga</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Yngvars_saga_v%C3%AD%C3%B0f%C3%B6rla" id="w">Yngvars saga víðförla</a></i> describes the last expedition of the Vikings into the Caspian, dated to 1041 and possibly connected with the <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(country)" id="w">Georgian</a>-Byzantine <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Sasireti" id="w">Battle of Sasireti</a> in which a Varangian force participated around the same time; in the saga much legend is conflated with the historical facts. This expedition was launched from <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a> by <a href="/wiki/Ingvar_the_Far-Travelled" id="w">Ingvar the Far-Travelled</a>, who went down the Volga into the land of the <a href="/wiki/Saracens" id="w">Saracens</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Serkland" id="w">Serkland</a></i> in Norse). There are no less than twenty-six <a href="/wiki/Ingvar_Runestones" id="w">Ingvar Runestones</a>, twenty-three of them being in the Lake <a href="/wiki/M%C3%A4laren" id="w">Mälaren</a> region of <a href="/wiki/Uppland" id="w">Uppland</a> in Sweden, referring to Swedish warriors who went out with Ingvar on his expedition to the Saracen lands, an expedition whose purpose was probably to reopen old trade routes, now that the Bulgars and the Khazars no longer proved obstacles. A stone to Ingvar’s brother indicates that he went east for gold but that he died in the Saracen land. Afterwards, no attempts were made by the Norsemen to reopen the route between the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Sea" id="w">Baltic</a> and Caspian seas.<sup id="_ref-Logan202_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Logan202" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Khaqani" id="w">Khaqani</a> tells about a Rus raid in 1173 or 1174. <a href="/wiki/Peter_Benjamin_Golden" id="w">Peter Golden</a> argued that the Rus mentioned by Khaqani were <a href="/wiki/Ushkuiniks" id="w">Volga pirates</a> who came in 73 ships. Simultaneously, the <a href="/wiki/Kipchaks" id="w">Kipchaks</a> attacked the cities of <a href="/wiki/Derbent" id="w">Derbent</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shabaran" id="w">Shabaran</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Shirvanshah" id="w">shirvanshah</a> <a href="/wiki/Ahsitan_I" id="w">Ahsitan I</a> turned to the Georgian king, <a href="/wiki/George_III_of_Georgia" id="w">George III</a> for aid and together they defeated Rus and the <a href="/wiki/Kipchaks" id="w">Kipchaks</a>. Georgian sources, however, do not mention Rus in connection with this event.<sup id="_ref-Rus_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rus" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
