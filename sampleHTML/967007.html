<p>According to a March 2005 <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">New York Times</a></i> article, production costs for the album have reached $13 million, making it probably the most expensive recording never to be released.<sup id="_ref-NY Times_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NY Times" title="">[4]</a></sup> Then-Guns N&#39; Roses manager, Merck Mercuriadis, however, refuted the article in a letter and claimed that the newspaper&#39;s sources had not been involved with the project for &#34;six to nine years&#34;.<sup id="_ref-merck article_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-merck article" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Rose issued a press release on Guns N&#39; Roses&#39; official website on <a href="/wiki/December_14" id="w">December 14</a> 2006. Entitled &#34;An open letter to the fans from Axl&#34;, Rose announced the cancellation of four concerts that were scheduled for January 2007, he stated that if the band fulfilled the concerts, &#34;valuable time needed by the band and record company for the proper setup and release of the album <i>Chinese Democracy</i> would have been lost&#34;. Also in the letter, he confirmed that Guns N&#39; Roses had parted company with manager Merck Mercuriadis. Rose blamed much of the album&#39;s delay on Mercuriadis. Rose also announced a tentative release date for <i>Chinese Democracy</i> of <a href="/wiki/March_6" id="w">March 6</a> 2007, he remarked that it was the first time the band had publicly named a release date for the album.<sup id="_ref-Axl's open letter_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Axl's open letter" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite Rose&#39;s announcement, the album was once again delayed. On <a href="/wiki/February_22" id="w">February 22</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, the band&#39;s road manager, <a href="/wiki/Del_James" id="w">Del James</a>, confirmed that all recording for the album had been completed and that it was in the mixing stage.

<p>In a 2007 interview, Bach claimed Rose had planned to have the album released by Christmas 2007: &#34;I know Axl was very serious about putting something out before Christmas. He was talking to me about it. He was talking about finishing liner notes.&#34; Bach also said that <i>Chinese Democracy<b>s delay might be because of business problems: &#34;I think there&#39;s a lot of business shit that goes on with him. It&#39;s just not as easy. It&#39;s a little more complicated than people think.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Bach interview - RMM_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bach interview - RMM" title="">[40]</a></sup></b></i></p>

Rose, along with Slash and McKagan, attempted to block the album&#39;s release. They filed a lawsuit against Geffen, claiming the album was unauthorized and would damage reputation, Rose also claimed it would distract the band from completing <i>Chinese Democracy</i>. A week before the scheduled release, a judge denied their request for an injunction and the album was released.<sup id="_ref-AMG-GH_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AMG-GH" title="">[41]</a></sup> <i>Greatest Hits</i> was #1 in the UK for two weeks and reached #3 on the <a href="/wiki/Billboard_200" id="w">Billboard 200</a>.<sup id="_ref-AMG-GH Charts_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AMG-GH Charts" title="">[42]</a></sup> Despite being criticized for being hastily assembled and not being noticeable remastered,<sup id="_ref-AMG-GH_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AMG-GH" title="">[41]</a></sup> it was the world&#39;s ninth highest selling album of 2004.<sup id="_ref-United world chart_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-United world chart" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
