<p>McMeekin&#39;s plans to jump from municipal to provincial politics had been rumoured for years, and it came as no surprise when he won the Liberal nomination for a <a href="/wiki/By-election" id="w">by-election</a> to be held in ADFA on <a href="/wiki/September_7" id="w">September 7</a>, 2000 (called following the resignation of <a href="/wiki/Member_of_Provincial_Parliament" id="w">Member of Provincial Parliament</a> (MPP) <a href="/wiki/Toni_Skarica" id="w">Toni Skarica</a>, another vocal opponent of the amalgamation scheme).  Although the seat had gone overwhelmingly for the <a href="/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Ontario" id="w">Progressive Conservatives</a> the previous year, McMeekin managed to defeat PC candidate <a href="/wiki/Priscilla_de_Villiers" id="w">Priscilla de Villiers</a> by over 9000 votes.  The Conservatives had spent $211,989 on his competitor, nearly $80,000 in excess of McMeekin&#39;s $132,143.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Local opposition to amalgamation was generally cited as the reason for this shift.</p>
