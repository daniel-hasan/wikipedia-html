<p>Herron served as a royal commissioner in the 1958 <a href="/wiki/Royal_Commission" id="w">Royal Commission</a> of Inquiry into statements made by the Auditor-General in his annual report for the year 30 June 1958 concerning the Minister for Housing, the Honourable Abram Landa.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> In 1961, Herron became the chairman of the Law Reform Committee.</p>

Herron said at 274:
&#39;The function of the criminal law and the purposes of punishment cannot be found in any single explanation, for it depends both upon the nature and type of offence and the offender. But all purposes may be reduced under the single heading of the protection of society, the protection of the community from crime. The sentence should be such as, having regard to all proved circumstances, seems at the same time to accord with the general moral sense of the community and to be likely to be a sufficient deterrent both to the prisoner and others: per Jordan CJ, R. v. Geddes. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Courts have not infrequently attempted further analysis of the several aspects of punishment (Reg v. Goodrich),<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> where retribution, deterrence and reformation are said to be its threefold purposes.
