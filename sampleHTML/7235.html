<p><b>Constantín mac Áeda</b>, known in most modern regnal lists as <b>Constantine II</b><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>, (before 879&#8211;952) was an early <a href="/wiki/King_of_Alba" id="w">King of Alba</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Alba" id="w">Kingdom of Alba</a>, a name which first appears in Constantine&#39;s lifetime, was in northern <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">Britain</a>. The core of the kingdom was formed by the lands around the <a href="/wiki/River_Tay" id="w">River Tay</a>. Its southern limit was the <a href="/wiki/River_Forth" id="w">River Forth</a>, northwards it extended at least to the <a href="/wiki/Mounth" id="w">Mounth</a>, and perhaps to the <a href="/wiki/River_Spey" id="w">River Spey</a>, while its western limits are uncertain. Constantine&#39;s grandfather <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_MacAlpin" id="w">Kenneth MacAlpin</a> (Cináed mac Ailpín) (died 858) was the first of the family recorded as a king, but as <a href="/wiki/King_of_the_Picts" id="w">king of the Picts</a>. This change of title, from king of the Picts to king of Alba, is part of a broader transformation of <a href="/wiki/Pictland" id="w">Pictland</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Origins_of_the_Kingdom_of_Alba" id="w">origins of the Kingdom of Alba</a> are traced to Constantine&#39;s lifetime.</p>
<p>His reign, like those of his predecessors, was dominated by the actions of <a href="/wiki/Viking" id="w">Viking</a> rulers in Britain and <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a>, particularly the <a href="/wiki/U%C3%AD_%C3%8Dmair" id="w">Uí Ímair</a> (&#34;the grandsons of Ímar&#34;). During Constantine&#39;s reign the rulers of the southern kingdoms of <a href="/wiki/Wessex" id="w">Wessex</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mercia" id="w">Mercia</a>, later the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_England" id="w">kingdom of England</a>, extended their authority northwards into the disputed kingdoms of <a href="/wiki/Northumbria" id="w">Northumbria</a>. At first allied with the southern rulers against the Vikings, Constantine in time came into conflict with them. King <a href="/wiki/Æthelstan" id="w">Æthelstan</a> was successful in securing Constantine&#39;s submission in 927 and 934, but the two again fought when Constantine, allied with the <a href="/wiki/Strathclyde_Britons" id="w">Strathclyde Britons</a> and the Viking king of <a href="/wiki/Dublin" id="w">Dublin</a>, invaded Æthelstan&#39;s kingdom in 937, only to be defeated at the great <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Brunanburh" id="w">battle of Brunanburh</a>. In 943 Constantine abdicated and retired to the <a href="/wiki/C%C3%A9li_D%C3%A9" id="w">Céli Dé</a> (Culdee) monastery of <a href="/wiki/St_Andrews" id="w">St Andrews</a> where he died in 952. He was succeeded by his predecessor&#39;s son <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_I" id="w">Malcolm I</a> (Máel Coluim mac Domnaill).</p>
<p>Constantine&#39;s reign of 43 years, exceeded in Scotland only by that of King <a href="/wiki/William_I_of_Scotland" id="w">William the Lion</a> before the <a href="/wiki/Union_of_the_Crowns" id="w">Union of the Crowns</a> in 1603, is believed to have played a defining part in the <a href="/wiki/Gaelicisation" id="w">gaelicisation</a> of Pictland in which his patronage of the Irish Céli Dé monastic reformers was a significant factor. During his reign the words  &#34;Scots&#34; and &#34;Scotland&#34; ({{lang-ang}}) are first used to mean part of what is now <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>. The earliest evidence for the the ecclesiastical and administrative institutions which would last until <a href="/wiki/Davidian_Revolution" id="w">Davidian Revolution</a> also appears at this time.</p>

<p>Compared to neighbouring <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_England" id="w">Anglo-Saxon England</a>, few records of ninth and tenth century events in northern Britain survive. The main local source from the period is the <i><a href="/wiki/Chronicle_of_the_Kings_of_Alba" id="w">Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</a></i>, a list of kings from Kenneth MacAlpin (died 858) to <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_II" id="w">Kenneth II</a> (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim, died 995). The list survives in the <a href="/wiki/Poppleton_Manuscript" id="w">Poppleton Manuscript</a>, a thirteenth century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the tenth and twelfth centuries.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> In addition to this, later king lists survive.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The earliest <a href="/wiki/Genealogical" id="w">genealogical</a> records of the descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin may date from the end of the tenth century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>For narrative history the principal sources are the <i><a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle" id="w">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a></i> and the <a href="/wiki/Irish_annals" id="w">Irish annals</a>. The evidence from <a href="/wiki/Charter" id="w">charters</a> created in the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_England" id="w">Kingdom of England</a> provides occasional insight into events in northern Britain.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> While <a href="/wiki/Scandinavia" id="w">Scandinavian</a> <a href="/wiki/Sagas" id="w">sagas</a> describe events in 10th century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Mainland European sources rarely concern themselves with affairs in Britain, and even less commonly with events in northern Britain, but the life of Saint <a href="/wiki/Cathr%C3%B3e_of_Metz" id="w">Cathróe of Metz</a>, a work of <a href="/wiki/Hagiography" id="w">hagiography</a> written in <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> at the end of the tenth century, provides plausible details of the Saint&#39;s early life in north Britain.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

The dominant kingdom in eastern Scotland before the <a href="/wiki/Viking_Age" id="w">Viking Age</a> was the northern <a href="/wiki/Pictish" id="w">Pictish</a> kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Fortriu" id="w">Fortriu</a> on the shores of the <a href="/wiki/Moray_Firth" id="w">Moray Firth</a>. By the ninth century, the <a href="/wiki/Gaels" id="w">Gaels</a> of <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A1l_Riata" id="w">Dál Riata</a> (Dalriada) were subject to the kings of Fortriu of the family of <a href="/wiki/Constant%C3%ADn_mac_Fergusa" id="w">Constantín mac Fergusa</a> (Constantine son of Fergus). Constantín&#39;s family dominated Fortriu after 789 and perhaps, if Constantín was a kinsman of <a href="/wiki/Óengus_I_of_the_Picts" id="w">Óengus mac Fergusa</a>, from around 730. The dominance of Fortriu came to an end in 839 with a defeat by Viking armies reported by the <i><a href="/wiki/Annals_of_Ulster" id="w">Annals of Ulster</a></i> in which King <a href="/wiki/E%C3%B3gan%C3%A1n_mac_%C3%93engusa" id="w">Eóganán mac Óengusa</a> of Fortriu and his brother Bran, Constantín&#39;s nephews, together with the king of Dál Riata, <a href="/wiki/Áed_mac_Boanta" id="w">Áed mac Boanta</a>, &#34;and others almost innumerable&#34; were killed.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> These deaths led to a period of instability lasting a decade as several families attempted to establish their dominance in Pictland. By around 848 <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_MacAlpin" id="w">Kenneth MacAlpin</a> had emerged as the winner.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Later <a href="/wiki/National_myth" id="w">national myth</a> made Kenneth MacAlpin the creator of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland" id="w">kingdom of Scotland</a>, the founding of which was dated from 843, the year in which he was said to have destroyed the Picts and inaugurated a new age. The historical record for ninth century Scotland is meagre, but the Irish annals and the tenth century <i>Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</i> agree that Kenneth was a Pictish king, and call him &#34;king of the Picts&#34; at his death. The same style is used of Kenneth&#39;s brother <a href="/wiki/Donald_I" id="w">Donald I</a> (Domnall mac Ailpín) and sons <a href="/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Scotland" id="w">Constantine I</a> (Constantín mac Cináeda) and <a href="/wiki/Áed_of_Scotland" id="w">Áed</a> (Áed mac Cináeda).<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The kingdom ruled by Kenneth&#39;s descendants&#8212;older works used the name <a href="/wiki/House_of_Alpin" id="w">House of Alpin</a> to describe them but descent from Kenneth was the defining factor, Irish sources referring to <i>Clann Cináeda meic Ailpín</i> (&#34;the children of Kenneth MacAlpin&#34;) <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>&#8212;lay to the south of the previously dominant kingdom of Fortriu, centred in the lands around the <a href="/wiki/River_Tay" id="w">River Tay</a>. The extent of Kenneth&#39;s nameless kingdom is uncertain, but it certainly extended from the <a href="/wiki/Firth_of_Forth" id="w">Firth of Forth</a> in the south to the <a href="/wiki/Mounth" id="w">Mounth</a> in the north. Whether it extended beyond the mountainous spine of north Britain&#8212;<a href="/wiki/Druim_Alban" id="w">Druim Alban</a>&#8212;is unclear. The core of the kingdom  was similar to the old counties of <a href="/wiki/Kincardineshire" id="w">Mearns</a>, <a href="/wiki/Forfarshire" id="w">Forfar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Perthshire" id="w">Perth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fife" id="w">Fife</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Kinross-shire" id="w">Kinross</a>. Among the chief ecclesiastical centres named in the records are <a href="/wiki/Dunkeld" id="w">Dunkeld</a>, probably seat of the bishop of the kingdom, and <i>Cell Rígmonaid</i> (modern <a href="/wiki/St_Andrews" id="w">St Andrews</a>).<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kenneth&#39;s son Constantine died in 876, probably killed fighting against a Viking army which had come north from Northumbria in 874. According to the king lists, he was counted the 70th and last king of the Picts in later times.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

In 899 <a href="/wiki/Alfred_the_Great" id="w">Alfred the Great</a>, king of <a href="/wiki/Wessex" id="w">Wessex</a>, died leaving his son <a href="/wiki/Edward_the_Elder" id="w">Edward the Elder</a> as ruler of Britain south of the <a href="/wiki/River_Thames" id="w">River Thames</a> and his daughter <a href="/wiki/Æthelfl%C3%A6d" id="w">Æthelflæd</a> and son-in-law <a href="/wiki/Æthelred%2C_ealdorman_of_Mercia" id="w">Æthelred</a> ruling the western, English part of <a href="/wiki/Mercia" id="w">Mercia</a>.

King <a href="/wiki/Eohric_of_East_Anglia" id="w">Eohric</a> was probably ruling in <a href="/wiki/East_Anglia" id="w">East Anglia</a>, but no dates can reliably be assigned to the successors of <a href="/wiki/Guthfrith%2C_King_of_York" id="w">Guthfrith of York</a> in Northumbria. It is known that Guthfrith was succeeded by Sigurd and Cnut, although whether these men ruled jointly or one after the other is uncertain. Northumbria may have been divided by this time between the Viking kings in York and the local rulers, perhaps represented by <a href="/wiki/Eadulf_I_of_Bernicia" id="w">Eadulf</a>, based at <a href="/wiki/Bamburgh" id="w">Bamburgh</a> who controlled the lands from the <a href="/wiki/River_Tyne" id="w">River Tyne</a> or <a href="/wiki/River_Tees" id="w">River Tees</a> to the Forth in the north.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>In Ireland, <a href="/wiki/Flann_Sinna" id="w">Flann Sinna</a>, married to Constantine&#39;s aunt Máel Muire, was dominant. The years around 900 represented a period of weakness among the Vikings and <a href="/wiki/Norse-Gaels" id="w">Norse-Gaels</a> of <a href="/wiki/Dublin" id="w">Dublin</a>. They are reported to have been divided between two rival leaders. In 894 one group left Dublin, perhaps settling on the Irish Sea coast of Britain between the <a href="/wiki/River_Mersey" id="w">River Mersey</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Firth_of_Clyde" id="w">Firth of Clyde</a>. The remaining Dubliners were expelled in 902 by Flann Sinna&#39;s son-in-law <a href="/wiki/Cerball_mac_Muirec%C3%A1in" id="w">Cerball mac Muirecáin</a>, and soon afterwards appeared in western and northern Britain.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>To the south-west of Constantine&#39;s lands lay the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Strathclyde" id="w">kingdom of Strathclyde</a>. This extended north into the <a href="/wiki/Lennox" id="w">Lennox</a>, east to the River Forth, and south into the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Uplands" id="w">Southern Uplands</a>. In 900 it was ruled by King <a href="/wiki/Domnall_I_of_Strathclyde" id="w">Domnall I</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The situation of the Gaelic kingdoms of <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A1l_Riata" id="w">Dál Riata</a> in western Scotland is uncertain. No kings are known by name after Áed mac Boanta. The <a href="/wiki/Francia" id="w">Frankish</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Annales_Bertiniani" id="w">Annales Bertiniani</a></i> may record the conquest of the <a href="/wiki/Inner_Hebrides" id="w">Inner Hebrides</a>, the seaward part of Dál Riata, by Northmen in 849.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> In addition to these, the arrival of new groups of Vikings from northern and western Europe was still commonplace. Whether there were Viking or Norse-Gael kingdoms in the <a href="/wiki/Western_Isles" id="w">Western Isles</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Isles" id="w">Northern Isles</a> at this time is debated.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h1>Early life</h1>
<p><a href="/wiki/Áed_of_Scotland" id="w">Áed</a>, Constantine&#39;s father, succeeded Constantine&#39;s uncle and namesake <a href="/wiki/Constantine_I_of_Scotland" id="w">Constantine I</a> in 876 but was killed in 878. Áed&#39;s short reign is glossed as being of no importance by most king lists. Although the date of his birth is nowhere recorded, Constantine II cannot have been born any later than the year after his father&#39;s death, that is 879. His name may suggest that he was born rather earlier, during the reign of his uncle Constantine I.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> </p>
<p>After Áed&#39;s death there is a two decade gap until the death of <a href="/wiki/Donald_II" id="w">Donald II</a> (Domnall mac Constantín) in 900 during which nothing is reported in the Irish annals.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> The entry for the reign between Áed and Donald II is corrupt in the <i>Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</i>, and in this case the <i>Chronicle</i> is at variance with every other king list.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> According to the <i>Chronicle</i>, Áed was followed by <a href="/wiki/Eochaid_of_Scotland" id="w">Eochaid</a>, a grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, who is somehow connected with <a href="/wiki/Giric" id="w">Giric</a>, but all other lists say that Giric ruled after Áed and make great claims for him.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Giric is not known to have been a kinsman of Kenneth&#39;s, although it has been suggested that he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which began at about this time have been associated by <a href="/wiki/Alex_Woolf" id="w">Alex Woolf</a> and <a href="/wiki/Archie_Duncan" id="w">Archie Duncan</a> with Giric&#39;s reign.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Woolf suggests that Constantine and his cousin Donald may have passed Giric&#39;s reign in exile in Ireland where their aunt Máel Muire was wife of two successive <a href="/wiki/High_Kings_of_Ireland" id="w">High Kings of Ireland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Áed_Findliath" id="w">Áed Findliath</a> and <a href="/wiki/Flann_Sinna" id="w">Flann Sinna</a>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Giric died in 889. If he had been in exile, Constantine may have returned to Pictland where his cousin Donald II became king. Donald&#39;s reputation is suggested by the <a href="/wiki/Epithet" id="w">epithet</a> <i>dasachtach</i>, a word used of violent madmen and mad bulls, attached to him in the eleventh century writings of <a href="/wiki/Flann_Mainstreach" id="w">Flann Mainstreach</a>, echoed by the his description in the <i><a href="/wiki/Prophecy_of_Berchan" id="w">Prophecy of Berchan</a></i> as &#34;the rough one who will think relics and psalms of little worth&#34;.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Wars with the Viking kings in Britain and Ireland continued during Donald&#39;s reign and he was probably killed fighting yet more Vikings at <a href="/wiki/Dunnottar" id="w">Dunnottar</a> in the Mearns in 900.

<p>These Northmen may have been some of those who were driven out of <a href="/wiki/Dublin" id="w">Dublin</a> in 902, but could also have been the same group who had defeated Domnall in 900. The <i>Chronicle</i> states that the Northmen were killed in <i>Srath Erenn</i>, which is confirmed by the <i>Annals of Ulster</i> which records the death of Ímar grandson of Ímar and many others at the hands of the men of Fortriu in 904. This Ímar was the first of the <a href="/wiki/U%C3%AD_%C3%8Dmair" id="w">Uí Ímair</a>, that is the grandsons of Ímar, to be reported; three more grandsons of Ímar appear later in Constantín&#39;s reign. The <i><a href="/wiki/Fragmentary_Annals_of_Ireland" id="w">Fragmentary Annals of Ireland</a></i> contain an account of the battle, and this attributes the defeat of the Norsemen to the intercession of Saint <a href="/wiki/Columba" id="w">Columba</a> following fasting and prayer. An entry in the <i><a href="/wiki/Chronicon_Scotorum" id="w">Chronicon Scotorum</a></i> under the year 904 may possibly contain a corrupted reference to this battle.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>The next event reported by the <i>Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</i> is dated to 906. This records that:</p><blockquote>King Constantine and Bishop <a href="/wiki/Cellach_I_of_Cennr%C3%ADgmonaid" id="w">Cellach</a> met at the <i>Hill of Belief</i> near the royal city of <a href="/wiki/Scone%2C_Perth_and_Kinross" id="w">Scone</a> and pledged themselves that the laws and disciplines of the faith, and the laws of churches and gospels, should be kept <i>pariter cum Scottis</i>.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></blockquote> The meaning of this entry, and its significance, have been the subject of debate.

The phrase <i>pariter cum Scottis</i> in the <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> text of the <i>Chronicle</i> has been translated in several ways. <a href="/wiki/William_Forbes_Skene" id="w">William Forbes Skene</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alan_Orr_Anderson" id="w">Alan Orr Anderson</a> proposed that it should be read as &#34;in conformity with the customs of the Gaels&#34;, relating it to the claims in the king lists that Giric liberated the church from secular oppression and adopted Irish customs.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> It has been read as &#34;together with the Gaels&#34;, suggesting either public participation or the presence of Gaels from the western coasts as well as the people of the east coast.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Finally, it is suggested that it was the ceremony which followed &#34;the custom of the Gaels&#34; and not the agreements.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>The idea that this gathering agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested that it was an important step in the <a href="/wiki/Gaelicisation" id="w">gaelicisation</a> of the lands east of Druim Alban.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> Others have proposed that the ceremony in some way endorsed  Constantine&#39;s kingship, prefiguring later royal inaugurations at Scone.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> Alternatively, if Bishop Cellach was appointed by Giric, it may be that the gathering was intended to heal a rift between king and church.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

<p>Following the events at Scone, there is little of substance reported for a decade. A story in the <i>Fragmentary Annals of Ireland</i>, perhaps referring to events some time after 911, claims that Queen Æthelflæd, who ruled in Mercia, allied with the Irish and northern rulers against the Norsemen on the Irish sea coasts of Northumbria. The <i>Annals of Ulster</i> record the defeat of an Irish fleet from the kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Ulaid" id="w">Ulaid</a> by Vikings &#34;on the coast of England&#34; at about this time.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>In this period the <i>Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</i> reports the death of <a href="/wiki/Cormac_mac_Cuilenn%C3%A1in" id="w">Cormac mac Cuilennáin</a>, <a href="/wiki/King_of_Munster" id="w">king of Munster</a>, in the eighth year of Constantine&#39;s reign.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> This is followed by an undated entry which was formerly read as &#34;In his time <a href="/wiki/Domnall_I_of_Strathclyde" id="w">Dynfwal</a> [Domnall], king of the [Strathclyde] Britons died, and Domnall son of Áed was elected&#34;. This was thought to record the election of a brother of Constantine named Domnall (Donald) to the kingship of the Britons of Strathclyde and was seen as early evidence of the domination of Strathclyde by the kings of Alba. The entry in question is now read as &#34;...Dynfwal...and Domnall son Áed <a href="/wiki/King_of_Ailech" id="w">king of Ailech</a> died&#34;, this Domnall being a son of <a href="/wiki/Áed_Findliath" id="w">Áed Findliath</a> who died on <a href="/wiki/21_March" id="w">21 March</a> <a href="/wiki/915" id="w">915</a>.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Finally, the deaths of Flann Sinna and <a href="/wiki/Niall_Gl%C3%BAndub" id="w">Niall Glúndub</a> are recorded.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> </p>
<p>There are more reports of Viking fleets in the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Sea" id="w">Irish Sea</a> from 914 onwards.  By 916 fleets under <a href="/wiki/Sihtric_C%C3%A1ech" id="w">Sihtric Cáech</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ragnall_ua_%C3%8Dmair" id="w">Ragnall</a>, said to be grandsons of Ímar (that is, they belonged to the same <a href="/wiki/U%C3%AD_%C3%8Dmair" id="w">Uí Ímair</a> kindred as the Ímar who was killed in 904), were very active in Ireland. Sihtric inflicted a heavy defeat on the armies of <a href="/wiki/Leinster" id="w">Leinster</a> and retook Dublin in 917.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> The following year Ragnall appears to have returned across the Irish sea intent on establishing himself as king at <a href="/wiki/York" id="w">York</a>.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> The only precisely dated event in the summer of 918 is the death of Queen Æthelflæd on <a href="/wiki/12_June" id="w">12 June</a> <a href="/wiki/918" id="w">918</a> at <a href="/wiki/Tamworth" id="w">Tamworth</a>.

The northern part of Northumbria, and perhaps the whole kingdom, had probably been ruled by <a href="/wiki/Ealdred_I_of_Bernicia" id="w">Ealdred</a> son of <a href="/wiki/Eadulf_I_of_Bernicia" id="w">Eadulf</a> since 913.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> Faced with Ragnall&#39;s invasion, Ealdred came north seeking assistance from Constantine. The two advanced south to face Ragnall, and this led to a battle somewhere on the banks of the <a href="/wiki/River_Tyne" id="w">River Tyne</a>, probably at <a href="/wiki/Corbridge" id="w">Corbridge</a> where <a href="/wiki/Dere_Street" id="w">Dere Street</a> crosses the river. The <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Corbridge" id="w">battle of Corbridge</a> appears to have been indecisive; the <i>Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</i> is alone in giving Constantine the victory.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The report of the battle in the <i>Annals of Ulster</i> says that none of the kings or <a href="/wiki/Mormaer" id="w">mormaers</a> among the men of Alba were killed. This is the first surviving use of the word mormaer; other than the knowledge that Constantine&#39;s kingdom had its own bishop or bishops and royal villas, this is the only hint to the institutions of the kingdom.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Corbridge, Ragnall enjoyed only a short respite. In the south, Alfred&#39;s son Edward had rapidly secured control of Mercia and had a <a href="/wiki/Burh" id="w">burh</a> constructed at <a href="/wiki/Bakewell" id="w">Bakewell</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Peak_District" id="w">Peak District</a> from which his armies could easily strike north. An army from Dublin led by Ragnall&#39;s kinsman Sihtric struck at north-western Mercia in 919, but in 920 or 921 Edward met with Ragnall and other kings. The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> states that these king &#34;chose Edward as father and lord&#34;. Among the other kings present were Constantine, Ealdred son of Eadwulf, and the king of Strathclyde, either <a href="/wiki/Domnall_II_of_Strathclyde" id="w">Domnall II</a> or, more probably, <a href="/wiki/E%C3%B3gan_I_of_Strathclyde" id="w">Eógan I</a>. Here, again, a new term appears in the record, the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> for the first time using the word <i>scottas</i>, from which Scots derives, to describe the inhabitants of Constantine&#39;s kingdom in its report of these events.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>Edward died in 924. His realms appear to have been divided with the West Saxons recognising <a href="/wiki/Ælfweard_of_Wessex" id="w">Ælfweard</a> while the Mercians chose <a href="/wiki/Æthelstan" id="w">Æthelstan</a> who had been raised at Æthelflæd&#39;s court. Ælfweard died within weeks of his father and Æthelstan was inaugurated as king of all of Edward&#39;s lands in 925.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<a id="%C3%86thelstan" name="%C3%86thelstan"></a><h1>Æthelstan</h1>
<p>By 926 Sihtric had evidently acknowledged Æthelstan as over-king, adopting <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a> and marrying a sister of Æthelstan at Tamworth. Within the year he may have abandoned his new faith and repudiated his wife, but before Æthelstan and he could fight, Sihtric died suddenly in 927. His kinsman, perhaps brother, <a href="/wiki/Gofraid_ua_%C3%8Dmair" id="w">Gofraid</a>, who had remained as his deputy in <a href="/wiki/Dublin" id="w">Dublin</a>, came from Ireland to take power in York, but failed. Æthelstan moved quickly, seizing much of Northumbria. In less than a decade, the kingdom of the English had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, perhaps stretching as far north as the <a href="/wiki/Firth_of_Forth" id="w">Firth of Forth</a>.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/John_of_Worcester" id="w">John of Worcester</a>&#39;s chronicle suggests that Æthelstan faced opposition from Constantine, from Owain of Strathclyde, and from the Welsh kings. <a href="/wiki/William_of_Malmesbury" id="w">William of Malmesbury</a> writes that Gofraid, together with Sihtric&#39;s young son <a href="/wiki/Amla%C3%ADb_Cuar%C3%A1n" id="w">Amlaíb</a> fled north and received refuge from Constantine, which led to war with Æthelstan. A meeting at <a href="/wiki/Eamont_Bridge" id="w">Eamont Bridge</a> on <a href="/wiki/12_July" id="w">12 July</a> <a href="/wiki/927" id="w">927</a> was sealed by an agreement that Constantine, Eógan of Strathclyde, <a href="/wiki/Hywel_Dda" id="w">Hywel Dda</a>, and Ealdred would &#34;renounce all idolatry&#34;: that is, they would not ally with the Viking kings. William states that Æthelstan stood godfather to a son of Constantine, probably <a href="/wiki/Indulf" id="w">Indulf</a> (Ildulb mac Constantín), during the conference.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>Æthelstan followed up his advances in the north by securing the recognition of the Welsh kings.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> For the next seven years, the record of events in the north is blank. Æthelstan&#39;s court was attended by the Welsh kings, but not by Constantine or Eógan of Strathclyde. This absence of record means that Æthelstan&#39;s reasons for marching north against Constantine in 934 are unclear.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>Æthelstan&#39;s campaign is reported by in brief by the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i>, and later chroniclers such as John of Worcester, William of Malmesbury, <a href="/wiki/Henry_of_Huntingdon" id="w">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Symeon_of_Durham" id="w">Symeon of Durham</a> add detail to that bald account. Æthelstan&#39;s army began gathering at <a href="/wiki/Winchester" id="w">Winchester</a> by <a href="/wiki/28_May" id="w">28 May</a> <a href="/wiki/927" id="w">927</a>, and reached <a href="/wiki/Nottingham" id="w">Nottingham</a> by <a href="/wiki/7_June" id="w">7 June</a>. He was accompanied by many leaders, including the Welsh kings Hywel Dda, Idwal Foel, and <a href="/wiki/Morgan_ab_Owain" id="w">Morgan ab Owain</a>. From Mercia the army went north, stopping at <a href="/wiki/Chester-le-Street" id="w">Chester-le-Street</a>, before resuming the march accompanied by a fleet of ships. Eógan of Strathclyde was defeated and Symeon states that the army went as far north as Dunnottar and Fortriu, while the fleet is said to have raided <a href="/wiki/Caithness" id="w">Caithness</a>, by which a much larger area, including <a href="/wiki/Sutherland" id="w">Sutherland</a>, is probably intended. It is unlikely that Constantine&#39;s personal authority extended so far north, and while the attacks may have been directed at his allies, they may also have been simple looting expeditions.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Annals_of_Clonmacnoise" id="w">Annals of Clonmacnoise</a></i> state that &#34;the Scottish men compelled [Æthelstan] to return without any great victory&#34;, while Henry of Huntingdon claims that the English faced no opposition. A negotiated settlement may have ended matters: according to John of Worcester, a son of Constantine was given as a hostage to Æthelstan and Constantín himself accompanied the English king on his return south. He witnessed a charter with Æthelstan at <a href="/wiki/Buckingham" id="w">Buckingham</a> on <a href="/wiki/13_September" id="w">13 September</a> <a href="/wiki/934" id="w">934</a> in which he is described as <i>subregulus</i>, that is a king acknowledging Æthelstan&#39;s overlordship.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> The following year, Constantine was again in England at Æthelstan&#39;s court, this time at <a href="/wiki/Cirencester" id="w">Cirencester</a> where he appears as a witness, appearing as the first of several subject kings, followed by Eógan of Strathclyde and Hywel Dda, who subscribed to the diploma.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> At <a href="/wiki/Christmas" id="w">Christmas</a> of 935, Eógan of Strathclyde was once more at Æthelstan&#39;s court along with the Welsh kings, but Constantine was not. His return to England less than two years later would be in very different circumstances.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Brunanburh_and_after" name="Brunanburh_and_after"></a><h1>Brunanburh and after</h1>
<p>Following his disappearance from Æthelstan&#39;s court after 935, there is no further report of Constantine until 937. In that year, together with Eógan of Strathclyde and <a href="/wiki/Olaf_III_Guthfrithson" id="w">Olaf Guthfrithson, King of Dublin</a>, Constantine invaded England. The resulting <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Brunanburh" id="w">battle of Brunanburh</a>&#8212;<i>Dún Brunde</i>&#8212;is reported in the <i>Annals of Ulster</i> as follows:</p><blockquote>a great battle, lamentable and terrible was cruelly fought...in which fell uncounted thousands of the Northmen. ... And on the other side, a multitude of Saxons fell; but Æthelstan, the king of the Saxons, obtained a great victory.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></blockquote> The battle was remembered in England a generation later as &#34;the Great Battle&#34;. When reporting the battle, the <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> abandons its usual terse style in favour of a heroic poem vaunting the great victory. In this the &#34;hoary&#34; Constantine, by now around 60 years of age, is said to have lost a son in the battle, a claim which the <i>Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</i> confirms. The <i>Annals of Clonmacnoise</i> give his name as Cellach. For all its fame, the site of the battle is uncertain and several sites have been advanced, with <a href="/wiki/Bromborough" id="w">Bromborough</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Wirral" id="w">Wirral</a> the most favoured location.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup>

<p>Brunanburh, for all that it had been a famous and bloody battle, settled nothing. On <a href="/wiki/27_October" id="w">27 October</a> <a href="/wiki/939" id="w">939</a> Æthelstan, &#34;pillar of the dignity of the western world&#34; in the words of the <i>Annals of Ulster</i>, died at <a href="/wiki/Malmesbury%2C_Wiltshire" id="w">Malmesbury</a>. He was succeeded by his brother <a href="/wiki/Edmund_I_of_England" id="w">Edmund the Elder</a>, then aged 18. Æthelstan&#39;s empire, seemingly made safe by the victory of Brunanburh, collapsed in little more than a year from his death when Amlaíb returned from Ireland and seized Northumbria and the Mercian Danelaw. Edmund spent the remainder of Constantín&#39;s reign rebuilding the empire.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>For Constantine&#39;s last years as king there is only the meagre record of the <i>Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</i>. The death of Æthelstan is reported, as are two others. The first of these, in 938, is that of <a href="/wiki/Dubacan_of_Angus" id="w">Dubacan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mormaer_of_Angus" id="w">mormaer of Angus</a> or son of the mormaer. Unlike the report of 918, on this occasion the title mormaer is attached to a geographical area, but it is unknown whether the Angus of 938 was in any way similar to the later mormaerdom or earldom.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> The second death, entered with that of Æthelstan, is that of Eochaid mac Ailpín, who may, from his name, have been a kinsman of Constantín.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Abdication_and_posterity" name="Abdication_and_posterity"></a><h1>Abdication and posterity</h1>
<p>By the early 940s Constantine was an old man, perhaps more than 70 years of age. The kingdom of Alba was too new to be said to have a customary rule of succession, but Pictish and Irish precedents favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine&#39;s surviving son <a href="/wiki/Indulf" id="w">Indulf</a>, probably baptised in 927, would have been too young to be a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine&#39;s nephew, <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_I" id="w">Malcolm I</a>. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been impatient. Willingly or not&#8212;the 11th century <i><a href="/wiki/Prophecy_of_Berch%C3%A1n" id="w">Prophecy of Berchán</a></i>, a verse history in the form of a supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision&#8212;Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although his retirement may have been involuntary, the <i>Life</i> of <a href="/wiki/Cathr%C3%B3e_of_Metz" id="w">Cathróe of Metz</a> and the <i>Prophecy of Berchán</i> portray Constantine as a devout king. The monastery which Constantine retired to, and where he is said to have been <a href="/wiki/Abbot" id="w">abbot</a>, was probably that of <a href="/wiki/St_Andrews" id="w">St Andrews</a>. This had been refounded in his reign and given to the reforming <a href="/wiki/C%C3%A9li_D%C3%A9" id="w">Céli Dé</a> (Culdee) movement. The Céli Dé were subsequently to be entrusted with many monasteries throughout the kingdom of Alba until replaced in the 12th century by new orders imported from <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>. <sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>Seven years later the <i>Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</i> says:</p><blockquote>[Malcolm I] plundered the English as far as the <a href="/wiki/River_Tees" id="w">river Tees</a>, and he seized a multitude of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week&#39;s time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup></blockquote> Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup>

<p>Constantine&#39;s death in 952 is recorded by the Irish annals, who enter it among ecclesiastics. His son Indulf would become king on Malcolm&#39;s death. The last of Constantine&#39;s certain descendants to be king in Alba was a great-grandson, <a href="/wiki/Constantine_III_of_Scotland" id="w">Constantine III</a> (Constantín mac Cuiléin). Another son had died at Brunanburh, and, according to John of Worcester, Amlaíb mac Gofraid was married to a daughter of Constantine. It is possible that Constantine had other children, but like the name of his wife, or wives, this has not been recorded.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<p>The kingdom which began to appear in Constantine&#39;s reign continued in much the same form until the <a href="/wiki/Davidian_Revolution" id="w">Davidian Revolution</a> in the 12th century. As with his ecclestiastical reforms, his political legacy was the creation of a new form of Scottish kingship that lasted for two centuries after his death.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>
