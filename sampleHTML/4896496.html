<p>Attalus won an important victory over the <a href="/wiki/Galatia" id="w">Galatians</a>, newly arrived <a href="/wiki/Celt" id="w">Celtic</a> tribes from <a href="/wiki/Thrace" id="w">Thrace</a>, who had been, for more than a generation, plundering and exacting tribute throughout most of <a href="/wiki/Asia_Minor" id="w">Asia Minor</a> without any serious check. This victory, celebrated by the triumphal monument at Pergamon, famous for its <a href="/wiki/The_Dying_Gaul" id="w">Dying Gaul</a>, and the liberation from the Gallic &#34;terror&#34; which it represented, earned for Attalus the name of &#34;Soter&#34;, and the title of &#34;king.&#34;  </p>
<p>A courageous and capable general and loyal ally of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" id="w">Rome</a>, he played a significant role in the first and second <a href="/wiki/Macedonian_Wars" id="w">Macedonian Wars</a>, waged against <a href="/wiki/Philip_V_of_Macedon" id="w">Philip V of Macedon</a>. He conducted numerous naval operations, harassing Macedonian interests throughout the <a href="/wiki/Aegean_Sea" id="w">Aegean</a>, winning honors, collecting spoils, and gaining for Pergamon possession of the Greek islands of <a href="/wiki/Aegina" id="w">Aegina</a> during the first war, and <a href="/wiki/Andros" id="w">Andros</a> during the second, twice narrowly escaping capture at the hands of Philip.</p>
<p>He died in 197 BC, shortly before the end of the second war, at the age of 72, having suffered an apparent <a href="/wiki/Stroke" id="w">stroke</a> while addressing a <a href="/wiki/Boeotia" id="w">Boeotian</a> war council some months before. He enjoyed a famously happy domestic life, shared with his wife and four sons. He was succeeded as king by his son <a href="/wiki/Eumenes_II" id="w">Eumenes II</a>.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Little is known about Attalus&#39; early life. He was the son of Attalus, and Antiochis.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The elder Attalus was the son of a brother (also called Attalus) of both <a href="/wiki/Philetaerus" id="w">Philetaerus</a>, the founder of the <a href="/wiki/Attalid_dynasty" id="w">Attalid dynasty</a>, and Eumenes, the father of <a href="/wiki/Eumenes_I" id="w">Eumenes I</a>, Philetaerus&#39; successor; he is mentioned, along with his uncles, as a benefactor of <a href="/wiki/Delphi" id="w">Delphi</a>. He won fame as a charioteer, winning at <a href="/wiki/Olympia%2C_Greece" id="w">Olympia</a>, and was honored with a monument at Pergamon. Attalus was a young child when his father died, sometime before 241 BC, after which he was adopted by Eumenes I, the incumbent dynast.</p>
<p>Attalus&#39; mother, Antiochis, was probably related to the <a href="/wiki/Seleucid_Empire" id="w">Seleucid</a> royal family (perhaps being the granddaughter of <a href="/wiki/Seleucus_I_Nicator" id="w">Seleucus I Nicator</a>) with her marriage to Attalus&#39; father likely arranged by Philetaerus to solidify his power. This would be consistent with the conjecture that Attalus&#39; father had been Philetaerus&#39; heir designate, but was succeeded by Eumenes, since Attalus I was too young when his father died.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The <i><a href="/wiki/Dying_Gaul" id="w">Dying Gaul</a></i></div></div>

According to <a href="/wiki/Pausanias_(geographer)" id="w">Pausanias</a>, &#34;the greatest of his achievements&#34; was the defeat of the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Gauls" id="w">Gauls</a>&#34; ({{polytonic}}).<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Pausanias was referring to the Galatians, immigrant <a href="/wiki/Celts" id="w">Celts</a> from <a href="/wiki/Thrace" id="w">Thrace</a>, who had recently settled in <a href="/wiki/Galatia" id="w">Galatia</a> in central <a href="/wiki/Asia_Minor" id="w">Asia Minor</a>, and whom the Romans and Greeks called Gauls, associating them with the Celts of what is now <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland</a>, and northern <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>. Since the time of <a href="/wiki/Philetaerus" id="w">Philetaerus</a>, the uncle of Eumenes I and the first Attalid ruler, the Galatians had posed a problem for Pergamon, indeed for all of Asia Minor, by exacting tributes to avoid war or other repercussions. Eumenes I had (probably), along with other rulers, dealt with the Galatians by paying these tributes. Attalus however refused to pay them, being the first such ruler to do so.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> As a consequence, the Galatians set out to attack Pergamon. Attalus met them near the sources of the river Caïcus<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> and won a decisive victory, after which, following the example of <a href="/wiki/Antiochus_I" id="w">Antiochus I</a>, Attalus took the name of Soter, which means &#34;savior&#34;, and claimed the title of king. The victory brought Attalus legendary fame. A story arose, related by Pausanias, of an oracle who had foretold these events a generation earlier:</p>
<dl><dd><i>Then verily, having crossed the narrow strait of the <a href="/wiki/Hellespont" id="w">Hellespont</a>,</i></dd></dl><dl><dd><i>The devastating host of the Gauls shall pipe; and lawlessly</i></dd></dl><dl><dd><i>They shall ravage Asia; and much worse shall God do</i></dd></dl><dl><dd><i>To those who dwell by the shores of the sea</i></dd></dl><dl><dd><i>For a short while.

<p>Pausanius adds that by &#34;son of a bull&#34; the oracle &#34;meant Attalus, king of Pergamon, who was styled bull-horned&#34;.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> On the acropolis of Pergamon was erected a triumphal monument, which included the famous sculpture the <i><a href="/wiki/Dying_Gaul" id="w">Dying Gaul</a></i>, commemorating this battle.</p>

Several years after the first victory over the Gauls, Pergamon was again attacked by the Gauls together with their ally <a href="/wiki/Antiochus_Hierax" id="w">Antiochus Hierax</a>, the younger brother of <a href="/wiki/Seleucus_II_Callinicus" id="w">Seleucus II Callinicus</a>, and ruler of Seleucid Asia Minor from his capital at <a href="/wiki/Sardis" id="w">Sardis</a>. Attalus defeated the Gauls and Antiochus at the battle of Aphrodisium and again at a second battle in the east. Subsequent battles were fought and won against Antiochus alone: in Hellespontine Phrygia, where Antiochus was perhaps seeking refuge with his father-in law, <a href="/wiki/Ziaelas" id="w">Ziaelas</a> the king of <a href="/wiki/Bithynia" id="w">Bithynia</a>; near Sardis in the spring of 228 BC; and, in the final battle of the campaign, further south in <a href="/wiki/Caria" id="w">Caria</a> on the banks of the Harpasus, a tributary of the <a href="/wiki/B%C3%BCy%C3%BCk_Menderes_River" id="w">Maeander</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a result of these victories, Attalus gained control over all of Seleucid Asia Minor north of the <a href="/wiki/Taurus_Mountains" id="w">Taurus Mountains</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> He was able to hold onto these gains in the face of repeated attempts by <a href="/wiki/Seleucus_III_Ceraunus" id="w">Seleucus III Ceraunus</a>, eldest son and successor of Seleucus II, to recover the lost territory,<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> culminating in Seleucus III himself crossing the Taurus with his army, only to be assassinated<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> in 223 BC.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Achaeus_(general)" id="w">Achaeus</a>, who had accompanied Seleucus III, assumed control of the army. He was offered and refused the kingship in favor of Seleucus III&#39;s younger brother <a href="/wiki/Antiochus_III_the_Great" id="w">Antiochus III the Great</a>, who then made Achaeus governor of Seleucid Asia Minor north of the Taurus. Within two years Achaeus had recovered all the lost Seleucid territories, &#34;shut up Attalus within the walls of Pergamon,&#34; and assumed the title of king.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>After a period of peace, in 218 BC, while Achaeus was involved in an expedition to <a href="/wiki/Selge" id="w">Selge</a> south of the Taurus, Attalus, with some Thracian Gauls, recaptured his former territories.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> However Achaeus returned from victory in Selge in 217 BC and resumed hostilities with Attalus.</p>
<p>Antiochus, under a treaty of alliance with Attalus, crossed the Taurus in 216 BC, attacked Achaeus<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> and besieged Sardis, and in 214 BC, the second year of the siege, was able to take the city. However the citadel remained under Achaeus&#39; control.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Under the pretense of a rescue, Achaeus was finally captured and put to death, and the citadel surrendered<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> By 213 BC, Antiochus had regained control of all of his Asiatic provinces.</p>
<a id="First_Macedonian_War" name="First_Macedonian_War"></a><h2>First Macedonian War</h2>
<p>Thwarted in the east, Attalus now turned his attention westward. Perhaps because of concern for the ambitions of <a href="/wiki/Philip_V_of_Macedon" id="w">Philip V of Macedon</a>, Attalus had sometime before 219 BC become allied with Philip&#39;s enemies the <a href="/wiki/Aetolian_League" id="w">Aetolian League</a>, a union of Greek states in <a href="/wiki/Aetolia" id="w">Aetolia</a> in central Greece, having funded the fortification of Elaeus, an Aetolian stronghold in <a href="/wiki/Calydon" id="w">Calydonia</a>, near the mouth of the river <a href="/wiki/Achelous" id="w">Achelous</a>.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Philip&#39;s alliance with <a href="/wiki/Hannibal" id="w">Hannibal</a> of <a href="/wiki/Carthage" id="w">Carthage</a> in 215 BC also caused concern in <a href="/wiki/Rome" id="w">Rome</a>, then involved in the <a href="/wiki/Second_Punic_War" id="w">Second Punic War</a>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> In 211 BC, a treaty was signed between Rome and the Aetolian League, a provision of which allowed for the inclusion of certain allies of the League, Attalus being one of these.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Attalus was elected one of the two <i><a href="/wiki/Strategos" id="w">strategoi</a></i> (generals) of the Aetolian League,<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> and in 210 BC his troops probably participated in capturing the island of <a href="/wiki/Aegina" id="w">Aegina</a>,<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> acquired by Attalus as his base of operations in Greece.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the following spring (209 BC), Philip marched south into Greece. Under command of Pyrrhias, Attalus&#39; colleague as strategos, the allies lost two battles at <a href="/wiki/Lamia_(city)" id="w">Lamia</a>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Attalus himself went to Greece in July<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> and was joined on Aegina by the Roman <a href="/wiki/Proconsul" id="w">proconsul</a> <a href="/wiki/Publius_Sulpicius_Galba_Maximus" id="w">P. Sulpicius Galba</a> who wintered there.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> The following summer (208 BC) the combined fleet of thirty-five Pergamene and twenty-five Roman ships failed to take <a href="/wiki/Lemnos" id="w">Lemnos</a>, but occupied and plundered the countyside of the island of Peparethos (Skopelos), both Macedonian possessions.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Attalus and Sulpicius then attended a meeting in <a href="/wiki/Trachis" id="w">Heraclea Trachinia</a> of the Council of the Aetolians, at which the Roman argued against making peace with Philip. When hostilities resumed, they sacked both <a href="/wiki/Oreus" id="w">Oreus</a>, on the northern coast of <a href="/wiki/Euboea" id="w">Euboea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Opus%2C_Greece" id="w">Opus</a>, the chief city of eastern <a href="/wiki/Locris" id="w">Locris</a>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. With their forces divided, Philip attacked Opus. Attalus, caught by surprise, was barely able to escape to his ships.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Attalus was now forced to return to Asia, for he had learned at Opus that, at the urging of Philip, <a href="/wiki/Prusias_I_of_Bithynia" id="w">Prusias I</a> king of Bithynia, related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Soon after, the Romans also abandoned Greece to concentrate their forces against Hannibal, their objective of preventing Philip from aiding Hannibal having been achieved.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 206 BC the Aetolians sued for peace on conditions imposed by Philip. A treaty was drawn up at Phoenice in 205 BC, formally ending the <a href="/wiki/First_Macedonian_War" id="w">First Macedonian War</a>. The &#34;Peace of Phoenice&#34; also ended the war with Prusias, and Attalus retained Aegina.</p>
<a id="Macedonian_hostilities_of_201_BC" name="Macedonian_hostilities_of_201_BC"></a><h2>Macedonian hostilities of 201 BC</h2>
<p>Prevented by the treaty of Phoenice from expansion in the east, Philip set out to extend his power in the <a href="/wiki/Aegean_Sea" id="w">Aegean</a> and in Asia Minor. In the spring of 201 BC he took <a href="/wiki/Samos_Island" id="w">Samos</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">Egyptian</a> fleet stationed there. He then besieged <a href="/wiki/Chios" id="w">Chios</a> to the north.</p>
<p>These events caused Attalus, allied with <a href="/wiki/Rhodes" id="w">Rhodes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Byzantium" id="w">Byzantium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cyzicus" id="w">Cyzicus</a>, to enter the war. A large naval battle occurred in the strait between Chios and the mainland, just southwest of <a href="/wiki/Erythrae" id="w">Erythrae</a>. According to <a href="/wiki/Polybius" id="w">Polybius</a>, fifty-three decked warships and over one hundred and fifty smaller warships, took part on the Macedonian side, with sixty-five decked warships and a number of smaller warships on the allied side.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> During the battle Attalus, having become isolated from his fleet and pursued by Philip, was forced to run his three ships ashore, narrowly escaping by spreading various royal treasures on the decks of the grounded ships, causing his pursuers to abandon the pursuit in favor of plunder.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also during 201 BC, Philip invaded Pergamon; although unable to take the easily defended city, in part due to precautions taken by Attalus to provide for additional fortifications,<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> he demolished the surrounding temples and altars.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup>
Meanwhile, Attalus and Rhodes sent envoys to Rome, to register their complaints against Philip.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Second_Macedonian_War" name="Second_Macedonian_War"></a><h2>Second Macedonian War</h2>

<p>On their return, Attalus and the Roman commander went to Heraclea to meet with the Aetolians, who under the terms of their treaty asked Attalus for a thousand soldiers. Attalus refused, citing the Aetolians&#39; own refusal to honor Attalus&#39; request to attack Macedonia during Philip&#39;s attack on Pergamon two years earlier. Resuming operations, Attalus and the Romans attacked but failed to take Oreus and, deciding to leave a small force to invest it, attacked across the straight in <a href="/wiki/Thessaly" id="w">Thessaly</a>.
