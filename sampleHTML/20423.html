<b>Malaria</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Vector_(biology)" id="w">vector</a>-borne <a href="/wiki/Infectious_disease" id="w">infectious disease</a> caused by <a href="/wiki/Protozoan" id="w">protozoan</a> <a href="/wiki/Parasite" id="w">parasites</a>. It is widespread in <a href="/wiki/Tropics" id="w">tropical</a> and subtropical regions, including parts of the <a href="/wiki/Americas" id="w">Americas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Asia" id="w">Asia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a>. Each year, it causes disease in approximately 515 million people and kills between one and three million people, the majority of whom are young children in <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" id="w">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Malaria is commonly associated with poverty, but is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to <a href="/wiki/Economic_development" id="w">economic development</a>.</p>
<p>Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases and an enormous <a href="/wiki/Public_health" id="w">public health</a> problem. The disease is caused by <a href="/wiki/Protozoan" id="w">protozoan</a> <a href="/wiki/Parasite" id="w">parasites</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Genus" id="w">genus</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Plasmodium" id="w">Plasmodium</a></i>. Only four types of the plasmodium parasite can infect humans; the most serious forms of the disease are caused by <i><a href="/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum" id="w">Plasmodium falciparum</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax" id="w">Plasmodium vivax</a></i>, but other related species (<i><a href="/wiki/Plasmodium_ovale" id="w">Plasmodium ovale</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Plasmodium_malariae" id="w">Plasmodium malariae</a>) can also affect humans. This group of human-pathogenic </i>Plasmodium<i> species is usually referred to as </i>malaria parasites<i>.</i></p>
<p>Malaria parasites are transmitted by female <i><a href="/wiki/Anopheles" id="w">Anopheles</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" id="w">mosquitoes</a>. The parasites multiply within <a href="/wiki/Red_blood_cell" id="w">red blood cells</a>, causing symptoms that include symptoms of <a href="/wiki/Anemia" id="w">anemia</a> (light headedness, shortness of breath, <a href="/wiki/Tachycardia" id="w">tachycardia</a> etc.), as well as other general symptoms such as <a href="/wiki/Fever" id="w">fever</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chills" id="w">chills</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nausea" id="w">nausea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Influenza" id="w">flu-like illness</a>, and in severe cases, <a href="/wiki/Coma" id="w">coma</a> and death. Malaria transmission can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites with <a href="/wiki/Mosquito_net" id="w">mosquito nets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Insect_repellent" id="w">insect repellents</a>, or by mosquito control measures such as spraying <a href="/wiki/Insecticide" id="w">insecticides</a> inside houses and draining standing water where mosquitoes lay their eggs.</p>
<p>Although some are under development, no <a href="/wiki/Vaccine" id="w">vaccine</a> is currently available for malaria; preventative drugs must be taken continuously to reduce the risk of infection. These <a href="/wiki/Prophylaxis" id="w">prophylactic</a> drug treatments are often too expensive for most people living in endemic areas. Most adults from endemic areas have a degree of long-term recurrent infection and also of partial resistance; the resistance reduces with time and such adults may become susceptible to severe malaria if they have spent a significant amount of time in non-endemic areas. They are strongly recommended to take full precautions if they return to an endemic area. Malaria infections are treated through the use of <a href="/wiki/Antimalarial_drug" id="w">antimalarial drugs</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Quinine" id="w">quinine</a> or <a href="/wiki/Artemisinin" id="w">artemisinin</a> derivatives, although <a href="/wiki/Drug_resistance" id="w">drug resistance</a> is increasingly common.</p>

<p>Scientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880, when a French army doctor working in the military hospital of <a href="/wiki/Constantine" id="w">Constantine</a> <a href="/wiki/Algeria" id="w">Algeria</a> named <a href="/wiki/Charles_Louis_Alphonse_Laveran" id="w">Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran</a> observed parasites for the first time, inside the <a href="/wiki/Red_blood_cell" id="w">red blood cells</a> of people suffering from malaria. He therefore proposed that malaria was caused by this <a href="/wiki/Protozoa" id="w">protozoan</a>, the first time protozoa were identified as causing disease.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> For this and later discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize_for_Physiology_or_Medicine" id="w">Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine</a>. The protozoan was called <i>Plasmodium</i> by the Italian scientists <a href="/wiki/Ettore_Marchiafava" id="w">Ettore Marchiafava</a> and <a href="/wiki/Angelo_Celli" id="w">Angelo Celli</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> A year later, <a href="/wiki/Carlos_Finlay" id="w">Carlos Finlay</a>, a Cuban doctor treating patients with <a href="/wiki/Yellow_fever" id="w">yellow fever</a> in <a href="/wiki/Havana" id="w">Havana</a>, first suggested that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to and from humans.  However, it was Britain&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Ross" id="w">Sir Ronald Ross</a> working in <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> who finally proved in 1898 that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes. He did this by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds and isolating malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> For this work Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly-established <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_School_of_Tropical_Medicine" id="w">Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine</a> and directed malaria-control efforts in <a href="/wiki/Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Panama" id="w">Panama</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mauritius" id="w">Mauritius</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by <a href="/wiki/Walter_Reed" id="w">Walter Reed</a> in 1900, and its recommendations implemented by <a href="/wiki/William_C._Gorgas" id="w">William C.

<p>The first effective treatment for malaria was the bark of <a href="/wiki/Cinchona" id="w">cinchona tree</a>, which contains <a href="/wiki/Quinine" id="w">quinine</a>. This tree grows on the slopes of the <a href="/wiki/Andes" id="w">Andes</a>, mainly in <a href="/wiki/Peru" id="w">Peru</a>. This natural product was used by the inhabitants of <a href="/wiki/Peru" id="w">Peru</a> to control malaria, and the <a href="/wiki/Jesuit" id="w">Jesuits</a> introduced this practice to Europe during the 1640s where it was rapidly accepted.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> However, it was not until <a href="/wiki/1820" id="w">1820</a> that the active ingredient quinine was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by the French chemists <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Joseph_Pelletier" id="w">Pierre Joseph Pelletier</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Bienaim%C3%A9_Caventou" id="w">Joseph Bienaimé Caventou</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the early twentieth century, before <a href="/wiki/Antibiotics" id="w">antibiotics</a>, patients with <a href="/wiki/Syphilis" id="w">syphilis</a> were intentionally <a href="/wiki/Infected" id="w">infected</a> with malaria to create a <a href="/wiki/Fever" id="w">fever</a>, following the work of <a href="/wiki/Julius_Wagner-Jauregg" id="w">Julius Wagner-Jauregg</a>.  By accurately controlling the fever with <a href="/wiki/Quinine" id="w">quinine</a>, the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized.

<p>Although co-infection with HIV and malaria does cause increased mortality, this is less of a problem than with HIV/<a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis" id="w">tuberculosis</a> co-infection, due to the two diseases usually attacking different age-ranges, with malaria being most common in the young and active tuberculosis most common in the old.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Although HIV/malaria co-infection produces less severe symptoms than the interaction between HIV and TB, HIV and malaria do contribute to each other&#39;s spread.

<a id="Socio-economic_effects" name="Socio-economic_effects"></a><h3>Socio-economic effects</h3>

<p>Malaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty, but is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to <a href="/wiki/Economic_development" id="w">economic development</a>. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. A comparison of average per capita GDP in 1995, adjusted to give parity of purchasing power, between malarious and non-malarious countries demonstrates a fivefold difference ($1,526 USD versus $8,268 USD).  Moreover, in countries where malaria is common, average per capita GDP has risen (between 1965 and 1990) only 0.4% per year, compared to 2.4% per year in other countries.<sup id="_ref-sachs2002_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sachs2002" title="">[28]</a></sup> However, correlation does not imply causation, and the prevalence is at least partly because these regions do not have the financial capacities to prevent malaria. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa $12 billion USD every year.  The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism.<sup id="_ref-greenwood2005_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-greenwood2005" title="">[17]</a></sup>  In some countries with a heavy malaria burden, the disease may account for as much as 40% of public health expenditure, 30-50% of inpatient admissions, and up to 50% of outpatient visits.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Symptoms" name="Symptoms"></a><h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Symptoms of malaria include <a href="/wiki/Fever" id="w">fever</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shivering" id="w">shivering</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arthralgia" id="w">arthralgia</a> (joint pain), <a href="/wiki/Vomiting" id="w">vomiting</a>, <a href="/wiki/Anemia" id="w">anemia</a> caused by <a href="/wiki/Hemolysis" id="w">hemolysis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hemoglobinuria" id="w">hemoglobinuria</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Convulsion" id="w">convulsions</a>. There may be the feeling of tingling in the skin, particularly with malaria caused by <i>P. falciparum</i>. The classical symptom of malaria is cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by rigor and then fever and sweating lasting four to six hours, occurring every two days in <i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. ovale</i> infections, while every three for <i>P. malariae</i>.<sup id="_ref-RBMarmenia_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RBMarmenia" title="">[30]</a></sup> <i>P. falciparum</i> can have recurrent fever every 36-48 hours or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.  For reasons that are poorly understood, but which may be related to high <a href="/wiki/Intracranial_pressure" id="w">intracranial pressure</a>, children with malaria frequently exhibit <a href="/wiki/Abnormal_posturing" id="w">abnormal posturing</a>, a sign indicating severe brain damage.<sup id="_ref-Idro _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Idro " title="">[31]</a></sup>  Malaria has been found to cause cognitive impairments, especially in children. It causes widespread <a href="/wiki/Anemia" id="w">anemia</a> during a period of rapid brain development and also direct brain damage.  This neurologic damage results from cerebral malaria to which children are more vulnerable.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Severe malaria is almost exclusively caused by <i>P. falciparum</i> infection and usually arises 6-14 days after infection.<sup id="_ref-Trampuz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Trampuz" title="">[33]</a></sup> Consequences of severe malaria include <a href="/wiki/Coma" id="w">coma</a> and death if untreated&#8212;young children and pregnant women are especially vulnerable. <a href="/wiki/Splenomegaly" id="w">Splenomegaly</a> (enlarged spleen), severe <a href="/wiki/Headache" id="w">headache</a>, cerebral <a href="/wiki/Ischemia" id="w">ischemia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hepatomegaly" id="w">hepatomegaly</a> (enlarged liver), <a href="/wiki/Hypoglycemia" id="w">hypoglycemia</a>, and hemoglobinuria with <a href="/wiki/Renal_failure" id="w">renal failure</a> may occur. Renal failure may cause <a href="/wiki/Blackwater_fever" id="w">blackwater fever</a>, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine. Severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days.<sup id="_ref-Trampuz_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Trampuz" title="">[33]</a></sup> In the most severe cases of the disease fatality rates can exceed 20%, even with intensive care and treatment.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> In endemic areas, treatment is often less satisfactory and the overall fatality rate for all cases of malaria can be as high as one in ten.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have suffered episodes of severe malaria.<sup id="_ref-carter2005_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carter2005" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chronic malaria is seen in both <i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. ovale</i>, but not in <i>P. falciparum</i>. Here, the disease can relapse months or years after exposure, due to the presence of latent parasites in the liver. Describing a case of malaria as cured by observing the disappearance of parasites from the bloodstream can therefore be deceptive. The longest incubation period reported for a <i>P. vivax</i> infection is 30 years.<sup id="_ref-Trampuz_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Trampuz" title="">[33]</a></sup> Approximately one in five of <i>P. vivax</i> malaria cases in <a href="/wiki/Temperate" id="w">temperate</a> areas involve overwintering by hypnozoites (i.e., relapses begin the year after the mosquito bite).<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>

<p>The parasite&#39;s primary (definitive) hosts and transmission <a href="/wiki/Vector_(biology)" id="w">vectors</a> are female <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" id="w">mosquitoes</a> of the <i><a href="/wiki/Anopheles" id="w">Anopheles</a></i> genus. Young mosquitoes first ingest the malaria parasite by feeding on an infected human carrier and the infected <i><a href="/wiki/Anopheles" id="w">Anopheles</a></i> mosquitoes carry <i>Plasmodium</i> <a href="/wiki/Sporozoite" id="w">sporozoites</a> in their <a href="/wiki/Salivary_gland" id="w">salivary glands</a>. A mosquito becomes infected when it takes a blood meal from an infected human. Once ingested, the parasite <a href="/wiki/Gametocytes" id="w">gametocytes</a> taken up in the blood will further differentiate into male or female <a href="/wiki/Gametes" id="w">gametes</a> and then fuse in the mosquito gut. This produces an <a href="/wiki/Ookinete" id="w">ookinete</a> that penetrates the gut lining and produces an <a href="/wiki/Oocyst" id="w">oocyst</a> in the gut wall.

<div class="thumbcaption">The life cycle of malaria parasites in the human body. The various stages in this process are discussed in the text.</div></div>
</p>
<p>Malaria in humans develops via two phases: an exoerythrocytic (hepatic) and an erythrocytic phase. When an infected mosquito pierces a person&#39;s skin to take a blood meal, <a href="/wiki/Sporozoite" id="w">sporozoites</a> in the mosquito&#39;s saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the <a href="/wiki/Liver" id="w">liver</a>. Within 30 minutes of being introduced into the human host, they infect <a href="/wiki/Hepatocyte" id="w">hepatocytes</a>, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 6&#8211;15 days. Once in the liver these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of <a href="/wiki/Merozoite" id="w">merozoites</a> which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect <a href="/wiki/Red_blood_cell" id="w">red blood cells</a>, thus beginning the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell.<sup id="_ref-sturm2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sturm2006" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>   
<p>Within the red blood cells the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their hosts to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.</p>
<p>Some <i>P. vivax</i> and <i>P. ovale</i> sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (6&#8211;12 months is typical) to as long as three years. After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in these two species of malaria.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Immune_system" id="w">immune system</a> because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance.  However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the <a href="/wiki/Spleen" id="w">spleen</a>. To avoid this fate, the <i>P. falciparum</i> parasite displays adhesive <a href="/wiki/Protein" id="w">proteins</a> on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.<sup id="_ref-Chen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chen" title="">[48]</a></sup>  This &#34;stickiness&#34;  is the main factor giving rise to <a href="/wiki/Hemorrhage" id="w">hemorrhagic</a> complications of malaria. <a href="/wiki/High_endothelial_venules" id="w">High endothelial venules</a> (the smallest branches of the circulatory system) can be blocked by the attachment of masses of these infected red blood cells. The blockage of these vessels causes symptoms such as in placental and cerebral malaria. In cerebral malaria the sequestrated red blood cells can breach the <a href="/wiki/Blood-brain_barrier" id="w">blood brain barrier</a> possibly leading to coma.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the red blood cell surface adhesive proteins (called PfEMP1, for <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> erythrocyte membrane protein 1) are exposed to the immune system they do not serve as good immune targets because of their extreme diversity; there are at least 60 variations of the protein within a single parasite and perhaps limitless versions within parasite populations.<sup id="_ref-Chen_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chen" title="">[48]</a></sup>  Like a thief changing disguises or a spy with multiple passports, the parasite switches between a broad repertoire of PfEMP1 surface proteins, thus staying one step ahead of the pursuing immune system.  </p>
<p>Some merozoites turn into male and female <a href="/wiki/Gametocyte" id="w">gametocytes</a>. If a mosquito pierces the skin of an infected person, it potentially picks up gametocytes within the blood. Fertilization and sexual recombination of the parasite occurs in the mosquito&#39;s gut, thereby defining the mosquito as the <a href="/wiki/Definitive_host" id="w">definitive host</a> of the disease. New sporozoites develop and travel to the mosquito&#39;s salivary gland, completing the cycle. Pregnant women are especially attractive to the mosquitoes,<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> and malaria in pregnant women is an important cause of <a href="/wiki/Stillbirth" id="w">stillbirths</a>, infant mortality and low birth weight,<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> particularly in <i>P. falciparum</i> infection, but also in other species infection, such as <i>P. vivax</i>.<sup id="_ref-rodriguezmorales2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rodriguezmorales2006" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>

Malaria is thought to have been the greatest <a href="/wiki/Selection" id="w">selective pressure</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Human_genome" id="w">human genome</a> in recent history.<sup id="_ref-Kwiatkowski_2005_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kwiatkowski_2005" title="">[53]</a></sup> This is due to the high levels of <a href="/wiki/Death" id="w">mortality</a> and <a href="/wiki/Morbidity" id="w">morbidity</a> caused by malaria, especially the <i><a href="/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum" id="w">P. falciparum</a></i> species.</p>
<a id="Sickle-cell_disease" name="Sickle-cell_disease"></a><h3>Sickle-cell disease</h3>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Distribution of malaria.</div>
The best-studied influence of the malaria parasite upon the human genome is the blood disease, <a href="/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease" id="w">sickle-cell disease</a>. In sickle-cell disease, there is a mutation in the <i>HBB</i> gene, which encodes the beta globin subunit of <a href="/wiki/Haemoglobin" id="w">haemoglobin</a>. The normal allele encodes a <a href="/wiki/Glutamate" id="w">glutamate</a> at position six of the beta globin protein, while the sickle-cell allele encodes a <a href="/wiki/Valine" id="w">valine</a>. This change from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic amino acid encourages binding between haemoglobin molecules, with polymerization of haemoglobin deforming red blood cells into a &#34;sickle&#34; shape. Such deformed cells are cleared rapidly from the blood, mainly in the spleen, for destruction and recycling. </p>
<p>In the merozoite stage of its life cycle the malaria parasite lives inside red blood cells, and its metabolism changes the internal chemistry of the red blood cell. Infected cells normally survive until the parasite reproduces, but if the red cell contains a mixture of sickle and normal haemoglobin, it is likely to become deformed and be destroyed before the daughter parasites emerge.  Thus, individuals <a href="/wiki/Heterozygous" id="w">heterozygous</a> for the mutated allele, known as sickle-cell trait, may have a low and usually unimportant level of <a href="/wiki/Anaemia" id="w">anaemia</a>, but also have a greatly reduced chance of serious malaria infection. This is a classic example of <a href="/wiki/Heterozygote_advantage" id="w">heterozygote advantage</a>.</p>
<p>Individuals <a href="/wiki/Homozygous" id="w">homozygous</a> for the mutation have full sickle-cell disease and in traditional societies rarely live beyond adolescence. However, in populations where malaria is <a href="/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology)" id="w">endemic</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Gene_frequencies" id="w">frequency</a> of sickle-cell genes is around 10%. The existence of four <a href="/wiki/Haplotype" id="w">haplotypes</a> of sickle-type hemoglobin suggests that this mutation has emerged independently at least four times in malaria-endemic areas, further demonstrating its evolutionary advantage in such affected regions. There are also other mutations of the HBB gene that produce haemoglobin molecules capable of conferring similar resistance to malaria infection. These mutations produce haemoglobin types HbE and HbC which are common in <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" id="w">Southeast Asia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Western_Africa" id="w">Western Africa</a>, respectively.</p>
<a id="Thalassaemias" name="Thalassaemias"></a><h3>Thalassaemias</h3>
<p>Another well documented set of mutations found in the human genome associated with malaria are those involved in causing blood disorders known as <a href="/wiki/Thalassaemias" id="w">thalassaemias</a>. Studies in <a href="/wiki/Sardinia" id="w">Sardinia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" id="w">Papua New Guinea</a> have found that the <a href="/wiki/Gene_frequency" id="w">gene frequency</a> of <a href="/wiki/Thalassemia#Beta (β) thalassemias" id="w">β-thalassaemias</a> is related to the level of malarial endemicity in a given population. A study on more than 500 children in <a href="/wiki/Liberia" id="w">Liberia</a> found that those with β-thalassaemia had a 50% decreased chance of getting clinical malaria. Similar studies have found links between gene frequency and malaria endemicity in the α+ form of α-thalassaemia. Presumably these genes have also been <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" id="w">selected</a> in the course of human evolution.</p>
<a id="Duffy_antigens" name="Duffy_antigens"></a><h3>Duffy antigens</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Duffy_antigen" id="w">Duffy antigens</a> are <a href="/wiki/Antigens" id="w">antigens</a> expressed on red blood cells and other cells in the body acting as a <a href="/wiki/Chemokine" id="w">chemokine</a> receptor. The expression of Duffy antigens on blood cells is encoded by Fy genes (Fya, Fyb, Fyc etc.). <i><a href="/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax" id="w">Plasmodium vivax</a></i> malaria uses the Duffy antigen to enter blood cells. However, it is possible to express no Duffy antigen on red blood cells (Fy-/Fy-). This <a href="/wiki/Genotype" id="w">genotype</a> confers complete resistance to <i>P. vivax</i> infection. The genotype is very rare in European, Asian and American populations, but is found in almost all of the indigenous population of West and Central Africa.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> This is thought to be due to very high exposure to <i>P. vivax</i> in <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a> in the last few thousand years.</p>
<a id="G6PD" name="G6PD"></a><h3>G6PD</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase" id="w">Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase</a> (G6PD) is an <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" id="w">enzyme</a> which normally protects from the effects of <a href="/wiki/Oxidative_stress" id="w">oxidative stress</a> in red blood cells. However, a genetic deficiency in this enzyme results in increased protection against severe malaria.</p>
<a id="HLA_and_interleukin-4" name="HLA_and_interleukin-4"></a><h3>HLA and interleukin-4</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen" id="w">HLA-B53</a> is associated with low risk of severe malaria. This <a href="/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex" id="w">MHC class I</a> molecule presents <a href="/wiki/Liver" id="w">liver</a> stage and <a href="/wiki/Sporozoite" id="w">sporozoite</a> <a href="/wiki/Antigens" id="w">antigens</a> to <a href="/wiki/T-Cells" id="w">T-Cells</a>. Interleukin-4, encoded by IL4, is produced by activated T cells and promotes proliferation and differentiation of antibody-producing B cells. A study of the Fulani of Burkina Faso, who have both fewer malaria attacks and higher levels of antimalarial antibodies than do neighboring ethnic groups, found that the IL4-524 T allele was associated with elevated antibody levels against malaria antigens, which raises the possibility that this might
be a factor in increased resistance to malaria.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>

</p>
<p>The most economic, preferred, and reliable diagnosis of malaria is microscopic examination of <a href="/wiki/Blood_film" id="w">blood films</a> because each of the four major parasite species has distinguishing characteristics.  Two sorts of blood film are traditionally used.  Thin films are similar to usual blood films and allow species identification because the parasite&#39;s appearance is best preserved in this preparation.  Thick films allow the microscopist to screen a larger volume of blood and are about eleven times more sensitive than the thin film, so picking up low levels of infection is easier on the thick film, but the appearance of the parasite is much more distorted and therefore distinguishing between the different species can be much more difficult.  With the pros and cons of both thick and thin smears taken into consideration, it is imperative to utilize both smears while attempting to make a definitive diagnosis.<sup id="_ref-warhurst1996_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-warhurst1996" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p>From the thick film, an experienced microscopist can detect parasite levels (or <a href="/wiki/Parasitemia" id="w">parasitemia</a>) down to as low as 0.0000001% of red blood cells.   Microscopic diagnosis can be difficult because the early trophozoites (&#34;ring form&#34;) of all four species look identical and it is never possible to diagnose species on the basis of a single ring form; species identification is always based on several trophozoites.  Please refer to the articles on each parasite for their microscopic appearances: <i><a href="/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum" id="w">P. falciparum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax" id="w">P. vivax</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plasmodium_ovale" id="w">P. ovale</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plasmodium_malariae" id="w">P. malariae</a></i>.  </p>
<p>In areas where microscopy is not available, or where laboratory staff are not experienced at malaria diagnosis, there are <a href="/wiki/Malaria_antigen_detection_tests" id="w">antigen detection tests</a> that require only a drop of blood.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup>  OptiMAL-IT® will reliably detect <i>falciparum</i> down to 0.01% <a href="/wiki/Parasitemia" id="w">parasitemia</a> and non-<i>falciparum</i> down to 0.1%.  <i>Para</i>check-Pf® will detect parasitemias down to 0.002% but will not distinguish between <i>falciparum</i> and non-<i>falciparum</i> malaria.  Parasite nucleic acids are detected using <a href="/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction" id="w">polymerase chain reaction</a>. This technique is more accurate than microscopy. However, it is expensive, and requires a specialized laboratory.  Moreover, levels of parasitemia are not necessarily correlative with the progression of disease, particularly when the parasite is able to adhere to blood vessel walls.  Therefore more sensitive, low-tech diagnosis tools need to be developed in order to detect low levels of parasitaemia in the field.  Areas that cannot afford even simple laboratory diagnostic tests often use only a history of subjective fever as the indication to treat for malaria.  Using Giemsa-stained blood smears from children in Malawi, one study showed that unnecessary treatment for malaria was significantly decreased when clinical predictors (rectal temperature, nailbed pallor, and splenomegaly) were used as treatment indications, rather than the current national policy of using only a history of subjective fevers (sensitivity increased from 21% to 41%).  <sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>Molecular methods are available in some clinical laboratories and rapid real-time assays (for example, <a href="/wiki/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction" id="w">QT-NASBA</a> based on the polymerase chain reaction)<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> are being developed with the hope of being able to deploy them in endemic areas.</p>
<p>Severe malaria is commonly misdiagnosed in <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a>, leading to a failure to treat other life-threatening illnesses. In malaria-endemic areas, <a href="/wiki/Parasitemia" id="w">parasitemia</a> does not ensure a diagnosis of severe malaria because parasitemia can be incidental to other concurrent disease. Recent investigations suggest that malarial <a href="/wiki/Retinopathy" id="w">retinopathy</a> is better (collective sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90%) than any other clinical or laboratory feature in distinguishing malarial from non-malarial <a href="/wiki/Coma" id="w">coma</a>.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Treatment" name="Treatment"></a><h2> Treatment </h2>
<p>Active malaria infection with <i>P. falciparum</i> is a <a href="/wiki/Medical_emergency" id="w">medical emergency</a> requiring <a href="/wiki/Hospital" id="w">hospitalization</a>. Infection with <i>P. vivax</i>, <i>P. ovale</i> or <i>P. malariae</i> can often be treated on an outpatient basis. Treatment of malaria involves supportive measures as well as specific antimalarial drugs. When properly treated, someone with malaria can expect a complete cure.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Antimalarial_drugs" name="Antimalarial_drugs"></a><h3>Antimalarial drugs</h3>

<p>{{further}}
There are several families of drugs used to treat malaria. <a href="/wiki/Chloroquine" id="w">Chloroquine</a> is very cheap and, until recently, was very effective, which made it the antimalarial drug of choice for many years in most parts of the world. However, resistance of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> to chloroquine has spread recently from Asia to Africa, making the drug ineffective against the most dangerous Plasmodium strain in many affected regions of the world. In those areas where chloroquine is still effective it remains the first choice.  Unfortunately, chloroquine-resistance is associated with reduced sensitivity to other drugs such as <a href="/wiki/Quinine" id="w">quinine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amodiaquine" id="w">amodiaquine</a>.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are several other substances which are used for treatment and, partially, for prevention (prophylaxis). Many drugs may be used for both purposes; larger doses are used to treat cases of malaria. Their deployment depends mainly on the frequency of resistant parasites in the area where the drug is used. One drug <a href="/wiki/As_of_2007" id="w">currently</a> being investigated for possible use as an anti-malarial, especially for treatment of drug-resistant strains, is the <a href="/wiki/Beta_blocker" id="w">beta blocker</a> <a href="/wiki/Propranolol" id="w">propranolol</a>.

A December 2006 study by <a href="/wiki/Northwestern_University" id="w">Northwestern University</a> researchers suggested that propranolol may reduce the dosages required for existing drugs to be effective against <i>P. falciparum</i> by 5- to 10-fold, suggesting a role in combination therapies.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></b></i></p>

A team of French and South African researchers had identified a new drug they were calling &#34;G25&#34;.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> It cured malaria in test primates by blocking the ability of the parasite to copy itself within the red blood cells of its victims.  In 2005 the same team of researchers published their research on achieving an oral form, which they refer to as &#34;TE3&#34; or &#34;te3&#34;.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> As of early 2006, there is no information in the mainstream press as to when this family of drugs will become commercially available.</p>
<p>In 1996, Professor Geoff McFadden stumbled upon the work of British biologist Ian Wilson, who had discovered that the plasmodia responsible for causing malaria retained parts of chloroplasts<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup>, an organelle usually found in plants, complete with their own functioning genomes. This led Professor McFadden to the realisation that any number of herbicides may in fact be successful in the fight against malaria, and so he set about trialing large numbers of them, and enjoyed a 75% success rate. </p>
<p>These &#34;<a href="/wiki/Apicoplast" id="w">apicoplasts</a>&#34; are thought to have originated through the endosymbiosis of algae<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> and play a crucial role in fatty acid bio-synthesis in plasmodia<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup>. To date, 466 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> and these are now being looked at as possible targets for novel anti-malarial drugs.</p>
<p>Although effective anti-malarial drugs are on the market, the disease remains a threat to people living in endemic areas who have no proper and prompt access to effective drugs. Access to pharmacies and health facilities, as well as drug costs, are major obstacles. <a href="/wiki/M%C3%A9decins_Sans_Fronti%C3%A8res" id="w">Médecins Sans Frontières</a> estimates that the cost of treating a malaria-infected person in an endemic country was between <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$0</a>.25 and $2.40 per dose in 2002.<sup id="_ref-msf_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-msf" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>

<p>Methods used to prevent the spread of disease, or to protect individuals in areas where malaria is endemic, include prophylactic drugs, mosquito eradication, and the prevention of mosquito bites.  There is currently no <a href="/wiki/Vaccination" id="w">vaccine</a> that will prevent malaria, but this is an active field of research.  </p>
<p>Many researchers argue that prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the capital costs required are out of reach of many of the world&#39;s poorest people.  Economic adviser <a href="/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs" id="w">Jeffrey Sachs</a> estimates that malaria can be controlled for US$3 billion in aid per year.  It has been argued that, in order to meet the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" id="w">Millennium Development Goals</a>, money should be redirected from <a href="/wiki/HIV" id="w">HIV</a>/<a href="/wiki/AIDS" id="w">AIDS</a> treatment to malaria prevention, which for the same amount of money would provide greater benefit to African economies.<sup id="_ref-hull2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hull2006" title="">[82]</a></sup></p>
<p>Efforts to <a href="/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases" id="w">eradicate</a> malaria by eliminating mosquitoes have been successful in some areas.  Malaria was once common in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and southern <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>, but the draining of wetland breeding grounds and better sanitation, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from affluent regions.  In 2002, there were 1,059 cases of malaria reported in the US, including eight deaths.  In five of those cases, the disease was contracted in the United States.  Malaria was eliminated from the northern parts of the USA in the early twentieth century, and the use of the <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" id="w">pesticide</a> <a href="/wiki/DDT" id="w">DDT</a> eliminated it from the South by 1951.  In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a major public health effort to eradicate malaria worldwide by selectively targeting mosquitoes in areas where malaria was rampant.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> However, these efforts have so far failed to eradicate malaria in many parts of the developing world - the problem is most prevalent in Africa. </p>
<p>Brazil, Eritrea, India, and Vietnam have, unlike many other developing nations, successfully reduced the malaria burden. Common success factors included conducive country conditions, a targeted technical approach using a package of effective tools, data-driven decision-making, active leadership at all levels of government, involvement of communities, decentralized implementation and control of finances, skilled technical and managerial capacity at national and sub-national levels, hands-on technical and programmatic support from partner agencies, and sufficient and flexible financing.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Malaria_Control_Project" id="w">Malaria Control Project</a> is currently using downtime computing power donated by individual volunteers around the world (see <a href="/wiki/Volunteer_computing" id="w">Volunteer computing</a> and <a href="/wiki/BOINC" id="w">BOINC</a>) to simulate models of the health effects and transmission dynamics in order to find the best method or combination of methods for malaria control. This modeling is extremely computer intensive due to the simulations of large human populations with a vast range of parameters related to biological and social factors that influence the spread of the disease. It is expected to take a few months using volunteered computing power compared to the 40 years it would have taken with the current resources available to the scientists who developed the program.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="Prophylactic_drugs" name="Prophylactic_drugs"></a><h3>Prophylactic drugs</h3>
<p>{{Main}}</p>
<p>Several drugs, most of which are also used for treatment of malaria, can be taken preventively.  Generally, these drugs are taken daily or weekly, at a lower dose than would be used for treatment of a person who had actually contracted the disease. Use of prophylactic drugs is seldom practical for full-time residents of malaria-endemic areas, and their use is usually restricted to short-term visitors and travelers to malarial regions. This is due to the cost of purchasing the drugs, negative <a href="/wiki/Adverse_effect_(medicine)" id="w">side effects</a> from long-term use, and because some effective anti-malarial drugs are difficult to obtain outside of wealthy nations.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Quinine" id="w">Quinine</a> was used starting in the <a href="/wiki/Seventeenth_century" id="w">seventeenth century</a> as a prophylactic against malaria.  The development of more effective alternatives such as <a href="/wiki/Quinacrine" id="w">quinacrine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chloroquine" id="w">chloroquine</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Primaquine" id="w">primaquine</a> in the twentieth century reduced the reliance on quinine.  Today, quinine is still used to treat chloroquine resistant <i><a href="/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum" id="w">Plasmodium falciparum</a></i>, as well as severe and cerebral stages of malaria, but is not generally used for prophylaxis.  Of interesting historical note is the observation by <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Hahnemann" id="w">Samuel Hahnemann</a> in the late <a href="/wiki/18th_Century" id="w">18th Century</a> that over-dosing of quinine leads to a symptomatic state very similar to that of malaria itself.  This lead Hahnemann to develop the medical <a href="/wiki/Law_of_Similars" id="w">Law of Similars</a>, and the subsequent medical system of <a href="/wiki/Homeopathy" id="w">Homeopathy</a>.</p>
<p>Modern drugs used preventively include <a href="/wiki/Mefloquine" id="w">mefloquine</a> (<b>Lariam®</b>), <a href="/wiki/Doxycycline" id="w">doxycycline</a> (available generically), and the combination of <a href="/wiki/Atovaquone" id="w">atovaquone</a> and <a href="/wiki/Proguanil" id="w">proguanil</a> hydrochloride (<b>Malarone®</b>). The choice of which drug to use depends on which drugs the parasites in the area are <a href="/wiki/Drug_resistance" id="w">resistant</a> to, as well as side-effects and other considerations. The prophylactic effect does not begin immediately upon starting taking the drugs, so people temporarily visiting malaria-endemic areas usually begin taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and must continue taking them for 4 weeks after leaving (with the exception of atovaquone proguanil that only needs be started 2 days prior and continued for 7 days afterwards).</p>
<a id="Indoor_residual_spraying" name="Indoor_residual_spraying"></a><h3>Indoor residual spraying</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/DDT" id="w">DDT</a> was developed as the first of the modern <a href="/wiki/Insecticide" id="w">insecticides</a> early in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>.  While it was initially used to combat malaria, its use spread to <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" id="w">agriculture</a> where it was used to eliminate insect pests.  In time, pest-control, rather than disease-control, came to dominate DDT use, particularly in the developed world.  During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, and ultimately led to bans in many countries in the 1970s.  By this time, its large-scale use had already led to the <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolution</a> of resistant mosquitoes in many regions.</p>
<p>However, given the continuing toll to malaria, particularly in developing countries, there is considerable controversy regarding the restrictions placed on the use of DDT.  Though DDT has never been banned for use in malaria control, some advocates claim that bans are responsible for tens of millions of deaths in tropical countries where DDT had previously been effective in controlling malaria.  Furthermore, most of the problems associated with DDT use stem specifically from its industrial-scale application in agriculture, rather than its use in <a href="/wiki/Public_health" id="w">public health</a>.<sup id="_ref-pmid17111979_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pmid17111979" title="">[86]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" id="w">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) currently advises the use of DDT to combat malaria in endemic areas.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup>  For instance, DDT-spraying the interior walls of living spaces, where mosquitoes land, is an effective control.  The WHO also recommends a series of alternative insecticides (such as the pyrethroids <a href="/wiki/Permethrin" id="w">permethrin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Deltamethrin" id="w">deltamethrin</a>) to both combat malaria in areas where mosquitoes are DDT-resistant, and to slow the evolution of resistance.  This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the <a href="/wiki/Stockholm_Convention" id="w">Stockholm Convention</a> on <a href="/wiki/Persistent_Organic_Pollutant" id="w">Persistent Organic Pollutants</a> (POPs), which prohibits the agricultural use of DDT for large-scale field spraying.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup>  However, because of its legacy, many developed countries discourage DDT use even in small quantities.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Mosquito_nets_and_bedclothes" name="Mosquito_nets_and_bedclothes"></a><h3>Mosquito nets and bedclothes</h3>
<p>Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people, and thus greatly reduce the infection and transmission of malaria.  The nets are not a perfect barrier, so they are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to search for a way past the net.  Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets,<sup id="_ref-hull2006_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hull2006" title="">[82]</a></sup> and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup>  Since the <i><a href="/wiki/Anopheles" id="w">Anopheles</a></i> mosquitoes feed at night, the preferred method is to hang a large &#34;bed net&#34; above the center of a bed such that it drapes down and covers the bed completely.  </p>
<p>The distribution of mosquito nets impregnated with insecticide (often <a href="/wiki/Permethrin" id="w">permethrin</a> or deltamethrin) has been shown to be an extremely effective method of malaria prevention, and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods of prevention.  These nets can often be obtained for around US$2.50 - $3.50 (2-3 euros) from the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a>, the World Health Organization, and others.  </p>
<p>For maximum effectiveness, the nets should be re-impregnated with insecticide every six months.  This process poses a significant logistical problem in rural areas.  New technologies like Olyset or DawaPlus allow for production of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets (LLINs), which release insecticide for approximately 5 years,<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup> and cost about US$5.50.  ITNs have the advantage of protecting people sleeping under the net and simultaneously killing mosquitoes that contact the net.  This has the effect of killing the most dangerous mosquitoes.  Some protection is also provided to others, including people sleeping in the same room but not under the net.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cost of treating malaria is high relative to income, and the illness results in lost wages.  Consequently, the financial burden means that the cost of a mosquito net is often unaffordable to people in developing countries, especially for those most at risk.  Only 1 out of 20 people in Africa own a bed net.<sup id="_ref-hull2006_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hull2006" title="">[82]</a></sup> Although shipped into Africa mainly from Europe as free development help, the nets quickly become expensive trade goods. They are mainly used for fishing, and by combining hundreds of donated mosquito nets, whole river sections can be completely shut off, catching even the smallest fish. <sup id="_ref-Economist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Economist" title="">[92]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A study among <a href="/wiki/Afghan_refugees" id="w">Afghan refugees</a> in Pakistan found that treating top-sheets and chaddars (head coverings) with permethrin has similar effectiveness to using a treated net, but is much cheaper.<sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup></p>
<p>A new approach, announced in <i>Science</i> on <a href="/wiki/June_10" id="w">June 10</a>, 2005, uses spores of the <a href="/wiki/Fungus" id="w">fungus</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Beauveria_bassiana" id="w">Beauveria bassiana</a></i>, sprayed on walls and bed nets, to kill mosquitoes.  While some mosquitoes have developed resistance to chemicals, they have not been found to develop a resistance to fungal infections.<sup id="_ref-bbcfungus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bbcfungus" title="">[94]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Vaccination" name="Vaccination"></a><h3>Vaccination</h3>
<p>{{further}}</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Vaccination" id="w">Vaccines</a> for malaria are under development, with no completely effective vaccine yet available. The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live, radiation-<a href="/wiki/Attenuator_(genetics)" id="w">attenuated</a> <a href="/wiki/Sporozoite" id="w">sporozoites</a>, providing protection to about 60% of the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites.<sup id="_ref-Nussenzweig1967_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nussenzweig1967" title="">[95]</a></sup>  Since the 1970s, there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies within humans.  It was determined that an individual can be protected from a <i>P. falciparum</i> infection if they receive over 1000 bites from infected, irradiated mosquitoes.<sup id="_ref-Hoffman2002_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hoffman2002" title="">[96]</a></sup></p>
<p>It has been generally accepted that it is impractical to provide at-risk individuals with this vaccination strategy, but that has been recently challenged with work being done by Dr. Stephen Hoffman of <a class="externallink" href="http://www.sanaria.com" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.sanaria.com">Sanaria</a>, one of the key researchers who originally sequenced the genome of <i><a href="/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum" id="w">Plasmodium falciparum</a></i>.  His work most recently has revolved around solving the logistical problem of isolating and preparing the parasites equivalent to a 1000 irradiated mosquitoes for mass storage and inoculation of human beings. The company has recently received several multi-million dollar grants from the <a href="/wiki/Bill_%26amp%3B_Melinda_Gates_Foundation" id="w">Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> and the U.S. government to begin early clinical studies in 2007 and 2008.<sup id="_ref-Sanaria studies_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sanaria studies" title="">[97]</a></sup></p>
<p>Instead, much work has been performed to try and understand the <a href="/wiki/Immune_system" id="w">immunological</a> processes that provide protection after immunization with irradiated sporozoites.  After the mouse vaccination study in 1967,<sup id="_ref-Nussenzweig1967_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nussenzweig1967" title="">[95]</a></sup> it was hypothesized that the injected sporozoites themselves were being recognized by the immune system, which was in turn creating <a href="/wiki/Antibody" id="w">antibodies</a> against the parasite.  It was determined that the immune system was creating antibodies against the <a href="/wiki/Circumsporozoite" id="w">circumsporozoite</a> protein (CSP) which coated the sporozoite.<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup>  Moreover, antibodies against CSP prevented the sporozoite from invading hepatocytes.<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup> CSP was therefore chosen as the most promising protein on which to develop a vaccine against the malaria sporozoite.  It is for these historical reasons that vaccines based on CSP are the most numerous of all malaria vaccines.</p>
<p>Presently, there is a huge variety of vaccine candidates on the table.  Pre-erythrocytic vaccines (vaccines that target the parasite before it reaches the blood), in particular vaccines based on CSP, make up the largest group of research for the malaria vaccine.  Other vaccine candidates include: those that seek to induce immunity to the blood stages of the infection; those that seek to avoid more severe pathologies of malaria by preventing adherence of the parasite to blood <a href="/wiki/Venules" id="w">venules</a> and <a href="/wiki/Placenta" id="w">placenta</a>; and <a href="/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)" id="w">transmission</a>-blocking vaccines that would stop the development of the parasite in the mosquito right after the mosquito has taken a bloodmeal from an infected person.<sup id="_ref-Matuschewski2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Matuschewski2006" title="">[100]</a></sup> It is hoped that the sequencing of the <i>P. falciparum</i> <a href="/wiki/Genome" id="w">genome</a> will provide targets for new drugs or vaccines.<sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first vaccine developed that has undergone field trials, is the SPf66, developed by <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Elkin_Patarroyo" id="w">Manuel Elkin Patarroyo</a> in 1987. It presents a combination of antigens from the sporozoite (using CS repeats) and merozoite parasites. During phase I trials a 75% efficacy rate was demonstrated and the vaccine appeared to be well tolerated by subjects and immunogenic. The phase IIb and III trials were less promising, with the efficacy falling to between 38.8% and 60.2%. A trial was carried out in Tanzania in 1993 demonstrating the efficacy to be 31% after a years follow up, however the most recent (though controversial) study in the Gambia did not show any effect. Despite the relatively long trial periods and the number of studies carried out, it is still not known how the SPf66 vaccine confers immunity; it therefore remains an unlikely solution to malaria.
The CSP was the next vaccine developed that initially appeared promising enough to undergo trials. It is also based on the circumsporoziote protein, but additionally has the recombinant (Asn-Ala-Pro15Asn-Val-Asp-Pro)2-Leu-Arg(R32LR) protein covalently bound to a purified <i><a href="/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa" id="w">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a></i> toxin (A9). However at an early stage a complete lack of protective immunity was demonstrated in those inoculated. The study group used in Kenya had an 82% incidence of parasitaemia whilst the control group only had an 89% incidence. The vaccine intended to cause an increased T-lymphocyte response in those exposed, this was also not observed. </p>
<p>The efficacy of Patarroyo&#39;s vaccine has been disputed with some US scientists concluding in <a href="/wiki/The_Lancet" id="w">The Lancet</a> (1997) that &#34;the vaccine was not effective and should be dropped&#34; while the Colombian accused them of &#34;arrogance&#34; putting down their assertions to the fact that he came from a developing country.</p>
<p>The RTS,S/AS02A vaccine is the candidate furthest along in vaccine trials.  It is being developed by a partnership between the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (a grantee of the <a href="/wiki/Bill_and_Melinda_Gates_Foundation" id="w">Gates Foundation</a>), the <a href="/wiki/Pharmaceutical_company" id="w">pharmaceutical company</a>, <a href="/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline" id="w">GlaxoSmithKline</a>, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup>  In the vaccine, a portion of CSP has been fused to the <a href="/wiki/Immunogenicity" id="w">immunogenic</a> &#34;S <a href="/wiki/Antigen" id="w">antigen</a>&#34; of the <a href="/wiki/Hepatitis_B" id="w">hepatitis B</a> virus; this <a href="/wiki/Recombinant" id="w">recombinant</a> protein is injected alongside the potent AS02A <a href="/wiki/Adjuvant" id="w">adjuvant</a>.<sup id="_ref-Matuschewski2006_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Matuschewski2006" title="">[100]</a></sup> In October 2004, the RTS,S/AS02A researchers announced results of a <a href="/wiki/Clinical_trial" id="w">Phase IIb trial</a>, indicating the vaccine reduced infection risk by approximately 30% and severity of infection by over 50%.

<p><a href="/wiki/Sterile_insect_technique" id="w">Sterile insect technique</a> is emerging as a potential mosquito control method.  Progress towards transgenic, or <a href="/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism" id="w">genetically modified</a>, insects suggest that wild mosquito populations could be made malaria-resistant.

<p>Education in recognising the symptoms of Malaria has reduced the number of cases in some areas of the developing world by as much as 20%.  Recognising the disease in the early stages can also stop the disease from becoming a killer.  Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stangnant, still water eg Water Tanks which are ideal breeding grounds for the parastie and mosquito thus, cutting down the risk of the transmission between people.  This is most put in practice in urban areas where there is large centres of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas.</p> 
<p>Before DDT, malaria was successfully eradicated or controlled also in several tropical areas by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larva stages, for example by filling or applying oil to places with standing water. These methods have seen little application in Africa for more than half a century.<sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[108]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Policy_implementation_and_access_to_anti-malarial_drugs_in_developing_countries" name="Policy_implementation_and_access_to_anti-malarial_drugs_in_developing_countries"></a><h2>Policy implementation and access to anti-malarial drugs in developing countries</h2>
<p>{{Refimprovesect}}</p>
<p>The introduction of any anti-malarial therapy requires policies to regulate local distribution, access and guidelines for usage. There are many considerations when implementing the use a newly developed drug. </p>
<p>These include: </p>

<ul>
<li>the known efficacy of the treatment and the adherence levels likely within the constraints of the local health system; </li>
<li>the economic resources necessary to implement the policy by the health care sector; </li>
<li>the human and technical resources and the basic primary health care infrastructure;</li>
<li>education; </li>
<li>training and health promotion schemes for staff and the general population; </li>
<li>successful interactions between the public and private sector to ensure that sufficient drugs are supplied; </li>
<li>regulation over quality control; </li>
<li>distribution and pricing; </li>
<li>regular monitoring and a system enabling alteration of the policy. </li></ul>
<p>One of the major problems associated with anti-malarial therapy is the inadequate primary health care infrastructure in many of the countries where malaria is endemic. It is estimated that one third of the population at risk of developing the infection has no access to therapy. Access is defined as the availability to pharmaceuticals of quality and can be subdivided in to physical, financial (affordability and equity) and rational-use access. The level of access is determined by many factors from the appropriate knowledge to use the drug effectively, supply management, basic infrastructure for delivery, economic and legislative issues. This is affected by the participation and support of all the stakeholders involved from the government to local private companies. In many countries access is prevented by poor political will and interest, low levels of economic growth and the investment of the majority of financial resources in secondary or tertiary health care.</p>	
<p>The level of quality control over anti-malarials provided is a key problem in many areas of the world. Poor quality and counterfeit drugs can lead to an increase in the rate of resistance development due to incorrect dosing and can pose a fatal risk if given in acute cases where little or no drug is contained within the given dose. This issue is thought to account, to an unknown degree, to the perceived resistance and treatment failure rates seen. The percentage failure rates in sub-Saharan Africa vary from 20 to 67%. Random content testing has been carried out and demonstrated that, in certain areas up to 100% of this failure is due to poor content. This poses a serious danger to the international campaigns against malaria and therefore cannot be ignored. Suggestions to overcome such problems include international surveillance systems within drug regulatory authorities and supporting pharmaceutical manufacturers.</p>
