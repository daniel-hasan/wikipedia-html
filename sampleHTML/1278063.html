<b>USAir Flight 1493</b> was a <a href="/wiki/Boeing_737#737-300 " id="w">Boeing 737-300</a> commercial jet en route from <a href="/wiki/Syracuse_Hancock_International_Airport" id="w">Syracuse Hancock International Airport</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> to  <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport" id="w">Los Angeles International Airport</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a> via <a href="/wiki/Port_Columbus_International_Airport" id="w">Port Columbus International Airport</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ohio" id="w">Ohio</a> on <a href="/wiki/1_February" id="w">1 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a>. Immediately after landing on runway 24L at Los Angeles International Airport, it collided with <a href="/wiki/SkyWest" id="w">SkyWest</a> Flight 5569, a twin-engine turbo-prop <a href="/wiki/Fairchild_Swearingen_Metroliner" id="w">Fairchild Metro III</a> plane en route to <a href="/wiki/Palmdale" id="w">Palmdale</a> <a href="/wiki/Palmdale_Regional_Airport" id="w">Regional Airport</a>, in <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>.</p>
<p>Skywest 5569 was directed to move onto runway 24L for takeoff and hold in position at the intersection of taxiway 45. US1493 was cleared to land on 24L one minute later by the same local controller. One minute later, the 737 touched down, then ran into the SkyWest Metro, which was still holding in position 2400&#39; from the runway threshold. The two planes slid down the runway, then off to the side, coming to rest against an unoccupied firehouse, and burst into flame.  All 12 people on the Metro were killed (10 passengers and 2 pilots), and 22 of the 89 aboard the 737 perished (20 passengers, 1 pilot and 1 flight attendant).

The <a href="/wiki/NTSB" id="w">NTSB</a> cited LAX&#39;s handling of flight strips which placed much of the responsibility for the strips on the local controllers.  The local controller&#39;s loss of situational awareness was also noted as a factor, as was the Metro&#39;s lighting and both flight crew&#39;s failure to follow &#34;see and avoid&#34; principles during VFR conditions.  </p>
