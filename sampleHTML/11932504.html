<p>Inflation adjusted income data from the Census Bureau shows that household income has increased substantially for all demographics, with larger gains experienced by those with higher incomes. The emergence of dual-earner households has had a substantial impact on increasing household income, especially among households in the upper 20%. Along with the entrance of women into the labor force, the discrepancy between those households with one and those with multiple earners was amplified significantly.<sup id="_ref-Gilbert, D. (2002).

Personal income represents the earnings of individuals and, therefore, directly reflects occupational status, achievement and educational attainment. While many, though not the majority, of income earners reside in households with more than one income earner, trends in personal income are more indicative of the job market and the economy than household income. Personal income has risen considerably since 1953, especially for female workers. For male workers, however, income stagnated during the 1970s and 1980s, increasing substantially during the 1990s and then stagnating once more since 2000.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau. (2006).

To date, one of the most commonly used measure of income inequality is the Gini index. The Gini coefficient measures income inequality on a scale from 0 to 1, based on the <a href="/wiki/Lorenz_Curve" id="w">Lorenz Curve</a>. On this scale 0 represents perfect equality with everyone having the exact same income and 1 represents perfect inequality with one person having all income (Scores are then commonly multiplied by 100 to make them easier to understand).<sup id="_ref-Schiller, B.

Income inequality has many causes, some of which remain unknown and others which remain disputed. All societies feature some income inequality as the positions people hold in these societies vary in responsibility, importance and complexity. In order to provide sufficient incentive for a wide variety of occupations to be filled with motivated incumbents societies need to provide a variety of rewards.<sup id="_ref-Rhonda, L. (1998).

The vast majority of Americans derive their income from occupational tasks and the utilization of their expertise. Two notable exceptions are the <a href="/wiki/American_upper_class" id="w">upper</a> and <a href="/wiki/American_lower_class" id="w">lower class</a>, where the most common source of income was not occupational status.<sup id="_ref-Thompson, W.

As scarcity creates value, the increased acquisition and subsequent possession of expertise and skill certified through an academic degree increases compensation including income.

Thus, income differences between the varying levels of educational attainment were increasing. The resulting economic job market may be referred to as constituting a &#34;two-tier&#34; labor market.

<p>While the returns to education increased considerably in the United States since the 1980s, it has not increased as much in many European countries such as Germany, France or the United Kingdom (Freeman, Richard B. and Lawrence F. Katz, editors Differences and Changes in Wage Structures. National Bureau of Economic Research. Comparative Labor Markets Series. The University of Chicago Press, 1995). The reasons for this discrepancy in inequality trends between Europe and the United States is still the subject of much debate but recent work suggests that tight regulations of labor markets in Europe could have prevented the returns to education from rising there as much as in the United States, but at the expense of creating unemployment (Fernández-Kranz, Daniel, “Why has wage inequality increased more in the United States than in Europe: an empirical investigation of the demand and supply of skill,” Applied Economics, Vol. 38, April 2006).</p>

People 18 Years Old and Over, by Total Money Earnings in 2005, Age, Race, Hispanic Origin, and Sex." title="">[40]</a></sup> Despite, considerable progress in pursuing gender and racial equality, some social scientists attribute these discrepancies in income to continued discrimination.<sup id="_ref-Schaefer, R.

New York, NY: Prentice Hall." title="">[41]</a></sup> According to this perspective certain ethnic minorities and women receive fewer promotions and opportunities for occupation and economic advancement than others. In the case of women this concept is referred to as the <a href="/wiki/Glass_ceiling" id="w">glass ceiling</a> keeping women from climbing the occupational ladder. In terms of race, studies have shown that African Americans are less likely to be hired than European-Americans with the same qualifications.<sup id="_ref-The African American Odyssey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-The African American Odyssey" title="">[42]</a></sup> The continued prevalence of traditional gender roles and ethnic stereotypes may partially account for current levels of discrimination.<sup id="_ref-Schaefer, R.

Median income for male earners increased by 36.2% versus 157.2% among female earners. This mean that the median income of women rose 334.5% as fast as that of men. The extent by which men out-earned women reduced by 61.2%, indicating increased gender equality. Today male workers earn roughly 68.36% more than their female counterparts compared to 176.25% in 1953. Furthermore income has increased more or less continuously for women, while the median earning for men have shown some fluctuation and stagnation since the early 1970s. The median income of men in 2005 was 2% higher than in 1973 compared to a 74.6% increase for female earners.<sup id="_ref-US Census Bureau. (2006).
