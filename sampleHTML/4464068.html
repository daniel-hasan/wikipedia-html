<p>The Presbyterian Ladies&#39; College, Sydney was the first Presbyterian school for girls, and the second Presbyterian school (after the now defunct <a href="/wiki/Cooerwull_Academy" id="w">Cooerwull Academy</a> for boys&#39; in 1882) established in the <a href="/wiki/Colony" id="w">colony</a> of New South Wales.<sup id="_ref-GHvii_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GHvii" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="Foundation" name="Foundation"></a><h3>Foundation</h3>
<p>The school was founded with 39 girls, on <a href="/wiki/30_January" id="w">30 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1888" id="w">1888</a>, at &#34;Fernlea&#34;, a fourteen-roomed gentleman&#39;s residence set in three <a href="/wiki/Acre" id="w">acres</a> of ground at Victoria Street, <a href="/wiki/Ashfield%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Ashfield</a>, the current site of the Masonic Hospital.

The decision to commence a Ladies&#39; College was made in 1883 when the Assembly formed a special committee to investigate the establishment of Superior <a href="/wiki/Boarding_school" id="w">Boarding Schools</a> for girls and boys. The church saw an urgency to provide Presbyterian education in the colony due to the growth in <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" id="w">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="/wiki/Secondary_school" id="w">secondary schools</a>. Many expressed fear of the outcome of this growth with Rev. James Cameron stating: {{cquote}} </p>
<p>The New South Wales <a href="/wiki/Scottish_people" id="w">Scottish</a> community had also expressed dissatisfaction with the educational options available to their <a href="/wiki/Children" id="w">children</a>. The N.S.W Assembly was, however, also inspired to establish a Ladies&#39; College by less worthy motives. For example, in the &#34;rival&#34; colony of <a href="/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)" id="w">Victoria</a>, Presbyterians had had a Ladies&#39; College since 1875, and so it was felt that N.S.W Presbyterians should also have one. Further, other <a href="/wiki/Protestant" id="w">Protestant</a> denominations had Ladies&#39; Colleges, therefore the Presbyterians should have one too.<sup id="_ref-GH1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH1" title="">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<p>By July 1887, the committee had purchased the Ashfield property and <a href="/wiki/Advertised" id="w">advertised</a> far and wide for an appropriate <a href="/wiki/Principal_(school)" id="w">principal</a>. They unanimously selected <a href="/wiki/John_Marden" id="w">Dr. John Marden</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Science" id="w">science</a> master from the <a href="/wiki/Methodist_Ladies%26%2339%3B_College%2C_Melbourne" id="w">Methodist Ladies&#39; College</a> in <a href="/wiki/Melbourne%2C_Victoria" id="w">Melbourne</a>, &#34;because of his high academic standing, his experience and success in teaching and his high Christian character&#34;.<sup id="_ref-GH9_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH9" title="">[11]</a></sup> Marden was a strong believer in <a href="/wiki/Equal_opportunity" id="w">equal opportunity</a> in education, and has been described as an &#34;early feminist&#34; and &#34;truly a man before his time&#34;. He was once quoted as saying: {{cquote2}} </p>
<p>By August 1888, the College had outgrown the Ashfield residence, which had always been considered a temporary home, and Council began discussing alternative sites in the nearby suburb of Croydon. On <a href="/wiki/5_September" id="w">5 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1889" id="w">1889</a>, Col. John Hay Goodlet told the council of &#34;Shubra Hall&#34;, the home of <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Horderns" id="w">Anthony Hordern III</a> at Croydon, and urged Council to purchase it. Subsequently, the property was purchased on 26 October for £7,500. Plans were promptly drawn up for the additional buildings required, and by the beginning of the school year of 1891, the new site was complete and ready to commence furnishing as the permanent home of P.L.C.<sup id="_ref-GH30_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH30" title="">[12]</a></sup> Marden consolidated the new school and, keenly interested in <a href="/wiki/Horticulture" id="w">horticulture</a>, laid out beautiful <a href="/wiki/Garden" id="w">gardens</a> and <a href="/wiki/Playing_field" id="w">playing fields</a>.<sup id="_ref-ADBMarden_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ADBMarden" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>The Presbyterian</i> reported of the opening of the College on 10 March, by the new <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_New_South_Wales" id="w">Governor of N.S.W.</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Victor_Child-Villiers%2C_7th_Earl_of_Jersey" id="w">Rt. Hon. Victor Albert George, Earl of Jersey</a> at its new site: 
{{cquote}}</p>
<p>The opening of the new buildings received wide publicity in the <a href="/wiki/Newspaper" id="w">papers</a> of March 1891. This was principally due to an <a href="/wiki/Impromptu_speaking" id="w">impromptu speech</a> made by the <a href="/wiki/Countess" id="w">Countess</a> of Jersey, Margaret Child-Villiers, of which was considered a controversial and ground-breaking move, as it was most unusual for women to speak in public. Encouraged by her <a href="/wiki/Husband" id="w">husband</a>, the Countess spoke of the opportunities available to girls at the college, the future role of Australian women, and the need for life-long learning. P.L.C&#39;s &#34;Jersey Day&#34;, an annual event where <a href="/wiki/Alumni" id="w">ex-students</a> return to the college on the Sunday closest to 10 March, is named in the Countesses honour.<sup id="_ref-Jersey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jersey" title="">[14]</a></sup>

By 1902, space had again become a problem due to increasing enrolments. Marden urged that new classrooms be built, which Council reluctantly agreed to. These buildings comprising six classrooms downstairs and eighteen rooms upstairs, were finished and handed over by the <a href="/wiki/Contractor" id="w">contractor</a> on <a href="/wiki/6_October" id="w">6 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1904" id="w">1904</a>, at a cost of £2,000. This increase in enrolments also convinced Council of the need to set up a branch school on another site, preferably on the <a href="/wiki/North_Shore_(Sydney)" id="w">North Shore</a>. A committee was set up in June 1907 to study the feasibility of a second school, yet recommendations were not considered by the Council. By 1913, space at the college was at a premium. Marden reported that many applications were being refused because of &#34;shortness of space&#34;. This matter was taken to the <a href="/wiki/General_Assembly_(presbyterian_church)" id="w">General Assembly</a> of 1913, resulting in the approval of the establishment of a branch at <a href="/wiki/Pymble%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Pymble</a> under the Council of P.L.C Sydney. The Council was given £5,000 to erect new buildings and lay out the grounds. &#34;The Presbyterian Ladies&#39; College, Pymble&#34; was opened on <a href="/wiki/8_February" id="w">8 February</a>, <a href="/wiki/1916" id="w">1916</a> with 48 day girls and 86 boarders.<sup id="_ref-GH30_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH30" title="">[12]</a></sup>
This school is still in existence, and is now known as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pymble_Ladies%26%2339%3B_College" id="w">Pymble Ladies&#39; College</a>&#34;. The opening of the Pymble campus necessitated a change of name for the Croydon college, from &#34;The Presbyterian Ladies&#39; College, Sydney&#34; to <b>The Presbyterian Ladies&#39; College, Croydon</b>.<sup id="_ref-GH30_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH30" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The &#34;Presbyterian Ladies&#39; College, <a href="/wiki/Beecroft%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Beecroft</a>&#34; was established by P.L.C Sydney in 1924 with thirteen students. It was to serve as a <a href="/wiki/Primary_school" id="w">primary</a> <a href="/wiki/Feeder_school" id="w">feeder school</a> for the College, however it did not receive adequate attention from college council and was forced to close in 1929. This school was reopened in 1930 by the assistant teacher, Miss Gurney, who named it &#34;Arden&#34;. The school flourished under Gurney&#39;s leadership and thus &#34;<a href="/wiki/Arden_Anglican_School" id="w">Arden Anglican School</a>&#34; is still in existence today.<sup id="_ref-GH58_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH58" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="World_War_Two" name="World_War_Two"></a><h3>World War Two</h3>
<p>1942 saw major upheaval and difficulties for the college. The new Principal, Dr. Helen Wilkie, arrived to find falling enrolments, staffing problems and food shortages due to the effects of the raging <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">Second World War</a>. The situation was made much worse as word was received that <a href="/wiki/Australian_military" id="w">Australian military</a> authorities wished to inspect the school with a view to taking it over. On <a href="/wiki/24_March" id="w">24 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>, it was requested that the school be occupied by the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" id="w">Royal Australian Air Force</a> for the purpose of establishing a top secret <a href="/wiki/Radar" id="w">Radar Unit</a> and military <a href="/wiki/Barracks" id="w">barracks</a><sup id="_ref-GH89_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH89" title="">[16]</a></sup> known as No.1 RIMU (Radio Installation and Maintenance Unit).<sup id="_ref-Radar_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Radar" title="">[17]</a></sup> As a result, Council approached <a href="/wiki/Meriden_School" id="w">Meriden School</a> in <a href="/wiki/Strathfield%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Strathfield</a> to see if P.L.C could be accommodated there.

Further, the school purchased &#34;Lingwood&#34;, a property in Strathfield, as a centre for the schools remaining activities.
In spite of the apparent happy association with Meriden, Dr. Wilkie, recommended that further integration with the school should not proceed, and thus at the end of 1924, Meriden indicated that they would no longer house the P.L.C boarders.<sup id="_ref-GH89_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH89" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>From here, P.L.C moved to &#34;Lauriston&#34; (now the primary school of <a href="/wiki/Santa_Sabina_College" id="w">Santa Sabina College</a>) and &#34;Welbeck&#34;, on The Boulevarde at Strathfield. In July 1944, the owners of Lingwood asked if the school was interested in buying the property. Council agreed to the purchase in order to use the house as a Kindergarten <a href="/wiki/Feeder_school" id="w">feeder school</a> for the college, or as a site for a permanent move. A few months later, Council decided that the future of P.L.C lay in Strathfield and not in Croydon, and offered the Croydon campus to the <a href="/wiki/Military" id="w">military</a> for £36,500. Plans were subsequently drawn up to purchase Welbeck and Lauriston to form the new P.L.C.<sup id="_ref-GH89_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH89" title="">[16]</a></sup> </p>

In 1945, after intervention by the Education Trust of the N.S.W General Assembly, which had been investigating the future of the college, Council decided that the Strathfield proposal was not viable. It was agreed that P.L.C would reopen at Croydon in first <a href="/wiki/Academic_term" id="w">term</a> 1946. The military agreed to pay for the extensive <a href="/wiki/Renovation" id="w">renovations</a> that were needed, with the final <a href="/wiki/Cheque" id="w">cheque</a> handed over from the <a href="/wiki/Government" id="w">government</a> on <a href="/wiki/21_March" id="w">21 March</a> <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a>. &#34;Lauriston&#34; and &#34;Welbeck&#34; were subsequently disposed of in 1946, however, the Lingwood property was retained as a <a href="/wiki/Preparatory_school" id="w">preparatory school</a>. Negotiations were entered into with Miss Margaret Thompson, the owner and principal of &#34;Branxton&#34;, a <a href="/wiki/Private_school" id="w">private school</a> in Homebush Road, Strathfield. It was agreed that Thompson would close her school and move it to the Lingwood property where it would retain the name &#34;Branxton&#34;,{{Ref_label}} and come under the control of P.L.C Council. Branxton had an informal link to the College prior to 1946, as it had been founded by the <a href="/wiki/Sister" id="w">sister</a> of an ex-student, and many Branxton students had gone on to complete their <a href="/wiki/High_school" id="w">high school</a> education at P.L.C.<sup id="_ref-GH89_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH89" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1977, a <a href="/wiki/Basis_of_Union_(Uniting_Church_in_Australia)" id="w">Union</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Congregational_church" id="w">Congregational</a>, <a href="/wiki/Methodist" id="w">Methodist</a> and Presbyterian Churches took place, forming the <a href="/wiki/Uniting_Church_of_Australia" id="w">Uniting Church of Australia</a>. Approximately half of the Presbyterian Church decided to remain Presbyterian and consequently the property of the Church had to be divided. In May of that year, it was announced that P.L.C Croydon was to remain Presbyterian and P.L.C Pymble would be transferred, and its name changed to &#34;Pymble Ladies&#39; College&#34;. Subsequently, in 1978 it was decided that P.L.C Croydon should return to its originally intended name of &#34;The Presbyterian Ladies&#39; College, Sydney&#34;.<sup id="_ref-GH129_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH129" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Fees" name="Fees"></a><h2> Fees </h2>
<p>As with all Australian independent schools, P.L.C is not a full fee paying institution, due to it receiving limited government funding; full fees only apply to international students, who are not subsidised by any government funding. For non-international students, 2007 fees range from <a href="/wiki/Australian_dollar" id="w">AUD$11</a>,988 to AUD$18,656 per annum, and in excess of AUD$30,000 per annum for boarding students.<sup id="_ref-Fees07_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fees07" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>P.L.C Sydney offers <a href="/wiki/Scholarship" id="w">scholarships</a> and bursaries that provide all or part remission of tuition fees to students who are Australian citizens, Permanent Residents of Australia or refugees. Academic scholarships are based on the results of the ACER Scholarship Examination, and are typically offered from Year 7 onwards. In addition to those awarded for academic performance, P.L.C also offers music and boarding scholarships. Indigenous Bursary&#39;s are available for students of <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" id="w">Aboriginal</a> or <a href="/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders" id="w">Torres Strait Islander</a> background, and are awarded following an interview with the Principal where the situation of the individual student and the family is considered.<sup id="_ref-Scholarships_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Scholarships" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

In 1939 the General Assembly of Australia adopted a new crest: the star of David disappeared, the Latin cross was added and the floral emblems were redrawn with the thistle in centre position.

<p>Dr Helen Wilkie (1895-1984), Principal of P.L.C Sydney from 1942 to 1946, came from <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh%2C_Scotland" id="w">Edinburgh</a> in 1937 to be Headmistress at <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian_Ladies%26%2339%3B_College%2C_Armidale" id="w">P.L.C Armidale</a>. On her appointment to Croydon she was almost immediately confronted with the College&#39;s takeover by the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" id="w">RAAF</a> and organised the move of the college to several houses at <a href="/wiki/Strathfield%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Strathfield</a>. <b>Colour</b>: <font color="#800000">Maroon</font> <b>Mascot</b>: Wallaby <b>Established</b>: 1995<sup id="_ref-PLCHouses_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PLCHouses" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<a id="P.L.C_Armidale_alliance" name="P.L.C_Armidale_alliance"></a><h2> P.L.C Armidale alliance </h2>
<p>In late August 2005, due to financial troubles at the <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian_Ladies%26%2339%3B_College%2C_Armidale" id="w">Presbyterian Ladies&#39; College, Armidale</a>, it was announced that P.L.C Armidale and P.L.C Sydney would join together to form an <a href="/wiki/Alliance" id="w">alliance</a>. The aim of this alliance is to strengthen P.L.C Armidale through cooperative <a href="/wiki/Marketing" id="w">marketing</a>, a change in <a href="/wiki/Management" id="w">management</a> and a stronger financial base. It should also be of benefit to both schools through student exchanges, accommodation for sporting events or <a href="/wiki/Excursion" id="w">excursions</a>, and a &#39;country or city&#39; option for prospective students.</p>
<p>In the September-October 2005 edition of the Presbyterian Church in New South Wales&#39; <i>Church Offices Newsletter</i>, the <a href="/wiki/Chair_(official)" id="w">Chairman</a> of <a href="/wiki/Trustee" id="w">Trustees</a>, Jeof Falls, announced this alliance between the two schools:

<a id="Ex-Students'_Union" name="Ex-Students'_Union"></a><h2>Ex-Students&#39; Union</h2>
<p><b>The Ex-Students&#39; Union</b> was <a href="/wiki/Inauguration" id="w">inaugurated</a> on the evening of <a href="/wiki/9_December" id="w">9 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1905" id="w">1905</a>, when at the invitation of <a href="/wiki/John_Marden" id="w">Dr. Marden</a>, several former students discussed the proposal, elected as their <a href="/wiki/President" id="w">President</a> the then Lady <a href="/wiki/Superintendent_(education)" id="w">Superintendent</a>, Miss Marion Pickard, and formed a <a href="/wiki/Committee" id="w">committee</a> to produce a <a href="/wiki/Constitution_(corporate)" id="w">constitution</a>. These were confirmed at a General Meeting on Jersey Day 1906, and the committee took <a href="/wiki/Term_of_office" id="w">office</a> until 1907. 
At its foundation, the main objective of the union was to:{{Ref_label}}{{cquote2}}</p>
<p>The Union achieved much in its first few years, renting a building in the <a href="/wiki/Sydney_central_business_district" id="w">CBD</a> to serve as a club and committee meeting place, making garments for <a href="/wiki/Hospital" id="w">hospitals</a>, visiting <a href="/wiki/Kindergarten" id="w">Kindergartens</a>, the <a href="/wiki/YWCA" id="w">YWCA</a>, Home of Peace, Infants&#39; Home and the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Institute_for_Deaf_and_Blind_Children" id="w">Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children</a>. An Ex-Students&#39; <a href="/wiki/Orchestra" id="w">Orchestra</a> and Dramatic Club were formed, and <a href="/wiki/Tennis" id="w">Tennis</a> and <a href="/wiki/Croquet" id="w">Croquet</a> matches were held between current and former pupils.<sup id="_ref-GH312_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH312" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1916 the Pymble College was opened and its first Ex-Students&#39; expressed an interest in joining the Union. Subsequently, a combined Union was formed, known as &#34;The P.L.C Croydon and Pymble Ex-Students&#39; Union&#34;, and an Ex-Students&#39; prize was established at Pymble on the same conditions as at Croydon.<sup id="_ref-GH312_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH312" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the Unions&#39; most significant contributions to the school was planned following the death of Dr. Marden in 1924. With the desire to provide Marden with a &#34;fitting and lasting memorial&#34;, it was decided that a <a href="/wiki/Library" id="w">library</a>, to be called the &#34;John Marden Memorial Library&#34;, should be built at the Croydon College. This building was opened by Mrs. Marden in 1927 and although no longer suitable as a library due its size, remains a treasured part of the school.<sup id="_ref-GH312_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH312" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1929, it was proposed that &#34;Pymble students should form a separate Union&#34; and that an equitable division of Union <a href="/wiki/Funds" id="w">funds</a> should be undertaken. This explains the two separate groups that exist today, however it is still not uncommon for Pymble students to attend Croydon <a href="/wiki/Reunion" id="w">reunions</a> and events, particularly those in regional areas or interstate.<sup id="_ref-GH312_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GH312" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
