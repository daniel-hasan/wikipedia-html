<p>The <b>Banana massacre</b>, in Spanish, <i>Matanza de las bananeras</i><sup id="_ref-E_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-E" title="">[1]</a></sup> or <i>Masacre de las bananeras</i> was a massacre of workers for the <a href="/wiki/United_Fruit_Company" id="w">United Fruit Company</a> that occurred on <a href="/wiki/December_6" id="w">December 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1928" id="w">1928</a> in the town of <a href="/wiki/Ci%C3%A9naga%2C_Magdalena" id="w">Ciénaga</a> near <a href="/wiki/Santa_Marta" id="w">Santa Marta</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colombia" id="w">Colombia</a>. An unknown number of workers died<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> after the government decided to send the military forces to end a month long <a href="/wiki/Strike_action" id="w">strike</a> organized by the workers&#39; <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" id="w">union</a> in order to demand better working conditions.</p>
<a id="Strike" name="Strike"></a><h2>Strike</h2>
<p>The workers of the banana plantations in Colombia went on strike in December 1928. They demanded written contracts, eight-hour days, six-day weeks and the elimination of food coupons.  The strike turned into the largest labor movement ever witnessed in the country until then. Radical members of the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Colombia" id="w">Liberal Party</a>, as well as members of the Socialist and Communist Parties, participated.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Massacre" name="Massacre"></a><h2>Massacre</h2>
<p>An army regiment from <a href="/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1" id="w">Bogotá</a> was dispatched by the government to deal with the strikers, which it deemed to be subversive. Whether these troops were sent in at the behest of the United Fruit company was and remained a matter of debate.</p>
<p>The troops set up their machine guns on the roofs of the low buildings at the corners of the main square, closed off the access streets,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>
and after a five minute warning<sup id="_ref-E_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-E" title="">[1]</a></sup> opened fire into a dense Sunday crowd of workers and their wives and children who had gathered, after Sunday Mass,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> to wait for an anticipated address from the governor.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Number_dead" name="Number_dead"></a><h2>Number dead</h2>
<p>General Cortés Vargas, who commanded the troops during the massacre, took responsibility for 47 casualties, but the exact number of casualties has never been confirmed. Herrera Soto, co-author of a comprehensive and detailed study of the 1928 strike, has put together various estimates given by contemporaries and historians, ranging from 47 to 2,000.<sup id="_ref-E_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-E" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Among the survivors was Luis Vicente Gámez, later a famous local figure, who survived by hiding under a bridge for three days. Every year after the massacre he delivered a memorial service over the radio.</p>
<a id="Justifications" name="Justifications"></a><h2>Justifications</h2>
<p>General <a href="/wiki/Cort%C3%A9s_Vargas" id="w">Cortés Vargas</a>, who issued the order to shoot, argued later that he had issued the order because he had information that U.S. boats were poised to land troops on Colombian coasts to defend American personnel and the interests of the United Fruit Company. Vargas issued the order so the US would not invade Colombia. This position was strongly criticized in the <a href="/wiki/Senate_of_Colombia" id="w">Senate</a>, especially by  <a href="/wiki/Jorge_Eli%C3%A9cer_Gait%C3%A1n" id="w">Jorge Eliécer Gaitán</a>, who argued that those same bullets should have been used to stop the foreign invader.<a class="externallink" href="http://64.233.179.104/translate_c?hl=en&#38;sl=es&#38;u=http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masacre_de_las_Bananeras&#38;prev=/search%3Fq%3DMasacre%2Bde%2Blas%2BBananeras%2Bwikipedia%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26hs%3DPrQ%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DG" rel="nofollow" title="http://64.233.179.104/translate_c?hl=en&#38;sl=es&#38;u=http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masacre_de_las_Bananeras&#38;prev=/search%3Fq%3DMasacre%2Bde%2Blas%2BBananeras%2Bwikipedia%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26hs%3DPrQ%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DG">http://64.233.179.104/translate_c?hl=en&#38;sl=es&#38;u=http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masacre_de_las_Bananeras&#38;prev=/search%3Fq%3DMasacre%2Bde%2Blas%2BBananeras%2Bwikipedia%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26hs%3DPrQ%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DG</a></p>
