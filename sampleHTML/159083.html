<p>The <b>Ford Taurus</b> is an <a href="/wiki/Automobile" id="w">automobile</a> manufactured by the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company" id="w">Ford Motor Company</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. Initially a <a href="/wiki/Front-wheel_drive" id="w">front-wheel drive</a> <a href="/wiki/Mid-size_car" id="w">mid-size car</a>, it was introduced in December 1985, replacing the <a href="/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive" id="w">rear-wheel drive</a> <a href="/wiki/Ford_LTD" id="w">Ford LTD</a>. Today&#39;s Taurus is a <a href="/wiki/Full-size_car" id="w">full-size car</a> available in front- or <a href="/wiki/All-wheel_drive" id="w">all-wheel drive</a>. The Taurus was mainly sold in North America, but the third generation model was exported to <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Asia" id="w">Asia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> in a slightly modified form. Throughout its life, the Taurus has had a <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(automobile)" id="w">Mercury</a> sibling, the <a href="/wiki/Mercury_Sable" id="w">Sable</a>. Most Tauruses have been built in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago, Illinois</a> or in Ford&#39;s Hapeville Plant near <a href="/wiki/Atlanta%2C_Georgia" id="w">Atlanta, Georgia</a>.</p>
<p>The original Taurus was a milestone design for Ford and the entire American automotive industry, as well as a very influential vehicle in the marketplace. Ford has sold over 6.7&#160;million Tauruses worldwide during its 20 years of production.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Between 1992 and 1996, the Taurus was the best-selling car in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, prompting <a href="/wiki/Honda" id="w">Honda</a> to grow the U.S. version of the <a href="/wiki/Honda_Accord" id="w">Accord</a> to a similar size.<sup id="_ref-bestselling_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bestselling" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Taurus eventually lost its best-seller status in 1997 to the <a href="/wiki/Toyota_Camry" id="w">Toyota Camry</a>.<sup id="_ref-det_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-det" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Production initially ended on <a href="/wiki/October_27" id="w">October 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, with 2007 being the last model year.<sup id="_ref-Fox_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fox" title="">[4]</a></sup> However, Ford revived the Taurus name by renaming the facelifted <a href="/wiki/Ford_Five_Hundred" id="w">Ford Five Hundred</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ford_Freestyle" id="w">Ford Freestyle</a> &#34;Taurus&#34; and &#34;Taurus X&#34;, respectively,<sup id="_ref-DETROIT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DETROIT" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-taurusx_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-taurusx" title="">[6]</a></sup> and have announced that a new Taurus is in development for a 2010 release.<sup id="_ref-autosavant_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-autosavant" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>When Ford set out to develop the Taurus, they employed a strategy of teamwork that would prove revolutionary in the car development process.<sup id="_ref-Taub_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> Previously, at both Ford and <a href="/wiki/General_Motors" id="w">General Motors</a>, interior and exterior designers worked separately with no input from each other or from engineers. As a result, the interiors and exteriors of many American cars seemed &#34;mismatched&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Taub_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> Taurus development started in 1981, using a method similar to that Ford used when developing the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Escort_(North_American)" id="w">Escort</a>, in which engineers from all Ford branches worldwide worked together.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Unlike the Escort, though, the Taurus was developed entirely by American engineers at Ford&#39;s headquarters.<sup id="_ref-Taub_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> The new engineering team was assembled by designer <a href="/wiki/Jack_Telnack" id="w">Jack Telnack</a>, and was dubbed &#34;Team Taurus&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Taub_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Taurus went through many revisions throughout its development. Original prototypes contained a full glass roof similar to that of the <a href="/wiki/Subaru_SVX" id="w">Subaru SVX</a>, though it was deemed &#34;too radical&#34; and abandoned.<sup id="_ref-Taub_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> Customer input played an instrumental role in the Taurus&#39; development, as many components including <a href="/wiki/Radio" id="w">radios</a>, <a href="/wiki/Steering_wheel" id="w">steering wheels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Seat" id="w">seats</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wheel" id="w">wheels</a>, and entire <a href="/wiki/Suspension_(vehicle)" id="w">suspension</a> setups were selected by large numbers of average people though a series of surveys conducted by Ford.<sup id="_ref-Taub_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> In addition, Ford disassembled many competing cars such as the <a href="/wiki/Toyota_Camry" id="w">Toyota Camry</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Honda_Accord" id="w">Honda Accord</a>, and the more luxurious <a href="/wiki/BMW_E28" id="w">BMW 5 Series</a> in order to examine their parts and components.<sup id="_ref-Taub_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ford premiered the Taurus in a resounding way. In mid-1985, Ford gathered executives and the press for the unveiling of the Taurus and Mercury Sable. The event took place at the <a href="/wiki/MGM_Studios" id="w">MGM Studios</a> Soundstage 85, where <i><a href="/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)" id="w">Gone with the Wind</a></i> had been filmed.<sup id="_ref-Taub_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> The studio was decorated in a space theme, with stars on the walls, <a href="/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object" id="w">flying saucer</a> decorations, and refreshments served in flying saucer shaped coolers.<sup id="_ref-Taub_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> For the unveiling, &#34;space&#34; music started playing, as projected stars floated around the room in dance floor fashion. The outlines of the cars glowed green through the curtain; as the curtain flew up, strobe lights flashed, highlighting the cars.<sup id="_ref-Taub_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> Many industry journalists, as well as executives at Ford and <a href="/wiki/Chrysler" id="w">Chrysler</a>, believed the Taurus was going to be a failure.<sup id="_ref-Taub_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> Chrysler executives believed customers would instead embrace their more conventional <a href="/wiki/Dodge_Dynasty" id="w">Dodge Dynasty</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chrysler_New_Yorker" id="w">Chrysler New Yorker</a>.<sup id="_ref-Taub_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> Executives at Ford knew producing the Taurus was a gamble, as they ran the risk of the car being so advanced it would turn off potential customers. As a result, Ford continued to produce the LTD, which the Taurus was designed to replace in 1986.<sup id="_ref-Taub_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> If the Taurus failed, Ford would have to file for <a href="/wiki/Chapter_11%2C_Title_11%2C_United_States_Code" id="w">Chapter 11</a> <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy" id="w">bankruptcy</a>.<sup id="_ref-Taub_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> The Taurus, however, ended up being a resounding success, selling over a million units in its first generation alone.<sup id="_ref-Taub_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="First_generation_(1986_%E2%80%93_1991)" name="First_generation_(1986_%E2%80%93_1991)"></a><h2>First generation (1986 – 1991)</h2>
<p>{{Infobox Automobile generation}}</p>
<p>The first-generation Taurus was launched in 1986 to strong fanfare and sales, replacing the slow-selling LTD. Upon the Taurus&#39; debut, Ford was producing a range of rear-wheel drive cars, as <a href="/wiki/Chrysler" id="w">Chrysler</a> and <a href="/wiki/General_Motors" id="w">General Motors</a> offered more front-wheel drive vehicles. With the introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Ford_Tempo" id="w">Tempo</a>, Ford had started its own transition to front-wheel drive. The Taurus displayed a rounder shape than its contemporaries, often likened to a &#39;<a href="/wiki/Jelly_bean" id="w">jelly bean</a>&#39; or &#39;flying potato&#39;,<sup id="_ref-jellybean_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jellybean" title="">[10]</a></sup> inspired by the design of the <a href="/wiki/Audi_100#C3, 1983–92" id="w">Audi 5000</a> and Ford&#39;s own Tempo. The aerodynamic design of the Taurus was not purely cosmetic, however. Its aerodynamic shape made the car more fuel efficient, allowing Ford to meet the more stringent <a href="/wiki/Corporate_Average_Fuel_Economy" id="w">Corporate Average Fuel Economy</a> (CAFE) standards applied by the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> government.<sup id="_ref-Taub_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> The Taurus&#39; success ultimately led to an American <a href="/wiki/Automobile_design" id="w">automobile design</a> revolution; Chrysler and General Motors developed aerodynamic cars in order to capitalize on the Taurus&#39; success.<sup id="_ref-Taub_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Taurus and Sable used flush aerodynamic composite <a href="/wiki/Headlights" id="w">headlights</a>, and were the first mainstream sedans from a U.S. automaker to use the new lights. Instead of a conventional <a href="/wiki/Grille" id="w">grille</a>, the Taurus had a front panel to adopt a grille-less &#39;bottom breather&#39; nose, first pioneered by the <a href="/wiki/Citro%C3%ABn_DS" id="w">Citroën DS</a> in the 1950s, and also used briefly on the Mustang. Some special performance models were fitted with additional ventilation openings. The Sable twin had a wraparound &#34;lightbar&#34; with two headlights and a low-wattage stretch in between. The doors went into the roof, and the handles were recessed. The Taurus also had large glass areas, which were flushed into the body, not recessed. </p>
<p>The interior was available with bucket seats, a rare feature for most American mid-size sedans at the time, and the <a href="/wiki/Dashboard" id="w">dashboard</a> wrapped around the driver and flowed into the door panels to create more of a &#34;cockpit&#34; feel.<sup id="_ref-bestselling_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bestselling" title="">[2]</a></sup> The interior contained many innovations, such as a storage box on the rear shelf,<sup id="_ref-G1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-G1" title="">[11]</a></sup> seats designed to provide maximum comfort for their occupant no matter what position they were in,<sup id="_ref-Taub_r" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> and a rear seat that was raised slightly higher than the front seat so rear passengers could see the road ahead of them.<sup id="_ref-Taub_s" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">1989-1991 Ford Taurus wagon</div></p>
<p>The Taurus originally came in four models, MT-5, L, GL, and LX. The MT-5 and L models were basic, starting at <a href="/wiki/USD" id="w">US$10</a>,500, with the GL offering a few interior upgrades like rear headrests and a folding armrest, as well as the standard 3.0&#160;litre V6.<sup id="_ref-bestselling_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bestselling" title="">[2]</a></sup> The LX was loaded with <a href="/wiki/Air_conditioning" id="w">air conditioning</a>, <a href="/wiki/Power_window" id="w">power windows</a>, power seats, electric door locks, a cassette stereo and <a href="/wiki/Cruise_control" id="w">cruise control</a>, although these features were also available as options on the other cars. The top-of-the-line LX <a href="/wiki/Station_wagon" id="w">station wagon</a> sold for $14,300.<sup id="_ref-bestselling_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bestselling" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>For 1986, the engines were a 90&#160;horsepower (67&#160;kW) 2.5&#160;litre <i><a href="/wiki/Ford_HSC_engine" id="w">HSC</a></i> four-cylinder found in the <a href="/wiki/Manual_transmission" id="w">MT-5</a> and L models or a new 140&#160;horsepower (104&#160;kW) 3.0&#160;litre <a href="/wiki/Ford_Vulcan_engine" id="w">Vulcan</a> <a href="/wiki/V6_engine" id="w">V6</a>, optional on the L and standard on the GL and LX models. The MT-5 was equipped with a five-speed <a href="/wiki/Manual_transmission" id="w">manual transmission</a>, Vulcan models used a newly-designed four-speed <a href="/wiki/Ford_AXOD_transmission" id="w">AXOD</a> <a href="/wiki/Automatic_transmission" id="w">automatic</a>, while HSC-equipped cars used the 3-speed <a href="/wiki/Ford_ATX_transmission" id="w">ATX</a> automatic. Ford&#39;s 3.8&#160;litre <a href="/wiki/Ford_Essex_V6_engine_(Canadian)" id="w">Essex</a> <a href="/wiki/V6_engine" id="w">V6</a> was added to the lineup in 1988. Although the power output was rated at the same 140&#160;horsepower (104&#160;kW) as the 3.0&#160;litre engine, this V6 produced 215&#160;ft•lbf (291&#160;N•m) of <a href="/wiki/Torque" id="w">torque</a>. However, the 3.8 is known for premature failure of <a href="/wiki/Head_gasket" id="w">head gaskets</a>.<sup id="_ref-bestselling_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bestselling" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1990, the interior received a facelift, incorporating a new <a href="/wiki/Steering_wheel" id="w">steering wheel</a> design with an <a href="/wiki/Airbag" id="w">airbag</a>, a new <a href="/wiki/Gear_shift" id="w">gear shifter</a> and a new <a href="/wiki/Dashboard" id="w">dashboard</a> with a new instrument panel.<sup id="_ref-G1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-G1" title="">[11]</a></sup> The 2.5&#160;litre four was given <a href="/wiki/Sequential_fuel_injection" id="w">sequential fuel injection</a>, increasing power by 15&#160;horsepower (11.2&#160;kW) and torque by 10&#160;ft•lbf (13.6&#160;N•m), as did the 3.0&#160;litre V6, although output remained the same for that engine.<sup id="_ref-Engines_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Engines" title="">[12]</a></sup> All but the SHO were fitted with a four-speed automatic for 1990 and a new electronic <a href="/wiki/Ford_AXOD-E_transmission" id="w">AXOD-E</a> transmission in 1991. LX cars were also fitted with <a href="/wiki/Anti-lock_brake" id="w">anti-lock brakes</a> as standard that year.<sup id="_ref-bestselling_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bestselling" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Ford Taurus SHO with the &#34;Plus&#34; package</div></p>
<p>In 1989, Ford added the performance-oriented SHO model, which stands for &#34;Super High Output&#34;.<sup id="_ref-G1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-G1" title="">[11]</a></sup> This was substantiated by a <a href="/wiki/Ford_SHO_V6_engine" id="w">Yamaha 3.0 L</a> <a href="/wiki/V6" id="w">V6</a> that made 220 hp and 200 ft·lbf.  Although Ford&#39;s reasons for creating the SHO are unclear, it is best known that it was created to use up engines that were meant for a competitor for the <a href="/wiki/Toyota_MR2" id="w">Toyota MR2</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pontiac_Fiero" id="w">Pontiac Fiero</a> that was shelved in the middle of development.<sup id="_ref-SHONTELL_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SHONTELL" title="">[13]</a></sup> As a result, Ford initially advertised the SHO as a limited production vehicle.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> However, the SHO turned out to be more successful than Ford had expected, and production continued after 1989.<sup id="_ref-SHONTELL_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SHONTELL" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>The SHO differed from the normal Taurus on the exterior by having different bumpers, side cladding, fog lamps, and a rear spoiler. The interior also differed, with sports seats and an 8000&#160;rpm <a href="/wiki/Tachometer" id="w">tachometer</a>. The SHO became the only Taurus to feature a <a href="/wiki/Manual_transmission" id="w">manual transmission</a> since the MT5 was discontinued in that year.<sup id="_ref-G1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-G1" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>A special edition of the SHO called the Plus package became available in 1991. It came as part of option package #212A and contained different styling cues from the standard SHO, including a plastic &#39;Power Bulge&#39; hood, a plastic spoiler without the 3rd brake light, 24V V6 badges, body colored molding, non-painted mirrors, body color TAURUS badge, and non-SHO &#39;slicer&#39; wheels.  There were two special sub-options to the Plus package: White painted cars came with white painted wheels, and a plus exclusive Jade Green (sometimes called Deep Jade Green) was available only in 1991.<sup id="_ref-shotimes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shotimes" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>{{Infobox Automobile generation}}</p>
<p>The Taurus received its first significant cosmetic update in 1992. With the older model facing slumping sales, this new model brought sales back up again, with 410,000 examples sold during 1992, a number unheard of even today.<sup id="_ref-det_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-det" title="">[3]</a></sup> While the design was basically the same, every body panel except for the roof was changed. Ford also gave the Taurus what they called a &#39;smarter appointed interior&#39;,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> which offered such luxuries as <a href="/wiki/Air_conditioning" id="w">electronic automatic climate control</a> (an option for the LX and, later, SE; standard on SHO models), power sliding <a href="/wiki/Moonroof" id="w">moonroof</a>, leather seats, as well as other features. Wagon versions that retained the front bench seat and were equipped with the optional rear facing third seat had seating capacity for eight passengers.

The 2.5L four-cylinder engine had been eliminated after 1991, making the 3.0&#160;litre V6 standard in all non-SHO models (except the LX Wagon, which had the 3.8L standard) from 1992-on. The next year (1993), the cheaper L base model was dropped, as well as the &#34;InstaClear&#34; <a href="/wiki/Defroster" id="w">heated windshield</a> and the front <a href="/wiki/Cornering_lamp" id="w">cornering lamps</a> on LX models.<sup id="_ref-TCCA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TCCA" title="">[17]</a></sup> For both 3.0L and 3.8&#160;litre V6 engines, the drive belt system became a single-belt setup for 1993 (previously, the alternator had used a separate belt). A passenger-side airbag became standard for 1994, including a redesigned drivers side airbag and steering wheel (though this newer look had been on the SHO since 1993).<sup id="_ref-TCCA_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TCCA" title="">[17]</a></sup> Also for 1994, all wheel options were now 15&#160;inches. Previously, 14&#160;inch wheels were standard on GL models. For 1994 and 1995, the LX model received unique crystiline headlamps.<sup id="_ref-Consumerguide_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Consumerguide" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The last year of this updated Taurus generation was 1995. For the 1995 model year, a sportier <i>SE</i> model was added.<sup id="_ref-TCCA_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TCCA" title="">[17]</a></sup> It featured alloy wheels which were borrowed from the LX, had combination leather/cloth bucket seats separated by a console, unique &#34;Crystalline&#34; headlamp assemblies also borrowed from the LX, and a rear deck lid &#34;lip&#34; <a href="/wiki/Spoiler" id="w">spoiler</a> borrowed from the SHO.<sup id="_ref-TCCA_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TCCA" title="">[17]</a></sup> The SE trim had either the standard 3.0L Vulcan V6 or the optional 3.8L Essex V6.<sup id="_ref-TCCA_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TCCA" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second generation also came in a modified <a href="/wiki/Police" id="w">Police</a> version. A police Taurus was a GL trim with the 3.8&#160;litre Essex V6 engine that was slightly different than the regular Essex engine.<sup id="_ref-Engines_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Engines" title="">[12]</a></sup> The police version of this engine uses high silicone <a href="/wiki/Alloy" id="w">alloy</a> <a href="/wiki/Piston" id="w">pistons</a> which can be identified by two notches in the top of the piston. Output of the police Essex version was 15&#160;bhp greater than the standard due to the addition of a dual <a href="/wiki/Exhaust" id="w">exhaust</a> muffler system, similar to that standard on the SHO; a Y-pipe was added after the resonator which allowed for the split to both sides of the rear of the vehicle.<sup id="_ref-Wolfe_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wolfe" title="">[19]</a></sup> Other changes included a larger <a href="/wiki/Fuel_tank" id="w">fuel tank</a>, stainless steel <a href="/wiki/Brake_line" id="w">brake lines</a>, standard 4-wheel disc <a href="/wiki/Brake" id="w">brakes</a> with ABS, a modified front grille fascia that had a slit in it to allow for increased airflow to the radiator, and a calibrated 140&#160;mph <a href="/wiki/Speedometer" id="w">speedometer</a>.<sup id="_ref-TCCA_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TCCA" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

The SHO model continued with the same powertrain as before: The Yamaha-developed 3.0L V6 and 5-speed manual transmission. The second generation SHO also got its own front fascia that was basically the Mercury Sable&#39;s front fascia with a different bumper, fog lamps, and no middle lightbar.<sup id="_ref-TCCA_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TCCA" title="">[17]</a></sup> The SHO also got unique seats, wheels, side cladding, dual exhaust, as well as a unique rear bumper. </p>
<p>The lack of an automatic transmission had hurt sales, which was a situation that Ford rectified in 1993. A 3.2&#160;L version of the <a href="/wiki/Ford_SHO_V6_engine" id="w">Ford SHO V6 engine</a> was introduced for automatic-equipped SHO, which still had 220&#160;hp (164&#160;kW), but now boasted 215&#160;ft•lbf (292&#160;N•m), a 15&#160;ft•lbf (20.3&#160;N•m) increase over the 3.0&#160;L version.<sup id="_ref-Consumerguide_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Consumerguide" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1993, Ford did a minor redesign of the SHO interior, updating the center console. Other changes for 1993 included a trunklid spoiler, with integrated center high mount stop lamp.<sup id="_ref-TCCA_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TCCA" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second generation SHO entered popular culture due to the fact that a 1992 model is owned by comedian <a href="/wiki/Conan_O%26%2339%3BBrien" id="w">Conan O&#39;Brien</a>, and that he often talks about it on <a href="/wiki/Late_Night_with_Conan_O%26%2339%3BBrien" id="w">Late Night with Conan O&#39;Brien</a>, his late night <a href="/wiki/Talk_show" id="w">talk show</a>, when speaking about his personal life and interests.<sup id="_ref-Shoners_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shoners" title="">[20]</a></sup> He devoted a special segment of the show to his SHO onetime, where in a fictional skit, he set off to sell the vehicle and use the money to buy a large estate in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>. In the skit, he fails to sell the car, but then pretends to sell the car to <a href="/wiki/Brad_Pitt" id="w">Brad Pitt</a>. </p>
<p>By request of <a href="/wiki/Car_and_Driver" id="w">Car and Driver</a> magazine, a SHO station wagon was created by the Car and Driver staff with the help of Ford engineers.<sup id="_ref-CAD_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CAD" title="">[21]</a></sup> They started with a production Taurus wagon, and from there installed SHO bodywork, including its unique front end. They then replaced the stock engine and drivetrain with SHO drivetrain. Inside, the interior was replicated of that of a high spec SHO sedan, including its sport seats, steering wheel, and included most of the SHO&#39;s equipment.<sup id="_ref-CAD_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CAD" title="">[21]</a></sup> The staff then tested it, and took it on a cross country trip. The model became nothing more than a one off special, and the Car and Driver staff as well as Ford admitted that the SHO wagon was created &#34;just for fun&#34;, and was never meant to be a serious production vehicle.<sup id="_ref-CAD_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CAD" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>The 1996 model year saw the first complete redesign for the Taurus.

Ford had hoped the radical redesign would lead to the same success it had had with the 1986 Taurus.

<p>In an effort to reverse the declining sales of the Taurus, Ford tried to increase its appeal by making some cosmetic changes for the 1998 and 1999 model years. These changes included redesigning the <a href="/wiki/Grille" id="w">grille</a> openings in the front, changing the design from two oval openings to a full width opening for the air dam and moving the Ford logo down into an enlarged opening between the lights, mounted onto a <a href="/wiki/Jaguar_(automobile)" id="w">Jaguar</a>-esque &#39;motif bar&#39;. These years were also fitted with different <a href="/wiki/Headlight" id="w">headlight</a> lenses, featuring completely clear lenses and a multi-reflector surface in the rear of the housing, around the bulb; these were known as the &#39;disco ball&#39; headlights.

For 1996, the SHO model was redesigned. Unlike its predecessors, this SHO was more refined and used less radical bodywork. It differed from the normal Taurus with different seats, <a href="/wiki/Wheel" id="w">wheels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bumper" id="w">bumpers</a>, drivetrain, as well as a fin being put on the driver&#39;s side <a href="/wiki/Windshield_wiper" id="w">windshield wiper</a>, to keep it on the <a href="/wiki/Windshield" id="w">windshield</a> at high speeds. Unlike the previous SHOs though, this model was designed for comfort instead of performance.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>A 235&#160;hp (175&#160;kW) <a href="/wiki/Ford_Yamaha_V8_engine" id="w">3.4&#160;L DOHC V8</a> was specified for the SHO model, but it was given the same four speed transmission as the LX: the manual gearbox option was no longer offered on the SHO.<sup id="_ref-bestselling_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bestselling" title="">[2]</a></sup> Separation of the <a href="/wiki/Camshaft" id="w">camshaft</a> from its sprocket has been implicated in a growing number of engine failures, at around the 50,000&#160;mile (80,000&#160;km) mark.<sup id="_ref-v8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-v8" title="">[30]</a></sup> The standard warranty on this model was 36,000&#160;miles (58,000&#160;km).

The trim lines were completely rearranged for the 2000 model year. The most basic model was the LX, with the SE as the mid priced model, a new trim named &#34;SES&#34; as the value model, and the SEL as the highest end model, with the SEL slotting just under the <a href="/wiki/Mercury_Sable" id="w">Mercury Sable</a> GS.</p>
<p>The 2002 Taurus offered two free options on every trim level, including a CD player and power driver&#39;s seat on the <i>SE</i>, a power <a href="/wiki/Moonroof" id="w">moonroof</a> or leather interior on the <i>SES</i> and both of these luxury options on the <i>SEL</i>.

<div class="thumbcaption">SES Sport Rims</div> 2003 and 2004, the SES Deluxe model received a &#34;Sport&#34; package, which consisted of special, unique rims, similar in design to the SHO &#34;Slicer&#34; rims that were featured on later Gen I SHOs and all Gen II SHOs, and the Duratec engine, mated to the AX4N transmission, standard.  In addition, the exterior of the vehicle received Sport badging on the front quarter-panels, the interior received two-toned cloth seats, a two-toned dash applique, special &#34;Sport&#34; floor mats, and a leather covered steering wheel.  To complete the package, the &#34;spears&#34; on the front of rear of the vehicle, which housed the Ford emblem, were body colored.  SES Sport models were available in only Black, Patriot Blue, Matador Red, Silver Frost, and Dark Shadow Gray, while the only interior offered was Dark Charcoal.</p>
<p>For 2004, the Taurus got a new front bumper, headlights, taillights, as well as new wheel options. Inside were a new instrument cluster, steering wheel, as well as the addition of a diagnostic center in the gauge cluster, that would tell if there were any problems with the car, as well as average fuel economy. It also was able to perform a &#34;system check&#34; per request of the driver, to make sure that the engine was functioning properly. 2005 to 2007 models remain mostly unchanged from 2004.

The new <i>F</i> names were not as well known to be associated with Ford in the US, and consumers were confused by the name changes.<sup id="_ref-DETROIT_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DETROIT" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> Mulally believed that the Taurus had an immediately strong <a href="/wiki/Brand_equity" id="w">brand equity</a>, and that it would take years for consumers to have a similar recognition of the Five Hundred.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>Changes to the new Taurus from the existing Five Hundred include over 500 changes with the most obvious being a newly styled front end and the addition of the 263&#160;hp 3.5&#160;L <a href="/wiki/Ford_Cyclone_engine" id="w">Duratec 35</a> V6 which replaces the 203&#160;hp <a href="/wiki/Ford_Mondeo_V6_engine" id="w">Duratec 30</a> 3.0&#160;L V6. The Five Hundred/Freestyle&#39;s <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ford_transmissions" id="w">ZF-Batavia</a> <a href="/wiki/Continuously_variable_transmission" id="w">CVT</a>, which had maximum torque capacity of {{Auto ftlbf}}, is also replaced with a <a href="/wiki/GM-Ford_6-speed_automatic_transmission" id="w">Ford-GM joint venture six-speed automatic</a> capable of withstanding the Duratec 35s additional torque.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> The Taurus sedan twin, the <a href="/wiki/Mercury_Sable" id="w">Mercury Sable</a> nameplate, was revived from the <a href="/wiki/Mercury_Montego" id="w">Mercury Montego</a>.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-DETROIT_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DETROIT" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ford is currently developing a redesigned Taurus that is to go on sale in 2010.<sup id="_ref-autosavant_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-autosavant" title="">[7]</a></sup> This new Taurus is rumored to contain the same dimensions of this model, and that a SHO version will be offered.<sup id="_ref-autosavant_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-autosavant" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

Along with the facelifted Five Hundred, Ford also created a facelifted <a href="/wiki/Ford_Freestyle" id="w">Freestyle</a> model, also in an attempt to improve sagging sales. This model has been rebadged the Taurus X.<sup id="_ref-taurusx_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-taurusx" title="">[6]</a></sup> The Taurus X will also drop the CVT transmission and 3.0&#160;L V6 used in the Freestyle in favor of the 3.5&#160;L engine and six-speed <a href="/wiki/GM-Ford_6-speed_automatic_transmission" id="w">6F</a> automatic. Although this model is considered to be a part of the Taurus line up, it only shares the platform with the Taurus, and does not share any cosmetic parts with the Taurus sedan.</p>

<p>The Taurus won many awards in its production run, with the original Taurus winning many awards. For 1986, the Taurus was named Motor Trend&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Motor_Trend_Car_of_the_Year" id="w">Car of the Year</a>. The Motor Trend journalists noted that the Taurus performed much better than the other cars that were up for the award, going as far as saying that the Taurus &#34;Ran away from the competition&#34;.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> The 1986 Taurus also made it onto <a href="/wiki/Car_and_Driver" id="w">Car and Driver</a>&#39;s ten best list, and the Taurus would stay there every year of its first generation<sup id="_ref-Taub_t" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> Team Taurus also won many awards, and would later prove to be an inspirational business development model<sup id="_ref-Taub_u" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taub" title="">[8]</a></sup> In fact, current Ford CEO <a href="/wiki/Alan_Mulally" id="w">Alan Mulally</a> claims that Team Taurus was what inspired the development tactics of the <a href="/wiki/Boeing_787" id="w">Boeing 787</a>.<sup id="_ref-Alan_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Alan" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 1992 Taurus also made it onto Car and Driver&#39;s Ten Best list for that year, although that was the last year the Taurus would appear on that list. In its second generation, the Taurus was the best selling car in America every year it was produced.<sup id="_ref-bestselling_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bestselling" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Taurus generally performed well in crash tests, and getting mostly high ratings. The 1996, 2000, and 2008 Taurus earned five-star frontal crash test ratings by <a href="/wiki/NHTSA" id="w">NHTSA</a> and were Good in the <a href="/wiki/IIHS" id="w">IIHS</a> offset frontal crash test, and the 2008 was named a Top Safety Pick by IIHS.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> However, NHTSA testing suggests that no Taurus excelled in side-impact protection until the 2008 model.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
