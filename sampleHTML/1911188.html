The <b>Appalachian School of Law</b> (ASL) is a fully-accredited private <a href="/wiki/Law_school" id="w">law school</a> on a four building campus in <a href="/wiki/Grundy%2C_Virginia" id="w">Grundy, Virginia</a>, a small town near the convergence of <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" id="w">Kentucky</a>, and <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia" id="w">West Virginia</a>. The school offers a three-year <a href="/wiki/Juris_Doctor" id="w">Juris Doctor</a> degree, and enrolls approximately 370 full-time students.<sup id="_ref-Appalachian School of Law - Student Body_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Appalachian School of Law - Student Body" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The law school was founded in 1994 and it admitted its first class of students in August 1997.
ASL was started and brought to <a href="/wiki/Buchanan_County%2C_Virginia" id="w">Buchanan County, Virginia</a> as a tool of economic development for the region. The school is fully accredited by the <a href="/wiki/American_Bar_Association" id="w">American Bar Association</a>. ASL is notable for its focus to community service and leadership, emphasizing <a href="/wiki/Professional_responsibility" id="w">professional responsibility</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alternative_dispute_resolution" id="w">alternative dispute resolution</a> in its curriculum and requiring students to complete 25 hours of community service per semester in order to graduate. Each student is also required to complete an externship before graduation. ASL was also the site of a <a href="/wiki/Appalachian_School_of_Law_shooting" id="w">triple homicide</a> that took place on <a href="/wiki/January_16" id="w">January 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>. </p>

ASL traces its roots back to <a href="/wiki/1993" id="w">1993</a> when <a href="/wiki/Norton%2C_Virginia" id="w">Norton, Virginia</a> lawyer Joe Wolfe came up with the idea to create a law school in Central <a href="/wiki/Appalachia" id="w">Appalachia</a>.  His idea was well received by local business leaders and a steering committee was founded in <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a> and grew to eighty members. The committee surveyed lawyers and found that legal education needed to emphasize <a href="/wiki/Professional_responsibility" id="w">professional responsibility</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alternative_dispute_resolution" id="w">alternative dispute resolution</a> as these pillars of law school were becoming more important in today&#39;s law practice. The committee gained permission of the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly" id="w">Virginia General Assembly</a> to start a law school in <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a> and continued to secure endorsements from local civic associations and industrial development authorities.  <a href="/wiki/Buchanan_County%2C_Virginia" id="w">Buchanan County, Virginia</a> approached the committee in <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a> and offered the grounds and buildings of the former Grundy Elementary and Intermediate Schools to which the steering committee accepted.<sup id="_ref-ASL Course Catalog_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ASL Course Catalog" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The State Council of Higher Education in Virginia granted the school the ability to enroll students studying for the <a href="/wiki/Juris_Doctor" id="w">Juris Doctor</a> Degree in <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Buchanan_County%2C_Virginia" id="w">Buchanan County</a> brought ASL to <a href="/wiki/Grundy%2C_Virginia" id="w">Grundy</a> in order to revitalize a town that had been in a steady economic decline since the town&#39;s Flood of 1977. ASL has brought a positive economic impact on its home town, including spurring construction of rental homes and the opening of additional businesses in the area.

 campus of ASL currently consists of three buildings, the main academic building, the Student Organization House, and the law library. A fourth building, Booth Hall, is under construction.</p>
<p>The main academic building was created from the town&#39;s former high school (and junior high school) and gymnasium complex; these buildings were joined and extensively remodeled and expanded as part of a $1 million<sup id="_ref-VCEDA forgives loans for projects_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VCEDA forgives loans for projects" title="">[10]</a></sup> award-winning architectural project.<sup id="_ref-Project profile_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Project profile" title="">[11]</a></sup>  The main building contains an appellate courtroom (which doubles as the auditorium for large events), a trial courtroom, five seminar rooms, student mailroom, the Lion&#39;s Lounge, and faculty and staff offices. Most rooms are wired for internet access.<sup id="_ref-ASL Course Catalog - Facilities_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ASL Course Catalog - Facilities" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The two-story law library is adjacent to the main building. The building has 24,780 square feet and has facilities for seminar classes and group study rooms. The library contains over 196,000 volumes. Once the former Grundy Elementary School, this building has also been extensively remodeled and features individual and group study areas, a computer lab, and both wireless and wired internet access.
<sup id="_ref-ASL Library_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ASL Library" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

Additionally, all first-year students are required to complete a 200-hour unpaid externship over the summer before their second-year. This requirement is usually met by students working as judicial clerks, interns in prosecutor and defense offices, state and federal governmental agencies, and private practices.  Placements have included state supreme courts, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" id="w">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Justice" id="w">U.S. Department of Justice</a>.
