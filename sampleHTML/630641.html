<p>Lethem was born in <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn%2C_New_York" id="w">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> to <a class="externallink" href="http://www.richardlethem.com" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.richardlethem.com">Richard Brown Lethem</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Avant-garde" id="w">avant-garde</a> painter, and Judith Lethem, a political <a href="/wiki/Activist" id="w">activist</a>.  He was the eldest of three children; his brother, Blake, is an artist, and his sister, Mara, is a photographer and writer.<sup id="_ref-dodger_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dodger" title="">[1]</a></sup>  Jonathan was raised in a <a href="/wiki/Commune_(intentional_community)" id="w">commune</a> in the pre-<a href="/wiki/Gentrification" id="w">gentrified</a> Brooklyn neighborhood of <a href="/wiki/Boerum_Hill" id="w">Boerum Hill</a>.  Despite a pervasive feeling of racial tension, he later described his <a href="/wiki/Bohemianism" id="w">Bohemian</a> childhood as “thrilling” and culturally wide-reaching;<sup id="_ref-dodger_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dodger" title="">[1]</a></sup> he gained an encyclopedic knowledge of the music of <a href="/wiki/Bob_Dylan" id="w">Bob Dylan</a>, saw <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" id="w">Star Wars</a></i> twenty-one times during its original theatrical release,<sup id="_ref-guard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guard" title="">[2]</a></sup> and read the complete works of the <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a> writer <a href="/wiki/Philip_K._Dick" id="w">Philip K. Dick</a>.  Lethem later called Dick’s work “as formative an influence as marijuana or punk rock—as equally responsible for beautifully fucking up my life, for bending it irreversibly along a course I still travel.”<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>His parents divorced when Jonathan was young, and when he was thirteen, Judith died from a <a href="/wiki/Cancer" id="w">cancerous</a> <a href="/wiki/Brain_tumor" id="w">brain tumor</a>,<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> an experience he has said haunted him and heavily affected his writing.  In 2007, he explained that &#34;My books all have this giant, howling missing [center]—language has disappeared, or someone has vanished, or memory has gone.&#34;<sup id="_ref-dodger_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dodger" title="">[1]</a></sup>  Intending to become a visual artist like his father, Lethem attended <a href="/wiki/The_High_School_of_Music_%26amp%3B_Art" id="w">The High School of Music &#38; Art</a>, where he painted in a style he describes as &#34;glib, show-offy, usually cartoonish.&#34;<sup id="_ref-post_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-post" title="">[5]</a></sup>  At Music &#38; Art he produced his own zine, <i>The Literary Exchange,</i> that featured artwork and writing, created animated films, and wrote a 125-page unpublished novel, <i>Heroes</i>.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school, Lethem entered <a href="/wiki/Bennington_College" id="w">Bennington College</a> in <a href="/wiki/Vermont" id="w">Vermont</a> in 1982 as a prospective art student.  At Bennington, Lethem experienced an “overwhelming....collision with the realities of class—my parents’ bohemian milieu had kept me from understanding, even a little, that we were poor....at Bennington that was all demolished by an encounter with the fact of real privilege.” <sup id="_ref-post_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-post" title="">[5]</a></sup>  This, coupled with a growing realization that he was more interested in writing than art, led Lethem to drop out halfway through his sophomore year.  He <a href="/wiki/Hitchhiking" id="w">hitchhiked</a> from <a href="/wiki/Denver%2C_Colorado" id="w">Denver</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colorado" id="w">Colorado</a> to <a href="/wiki/Berkeley%2C_California" id="w">Berkeley</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a> in 1984, in what he called &#34;one of the stupidest and most memorable things I&#39;ve ever done.&#34;<sup id="_ref-scifistud_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scifistud" title="">[6]</a></sup>  He lived in California for twelve years, working as a clerk in used bookstores and writing in his own time. Lethem published his first short story in 1989, and published several more in the early 1990s.<sup id="_ref-sf_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sf" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="First_novels" name="First_novels"></a><h3>First novels</h3>
<p>Lethem’s first novel, <i><a href="/wiki/Gun%2C_with_Occasional_Music" id="w">Gun, with Occasional Music</a></i>, is a merging of science fiction and the <a href="/wiki/Raymond_Chandler" id="w">Chandleresque</a> detective story which includes talking <a href="/wiki/Kangaroo" id="w">kangaroos</a>, radical futuristic versions of the drug scene, and <a href="/wiki/Cryogenic" id="w">cryogenic</a> prisons.  The novel was published in 1994 by <a href="/wiki/Harcourt_Brace" id="w">Harcourt Brace</a>, in what Lethem later described as a &#34;delirious&#34; experience.  &#34;I&#39;d pictured my first novels being published as paperback originals,” he recalled, &#34;and instead a prestigious house was doing the book in cloth....I was in heaven.&#34;<sup id="_ref-post_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-post" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The novel was released to little initial fanfare, but an enthusiastic review in <i><a href="/wiki/Newsweek" id="w">Newsweek</a></i>, which declared <i>Gun</i> an &#34;audaciously assured first novel,&#34; catapulted the book to wider commercial success.<sup id="_ref-barry_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-barry" title="">[8]</a></sup>  <i>Gun, with Occasional Music</i> was a finalist for the 1994 <a href="/wiki/Nebula_Award" id="w">Nebula Award</a>, and placed first in the &#34;Best First Novel&#34; category of the 1995 <i><a href="/wiki/Locus_(magazine)" id="w">Locus Magazine</a></i> reader&#39;s poll.  In the mid-1990s, film producer <a href="/wiki/Alan_J._Pakula" id="w">Alan J. Pakula</a> optioned the novel&#39;s movie rights, which allowed Lethem to quit working in bookstores and devote his time to writing.<sup id="_ref-barry_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-barry" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>He followed <i>Gun, with Occasional Music</i> in 1995 with his second novel.  Partially inspired by Lethem&#39;s experiences hitchhiking cross-country,<sup id="_ref-scifistud_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scifistud" title="">[6]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Amnesia_Moon" id="w">Amnesia Moon</a></i> uses a <a href="/wiki/Road_trip" id="w">road</a> narrative to explore a multi-<a href="/wiki/Post-apocalyptic" id="w">post-apocalyptic</a> future landscape rife with perception tricks.  After publishing many of his early stories in a 1996 collection (<i><a href="/wiki/The_Wall_of_the_Sky%2C_the_Wall_of_the_Eye" id="w">The Wall of the Sky, the Wall of the Eye</a></i>), Lethem&#39;s third novel, <i><a href="/wiki/As_She_Climbed_Across_the_Table" id="w">As She Climbed Across the Table</a></i>, was published in 1997.  The novel takes as its starting point a physics researcher who falls in love with an artificially generated spatial anomaly called &#34;Lack&#34;, for whom she spurns her previous partner.  Her ex-partner&#39;s comic struggle with this rejection, and with the anomaly constitute the majority of the narrative.</p>
<p>In 1996, Lethem moved from the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area" id="w">San Francisco Bay Area</a> back to Brooklyn.<sup id="_ref-scifistud_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scifistud" title="">[6]</a></sup> His next book, published after his return to Brooklyn, was <i><a href="/wiki/Girl_in_Landscape" id="w">Girl in Landscape</a></i>.  In the novel, a young girl must endure <a href="/wiki/Puberty" id="w">puberty</a> while also having to face a strange and new world populated by aliens known as Archbuilders.  <i>Girl in Landscape<b>s plot and characters, including the figures of a young girl and a violently protective father figure, were &#34;very strongly influenced&#34; by the 1956 <a href="/wiki/John_Wayne" id="w">John Wayne</a> <a href="/wiki/Western_(genre)" id="w">Western</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Searchers_(film)" id="w">The Searchers</a></i>, a movie with which Lethem is &#34;obsessed.&#34;<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<a id="Mainstream_success_and_%22genre_bending%22" name="Mainstream_success_and_%22genre_bending%22"></a><h3>Mainstream success and &#34;genre bending&#34;</h3>
<p>The first novel Lethem began after returning to New York City was <i><a href="/wiki/Motherless_Brooklyn" id="w">Motherless Brooklyn</a></i>, a return to the detective theme, this time maintaining objective realism while exploring subjective <a href="/wiki/Alterity" id="w">alterity</a> through Lionel Essrog, a protagonist with <a href="/wiki/Tourette_syndrome" id="w">Tourette syndrome</a> who is obsessed with language.  Lethem later called Essrog &#34;obviously the character I’ve written with whom I most identify,&#34; and explained that the novel &#34;stands outside myself....It’s the only one which doesn’t need me, never did.  It would have found someone to write it, by necessity.&#34;<sup id="_ref-post_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-post" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Upon its publication in 1999, <i>Motherless Brooklyn</i> won the <a href="/wiki/National_Book_Critics_Circle_Award#Fiction" id="w">National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction</a>, The <a href="/wiki/Gold_Dagger" id="w">Macallan Gold Dagger</a> for crime fiction, and the <i><a href="/wiki/Salon.com" id="w">Salon</a></i> Book Award, and was named book of the year by <i><a href="/wiki/Esquire" id="w">Esquire</a></i>. In 1999, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Norton" id="w">Edward Norton</a> announced that he was planning to write, direct and star in a film adaptation of the novel;<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> as of December 2007, Norton was still working on the project.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The mainstream success of <i>Motherless Brooklyn</i> made Lethem, according to <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">The New York Times</a></i>, &#34;something of a hipster celebrity,&#34; and he was referred to several times as a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Genre_fiction" id="w">genre</a> bender.&#34;<sup id="_ref-nyti_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nyti" title="">[12]</a></sup>  Critics cited Lethem&#39;s various novels, which were alternately hardboiled detective fiction, science fiction, and autobiographical.  (Lethem credited his comfort in genre-mixing to his father&#39;s art, which &#34;always combined observed and imagined reality on the same canvas, very naturally, very un-self-consciously.&#34;)<sup id="_ref-nyti_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nyti" title="">[12]</a></sup>  In <i><a href="/wiki/Time_(magazine)" id="w">Time</a></i> magazine, <a href="/wiki/Lev_Grossman" id="w">Lev Grossman</a> classed Lethem with a movement of authors similarly eager to blend literary and popular writing, including <a href="/wiki/Michael_Chabon" id="w">Michael Chabon</a> (with whom Lethem is friends),<sup id="_ref-eleanor_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eleanor" title="">[13]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Atwood" id="w">Margaret Atwood</a>,  and <a href="/wiki/Susanna_Clarke" id="w">Susanna Clarke</a>.<sup id="_ref-pop_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pop" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2003, Lethem definitively described his opinion of his supposed &#34;genre bending&#34;:
{{cquote}}</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, Lethem published a story collection, edited two anthologies, wrote magazine pieces, and published the 55-page novella <i><a href="/wiki/This_Shape_We%26%2339%3Bre_In" id="w">This Shape We&#39;re In</a></i> in 2000.  <i>This Shape We&#39;re In</i> was one of the first offerings from <a href="/wiki/McSweeney%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">McSweeney&#39;s</a> Books, the publishing <a href="/wiki/Imprint" id="w">imprint</a> that arose from <a href="/wiki/Dave_Eggers" id="w">Dave Eggers</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Timothy_McSweeney%26%2339%3Bs_Quarterly_Concern" id="w">&#39;&#39;McSweeney&#39;s Quarterly Concern&#39;&#39;</a>.</p>
<p>In November 2000, Lethem said that he was working on an uncharacteristically &#34;big sprawling&#34; novel, about a child who grows up to be a rock journalist.<sup id="_ref-sf_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sf" title="">[7]</a></sup>  The novel was published in 2003, as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Fortress_of_Solitude_(novel)" id="w">The Fortress of Solitude</a></i>.  The semi-autobiographical <a href="/wiki/Bildungsroman" id="w">bildungsroman</a> features dozens of characters in a variety of milieus, but centers on a tale of racial tensions and boyhood in <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn" id="w">Brooklyn</a> during the late 1970s.  The main characters are two friends of different backgrounds who grew up on the same block in <a href="/wiki/Boerum_Hill" id="w">Boerum Hill</a>. It was named one of nine &#34;Editor&#39;s Choice&#34; books of the year by <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" id="w">The New York Times</a> </i> and has been published in fifteen languages. </p>
<p>His second collection of short fiction, <i><a href="/wiki/Men_and_Cartoons" id="w">Men and Cartoons</a></i>, was published in late 2004. In March 2005, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Disappointment_Artist" id="w">The Disappointment Artist</a></i>, his first collection of essays, was released.  On <a href="/wiki/September_20" id="w">September 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, Lethem was named one of the 2005 recipients of the <a href="/wiki/Macarthur_Grant#MacArthur Fellowship" id="w">MacArthur Fellowship</a>, often referred to as the &#34;genius grant.&#34;</p>
<a id="Recent_work" name="Recent_work"></a><h3>Recent work</h3>
<p>In September 2006, Lethem published <a class="externallink" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11216877/the_modern_times_of_bob_dylan_a_legend_comes_to_grips_with_his_iconic_status/print" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11216877/the_modern_times_of_bob_dylan_a_legend_comes_to_grips_with_his_iconic_status/print">&#34;The Genius of Bob Dylan&#34;</a>, a lengthy interview with Bob Dylan in <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" id="w">Rolling Stone</a></i> magazine; the interview contained Lethem&#39;s reflections on Dylan&#39;s artistic achievements, as well as revealing Dylan&#39;s dissatisfaction with contemporary recording techniques and his thoughts on his own status.</p>
<p>After <i>Motherless Brooklyn</i> and <i>The Fortress of Solitude</i>, Lethem decided that &#34;[i]t was time to leave Brooklyn in a literary sense anyway….I really needed to defy all that stuff about place and memory.&#34;<sup id="_ref-dodger_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dodger" title="">[1]</a></sup>  In 2007, he returned to the setting of <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>, where some of his earlier fiction took place, with <i><a href="/wiki/You_Don%26%2339%3Bt_Love_Me_Yet" id="w">You Don&#39;t Love Me Yet</a></i>, a novel about an upstart rock band. The novel revolves around a woman in the band, Lucinda, who answers phones for her friend&#39;s complaint line and uses some of a caller&#39;s words as lyrics.  According to Lethem, <i>You Don&#39;t Love Me Yet</i> was inspired by the years he spent as the lead singer in an upstart California band  in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during what he called &#34;the unformed posturing phase of life.&#34;<sup id="_ref-hit song_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hit song" title="">[15]</a></sup>  The novel received mixed reviews.<sup id="_ref-guard_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guard" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2005, Lethem had announced that he was planning to revive the <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Comics" id="w">Marvel Comics</a> character <a href="/wiki/Omega_the_Unknown" id="w">Omega the Unknown</a> in a ten-issue series to be published in 2006.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  After hearing of the project, Omega co-creator <a href="/wiki/Steve_Gerber" id="w">Steve Gerber</a> expressed personal outrage over the use of the character without his participation, though he later discussed the project with Lethem and admitted that he had &#34;misjudged&#34; him.<sup id="_ref-omeg_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-omeg" title="">[17]</a></sup>  In May 2006, Marvel Editor-in-Chief <a href="/wiki/Joe_Quesada" id="w">Joe Quesada</a> explained that the series had been delayed to 2007, saying that &#34;winning the Macarthur Grant put additional and unexpected demands on [Lethem&#39;s] time.&#34;<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup>  In July 2007, Lethem reported that he had written eight of ten planned issues;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> the first issue was published in October 2007.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>In early 2007, Lethem began work on a new, Philip K. Dick-influenced novel.  In an April 2007 interview, he stated, &#34;I&#39;m very excited about [it]....it&#39;s kind of gonna be a big, dark, paranoiac novel about <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" id="w">Manhattan</a>.  So not quite a return to Brooklyn, but one river away.&#34;<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
