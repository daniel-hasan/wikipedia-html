<p>The first rumors of another <i>Elder Scrolls</i> release after <i><a href="/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_III:_Morrowind" id="w">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a></i> began to circulate in June 2004, following Bethesda&#39;s posting of an e-mail searching for new staff. The new staff members were to participate on a team that would push &#34;the bleeding-edge of RPG development for the PC and <a href="/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(seventh_generation)" id="w">future-generation consoles</a>&#34;. For those considering the job, the e-mail suggested that &#34;knowledge of&#160;...&#160;The Elder Scrolls [is] a plus&#34;. At the time, a member of Bethesda&#39;s staff played down the importance of the last comment, noting that Bethesda would &#34;obviously&#34; prefer applicants familiar with the company&#39;s products.<sup id="_ref-RUMORS_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RUMORS" title="">[2]</a></sup> Rumors were confirmed on <a href="/wiki/July_12" id="w">July 12</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, when it was announced that <i><a href="/wiki/Fallout_3" id="w">Fallout 3</a></i> and the next <i>Elder Scrolls</i> title would be published by Bethesda and produced by Todd Howard.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> The title of the release was listed on <a href="/wiki/September_10" id="w">September 10</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, when Bethesda officially announced the identity of the game in question: <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i>, followed by a feature in the October 2004 issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Game_Informer" id="w">Game Informer</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-ANNOUNCED_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ANNOUNCED" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-EIVPCNG_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EIVPCNG" title="">[1]</a></sup> At the time of the announcement, Bethesda had been working on <i>Oblivion</i> for two years (since 2002<sup id="_ref-EIVPCNG_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EIVPCNG" title="">[1]</a></sup>), just as Bethesda was completing work on <i>Morrowind</i>.<sup id="_ref-E3IMP_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-E3IMP" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-GBAN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GBAN" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

The delay surprised many, especially online retailers, who had begun accepting pre-orders for consoles bundled with <i>Oblivion</i>.<sup id="_ref-RDD_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RDD" title="">[8]</a></sup> News of the delay came at a time following a burst of bad news from the company, including a 60% drop in expected earnings per share, the ongoing <a href="/wiki/Hot_Coffee_minigame_controversy" id="w">Hot Coffee minigame controversy</a>, worse than average sales for the company&#39;s flagship <i><a href="/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas" id="w">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></i>, sudden drops in share prices, and delays for other company products.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Most commentators blamed Take-Two&#39;s corporate governance; one analyst stated that the company&#39;s troubles were more &#34;company-specific than market-driven&#34;,<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> and another declared company CEO <a href="/wiki/Paul_Eibeler" id="w">Paul Eibeler</a> to be the &#34;worst CEO of 2005&#34;, pointing to &#34;setbacks on the rollouts of newer games&#34; as evidence of his failure.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda, and <a href="/wiki/Todd_Howard" id="w">Todd Howard</a>, Executive Producer for the game, gave an update about the delay on the weekend of <a href="/wiki/November_6" id="w">November 6</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>.

On <a href="/wiki/May_16" id="w">May 16</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, Bethesda announced that they would be releasing <i>Oblivion</i> on <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" id="w">Microsoft</a>&#39;s Xbox 360, and that the game&#39;s public debut would come at the <a href="/wiki/E3" id="w">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" id="w">Los Angeles</a> on <a href="/wiki/May_18" id="w">May 18</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>.<sup id="_ref-Announce_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Announce" title="">[35]</a></sup> The version shown at E3 was substantially finished; most content was already in the game, lacking only the polish that the final months of development would bring. The game&#39;s world, for example, had already been fully constructed but still needed to undergo a &#34;clutter pass&#34;, wherein minor game items&#8212;&#34;books, weapons, and thousands of forks and plates&#34;&#8212;are dropped into the game world.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Howard himself never took to the show. &#34;It&#39;s like a beauty pageant,&#34; he told one reporter. &#34;I have 20 minutes to give you a presentation on our games that by their nature are hard to demo in that time period, and then the person is going to check their watch and walk out and go see someone else&#39;s demo.&#34;<sup id="_ref-5MIN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5MIN" title="">[41]</a></sup> Hines aimed to play against the standard convention at the show, avoiding the &#34;noise and lights and heat and masses&#34; of the show floor by retiring to a mini-theater&#8212;with air-conditioning, comfortable seating, and dim lighting&#8212;where viewers could rest in peace.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Howard agreed with the choice: &#34;We&#39;ve always taken sort of the meeting room approach. We don&#39;t have loud crazy booths.&#34;<sup id="_ref-5MIN_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5MIN" title="">[41]</a></sup> </p>
<p>During Microsoft&#39;s E3 pre-show conference, a ten-second preview of <i>Oblivion</i> was shown amid demo reels for other games. The preview consisted of a series of brief second-long shots of the game.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> Later on, during E3 proper, Bethesda showed a longer 25-minute demo that showcased further clipped scenes: the opening dungeon, a procedurally rendered forest, one of the game&#39;s towns, and other locales.<sup id="_ref-E3IMP_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-E3IMP" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> Most viewers were impressed by <i>Oblivion</i>&#39;s showing. In the words of one reporter, &#34;<i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i> isn&#39;t just one of the brightest gems in the Xbox 360&#39;s upcoming launch lineup, but it&#39;s also perhaps a perfect example of a next-generation role-playing game.&#34;<sup id="_ref-GSPTQAAE3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GSPTQAAE3" title="">[45]</a></sup> <i>Oblivion</i> won a number of &#34;best of&#34; awards from a variety of game journalists: <a href="/wiki/GameSpy" id="w">GameSpy</a>&#39;s &#34;RPG Game of Show&#34;<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/GameSpot" id="w">GameSpot</a>&#39;s &#34;Best RPG&#34;,<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/IGN" id="w">IGN</a>&#39;s &#34;Best PC RPG&#34;,<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> RPGFan&#39;s &#34;Best Overall Game of E3 2005&#34;,<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> and, most prestigiously, the &#34;Best Role Playing Game&#34; in the 2005 E3 Game Critics Awards.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A near-final build of <i>Oblivion</i> would later be shown at Microsoft&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show" id="w">Consumer Electronics Show</a> press tent&#8212;but not at its public Xbox 360 booth<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup>&#8212;in January 2006, showcasing the game&#39;s exteriors. A Joystiq reporter at the scene was not entirely impressed, finding the demo marred by long load times and slowdowns during combat. An Xbox representative reassured the reporter that all such issues would be worked out before the game&#39;s retail release.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> In the months prior to release, anticipation for the game ran high, with critics describing <i>Oblivion</i> as &#34;the first next-gen game&#34; only heightening attention. &#34;People were expecting the game to cure blindness and heal the sick,&#34; said Hines.<sup id="_ref-SCRUP_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SCRUP" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>

The two titles were set to be published by Bethesda alone in North America, and with <a href="/wiki/Ubisoft" id="w">Ubisoft</a> as a co-publisher in Europe.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> Hines was mum regarding the change in publishers: &#34;Too much backroom stuff.&#34;<sup id="_ref-SCRUP_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SCRUP" title="">[53]</a></sup> Ubisoft saw their first quarter sales for 2007 rise 90.5%, to 134 million <a href="/wiki/Euro" id="w">Euros</a>, exceeding previous forecasts by 14 million Euros. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot attributed the rise to &#34;new-generation consoles and the impact of PlayStation 3 game sales, including <i><a href="/wiki/Tom_Clancy%26%2339%3Bs_Rainbow_Six:_Vegas" id="w">Rainbow Six Vegas</a></i> and <i>Oblivion</i>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the title being included in Sony&#39;s announced PlayStation 3 launch lineup at its annual Gamers&#39; Day event in San Francisco, online retailers <a href="/wiki/Electronics_Boutique" id="w">EBgames.com</a> and <a href="/wiki/GameStop" id="w">Gamestop.com</a>&#8212;two sites with a history of revealing the release dates of games before their publisher&#39;s announcements&#8212;were found on <a href="/wiki/November_8" id="w">November 8</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> to have set <i>Oblivion</i>&#39;s release date as <a href="/wiki/January_1" id="w">January 1</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.<sup id="_ref-RRDR_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RRDR" title="">[22]</a></sup> Some few hours later, the delay was confirmed, as Pete Hines issued the statement that &#34;Oblivion PS3 is now a Q1 2007 title&#34;.

<a id="Publisher_relations" name="Publisher_relations"></a><h2>Publisher relations</h2>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_3" id="w">February 3</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, Bethesda entered into an agreement with <a href="/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive" id="w">Take-Two Interactive</a> regarding the publication and release of <i>Oblivion</i>. Under the agreement, Bethesda would retain full control over <i>Oblivion</i>&#39;s development and the rights to any possible sequels, and Take-Two would agree to publish the game under its recently-formed <a href="/wiki/2K_Games" id="w">2K Games</a> sub brand.<sup id="_ref-COPUB_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-COPUB" title="">[4]</a></sup> According to Producer Gavin Carter, the team&#39;s experience was a rarity in the industry; few independent developer-publisher relationships still exist, and it was a surprise that Bethesda&#39;s experience worked out as well as it did. Carter described Take-Two&#39;s role as one of minimal interference, and the company mostly left Bethesda&#39;s development teams alone, trusting them to produce a &#34;fantastic product&#34; with minimal interference or &#34;red tape&#34;. The relationship was a rarity in the industry, according to Carter, where most developers are beholden to their publishers.<sup id="_ref-GPRDCR_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GPRDCR" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Ashley Cheng, <i>Oblivion</i>&#39;s senior producer, concurred. There was &#34;complete freedom&#34; at Bethesda to decide their own path, whatever market trends might say.<sup id="_ref-ASHCHN_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ASHCHN" title="">[6]</a></sup> Of the legal proceedings affecting Bethesda&#39;s parent company ZeniMax during the initial stages of game development, when Bethesda founder Christopher Weaver sued the company for severance pay,<sup id="_ref-DIR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DIR" title="">[73]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> Todd Howard said that he, as a producer, wasn&#39;t involved with corporate affairs. &#34;I just focus on the games.&#34;<sup id="_ref-DIR_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DIR" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">right</div>
The team&#39;s goal then was, in the words of Todd Howard, to &#34;create the quintessential RPG of the next generation&#34;, with a focus on a &#34;combination of freeform gameplay and cutting-edge graphics.&#34;<sup id="_ref-GSPTQA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GSPTQA" title="">[75]</a></sup> It was a wise decision to make at the time. Producing for next generation machines, rather than a cheap upgrade, gave Bethesda an additional four years of development: four years that &#34;all but guaranteed&#34; a punctual launch alongside the Xbox 360, four years that offered room for Bethesda to start from scratch.<sup id="_ref-DIR_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DIR" title="">[73]</a></sup> Howard describes this as an aspect of Bethesda&#39;s greater goal of &#34;Reinvention&#34;, where the team&#39;s goal is to make &#34;a new game that stands on its own, that has its own identity&#34;.<sup id="_ref-RPGNG_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RPGNG" title="">[9]</a></sup> Howard spoke of the need to avoid repetition, to avoid merely adding &#34;some new features and content, and keep doing that&#34;, describing that path as &#34;a good way to drive your games into the ground.&#34; Bethesda, Howard stated, would focus instead on recapturing what made its past titles exciting &#34;in the first place&#34;.<sup id="_ref-DIR_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DIR" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>Keeping with the spirit of past games, Howard promised to keep with the spirit of &#34;big-world, do-anything&#34;-style games, feeling that a certain size and number of choices were needed to make role-playing feel &#34;meaningful&#34;;<sup id="_ref-GSPTQA_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GSPTQA" title="">[75]</a></sup> but now there was to be greater emphasis on keeping the game focused.<sup id="_ref-RPGNG_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RPGNG" title="">[9]</a></sup> Pete Hines saw the developments between games as less an issue of design focus and more as a &#34;natural side effect of improving and refining how the game works&#34;. If smart decisions were made, ease of play would naturally follow.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> <i>Oblivion</i> would include fewer NPCs and quests than <i>Morrowind</i>, and mindless filler, which Howard felt the team had been guilty of in the past, would be avoided.<sup id="_ref-RPGNG_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RPGNG" title="">[9]</a></sup> In exchange, Producer Gavin Carter later explained, there would be greater focus on length and depth in the quests, adding more &#34;alternate paths&#34;, more &#34;chararcters [sic] to connect with, who actually have personalities&#34;. Carter cast negative aspersions on aspects of gameplay too far removed from the game&#39;s central plot. Carter stated that such material was not needed, preferring instead that the focus be on the plot, on &#34;fighting these demon lords&#34;, and that further material is &#34;tertiary&#34; and &#34;takes away&#34;.<sup id="_ref-GCRT_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GCRT" title="">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The role of the player character in the main quest was to be changed as well. In contrast to past games, where the player character would play a type of &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_One#See also" id="w">chosen one</a>&#34;, <i>Oblivion</i> would have the player character &#34;find him, protect him, and help him.&#34;<sup id="_ref-GCLOUD_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GCLOUD" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-MYGAME_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MYGAME" title="">[77]</a></sup> Aside from that, in the opinion of Hines, &#34;the main quest has similar themes and tones as in past Elder Scrolls games&#34;, and should still feel &#34;epic&#34;, simply because of the way the gamespace is designed: with openness in mind.<sup id="_ref-MYGAME_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MYGAME" title="">[77]</a></sup> Improving that aspect of the experience, said Hines, came mostly in the form of improved information presentation. The system would not intrude on the experience when the player merely wishes to &#34;walk around and explore the world and do whatever he/she wants&#34;, but given the scenario where the player asks &#34;&#39;OK, I&#39;m ready to do the next part of the main quest, where do I go?&#39;&#34;, the game would provide a ready answer, so as to avoid &#34;confusion&#34; and &#34;downtime&#34;.<sup id="_ref-GCLOUD_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GCLOUD" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Technology" name="Technology"></a><h2>Technology</h2>
<p>The Xbox 360 was set as <i>Oblivion</i>&#39;s base platform, being the &#34;easiest to develop for&#34;, in the words of Pete Hines; the PC, being more like a &#34;random amalgamation of graphics cards and RAM and processors&#34;, and poorly &#34;defined&#34;.<sup id="_ref-SCRUP_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SCRUP" title="">[53]</a></sup> As they had done with previous games in the series, Bethesda threw out their old content and technology and began work anew. A new engine was envisioned, one which would take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines, like <a href="/wiki/High_dynamic_range_rendering" id="w">high dynamic range rendering</a> and <a href="/wiki/Specularity" id="w">specular mapping</a>.<sup id="_ref-E3IMP_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-E3IMP" title="">[33]</a></sup> The final product was shipped with an engine formed of a mixture of in-house tech and Numerical Design Limited&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Gamebryo" id="w">Gamebryo</a> engine,<sup id="_ref-ELB_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ELB" title="">[16]</a></sup> &#34;tricked out&#34; in collaboration with Bethesda&#39;s graphics programmers and NDL.<sup id="_ref-TVG_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TVG" title="">[17]</a></sup> Cheng has described the game as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pixel_shader" id="w">pixel-shader</a> heavy&#34;, taking advantage of the feature in rendering &#34;metal, wood, stone, blood, skin,&#34; in addition to water, which was the only use <i>Morrowind</i> made of the technology. In particular, <i>Oblivion</i> uses <a href="/wiki/Normal_mapping" id="w">normal maps</a>, diffuse maps, specular maps, and <a href="/wiki/Parallax_mapping" id="w">parallax maps</a>,<sup id="_ref-MONTHLY_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MONTHLY" title="">[14]</a></sup> which Howard described as &#34;kind of like <a href="/wiki/Displacement_mapping" id="w">displacement mapping</a>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> <i>Oblivion</i> makes use of Radiant AI, a new artificial intelligence system that allows non-player characters to dynamically react and interact with the world around them.<sup id="_ref-GCHRON_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GCHRON" title="">[12]</a></sup> General goals, such as &#34;Eat at this city at 2pm&#34; are given to NPCs, and NPCs are left to determine how to achieve them.<sup id="_ref-GNEXT_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GNEXT" title="">[13]</a></sup> The absence of individual scripting for each character allowed for the construction of a world on a much larger scale than other games had developed, and aided in the creation of what Todd Howard described as an &#34;organic feel&#34; for the game.<sup id="_ref-GCHRON_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GCHRON" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Features introduced for the new release that had been absent in <i>Morrowind</i> included &#34;full facial animations, lip synching, and full speech for all dialogue&#34;.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> <i>Oblivion</i> uses <a href="/wiki/Havok_(software)" id="w">Havok</a> as its physics engine, following in the footsteps of <i><a href="/wiki/Half-Life_2" id="w">Half-Life 2</a></i>. Havok is involved in modeling the game&#39;s representations of <a href="/wiki/Telekinesis" id="w">telekinesis</a>, theft, traps, tumbling,<sup id="_ref-LIVING_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LIVING" title="">[15]</a></sup> paralysis, <a href="/wiki/Area_effect" id="w">area effect</a> fireball explosions,<sup id="_ref-MONTHLY_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MONTHLY" title="">[14]</a></sup> and the contact between arrows and their targets.

<p>The inclusion of procedural content tools allowed for the creation of realistic environments at much faster rates than was the case with <i>Morrowind</i>.<sup id="_ref-RPGCRT_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RPGCRT" title="">[18]</a></sup> Using <a href="/wiki/Interactive_Data_Visualization%2C_Inc." id="w">IDV</a>’s <a href="/wiki/SpeedTree" id="w">SpeedTree</a> technology, for example, Bethesda artists were able to &#34;quickly generate complex and organic tree shapes with relative ease&#34;.

<p>The PS3 release featured a number of technical improvements over the Xbox 360 release; load times were reduced, fewer framerate drops were experienced and several bugs were fixed. Draw distance was increased, and new shaders were included to render the foreground cleanly and sharply, leading to rocky landscapes with &#34;craggy appearances&#34; rather than &#34;smooth, non-distinct surfaces&#34;.<sup id="_ref-HANDSONHANDSOFF_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HANDSONHANDSOFF" title="">[25]</a></sup> The new shader sets blended &#34;near detail&#34; and &#34;far detail&#34; onscreen, removing the harsh line that cut between them in previous releases.<sup id="_ref-PS3INT_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PS3INT" title="">[26]</a></sup> Bethesda decided against implementing <a href="/wiki/SIXAXIS" id="w">SIXAXIS</a> motion support for the game, considering <i>Oblivion</i> not to be of a type well-suited to such a feature.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> The <i>Knights of the Nine</i> content pack was included with the game, but other downloadable content releases were not.<sup id="_ref-HANDSONHANDSOFF_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HANDSONHANDSOFF" title="">[25]</a></sup> The latter release spawned a host of rumors across the Internet:<sup id="_ref-RUMORS_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RUMORS" title="">[2]</a></sup> a 1UP piece stated that the content was removed due to its negative effect on console performance,<sup id="_ref-DOWNGRADE_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DOWNGRADE" title="">[81]</a></sup> and other websites repeated the claim.<sup id="_ref-RUMORS_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RUMORS" title="">[2]</a></sup> Limitations of the PS3&#39;s system memory were suspect, as the potential cause of the performance drop.<sup id="_ref-DOWNGRADE_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DOWNGRADE" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>
<p>In an article for IGN, Pete Hines challenged the statements, providing an alternate rationale for the content packages&#39; absence. Firstly, he stated, the expansions were removed to avoid giving a PS3 player an early advantage over other consoles&#39; players. Secondly, he stated, the game designers were unfamiliar with the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_Network#PlayStation Store" id="w">PlayStation Network Store</a> and Sony&#39;s online content distribution systems, and had not yet determined the best method of releasing the packages. The suggestion that the PS3&#39;s technical makeup determined the move could not be &#34;farther from the truth&#34;. Hines confirmed that the shader improvements for the PS3 would eventually migrate to the PC and Xbox 360 through further patches, but noted that some optimizations would remain exclusive to the PS3.<sup id="_ref-RUMORS_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RUMORS" title="">[2]</a></sup> In the end, the Xbox 360 and the PS3 would be &#34;very much on a par&#34; in their graphical performance.<sup id="_ref-SCRUP_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SCRUP" title="">[53]</a></sup>

A November 2005-release of a &#34;Winter Warrior Pack&#34; for <i><a href="/wiki/Kameo:_Elements_of_Power" id="w">Kameo: Elements of Power</a></i> was also priced at 200 Marketplace points,<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup> and similar content additions had been scheduled for <i><a href="/wiki/Project_Gotham_Racing_3" id="w">Project Gotham Racing 3</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Perfect_Dark_Zero" id="w">Perfect Dark Zero</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup> Indeed, Marketplace content additions formed a significant part of a March 2006 Microsoft announcement regarding the future of <a href="/wiki/Xbox_Live" id="w">Xbox Live</a>. &#34;Downloadable in-game content is a main focus of Microsoft&#39;s strategy heading into the next-gen console war,&#34; stated one <a href="/wiki/GameSpot" id="w">GameSpot</a> reporter.<sup id="_ref-HRSRMR_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HRSRMR" title="">[27]</a></sup> &#34;With more consoles on their way to retail, 80 games available by June, and new content and experiences coming to Xbox Live all the time, there has never been a better time to own an Xbox 360,&#34; announced <a href="/wiki/Peter_Moore_(business)" id="w">Peter Moore</a>.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup> Nonetheless, although <a href="/wiki/Xbox_Live_Arcade" id="w">Xbox Live Arcade</a> games, picture packs, <a href="/wiki/Xbox_360#Dashboard" id="w">dashboards</a> and profile themes continued to be a Marketplace success for Microsoft, the aforementioned in-game content remained sparse.<sup id="_ref-HRSRMR_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HRSRMR" title="">[27]</a></sup> Pete Hines asserted, 
&#34;We were the first ones to do downloadable content like that—some people had done similar things, but no one had really done additions where you add new stuff to your existing game.&#34; There was no pressure from Microsoft to make the move.<sup id="_ref-SCRUP_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SCRUP" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Consumer_backlash" name="Consumer_backlash"></a><h2>Consumer backlash</h2>
<p>Although gamers generally displayed some enthusiasm for the concept of <a href="/wiki/Micropayment" id="w">micropayments</a> for downloadable in-game content,<sup id="_ref-BRTOI_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRTOI" title="">[28]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-HRSRMR_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HRSRMR" title="">[27]</a></sup> <i>Oblivion</i>&#39;s horse armor release caused significant discord on <a href="/wiki/Internet_forum" id="w">Internet forums</a>, with gamers divided by the item&#39;s value versus its cost. &#34;This is not a matter of it being expensive in the grand scheme of things. This is not a matter of it being a requirement to buy. It&#39;s a matter of basically spitting in the consumer&#39;s collective face,&#34; wrote one poster. &#34;Something like horse armor is a trivial addition to the game&#160;...&#160;Bethesda should be ashamed of it.&#34; Others were more conciliatory. &#34;I agree that small stuff like that SHOULD be free, but in this day and age it&#39;s unlikely that we&#39;ll get a lot of &#39;free&#39; content. If you are into the game as much as I am, you&#39;re going to shell out the $ for downloads. Microsoft knows this&#160;...&#160;so the best we can hope for is that it will be free (unlikely) or inexpensive (as is the case here),&#34; wrote another.<sup id="_ref-HRSRMR_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HRSRMR" title="">[27]</a></sup> A <a href="/wiki/Joystiq" id="w">Joystiq</a> editorial gave further complaints. &#34;C&#39;mon, if this download came with a side quest, then sure, we&#39;d throw down some points. But, despite our ever-growing addiction to <i>Oblivion</i>, we&#39;re not itching to hand over additional cash for an item that was supposed to be included in the game&#39;s initial release.&#34;<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup> <i>Kameo</i>&#39;s release hadn&#39;t provoked such a backlash; but then, there had not been such &#34;feverish enthusiasm&#34; for <i>Kameo</i> as there was for <i>Oblivion</i>.<sup id="_ref-BRTOI_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRTOI" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>On April 4, the day after the first content release, Bethesda representatives, and Pete Hines in particular, made a variety of similar responses to various inquiries regarding the mod; broadly similar responses were issued to GameSpot News, to Evil Avatar, and to 1UP. Regarding the cost of the add-on, Hines stated that Bethesda aimed for a price point that &#34;fit&#34;. &#34;A Theme costs 150 points. The <i>Kameo</i> thing was 200. We&#39;re trying to find the right spot that fits&#160;...&#160;&#34;<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup> Hines assured the press  that Bethesda wasn&#39;t going to respond rashly to customer criticism. &#34;We&#39;re not going to make any knee-jerk decisions based on it [the armor] being available for five hours. We&#39;ll see what folks think and put out a few others we have planned and figure out where to go from there.&#34; Responding to concerns as to why <i>Oblivion</i>&#39;s downloadable content would cost money, while <i>Morrowind</i>&#39;s had been free, Hines stated: &#34;Different game, different approach to downloadable content and the size and scope of things we want to do, and what it takes to do them.&#34;<sup id="_ref-BRTOI_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRTOI" title="">[28]</a></sup> Hines was skeptical that consumers would have been happy with the product at any price: &#34;We could have put that out for 25 cents and people would have still been up in arms.&#34;<sup id="_ref-BRTOI_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRTOI" title="">[28]</a></sup> A Bethesda representative told GameSpot that future plans were still somewhat uncertain. &#34;It&#39;s hard to tell right now until we have more stuff out, how many people want item plug-ins, versus quests or locations, and so forth. It certainly may be the case that some plug-ins will appeal to some folks and not others, but we hope we&#39;ll be able to provide a good variety so that there&#39;s something for everyone&#160;...&#160;and hopefully more than one something for everyone.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MOCC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOCC" title="">[93]</a></sup></p>

<p>April 4 also saw the announcement of two new downloadable content packs for the coming weeks: an &#34;Orrery&#34; quest that would see gamers setting out to repair a Dwarven Orrery; and a &#34;Wizard&#39;s Tower&#34; that would offer a new home for player characters, complete with the capacity to grow herbs, summon atronachs, and make spells.<sup id="_ref-MOCC_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MOCC" title="">[93]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup> 1UP predicted that, given Bethesda&#39;s response to customer criticism, those releases would be somewhat more substantial than the &#34;Horse Armor&#34; release was.<sup id="_ref-BRTOI_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BRTOI" title="">[28]</a></sup> On April 7, Bethesda priced the &#34;Orrery&#34;. Offering what GameSpot called &#34;more bang for less buck&#34;, Bethesda set the PC release price at <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$1</a>.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$1</a>.88.<sup id="_ref-NOBAOP_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NOBAOP" title="">[29]</a></sup> Joystiq offered their support—&#34;&#39;Big ups&#39;&#34;—to the company for the new price. &#34;Although we passed on the $2.50 horse armor this week, we&#39;ll definitely be messin&#39; with that Orrery device when it hits the Marketplace.&#34;<sup id="_ref-LCOFCD_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LCOFCD" title="">[30]</a></sup> The pack was eventually released on April 17.<sup id="_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#_note-95" title="">[95]</a></sup> Also on April 7, <a href="/wiki/EB_Games" id="w">EB Games</a> and <a href="/wiki/GameStop" id="w">GameStop</a> began offering a coupon promising one free download of the &#34;Horse Armor&#34; pack with every purchase of the PC edition of <i>Oblivion</i>; Xbox 360 owners were once again out of luck.<sup id="_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#_note-96" title="">[96]</a></sup> The &#34;Wizard&#39;s Tower&#34;, called the &#34;Frostcrag Spire&#34; in-game, was released on April 24 for the same price as the &#34;Orrery&#34;.<sup id="_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#_note-97" title="">[97]</a></sup></p>
<p>New releases continued into late 2006. The &#34;Thieves&#39; Den&#34;, a 2.27MB download offering the chance to &#34;Uncover a famous pirate&#39;s lost ship and claim it for your own&#34;, was released on May 22 for the Xbox 360, priced at 150 Marketplace points, &#34;roughly&#34; equivalent to <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$</a> $1.89.<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup> Explaining the add-on, Ashley Cheng stated &#34;Basically, it&#39;s <a href="/wiki/The_Goonies" id="w">Goonies</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#_note-99" title="">[99]</a></sup> &#34;Mehrunes&#39; Razor&#34;, a quest revolving around a mage in search of the deadly Daedric artifact known as Mehrunes&#39; Razor, was released on June 14. It became the most expensive download yet, at <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$2</a>.99 for PC users and 250 Marketplace points, equivalent to <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$</a>$3.13, for Xbox 360 owners.<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup> One <a href="/wiki/1UP" id="w">1UP</a> reporter took the occasion to reflect on the increasing price of owning the &#34;complete&#34; <i>Oblivion</i>. With all the add-ons included, he calculated, &#34;That&#39;s over $80 in game for the complete version of Oblivion, thus far.&#34; Foreseeing eventual problems with the upcoming <a href="/wiki/PS3" id="w">PS3</a> release, and a potential bundling of all the software for a cheaper price, he wondered: &#34;will Xbox 360 and PC users feel slighted?&#160;...&#160;Microtransactions are sticky business.&#34;<sup id="_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#_note-101" title="">[101]</a></sup> Joystiq continued to harp on the &#34;Horse Armor&#34; add-on in their notice of the quest&#39;s release. &#34;With a weapon like that, who needs horse armor?&#34;<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup> On July 13, &#34;The Vile Lair&#34;, sporting a hidden crypt called &#34;Deepscorn Hollow&#34; for players bitten with <i>Oblivion</i>&#39;s vampirism bug, was released. Like the &#34;Orrery&#34; and the &#34;Wizard&#39;s Tower&#34;, Bethesda set &#34;The Vile Lair&#34;&#39;s PC release price at <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$1</a>.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$1</a>.88.<sup id="_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#_note-103" title="">[103]</a></sup> Joystiq responded positively to the new price point. &#34;What a bargain!&#160;...&#160;It&#39;s good to see the folks at <i>Oblivion</i> have learned their lesson and aren&#39;t offering relatively super expensive content not fit to see the light of day.&#34;<sup id="_ref-NOBDOWN_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NOBDOWN" title="">[31]</a></sup> On August 31, &#34;Spell Tomes&#34;, adding books with &#34;wondrous and powerful magic spells,&#34; to the random loot of fallen foes, was released, for the price of <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">US$1</a>.00 on both the Xbox 360 and the PC.<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup> Beginning on December 22 and continuing on until the end of the year, Bethesda offered their &#34;Mehrunes Razor&#34; package free of charge, as a sort of holiday gift.<sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup> <i>Oblivion</i>&#39;s final content pack, named &#34;Fighter&#39;s Stronghold&#34;, was released <a href="/wiki/October_15" id="w">October 15</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.
