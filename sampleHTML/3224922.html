<p><i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> is co-created/produced by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Dante_DiMartino" id="w">Michael Dante DiMartino</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bryan_Konietzko" id="w">Bryan Konietzko</a> at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in <a href="/wiki/Burbank%2C_California" id="w">Burbank, California</a>. The first episode of <i>Avatar</i> was created six years following its original conception, a period much longer than the norm for animated shows.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>
According to co-creator Bryan Konietzko, the concept of the program was initially conceived when he took an old sketch of his—a balding, middle-aged man—and turned the character into a child. Bryan then did a drawing in which the boy was shepherding bison through the sky. At the time, Mike DiMartino was studying a documentary about explorers who were trapped in the <a href="/wiki/South_Pole" id="w">South Pole</a>. The various aspects all seemed to gradually come together. The two thought:</p><blockquote>&#34;There&#39;s an air guy along with these water people trapped in a snowy wasteland... and maybe some fire people are pressing down on them...&#34;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></blockquote> The co-creators proceeded to successfully pitch the idea to Nickelodeon <a href="/wiki/VP" id="w">VP</a> and <a href="/wiki/Executive_producer" id="w">executive producer</a> Eric Coleman just two weeks later.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>

<p>While it was originally set to premiere in November 2004, the first episode of <i>Avatar</i> aired in February 2005. Following the conclusion of the first season of <i>Avatar</i>, Nickelodeon promptly ordered a second twenty-episode season that premiered on <a href="/wiki/March_17" id="w">March 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, and concluded on <a href="/wiki/December_1" id="w">December 1</a>.<sup id="_ref-secondseason_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-secondseason" title="">[4]</a></sup> The third season began on <a href="/wiki/September_21" id="w">September 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> and reportedly will go on to feature twenty-one episodes rather than the usual twenty.<sup id="_ref-as_S3airdate_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-as_S3airdate" title="">[5]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-AvSpirit493_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AvSpirit493" title="">[10]</a></sup> </p>

<i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> takes place in a fantasy world, home to humans, fantastic animals, and supernatural spirits. Human civilization is divided into four nations—the <a href="/wiki/Water_Tribe" id="w">Water Tribes</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Earth_Kingdom" id="w">Earth Kingdom</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Air_Nomads" id="w">Air Nomads</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Fire_Nation" id="w">Fire Nation</a>. Within each nation, an order of men and women called &#34;Benders&#34; have the ability to manipulate their native <a href="/wiki/Classical_element" id="w">element</a>. These Bending arts combine a certain style of martial arts and elemental <a href="/wiki/Mysticism" id="w">mysticism</a>. The Bending types are <a href="/wiki/Waterbender" id="w">Waterbending</a>, <a href="/wiki/Earthbender" id="w">Earthbending</a>, <a href="/wiki/Firebender" id="w">Firebending</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Airbender" id="w">Airbending</a>.<sup id="_ref-avatar2/index.jhtml_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-avatar2/index.jhtml" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In each generation, one person is capable of Bending all four elements; this is the Avatar, the spirit of the planet manifested in human form. When the Avatar dies, he or she is <a href="/wiki/Reincarnation" id="w">reincarnated</a> into a  baby native in the next of the four nations in the Avatar Cycle, which parallels the seasons: winter for water, spring for earth, summer for fire, and autumn for air.<sup id="_ref-Southern_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Southern" title="">[12]</a></sup> While legend holds that the Avatar must master the elements in order, starting with their native element, this can sometimes be compromised when the situation requires it. Learning to bend the element opposite one&#39;s native element is extremely difficult because opposing Bending arts are based on opposing fighting styles and doctrines. <a href="/wiki/Firebending" id="w">Firebending</a> and <a href="/wiki/Waterbending" id="w">Waterbending</a> are opposites, as are <a href="/wiki/Earthbending" id="w">Earthbending</a> and <a href="/wiki/Airbending" id="w">Airbending</a>. <sup id="_ref-LearnEarthbending_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LearnEarthbending" title="">[13]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Avatar possesses a unique power that resides within him or her, called the <a href="/wiki/Avatar_State" id="w">Avatar State</a>. It is a <a href="/wiki/Defence_mechanism" id="w">defense mechanism</a> that empowers the Avatar with the skills and knowledge of all the past Avatars. When the state is reached, the current Avatar will be able to wield the combined power of all past lives. When the Avatar enters this state, his or her eyes and mouth, and tattoos in the case of an Airbender, begin to glow. The glow is the representation of all the Avatar&#39;s previous incarnations focusing their energy through his or her body. However, if the Avatar is killed in the Avatar State, then the reincarnation cycle will be broken, and the Avatar will cease to exist.<sup id="_ref-AvatarState_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AvatarState" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Through the ages, countless incarnations of the Avatar have served to keep the four nations in harmony and maintain world order.<sup id="_ref-avatar2/index.jhtml_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-avatar2/index.jhtml" title="">[11]</a></sup> The Avatar also serves as the bridge between the physical world and the <a href="/wiki/Spirit_World_(Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender)" id="w">Spirit World</a>, home of the world&#39;s disembodied spirits.<sup id="_ref-SpiritWorld_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SpiritWorld" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Plot_synopsis" name="Plot_synopsis"></a><h3>Plot synopsis</h3>
<p>{{main}}
A century prior to the series&#39; opening, <a href="/wiki/Aang" id="w">Aang</a>, a 12-year-old Airbender of the Air Nomads&#39; <a href="/wiki/Air_Nomads#Southern Air Temple" id="w">Southern Air Temple</a>, learned from the elder monks that he was the Avatar. Usually, the Avatar is told of his or her true identity after turning sixteen; however, the monks feared that a war between the four nations was on the horizon and that soon the Avatar would be required to maintain balance and order in the world. Shortly thereafter, the monks decreed that Aang would be separated from his guardian, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_minor_recurring_characters#Monk Gyatso" id="w">Monk Gyatso</a>, and sent to the <a href="/wiki/Air_Nomads#Eastern Air Temple" id="w">Eastern Air Temple</a> to complete his training.</p>
<p>Confused, frightened, and overwhelmed by these recent events and his new responsibilities as the Avatar, Aang fled from his home on his <a href="/wiki/List_of_Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_creatures#Flying Bison" id="w">flying bison</a>, <a href="/wiki/Appa" id="w">Appa</a>. While traveling over frigid southern ocean waters, a sudden storm caused Appa to plunge deep into the sea. Aang unconsciously entered the Avatar State, and used a combination of Airbending and Waterbending to protect Appa and himself. By creating an air bubble around them and then freezing it, Aang was able to ensure that he and Appa could breathe and be protected from the storm until it dissipated. However, the storm transferred the bubble very near the south pole and it could not thaw, forcing the two of them into a state of <a href="/wiki/Suspended_animation" id="w">suspended animation</a>.<sup id="_ref-Southern_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Southern" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The series opens one hundred years later, with the <a href="/wiki/Fire_Nation" id="w">Fire Nation</a> on the brink of victory in its imperialist war. All of the Air Nomads are believed to have been destroyed. The Water Tribes are in crisis — the Southern Water Tribe&#39;s warriors have left to wage war, leaving their home defenseless, while the Northern Water Tribe, though largely intact, is continually on the defensive.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> The vast <a href="/wiki/Earth_Kingdom" id="w">Earth Kingdom</a> is now the only true barrier to the Fire Nation&#39;s conquest, but as the Fire Nation continues to encroach on its borders and conquer its territories, hopes of victory grow bleaker with each passing year.</p>
<p>Two teenage siblings from the Southern Water Tribe — <a href="/wiki/Katara" id="w">Katara</a>, an inexperienced Waterbender, and her brother, <a href="/wiki/Sokka" id="w">Sokka</a>, a warrior and caretaker of the tribe — discover and free Aang and Appa from the iceberg. Aang soon discovers to his horror that, during his absence, a century-long war has been waged. The very year he vanished, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_minor_book_1_characters#Fire Lord Sozin" id="w">Fire Lord Sozin</a> took advantage of both the Avatar&#39;s absence and the <a href="/wiki/Firebender" id="w">Firebending</a>-enhancing powers of a passing <a href="/wiki/Comet" id="w">comet</a> (later named &#34;Sozin&#39;s Comet,&#34; in his honor) to launch a war on the other nations.<sup id="_ref-Roku_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Roku" title="">[17]</a></sup> To Aang&#39;s shock and disbelief, the Fire Nation&#39;s opening gambit had been a <a href="/wiki/Genocide" id="w">genocidal</a> assault on the Air Nomads. The Air Temples were stormed and the Airbenders slaughtered in the Fire Nation&#39;s effort to break the Avatar Cycle, leaving Aang as the last known Airbender in existence.<sup id="_ref-Southern_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Southern" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the Avatar, Aang&#39;s duty is to restore harmony and peace to the four nations. Along with his newly discovered friends Katara and Sokka, his flying bison Appa and his <a href="/wiki/List_of_Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_creatures#Winged Lemur" id="w">winged lemur</a> <a href="/wiki/List_of_Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_major_secondary_characters#Momo" id="w">Momo</a>, and later the blind Earthbender <a href="/wiki/Toph" id="w">Toph</a>, Aang travels the world to master all four elements. During his quest, he must constantly avoid being captured by the banished <a href="/wiki/Zuko" id="w">Prince Zuko</a> and, later, Zuko&#39;s cleverly deceptive and fiery sister, <a href="/wiki/Azula" id="w">Princess Azula</a>.</p>
<p>Although normally years of disciplined training are required to master a single Bending art, Aang must be a master of all four and defeat <a href="/wiki/List_of_Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_major_secondary_characters#Fire Lord Ozai" id="w">Fire Lord Ozai</a> by summer&#39;s end, when the return of Sozin&#39;s Comet will give the Firebenders the power to win the war. If these events come to pass, not even the Avatar will possess the ability to restore balance to the world.<sup id="_ref-Roku_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Roku" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <i>Avatar</i> series has been praised for several strong points including <a href="/wiki/Characterization" id="w">character development</a> and depth. All the main characters are portrayed as &#34;marvelously flawed human beings,&#34; and the series shone in its initial season with the characterizations of its main antagonists.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

<li><b><a href="/wiki/Appa" id="w">Appa</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/Dee_Bradley_Baker" id="w">Dee Bradley Baker</a>) is the ten-ton flying bison companion of the Avatar <a href="/wiki/Aang" id="w">Aang</a>, who was also trapped with him in the iceberg. Being capable of airbending and flying, Appa has been the group&#39;s main form of transport in their quest to help Aang, and occasionally assists in battle as well. He is Aang&#39;s animal guide, with whom he shares a spiritual connection. Appa is stubborn, uncomfortable when underground, and often irritable, but is gentle, loyal, and very protective of his friends, often losing his temper when confronting someone who is a threat.</li>

<a id="Avatar" name="Avatar"></a><h4>Avatar</h4>
The term &#34;<a href="/wiki/Avatar" id="w">Avatar</a>&#34; comes from the <a href="/wiki/Sanskrit" id="w">Sanskrit</a> word <i>Avatāra</i>, (<a href="/wiki/Sanskrit_language" id="w">Sanskrit</a>: अवतार), which means &#34;descent.&#34; In <a href="/wiki/Hindu_mythology" id="w">Hindu mythology</a>, gods often manifest themselves into Avatars to restore balance on earth after a period of great evil. The <a href="/wiki/Chinese_character" id="w">Chinese characters</a> appearing above the word &#34;Avatar&#34; in the show&#39;s opening mean &#34;the divine medium who has descended upon the mortal world.&#34;<sup id="_ref-calligraphy.html_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-calligraphy.html" title="">[27]</a></sup>

When <a href="/wiki/Aang" id="w">Aang</a> was a child, he unknowingly revealed that he was the Avatar when he chose four toys out of thousands that symbolized each of the main elements. These four toys were the same ones that past Avatars had chosen for generations when they were children, revealing that Aang was the <a href="/wiki/Reincarnation" id="w">reincarnation</a> of the Avatar. There is a similar test a child must pass in order to be recognized as the reincarnation of a <a href="/wiki/Tulku" id="w">Tulku</a> <a href="/wiki/Lama" id="w">Lama</a> in <a href="/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism" id="w">Tibetan Buddhism</a>. According to the book <i>Magic and Mystery in Tibet</i> by <a href="/wiki/Alexandra_David-Neel" id="w">Alexandra David-Neel</a>, &#34;a number of objects such as <a href="/wiki/Rosary" id="w">rosaries</a>, ritualistic implements, books, tea-cups, etc., are placed together, and the child must pick out those which belonged to the late <i>tulku</i>, thus showing that he recognizes the things which were <i>theirs</i> in their previous life.&#34;<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Avatar&#39;s official site states &#34;the successor is expected to show signs of continuity with the previous Avatar, such as being born within a week of the death.&#34;<sup id="_ref-avatar2/index.jhtml_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-avatar2/index.jhtml" title="">[11]</a></sup>

<a id="Elements" name="Elements"></a><h4>Elements</h4>
<i>Avatar</i> draws on four <a href="/wiki/Classical_elements" id="w">classical elements</a> for its bending arts (rather than the <a href="/wiki/Wu_Xing" id="w">5 Classical Chinese Elements</a>): <a href="/wiki/Water_(classical_element)" id="w">Water</a>, <a href="/wiki/Earth_(classical_element)" id="w">Earth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fire_(classical_element)" id="w">Fire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Air_(classical_element)" id="w">Air</a>. Although each has its own variation, most <a href="/wiki/Ancient_philosophy" id="w">ancient philosophies</a> incorporate these four elements in some way, including the classical <a href="/wiki/Tattva" id="w">Hindu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mah%C4%81bh%C5%ABta" id="w">Buddhist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Classical_elements#Classical elements in Greece" id="w">Greek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Five_elements_(Japanese_philosophy)" id="w">Japanese</a> elemental traditions. 

In the show’s opening, each element is accompanied by 2 Chinese characters — an ancient Chinese <a href="/wiki/Seal_script" id="w">seal script</a> character of the element on the left, along with a more modern Chinese character of the corresponding attribute on the right:

<div class="caption">20px</div>&#34; ({{zh-tsp}}), which means &#34;strong.&#34;</li>

<a id="Western_culture" name="Western_culture"></a><h3>Western culture</h3>
<a id="Cinema_and_books" name="Cinema_and_books"></a><h4>Cinema and books</h4>
Films series such as <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" id="w">Star Wars</a></i>, along with book series such as <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" id="w">Harry Potter</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" id="w">The Lord of the Rings</a></i> were a heavy influence when it came to developing the story of <i>Avatar</i>, as the creators wanted to tell their own epic Legend &#38; Lore story. <sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup>

<a id="Asian_culture" name="Asian_culture"></a><h3>Asian culture</h3>
<a id="Calligraphy" name="Calligraphy"></a><h4>Calligraphy</h4>
<a href="/wiki/Chinese_character" id="w">Chinese characters</a> done in traditional <a href="/wiki/East_Asian_calligraphy" id="w">East Asian calligraphy</a> styles are used for nearly all the writing that appears in <i>Avatar</i>. For each instance of calligraphy, an appropriate style is used, ranging from the <a href="/wiki/Seal_script" id="w">seal script</a> (more archaic) to the <a href="/wiki/Clerical_script" id="w">clerical script</a>.<sup id="_ref-calligraphy.html_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-calligraphy.html" title="">[27]</a></sup> The show employs calligrapher Siu-Leung Lee as a consultant and translator. <i>See also: the <a href="/wiki/Oracle_Bone_Script" id="w">Oracle Bone Script</a> for the origin of many Hanzi characters and some Oracle Bone characters themselves are even used in the Avatar series.</i>

<a id="Fighting_styles" name="Fighting_styles"></a><h4>Fighting styles</h4>
The fighting choreography of <i>Avatar</i> draws from martial arts, and the fighting styles and weaponry are based on <a href="/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts" id="w">Chinese martial arts</a>, with each bending art corresponding to a certain real-world style or styles. The creators use <a href="/wiki/Tai_Chi_Chuan" id="w">Tai Chi</a> for <a href="/wiki/Waterbender" id="w">waterbending</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hung_Gar" id="w">Hung Gar</a> for <a href="/wiki/Earthbender" id="w">earthbending</a> (although <a href="/wiki/Toph" id="w">Toph</a> employs a Chu Gar <a href="/wiki/Southern_Praying_Mantis_(martial_art)" id="w">Southern Praying Mantis</a> style),<sup id="_ref-con_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-con" title="">[31]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Northern_Shaolin" id="w">Northern Shaolin</a> for <a href="/wiki/Firebender" id="w">firebending</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Baguazhang" id="w">Ba Gua</a> for <a href="/wiki/Airbender" id="w">airbending</a>.<sup id="_ref-avatar2/index.jhtml_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-avatar2/index.jhtml" title="">[11]</a></sup> The show employs <a href="/wiki/Sifu" id="w">Sifu</a> Kisu of the Harmonious Fist Chinese Athletic Association as a martial arts consultant.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>

Each fighting style was chosen to represent the element it projected:

<ul>
<li>Yang Style <a href="/wiki/Tai_Chi" id="w">Tai Chi</a> creates flowing energy, and fluid movements to represent water, turning an opponent&#39;s force against them. The Waterbenders find their offense in a strong defense, using the principles of energy in Tai Chi to redirect force, rather than meet it head on. </li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Hung_Gar" id="w">Hung Gar</a> was chosen for its firmly rooted stances, linear patterns, and powerful strikes to represent the solid nature of the earth. The martial art is based on the movements of animals, particularly the tiger, which represents Hard Power, and the crane, which represents Soft Power.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Northern_Shaolin" id="w">Northern Shaolin</a> Long Fist uses fast, aggressive attacks and techniques, making it the perfect candidate to mimic the power of fire. The strong kicks and jabs of the style, and the speed with which they are executed were meant to replicate the ferocity with which fire spreads and burns. The forms of <a href="/wiki/Changquan" id="w">Changquan</a> are beautiful to watch, almost resembling dances, but also incredibly deadly, such is the nature of fire. In comparison to others, the style does not employ extensive defensive movements.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Ba_Gua" id="w">Ba Gua&#39;s</a> erratic, circular movements were chosen to represent air&#39;s unpredictability and cyclical motion. <a href="/wiki/Centrifugal" id="w">Centrifugal</a> force plays a vital role in generating power in Ba Gua, as the style lacks many finishing moves. This is echoed in the Air Nomads&#39; belief that all life is precious, and should be protected. </li>
<li>Chu Gar <a href="/wiki/Southern_Praying_Mantis" id="w">Southern Praying Mantis</a> has distinguishing movements and unique footwork that are employed by <a href="/wiki/Toph_Bei_Fong" id="w">Toph Bei Fong</a> to complement her blindness, giving her an anomalous style of Earthbending.<sup id="_ref-con_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-con" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></li></ul>
Non-Chinese arts have also appeared. The pirates who appear in Book One, Episodes <a href="/wiki/The_Waterbending_Scroll" id="w">Nine</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Waterbending_Master" id="w">Eighteen</a>, employ Japanese weapons, a possible nod to the historical <a href="/wiki/Shaolin_kung_fu#Pirates" id="w">clashes</a> between Shaolin monks and Japanese pirates. In <a href="/wiki/The_Headband" id="w">The Headband</a>, Aang&#39;s adaptation of martial arts forms into dance techniques evolves into a game of Brazilian <a href="/wiki/Capoeira" id="w">capoeira</a>, complete with roda and batteria, with Katara.

The flow of <a href="/wiki/Qi" id="w">chi</a> is the engine behind the bending arts. Benders require chi to flow from the breath as form of energy derived from breathing and oxygenation, and then extend that energy past their body to manipulate or manifest their element. This chi is stored in the abdomen of the bender, known among martial artists as the <a href="/wiki/Dantian" id="w">Dantian</a>. Different choices of directing energy are referred to different kinds of Jing ({{zh-tsp}}), a system used to describe movements in sparring such as positive, or aggressive, negative, or defensive, and neutral, which is neither aggressive nor defensive.

The ability to bend stems from a compound of genetics and spirituality. As stated by the creators, all Air Nomads are benders as a result of their small population and increased spirituality in comparison to other nations. Civilization reduces spirituality and thus every nation has a different percentage of benders.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> 

<a id="Asian_film" name="Asian_film"></a><h3>Asian film</h3>
Asian cinema had a profound effect on the utilization of the choreographed martial art bending moves. <i>Avatar</i> creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino stated the particular influence in a magazine interview:

<a id="Anime" name="Anime"></a><h3>Anime</h3>
While <i>Avatar</i> is not considered an <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a> because of its American origin, one review has commented that &#34;<i>Avatar</i> blurs the line between anime and (US) domestic cartoons until it becomes irrelevant.&#34;<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> In addition, Avatar has many features of anime such as having a different color palette from other animated shows.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup>

<i>Avatar</i> creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino confirmed a particular anime influence in a magazine interview:

<a id="Broadcast_history" name="Broadcast_history"></a><h3>Broadcast history</h3>
The show was first revealed to the public in a teaser reel at <a href="/wiki/Comic-Con_International" id="w">Comic-Con</a> 2004.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> It was scheduled to air on Nickelodeon on <a href="/wiki/November_29" id="w">November 29</a> of that year, but was delayed until <a href="/wiki/February_21" id="w">February 21</a> of 2005. The first two episodes <sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup>of the series were shown together in a one-hour premiere event in the United States.

<a id="Promotion_and_merchandising" name="Promotion_and_merchandising"></a><h3>Promotion and merchandising</h3>
<i>Avatar<b>s success has led to promotions with <a href="/wiki/Burger_King" id="w">Burger King</a> and <a href="/wiki/Upper_Deck_Company" id="w">Upper Deck Entertainment</a>, an Avatar-themed <a href="/wiki/Roller_coaster" id="w">roller coaster</a> that debuted on April 14, 2006, at <a href="/wiki/Kings_Island" id="w">Kings Island</a> amusement park and a second to open in 2008 at <a href="/wiki/The_Park_at_MOA" id="w">The Park at MOA</a>, and two special issues of <i><a href="/wiki/Nickelodeon_Magazine" id="w">Nick Mag Presents</a></i> dedicated entirely to the show. Various members of the <i>Avatar</i> staff and cast appeared at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International convention, while co-creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko appeared as guests of honor with Martial Arts Consultant Sifu Kisu at the Pacific Media Expo on <a href="/wiki/October_28" id="w">October 28</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>. <i>Avatar</i> also has its own line of t-shirts, <a href="/wiki/LEGO" id="w">LEGO</a> playsets, toys, a <a href="/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_Trading_Card_Game" id="w">trading card game</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Cine-manga" id="w">cine-manga</a>, and two video games.

The <a href="/wiki/Mattel" id="w">Mattel</a>-produced action figure toy line generated some controversy with its exclusion of any female characters. While minor male characters (such as <a href="/wiki/List_of_Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender_minor_recurring_characters#King Bumi" id="w">King Bumi</a>) and forms of the main characters unseen in the program (such as &#39;Water Nation Aang&#39;) were included, significant female characters, most notably Katara, were missing, leading to accusations of <a href="/wiki/Sexism" id="w">sexism</a>.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> Mattel eventually came to release information stating that they have taken account of Katara&#39;s increased role within the program and also that she would be included in the figure assortment for mid 2007 release.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup>  Unfortunately, representatives of <a href="/wiki/Fisher_Price" id="w">Fisher Price</a>/Mattel have released that the <i>Avatar</i> toyline has been discontinued due to poor sales. No new action figures are to be produced and made available aside from those past released in February 2006 that may already be on the shelves. 

Nickelodeon executives have since released highly optimistic plans for upcoming marketing strategies in regards to <i>Avatar</i>, with Nickelodeon President Cyma Zarghami openly stating their belief that if done correctly, the franchise very well &#34;could become [their] <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" id="w">Harry Potter</a></i>.&#34; Nickelodeon expects consumers to spend about $121 million in 2007 on the emerging franchise, rising to $254 million in 2009 (not including revenue from commercial advertisers). The revenues make <i>Avatar</i> one of the most profitable animated series in television history. The marketing plans are to be enacted coinciding with the release of the first of a trilogy of live-action films based on the series in 2009.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup>

</b></i><a id="Feature_film_adaptation" name="Feature_film_adaptation"></a><h3>Feature film adaptation</h3>
On <a href="/wiki/January_8" id="w">January 8</a>, 2007, <a href="/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" id="w">Paramount Pictures</a>&#39; <a href="/wiki/MTV_Films" id="w">MTV Films</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nick_Movies" id="w">Nick Movies</a> announced that they have signed <a href="/wiki/M._Night_Shyamalan" id="w">M. Night Shyamalan</a> to write, direct and produce a trilogy of live-action films based on the series, the first of which will encompass the main characters&#39; adventures of Book One.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> The film is now in a dispute with <a href="/wiki/James_Cameron" id="w">James Cameron</a>&#39;s film <i><a href="/wiki/Avatar_(film)" id="w">Avatar</a></i> regarding title ownership.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup>

Avatar co-creators <a href="/wiki/Michael_Dante_DiMartino" id="w">Mike DiMartino</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bryan_Konietzko" id="w">Bryan Konietzko</a> have come forward to voice their opinion within an interview regarding M. Night Shyamalan writing, directing and producing the film. The two displayed much enthusiasm over Shyamalan&#39;s decision for the adaptation, stating that they admire his work and he in turn respects their material. This newfound information dispels fears that the co-creators were going to be left completely out of the creative process as Paramount did not specify their level of contribution when initial announcements of the deal with Shyamalan came forward.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup>

<a id="Musical_score" name="Musical_score"></a><h3>Musical score</h3>
Avatar features an extensive original musical score, written by composers Benjamin Wynn and <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Zuckerman" id="w">Jeremy Zuckerman</a>, otherwise known as <i>The Track Team</i>.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup>
