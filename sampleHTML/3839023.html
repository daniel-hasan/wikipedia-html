The city of <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a> is home to a vibrant and well-documented musical heritage, stretching back to colonial times.

<p>Philadelphia&#39;s musical heritage has been described by music author Richie Unterberger, as &#34;not nearly as (influential) in American popular music as its size might indicate&#34;, which Unterberger attributes to a &#34;[musical] shadow thrown by New York&#34;, which is not far north of Philadelphia.  Nevertheless, Unterberger notes that Philadelphia has &#34;played an important part in the history of <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_roll" id="w">rock and roll</a> by being home to one of the most dependable audiences on the planet, rather than as an incubator of major performers&#34;.

<a id="Music_history" name="Music_history"></a><h2> Music history </h2>

<p>The earliest music in the Philadelphia area was that of the <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" id="w">indigenous peoples of the area</a>, though little is known about their music.  The city soon rose to prominence as a major cultural capital in the thirteen colonies of North American, and then in the fledgling United States.  The city established a reputation for classical music, Roman Catholic liturgical music and other styles, which grew throughout the 19th century.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, Philadelphia&#39;s population grew steadily more diverse, with immigrants from Ireland, Italy and Jamaica constituting the most sizable groups.  Philadelphia became a regional center for <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Italy" id="w">Italian music</a>, and also produced a number of well-regarded <a href="/wiki/Music_of_Ireland" id="w">Irish</a> musicians and groups.  The city&#39;s sizable Jamaican population brought their own styles of music, such as <a href="/wiki/Dancehall" id="w">dancehall</a>, which became a major part of the Philadelphia nightclub scene in the early 2000s <sup id="_ref-weekly_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-weekly" title="">[21]</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="Colonial_era_and_late_18th_century" name="Colonial_era_and_late_18th_century"></a><h3> Colonial era and late 18th century </h3>

<p>Philadelphia became an important center for music in North America during the colonial era and late 18th century, when it was especially noted for classical composers like <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Reinagle" id="w">Alexander Reinagle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rayner_Taylor" id="w">Rayner Taylor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Susanna_Rowson" id="w">Susannah Haswell Rowson</a>. Reinagle became the most influential figure in Philadelphia&#39;s musical life, organizing a number of concerts, organizations and musical events, including the <a href="/wiki/New_Theatre_(Philadelphia)" id="w">New Theatre</a> with <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Wignell" id="w">Thomas Wignell</a>.  Rowson wrote the <a href="/wiki/Libretto" id="w">librettos</a> for two of Reinagle&#39;s compositions, and was a successful poet, guitarist, singer, playwright and actress.  Taylor also worked with Reinagle at the New Theatre, and was said to be the finest organist in the North American colonies.  <a href="/wiki/Francis_Hopkinson" id="w">Francis Hopkinson</a>, a signer of the <a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence" id="w">Declaration of Independence</a>, was a notable composer of the period.  The prominent local figure <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" id="w">Benjamin Franklin</a> was also a musician, a guitar teacher and inventor of musical instruments like the <a href="/wiki/Glass_harmonica" id="w">glass harmonica</a> <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Colonial Pennsylvania was home to a number of religious minority sects, several of which have played an important role in the musical development of the area.  A number of German <a href="/wiki/Pietist" id="w">Pietists</a> settled in the Philadelphia area in 1694, led by <a href="/wiki/Johannes_Kelpius" id="w">Johannes Kelpius</a>.  These Pietists lived along the banks of the <a href="/wiki/Wissahickon_Creek" id="w">Wissahickon Creek</a>, and became known as the <i><a href="/wiki/Hermits_of_the_Wissahickon" id="w">Hermits (or Mystics) of the Wissahickon</a></i>.  Kelpius was a hymn writer and musician.  Kelpius has been said to be the composer of certain hymn tunes, though music historian Gilbert Chase doubts that he wrote the music, much of which, Chase claims, &#34;is taken from readily identifiable German sources&#34;.  These hymns were translated into English by <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Witt" id="w">Christopher Witt</a>, a painter and musician said to have built the first private (i.e. non-church) <a href="/wiki/Organ_(music)" id="w">organ</a> in the colonies of North America <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest printing of sheet music came from Philadelphia, including an extant copy of <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Watts" id="w">Isaac Watts</a>&#39; <i>Hymns and Spiritual Songs</i>, printed in 1741 by Benjamin Franklin <sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>.  Though Watts&#39; Protestant hymnbook was a historically important document, the city of Philadelphia has long been a major center for Roman Catholic church music.  The first Catholic hymnbook published in the United States came from Philadelphia in 1787, entitled <i>Litanies and Vesper Hymns and Anthems as They Are Sung in the Catholic Church</i>; this collection included music scored for <a href="/wiki/Treble" id="w">treble</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bass_(vocal_range)" id="w">bass</a>, with later editions adding a third vocal section, and used highly-<a href="/wiki/Ornamentation" id="w">ornamented</a> <a href="/wiki/Plainchant" id="w">plainchant</a> themes in the <a href="/wiki/Mass" id="w">Mass</a> and hymns.  The publisher <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Carey" id="w">Matthew Carey</a> was particularly influential, publishing a catechism in 1794 that included hymns in later editions <sup id="_ref-adoremus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-adoremus" title="">[25]</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="19th_century" name="19th_century"></a><h3> 19th century </h3>

<p>Philadelphia&#39;s Holy Trinity Church published the first German-American Catholic catechism in 1810, while the music director of St. Augustine&#39;s Catholic Church, <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Carr" id="w">Benjamin Carr</a>, also published hymnbooks in the early 19th century.  Carr&#39;s 1805 work introduced &#34;<a href="/wiki/O_Sanctissima" id="w">O Sanctissima</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Adeste_Fideles" id="w">Adeste Fideles</a>&#34; to American Catholics.  The American <a href="/wiki/Sodality" id="w">Sodality</a> movement began in Philadelphia in 1841, founded by <a href="/wiki/Felix_Barbelin" id="w">Felix Barbelin</a>; Barbelin personally prepared the first <i>American Sodality Manual</i>, which was followed by others throughout the later 19th century.  The Catholic Church of Philadelphia established important institutions of musical education in the early 19th century, with the foundation a singing school and boys choir.  The <a href="/wiki/Sisters_of_Notre_Dame_de_Namur" id="w">Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Sisters_of_the_Holy_Child" id="w">Sisters of the Holy Child</a> published several collections of hymns, some of which were later included in <i>St. Basil&#39;s Hymnal</i><sup id="_ref-adoremus_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-adoremus" title="">[25]</a></sup>.  </p>
<p>In the early 19th century, a Philadelphia composer named <a href="/wiki/William_Henry_Fry" id="w">William Henry Fry</a> was a prominent composer and music journalist, writing for the <i>National Gazette</i> and the <i>Public Ledger</i> <sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup>. The city was becoming a national center for musical development in the mid-19th century, with local religious music changing considerably, and new styles becoming regionally popular, especially <a href="/wiki/English_opera" id="w">English opera</a>.  An important concert was held in Philadelphia in the mid-19th century, one of the first major concerts in the country led by a chorus, in this case from the <a href="/wiki/College_of_Philadelphia" id="w">College of Philadelphia</a> <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup>.

<p>The Philadelphia Roman Catholic musical tradition produced the celebrated and controversial composer <a href="/wiki/Albert_Rosewig" id="w">Albert Rosewig</a>, who &#34;used romanticized harmony for Gregorian chants, and even harmonized the priest&#39;s altar chants&#34; in an attempt to incorporate then-current styles of classical music.  His innovations were eventually forbidden by <a href="/wiki/Pius_X" id="w">Pius X</a>.

<p>Modern Philadelphia has contributed a number of important performers of Irish music, most famously <a href="/wiki/Mick_Moloney" id="w">Mick Moloney</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Vesey" id="w">John Vesey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kevin_McGillian" id="w">Kevin McGillian</a> and <a href="/wiki/S%C3%A9amus_Egan" id="w">Séamus Egan</a>, both of whom were part of a nationwide resurgence of interest in traditional Irish-American music<sup id="_ref-sawyer247_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sawyer247" title="">[35]</a></sup>.  In Philadelphia, this revival of traditional music built on the work of earlier pioneers like <a href="/wiki/Ed_Reavy" id="w">Ed Reavy</a>, a composer who began working in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Philadelphia&#39;s most famous contribution to Irish traditional music is Mick Moloney.  Moloney was from <a href="/wiki/County_Limerick" id="w">County Limerick</a>, and was a musician both in Limerick and in Dublin, playing the <a href="/wiki/Banjo" id="w">banjo</a> and singing; he was also a member of the popular folk group <a href="/wiki/The_Johnstons" id="w">The Johnstons</a>.  Having emigrated to Philadelphia in 1973, Moloney has lectured widely on Irish culture and music and founded the organization <a href="/wiki/Green_Fields_of_America" id="w">Green Fields of America</a>, which promotes Irish-American music.  Egan is a multi-instrumentalist originally from Philadelphia, though he moved back to <a href="/wiki/County_Mayo" id="w">County Mayo</a> as a young man, and has there become a prominent musician.  He is co-founder of the Irish music band Solas, and he co-wrote Sarah McLaughlin&#39;s hit song &#34;I Will Remember You&#34;, featured in the soundtrack for the film <i>The Brothers McMullen</i>, for which Egan also provided the score.<sup id="_ref-sawyer247_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sawyer247" title="">[35]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Albert_Rosewig" id="w">Albert Rosewig</a> had become a prominent local reverend and musical arranger in the late 19th century, known for a modern style that adapted elements of Western classical music.  In 1903, however, Pope <a href="/wiki/Pius_X" id="w">Pius X</a> issued an edict (<i>Motu Proprio</i>), which was intended to reform and restore church music to a more traditional style.  To that end, local composer, conductor and publisher <a href="/wiki/Nicola_Montani" id="w">Nicola Montani</a> led the reform, which restricted musical style and instrumentation, and encouraged the use of <a href="/wiki/Polyphony" id="w">polyphony</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latin_language" id="w">Latin</a> and restored <a href="/wiki/Gregorian_chant" id="w">Gregorian chant</a>.  He was not the only noted local liturgical composer, however, as <a href="/wiki/M._Immacul%C3%A9e" id="w">M. Immaculée</a>, music director of <a href="/wiki/Immaculata_College" id="w">Immaculata College</a>, was also a well-known composer; she was noted as a composer of choral works, and also promoted liturgical music, and female composers, in the Philadelphia area<sup id="_ref-adoremus_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-adoremus" title="">[25]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Montani was from New York, but became prominent in Philadelphia as an editor for liturgical music at local publishers, and music director at several Philadelphia Catholic high schools.  By the 1920s, he had grown in stature, forming the <a href="/wiki/Society_of_St._Gregory" id="w">Society of St. Gregory</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Palestrina_Choir" id="w">Palestrina Choir</a>, which helped to bring attention to <a href="/wiki/Renaissance_music" id="w">Renaissance polyphony</a> and publishing the <i>Catholic Choirmaster</i>, a magazine.  Montani also created a list of music that did and did not meet the standards put forth by <i>Motu Proprio</i>, in the processing banning or altering well-known works by composers ranging from <a href="/wiki/Franz_Schubert" id="w">Franz Schubert</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gioacchino_Rossini" id="w">Gioacchino Rossini</a> to <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Haydn" id="w">Joseph Haydn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" id="w">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a><sup id="_ref-adoremus_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-adoremus" title="">[25]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Montani&#39;s <i>St. Gregory Hymnal</i> was used throughout Philadelphia-area Catholic churches until after the <a href="/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council" id="w">Second Vatican Council</a>.  It was the so-called &#34;Spirit of Vatican II&#34; which made their own rules on Catholic music, against the real wishes of the Council.  Modern churches in the city use instruments ranging from electric <a href="/wiki/Organ_(musical_instrument)" id="w">organs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Electric_guitar" id="w">guitars</a> to <a href="/wiki/Keyboards" id="w">keyboards</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saxophone" id="w">saxophones</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marimba" id="w">marimbas</a>.

<p>The 20th century saw the Orchestra make many innovations, becoming the first of its kind to make electric recordings, to perform on its own commercially sponsored radio broadcast, to perform on the soundtrack of a feature film (<i><a href="/wiki/The_Big_Broadcast" id="w">The Big Broadcast</a></i>), to appear on a national television broadcast, to record the complete Beethoven symphonies on compact disc, to give a live cybercast of a concert on the Internet, and to tour Vietnam<sup id="_ref-Bach-Cantatas_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bach-Cantatas" title="">[36]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Philadelphia developed an early jazz scene, beginning with <a href="/wiki/Ethel_Waters" id="w">Ethel Waters</a>, a singer from nearby <a href="/wiki/Chester%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Chester, Pennsylvania</a>, who was the first star for the <a href="/wiki/Black_Swan_Record_Company" id="w">Black Swan Record Company</a>.  The <a href="/wiki/Standard_Theatre" id="w">Standard Theatre</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dunbar_Theatre" id="w">Dunbar Theatre</a> (later renamed the Lincoln) were important venues for jazz in the early 20th century, when most major performers stopped in Philadelphia along with Baltimore, Washington and New York.  Though jazz was a fundamentally African American style, Philadelphia&#39;s multi-ethnic population was attracted to the style, and the city&#39;s Italian and Jewish neighborhoods produced several well-known jazz musicians.  Two of the most important were the Italian jazz instrumentalists <a href="/wiki/Eddie_Lang" id="w">Eddie Lang</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joe_Venuti" id="w">Joe Venuti</a>, the latter of whom became known as the &#34;Mad Fiddler from Philly&#34;.  Others included <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Amadie" id="w">Jimmy Amadie</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stan_Getz" id="w">Stan Getz</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Chudnick" id="w">Robert Chudnick</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jan_Savitt" id="w">Jan Savitt</a>, who, with his band the Top Hatters, toured with <a href="/wiki/George_Tunnell" id="w">George Tunnell</a>, one of the first African American singers in the city to consistently sing with a major white band.  The city&#39;s early 20th century mainstream dance scene was led by the bandleader <a href="/wiki/Howard_Lanin" id="w">Howard Lanin</a>, whose band performed popular showtunes, waltzes and light jazz <sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Philadelphia&#39;s African American population grew greatly as a result of immigration from the south during World War 2, when future luminaries like the <a href="/wiki/Heath_Brothers" id="w">Heath Brothers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dizzy_Gillespie" id="w">Dizzy Gillespie</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Coltrane" id="w">John Coltrane</a> moved to Philadelphia from the Carolinas.  Philadelphia&#39;s mid-20th century jazz heritage includes an important role in the development of bebop, a style most closely associated with New York.  In the 1940s, Philadelphia jazz was based out of clubs along Columbia Avenue in North Philadelphia and clubs like the Clef Club and Pep&#39;s in South Philadelphia <sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup>. The city produced a number of <a href="/wiki/Bop" id="w">bop</a>-era saxophonists, most famous including <a href="/wiki/John_Coltrane" id="w">John Coltrane</a>, one of the most renowned jazz musicians of the 20th century, known for an &#34;active, vigorous, emotionally charged style&#34; <sup id="_ref-Newcolonist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Newcolonist" title="">[39]</a></sup>.  The city also produced <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Biddle" id="w">Charlie Biddle</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clifford_Brown" id="w">Clifford Brown</a>, <a href="/wiki/Catalyst_(band)" id="w">Catalyst</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philly_Joe_Jones" id="w">Philly Joe Jones</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Smith" id="w">Jimmy Smith</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hank_Mobley" id="w">Hank Mobley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wilbur_Ware" id="w">Wilbur Ware</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hassan_ibn_Ali" id="w">Hassan ibn Ali</a> and <a href="/wiki/Benny_Golson" id="w">Benny Golson</a> <sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In 1970, Philadelphia also became the home of <a href="/wiki/Sun_Ra" id="w">Sun Ra</a>&#39;s band, who helped lay the groundwork for the 1980s scene, which locally produced <a href="/wiki/McCoy_Tyner" id="w">McCoy Tyner</a>, <a href="/wiki/Grover_Washington%2C_Jr." id="w">Grover Washington, Jr.</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Clarke" id="w">Stanley Clarke</a>.

<p>Philadelphia&#39;s first major contribution to mainstream American pop music was the television show <i><a href="/wiki/American_Bandstand" id="w">American Bandstand</a></i>, hosted by <a href="/wiki/Dick_Clark" id="w">Dick Clark</a>.

Clark, as the show&#39;s host, became a major player in the American music industry, and the show brought attention to Philadelphia&#39;s music scene, facilitating the rise of local labels like <a href="/wiki/Swan_Records" id="w">Swan Records</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cameo-Parkway" id="w">Cameo-Parkway</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_Records" id="w">Chancellor Records</a>.

<p>In the 1960s, Philadelphia soul began to develop its own sound, drawing from the <a href="/wiki/Girl_group" id="w">girl group</a> sound with &#34;strong pop melodies and brassy, upbeat production (without as much use of) interactive harmonies&#34;<sup id="_ref-unter70_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-unter70" title="">[44]</a></sup>, while other performers, like the funky <a href="/wiki/Howard_Tate" id="w">Howard Tate</a> adoped a more <a href="/wiki/Southern_soul" id="w">Southern soul</a>-style sound.

<p>R&#38;B and soul-oriented indie labels in the 1960s included Phil-LA and Arctic Records, where the songwriting and producing team of <a href="/wiki/Kenny_Gamble" id="w">Kenny Gamble</a> and <a href="/wiki/Leon_Huff" id="w">Leon Huff</a> began their careers.  Gamble and Huff were architects of the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_soul" id="w">Philadelphia sound</a> in soul music, beginning with their 1967 hit for the <a href="/wiki/Soul_Survivors" id="w">Soul Survivors</a>&#39; &#34;Expressway to Your Heart&#34;.  Their signature sound was sentimental and romantic, and began to develop with <a href="/wiki/The_Intruders" id="w">The Intruders</a>, a long-running pop act.  <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Butler_(singer)" id="w">Jerry Butler</a> became an increasingly important performer later in the decade, as Gamble and Huff experimented with a lush, orchestral sound produced by large ensembles of strings, bells and horns.

<p>In the early 1970s, Philly soul broke through with its most popular recordings of the era.
