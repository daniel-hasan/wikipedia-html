<p>{{Final Fantasy locations}}
{{nihongo}} is a fictional location in the <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XII" id="w">Final Fantasy XII</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Vagrant_Story" id="w">Vagrant Story</a></i> universes. The world was conceived by <a href="/wiki/Yasumi_Matsuno" id="w">Yasumi Matsuno</a> when he joined <a href="/wiki/Square_Co.%2C_Ltd." id="w">Square Co., Ltd.</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Square_Enix" id="w">Square Enix Co., Ltd.</a>) in <a href="/wiki/1995_in_video_gaming" id="w">1995</a>, and has since been expanded upon by several games, with more yet due with the <i>Ivalice Alliance</i> series. Ivalice is described as a complex world with a very long history, and the stories of <i>Vagrant Story</i>, <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i>, and <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> are said to unfold quite close on the Ivalice map.<sup id="_ref-matsunoqa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-matsunoqa" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Though described often as a world, this was only physically true of Ivalice in <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics_Advance" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></i>, in which Ivalice was created parallel to the &#39;real&#39; world. The &#39;true&#39; Ivalice, as witnessed in the remaining games, describes two distinct locations; a geographical region,<sup id="_ref-ivalice_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ivalice" title="">[2]</a></sup> and a smaller <a href="/wiki/Kingdom" id="w">kingdom</a>, both of which belong to a larger, unnamed world. Generally, however, the term Ivalice is also used to refer to the conceptual setting, rather as one might say &#34;the world of <a href="/wiki/Medieval_Europe" id="w">medieval Europe</a>.&#34;</p>
<a id="Concept_and_creation" name="Concept_and_creation"></a><h2>Concept and creation</h2>
<p>Ivalice has been featured in several <i>Final Fantasy</i> games, as well as in <i><a href="/wiki/Vagrant_Story" id="w">Vagrant Story</a></i> to a lesser extent. This fictional world was created by <a href="/wiki/Yasumi_Matsuno" id="w">Yasumi Matsuno</a> with its own identity; a medieval-like world where magic and machine exist together; with usual elements of <i>Final Fantasy</i>; such as Chocobos, Crystals and magic spells, blended into its setting.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></i> features the kingdom of Ivalice, neighboring the kingdom of Romanda in the northwest, separated by Larner Channel sea, and the kingdom of Ordalia at the east. Only Humans populate the area, and even though magic is prominent, airships have ceased to exist following a mysterious catastrophe. The worldview is similar to medieval England, with the Glabados Church a prominent religious entity.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics_Advance" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></i>, the protagonist lives in a town named St. Ivalice, an area mirroring the modern world located at a four-seasoned region. Following the characters&#39; discovery of the book called the Gran Grimoire, St. Ivalice was transformed into the kingdom of Ivalice, mirroring a <i>Final Fantasy</i> game.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The game is confirmed to be <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> due to existence of the races that inhabit the game; Bangaa, Moogle, Viera and Nu Mou.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XII" id="w">Final Fantasy XII</a></i>, Ivalice covers three continents, Ordalia, Valendia and Kerwon. The demography consists of the known races: Humes, Bangaa, Viera, Seeq and Moogles, and other  minority races. Civilization is advanced in this world where the use of magical stone called magicite is extensive in everyday life, airships are a prominent transportation and multi-story buildings cover the cityscape.
Ivalice in <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> is designed based on a mixture of cultures. According to the game developers, these designs are inspired from a mixture of medieval Mediterranean countries,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Turkish architecture,<sup id="_ref-Q&A_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q&A" title="">[6]</a></sup> art-deco from India,<sup id="_ref-ffshrine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ffshrine" title="">[7]</a></sup> the cityscape of New York<sup id="_ref-Q&A_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q&A" title="">[6]</a></sup> and the Arabic culture found hidden in European countries. As such, many patterns are featured as geometrical and arabesque in shape.<sup id="_ref-AkiInterview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AkiInterview" title="">[8]</a></sup> The cityscape is also conceived by Matsuno as being dirty and weather-worn, mirroring the conditions of a medieval landscape.<sup id="_ref-Q&A_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q&A" title="">[6]</a></sup> The natural landscape also mirrors Earth&#39;s geographical features, including large expanse of deserts and snowy mountains.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The timeline of <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> as compared to <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i>.</div></div>

The timeline of Ivalice as presented in the games was left quite vague, and formerly other official sources had said little on the matter. A few venerable sources have made their own conclusion on the timeline of Ivalice.<sup id="_ref-GameSpot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameSpot" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> The official timeline, however, was eventually given in the <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> <a href="/wiki/Ultimania" id="w">Ultimania</a> Omega, and placed the events of <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> before those of <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i>.</p>
<p>There is no direct mention of Ivalice in <i><a href="/wiki/Vagrant_Story" id="w">Vagrant Story</a></i>. However, several references are made; the Kingdom of Valendia, the setting for <i>Vagrant Story</i>, shares its name with a continent of Ivalice appearing in <i>Final Fantasy XII</i>. The Kiltia religion, featured in <i>Final Fantasy XII</i>, was the religion of the <a href="/wiki/Ghost_town" id="w">ghost town</a> Leá Monde, in which the story takes place. Additionally, a quotation from Alazlam J. Durai, a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the Lion War (and narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story told in <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i>), is used at the beginning of the game,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> and the descriptions of several items make direct reference to the same story.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> This would seem to place <i>Vagrant Story</i> latest in the timeline, given its direct references to the events of <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i>.</p>
<p>Some confusion still persists, particularly due to the facts surrounding Saint Ajora, who was executed 1200 years prior to the events of <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i>,<sup id="_ref-ajora_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ajora" title="">[19]</a></sup> yet in the Clan Primer of <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> is said to have separated from the Light of Kiltia religion shortly after its foundation, already two thousand years old.<sup id="_ref-magickpot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-magickpot" title="">[20]</a></sup> While no gender is specified in the North American release of <i>Final Fantasy XII</i>, in both the Japanese Clan Primer and the Ultimania timeline, Ajora is referred to as 聖女アジョラ, <i>Holy Woman Ajora</i>, while Ajora of <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i> is male.<sup id="_ref-ajora_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ajora" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The appearance of some special characters in <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></i> may have further added to the confusion of the era the game takes place in. However, these characters were added into the game to give a sense of surprise and enjoyment to the player but so as to not disturb other future or past events in the history of Ivalice. <a href="/wiki/Cloud_Strife" id="w">Cloud Strife</a>, <a href="/wiki/Balthier" id="w">Balthier</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Luso" id="w">Luso</a> make cameo appearances that have a small or otherwise insignificant impact in <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i>, and these characters originate from, respectively, <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII" id="w">Final Fantasy VII</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XII" id="w">Final Fantasy XII</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics_A2:_Grimoire_of_the_Rift" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</a></i>. They either have originated from the past or the future of Ivalice&#39;s history, depending on the select character.</p>

The events of <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i> are set in the kingdom of Ivalice, which borders Ordalia in the east and the insular nation of Romanda in the north-west, from which it is separated by the Larner Channel. The kingdom forms a <a href="/wiki/Peninsula" id="w">peninsula</a> and is composed of seven provinces which were individual kingdoms before their unification: Gallione, Lionel, Lesalia, Fovoham, Limberry, Zeltennia and Murond.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>The insular province of Murond is home to the Glabados Church and is ruled separately from the royal government.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> In the game&#39;s backstory, Murond&#39;s territory was once connected to the mainland, but was mostly submerged by a disaster involving the Zodiac Stones and which occurred soon after Saint Ajora&#39;s execution, with its city made into a Necrohol, a city of the dead.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> The city of Bervenia, Ajora&#39;s birthplace, is governed by the Church although it is enclosed in the province of Lesalia.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Leá Monde</div>
<i>Vagrant Story</i> is set in the ruins of the city of Leá Monde. The kingdom of Valendia is also heavily mentioned, and a few of its locations are featured in the prologue and the ending sequence. In contrast to the other Ivalice games, magic is rare, being suppressed by religious doctrine.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ankildea_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ankildea" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

The continents in Ivalice are presently home to three nations: Rozarria, Archadia and Dalmasca. There was once the Kingdom of Nabradia and the Republic of Landis in Valendia, now either destroyed or assimilated into the Archadian Empire. Strategically located between the rival neighboring empires of Archadia and Rozarria, Dalmasca&#39;s position as a neutral buffer region between the two countries is eliminated when it is invaded by Archadia. With the fall of Landis and Nabradia and its reduction to an occupied territory under Archadian rule, Dalmasca is set to play a central role in the still-heated dispute between its neighbors, which is escalating once more.</p>
<p>The events of <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> are focused on the area around the Galtean <a href="/wiki/Peninsula" id="w">Peninsula</a>, itself located in the larger Ivalice region.<sup id="_ref-ivalice_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ivalice" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-memoirs_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-memoirs" title="">[29]</a></sup> This area of Ivalice is diverse in both geography and climate,<sup id="_ref-ivalice_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ivalice" title="">[2]</a></sup> ranging from the hilly, clement <a href="/wiki/Grassland" id="w">grasslands</a> of southern Valendia<sup id="_ref-valendia_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-valendia" title="">[30]</a></sup> to the <a href="/wiki/Desert" id="w">deserts</a> of Dalmasca.<sup id="_ref-desert_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-desert" title="">[31]</a></sup> In Kerwon, south of Dalmasca, the lands are arid at lower altitudes, though the higher elevations are the only places in the region known to receive snow.<sup id="_ref-kerwon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kerwon" title="">[32]</a></sup> The north of Kerwon is heavily forested, home to the dense Golmore Jungle, within which lies the magical Feywood.<sup id="_ref-feywood_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-feywood" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-golmore_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-golmore" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>These various micro-climates are influenced by the magical phenomenon known as Mist, an unstable substance with the ability to cause great variation over small areas.<sup id="_ref-mist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mist" title="">[35]</a></sup> Due to the influence of Mist, several areas of Ivalice are &#39;jagd&#39;, areas in which Mist-laden winds and <a href="/wiki/Magicite" id="w">magicite</a>-rich soil interfere with airship mechanisms. As such, jagds tend to be harsh, lawless frontiers, uncontrolled by any nation.<sup id="_ref-jagd_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jagd" title="">[36]</a></sup> Physically, the peninsula area resembles <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> in the east, with the landmasses of Valendia, Ordalia and Kerwon surrounding a central body of water (the Naldoan Sea) on three sides. To the west, Valendia and Kerwon curve away from Ordalia, creating the Galtean Peninsula.</p>
<p>Mist is responsible for the existence of &#39;magicite&#39;, stones that contain magical powers due to the presence of Mist in their crystalline structure. Magicite is divided into three types; spellstones that are used in spell casting, skystones that are installed into a component known as &#39;glossair rings&#39; that give flight to the vehicles, whether small-sized bikes or large airships, and memstones that function much like <a href="/wiki/Recording" id="w">recording</a> devices. The quality of magicite depends on the quantity of Mist and not on the size or shape of the stone. The ubiquitousness of magic and magicite, as well as its cost-efficiency, led to it replacing <a href="/wiki/Electricity" id="w">electricity</a> and its various sources as the dominant usable energy in Ivalice.</p>
<p>Nethicite, another type of magicite, works by absorbing Mist, thus nullifying the effects of magic and storing vast amounts of power. Nethicite can be described as either deifacted or manufacted (literally, god-made or <a href="/wiki/Man-made" id="w">man-made</a>). Deifacted nethicite is nethicite created by the Occuria, the ultimate source of which is the Sun-Cryst. Deifacted nethicite contains a large amount of magic and is known to influence the history of Ivalice.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The <i>Purvama</i> Lemurés</div>
A few locations in the Ivalice of <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> return in <i>Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings</i>, along with a new setting: Lemurés. A legendary <i>Purvama</i> (Floating Continent) raised into the skies by the god Feolthanos long ago, this land is ruled by three “Sacred Crystals” called Auraliths, which erected a barrier to shield the Purvama from the rest of the world. In time, the “Legend of the Floating Land” became an ambition for Sky Pirates who seek the island for Auracite, pieces of Auralith able to allow one to summon entities called Yarhi. The ruins of Lemurés are where the <a href="/wiki/Ivalice#Demography" id="w">Aegyl</a> reside.
But as Vaan and gang soon learned, the sealing of Lemurés was the work of the Occuria, whom Feolthanos defied prior to using the Auralith to become a god-like being.</p>
<a id="Demography" name="Demography"></a><h2>Demography</h2>
<p>The populations seen in <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Vagrant_Story" id="w">Vagrant Story</a></i> are essentially human. The other intelligent races who appear are hostile or monster-like, such as <a href="/wiki/Monsters_of_Final_Fantasy#Other monsters" id="w">Goblins</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ogre" id="w">Ogres</a>. Friendly intelligent races appear in later games set in Ivalice, where the human race is called Humes.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that monsters and the like are thought not to exist by the general populace in <i>Vagrant Story</i>, with the monsters in the isolated Leá Monde all stemming from the Dark. The races are sorted by appearance and then according to the alphabetical order.</p>
<a id="''Final_Fantasy_Tactics_Advance''" name="''Final_Fantasy_Tactics_Advance''"></a><h3>&#39;&#39;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&#39;&#39;</h3>
<p>Ivalice as featured in <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics_Advance" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></i> is populated by four main intelligent races in addition to Humes; all of them also reappearing in <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XII" id="w">Final Fantasy XII</a></i>.</p>
<p>The {{nihongo}} are a <a href="/wiki/Reptilian" id="w">reptilian</a> race living almost twice as long as Humes. Being a very socially and cognitively advanced race, they hate being called &#34;<a href="/wiki/Lizards" id="w">lizards</a>&#34; as this is regarded as an offensive slur. Bangaa in <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> are often considered to be the most integrated of all races into Hume society, and are the race most friendly with the latter, as exemplified with <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Final_Fantasy_XII#Migelo" id="w">Migelo</a>. Bangaa possess great agility and strength, and acute senses of hearing and smell, making them excellent hunters and fighters. However, their eyesight is so poor that some wear blindfolds as part of their clothing. Their magical abilities are generally poor due to problems their unique mouth gives them when chanting magic spells. To make up for this, some Bangaa have developed exclusive high level spells for the race to use.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>The {{nihongo}} are a resourceful race known to be skillful in mechanics and engineering; they were the first pioneers of airship construction. They have longer, rabbit-like ears and tend to have more beige or gray fur.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> In <i>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</i>, the player is guided through the world of Ivalice by the moogles Montblanc and Nono. In <i>Final Fantasy XII</i>, these two characters return albeit with different roles. Although Moogles were featured in <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i> only as summoned creatures, their race is mentioned in the backtstory as having once lived in the Sweegy Woods.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">A Nu Mou from <i>Final Fantasy XII</i></div></div>

The {{nihongo}}　are a dog-like race. They are short and hunched; half the size of an adult Hume, are adept in magic and can speak with monsters. The Nu Mou&#39;s lifespan is three times longer than that of a Hume. Two Nu Mou, <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Final_Fantasy_Tactics_Advance#Babus Swain" id="w">Babus Swain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Final_Fantasy_Tactics_Advance#Ezel Berbier" id="w">Ezel Berbier</a>, appear as optional playable characters in <i>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</i>. All of the races have an infinite number of possible playable characters, but these two are the only Nu Mou with special sprites. In <i>Final Fantasy XII</i>, most of the Nu Mou appear as acolytes of the Kiltia religion, found mainly in Mt. Bur-Omisace.<sup id="_ref-ulp92_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ulp92" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">A Viera from <i>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</i></div></div>

The {{nihongo}} are a rabbit-like race that can live three times as long as a Hume, and divided into two subraces: The light-skinned Veena and dark-skinned Rava. The Viera have rabbit or deer-like features, most notably their long ears. Their feet are shaped in such a way that in order to stand they must wear high heels. Their slender forms heighten their senses and speed, and although their defense is low, Viera agility and finesse are unmatched by other race. In <i>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</i>, Vieras have blue-white or purple-white hair, with only a few having hair that is pure white, which is considered to be a blessing. Viera can listen to the surrounding nature and sense Mist, and can sometimes go berserk from feeling an overwhelmingly vast quantity of active Mist. In <i>Final Fantasy XII</i>, they live in hidden villages deep within the vast forests of Ivalice. The Viera believe themselves to be intimately tied to the &#34;Wood&#34;, a part of the forests themselves, and are rarely involved in matters outside the wood. A Viera that moves out of the forest, like <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Final_Fantasy_XII#Fran" id="w">Fran</a>, is considered an outcast and dead to her people. Mixed breeds of Veena and Rava Viera have accustomed themselves to coexist within Hume society, dyeing their white hair. Regarding the lack of males seen, it is found that males and females live separately, only meeting when there is a need for it.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<a id="''Final_Fantasy_XII''" name="''Final_Fantasy_XII''"></a><h3>&#39;&#39;Final Fantasy XII&#39;&#39;</h3>
<p><i>Final Fantasy XII</i> introduces several other races to Ivalice, with varying importance in the plot of the game.</p>
<p>The {{nihongo}} are a green-skinned humanoid race. Their bodies are relatively small in stature; even as an adult, their height is only the size of a child <a href="/wiki/Races_of_Final_Fantasy#Hume" id="w">Hume</a>. After the kingdom of Nabradia ceased to exist, they designated the Necrohol of Nabudis as their stronghold. The Baknamy are sensitive to the air that they breathe, and living where the air is polluted due to the city&#39;s destruction forces them to wear gas masks. The poorer and less fortunate Baknamy commit crimes to earn a living, targeting adventurers and travelers, causing Humes to view them as a despicable race.<sup id="_ref-ulp93_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ulp93" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>The {{nihongo}}　of <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> are depicted as large, thick-furred appreciators of nature and the arts of war, but disliking unnecessary violence. They have high smelling and hearing senses, which make them able hunters. The Garif prefer to adorn themselves with natural ornaments of animal bones and stones over crafted objects, with the exception of a traditional mask which is worn from birth to death. Their villages are sparsely located in the Bancour Region, and each is governed by a council led by a <a href="/wiki/Patriarchy" id="w">High Elder</a>. Relations with other races are peaceful but rare. Garif merchants are known to trade with the nomads of Giza Plains and the Dalmascans, exchanging items such as Bancour spices. In ancient times, the Occuria granted the Garif nethicite, however the Garif&#39;s dislike for violence hindered them from using its power.<sup id="_ref-ulp92_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ulp92" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>The {{nihongo}} are a long-living, highly intelligent race. Helgas are white-haired, tall, thin, and have long limbs. They can communicate telepathically while asleep, and also probe into the dreams of others. <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Final_Fantasy_XII#Other important characters" id="w">Gran Kiltias Anastasis</a> is the only Helgas who appear within <i>Final Fantasy XII</i>.<sup id="_ref-ulp87_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ulp87" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>The {{nihongo}} are a minor, feline race that appears in Skycity Bhujerba. They are deeply cultured and a bit aristocratic, and act as advisors and representatives for <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Final_Fantasy_XII" id="w">Marquis Halim Ondore the IV</a>.<sup id="_ref-ulp87_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ulp87" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>The {{nihongo}} are a powerful and agile porcine race possessing low intellect and described as barely able to speak human languages. Though somewhat cowardly, they are often hired as mercenaries, guards, or hunters, with a significant amount going into thievery. The Seeq are also attracted by shiny objects, often adorning themselves with such.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>The {{nihongo}} are the &#34;Lords and Masters of the Great Sea&#34;, a name bestowed befitting their presence in the Yensa Sandsea and mastery in taming the Yensa fish for travel. Evolved from crustaceans, their bodies are thin and entirely covered by layers of clothing, which the game&#39;s Bestiary states is either to hide their ugly bodies or to keep themselves protected from the sun. The Urutan-Yensa divided into separate tribes ruled by a queen able to speak the Hume language, and are strictly territorial, attacking anyone who enters their lands. Urutan-Yensa are particularly proud and attached to honor so much that requesting the aid of others outside their race results in a death penalty. They sometimes exile tribe members that show unusual aggressive and violent nature, known as the Urutan-Exile.<sup id="_ref-ulp93_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ulp93" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<a id="''Final_Fantasy_XII:_Revenant_Wings''" name="''Final_Fantasy_XII:_Revenant_Wings''"></a><h3>&#39;&#39;Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings&#39;&#39;</h3>
<p>The {{nihongo}} is a winged, humanlike race appearing in <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XII:_Revenant_Wings" id="w">Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings</a></i>. These wings count as both a blessing (able to fly in the air) and a curse (resulting in a lifespan of 40 years). The Aegyl dwell in the ruins of the Lemurés. They are a people without emotion and thus have no true conflict amongst themselves, but there are a few who tend to go against the will of their people; such as <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Final_Fantasy_XII#Llyud" id="w">Llyud</a>. But overtime, as Auraliths were being destroyed, the Aegyl regained their emotions, with some feeling mostly rage on the Sky Pirates who terrorized them and Ivalice for its sins against them. Their race departed from Ivalice when Lemurés crumbled.</p>
<p>The {{nihongo}} is a sub-race of the Viera, characterized by light blond hair and shorter ears than standard Viera. They are the descendants of the Aegyl chief Feolthanos who fell in love with a full-blood Viera. The Feol were from birth treated as exhiles by their full blood kin, cast out of the Wood to take refuge at Roda Volcano, where none dare enter. Since they have no wings, Feolthanos left the airship Galbana and the Auracite in the hopes that one day they come to him. He inheritence was recieved by Mydia/Judge of Wings, who decimated all that remained of his progeny to ensure that her people would never learn the truth behind their patriarch.</p>
<a id="''Final_Fantasy_Tactics_A2:_Grimoire_of_the_Rift''" name="''Final_Fantasy_Tactics_A2:_Grimoire_of_the_Rift''"></a><h3>&#39;&#39;Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift&#39;&#39;</h3>
<p>The {{nihongo}} are a winged, humanoid race revealed for <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics_A2" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a></i>. The Gria are born with dragon-like wings and horns, and excel at physical combat.  The only Gria revealed so far have been female.</p>
<a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Prior to the events of <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></i>, the Fara church dominated the kingdom of Ivalice.<sup id="_ref-fara_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fara" title="">[44]</a></sup> The life of Ajora saw Fara replaced with the new Glabados church which, by the time of the game, is the one major religion of the kingdom. Glabados is <a href="/wiki/Monotheistic" id="w">monotheistic</a> and intensely political, underscoring much of Ivalice history. Followers of Glabados use the word Farlem (&#34;Faram&#34; in the original Japanese version of the game) to affirm their prayers.<sup id="_ref-Farlem_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Farlem" title="">[45]</a></sup> During the events of the game, the church is revealed to have put a large spin on history, particularly the events surrounding the life of Ajora.<sup id="_ref-fara_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fara" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Vagrant_Story" id="w">Vagrant Story</a></i>, the Iocus priesthood of the kingdom of Valendia is shown to use the Kildean rood as a symbol, although they follow the teachings of a saint named Iocus instead of the original Kildean teachings of the Kiltia religion of Leá Monde.<sup id="_ref-vagrantultimania_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vagrantultimania" title="">[46]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-rood_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rood" title="">[47]</a></sup> Müllenkamp, founder of the city of Leá Monde featured in the story, used to be a priestess of Kiltia,<sup id="_ref-vagrantultimania_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vagrantultimania" title="">[46]</a></sup> and bore the rood on her back.<sup id="_ref-rood_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rood" title="">[47]</a></sup> The followers of St. Iocus are outwardly intolerant of magic,<sup id="_ref-blackarts_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blackarts" title="">[48]</a></sup> seeing it as an abomination, and yet its higher members continue to use it behind the scenes.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> This hypocrisy is revealed over the course of the story, though it goes unresolved.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XII" id="w">Final Fantasy XII</a></i>, the Light of Kiltia, a <a href="/wiki/Polytheistic" id="w">polytheistic</a> religion, is the dominant church in Ivalice, having influence in the political affairs of the region around the Galtean Peninsula.<sup id="_ref-kiltiapolitics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiltiapolitics" title="">[50]</a></sup> Despite this, the church maintains an apolitical stance, with its most high-ranking officials banned from participating in political affairs altogether.<sup id="_ref-kiltia_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiltia" title="">[51]</a></sup> At its head is the Gran Kiltias, being the Helgas Anastasis at the time of <i>Final Fantasy XII</i>, until his death during the events of the story. Like Glabados followers in <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i>, Kiltias swear on the name of Faram, the Father of All, in the manner of the <a href="/wiki/Christian" id="w">Christian</a> <a href="/wiki/Amen" id="w">amen</a>.<sup id="_ref-Faram_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Faram" title="">[52]</a></sup> The <i>Final Fantasy XII Ultimania Ω</i> guide considers the Glabados Church a possible branch of Kiltia.<sup id="_ref-ult_omega_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ult_omega" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XII:_Revenant_Wings" id="w">Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings</a></i>, Feolthanos established a <a href="/wiki/Personality_cult" id="w">personality cult</a> over Lemurés, labeling himself to his people as a god. Though Lemurés still had a sense of peace and paradise, in spite of Yarhi attacks, it was a false paradise due to the Aurcite draining the Aegyl of their anima as part of Feolthanos&#39; plan to destory Ivalice as revenge against the Occurians.</p>
<a id="Mythology" name="Mythology"></a><h2>Mythology</h2>
<p>Within <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></i>, legends revolve around the <a href="/wiki/Zodiac" id="w">Zodiac</a> Brave Story, which deals with twelve knights who used the power of Zodiac Stones - magical stones engraved with symbols of the twelve Zodiac constellations - to fight against a demon summoned by an ambitious king to control Ivalice. This myth was twisted by the Glabados Church, as explained in the game&#39;s backstory, by including St. Ajora as the leader of the Zodiac Braves.</p>
<p>The Lucavi, conceptually based in part on a wish granting devil from feudal era mythology named Lucavi,{{Fact}} are demons linked to the twelve Zodiac Stones who seek to gain control of Ivalice by resurrecting their defeated leader, the Bloody Angel Altima. Any person who holds a Zodiac Stone may make a contract with the Lucavian demon associated with it, and in doing so, become one with that demon. During the events of the game, the Lucavi manipulate the Glabados Church into controlling the War of the Lions to ensure enough bloodshed for Altima&#39;s resurrection. A thirteenth Lucavi, associated with the sun constellation <a href="/wiki/Ophiuchus" id="w">Ophiuchus</a>, can also be found in a side-quest. Some of the Lucavi reappear as <a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_magic#Summoning magic" id="w">Totema</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics_Advance" id="w">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></i>, while a sub-boss, Gukko, becomes a &#34;Rukavi&#34; before his final encounter with the party, with an appearance similar to that of a vampire-type enemy.</p>
<p><i>Vagrant Story<b> centers around the </b>Dark<b>, a formless, invisible entity. In places where the Dark runs strongest, those who died will have their corpses controlled by the dark, becoming the <a href="/wiki/Zombie" id="w">undead</a>.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>. The Dark exists within a person as negative energy that unleashes the individual&#39;s latent power.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> Throughout the story, many individuals crave the powers of the Dark, which centers around the abandoned city of Leá Monde. Another mythological aspect of <i>Vagrant Story</i> is the Kiltia, an ancient cult which builts itself upon the Dark and ancient sorcery, and of which the Müllenkamp sect is stemmed from. It can be seen that most rituals and summoning performed in the game involved ancient Kildean magic.<sup id="_ref-ankildea_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ankildea" title="">[28]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p><i>Final Fantasy XII</i> also introduces the <b>Occuria</b>, immortal beings who have no visible faces, only a pair of glowing yellow eyes seen under their floating shell-like armor, surrounded by an aquamarine aura. The Occuria can become selectively invisible, and are also capable of possession, shape-shifting and image projection. Referred to by some as gods, but unknown to the main religions in Ivalice, the Occuria race played a central role in the history of Ivalice, controlling all major events, such as the rise of the Dynast-King Raithwall. Though peace fostered in Ivalice in the four-hundred year rule after Raithwall, the Occurian Venat, apparently disgusted with its kind&#39;s manupilations, rebelled and gave the secret of Nethicite to the Archadia&#39;s Dr. Cid and Vayne to overthrow the Occuria and make mankind the masters of their own fate. The events of the game eventually provoke the end the &#34;Age of Stones&#34;; the Occuria&#39;s control over Ivalice. In <i>Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings</i>, Occuria were revealed to had played a part in the sealing of the Purvama Lemurés long ago, which by present time became a land of legend that many Sky Pirates sought for its Auracite.</p>
<p><i>Revenant Wings</i> also introduced beings known as the <b>Yarhi</b>. Also known as <b>Espers</b> to those on Ivalice, they are powerful entities created from anima, spiritual energy. Through certain elements, such as Auracite or Mist, the Yarhi can assume physical form until they are defeated in battle. They are summoned by the wielders of Auracite and obey their every command. Fourteen such Yarhi appeared in <i>Final Fantasy XII</i>; the first thirteen being the Lucavi from <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i> which are referred as the &#34;Scions of darkness&#34;, magical beings created by Occuria with great strength and intelligence. Led by Ultima, they eventually rebelled for various reasons and engaged themselves in a war dubbed the Thousand Year War against the gods; but they were eventually defeated. Consequently, the gods bound their existence with the Glyph of the Beast, trapping them within the Mist. Any who controls the Glyph in turn controls the Scion, allowing them to operate as summoned creatures. The Fourteenth is the legendary swordman Gilgamesh, who collects the swords of those he defeats in battle. While most fight, few like Cu Sith and the Sahaguin Namingway offer aid in other ways.</p>
<a id="Reception_and_criticism" name="Reception_and_criticism"></a><h2>Reception and criticism</h2>
<p>{{Expand}}
The Ivalice of <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> is regarded as the Japanese version of the <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" id="w">Star Wars</a> galaxy by a Gamespot reviewer. Even with the established fantasy setting, the airships and air battles gives the world a science-fiction feel. Adding to the &#34;galaxy far, far away&#34; mood is the mingling of different races within large cities and the political unrest between the rebellion and the Empire. Because the characters majorly traverse on foot, the world of <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> feels vast, and reviewers enjoyed sightseeing because of the impressive visuals.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
