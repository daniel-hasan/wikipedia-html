<p><b>None More Black</b> was a <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a>-based melodic <a href="/wiki/Punk_rock" id="w">punk</a> outfit on <a href="/wiki/Fat_Wreck_Chords" id="w">Fat Wreck Chords</a>, formed by lead singer / guitarist <a href="/wiki/Jason_Shevchuk" id="w">Jason Shevchuk</a> after the demise of his previous band, <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" id="w">Philadelphia</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Kid_Dynamite" id="w">Kid Dynamite</a>. Jason left Kid Dynamite so that he could finish film school, and &#34;to sort some things out.&#34; While at school, Jason had written some songs and would play them with his roommate Dan and a drum machine. By 2000, they had a second guitarist and a real drummer. That lineup soon fell apart, but by 2001 Jason and Dan had recruited Jason&#39;s brother Jeff, along with a new drummer.  But after recording a 7&#34; for Sub Division Records, that lineup fell apart, this time leaving only Jeff and Jason. But finally in 2002 (after a few more lineup changes) a solid (or so it seemed) lineup was established, featuring Paul from Kill Your Idols on bass.  A demo was recorded, circulated, and the band went on to release their first full length on Fat Wreck Chords.  </p>
<p>The band&#39;s sound was unique. Their name originates from a line in <a href="/wiki/Mockumentary" id="w">mockumentary</a> movie <a href="/wiki/This_Is_Spinal_Tap" id="w">This Is Spinal Tap</a>. Several of the band&#39;s song titles are references to jokes from the television show <a href="/wiki/Seinfeld" id="w">Seinfeld</a>.</p>
<p>The band released two full-lengths and two EPs. Their most recent album, titled &#34;This is Satire&#34;, was released on May 2nd, 2006 by <a href="/wiki/Fat_Wreck_Chords" id="w">Fat Wreck Chords</a>.  </p>
<p>In January 2007 the band announced that they were going on a &#34;hiatus&#34; and that they would play shows every now and again.  There is no official explanation as to why the band has split.  Jason Shevchuk is currently working on a new project called LaGrecia.  Colin McGinniss and Paul Delaney decided to create a new hardcore/punk band called Ram and Ox. Paul Delaney also has current projects, Deathcycle and Black Anvil as well.</p>
