The <b>Kakapo</b> (<a href="/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language" id="w">Māori</a>: <b><i>kākāpō</i></b>, meaning <i>night parrot</i>), <i>Strigops habroptilus</i> (from the <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> <i>strix</i>, genitive <i>strigos</i>: owl and <i>ops</i>: face; and <i>habros</i>: soft, and <i>ptilon</i>: feather), also called <b>owl parrot</b>, is a <a href="/wiki/Species" id="w">species</a> of <a href="/wiki/Nocturnal_animal" id="w">nocturnal</a> <a href="/wiki/Parrot" id="w">parrot</a> with finely blotched yellow-green plumage <a href="/wiki/Endemism_in_birds" id="w">endemic</a> to <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a>.<sup id="_ref-Best1984_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best1984" title="">[1]</a></sup> It has a distinct facial disc of sensory, <a href="/wiki/Vibrissa" id="w">vibrissa-like</a> feathers, a large grey beak, short legs, large feet, and wings and a tail of relatively short length. A certain combination of traits makes it unique among its kind—it is the world&#39;s only flightless parrot, the heaviest parrot, nocturnal, herbivorous, it sports visible <a href="/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" id="w">sexual dimorphism</a> in body size, has a low <a href="/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate" id="w">basal metabolic rate</a>, no male parental care, and is the only parrot to have a <a href="/wiki/Polygyny" id="w">polygynous</a> <a href="/wiki/Lek_(mating_arena)" id="w">lek</a> breeding system. It is also possibly one of the world&#39;s longest-living birds.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup> Its anatomy typifies the tendency of bird evolution on oceanic islands with few predators and abundant food: accretion of <a href="/wiki/Thermodynamics" id="w">thermodynamic</a> efficiency at the expense of flight abilities, reduced wing muscles, a diminished <a href="/wiki/Keel_(bird)" id="w">keel</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Sternum" id="w">sternum</a>, a generally robust physique.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kakapo are critically endangered; only <a href="/wiki/List_of_Kakapo" id="w">86 living individuals are known</a>, all of which have been given names.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The ancestral Kakapo migrated to the islands of New Zealand in prehistory; in the absence of <a href="/wiki/Mammal" id="w">mammalian</a> predators, it lost the ability to fly. Because of Polynesian and European colonisation and the introduction of predators such as <a href="/wiki/Cat" id="w">cats</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rat" id="w">rats</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Stoat" id="w">stoats</a>, most of the Kakapo were wiped out. Conservation efforts began in the 1890s, but they were not very successful until the implementation of the Kakapo Recovery Plan in the 1980s. As of November 2005, surviving Kakapo are kept on four predator-free islands, <a href="/wiki/Maud_Island" id="w">Maud</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chalky_Island" id="w">Chalky (Te Kakahu)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Codfish_Island" id="w">Codfish (Whenua Hou)</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anchor_Island" id="w">Anchor</a> islands, where they are closely monitored.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup> Two large Fiordland islands, <a href="/wiki/Resolution_Island%2C_New_Zealand" id="w">Resolution</a> and <a href="/wiki/Secretary_Island" id="w">Secretary</a>, have been the subject of large-scale <a href="/wiki/Island_restoration" id="w">ecological restoration</a> activities to prepare self-sustaining <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" id="w">ecosystems</a> with suitable habitat for the Kakapo.</p>
<p>The conservation of the Kakapo has made the species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing the plight of the Kakapo have been produced in recent years, one of the earliest being <i>Two in the Bush</i>, made by <a href="/wiki/Gerald_Durrell" id="w">Gerald Durrell</a> for the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a> in <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a>.<sup id="_ref-GeraldDurrellBBC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GeraldDurrellBBC" title="">[4]</a></sup> Two of the most significant documentaries, both made by <a href="/wiki/NHNZ" id="w">NHNZ</a>, are <i>Kakapo - Night Parrot</i> (1982) and <i>To Save the Kakapo</i> (1997). The <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a>&#39;s Natural History Unit also featured the Kakapo, including a sequence with <a href="/wiki/Sir_David_Attenborough" id="w">Sir David Attenborough</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Life_of_Birds" id="w">The Life of Birds</a></i>. It was also one of the endangered animals that <a href="/wiki/Douglas_Adams" id="w">Douglas Adams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mark_Carwardine" id="w">Mark Carwardine</a> set out to find for the radio series and book <i><a href="/wiki/Last_Chance_to_See" id="w">Last Chance to See</a></i>.</p>
<p>The Kakapo, like many other bird species, has historically been important to the Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, appearing in many of the traditional legends and folklore.</p>

Kakapo are large, rotund parrots; males measure up to 60 <a href="/wiki/Metre#SI multiples" id="w">centimetres</a> (24&#160;in) and weigh between 2 and 4 <a href="/wiki/Kilogram" id="w">kilograms</a> (4.5–9&#160;lb) at maturity.<sup id="_ref-Higgins1999_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Higgins1999" title="">[5]</a></sup> Kakapo are unable to fly, having short <a href="/wiki/Wing" id="w">wings</a> for their size and lacking the pronounced keel bone (<a href="/wiki/Sternum" id="w">sternum</a>) that anchors the flight muscles of other birds. They use their wings for balance, support, and to break their falls when leaping from trees. Unlike other land birds, Kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body <a href="/wiki/Fat" id="w">fat</a> to store energy making them the heaviest parrot.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The upper parts of the Kakapo have yellowish moss-green <a href="/wiki/Feather" id="w">feathers</a> barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey, blending well with native <a href="/wiki/Vegetation" id="w">vegetation</a>.
Individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity — museum specimens have shown that some birds had completely yellow colouring. The breast and flanks are yellowish-green streaked with yellow. Their bellies, undertail, necks and faces are predominantly yellowish, streaked with pale green and weakly mottled with brownish-grey. Because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight, they are exceptionally soft, giving rise to the <a href="/wiki/Specific_epithet" id="w">specific epithet</a> <i>habroptilus</i>. Kakapo have a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers, resembling the face of an <a href="/wiki/Owl" id="w">owl</a>; thus, early European settlers called it the &#34;owl parrot&#34;. Their beaks are surrounded by delicate <a href="/wiki/Vibrissa" id="w">vibrissa</a> or &#34;whiskers&#34;, which they use to sense the ground for navigation as they walk with their heads lowered. The mandible is mostly ivory-colored, with part of the upper mandible being bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown. Kakapo feet are large, scaly, and, as in all parrots, <a href="/wiki/Dactyly" id="w">zygodactyl</a> (two toes face forward and two backward). They have pronounced claws particularly useful for climbing. The ends of their tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Strigops_habroptilus%2C_face.jpg" title="The &#34;whiskers&#34; around the beak"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strigops_habroptilus%2C_face.jpg" alt="The &#34;whiskers&#34; around the beak" title="The &#34;whiskers&#34; around the beak" class="location-none type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The &#34;whiskers&#34; around the beak</div>
Females are easily distinguished from males due to some notable differences: they have a more narrow and less domed head, their beaks are narrower and proportionally longer, their ceres and nostrils smaller, their legs and feet more slender and pinkish grey, and their tails are proportionally longer. While their plumage color is not very different to that of males, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to be more resistant and aggressive than males when handled. Nesting females are also distinguished by a brood-patch on the bare skin of the belly.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Like many parrots, Kakapo have a variety of calls. In addition to the <i>booms</i> (see <a href="/wiki/Kakapo#Media" id="w">below</a> for a recording) and <i>chings</i> of their mating calls, they often <i>skraark</i> to announce their location to other birds. </p>
<p>Kakapo have a well-developed sense of smell, which complements their nocturnal lifestyle.<sup id="_ref-Hagelin04_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hagelin04" title="">[6]</a></sup> They can discriminate among odours while foraging; a behaviour reported for only one other parrot species.<sup id="_ref-Hagelin04_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hagelin04" title="">[6]</a></sup>  One of the most striking characteristics of Kakapo is their pleasant and powerful odour, which has been variously described as musty, honey-like, fruity or like <a href="/wiki/Air_freshener" id="w">air freshener</a>{{Fact}}. Given the Kakapo&#39;s well-developed <a href="/wiki/Olfaction" id="w">sense of smell</a>, this scent may be a social <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Chemosignal">chemosignal</a>. The smell often alerts <a href="/wiki/Predator" id="w">predators</a> to the largely defenseless Kakapo.</p>
<a id="Classification" name="Classification"></a><h2> Classification </h2>
<p>The Kakapo has so many unusual features that it was initially placed in its own family, Strigopidae. However, it is now recognised as a member of the parrot family, <a href="/wiki/Psittacidae" id="w">Psittacidae</a>. Its distinctiveness is highlighted by its classification in its own <a href="/wiki/Genus" id="w">genus</a>, <i>Strigops</i>; and <a href="/wiki/Tribe_(biology)" id="w">tribe</a>, Strigopini, in the <a href="/wiki/Subfamily" id="w">subfamily</a> <a href="/wiki/Psittacinae" id="w">Psittacinae</a>. Some maintain the Kakapo in a subfamily of its own, Strigopinae.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Earlier ornithologists felt the Kakapo may be related to the <a href="/wiki/Ground_Parrot" id="w">Ground Parrot</a> and <a href="/wiki/Night_Parrot" id="w">Night Parrot</a> of Australia; others pointed to the <a href="/wiki/Nestor_(genus)" id="w">Nestorini</a> tribe.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> A 2005 <a href="/wiki/ZW_sex-determination_system" id="w">sex chromosome</a> <a href="/wiki/Spindlin" id="w">spindlin</a> <a href="/wiki/DNA_sequence" id="w">DNA sequence</a> study confirmed affinities with the genus <i>Nestor</i>, which contains the <a href="/wiki/K%C4%81k%C4%81" id="w">Kākā</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Kea" id="w">Kea</a>. The molecular data further suggests that the two <i>Nestor</i> species, and the Kakapo in its own genus, comprise an ancient group that split off from all other <a href="/wiki/Psittacidae" id="w">Psittacidae</a> before their radiation,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> but <a href="/wiki/Fossil" id="w">fossil</a> evidence seems to contradict this{{Fact}}; given the violent geological history of New Zealand (see, for example, <a href="/wiki/Taupo_Volcanic_Zone" id="w">Taupo Volcanic Zone</a>), other explanations such as episodes of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_drift" id="w">genetic drift</a> seem better supported by evidence.</p>

Historic distribution of the Kakapo.</div></div>

The only mammals native to New Zealand are three species of small <a href="/wiki/Bat" id="w">bats</a> (one extinct). It seems that the Kakapo — like many of New Zealand&#39;s bird species — has <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolved</a> to occupy an <a href="/wiki/Ecological_niche" id="w">ecological niche</a> normally filled by various species of mammal. Before the arrival of humans, Kakapo were largely distributed throughout the three main islands of New Zealand. They lived in a variety of habitats, including <a href="/wiki/Tussock_grass" id="w">tussocklands</a>, scrublands and coastal areas. They also inhabited forests, including those dominated by <a href="/wiki/Podocarpaceae" id="w">podocarps</a> (<a href="/wiki/Dacrydium_cupressinum" id="w">rimu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prumnopitys_taxifolia" id="w">matai</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dacrycarpus_dacrydioides" id="w">kahikatea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Podocarpus_totara" id="w">totara</a>), <a href="/wiki/Nothofagus" id="w">beeches</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tawa_(tree)" id="w">tawa</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Metrosideros_umbellata" id="w">rata</a>. They particularly favored forest margins and areas of regenerating forest for the wider variety of vegetation in a compact area{{Fact}} . In <a href="/wiki/Fiordland" id="w">Fiordland</a>, areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation — such as five finger, <a href="/wiki/Aristotelia_serrata" id="w">wineberry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bush_lawyer_(plant)" id="w">bush lawyer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tutu_(plant)" id="w">tutu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hebe_(plant)" id="w">hebes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Coprosma" id="w">coprosmas</a> — became known as &#34;Kakapo gardens&#34;{{Fact}} .</p>
<p>Kakapo are primarily nocturnal; they roost under cover in trees or on the ground during the day and rove their territories at night.<sup id="_ref-Best1984_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best1984" title="">[1]</a></sup> Though the Kakapo cannot fly, they are excellent climbers, ascending to the crowns of the tallest trees. They can also &#34;parachute&#34; from heights by spreading their wings, floating gently to the forest floor{{Fact}}. Having lost the ability to fly, they have developed strong legs. Movement is often by way of a rapid &#34;jog-like&#34; gait by which they can move many kilometres.<sup id="_ref-Higgins1999_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Higgins1999" title="">[5]</a></sup> Females make two return trips each night during nesting from their nest to the food source up to 1&#160;km (0.5&#160;miles) away<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> and males walk from their home ranges to the mating arena up to 5&#160;km (3&#160;miles) away during the mating season (October&#8211;January).<sup id="_ref-Best1985_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best1985" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kakapo are a curious species and have been known to interact with humans. Conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some Kakapo, and they are known to have distinct personalities.</p>
<p>One behaviour that has not recently served the Kakapo well is their reaction to threats. When Kakapo feel threatened, they freeze, hoping to blend in with the vegetation that they resemble. This was a good strategy to foil their main native predator, the giant <a href="/wiki/Haast%26%2339%3Bs_Eagle" id="w">Haast&#39;s Eagle</a>. However, it does not protect them from their new mammalian predators (feral cats and dogs), which rely on an excellent sense of smell. A typical way for humans to hunt down Kakapo is by releasing trained dogs.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Diet" name="Diet"></a><h2>Diet</h2>
<p>The beak of the Kakapo is specially adapted for grinding food finely. For this reason, Kakapo have very small <a href="/wiki/Gizzard" id="w">gizzards</a> compared to other birds of their size. They are generally <a href="/wiki/Herbivore" id="w">herbivorous</a>, eating native <a href="/wiki/Plant" id="w">plants</a>, <a href="/wiki/Seed" id="w">seeds</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fruit" id="w">fruits</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pollen" id="w">pollens</a> and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as Kakapo food.<sup id="_ref-Best1984_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best1984" title="">[1]</a></sup> They are particularly fond of the fruit of the <a href="/wiki/Dacrydium_cupressinum" id="w">rimu</a> tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. Kakapo have a distinctive habit of grabbing a leaf or frond with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with their beaks, leaving a ball of indigestible fiber. These little clumps of plant fibers are a distinctive sign of the presence of Kakapo.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Kakapos are believed to employ bacteria in the foregut to ferment and help digest plant matter.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kakapo diet changes seasonally. The plants eaten most frequently during the year include some species of <i>Lycopodium ramulosum</i>, <i>Lycopodium fastigium</i>, <i>Schizaea fistulosa</i>, <i>Blechnum minus</i>, <i>Blechnum procerum</i>, <i>Cyathodes juniperina</i>, <i>Dracophyllum longifolium</i>, <i>Olearia colensoi</i> and <i>Thelymitra venosa</i>. Individual plants of the same species are often treated differently. Kakapo leave conspicuous evidence of their feeding activities, from 10&#215;10&#160;m to 50&#215;100&#160;m feeding ground areas.<sup id="_ref-Best1984_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best1984" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Leptospermum_scoparium" id="w">Manuka</a> and yellow silver pine scrubs are obvious signs of their center of feeding activities.</p>

Kakapo are the only parrots in the world that have a <a href="/wiki/Lek_(mating_arena)" id="w">lek</a> breeding system.<sup id="_ref-Merton1984_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Merton1984" title="">[16]</a></sup> Males loosely gather in an arena and compete with each other to attract females. Females watch the males display, or &#34;lek&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Merton77_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Merton77" title="">[17]</a></sup> They choose a mate based on the quality of his display; they are not pursued by the males in any overt way. No pair bond is formed; males and females meet only to mate. </p>
<p>During the courting season, males leave their home ranges for hilltops and <a href="/wiki/Ridge" id="w">ridges</a> where they establish their own mating courts. These leks can be up to 7&#160;kilometres (4&#160;mi) from a Kakapo&#39;s usual territory and are an average of 50&#160;metres (160&#160;ft) apart within the lek arena. Males remain in the region of their court throughout the courting season. At the start of the breeding season, males will fight to try to secure the best courts. They confront each other with raised feathers, spread wings, open beaks, raised claws and loud screeching and growling. Fighting may leave birds with injuries.</p>
<p>Each court consists of bowl-like depressions dug in the ground by the male, up to 10&#160;centimetres (4&#160;in) deep and long enough to fit the half-metre length of the bird. Bowls are often created next to rock faces, banks, or tree trunks to help reflect sound.<sup id="_ref-Merton1984_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Merton1984" title="">[16]</a></sup> Each male’s bowls are connected by a network of <a href="/wiki/Trail" id="w">trails</a> or tracks which may extend 50 metres (160&#160;ft) along a ridge or 20 metres (60&#160;ft) in diameter around a hilltop.<sup id="_ref-Merton1984_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Merton1984" title="">[16]</a></sup> Males meticulously clear their bowls and tracks of debris. One way researchers check whether bowls are visited at night is to place a few twigs in the bowl; if the male visits overnight, he will pick them up in his beak and toss them away. </p>
<p>To attract females, males make loud, low-frequency (below 100&#160;<a href="/wiki/Hertz" id="w">Hz</a>) booming calls from their bowls by inflating a <a href="/wiki/Thorax" id="w">thoracic</a> sac.<sup id="_ref-Higgins1999_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Higgins1999" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Cockrem2002_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cockrem2002" title="">[18]</a></sup> They start with low grunts, which increase in volume as the sac inflates. After a sequence of about 20 loud booms, the volume drops off. The male Kakapo then stands up for a short while before again lowering his head, inflating his chest and starting another sequence of booms. The booms can be heard at least one kilometre (0.6&#160;mi) away on a still night; wind can carry the sound at least five kilometres (3&#160;mi).<sup id="_ref-Merton1984_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Merton1984" title="">[16]</a></sup> Males boom for an average of eight hours a night; each male may produce thousands of booms in this time. This may continue every night for three or four months during which time the male may lose half his body weight. Each male moves around the bowls in his court so that the booms are sent out in different directions.</p>
<p>Females are attracted by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court of one of the males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup> He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. The duration of attempted copulation is between 2 to 14&#160;minutes.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup> Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.</p>
<p>Female Kakapo lay up to three <a href="/wiki/Ovum" id="w">eggs</a> per breeding cycle.<sup id="_ref-Cockrem2002_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cockrem2002" title="">[18]</a></sup> They nest on the ground under the cover of plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. They incubate the eggs faithfully, but are forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also freeze to death in the mother&#39;s absence. Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30&#160;days,<sup id="_ref-Easton2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Easton2006" title="">[19]</a></sup> bearing fluffy gray chicks that are quite helpless. After the eggs hatch, the female feeds the chicks for three months, and the chicks continue to remain with the female for some months after <a href="/wiki/Fledge" id="w">fledging</a>.<sup id="_ref-Cockrem2002_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cockrem2002" title="">[18]</a></sup> The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12&#160;weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 6&#160;months.</p>
<p>Because Kakapo are quite long-lived, they tend to have an adolescence before beginning breeding. Males do not start to boom until about 5&#160;years of age.<sup id="_ref-Higgins1999_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Higgins1999" title="">[5]</a></sup> Females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old.<sup id="_ref-Easton2006_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Easton2006" title="">[19]</a></sup> This long delay before they start to reproduce leaves plenty of time to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Perpetuate">perpetuate</a> the species. Kakapo do not breed every year and have one of the lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. <a href="/wiki/Dacrydium_cupressinum" id="w">Rimu</a> mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island, Kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Conservation" name="Conservation"></a><h1> Conservation </h1>
<p>The population of Kakapo in New Zealand has been significantly reduced since human habitation of the country. Since 1891, conservation efforts have been attempted to prevent extinction. The most successful scheme has been the Kakapo Recovery Plan; this was implemented in 1989 and is still ongoing.</p>

<p>The first factor in the decline of the Kakapo was the arrival of humans. According to <a href="/wiki/M%C4%81ori" id="w">Māori</a> folklore, Kakapo were found throughout the country when the <a href="/wiki/Polynesian" id="w">Polynesians</a> first arrived in <a href="/wiki/Aotearoa" id="w">Aotearoa</a> 1,000 years ago;<sup id="_ref-Tipa2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tipa2006" title="">[21]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Subfossil" id="w">subfossil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Midden" id="w">midden</a> deposits show that they were present throughout the North island, South island and Stewart island before and during early Māori times.<sup id="_ref-FGNZB_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FGNZB" title="">[22]</a></sup> Māori settlers from <a href="/wiki/Polynesia" id="w">Polynesia</a> hunted the Kakapo for food and for their skins and feathers, which were made into luxurious <a href="/wiki/Cape" id="w">capes</a>.<sup id="_ref-Tipa2006_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tipa2006" title="">[21]</a></sup> They used the dried heads as ear ornaments. Due to its flightlessness, strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened, the Kakapo were easy prey for the Māori and their dogs. Their eggs and chicks were also predated by the <a href="/wiki/Polynesian_Rat" id="w">Polynesian Rat</a> or kiore, which the Māori brought to New Zealand.<sup id="_ref-Merton77_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Merton77" title="">[17]</a></sup> Furthermore, the deliberate clearing of vegetation by Māori reduced the habitable range for Kakapo. Although the Kakapo were extinct in many parts of the islands by the time Europeans arrived,<sup id="_ref-Williams1956_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Williams1956" title="">[23]</a></sup> including the <a href="/wiki/Tararua_Ranges" id="w">Tararua</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aorangi_Range" id="w">Aorangi Ranges</a>,<sup id="_ref-FLM_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FLM" title="">[24]</a></sup> they were still present in the central part of North island and forested parts of South island.<sup id="_ref-FGNZB_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FGNZB" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>From the 1840s, European settlers cleared vast tracts of land for <a href="/wiki/Farming" id="w">farming</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grazing" id="w">grazing</a>, further jeopardising the Kakapo and their habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and stoats.<sup id="_ref-Sutherland2002_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sutherland2002" title="">[25]</a></sup> Europeans knew little of the Kakapo until <a href="/wiki/George_Robert_Gray" id="w">George Gray</a> of the <a href="/wiki/British_Museum" id="w">British Museum</a> described it from a skin in 1845. As the Māori had done, early European explorers and their dogs fed on Kakapo. In the late 1800s, Kakapo became well-known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the Kakapo population was declining; their prime concern was to collect as many as possible before they became extinct. </p>
<p>In the 1880s, large numbers of <a href="/wiki/Mustelidae" id="w">mustelids</a> (<a href="/wiki/Stoat" id="w">stoats</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ferret" id="w">ferrets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Weasel" id="w">weasels</a>) were released in New Zealand to reduce <a href="/wiki/Rabbit" id="w">rabbit</a> numbers,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> but they also preyed heavily on many native species including the Kakapo. Other browsing animals, such as introduced <a href="/wiki/Deer" id="w">deer</a>, competed with Kakapo for food, and caused the extinction of some of its preferred plant species. Kakapo were reportedly still present near the head of the <a href="/wiki/Whanganui_River" id="w">Whanganui River</a> as late as 1894, with one of the last records of a Kakapo in the North Island being a single bird caught in the <a href="/wiki/Kaimanawa_Range" id="w">Kaimanawa Ranges</a> by one Te Kepa Puawheawhe in 1895.<sup id="_ref-FLM_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FLM" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

In 1891, the New Zealand government set aside <a href="/wiki/Resolution_Island%2C_New_Zealand" id="w">Resolution Island</a> in Fiordland as a nature reserve; in 1894, the government appointed <a href="/wiki/Richard_Treacy_Henry" id="w">Richard Henry</a> as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry was aware that native birds were declining, and began catching and moving Kakapo and <a href="/wiki/Kiwi" id="w">kiwi</a> from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 Kakapo to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, stoats had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out this nascent Kakapo population within 6 years.<sup id="_ref-Hill1987_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hill1987" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1903, three Kakapo were moved from Resolution Island to the nature reserve of <a href="/wiki/Hauturu/Little_Barrier_Island" id="w">Hauturu/Little Barrier Island</a> north-east of <a href="/wiki/Auckland" id="w">Auckland</a>, but <a href="/wiki/Feral_cats" id="w">feral cats</a> were present and the Kakapo were never seen again. In 1912, three Kakapo were moved to another reserve, <a href="/wiki/Kapiti_Island" id="w">Kapiti Island</a>, north-west of <a href="/wiki/Wellington" id="w">Wellington</a>. One of them survived until at least 1936, despite the presence of feral cats for part of the intervening period.<sup id="_ref-Hill1987_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hill1987" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the 1920s, the Kakapo were extinct on the <a href="/wiki/North_Island" id="w">North Island</a> and their range and numbers on the <a href="/wiki/South_Island" id="w">South Island</a> were declining.<sup id="_ref-Williams1956_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Williams1956" title="">[23]</a></sup> One of their last refuges was rugged Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, they were often seen or heard, and occasionally eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of Kakapo were becoming scarce.</p>
<a id="1950%E2%80%931989_conservation_efforts" name="1950%E2%80%931989_conservation_efforts"></a><h2>1950–1989 conservation efforts</h2>
<p>In the 1950s, the New Zealand Wildlife Service was established and began making regular expeditions to search for Kakapo, mostly in Fiordland and what is now the <a href="/wiki/Kahurangi_National_Park" id="w">Kahurangi National Park</a> in the northwest of the South Island. Seven Fiordland expeditions between 1951 and 1956 found only a few recent signs. Finally, in 1958 a Kakapo was caught and released in the <a href="/wiki/Milford_Sound" id="w">Milford Sound</a> catchment area in Fiordland. Six more Kakapo were captured in 1961; one was released and the other five were transferred to the <a href="/wiki/Aviary" id="w">aviaries</a> of the Mount Bruce Bird Reserve near <a href="/wiki/Masterton" id="w">Masterton</a> in the North Island. Within months, four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years. In the next 12 years, regular expeditions found few signs of Kakapo, indicating that numbers were continuing to decline. Only one bird was captured in 1967; it died the following year.</p>
<p>By the early 1970s, it was uncertain whether Kakapo was still an extant species. At the end of 1974, scientists located several more male Kakapo and made the first scientific observations of Kakapo booming. These observations led <a href="/wiki/Don_Merton" id="w">Don Merton</a> to speculate for the first time that Kakapo had a lek breeding system.<sup id="_ref-Merton77_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Merton77" title="">[17]</a></sup> From 1974 to 1976, 14 Kakapo were discovered but all appeared to be males. One male bird was captured in the Milford area in 1975, christened &#34;Richard Henry&#34;, and transferred to <a href="/wiki/Maud_Island" id="w">Maud Island</a>. This raised the possibility that all the females had died and that the species was functionally <a href="/wiki/Extinct" id="w">extinct</a>. All the birds the Wildlife Service discovered from 1951 to 1976 were in U-shaped <a href="/wiki/Glaciated_valley" id="w">glaciated valleys</a> flanked by almost-vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains. Such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals, leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation. However, even here, stoats were present and by 1976 Kakapo were gone from the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Prior to 1977, no expedition had been to Stewart Island/Rakiura, despite government workers seeing a Kakapo there and snatching feathers from it in 1949{{Fact}}. In 1977, sightings of Kakapo were reported on Stewart Island.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup> An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen Kakapo. The finding in an 8,000 ha area of fire-modified <a href="/wiki/Scrubland" id="w">scrubland</a> and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Mustelid" id="w">Mustelids</a> have never colonised Steward Island/Rakiura, but <a href="/wiki/Feral_cat" id="w">feral cats</a> were present.

<p>In 1989, a Kakapo Recovery Plan was developed and a Kakapo Recovery Group established to implement it.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> The New Zealand&#39;s Department of Conservation replaced the Wildlife Service for this task. The first action of the plan was to relocate all the remaining Kakapo to suitable islands for them to breed. None of the New Zealand islands were ideal to establish Kakapo without <a href="/wiki/Island_restoration" id="w">rehabilitation</a> by extensive revegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors. Four islands were finally chosen: <a href="/wiki/Maud_Island" id="w">Maud</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hauturu/Little_Barrier_Island" id="w">Hauturu/Little Barrier</a>, <a href="/wiki/Codfish_Island" id="w">Codfish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mana_Island%2C_New_Zealand" id="w">Mana</a>.<sup id="_ref-Lloyd1994_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lloyd1994" title="">[30]</a></sup> Some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats, stoats and <a href="/wiki/Weka" id="w">weka</a> kept appearing. Sixty-five Kakapo (43 males, 22 females) have been successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations.<sup id="_ref-Lloyd1994_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lloyd1994" title="">[30]</a></sup> As of November 2005, Hauturu/Little Barrier Island and Mana Island were replaced with <a href="/wiki/Chalky_Island" id="w">Chalky Island (Te Kakahu)</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anchor_Island" id="w">Anchor Island</a> as Kakapo sanctuaries.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Following the implementation of the Kakapo Recovery Plan, Kakapo numbers have generally increased.</div></div>

A key part of the Recovery Plan is the supplementary feeding of females. Kakapo breed only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily <a href="/wiki/Dacrydium_cupressinum" id="w">&#39;&#39;Dacrydium cupressinum&#39;&#39; (rimu)</a>, produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Mast_year" id="w">mast year</a> help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase Kakapo breeding frequency.<sup id="_ref-Elliott2001_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Elliott2001" title="">[32]</a></sup> In 1989, six preferred foods (<a href="/wiki/Apple" id="w">apples</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sweet_potato" id="w">sweet potatoes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Almond" id="w">almonds</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brazil_nut" id="w">brazil nuts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sunflower_seed" id="w">sunflower seeds</a> and <a href="/wiki/Walnut" id="w">walnuts</a>) were supplied <i><a href="/wiki/Ad_libitum" id="w">ad libitum</a></i> each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989&#8211;91 for the first time since 1982, although nesting success was low.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Supplementary feeding not only increases the Kakapo breeding frequency, but also affects the <a href="/wiki/Sex_ratio" id="w">sex ratio</a> of Kakapo offspring.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Females fed protein-rich foods produce more male-biased offspring (males have 30–40% more body weight than females). Females produce bias offsprings towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and to the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful; a female Kakapo will likely be able to produce eggs, even when there are few resources, while a male Kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This finding was subsequently used to increase the number of female chicks by deliberately manipulating maternal condition.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> During the winter of 1981, only females below 1.5&#160;kg weight were given supplementary feeding to avoid raising their body condition, and the sex ratio results in 1982 were close to parity, eliminating the male-biased sex ratios in the unrestricted feeding.</p>
<p>Though breeding can be improved by supplementary feeding, the survival of young Kakapo is hampered by the presence of Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats.<sup id="_ref-Elliott2001_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Elliott2001" title="">[32]</a></sup> Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using <a href="/wiki/Rat_trap" id="w">traps</a> and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and <a href="/wiki/Infrared" id="w">infra-red light source</a> watch the nest continuously, which will remotely scare approaching rats by small bang and flash lights. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.<sup id="_ref-Elliott2001_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Elliott2001" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>To monitor the Kakapo population continuously, each bird is equipped with a <a href="/wiki/Radio_transmitter" id="w">radio transmitter</a>.<sup id="_ref-Elliott2001_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Elliott2001" title="">[32]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/List_of_Kakapo" id="w">Every known Kakapo has been given a name</a> by Kakapo Recovery Programme officials. It is an affectionate way for conservation staff to refer to individual birds, and a stark reminder of how few remain. <a href="/wiki/Artificial_insemination" id="w">Artificial incubation</a> of eggs and hand-raising of chicks interventions were often used to strengthen conditions of the eggs and the chicks.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> As of November 2005, the population comprised 41 females and 45 males, including four fledging (3 females and 1 male) bred in 2005.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup> The oldest surviving Kakapo, &#34;Richard Henry&#34;, is thought to be between 35 and 50 years old.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Kakapo Recovery Plan has been a successful program as the numbers of Kakapo increase steadily. The adult survival rate and their productivity have both improved significantly since the programme&#39;s inception. However, the main goal is to establish at least one viable, self-sustaining, unmanaged population of Kakapo as a functional component of the <a href="/wiki/Ecosystem" id="w">ecosystem</a> in a protected habitat.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> To accept this conservation challenge, two large Fiordland islands, <a href="/wiki/Resolution_Island%2C_New_Zealand" id="w">Resolution</a> (20,860&#160;ha) and <a href="/wiki/Secretary_Island" id="w">Secretary</a> (8,140&#160;ha), have been prepared for re-introduction of Kakapo with large-scale ecological restoration activities.<sup id="_ref-Powlesland2006_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Powlesland2006" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="In_M%C4%81ori_culture" name="In_M%C4%81ori_culture"></a><h1>In Māori culture</h1>
<p>The Kakapo has a rich tradition of <a href="/wiki/M%C4%81ori" id="w">Māori</a> folklore and beliefs associated with it as a species. Their irregular breeding cycle was noted to be associated with heavy fruiting or &#34;<a href="/wiki/Mast_year" id="w">masting</a>&#34; events of particular plant species such as the <a href="/wiki/Dacrydium_cupressinum" id="w">Rimu</a> which led the Māori to credit the bird with the ability to foretell the future.<sup id="_ref-MBL_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBL" title="">[39]</a></sup> 
Used to substantiate this claim were reported observations of these birds dropping the berries of the <a href="/wiki/Hinau" id="w">Hinau</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tawa" id="w">Tawa</a> trees (when they were in season) into secluded pools of water to preserve them as a food supply for the summer ahead; the Māori practice of immersing food in water for the same purpose is believed to originate from these observations.<sup id="_ref-MBL_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBL" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>

<p>In breeding years, the loud booming calls of the males at their <a href="/wiki/Lek_(mating_arena)" id="w">mating arenas</a> made it easy for Māori hunting parties to track them down, and they were also hunted while feeding or when having dust baths in dry weather.

<p>As well as eating the meat of the Kakapo they killed, Māori would use Kakapo skins — with the feathers still attached — to create cloaks and capes.<sup id="_ref-WS_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WS" title="">[41]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-KM_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KM" title="">[42]</a></sup>  Each one required up to 11,000 feathers to make.<sup id="_ref-WNZB?_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WNZB?" title="">[43]</a></sup> Not only were these garments very beautiful, they also kept the wearer very warm.<sup id="_ref-WNZB?_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WNZB?" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-WS_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WS" title="">[41]</a></sup> They were highly valued, and the few still in existence today are considered <i><a href="/wiki/Taonga" id="w">Taonga</a></i> (treasures) — indeed, the old Māori adage &#34;You have a Kākāpō cape and you still complain of the cold&#34; is used to describe someone who is never satisfied.<sup id="_ref-WS_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WS" title="">[41]</a></sup> Kakapo feathers were also used to decorate the heads of <a href="/wiki/Taiaha" id="w">taiaha</a>, but were removed before actual use in combat.<sup id="_ref-OS_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OS" title="">[40]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-KM_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KM" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-WNZB?_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WNZB?" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite all, the Kakapo was also regarded as an affectionate <a href="/wiki/Pet" id="w">pet</a> by the Māori. This was corroborated by European settlers in New Zealand in the 19th century, among them <a href="/wiki/George_Edward_Grey" id="w">George Edward Grey</a>, who once wrote in a letter to an associate that his pet Kakapo&#39;s behavior towards him and his friends was &#34;more like that of a dog than a bird&#34;.<sup id="_ref-MBL_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MBL" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
