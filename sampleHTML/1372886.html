<p><b>Edward Matthew Ward</b> (<a href="/wiki/July_14" id="w">July 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1816" id="w">1816</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/January_15" id="w">January 15</a>, <a href="/wiki/1879" id="w">1879</a>) was an <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era" id="w">Victorian</a> narrative painter best known for his murals in the <a href="/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster" id="w">Palace of Westminster</a> depicting episodes in British history from the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" id="w">English Civil War</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Glorious_Revolution" id="w">Glorious Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>Ward was born in <a href="/wiki/Pimlico" id="w">Pimlico</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>. As a student at the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Arts" id="w">Royal Academy of Arts</a> Ward became a member of <a href="/wiki/The_Clique" id="w">The Clique</a>, a group of painters led by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Dadd" id="w">Richard Dadd</a>. Like other members of the Clique Ward saw himself as a follower of <a href="/wiki/Hogarth" id="w">Hogarth</a> and <a href="/wiki/David_Wilkie_(artist)" id="w">Wilkie</a>, considering their styles to be distinctly national in character. Many of his early paintings were set in the <a href="/wiki/Eighteenth_century" id="w">eighteenth century</a> and were on Hogarthian subjects. He also painted episodes from <a href="/wiki/Seventeenth_century" id="w">seventeenth century</a> history, influenced by the thinking of his friend, the historian <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Babington_Macaulay" id="w">Thomas Babington Macaulay</a>. He also painted subjects from the history of the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" id="w">French Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1850s Ward came into conflict with the <a href="/wiki/Pre-Raphaelites" id="w">Pre-Raphaelites</a>, especially <a href="/wiki/Millais" id="w">Millais</a>, whose style of art he considered to be un-British. Ward&#39;s painting of <a href="/wiki/Charlotte_Corday" id="w">Charlotte Corday</a> being led to execution beat Millais&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ophelia_(painting)" id="w">Ophelia</a> for a prize at Liverpool, leading to much debate at the time.</p>
<p>Such historical paintings led to Ward&#39;s commission to paint eight scenes in the corridor leading into the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons" id="w">House of Commons</a>. These were to depict parallel episodes on the <a href="/wiki/Cavaliers_(royalists)" id="w">Royalist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary" id="w">Parliamentary</a> sides in the Civil War. Ward&#39;s paintings depict the opposed figures as if confronting one another across the corridor.</p>
<p>Ward continued to paint Hogarthian versions of episodes from British history throughout the 1860s, notably <i>Hogarth&#39;s Studio in 1739</i> (1863, <a href="/wiki/York_City_Art_Gallery" id="w">York City Art Gallery</a>) the <i>Antechamber at Whitehall During the Dying Moments of Charles II</i> (1865, <a href="/wiki/Walker_Art_Gallery" id="w">Walker Art Gallery</a>, Liverpool). In the 1870s he painted some modern-life genre subjects, but towards the end of the decade began to suffer painful illness and depression, resulting in his suicide in 1879.</p>
<p>His wife <a href="/wiki/Henrietta_Ward" id="w">Henrietta Ward</a> was also a painter. After her husband&#39;s death she became a successful art teacher. His son <a href="/wiki/Leslie_Ward" id="w">Leslie Ward</a> became a popular <a href="/wiki/Caricature" id="w">caricaturist</a> for the magazine <a href="/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" id="w">Vanity Fair</a> under the nickname &#39;Spy&#39;.</p>
