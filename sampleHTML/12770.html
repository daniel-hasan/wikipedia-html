Geography is the study of the world, its surface features, and of the distribution of life on Earth, including human life and the effects of human activity. Geography is a diverse field and has two main branches, human geography and physical geography, that seek to understand the world and all of its human and natural complexities &amp;mdash; not just where objects are, but how they came to be, and how they have changed over time.

The following list of topics is provided as an overview of and introduction to geography:

Branches of geography

Geography is divided into two main branches: physical geography and human geography. Each of these branches is divided into a number of subfields:;

Geography by region or location
: ''Main articles: Region, Subregions, Location, and Lists of places''
''Regions'' are areas, and can be defined by physical characteristics, human characteristics, and functional characteristics. The term is used in various ways among the different branches of geography. A region can be seen as a collection of smaller units, such as a country and its political divisions, or as one part of a larger whole, as in a country on a continent.Concepts concerning location or place:



* Atlas
* Climate
* Distance decay
* First law of geography
* Geocode
* Location
** Absolute location
*** Latitude
**** Prime meridian
*** Longitude
**** Equator
**** Tropic of Cancer
**** Tropic of Capricorn
** Relative location

* Population
** Demographics
** Population Density
** Overpopulation
** World population
* Sense of place
* Terrain
* Topography
* Tourist attraction

= Regions of the world=

''Regional geography'' is a branch of geography that studies the regions of all sizes across the Earth. It has a prevailing descriptive character. The main aim is to understand or define the uniqueness or character of a particular region which consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to regionalization which covers the proper techniques of space delimitation into regions.

The Continents


A ''continent'' is one of several large landmasses on Earth.They are generally identified by convention rather than any specific criteria, but seven areas are commonly regarded as continents. They are:
Earth may have had a single supercontinent called &quot;Pangaea&quot;

::''1.'' Africa
::''2.'' Antarctica
::''3.'' Australia
:The Americas:
::''4.'' North America
::''5.'' South America
:Eurasia:
::''6.'' Europe
::''7.'' Asia

= Ecozone=

The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) developed a system of eight biogeographic realms (ecozones):
* Nearctic 22.9 mil. km² (including most of North America)
* Palearctic 54.1 mil. km² (including the bulk of Eurasia and North Africa)
* Afrotropic 22.1 mil. km² (including Sub-Saharan Africa)
* Indomalaya 7.5 mil. km² (including the South Asian subcontinent and Southeast Asia)
* Australasia 7.7 mil. km² (including Australia, New Guinea, and neighbouring islands).The northern boundary of this zone is known as the Wallace line.
* Neotropic 19.0 mil. km² (including South America and the Caribbean)
* Oceania 1.0 mil. km² (including Polynesia, Fiji and Micronesia)
* Antarctic 0.3 mil. km² (including Antarctica).

= Ecoregions=


Ecozones are further divided into ecoregions.The World has over 800 terrestrial ecoregions.''See Lists of ecoregions by country.''

Political divisions


A political division, usually a country, is a region under the control of a government.Countries are further divided into administrative divisions including states, counties, cities, etc.

The ''Earth's Spheres'' relate to the division of the Earth into broadly four interacting spheres:

* Hydrosphere 
* Biosphere 
* Lithosphere 
* Atmosphere 

Other interpretations of this model of the Earth include the following additional spheres:
* Pedosphere (Soil)
* Geosphere 
* Anthroposphere
* Cryosphere (Sometimes included in the hydrosphere)

Bodies of water


A ''body of water'' is any significant accumulation of water on a geographical scale.Some bodies of water can be man-made, but most are naturally occurring.Some bodies of water collect and move water, such as rivers and streams, and others primarily hold water, such as lakes and oceans. Bodies of water that are navigable are known as waterways.

Some notable geographers


A ''geographer'' is a scientist who studies Earth's physical environment and human habitat. Geographers are historically known for making maps, the subdiscipline of geography known as cartography.But they are not only capable of studying the physical details of the environment but also its impact on human and wildlife ecologies, weather and climate patterns, economics, and culture. Geographers especially focus on the spatial relationships between these elements.
