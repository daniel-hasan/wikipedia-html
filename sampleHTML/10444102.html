There were many other important figures in the Song era besides Shen Kuo and Su Song, many of whom contributed greatly to the technological innovations of the time period. Although the mechanically-driven mile-marking device of the carriage-drawn odometer had been known in China since the ancient <a href="/wiki/Han_Dynasty" id="w">Han Dynasty</a>, the <i>Song Shi</i> (compiled in 1345) provides a much greater description and more in-depth view of the device than earlier Chinese sources. The <i>Song Shi</i> states:</p>

Furthermore, the odometer device in the Song period (and once during the earlier Tang period) was combined with the <a href="/wiki/South_Pointing_Chariot" id="w">South Pointing Chariot</a> device, which was first invented by the ancient Chinese mechanical engineer <a href="/wiki/Ma_Jun" id="w">Ma Jun</a> (馬鈞; c. 200&#8211;265). The South Pointing Chariot was a wheeled vehicle that incorporated complex <a href="/wiki/Differential_(mechanical_device)" id="w">differential</a> gears, used now in all modern automobiles to apply equal amounts of <a href="/wiki/Torque" id="w">torque</a> to wheels rotating at different speeds while turning. The differential gear was incorporated in order to keep a mechanical-operated figure pointing in a fixed position to the south. Hence, the device used advanced mechanics, rather than the magnetism of a <a href="/wiki/Compass" id="w">compass</a>, in order to navigate and find one&#39;s directional bearings. Yan Su(燕肃; c. 961&#8211;1040), the Divisional Director in the Ministry of Works, recreated a South Pointing Chariot device in 1027, and his specifications for creating the device were provided in the <i>Song Shi</i>.<sup id="_ref-sivin III 31_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sivin III 31" title="">[23]</a></sup> This is of little surprise, as Yan was somewhat of a polymath like Shen Kuo and Su Song, improving the design of the clepsydra clock, writing on mathematical <a href="/wiki/Harmonics" id="w">harmonics</a>, theory about tides, etc.<sup id="_ref-sivin III 31_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sivin III 31" title="">[23]</a></sup> The <i>Song Shi</i> text records that it was the engineer Wu Deren who combined the South Pointing Chariot and odometer in the year 1107:</p>

The Chinese of the Song Dynasty were adept <a href="/wiki/Maritime" id="w">maritime</a> sailors who traveled to ports of call as far away as <a href="/wiki/Fatimid" id="w">Fatimid</a> Egypt. They were well equipped for their journeys abroad, in large seagoing vessels steered by stern-post <a href="/wiki/Rudder" id="w">rudders</a> and guided by the directional <a href="/wiki/Compass" id="w">compass</a>. Even before Shen Kuo and Zhu Yu had described the mariner&#39;s magnetic needle compass, the earlier military treatise of the <i><a href="/wiki/Wujing_Zongyao" id="w">Wujing Zongyao</a></i> in 1044 had also described a thermoremanence compass.<sup id="_ref-sivin III 21_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sivin III 21" title="">[61]</a></sup> This was a simple iron or steel needle that was heated, cooled, and placed in a bowl of water, producing the effect of weak magnetization, although its use was described only for navigation on land and not at sea.<sup id="_ref-sivin III 21_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sivin III 21" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Literature" name="Literature"></a><h3>Literature</h3>
<p>There were plenty of descriptions in Chinese literature of the time on the operations and aspects of seaports, maritime merchant shipping, overseas trade, and the sailing ships themselves. The author <a href="/wiki/Zhu_Yu_(author)" id="w">Zhu Yu</a> (朱彧) wrote not only of the magnetic compass for navigation, but also a hundred foot line with a hook that was cast over the deck of the ship, used to collect mud samples at the bottom of the sea in order for the crew to determine their whereabouts by the smell and appearance of the mud.<sup id="_ref-needham volume 4 part 1 279_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 4 part 1 279" title="">[62]</a></sup> In addition, Zhu Yu wrote of <a href="/wiki/Bulkhead_(partition)" id="w">watertight bulkhead compartments</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)" id="w">hulls</a> of ships to prevent sinking if damaged, the <a href="/wiki/Fore-and-aft_rig" id="w">for-and-aft</a> <a href="/wiki/Lugger" id="w">lug</a>, taut mat sails, and the practice of beating-to-windward.<sup id="_ref-needham volume 4 part 3 463_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 4 part 3 463" title="">[63]</a></sup> Confirming Zhu Yu&#39;s writing on Song Dynasty ships with bulkhead hull compartments, in 1973 a 78 ft long, 29 ft wide Song Dynasty trade ship from c. 1277 AD was dredged from the water near the southern coast of China that contained 12 bulkhead compartment rooms in its hull.<sup id="_ref-ebrey 159_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey 159" title="">[64]</a></sup> Maritime culture during the Song period was enhanced by these new technologies, along with the allowance of greater river and canal traffic.

The art of <a href="/wiki/History_of_ferrous_metallurgy" id="w">metallurgy</a> during the Song Dynasty built upon the efforts of earlier Chinese dynasties, while new methods were incorporated.

<p>Here Sheng Ruozi quotes a written selection about windmills from the &#39;Placid Retired Scholar&#39;, who is actually Yelü Chucai (1190&#8211;1244), a prominent Jin and <a href="/wiki/Yuan_Dynasty" id="w">Yuan</a> statesman (after the Jin fell in 1234 to the <a href="/wiki/Mongols" id="w">Mongols</a>).<sup id="_ref-needham volume 4 part 2 560_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 4 part 2 560" title="">[94]</a></sup> The passage refers to Yelü&#39;s journey to <a href="/wiki/Turkestan" id="w">Turkestan</a> (in modern <a href="/wiki/Xinjiang" id="w">Xinjiang</a>) in 1219, and Hechong Fu is actually <a href="/wiki/Samarkand" id="w">Samarkand</a> (in modern <a href="/wiki/Uzbekistan" id="w">Uzbekistan</a>).<sup id="_ref-needham volume 4 part 2 560_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 4 part 2 560" title="">[94]</a></sup> Afterwards, the Chinese applied the &#39;fore-and-aft&#39; sail riggings of typical Chinese junk ships to horizontal windmills.<sup id="_ref-needham volume 4 part 2 561_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 4 part 2 561" title="">[95]</a></sup> These windmills were used to operate the square-pallet <a href="/wiki/Chain_pump" id="w">chain pumps</a> used in Chinese <a href="/wiki/Irrigation" id="w">irrigation</a> since the ancient <a href="/wiki/Han_Dynasty" id="w">Han Dynasty</a>.<sup id="_ref-needham volume 4 part 2 558_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 4 part 2 558" title="">[96]</a></sup> Windmills of this nature were still in use during modern times in <a href="/wiki/Tianjin" id="w">Tianjin</a> and along the <a href="/wiki/Yangtze" id="w">Yangtze</a> River.<sup id="_ref-needham volume 4 part 2 558_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 4 part 2 558" title="">[96]</a></sup> The first European to view Chinese windmills was Jan Nieuhoff, who spotted them in <a href="/wiki/Jiangsu" id="w">Jiangsu</a> while traveling along the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Canal" id="w">Grand Canal</a> in 1656, as part of the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Dutch</a> <a href="/wiki/Embassy" id="w">embassy</a> to <a href="/wiki/Beijing" id="w">Beijing</a>.<sup id="_ref-needham volume 4 part 2 558_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 4 part 2 558" title="">[96]</a></sup> The first European windmills written of were those of Dean Herbert of <a href="/wiki/East_Anglia" id="w">East Anglia</a> in 1191, who competed with the mills of the <a href="/wiki/Abbey" id="w">Abbey</a> of <a href="/wiki/Bury_St_Edmunds" id="w">Bury St Edmunds</a>.<sup id="_ref-needham volume 4 part 2 555_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 4 part 2 555" title="">[97]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the windmill, wind power applications in other devices and even vehicles were found in China. There was the &#39;<a href="/wiki/Wheelbarrow" id="w">sailing carriage</a>&#39; that appeared by at least the <a href="/wiki/Ming_Dynasty" id="w">Ming Dynasty</a> in the 16th century (although it could have been known beforehand). European travelers to China in the late 16th century were surprised to find large single-wheel passenger and cargo wheelbarrows not only pulled by mule or horse, but also mounted with ship-like masts and sails to help push them along by the wind.<sup id="_ref-needham volume 4 part 2 274 276_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-needham volume 4 part 2 274 276" title="">[98]</a></sup></p>
