<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h1>Plot</h1>
<p><i>Outnumbered</i> is about a family living in <a href="/wiki/South_London" id="w">South London</a>, where the parents are &#34;Outnumbered&#34; by their three children. The parents constantly try to keep their children under control, but completely fail to do so. The father, Pete, (<a href="/wiki/Hugh_Dennis" id="w">Hugh Dennis</a>) works at an inner city school as a history teacher, whereas mother, Sue, (<a href="/wiki/Claire_Skinner" id="w">Claire Skinner</a>) is a part-time PA.<sup id="_ref-Press Office_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Press Office" title="">[6]</a></sup> The three children are eleven-year-old Jake (<a href="/wiki/Tyger_Drew-Honey" id="w">Tyger Drew-Honey</a>) who worries about everything, from worrying about starting at his new school to the world being sucked into a <a href="/wiki/Black_hole" id="w">black hole</a>,<sup id="_ref-S1E6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S1E6" title="">[7]</a></sup> seven-year-old Ben (<a href="/wiki/Daniel_Roche_(actor)" id="w">Daniel Roche</a>) who constantly lies to his parents and always wants to watch <i><a href="/wiki/Little_Britain" id="w">Little Britain</a></i>,<sup id="_ref-S1E4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-S1E4" title="">[8]</a></sup> and five-year-old Karen (<a href="/wiki/Ramona_Marquez" id="w">Ramona Marquez</a>) who constantly asks too many questions.<sup id="_ref-Press Office_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Press Office" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Episode Synopsis_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Episode Synopsis" title="">[9]</a></sup> Other characters who regularly appear include Sue&#39;s <a href="/wiki/New_age" id="w">new age</a> 44-year-old sister, Angela, (<a href="/wiki/Samantha_Bond" id="w">Samantha Bond</a>) and their father, referred to as &#34;Grandad&#34;, (<a href="/wiki/David_Ryall" id="w">David Ryall</a>) who appears to be suffering from <a href="/wiki/Dementia" id="w">senility</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Another character referred to is the <a href="/wiki/Unseen_character" id="w">unseen</a> Veronica, a very overbearing woman that Sue works for, who constantly demands too much.</p>
<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h1>Production</h1>
<p><i>Outnumbered</i> marks the first collaboration between Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin since <i><a href="/wiki/Drop_the_Dead_Donkey" id="w">Drop the Dead Donkey</a></i> ended in 1998.<sup id="_ref-Press Office_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Press Office" title="">[6]</a></sup> It was commissioned by <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Lumsden" id="w">Lucy Lumsden</a>, the BBC Controller Comedy Commissioning, and the <a href="/wiki/Executive_producer" id="w">executive producer</a> is <a href="/wiki/Jon_Rolph" id="w">Jon Rolph</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  Originally a 20-minute long pilot was made, which was given to Lumsden who then commissioned six episodes. Whilst the setting for the show is somewhere in South London, the show was shot on location in <a href="/wiki/Wandsworth" id="w">Wandsworth</a>.<sup id="_ref-Press Office_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Press Office" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Outnumbered</i> is notable for using improvisation, in order to get more believable performances from the child actors. Dennis commented on this saying that, &#34;In most sitcoms all the lines for children are written by adults. So they are speaking the words of people 30 years older. And you really want kids to have their own voices, and say their own things.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Sun_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sun" title="">[2]</a></sup> Jenkin said that: &#34;You rarely get the feeling that children in sitcoms are real. They tend to be the same type of character – the smartarse who says adult things – and they are rooted to the spot, staring at the camera, because they&#39;ve been told to stand in one place and say the lines. We decided to attempt to do something that hadn&#39;t been tried before, bounced some ideas around and we got very keen on this idea of involving improvisation very quickly.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Press Office_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Press Office" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h1>Reception</h1>
<p>The first episode received 4.1 million viewers (25.5%) of the audience share when it began and finished with 2.8 million (19.5%) at the end, which is larger than the average 2.2 million (14%) normally attracted by television shows at its particular time slot.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The audience for the second episode however fell by half a million viewers, whilst still being the highest ranking show in its time slot, with 18% of the audience share.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> However, it maintained a constant audience throughout the first series, with the fourth episode attracting 2.7 million viewers (20% audience share).<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Reception to the show was mixed. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Mirror" id="w">The Daily Mirror</a></i> found the mundane settings to be similar to the American sitcom <i><a href="/wiki/Seinfeld" id="w">Seinfeld</a></i> saying that &#34;compared to the ridiculous carry-on of <i><a href="/wiki/My_Family" id="w">My Family</a></i>, it&#39;s much more low-key and realistic. In fact it&#39;s so low-key, nothing actually happens, which could well be a nod to <i>Seinfeld</i> - the touchstone of all great sitcoms. The getting ready for school chaos is like <i><a href="/wiki/Supernanny" id="w">Supernanny</a></i>: The Movie only with nicer children. It&#39;s also taken a leaf out of <i><a href="/wiki/Curb_Your_Enthusiasm" id="w">Curb Your Enthusiasm&#39;s</a></i> book with large chunks of improvisation - although the strongest language you&#39;ll find here is &#34;ponk&#34;.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Mirror_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mirror" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Rod_Liddle" id="w">Rod Liddle</a>, in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sunday_Times" id="w">The Sunday Times</a></i>, also praised the show, although he was somewhat surprised saying, &#34;An exquisitely middle-class, middle-aged domestic situation comedy set in north London – maybe <a href="/wiki/Crouch_End" id="w">Crouch End</a> or <a href="/wiki/Tufnell_Park" id="w">Tufnell Park</a> – and starring one of those bloody stand-up comics who now festoons every network, it really should be hated before it is even seen. Start liking this sort of programme and you are an ace away from enjoying <i><a href="/wiki/Terry_and_June" id="w">Terry and June</a></i> and having a house that smells faintly of weak tea, Murray Mints and urine. So, maybe it&#39;s just me, but <i>Outnumbered</i> is very funny indeed: despite its current bout of self-flagellation, the BBC still knows how to make people laugh. Comedy may be the very last thing the corporation does well.&#34;<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>James Walton wrote in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" id="w">The Daily Telegraph</a></i> that the domestic setting and more mundane storylines were a virtue, saying, &#34;All of this feels both carefully observed and suspiciously heartfelt. More unusually, it’s not contrived. <i>Outnumbered</i> sticks firmly with the mundane, yet manages to be funny about it. It doesn’t avoid the sheer dullness involved in family life either – but, happily, depicts it with a winning mixture of exasperation and affection.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Telegraph_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Telegraph" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, Kevin Maher of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" id="w">The Times</a></i> attacked the quality of the programme, saying it is not funny or dramatic enough. He wrote, &#34;<i>Outnumbered</i> was at its most meretricious. For every exchange between adult and child was hijacked by a crass sitcommy need for sotto voce punchlines and knowing winks to the wings. A protracted scene in which 45-year-old dad (Hugh Dennis) was unable to wrestle a live power drill from the hands of 7-year-old son Ben (Daniel Roche), and instead had to, ho-ho, pay him £5 for the privilege, was emblematic of the show’s dubious capacity for fake pay-offs.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Times_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Times" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Walton criticised the scheduling of the programme saying, &#34;Despite the very specific London setting, the series (shown in two batches of three, this week and next) will surely appeal to the parents of young children everywhere. As long, that is, as they’re not asleep by 10.35pm.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Telegraph_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Telegraph" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Outnumbered</i> is currently nominated for the 2008 &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/Broadcast_(magazine)" id="w">Broadcast</a></i> Award&#34; for &#34;Best Comedy Programme&#34;.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
