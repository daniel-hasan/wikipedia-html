<dl><dd>The second Bronze Saint to appear in the story was Jabu the Unicorn Saint. As a fellow orphan he had been sent out with 99 more of his brothers by their father Mitsumasa Kido. He achieved the Unicorn Cloth in Algeria and returned to Japan to participate in the Galaxian Wars tournament to receive the Gold Cloth of Sagittarius. He easily defeated Lionet Ban in his first match but was outmatched against Andromeda Shun whose chains proved impenetrable. He returned to his master in Algeria to further his training, and during this time his Cloth came to upgrade itself as well. When Saori Kido had been shot by a golden arrow, he came to her rescue and protected her from the then antagonistic forces of the Sanctuary. After that he came to reside in the Sanctuary and protected it against the Saints Hades had revived, and protected Pegasus Seiya&#39;s sister Seika from the attacks of the god of death.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Hydra Ichi was like the other Bronze Saints that participated in the Galaxian Wars a fellow orphan. His and the other Bronze Saint&#39;s father Mitsumasa Kido was the founder of the Graud foundation. After being taken from the orphanage by Mitsumasa he was sent out to train in Finland to become a Saint of Athena. He came back years later to participate in the Galaxian Wars that were now held by Mitsumasa&#39;s adopted granddaughter Saori Kido. In his first match Ichi had to battle Cygnus Hyōga. The Hydra Saint underestimated his opponent who froze him to near death. Ashamed by his defeat, he asked Saori for permission to undergo further training in Finland with his master. She agreed and thus Ichi didn&#39;t reappear until Saori was put in danger in Sanctuary after being struck by a golden arrow. From then on, he served her as Athena and came to reside in Sanctuary. Later he protected Sanctuary from the revived Saints, and protected Pegasus Seiya&#39;s sister from the death god Thanatos.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Nachi is one of the 100 orphans that were brought into the Graud Foundation to fulfill a project: to be trained to become future Saints for the goddess Athena. Only 10 of the children survived the entire process, and they grew up to become Bronze Saints. In the Galaxy Wars arc, Nachi loses the tournament and decides to return to Liberia to continue his training, later returning with the other four Bronze Saints to rescue Tatsumi and the comatose Athena. They stay with them until Gold Saint Gemini Saga, the false Pope of Sanctuary, is defeated. In the Hades arc, Nachi and Ichi are appointed commanders over the Sanctuary guards. As the dead Silver Saints start appearing and they realize their attacks are useless, they are saved by the timely appearance of Jabu. Later Nachi risks his life to protect Seika from Thanatos.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>The Saint bearing the Leo Minor constellation in 1990 was Ban. He was sent along with 99 other orphans to different parts of the world to train to become a Saint. He earned his Cloth on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, and was thus one of the only ten that had succeeded in their training. When he returned to Japan to the Galaxian Wars fighting tournament, however, he met an early defeat at the hands of Unicorn Jabu. Feeling ashamed by his defeat, he returned to Tanzania to undergo further training, and returned when Athena had been incapacitated by the golden arrow. There, he protected the goddess from the soldiers of Sanctuary. He came to stay in Sanctuary and protected Seiya&#39;s sister Seika from the assault of the god Thanatos.</dd></dl>

He returned to Japan and participated in the Galaxian Wars Tournament held by the Graude foundation. Unfortunately, he met with defeat at the hands of the Pegasus Saint, Seiya, and had to recover. With permission from Athena, Geki returned to his master in Canada for further training. When Athena was hit by the fatal golden arrow, the Bear Saint reappeared to protect her. After the events that followed, he came to stay in the Sanctuary due to the impending war against Hades, and stood his ground against the god of death Thanatos when he tried to take the life of Seiya&#39;s sister.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>June was trained alongside Andromeda Shun on Andromeda Island under the tutelage of Cepheus Daidalos. She was very protective of the Andromeda Saint, and tried to make him quit to avoid him getting hurt. Despite her wishes, Shun attained Sainthood and left for Japan, leaving June behind. She completed her training successfully and earned the Bronze Chamaeleon Cloth. Soon after, her master was assassinated by Pisces Aphrodite. When she heard about the Bronze Saints&#39; plans to defy Sanctuary, she immediately set out to stop Shun. Shun respected her feelings but intended to join his brothers nevertheless, and knocked her unconscious in a small fight. The Andromeda Saint carried her to the Kido mansion to rest until his return. After a brief appearance during the Twelve Temples arc in a flashback, to date, June has never reappeared in Kurumada&#39;s manga.</dd></dl>
<a id="Silver_Saints" name="Silver_Saints"></a><h3>Silver Saints</h3>
<p>{{nihongo}}</p>
<p>The Saints wearing the second-highest ranked Cloths are the Silver Saints, the specialists in battle. They possess advanced mastery of Cosmo, which enables them to attain speeds ranging from <a href="/wiki/Mach_number" id="w">mach</a> 2 to 5, and also grants them tremendous physical strength. When they receive an assignment from the Sanctuary, they go to any part of the world to fulfill it, whatever the cost, using all their power. They represent the true concept of a Saint of Athena.</p>
<p>Another of their responsibilities is to take care of the Cloths that do not have owners. It is common to find Silver Saints training potential candidates to gain one of these Cloths. As many Saints and Cloths were lost in the last Holy War, training new Saints and increasing the ranks are important tasks to be fulfilled before the next Holy War.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Silver Cloths are more beautiful and stronger than Bronze Cloths. They freeze at a temperature of -200°C. Currently there have only been eighteen Silver Cloths confirmed, however, the Silver Cloths of <a href="/wiki/Orion_(constellation)" id="w">Orion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Scutum" id="w">Shield</a> and <a href="/wiki/Crux" id="w">Southern Cross</a>, created by Masami Kurumada for the first Saint Seiya theatrical release, as well as their bearers, are considered canonical.</p>
<p>The seventeenth and eighteenth Silver Cloths were revealed in the Saint Seiya Encyclopedia; they represent the constellations of <a href="/wiki/Crater_(constellation)" id="w">Crateris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ara_(constellation)" id="w">Ara</a>, although the latter has never been featured in any arcs of the manga to date. In total there are twenty-four Silver Saints, but only sixteen were revealed by Kurumada in the story arcs of his manga Saint Seiya. Recently, since the start of <i><a href="/wiki/Saint_Seiya_Next_Dimension" id="w">Saint Seiya Next Dimension</a></i>, the canonical continuation of Kurumada&#39;s original manga, a new Silver Saint was added to the universe, Crateris Suikyō, whose Cloth differs entirely from the one shown in the Saint Seiya Encyclopedia.</p>

<dl><dd>An enigmatic female Silver Saint of strong personality, she was assigned as mentor of the young Seiya when he arrived to Sanctuary, as both were of japanese nationality. She instructed him in the ways of the Saints with a stern hand and strict discipline, enabling him to cultivate his enormous potential. Due to the code of the female Saints, Seiya never had the chance to know her mentor&#39;s facial features, as she always concealed her behind her mandatory mask. Although Seiya endured hardships during his training, he and Marin bonded strongly. Due to Marin&#39;s physical appearance, her pupil Seiya long wondered if she and her long-lost sister Seika were one and the same, a question that would take time to be answered as Marin was aware of the machinations of the false Pope of Sanctuary and involved herself in the rebellion to overthrow him. Marin assists Seiya and the Bronze Saints in their battle against the Silver Saints, after which she disappears temporarily. During this absence, Marin made shocking discoveries when she entered, at the risk of her life, the forbidden place known as Star Hill, learning the truth about the false Pope and his rise to power. She reappears during the climax of the conflict of the twelve temples, saving Seiya&#39;s life and helping him to reach the Pope&#39;s chambers. During the resurrection of Poseidon, Marin once again parts on business of her own, reappearing until the climax of the war against Hades, when she reveals the reason of her long absence: She had been able to locate Seiya&#39;s sister Seika, finally dissipating the enigma of her identity and ending a tortuous and seemingly futile search that had lasted years. Also, Marin reveals she had also been searching for her long lost brother, Tōma, who became an Angel, one of the servants of the goddess Artemis. During Seiya and the Bronze Saints&#39; battle against Thanatos in the Elysion fields, Marin bravely opposses the deities&#39; murderous attempts on Seika&#39;s life, finally achieving, after the defeat of Hades and his army, the rejoining of the siblings at long last. Recently, she battled the Angel Tōma, preventing him from taking Seiya&#39;s life. Although she felt Tōma as someone from her past, she remains ignorant of his true identity and relation to her.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Misty was a narcissist who considered himself inferior only to the goddess Athena herself. Misty made it clear when he was sent to Japan with his fellow Silver Saints to deal with the renegade Bronze Saints. When Phoenix Ikki came back to his senses with the help of his fellow Bronze Saints, the Lizard Saint created a landslide in the hopes of burying them, but he was unsuccessful. Aries Mu created illusions which made the four Black Saints look like the Bronze Saints and teleported them all eight from the landslide. The Silver Saints were deceived by the illusion and went after the Black Saints but Eagle Marin and Misty went after the real Pegasus. Marin, in hopes of saving Seiya, attacked her pupil with an illusion attack and buried him. Misty however didn&#39;t fall for it and took the Bronze Saint out of his grave and attacked him. The Silver Saint told Seiya that he had never been bruised in battle and that itself was true victory in Misty&#39;s view, never to be hurt by an opponent. During the fight some blood from Seiya fell on Misty, who was disgusted by it cleaned it off. Thus, he removed his Cloth and went into the nearby sea. Seiya deemed him crazy and as soon as Misty donned his Cloth again, the battle continued. After, a hard battle, Pegasus Seiya overcame Misty&#39;s attacks and defeated him.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>In the adaptation to anime of the Hades arc from the manga, Misty was revived along with his fellow Silver Saints and was sent to fight the Bronze Saints. He was soon defeated by Cygnus Hyōga and proclaimed him a true Saint. In the same way as the revived Gold Saints, the Silver Saints had pledged loyalty to Hades while secretly remaining true Saints of Athena.</dd></dl>

Thinking they completed their mission, they retreated, but returned due to Misty and Babel&#39;s delay. Being accompanied by Hound Asterion, who could read minds, Mozes soon turned on Eagle Marin. After subduing her, they tied her upside down to a pole in the sea, to use her as bait for Pegasus Seiya. The plan failed, and Seiya engaged Mozes in combat. After a bloody battle, Seiya sprouted wings from his Cosmo, and Mozes was defeated.</dd></dl>

He was sent along with Misty, Asterion and Mozes to kill the Bronze Saints for their crimes against Sanctuary.

Believing they had accomplished their mission, they retreated, though Misty stayed behind to confirm his suspicions. After some time, Babel grew worried and returned to find Misty dead on the beach. Cygnus Hyōga soon arrived and challenged the Silver Saint, who was confused because he thought he had already killed the Bronze Saint. Babel regained his composure and fought, confident he had the advantage with his flames, but was ultimately defeated by Hyōga&#39;s freezing Cosmo.</dd></dl>

Thinking they had completed their mission, they retreated, but came back due to Misty and Babel&#39;s late return. As Asterion is one of the few people in the Sanctuary who can use telepathy, he soon discovered that Eagle Marin had betrayed them. After defeating her, he and Mozes used her as bait for Pegasus Seiya by tying her to a pole upside down in the sea. Pegasus Seiya came to them and narrowly managed to defeat Mozes, but was overwhelmed by Asterion&#39;s power. In the meantime, Eagle Marin was able to free herself and fought against Asterion. By closing her mind and thinking of nothing, she managed to defeat him, but let him live and return to Sanctuary with a warning to the Pope.

Algol then battled with Dragon Shiryū, but was outsmarted when the Dragon Saint blinded his eyes with his own fingers so that he could not see the Medusa Shield, as last resort to stop Algol and save the other Bronze Saints&#39; lives.

After explaining how to reach the Pope through the twelve temples, he suddenly attacked the Saints with a shower of arrows. However, the shower of arrows was an illusion, only one was real; his target was Athena. The real arrow hit Athena in the chest, angering Seiya, who immediately retaliated. In his final moments, Ptolemy said that only the Pope could remove the arrow, and that it would take twelve hours for it to kill Athena. A predecessor of Ptolemy, also a bearer of the Sagitta Cloth from a past era known as {{nihongo}}, was created by Masami Kurumada for the first Saint Seiya teathrical release.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>A Silver Saint said to be as powerful as a Gold Saint, and also a musical virtuoso of the lyre. Just like the tragic greek hero Orpheus, he had a lover called Eurydice whom died, and with determination he went to Hades and played his music to have Eurydice back. Having his wish fulfilled, he was told to not look back during the trek back to the world of the living, until he reached the surface, unfortunately, Sphinx Pharaoh faked a light from the sun and tricked Orphée into turning around. Eurydice turned halfway into stone and thus Orphée decided to stay with her forever in the underworld. When Athena&#39;s Saints invaded Hades&#39; domains, he freed Pegasus Seiya and Andromeda Shun from the clutches of Pharaoh. This action eventually led to the revelation that Pharaoh had tricked Orphée and in a battle of music the Saint killed the Specter. Renewing his vows as a Saint, Orphée then made the choice to help his comrades and defeat Hades, and took them to the god&#39;s throne room. With sweet melody, he bespelled the 3 Judges and Pandora, but his trick did not work on Wyvern Rhadamanthys who eventually killed him.<sup id="_ref-SS Vol 23, Chapter 86_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SS Vol 23, Chapter 86" title="">[2]</a></sup> A predecessor from a past era, who bore his same constellation and the Lyra Cloth, called {{nihongo}}, was created by Masami Kurumada for the first Saint Seiya teathrical release.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>A former Bronze Saint who was promoted to Gold Saint, Shion is, along with Libra Dohko, a survivor of the war against Hades in the 18th century, during which he was guardian of the Temple of the White Ram. After Hades&#39; defeat, he was chosen as the Pope of Sanctuary by Athena, his reign lasting until the late 20th century, when he was murdered by Gemini Saga, who usurped his position. He was mentor to Aries Mu, instructing him in the ways of the Saints and the arts of Cloth restoration. Shion was resurrected 13 years after his death by Hades, and offered eternal life in exchange of his loyalty and Athena&#39;s life. Incorruptibly loyal to the goddess even in the cold embrace of death, Shion accepted the offer, while secretly remaining a true Saint of Athena, his strategy was emulated by the rest of revived Saints. Shion&#39;s true purpose was to reach Athena to deliver her Cloth, later becoming unable to do so because the new life bestowed on him by Hades was only temporary. Instead, Shion instructs the Bronze Saints about the secret of Athena&#39;s Cloth and reveals the mystery of the ultimate state of the Cloths bathed in divine blood. Instrumental in the downfall of Hades in the 20th century, Shion issues his last order as Pope to the Bronze Saints, to invade the Underworld and kill Hades, before exhaling his final breath.</dd></dl>

Mu left the Sanctuary shortly after Shion&#39;s murder as he harbored suspicion about the legitimacy of the Pope, settling in the remote Jamir region. A valuable ally to the Bronze Saints, he first assists them in repairing their Cloths, a service he provides in more than one occasion. Mu saved the Bronze Saints&#39; lives during the battles against the Black Saints and assisted Seiya in the duel against Lizard Misty. During the conflict of the twelve temples, he sides with Libra Dohko and the Bronze Saints, revealing to the latter the secret of the Seventh Sense and helping them in the insurrection against the false Pope, as he knew the truth behind his rise to power and the nature of the trial imposed by destiny on Athena. During the holy war against Poseidon, he keeps the eager Gold Saints from parting to the battle, as Hades&#39; return to Earth was mere weeks away. During the war against Hades, Mu displays fearsome power and battle prowess by defeating powerful Specters, albeit falling before Wyvern Rhadamanthys, who then throws him into the Cocytos prison.

A good natured giant who wielded wondrous physical strength and unmatched battle speed due to his technique similar to the <a href="/wiki/Iai" id="w">iai</a> combat principle, Aldebaran was a Gold Saint truly committed to the duty of protecting peace and justice on Earth. During the conflict of the twelve temples, he first opposed the Bronze Saints&#39; rebellion against Sanctuary, as he was tricked by the Pope into deeming them traitors. Aldebaran was engaged in battle by Pegasus Seiya, whose determination in battle led his already increasing suspicions about the legitimacy of the Pope, to grow even further. Seiya swore to break off one of the horns of Aldebaran&#39;s helmet, to prove his cause was just. Aldebaran agreed, believing the young Saint wouldn&#39;t be capable of such a feat. To his astonishment, Seiya fulfills his promise, and Aldebaran allows him to tresspass the Taurus Temple. Near the end of Seiya&#39;s battle against Gemini Saga, Aldebaran realizes his suspicions about the Pope were not far from the truth and swears allegiance to Athena once he meets her. In the Poseidon arc, Aldebaran protects the moribund Bronze Saints from Siren Sorrento&#39;s murder attempt, at the cost of deafening himself. During the war against Hades, Aldebaran is murdered by Deep Niobe, not without completely obliterating the Specter.

<dl><dd>The secondary Gemini Saint in the 20th century, twin brother of Gemini Saga and second guardian of the Temple of the Twins. A man of many traits and consumed by evil since his youth, Kanon was truly a cardinal tool of destiny in the shaping of events in the present era, first, as instigator of Gemini Saga&#39;s rebellion, secondly as the moving force behind Poseidon&#39;s resurrection and lastly, as a formidable enemy of Hades&#39; army. Shortly after Athena&#39;s advent in the 20th century, Kanon conspired to murder her and seize Sanctuary, trying to include his twin brother Saga in his machinations. Horrified by Kanon&#39;s intentions, Saga imprisoned him in Cape Sounion, sentencing him to death. While imprisoned, Kanon&#39;s life was sustained by a mysterious force, and he was able to find Poseidon&#39;s Submarine Temple. Removing Athena&#39;s seal from the <a href="/wiki/Amphora" id="w">Amphora</a> that contained his soul, Poseidon was freed and Kanon fooled the deity into thinking he was one of his Mariner Generals, {{nihongo}}. As Poseidon revealed he would possess the young Julian Solo, Kanon plotted to manipulate Solo and harness Poseidon&#39;s power to fulfill his ambition of tyranical reign. Years later, his plans soundly backfired, and Kanon regretted having freed Poseidon, at the cost of millions of human lives to the cataclysms brought upon Earth by the god of the seas. Later realizing it was Athena who mercifully saved his life while imprisoned, Kanon saves her life from Poseidon&#39;s attack and renounced his wicked ways after the deity&#39;s defeat. Days before the war against Hades, Kanon is cleansed of his evil by Athena who grants him her forgiveness for his numerous sins, and Kanon embraces his destiny as Gold Saint, not without being forced to tortuously prove the legitimacy of his conversion by Scorpio Milo. Choosing to bear the stigma of being responsible for the deaths of millions for the rest of his life, Kanon parts to the front and displays true courage and fearsome strength by wreaking havoc in Hades&#39; ranks, defeating numerous powerful Specters, fueled by unfailing devotion and gratitude to Athena. Finally, at the climax of the war against Underworld, Kanon sends the Gemini Gold Cloth to his resurrected brother Saga to help in the piercing of the Wailing Wall, and having fulfilled his task, sacrifices his life removing Wyvern Rhadamanthys&#39; terrible threat. Achieving redemption at last, Kanon dies happy of having finally been able to atone for his crimes in the past and use his power to help his fellow men.</dd></dl>

With a twisted perception of justice, Deathmask swore allegiance to the false Pope as he considered his evil deeds would be deemed justice in the future. He was sent by the Pope to murder Libra Dohko in Lushan, but desisted due to the intervention of Aries Mu and Dragon Shiryū. During the conflict of the twelve temples, Deathmask faced Shiryū in a duel to the death, in the Hill to the Land of Spirits. After a lengthy battle, Deathmask was abandoned by the Cancer Gold Cloth, which deemed him unworthy of donning it and of the title of Gold Saint.

A powerful and virtuous young man of exceptional human quality, passionate for his duty of protecting peace and justice and with a heart burning with loyalty towards Athena, Aiolia was regarded, along Scorpio Milo, as the pride of Sanctuary. Despite having grown up under the undeserved stigma of betrayal of his brother, Aiolos&#39; memory shone brightly in Aiolia&#39;s life. He was loyal to the false Pope as he was deceived by him into deeming the Bronze Saints traitors and Saori Kido an usurper of Athena&#39;s name. Aiolia is sent by the Pope to kill the Bronze Saints, under the watch of three Silver Saints. He engages Pegasus Seiya in battle as he refuses to reveal the location of his comrades. Aiolia is astonished to witness the Sagittarius Gold Cloth protect Seiya and kill the Silver Saints, helping then Seiya in his battle. Afterward, a vision of his deceased brother confirms the teenager to be a genuine Saint, and Kido to be the true Athena. Having discovered the truth, Aiolia pledges loyalty to Athena and returns to Sanctuary, facing the Pope and revealing he knew about his scheme. In a brief battle, the Pope succeeds in crushing Aiolia&#39;s rebellion and subjects him under his control with his Demon Emperor&#39;s Dellusional Fist, the effects of which wouldn&#39;t cease until Aiolia took a life. During the conflict of the twelve temples, Aiolia opposses the Bronze Saints insurrection due to the Pope&#39;s control and is stopped from killing Seiya by Cassios, who sacrifices his life to save Seiya&#39;s. Regaining his senses, Aiolia joins the Bronze Saints&#39; rebellion and pledges again loyalty to Athena after the defeat of Saga. During the war against Poseidon, Aiolia is eager to join the battle against the deity, being restrained of doing so by Aries Mu, as the war against Hades was mere weeks away and Aiolia&#39;s strength would be indispensable. In the war against Underworld, Aiolia lives up to his reputation by defeating many powerful Specters, albeit suffering defeat at the hands of Wyvern Rhadamanthys, who throws him into the Cocytos prison.

Shaka deprived himself of the sense of sight in order to amass the totality of his Cosmo, thus it was said no one survived once he opened his eyes. Despite Shaka was a buddhist by conviction and a true Gold Saint who fought for justice, he was loyal to the false Pope of Sanctuary, as his ability to discern a being&#39;s true nature revealed to him that the Pope&#39;s was a benevolent one. During the conflict of the twelve temples, Shaka fought the Bronze Saints&#39; rebellion, as he was tricked into deeming them traitors. Phoenix Ikki faced Shaka&#39;s godlike power in a duel to the death, against all odds Ikki becoming triumphant, and both combatants being hurled to an alternate plane of existence in the aftermath. Both Saints return to the physical plane with Aries Mu&#39;s help and Shaka sided with the Bronze Saints once he learned the truth about the Pope and pledged loyalty to Athena. During the holy war against Poseidon, Shaka remained in Sanctuary as his strength would be indispensable in the upcoming war against Hades, during which,  Shaka wreaked havoc in the ranks of Hades&#39; army.

As his name reveals, Shijima remains mostly silent, in order to gather his Cosmo by depriving himself of speaking, and projects his thoughts to communicate with others. He first appeared in Chapter 14 of <i>Next Dimension</i>. He mentions to Taurus Ox and Capricorn Izō that he has felt Athena&#39;s Cosmo from the future, coming near to the time dimension they live in.<sup id="_ref-Chapter 14_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chapter 14" title="">[6]</a></sup> Soon enough Athena descends to the sanctuary in a crash, the Saints hurry up to Athena&#39;s statue at the top of Sanctuary where the Goddess Cosmo impacted. There they find an infant Athena sleeping in a small crater. Shijima goes forward and is about to pick up the goddess when the Holy Pope appears telling them to step back. As the pope picks the baby up in his arms he orders the Gold Saints to return to their temples. On the way down, Shijima senses something bad and heads back to Athena&#39;s statue, where the Pope is about to stab the baby Athena with a dagger. Shijima pulls the baby away and at the same time Pisces Cardinale appears.

<dl><dd>A former Bronze Saint who was promoted to Gold Saint, Dohko is, along with his close friend Aries Shion, the only other survivor of the war against Hades in the 18th century, during which he was guardian of the Temple of the Balance. Regarded as a man who boasted the greatest raw strength among the Gold Saints, and revered as the wise father figure known as Rōshi, the Old Master, Dohko exerted the task of judging good and evil among the Saints, and his guidance was a key element in the triumphs of the Bronze Saints in the 20th century. After Hades&#39; defeat in the past, Dohko was granted by Athena the divine gift of the <i>Misopethamenos</i>, a miraculous ability that turned his body virtually impervious to aging, as he was entrusted by her to guard the tower that contained the sealed souls of Hades&#39; Specters, in the centuries to come, as their resurrection would be the harbinger of the advent of the new holy war. Dohko returned to his home in Lushan and spent the next almost three centuries waiting for Hades&#39; return, becoming a diminutive, wrinkled man. During this time, he refused to attend the summons from the false Pope of Sanctuary, and he adopted the orphaned Shunrei and mentored Dragon Shiryū, instilling in him the ideals of the Saints and those of men of peace. During the conflict of the twelve temples, Dohko sided with the Bronze Saints and lent them the use of the Libra Gold Cloth, to release Cygnus Hyōga from Aquarius Camus&#39; imprisonment. After the defeat of the false Pope, Dohko joins Aries Mu in the revelation of the truth behind Saga&#39;s rise to power, and became the highest authority among the Saints. During the war against Poseidon, Dohko exerts his authority forbidding the Gold Saints from taking part in the battle, as their strength would be indispensable in the upcoming war against Hades and sent the Libra Gold Cloth to the Bronze Saints, as it was indispensable for destroying Poseidon&#39;s Mammoth Pillars. Mere weeks later, Dohko realizes the moment he waited for almost three centuries finally came, and parts to the front to battle against Hades a second time, regaining his youth and the formidable battle prowess he displayed in the 18th century. Dohko&#39;s experience from the past proves a crucial element in the Saints&#39; victory, as he revealed the secret of the Eighth Sense, he devised a strategy to pierce the Wailing Wall and revealed the location of Hades&#39; true body in Elysion. Finally, in the climax of the battle, Dohko joins his Gold Saint comrades and sacrifices his life to open the gateway to Elysion, stoically ending a long, admirable and heroic life at the service of Athena.</dd></dl>

He is engaged in a fierce duel by Cygnus Hyōga, the battle becoming so intense, Milo is forced to use his killing strike Antares, for the very first time, on Hyōga. Moribund, Hyōga crawls desperately to try to save the wounded Saori&#39;s life. Milo is shocked by Hyōga&#39;s determination and loyalty, and realizes that they can come only from devotion to the true Athena, and neutralizes Antares&#39; effects to save Hyōga&#39;s life, and confirms his suspicions. After the defeat of Saga, Milo pledges loyalty to Saori Kido as he recognized her as the true Athena. During the holy war against Poseidon, Milo was eager to invade the Submarine Temple to join the battle against the god&#39;s Marina Generals and save the Bronze Saints&#39; lives, being restrained from doing so by Aries Mu, since the Gold Saints were to be a crucial asset in the upcoming war against Hades, which broke out within mere weeks. In the war against Hades, Milo protects Athena and subjects Gemini Kanon to a tortuous trial to prove his devotion to the goddess, and recognizes him as a true Gold Saint. Later on, Milo is defeated by Wyvern Rhadamanthys and thrown into the Cocytos prison. In the climax of the battle, Milo is revitalized by Athena&#39;s Cosmo, and offers his life along his Gold Saint comrades in the final sacrifice to pierce the impervious Wailing Wall.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>The Sagittarius Gold Saint in the 20th century, guardian of the Temple of the Centaur. The embodiment of virtuousness and moral excellence, and a role model for the Saints of the Sanctuary. He was Leo Aioria&#39;s older brother and subject of his profound admiration. His qualities and deep devotion to Athena, made the aged Pope choose him as his successor, the event sparking Saga&#39;s rebellion. Aiolos foiled Saga&#39;s assassination attempt on the infant Athena, and was mortally wounded by Capricorn Shura who was deceived by Saga to deem him a traitor. Protecting Athena to the very end at the cost of his life, Aiolos died under the stigma of betrayal. His name was cleared years later by Athena when she cleansed the Sanctuary of Saga&#39;s evil. Even in death, he continues to protect Athena by lending Seiya his strength and granting him the donning of the Sagittarius Gold Cloth in dire situations, such as his battle against three Silver Saints and the final battle against the gods Poseidon and Thanatos. Finally, he resurrects in the Underworld and sacrifices his life along the rest of the Gold Saints to pierce the impervious Wailing Wall.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>The Capricorn Gold Saint in the 20th century, guardian of the Temple of the Mountain Goat. Extremely strong, he wielded the power of Excalibur, which made his limbs sharp as a razor blade. A serene warrior, Shura possessed many qualities of a true Saint, but he was loyal to the false Pope as he believed that those with power were automatically righteous, and even though the Pope was evil, he could still do good exerting his power. Deceived by the Pope, Shura mortally wounded Sagittarius Aiolos as he tried to protect the infant Athena. During the conflict of the Twelve Temples, Shura is engaged in battle by Dragon Shiryū. After a bloody battle, witnessing Shiryū&#39;s willingness to sacrifice his life to protect Athena and justice, Shura was flooded by his seemingly forgotten loyalty to the goddess. Shiryū&#39;s final attack would kill his opponent at the cost of his life, moved by the young Saint&#39;s quality, Shura passes on to him the power of Excalibur and commands the Capricorn Gold Cloth to protect Shiryū to save his life, dying in his stead. After death, Shura returns to being a truly noble and selfless Saint, abiding by their ideals, and saves Shiryū&#39;s life once again with his guidance to defeat Poseidon&#39;s Mariner Chrysaor Krishna. Shura proves once more his commitment to protect peace and justice, when he pledges loyalty to Hades while secretly remaining a true Saint. As he dies once again in the events of the Hades arc, he resurrects again in the Underworld, and finally sacrifices his life along his Gold Saint comrades to pierce the impervious Wailing Wall.</dd></dl>
