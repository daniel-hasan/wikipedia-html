<p>The <b>St. Clair Tunnel</b> is the name for two separate rail tunnels which were built under the <a href="/wiki/St._Clair_River" id="w">St. Clair River</a> between <a href="/wiki/Sarnia%2C_Ontario" id="w">Sarnia, Ontario</a> and <a href="/wiki/Port_Huron%2C_Michigan" id="w">Port Huron, Michigan</a>.</p>
<a id="First_tunnel_(1891-1995)" name="First_tunnel_(1891-1995)"></a><h1>First tunnel (1891-1995)</h1>

<p>The St. Clair Tunnel Company opened the first tunnel in <a href="/wiki/1891" id="w">1891</a>.  The company was a subsidiary of the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Trunk_Railway" id="w">Grand Trunk Railway</a>(GTR), which used the new route to connect with its subsidiary <a href="/wiki/Grand_Trunk_Western_Railroad" id="w">Grand Trunk Western Railroad</a> (GTWR).  Prior to the tunnel&#39;s construction, the GTR was forced to use time-consuming <a href="/wiki/Rail_ferry" id="w">rail ferries</a> to transfer cargo.</p>
<p>The tunnel was an engineering marvel in its day, achieved through the development of original techniques for excavating in a <a href="/wiki/Compressed_air" id="w">compressed air</a> environment.  The St. Clair River tunnel was the first <a href="/wiki/Railway" id="w">railway</a> <a href="/wiki/Tunnel" id="w">tunnel</a> in the world to pass beneath a <a href="/wiki/River" id="w">river</a>.  Freight trains used the tunnel initially with the first passenger trains using it in <a href="/wiki/1892" id="w">1892</a>.</p>
<p>The tunnel measured {{convert}} from portal to portal.  The actual width of the St. Clair River at this crossing is only {{convert}}.  The tube had a diameter of 19 feet, 10 <a href="/wiki/Inch" id="w">inches</a> (6.05 m) and hosted a single <a href="/wiki/Standard_gauge" id="w">standard gauge</a> track.  It was built at a cost of $2.7 million.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Steam_locomotive" id="w">Steam-powered locomotives</a> were used in the early years to pull trains through the tunnel, however concerns about the potential dangers of suffocation should a train stall in the tunnel led to the installation of <a href="/wiki/Overhead_catenary" id="w">catenary</a> wires for electric-powered locomotives by <a href="/wiki/1907" id="w">1907</a>.  The first use of <a href="/wiki/Electric_locomotive" id="w">electric locomotives</a> through the tunnel in regular service occurred on <a href="/wiki/May_17" id="w">May 17</a> <a href="/wiki/1908" id="w">1908</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a>, the GTR was <a href="/wiki/Nationalization" id="w">nationalized</a> by Canada&#39;s federal government, which then merged the bankrupt railway into the recently-formed <a href="/wiki/Canadian_National_Railways" id="w">Canadian National Railways</a>.  CNR also assumed control of the GTWR and the tunnel company and continued operations much as before.</p>
<p>The electric-powered locomotives were retired in <a href="/wiki/1958" id="w">1958</a> and scrapped in <a href="/wiki/1959" id="w">1959</a> after CNR retired and scrapped its last steam-powered locomotives on trains passing through the tunnel.  New <a href="/wiki/Diesel_locomotive" id="w">diesel-powered locomotives</a> didn&#39;t cause the same problems with <a href="/wiki/Air_pollution" id="w">air quality</a> in this relatively short tunnel.</p>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a>, railways in North America started to see the <a href="/wiki/Loading_gauge" id="w">dimensions</a> of <a href="/wiki/Railroad_car#Freight cars" id="w">freight cars</a> increase.  CN (name/acronym change in <a href="/wiki/1960" id="w">1960</a>) was forced to rely upon rail ferries to carry freight cars, such as <a href="/wiki/Boxcar#Hicube boxcar" id="w">hicube boxcars</a>, <a href="/wiki/Autorack" id="w">automobile carriers</a>, certain <a href="/wiki/Intermodal_freight_transport" id="w">intermodal cars</a> and chemical <a href="/wiki/Tank_car" id="w">tankers</a>, which exceeded the limits of the <a href="/wiki/Structure_gauge" id="w">tunnel&#39;s dimensions</a>.</p>
<a id="Second_tunnel_(1995-present)" name="Second_tunnel_(1995-present)"></a><h1>Second tunnel (1995-present)</h1>

<p>By the early <a href="/wiki/1990s" id="w">1990s</a>, CN had commissioned engineering studies for a replacement tunnel to be built adjacent to the existing St. Clair River tunnel.  In <a href="/wiki/1992" id="w">1992</a>, new CN president <a href="/wiki/Paul_Tellier" id="w">Paul Tellier</a> foresaw that CN would increase its traffic in the <a href="/wiki/Toronto" id="w">Toronto</a>-<a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a> corridor.  The <a href="/wiki/Canada-U.S._Free_Trade_Agreement" id="w">Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement</a> was implemented in <a href="/wiki/1989" id="w">1989</a> and discussions for a <a href="/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement" id="w">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> between Canada, the United States and Mexico  discussions were underway at that time (NAFTA was implemented in <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>).  It was only logical that import/export traffic on CN&#39;s corridor would increase dramatically.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1993" id="w">1993</a> CN began construction of the newer and larger tunnel.  Tellier declared at the ceremonies:</p>
<p /><blockquote><i>&#34;[the] tunnel will give CN the efficiencies it needs to become a strong competitive force in North American transportation&#34;</i></blockquote>

<p>This tunnel was not hand dug from both ends like the first. A machine called the Excalibore made by the Lovat Tunnel Equipment Inc was used. It started on the Canadian side and made its way to the US. </p>
<p>The tunnel opened later in <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a> whereby freight and passenger trains stopped using the adjacent original tunnel, whose bore was sealed.  The new tunnel was dedicated on <a href="/wiki/May_5" id="w">May 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a> and measures {{convert}} from portal to portal with a bore diameter of 27 feet, 6 inches (8.4 m) with a single standard gauge track.  It could accommodate all freight cars currently in service in North America, thus the rail ferries were also retired in <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a> at the time of the tunnel&#39;s completion and opening for service.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_30" id="w">November 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, CN announced that the new St. Clair River tunnel would be named the <b>Paul M. Tellier Tunnel</b> in honour of the company&#39;s retired president, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Tellier" id="w">Paul Tellier</a>, who foresaw the impact the tunnel would have on CN&#39;s eastern freight corridor.  A sign now hangs over each tunnel portal with this name.</p>
