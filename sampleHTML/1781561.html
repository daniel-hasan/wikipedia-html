MNM was a professional wrestling stable in World Wrestling Entertainment that consisted of Joey Mercury (previously Joey Matthews), Johnny Nitro, and manager/valet Melina Perez.;; Though they broke up and reunited on one occasion, while together Mercury and Nitro were three time WWE Tag Team Champions;; and Melina was a one time WWE Women's Champion.;;

Their gimmick was that of a trio of Hollywood celebrities, complete with a red carpet ring entrance, that had them accompanied by &quot;paparazzi&quot;.;; Their group name was derived from the first letter of Mercury and Nitro's last names, along with the first letter of Melina's first.

History
=Ohio Valley Wrestling=
MNM was first put together in the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) &quot;farm territory&quot; Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). 
Melina Perez, Johnny Nitro's actual girlfriend, was introduced into the company as his ex-girlfriend, now siding with Matt Cappotelli with whom Nitro was engaged in a feud. Almost immediately, however, Perez turned on Cappotelli and re-sided with Nitro. Together they introduced Joey Matthews to become MNM.;; While in OVW, Nitro and Matthews won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship once, holding it for over two months.;;

=SmackDown!=
All three members of MNM were called up to the main WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown! roster on April 14, 2005, with Matthews undergoing a name change to Joey Mercury.;; They made their debut during the first ''Carlito's Cabana'' interview segment &quot;crashing&quot; an interview between Carly Colón|Carlito and WWE Tag Team Champion Rey Mysterio, attacking him to begin a feud with him and his partner, Eddie Guerrero over the Tag Team title.;; Two weeks later, in their debut match on the SmackDown! brand, they won the title from Mysterio and Guerrero after Guerrero walked out in the middle of the match.;; While Nitro and Mercury held the championship Melina got involved with Heidenreich, publicly mocking him;; and being the impetus for an attack on him by Nitro and Mercury.;; During the attack he was saved by a returning Road Warrior Animal,; and together they challenged Mercury and Nitro at WWE The Great American Bash#2005|the Great American Bash, defeating them for the title.;;

The loss of the Tag Team Championship was seen as &quot;bad publicity&quot; by Melina so she introduced Jillian Hall, a (kayfabe) spin doctor to repair their image.;; Hall worked as something of a fourth member of MNM in addition to a &quot;PR agent&quot;. In addition to her (kayfabe) getting them a cover article in ''SmackDown! Magazine'' she helped Melina in her running feud with Torrie Wilson;; and managed Nitro and Mercury against Booker T and Sharmell Sullivan.;;;;;; In September, Hall left the group to join JBL, who'd just lost a match to the much smaller Rey Mysterio.;;

On October 28, Mercury and Nitro were placed into a List of professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Fatal Fourway tag team match against the Mexicools (Super Crazy and Psicosis); William Regal &amp; Paul Birchall; and the WWE Tag Team Champions Road Warriors#L.O.D. 2005|L.O.D. 2005 (Heidenreich and Road Warrior Animal) and after The Dicks (Chad and James) interfered were able to hit Heidenreich with #In wrestling|the Snapshot and win the title for a second time.;; This time they only held the belt for two months, losing them to a teaming of Batista and Rey Mysterio on December 16.;; Before the match where they lost the championship Melina attempted to convince Batista to cancel it by bribing him with sex, only to have him thank her for &quot;the warm up&quot;.; Two weeks later Mark Henry was added to the group as Melina's bodyguard, after she claimed she felt she had been sexually harassed and promptly helped MNM win the title back.;; Henry was only with the group a short time before his contract was (kayfabe) sold to Daivari.;;

Throughout April of 2006 MNM found themselves in a losing streak against the team of Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In non-title tag team matches, singles matches, and even a Tag team#Tag team match rules|six man tag match London and Kendrick seemed to always have Mercury and Nitro's number.;;;;;; At May's Judgment Day MNM were defeated by London and Kendrick again, but this time in a title match.;; After the Melina and Nitro turned on Mercury, assaulting him and breaking up MNM.; Later in the same night Melina lost to former associate Jillian Hall in a match with a controversial ending, prompting her to complain to SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long -- and eventually slap him -- which got both her and Nitro (kayfabe) fired from the brand, sending them to RAW.;; In actuality Mercury was about to begin serving a suspension for violating the WWE Wellness program.;

=Reunion=
After a brief stint back in OVW, Joey Mercury returned to WWE, reuniting MNM, in late November 2006 to answer an open challenge put out by The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) for the December to Dismember pay-per-view.;; Back together they finally defeated London and Kendrick on an episode of ''SmackDown!'',;; but lost to the Hardys at December to Dismember.;; MNM and the Hardys met again at WWE Armageddon#2006|Armageddon as part of a Fatal Four Way Ladder match, which also included the teams of Dave Taylor &amp; William Regal and Paul London and Brian Kendrick.;; During the match, which saw London and Kendrick retain, Mercury was (legitimately) injured when he was stuck in the face with a ladder, necessitating a trip to the emergency room where his broken nose received 15 stitches.;; The facial injury was worked into the angle, and when Mercury returned (wearing a protective covering on his face) the rivalry between the teams intensified with MNM actively seeking to injure one or both of the Hardys, even going so far as to attack and #In wrestling|Snapshot Matt on exposed concrete after a match.;;

On March 26, 2007, WWE.com announced the release of Joey Mercury, ending MNM as a tag team.;; Melina and Nitro's association began to fizzle out when Melina become the WWE Women's Champion and began garnering attention as a singles performer. For a short time Nitro took up with Kenny Dykstra as a partner,;;;; until the Supplemental Draft placed Nitro on the ECW brand, Dykstra on SmackDown!, and Melina remained on RAW.;;;

*Ring entrance
**After their entrance music starts playing, members of the &quot;paparazzi&quot; come out, placing a red carpet for MNM to walk on. As they walk, the paparazzi takes photos of them in exaggerated Hollywood movie premier fashion. 
**The male members of MNM usually wore fur coats to the ring. As they take them off, Melina suggestively rubs their six packs while removing the title belts from their pants, where they hang in an exaggerated phallic fashion.
