The <b>intelligent design movement</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Neo-creationist" id="w">neo-creationist</a> religious campaign that calls for broad social, academic and political changes derived from the concept of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Intelligent_design" id="w">intelligent design</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ForrestMayPaper_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ForrestMayPaper" title="">[2]</a></sup> Chief amongst its activities are a campaign to promote public awareness of this concept, the <a href="/wiki/Lobbying" id="w">lobbying</a> of policymakers to include its teaching in <a href="/wiki/High_school" id="w">high school</a> <a href="/wiki/Science" id="w">science</a> classes, and legal action, either to defend such teaching or to remove barriers otherwise preventing it.<sup id="_ref-wedge strategy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wedge strategy" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The movement arose out of the previous <a href="/wiki/Christian_fundamentalism" id="w">Christian fundamentalist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Evangelicalism" id="w">evangelistic</a> <a href="/wiki/Creation_science" id="w">creation science</a> movement in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The overall goal of the intelligent design movement is to &#34;overthrow materialism&#34; and <a href="/wiki/Atheism" id="w">atheism</a>. Its proponents believe that society has suffered &#34;devastating cultural consequences&#34; from adopting materialism and that science is the cause of the decay into materialism because science seeks only natural explanations. Science is therefore atheistic, the movement&#39;s proponents claim. Proponents believe that the theory of evolution implies that humans have no spiritual nature, no moral purpose, and no intrinsic meaning. The movement&#39;s proponents seek to &#34;defeat [the] <a href="/wiki/Materialism" id="w">materialist</a> <a href="/wiki/World_view" id="w">world view</a>&#34; represented by the theory of <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolution</a> in favor of &#34;a science consonant with <a href="/wiki/Christian" id="w">Christian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theism" id="w">theistic</a> convictions&#34;.<sup id="_ref-wedge strategy_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wedge strategy" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>To achieve their goal of defeating a materialistic world view, advocates of intelligent design take a two-pronged approach. Alongside the promotion of intelligent design, proponents also seek to &#34;<a href="/wiki/Teach_the_Controversy" id="w">Teach the Controversy</a>&#34;; discredit evolution by emphasizing &#34;flaws&#34; in the theory of evolution, or &#34;disagreements&#34; within the scientific community and encourage teachers and students to explore non-scientific &#34;alternatives&#34; to evolution, or to &#34;critically analyze&#34; evolution and &#34;the controversy&#34;. But the world&#39;s largest general scientific society, the <a href="/wiki/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science" id="w">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>, has stated that &#34;There is no significant controversy within the scientific community about the validity of evolution.&#34; and that &#34;Evolution is one of the most robust and widely accepted principles of modern science.&#34;<sup id="_ref-ttc_aaas_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ttc_aaas" title="">[6]</a></sup> The ruling in the Dover trial, <a href="/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District" id="w">Kitzmiller v.

<a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a><h2> Overview </h2>
<p>The intelligent design movement primarily campaigns on two fronts: a <a href="/wiki/Public_relations" id="w">public relations</a> campaign meant to influence the popular <a href="/wiki/Mass_media" id="w">media</a> and sway <a href="/wiki/Opinion_of_the_public" id="w">public opinion</a>; and an aggressive lobbying campaign to cultivate support for the teaching of intelligent design amongst policymakers and the wider educational community. Both these activities are largely funded and directed by the Discovery Institute, from national to <a href="/wiki/Grassroots" id="w">grassroots</a> levels. The movement&#39;s first goal is to establish an acceptance of intelligent design at the expense of <a href="/wiki/Creation_and_evolution_in_public_education" id="w">evolution in public school science</a>; its long-term goal is no less than the &#34;renewal&#34; of American culture through the shaping of public policy to reflect conservative Christian values. As the Discovery Institute states, intelligent design is central to this agenda: &#34;Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.&#34;</p>
<p>The Discovery Institute has also relied on several polls to indicate the acceptance of intelligent design. A 2005 Harris poll identified ten percent of adults in the United States as taking what they called the intelligent design position, that &#34;human beings are so complex that they required a powerful force or intelligent being to help create them&#34;. (64% agreed with the creationist view that &#34;human beings were created directly by God&#34; and 22% believed that &#34;human beings evolved from earlier species&#34;. However, 49% accepted plant and animal evolution, while 45% did not.)<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Although some polls commissioned by the Discovery Institute show more support, these polls have been criticized as suffering from considerable flaws, such as having a low response rate (248 out of 16,000), being conducted on behalf of an organization with an expressed interest in the outcome of the poll, and containing leading questions.<sup id="_ref-Polling_for_ID_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Polling_for_ID" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critics of intelligent design and its movement contend that intelligent design is a specific form of creationism, <a href="/wiki/Neo-creationism" id="w">neo-creationism</a>, a viewpoint rejected by intelligent design advocates. It was bolstered by the 2005 ruling in <a href="/wiki/United_States_federal_courts" id="w">United States federal court</a> that a public school district requirement for science classes to teach that intelligent design is an alternative to evolution was a violation of the <a href="/wiki/Establishment_Clause" id="w">Establishment Clause</a> of the <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">First Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>. In <i><a href="/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District" id="w">Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</a></i> (2005), <a href="/wiki/United_States_district_court" id="w">United States District Judge</a> <a href="/wiki/John_E._Jones_III" id="w">John E. Jones III</a> <a href="http://sources.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/6:Curriculum%2C_Conclusion">also ruled</a> that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature.</p>
<p>In pursuing the goal of establishing intelligent design at the expense of evolution in public school science, intelligent design groups have threatened and isolated high school science teachers, schoolboard members and parents who opposed their efforts.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> Responding to the well-organized curricular challenges of intelligent design proponents to local school boards have been disruptive and divisive in the communities where they&#39;ve taken place. The campaigns run by intelligent design groups place teachers in the difficult position of arguing against their employers while the legal challenges to local school districts are costly and divert scarce funds away from education into court battles. Although these court battles have almost invariably resulted in the defeat of intelligent design proponents, they are draining and divisive to local schools. For example, as a result of <a href="/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District" id="w">Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</a> trial, the Dover Area School District was forced to pay $1,000,011 in legal fees and damages for pursuing a policy of <i>teaching the controversy</i> - presenting intelligent design as an allegedly scientific alternative to evolution.
<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Legal_arms" name="Legal_arms"></a><h3>Legal arms</h3>
<p>The movement&#39;s de facto legal arm is the <a href="/wiki/Thomas_More_Law_Center" id="w">Thomas More Law Center</a>. This has played a central role in defending against legal objections to the teaching of intelligent design in public school science classes, generally brought on <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment" id="w">First Amendment</a> grounds. The center has also participated as a plaintiff to remove legal barriers to the teaching of intelligent design as science. Similar legal foundations, the <a href="/wiki/Alliance_Defense_Fund" id="w">Alliance Defense Fund</a> and <a href="/wiki/Quality_Science_Education_for_All" id="w">Quality Science Education for All</a> (QSEA), have also litigated extensively on behalf of the movement. Though much smaller in scale than the Thomas More Law Center, in its first year of existence (2005) QSEA has brought no fewer than three separate lawsuits to further the intelligent design movement&#39;s agenda. Critics have suggested that if it were to continue its pattern of litigation, QSEA could be considered a <a href="/wiki/Vexatious_litigation" id="w">vexatious litigant</a>.</p>
<a id="''Teach_the_Controversy''" name="''Teach_the_Controversy''"></a><h3>&#39;&#39;Teach the Controversy&#39;&#39;</h3>
<p>The movement&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Teach_the_Controversy" id="w">Teach the Controversy</a></i> campaign is designed to portray evolution as &#34;a theory in crisis&#34; and to imply that the scientific establishment attempts to stifle or suppress discoveries that support intelligent design. The movement thereby tries to invoke or promote a distrust of science and scientists, especially where currents of <a href="/wiki/Anti-intellectualism" id="w">anti-intellectualism</a> are already present. In response to such criticism, campaigners claim they are confronting both the limitations of scientific orthodoxy and <a href="/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)" id="w">naturalism</a>. Whatever the motivation, the intelligent design movement has attracted considerable press attention and pockets of public support, especially among conservative American Christians.</p>
<a id="Criticism" name="Criticism"></a><h3>Criticism</h3>
<p>According to critics of the intelligent design movement, the movement&#39;s purpose is political rather than scientific or educational. They claim the movement&#39;s &#34;activities betray an aggressive, systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design creationism, but the religious worldview that undergirds it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Intelligent design is an attempt to recast religious dogma in an effort to reintroduce the teaching of <a href="/wiki/Genesis" id="w">biblical</a> <a href="/wiki/Creationism" id="w">creationism</a> to public school science classrooms; the intelligent design movement is an effort to reshape American society into a theocracy, primarily through education. As evidence, critics cite the Discovery Institute&#39;s political activities, its &#34;<a href="/wiki/Wedge_strategy" id="w">Wedge strategy</a>&#34; and statements made by leading intelligent design proponents.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Scientific_community" id="w">scientific community</a>&#39;s position, as represented by the <a href="/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences" id="w">National Academy of Sciences</a> and the <a href="/wiki/National_Center_for_Science_Education" id="w">National Center for Science Education</a>, is that intelligent design is not science, but <a href="/wiki/Creationism" id="w">creationist</a> <a href="/wiki/Pseudoscience" id="w">pseudoscience</a>. <a href="/wiki/Richard_Dawkins" id="w">Richard Dawkins</a>, a biologist and professor at Oxford University, compares the intelligent design movement&#39;s demand to &#34;teach the controversy&#34; with the demand to teach <a href="/wiki/Flat_earth" id="w">flat earthism</a>; acceptable in terms of history, but not in terms of science. &#34;If you give the idea that there are two schools of thought within science, one that says the earth is round and one that says the earth is flat, you are misleading children.&#34;<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Origin_of_the_movement" name="Origin_of_the_movement"></a><h2> Origin of the movement </h2>
<p>The intelligent design movement grew out of a creationist tradition which argues against evolutionary theory from a religious standpoint, usually an <a href="/wiki/Evangelicalism" id="w">evangelical</a> or <a href="/wiki/Christian_fundamentalism" id="w">fundamentalistic Christianity</a>. Although intelligent design advocates often claim that they are arguing only for the existence of a &#34;designer&#34; who may or may not be God, all the movement&#39;s leading advocates believe that this designer is God. They frequently accompany their arguments with a discussion of religious issues, especially when addressing religious audiences, but elsewhere downplay the religious aspects of their agenda.</p>
<a id="The_aftermath_of_Epperson_v._Arkansas" name="The_aftermath_of_Epperson_v._Arkansas"></a><h3>The aftermath of Epperson v. Arkansas</h3>
<p>In 1987, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court" id="w">United States&#39; Supreme Court</a> decision regarding <a href="/wiki/Edwards_v._Aguillard" id="w">Edwards v. Aguillard</a> effectively removed the teaching off <a href="/wiki/Creation_science" id="w">Creation science</a> creationism in public school science classrooms. As an immediate consequence, the draft of the creation science high school biology textbook <i><a href="/wiki/Of_Pandas_and_People" id="w">Of Pandas and People</a></i>, which  had already been phrased to circumvent the restrictions of the 1968 <a href="/wiki/Epperson_v._Arkansas" id="w">Epperson v. Arkansas</a> and 1975 <a href="/wiki/Daniel_v._Waters" id="w">Daniel v. Waters</a> rulings by presenting a creationism without reference to the book of <i><a href="/wiki/Genesis" id="w">Genesis</a></i> or to Christian tenets,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> was altered in 1987 so that all references to &#34;creation&#34; or &#34;creationism&#34; were changed to &#34;intelligent design&#34;.<sup id="_ref-bfkitz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bfkitz" title="">[27]</a></sup> In 1988, one of its editors, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Thaxton" id="w">Charles Thaxton</a>, passed the phrase &#34;intelligent design&#34; on to <a href="/wiki/Steven_Meyer" id="w">Steven Meyer</a>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1989 <i><a href="/wiki/Of_Pandas_and_People" id="w">Of Pandas and People</a></i> was published by the <a href="/wiki/Foundation_for_Thought_and_Ethics" id="w">Foundation for Thought and Ethics</a>,<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> with the definition that &#34;Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency, with their distinctive features already intact. Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, wings, etc.&#34;<sup id="_ref-bfkitz_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bfkitz" title="">[27]</a></sup> The publisher got church groups and Christian radio to campaign for school boards to adopt the book, with a petition in <a href="/wiki/Alabama" id="w">Alabama</a> urging that &#34;Intelligent Design&#34; be presented as an alternative to evolution, and their attorney arguing that it did not compel belief in the supernatural and was not a creationist text.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Of Pandas and People</i> and subsequent intelligent design publications present a creationism which argues that &#34;the origin of new organisms [is] in an immaterial cause: in a blueprint, a plan, a pattern, devised by an intelligent agent&#34;, but without making explicit reference to the identity of such an agent. In this way, it was hoped that violation of the United States&#39; <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment" id="w">First Amendment</a> would be avoided.</p>
<a id="Johnson_and_the_wedge_strategy" name="Johnson_and_the_wedge_strategy"></a><h3>Johnson and the wedge strategy</h3>
<p>An earlier book, <i><a href="/wiki/Evolution:_A_Theory_in_Crisis" id="w">Evolution: A Theory in Crisis</a></i> written by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Denton" id="w">Michael Denton</a> and published in 1985, is cited by Phillip E. Johnson as having convinced him of the problems with the theory of evolution, the <a href="/wiki/Scientific_method" id="w">scientific method</a> and its <a href="/wiki/Epistemology" id="w">epistemological</a> underpinnings. Starting with his 1991 book <i><a href="/wiki/Darwin_on_Trial" id="w">Darwin on Trial</a></i>, these have been the themes Johnson pursues in his books, speeches and debates. </p>
<p>Prior to the publication of <i>Darwin on Trial</i>, Johnson met <a href="/wiki/Stephen_C._Meyer" id="w">Stephen C. Meyer</a>, now a Director at the Discovery Institute. Through Meyer, Johnson met others who were developing what became the intelligent design movement, including Michael Denton. Johnson became the de facto leader of the group and its campaign.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> This group formed and continue to operate through the Discovery Institute&#39;s Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (CSRC, now the <a href="/wiki/Center_for_Science_and_Culture" id="w">Center for Science and Culture</a>, CSC). Johnson says that by the time <i>Darwin on Trial</i> was published (1991), he had mostly worked out the strategy that he thought would win, in time, the intelligent design movement&#39;s campaign. He further claims that he was able to convince those creationist educators who had been unseated by the <a href="/wiki/Edwards_v._Aguillard" id="w">Edwards v. Aguillard</a> ruling, along with <a href="/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism" id="w">young-earth creationists</a> and some <a href="/wiki/Old_Earth_creationism" id="w">old-earth creationists</a>, that his strategy was the best way forward.</p>
<p>According to Johnson, the wedge strategy, if not the term, began in 1992:

<p>The movement&#39;s strategy as set forth by Johnson states the replacement of &#34;materialist science&#34; with &#34;theistic science&#34; as its primary goal; and, more generally, for intelligent design to become &#34;the dominant perspective in science&#34; and to &#34;permeate our religious, cultural, moral and political life.&#34; This agenda is now being actively pursued by the <a href="/wiki/Center_for_Science_and_Culture" id="w">Center for Science and Culture</a> (CSC), which plays the leading role in the promotion of intelligent design. Its fellows include most of the leading intelligent design advocates: <a href="/wiki/William_A._Dembski" id="w">William A. Dembski</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Behe" id="w">Michael Behe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Wells" id="w">Jonathan Wells</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stephen_C._Meyer" id="w">Stephen C. Meyer</a>. </p>
<p>Intelligent design has been described by its proponents as a &#34;big tent&#34; belief, one in which all theists united by a having some kind of creationist belief (but of differing opinions as regards details) can support. If successfully promoted, it would reinstate creationism in the teaching of science, after which debates regarding details could resume. In his 2002 article <i>Big Tent: Traditional Creationism and the Intelligent Design Community</i>,<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Discovery Institute fellow Paul A. Nelson credits Johnson for the &#34;big tent&#34; approach and for reviving creationist debate since the Edwards v. Aguillard decision. According to Nelson, &#34;The promise of the big tent of ID is to provide a setting where Christians and others may disagree amicably and fruitfully about how best to understand the natural world as well as scripture.&#34; </p>
<p>In his presentation to the 1999 Reclaiming America for Christ Conference, <i>How the Evolution Debate can be Won</i>, Johnson affirmed this &#34;big tent&#34; role for &#34;The Wedge&#34; (without using the term intelligent design):</p>

<p>The Discovery Institute consistently denies allegations that its intelligent design agenda has religious foundations, and downplays the religious source of much of its funding. In an interview of <a href="/wiki/Stephen_C._Meyer" id="w">Stephen C. Meyer</a> when ABC News&#39;asked about the Discovery Institute&#39;s many evangelical Christian donors the institute&#39;s public relations representative stopped the interview saying &#34;I don&#39;t think we want to go down that path.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Intelligent_design_and_the_scientific_community" name="Intelligent_design_and_the_scientific_community"></a><h3>Intelligent design and the scientific community</h3>
<p>Intelligent design advocates realize that their arguments have little chance of acceptance within the mainstream scientific community, so they direct them toward politicians, philosophers and the general public.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup>  What prima facie &#34;scientific&#34; material they have produced has been attacked by critics as containing factual misrepresentation and misleading, <a href="/wiki/Rhetoric" id="w">rhetorical</a> and equivocal terminology. A number of pseudoscientific <a href="/wiki/Documentary_film" id="w">documentaries</a> that present intelligent design as an increasingly well-supported line of scientific inquiry have been made.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> The bulk of the material produced by the intelligent design movement, however, is not intended to be scientific but rather to promote its social and political aims.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Polls indicate that intelligent design&#39;s main appeal to citizens comes from its link to religious concepts. </p>
<p>An August 2005 poll from The Pew Forum on Religion &#38; Public Life showed 64% of Americans favoring the teaching of creationism along with evolution in science classrooms, though only 38% favored teaching it instead of evolution, with the results varying deeply by education level and religiosity. The poll showed the educated were far less attached to intelligent design than the less educated.  Evangelicals and fundamentalists showed high rates of affiliation with intelligent design while other religious persons and the secular were much lower.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Scientists responding to a poll overwhelmingly said intelligent design is about religion, not science. A 2002 sampling of 460 Ohio science professors had 91% say it&#39;s primarily religion, 93% say there is not &#34;any scientifically valid evidence or an alternative scientific theory that challenges the fundamental principle of the theory of evolution,&#34; and 97% say that they did not use intelligent design concepts in their own research.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In October and November 2001 the Discovery Institute advertised <i><a href="/wiki/A_Scientific_Dissent_From_Darwinism" id="w">A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism</a></i> listing what they claimed were &#34;100 scientific dissenters&#34; who had signed a statement that &#34;We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.&#34;<sup id="_ref-di_dissent_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-di_dissent" title="">[44]</a></sup> Shortly afterwards the <a href="/wiki/National_Center_for_Science_Education" id="w">NCSE</a> described the wording as misleading, noting that a minority of the signatories were biologists and some of the others were engineers, mathematicians and philosophers, and that some signatories did not fully support the Discovery Institute&#39;s claims.

<p>{{shorten}}
The movement was launched by the publication of <i><a href="/wiki/Of_Pandas_and_People" id="w">Of Pandas and People</a></i> in 1989,<sup id="_ref-pandafounds_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pandafounds" title="">[46]</a></sup> complete with public campaigning and pressure on school boards and teachers to introduce &#34;intelligent design&#34; into public schools.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Phillip_E._Johnson" id="w">Phillip E. Johnson</a>&#39;s book <i><a href="/wiki/Darwin_on_Trial" id="w">Darwin on Trial</a></i> in 1991 mentioned <i>Pandas</i> as &#34;&#39;creationist&#39; only in the sense that it juxtaposes a paradigm of &#39;intelligent design&#39; with the dominant paradigm of (naturalistic) evolution&#34;, but his use of the term as a focus for his <a href="/wiki/Wedge_strategy" id="w">wedge strategy</a> promoting &#34;<a href="/wiki/Theistic_realism" id="w">theistic realism</a>&#34; came later. The intelligent design movement began to take its present shape and course in 1996 with the forming of the Discovery Institute&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Center_for_Science_and_Culture" id="w">Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture</a> (CRSC), now known as the &#34;Center for Science and Culture&#34; (CSC). Johnson, a law professor whose religious conversion catalyzed his anti-evolution efforts, assembled a group of like-minded supporters who promote intelligent design through their writings, financed by CSC fellowships. According to its early mission statement, the CRSC sought &#34;nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and its damning cultural legacies.&#34; </p>
<p>Principal intelligent design proponents have stated a unified goal of greatly undermining or eliminating altogether the <a href="/wiki/Creation_and_evolution_in_public_education" id="w">teaching of evolution in public school science</a> and to also secure recognition of creationists claims of scientific legitimacy by opening the door to <a href="/wiki/Supernatural" id="w">supernatural</a> explanations. Implicit in this goal and stated explicitly in many policy statements is a redefinition of science, which categorically rejects explanations that are not verifiable. By necessity this entails the elimination of the teaching of evolution, which is also central to the larger agenda by <a href="/wiki/Christian_right" id="w">Christian conservatives</a> to gradually alter the legal and social landscape in the United States. The method by which this goal is to be achieved advocated by leading intelligent design proponents is the discrediting and removal of what they term &#34;methodological naturalism&#34; as a tenet of science. The movement&#39;s governing goals, as stated in the opening paragraph of the <a href="/wiki/Wedge_strategy" id="w">Wedge strategy</a>, are to defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies; and to replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Phillip_E._Johnson" id="w">Phillip E. Johnson</a>, largely regarded as the leader of the movement, positions himself as a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Theistic_realism" id="w">theistic realist</a>&#34; against &#34;<a href="/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)" id="w">methodological naturalism</a>&#34; and intelligent design as the method through which <a href="/wiki/God" id="w">God</a> created <a href="/wiki/Life" id="w">life</a>.<sup id="_ref-johnson_theistic_realist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-johnson_theistic_realist" title="">[48]</a></sup> Johnson explicitly calls for intelligent design proponents to obfuscate their religious motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design recognized &#34;as just another way of packaging the <a href="/wiki/Evangelical_Christianity" id="w">Christian evangelical message</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-johnson_evangelical_message_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-johnson_evangelical_message" title="">[49]</a></sup> Hence intelligent design arguments are carefully formulated in <a href="/wiki/Secular" id="w">secular</a> terms and intentionally avoid positing the identity of the designer. Johnson has stated that cultivating ambiguity by employing secular language in arguments which are carefully crafted to avoid overtones of <a href="/wiki/Theism" id="w">theistic</a> <a href="/wiki/Creationism" id="w">creationism</a> is a necessary first step for ultimately introducing the Christian concept of God as the designer. Johnson emphasizes &#34;the first thing that has to be done is to get the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a> out of the discussion&#34; and that &#34;after we have separated <a href="/wiki/Scientific_materialism" id="w">materialist</a> prejudice from <a href="/wiki/Data" id="w">scientific fact</a>.&#34; only then can &#34;biblical issues&#34; be discussed.<sup id="_ref-johnson_bible_out_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-johnson_bible_out" title="">[50]</a></sup> In the foreword to <i>Creation, Evolution, &#38; Modern Science</i> (2000) Johnson writes &#34;The intelligent design movement starts with the recognition that &#34;In the beginning was the Word.&#34; and &#34;In the beginning God created.&#34; Establishing that point isn&#39;t enough, but it is absolutely essential to the rest of the gospel message.&#34;</p>
<p>Though not all intelligent design proponents are theistic or motivated by religious fervor, the majority of the principal intelligent design advocates (including Michael Behe, William Dembski, Jonathan Wells, and Stephen C. Meyer) are <a href="/wiki/Christians" id="w">Christians</a> and have stated that in their view the intelligent designer is clearly God. The response of intelligent design proponents to critics and media who discuss their religious motivations has been to cite it as proof of bias and part of a hostile agenda. The Discovery Institute provided the <a href="/wiki/Conservatism" id="w">conservative</a> <a href="/wiki/Accuracy_in_Media" id="w">Accuracy in Media</a> a file of complaints about the way their representatives have been treated by the media, especially by <a href="/wiki/National_Public_Radio" id="w">National Public Radio</a>. </p>
<p>In his keynote address at the &#34;Research and Progress in intelligent design&#34; (RAPID) conference held in 2002 at <a href="/wiki/Biola_University" id="w">Biola University</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_A._Dembski" id="w">William A. Dembski</a> described intelligent design&#39;s &#34;dual role as a constructive scientific project and as a means for cultural renaissance.&#34; In a similar vein, the movement&#39;s hub, the Discovery Institute&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Center_for_Science_and_Culture" id="w">Center for Science and Culture</a> had until 2002 been the &#34;<i>Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture</i>&#34;. Explaining the name change, a spokesperson for the CSC insisted that the old name was simply too long. However, the change followed accusations that the center&#39;s real interest was not science but reforming culture along lines favored by conservative Christians. </p>
<p>Critics of movement cite the <a href="/wiki/Wedge_strategy" id="w">Wedge Document</a> as confirmation of this criticism and assert that the movement&#39;s leaders, particularly <a href="/wiki/Phillip_E._Johnson" id="w">Phillip E. Johnson</a>, view the subject as a <a href="/wiki/Culture_war" id="w">culture war</a>: &#34;<i>Darwinian evolution is not primarily important as a scientific theory but as a culturally dominant creation story ... When there is radical disagreement in a commonwealth about the creation story, the stage is set for intense conflict, the kind ... known as &#39;culture war.&#39; </i>&#34; </p>
<p>At the 1999 &#34;Reclaiming America for Christ Conference&#34;<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> called by Reverend <a href="/wiki/James_Kennedy_(televangelist)" id="w">D.

<p>Johnson cites the foundation of intelligent design is the <a href="/wiki/Bible" id="w">Bible</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Book_of_John" id="w">Book of John</a>, specifically, John 1:1: &#34;<i>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</i>&#34;</p>
<p>The main battlefield for this culture war has been <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">U.S.</a> regional and state <a href="/wiki/Board_of_education" id="w">school boards</a>. <a href="/wiki/Court" id="w">Courts</a> have also become involved as those campaigns to include intelligent design or weaken the teaching of evolution in <a href="/wiki/Public_school" id="w">public school</a> science <a href="/wiki/Curriculum" id="w">curricula</a> are challenged on <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment" id="w">First Amendment</a> grounds.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District" id="w">Kitzmiller v.

<p>Despite being primarily based in the United States, there have been efforts to introduce pro Intelligent Design teaching material into educational facilities in other countries. In the United Kingdom, the group &#39;Truth in Science&#39; has used material from the Discovery Institute to create free teaching packs which have been mass-mailed to all UK schools. <sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>  Shortly after this emerged, government ministers announced that they regarded intelligent design to be creationism and unsuitable for teaching in the classroom. They also announced that the teaching of the material in science classes was to be prohibited. <sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>Underscoring claims that the intelligent design movement is more religious and political enterprise than a scientific one, intelligent design has been in the center of a number of controversial political campaigns and legal challenges. These have largely been attempts to introduce intelligent design into public school science classrooms while concurrently portraying evolutionary theory as a theory largely disputed by science; as a &#34;theory in crisis&#34;. The claim that evolution is a &#34;theory in crisis&#34; is the centerpiece of the movement&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Teach_the_Controversy" id="w">Teach the Controversy</a></i> campaign. </p>
<p>Often cited as proof<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> that evolution is indeed a &#34;theory in crisis&#34; is the Discovery Institute&#39;s petition <i>A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism</i>.<sup id="_ref-di_dissent_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-di_dissent" title="">[44]</a></sup> to appeal to a broader, a more secular audience. It hopes to accomplish this by using less overtly theistic messages and language.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> Despite this, the Center for Science and Culture still states as a goal a redefinition of science, and the philosophy on which it is based, particularly the exclusion of what it calls the &#34;unscientific principle of <a href="/wiki/Materialism" id="w">materialism</a>&#34;, and in particular the acceptance of what it calls &#34;the <a href="/wiki/Scientific_theory" id="w">scientific theory</a> of intelligent design&#34;.</p>
<p>According to Reason magazine, promotional materials from the Discovery Institute acknowledge that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Ahmanson_Jr.">Ahmanson</a> family donated $1.5 million to the Center for Science and Culture, then known as the Center for Renewal of Science and Culture, for a research and publicity program to &#34;unseat not just Darwinism but also Darwinism&#39;s cultural legacy&#34;. Mr. Ahmanson funds many causes important to the Christian religious right, including <a href="/wiki/Christian_Reconstructionism" id="w">Christian Reconstructionism</a>, whose goal is to place the U.S. &#34;under the control of biblical law.&#34;<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> Until 1995, Ahmanson sat on the board of the Christian reconstructionist Chalcedon Foundation.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_Wedge_strategy" name="The_Wedge_strategy"></a><h4>The Wedge strategy</h4>
<p>{{Main}}
The <b>Wedge strategy</b> first came to the general public&#39;s attention when a <a href="/wiki/Discovery_Institute" id="w">Discovery Institute</a> internal memo now known as the <b>&#34;Wedge Document&#34;</b><sup id="_ref-wedge_doc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wedge_doc" title="">[61]</a></sup> was leaked to the public. The document begins with &#34;the proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built.&#34; and then goes on to outline the movement&#39;s goal to exploit perceived discrepancies within evolutionary theory in order to discredit evolution and scientific materialism in general. Much of the strategy is directed toward the broader public, as opposed to the professional scientific community. The stated &#34;governing goals&#34; of the CSC&#39;s wedge strategy are:
</p><dl><dd>1. To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies</dd></dl><dl><dd>2. To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by <a href="/wiki/God" id="w">God</a>.</dd></dl>
<p>Critics of intelligent design movement argue that the wedge document and strategy demonstrate that the intelligent design movement is motivated purely by religion and political ideology and that the Discovery Institute as a matter of policy obfuscates its agenda. The Discovery Institute&#39;s official response was to characterize the criticism and concern as &#34;irrelevant,&#34; &#34;paranoid,&#34; and &#34;near-panic&#34; while portraying the wedge document as a &#34;fund-raising document.&#34;<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1992 Johnson commented:

<p>Johnson in his 1997 book <cite>Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds</cite> confirmed some of the concerns voiced by the movement&#39;s gainsayers:

<a id="Teach_the_Controversy" name="Teach_the_Controversy"></a><h4>Teach the Controversy</h4>
<p>{{main}}
<b>Teach the Controversy</b> is a controversial political-action campaign originating from the Discovery Institute that seeks to advance an education policy for US <a href="/wiki/Public_education" id="w">public schools</a> that introduces intelligent design to public school science curricula and seeks to redefine science to allow for supernatural explanations. Teach the Controversy proponents portray evolution as a &#34;theory in crisis.&#34;</p>
<p>The Teach the Controversy strategy arose because of the intelligent design movement&#39;s initial success. Enthusiastic <a href="/wiki/Grassroots" id="w">grassroots</a> proponents began to act on their own, often without the awareness of the movement&#39;s leadership. That, according to Discovery Institute officials, is what happened in 1999, when a new conservative majority on the Kansas Board of Education caught their potential allies at the institute off-guard by dropping all references to evolution from the state&#39;s science standards.</p>
<p>&#34;When there are all these legitimate scientific controversies, this was silly, outlandish, counterproductive,&#34; said <a href="/wiki/John_G._West" id="w">John G. West</a>, associate director of the CSC, said after he and his colleagues learned of that 1999 move in Kansas from newspaper accounts. &#34;We began to think, &#39;Look, we&#39;re going to be stigmatized with what everyone does if we don&#39;t make our position clear.&#39; &#34;</p>
<p>Out of this the Discovery Institute developed the &#34;Teach the Controversy&#34; approach, which endorses evolution as a staple of any biology curriculum — so long as criticism of Darwin is also in the lesson plan. This satisfied Christian conservatives but also appealed to Republican moderates and, under the First Amendment banner, much of the public (71 percent according to a Discovery Institute-commissioned Zogby poll in 2001).</p>
<p>The strategy of the Teach the Controversy campaign is to move from standards battles, to curriculum writing, to textbook adoption, while undermining the central positions of evolution in biology and methodological naturalism in science. The Discovery Institute is the primary organizer and promoter of the Teach the Controversy campaign, though it has recently adopted the tactic of remaining behind the scenes and orchestrating, underwriting and otherwise supporting local campaigns, intelligent design groups, and proponents to act on its behalf in lobbying state and local politicians and schoolboards. The Teach the Controversy campaign is identified by the Discovery Institute principals as a central and necessary element in its Wedge strategy. </p>
<p>Critics contend that the controversy is manufactured. They note the strategy of intelligent design proponents appears to be to knowingly misuse or mis-describe a scientist&#39;s work, which prompts an angry rebuttal. Then, instead of dealing forthrightly with the charges leveled, they cite the rebuttal as evidence that there is a &#34;controversy&#34; to teach. Such a controversy is then self-fulfilling and self-sustaining, though completely without any legitimate basis in the academic world and without having to put forth a viable hypothesis as an alternative. In using this strategy, intelligent design proponents exploit the very technicality of the issues to their own advantage, counting on the public to miss the point in all the complex and difficult details. </p>
<p>As an example of the tactic in action, <a href="/wiki/William_A._Dembski" id="w">William Dembski</a>, one of the most vocal supporters of intelligent design, notes that he provoked Thomas Schneider, a biologist, into a response that Dembski characterizes as <i>&#34;some hair-splitting that could only look ridiculous to outsider observers.&#34;</i> What looks to scientists to be a very compelling rebuttal to Dembski&#39;s arguments made by Dr. Schneider is portrayed to non-scientists, and especially the public, as &#34;ridiculous hair-splitting.&#34;<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>Intelligent design&#39;s supporters and critics often portray the debate as between science and faith. These advocates imply that to support intelligent design is to support belief in higher power or powers, while to oppose intelligent design is to oppose belief in higher power or powers. One example is a statement from 
an article in the magazine <i><a href="/wiki/Focus_on_the_Family" id="w">Focus on the Family</a></i>, which holds that &#34;<a href="/wiki/Secularism" id="w">Secularists</a> have dismissed <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a> as an acceptable intellectual option&#34; and that &#34;intelligent design&#34; advocates promote their views on <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a>. </p>
<p>While science, faith and religion have been at odds to varying degrees throughout history, prominent scientists and religious leaders have tried to bridge that gap. Furthermore, critics of intelligent design have not only questioned whether intelligent design is good science, but also whether it is good <a href="/wiki/Theology" id="w">theology</a>. <a href="/wiki/Pope" id="w">Pope</a> <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II" id="w">John Paul II</a> issued the following statement:<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> 
{{quotation}} </p>
<p>Here, Pope John Paul II, affirming the teaching of the <a href="/wiki/Vatican_II" id="w">Vatican II</a> document <i><a href="/wiki/Gaudium_et_Spes" id="w">Gaudium et Spes</a></i> 36:1, suggests that science, philosophy and theology are not at odds, merely responsible for different sections of human knowledge.</p>

Intelligent design is an integral part of a political campaign by cultural conservatives, largely from evangelical religious convictions, that seek to redefine science to suit their own ideological agenda.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> Though numerically a minority of Americans,.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> the politics of intelligent design is based less on numbers than on intensive mobilization of ideologically committed followers and savvy <a href="/wiki/Public_relations" id="w">public relations</a> campaigns.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> Political repercussions from the culturally conservative sponsorship of the issue has been divisive and costly to the effected communities, polarizing and dividing not only those directly charged with educating young people but entire local communities. </p>
<p>With a doctrine that calls itself science among non-scientists but is rejected by the vast majority of the real practitioners, an amicable coexistence and collaboration between intelligent design advocates and upholders of mainstream  science education standards is rare. With mainstream scientific and educational organizations saying the theory of evolution is not &#34;in crisis&#34; or a subject doubted by scientists, nor intelligent design the emergent scientific paradigm or rival theory its proponents proclaim,<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> &#34;teaching the controversy&#34; is suitable for classes on politics, history, culture, or theology they say, but not science. By attempting to force the issue into science classrooms, intelligent design proponents create a charged environment that forces participants and bystanders alike to declare their positions, which has resulted in intelligent design groups threatening and isolating high school science teachers, school board members and parents who opposed their efforts.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> </p>

<a id="Intelligent_design_in_higher_education" name="Intelligent_design_in_higher_education"></a><h3>Intelligent design in higher education</h3>
<p>The battle to bring intelligent design and its social and political agenda the high school science classroom is well established. Bringing intelligent design to higher education is also an active part of Discovery Institute&#39;s strategy, though it has not taken the normal path of emergent scientific paradigms, through graduate schools and leading professional journals of science. It has been out of the question for intelligent design to be successfully introduced to the public via higher education venues and gain standing in such scientific courts as long as the evidence for evolution continues to grow in the view of the scientific community. The Discovery Institute acknowledges that if intelligent design is to become part of college and university science curricula, it will come to campus via students, their parents, sympathetic faculty, and the impositions of consumer-conscious college administrators. To that end the institute has supported &#39;IDEA&#39; intelligent design student groups<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> at various campuses,<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> and reports having faculty supporters on every university campus in this country including the <a href="/wiki/Ivy_League" id="w">Ivy League</a> schools. Academics who are Discovery Institute fellows include Robert Kaita of <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_F._Schaefer" id="w">Henry F.

Campus youth ministries play an active role in bringing intelligent design to university campuses through lectures by intelligent design leaders Phillip Johnson, William Dembski, Jonathan Wells, Michael Behe and others.

<p>The few university presses (such as Cambridge and Michigan State) that have published intelligent design books classify them as philosophy, rhetoric, or public affairs, not science.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup>. There are no peer-reviewed studies supporting intelligent design in the scientific research literature. With the scientific community as a whole unmoved or unconvinced by proponents&#39; works and rhetoric and the absence of intelligent design scientific research programs, Dembski conceded that &#34;the scientific research part&#34; of intelligent design is now &#34;lagging behind&#34; its success in influencing popular opinion. </p>
<p>In 2005 the American Association of University Professors issued a strongly worded statement asserting that the theory of evolution is nearly universally accepted in the community of scholars and critical of the intelligent design movement&#39;s attempts to weaken or undermine the teaching of evolution as &#34;inimical to principles of academic freedom.&#34;<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The authors of some college biology textbooks (with major mainstream textbook publishers) may find that someone at the publisher has linked the evolution chapters of a book&#39;s website to antievolution websites, so that the authors appear to support this point of view. {{Fact}}</p>
<p>The Discovery Institute organizes on-campus intelligent design conferences across the US for students. In the beginning, these were generally held at Christian universities and often sponsored by the administration or other faculty as an official university function. Lateron, <a href="/wiki/Yale" id="w">Yale</a> and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_San_Francisco" id="w">University of San Francisco</a> have seen proponents of intelligent design speak on their campuses. Not only did these succeed in reaching out to a more secular group of students, but the backdrop of prestigious universities achieved a goal set forth in the <a href="/wiki/Wedge_strategy" id="w">Wedge strategy</a>; to lend an aura of academic legitimacy to the proceedings and by extension, the intelligent design movement. Commenting on the Yale conference, for example, a student auxiliary of the <a href="/wiki/Access_Research_Network" id="w">Access Research Network</a> stated, &#34;Basically, the conference, beside being a statement (after all we were meeting at Yale University), proved to be very promising.&#34; These conferences were not sponsored by the universities at which they were held. They were sponsored by associated religious organizations — at Yale, the Rivendell Institute for Christian Thought and Learning.</p>
<a id="Intelligent_design_and_the_Web" name="Intelligent_design_and_the_Web"></a><h3>Intelligent design and the Web</h3>

<p>Much of the actual debate over intelligent design between intelligent design proponents and members of the scientific community has taken place on the Web, primarily blogs and message boards, instead of the scientific journals and symposia where traditionally much science is discussed and settled.  In promoting intelligent design the actions of its proponents have been more like a political pressure group than like researchers entering an academic debate as described by movement critic Taner Edis.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> In the absence of any verifiable scientific research program and concomitant debates in academic circles,<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup>  the most vibrant venues for intelligent design debate are websites such as Pandas Thumb <a class="externallink" href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.pandasthumb.org/">http://www.pandasthumb.org/</a>, Dembski&#39;s blogs at UncommonDescent.com <a class="externallink" href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.uncommondescent.com/">http://www.uncommondescent.com/</a> and DesignInference.com <a class="externallink" href="http://www.designinference.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.designinference.com/">http://www.designinference.com/</a> and the Discovery Institute&#39;s Evolutionnews.org <a class="externallink" href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.evolutionnews.org/">http://www.evolutionnews.org/</a> , often with  discussions and their various responses taking place on two or more sites at a time.</p>
<p>The Web again played an instrumental role in the controversy surrounding intelligent design when the  Discovery Institute&#39;s strategic memo, the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Wedge_strategy" id="w">Wedge Document</a>&#34; was leaked onto the Web in 1999. A broad attack on the foundations of the <a href="/wiki/Scientific_method" id="w">scientific method</a>, what it terms &#34;scientiﬁc materialism,&#34; the Wedge Document asserts that many of the moral woes in the world are the result of modern science, which has had &#34;devastating&#34; cultural consequences, such as the denial of objective moral standards and the undermining of religious belief. In contrast, the Wedge Document states that intelligent design &#34;promises to reverse the stiﬂing dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.&#34; In order to achieve this objective, the intelligent design movement will &#34;function as a &#39;wedge&#39;&#34; that will &#34;split the trunk [of scientiﬁc materialism] ... at its weakest points.&#34;<sup id="_ref-wedge_doc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wedge_doc" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>The leaking of the  Wedge Document put intelligent design proponents in an uncomfortable position by laying bare their strategy. At first the Discovery Institute disavowed the Wedge Document, then downplayed its importance, and finally acknowledged its origin with the institute and its role. All of this was played out on the Web against the backdrop of debates over public school textbook disclaimers, Teach the Controversy initiatives and the Dover trial. Discovery Institute representatives continue to balk at being judged on religious grounds and accuse those who probe their motivations of engaging in ad hominem attacks. Critics claim that given the express language of the Wedge Document, the Discovery’s ultimate agenda has far more to do with the renewal of religiously based culture by the overthrow of key tenets of modern science than with the disinterested pursuit of knowledge and that it is hard to see why they shouldn&#39;t take them at their own word.</p>
<p>The Web continues to play a central role in the Discovery Institute&#39;s strategy of promotion of intelligent design and it adjunct campaigns. On September 6, 2006, on the center&#39;s evolutionnews.org blog Discovery Institute staffer Casey Luskin published a post entitled &#34;Putting Wikipedia On Notice About Their Biased Anti-ID Intelligent Design Entries.&#34; There Luskin reprinted a letter from a reader complaining that he believed  Wikipedia&#39;s coverage of ID to be &#34;one sided&#34; and that pro-intelligent design editors were censored and attacked. Along with the letter Luskin published a Wikipedia email address for general information and urged readers to &#34;to contact Wikipedia to express your feelings about the biased nature of the entries on intelligent design.&#34;<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Dissent_within_the_movement" name="Dissent_within_the_movement"></a><h2>Dissent within the movement</h2>
<p>Under the guidance of the Discovery Institute the movement made significant inroads in its appeal to members of the public, if not the scientific community. That success manifested itself in grassroots local movements, who, to varying degrees, took up the cause with local politicians, school boards, parent-teacher groups and even individual legal actions to promote intelligent design in public schools. The <a href="/wiki/Thomas_More_Law_Center" id="w">Thomas More Law Center</a> along with the Discovery Institute has often provided resources for these local and regional efforts. Recently grassroots activity has gone beyond that endorsed by the Discovery Institute, which has voiced concern over the ability of mandates to teach intelligent design surviving a challenge on <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment" id="w">First Amendment</a> grounds and the implications for the movement were the teaching of intelligent design as science in public schools ruled unconstitutional. Such a ruling would have the effect of legally ruling intelligent design a form of religious <a href="/wiki/Creationism" id="w">creationism</a>, and greatly diminish any possibility of the movement ever achieving its goals set forth in the <a href="/wiki/Wedge_strategy" id="w">Wedge strategy</a>. Fearing that this was an inevitability, the Discovery Institute repositioned itself for tactical reasons against the teaching of intelligent design favoring a <a href="/wiki/Teach_the_Controversy" id="w">Teach the Controversy</a> strategy.</p>
<p>Just such a case occurred in 2004 in <a href="/wiki/Dover%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Dover, Pennsylvania</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District" id="w">Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</a>). The <a href="/wiki/Thomas_More_Law_Center" id="w">Thomas More Law Center</a> in its vigorous defense of the School District (whose board seats several staunch creationists who are intelligent design proponents), has run afoul of the movement&#39;s leadership at the Discovery Institute. </p>
<p>In a round table discussion entitled &#34;Science Wars: Should Schools Teach Intelligent Design?&#34;<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup> at the <a href="/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute" id="w">American Enterprise Institute</a> on 21 October 2005 and televised on <a href="/wiki/C-SPAN" id="w">C-SPAN</a>, the Discovery Institute&#39;s Mark Ryland and the Thomas More Law Center&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Richard_Thompson" id="w">Richard Thompson</a> had a frank disagreement, in which Ryland claimed the Discovery Institute has always cautioned against the teaching of intelligent design, and Thompson responded that the institute&#39;s leadership had not only advocated the teaching of intelligent design, but encouraged others to do so, and that the Dover Area School District had merely followed the institute&#39;s calls for action.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> As evidence Thompson cited the Discovery Institute&#39;s guidebook <i>Intelligent Design in Public School Science Curricula</i><sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup> written by the institute&#39;s director and co-founder, <a href="/wiki/Stephen_C._Meyer" id="w">Stephen C. Meyer</a> and David DeWolf, a fellow of the institute, which stated in its closing paragraphs: &#34;<i>Moreover, as the previous discussion demonstrates, school boards have the authority to permit, and even encourage, teaching about design theory as an alternative to Darwinian evolution -- and this includes the use of textbooks such as Of Pandas and People that present evidence for the theory of intelligent design.</i>&#34;</p>
<p>Rifts between factions within the movement&#39;s leadership and also between local and regional movement leaders and the national leadership are likely to increase considering the increasing number of pro-intelligent design amendments and proposals coming before state and local school boards, and legal actions brought by local proponents, such as <a href="/wiki/Quality_Science_Education_for_All" id="w">Quality Science Education for All</a>.</p>
<a id="Criticisms_of_the_movement" name="Criticisms_of_the_movement"></a><h2>Criticisms of the movement</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Intellectual_dishonesty" id="w">Intellectual dishonesty</a>, in the form of misleading impressions created by the use of rhetoric, intentional <a href="/wiki/Ambiguity" id="w">ambiguity</a>, and misrepresented evidence, is one of the most common criticisms of the movement and its leadership.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup>  It is alleged that its goal is to lead an unwary public to reach certain conclusions, and that many have been deceived as a result. Critics of the movement, such as <a href="/wiki/Eugenie_Scott" id="w">Eugenie Scott</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Pennock" id="w">Robert Pennock</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barbara_Forrest" id="w">Barbara Forrest</a>, claim that movement leaders, and the Discovery Institute specifically, knowingly misquote scientists and other experts, deceptively omit contextual text through <a href="/wiki/Ellipsis" id="w">ellipsis</a>, and make unsupported amplifications of relationships and credentials.</p>
<p>Critics claim that the institute uses academic credentials and affiliations opportunistically. In 2001, the Discovery Institute purchased advertisements in three national publications (the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Review_of_Books" id="w">New York Review of Books</a></i>, the <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Republic" id="w">New Republic</a></i> and the <i><a href="/wiki/Weekly_Standard" id="w">Weekly Standard</a></i>) to proclaim the adherence of approximately 100 scientists to the following statement: &#34;We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.&#34;</p>
<p>Such statements commonly note the institutional affiliations of signatories for purposes of identification. But this statement strategically listed either the institution that granted a signatory&#39;s PhD or the institutions with which the individual is presently affiliated. Thus the institutions listed for Raymond G. Bohlin, Fazale Rana, and Jonathan Wells, for example, were the University of Texas, Ohio University, and the University of California, Berkeley, where they earned their degrees, rather than their current affiliations: Probe Ministries for Bohlin, the Reasons to Believe ministry for Rana, and the Discovery Institute&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Center_for_Science_and_Culture" id="w">Center for Science and Culture</a> for Wells. During controversies over evolution education in Georgia, New Mexico, Ohio, and Texas, similarly confusing lists of local scientists were circulated.</p>
<p>In another instance, the Discovery Institute frequently mentions the <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize" id="w">Nobel Prize</a> in connection with Henry F. Schaefer, a Discovery Institute fellow, and chemist at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Georgia" id="w">University of Georgia</a>. Critics allege that Discovery Institute is inflating his reputation by constantly referring to him as a &#34;five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize&#34; because Nobel Prize nominations remain confidential for fifty years.</p>
<p>This criticism is not reserved for only the institute; individual intelligent design proponents have been accused of using their own credentials and those of others in a misleading or confusing fashion. For example, critics allege <a href="/wiki/William_A._Dembski" id="w">William Dembski</a> gratuitously invokes his laurels by boasting of his correspondence with a Nobel laureate, bragging that one of his books was published in a series whose editors include a Nobel laureate, and exulting that the publisher of the intelligent design book <cite>The Mystery of Life&#39;s Origin</cite>, Philosophical Library Inc., also published books by eight Nobel laureates. Critics claim that Dembski purposefully omits relevant facts which he fails to mention to his audience that in 1986, during the <a href="/wiki/Edwards_v._Aguillard" id="w">Edwards v. Aguillard</a> hearings, 72 Nobel laureates endorsed an <a href="/wiki/Amicus_curiae" id="w">amicus curiae</a> brief that noted that the &#34;evolutionary history of organisms has been as extensively tested and as thoroughly corroborated as any biological concept.&#34;</p>
<p>Another common criticism is that since no intelligent design research has been published in mainstream, peer-reviewed <a href="/wiki/Scientific_journal" id="w">scientific journals</a>, the Discovery Institute often misuses the work of mainstream scientists by putting out lists of articles that allegedly support their arguments for intelligent design drawing from mainstream scientific literature. Often, the original authors respond that their articles cited by the center don&#39;t support their arguments at all. Many times, the original authors have publicly refuted them for distorting the meaning of something they&#39;ve written for their own purposes.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin" id="w">University of Texas</a> <a href="/wiki/Molecular_biology" id="w">molecular biologist</a> Sahotra Sarkar, who has testified that intelligent design advocates, and specifically the Discovery Institute, has misused his work by misrepresenting its conclusions to bolster their own claims, has gone on to allege that the extent of the misrepresentations rises to the level of professional <a href="/wiki/Malfeasance" id="w">malfeasance</a>:<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup></p>

<p>An October 2005 conference called &#34;When Christians and Cultures Clash&#34; was held at the Pennsylvania Evangelical School of Theology. Attorney Randy Wenger, who is affiliated with the <a href="/wiki/Alliance_Defense_Fund" id="w">Alliance Defense Fund</a>, and a close ally of the Discovery Institute, and one of the presenters at the conference advocated the use of <a href="/wiki/Subterfuge" id="w">subterfuge</a> for advancing the movement&#39;s religious goals: &#34;But even with God’s blessing, it’s helpful to consult a lawyer before joining the battle. For instance, the <a href="/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District" id="w">Dover area school board</a> might have had a better case for the intelligent design disclaimer they inserted into high school biology classes had they not mentioned a religious motivation at their meetings.
