<p>The ARF became active within the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Ottoman Empire</a> in the early 1890s with the aim of unifying the various small groups in the empire that were advocating for reform and defending Armenian villages from massacres that were widespread in some of the Armenian-populated areas of the empire. ARF members formed <a href="/wiki/Fedayee" id="w">fedayee</a> groups that defended Armenian civilians through armed resistance.{{Ref_label}} The Dashnaks also worked for the wider goal of creating a &#34;free, independent and unified&#34; Armenia, although they sometimes set aside this goal in favor of a more realistic approach such as advocating autonomy. </p>
<p>In 1917, the party was instrumental in the creation of the short-lived <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Armenia" id="w">Democratic Republic of Armenia</a>, which fell to the <a href="/wiki/Soviet" id="w">Soviet</a> communists in 1920.<sup id="_ref-ARF.am_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ARF.am" title="">[7]</a></sup> After its leadership was exiled by the communists, the ARF established itself within Armenian diaspora communities, where it helped Armenians preserve their cultural identity.<sup id="_ref-ARF Shant Student Association_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ARF Shant Student Association" title="">[8]</a></sup> After the fall of the <a href="/wiki/USSR" id="w">USSR</a>, it returned to Armenia, where it now again has a significant presence.

<p>In the late 1800s, <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Europe" id="w">Eastern Europe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a> became the hub of small groups advocating reform in Armenian-populated areas in the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" id="w">Ottoman Empire</a>.

 The <a href="/wiki/Social_Democrat_Hunchakian_Party" id="w">Social Democrat Hunchakian Party</a> at one point had agreed to join as well, seeing that the ARF&#39;s political ideology was <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialism</a>. However, the Hunchakians claimed the new party was not <a href="/wiki/Marxist" id="w">Marxist</a> enough and withdrew from the union. The original aim of the ARF was to gain autonomy for the Armenian-populated areas in the Ottoman Empire. The party began to organize itself in the Ottoman Empire in the early 1890s and held its first major meeting in <a href="/wiki/Tiflis" id="w">Tiflis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" id="w">Russian Empire</a>, in 1892.<sup id="_ref-Foundation of the ARF_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Foundation of the ARF" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Origins of the ARF_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Origins of the ARF" title="">[9]</a></sup> At that meeting, the party adopted a decentralized <i>modus operandi</i> according to which the chapters in different countries were allowed to plan and implement policies in tune with their local political atmosphere. The party set its goal of a society based on the democratic principles of <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly" id="w">freedom of assembly</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_speech" id="w">freedom of speech</a>, <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_religion" id="w">freedom of religion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Agrarian_reform" id="w">agrarian reform</a>.<sup id="_ref-Foundation of the ARF_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Foundation of the ARF" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Origins of the ARF_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Origins of the ARF" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Russian_Empire" name="Russian_Empire"></a><h2> Russian Empire </h2>
<p>The ARF gradually acquired significant strength and sympathy among <a href="/wiki/Russian_Armenians" id="w">Russian Armenians</a>. Mainly because of the ARF&#39;s stance towards the Ottoman Empire, the party enjoyed the support of the central Russian administration, as <a href="/wiki/Tsarist" id="w">tsarist</a> and ARF foreign policy had the same alignment until 1903.<sup id="_ref-Anna Geifman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anna Geifman" title="">[10]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/June_12" id="w">June 12</a> <a href="/wiki/1903" id="w">1903</a>, the tsarist authorities passed an edict to bring all Armenian Church property under imperial control. This was faced by strong ARF opposition, because the ARF perceived the tsarist edict as a threat to the Armenian national existence. As a result, the ARF leadership decided to defend Armenian churches by dispatching militiamen who acted as guards and by holding mass demonstrations.<sup id="_ref-Anna Geifman_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Anna Geifman" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-tempest_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tempest" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1905–06, the <a href="/wiki/Armenian-Tatar_massacres" id="w">Armenian-Tatar massacres</a> broke out during which the ARF became involved in armed activities. Some sources claim that the Russian government incited the massacres in order to reinforce its authority during the revolutionary turmoil of 1905.<sup id="_ref-Stalin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stalin" title="">[12]</a></sup> The first outbreak of violence occurred in <a href="/wiki/Baku" id="w">Baku</a>, in February 1905. Some sources claim that it was caused by the murder of a <a href="/wiki/Muslim" id="w">Muslim</a> by the Dashnaks.<sup id="_ref-Tadeusz_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tadeusz" title="">[13]</a></sup> The ARF held the Russian authorities responsible for inaction and instigation of massacres that were part of a larger <a href="/wiki/Anti-Armenianism" id="w">anti-Armenian</a> policy. On <a href="/wiki/May_11" id="w">May 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1905" id="w">1905</a>, Dashnak revolutionary <a href="/wiki/Drastamat_Kanayan" id="w">Drastamat Kanayan</a> assassinated Russian governor general <a href="/wiki/Nakashidze" id="w">Nakashidze</a>, who was considered by the Armenian population as the main instigator of hate and confrontation between the Armenians and the Tatars. Unable to rely on government forces to protect their interests and properties, the Armenian bourgeoisie turned to the ARF for protection. The Dashnak leaders argued that, given employment discrimination against Armenian workers in non-Armenian concerns, the defence provided to the Armenian bourgeoisie was essential to the safekeeping of employment opportunities for Armenian laborers.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The Russian Tsar&#39;s envoy in the <a href="/wiki/Caucasus" id="w">Caucasus</a>, Vorontsov-Dashkov, reported that the ARF bore a major portion of responsibilities for perpetrating the massacres. According to him, their bands would attack the Muslims and often exterminate the population of entire villages.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> The ARF, however, argued that it helped to organize the defence of the Armenian population against Muslim attacks. The blows suffered at the hands of the Dashnakist fighting squads proved a catalyst for the consolidation of the Muslim community of the Caucasus.<sup id="_ref-Tadeusz_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tadeusz" title="">[13]</a></sup> During that period, the ARF regarded armed activity, including terror, as necessary for the achievement of political goals.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>In January 1912, 159 ARF members, comprised of lawyers, bankers, merchants and other intellectuals, were tried before the Russian senate for their participation in the party. They were defended by then-lawyer <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Kerensky" id="w">Alexander Kerensky</a>, who challenged much of the evidence used against them as the &#34;original investigators had been encouraged by the local administration to use any available means&#34; to convict the men.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Kerensky succeeded in having the evidence reexamined for one of the defendants. He and several other lawyers &#34;made openly contemptuous declarations&#34; about this discrepancy to the Russian press, which was forbidden to attend the trials, and this in turn greatly embarrassed the senators. The Senate eventually opened an inquiry against the chief <a href="/wiki/Magistrate" id="w">magistrate</a> who had brought the charges against the Dashnak members and concluded that he was insane. Ninety four of the accused were acquitted, while the rest were either imprisoned or exiled for varying periods, the most severe being six years.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

<p>The ARF became a major political force in Armenian life. It was especially active in the Ottoman Empire, where it organized or participated in many revolutionary activities. In 1894, the ARF took part in the <a href="/wiki/First_Sasun_Resistance" id="w">First Sasun Resistance</a>, supplying arms to the local population to help the people of Sasun defend themselves against the Hamidian purges.<sup id="_ref-Hayots p.42–48_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hayots p.42–48" title="">[19]</a></sup> In June 1896, the <a href="/wiki/Armenakan" id="w">Armenakans</a> organized the <a href="/wiki/Defense_of_Van" id="w">Defense of Van</a> in the province of <a href="/wiki/Van%2C_Turkey" id="w">Van</a>, where Ottoman <a href="/wiki/Hamidieh_soldier" id="w">Hamidieh soldiers</a> were to attack the city. The Armenakans, assisted by members of the Hunchakian and ARF parties, supplied all able-bodied men of Van with weapons.

 To raise awareness of the <a href="/wiki/Hamidian_massacres" id="w">massacres of 1895–96</a>, members of the Dashnaktsutiun led by <a href="/wiki/Papken_Siuni" id="w">Papken Siuni</a>, <a href="/wiki/1896_Ottoman_Bank_takeover" id="w">occupied the Ottoman Bank</a> in <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1896" id="w">1896</a>.<sup id="_ref-Bank Ottoman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bank Ottoman" title="">[21]</a></sup> The purpose of the raid was to dictate the ARF&#39;s demands of reform in the Armenian populated areas of the Ottoman Empire and to attract European attention to their cause since the Europeans had many assets in the bank. The operation caught European attention but at the cost of more massacres by Sultan <a href="/wiki/Abdul_Hamid_II" id="w">Abdul Hamid II</a>.<sup id="_ref-Modern Armenian history_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Modern Armenian history" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_30" id="w">March 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1904" id="w">1904</a>, the ARF played a major role in the <a href="/wiki/Second_Sasun_Resistance" id="w">Second Sasun Resistance</a>.

<p>In 1905, members of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation organized the <a href="/wiki/Yildiz_Attempt" id="w">Yildiz Attempt</a>, an assassination attempt on Sultan Abdul Hamid II in the capital of the Ottoman Empire, <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a> (modern day <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" id="w">Istanbul</a>).<sup id="_ref-Hayots p.42–48_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hayots p.42–48" title="">[19]</a></sup> The Yildiz Attempt failed to assassinate the Sultan because the timed bomb missed its target by a few minutes.

<p>Two of the largest revolutionary groups trying to overthrow Sultan Abdul Hamid II had been the ARF and the <a href="/wiki/Committee_of_Union_and_Progress" id="w">Committee of Union and Progress</a>, a group of mostly European-educated Turks.<sup id="_ref-Dashnaktsutiun and Committee of Union and Progress_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dashnaktsutiun and Committee of Union and Progress" title="">[26]</a></sup> In a general assembly meeting in 1907, the ARF acknowledged that the Armenian and <a href="/wiki/Turkish_people" id="w">Turkish</a> revolutionaries had the same goals. Although the <a href="/wiki/Tanzimat" id="w">Tanzimat</a> reforms had given Armenians more rights and seats in the parliament, the ARF hoped to gain autonomy to govern Armenian populated areas of the Ottoman Empire as a &#34;state within a state&#34;. The &#34;Second congress of the Ottoman opposition&#34; took place in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, in 1907.

<p>In 1908, Abdul Hamid II was overthrown during the <a href="/wiki/Young_Turk_Revolution" id="w">Young Turk Revolution</a>, which launched the <a href="/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Era_(Ottoman_Empire)" id="w">Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire</a>. Armenians gained more seats in the 1908 parliament, but the reforms fell short of the greater autonomy that the ARF had hoped for. The <a href="/wiki/Adana_massacre" id="w">Adana massacre</a> in 1909 also created antipathy between Armenians and Turks, and the ARF cut relations with the Young Turks in 1912.<sup id="_ref-ARF and Young Turks_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ARF and Young Turks" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

<p>As a result of the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Armenian, Georgian, and <a href="/wiki/Muslim" id="w">Muslim</a> leaders of the Caucasus united to create the <a href="/wiki/Transcaucasian_Federation" id="w">Transcaucasian Federation</a> in the winter of 1918. The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk" id="w">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a> had drastic consequences for the Armenians: Turkish forces reoccupied Western Armenia.

<p>With the collapse of the Transcaucasian Federation, the Armenians were left to fend for themselves as the Turkish army approached the capital of <a href="/wiki/Yerevan" id="w">Yerevan</a>.

The creation of the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Armenia" id="w">Democratic Republic of Armenia</a> (DRA) was proclaimed on the same day of the Battle of Sardarapat, and the ARF became the ruling party.

<p>The Armenian Revolutionary Federation had a strong presence in the DRA government. Most of the important government posts, such as prime minister, defence minister and interior minister were controlled by its members.

<p>After the communists took over the short-lived Democratic Republic of Armenia and ARF leaders were exiled, the Dashnaks moved their base of operations to where the <a href="/wiki/Armenian_diaspora" id="w">Armenian diaspora</a> had settled. With the large influx of Armenian refugees in the <a href="/wiki/Levant" id="w">Levant</a>, the ARF established a strong political structure in <a href="/wiki/Lebanon" id="w">Lebanon</a> and to a lesser extent, <a href="/wiki/Syria" id="w">Syria</a>.

<p>With political and geographic division came religious division. One part of the Armenian Church claimed it wanted to be separate from the head, whose seat was in <a href="/wiki/Echmiadzin" id="w">Echmiadzin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Armenian_SSR" id="w">Armenian SSR</a>. Some Armenians in the US thought <a href="/wiki/Moscow" id="w">Moscow</a> tried to use the Armenian Church to promote Communists&#39; ideas outside the country. The Armenian Church thus separated into two branches, Echmiadzin and Cilician, and started to operate separately. In the US, Echmiadzin branch churches of the <a href="/wiki/Armenian_Apostolic_Church" id="w">Armenian Apostolic Church</a> would not admit members of the ARF. This was one of the reasons why the ARF discouraged people from attending these churches and brought the representatives from a different wing of the church, the Armenian <a href="/wiki/Catholicate" id="w">Catholicate</a> of <a href="/wiki/Cilicia" id="w">Cilicia</a>, from Lebanon to the US.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> In 1933, Dashnaks were suspects in the assassination of Armenian <a href="/wiki/Archbishop" id="w">archbishop</a> <a href="/wiki/Levon_Tourian" id="w">Levon Tourian</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a>.

<p>During the 1950s, tensions arose between the ARF and Armenian SSR. The death of <a href="/wiki/Catholicos" id="w">Catholicos</a> Garegin of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See_of_Cilicia" id="w">Holy See of Cilicia</a> prompted a struggle for succession. The National Ecclesiastic Assembly, which was largely influenced by the ARF, elected <a href="/wiki/Zareh_of_Aleppo" id="w">Zareh of Aleppo</a>. This decision was rejected by the Echmiadzin-based <a href="/wiki/Catholicos_of_All_Armenians" id="w">Catholicos of All Armenians</a>, the anti-ARF coalition, and Soviet Armenian authorities. Zareh extended his administrative authority over a large part of the Armenian diaspora, furthering the rift that had already been created by his election.<sup id="_ref-Modern Armenian history_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Modern Armenian history" title="">[22]</a></sup> This event split the large <a href="/wiki/Armenians_of_Lebanon" id="w">Armenian community of Lebanon</a>, creating sporadic clashes between the supporters of Zareh and those who opposed his election.<sup id="_ref-Modern Armenian history_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Modern Armenian history" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Religious conflict was part of a greater conflict that raged between the two &#34;camps&#34; of the Armenian diaspora. The ARF still resented the fact that they were ousted from Armenia after the <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a> took control, and the ARF leaders supported the creation of a &#34;Free, Independent, and United Armenia&#34;, free from both Soviet and Turkish hegemony.

<p>From 1923 to 1958, conflicts erupted among Armenian political parties struggling to dominate and organize the diaspora. In 1926, a struggle between committees of the ARF and Hunchakian parties for control of the newly established shanty-town of <a href="/wiki/Bourj_Hammoud" id="w">Bourj Hammoud</a> in Lebanon led to the assassination of ARF member Vahan Vartabedian. As retaliation for the murder, Hunchakian members Mihran Aghazarian and S. Dekhrouhi were assassinated in 1929 and 1931 respectively.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> In 1956, when Bishop Zareh was consecrated Catholicos of Cilicia, the Catholicos of Echmiadzin refused to recognize his authority. This controversy polarized the Armenian community of Lebanon. As a result, in the context of the <a href="/wiki/Lebanon_crisis_of_1958" id="w">Lebanese civil strife of 1958</a>, an armed conflict erupted between supporters (the ARF) and opponents (Hunchakians, Ramgavars) of Zareh.<sup id="_ref-Modern Armenian history_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Modern Armenian history" title="">[22]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Prior to the <a href="/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War" id="w">Lebanese Civil War</a> of 1975–90, the party was closely allied to the <a href="/wiki/Kataeb_Party_(Lebanon)" id="w">Phalangist Party</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Gemayel" id="w">Pierre Gemayel</a> and generally ran joint tickets with the Phalangists, especially in <a href="/wiki/Beirut" id="w">Beirut</a> constituencies with large Armenian populations.<sup id="_ref-Armenians and Lebanon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Armenians and Lebanon" title="">[43]</a></sup> The refusal of the ARF, along with most Armenian groups, to play an active role in the civil war, however, soured relations between the two parties, and the <a href="/wiki/Lebanese_Forces" id="w">Lebanese Forces</a> (a militia dominated by Phalangists and commanded by <a href="/wiki/Bachir_Gemayel" id="w">Bachir Gemayel</a>, Pierre Gemayel&#39;s son), responded by attacking the Armenian quarters of many Lebanese towns, including Bourj Hammoud.<sup id="_ref-Armenians and Lebanon_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Armenians and Lebanon" title="">[43]</a></sup> Many Armenians affiliated with the ARF took up arms voluntarily to defend their quarters. In the midst of the Lebanese civil war, a shadowy guerrilla organization called <a href="/wiki/Justice_Commandos_Against_Armenian_Genocide" id="w">Justice Commandos Against Armenian Genocide</a> emerged and carried out a string of assassinations from 1975 to 1983. The guerrilla organization has sometimes been linked to the Dashnaks.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>A major change occurred in the parliamentary election of 2000. Negotiations to form a joint ticket between the ARF and the <a href="/wiki/Karama" id="w">Karama</a> (Dignity) party of <a href="/wiki/Rafik_Hariri" id="w">Rafik Hariri</a> broke down over Hariri&#39;s insistence that all candidates elected on his list, including ARF candidates, would have to form a unified parliamentary block subsequently—a rarity in <a href="/wiki/Politics_of_Lebanon" id="w">Lebanese politics</a>. This would make the Armenian vote in the Chamber subservient to Hariri&#39;s wishes.<sup id="_ref-Armenian and the 2000 Parliamentary elections in Lebanon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Armenian and the 2000 Parliamentary elections in Lebanon" title="">[45]</a></sup> In addition, Hariri refused the ARF proposal to choose an Armenian candidate for the sole seat allocated to Lebanon&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Protestant" id="w">Protestant</a> community (many of whom are ethnically Armenian), insisting that the seat should go to an ally of his.<sup id="_ref-Armenian and the 2000 Parliamentary elections in Lebanon_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Armenian and the 2000 Parliamentary elections in Lebanon" title="">[45]</a></sup> The ARF decided to go it alone, although other Armenian parties joined Hariri&#39;s list. In an unprecedented sweep, the Dignity movement and its allies captured 13 of Beirut&#39;s 19 seats, and the ARF was left with only 1 parliamentary seat, its worst result in many decades.<sup id="_ref-Armenian and the 2000 Parliamentary elections in Lebanon_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Armenian and the 2000 Parliamentary elections in Lebanon" title="">[45]</a></sup> The ARF called for a boycott of the 2005 Beirut elections, disturbed that the four seats normally reserved for Beirut&#39;s large Armenian community had gone unopposed to Hariri&#39;s candidates.<sup id="_ref-2005 Beirut elections_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2005 Beirut elections" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>Speculation arose that the Lebanese branch of the ARF had broken away from the main party&#39;s political ideology of socialism and embraced capitalism.<sup id="_ref-Armenians and Lebanon_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Armenians and Lebanon" title="">[43]</a></sup> Davit Lokian, a prominent ARF member and <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_Agriculture" id="w">Minister of Agriculture</a> of Armenia, denied these claims.<sup id="_ref-Davit Lokian interview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davit Lokian interview" title="">[47]</a></sup> The Dashnaktsutiun has an official newspaper in Lebanon known as the <i><a href="/wiki/Aztag_Daily_Newspaper" id="w">Aztag Daily Newspaper</a></i>.</p>

<p>Gerard Libaridyan, an historian and close adviser of Ter-Petrossian, collected and presented the evidence against the defendants.

The ban on the party was lifted, however, less than a week after Ter-Petrossian fell from power and was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Kocharyan" id="w">Robert Kocharyan</a>, who was backed by the Dashnaks.<sup id="_ref-ARF.am_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ARF.am" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>As of 2007, the ARF is not part of but has a cooperation agreement in place with the governing coalition, comprised of two parties in the government <a href="/wiki/Coalition_government" id="w">coalition</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(Armenia)" id="w">Republican Party</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prosperous_Armenia" id="w">Prosperous Armenia</a> Party. The <a href="/wiki/Country_of_Law" id="w">Country of Law</a> party was also a member of the governing coalition until it pulled out in May 2006. With 16 of the 131 seats in the <a href="/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Armenia" id="w">National Assembly of Armenia</a>, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation is the major socialist party in Armenia and the third-largest party in parliament.</p>
<p>In addition to its parliamentary seats, the following governmental ministries are also headed by ARF members: Ministry of Agriculture, Davit Lokian;<sup id="_ref-_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-" title="">[58]</a></sup> Ministry of Education and Science, Levon Mkrtchian;<sup id="_ref-_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-" title="">[58]</a></sup> Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, Aghvan Vardanian;<sup id="_ref-_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-" title="">[58]</a></sup> Ministry of Healthcare, Norair Davidian.<sup id="_ref-_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-" title="">[58]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/July_13" id="w">July 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, the <a href="/wiki/ARF_History_Museum" id="w">ARF History Museum</a> was inaugurated in Yerevan, displaying the history of the party and of its notable members.</p>

They invited the public to vote to advise the party which of two candidates Vahan Hovhannisyan and Aram Rustamian they should formally nominate for president of Armenia in the subsequent official election. What characterized it as a primary instead of a standard <a href="/wiki/Opinion_poll" id="w">opinion poll</a> was that the public knew of the primary in advance, all eligible voters were invited, and the voting was by secret ballot. Nearly 300,000 people voted in make-shift tents and mobile ballot boxes. Vahan Hovhannisyan received the most votes and was subsequently nominated for the presidential election by the ARF Supreme Council in a secret ballot.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> </p>

</p>
<p>The principal founders of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation were socialists, and <a href="/wiki/Marxism" id="w">Marxist</a> elements were omnipresent in the introductory section of the party&#39;s first program written by <a href="/wiki/Rosdom" id="w">Rosdom</a>, entitled &#34;General Theory&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ARF History (1)_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ARF History (1)" title="">[66]</a></sup> The ARF first set down its ideological and political goals during the <a href="/wiki/Abdul_Hamid_II" id="w">Hamidian regime</a>. It denounced the Ottoman regime and the unbearable conditions of life for its Armenians and advocated changing the regime in power and securing more rights through revolution and armed struggle. The ARF had and still has <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialism</a> within its <a href="/wiki/Political_philosophy" id="w">political philosophy</a>. Its program expresses the entire, multifaceted make-up of the Armenian revolutionary movement, including its national-liberation, political, and social-economic aspects.<sup id="_ref-ARF History (2)_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ARF History (2)" title="">[67]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Despite subsequent modifications, the above-mentioned principles and tendencies continue to characterize the ideological world of the Dashnaktsutiun, and its approach toward issues has remained unchanged. In recent decades, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation reasserted itself ideologically and reformulated the section of its program called &#34;General Theory&#34;, adapting it to current concepts of socialism, democracy and rights of self-determination.<sup id="_ref-ARF History (2)_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ARF History (2)" title="">[67]</a></sup> Its goals are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creation of a free, independent, and united Armenia. The borders of <a href="/wiki/United_Armenia" id="w">United Armenia</a> shall include all territories designated as Armenia by the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_S%C3%A8vres" id="w">Treaty of Sèvres</a> as well as the regions of <a href="/wiki/Artsakh" id="w">Artsakh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Javakheti" id="w">Javakhk</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Nakhichevan" id="w">Nakhichevan</a> (See map).<sup id="_ref-ARF Shant Student Association_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ARF Shant Student Association" title="">[8]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>International condemnation of the <a href="/wiki/Armenian_genocide" id="w">Genocide</a> committed by the Ottoman Empire against the Armenians, return of the lands which are claimed to be occupied, and just reparations to the Armenian nation<sup id="_ref-ARF Shant Student Association_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ARF Shant Student Association" title="">[8]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>The gathering of worldwide expatriate Armenians on the lands of United Armenia.<sup id="_ref-ARF Shant Student Association_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ARF Shant Student Association" title="">[8]</a></sup></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Strengthening Armenia&#39;s statehood, institutionalization of democracy and the rule of law, securing the people&#39;s economic well being, and establishment of social justice, and a democratic and socialistic independent republic in Armenia<sup id="_ref-ARF Shant Student Association_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ARF Shant Student Association" title="">[8]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>The ARF is often accused of having a present strategy that does not differ from the one used during the time of the Ottoman Empire. Its tactics are viewed as still being aimed at convincing <a href="/wiki/Western_world" id="w">Western governments</a> and diplomatic circles to sponsor the party&#39;s demands.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1907, the Dashnaktsutiun joined the <a href="/wiki/Socialist_International" id="w">Socialist International</a> and remained a full member until 1960, when it decided to pull out of the organization. In 1996, it was re-accepted as an observer member, and in 1999 the Dashnaks earned full membership in the international organization.<sup id="_ref-Socialist Int._a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Socialist Int." title="">[69]</a></sup></p>

The ARF Shant Student Association and the ARF Armen Karo Student Association are comprised of college and university student members in various campuses and are the only ARF organizations whose membership is exclusively comprised of this group.
