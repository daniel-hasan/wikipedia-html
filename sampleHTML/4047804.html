The <b>Northern Ireland flags issue</b> is one that divides the population along <a href="/wiki/Sectarianism" id="w">sectarian</a> lines. Depending on political allegiance, people identify with differing <a href="/wiki/Flag" id="w">flags</a> and symbols, some of which have, or have had, official status in the province.</p>
<p>There are various proposals as to what flag could represent <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" id="w">Northern Ireland</a>&#39;s various communities as a whole; see <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_flags_issue#Possible Replacements" id="w">below</a> for some suggestions.</p>

Therefore, when the government of Northern Ireland was suspended in March 1972 and dissolved under the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Constitution_Act_1973" id="w">Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973</a>, its arms and flag officially disappeared; however, the flag continues to be used by some local governments, such as the predominantly-unionist <a href="/wiki/Castlereagh_Borough_Council" id="w">Castlereagh</a>, who continue to fly it outside their offices<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>, and by some <a href="/wiki/NGO" id="w">NGOs</a> (such as sports teams) representing the territory.

The Banner dates from 1953, though the design (which appears in the <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_Arms_of_Northern_Ireland" id="w">Northern Ireland coat of arms</a> which dates from 1924) is based on the <a href="/wiki/Flag_of_Ulster" id="w">flag of the Irish province of Ulster</a> which covered what is now Northern Ireland and three counties of the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" id="w">Republic of Ireland</a>. There are four differences with the Flag of Ulster, namely the white background, the six-pointed star (representing the six Northern Ireland counties), the including of the crown and the Red Hand with the open thumb.</p>

The flag of the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" id="w">Republic of Ireland</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Tricolour" id="w">Irish Tricolour</a> is regularly flown by Republicans and Nationalists to show their support for a <a href="/wiki/United_Ireland" id="w">United Ireland</a>. The colours represent Irish <a href="/wiki/Catholics" id="w">Catholics</a> (green), <a href="/wiki/Protestants" id="w">Protestants</a> (orange) and the desire for peace (white) and was originally designed by <a href="/wiki/Irish_Nationalists" id="w">Irish Nationalists</a> in the 19th century to represent a united independent island. In its original 19th century form, the orange band was at the mast-side of the flag. 
In the early 20th century when the flag was re-adopted by Irish nationalists it was altered to have the green band closest to the mast.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Flags_and_Emblems_Act" id="w">Flags and Emblems Act</a>, <a href="/wiki/1954" id="w">1954</a> which had been enacted by the Unionist Government at Stormont restricted the display of flags and emblems which would cause a breach of the peace, which in practical terms affected the Tricolour most often. This act was subsequently repealed by the UK Government at <a href="/wiki/Westminster" id="w">Westminster</a>.</p>
<p>The flying of the Irish Tricolour by Nationalists in Northern Ireland on St Patrick&#39;s Day has caused some controversy, with Unionists arguing that St Patrick is the patron saint of the whole of Ireland, not just the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" id="w">Republic of Ireland</a> or its citizens. However Nationalists argue that the flag represents peace (white) between both nationalist Irish (green) and unionist British (orange) and it should be viewed as such as there is no official flag at present for the whole of Ireland. Nationalists believe that there should not be an issue with flying the tricolour on this day as Unionists fly the former flag of the Northern Ireland Government (The Ulster Banner) during the <a href="/wiki/12_July" id="w">12 July</a> Celebrations.</p>
<p>Some local councils have debated the usage of the flag. Belfast City Council for example, had this flag in the Lord Mayor&#39;s official office, when put in place by former <a href="/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in" id="w">Sinn Féin</a> Lord Mayor <a href="/wiki/Alex_Maskey" id="w">Alex Maskey</a>, MLA, along with the Union Flag. When the <a href="/wiki/Social_Democratic_and_Labour_Party" id="w">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a>&#39;s (SDLP) <a href="/wiki/Alban_McGuinness" id="w">Alban McGuinness</a> was previously <a href="/wiki/Lord_Mayor" id="w">Lord Mayor</a>, however, he side-stepped the issue by having neither flag in his office.</p>
<p>Use of the flag in Northern Ireland has been debated in recent years, with Belfast City Council discussing (in September 2003), amongst other things, using the flag to fly alongside the Union Flag on designated occasions. The debate, however, all but collapsed after the long term suspension of the Northern Ireland government.</p>

<p>As there is currently no unique official flag for Northern Ireland, there have been various suggestions about what should be done. Apart from reusing an existing flag (such as the Cross of St Patrick), various new designs have been created.</p>

This flag was being considered by the <a href="/wiki/Her_Majesty%26%2339%3Bs_Government" id="w">UK Government</a> in the late 1990s and was leaked to <a href="/wiki/BBC_News" id="w">BBC News</a><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>. It was never officially proposed. It is essentially the old NI Government Flag with the crown removed and some yellow taken from the Province of Ulster Flag.</p>
<p>When this flag was shown by journalists to various people around <a href="/wiki/Belfast" id="w">Belfast</a>, the reaction was mainly unfavourable. Although some liked its inclusive nature, typical responses were along the lines of &#34;We already have a flag, it&#39;s the <a href="/wiki/Union_Jack" id="w">Union Jack</a>&#34; or &#34;We already have a flag, it&#39;s the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Tricolour" id="w">Tricolour</a>&#34;.{{Who}}<br/></p>

 second flag was a later design from the Flags Institute in 1998 shortly after the Good Friday Agreement, and again reaction was muted.  The design attempted to hark back to the ancient flags of Ulster and the origins of the two communities. It retains the gold and red cross arms of the de Burgh Earls of Ulster and ancient symbol of the Red Hand of Neil, which appears on both the flags of  loyalists and republicans.  The six pointed was dropped for being &#34;too loyalist&#34; for the republican community. The white fimbration (or edge) to the cross was included for two reasons, one to reflect the Norse heritage of Ulster and secondly to echo the Union flag. This was to balance the use of a gold background on the Provincial Ulster Flag and the white background of the Ulster Banner.</p>
