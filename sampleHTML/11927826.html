<p>Since first coming to wide notice in the late 1990s, the <b><i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" id="w">Harry Potter</a></i></b> book series by <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" id="w">J. K. Rowling</a> has engendered a number of <b>legal disputes</b>. Rowling, her publishers and <a href="/wiki/Time_Warner" id="w">Time Warner</a>, the owner of the rights to the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_films" id="w">Harry Potter films</a>, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyright, and also have fielded accusations of copyright theft themselves.<sup id="_ref-Potter author zaps court rival_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Potter author zaps court rival" title="">[1]</a></sup> The worldwide popularity of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them.<sup id="_ref-yemets_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-yemets" title="">[2]</a></sup> While these legal proceedings have countered a number of cases of outright piracy,<sup id="_ref-walkup_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-walkup" title="">[3]</a></sup> other attempts have targeted not-for-profit endeavours and have been criticised as a result as too draconian.<sup id="_ref-Claire_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Claire" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Another area of legal dispute involves a series of injunctions obtained by Rowling and her publishers to prohibit anyone from reading her books before their official release date. These injunctions have very sweeping powers and have occasionally drawn fire from civil liberties and free speech campaigners and sparked debates over the &#34;right to read&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Don't Buy Harry Potter Books_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Don't Buy Harry Potter Books" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-geist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-geist" title="">[6]</a></sup>   The powers afforded by these injunctions have even been used in subsequent cases unrelated to publishing.<sup id="_ref-injunction_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-injunction" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Outside these controversies, a number of particular incidents related to <i>Harry Potter</i> have also led, or almost led, to legal action. In 2005 a man was sentenced to four years in prison after an altercation with a weapon over stolen pages from an unreleased <i>Harry Potter</i> novel,<sup id="_ref-corby_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-corby" title="">[8]</a></sup> while in 2007 <a href="/wiki/Bloomsbury_Publishing" id="w">Bloomsbury Publishing</a> came close to legal action against the supermarket chain <a href="/wiki/Asda" id="w">Asda</a> for libel after the company accused them of overpricing the final <i>Harry Potter</i> novel, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" id="w">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-telegraph_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-telegraph" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1999, <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> author Nancy Stouffer quietly began to allege <a href="/wiki/Copyright" id="w">copyright</a> and <a href="/wiki/Trademark" id="w">trademark</a> <a href="/wiki/Infringement" id="w">infringement</a> by Rowling of her 1984 works <i>The Legend of Rah and the Muggles</i> and <i>Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly</i>.<sup id="_ref-Potter author zaps court rival_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Potter author zaps court rival" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The primary basis for Stouffer&#39;s case rested in her own purported invention of the word &#34;Muggles&#34;, non-magical elongated <a href="/wiki/Humanoids" id="w">humanoids</a>, in <i>The Legend of Rah and the Muggles</i>, and Larry Potter, the title character of a series of activity booklets for children. Larry Potter, like Harry Potter, is a bespectacled boy with dark hair. Despite the reports of some news agencies,<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Larry Potter is not a character in <i>The Legend of Rah and the Muggles</i>. Stouffer also drew a number of other comparisons, such as a castle on a lake, a receiving room and wooden doors.<sup id="_ref-Muggle Versus Wizard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Muggle Versus Wizard" title="">[11]</a></sup> Portions of <i>Rah</i> were originally published in booklet form by Ande Publishing Company in 1986, a company founded by Ms. Stouffer together with a group of friends and family.<sup id="_ref-opinion_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-opinion" title="">[12]</a></sup>  Ande filed for bankruptcy in September 1987 without selling any of its booklets in the United States or elsewhere.<sup id="_ref-opinion_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-opinion" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-appeal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-appeal" title="">[13]</a></sup>    Rowling has stated that she first visited the United States in 1998.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Rowling, along with <a href="/wiki/Scholastic_Press" id="w">Scholastic Press</a> (her American publisher) and <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros." id="w">Warner Bros.</a> (holders of the series&#39; film rights), pre-empted Stouffer with a suit of their own seeking a declaratory judgment that they had not infringed on any of Stouffer&#39;s works. During the course of the trial, it was proven &#34;by clear and convincing  evidence, that Stouffer has perpetrated a fraud on the Court through her submission of fraudulent documents as well as through her untruthful testimony,&#34;<sup id="_ref-appeal_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-appeal" title="">[13]</a></sup> including changing pages years after the fact to retroactively insert the word &#34;muggle&#34;.<sup id="_ref-appeal_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-appeal" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-nancy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nancy" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Her case was dismissed with prejudice and she was fined $50,000 for her &#34;pattern of intentional bad faith conduct&#34; in relation to her employment of fraudulent submissions, along with being ordered to pay a portion of the plaintiffs&#39; legal fees.<sup id="_ref-Stouffer v. Rowling_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stouffer v.

<p><i>The Legend of Rah and the Muggles</i> is currently out of print. In the spring of 2001, it was published by Thurman House, LLC, a Maryland publishing company.<sup id="_ref-opinion_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-opinion" title="">[12]</a></sup>  Thurman House, formed by Ottenheimer Publishers to republish the works of Nancy Stouffer, was closed when Ottenheimer ceased operations in 2002 after filing for bankruptcy.<sup id="_ref-pw_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pw" title="">[17]</a></sup> Ms. Stouffer later asserted that any copies of the book published by Thurman House are unauthorized because the publisher failed to honor its contractual obligations to her.<sup id="_ref-unauth_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-unauth" title="">[18]</a></sup> She states on her website that she is planning to republish her books and is entertaining the possibility of another lawsuit against Warner Bros., J.

<p>Rowling vehemently denied Stouffer&#39;s claims. &#34;I am deeply offended that my integrity and good character have been besmirched by the ludicrous allegations that I stole [anything]&#34;, she said during the court case.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> In an interview with <i>Time</i> Magazine the following year, Rowling admitted how deeply she had been affected by the accusations: &#34;It felt as if some strange woman had come out of nowhere saying she was my children&#39;s mother ... It was like a punch in the stomach. People think that if you have been successful, you are insulated from normal feelings of hurt, but you aren&#39;t.&#34;<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

In 2003, courts in the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Netherlands</a> prevented the distribution of a <a href="/wiki/Dutch_language" id="w">Dutch</a> translation of <i>Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass</i>, the first of <a href="/wiki/Dimitry_Yemets" id="w">Dimitry Yemets</a>&#39; popular <a href="/wiki/Russian_language" id="w">Russian</a> series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate <a href="/wiki/Copyright" id="w">copyright</a> law. Yemets and his original <a href="/wiki/Moscow" id="w">Moscow</a>-based publishers, <a href="/wiki/Eksmo" id="w">Eksmo</a>, argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright.<sup id="_ref-yemets_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-yemets" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus were not allowed to be translated or sold outside Russia.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Later that year, as the Dutch translation <i>Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas</i> was still legal in Belgium, the <a href="/wiki/Flemish_Region" id="w">Flemish</a> publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was <a href="/wiki/Plagiarism" id="w">plagiarism</a>, hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue.<sup id="_ref-Dutch_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dutch" title="">[26]</a></sup>  Rowling did not sue, but as there was a lot of interest in the book (Dutch people could buy the book by postal order from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out.<sup id="_ref-Dutch_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dutch" title="">[26]</a></sup> The books remain popular in Russia and have spawned several sequels, as well as numerous adaptations and much merchandise.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Kolkata_lawsuit" name="Kolkata_lawsuit"></a><h2>Kolkata lawsuit</h2>
<p>In October 2007, Warner Bros. sued a group constructing a facade during a  <a href="/wiki/Hindu" id="w">Hindu</a> <a href="/wiki/Durga_puja" id="w">religious festival</a> in the Indian city of <a href="/wiki/Kolkata" id="w">Kolkata</a> for two million rupees ($50,000), claiming that they had erected a giant replica of Harry Potter&#39;s school, <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts" id="w">Hogwarts</a>, without their permission. Initial reports stated that, as the effort was not for profit, it did not violate Rowling&#39;s copyright.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> The Associated Press claimed that the High Court of <a href="/wiki/Delhi" id="w">Delhi</a>, where the petition was filed, allowed the organisers to carry on with the temporary construction with an order that the structure had to be dismantled after the festival was over.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> and that the court refused to impose any compensation on the basis that the organisers were involved in a &#34;non-profit making enterprise&#34;.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> However, these statements were later retracted; the court had in fact ruled in favour of Warner Bros., but no fine had been ordered, and Warners claimed that they had only requested a fine because such action was necessary under Indian law.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/November_2007" id="w">November 2007</a>, Rowling discussed the case on her website, listing the rumours that she had targeted a non-profit organisation as &#34;Toxic&#34; and saying,&#34;The defendants were not religious charities, and theirs was not a religious celebration. On the contrary, it was a large-scale, commercial, sponsored event involving corporations that included a major Indian high street bank. The event was, however, set up while a Hindu festival was going on ... The court ruled that Warner Bros. rights had indeed been infringed, and that events such as the one in question would need Warner Bros.&#39; permission in the future. The court also restrained all the defendants from any future events infringing Warner Bros. rights.&#34;<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<a id="RDR_Books" name="RDR_Books"></a><h2>RDR Books</h2>
<p>On 31 October, 2007, Rowling sued <a href="/wiki/RDR_Books" id="w">RDR Books</a> to block the publication of a 400-page book version of the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_Lexicon" id="w">Harry Potter Lexicon</a>.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Rowling, who previously had a good relationship with Lexicon owner Steve Vander Ark, reiterated on her website that she plans to write a <i>Harry Potter</i> encyclopedia, and that the publication of a similar book before her own would hurt the proceeds of the official encyclopedia, which she plans to give to charity.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> A judge later barred publication of the book in any form until the case was resolved.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> In their suit, Rowling&#39;s lawyers also asserted that, as the book describes itself as a print facsimile of the Harry Potter Lexicon website, it would publish excerpts from the novels and stills from the films. Such borrowing is allowable if no profit is intended. However, the book is intended to be sold commercially.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>On her website, Rowling said, &#34;Despite repeated requests, the publishers have refused to even countenance making any changes to the book to ensure that it does not infringe my rights.&#34;<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> On his website, Steve Vander Ark responded, &#34;I have worked dilligently with everyone associated with the books to make sure we don’t violate copyright. There have been a number of times when I have talked with Jo’s people and held back information they didn’t want published or modified material on the Lexicon to make sure they approve. I got specific permission from Warner Bros. to use film images and the illustrations from the books. I have been just as dilligent with the rights of fans who have allowed me to use their writing and artwork.

<p>A group of <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" id="w">intellectual property</a> lawyers at <a href="/wiki/Stanford_Law_School" id="w">Stanford Law School</a> say they will help defend RDR Books&#39; right to publish.

<a id="Legal_injunctions" name="Legal_injunctions"></a><h1>Legal injunctions</h1>
<p>There have been a series of legal <a href="/wiki/Injunction" id="w">injunctions</a> brought by Rowling and her publishers to ensure the books&#39; secrecy before their launch. These injunctions have drawn criticism from <a href="/wiki/Civil_liberties" id="w">civil liberties</a> campaigners over their potentially sweeping powers over individual freedoms.</p>
<p>In 2003, Rowling and her publishers sought and received a groundbreaking injunction against &#34;the person or persons who has or have physical possession of a copy of the said book or any part thereof without the consent of the Claimants&#34;.<sup id="_ref-injunction_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-injunction" title="">[7]</a></sup> The ruling obtained, for the first time  in British law, an injunction against unnamed or unknown individuals; before then, injunctions could only be obtained against named individuals. Lawyers Winterbothams noted that, &#34;The new Harry Potter style injunction could be used if you expected a demonstration or trespass to take place, but which had not yet begun, so long as you could find a description for the people expected which the Court was satisfied identified &#39;those who are included and those who are not&#39;&#34;.<sup id="_ref-injunction_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-injunction" title="">[7]</a></sup> This principle was later used against a camp of <a href="/wiki/Romani_people" id="w">Roma</a> travellers.<sup id="_ref-injunction_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-injunction" title="">[7]</a></sup> In 2006, pharmaceutical company <a href="/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline" id="w">GlaxoSmithKline</a> employed the injunction against anonymous animal rights campaigners who had sent threatening letters to their investors.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>The series garnered more controversy in 2005 with the release of the sixth book, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" id="w">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>, when a <a href="/wiki/Real_Canadian_Superstore" id="w">Real Canadian Superstore</a> grocery store accidentally sold several copies before the authorised release date.

<a id="Libel_threat" name="Libel_threat"></a><h1>Libel threat</h1>
<p>In July 2007, a dispute arose between <i>Harry Potter<b>s British publisher, <a href="/wiki/Bloomsbury_Publishing" id="w">Bloomsbury</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Asda" id="w">Asda</a>, a British supermarket chain owned by the US corporation <a href="/wiki/Wal-Mart" id="w">Wal-Mart</a>. On July 15, a week before the release of the final <i>Harry Potter</i> novel, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" id="w">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>, Asda issued a press release accusing Bloomsbury of unfairly fixing their prices. Asda spokesman Peter Pritchard claimed that Bloomsbury was &#34;holding children to ransom&#34; and that, &#34;[i]t seems like Bloomsbury need to do a <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" id="w">quid-ditch</a> as they have sent their prices up north on the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" id="w">Hogwarts Express</a>. By setting the RRP at this level can only be seen [<i>sic</i>] as blatant profiteering on their part.&#34;<sup id="_ref-telegraph_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-telegraph" title="">[9]</a></sup> Pritchard went on to say that Asda was acting to &#34;champion the right of young readers,&#34; and that the RRP was &#34;twice the average child&#39;s pocket money and £5 more than the average children&#39;s bestseller.&#34;<sup id="_ref-telegraph_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-telegraph" title="">[9]</a></sup> Asda had planned to sell the book as a <a href="/wiki/Loss_leader" id="w">loss leader</a> at £8.87, or half Bloomsbury&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Recommended_retail_price" id="w">recommended retail price</a> of £17.99 and below the <a href="/wiki/Wholesale" id="w">wholesale</a> price of £9.89.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>Two days later, Bloomsbury responded that the claims were &#34;potentially libellous&#34; and that:
</p><blockquote>
<p>Asda&#39;s latest attempt to draw attention to themselves involves trying to leap on the <i>Harry Potter</i> bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and have nothing to do with Bloomsbury Publishing or <i>Harry Potter</i> and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.<sup id="_ref-telegraph_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-telegraph" title="">[9]</a></sup> 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Bloomsbury stated that the price hike of £1 from the previous <i>Harry Potter</i> novel was due to it having been printed on recycled paper. &#34;There is a price to be paid by the consumer for environmental best practice,&#34; a Bloomsbury spokeswoman said.<sup id="_ref-makepeace_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makepeace" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bloomsbury CEO Nigel Newton said, &#34;[t]hey&#39;ve unleashed a very disingenuous, self-interested attack on us. This is complete nonsense and all they&#39;re doing is grandstanding as they&#39;ve done on the price of aspirin and bread. They try to turn it into a big deal as though it&#39;s a moral crusade for them, but it&#39;s nothing of the kind.&#34;<sup id="_ref-makepeace_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makepeace" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>That same day, Bloomsbury cancelled all Asda&#39;s orders of <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>, or roughly 500,000 copies, citing unpaid bills from the company totalling £38,000 for unauthorised returns of the sixth <i>Harry Potter</i> book.<sup id="_ref-makepeace_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makepeace" title="">[57]</a></sup> &#34;The two matters are completely unrelated,&#34; said a Bloomsbury spokeswoman, &#34;We decided today that we couldn&#39;t risk having arrears with anybody.&#34;<sup id="_ref-telegraph_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-telegraph" title="">[9]</a></sup> The dispute had been &#34;going on a while - going on for weeks actually.&#34;<sup id="_ref-lifestyle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lifestyle" title="">[58]</a></sup> Asda responded that Bloomsbury owed them £122,000 (&#34;for pulping and for other book trade issues and work we have done for them&#34;<sup id="_ref-makepeace_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makepeace" title="">[57]</a></sup>) and that, as one company spokesman claimed, &#34;It just seems funny that after we expose the potty Potter price hike, Bloomsbury are trying everything they can to stop kids getting hold of <i>Harry Potter</i> at a price they can afford.&#34;<sup id="_ref-lifestyle_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lifestyle" title="">[58]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Asda paid the bill within hours, and claimed that Bloomsbury would be in breach of contract if it did not allow the store to sell its books. However, Bloomsbury claimed that the block on Asda&#39;s orders was still in place as, &#34;Unfortunately, we&#39;ve now had to initiate a significant libel claim against them. That matter will have to be dealt with. If they want their 500,000 books, they&#39;ll have to come and make peace with us... It could be good news for all their disappointed customers, because they don&#39;t have to go to a soulless Asda shed to buy their book and they can share the magic of Harry Potter at an independent or specialist bookstore instead.&#34;<sup id="_ref-makepeace_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makepeace" title="">[57]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Upon receipt of Bloomsbury&#39;s legal letter, Asda responded that, &#34;There is nothing defamatory in our press release. Everything there is factual. It is a commentary on how we see things.&#34;<sup id="_ref-makepeace_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makepeace" title="">[57]</a></sup> Said another Asda spokesperson, &#34;If they don&#39;t supply us with the books, it will have a massive implication and [be] a breach of contract - but I don&#39;t think they will do that.&#34;<sup id="_ref-makepeace_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-makepeace" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>Later that day, however, Asda released a statement retracting its original comment: &#34;We apologise unreservedly to Bloomsbury for [our] press release dated July 15 and withdraw our statement. We look forward to a good relationship with Bloomsbury going forward, including selling the latest <i>Harry Potter</i> book from 00:01am BST on Saturday 21 July and many other Bloomsbury books in the future&#34;.<sup id="_ref-standoff_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-standoff" title="">[59]</a></sup> In response, Bloomsbury lifted the block and Asda was allowed to sell its books. The original press release was then expunged.<sup id="_ref-guardian_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardian" title="">[60]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The rationale behind Asda&#39;s initial press release remains uncertain.  Neill Denny, commentator for thebookseller.com, opined that &#34;the whole episode has the whiff of a badly-conceived PR stunt by ill-briefed senior executives at Asda out of touch with the subtleties of the book world.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Denny_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Denny" title="">[61]</a></sup>   Ralph Baxter of Publishing News concurred: &#34;For Asda... it may be seen as mission accomplished, a high-risk strategy to maximise publicity for its <i>Harry Potter</i> offer rewarded with television, radio, internet and newspaper coverage. And the association of Asda with low prices has no doubt been entrenched in a few more minds.&#34;<sup id="_ref-standoff_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-standoff" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
