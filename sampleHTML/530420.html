<p><b><i>Carnivàle</i></b>, pronounced /{{IPA}}/ (&#34;car-nih-VAL&#34;),<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> is an American <a href="/wiki/Television_series" id="w">television series</a> set in the United States during the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a>. In tracing the lives of two disparate groups of people, its overarching story depicts the battle between <a href="/wiki/Good_and_evil" id="w">good and evil</a> and the struggle between <a href="/wiki/Free_will" id="w">free will</a> and <a href="/wiki/Destiny" id="w">destiny</a>; the storyline mixes <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christian</a> theology with <a href="/wiki/Gnosticism" id="w">gnosticism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Freemasonry" id="w">Masonic</a> lore, particularly that of the <a href="/wiki/Knights_Templar" id="w">Knights Templar</a>. The show was filmed in <a href="/wiki/Santa_Clarita%2C_California" id="w">Santa Clarita, California</a>, and other <a href="/wiki/Southern_California" id="w">Southern Californian</a> locations.</p>
<p><i>Carnivàle</i> was produced by <a href="/wiki/Home_Box_Office" id="w">HBO</a> and ran for two seasons between <a href="/wiki/September_14" id="w">September 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a> and <a href="/wiki/March_27" id="w">March 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>.
The show was created by <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Knauf" id="w">Daniel Knauf</a>, who also served as executive producer with <a href="/wiki/Ronald_D._Moore" id="w">Ronald D. Moore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Howard_Klein" id="w">Howard Klein</a>.

<p>Early reviews praised its style but questioned the approach and execution of the story. <i>Carnivàle<b>s debut episode set a new viewership record for an HBO original series,<sup id="_ref-variety_solid_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-variety_solid" title="">[2]</a></sup> but was unable to retain its ratings in its second season. <i>Carnivàle</i> was canceled after 24 episodes, cutting its intended six-season run short by four seasons. The show won five <a href="/wiki/Emmys" id="w">Emmys</a> in 2004, was nominated for 10 further Emmy awards, and received numerous other nominations and industry awards between 2004 and 2006.<sup id="_ref-imdb_award_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-imdb_award" title="">[3]</a></sup></b></i></p>

</p><a id="Plot_introduction" name="Plot_introduction"></a><h2>Plot introduction</h2>
<p>{{main}}
The two seasons of <i>Carnivàle</i> take place in the Depression-era <a href="/wiki/Dust_bowl" id="w">dust bowl</a> between 1934 and 1935, and consist of two main plotlines that are slowly converging. The first involves a young man with strange healing powers named <a href="/wiki/Ben_Hawkins" id="w">Ben Hawkins</a> (<a href="/wiki/Nick_Stahl" id="w">Nick Stahl</a>), who joins a <a href="/wiki/Traveling_carnival" id="w">traveling carnival</a> when it passes near his home in <a href="/wiki/Milfay%2C_Oklahoma" id="w">Milfay, Oklahoma</a>. Soon thereafter, Ben begins having surreal dreams and visions, which set him on the trail of a man named Henry Scudder, a drifter who crossed paths with the carnival many years before, and who apparently possessed unusual abilities similar to Ben&#39;s own. </p>
<p>The second plotline revolves around a <a href="/wiki/Father_Coughlin" id="w">Father Coughlin</a>-esque <a href="/wiki/Methodist" id="w">Methodist</a> preacher, <a href="/wiki/Brother_Justin_Crowe" id="w">Brother Justin Crowe</a> (<a href="/wiki/Clancy_Brown" id="w">Clancy Brown</a>), who lives with his sister Iris in <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>. He shares Ben&#39;s prophetic dreams and slowly discovers the extent of his own unearthly powers, which include bending human beings to his <a href="/wiki/Will_(philosophy)" id="w">will</a> and making their sins and greatest evils manifest in the form of terrifying visions. Certain that he is doing God&#39;s work, Brother Justin fully devotes himself to his religious duties, not realizing that his ultimate nemesis Ben Hawkins and the carnival are slowly drawing closer.</p>
<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h2>Production</h2>
<a id="Conception" name="Conception"></a><h3>Conception</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Daniel_Knauf" id="w">Daniel Knauf</a> conceived the initial script for the show between 1990 and 1992 when he was unsatisfied with his job as a Californian <a href="/wiki/Health_insurance" id="w">health insurance</a> <a href="/wiki/Insurance_broker" id="w">broker</a> and hoped to become a <a href="/wiki/Screenwriter" id="w">screenwriter</a>. He had always been interested in carnivals and noted that this subject had rarely been dramatized on film. The resulting story and its treatment of <a href="/wiki/Freak_show" id="w">freaks</a> was strongly informed by Knauf&#39;s experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human being.<sup id="_ref-theage_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-theage" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dvd_making_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvd_making" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hbo_dknauf_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbo_dknauf" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Knauf named the intended <a href="/wiki/Feature_film" id="w">feature film</a> script <i>Carnivàle</i>, using an unusual spelling for a more outlandish look. Knauf had plotted the story&#39;s broad strokes as well as several plot details from early on and knew the story destination up until the final scene. However, the resulting 180-page long script was twice the length of an average feature film script, and Knauf still felt that it was too short to do his story justice. He therefore shelved the screenplay as a learning experience. In the meantime, all but one of Knauf&#39;s other scripts were rejected by <a href="/wiki/Hollywood" id="w">Hollywood</a> studios, often for being &#34;too weird.&#34;<sup id="_ref-theage_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-theage" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hbo_dknauf_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbo_dknauf" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-tca_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tca" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, Knauf met a few <a href="/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America" id="w">Writers Guild</a> TV writers who encouraged him to revise <i>Carnivàle</i> as a TV series. Knauf turned the script&#39;s first act into a <a href="/wiki/Pilot_episode" id="w">pilot episode</a>, but, having no contacts in the television business, he was forced to shelve the project again and return to his regular job. A few years later, after realizing that his insurance career was not working out, he decided to give his screenwriting efforts a last chance by offering the <i>Carnivàle</i> pilot on his website. The script was subsequently forwarded to <a href="/wiki/Howard_Klein" id="w">Howard Klein</a> via <a href="/wiki/Scott_Winant" id="w">Scott Winant</a>, a mutual friend of the two men. After several meetings and conversations, Klein felt confident that <i>Carnivàle</i> would make a good episodic television series that could last for many years. Klein brought it to the attention of <a href="/wiki/Chris_Albrecht" id="w">Chris Albrecht</a> and Carolyn Strauss of <a href="/wiki/HBO" id="w">HBO</a>, who were immediately receptive.<sup id="_ref-theage_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-theage" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-variety_creation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-variety_creation" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dvd_museum_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvd_museum" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hbo_hklein_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbo_hklein" title="">[10]</a></sup> But the network deemed Knauf too inexperienced in the television business to give him full control over the budget, and appointed <a href="/wiki/Ronald_D._Moore" id="w">Ronald D. Moore</a> as showrunner. (Knauf would replace Moore after one season when Moore left for the re-imagined <i><a href="/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(re-imagining)" id="w">Battlestar Galactica</a></i>.)<sup id="_ref-jimmy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jimmy" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The pilot episode, which was filmed over a period of twenty-one days, served as the basis for additional tweaking of intended story lines. Long creative discussions took place among the writers and the network, leading to the postponement of the filming of the second episode for fourteen months.<sup id="_ref-chat_milfay_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chat_milfay" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hbo_dpres_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbo_dpres" title="">[13]</a></sup> One major change was the addition of extra material for Brother Justin&#39;s side of the story. Brother Justin was originally conceived as a well-established preacher, and as a recurring character rather than a regular one. However, after perusing the preliminary version of the pilot, Knauf and the producers realized that there was no room for Justin to grow in a television series. Hence, it was decided to make Brother Justin an ordinary <a href="/wiki/Methodist" id="w">Methodist</a> <a href="/wiki/Minister_(Christianity)" id="w">minister</a> in a small town, setting him back in his career by about one or two years. Expanding Brother Justin&#39;s role opened new possibilities, and his sister Iris was created as a supporting character. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins&#39; side except for the addition of the cootch (<a href="/wiki/Striptease" id="w">striptease</a>) family; a <i>Carnivàle</i> consultant had elated the producers by calling attention to his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s.<sup id="_ref-carni_iw_jan04_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carni_iw_jan04" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Format" name="Format"></a><h3>Format</h3>
<p>The <i>Carnivàle</i> story was originally intended to be a trilogy of &#34;books&#34;, consisting of two seasons each.<sup id="_ref-jimmy_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jimmy" title="">[11]</a></sup> This plan was abruptly changed when HBO canceled the show after the first two seasons. Each season consists of twelve episodes.</p>
<p>Airing on HBO benefited <i>Carnivàle</i> in several ways. Because HBO does not rely on commercial breaks, <i>Carnivàle</i> had the artistic freedom to vary in episode length. Although the episodes averaged a runtime of 54 minutes, the episodes &#34;Insomnia&#34; and &#34;Old Cherry Blossom Road&#34; significantly departed with lengths of 46 minutes and 59 minutes, respectively. HBO budgeted approximately <a href="/wiki/US%24" id="w">US$4</a>&#160;million for each episode, considerably more than what most television series receive.<sup id="_ref-toledo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-toledo" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-yahoo_msg20320_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-yahoo_msg20320" title="">[17]</a></sup> This increased <i>Carnivàle<b>s production value, allowing for a comparably large main cast, filming on location, and developing story, plot depth, and atmosphere.</b></i></p>
<a id="Historical_production_design" name="Historical_production_design"></a><h3>Historical production design</h3>
<p><i>Carnivàle<b>s 1930s <a href="/wiki/Dust_Bowl" id="w">Dust Bowl</a> setting required significant research and relying upon historical consultants to be convincing, which was made possible with HBO&#39;s strong financial backing. As a result, reviews praised the look and production design of the show as &#34;impeccable,&#34;<sup id="_ref-variety_review2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-variety_review2" title="">[18]</a></sup> &#34;spectacular&#34;<sup id="_ref-time.com_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-time.com" title="">[19]</a></sup> and as &#34;an absolute visual stunner.&#34;<sup id="_ref-variety_review1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-variety_review1" title="">[20]</a></sup> In 2004, <i>Carnivàle</i> won four <a href="/wiki/Emmys" id="w">Emmys</a> for art direction, cinematography, costumes, and hairstyling.<sup id="_ref-emmy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emmy" title="">[21]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>To give a sense of the dry and dusty environment of the Dust Bowl, smoke and dirt were constantly blown through tubes onto the set. The actors&#39; clothes were ragged and drenched in dirt, and <i>Carnivàle</i> had an estimated 5,000 people costumed in the show&#39;s first season alone. The creative team listened to 1930s music and radio and read old <a href="/wiki/Hollywood" id="w">Hollywood</a> magazines to get the period&#39;s sound, language, and slang right. The art department had an extensive research library of old catalogs, among them an original 1934 <a href="/wiki/Sears_Catalog" id="w">Sears Catalog</a>, which were purchased at flea markets and antique stores. The East European background of some characters and Asian themes in Brother Justin&#39;s story were incorporated into the show. Except for the show&#39;s supernatural elements, a historical consultant deemed <i>Carnivàle<b>s historic accuracy to be excellent in regard to the characters&#39; lives and clothes, their food and accommodations, their cars and all the material culture.<sup id="_ref-dvd_making_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvd_making" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hbo_mcorey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbo_mcorey" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hbo_singras_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbo_singras" title="">[23]</a></sup></b></i></p>

<p><i>Carnivàle<b>s interiors were filmed at Santa Clarita Studios in <a href="/wiki/Santa_Clarita%2C_California" id="w">Santa Clarita, California</a>, while the show&#39;s many exterior scenes were filmed on <a href="/wiki/Southern_California" id="w">Southern California</a> locations.

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">One frame of <i>Carnivàle<b>s opening title sequence</b></i></div> The production team of A52 had intended to &#34;create a title sequence that grounded viewers in the mid-1930s, but that also allowed people to feel a larger presence of <a href="/wiki/Good_and_evil" id="w">good and evil</a> over all of time.&#34;<sup id="_ref-a52_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-a52" title="">[26]</a></sup> A52 then pitched their idea to <i>Carnivàle</i> executives in early 2003, who felt that the company&#39;s proposal was the most creative for the series&#39; concept. The actual production included scanned transparencies of famous pieces of artwork, each scanned transparency being up to 300&#160;MB in size. The resulting images were <a href="/wiki/Photoshopped" id="w">photoshopped</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)" id="w">digitally rendered</a>. A last step involved stock footage clips being compiled and digitally incorporated into the sequence.<sup id="_ref-a52_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-a52" title="">[26]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The opening title sequence itself begins with a deck of <a href="/wiki/Tarot_card" id="w">Tarot cards</a> falling into the sand, while the camera moves in and enters one card into a separate world presenting layers of artwork and footage from iconic moments of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Depression_era" id="w">Depression era</a>; the camera then moves back out of a different card and repeats the procedure several times.

<a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h3>Music</h3>
<p><i>Carnivàle</i> features instrumental music composed by <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Beal" id="w">Jeff Beal</a>, as well as many popular and obscure songs from the 1920s and 1930s, the time when <i>Carnivàle<b>s story takes place. The main title was written by <a href="/wiki/Wendy_Melvoin" id="w">Wendy Melvoin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lisa_Coleman_(musician)" id="w">Lisa Coleman</a>, and was released with selected themes by Jeff Beal on a <i>Carnivàle</i> television soundtrack by the record label <a href="/wiki/Varese_Sarabande" id="w">Varese Sarabande</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_7" id="w">December 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>.</b></i></p>
<p>Jeff Beal&#39;s score is primarily orchestral but mixes themes of <a href="/wiki/Bluegrass_music" id="w">bluegrass</a> as well as atmospheric rhythmic and synthesized sounds. Bigger groups of strings support smaller ensembles of <a href="/wiki/Guitar" id="w">guitars</a>, <a href="/wiki/Piano" id="w">pianos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Violin" id="w">violins</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cello" id="w">cellos</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Trumpet" id="w">trumpets</a>. The music sometimes uses ethnic instruments such as <a href="/wiki/Banjo" id="w">banjos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Harmonica" id="w">harmonicas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ukulele" id="w">ukuleles</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Duduk" id="w">duduks</a>.<sup id="_ref-origscore_de_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-origscore_de" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because HBO does not break individual episodes with commercials, <i>Carnivàle<b>s music is paced similar to a movie, with character-specific <a href="/wiki/Leitmotif" id="w">leitmotifs</a> from as early as the first episode. Characters get musically identified by solo instruments chosen for the character&#39;s ethnic background or nature. Some characters whose connections would only be disclosed later in the series have intentionally similar themes.<sup id="_ref-hbo_kedel_apats_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbo_kedel_apats" title="">[29]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>Different music is consciously used to represent the two different worlds of the story. Brother Justin&#39;s world features music of constructed orchestral sound with religious music and instruments. On the other hand, the score of the carnival side is more deconstructed and mystical, especially when the carnival travels through the <a href="/wiki/Dustbowl" id="w">dustbowl</a> and remote towns. For carnival scenes taking places in the cootch (<a href="/wiki/Striptease" id="w">striptease</a>) show or in cities, however, contemporary <a href="/wiki/Pop_music" id="w">pop music</a>, <a href="/wiki/Blues" id="w">blues</a>, <a href="/wiki/Folk_music" id="w">folk</a>, and ethnic music is played.<sup id="_ref-origscore_de_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-origscore_de" title="">[28]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hbo_jbeal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbo_jbeal" title="">[30]</a></sup> One of the most defining songs of <i>Carnivàle</i> is the 1920s song &#34;<a href="/wiki/Love_Me_or_Leave_Me_(song)" id="w">Love Me or Leave Me</a>&#34; by <a href="/wiki/Ruth_Etting" id="w">Ruth Etting</a>, which is used in several episodes to tie characters in the two worlds thematically.<sup id="_ref-hbo_kedel_apats_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbo_kedel_apats" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

The plot of <i>Carnivàle</i> takes place in the 1930s <a href="/wiki/Dust_Bowl" id="w">Dust Bowl</a> and revolves around the slowly converging storylines of a traveling carnival and a <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">Californian</a> preacher.

<a id="Casting" name="Casting"></a><h3>Casting</h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Casting_(performing_arts)" id="w">casting</a> approach for <i>Carnivàle</i> was to cast the best available actors and to show the characters&#39; realness as opposed to depending on <a href="/wiki/Freak_show" id="w">freak</a> illusions too much. <i>Carnivàle<b>s casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O&#39;Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were willing to make exceptions such as for Adrienne Barbeau as Ruthie.<sup id="_ref-hbo_jpap_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbo_jpap" title="">[35]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>The script for the pilot episode was the basis for the casting procedure, with little indication where the show would go afterwards. This resulted in some preliminary casting disagreements between the creators and producers, especially for leading characters such as Ben, Brother Justin and Sofie. The character of Ben was always intended to be the leading man and hero of the series, yet he was also desired to display a youthful, innocent and anti-hero quality; Nick Stahl had the strongest consensus among the producers. The character of Sofie was originally written as more of an exotic <a href="/wiki/Romani_people" id="w">gypsy</a> girl, but Clea DuVall, a movie actor like Stahl, got the part after four auditions. Tim DeKay was cast as Jonesy because the producers felt he best portrayed a &#34;very American&#34; looking <a href="/wiki/Baseball_player" id="w">baseball player</a> of that period. One of the only actors who never had any real competition was Michael J. Anderson as Samson, whom Daniel Knauf had wanted as early as the initial meeting.<sup id="_ref-dvd_museum_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvd_museum" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hbo_jpap_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hbo_jpap" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Cancellation_and_future" name="Cancellation_and_future"></a><h2>Cancellation and future</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/HBO" id="w">HBO</a> traditionally carries many of its shows through to an end, but stagnant low ratings and increasing production expenses made <i>Carnivàle<b>s future beyond a second season uncertain. Since HBO makes their commitments only for one year at a time, a third season would have meant to open up a new two-season book in <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Knauf" id="w">Daniel Knauf</a>&#39;s six-year plan, including introducing new storylines for current and new characters, and further clarifying and elaborating on the show&#39;s mythology. Fans assumed that the show would be renewed, but an internet leak announced in early May 2005 that the series would not be returning for a third season.<sup id="_ref-yahoo_msg19860_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-yahoo_msg19860" title="">[39]</a></sup> HBO confirmed that the show had been canceled on <a href="/wiki/May_11" id="w">May 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>.<sup id="_ref-variety_cancellation_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-variety_cancellation" title="">[40]</a></sup> HBO&#39;s president <a href="/wiki/Chris_Albrecht" id="w">Chris Albrecht</a> stated that the network would have considered otherwise if the producers had been willing to lower the price of an episode to <a href="/wiki/US%24" id="w">US$2</a>&#160;million. But the running costs for the sizable cast, the all-on-location shooting and the number of episodes per season were too enormous for them.<sup id="_ref-zap2it_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-zap2it" title="">[41]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>The cancellation resulted in several story plot lines being unfinished, and outraged loyal viewers organized petitions and mailing drives to get the show renewed. This generated more than 50,000 emails to the network in a single weekend.<sup id="_ref-zap2it_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-zap2it" title="">[41]</a></sup> Show creator Daniel Knauf was unconvinced of the success of such measures, but explained that proposed alternatives like selling <i>Carnivàle</i> to a competing network or spinning off the story were not possible because of HBO owning <i>Carnivàle</i>&#39;s plot and characters. At the same time, Knauf was hopeful that, given a strong enough fan base, HBO might reconsider the show&#39;s future and allow the continuation of the show in another medium. But because of the amount of unused story material he still had, Knauf did not favor finishing the <i>Carnivàle</i> story with a three-hour movie.<sup id="_ref-chat_milfay_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chat_milfay" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Knauf would not release a detailed run-down of intended future plots to fans, explaining that his stories are a collaboration of writers, directors and actors alike.<sup id="_ref-yahoo_msg20373_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-yahoo_msg20373" title="">[43]</a></sup> He and the producers however answered a few basic details about the <a href="/wiki/Characters_of_Carniv%C3%A0le#Season 2 finale and character fates" id="w">immediate fate of major characters</a> who were left in near-fatal situations in the final episode of Season 2. Knauf additionally provided in-depth information regarding the <a href="/wiki/Mythology_of_Carniv%C3%A0le" id="w">underlying fictional laws of nature</a> that the writers had not been able to fully explore in the first two seasons. June 2007 however marked the first time that a comprehensive work of detailed character backgrounds was made public: Following a fundraising auction, Knauf offered fans a so-called &#34;Pitch Document&#34;, a summary of <i>Carnivàle<b>s first season. This document was originally written in 2002 and 2003 to give the writers and the studio an idea about the series&#39; intended plot, and answered many of the show&#39;s mysteries.<sup id="_ref-pitch_summary_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pitch_summary" title="">[38]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>As of November 2007, no news have been announced about HBO reviving <i>Carnivàle</i>. A February 2006 mediavillage.com article stated that HBO was planning to develop a movie or miniseries that would wrap up loose plot lines for a telecast in 2007, with the aim to resurrect the franchise as an ongoing series in 2008.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> HBO never responded to these claims.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/HBO" id="w">HBO</a> reportedly invested in <i>Carnivàle</i>&#39;s promotion as much as for any of its primetime series launches. But the series&#39; unconventional and complex narrative made the network prescind from its traditional marketing strategies. <a href="/wiki/Teaser_trailer" id="w">Teaser trailers</a> were inserted on <a href="/wiki/CD-ROM" id="w">CD-ROMs</a> into <i><a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" id="w">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> issues to draw attention to the show&#39;s visual quality. 30-second TV spots were aired in national syndication, cable and local avails for four weeks before the show&#39;s premiere instead of the usual seven days. The historical context of <i>Carnivàle</i> was deliberately emphasized in the show&#39;s print art, which depicted the 17-member cast surrounding a carnival truck. This image was accompanied by a tagline of the show&#39;s good versus evil theme: &#34;Into each generation is born a creature of light and a creature of darkness.&#34; These measures were hoped to be backed up by positive critical reviews. To give ratings an initial boost, HBO placed the premiere of <i>Carnivàle</i> directly after the series finale of the successful <i><a href="/wiki/Sex_and_the_City" id="w">Sex and the City</a></i>.

<p><a href="/wiki/HBO" id="w">HBO</a> president <a href="/wiki/Chris_Albrecht" id="w">Chris Albrecht</a> stated that <i>Carnivàle</i> was &#34;not a big show for foreign [distribution],&#34;<sup id="_ref-toledo_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-toledo" title="">[16]</a></sup> but did not go into more detail. Reviews however indicate that the show&#39;s cryptic mythology and  inaccessibility to the casual viewer were major factors. Nevertheless, <i>Carnivàle</i> was sold to several foreign networks and was distributed to HBO channels abroad. The DVD releases of <i>Carnivàle</i> extended the availability of the show furthermore.</p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_9" id="w">June 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, a lawsuit was filed in <a href="/wiki/United_States_district_court" id="w">United States district court</a> by Los Angeles writer Jeff Bergquist. He claimed that the creators of <i>Carnivàle</i> did not originate the idea for the show, but rather stole it from his unpublished novel <i>Beulah</i>, a quirky drama set amid a traveling carnival during the Depression that Bergquist had been working on since the 1980s. Bergquist sought both recognition and punitive damages by arguing that <a href="/wiki/HBO" id="w">HBO</a> and <i>Carnivàle</i> creator <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Knauf" id="w">Daniel Knauf</a> violated his copyright on <i>Beulah</i>, but HBO and Knauf denied any claims as having &#34;absolutely no merit.&#34;<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> The case was <a href="/wiki/Prejudice_(law)" id="w">dismissed with prejudice</a> on <a href="/wiki/February_17" id="w">February 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
