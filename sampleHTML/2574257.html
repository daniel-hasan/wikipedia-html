<b>John Parkinson</b> (<a href="/wiki/1567" id="w">1567</a>&#8211;<a href="/wiki/1650" id="w">1650</a>; buried <a href="/wiki/6_August" id="w">6 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1650" id="w">1650</a>) was the last of the great <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> <a href="/wiki/Herbalist" id="w">herbalists</a> and one of the first of the great English <a href="/wiki/Botany" id="w">botanists</a>. He was <a href="/wiki/Apothecary" id="w">apothecary</a> to <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_England" id="w">James I</a> and a founding member of the <a href="/wiki/Worshipful_Society_of_Apothecaries" id="w">Worshipful Society of Apothecaries</a> in December 1617, and was later Royal Botanist to <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" id="w">Charles I</a>.

<a id="Biography" name="Biography"></a><h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Parkinson, born in 1567, spent his early life in <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire" id="w">Yorkshire</a>. He moved to London at the age of 14 years to become an apprentice <a href="/wiki/Apothecary" id="w">apothecary</a>.<sup id="_ref-Telegraph: Christmas Reads_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Telegraph: Christmas Reads" title="">[1]</a></sup> Rising through the ranks, he eventually achieved the position of <a href="/wiki/Apothecary" id="w">apothecary</a> to <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_England" id="w">James I</a>, and a founding member of the <a href="/wiki/Worshipful_Society_of_Apothecaries" id="w">Worshipful Society of Apothecaries</a> in December 1617; until 1622 he also served on the Court of Assistants, the Society&#39;s governing body. In addition, he assisted the Society in obtaining a grant of <a href="/wiki/Coat_of_arms" id="w">arms</a> and in preparing a list of all medicines that should be stocked by an apothecary.<sup id="_ref-KCL_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KCL" title="">[2]</a></sup> He was on the committee that published their <i>Pharmacopœia Londinensis</i> (<i>London <a href="/wiki/Pharmacopoeia" id="w">Pharmacopœia</a></i>) in 1618.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Then, on the cusp of a new science, he was <a href="/wiki/Botanist" id="w">botanist</a> to <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" id="w">Charles I</a>, who conferred on him the title &#34;<i>Botanicus Regis Primarius</i>&#34; (&#34;Royal Botanist of the First Rank&#34;).<sup id="_ref-TAMU_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TAMU" title="">[4]</a></sup> Anna Parkinson, a &#34;distant descendant&#34;<sup id="_ref-Telegraph: Christmas Reads_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Telegraph: Christmas Reads" title="">[1]</a></sup> of Parkinson and the author of a new popular biography of him, asserts that in 1625 when Charles I&#39;s bride, <a href="/wiki/Henrietta_Maria_of_France" id="w">Henrietta Maria of France</a>, came at the age of 15 years to live at <a href="/wiki/St._James%26%2339%3Bs_Palace" id="w">St. James&#39;s Palace</a>, &#34;he took on the role of introducing the young queen to <a href="/wiki/Horticulture" id="w">horticulturally</a> sophisticated circles.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Telegraph_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Telegraph" title="">[5]</a></sup> When he summed up his experience in writing <i>Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris</i> (<i>Park-in-Sun&#39;s Terrestrial Paradise</i>, 1629 &#8211; &#34;Park-in-Sun&#34; is a pun on &#34;Parkinson&#34;), with the explanatory subtitle <i>A Garden of all sorts of pleasant flowers which our English ayre will permit to be noursed up</i>, it was natural that he dedicated this work, which he called his &#34;Speaking Garden&#34;,<sup id="_ref-KCL_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KCL" title="">[2]</a></sup> to the queen.<sup id="_ref-Telegraph_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Telegraph" title="">[5]</a></sup> Blanche Henrey called the work the &#34;earliest important treatise on horticulture published in England&#34;,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> while the Hunt catalogue described it as &#34;a very complete picture of the English garden at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and in such delightful, homely, literary style that gardeners cherish it even to the present day.&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The work, which describes the proper cultivation of plants in general, was in three sections: the flower garden, the kitchen garden, and the orchard garden. It did not include specific growing instructions for each type of plant, but at the start of each main section Parkinson provided instructions on &#34;ordering&#34; each type of garden, advising on situating and laying out a garden, tools, soil improvement, grafting, planting and sowing and the types of plants that should be included in each type of garden. It contained illustrations of almost 800 plants in 108 full-page plates. Most of these were original <a href="/wiki/Woodcut" id="w">woodcuts</a> made by the German artist Christopher Switzer, but others appear to have been copied from the works of <a href="/wiki/Matthias_de_Lobel" id="w">Matthias de Lobel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_l%26%2339%3B%C3%89cluse" id="w">Charles de l&#39;Écluse</a> and the <i>Hortus Floridus</i><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> of Crispijn van de Passe the Elder.<sup id="_ref-KCL_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KCL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In <i>Paradisi in Sole</i> Parkinson hinted that he hoped to add a fourth section, a garden of simples (medicinal herbs).<sup id="_ref-KCL_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KCL" title="">[2]</a></sup> He delivered the promise in his other great book, the monumental <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i> (<i>The Botanical Theatre</i> or <i>Theatre of Plants</i>) which he published in 1640 at the age of 73 years. The release of this work was delayed due to the popularity of Thomas Johnson&#39;s edition of <a href="/wiki/John_Gerard" id="w">John Gerard</a>&#39;s book <i>The Herball or Generall Historie of Plantes</i> (1597).<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i> describes over 3,800 plants and was the most complete and beautifully-presented English treatise on plants of its day. It was the first work to describe 33 native plants, 13 of which grew near Parkinson&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Middlesex" id="w">Middlesex</a> home. Some of these plants, such as the <a href="/wiki/Welsh_poppy" id="w">Welsh poppy</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Strawberry_Tree" id="w">Strawberry Tree</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Lady%26%2339%3Bs_Slipper" id="w">Lady&#39;s Slipper</a>, were very common but had gone unnoticed or at least unrecorded.<sup id="_ref-KCL_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KCL" title="">[2]</a></sup> He intended the book to be a reliable guide for apothecaries, and it remained so for more than a hundred years after his death.<sup id="_ref-Telegraph_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Telegraph" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Parkinson actively sought new varieties of plants through his contacts abroad and by financing William Boel&#39;s plant-hunting expedition to <a href="/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula" id="w">Iberia</a> and <a href="/wiki/North_Africa" id="w">North Africa</a> in 1607&#8211;1608. He introduced seven new plants into England and was the first gardener in England to grow the great double yellow Spanish <a href="/wiki/Narcissus_(flower)" id="w">daffodil</a>.<sup id="_ref-KCL_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KCL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>His piety as a <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic</a> is evident from <i>Paradisi in Sole</i>. In his introduction, Parkinson saw the botanical world as an expression of divine creation, and believed that through gardens man could recapture something of <a href="/wiki/Garden_of_Eden" id="w">Eden</a>. Nonetheless, a short French poem<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> at the foot of the title page warned the gardener against <a href="/wiki/Hubris" id="w">hubris</a> and in having excessive regard for his efforts, for whoever tries to compare Art with Nature and gardens with Eden &#34;measures the stride of the elephant by the stride of the mite and the flight of the eagle by that of the gnat&#34;.<sup id="_ref-KCL_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KCL" title="">[2]</a></sup> However, struggles between <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" id="w">Protestants</a> and Catholics compelled Parkinson to keep a low profile. At the height of his success, the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" id="w">English Civil War</a> (1642&#8211;1651) tore his family apart.<sup id="_ref-Telegraph_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Telegraph" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Parkinson&#39;s London house was in <a href="/wiki/Ludgate_Hill" id="w">Ludgate Hill</a>, but his botanical garden was in suburban <a href="/wiki/Long_Acre" id="w">Long Acre</a> in <a href="/wiki/Covent_Garden" id="w">Covent Garden</a>,<sup id="_ref-Telegraph_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Telegraph" title="">[5]</a></sup> a district of <a href="/wiki/Market_gardening" id="w">market-gardens</a>, today close to <a href="/wiki/Trafalgar_Square" id="w">Trafalgar Square</a>. Not much is known about the garden, but based on a study of the writings of Parkinson and others, John Riddell has suggested<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> that it was at least two <a href="/wiki/Acre" id="w">acres</a> in size and probably surrounded by a wall. Four hundred and eighty-four types of plant are recorded as having been grown in the garden.<sup id="_ref-KCL_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KCL" title="">[2]</a></sup> Thomas Johnson and the <a href="/wiki/Hampshire" id="w">Hampshire</a> botanist, <a href="/wiki/John_Goodyer" id="w">John Goodyer</a>, both gathered seeds there.<sup id="_ref-TAMU_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TAMU" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Parkinson has been called one of the most eminent gardeners of his day. He maintained close relations with other important English and <a href="/wiki/Mainland_Europe" id="w">Continental</a> botanists, herbalists and <a href="/wiki/Plantsman" id="w">plantsmen</a> such as William Coys, <a href="/wiki/John_Gerard" id="w">John Gerard</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Tradescant_the_elder" id="w">John Tradescant the elder</a> (who was a close friend), Vespasian Robin, and the <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">Frenchman</a> <a href="/wiki/Matthias_de_Lobel" id="w">Matthias de Lobel</a> (also known as Matthias de L&#39;Obel or Matthaeus Lobelius). Together, they belonged to the generation that began to see extraordinary new plants coming from the <a href="/wiki/Levant" id="w">Levant</a> and from <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a>, broadly speaking. In his writings, de Lobel frequently mentioned the Long Acre garden and praised Parkinson&#39;s abilities. Parkinson, on his part, edited and presented in <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i> the papers of de Lobel, who had spent the final years of his life in <a href="/wiki/Highgate" id="w">Highgate</a> supervising the gardens of <a href="/wiki/Edward_la_Zouche%2C_11th_Baron_Zouche" id="w">Edward la Zouche, the 11th Baron Zouche</a>.<sup id="_ref-KCL_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KCL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Parkinson died in the summer of 1650, and was buried at <a href="/wiki/St_Martin-in-the-Fields" id="w">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a>, London, on <a href="/wiki/6_August" id="w">6 August</a>.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> He is commemorated in the <a href="/wiki/Central_America" id="w">Central American</a> <a href="/wiki/Genus" id="w">genus</a> of <a href="/wiki/Legume" id="w">leguminous</a> trees <i><a href="/wiki/Parkinsonia" id="w">Parkinsonia</a></i>. <i>Paradisi in Sole</i> also inspired the children&#39;s writer <a href="/wiki/Juliana_Horatia_Ewing" id="w">Juliana Horatia Ewing</a> (1841&#8211;1885) to write the story <i>Mary&#39;s Meadow</i>,<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> which was first published from November 1883 to March 1884 in <i>Aunt Judy&#39;s Magazine</i> (1866&#8211;1885), produced by her mother <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Gatty" id="w">Margaret Gatty</a>. In the story, some children read <i>Paradisi in Sole</i> and are inspired to create their own garden. The magazine received much favourable correspondence about the story, and in July 1884 it was suggested that a Parkinson Society should be formed. The objects of the society were to &#34;search out and cultivate old garden flowers which have become scarce; to exchange seeds and plants; to plant waste places with hardy flowers; to circulate books on gardening amongst the Members... [and] to try to prevent the extermination of rare wild flowers, as well as of garden treasures.&#34;<sup id="_ref-KCL_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KCL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
