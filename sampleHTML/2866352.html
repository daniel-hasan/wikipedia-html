 was during her time in Berlin that she became interested in the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> and <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">Communism</a>, seeing them as a solution to <a href="/wiki/Poverty" id="w">poverty</a>. In 1932, however, she was let go from her teaching position, as were many other women and foreigners. She toured the Soviet Union later that year with her husband and leading academics.</p>
<p>In 1933, Harnack began teaching English literature at the Berliner Abendgymnasium (evening secondary school). She sometimes discussed economic and political ideas from the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> and the Soviet Union with her students. She also joined the National Socialist teachers’ organization.</p>
<p>She also busied herself editing a book column in an English-language newspaper <i>Berlin Topics</i> along with the US <a href="/wiki/Ambassador" id="w">Ambassador</a>&#39;s daughter Martha Dodd. She also wrote in <a href="/wiki/German_language" id="w">German</a> for <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> and <i>Die Literatur</i> until 1935, when the Nazis&#39; strictures made this too difficult.</p>
<p>In 1936, she published her German translation of <a href="/wiki/Irving_Stone" id="w">Irving Stone</a>’s biography of <a href="/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh" id="w">Vincent van Gogh</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Lust_for_Life_(novel)" id="w">Lust for Life</a></i>. She also continued to work as a translator for various publishing companies.</p>
<p>In 1937, Mildred Harnack visited the United States and went on a campus lecture tour whose theme was &#34;The German Relation to Current American Literature&#34;.</p>
<a id="The_Red_Orchestra" name="The_Red_Orchestra"></a><h1> The Red Orchestra </h1>
<p>Together with her husband Arvid, the writer <a href="/wiki/Adam_Kuckhoff" id="w">Adam Kuckhoff</a> and his wife <a href="/wiki/Greta_Kuckhoff" id="w">Greta</a>, Harnack brought together a discussion circle which debated political perspectives on the time after the <a href="/wiki/National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party" id="w">National Socialists</a>&#39; expected downfall or overthrow. From these meetings arose what the <a href="/wiki/Gestapo" id="w">Gestapo</a> would call the <a href="/wiki/Red_Orchestra" id="w">Red Orchestra</a> (<i>Rote Kapelle</i>) resistance group.</p>
<p>In 1940-1941, the group was in <a href="/wiki/Wireless" id="w">wireless</a> contact with Soviet agents, trying to thwart the forthcoming German attack upon the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a>. Harnack even sent the Soviets information about the forthcoming <a href="/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa" id="w">Operation Barbarossa</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Harnack was making contact with people who were against the Nazi régime, recruiting some for the resistance, and serving as go-between for her husband, other members of the Orchestra, and Soviet agents.</p>

 July 1942, the <a href="/wiki/Decryption" id="w">Decryption</a> Department of the <i><a href="/wiki/Oberkommando_des_Heeres" id="w">Oberkommando des Heeres</a></i> managed to decode the group&#39;s radio messages, and the <a href="/wiki/Gestapo" id="w">Gestapo</a> pounced. On 7 September, Arvid and Mildred Harnack were arrested while on a weekend outing. At this time, Mildred had been teaching English at the Foreign Studies Department of the University of Berlin. Arvid Harnack was sentenced to death on 19 December after a four-day trial before the <i>Reichskriegsgericht</i> (&#34;Reich <a href="/wiki/Military_tribunal" id="w">Military Tribunal</a>&#34;), and was put to death three days later at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin. Mildred Harnack was given six years in prison, although <a href="/wiki/Hitler" id="w">Hitler</a> shortly afterwards cancelled that sentence and ordered a new trial, which ended with a death sentence on 16 January 1943. She was <a href="/wiki/Beheading" id="w">beheaded</a> on 16 February 1943. Her last words were purported to have been: <i>&#34;Und ich hatte Deutschland so geliebt&#34;</i> (&#34;And I had loved Germany so much&#34;).</p>
<p>When her friend and colleague Clara Leiser learned of the execution, she wrote the poem <i>To and from the guillotine</i> in remembrance of her friend, Harnack.</p>
