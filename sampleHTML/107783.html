<b>Salinas</b> is the <a href="/wiki/County_seat" id="w">county seat</a> and largest municipality of <a href="/wiki/Monterey_County%2C_California" id="w">Monterey County</a> in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">U.S. state</a> of <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>. The most current estimate from the California Department of Finance, places the 2006 population at 148,350,<sup id="_ref-California Department of Finance, 2006 population estimate_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-California Department of Finance, 2006 population estimate" title="">[1]</a></sup> showing a slight decrease since 2000 which is largely attributed to the city&#39;s high cost of living. The largely suburban city is located at the mouth of the <a href="/wiki/Salinas_Valley" id="w">Salinas Valley</a> roughly eight miles from the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific Ocean</a> and enjoys a mild climate. Salinas is known for being an agricultural center as well as being the hometown of famed writer and Nobel prize laureate <a href="/wiki/John_Steinbeck" id="w">John Steinbeck</a>.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1>History </h1>
<p>Salinas began around 1840 as the Halfway House, a stagecoach stop between <a href="/wiki/Monterey%2C_California" id="w">Monterey</a> and <a href="/wiki/San_Juan_Bautista%2C_California" id="w">San Juan Bautista</a>.  In 1864, a post office was established, Salinas City was laid out, and the city was incorporated ten years later.  The city was named after the <a href="/wiki/Salinas_River_(California)" id="w">Salinas River</a>.</p>
<p>Salinas&#39; economy is largely based upon <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" id="w">agriculture</a>. Located in one of California&#39;s richest <a href="/wiki/Farming" id="w">farming</a> regions, the area produces a variety of <a href="/wiki/Fruit" id="w">fruits</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vegetable" id="w">vegetables</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Lettuce" id="w">lettuce</a>, <a href="/wiki/Strawberry" id="w">strawberries</a>, <a href="/wiki/Watermelon" id="w">watermelons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Broccoli" id="w">broccoli</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carrot" id="w">carrots</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cabbage" id="w">cabbages</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Spinach" id="w">spinach</a>.Therefore many major vegetable producers are headquartered in Salinas.  The historic prevalence of <a href="/wiki/Row_crop" id="w">row crop</a> is documented by <a href="/wiki/Aerial_photograph" id="w">aerial photographic</a> interpretation of Earth Metrics,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> which study also indicated a major conversion of cropland to <a href="/wiki/Urban" id="w">urban</a> uses over the time period 1956 to 1968,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> with that trend continuing for the next decades as well. </p>
<p>Salinas was also the <a href="/wiki/Birthplace" id="w">birthplace</a> of <a href="/wiki/Writer" id="w">writer</a> and Nobel Prize laureate <a href="/wiki/John_Steinbeck" id="w">John Steinbeck</a>. The recently revitalized <a href="/wiki/Historic" id="w">historic</a> downtown, featuring much fine Victorian <a href="/wiki/Architecture" id="w">architecture</a>, is home to the National Steinbeck Center by Kasavan Architects, Executive Architect, the Steinbeck House (open weekdays) and the <a href="/wiki/John_Steinbeck_Library" id="w">John Steinbeck Library</a>. The city is currently meeting with a group of local businesspeople who have received preliminary approval for a plan to build a mixed-use development on the site of the old Cominos Hotel which was torn down in the early 1990s due to <a href="/wiki/Earthquake" id="w">earthquake</a> damage. The plan calls for a high-rise hotel, conference facilities, retail and condominiums.  Plans to restore the old <a href="/wiki/Chinatown" id="w">Chinatown</a> (featured in John Steinbeck&#39;s novel <a href="/wiki/East_of_Eden" id="w">East of Eden</a>), just north of downtown, began in March 2007 with a vision of mixed uses emphasizing walkable neighborhoods, affordable and workforce housing, social services, retail and public green spaces.</p>

Salinas enjoys cool and moderate temperatures due to the &#34;natural <a href="/wiki/Air_conditioner" id="w">air conditioner</a>&#34; that conveys ocean air and fog in from the <a href="/wiki/Monterey_Bay" id="w">Monterey Bay</a> to Salinas while towns to the north and south of Salinas experience hotter summers as mountains block the ocean air.  Thus Salinas weather is closer to that of the <a href="/wiki/Central_Coast_of_California" id="w">Central Coast of California</a> rather than that of inland valleys and thus enjoys a mild <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_climate" id="w">Mediterranean climate</a> with typical daily highs ranging from the low 50s (°<a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit" id="w">F</a>) in the winter to the low 70s (°F) in the summer.  The difference between ocean and air temperature also tends to create heavy morning fog during the summer months (known as the <a href="/wiki/Marine_layer" id="w">marine layer</a>) driven by an onshore wind created by the local high pressure sunny portions of the Salinas Valley which extend north and south from Salinas and the Bay.</p>
<p>The average annual rainfall for the city is approximately 14.4 <a href="/wiki/Inch" id="w">in</a>). Occasionally there is snowfall on the peaks of the Gabilan and Santa Lucia mountain ranges, but snow in the city itself is extremely rare, occurring about once every 10-20 years on average.</p>

<p>Median household income in the city tended to be significantly higher alongside the city limits, especially in the northern Harden Ranch and Creekbridge neighborhoods. East Salinas and the downtown area suffered from a very low median households income as well as high crime rates.

Salinas is known as the <i>Salad Bowl of America</i> or <i>Salad Bowl of the World</i>. Over 80% of the <a href="/wiki/Lettuce" id="w">lettuce</a> grown in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> is grown in the Salinas Valley. The city&#39;s labor force is almost evenly divided between blue collar, 54.6%, and white collar, 45.4%. According to the 2000 US Census, 24% of the population worked in sales and office occupations, 21.4% worked in management, professional, and related occupations, 16.2% worked in service occupations, 14.9% worked in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, 14.4% worked in production, transportation, and material moving occupations, and 9.1% worked in construction, extraction, and maintenance occupations.</p>

During the first half of this decade, the Salinas city government struggled to deal with funding shortages.  A downturn in the state economy, combined with an unusually low per-capita tax base, forced the city to curtail certain services. During the crisis, Salinas almost became the first city in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> to close its libraries. However, an outpouring of private donations provided an ample stop-gap measure, keeping the libraries open with reduced hours. Donations were raised through <a href="/wiki/Rally_Salinas!" id="w">Rally Salinas!</a>, a grassroots fundraising organization launched by the city&#39;s mayor, to keep the libraries open through 2005. </p>
<p>In November 2005, voters approved a tax measure to fund several vital services in the city, including libraries, by a 61 percent vote. The measure, known locally as  Measure V, will provide some $11 million in funding to take effect in the 2007 fiscal year. The measure will allow the city to start restoring more than $15 million in service cuts including the closure of three recreation centers and the elimination of graffiti abatement and crossing guard money for schools. An independent oversight committee was appointed by the City Council to oversee the money raised by the tax increase, which will be in place for the next 10 years. In April 2006, the committee recommended dedicating 70% of revenues to restoring <a href="/wiki/Library" id="w">library</a> and police services.</p>
<p>In 2006, the city&#39;s financial situation was considerably improved, as Salinas officials announced a budget surplus.  In July 2007, library restoration had progressed enough to increase open hours to 117 (across the three branches), which was the number before the budget cuts but only 68% of the system&#39;s peak of 171.  In late July, the city announced the hiring of a new library director who declared a long-term goal of opening the system 7 days a week.  Various community groups, including Friends of the Salinas Public Library and the Salinas Library Commission, are championing the effort for reinvention of the library system to improve and expand services.</p>

<a id="Gangs" name="Gangs"></a><h2>Gangs</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Gangs" id="w">Gang activity</a> is responsible for a substantial portion of the violent crime in Salinas. The majority of street gang territory in Salinas comes under the <a href="/wiki/Norte%C3%B1o" id="w">Norteño</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sure%C3%B1o" id="w">Sureño</a> gangs. 
In 1998, local police estimated that 17% of all violent crimes -- and 71% of the city&#39;s homicides -- were gang related. Partners for Peace, a local gang prevention and youth welfare group, cites the low educational attainment, low household income (considering the median house price), and high population density caused by a lack of affordable housing as aggravating factors. The <a href="/wiki/Monterey_County%2C_California" id="w">County of Monterey</a> launched a task force early this year in an effort to fight the problem of gangs. The Monterey County Joint Gang Task Force is composed of personnel from the Monterey County Sheriff&#39;s Office, Probation Department, District Attorney&#39;s Office and the Salinas Police Department.  The Sheriff&#39;s Office and the Salinas Police Department have ordered seven cars that will allow task force members to use their own equipment. The cars will feature radio and computer systems that can communicate across both Sheriff&#39;s Office and police frequencies. To increase their visibility to gang members, the cars are painted black with the words &#34;Gang Task Force&#34; written in silver across the sides, making them distinct from the black-and-white cars used by regular patrol officers.  The mayor of Salinas announced (March 2007) the appointment of a Community Safety Director, a new position created to coordinate multiple government agencies and nonprofit organizations involved with crime prevention and suppression.</p>
<p>At the present time, the only gang prevention, intervention and counseling program that is working directly with at-risk youth is <a class="externallink" href="http://www.scyp.org/aboutus.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.scyp.org/aboutus.htm">Second Chance Family &#38; Youth Services</a> located at 745 N. Sanborn Road, Salinas CA 93905.  Brian K. Contreras founded the agency in 1980 and is a recipient of the California Wellness Foundation of the 2001 California Peace Prize.  Second Chance provides a number of programs and services to residents throughout the <a href="/wiki/County_of_Monterey" id="w">County of Monterey</a> and the city of Salinas including youth counseling, group counseling, tattoo removal (gang or drug related), community presentations, training for parents, teachers, educators, administrators, law enforcement and social service providers, neighborhood clean-up and graffiti removal are among a few.</p>
<a id="Schools" name="Schools"></a><h1> Schools</h1>
<p>Salinas has seven school districts serving the city core and adjacent unincorporated areas. The largest school district in Salinas is the Salinas Union High School District (grades 7-12) with 13,578 students enrolled in 10 campuses.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.greatschools.net/cgi-bin/ca/district_profile/398/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.greatschools.net/cgi-bin/ca/district_profile/398/">http://www.greatschools.net/cgi-bin/ca/district_profile/398/</a> The Salinas City Elementary School District is the largest elementary school district in Salinas. Salinas City Elementary has 12 schools and 7,954 students. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.greatschools.net/cgi-bin/ca/district_profile/393/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.greatschools.net/cgi-bin/ca/district_profile/393/">http://www.greatschools.net/cgi-bin/ca/district_profile/393/</a>. </p>
<a id="School_closures_/_openings" name="School_closures_/_openings"></a><h2>School closures / openings </h2>
<p>In April 2005, in a last ditch effort to keep the district solvent, the <a class="externallink" href="http://schools.monterey.k12.ca.us/~salcity" rel="nofollow" title="http://schools.monterey.k12.ca.us/~salcity">Salinas City Elementary School District</a> voted to close two elementary schools, Boronda School and Lincoln School. Closing Roosevelt School (K-6) was considered but the school was saved by its historical ties to <a href="/wiki/John_Steinbeck" id="w">John Steinbeck</a>, who attended it as a child.</p>
<p>The newest school in Salinas is <a class="externallink" href="http://www.borondameadowselementary.com" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.borondameadowselementary.com">Boronda Meadows Elementary</a>, built in 2005. Boronda Meadows was to have been a magnet school. This magnet school was to be divided into two campuses, one for technology and the other for fine arts. With the closing of Boronda and Lincoln schools, the magnet school idea was dropped in favor of a traditional school setting. Boronda Meadows is, however, perhaps the most technologically advanced elementary school in Salinas. Some of the advances include <a href="/wiki/Wi-fi" id="w">wi-fi</a> access available campus wide, integrated digital projectors in each room, a television studio, mobile computer accounts for students, <a href="/wiki/VOIP" id="w">VOIP</a>, and mobile computer labs. As a reminder of the two campus idea, Boronda Meadows currently has two  <a href="/wiki/Gym" id="w">gyms</a>, two outdoor <a href="/wiki/Amphitheaters" id="w">amphitheaters</a>, two indoor stages, two <a href="/wiki/Cafeteria" id="w">cafeterias</a>, two separate bussing lanes and two playgrounds.</p>
