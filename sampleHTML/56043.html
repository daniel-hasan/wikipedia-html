<p>Although a relatively minor character in <i>Star Wars</i> fiction, Jabba the Hutt has appeared in three of the six <i>Star Wars</i> films. The character has a recurring role in Expanded Universe literature and is the <a href="/wiki/Protagonist" id="w">protagonist</a> of the comic book anthology <i>Jabba the Hutt: The Art of the Deal</i> (1998), a collection of comics published between 1995 and 1996.</p>

<p>Jabba the Hutt is mentioned in <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" id="w">Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</a></i> (1977) and <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back" id="w">Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</a></i> (1980), but his first appearance on film came in 1983 with the third installment of the <a href="/wiki/Original_trilogy" id="w">original &#39;&#39;Star Wars&#39;&#39; trilogy</a>, <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. Directed by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Marquand" id="w">Richard Marquand</a> and written by <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_Kasdan" id="w">Lawrence Kasdan</a> and George Lucas, the first act of <i>Return of the Jedi</i> features the attempts of <a href="/wiki/Princess_Leia_Organa" id="w">Princess Leia Organa</a> (<a href="/wiki/Carrie_Fisher" id="w">Carrie Fisher</a>), the <a href="/wiki/Wookiee" id="w">Wookiee</a> <a href="/wiki/Chewbacca" id="w">Chewbacca</a> (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Mayhew" id="w">Peter Mayhew</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Jedi" id="w">Jedi knight</a> <a href="/wiki/Luke_Skywalker" id="w">Luke Skywalker</a> (<a href="/wiki/Mark_Hamill" id="w">Mark Hamill</a>) to rescue their friend, <a href="/wiki/Han_Solo" id="w">Han Solo</a> (<a href="/wiki/Harrison_Ford" id="w">Harrison Ford</a>), who had been imprisoned in <a href="/wiki/Carbonite" id="w">carbonite</a> in the events of the previous film, <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>.<sup id="_ref-SWVI_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SWVI" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The captured Han is delivered to Jabba by the bounty hunter <a href="/wiki/Boba_Fett" id="w">Boba Fett</a> (<a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Bulloch" id="w">Jeremy Bulloch</a>) and placed on display in the crime lord&#39;s throne room.

Luke, however, is dropped into the pit of the monstrous <a href="/wiki/Rancor" id="w">rancor</a>, just below Jabba&#39;s throne room. After Luke slays the beast, Jabba condemns Luke, Han, and Chewbacca to a slow death in the belly of the <a href="/wiki/Sarlacc" id="w">Sarlacc</a>, a large alien creature in Tatooine&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Tatooine#Dune Sea" id="w">Dune Sea</a>. &#34;In his belly,&#34; C-3PO reluctantly announces, &#34;you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.&#34; The execution turns into a skirmish at the <a href="/wiki/Great_Pit_of_Carkoon" id="w">Great Pit of Carkoon</a> where Luke escapes execution with the help of R2-D2 and defeats Jabba&#39;s guards. During the subsequent confusion, Leia strangles the Hutt to death with her slave chains.

<p>The second film appearance of Jabba the Hutt is in the <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope#Special Editions" id="w">Special Edition</a> of <i>A New Hope</i> which was released in 1997 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the original <i>Star Wars</i>. Han Solo has a confrontation in a <a href="/wiki/Mos_Eisley" id="w">Mos Eisley</a> <a href="/wiki/Mos_Eisley_Cantina" id="w">cantina</a> with an alien bounty hunter named <a href="/wiki/Minor_bounty_hunters_in_Star_Wars#Greedo" id="w">Greedo</a> (Paul Blake and Maria De Aragon) that ends with Greedo&#39;s death. According to Greedo, Jabba &#34;has no use for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an <a href="/wiki/Interdictor_Cruiser_(Imperial)" id="w">Imperial cruiser</a>.&#34; Jabba had hired Han to smuggle the illicit drug <a href="/wiki/Spice_(Star_Wars)" id="w">spice</a> from the planet <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_(K-L)#Kessel" id="w">Kessel</a>. Han, however, was forced to dump his cargo when an <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Star_Wars)" id="w">Imperial</a> search team boarded the <i><a href="/wiki/Millennium_Falcon" id="w">Millennium Falcon</a></i>, Han&#39;s ship. Greedo tells Han, &#34;Jabba&#39;s put a <a href="/wiki/Bounty_(reward)" id="w">price</a> on your head so large, every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.&#34; In a scene that had been cut from the 1977 original, Jabba and an entourage of bounty hunters are seen in a hangar bay outside the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>, trying to find the smuggler. Jabba confirms Greedo&#39;s last words and demands that Han pay the value of the shipment. Han promises to compensate Jabba as soon as he receives payment for delivering &#34;goods&#34;—<a href="/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi" id="w">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> (<a href="/wiki/Alec_Guiness" id="w">Alec Guiness</a>), Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, and C-3PO—to the planet <a href="/wiki/Alderaan" id="w">Alderaan</a>. Jabba warns Han that if he is not paid back soon, he will post a bounty &#34;so big, you won&#39;t be able to go near a civilized system.&#34; Due to circumstances beyond Han&#39;s control, however, he never completes his deal with the Hutt.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jabba the Hutt&#39;s final film appearance is in the 1999 <a href="/wiki/Prequel" id="w">prequel</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace" id="w">Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</a></i>.

Jabba the Hutt&#39;s physical appearance is as grotesque as his character and reinforces his personality as a criminal deviant. As Han Solo puts it in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, Jabba is a &#34;slimy piece of worm-ridden filth.&#34; Film critic <a href="/wiki/Roger_Ebert" id="w">Roger Ebert</a> describes him as &#34;a cross between a toad and the <a href="/wiki/Cheshire_Cat" id="w">Cheshire Cat</a>&#34;,<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Astrophysics" id="w">astrophysicist</a> and science fiction writer Jeanne Cavelos gives Jabba the &#34;award for most disgusting alien.&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> Science fiction authors <a href="/wiki/Tom_Veitch" id="w">Tom and Martha Veitch</a> write that Jabba&#39;s body is a &#34;miasmic mass&#34; of flesh that shakes as he laughs. He emits an unmistakable smell: &#34;The Hutt&#39;s lardaceous body seemed to periodically release a greasy discharge, sending fresh waves of rotten stench&#34; into the air. His swollen tongue drips with saliva as he feeds on creatures that resemble frogs and maggots.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Jabba&#39;s appetite is insatiable and he is not discriminatory about his diet. For example, his <a href="/wiki/Jester" id="w">jester</a>, the Kowakian monkey-lizard <a href="/wiki/List_of_minor_residents_of_Tatooine#Crumb, Salacious" id="w">Salacious Crumb</a>, must make the Hutt crime lord laugh once a day, every day, or Jabba will eat him.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jabba the Hutt does show rare moments of <a href="/wiki/Altruism" id="w">charity</a>, however. For instance, in one Expanded Universe story, he prevents a Chevin named <a href="/wiki/List_of_minor_residents_of_Tatooine#Ephant Mon" id="w">Ephant Mon</a> from freezing to death on an ice planet by covering him with his bloated layers of fat; the two are eventually rescued, and Ephant Mon becomes totally loyal to the crime lord, making him the only resident of Jabba&#39;s palace that the crime lord trusts.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Concept_and_creation" name="Concept_and_creation"></a><h1>Concept and creation</h1>
<p>Jabba the Hutt&#39;s appearance underwent several changes between different versions of the films. The shift in the concept of Jabba the Hutt from a furry creature to a slug and from a puppet to <a href="/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" id="w">CGI</a> represent two of the more glaring changes to the character in the concept and creation process.</p>
<a id="''Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope''" name="''Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope''"></a><h2>&#39;&#39;Episode IV: A New Hope&#39;&#39;</h2>
<p>The original script to <i>A New Hope</i> describes Jabba as a &#34;fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth&#34;,<sup id="_ref-DatabankBTS_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DatabankBTS" title="">[11]</a></sup> but Lucas stated in an interview that the initial character he had in mind was much furrier and resembled a Wookiee. When filming the scene between Han Solo and Jabba in 1976, Lucas employed <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" id="w">Northern Irish</a> actor <a href="/wiki/Declan_Mulholland" id="w">Declan Mulholland</a> to play the stand-in and read Jabba the Hutt&#39;s lines wearing a shaggy brown suit. Lucas planned to replace Mulholland in post-production with a <a href="/wiki/Stop_motion" id="w">stop-motion</a> creature. The scene was meant to connect <i>A New Hope</i> to <i>Return of the Jedi</i> and explain why Han Solo was imprisoned at the end of <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Nevertheless, Lucas decided to leave the scene out of the final film on account of budget and time constraints and because he felt that it did not enhance the film&#39;s plot.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> The scene remained in the novelisation, comic book and radio adaptations of the film. </p>

Lucas revisited the scene in the 1997 Special Edition release of <i>A New Hope</i>, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with <a href="/wiki/Huttese_language" id="w">Huttese</a>, a fictional language created by sound designer <a href="/wiki/Ben_Burtt" id="w">Ben Burtt</a>. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVD</a>, improving Jabba&#39;s appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks exactly like the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> </p>
<p>At one point of the original scene Ford walks behind Mulholland. This became a problem when adding the CGI Jabba, since he had a tail that happened to be in the way. Eventually this problem was solved by having Han stepping on Jabba&#39;s tail, causing the Hutt to react with a yelp of pain.</p>
<p>Lucas confesses that some people were upset about the CGI Jabba&#39;s appearance, most complaining that the character (and others like it) &#34;looked fake&#34;. Lucas dismisses this, stating that whether a character is portrayed as a puppet or as CGI, it will always be &#34;fake&#34; since the character is not real. He says he sees no difference between a puppet made of latex and one generated by a computer.<sup id="_ref-Lucascommentary_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lucascommentary" title="">[33]</a></sup> The CGI character performed actions that the puppet could not, such as walking. Jabba&#39;s film appearance in <i>The Phantom Menace</i> was as a CGI based on the character from <i>A New Hope</i>.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Concept artwork of Jabba the Hutt for <i>Return of the Jedi</i> designed by <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Light_and_Magic" id="w">Industrial Light and Magic</a></div>
Lucas based the CGI on the character as he originally appeared in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas&#39; <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Light_and_Magic" id="w">Industrial Light and Magic</a> Creature Shop. Design consultant <a href="/wiki/Ralph_McQuarrie" id="w">Ralph McQuarrie</a> claimed, &#34;In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature.&#34;<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> According to the 1985 documentary <i>From Star Wars to Jedi</i>, Lucas rejected initial designs of the character. One made Jabba appear too human — almost like a <a href="/wiki/Fu_Manchu" id="w">Fu Manchu</a> character — while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two.<sup id="_ref-StarWarstoJedi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-StarWarstoJedi" title="">[35]</a></sup> <i>Return of the Jedi</i> costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, </p><blockquote>My vision of Jabba was literally <a href="/wiki/Orson_Welles" id="w">Orson Welles</a> when he was older. I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. But <a href="/wiki/Phil_Tippett" id="w">Phil Tippett</a> kept imagining him as some kind of slug, almost like in <i><a href="/wiki/Alice%26%2339%3Bs_Adventures_in_Wonderland" id="w">Alice in Wonderland</a></i>. At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that&#39;s smoking. I kept thinking I must be really off, but eventually that&#39;s where it led up to.&#34;<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Designed by visual effects artist Phil Tippett,<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> Jabba the Hutt was inspired by the anatomy of several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on <a href="/wiki/Annelid_worm" id="w">annelid worms</a>, hairless animals that have no <a href="/wiki/Skeleton" id="w">skeleton</a> and are <a href="/wiki/Hermaphrodite" id="w">hermaphroditic</a>. Jabba&#39;s head was modeled after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled eyes and a mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large prey. His skin was given moist, <a href="/wiki/Amphibian" id="w">amphibian</a> qualities. Jabba&#39;s design would come to represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent <i>Star Wars</i> fiction.<sup id="_ref-HuttSansweet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HuttSansweet" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, Jabba is portrayed by a one-ton puppet that took three months and half a million dollars to construct. While filming the movie, the puppet had its own makeup artist. The puppet required three puppeteers to operate, making it one of the largest ever used in a motion picture.<sup id="_ref-StarWarstoJedi_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-StarWarstoJedi" title="">[35]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Stuart_Freeborn" id="w">Stuart Freeborn</a> designed the puppet, while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. Puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and <a href="/wiki/Mike_Edmonds" id="w">Mike Edmonds</a>, who were members of <a href="/wiki/Jim_Henson" id="w">Jim Henson</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Muppet" id="w">Muppet</a> group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character&#39;s English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men (he also played the <a href="/wiki/Ewok" id="w">Ewok</a> <a href="/wiki/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_characters#Logray" id="w">Logray</a> in later scenes) was responsible for the movement of Jabba&#39;s tail.

<div class="thumbcaption">Design of the Jabba the Hutt puppet for <i>Return of the Jedi</i></div>
Lucas voiced displeasure in the puppet&#39;s appearance and immobility, complaining that the puppet had to be moved around the set to film different scenes. In the <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVD</a> commentary to the Special Edition of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, Lucas notes that if the technology had been available in 1983, Jabba the Hutt would have been a CGI character similar to the one that appears in the Special Edition scene of <i>A New Hope</i>.<sup id="_ref-Lucascommentary_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lucascommentary" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but his lines are <a href="/wiki/Subtitle" id="w">subtitled</a> in <a href="/wiki/English_(language)" id="w">English</a>.

The sound effects were created by a hand running through a bowl of <a href="/wiki/Casserole" id="w">cheese casserole</a> and a muddy towel scraping along the inside of a garbage can.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jabba the Hutt&#39;s musical theme throughout the film, composed by <a href="/wiki/John_Williams" id="w">John Williams</a>, is played on a <a href="/wiki/Tuba" id="w">tuba</a>. One reviewer of <i>Return of the Jedi<b>s soundtrack comments, &#34;Among the new thematic ideas [of the score is] Jabba the Hutt&#39;s cute tuba piece (playing along the <a href="/wiki/Political_correctness" id="w">politically incorrect</a> lines of tubas representing fatness) ....&#34;<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup>  The theme is very similar to one Williams wrote for a heavyset character in <i><a href="/wiki/Fitzwilly" id="w">Fitzwilly</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1967_in_film" id="w">1967</a>), though the theme does not appear on that film&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Soundtrack_album" id="w">soundtrack album</a>. Williams later turned the theme into a <a href="/wiki/Symphonic" id="w">symphonic</a> piece performed by the <a href="/wiki/Boston_Pops_Orchestra" id="w">Boston Pops Orchestra</a> featuring a tuba solo by Chester Schmitz. The role of the piece in film and popular culture has become a focus of study by <a href="/wiki/Musicologist" id="w">musicologists</a> such as Gerald Sloan, who says Williams&#39;s piece &#34;blends the monstrous and the lyrical.&#34;<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>According to film historian Laurent Bouzereau, Jabba the Hutt&#39;s death in <i>Return of the Jedi</i> was suggested by script writer Lawrence Kasdan. Lucas decided Leia should strangle him with her slave chain. He was inspired by a scene from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Godfather" id="w">The Godfather</a></i> (1972) where an obese character named <a href="/wiki/Luca_Brasi" id="w">Luca Brasi</a> (<a href="/wiki/Lenny_Montana" id="w">Lenny Montana</a>) is <a href="/wiki/Garrote" id="w">garroted</a> by an assassin.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

With the premiere of <i>Return of Jedi</i> in 1983 and the accompanying merchandising campaign, Jabba the Hutt became an icon in American <a href="/wiki/Popular_culture" id="w">popular culture</a>.

<p>Jabba&#39;s role in popular culture extends beyond the <i>Star Wars</i> universe and its fans.

Like Jabba, Pizza the Hutt is a <a href="/wiki/Loan_shark" id="w">loan shark</a> and mobster. The character meets his demise at the end of <i>Spaceballs</i> when he is locked in his car and eats himself to death.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution" id="w">Smithsonian Institution</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/National_Air_and_Space_Museum" id="w">National Air and Space Museum</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington, D.C.</a>, included a display on Jabba the Hutt in the temporary <a href="/wiki/Art_exhibition" id="w">exhibition</a> <i>Star Wars: The Myth of Magic</i>, which closed in 1999. Jabba&#39;s display was called &#34;The Hero&#39;s Return,&#34; referencing Luke Skywalker&#39;s journey toward becoming a Jedi.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="Jabba_the_Hutt_in_mass_media" name="Jabba_the_Hutt_in_mass_media"></a><h2>Jabba the Hutt in mass media</h2>
<p>Since the release of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, the name <i>Jabba the Hutt</i> has become synonymous in American <a href="/wiki/Mass_media" id="w">mass media</a> with morbid obesity and corruption. The name is frequently utilized as a literary device—either as a <a href="/wiki/Simile" id="w">simile</a> or <a href="/wiki/Metaphor" id="w">metaphor</a>—to illustrate <a href="/wiki/Character_flaws" id="w">character flaws</a>. For example, in <i>Under the Duvet</i> (2001), <a href="/wiki/Marian_Keyes" id="w">Marian Keyes</a> references a problem with gluttony when she writes, &#34;wheel out the birthday cake, I feel a Jabba the Hutt moment coming on.&#34;<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> Likewise, in the novel <i>Steps and Exes: A Novel of Family</i> (2000), Laura Kalpakian uses Jabba the Hutt to emphasize the weight of a character&#39;s father: &#34;The girls used to call Janice&#39;s parents Jabba the Hutt and the Wookie [<i>sic</i>]. But then Jabba (Janice&#39;s father) died, and it didn&#39;t seem right to speak of the dead on those terms.&#34;<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>In his book of humor and popular culture, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dharma_of_Star_Wars" id="w">The Dharma of Star Wars</a></i> (2005), writer <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Bortolin" id="w">Matthew Bortolin</a> attempts to show similarities between <a href="/wiki/Buddhist" id="w">Buddhist</a> teachings and aspects of <i>Star Wars</i> fiction. Bortolin insists that if a person makes decisions that Jabba the Hutt would make, then that person is not practicing the proper spiritual concept of <a href="/wiki/Dharma" id="w">dharma</a>. Bortolin&#39;s book reinforces the idea that Jabba&#39;s name is synonymous with negativity:</p><blockquote>One way to see if we are practicing <a href="/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path" id="w">right livelihood</a> is to compare our trade with that of Jabba the Hutt. Jabba has his fat, stubby fingers in many of the pots that lead to the <a href="/wiki/Force_(Star_Wars)#Sith philosophy" id="w">dark side</a>. He deals largely in illegal &#34;spice&#34; trade—making him the <i>Star Wars</i> galaxy&#39;s answer a drug lord. He also transacts business in the slave trade. He has many slaves himself, and some he fed to the Rancor, a creature he keeps caged and tormented in his dungeon.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Outside literature, the character&#39;s name has become an insulting <a href="/wiki/Term_of_disparagement" id="w">term of disparagement</a>. To say that someone &#34;looks like Jabba the Hutt&#34; is commonly understood as a slur to impugn that person&#39;s weight and/or appearance.<sup id="_ref-FatWars_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FatWars" title="">[2]</a></sup> The term is often employed by the media as an attack on prominent figures. For instance, actress and comedian <a href="/wiki/Roseanne_Barr" id="w">Roseanne Barr</a> endured what W. C. Goodman called &#34;vitriolic attacks based on her weight&#34; at the hands of <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Observer" id="w">New York Observer</a></i> columnist Michael Thomas who often compared her with &#34;<i>Star Wars</i> blob monster&#34; Jabba the Hutt.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> Actress <a href="/wiki/Sally_Struthers" id="w">Sally Struthers</a>, meanwhile, was portrayed in <a href="/wiki/Starvin%26%2339%3B_Marvin" id="w">an episode</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/South_Park" id="w">South Park</a></i> as Jabba the Hutt. Similarly, &#34;Jabba The Slut&#34; is often used on <a href="/wiki/The_Jerry_Springer_Show" id="w">The Jerry Springer Show</a> to insult obese-and-unfaithful women. Comedian <a href="/wiki/Peter_Serafinowicz" id="w">Peter Serafinowicz</a> portrayed the elderly and obese <a href="/wiki/Marlon_Brando" id="w">Marlon Brando</a> as Jabba the Hutt, wearing prosthetics and a costume to resemble Brando and Jabba&#39;s shape.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
