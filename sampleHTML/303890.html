<b>Banking in Switzerland</b> is characterized by stability, privacy and protection of clients&#39; assets and information.

<p>The Swiss Parliament passed the Banking Law of 1934, which codified the rules of secrecy and criminalizes violation of it. The secrecy provisions were not included in the first draft of the law, which mainly concerned administrative matters such as bank supervision. The provisions, found in Article 47(b), were added before passage of the bill due to Nazi authorities&#39; attempts to investigate the assets of Jews and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Enemy_of_the_state" id="w">enemies of the state</a>&#34; held in Switzerland.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Private_banks_-_Private_bankers" name="Private_banks_-_Private_bankers"></a><h2>Private banks - Private bankers</h2>

<p>Private banker means that the bank offers private banking services and that its legal form is a partnership. The first private banks were created in Geneva in the late 
1700s as partnerships, and some are still in the hands of the original families. In Switzerland, such private banks are called private bankers (a protected term) to distinguish them from the other private banks who are usually share corporations.</p>
<a id="Cantonal_banks" name="Cantonal_banks"></a><h2>Cantonal banks</h2>

<p>There are, as of 2006, 24 <a href="/wiki/Cantonal_bank" id="w">cantonal banks</a>; these banks are state-guaranteed semi-governmental organizations controlled by one of <a href="/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland" id="w">Switzerland&#39;s 26 cantons</a> that engage in all banking businesses.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> The largest cantonal bank, the Zürich Cantonal Bank, had a 2005 net income of CHF 810 million.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Banking_privacy" name="Banking_privacy"></a><h1>Banking privacy</h1>
<p>{{See also}}</p>
<p>Swiss bank secrecy protects private banking information; the protections afforded under Swiss law are similar to confidentiality protections between doctors and patients or lawyers and their clients. The Swiss government views the right to <a href="/wiki/Privacy" id="w">privacy</a> as a fundamental principle that should be protected by all <a href="/wiki/Democratic" id="w">democratic</a> countries. While secrecy is protected, in practice all bank accounts are linked to an identified individual, and a prosecutor or judge may issue a &#34;lifting order&#34; in order to grant law enforcement access to information relevant to a criminal investigation.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Taxation" name="Taxation"></a><h2>Taxation</h2>

<p>Swiss law distinguishes between <a href="/wiki/Tax_evasion" id="w">tax evasion</a> and tax fraud. If any holdings are not declared to the <a href="/wiki/Tax" id="w">taxation</a> authorities, a natural or legal person commits tax evasion. Tax evasion is not considered an offence, but only a misdemeanour. It is assumed that failed declaration of one&#39;s assets is not sufficient evidence for criminal intent, as the chance of unintentional failure is too high. However, tax fraud is considered a criminal offence under Swiss law and prosecuted according to the Swiss Penal Code. A forged tax declaration, like the statement of significantly below-market valuation of real estate or the counterfeiting of bank statements, is such a criminal offence of tax fraud.</p>
<a id="European_Union" name="European_Union"></a><h4>European Union</h4>

<p>Pressure on Switzerland has been applied by several states and international organizations attempting to alter the Swiss privacy policy. The <a href="/wiki/European_Union" id="w">European Union</a>, whose member countries geographically surround Switzerland, has complained about member states&#39; nationals using Swiss banks to avoid taxation in their home countries. The EU has long sought a harmonized tax regime among its member states, although many Swiss banking officials (and, according to some polls, the public) are resisting any such changes.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since <a href="/wiki/July_1" id="w">July 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, Switzerland has charged a <a href="/wiki/European_Union_withholding_tax" id="w">withholding tax</a> on all interest earned in the personal Swiss accounts of European Union residents.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Money_laundering" name="Money_laundering"></a><h2>Money laundering</h2>

<p>There are several measures in place to counter <a href="/wiki/Money_laundering" id="w">money laundering</a>.

Some bank accounts are afforded an extra degree of privacy.

However, the information required to open such an account is no different from that of an ordinary account; completely anonymous accounts are prohibited by law. Should a criminal investigation take place, law enforcement has access to information related to a numbered account in the same way it has access to information about any other account.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
