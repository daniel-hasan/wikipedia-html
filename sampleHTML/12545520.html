<p><b><i>Where We Land</i></b> is the first studio <a href="/wiki/Album" id="w">album</a> by <a href="/wiki/Irish_Australian" id="w">Irish Australian</a> <a href="/wiki/Singer-songwriter" id="w">singer-songwriter</a> <a href="/wiki/Damien_Leith" id="w">Damien Leith</a>. It was released by <a href="/wiki/Sony_BMG" id="w">Sony BMG</a> in <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_18" id="w">August 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, and in <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_28" id="w">September 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>. Leith produced the album for seven months and created the album entirely with <a href="/wiki/Acoustic_music" id="w">acoustic</a> songs. He wrote or co-wrote nine of the twelve songs, collaborating with <a href="/wiki/Alex_Lloyd" id="w">Alex Lloyd</a> and his music director <a href="/wiki/Paul_Gray_(songwriter)" id="w">Paul Gray</a> (<a href="/wiki/Wa_Wa_Nee" id="w">Wa Wa Nee</a>) in a few songs. All of his original songs were inspired by his friends and family. Leith included two <a href="/wiki/Cover_version" id="w">cover songs</a> in the album, <a href="/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac" id="w">Fleetwood Mac</a>&#39;s &#34;Songbird&#34; from the album <i><a href="/wiki/Rumours" id="w">Rumours</a></i> and the traditional Irish song &#34;<a href="/wiki/Danny_Boy" id="w">Danny Boy</a>&#34;. <i>Where We Land</i> received mostly average reviews from critics. It debuted in the <a href="/wiki/ARIA_Charts" id="w">Australian Albums Chart</a> at number-one and was certified <a href="/wiki/Music_recording_sales_certification" id="w">platinum</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Recording_Industry_Association" id="w">Australian Recording Industry Association</a>. The album spawned the singles &#34;<a href="/wiki/22_Steps" id="w">22 Steps</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/All_I_Want_Is_You_(Damien_Leith_song)" id="w">All I Want Is You</a>&#34;. Leith embarked on a national tour across Australia to promote the album in November 2007.</p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h1>Background</h1>

<p>Damien Leith stated how his debut studio album wanted to pan out: &#34;I didn&#39;t really want to do anybody else&#39;s songs... I just wanted this album to be mine&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Why Damien Leith's flying high_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Why Damien Leith's flying high" title="">[1]</a></sup> Immediately after <i><a href="/wiki/Australian_Idol" id="w">Australian Idol</a></i> concluded, he convinced the producers of the show to break from protocol by giving him longer time to record the album.<sup id="_ref-One hell of a journey_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-One hell of a journey" title="">[2]</a></sup> The protocol was that the <i>Australian Idol</i> winners had only one week after the competition ended to record their first album. He decided to work on his first studio album for the next few months.<sup id="_ref-Why Damien Leith's flying high_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Why Damien Leith's flying high" title="">[1]</a></sup> Leith was aware of the little success of the previous two <i>Idol</i> winners, <a href="/wiki/Casey_Donovan_(singer)" id="w">Casey Donovan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kate_DeAraugo" id="w">Kate DeAraugo</a>, so he decided to turn something more palpable than the previous winners by producing an album of original songs. He comments, &#34;I suppose the main thing for me was trying to establish myself as a songwriter out of it because that&#39;s something that hasn&#39;t really been promoted in the past.&#34;<sup id="_ref-One hell of a journey_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-One hell of a journey" title="">[2]</a></sup> He was determined to create as much original material as possible for the album, and create songs that truly represent who he was.<sup id="_ref-Damien Leith releases album of originals_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Damien Leith releases album of originals" title="">[3]</a></sup> He also wanted the themes in the lyrics to not only be personal, but broad enough so that listeners can relate to them.<sup id="_ref-Why Damien Leith's flying high_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Why Damien Leith's flying high" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Production_and_recording" name="Production_and_recording"></a><h1>Production and recording</h1>

<p>Leith remarked that recording the album was an exciting but nerve-racking experience.<sup id="_ref-Edgy start to songs in the attic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Edgy start to songs in the attic" title="">[4]</a></sup> He recorded his music at <a href="/wiki/Sony_BMG" id="w">Sony BMG</a>&#39;s recording studio in <a href="/wiki/East_Sydney" id="w">East Sydney</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> His producers already had in mind what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally <a href="/wiki/Acoustic_music" id="w">acoustic</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new <i>Australian Idol</i>, he knew that it was risky to produce an acoustic based album because it was very different from the records produced by the previous <i>Idol</i> contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat <a href="/wiki/Pop_music" id="w">pop</a> songs. He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.<sup id="_ref-Damien Leith releases album of originals_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Damien Leith releases album of originals" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a result, he and his producers spent the time to work on the songs which would appeal to a broader audience. Leith did this by holding onto several elements in his music that people had enjoyed on <i>Australian Idol</i>.<sup id="_ref-Q&A with Damien Leith_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q&A with Damien Leith" title="">[7]</a></sup> However, he still wanted to show new elements to the album, so he held on some elements of acoustic music. Leith comments,</p>
<p /><blockquote>&#34;We didn&#39;t want to be too acoustic, or too rocky. I&#39;ve been conscious of the people who bought <i><a href="/wiki/The_Winner%26%2339%3Bs_Journey" id="w">The Winner&#39;s Journey</a></i>, but also conscious about grabbing a new audience as well... I think this album&#39;s got all those kind of <i>Winner&#39;s Journey</i> elements â€“ the falsetto and the emotional thing. But it&#39;s got a lot of me in it too.&#34;<sup id="_ref-One hell of a journey_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-One hell of a journey" title="">[2]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Damien Leith was also conscious of the lyrics we wrote. He added a few emotional <a href="/wiki/Ballad_(music)" id="w">ballads</a> which contained strong lyrics, but had left out the songs he thought were too depressing.<sup id="_ref-Q&A with Damien Leith_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q&A with Damien Leith" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Leith spent seven months of recording and writing and worked with Bryon Jones, James Roche and Ross Fraser. Initially, he wanted the album to he released in March, but it was pushed back to August, partly due to the prolonged success of <i>The Winner&#39;s Journey</i> and partly because of the large amount of songs they had to cull.<sup id="_ref-One hell of a journey_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-One hell of a journey" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="Writing_and_inspiration" name="Writing_and_inspiration"></a><h1>Writing and inspiration</h1>

<p>The songs he wrote were inspired by his family and friends. A few of the songs explored the themes of <a href="/wiki/Love" id="w">love</a> and fulfillment. &#34;Not Just for the Weekend&#34; was a song he wrote after the birth of his second son, Jagger. The song &#34;Beautiful&#34; is a love song written to his wife Eileen.<sup id="_ref-Damien Leith releases album of originals_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Damien Leith releases album of originals" title="">[3]</a></sup> Other songs in the album explored much darker themes. &#34;Blew It All Away&#34; is a heartfelt song about the <a href="/wiki/Suicide" id="w">suicide</a> of a friend, which happened shortly after another friend died from cancer. Another song, &#34;Alone&#34; was inspired from a friend who was struggling after his father&#39;s death. &#34;Shine Like the Sun&#34; is about a friend in <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a> who was experiencing a rough relationship.<sup id="_ref-Edgy start to songs in the attic_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Edgy start to songs in the attic" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Leith wrote or co-wrote a total of nine tracks out of the twelve in the album. Incidentally, the first single and the opening track &#34;<a href="/wiki/22_Steps" id="w">22 Steps</a>&#34; was a song he did not write; it was written by <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canadian</a> <a href="/wiki/Singer-songwriter" id="w">singer-songwriter</a> <a href="/wiki/Andy_Stochansky" id="w">Andy Stochansky</a>. Another non-original track Leith recorded was a <a href="/wiki/Cover_song" id="w">cover</a> of <a href="/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac" id="w">Fleetwood Mac</a>&#39;s &#34;Songbird&#34; from their album <i><a href="/wiki/Rumours" id="w">Rumours</a></i>. This song holds special meaning for Leith, as his sister sang this song during his and Eileen&#39;s wedding.<sup id="_ref-No new Leith on life_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-No new Leith on life" title="">[8]</a></sup> Leith collaborated with Australian writers in a few songs, including <a href="/wiki/Alex_Lloyd" id="w">Alex Lloyd</a> who co-wrote with Leith the songs &#34;Beautiful&#34; and &#34;Blew It All Away&#34;.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> They also wrote four other songs which they did not include in the album because they were too <a href="/wiki/Alternative_rock" id="w">alternative</a>.<sup id="_ref-One hell of a journey_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-One hell of a journey" title="">[2]</a></sup> His musical director <a href="/wiki/Paul_Gray_(songwriter)" id="w">Paul Gray</a> of <a href="/wiki/Wa_Wa_Nee" id="w">Wa Wa Nee</a> co-wrote the track &#34;Alone&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Q&A with Damien Leith_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Q&A with Damien Leith" title="">[7]</a></sup> He left out his debut single &#34;<a href="/wiki/Night_of_My_Life" id="w">Night of My Life</a>&#34;, originally written for his win on <i>Idol</i>, because he could not relate to the lyrics in his everyday life, only within the context of the show.<sup id="_ref-One hell of a journey_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-One hell of a journey" title="">[2]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Sony_BMG" id="w">Sony BMG</a> added a raw bonus track, the traditional Irish song &#34;<a href="/wiki/Danny_Boy" id="w">Danny Boy</a>&#34; which Leith did a one-take recording of for a fan. Initially, Leith was hesitant to include it in the album because it was so raw.<sup id="_ref-Edgy start to songs in the attic_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Edgy start to songs in the attic" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Damien Leith chose to name the album <i>Where We Land</i> as it described all the things that happened to him in the past year individually and professionally, and also illustrated his journey to Australia in various ways.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>Responses from critics have given mostly average reviews of the album. Polly Coufos from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sunday_Times_(Australia)" id="w">The Sunday Times</a></i> considers Damien Leith as &#34;the most complete artist <i>Australian Idol</i> has yet uncovered&#34;. Coufos rated the album 3.5 stars, and comments that &#34;Leith uses that heavenly <a href="/wiki/Falsetto" id="w">falsetto</a> as often as possible without making himself appear a one-trick pony&#34;. Coufos, however says that the two cover songs, &#34;Songbird&#34; and &#34;Danny Boy&#34; are an &#34;unnecessary hedging of bets&#34;.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Andrew Murfett from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Age" id="w">The Age</a></i> notices the album&#39;s different arrangement from the previous <i>Idol</i> debuts and considers it to be better than those, but says that the album still contains too many <a href="/wiki/Ballad_(music)" id="w">ballad</a> songs. Murfett remarks &#34;Songbird&#34; as a good choice for a cover song.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Lauren Katulka from &#39;Oz Music Scene&#39; compliments Leith&#39;s songwriting and composing, and says that <i>Where We Land</i> &#34;is a great indication of the potential of Australia&#39;s revamped <i>Idol</i> franchise&#34;.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Lucy Tyler from the Sydney Anglican Network says that though the album is well-produced; it is unbalanced and bland, and &#34;its lack of variety means that it gives listeners little to think about&#34;. Tyler notes that <i>Where We Land</i> focuses on the melancholic aspects of life and remarks that &#34;Leith appears to have forgotten that life can sometimes be happy, too&#34;.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
