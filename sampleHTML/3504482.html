<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Fictional_universe" id="w">fictional universe</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Babylon_5" id="w">Babylon 5</a></i>, <b>spoo</b> is a valuable and highly desired food product. Made from the <a href="/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" id="w">alien</a> <a href="/wiki/Worm" id="w">worm-like</a> creatures of the same name, spoo is considered to be the most delicious food in the <a href="/wiki/Milky_Way" id="w">galaxy</a>, regardless of which species is asked. Although it is a universally loved foodstuff and an actively traded <a href="/wiki/Commodity" id="w">commodity</a>, the creature itself is regarded with contempt by the races that consume it. </p>
<p>Since its introduction on the <i>Babylon 5</i> television series, spoo has remained popular among fans of the <a href="/wiki/Space_opera" id="w">science fiction saga</a>, spawning everything from attempts to cook their own version of spoo, to <a href="/wiki/Fan_fiction" id="w">fan fiction</a> related to the creatures. &#34;Spoo&#34; is also used variously outside the <i>Babylon 5</i> universe and fan community as a nonsense word.</p>

<p>Spoo appeared in the first episode of the <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a> <a href="/wiki/Television_series" id="w">television series</a> <i>Babylon 5</i>, when it was briefly mentioned by the <a href="/wiki/Narn" id="w">Narn</a> <a href="/wiki/Ambassador_(diplomacy)" id="w">Ambassador</a>, <a href="/wiki/G%26%2339%3BKar" id="w">G&#39;Kar</a>.<sup id="_ref-Midnight_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Midnight" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski" id="w">J.

<p>After several years of cryptic answers, Straczynski finally made a post explaining what Spoo was. His answer stated that spoo were tiny, pasty, <a href="/wiki/Mealworm" id="w">mealworm</a>-like creatures that were 
regarded with contempt by most of the <a href="/wiki/Civilizations_in_Babylon_5" id="w">sentient species that have encountered it</a>. According to Straczynski, spoo &#34;are the only creatures of which the Interstellar Animal Rights Protection League says, simply, &#39;Kill &#39;em.&#39;&#34;<sup id="_ref-JMSspoopost_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JMSspoopost" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The process of raising spoo was described by Straczynski in comical detail. The creatures are raised on ranches on planets with moist and chilly <a href="/wiki/Climate" id="w">climates</a>, not because the creatures thrive in such environs, but because it produces the best level of paleness in the creatures&#39; skin. Starting a spoo ranch is relatively easy: the only requirement is to place 200 spoo in the middle of the ranch and wait. Within a short period of time, they have reproduced in sufficient numbers and harvesting can commence, with the preferred method being a simple whack with a stick. Little physical effort is required to cull the herds—spoo are incapable of moving more than six&#160;inches (15&#160;cm) in a year, tend to stay propped up against one another &#34;ostensibly for mutual protection,&#34; with attempts at movement usually ending up in the creatures toppling over. The primary difficulty in spoo ranching is in the only sound the creatures make: loud, continuous sighing. The only protection against the sighing is the use of earmuffs, which eventually cannot block the sheer volume of sighs as the harvest progresses—when whacked, a spoo simply sighs more loudly.  The sighing often triggers bouts of <a href="/wiki/Major_depression" id="w">major depression</a>, with some ranchers even going <a href="/wiki/Insanity" id="w">mad</a> from the incessant sighs.<sup id="_ref-JMSspoopost_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JMSspoopost" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Although mostly relegated to a background role, spoo was once involved in a significant way in a plot. In the season 5 episode <i><a href="/wiki/A_Tragedy_of_Telepaths" id="w">A Tragedy of Telepaths</a></i>, the fact that Narn prefer fresh spoo while the <a href="/wiki/Centauri" id="w">Centauri</a> prefer it aged was the reason that <a href="/wiki/G%26%2339%3BKar" id="w">G&#39;Kar</a> was able to figure out that there was another Narn in the Centauri Royal Palace.<sup id="_ref-Tragedy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tragedy" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>As befitting a fan-favorite reference, Spoo made a number of appearances in the series, most recently in the DVD release <i><a href="/wiki/Babylon_5:_The_Lost_Tales" id="w">Babylon 5: The Lost Tales</a></i>, where <a href="/wiki/John_Sheridan_(Babylon_5)" id="w">President Sheridan</a> at one point jokes that the product is &#34;Spoo: The other gray meat.&#34;<sup id="_ref-OverThere_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OverThere" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<a id="Commodity" name="Commodity"></a><h2>Commodity</h2>
<p>As a widely consumed food product, like coffee or beef, spoo is a traded commodity, where the price of the product at the consumer level is dictated by the price on common <a href="/wiki/Stock_exchange" id="w">exchanges</a>. During one episode the price of a spoo sandwich is stated as ten <a href="/wiki/Fictional_currency" id="w">credits</a> an ounce; at the end of the same episode it is stated as fifteen credits.<sup id="_ref-Gallery_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gallery" title="">[10]</a></sup> While this could be a simple mistake by Straczynski, a bit of <a href="/wiki/Fanon_(fiction)" id="w">fanon</a> assumes that it is an intentional reference to spoo&#39;s exorbitant volatility in the market.<sup id="_ref-LurkersNote_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LurkersNote" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike other products, not only is spoo a tradable commodity, but spoo ranches themselves, like large corporations, sell shares.<sup id="_ref-Geometry_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Geometry" title="">[12]</a></sup> It is not known if this is facilitated by spoo&#39;s immense popularity or because the ranches&#39; value is exacerbated by their rarity (due to the difficulty of, and disproportionately high suicide rate in, spoo ranching).</p>

<p>In 1998, Boxtree UK published a <i>Babylon 5</i> cookbook, officially licensed from Warner Bros.<sup id="_ref-cookbook_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cookbook" title="">[13]</a></sup> Presented as if written around the year 2260, the time when most of the <i>Babylon 5</i> series takes place, the book contains many recipes for the various foods mentioned and seen throughout the series. Included were recipes for Narn-style spoo and Centauri-style spoo, both using currently available ingredients, with sea <a href="/wiki/Scallops" id="w">scallops</a> taking the place of spoo. </p>
<p>Many fans have attempted to make &#34;spoo&#34; on their own. One common method is the use of <a href="/wiki/Tofu" id="w">tofu</a>, itself a rather versatile and nondescript food with a pale color. There have been times when Straczynski has been eating at a restaurant or event, and a fan will send over a plate of food, christened &#34;spoo.&#34;<sup id="_ref-SpooPlate_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SpooPlate" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

Straczynski was not the first person to use the word spoo - uses can be found in <a href="/wiki/Popular_culture" id="w">popular culture</a> since the 1970s, sometimes as a replacement for <i>stuff</i>, as was the case with its first recorded use on USENET in 1989,<sup id="_ref-spoofirst_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spoofirst" title="">[15]</a></sup> and later as a misspelling of <i>spew</i>. The earliest known print usage was as an exclamation in a 1971 <a href="/wiki/Beetle_Bailey" id="w">Beetle Bailey</a> comic strip, as a play on the reverse spelling of &#34;oops.&#34;<sup id="_ref-BeetleSpoo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BeetleSpoo" title="">[16]</a></sup> In 1979 <a href="/wiki/Barnes_%26amp%3B_Barnes" id="w">Barnes &#38; Barnes</a> recorded the song &#34;Three Drunk Newts&#34; which begins with what has been interpreted as the two of them yelling &#34;Spoo!&#34;. According to <i>Slang and Euphemism</i>, <i>spoo</i> is a slang term for <a href="/wiki/Ejaculate" id="w">ejaculate</a>, etymologically derived from <i>spew</i>, and cited by linguist <a href="/wiki/Pamela_Munro" id="w">Pamela Munro</a> in a paper on 1980s collegiate slang at <a href="/wiki/UCLA" id="w">UCLA</a>.<sup id="_ref-UCLA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UCLA" title="">[17]</a></sup> One <a href="/wiki/Blog" id="w">blogger</a> claims to have had <i>spoo</i> attached to him as a nickname in the mid-1980s on various <a href="/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" id="w">message boards</a>, rejecting Straczynski&#39;s popularization of the term, although Straczynski&#39;s first use of the word predates his.<sup id="_ref-Spoonet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spoonet" title="">[18]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Frank_Zappa" id="w">Frank Zappa</a> used the word as a euphemism for semen in the song &#34;What Kind of Girl?&#34;, which appears on the 1988 live album <i><a href="/wiki/Broadway_the_Hard_Way" id="w">Broadway the Hard Way</a></i>. He claimed in <i>The Real Frank Zappa Book</i> to have learned the word from guitarist Ike Willis, and also used <i>spoo</i> to mean self-indulgent &#34;musical <a href="/wiki/Masturbation" id="w">masturbation</a>,&#34; in which musicians play an extended solo primarily for their own enjoyment rather than to enhance the musical experience of the audience.<sup id="_ref-Zappa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zappa" title="">[19]</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Straczynski&#39;s own usage of the word predates <i>Babylon 5</i>. Straczynski was a writer in the 1985 cartoon series <i><a href="/wiki/She-Ra" id="w">She-Ra Princess of Power</a></i>. After a fan recalled a possible spoo reference from that show, Straczynski replied, &#34;[Yes], I slipped some spoo in there once.
