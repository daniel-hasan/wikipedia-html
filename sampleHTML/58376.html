The <b>École Polytechnique Massacre</b>, also known as the <b>Montreal Massacre</b>, occurred on <a href="/wiki/December_6" id="w">December 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/1989" id="w">1989</a> at the <a href="/wiki/École_Polytechnique_de_Montr%C3%A9al" id="w">École Polytechnique</a> in <a href="/wiki/Montreal" id="w">Montreal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quebec" id="w">Quebec</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>. Twenty-five year-old <a href="/wiki/Marc_L%C3%A9pine" id="w">Marc Lépine</a>, armed with a legally obtained <a href="/wiki/Semi-automatic_rifle" id="w">semi-automatic rifle</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Hunting_knife" id="w">hunting knife</a>,  shot twenty-eight people, killing fourteen (all of them women) and injuring the other fourteen before killing himself. He began his attack by entering a classroom at the university, where he separated the male and female students. After claiming that he was &#34;fighting <a href="/wiki/Feminism" id="w">feminism</a>&#34;, he shot all nine women in the room, killing six. He then moved through corridors, the cafeteria, and another classroom, specifically targetting women to shoot. He killed fourteen women and injured four men and ten women in just under twenty minutes before turning the gun on himself.<sup id="_ref-coroner_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-coroner" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-injured_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-injured" title="">[2]</a></sup> <br/></p>
<p>Lépine was the child of a <a href="/wiki/French_Canadian" id="w">French-Canadian</a> mother and an <a href="/wiki/Algeria" id="w">Algerian</a> father, and had been physically abused by his father during his childhood.  His suicide note claimed political motives and blamed feminists for ruining his life. The note included a list of nineteen Quebec women whom Lépine considered to be feminists and apparently wished to kill.<sup id="_ref-Chun_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chun" title="">[3]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Since the attack, Canadians have debated various interpretations of the events, their significance, and Lépine&#39;s motives. Many feminist groups and public officials have characterized the massacre as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal violence against women.<sup id="_ref-kay_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kay" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Eglin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eglin" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Day_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Day" title="">[6]</a></sup> Consequently, the anniversary of the massacre has since been commemorated as the <a href="/wiki/National_Day_of_Remembrance_and_Action_on_Violence_Against_Women" id="w">National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women</a>. Other interpretations emphasize Lépine&#39;s abuse as a child or suggest that the massacre was simply the isolated act of a madman, unrelated to larger social issues.<sup id="_ref-Eglin_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eglin" title="">[5]</a></sup> Still other commentators have blamed violence in the media<sup id="_ref-cernea_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cernea" title="">[7]</a></sup> and increasing poverty, isolation, and alienation in society,<sup id="_ref-Valpy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Valpy" title="">[8]</a></sup>  particularly in immigrant communities.<sup id="_ref-Wong_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wong" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The incident led to more stringent <a href="/wiki/Gun_control" id="w">gun control</a> laws in <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>,<sup id="_ref-Dec6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dec6" title="">[10]</a></sup> and changes in the tactical response of police to shootings, which were later credited with minimizing casualties at the <a href="/wiki/Dawson_College_shooting" id="w">Dawson College shootings</a>.<sup id="_ref-Dawson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dawson" title="">[11]</a></sup><br/></p>

<p>Lépine sat for a time in the office of the registrar on the second floor. He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10&#160;p.m.<sup id="_ref-coroner_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-coroner" title="">[1]</a></sup> After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave.<sup id="_ref-cernea_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cernea" title="">[7]</a></sup> Speaking in French, he asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied &#34;no&#34;, he answered: &#34;I am fighting feminism&#34;. One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, &#34;Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life.&#34; Lépine responded that &#34;You&#39;re women, you&#39;re going to be engineers. You&#39;re all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists.&#34; He then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost.<sup id="_ref-coroner_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-coroner" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Chun_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chun" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Before leaving the room, he wrote the word <i>shit</i> twice on a student project.<sup id="_ref-cernea_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cernea" title="">[7]</a></sup></p> 
<p>Lépine continued into the second floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where he twice attempted to shoot a female student. His weapon failed to fire so he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun. He returned to the room he had just left, but the students had locked the door; Lépine failed to unlock it with three shots fired into the door. Moving along the corridor he shot at others, wounding one, before moving towards the financial services office where he shot and killed a woman through the window of the door she had just locked.<sup id="_ref-coroner_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-coroner" title="">[1]</a></sup><br/></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The third floor classroom in the École Polytechnique in which the attack ended</div></p>
<p>He next went down to the first floor cafeteria, in which about a hundred people were gathered. The crowd scattered after he shot a woman standing near the kitchens and wounded another student. Entering an unlocked storage area at the end of the cafeteria, Lépine shot and killed two more women hiding there. He told a male and female student to come out from under a table; they complied and were not shot.<sup id="_ref-coroner_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-coroner" title="">[1]</a></sup><br/></p>
<p>Lépine then walked up an escalator to the third floor where he shot and wounded one female and two male students in the corridor. He entered another classroom and told the three students giving a presentation to &#34;get out&#34;, shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair, who was standing on the low platform at the front of the classroom. He fired on students in the front row and then killed two women who were trying to escape the room, while other students dove under their desks. Lépine moved towards some of the female students, wounding three of them and killing another. He changed the magazine in his weapon and moved to the front of the class, shooting in all directions. At this point, the wounded Leclair asked for help and, after unsheathing his hunting knife, Lépine stabbed her three times, killing her. He took off his cap, wrapped his coat around his rifle, exclaimed &#34;Oh, shit&#34;, and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, twenty minutes after having begun his attack. About sixty bullets remained in the boxes he carried with him. He had killed fourteen women in total (twelve engineering students, one nursing student and one employee of the university) and injured fourteen others, including four men.<sup id="_ref-coroner_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-coroner" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-injured_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-injured" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

Marc Lépine was born Gamil Gharbi to a French-Canadian mother and an Algerian father.

<p>The massacre profoundly shocked Canadians.

In addition, though an extensive police investigation into Marc Lépine and the killings took place,<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> the resulting report was not made public, though a copy was used by the coroner as a source in her investigation.<sup id="_ref-coroner_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-coroner" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup>  The media, academics, women&#39;s organizations, and family members of the victims protested the lack of a public inquiry and paucity of information released.<sup id="_ref-cernea_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cernea" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Chun_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chun" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

<p>The gender of Marc Lépine&#39;s victims as well as his oral statements during the massacre and suicide note quickly led to the event being seen as an <a href="/wiki/Antifeminism" id="w">antifeminist</a> attack and as an example of the wider issue of violence against women.<sup id="_ref-Eglin_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eglin" title="">[5]</a></sup> His mother later wondered if the attack was not directed at her, as some would have considered her a feminist since she was a single, working mother.<sup id="_ref-mother_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mother" title="">[23]</a></sup> Others, including television journalist <a href="/wiki/Barbara_Frum" id="w">Barbara Frum</a>, questioned why people insisted on &#34;diminishing&#34; the tragedy by &#34;suggesting that it was an act against just one group?&#34;<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup>  <br/></p>
<p>As predicted by Marc Lépine in his suicide letter,<sup id="_ref-citynews_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-citynews" title="">[22]</a></sup> some saw the event as the isolated act of a madman.<sup id="_ref-Eglin_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Eglin" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Chun_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chun" title="">[3]</a></sup> A psychiatrist interviewed Lépine&#39;s family and friends and examined his writings as part of the police investigation. He noted that Marc Lépine defined <a href="/wiki/Suicide" id="w">suicide</a> as his primary motivation, and that he chose a specific suicide method. Killing one’s self after killing others (multiple homicide/suicide strategy) is considered a sign of a serious <a href="/wiki/Personality_disorder" id="w">personality disorder</a>.<sup id="_ref-coroner_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-coroner" title="">[1]</a></sup> Other psychiatrists emphasized the traumatic events of his childhood, suggesting that the blows he had received may have caused <a href="/wiki/Brain_damage" id="w">brain damage</a>, or that Lépine was <a href="/wiki/Psychotic" id="w">psychotic</a>, having lost touch with reality as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal (yet largely absent) father while unconsciously identifying with a violent <a href="/wiki/Masculinity" id="w">masculinity</a> that dominated women.

<p>Police response to the shootings was heavily criticized for the amount of time it gave Lépine to carry out the massacre.

The massacre was a major spur for the Canadian gun control movement.

The gun registry in particular has been a controversial and partisan issue, with critics charging that it was a political move by the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Liberal</a> government of <a href="/wiki/Jean_Chr%C3%A9tien" id="w">Jean Chrétien</a> that has been expensive and impractical to enforce.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Harper" id="w">Stephen Harper</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada" id="w">Conservative</a> government has extended the deadline for gun registration and has enacted legislation waiving penalties for non-compliance on the grounds that mandatory enforcement would target shooters and hunters rather than criminals. Criticism of this position and support for the registry have intensified in the wake of other <a href="/wiki/School_shooting" id="w">school shootings</a> at Dawson College and <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Tech_massacre" id="w">Virginia Tech</a>.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>

<p>The massacre galvanized the Canadian women&#39;s movement, who see it as a symbol of <a href="/wiki/Violence_against_women" id="w">violence against women</a>. &#34;The death of those young women would not be in vain, we promised&#34;, Canadian feminist <a href="/wiki/Judy_Rebick" id="w">Judy Rebick</a> recalled. &#34;We would turn our mourning into organizing to put an end to male violence against women.&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup><br/></p>
<p>In response to the killings a House of Commons Sub-Committee on the Status of Women was created. It released a report &#34;The War against Women&#34; in June 1991.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup>  Following its recommendations, the federal government established the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women in August 1991. The panel issued a final report, &#34;Changing the Landscape: Ending Violence – Achieving Equality&#34;, in June 1993. The panel proposed a two-pronged &#34;National Action Plan&#34; consisting of an &#34;Equality Action Plan&#34; and a &#34;Zero Tolerance Policy&#34; designed to increase women’s equality and reduce violence against women through government policy. Critics of the panel said that the plan failed to provide a workable timeline and strategy for implementation and that with over four hundred recommendations, the final report failed to make an impact.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup><br/></p>

The feminist movement is periodically criticized for appropriating the massacre as a symbol of male violence against women. For example, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Rackoff" id="w">Charles Rackoff</a>, a <a href="/wiki/University_of_Toronto" id="w">University of Toronto</a> <a href="/wiki/Computer_science" id="w">computer science</a> professor, compared those organizing vigils marking the event to the <a href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan" id="w">Ku Klux Klan</a>. &#34;The point is to use the death of these people as an excuse to promote the feminist/extreme left-wing agenda&#34;, he wrote, adding that it is &#34;no more justified&#34; than the KKK using the &#34;murder of a white person by a black person as an excuse to promote their agenda.&#34;<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Less provocative critiques argue that Lépine was a &#34;lone gunman&#34; who does not represent men, and that violence against women is neither condoned nor encouraged officially or unofficially in western culture. In this perspective, feminist memorializing is considered socially divisive on the basis of gender and therefore harmful by bestowing guilt on all men, irrespective of individual propensity to violence against women.<sup id="_ref-kay_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kay" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Men have also been subjected to criticism since the incident. Male survivors of the massacre have been condemned for not intervening to stop Lépine. In an interview immediately after the event, a reporter asked one of the men why they &#34;abandoned&#34; the women when it was clear that Lépine&#39;s targets were women.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup>   <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Marc_Jalbert" id="w">René Jalbert</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Serjeant-at-Arms" id="w">sergeant-at-arms</a> who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack, said that someone should have intervened at least to distract Lépine, but acknowledged that &#34;ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror.&#34;<sup id="_ref-macleans_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-macleans" title="">[14]</a></sup>    Newspaper columnist <a href="/wiki/Mark_Steyn" id="w">Mark Steyn</a> suggested that the male inaction during the massacre illustrated a &#34;culture of passivity&#34; prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled Lépine’s shooting spree: &#34;Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine/Gharbi but the professors and the men in that classroom, who, ordered to leave by the lone gunman, meekly did so, and abandoned their female classmates to their fate—an act of abdication that would have been unthinkable in almost any other culture throughout human history.&#34;<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup><br/>Male students and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings,<sup id="_ref-cernea_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cernea" title="">[7]</a></sup> but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt that nothing could have been done to prevent the tragedy, and that her fellow students should not feel guilty.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
