The <b>Animal Liberation Front</b> (ALF) is a name used internationally by <a href="/wiki/Animal_rights" id="w">animal liberation</a> activists who engage in <a href="/wiki/Direct_action" id="w">direct action</a> on behalf of animals. This includes removing animals from laboratories or <a href="/wiki/Fur_farming" id="w">fur farms</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sabotage" id="w">sabotaging</a> facilities involved in <a href="/wiki/Animal_testing" id="w">animal testing</a> and other animal-based industries. According to ALF statements, any direct action that furthers the cause of animal liberation, where all reasonable precautions are taken not to endanger life, may be claimed as an ALF action.<sup id="_ref-Best8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best8" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ALF is not a group with a membership, but an example of a <a href="/wiki/Leaderless_resistance" id="w">leaderless resistance</a>. It sees itself as the modern-day equivalent of the <a href="/wiki/Underground_Railroad" id="w">Underground Railroad</a>,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> with activists removing animals from laboratories and farms, finding safe veterinary care for them, arranging safe houses, and operating sanctuaries where the animals live out the rest of their lives.<sup id="_ref-Keith_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Keith" title="">[4]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Covert_cell" id="w">Covert cells</a>, currently active in around 35 countries,<sup id="_ref-cells_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cells" title="">[5]</a></sup> operate <a href="/wiki/Clandestine" id="w">clandestinely</a> and independently of one other, with activists working on a need-to-know basis. A cell might consist of just one person. <a href="/wiki/Robin_Webb" id="w">Robin Webb</a>, who runs the <a href="/wiki/Animal_Liberation_Press_Office" id="w">Animal Liberation Press Office</a> in the UK, has said of this model of activism: &#34;That is why the ALF cannot be smashed, it cannot be effectively infiltrated, it cannot be stopped. You, each and every one of you: you are the ALF.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Webbinterview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Webbinterview" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The activists who speak on behalf of the ALF say that the movement is non-violent. In an interview for <i><a href="/wiki/Behind_the_Mask_(ALF)" id="w">Behind the Mask</a></i>, a 2006 documentary about the ALF, leading activist <a href="/wiki/Rod_Coronado" id="w">Rod Coronado</a> said: &#34;One thing that I know that separates us from the people we are constantly accused of being &#8212; that is, terrorists, violent criminals &#8212; is the fact that we have harmed no one.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Mask_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mask" title="">[7]</a></sup> There has nevertheless been widespread criticism that ALF spokespersons have failed to condemn acts of violence. Groups such as the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center" id="w">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC), which monitors U.S. domestic extremism, have noted the involvement of ALF activists in the <a href="/wiki/Stop_Huntingdon_Animal_Cruelty" id="w">Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty</a> campaign, which SPLC identifies as using &#34;frankly terroristic tactics similar to those of anti-abortion extremists.&#34;<sup id="_ref-SPLC2002_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SPLC2002" title="">[8]</a></sup> The ALF has been described as a domestic terrorist threat in the UK,<sup id="_ref-Dispatches1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dispatches1" title="">[9]</a></sup> and in January 2005, it was named as a terrorist threat by the United States <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Homeland_Security" id="w">Department of Homeland Security</a>.<sup id="_ref-CQ_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CQ" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Tolson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tolson" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>

<div class="thumbcaption">British animal rights activist <a href="/wiki/Ronnie_Lee" id="w">Ronnie Lee</a> founded the ALF in 1976.</div> 
The ALF&#39;s roots can be traced to 19th century England, and a small group of activists called the Bands of Mercy, which was set up in 1824 to thwart <a href="/wiki/Fox_hunting" id="w">fox hunters</a>.<sup id="_ref-Best19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best19" title="">[19]</a></sup> In 1965, the group was re-created, this time called the Hunt Saboteurs Association; it laid false scents, blew hunting horns to send the hounds in the wrong direction, set off smoke bombs, and members lay down between the hunters and the fox.</p>
<p>In 1972, activists <a href="/wiki/Ronnie_Lee" id="w">Ronnie Lee</a> and Cliff Goodman revived the 19th century name and set up the Band of Mercy, a more militant group, which attacked hunters&#39; vehicles by slashing tires and breaking windows. They progressed to attacking pharmaceutical laboratories and <a href="/wiki/Seal_hunting" id="w">seal-hunting</a> boats. On <a href="/wiki/November_10" id="w">November 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1973" id="w">1973</a>, they set fire to a building in <a href="/wiki/Milton_Keynes" id="w">Milton Keynes</a>, as part of a strategy to make insurance prohibitive for what they saw as exploitative industries, and thus began a campaign of arson that continues to this day.<sup id="_ref-Best20_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>In August 1974, Lee and Goodman were arrested for allegedly taking part in a raid on Oxford Laboratory Animal Colonies in Bicester, which earned them the name the &#34;Bicester Two.&#34; They were sentenced to three years in prison, but released after serving one.</p>
<p>After his release, Goodman allegedly became the first-ever police informer on the animal liberation movement, whereas Lee emerged from prison more militant than before.<sup id="_ref-Best20_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best20" title="">[20]</a></sup> He organized 30 activists to set up a new liberation campaign, and in 1976, in order to show that the new campaign was prepared to intimidate but was also compassionate, he named it the Animal Liberation Front.<sup id="_ref-Best20_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Robin_Webb" id="w">Robin Webb</a> has written that, during the 1970s and early 1980s, the media portrayed animal rights activists in a positive light, as animal lovers who were merely eccentric and taking things a little too far: the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Robin_Hood" id="w">Robin Hoods</a> of the animal welfare world.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Best77_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best77" title="">[30]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Ronnie_Lee" id="w">Ronnie Lee</a>, the ALF&#39;s founder, wrote in <i>Peace News</i> in 1974 that direct action should be &#34;limited only by reverence for life and hatred of violence,&#34;<sup id="_ref-Best83_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best83" title="">[31]</a></sup> and in 1979 that the ALF &#34;is not violent in that much care is taken to prevent injury to people and many raids have been called off because of possible confrontation.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Best83_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best83" title="">[31]</a></sup> Lee later said that he regrets the decision to create the ALF as non-violent, and that he now believes &#34;there would have been a place for limited violence against animal abusers.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Lee28_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lee28" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the mid-80s, activists realized that economic sabotage was more effective than demonstrations and handing out leaflets. Activists moved on to smashing butchers&#39; shop windows and setting fire to department stores that sold fur coats. British activist <a href="/wiki/Keith_Mann" id="w">Keith Mann</a> has said: &#34;[W]e all desperately want to fight animal abuse legally. It just doesn&#39;t work like that. The people who run this country, they have shares, they have investments in pharmaceutical companies, for example, who are experimenting on animals, so to think that you can write to these people, and say &#39;we don&#39;t like what you&#39;re doing, we want you to change,&#39; and expect them to do so, it&#39;s not going to happen.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Keith_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Keith" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1985, the <a href="/wiki/Animal_Rights_Militia" id="w">Animal Rights Militia</a> emerged, claiming responsibility for sending letter bombs to those involved in animal testing, and setting fire to stores on the Isle of Wight in 1994, causing £3 million worth of damages. <a href="/wiki/Barry_Horne" id="w">Barry Horne</a>, who was a close friend of Webb&#39;s, was subsequently jailed for 18 years for the attacks, later dying in jail during a hunger strike; Webb himself was almost charged with conspiracy in connection with the attacks.<sup id="_ref-Best78_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best78" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>In response to the emergence of this more violent strain of protest in the UK, the British police set up the Animal Rights National Index (ARNI) in or around 1985, which was intended to act as a liaison between the police and <a href="/wiki/MI5" id="w">MI5</a>, the internal security service, which had started to monitor activists.</p>
<p>Violence against property began to increase substantially after several high-profile campaigns managed to close down a number of facilities perceived to be abusive to animals — <a href="/wiki/Consort_Kennels" id="w">Consort Kennels</a>, a facility breeding beagles for animal testing; <a href="/wiki/Hillgrove_Farm" id="w">Hillgrove Farm</a>, which bred cats, and <a href="/wiki/Save_the_Newchurch_Guinea_Pigs" id="w">Newchurch Farm</a>, which bred guinea pigs, were all closed after being targeted by animal rights campaigns that appeared to involve the ALF. In the UK, the financial year 1991-1992 saw around 100 refrigerated meat trucks destroyed by incendiary devices at a cost of around £5 million. Butchers&#39; locks were superglued, shrink-wrapped meats were pierced in supermarkets, slaughterhouses and refrigerated meat trucks were set on fire.<sup id="_ref-Best78_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Best78" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

In May 1998, the ALF claimed responsibility for an attack on a processing plant owned by Florida Veal Processors, Inc., in <a href="/wiki/Wimauma%2C_Florida" id="w">Wimauma, Florida</a>, causing $500,000 worth of damage.<sup id="_ref-FBI_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FBI" title="">[21]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/December_5" id="w">December 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, the ALF sent a letter claiming responsibility for a bomb hoax at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California%2C_San_Diego" id="w">University of California, San Diego</a>&#39;s School of Medicine.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Evidence_of_increasingly_violent_attitude" name="Evidence_of_increasingly_violent_attitude"></a><h3>Evidence of increasingly violent attitude</h3>
<p>There is evidence that the ALF is increasingly moving towards more violent tactics. In 1999, ALF activists became involved in <a href="/wiki/Stop_Huntingdon_Animal_Cruelty" id="w">Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty</a> (SHAC), an international campaign that aims to close <a href="/wiki/Huntingdon_Life_Sciences" id="w">Huntingdon Life Sciences</a>, Europe&#39;s largest animal-testing laboratory. The <a href="/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center" id="w">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>, which monitors U.S. domestic extremism, has described SHAC&#39;s <i>modus operandi</i> as &#34;frankly terroristic tactics similar to those of anti-abortion extremists.&#34;<sup id="_ref-SPLC2002_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SPLC2002" title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>ALF activist Donald Currie was jailed for 12 years and placed on probation for life in December 2006 after being found guilty of planting homemade bombs on the doorsteps of businessmen with links to Huntingdon Life Sciences.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> When ALF activist David Blenkinsop and two others assaulted Huntingdon Life Sciences director <a href="/wiki/Brian_Cass" id="w">Brian Cass</a> with pick-axe handles in February 2001 &#8212; an attack so serious that Detective Chief Inspector Tom Hobbs of Cambridgeshire police remarked: &#34;It&#39;s only by sheer luck that we are not beginning a murder inquiry&#34;<sup id="_ref-Goodwin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Goodwin" title="">[36]</a></sup> &#8212; Ronnie Lee said: &#34;He has got off lightly. I have no sympathy for him.&#34;<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The ALF has made no secret of its commitment to SHAC. In May 2005, it issued a warning that direct action on behalf of the campaign:</p>

<p>In June 2006, the ALF claimed responsibility for a firebomb attack on <a href="/wiki/UCLA" id="w">UCLA</a> researcher Lynn Fairbanks. The Animal Liberation Press Office issued a statement saying that Fairbanks was conducting &#34;painful addiction experiments&#34; on monkeys,<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> although Fairbanks herself said she studies primate behavior and does not do invasive research.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> A firebomb was placed on the doorstep of a house occupied by Fairbanks&#39; 70 year-old neighbor and a tenant; according to the FBI, the device was lit, and was powerful enough to have killed the occupants, but it failed to ignite. The attack was credited by the acting chancellor of UCLA as helping to shape the <a href="/wiki/Animal_Enterprise_Terrorism_Act" id="w">Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act</a>, a bill before the U.S. Congress to give law enforcement officials more power when dealing with animal rights activism.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> ALF spokesman <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Vlasak" id="w">Jerry Vlasak</a> said of the attack on Fairbanks: &#34;force is a poor second choice, but if that&#39;s the only thing that will work ... there&#39;s certainly moral justification for that.&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Extensional_self-defense" name="Extensional_self-defense"></a><h3>Extensional self-defense</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Steven_Best" id="w">Steven Best</a> recently coined the term &#34;extensional self-defense&#34; to describe actions carried out in defense of animals by human beings acting as &#34;proxy agents.&#34;<sup id="_ref-BestLogic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BestLogic" title="">[42]</a></sup> He argues that, in carrying out acts of extensional self-defense, activists have the moral right to engage in acts of sabotage or even violence.<sup id="_ref-BestLogic_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BestLogic" title="">[42]</a></sup> Extensional self-defense is justified, he writes, because animals are &#34;so vulnerable and oppressed they cannot fight back to attack or kill their oppressors.&#34;<sup id="_ref-BestVlasak_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BestVlasak" title="">[43]</a></sup> Best argues that the principle of extensional self defense mirrors the penal code statues known as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Necessity_defense" id="w">necessity defense</a>,&#34; which can be invoked when a defendant believes that the illegal act was necessary to avoid imminent and great harm.<sup id="_ref-BestVlasak_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BestVlasak" title="">[43]</a></sup> In testimony to the Senate in 2005, <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Vlasak" id="w">Jerry Vlasak</a> stated that he regarded violence against Huntingdon Life Sciences as an example of extensional self-defense.<sup id="_ref-Miller_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Miller" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Other_groups" name="Other_groups"></a><h3> Other groups </h3>
<p>Activists who have engaged in direct action that could endanger life have acted using the names <a href="/wiki/Animal_Rights_Militia" id="w">Animal Rights Militia</a> (ARM) and the <a href="/wiki/Justice_Department_(animal_rights)" id="w">Justice Department</a>, which first appeared in the UK in 1985 and 1993 respectively, and the <a href="/wiki/Revolutionary_Cells_(RCALB)" id="w">Revolutionary Cells--Animal Liberation Brigade</a> (RCALB), which appeared in the US in 2003. <sup id="_ref-MIT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MIT" title="">[45]</a></sup> Actions claimed under these names tend to be more violent or extreme than standard ALF direct action. Whether there is any meaningful distinction between the ALF, ARM, RCALB and the Justice Department, in terms of the groups of people involved, is not known.</p>
<p>The Justice Department <a href="/wiki/Manifesto" id="w">manifesto</a>, posted on the ALF website, says: &#34;The Animal Liberation Front achieved what other methods have not while adhering to <a href="/wiki/Nonviolence" id="w">nonviolence</a>. A separate idea was established that decided animal abusers had been warned long enough ... [T]he time has come for abusers to have but a taste of the fear and anguish their victims suffer on a daily basis.&#34;<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>Robin Webb has said: &#34;[If] someone wishes to act as the Animal Rights Militia or the Justice Department ... the third policy of the ALF [opposition to violence] no longer applies.&#34;<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> He has said elsewhere that the &#34;only difference between ALF and the more radical ones is that ALF basically takes every precaution not to endanger life at any time. The Animal Rights Militia are prepared to twist the arm of animal abusers&#34;.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Oren Segal, co-director of <a href="/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League" id="w">Anti-Defamation League&#39;s</a> Center on Extremism, believes the ALF and RCALB consist of the same few &#34;lone wolves&#34;, telling <i>LA Weekly</i>, &#34;the names are interchangeable...they’re going to rename themselves depending on what actions they’re doing.&#34; <sup id="_ref-LA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LA" title="">[49]</a></sup> Professor <a href="/wiki/Paul_Wilkinson" id="w">Paul Wilkinson</a>, former director of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_St_Andrews" id="w">University of St Andrews</a> Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence, has written that the ALF, the Justice Department and the Animal Rights Militia are essentially the same. In a report on terrorism discussed in the House of Commons, Wilkinson argues that &#34;a cluster of small groups such as the so-called Justice Department of the Animal Liberation Front, and the Animal Rights Militia, have crossed the threshold from extra-parliamentary protest and demonstrations to what can only be described as acts of terrorism; incendiary attacks on shops and other premises and letter and parcel bombs.&#34;<sup id="_ref-WilkinsonHansard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WilkinsonHansard" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wilkinson cites as examples two attacks on scientists in 1990 &#8212; one in Bristol, which led to no injuries, and one in Porton Down, in which a researcher&#39;s 13-month-old child was hurt by shrapnel &#8212; as well as firebomb attacks in 1994 against shops in Newport, Isle of Wight, York, and Harrogate, one of which ALF activist <a href="/wiki/Barry_Horne" id="w">Barry Horne</a> was convicted.<sup id="_ref-WilkinsonHansard_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WilkinsonHansard" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center" id="w">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> has criticized the Department of Homeland Security for concentrating on the Animal and Earth Liberation Fronts rather than on white supremacists, writing that &#34;for all the property damage they have wreaked, eco-radicals have killed no one &#8212; something that cannot be said of the white supremacists and others who people the American radical right.&#34;<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> Senator <a href="/wiki/James_Jeffords" id="w">James Jeffords</a> said that the &#34;ELF and ALF may threaten dozens of people each year, but an incident at a chemical, nuclear or wastewater facility would threaten tens of thousands.&#34;<sup id="_ref-cnnatf_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cnnatf" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
