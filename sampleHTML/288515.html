<p>The <b>Clone Wars</b> (also known as the <b>Clone War</b>) are a series of fictional <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_galaxy" id="w">intragalactic</a> battles in <a href="/wiki/George_Lucas" id="w">George Lucas</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a> saga <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" id="w">Star Wars</a></i>. The conflict is first mentioned in <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" id="w">Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</a></i> (1977),<sup id="_ref-CloneWarsBasics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CloneWarsBasics" title="">[1]</a></sup> but not featured until the second and third episodes of the six-part <i>Star Wars</i> film series: <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_II:_Attack_of_the_Clones" id="w">Attack of the Clones</a></i> (2002) and <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_III:_Revenge_of_the_Sith" id="w">Revenge of the Sith</a></i> (2005). The animated <a href="/wiki/Microseries" id="w">microseries</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars:_Clone_Wars" id="w">Star Wars: Clone Wars</a></i> (2003-2005) chronicle the major campaigns of the war. Additional events and stories are detailed in a multimedia campaign consisting of <i>Star Wars</i> <a href="/wiki/Expanded_Universe_(Star_Wars)" id="w">literature and video games</a>. Many of the events featured have parallels in history, politics, and mythology from which Lucas and other writers drew inspiration. Critics and film historians debate which parallels are most prominent or consistent.</p>
<p>The Clone Wars begin during the Separatist Crisis when thousands of <a href="/wiki/Solar_system" id="w">star systems</a> <a href="/wiki/Seceded" id="w">seceded</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Republic_(Star_Wars)" id="w">Galactic Republic</a> to form the <a href="/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems" id="w">Confederacy of Independent Systems</a> (CIS). The <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Geonosis" id="w">first battle</a> occurs on the CIS planet <a href="/wiki/Geonosis" id="w">Geonosis</a> where the Republic&#39;s new <a href="/wiki/Clone_trooper" id="w">clone army</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Jedi" id="w">Jedi</a> generals, combats the Separatists&#39; <a href="/wiki/Battle_droids" id="w">battle droids</a>.  War quickly spreads across the galaxy and eventually reaches the Republic&#39;s capital, <a href="/wiki/Coruscant" id="w">Coruscant</a>. The Clone Wars end shortly after the <a href="/wiki/Great_Jedi_Purge" id="w">Great Jedi Purge</a>, the Separatist Massacre on <a href="/wiki/Mustafar" id="w">Mustafar</a>, and the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Star_Wars)" id="w">Galactic Empire</a>. The events causing the war and those leading to its conclusion are orchestrated by the Republic&#39;s chief executive, <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Chancellor" id="w">Supreme Chancellor</a> <a href="/wiki/Palpatine" id="w">Palpatine</a>.<sup id="_ref-Trilogy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Trilogy" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Origins" name="Origins"></a><h1> Origins </h1>
<p>The beginnings of the war are first portrayed in the 1999 film <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace" id="w">The Phantom Menace</a></i> (the first chapter but fourth release in the series) as the <a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_Theed" id="w">Invasion of Theed</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Naboo" id="w">Battle of Naboo</a>. However, the real tension begins with the Separatist Crisis, a series of debates in the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Republic" id="w">Galactic Republic</a> that are referred to in <i>Attack of the Clones</i>, and began about two years prior to the start of that film. By the beginning of <i>Attack of the Clones</i>, many <a href="/wiki/Solar_system" id="w">star systems</a> have <a href="/wiki/Secession" id="w">seceded</a> from the Republic. The tension caused by this secession eventually leads to the outbreak of war.<sup id="_ref-PalpatineRise_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PalpatineRise" title="">[3]</a></sup> The war has different causes: The Republic&#39;s Chancellor <a href="/wiki/Palpatine" id="w">Palpatine</a> tells his people that the war began because of several different reasons such as the years of separation by the outer rim territories, the separatists capture of the Jedi and the Separatists financing of rebellions by radical states within the Republic. While these are all true, Palpatine had covertly influenced all these events with the help of his secret apprentice, Count Dooku.</p>
<p>By the end of <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>, it is clear that the war was engineered by Palpatine to facilitate both his own rise to power and the formation of the Galactic Empire. He plays both sides against each other &#8212; as a Republic Senator (and later Chancellor), advocating the Republic to stop the threat of secession, and as the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious, by advising the <a href="/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems" id="w">Separatists</a>. The Clone Wars thus become the first of two major <a href="/wiki/Civil_war" id="w">civil wars</a> in the <i>Star Wars</i> galaxy, the other being the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Civil_War" id="w">Galactic Civil War</a> that makes up the main conflict of the second trilogy.</p>
<a id="Story" name="Story"></a><h1> Story </h1>
<p>The conflicts leading up to the Clone Wars begin 32 years before the events of <i>A New Hope</i> and during the second half of the film <i>The Phantom Menace</i>. The Trade Federation, a major galactic trade organization, blockades the small planet Naboo and demands the capitulation of the world by its queen, <a href="/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala" id="w">Padmé Amidala</a>, who refuses their demands and requests help from the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Republic_(Star_Wars)" id="w">Galactic Republic</a>, the main governing body of the galaxy. The Republic responds by sending two <a href="/wiki/Jedi" id="w">Jedi</a> ambassadors, Master <a href="/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn" id="w">Qui-Gon Jinn</a> and his apprentice <a href="/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi" id="w">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> to oversee the situation and negotiate with the Trade Federation. The Federation, wary of the Jedi and secretly taking orders from <a href="/wiki/Darth_Sidious" id="w">Darth Sidious</a>, attempt to murder the Jedi, who escape to Naboo just as the Federation begins a full-scale invasion. Following a brief occupation, the Trade Federation are defeated by an alliance of the Naboo military and the indigenous Gungan Tribes, with the help of the Jedi. <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Following these events, Jedi <a href="/wiki/Count_Dooku" id="w">Dooku</a> resigns his commission and returns to his homeworld of Serenno.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Unbeknownst to the <a href="/wiki/Jedi_Council" id="w">Jedi Council</a>, Dooku has fallen under the control of Sith master <a href="/wiki/Darth_Sidious" id="w">Darth Sidious</a>, who begins organizing a separatist coalition of planets and civilizations with the intention of seceding from the Republic. During this time, the Separatists begin forming their own armies, which primarily consist of battle droids constructed by the Trade Federation and their allies.</p>
<p>Following the attempted assassination of Senator Padmé Amidala, Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker&#39;s investigation puts them on the trail of <a href="/wiki/Jango_Fett" id="w">Jango Fett</a>, an intergalactic bounty hunter. Tracking him to the world of Kamino, Obi-Wan discovers that the Kaminoans have used samples of Fett&#39;s DNA to clone a vast army of soldiers, called <a href="/wiki/Clone_Trooper" id="w">Clone Troopers</a>. The order for the soldiers was submitted to the Kaminoans by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, later revealed to be an alias of Count Dooku. Meanwhile, the Republic soon faces internal opposition as several thousand worlds publicly secede from the Galactic Republic and form the <a href="/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems" id="w">Confederacy of Independent Systems</a>, or CIS. The Republic Senate proposes the Military Creation Act, allowing for the development of a large military to prevent further secession and civil war. Before the act can be voted upon, the Confederacy&#39;s military forces on <a href="/wiki/Geonosis" id="w">Geonosis</a> are discovered and the subsequent <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Geonosis" id="w">Battle of Geonosis</a> is waged, which essentially proves the necessity of such an army. <a href="/wiki/Palpatine" id="w">Chancellor Palpatine</a>, the then Head of State of the Republic, is quickly granted emergency powers by the Republic Senate, which he uses to raise the Grand Army of the Republic, a large military force made up of the Clone Troopers illicitly commissioned by Dooku and Sidious. The Battle of Geonosis marks the end of <i>Attack of the Clones</i> and the beginning of the Clone War.</p>
<p>During the in-universe time period between <i>Attack of the Clones</i> and <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>, conflict between the Republic and the Separatists increases and expands, which is chronicled in an extensive <a href="/wiki/#Multimedia campaign" id="w">Multimedia campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Three years after the Battle of Geonosis, the Confederacy <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Coruscant" id="w">attempts to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine</a> from the Republic capital world of <a href="/wiki/Coruscant" id="w">Coruscant</a>. The Chancellor is rescued and Confederacy leader Count Dooku killed, thanks to the efforts of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker.</p>
<p>At this point in the Clone Wars timeline, the Outer Rim Sieges are in full swing, as well as numerous other battles across the galaxy. The Jedi are considered battle commanders, far outranking clones in terms of battle prowess, and are spread thin across the galaxy. One of the key battles of the Outer Rim Sieges is the Battle of Utapau, depicted in <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>; during the battle, Obi-Wan strikes a crippling blow to the Confederacy by killing one of their most prominent leaders, <a href="/wiki/General_Grievous" id="w">General Grievous</a>.</p>
<p>Left behind by Obi-Wan on Coruscant, Anakin discovers that Palpatine is also Darth Sidious, Sith leader of the Confederacy. He informs <a href="/wiki/Mace_Windu" id="w">Mace Windu</a>, who promptly comes with a posse of Jedi Knights to detain the corrupt Chancellor. A furious duel ensues, until only Windu and Palpatine are left standing. Skywalker arrives at the Chancellor&#39;s quarters to find Palpatine at the mercy of Windu&#39;s lightsaber. Anakin, promised by Palpatine enough power to save his wife Padmé from death, slashes Windu&#39;s lightsaber hand off, allowing Palpatine to kill Windu. Palpatine/Sidious takes Anakin as his new Sith Apprentice, after losing Dooku, and gives him the Sith name <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" id="w">Darth Vader</a>. Anakin has now completely fallen under the sway of the Dark Side.</p>
<p>Utilizing the attack by Mace Windu and the Jedi as a pretext, Palpatine issues <a href="/wiki/Order_66" id="w">Order 66</a>, a pre-arranged military command ordering all Clone Troopers to execute their Jedi commanders. The newly-christened Darth Vader leads the <a href="/wiki/Operation:Knightfall" id="w">raid on the Jedi Temple</a> with the <a href="/wiki/501st_Legion_(Star_Wars)" id="w">501st Clone Trooper Legion</a> and kills all the Jedi in the Temple, including children Jedi living in the Temple. The handful of survivors of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Jedi_Purge" id="w">Great Jedi Purge</a> include Yoda and Obi-Wan. </p>
<p>With the extermination of the Jedi complete, Palpatine marks an end to the Republic, naming himself ruler of the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Star_Wars)" id="w">Galactic Empire</a>. During this time, Emperor Palpatine dispatches Vader to Mustafar to kill the rest of the Separatist leaders. With the elimination of the Confederacy leadership, Palpatine orders all battle droids to be shut down immediately, effectively ending the war.</p>

<p>Like all themes within <i>Star Wars</i>, the Clone Wars borrows from multiple mythical, literary, and historical influences and parallels. Writers and critics have debated over which parallels are most prominent or consistent.</p>
<a id="Political_and_military" name="Political_and_military"></a><h2> Political and military </h2>
<p>In the <i>Star Wars</i> timeline, both the Clone Wars and its results are portrayed as the process which shifted the Galactic Republic from a <a href="/wiki/Democracy" id="w">democracy</a> to a <a href="/wiki/Dictatorship" id="w">dictatorship</a>. In a 2002 <a href="/wiki/TIME_Magazine" id="w">TIME Magazine</a> interview, <i>Star Wars</i> creator <a href="/wiki/George_Lucas" id="w">George Lucas</a> explains:</p>
<dl><dd>&#34;All <a href="/wiki/Democracy" id="w">democracies</a> turn into <a href="/wiki/Dictatorship" id="w">dictatorships</a>&#8212;but not by coup.

Ultimately, the general population goes along with the idea. What kinds of things push people and institutions in this direction? That&#39;s the issue I&#39;ve been exploring: how did the Republic turn into the Empire? … How does a good person go bad, and how does a democracy become a dictatorship?&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>In <i>Attack of the Clones</i>, <a href="/wiki/Palpatine" id="w">Palpatine</a> orchestrates the Separatist movement (and the Clone Wars that followed) to worry the citizens of the Republic, thus forcing the Senate to grant him emergency powers. According to character <a href="/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi" id="w">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, these powers increase as the Clone Wars extend into a search for <a href="/wiki/General_Grevious" id="w">General Grevious</a>, who replaces <a href="/wiki/Count_Dooku" id="w">Count Dooku</a> as Separatist leader.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> During <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>, Palpatine declares himself Emperor by blaming the Jedi for the Republic&#39;s problems, resulting in a Jedi purge via <a href="/wiki/Order_66" id="w">Order 66</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Comparisons have been made between the political aspects of the Clone Wars and the events leading up to <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>. Radio host <a href="/wiki/Clyde_Lewis" id="w">Clyde Lewis</a>&#39; article on historical similarities in Star Wars claims that Palpatine&#39;s tactics parallel those of <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a> and Nazi Germany; both leaders used wars and <a href="/wiki/Scapegoat" id="w">scapegoats</a> to manipulate society&#39;s emotional state, thus providing the leadership with support and power.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> This viewpoint was also expressed in an editorial on the Clone Wars Unofficial Website.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Another writer compares the Clone Wars with <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> in general, basing his argument on the fact that Lucas was born during the <a href="/wiki/Baby_boomer" id="w">baby boomer</a> generation, and the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Civil_War" id="w">dark times</a> featured in the original trilogy rival the dark, uncertain <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" id="w">Cold War</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>  Lucas, however, cited in multiple interviews that one of his primary influences for the political backdrop behind the Clone Wars (and all of Star Wars) was the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" id="w">Vietnam</a>/<a href="/wiki/Watergate_scandal" id="w">Watergate</a> era, when leaders embraced corruption for what they thought was the best course of action.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>There is a variety of opinions on the historical parallels between the political aspects of the Clone Wars and the <a href="/wiki/War_in_Iraq" id="w">War in Iraq</a>. In claiming that the Star Wars galaxy under the deceitful Palpatine parallels the modern issues of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, an editorial on <a href="/wiki/Antiwar.com" id="w">Antiwar.com</a> states that &#34;[Star Wars] establishes first the generally agreeable premise that it&#39;s right to overthrow oppressive government, before bringing into focus something more discomforting – that the corrupt tyranny referred to is our own&#34;.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> Additionally, an article from Wiretap claims that &#34;like Palpatine, the <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">Bush</a> administration has been able to feed on people&#39;s fears to gain more power&#34;.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> However, in an interview with Kiro 7 News, <i>Star Wars</i> producer <a href="/wiki/Rick_McCallum" id="w">Rick McCallum</a> explained:</p>
<dl><dd>&#34;George is a product of Vietnam, not a product of Bush. [The political aspects of the Clone Wars] has been in the context of every script I&#39;ve ever read&#8212;every draft&#8212;way before Bush became president…&#34;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Lucas claims, however, that &#34;The parallels between what we did in Vietnam and what we&#39;re doing in Iraq now are unbelievable.&#34;  Nevertheless, he states that &#34;When I wrote [the backstory/Clone Wars], Iraq didn&#39;t exist&#34;.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Clone Wars parallel the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a> in many respects. The Confederacy of Independent Systems shares a similar name to the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" id="w">Confederate States of America</a>; it also seceded from the Republic, much like the south seceded from the Union. Like Confederate General <a href="/wiki/Robert_E._Lee" id="w">Robert E. Lee</a>, Count Dooku was respected by his enemies, and had he survived, he most likely would have been accepted by them.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> (It must be remembered, however, that few knew Dooku was secretly workng for the Sith and Palpatine.
