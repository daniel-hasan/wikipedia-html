<p><b>Sai Ying Pun</b> is a proposed <a href="/wiki/List_of_Hong_Kong_MTR_stations" id="w">station</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a> <a href="/wiki/MTR" id="w">MTR</a> {{HK-MTR lines}} serving the neighbourhood of <a href="/wiki/Sai_Ying_Pun" id="w">Sai Ying Pun</a> in northwestern <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong_Island" id="w">Hong Kong Island</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a>.</p>
<p>Under the latest proposal as of June <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, Sai Ying Pun will serve as a station on the proposed extension of the Island line known as <a href="/wiki/West_Island_Line_(MTR)" id="w">West Island Line</a>, as opposed to a transfer station to another line serving the <a href="/wiki/Southern_District%2C_Hong_Kong" id="w">Southern District</a> with the same name as in previous plans.</p>
<p>The station appeared in <i>Hong Kong Mass Transit: Further Studies</i> in <a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>. It was to be built as part of the Island Line in the <a href="/wiki/1980" id="w">1980s</a>, but construction of the line did not commence westwards beyond <a href="/wiki/Sheung_Wan_(MTR)" id="w">Sheung Wan</a>, citing inadequate passengers and technical difficulties by contractors.</p>
<a id="Proposed_locations" name="Proposed_locations"></a><h2>Proposed locations</h2>
<p>In <a class="externallink" href="http://www.ozp.tpb.gov.hk/pdf/S_H3_20_e.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.ozp.tpb.gov.hk/pdf/S_H3_20_e.pdf">Outline Zoning Plan No. S/H3/20</a>, the Planning Department of the government has indicated one possible location under <a href="/wiki/Des_Voeux_Road" id="w">Des Voeux Road</a> West at <a href="/wiki/Ko_Shing_Street" id="w">Ko Shing Street</a> as of December <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>. A ventilation shaft marked with MTR notices can be found at the intersection. A large void facing Des Voeux Road West, sealed, can also be found at a nearby medical centre, which some have speculated that it was reserved for a to-be-built exit. These findings suggest that this was the original proposed location.</p>
<p>However, in <a class="externallink" href="http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/extensions/WIL&#38;SIL_Summary.pdf#page=2" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/extensions/WIL&#38;SIL_Summary.pdf#page=2">proposals submitted to the government</a> by the MTR in May <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, the proposed station was shifted further west to the intersection of Des Voeux Road West and <a href="/wiki/Water_Street%2C_Hong_Kong" id="w">Water Street</a>.</p>
<p>In March <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, the MTR moved the station back east but south of the initial alignment under <a href="/wiki/King_George_V_Memorial_Park%2C_Hong_Kong" id="w">King George V Memorial Park</a>. Source from <a href="/wiki/MTR_Corporation_Limited" id="w">MTR Corporation Limited</a> (MTRCL) revealed to the local newspaper <a href="/wiki/Ming_Pao" id="w">Ming Pao</a> that this location was chosen to avoid any nuisance during works under major roads. The location would also better suit the needs of <a href="/wiki/Mid-Levels" id="w">Mid-Levels</a> residents, the source said.</p>
