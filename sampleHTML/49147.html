<b>Fair trade</b> is an organized <a href="/wiki/Social_movement" id="w">social movement</a> and market-based model of <a href="/wiki/International_trade" id="w">international trade</a> which promotes the payment of a fair price as well as social and environmental standards in areas related to the production of a wide variety of <a href="/wiki/Goods" id="w">goods</a>. The movement focuses in particular on exports from developing countries to developed countries, most notably <a href="/wiki/Handicrafts" id="w">handicrafts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coffee" id="w">coffee</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cocoa" id="w">cocoa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sugar" id="w">sugar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tea" id="w">tea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bananas" id="w">bananas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Honey" id="w">honey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cotton" id="w">cotton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wine" id="w">wine</a>, fresh fruit, and so on. </p>
<p>Fair trade&#39;s strategic intent is to deliberately work with marginalised producers and workers in order to help them move from a position of vulnerability to security and economic self-sufficiency. It also aims at empowering them to become stakeholders in their own organizations and actively play a wider role in the global arena to achieve greater equity in <a href="/wiki/International_trade" id="w">international trade</a>.</p>
<p>Fair trade proponents include a wide array of international religious, development aid, social and environmental organizations such as <a href="/wiki/Oxfam" id="w">Oxfam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Amnesty_International" id="w">Amnesty International</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Caritas_(charity)" id="w">Caritas International</a>.</p>
<p>Like most <a href="/wiki/International_development" id="w">developmental efforts</a>, fair trade has proven itself controversial and has drawn criticism from both ends of the <a href="/wiki/Political_spectrum" id="w">political spectrum</a>.  Some economists and conservative <a href="/wiki/Think_tanks" id="w">think tanks</a> see fair trade as a type of <a href="/wiki/Subsidy" id="w">subsidy</a> that impedes growth.  Segments of the <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" id="w">left</a> criticize fair trade for not adequately challenging the current trading system.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_certification" id="w">Fairtrade certified</a> sales amounted to approximately $2.3 billion worldwide, a 41% year-to-year increase.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> While this represents less than one hundredth of a percentage point of world trade in physical merchandise,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> fair trade products generally account for 0.5-5% of all sales in their product categories in Europe and North America.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> In October 2006, over 1.5 million disadvantaged producers worldwide were directly benefiting from fair trade while an additional 5 million benefited from fair trade funded infrastructure and community development projects.<sup id="_ref-FLOFAQs_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FLOFAQs" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Most fair trade import organizations are members or certified by one or several national or international federations. These federations coordinate, promote and facilitate the work of fair trade organizations. The following are the largest and most influential:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_Labelling_Organizations_International" id="w">Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International</a> (FLO), created in <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>, is an association of 3 producer networks and 20 national labelling initiatives that promote and market the Fairtrade Certification Mark in their countries. The FLO labelling system is the largest and most widely recognized standard setting and certification body for <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_labelling" id="w">labelled Fairtrade</a>. It regularly inspects and certifies producer organizations in more than 50 countries in <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Asia" id="w">Asia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" id="w">Latin America</a>, encompassing approximately one million families of farmers and workers.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/International_Fair_Trade_Association" id="w">International Fair Trade Association</a> (IFTA) is a global association created in 1989 of fairtrade producer cooperatives and associations, export marketing companies, importers, retailers, national and regional fair trade networks and fair trade support organizations. In <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a> IFAT launched the FTO Mark which identifies registered Fair Trade Organizations (as opposed to the <a href="/wiki/FLO" id="w">FLO</a> system, which labels products). <a href="/wiki/International_Fair_Trade_Association" id="w">IFAT</a> has nearly 300 member organizations in over 60 countries.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Network_of_European_Worldshops" id="w">Network of European Worldshops</a> (NEWS), created in <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>, is the umbrella network of 15 national <a href="/wiki/Worldshop" id="w">Worldshop</a> associations in 13 different countries all over <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/European_Fair_Trade_Association" id="w">European Fair Trade Association</a> (EFTA), created in <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a>, is a network of European fair trade organisations which import products from some 400 economically disadvantaged producer groups in Africa, Asia and Latin America. EFTA&#39;s goal is to promote fair trade and to make fair trade importing more efficient and effective. The organization also published yearly various publications on the evolution of the fair trade market. EFTA currently has eleven members in nine different countries.</li></ul>
<p>In 1998, these four federations created together <a href="/wiki/FINE" id="w">FINE</a>, an informal association whose goal is to harmonize fair trade standards and guidelines, increase the quality and efficiency of fair trade monitoring systems and advocate fair trade politically.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Fair_Trade_Federation" id="w">Fair Trade Federation</a> (FTF) is an association of Canadian and American fair trade wholesalers, importers and retailers. The organization links its members to fair trade producer groups while acting as a clearinghouse for information on fair trade and providing resources and networking opportunities to its members.</li></ul>
<p>Student groups have also been increasingly active in the past years promoting fair trade products both on their campuses and their communities. Although hundreds of independent student organizations are active worldwide, most groups in North America are either affiliated with <a class="externallink" href="http://www.usft.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.usft.org/">United Students for Fair Trade</a> (USA) or the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.csftn-recce.org/english/index.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.csftn-recce.org/english/index.html">Canadian Student Fair Trade Network</a> (Canada).</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Fair Trade goods sold in Worldshops</div> current fair trade movement was shaped in Europe in the <a href="/wiki/1960s" id="w">1960s</a>. Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against neo-imperialism: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The slogan at the time, “Trade not Aid”, gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the <a href="/wiki/UNCTAD" id="w">UNCTAD</a> (<a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Trade_and_Development" id="w">United Nations Conference on Trade and Development</a>) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the developing world.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The year <a href="/wiki/1965" id="w">1965</a> saw the creation of the first <a href="/wiki/Alternative_Trading_Organization" id="w">Alternative Trading Organization</a> (ATO): that year, <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/NGO" id="w">NGO</a> <a href="/wiki/Oxfam" id="w">Oxfam</a> launched &#34;Helping-by-Selling&#34;, a program which sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a> and from mail-order catalogues.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1969" id="w">1969</a>, the first <a href="/wiki/Worldshop" id="w">Worldshop</a> opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods produced under fair trade terms in “underdeveloped regions”. The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the <a href="/wiki/Benelux" id="w">Benelux</a> countries, <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> and in other Western European countries.</p>
<p>Throughout the <a href="/wiki/1960s" id="w">1960s</a> and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from <a href="/wiki/Angola" id="w">Angola</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nicaragua" id="w">Nicaragua</a> in Worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world’s market, and you support their self-determined sustainable development. The alternative trade movement blossomed, if not in sales, then at least in terms of dozens of <a href="/wiki/Alternative_Trading_Organization" id="w">ATOs</a> being established on both sides of the Atlantic, of scores of Worldshops being set up, and of well-organized actions and campaigns attacking exploitation and foreign domination, and promoting the ideals of <a href="/wiki/Nelson_Mandela" id="w">Nelson Mandela</a>, <a href="/wiki/Julius_Nyerere" id="w">Julius Nyerere</a> and the Nicaraguan <a href="/wiki/Sandinistas" id="w">Sandinistas</a>: the right to independence and self-determination, to equitable access to the world’s markets and consumers.</p>
<a id="Handcrafts_vs._agricultural_goods" name="Handcrafts_vs._agricultural_goods"></a><h2>Handcrafts vs. agricultural goods</h2>

<p>In the early 1980s, Alternative Trading Organizations faced a major challenge: the novelty of some fair trade products started wearing off, demand reached a plateau and some handicrafts began to look “tired and old fashioned” in the marketplace.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, fair trade supporters during this period became increasingly worried by the impact of the fall of agricultural <a href="/wiki/Commodity" id="w">commodity</a> prices on poor producers. Many then believed it was the movement&#39;s responsibility to address the issue and to find innovative remedies to react to the ongoing crisis in the industry.</p>
<p>In the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many <a href="/wiki/Alternative_Trading_Organizations" id="w">ATOs</a>: successful on the market, they offered a much-needed, renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations a perfect complement to the handicrafts market. The first fair trade agricultural products were <a href="/wiki/Tea" id="w">tea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coffee" id="w">coffee</a>, quickly followed by dried <a href="/wiki/Fruits" id="w">fruits</a>, cocoa, sugar, <a href="/wiki/Fruit_juices" id="w">fruit juices</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rice" id="w">rice</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spices" id="w">spices</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nut_(fruit)" id="w">nuts</a>. While in 1992, a sales value ratio of 80 % handcrafts to 20 % agricultural goods was the norm, in 2002 handcrafts amounted to 25.4 % of fair trade sales while commodity food lines were up at 69.4 %.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks</div> of fair trade products however only really took off with the arrival of the first <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_labelling" id="w">Fairtrade labelling</a> initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small Worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a>. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.</p>
<p>A solution was found in <a href="/wiki/1988" id="w">1988</a>, when the first <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_certification" id="w">Fairtrade labelling</a> initiative, <a href="/wiki/Stichting_Max_Havelaar" id="w">Stichting Max Havelaar</a>, was created under the initiative of <a href="/wiki/Nico_Roozen" id="w">Nico Roozen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Frans_Van_Der_Hoff" id="w">Frans Van Der Hoff</a> and Dutch development NGO <a href="/wiki/Solidaridad" id="w">Solidaridad</a>. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the Worldshops and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_labelling" id="w">labeling initiative</a> also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the <a href="/wiki/Supply_chain" id="w">supply chain</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The concept caught on: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America. In <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>, a process of convergence among labelling organizations – or “LIs” (for “Labelling Initiatives”) – led to the creation of <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_Labelling_Organizations_International" id="w">Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International</a>. <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_Labelling_Organizations_International" id="w">FLO</a> is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_Labelling_Organizations_International" id="w">FLO</a> launched for the first time an <a href="/wiki/International_Fairtrade_Certification_Mark" id="w">International Fairtrade Certification Mark</a>. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade and simplify procedures for both producers and importers. At present, the certification mark is used in over 50 countries and on dozens of different products, based on FLO’s certification for coffee, tea, rice, <a href="/wiki/Banana" id="w">bananas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mangoes" id="w">mangoes</a>, cocoa, cotton, sugar, <a href="/wiki/Honey" id="w">honey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fruit_juices" id="w">fruit juices</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nut_(fruit)" id="w">nuts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fruit" id="w">fresh fruit</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quinoa" id="w">quinoa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Herbs" id="w">herbs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spices" id="w">spices</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wine" id="w">wine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Football_(ball)" id="w">footballs </a> etc.</p>

<p><i>Note: Customary spelling of Fairtrade is one word when referring to the FLO product labelling system</i></p>
<p>Fairtrade labelling (usually simply Fairtrade or <a href="/wiki/Fair_Trade_Certified_Mark" id="w">Fair Trade Certified</a> in the <a href="/wiki/US" id="w">US</a>) is a certification system designed to allow consumers to identify goods which meet agreed standards. Overseen by a standard-setting body (<a href="/wiki/FLO_International" id="w">FLO International</a>) and a certification body (<a href="/wiki/FLO-CERT" id="w">FLO-CERT</a>), the system involves independent auditing of producers and traders to ensure the agreed standards are met.</p>
<p>For a product to carry either the <a href="/wiki/International_Fairtrade_Certification_Mark" id="w">International Fairtrade Certification Mark</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Fair_Trade_Certified_Mark" id="w">Fair Trade Certified Mark</a>, it must come from <a href="/wiki/FLO-CERT" id="w">FLO-CERT</a> inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the international Fairtrade standards set by <a href="/wiki/FLO_International" id="w">FLO International</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Supply_chain" id="w">supply chain</a> must also have been monitored by <a href="/wiki/FLO-CERT" id="w">FLO-CERT</a>, to ensure the integrity of labelled products.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_certification" id="w">Fairtrade certification</a> guarantees not only fair prices, but also the principles of <a href="/wiki/Ethical_purchasing" id="w">ethical purchasing</a>. These principles include adherence to <a href="/wiki/International_Labour_Organization" id="w">ILO</a> agreements such as those banning child and <a href="/wiki/Slave_labour" id="w">slave labour</a>, guaranteeing a safe workplace and the right to <a href="/wiki/Unionization" id="w">unionise</a>, adherence to the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a> charter of <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" id="w">human rights</a>, a fair price that covers the cost of production and facilitates social development, and protection and conservation of the environment. The Fairtrade certification system also promotes long-term business relationships between buyers and sellers, crop prefinancing and greater transparency throughout the supply chain.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_certification" id="w">Fairtrade certification</a> system covers a growing range of products, including <a href="/wiki/Banana" id="w">bananas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Honey" id="w">honey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coffee" id="w">coffee</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oranges" id="w">oranges</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cocoa" id="w">cocoa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cotton" id="w">cotton</a>, dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, <a href="/wiki/Quinoa" id="w">quinoa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rice" id="w">rice</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spices" id="w">spices</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sugar" id="w">sugar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tea" id="w">tea</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wine" id="w">wine</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/International_Fairtrade_Certification_Mark" id="w">International Fairtrade Certification Mark</a> was launched in <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a> by <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_Labelling_Organizations_International" id="w">FLO</a>, and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives. The new Certification Mark is currently used worldwide (with the exception of Canada and the United States).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Fair_Trade_Certified_Mark" id="w">Fair Trade Certified Mark</a>, used in Canada and in the United States, also still identifies Fairtrade goods in both countries.

<a id="Fair_trade_impact_studies" name="Fair_trade_impact_studies"></a><h1>Fair trade impact studies</h1>
<p>Several independent studies have recently measured the impact of fair trade on disadvantaged farmers and workers.</p>
<p>In 2002, Loraine Ronchi of the Poverty Research Unit at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Sussex" id="w">University of Sussex</a> studied the impact of fair trade on the Coocafe cooperative in <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica" id="w">Costa Rica</a>. Ronchi found that fair trade strengthened producer organizations and concluded that &#34;in light of the coffee crisis of the early <a href="/wiki/1990s" id="w">1990s</a>, fair trade can be said to have accomplished its goal of improving the returns to small producers and positively affecting their quality of life and the health of the organisations that represent them locally, nationally and beyond&#34;.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2003, the Fair Trade Research Group at <a href="/wiki/Colorado_State_University" id="w">Colorado State University</a> conducted seven case studies of Latin American Fairtrade coffee producers (UCIRI, CEPCO, Majomut, Las Colinas &#38; El Sincuyo
La Selva, Tzotzilotic and La Voz) and concluded that Fair Trade has &#34;in a short time greatly improved the well-being of small-scale coffee farmers and their families&#34;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> The various case studies  most notably found that producers had under Fair Trade greater access to credit and external development funding.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The studies also found that Fair Trade producers had, compared to conventional coffee producers, greater access to training and enhanced ability to improve the quality of their coffee.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>. Families of Fair Trade producers were also said to be more stable and children had better access to education than in families growing conventional coffee.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>A case study of Bolivian coffee Fair Trade producers published by Nicolas Eberhart for French NGO <a href="/wiki/Agronomes_et_V%C3%A9t%C3%A9rinaires_sans_fronti%C3%A8res" id="w">Agronomes et Vétérinaires sans frontières</a> in 2005 concluded that Fair Trade certification has had in the <a href="/wiki/Yungas" id="w">Yungas</a> a positive impact on local coffee prices, thus economically benefiting all coffee producers (Fairtrade certified or not). Fair Trade was also said to have strengthened producer organizations and increased their political influence.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>A comparative case study conducted with small-scale coffee farmer cooperatives selling into both conventional and certified organic / Fair Trade markets in northern Nicaragua demonstrated that sales to Fair Trade can reduce small-scale farmers&#39; livelihood vulnerability when coffee commodity prices were low (Bacon, 2005).  Changing governance structures, corporate concentration, oversupply, interchangeable commodity grade beans, and low farm gate prices characterized the crisis in conventional coffee markets. In contrast, certified Fair Trade and organic are two types of specialty coffee trade and production that are potentially useful for wider sustainable community development processes.  A participatory action research team surveyed 228 farmers to measure the impact of sales to organic and Fair Trade markets. The results suggest that participation in organic and Fair Trade networks reduces farmers’ livelihood vulnerability and can contribute to bottom-up empowerment processes.  However, significant challenges remain in efforts to increase positive impacts and maintain fair trade&#39;s core values as Fair Trade enters the mainstream. <sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>An econometric analysis conducted by Becchetti and Costantino (2006) verified the impact of Fair Trade affiliation on monetary and non monetary measures of well-being on a sample of <a href="/wiki/Kenya" id="w">Kenyan</a> farmers. The researchers compared a <a href="/wiki/Experimental_control" id="w">control sample group</a> of farmers to <a href="/wiki/Fairtrade_certification" id="w">Fair trade certified</a> groups and Meru herbs farmers. Becchetti and Costantino documented the following: during the same period, Fair trade farmers were more successful in diversifying their production, experienced a significant drop in child mortality, improvements in terms of monthly household food consumption, greater satisfaction in terms of prices obtained for their crop, living conditions etc. Methodological problems such as the relative contribution of Fair Trade and Meru herbs farmers, control sample bias, Fair trade and Meru Herb selection biases are discussed and addressed showing that ex ante selection of Meru members contributes to explain some but not all the results of the study.

<p>A sociological research published by Virginie Diaz Pedregal (2006) analyzes practices of exchange and the effects of « fair division » in coffee organizations using fair trade in the Andean context (Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia). The study deals with the way beneficiaries perceive fair trade, and its importance within the communities. Positive and negative effects of fair trade are discussed. <sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Michigan_State_University" id="w">Michigan State University</a> assistant professor <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Jaffee" id="w">Daniel Jaffee</a> conducted a four year study of the impact of fair trade on Michiza cooperative coffee producers, in <a href="/wiki/Oaxaca" id="w">Oaxaca</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a>. Jaffee&#39;s findings, published in the 2007 book &#34;Brewing Justice: Fair Trade Coffee, Sustainability, and Survival&#34;, provide a nuanced view of fair trade: &#34;Fair trade&#39;s higher prices increase gross household income - although, because most fair trade coffee is also certified organic, producers have higher costs of production as well. Participation in fair trade reduces households&#39; debt and enhances their economic options, affording them the possibility of better feeding and educating their children. Fair trade affords peasant farmers partial protection from some of the worst aspects of commodity crises and in many cases allows them the breathing room needed to engage in more sustainable agricultural practices. Furthermore, the extra capital from fair trade can generate important economic ripple effects within communities, providing additional employment even for nonparticipating families. However, fair trade is not a panacea, and it does not bring the majority of participants out of poverty. (...)  Demand for fair trade products must increase dramatically in order to augment the economic benefits for such small farmer families and allow the system to include many more producers of coffee and other commodities around the world.&#34;<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

Similar to other <a href="/wiki/Farm_subsidies" id="w">farm subsidies</a>, fair trade attempts to set a <a href="/wiki/Price_floor" id="w">price floor</a> for a good that is in many cases above the <a href="/wiki/Market_price" id="w">market price</a> and therefore encourages existing producers to <a href="/wiki/Produce" id="w">produce</a> more and new producers to enter the market, leading to excess supply. Through the laws of <a href="/wiki/Supply_and_demand" id="w">supply and demand</a>, excess supply can lead to lower prices in the non-Fair Trade market.</p>
<p>According to Alex Singleton of the <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith_Institute" id="w">Adam Smith Institute</a>, while fair trade is based on &#34;the best of intentions,&#34; it might in fact &#34;make things worse.&#34;<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup>  Singleton&#39;s comments echo the main criticisms of Fair Trade, that &#34;it also leads fair trade producers to increase production.&#34; While benefiting a number of Fair Trade producers over the short run, fair trade critics worry about the impact on long run development and economic growth. The reason coffee prices are so low on the world markets is that there is too much production.<sup id="_ref-economist_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-economist" title="">[41]</a></sup> By encouraging even more supply of coffee, fair trade makes the world price fall further.<sup id="_ref-economist_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-economist" title="">[41]</a></sup> This makes the vast majority of coffee producers worse off. In 2003, <a href="/wiki/Cato_Institute" id="w">Cato Institute</a>&#39;s vice president for research <a href="/wiki/Brink_Lindsey" id="w">Brink Lindsey</a> referred to fair trade as a “well intentioned, <a href="/wiki/Economic_interventionism" id="w">interventionist</a> scheme...doomed to end in failure.&#34; Fair trade, according to Lindsey, is a misguided attempt to make up for <a href="/wiki/Market_failures" id="w">market failures</a> in which one flawed pricing structure is replaced with another.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>Several academics, including Hayes<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup>, Becchetti and Rosati<sup id="_ref-Becchetti_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Becchetti" title="">[48]</a></sup>, identify two counterarguments to this reasoning. </p>

<ol>
<li>First, in many cases the exchange between producers and intermediaries does not occur in a competitive framework.<sup id="_ref-Becchetti_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Becchetti" title="">[48]</a></sup> In such case the market price is a distortion because it does not reflect the productivity of producers but their lower market power.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup>  </li>
<li>Second, the food industry produces highly differentiated products with a continuous wave of innovations that create new varieties. There is not one single coffee but instead many different coffee products that are differentiated from one another in terms of quality, blends, packaging, and now also &#34;social responsibility&#34; features. For each of these products there exists a specific and different market price that is determined by consumer taste for that kind of product (which for fair trade coffees does not seem to be weak or declining).<sup id="_ref-Becchetti_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Becchetti" title="">[48]</a></sup> In this sense, fair trade is an innovation in the food industry that creates a new range of products.<sup id="_ref-Becchetti_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Becchetti" title="">[48]</a></sup> </li></ol>
<p>Beyond these elements, it is important to also take into account all the potential benefits of the fair trade value chain in terms of provision of local public goods, technical assistance that strengthens producers&#39; market capabilities, democratization of markets through increasing consumer power, etc.<sup id="_ref-Becchetti_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Becchetti" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fair trade organizations such as <a href="/wiki/FLO_International" id="w">FLO International</a> also respond to the oversupply argument by claiming that fair trade is very much a market-responsive model of trade: the farmers receive the Fairtrade minimum prices and premiums only if they have a buyer willing to pay them, and many producer groups also sell in the conventional market. According to Luuk Zonneveld, Managing Director at FLO International, &#34;our experience is that producers use their additional income from Fairtrade to improve their homes, send their children to school and improve the quality of their existing crop, rather than to increase production.&#34;<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Fair trade organizations have also long encouraged producers to invest in diversification and specialty crop development programs. Examples include coffee growers developing citrus or <a href="/wiki/Macadamia_nut" id="w">macadamia nuts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Banana" id="w">banana</a> farmers moving into other premium tropical produce, or investment in alternative income-generation projects such as eco-tourism, or in community health and education programs.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Mainstreaming_argument" name="Mainstreaming_argument"></a><h2>Mainstreaming argument</h2>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, some believe a large part of the fair trade system is not radical enough. <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> author <a href="/wiki/Christian_Jacquiau" id="w">Christian Jacquiau</a>, in his book <i>Les coulisses du commerce équitable</i>, calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes a segment of the fair trade movement, especially the French labelling organization <a href="/wiki/Association_Max_Havelaar_France" id="w">Max Havelaar France</a>, for working within the current system (i.e. partnerships with mass retailers, <a href="/wiki/Multinational_corporation" id="w">multinational corporations</a> etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous trading system. Jacquiau is also a staunch supporter of significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the impact, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair trade terms. He defends in his book a minority of fair trade networks (such as <i>Minga</i> or <i>Artisans du monde</i> in France) that he believes have higher ethical value<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup>.</p>
