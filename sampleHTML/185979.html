<p>The University maintains seven libraries on its campuses (six of which are in Morgantown and the other in Charleston). These include the Downtown Campus Library, Evansdale Library, Health Sciences Library, Law Library, Math Library, Media Services, and the WVU Charleston Health Sciences Library. Collections include the Appalachian Collection, Book Depository, Digital Collections, Government Documents, West Virginia Historical Art Collection, Map Room, Myers Collection, Patent and Trademarks, Rare Books Collections, and Theses and Dissertations. West Virginia University libraries contain nearly 1.5 million printed volumes, 2.3 million microforms, more than 10,000 electronic journals, and computers with high speed Internet access.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia_and_Regional_History_Collection" id="w">West Virginia and Regional History Collection</a>, the world&#39;s largest collection of West Virginia related research material, is in the Wise Library on the Downtown Campus. According to the university<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>, the collection includes over 4,500,000 <a href="/wiki/Manuscript" id="w">manuscript</a> documents, 30,000 books, 15,000 pamphlets, 1,200 <a href="/wiki/Newspapers" id="w">newspapers</a>, 100,000 <a href="/wiki/Photographs" id="w">photographs</a> and prints, 5,000 maps, and 25,000 <a href="/wiki/Microfilm" id="w">microfilms</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oral_histories" id="w">oral histories</a>, films and <a href="/wiki/Folk_music" id="w">folk music</a> recordings. It is often called simply the &#34;West Virginia Collection.&#34; </p>
<p>In 2007, the Princeton Review ranked West Virginia University libraries 5th best of 366 college libraries surveyed.</p>
<p>The university co-publishes, with the <a href="/wiki/United_Association_for_Labor_Education" id="w">United Association for Labor Education</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Labor_Studies_Journal" id="w">Labor Studies Journal</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Campus" name="Campus"></a><h1>Campus</h1>
<p>The Morgantown campus comprises three sub-campuses. The original main campus, typically called the Downtown Campus, is in the Monongahela River valley on the fringes of Morgantown. The Evansdale Campus, a mile and a half north/northwest, on a rise above the flood plain of the <a href="/wiki/Monongahela_River" id="w">Monongahela River</a>, was developed in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate a growing student population, since space for expansion is limited at the Downtown Campus. The Health Sciences Campus, in the same outlying area (but on the other side of a ridge), includes the WVU Health Sciences Center, Ruby Memorial Hospital, Chestnut Ridge Hospital, Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, UHA Physicians Office Center, Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute and, WVU Eye Institute, WVU Center on Aging, and WVU Children&#39;s Hospital.</p>
<p>The Health Sciences Campus is near Milan Puskar Stadium formerly Mountaineer Field.</p>
<a id="PRT_system/campus_transportation" name="PRT_system/campus_transportation"></a><h1> PRT system/campus transportation</h1>
<p>{{main}}
Because of WVU&#39;s distributed campuses (Downtown, Evansdale, and Health Sciences), the <a href="/wiki/Morgantown_Personal_Rapid_Transit" id="w">Personal Rapid Transit</a> system, which has become a local showpiece, was built to link them. <a href="/wiki/Boeing" id="w">Boeing</a> began construction on the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system in <a href="/wiki/Morgantown%2C_West_Virginia" id="w">Morgantown, West Virginia</a> in 1974. The unique aspect that makes the system &#34;personal&#34; is that a rider can tell the system which station is the destination and then he/she will be directed to a car that is bound only for that station.</p>
<p>The WVU PRT began operation in 1975, with U.S. President <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon" id="w">Richard Nixon</a>&#39;s daughter, Tricia, aboard one of five prototype cars for a demonstration ride.<sup id="_ref-prt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-prt" title="">[9]</a></sup>. The PRT handles 16,000 riders per day (as of 2005) and uses approximately 70 cars. [There was an interruption in service during the 1978/1979 school year to allow system expansion from the Engineering station to new stations at the &#34;Towers&#34; dormitories and the WVU Medical Center. During this time, WVU provided bus service between campuses.] </p>
<p>The system has 8.7 miles (approx. 14 km) of guideway track and five stations: Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical/Health Sciences. The vehicles are rubber-tired, but the cars have constant contact with a separate electrified rail. <a href="/wiki/Steam" id="w">Steam</a> heating keeps the elevated guideway free of snow and ice. To board the PRT, a rider can pay a nominal fare at the station or swipe his/her Mountaineer Card, which also functions as a school debit card, library card, and unlimited transit pass. Although most students use the PRT, this technology has not been replicated at other sites for various reasons, including the high cost of maintaining the heated track system in winter.{{Fact}}  </p>
<p>The PRT cars are painted in the school colors (blue with gold trim) and feature the University name and logo on the front. Inside, the seats are light beige <a href="/wiki/Fiberglass" id="w">fiberglass</a> and the carpeting is blue. Each car has eight seats with an overall capacity of 20 people, including standing room. </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/National_Society_of_Professional_Engineers" id="w">National Society of Professional Engineers</a> named the WVU PRT one of the top 10 engineering achievements of 1972,<sup id="_ref-prt_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-prt" title="">[9]</a></sup> and in 1998 <i>The New Electric Railway Journal</i> picked the WVU PRT over <a href="/wiki/PeopleMover" id="w">Walt Disney World&#39;s monorail</a> as the greatest people mover in the United States.<sup id="_ref-prt_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-prt" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2006, the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Transportation" id="w">U.S. Department of Transportation</a> and <a href="/wiki/U.S._Environmental_Protection_Agency" id="w">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> dubbed WVU one of the best workplaces for commuters.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the PRT systm, students can utilize University-operated buses (during limited hours) or take advantage of the community&#39;s Mountain Line, which operates every day into the early morning hours. Students can use their Mountaineer Card to ride the Mountain Line bus for free. </p>
<p>The Health Science Center also operates a shuttle service to help students, visitors and patients to get to and from the Health Science Center campus. Many non-University, private student housing communities in the area also operate a shuttle to campus/town and back to the housing community. </p>
<p>Each autumn, during Mountaineer Week celebrations, a special PRT car is placed in front of the <a href="/wiki/MountainLair" id="w">MountainLair</a> <a href="/wiki/Student_activity_center" id="w">student union</a> where groups of students participate in the &#34;PRT Cram&#34; with the objective of squeezing in as many people as possible.

The Residential Education Program (ResEd), enacted in 1995, promotes &#34;student success by easing the transition from high school to college and to personalize the freshman experience.&#34;<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>  During the Move-In or Welcome Weekend, returning upperclassmen volunteer to help the new students and are known as Residential Education HOTSHOTS.

<p>ResEd and the WVU First-Year Experience (FYE) focus on the university&#39;s 14 <a href="/wiki/Residence_halls" id="w">residence halls</a>. Each hall is assigned a resident faculty leader (RFL, pronounced &#34;riffle&#34;) who oversees programming and lives in a house, usually next to the hall, where students hold Hall Council meetings and other events. Each hall is also assigned a residence hall coordinator (RHC) who works with the RFL and is responsible for daily operations, including enforcement of hall regulations. Along with these two positions are resident assistants (RAs) in most halls, graduate assistants (GAs)in some halls, and resident tutors (RTs) in Lincoln Hall. All three groups comprise students who have lived in the residence halls for at least one year and are responsible for the daily operations of one floor or area. In addition to this 24-hour staff, WVU Police Department officers are stationed in or nearby the halls at certain hours to deter any criminal activity and to provide necessary resources and assitance to the students and staff.</p>
<p>All residence halls offer peer tutors or other tutoring programs to assist students having academic difficulties.</p>

<p>The Mountaineer was adopted in 1890 as the official school mascot and a new Mountaineer is selected each year during Mountaineer Week. Candidates must have at least a 2.5 GPA, write an essay about why they want to be the Mountaineer, and garner the most cheers during a designated home basketball game. The successful candidate is awarded the formal title of &#34;The Mountaineer of West Virginia University.&#34; Although men typically are chosen, there has been at least one woman selected (Natalie Tennant). The new Mountaineer receives a scholarship, a tailor-made buckskin suit with coonskin hat, and a period rifle and powder horn for discharging when the football team scores.

The band plays several university songs and favorites including: &#34;Fight, Mountaineers,&#34; &#34;Mountain Dew,&#34; &#34;Simple Gifts&#34; (from <i><a href="/wiki/Appalachian_Spring" id="w">Appalachian Spring</a></i>), &#34;West Virginia University&#39;s Alma Mater,&#34; &#34;The Star Spangled Banner,&#34; &#34;Country Roads,&#34; and &#34;Hail West Virginia!&#34; The band also forms several iconic images during its pre-game show including the <a href="/wiki/#Flying WV" id="w">Flying WV</a>, WVU, expanding circles, and an outline of the state of <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia" id="w">West Virginia</a>. Each season&#39;s pre-game show is unique. </p>
<p>WVU&#39;s marching band is one of the few to include a male baton twirler.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1997, the WVU band was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Sudler_Trophy" id="w">Sudler Trophy</a> by the <a href="/wiki/John_Philip_Sousa_Foundation" id="w">John Philip Sousa Foundation</a>.</p>
<a id="Fight_song" name="Fight_song"></a><h2>Fight song</h2>
<p>&#34;Hail, West Virginia&#34; is the university fight song.  It was composed by WVU alumni Earl Miller and Ed McWhorter in 1915.  The lyrics were written by Fred B. Deem, who later became a lawyer in <a href="/wiki/Clarksburg%2C_West_Virginia" id="w">Clarksburg, West Virginia</a>. The Mountaineer Marching Band performs the second verse of &#34;Hail, West Virginia&#34; as part of its pre-game performance at <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia_Mountaineers" id="w">Mountaineer</a> football games.</p>
<a id="Carpet_roll" name="Carpet_roll"></a><h2>Carpet roll</h2>

<p>In 1955, Fred Schaus and Alex Mumford devised the idea of rolling out an elaborate gold and blue carpet for Mountaineer basketball players to use when taking the court for pre-game warm-ups. In addition, Mountaineer players warmed up with a special gold and blue basketball. The University continued this tradition until the late 1960s when it died out, but former Mountaineer player <a href="/wiki/Gale_Catlett" id="w">Gale Catlett</a> reintroduced the carpet when he returned to West Virginia University in 1978 as head coach of the men&#39;s basketball team.</p>

<p>In 2007, after winning the NIT Championship, West Virginia players donned t-shirts that were misspelled to read &#34;West Virgina.&#34; The Mountaineers wore them anyway after their 78-73 victory over Clemson in the final. WVU sports information director Shelly Poe said the NIT printed the shirts.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
