<p>After their marriage, Prince Andrew continued his career in the military and Princess Andrew became involved in charity work. In 1908 she visited Russia for the wedding of <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Maria_Pavlovna_of_Russia_(1890-1958)" id="w">Grand Duchess Marie of Russia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prince_Wilhelm%2C_Duke_of_S%C3%B6dermanland" id="w">Prince William of Sweden</a>.

<p>The global war effectively ended much of the political power of Europe&#39;s dynasties.

She worked for the Red Cross organization, helped organize soup kitchens for the starving populace and flew to <a href="/wiki/Sweden" id="w">Sweden</a> to bring back medical supplies on the pretext of visiting her sister, <a href="/wiki/Louise_Mountbatten" id="w">Louise</a>, who was married to <a href="/wiki/Gustaf_VI_Adolf_of_Sweden" id="w">the Crown Prince</a>.<sup id="_ref-vickers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vickers" title="">[35]</a></sup> She organised two shelters for orphaned and stray children, and a nursing circuit for poor neighbourhoods.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>The occupying forces apparently presumed Princess Andrew was pro-German, as one of her sons-in-law, <a href="/wiki/Prince_Christoph_of_Hesse-Cassel" id="w">Prince Christoph of Hesse-Cassel</a>, was a member of the <a href="/wiki/NSDAP" id="w">NSDAP</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Waffen-SS" id="w">Waffen-SS</a>, and another, <a href="/wiki/Prince_Berthold%2C_Margrave_of_Baden" id="w">Berthold von Baden</a>, had been invalided out of the German army in 1940 after an injury in <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>. Nonetheless, when visited by a German general who asked her, &#34;Is there anything I can do for you?&#34;, she replied, &#34;You can take your troops out of my country&#34;.<sup id="_ref-vickers_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vickers" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the fall of Italian dictator <a href="/wiki/Benito_Mussolini" id="w">Benito Mussolini</a> in September 1943, the German Army occupied Athens, where a minority of Greek <a href="/wiki/Jew" id="w">Jews</a> had sought refuge. The majority (about 60,000 out of a total population of 75,000) were deported to <a href="/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps" id="w">Nazi concentration camps</a>, where all but 2,000 died.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> During this period, Princess Andrew hid Jewish widow Rachel Cohen and two of her five children, who sought to evade the <a href="/wiki/Gestapo" id="w">Gestapo</a> and deportation to the death camps.<sup id="_ref-vickers2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vickers2" title="">[38]</a></sup> Rachel&#39;s husband, Haimaki Cohen, had aided King George I of Greece in 1913. In return, King George offered him any service that he could perform, should Cohen ever need it. Cohen&#39;s son remembered this during the <a href="/wiki/Nazi" id="w">Nazi</a> threat, and appealed to Princess Andrew, one of only two remaining members of the Royal Family left in Greece (the other was Princess Nicholas). She honoured the promise and saved the Cohen family.<sup id="_ref-vickers2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-vickers2" title="">[38]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When Athens was liberated in October 1944, <a href="/wiki/Harold_Macmillan" id="w">Harold Macmillan</a> visited Princess Andrew and described her as &#34;living in humble, not to say somewhat squalid conditions.&#34;<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> In a letter to her son, she admitted that in the last week before liberation she had had no food except bread and butter, and no meat for several months.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> By early December the situation in Athens had far from improved, Communist guerillas (<a href="/wiki/ELAS" id="w">ELAS</a>) were fighting the British for control of the capital. As the fighting continued, Princess Andrew was informed that her husband had died, just as hopes of a post-war reunion of the couple were rising.<sup id="_ref-times_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-times" title="">[34]</a></sup> They had not seen each other since 1939. During the fighting, to the dismay of the British, she insisted on walking the streets distributing rations to policemen and children in contravention of the curfew order. When told that she might have been shot by a stray bullet, she replied &#34;they tell me that you don&#39;t hear the shot that kills you and in any case I am deaf. So, why worry about that?&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

<p>Princess Andrew returned to Great Britain in April 1947 to attend the wedding of her only son, now styled Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten R.N., to Princess Elizabeth, the elder daughter and heiress presumptive of <a href="/wiki/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">King George VI</a>, that November. She had some of her remaining jewels used in Princess Elizabeth&#39;s engagement ring.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> She sat at the head of her family on the north side of <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Abbey" id="w">Westminster Abbey</a>, opposite the King, <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Bowes-Lyon" id="w">Queen Elizabeth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mary_of_Teck" id="w">Queen Mary</a>. It was decided not to invite Princess Andrew&#39;s daughters to the wedding because of the depth of anti-German sentiment in Britain following World War II.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>In January 1949, the princess founded a nursing order of Greek Orthodox nuns, the <i>Christian Sisterhood of Martha and Mary</i>, modeled after the convent that her aunt, the martyr Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna, had founded in Russia in 1909. She trained on the Greek island of <a href="/wiki/Tinos" id="w">Tinos</a>, established a home for the order in a hamlet north of Athens, and undertook two tours of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> in 1950 and 1952 in an effort to raise funds. Her mother was baffled by her actions, &#34;What can you say of a nun who smokes and plays <a href="/wiki/Canasta" id="w">canasta</a>?&#34;, she said.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> Princess Andrew attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953 wearing a dress in the style of her nun&#39;s habit: a conservative two-tone grey long dress and a flowing nun-like headdress. However, the order eventually failed through a lack of suitable applicants.<sup id="_ref-nyt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nyt" title="">[45]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1960 she visited <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> at the invitation of <a href="/wiki/Rajkumari_Amrit_Kaur" id="w">Rajkumari Amrit Kaur</a>, who had been impressed by Princess Andrew&#39;s interest in Indian religious thought, and her own spiritual quest. The trip was cut short when she unexpectedly took ill, and her sister-in-law, <a href="/wiki/Edwina_Mountbatten" id="w">Edwina Mountbatten</a>, who happened to be passing through <a href="/wiki/Delhi" id="w">Delhi</a> on her own tour, had to smooth things with the Indian hosts who were taken aback at Princess Andrew&#39;s sudden change of plans. She later claimed she had had an <a href="/wiki/Out-of-body_experience" id="w">out-of-body experience</a>.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> Edwina continued her own tour, and died the following month.</p>
<p>Increasingly deaf and in failing health through incessant smoking, Princess Andrew left Greece for the last time following the <a href="/wiki/21_April" id="w">21 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1967" id="w">1967</a> Colonels&#39; Coup. Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh invited Princess Andrew to reside permanently in Great Britain at Buckingham Palace.<sup id="_ref-dnb_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[4]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Constantine_II_of_Greece" id="w">King Constantine II of the Hellenes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Queen_Anne-Marie_of_Greece" id="w">Queen Anne-Marie</a> went into exile that December after a failed royalist counter-coup.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Death_and_burial" name="Death_and_burial"></a><h1>Death and burial</h1>
<p>Despite suggestions of senility in later life, Princess Andrew remained lucid but physically frail.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> She died at Buckingham Palace in December 1969. She left no possessions, having given everything away. Initially her remains were placed in the Royal Crypt in <a href="/wiki/St_George%26%2339%3Bs_Chapel_at_Windsor_Castle" id="w">St George&#39;s Chapel at Windsor Castle</a>, but before she died she expressed her wish to be buried at the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Maria_Magdalene" id="w">Convent of Saint Mary Magdalene</a> in Gethsemane on the <a href="/wiki/Mount_of_Olives" id="w">Mount of Olives</a> in Jerusalem, Israel (near to her aunt <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Elizabeth_Fyodorovna" id="w">Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna</a>, a Russian Orthodox saint). When her daughter, <a href="/wiki/Princess_Sophie_of_Greece_and_Denmark" id="w">Princess George of Hanover</a>, complained that it would be too far away for them to visit her grave, she jested, &#34;Nonsense, there‚Äôs a perfectly good bus service!&#34;<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Her wish was finally realized on <a href="/wiki/3_August" id="w">3 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1988" id="w">1988</a> when her remains were transferred to her final resting place in a crypt below the church.<sup id="_ref-dnb_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dnb" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/31_October" id="w">31 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>, Princess Andrew&#39;s two surviving children, the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess George of Hanover, went to <a href="/wiki/Yad_Vashem" id="w">Yad Vashem</a> (the Holocaust Memorial) in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" id="w">Jerusalem</a> to witness a ceremony honouring her as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Righteous_among_the_Nations" id="w">Righteous among the Nations</a>&#34; for having hidden the Cohens in her house in Athens during the Second World War.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> Prince Philip said of his mother&#39;s sheltering of persecuted Jews, &#34;I suspect that it never occurred to her that her action was in any way special. She was a person with a deep religious faith, and she would have considered it to be a perfectly natural human reaction to fellow beings in distress.&#34;<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
