{{Middle-earth elves}}
In <a href="/wiki/J.__R.__R.__Tolkien" id="w">J.  R.  R.  Tolkien</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Legendarium" id="w">legendarium</a>, an <b>Elf</b> is an individual member of one of the races that inhabit the lands of <a href="/wiki/Arda" id="w">Arda</a>.  They appear in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hobbit" id="w">The Hobbit</a></i> and in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" id="w">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>, but their complex history is described in full only in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Silmarillion" id="w">The Silmarillion</a></i>, edited and published after Tolkien&#39;s death.  More details about them are given in the author&#39;s other writings edited and published since then, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Unfinished_Tales" id="w">Unfinished Tales</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_History_of_Middle-earth" id="w">The History of Middle-earth</a></i>.  <i>The History of Middle-earth</i> also reveals their textual and conceptual history, as Tolkien had been writing about Elves long before <i>The Hobbit</i> was published.  </p>
<a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2>Development</h2>
<p>Dancing faries and elves appear in much of Tolkien&#39;s early poetry because of the influence of a production of J.M.  Barrie&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Peter_Pan" id="w">Peter Pan</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" id="w">Birmingham</a> in 1910,<sup id="_ref-Carpenter_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carpenter" title="">[1]</a></sup> and his familiarity with the work of <a href="/wiki/Catholic" id="w">Catholic</a> mystic poet, <a href="/wiki/Francis_Thompson" id="w">Francis Thompson</a>.<sup id="_ref-Carpenter_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carpenter" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a philologist, Tolkien was interested in languages, and invented several of his own as a pastime.  In considering the nature of who might speak these languages, and what stories they might tell, Tolkien again turned to the concept of Elves.<sup id="_ref-Carpenter_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carpenter" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the earliest forms of the stories which root the Elvish languages,<i><a href="/wiki/The_Book_of_Lost_Tales" id="w">The Book of Lost Tales</a></i> Tolkien develops a theme that the dimunitive fairy-like race of Elves had actually once been a great and mighty people, and as Men took over the world, these Elves had &#34;diminished&#34;.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Fimi_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fimi" title="">[4]</a></sup>.  This theme resurfaces in the much later <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" id="w">The Lord of the Rings</a></i> in the dialogue of <a href="/wiki/Galadriel" id="w">Galadriel</a>.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Tolkien&#39;s Elves are also considered to be inspired by <a href="/wiki/Catholic" id="w">Catholic</a> theology - as representing the state of Men in Eden who have not yet &#34;fallen&#34; - similar to humans but taller, fairer and wiser, with greater spiritual powers, keener senses, and a closer empathy with nature.   Tolkien wrote of them - &#34;They are made by man in his own image and likeness; but freed from those limitations which he feels most to press upon him.  They are immortal, and their will is directly effective for the achievement of imagination and desire.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Carpenter_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carpenter" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Awakening" name="Awakening"></a><h3>Awakening</h3>
<p>{{main}}
The Elves awoke during the <a href="/wiki/Years_of_the_Trees" id="w">Years of the Trees</a> in the <a href="/wiki/First_Age" id="w">First Age</a> on the shores of Lake <a href="/wiki/Cuivi%C3%A9nen" id="w">Cuiviénen</a> under the starlit sky, as <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth" id="w">Middle-earth</a> lay in darkness by then.  There they were discovered by the <a href="/wiki/Vala_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Vala</a> <a href="/wiki/Orom%C3%AB" id="w">Oromë</a>, who brought the tidings of their awakening to <a href="/wiki/Valinor" id="w">Valinor</a>.  </p>
<p><i>The Silmarillion</i> states that <a href="/wiki/Melkor" id="w">Melkor</a>, the Dark Lord, had already captured some wandering Elves, and twisted and mutilated them until they became the <a href="/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Orcs</a>.  However, Tolkien ultimately became uncomfortable with this Elvish origin, and devised different theories about the <a href="/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth)#The origin of Orcs" id="w">origin of Orcs</a>.<sup id="_ref-morgoth's ring1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-morgoth's ring1" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

The Valar decided to summon the Elves to Valinor rather than leaving them dwelling in place where they were first awakened, near the Cuiviénen lake in the eastern extremity of Middle-earth.  They sent Oromë, who took <a href="/wiki/Ingw%C3%AB" id="w">Ingwë</a>, <a href="/wiki/Finw%C3%AB" id="w">Finwë</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elw%C3%AB" id="w">Elwë</a> as ambassadors to Valinor.</p>
<p>Returning to Middle-earth, Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë convinced a great host to take the journey to Valinor.  Not all Elves accepted the summons though, and those who did not became known as the <b><a href="/wiki/Avari" id="w">Avari</a></b>, <i>The Unwilling</i>.</p>
<p>The others were called <b>Eldar</b>, <i>the People of the Stars</i> by Oromë, and they took Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë as their leaders, and became respectively the <a href="/wiki/Vanyar" id="w">Vanyar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Noldor" id="w">Noldor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Teleri" id="w">Teleri</a>.  On their journey, some of the Teleri feared the <a href="/wiki/Misty_Mountains" id="w">Misty Mountains</a> and dared not cross them.  They turned back and stayed in the vales of the <a href="/wiki/Anduin" id="w">Anduin</a>, and became the <a href="/wiki/Nandor_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Nandor</a>; these were led by Lenwë.</p>
<p>Oromë led the others over the Misty Mountains and <a href="/wiki/Ered_Lindon" id="w">Ered Lindon</a> into <a href="/wiki/Beleriand" id="w">Beleriand</a>.  There Elwë became lost, and the Teleri stayed behind looking for him.  The Vanyar and the Noldor moved onto a floating island that was moved by <a href="/wiki/Ulmo" id="w">Ulmo</a> to Valinor.  </p>
<p>After years, Ulmo returned to Beleriand to seek out the remaining Teleri.  As Elwë had not yet been found, a great part of the Teleri took his brother <a href="/wiki/Olw%C3%AB" id="w">Olwë</a> as their leader and were ferried to Valinor.  Some Teleri stayed behind though, still looking for Elwë, and others stayed on the shores, being called by <a href="/wiki/Oss%C3%AB" id="w">Ossë</a>.  They took <a href="/wiki/C%C3%ADrdan" id="w">Círdan</a> as their leader and became the <b><a href="/wiki/Falathrim" id="w">Falathrim</a></b>.  All Teleri who stayed in Beleriand later became known as the <b><a href="/wiki/Sindar" id="w">Sindar</a></b>.</p>
<a id="Exile" name="Exile"></a><h3>Exile</h3>
<p>{{main}}
In Valinor, Fëanor, son of Finwë, and the greatest of the Noldor, created the <a href="/wiki/Silmaril" id="w">Silmarils</a> in which he stored a part of the light of the <a href="/wiki/Two_Trees" id="w">Two Trees</a> that were lighting Valinor.  After three ages in the Halls of Mandos, Melkor was released.  He spread his evil, and eventually killed Finwë and stole the Silmarils.  Fëanor then named him <i>Morgoth</i> (<a href="/wiki/Quenya" id="w">Q</a>.  <i>The Black Enemy</i>).  Fëanor and his seven <a href="/wiki/Sons_of_F%C3%ABanor" id="w">sons</a> then <a href="/wiki/Oath_of_F%C3%ABanor" id="w">swore</a> to take the Silmarils back, and led a large army of the Noldor to Beleriand.</p>
<a id="Wars_of_Beleriand" name="Wars_of_Beleriand"></a><h3>Wars of Beleriand</h3>
<p>{{main}}
In Beleriand, Elwë was eventually found, and married <a href="/wiki/Melian" id="w">Melian</a> the <a href="/wiki/Maia_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Maia</a>.  He became the overlord of Beleriand, naming himself Thingol (<a href="/wiki/Sindarin" id="w">S</a>.  <i>Grey-cloak</i>).  After the <a href="/wiki/First_Battle_of_Beleriand" id="w">First Battle of Beleriand</a>, during the first rising of the Moon, the Noldor arrived in Beleriand.  They laid a <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Angband" id="w">siege</a> around <a href="/wiki/Angband_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Angband</a> (Morgoth&#39;s fortress), but were eventually defeated.</p>
<p>Then <a href="/wiki/E%C3%A4rendil_the_Mariner" id="w">Eärendil the Mariner</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Half-elven" id="w">half-elf</a> from the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Finw%C3%AB" id="w">House of Finwë</a>, sailed to Valinor to ask the Valar for help.  Then the Ban of the Noldor was lifted, and the Valar started the <a href="/wiki/War_of_Wrath" id="w">War of Wrath</a>, in which Morgoth was finally overcome.</p>
<a id="Second_and_Third_Age" name="Second_and_Third_Age"></a><h3>Second and Third Age</h3>
<p>After the War of Wrath, the Valar tried to summon the Elves back to Valinor.  Many complied, but some stayed.  During the <a href="/wiki/Second_Age" id="w">Second Age</a> they founded the Realms of <a href="/wiki/Lindon" id="w">Lindon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eregion" id="w">Eregion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mirkwood" id="w">Mirkwood</a>.  <a href="/wiki/Sauron" id="w">Sauron</a>, Morgoth’s former servant, made war upon them, but with the aid of the <a href="/wiki/N%C3%BAmen%C3%B3reans" id="w">Númenóreans</a> they defeated him.</p>
<p>During the Second and <a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">Third Age</a> they held some protected realms with the aid of the <a href="/wiki/Rings_of_Power" id="w">Rings of Power</a>, but after the <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Ring" id="w">War of the Ring</a> they waned further, and most Elves left Middle-earth for Valinor.  Tolkien&#39;s published writings give somewhat contradictory hints as to what happened to the Elves of Middle-earth after the <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" id="w">One Ring</a> was destroyed at the end of the <a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">Third Age</a>.   </p>
<p>After the destruction of the <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" id="w">One Ring</a>, the power of the <a href="/wiki/Three_Rings" id="w">Three Rings</a> of the Elves would also end and the Age of Men would begin.   Elves that remained in Middle-earth were doomed to a slow decline until, in the words of <a href="/wiki/Galadriel" id="w">Galadriel</a>, they faded and became a &#34;rustic folk of dell and cave,&#34; and were greatly diminished from their ancient power and nobility.  While the power of the remaining <a href="/wiki/Noldor" id="w">Noldor</a> would be immediately lessened, the &#34;fading&#34; of all Elvenkind was a phenomenon that would play out over hundreds and even thousands of years;  until, in fact, our own times, when occasional glimpses of rustic Elves would fuel our folktales and fantasies.</p>
<p>There are many references in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> to the continued existence of Elves in Middle-earth during the early years of the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_Age" id="w">Fourth Age</a>.   <a href="/wiki/Elladan" id="w">Elladan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elrohir" id="w">Elrohir</a>, the sons of Elrond, do not accompany their father when the White Ship bearing the <a href="/wiki/Ring-bearer" id="w">Ring-bearer</a> and the chief Noldorin leaders sails from the <a href="/wiki/Grey_Havens" id="w">Grey Havens</a> to <a href="/wiki/Valinor" id="w">Valinor</a>;  they are said to have remained in <a href="/wiki/Lindon" id="w">Lindon</a> for a time.   Celeborn is said (in Appendix A) to have added most of southern <a href="/wiki/Mirkwood" id="w">Mirkwood</a> to the realm of <a href="/wiki/L%C3%B3rien" id="w">Lórien</a> at the end of the Third Age, but elsewhere Tolkien wrote that Celeborn dwelt for a while in Lindon before at last leaving Middle-earth for Valinor.</p>
<p>Tolkien also wrote that Elves moved to Ithilien during King <a href="/wiki/Elessar" id="w">Elessar</a>&#39;s reign, and assisted in the rebuilding of Gondor.  They primarily resided in southern Ithilien, along the shores of the Anduin.  It is also implied that Elves continued to dwell at the Grey Havens, at least for a certain period.   Tolkien states that <a href="/wiki/C%C3%ADrdan" id="w">Círdan</a> did not sail with <a href="/wiki/Elrond" id="w">Elrond</a>, Galadriel, and the others at the end of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and <a href="/wiki/Sam_Gamgee" id="w">Sam Gamgee</a> sailed from the Havens decades afterwards, so it would seem that at least some Elves remained in <a href="/wiki/Mithlond" id="w">Mithlond</a> at that time.   Círdan would supposedly leave on the last ship ever to leave the havens.   <a href="/wiki/Legolas" id="w">Legolas</a> also sailed to Valinor after Elessar&#39;s death, and although the reference to this in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> states that it was Legolas himself that built the ship, it seems unlikely that any Wood-Elf from Mirkwood could have done so without the assistance of Círdan&#39;s folk, whom Tolkien elsewhere said were the only Elves remaining at the end of the Third Age with the skill to build the great ships that sailed from Middle-earth to the Blessed Realm.</p>
<p>In &#34;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&#34; that is found in Appendix A, Tolkien depicts a Middle-earth where most Elves have already left.  The majority of those who remained lived in Mirkwood, while a much smaller population was in <a href="/wiki/Lindon" id="w">Lindon</a>.  Aragorn speaks of the empty garden of Elrond in Rivendell.   Most strikingly, after Elessar&#39;s voluntary death, <a href="/wiki/Arwen" id="w">Arwen</a> flees to a Lórien that is depicted as wholly abandoned, and gives up her own spirit in its sad and silent confines.</p>
<a id="Life_cycle" name="Life_cycle"></a><h2>Life cycle</h2>
<p>{{Cleanup-section}}
As told in <i><a href="/wiki/The_History_of_Middle-earth" id="w">The History of Middle-earth</a></i> and in Tolkien&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Letters_of_J.__R.__R.__Tolkien" id="w">Letters</a></i>, Elves had a different life cycle than Men.  Most of the following information strictly refers only to the Eldar, as found in his essay <b><i>Laws and Customs among the Eldar</i></b>, found in <i><a href="/wiki/Morgoth%26%2339%3Bs_Ring" id="w">Morgoth&#39;s Ring</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h3>Early life</h3>
<p>Elves are born about one year from their <a href="/wiki/Conception" id="w">conception</a>.  The day of their conception is celebrated, not the actual <a href="/wiki/Birthday" id="w">birthday</a> itself.  Their minds develop quicker than their bodies; by their first year, they can speak, walk and even dance, and their quicker onset of mental maturity makes young Elves seem, to Men, older than they really are.  Physical <a href="/wiki/Puberty" id="w">puberty</a> comes in around their fiftieth to one hundredth year (by age fifty they reach their adult height), and by their first hundred years of life outside the womb all Elves are fully grown.<sup id="_ref-laws_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-laws" title="">[10]</a></sup> Elven bodies slow down and stop aging physically, while human bodies do not.{{Fact}}</p>
<a id="Sexuality%2C_marriage%2C_and_parenthood" name="Sexuality%2C_marriage%2C_and_parenthood"></a><h3>Sexuality, marriage, and parenthood</h3>

<p>Elves marry freely and for love early in life.  <a href="/wiki/Monogamy" id="w">Monogamy</a> is practised and <a href="/wiki/Adultery" id="w">adultery</a> is unthinkable; they only marry once (Finwë, first High King of the Noldor, was an exception, as he remarried after his first wife died).<sup id="_ref-laws_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-laws" title="">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Spouses can choose each other even long before they are married, thus becoming betrothed.   The betrothal is subject to parental approval unless the parties are of age and intend to marry soon, at which point the betrothal is announced at a meeting of the two houses.   They exchange rings and the betrothal lasts at least a year, and is revocable by the return of the rings; however, it is rarely broken.  After their formal betrothal, the couple appoint a date, at least a year later, for the wedding.<sup id="_ref-laws_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-laws" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Marriage is celebrated at a feast of the two houses.  They give back their betrothal rings and receive others worn on their index fingers.  The bride’s mother gives the groom a jewel to be worn.  Only the words exchanged by the bride and groom (including the speaking of the name of <a href="/wiki/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar" id="w">Eru Ilúvatar</a>) and the consummation are required for marriage.<sup id="_ref-laws_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-laws" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Elves view the sexual act as extremely special and intimate, for it leads to the conception and birth of children.  <a href="/wiki/Extra-marital_sex" id="w">Extra-marital</a> and <a href="/wiki/Premarital_sex" id="w">premarital sex</a> are unthinkable, <a href="/wiki/Adultery" id="w">adultery</a> is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses is absolute.  Yet a sundering during pregnancy or during the early years of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they prefer to have children in peaceful times.  Elves can not be raped or forced to have sex; before that they will lose the will to live and go to Mandos.<sup id="_ref-laws_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-laws" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Elves have few children, as a rule (Fëanor and <a href="/wiki/Nerdanel" id="w">Nerdanel</a> were an exception, conceiving seven sons), and there are relatively sizable intervals between each child (but see below for notes on Elvish birth rates in Middle-earth versus in Aman).  They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their <a href="/wiki/Libido" id="w">libido</a> wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts.  Nonetheless, they take great delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.<sup id="_ref-laws_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-laws" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>There seems to only be one known example of extreme marital strife in Tolkien&#39;s mythology, that of <a href="/wiki/E%C3%B6l" id="w">Eöl</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aredhel" id="w">Aredhel</a>, in which the latter actually left the former without his knowledge, resulting in Eöl ultimately killing her.  However, this marriage was far from typical of the Elves.</p>
<a id="Daily_life" name="Daily_life"></a><h3>Daily life</h3>
<p>The Elves, particularly the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various things, such as smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat{{Fact}}.  Males and females can do almost everything equally; however, the females often specialise in the arts of healing while the men go to war.  This is because they believe that taking life interferes with the ability to preserve life.  However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as <a href="/wiki/Elrond" id="w">Elrond</a>.<sup id="_ref-laws_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-laws" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Later_life" name="Later_life"></a><h3>Later life</h3>
<p>Eventually, if they do not die in battle or from some other cause, the Elves of Middle-earth grow weary of it and desire to go to Valinor, where the Valar originally sheltered their kind.  Those who wish to leave for the Undying Lands go by boats provided at the <a href="/wiki/Grey_Havens" id="w">Grey Havens</a>, where <a href="/wiki/C%C3%ADrdan" id="w">Círdan</a> the Shipwright dwells with his folk.</p>
<a id="%22The_third_cycle_of_life%2C%22_aging%2C_and_facial_hair" name="%22The_third_cycle_of_life%2C%22_aging%2C_and_facial_hair"></a><h3>&#34;The third cycle of life,&#34; aging, and facial hair</h3>
<p>Despite Tolkien&#39;s statements in <i>The Hobbit</i> that Elves (and Hobbits) have no beards, Círdan in fact has a beard, which appears to be an anomaly and a simple oversight.  However, Tolkien later devised at least  three &#34;cycles of life&#34; for Elves around 1960; Círdan had a beard because he was in his third cycle of life.   (<a href="/wiki/Mahtan" id="w">Mahtan</a>, Nerdanel&#39;s father, had a beard in his second cycle of life, a rare phenomenon.)  It is unclear what these cycles exactly are, since Tolkien left no notes further explaining this.  Apparently, beards were the only sign of further natural physical aging beyond maturity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Tolkien may have ultimately changed his mind about whether Elves had facial hair.  As Christopher Tolkien states in <i><a href="/wiki/Unfinished_Tales" id="w">Unfinished Tales</a></i>, his father wrote in December 1972 or later that the Elvish strain in Men, such as <a href="/wiki/Aragorn" id="w">Aragorn</a>, was &#34;<i>observable in the beardlessness of those who were so descended</i>&#34;, since &#34;<i>it was a characteristic of all Elves to be beardless</i>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> This would seemingly contradict the information above.</p>
<p>Elves sometimes appear to age under great stress.  Círdan appeared to be aged himself, since he is described as looking old, save for the stars in his eyes; this may be due to all the sorrows he had seen and lived through since the First Age.  Also, the people of <a href="/wiki/Gwindor" id="w">Gwindor</a> of <a href="/wiki/Nargothrond" id="w">Nargothrond</a> had trouble recognizing him after his time as a prisoner of Morgoth.</p>
<a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h3>Death</h3>
<p>Elves are naturally immortal.   In addition to their immortality, Elves are immune to all diseases{{Fact}}, and they can recover from wounds which would normally kill a mortal Man{{Fact}}.   However, Elves can be slain, or die of grief and weariness.   In this way they are not truly immortal, at least not in a literal sense, but have indefinite lifespans (they will not die of age, but can be killed in battle).   Even so, this idea is collectively called <i>immortality</i>.</p>
<p>Elves who die or are killed go to the Halls of Mandos in Valinor.   After a certain period of time and rest that serves as &#34;cleansing&#34;, their spirits (<i><a href="/wiki/F%C3%ABa_and_hr%C3%B6a" id="w">fëa</a></i>) are clothed in bodies (<i><a href="/wiki/F%C3%ABa_and_hr%C3%B6a" id="w">hröa</a></i>) identical to their old ones.<sup id="_ref-converse_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-converse" title="">[12]</a></sup> They almost never go back to Middle-earth, however.  The only Elf known to have done so was <a href="/wiki/Glorfindel" id="w">Glorfindel</a>.  A rare and more unusual example of an Elf coming back from the Halls of Mandos can be read in the tale of Beren and Lúthien, as <a href="/wiki/L%C3%BAthien" id="w">Lúthien</a> was the other Elf to be sent back to Middle-earth - as a mortal, however.</p>
<p>Eventually, their immortal spirits (<i>fëa</i>) will overwhelm and consume their bodies (<i>hröa</i>), rendering them &#34;bodiless&#34;, whether they opt to go to Valinor or remain in Middle-earth.  At the end of the world, all Elves will have become invisible to mortal eyes, except to those to whom they wish to manifest themselves.<sup id="_ref-laws_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-laws" title="">[10]</a></sup> Tolkien called the Elves of Middle-earth who had undergone this process &#34;Lingerers&#34;<sup id="_ref-laws_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-laws" title="">[10]</a></sup>, and the process may be thought of as a fourth and final cycle of Elven life.</p>
<p>The lives of Elves only endure as the world endures;<sup id="_ref-laws_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-laws" title="">[10]</a></sup> however, it is said in the Second Prophecy of <a href="/wiki/Mandos" id="w">Mandos</a> that at the end of time the Elves will join the other <a href="/wiki/Children_of_Il%C3%BAvatar" id="w">Children of Ilúvatar</a> in singing the Second Music of the <a href="/wiki/Ainur" id="w">Ainur</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>However it is disputable whether the Prophecy is canon, and the published <a href="/wiki/Silmarillion" id="w">Silmarillion</a> states that the ultimate fate of the Elves is unknown.</p>
<a id="Names_and_naming_conventions" name="Names_and_naming_conventions"></a><h2>Names and naming conventions</h2>
<p>In <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> Tolkien pretends to be merely the translator of Bilbo and Frodo&#39;s memoirs, collectively known as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Red_Book_of_Westmarch" id="w">Red Book of Westmarch</a>&#34;.  He says many of the names and terms appearing in the work, as well in the earlier <i>The Hobbit</i>, are meant to be his representations of actual Middle-earth terms.  Thus, Elves were not actually called &#34;Elves&#34; by anyone throughout Tolkien&#39;s writings.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Instead, they are called the &#34;Firstborn&#34; (<a href="/wiki/Quenya" id="w">Q</a>.  <i>Minnónar</i>) or the &#34;Elder Kindred&#34; (as opposed to <a href="/wiki/Man_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Men</a>, the Secondborn) as they were &#34;awakened&#34; before Men by <a href="/wiki/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar" id="w">Eru Ilúvatar</a> (<a href="/wiki/God" id="w">God</a>).  The Elves named themselves <i>Quendi</i> (&#34;the Speakers&#34;), in honour of the fact that, when they were created, they were the only living beings able to speak.  The <a href="/wiki/D%C3%BAnedain" id="w">Dúnedain</a> called them <i>Nimîr</i> (&#34;the Beautiful&#34;), while their usual name in <a href="/wiki/Sindarin" id="w">Sindarin</a> was <i>Eledhrim</i>.<sup id="_ref-QuendiandEldar1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-QuendiandEldar1" title="">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In other writings, part of <i>The History of Middle-earth</i>, Tolkien details Elvish naming conventions.  The Quenya word for &#34;name&#34; was <i>essë</i>. An Elf of Valinor was typically given one name (<i>ataressë</i>) at birth by the father.  It usually reflected either the name of the father or mother, indicating the person&#39;s descent, to which later some distinguishing prefix could be added.  As the Elf grew older, they received a second name (<i>amilessë</i>), given by the mother.  This name was extremely important and reflected personality, skills, or fate, sometimes being &#39;prophetic&#39;.  </p>
<p>The <i>epessë</i> or the &#34;after-name&#34; is the third type.  It was given later in life, not necessarily by kin, as a title of admiration and honour.  In some circumstances, yet another name was chosen by the Elf themselves, called <i>kilmessë</i> meaning &#34;self-name&#34;.</p>
<p>The &#34;true names&#34; remained the first two, though an Elf could be referred to by any of these.  Mother-names were usually not used by those who did not know the Elf well.  In later history and song any of the four could become the one generally used and recognised.</p>
<p>After their Exile to Middle-earth and adoption of <a href="/wiki/Sindarin" id="w">Sindarin</a> as the daily speech, most of the Noldor also chose for themselves a name that fitted the style of that language, translating or altering one of their <a href="/wiki/Quenya" id="w">Quenya</a> names.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Patronymic" id="w">patronymic</a> surname is also used  — the father&#39;s name with the suffix &#34;-ion&#34; added.  Thus, <a href="/wiki/Gildor_Inglorion" id="w">Gildor Inglorion</a> is &#34;<i>Gildor, son of Inglor</i>&#34;.</p>
<p>Several examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Galadriel" id="w">Galadriel</a></b> is the Sindarin translation of Alatáriel, the Telerin Quenya <i>epessë</i> originally given to her by <a href="/wiki/Celeborn" id="w">Celeborn</a>, which means &#34;Maiden Crowned by a Radiant Garland&#34;.  Her father-name is Artanis (noble woman) and her mother-name is Nerwen (man-maiden).</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Maedhros" id="w">Maedhros</a></b>, the oldest son of <a href="/wiki/F%C3%ABanor" id="w">Fëanor</a>, was called <i>Russandol</i> (copper-top) by his brothers: He had earned this <i>epessë</i> because of his ruddy hair.  His father-name had been <i>Nelyafinwë</i> (Finwë the third: Fëanor&#39;s own father-name had been (Curu) Finwë), and his mother-name <i>Maitimo</i> (well-shaped one).  <i>Maedhros</i> is a rendering into Sindarin of parts of his mother-name and <i>epessë</i>.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Finrod_Felagund" id="w">Finrod</a></b> is usually referred to as <i>Felagund</i> (hewer of caves), a name the <a href="/wiki/Dwarf_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Dwarves</a> had given to him (originally <i>Felakgundu</i>) because of his dwellings at <a href="/wiki/Nargothrond" id="w">Nargothrond</a>.  Finrod adopted the name, and made it a title of honour.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/C%C3%ADrdan" id="w">Círdan</a></b> (Shipwright) is the <i>epessë</i> of a <a href="/wiki/Teleri" id="w">Telerin</a> Elf who remained in <a href="/wiki/Beleriand" id="w">Beleriand</a>, and later <a href="/wiki/Lindon" id="w">Lindon</a>, until the end of the <a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">Third Age</a>.  His original name was only rarely remembered in traditions as <i>Nōwē</i>, and he was referred to always as Círdan, a title which had been given to him as Lord of the <a href="/wiki/Falas" id="w">Falas</a>.</li></ul>
<a id="Elvish_languages" name="Elvish_languages"></a><h2>Elvish languages</h2>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Tolkien created many languages for Elves.  His interest was primarily <a href="/wiki/Philology" id="w">philological</a>, and he said his stories grew out of his languages.  Indeed, the languages were the first thing Tolkien ever created for his mythos, starting with what he originally called &#34;Qenya&#34;, the first primitive form of Elvish.  This was later called <a href="/wiki/Quenya" id="w">Quenya</a> (High-elven) and, along with <a href="/wiki/Sindarin" id="w">Sindarin</a> (Grey-elven), is one of the two most complete of Tolkien&#39;s languages.  In addition to these two he also created several other (partially derived) languages.</p>
<p>Elves are also credited with creating the <a href="/wiki/Tengwar" id="w">Tengwar</a> (by <a href="/wiki/F%C3%ABanor" id="w">Fëanor</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Cirth" id="w">Cirth</a> (<a href="/wiki/Daeron" id="w">Daeron</a>) runic scripts.</p>

<p>The 1979 <a href="/wiki/Rankin_Bass" id="w">Rankin Bass</a> animated version of <i>The Hobbit</i>, with character designs by Lester Abrams, features Elves as green-skinned warriors with slightly <a href="/wiki/Austrians" id="w">Austrian</a>-<a href="/wiki/German_language" id="w">German</a> accents. </p>
<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/MERP" id="w">Middle-earth Role Playing</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Iron_Crown_Enterprises" id="w">Iron Crown Enterprises</a>, 1986), three tribes of elves are presented as <a href="/wiki/Player_character" id="w">player character</a> race options, the Silvan, Sinda and Noldo - each receiving statistic bonuses (ranging from 5 to 15) to all attributes apart from Strength, with the Noldo receiving the highest accumulative bonuses of any racial type in the game. All three tribes are statistically immune to disease (+100% chance of resistance), and must be given &#39;Presence&#39; as the highest randomly generated statistic. Elven characters also receive significant skill bonuses with missile weapons (such as a bow and arrow) and stealth skills (such as hiding).</p>
<p>All 3  elven tribes (Silvan, Noldor, Sindar) depicted in <a href="/wiki/Lord_of_the_Rings_Roleplaying_Game" id="w">Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game</a> (<a href="/wiki/Decipher%2C_Inc." id="w">Decipher, Inc.</a>, 2001) have varying (one or two points) statistic bonuses to Bearing, Perception and Nimbleness, with the Noldor also receiving a bonus to Wits and the Sindar to Vitality, giving both of these the highest accumulative bonuses available to Player Characters. The system of skills, feats and flaws further outlines racial and cultural characteristics, bonuses being given to the Noldor in Lore and &#34;Resisting the Shadow&#34;, to the Silvan elves for various wood-craft skills, and the Sindar to musical performance. All elves have the ability to enchant objects, and receive bonuses in any test regarding magic.</p>
<p>In the <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Strategy_Battle_Game" id="w">The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Games_Workshop" id="w">Games Workshop</a>, 2001), Elves have similar statistics to similarly armed Men, except for much higher scores for their Fighting and Courage attributes.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> On average, Elven wargear (armour and weapons) give twice the advantage of weapons made by Men.</p>
