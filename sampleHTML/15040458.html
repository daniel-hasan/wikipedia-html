The <b>History of the Ming Dynasty</b> ({{zh-cp}}) covers a period including its rule as the <a href="/wiki/Dynasties_in_Chinese_history" id="w">dynasty</a> of <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China</a> from 1368 to 1644, following the collapse of the <a href="/wiki/Mongol" id="w">Mongol</a>-led <a href="/wiki/Yuan_Dynasty" id="w">Yuan Dynasty</a>. At its height, the Ming Dynasty had a population of 160 million people,<sup id="_ref-fairbank 128_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fairbank 128" title="">[1]</a></sup> while some assert the population could actually have been as large as 200 million.<sup id="_ref-ebrey cambridge 197_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey cambridge 197" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ming rule saw the construction of a vast <a href="/wiki/Naval_history_of_China" id="w">navy</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Standing_army" id="w">standing army</a> of 1,000,000 troops.<sup id="_ref-ebrey east asia 271_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey east asia 271" title="">[3]</a></sup> Although private maritime trade and official tribute missions from China took place in previous dynasties, the size of the tributary fleet under the <a href="/wiki/Muslim" id="w">Muslim</a> <a href="/wiki/Eunuch" id="w">eunuch</a> admiral <a href="/wiki/Zheng_He" id="w">Zheng He</a> in the 15th century surpassed all others in grandeur.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Mongol_Empire" id="w">Mongol</a>-led <a href="/wiki/Yuan_Dynasty" id="w">Yuan Dynasty</a> (1279&#8211;1368) ruled before the establishment of the Ming Dynasty.

A number of Han Chinese groups revolted, including the <a href="/wiki/Red_Turban_Rebellion" id="w">Red Turbans</a> in 1351. The Red Turbans were affiliated with the <a href="/wiki/White_Lotus" id="w">White Lotus</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Buddhism" id="w">Buddhist</a> secret society. Zhu Yuanzhang was a penniless peasant and Buddhist monk who joined the Red Turbans in 1352, but soon gained a reputation after marrying the foster daughter of a rebel commander.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ebrey cambridge 190_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey cambridge 190" title="">[6]</a></sup> In 1356 Zhu&#39;s rebel force captured the city of <a href="/wiki/Nanjing" id="w">Nanjing</a>,<sup id="_ref-gascoigne 151_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gascoigne 151" title="">[7]</a></sup> which he would later establish as the capital of the Ming Dynasty. </p>

<p>Instead of the traditional way of naming a dynasty after the first ruler&#39;s home district, Hongwu&#39;s choice of &#39;Ming&#39; or &#39;Brilliant&#39; for his dynasty followed a Mongol precedent of an uplifting title.<sup id="_ref-gascoigne 151_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gascoigne 151" title="">[7]</a></sup> Zhu Yuanzhang also took <a href="/wiki/Hongwu_Emperor" id="w">Hongwu</a>, or &#39;Vastly Martial&#39; as his reign title.

Hongwu immediately set to rebuilding state infrastructure.

Hongwu organized a military system known as the <i>weisuo</i>, which was similar to the <a href="/wiki/Fubing_system" id="w">&#39;&#39;fubing&#39;&#39; system</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Tang_Dynasty" id="w">Tang Dynasty</a> (618&#8211;907).

<p>In 1381, the Ming Dynasty annexed the areas of the southwest that had once been part of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Dali" id="w">Kingdom of Dali</a>. By the end of the 14th century, some 200,000 military colonists settled some 2,000,000 <i>mu</i> (350,000 acres) of land in what is now <a href="/wiki/Yunnan" id="w">Yunnan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Guizhou" id="w">Guizhou</a>.<sup id="_ref-ebrey cambridge 195_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey cambridge 195" title="">[18]</a></sup> Roughly half a million more Chinese settlers came in later periods; these migrations caused a major shift in the ethnic make-up of the region, since more than half of the roughly 3,000,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty were non-Han peoples.<sup id="_ref-ebrey cambridge 195_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey cambridge 195" title="">[18]</a></sup> In this region, the Ming government adopted a policy of dual administration.

According to historian Timothy Brook, the Hongwu Emperor attempted to immobilize society by creating rigid, state-regulated boundaries between villages and larger townships, discouraging trade and travel in society not permitted by the government.<sup id="_ref-brook 19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brook 19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Hongwu attempted to instill austere values by imposing uniform dress codes, standard methods of speech, and standard style of writing <a href="/wiki/Chinese_literature#Classical prose" id="w">classical prose</a> that did not flaunt the skills of the highly educated.<sup id="_ref-brook 30 32_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brook 30 32" title="">[20]</a></sup> His suspicion for the educated elite matched his disdain for the commercial elites, imposing inordinately high taxes upon the hotbed of powerful merchant families in the region of <a href="/wiki/Suzhou" id="w">Suzhou</a> in <a href="/wiki/Jiangsu" id="w">Jiangsu</a>.<sup id="_ref-ebrey cambridge 192_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey cambridge 192" title="">[13]</a></sup> He also forcibly moved thousands of wealthy families from the southeast and resettled them around Nanjing in the <a href="/wiki/Jiangnan" id="w">Jiangnan</a> region, forbidding them to move once they were settled.<sup id="_ref-ebrey cambridge 192_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ebrey cambridge 192" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-brook 28 29_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brook 28 29" title="">[21]</a></sup> To keep track of the merchants&#39; activities, Hongwu forced them to register all of their goods once a month.<sup id="_ref-brook 65 67_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brook 65 67" title="">[22]</a></sup> One of his main goals as ruler was to permanently curb the influence of merchants and landlords, yet several of his policies would eventually encourage them to amass more wealth. </p>
<p>Hongwu&#39;s oppressive system of massive relocation and the desire to escape his harsh taxes encouraged many to become <a href="/wiki/Itinerant" id="w">itinerant</a> retailers, peddlers, or migrant workers finding tenant landowners who would rent them space to farm and labor on.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> By the mid Ming era, emperors had abandoned Hongwu&#39;s relocation scheme and instead trusted local officials to document migrant workers in order to bring in more revenue.<sup id="_ref-brook 97_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brook 97" title="">[24]</a></sup> An elite of wealthy landlords and merchants reigning over land tenants, wage laborers, domestic servants, and migrant workers was hardly the vision of Hongwu&#39;s: strict adherence to the hierarchic status system of the <a href="/wiki/Four_occupations" id="w">four occupations</a>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

Hongwu revived the agricultural sector to create self-sufficient communities that would not rely on commerce, which he assumed would remain only in urban areas.<sup id="_ref-brook 69_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brook 69" title="">[27]</a></sup> Yet the surplus created from this revival encouraged rural farmers to make profits by first selling their goods at thoroughfares; by the mid Ming era they began selling their goods in regional urban markets.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> As the countryside and urban areas became more connected through commerce, households in rural areas began taking on traditionally urban speciacializations, such as production of silk and cotton textiles.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> By the late Ming there was a growing concern amongst conservative Confucians that the metaphorical delicate fabric holding together the communal social order was being undermined by country rustics accepting every manner of urban life and decadence.<sup id="_ref-brook 124 125_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-brook 124 125" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>

The scholar-officials&#39; dependence upon the economic activities of the merchants became more than a trend when it was semi-institutionalized by the state in the mid Ming era.

In a prelude to a three-year-long civil war, Jianwen became engaged in a political showdown with his uncle Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan. Jianwen was aware of the ambitions of his princely uncles, establishing measures to limit their authority. The militant Zhu Di, given charge over the area encompassing Beijing to watch the Mongols on the frontier, was the most feared of these princes. After Jianwen arrested many of Zhu Di&#39;s associates, Zhu Di plotted a rebellion. Under the guise of rescuing the young Jianwen from corrupting officials, Zhu Di personally led forces in the revolt; the palace in Nanjing was burned to the ground, along with Zhu Di&#39;s nephew Jianwen, his wife, mother, and courtiers. Zhu Di assumed the throne as the <a href="/wiki/Yongle_Emperor" id="w">Yongle Emperor</a> (1402&#8211;1424); his reign is seen as a second founding of the Ming Dynasty since he reversed many of his father&#39;s policies.</p>

After laying dormant and dilapidated for decades, the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Canal_(China)" id="w">Grand Canal</a> was restored under Yongle from 1411&#8211;1415.

During the last years of Wanli&#39;s reign and those of his two successors, an economic crisis developed that was centered around a sudden widespread lack of the empire&#39;s chief medium of exchange: silver. The <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" id="w">Protestant</a> powers of the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_Republic" id="w">Dutch Republic</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_England" id="w">Kingdom of England</a> staged frequent raids and acts of piracy against the <a href="/wiki/Catholicism" id="w">Catholic</a>-based empires of Spain and Portugal in order to weaken their global economic power.<sup id="_ref-spence 19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 19" title="">[89]</a></sup> Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Philip_IV_of_Spain" id="w">Philip IV of Spain</a> (r. 1621&#8211;1665) began cracking down on illegal smuggling of silver from <a href="/wiki/Viceroyalty_of_New_Spain" id="w">Mexico</a> and <a href="/wiki/Viceroyalty_of_Peru" id="w">Peru</a> across the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" id="w">Pacific</a> towards China, in favor of shipping American-mined silver directly from Spain to Manila. In 1639, the new <a href="/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate" id="w">Tokugawa</a> regime of Japan shut down most of its foreign trade with European powers, causing a halt of yet another source of silver coming into China.</p>
<p>These events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces. People began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it, forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline.<sup id="_ref-spence 20_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 20" title="">[77]</a></sup> In the 1630s, a string of one thousand copper coins was worth an ounce of silver; by 1640 this was reduced to the value of half an ounce; by 1643 it was worth roughly one-third of an ounce.<sup id="_ref-spence 20_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 20" title="">[77]</a></sup> For peasants this was an economic disaster, since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and selling their crops with copper coins.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup></p>
<p>In this early half of the 17th century, famines became common in northern China because of unusual dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season; these were effects of a larger ecological event now known as the <a href="/wiki/Little_Ice_Age" id="w">Little Ice Age</a>.<sup id="_ref-spence 21_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 21" title="">[91]</a></sup> Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility.<sup id="_ref-spence 21_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 21" title="">[91]</a></sup> The central government was starved of resources and could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities.

A remarkable tribal leader named <a href="/wiki/Nurhaci" id="w">Nurhaci</a> (r. 1616&#8211;1626), starting with just a small tribe, rapidly gained control over all the <a href="/wiki/Manchuria" id="w">Manchurian</a> tribes. During the Imjin War he offered to lead his tribes in support of the Ming army. This offer was declined, but he was granted honorific Ming titles for his gesture.<sup id="_ref-spence 27_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 27" title="">[93]</a></sup> Recognizing the weakness in the Ming authority north of their border, he took control over all of the other unrelated tribes surrounding his homeland.<sup id="_ref-spence 27_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 27" title="">[93]</a></sup> In 1610 he broke relations with the Ming court; in 1618 he demanded the Ming pay tribute to him to redress the <i>seven grievances</i> which he documented and sent to the Ming court. This was, in a very real sense, a declaration of war as the Ming were not about to pay money to the Manchu. </p>
<p>Under the brilliant commander <a href="/wiki/Yuan_Chonghuan" id="w">Yuan Chonghuan</a> (1584&#8211;1630), the Ming were able to repeatedly fight off the Manchus, notably in 1626 at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Ningyuan" id="w">Battle of Ningyuan</a> and in 1628. Under Yuan&#39;s command the Ming had securely fortified the <a href="/wiki/Shanhaiguan" id="w">Shanhai pass</a>, thus blocking the Manchus from crossing the pass to attack the <a href="/wiki/Liaodong_Peninsula" id="w">Liaodong Peninsula</a>. Using European firearms acquired from his cook, he was able to stave off Nurhaci&#39;s advances along the <a href="/wiki/Liao_River" id="w">Liao River</a>.<sup id="_ref-spence 24_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 24" title="">[94]</a></sup> Although he was named field marshal of all the northeastern forces in 1628, he was executed in 1630 on trumped-up charges of colluding with the Manchus as they staged their raids.<sup id="_ref-spence 24 25_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 24 25" title="">[95]</a></sup> Succeeding generals proved unable to eliminate the Manchu threat. </p>
<p>Unable to attack the heart of Ming directly, the Manchu instead bided their time, developing their own artillery and gathering allies. They were able to enlist Ming government officials and generals as their strategic advisors. A large part of the Ming Army deserted to the Manchu banner. In 1632, they had conquered much of <a href="/wiki/Inner_Mongolia" id="w">Inner Mongolia</a>,<sup id="_ref-spence 24_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 24" title="">[94]</a></sup> resulting in a large scale recruitment of Mongol troops under the <a href="/wiki/Eight_Banners" id="w">Manchu banner</a> and the securing of an additional route into the Ming heartland. </p>
<p>By 1636, the Manchu ruler <a href="/wiki/Huang_Taiji" id="w">Huang Taiji</a> was confident enough to proclaim the Imperial <a href="/wiki/Qing_Dynasty" id="w">Qing Dynasty</a> at <a href="/wiki/Shenyang" id="w">Shenyang</a>, which had fallen to the Manchu in 1621 and was made their capital in 1625.<sup id="_ref-spence 24_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 24" title="">[94]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-spence 28_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 28" title="">[96]</a></sup> Huang Taiji took the Imperial title Chongde and changed the ethnic name of his people from <a href="/wiki/Jurchen" id="w">Jurchen</a> to Manchu.<sup id="_ref-spence 31_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 31" title="">[97]</a></sup> In 1638 the Manchu defeated and conquered Ming China&#39;s traditional ally <a href="/wiki/Korea" id="w">Korea</a> with an army of 100,000 troops. Shortly after the Koreans renounced their long-held loyalty to the Ming Dynasty.<sup id="_ref-spence 31_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 31" title="">[97]</a></sup></p>

A peasant soldier named <a href="/wiki/Li_Zicheng" id="w">Li Zicheng</a> (1606&#8211;1644) mutinied with his fellow soldiers in western Shaanxi in the early 1630s after the government failed to ship much-needed supplies there.<sup id="_ref-spence 21_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 21" title="">[91]</a></sup> In 1634 he was captured by a Ming general and released only on the terms that he return to service.<sup id="_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#_note-98" title="">[98]</a></sup> The agreement soon broke down when a local magistrate had thirty-six of his fellow rebels executed; Li&#39;s troops retaliated by killing the officials and continued to lead a rebellion based in Rongyang, central <a href="/wiki/Henan" id="w">Henan</a> province by 1635.<sup id="_ref-spence 22_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 22" title="">[99]</a></sup> By the 1640s, an ex-soldier and rival to Li—<a href="/wiki/Zhang_Xianzhong" id="w">Zhang Xianzhong</a> (1606&#8211;1647)—had created a firm rebel base in <a href="/wiki/Chengdu" id="w">Chengdu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sichuan" id="w">Sichuan</a>, while Li&#39;s center of power was in <a href="/wiki/Hubei" id="w">Hubei</a> with extended influence over Shaanxi and Henan.<sup id="_ref-spence 22_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 22" title="">[99]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1640, masses of Chinese peasants who were starving, unable to pay their taxes, and no longer in fear of the frequently defeated Chinese army, began to form into huge bands of rebels. The Chinese military, caught between fruitless efforts to defeat the Manchu raiders from the north and huge peasant revolts in the provinces, essentially fell apart. Unpaid, unfed, the army was defeated by Li Zicheng—now self-styled as the Prince of Shun—and deserted the capital without much of a fight.<sup id="_ref-spence 25_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 25" title="">[100]</a></sup> Li&#39;s forces were allowed into the city when the gates were treacherously opened from within.<sup id="_ref-spence 25_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 25" title="">[100]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/May_26" id="w">May 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1644" id="w">1644</a>, Beijing fell to a rebel army led by Li Zicheng; during the turmoil, <a href="/wiki/Chongzhen_Emperor" id="w">the last Ming emperor</a> hung himself on a tree in the imperial garden right outside the Forbidden City.<sup id="_ref-spence 25_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-spence 25" title="">[100]</a></sup></p>
<p>Seizing opportunity, the Manchus crossed the <a href="/wiki/Great_Wall" id="w">Great Wall</a> after the Ming border general <a href="/wiki/Wu_Sangui" id="w">Wu Sangui</a> (1612&#8211;1678) opened the gates at <a href="/wiki/Shanhai_Pass" id="w">Shanhai Pass</a>.

<p>Scattered Ming remnants still existed after 1644, including those of <a href="/wiki/Koxinga" id="w">Koxinga</a>. Despite the loss of Beijing and the death of the emperor, Ming power was by no means totally destroyed. Nanjing, Fujian, Guangdong, Shanxi, and Yunnan were all strongholds of Ming resistance. However, there were several pretenders for the Ming throne, and their forces were divided. Each bastion of resistance was individually defeated by the Qing until <a href="/wiki/1662" id="w">1662</a>, when the last real hopes of a Ming revival died with the Yongli emperor, <a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Gui" id="w">Zhu Youlang</a>. Despite the Ming defeat, smaller loyalist movements continued until the proclamation of the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China" id="w">Republic of China</a>.</p>
