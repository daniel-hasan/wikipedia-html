<p>Before becoming Secretary-General, Ban was a career diplomat in South Korea&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade_(South_Korea)" id="w">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> and in the United Nations.  He entered <a href="/wiki/Diplomatic_service" id="w">diplomatic service</a> the year he graduated college, accepting his first post in <a href="/wiki/New_Delhi" id="w">New Delhi</a>.

In February 2006 he began to campaign for the office of Secretary-General.  Ban was initially considered to be a long shot for the office.  As foreign minister of Korea, however, he was able to travel to all of the countries that were members of the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" id="w">United Nations Security Council</a>, a manoeuvre that turned him into the campaign&#39;s front runner.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_13" id="w">October 13</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, he was elected to be the eighth Secretary-General by the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" id="w">United Nations General Assembly</a>.  On <a href="/wiki/January_1" id="w">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, he succeeded <a href="/wiki/Kofi_Annan" id="w">Kofi Annan</a>, and passed  several major reforms regarding peacekeeping and UN employment practices.  Diplomatically, Ban has taken particularly strong views on <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" id="w">global warming</a>, pressing the issue repeatedly with U.S. President <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">George W. Bush</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Darfur_conflict" id="w">Darfur</a>, where he helped persuade Sudanese President <a href="/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir" id="w">Omar al-Bashir</a> to allow peacekeeping troops to enter <a href="/wiki/Sudan" id="w">Sudan</a>.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<a id="Childhood" name="Childhood"></a><h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>Ban, the oldest of six children, was born in <a href="/wiki/Eumseong" id="w">Eumseong</a> in a small farming village in <a href="/wiki/North_Chungcheong" id="w">North Chungcheong</a>, in 1944, while Korea was <a href="/wiki/Korea_under_Japanese_rule" id="w">controlled by Japan</a>.  When he was three, his family moved to the nearby town of <a href="/wiki/Chungju" id="w">Chungju</a>, where he was raised.<sup id="_ref-NYT 12-22_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT 12-22" title="">[1]</a></sup>  During Ban&#39;s childhood, his father had a warehouse business, but the warehouse went bankrupt and the family lost its middle-class standard of living.  When Ban was 6, his family fled to a remote mountainside for the duration of the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" id="w">Korean War</a>.<sup id="_ref-Times12-09_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Times12-09" title="">[2]</a></sup>  After the war, his family returned to Chungju.  The <a href="/wiki/Military_of_the_United_States" id="w">U.S. military</a> troops in Korea were the first Americans Ban ever met.<sup id="_ref-LAT10-09_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LAT10-09" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h3>Education</h3>
<p>In secondary school Ban became a star pupil, particularly in his studies of English.  According to local stories, Ban would regularly walk 6 miles to a fertilizer factory to practise English with the factory&#39;s American advisors.<sup id="_ref-NYT 12-22_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT 12-22" title="">[1]</a></sup>  In 1956, he was selected by his class to address a message to then UN Secretary-General <a href="/wiki/Dag_Hammarskj%C3%B6ld" id="w">Dag Hammarskj√∂ld</a>, but it is unknown if the message was ever sent.  In 1962, Ban won an essay contest sponsored by the <a href="/wiki/Red_Cross" id="w">Red Cross</a> and earned a trip to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> where he lived in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" id="w">San Francisco</a> with a host family for several months.<sup id="_ref-FT10-10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FT10-10" title="">[4]</a></sup>  As part of the trip, Ban met U.S. President <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" id="w">John F. Kennedy</a>.<sup id="_ref-Times12-09_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Times12-09" title="">[2]</a></sup>  When asked by a journalist at the meeting what Ban wanted to be when he grew up, he said &#34;I want to become a diplomat.&#34;<sup id="_ref-LAT10-09_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LAT10-09" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ban received a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor%26%2339%3Bs_degree" id="w">bachelor&#39;s degree</a> in <a href="/wiki/International_relations" id="w">International Relations</a> from <a href="/wiki/Seoul_National_University" id="w">Seoul National University</a> in 1970, and earned a <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Public_Administration" id="w">Master of Public Administration</a> from the <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_School_of_Government" id="w">John F. Kennedy School of Government</a> at <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" id="w">Harvard University</a> in 1985.<sup id="_ref-LAT10-09_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LAT10-09" title="">[3]</a></sup>  At Harvard, he studied under <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Nye" id="w">Joseph Nye</a> who remarked that Ban had &#34;a rare combination of analytic clarity, humility and perseverance.&#34;<sup id="_ref-FT10-10_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FT10-10" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to his <a href="/wiki/Curriculum_vitae" id="w">curriculum vitae</a>, in addition to his native <a href="/wiki/Korean_language" id="w">Korean</a>, Ban speaks <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> and <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>.

<a id="Family" name="Family"></a><h3>Family</h3>
<p>Ban Ki-moon met Yoo Soon-taek in 1962 when they were both high school students. Ban was 18 years old, Yoo Soon-taek was 
his secondary school&#39;s student council president, Ban Ki-moon married Yoo Soon-taek, in 1971.  They are still married and have three adult children: two daughters and a son. His eldest daughter, Seon-yong (1972-Present), works for the <a href="/wiki/Korea_Foundation" id="w">Korea Foundation</a> in Seoul.  His son, Woo-hyun (1974-Present), is a student at the University of California at Los Angeles studying for a master&#39;s degree in business administration. His youngest daughter, Hyun-hee: (1976-Present), Is a field officer for <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Children%26%2339%3Bs_Fund" id="w">UNICEF</a> in <a href="/wiki/Nairobi" id="w">Nairobi, Kenya</a>.<sup id="_ref-Times12-09_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Times12-09" title="">[2]</a></sup> After his election as Secretary-General, Ban became an icon in his home town, where his extended family still resides.  Over 50,000 gathered in a soccer stadium in Chungju for celebration of the result.  In the months after his appointment, thousands of practitioners of <a href="/wiki/Feng_shui" id="w">feng shui</a> went to his village to determine how it produced such an important person.<sup id="_ref-NYT 12-22_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT 12-22" title="">[1]</a></sup>  Ban himself is not a member of any church or religious group<sup id="_ref-Corr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Corr" title="">[6]</a></sup> and has declined  to expound upon his beliefs, telling the press &#34;Now, as Secretary-General, it will not be appropriate at this time to talk about my own belief in any particular religion or God.  So maybe we will have some other time to talk about personal matters.&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>  His mother is reportedly <a href="/wiki/Buddhist" id="w">Buddhist</a>.<sup id="_ref-NYT 12-22_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT 12-22" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Personality" name="Personality"></a><h3> Personality </h3>
<p>Ban&#39;s personality has been described by many as bland.  In the Korean Foreign Ministry his nickname was <i>Ban-chusa</i>, meaning &#34;the Bureaucrat&#34; or &#34;the administrative clerk&#34;.  The name was used as both positive and negative: complimenting Ban&#39;s attention to detail and administrative skill while deriding what was seen as a lack of charisma and subservience to his superiors.<sup id="_ref-Economist10-07_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Economist10-07" title="">[8]</a></sup>  The Korean press corps calls him &#34;the slippery eel&#34; for his ability to dodge questions.<sup id="_ref-LAT10-09_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LAT10-09" title="">[3]</a></sup>  His demeanor has also been described as a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Confucian" id="w">Confucian</a> approach&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Time_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Time" title="">[9]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Ban&#39;s work ethic is well-documented.  His schedule is reportedly broken into five-minute blocks; Ban claims to sleep for only five hours a night and never to have been late for work.  During the nearly three years he was foreign minister for South Korea the only vacation he took was for his daughter&#39;s wedding.<sup id="_ref-FT10-10_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FT10-10" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Ban has said that his only hobby is golf, and he plays only a couple of games a year.<sup id="_ref-Times12-09_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Times12-09" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the 2006 UN Correspondents&#39; dinner in early December, after being elected Secretary-General, Ban surprised the audience by singing a version of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Santa_Claus_Is_Coming_to_Town" id="w">Santa Claus Is Coming to Town</a>&#34;, with the lyrics &#34;Ban Ki-moon is coming to town&#34; instead.<sup id="_ref-WashBolton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WashBolton" title="">[10]</a></sup>  A major aim of Ban&#39;s campaign for UN Secretary-General and a focus of his early days in office was allaying concerns that he was too dull for the job.<sup id="_ref-FT02-01_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FT02-01" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>His first overseas posting was to <a href="/wiki/New_Delhi" id="w">New Delhi</a> where he served as vice consul and impressed many of his superiors in the foreign ministry with his competence.  Ban reportedly accepted a posting to India rather than the more prestigious United States, because in <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> he would be able to save more money, and send more home to his family.<sup id="_ref-BBCprofile_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBCprofile" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-KH_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KH" title="">[13]</a></sup> In 1974 he received his first posting to the United Nations, as First Secretary of the South Permanent Observer Mission (South Korea only became a full UN member state on <a href="/wiki/September_17" id="w">September 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a>).<sup id="_ref-NYT10-03_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT10-03" title="">[14]</a></sup>  After <a href="/wiki/Park_Chung_Hee" id="w">Park Chung Hee</a>&#39;s 1979 assassination, Ban assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division.</p>

In 1992, he became Vice Chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, following the adoption by South and <a href="/wiki/Democratic_People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_Korea_(North_Korea)" id="w">North Korea</a> of the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the <a href="/wiki/Korean_Peninsula" id="w">Korean Peninsula</a>.<sup id="_ref-BBCprofile_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBCprofile" title="">[12]</a></sup>  From 1993&#8211;94 Ban was Korea&#39;s deputy ambassador to the United States.  He was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and International Organizations in 1995 and then appointed National Security Advisor to the President in 1996.<sup id="_ref-KH_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KH" title="">[13]</a></sup>  Ban&#39;s lengthy career overseas has been credited with helping him avoid South Korea&#39;s unforgiving political environment.<sup id="_ref-Time_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Time" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

During the negotiations, in what Ban considers the biggest blunder of his career, he included a positive statement about the <a href="/wiki/Anti-Ballistic_Missile_Treaty" id="w">Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty</a> in a public letter with <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a> in 2001, shortly after the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> had decided to abandon the treaty.  To avoid anger from the United States, Ban was fired by President <a href="/wiki/Kim_Dae-jung" id="w">Kim Dae-jung</a>, who also issued a public apology for Ban&#39;s statement.<sup id="_ref-Times12-09_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Times12-09" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

But Ban also opposed several U.S. positions: he expressed his support for the <a href="/wiki/International_Criminal_Court" id="w">International Criminal Court</a> and favored an entirely non-confrontational approach to dealing with North Korea.<sup id="_ref-LAT10-09_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LAT10-09" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Ban said during his campaign that he would like to visit North Korea in person to meet with <a href="/wiki/Kim_Jong_Il" id="w">Kim Jong Il</a> directly.<sup id="_ref-Newsweek_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Newsweek" title="">[17]</a></sup>  Ban was viewed as a stark contrast from Kofi Annan, who was considered charismatic, but perceived as a weak manager because of problems surrounding the UN&#39;s oil-for-food program in Iraq.<sup id="_ref-Economist10-07_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Economist10-07" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ban also struggled to win the approval of France.  His official biography states that he speaks both <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> and <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>, the two working languages of the UN Secretariat. He has repeatedly struggled to answer questions in French from journalists.<sup id="_ref-Phoney_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Phoney" title="">[5]</a></sup> Ban has repeatedly acknowledged his limitations at French, but assured French diplomats that he was devoted to continuing his study.  At a press conference on <a href="/wiki/January_11" id="w">January 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, Ban remarked, ‚Äúmy French perhaps could be improved, and I am continuing to work.

<p>As the Secretary-General election drew closer there was rising criticism of the South Korean campaign on Ban&#39;s behalf. Specifically, his alleged practice of systematically visiting all member states of the Security Council in his role as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade to secure votes in his support by signing trade deals with European countries and pledging <a href="/wiki/Foreign_aid" id="w">foreign aid</a> to <a href="/wiki/Developing_countries" id="w">developing countries</a> were the focus of many news articles.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>  According to the <i><a href="/wiki/Washington_Post" id="w">Washington Post</a>,</i> &#34;rivals have privately grumbled that Republic of Korea, which has the world&#39;s 11th-largest economy, has wielded its economic might to generate support for his candidacy&#34;. Ban reportedly has said that these insinuations are &#34;groundless&#34;. In an interview on <a href="/wiki/17_September" id="w">17 September</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> he stated: &#34;As front-runner, I know that I can become a target of this very scrutinizing process,&#34; and &#34;I am a man of integrity.&#34;<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the final informal poll on <a href="/wiki/October_2" id="w">October 2</a>, Ban received fourteen favorable votes and one abstention (&#34;no opinion&#34;) from the fifteen members of the Security Council (the polls were secret, and it is unknown which country abstained).  More importantly, Ban was the only one to escape a veto; each of the other candidates received at least one &#34;no&#34; vote from among the five permanent members.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>  After the vote, <a href="/wiki/Shashi_Tharoor" id="w">Shashi Tharoor</a>, who finished second, withdrew his candidacy<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/China" id="w">China&#39;s</a> <a href="/wiki/Permanent_Representative" id="w">Permanent Representative</a> to the UN told reporters that &#34;it is quite clear from today&#39;s straw poll that Minister Ban Ki-moon is the candidate that the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly.&#34;<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

When Ban became Secretary-General, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Economist" id="w">The Economist</a></i> listed the major challenges facing him in 2007: &#34;rising nuclear demons in <a href="/wiki/Iran" id="w">Iran</a> and North Korea, a haemorrhaging wound in <a href="/wiki/Darfur" id="w">Darfur</a>, unending violence in the Middle East, looming environmental disaster, escalating international terrorism, the proliferation of <a href="/wiki/Weapons_of_mass_destruction" id="w">weapons of mass destruction</a>, the spread of HIV/AIDS.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/January_1" id="w">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> Ban took office as the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations.  Ban&#39;s term as Secretary-General opened with a flap.  At his first encounter with the press as Secretary-General on <a href="/wiki/2_January" id="w">2 January</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, he refused to condemn the <a href="/wiki/Death_penalty" id="w">death penalty</a> imposed on <a href="/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" id="w">Saddam Hussein</a> by the Iraqi High Tribunal, remarking that ‚ÄúThe issue of capital punishment is for each and every member State to decide.‚Äù <sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup>  Ban&#39;s statements contradicted long-standing United Nations opposition to the death penalty as a human rights concern.<sup id="_ref-NYT01-03_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT01-03" title="">[37]</a></sup>  He quickly clarified his stance in the case of <a href="/wiki/Barzan_al-Tikriti" id="w">Barzan al-Tikriti</a> and <a href="/wiki/Awad_al-Bandar" id="w">Awad al-Bandar</a>, two top officials who were convicted of the deaths of 148 <a href="/wiki/Shia_Islam" id="w">Shia Muslims</a> in the Iraqi village of <a href="/wiki/Dujail" id="w">Dujail</a> in the <a href="/wiki/1980s" id="w">1980s</a>.

<a id="Cabinet" name="Cabinet"></a><h3>Cabinet</h3>
<p>In early January, Ban appointed the key members of his cabinet.  As his <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Deputy_Secretary-General" id="w">Deputy Secretary-General</a> he selected <a href="/wiki/Tanzania" id="w">Tanzanian</a> foreign minister and professor <a href="/wiki/Asha-Rose_Migiro" id="w">Asha-Rose Migiro</a>, a move that pleased African diplomats who had concerns of losing power without Annan in office.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>The top position devoted exclusively to management, Under-Secretary-General for Management, was filled by <a href="/wiki/Alicia_B%C3%A1rcena_Ibarra" id="w">Alicia B√°rcena Ibarra</a>.  Ibarra was considered a UN insider, having previously served as Annan&#39;s chief of staff. Her appointment was seen by critics as an indication that Ban would not make dramatic changes to UN bureaucracy.<sup id="_ref-NYT01-04_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT01-04" title="">[41]</a></sup>  Ban appointed <a href="/wiki/John_Holmes_(British_diplomat)" id="w">Sir John Holmes</a>, the British Ambassador to France, as <a href="/wiki/Under-Secretary-General_for_Humanitarian_Affairs_and_Emergency_Relief_Coordinator" id="w">Under-Secretary-General for humanitarian affairs and coordinator of emergency relief</a>.<sup id="_ref-NYT01-04_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT01-04" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ban initially said that he would delay making other appointments until his first round of reforms were approved, but he later abandoned this idea after receiving criticism.<sup id="_ref-NYT02-06_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT02-06" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-FT02-01_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FT02-01" title="">[11]</a></sup>  In February he continued with appointments, selecting <a href="/wiki/B._Lynn_Pascoe" id="w">B. Lynn Pascoe</a>, the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, to become Under-Secretary-General for political affairs.
<a href="/wiki/Jean-Marie_Gu%C3%A9henno" id="w">Jean-Marie Gu√©henno</a>, a French diplomat, who had served as Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping operations under Annan remained in office.  Ban selected <a href="/wiki/Vijay_K._Nambiar" id="w">Vijay K. Nambiar</a> as his chief of staff.<sup id="_ref-NYT02-10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT02-10" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>The appointment of many women to top jobs was seen as fulfilling a campaign promise Ban had made to increase the role of women in the United Nations.  During Ban&#39;s first year as Secretary-General more top jobs were being handled by women than ever before.  Though not appointed by Ban, the president of the General Assembly, <a href="/wiki/Haya_Rashed_Al-Khalifa" id="w">Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa</a>, is only the third woman to hold this position in UN history.<sup id="_ref-CT04-11_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CT04-11" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Early_reforms" name="Early_reforms"></a><h3>Early reforms</h3>
<p>During his first month in office, Ban proposed two major restructurings: to split the UN peacekeeping operation into two departments and to combine the political affairs and disarmament department.  His proposals were met with stiff resistance from members of the UN General Assembly, who bristled under Ban&#39;s request for rapid approval.  The proposed merger of the disarmament and political affairs offices was criticized by many in the developing world, partially because of rumors that Ban hoped to place American B. Lynn Pascoe in charge of the new office.  <a href="/wiki/Alejandro_D._Wolff" id="w">Alejandro D. Wolff</a>, then acting American ambassador, said the United States backed his proposals.<sup id="_ref-FT02-01_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FT02-01" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NYT02-06_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT02-06" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the early bout of reproach, Ban began extensive consultation with UN ambassadors, agreeing to have his peacekeeping proposal extensively vetted.  After the consultations, Ban dropped his proposal to combine political affairs and disarmament.<sup id="_ref-NYT02-19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT02-19" title="">[45]</a></sup>  Ban nevertheless pressed ahead with reforms on job requirements at the UN  requiring that all positions be considered five-year appointments, all receive strict annual performance reviews, and all financial disclosures be made public.  Though unpopular in the New York office, the move was popular in other UN offices around the world and lauded by UN observers.<sup id="_ref-NYT02-28_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT02-28" title="">[46]</a></sup>  Ban&#39;s proposal to split the peacekeeping operation into one group handling operations and another handling arms was finally adopted in mid-March 2007.<sup id="_ref-IrishTimes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IrishTimes" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ban has used his position to push South Korea to pay its bills on time and to lend attack helicopters for a peacekeeping mission in <a href="/wiki/Darfur" id="w">Darfur</a>.</p>
<a id="Key_issues" name="Key_issues"></a><h3>Key issues</h3>
<p>The Secretary-General of the United Nations has the ability to influence debate on nearly any global issue.  Although unsuccessful in some areas, Ban&#39;s predecessor Annan had been successful in increasing the UN peacekeeping presence and in popularizing the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" id="w">Millennium Development Goals</a>.  UN observers were eager to see on which issues Ban intends to focus, in addition to reform of the United Nations bureaucracy.<sup id="_ref-Econ01-06_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Econ01-06" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>On several prominent issues, such as proliferation in Iran and North Korea, Ban has deferred to the Security Council.<sup id="_ref-IrishTimes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IrishTimes" title="">[47]</a></sup>  Ban has also declined to become involved on the issue of <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Taiwan</a>&#39;s status.  In 2007, the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Nauru" id="w">Republic of Nauru</a> raised the issue of allowing the Republic of China (Taiwan) to sign the <a href="/wiki/Convention_on_the_Elimination_of_All_Forms_of_Discrimination_Against_Women" id="w">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women</a>.  Ban incorrectly referenced the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_2758" id="w">United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758</a>, and refused the motion.  On <a href="/wiki/July_19" id="w">July 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, the President of the Republic of China wrote to request admission into the UN by the name Taiwan.

<a id="Criticism" name="Criticism"></a><h2> Criticism </h2>
<p>Some U.N. employees and delegates are expressing their resentment at Ban&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Favoritism" id="w">favoritism</a> in the appointment of his fellow South Korean nationals in key posts. Previous U.N. chiefs such as <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Waldheim" id="w">Kurt Waldheim</a> (Austria), <a href="/wiki/Javier_Perez_de_Cuellar" id="w">Javier Perez de Cuellar</a> (Peru) and <a href="/wiki/Boutros_Boutros-Ghali" id="w">Boutros Boutros-Ghali</a> (Egypt) brought small teams of trusted aides or clerical workers from their country&#39;s Foreign Ministry. According to some officials, Ban has gone further, boosting South Korea&#39;s presence in U.N. ranks by more than 20 percent in the past year. In response, Ban and his aides claimed that allegations of favoritism are wrong, and that some of the harshest criticisms against him have undercurrents of <a href="/wiki/Racism" id="w">racism</a>. He said that the South Korean nationals he had appointed -- including Choi Young-jin, who has served as a high-ranking official in the United Nation&#39;s peacekeeping department -- are highly qualified for their positions.<sup id="_ref-fav_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fav" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
