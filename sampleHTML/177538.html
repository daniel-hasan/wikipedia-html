<p>The club was a <a href="/wiki/Cricket" id="w">cricket</a> team when it formed in <a href="/wiki/1820s_in_sports" id="w">1820</a> as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wednesday_Cricket_Club" id="w">The Wednesday Cricket Club</a></i> (named after the <a href="/wiki/Day_of_the_week" id="w">day of the week</a> when they played their matches). A meeting on the evening of Wednesday <a href="/wiki/4_September" id="w">4 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1867" id="w">1867</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Adelphi_Hotel" id="w">Adelphi Hotel</a> established a footballing side to keep the team together and fit during the winter months. They played their first match against the Mechanics on <a href="/wiki/19_October" id="w">19 October</a> the same year.<sup id="_ref-Sheffield Football_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sheffield Football" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

It soon became apparent that football would come to eclipse the cricketing side of the club. On <a href="/wiki/1_February" id="w">1 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1868" id="w">1868</a>, Wednesday played their first competitive football match as they entered the <a href="/wiki/Cromwell_Cup" id="w">Cromwell Cup</a>, a four-team competition for newly formed clubs. They went on to win the cup, beating the Garrick Club 1-0 after extra time in the final at <a href="/wiki/Bramall_Lane" id="w">Bramall Lane</a>.<sup id="_ref-Cromwell Cup_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cromwell Cup" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Charles_Clegg_(footballer)" id="w">Charles Clegg</a> joined Wednesday in the 1870s, starting a relationship that would last the rest of his life and eventually lead to his becoming the club&#39;s chairman. He also became president and chairman of the <a href="/wiki/The_Football_Association" id="w">Football Association</a> and known as the &#34;Napoleon of Football&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Statto_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Statto" title="">[3]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/1876_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1876</a> they acquired Scot <a href="/wiki/James_Lang_(footballer)" id="w">James Lang</a>. Although he was not employed by the club, he was given a job by a member of the Sheffield Wednesday board that had no formal duties. He is now acknowledged as the first professional football player in England.<sup id="_ref-In the Beginning_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-In the Beginning" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 1880s saw two major events that radically changed the face of the club. In <a href="/wiki/1882_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1882</a> the cricket and football clubs parted ways;<sup id="_ref-Wednesday!_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wednesday!" title="">[5]</a></sup> the cricket club would later go out of existence in 1925. The football club turned professional in <a href="/wiki/1887_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1887</a> after pressure from players threatening to defect to other clubs. Sheffield Wednesday won their first game as a professional club against the Mechanics by 3 goals to nil.</p>
<a id="Professional_football" name="Professional_football"></a><h3>Professional football</h3>
<p>The move to professionalism took the team from <a href="/wiki/Bramall_Lane" id="w">Bramall Lane</a>, which had taken a share of the ticket revenue, to the new <a href="/wiki/Olive_Grove" id="w">Olive Grove</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1889_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1889</a> the club became founder members of the <a href="/wiki/Football_Alliance" id="w">Football Alliance</a>, of which they were the first champions in a season where they also reached the <a href="/wiki/1890_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1890</a> <a href="/wiki/FA_Cup" id="w">FA Cup</a> Final, losing 6-1 to <a href="/wiki/Blackburn_Rovers" id="w">Blackburn Rovers</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Kennington_Oval" id="w">Kennington Oval</a>. Despite finishing the following season bottom of the Alliance, they were eventually elected to the expanded <a href="/wiki/Football_League" id="w">Football League</a> in <a href="/wiki/1892_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1892</a>. They won the FA Cup for the first time in <a href="/wiki/1896_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1896</a>, beating <a href="/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers" id="w">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> 2-1 at <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Palace_National_Sports_Centre" id="w">Crystal Palace</a>.</p>
<p>Due to an expansion of the local railway lines, the club were told that they would have to find a new ground for the <a href="/wiki/1899-1900_in_English_football" id="w">1899–1900 season</a>. After a difficult search the club finally bought some land in the village of Owlerton, which at the time was several miles outside the city boundaries. Construction of a new stadium (now known as <a href="/wiki/Hillsborough_Stadium" id="w">Hillsborough Stadium</a>) was completed within months and the club was secured for the next century. In a strong decade Wednesday won the league twice in the <a href="/wiki/1902-03_in_English_football" id="w">1902–03</a> and <a href="/wiki/1903-04_in_English_football" id="w">1903–04</a> seasons and the FA Cup again in <a href="/wiki/1907_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1907</a>, beating <a href="/wiki/Everton_F.C." id="w">Everton</a>, again at Crystal Palace by 2 goals to 1. After this the club went through a relatively fallow period for another two decades.</p>
<p>The team were almost relegated in the <a href="/wiki/1928-29_in_English_football" id="w">1928–29</a> season, but with 17 points in the last 10 matches they pulled off a great escape, rising from bottom to 14th. Wednesday went on to win the league title the following season (<a href="/wiki/1929-30_in_English_football" id="w">1929–30</a>), which started a run that would see the team finishing lower than third only once until 1936. The period was topped off with the team winning the FA Cup for the third time in the club&#39;s history in <a href="/wiki/1935_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1935</a>.</p>
<a id="Post-war_turmoil" name="Post-war_turmoil"></a><h3>Post-war turmoil</h3>
<p>The 1950s saw Wednesday unable to consistently hold on to a position in the top flight. After being promoted back up in <a href="/wiki/1950_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1950</a>, they were relegated three times, although each time they bounced back up by winning the <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Second_Division" id="w">Second Division</a> the following season. The decade ended on a high note with the team finally finishing in the top half of the First Division for the first time since <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>This led to a decade of successfully remaining in the First Division, which included a run to the FA Cup Final in <a href="/wiki/1966_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1966</a> – notable in that Wednesday played all their ties away from home. Off the field the club was embroiled in the <a href="/wiki/British_betting_scandal_of_1964" id="w">British betting scandal of 1964</a> where three of their players, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Swan" id="w">Peter Swan</a>, <a href="/wiki/David_Layne" id="w">David Layne</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tony_Kay" id="w">Tony Kay</a>, were accused of <a href="/wiki/Match_fixing" id="w">match fixing</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sports_betting" id="w">betting</a> against their own team in an away game at Ipswich Town. The three were subsequently convicted and, on release from prison, banned from football for life.<sup id="_ref-Betting Scandal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Betting Scandal" title="">[6]</a></sup> The three were reprieved in the early 1970s with Swan and Layne returning to Hillsborough and though their careers were virtually over Swan at least played some league games for the Owls.</p>
<p>Wednesday were relegated at the end of the <a href="/wiki/1969-70_in_English_football" id="w">1969–70 season</a>, starting the darkest period in the club&#39;s history. After going into free-fall they dropped to the <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Third_Division" id="w">Third Division</a> for the first time in their history and were marooned there for five seasons. The club were almost relegated to the <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Fourth_Division" id="w">Fourth Division</a> in <a href="/wiki/1976_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1976</a>, but a revival under the management of <a href="/wiki/Jack_Charlton" id="w">Jack Charlton</a>, and the aid of Coach <a href="/wiki/Tony_Toms" id="w">Tony Toms</a> saw them return to the First Division in <a href="/wiki/1984_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1984</a>.</p>
<a id="Modern_highs_and_lows" name="Modern_highs_and_lows"></a><h3>Modern highs and lows</h3>
<p>Sheffield Wednesday spent the majority of the 1980s and 1990s in the top tier of English football. <a href="/wiki/1990-91_in_English_football" id="w">1990–91</a> was the only season out of sixteen in a row that Wednesday spent in a lower division, but the season is best remembered by fans for Wednesday&#39;s swift return to the top flight under the management of Ron Atkinson and their <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Cup" id="w">League Cup</a> victory over <a href="/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C." id="w">Manchester United</a> to win their first major trophy for over 50 years. The <a href="/wiki/1992-93_in_English_football" id="w">1992–93</a> season established Sheffield Wednesday as a top club as they visited <a href="/wiki/Wembley_Stadium_(1924)" id="w">Wembley</a> four times during the season - a League Cup final and an FA Cup semi-final, final and replay. In the FA Cup Semi-Finals they recorded a historic win over the city rivals Sheffield United, 2-1. However Wednesday failed to win any silverware, losing to Arsenal in both League and FA Cup finals, the latter after <a href="/wiki/Andy_Linighan" id="w">Andy Linighan</a>&#39;s late extra-time winner in the replay to give Arsenal the victory.</p>

<p>Wednesday&#39;s fortunes took a turn for the worse when a succession of managers failed to maintain this form, first <a href="/wiki/David_Pleat" id="w">David Pleat</a> and later <a href="/wiki/Danny_Wilson_(footballer)" id="w">Danny Wilson</a> spent small fortunes building squads that were ultimately ineffective, and the club&#39;s debts got out of control as a result.<sup id="_ref-guardian fanzine_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-guardian fanzine" title="">[7]</a></sup> Danny Wilson was sacked in March 2000 and his assistant <a href="/wiki/Peter_Shreeves" id="w">Peter Shreeves</a> took temporary charge but was unable to stave off relegation. The club&#39;s flirtation with relegation continued in Division One and after yet more managerial changes <a href="/wiki/Chris_Turner_(footballer_b._1958)" id="w">Chris Turner</a> was hired as boss and made a strong effort to rejuvenate the side. However, a failure to beat <a href="/wiki/Brighton_%26amp%3B_Hove_Albion_F.C." id="w">Brighton &#38; Hove Albion F.C.</a> in the penultimate game of the <a href="/wiki/2002-03_in_English_football" id="w">2002–03</a> season condemned them to another relegation.</p>
<p>After narrowly avoiding yet another relegation in <a href="/wiki/2003-04_in_English_football" id="w">2003–04</a> and a poor start to the <a href="/wiki/2004-05_in_English_football" id="w">2004–05</a> <a href="/wiki/Coca-Cola_League_One" id="w">Coca-Cola League One</a> campaign, Turner was replaced by former <a href="/wiki/Southampton_F.C." id="w">Southampton F.C.</a> manager <a href="/wiki/Paul_Sturrock" id="w">Paul Sturrock</a>.

</p>
<p>Sheffield Wednesday are the only English League club with a day of the week in their name.</p>
<p>The club was initially a cricket team named The Wednesday Cricket Club after the day of the week when they played their matches. The footballing side of the club was established to keep the team together and fit during the winter months.</p>
<p>The club were formerly known as &#34;The Wednesday Football Club&#34; until <a href="/wiki/1929_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1929</a>, when the club was officially renamed &#34;Sheffield Wednesday Football Club&#34; under the stewardship of manager <a href="/wiki/Bob_Brown_(footballer)" id="w">Bob Brown</a>.<sup id="_ref-Complete History 1920-35_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Complete History 1920-35" title="">[11]</a></sup> However the name Sheffield Wednesday dates back as far as <a href="/wiki/1883_in_football_(soccer)" id="w">1883</a>: the former ground at Olive Grove had the name Sheffield Wednesday painted on the stand roof.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#39;s original nickname was &#34;The Blades&#34;, a common name for Sheffield clubs during the 19th century due to the city&#39;s links to the cutlery industry and now the nickname of their long-term rivals <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C." id="w">Sheffield United</a>. At the start of the 20th century, when a player presented them with an <a href="/wiki/Owl" id="w">owl</a> mascot to honour their stadium at Owlerton, adjacent to <a href="/wiki/Hillsborough%2C_South_Yorkshire" id="w">Hillsborough</a>, the club became known as &#34;The Owls&#34;.</p>
<a id="Colours" name="Colours"></a><h2>Colours</h2>
<p>Since its founding the club has played their home games in blue and white shirts, traditionally in vertical stripes. However this has not always been the case and there have been variations upon the theme. A monochrome photograph from 1874–75 shows the Wednesday team in plain dark shirts,<sup id="_ref-Romance of the Wednesday_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Romance of the Wednesday" title="">[12]</a></sup> while the 1871 &#34;Rules of the Sheffield Football Association&#34; listed the Wednesday club colours as blue and white hoops.<sup id="_ref-Football in Sheffield_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Football in Sheffield" title="">[13]</a></sup> A quartered blue and white design was used in 1887 and a blue shirt with white sleeves between 1965 and 1973.<sup id="_ref-Club Colours_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Club Colours" title="">[14]</a></sup> This design would have received greater notoriety had Wednesday not worn their <a href="/wiki/Kit_(football)" id="w">away kit</a> for all of their games in the 1966 FA Cup run, when all of their ties were drawn away. Given the option in the final of wearing their first strip, they chose the away strip for luck; but Everton managed to claw back a 2-0 deficit after 54 minutes and eventually won the game 3-2.</p>
<p>There is a superstition among many older Wednesday fans that the team tends to have a poor season when they abandon the traditional evenly spaced blue and white stripe designs in favour of some broad stripe or narrow stripe design. However in an age of marketing-driven decisions, the team only reverts to the familiar style every so often.</p>
<p>Wednesday have often favoured black shorts or, more recently, blue. There have been times where Wednesday have opted to play in white shorts, sometimes to minimise colour clashes with the opposing team. The socks were invariably blue and white hoops but these too have gone through changes including blue with a white roll over top, all blue and all white.</p>
<p>The away strip has changed regularly over the years although an all yellow strip has been used for many of the recent seasons in the club&#39;s history. Traditionally white was the second choice for many teams, including Wednesday. Other colours used for away kits in previous years include black, silver, green and orange. Wednesday have always avoided red as an alternative colour but for years had the players&#39; numbers in red on the first-choice shirt backs, which was not easy to discern against blue and white stripes.</p>
<p>The 2007/08 kit is manufactured by <a href="/wiki/Lotto_Sport_Italia" id="w">Lotto</a> with the home colours the traditional shirt of blue and white stripes, with blue sleeves, coupled with black shorts and socks (with the top of the socks blue).<sup id="_ref-Sheffield Wednesday 2007/08 Kit_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sheffield Wednesday 2007/08 Kit" title="">[15]</a></sup> The club&#39;s supporters were given the chance to have input on the away kit selection and went for an orange shirt, shorts and socks with some blue piping instead of a green or white shirt.</p>

<p>Originally, Wednesday played matches at High Field, where <a href="/wiki/Highfield_Library" id="w">Highfield Library</a> is now located but moved several times before adopting a permanent ground. Other locations included <a href="/wiki/Heeley" id="w">Heeley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hunter%26%2339%3Bs_Bar" id="w">Hunter&#39;s Bar</a>.

<p>Sheffield Wednesday&#39;s first permanent home ground was at <a href="/wiki/Olive_Grove" id="w">Olive Grove</a>, a site on Queen&#39;s Road originally leased from the <a href="/wiki/Henry_Fitzalan-Howard%2C_15th_Duke_of_Norfolk" id="w">Duke of Norfolk</a>.

Extensions to the adjacent railway forced the club to move in 1899, when work began on <a href="/wiki/Hillsborough_Stadium" id="w">Hillsborough Stadium</a> at Owlerton, to the northwest of the city. The first game at Hillsborough was played on <a href="/wiki/2_September" id="w">2 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1899" id="w">1899</a> and ended in a 5-1 win for Wednesday over <a href="/wiki/Chesterfield_F.C." id="w">Chesterfield</a>.

Another famous Wednesday institution was the Wednesday Band, a <a href="/wiki/Brass_band" id="w">brass band</a> that played during matches. Although unpopular amongst many rival fans (and some home fans),<sup id="_ref-ground guide_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ground guide" title="">[23]</a></sup> they have released several records and have been invited to regularly attend <a href="/wiki/England_national_football_team" id="w">England</a> matches.<sup id="_ref-Unofficial history_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Unofficial history" title="">[24]</a></sup> They were often banned from away grounds and have now suffered the same fate at home.</p>

<p>Sheffield Wednesday have had a large variety of fanzines over the years; examples include <i>Just Another Wednesday</i>, <i>Out of the Blue</i>, <i>Spitting Feathers</i>, <i>Boddle</i>, <i>A View From The East Bank</i>, <i>Cheat!</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Monster_Trucks" id="w">War of the Monster Trucks</a></i>, which acquired its name from the programme that <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire_Television" id="w">Yorkshire Television</a> elected to show instead of the celebrations after the 1991 <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Cup" id="w">League Cup</a> victory over Manchester United.<sup id="_ref-About WOTMT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-About WOTMT" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<p>Wednesday&#39;s main rivals are city neighbours <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C." id="w">Sheffield United</a>. Other rivals include <a href="/wiki/Rotherham_United_F.C." id="w">Rotherham United</a>, <a href="/wiki/Barnsley_F.C." id="w">Barnsley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C." id="w">Leeds United</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="/wiki/Chesterfield_F.C." id="w">Chesterfield</a>, <a href="/wiki/Doncaster_Rovers_F.C." id="w">Doncaster Rovers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hull_City_F.C." id="w">Hull City</a>.  Matches between Wednesday and United are nicknamed <a href="/wiki/Steel_City_derby" id="w">Steel City derbies</a> (as opposed to Sheffield derbies, which can be between any two Sheffield teams) and are usually the highlight of the season for both sets of fans. Famous matches include <i>The Boxing Day Massacre</i>, a <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Third_Division" id="w">Football League Third Division</a> match which took place at <a href="/wiki/Hillsborough_Stadium" id="w">Hillsborough</a> on <a href="/wiki/26_December" id="w">26 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1979" id="w">1979</a>. A record Third Division crowd of 49,309 fans watched Wednesday beat United 4-0 and the game has become part of Sheffield Wednesday folklore, even inspiring a song.<sup id="_ref-ground guide_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ground guide" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>The two teams also met at <a href="/wiki/Wembley_Stadium_(1924)" id="w">Wembley</a> for an <a href="/wiki/FA_Cup" id="w">FA Cup</a> semi-final match on <a href="/wiki/3_April" id="w">3 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1993" id="w">1993</a>. The match was scheduled to take place at <a href="/wiki/Elland_Road" id="w">Elland Road</a> but due to pressure from fans and the sheer number of supporters wishing to see the game <a href="/wiki/The_Football_Association" id="w">the Football Association</a> decided to switch the game to Wembley and 75,365 fans made the trip down to <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> to watch the match. Wednesday took the lead through a spectacular <a href="/wiki/Chris_Waddle" id="w">Chris Waddle</a> free kick before United forced extra time courtesy of a goal from veteran striker <a href="/wiki/Alan_Cork" id="w">Alan Cork</a>, despite Wednesday completely dominating the game. <a href="/wiki/Mark_Bright" id="w">Mark Bright</a> eventually scored the goal that secured victory for Wednesday and earned the Owls bragging rights until the next meeting.<sup id="_ref-Derby_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Derby" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sheffield United have a better head to head record in <a href="/wiki/Steel_City_Derby" id="w">Steel City Derby</a> games, having beaten Wednesday 44 times. Of the last 10 encounters, Wednesday have won just 2 games against their rivals.</p>

<p>Since their move to Owlerton, the owl has become a theme that has run throughout the club. The original club crest was introduced in 1956<sup id="_ref-crest_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-crest" title="">[27]</a></sup>and consisted of a shield showing a traditionally drawn owl perched on a branch. The <a href="/wiki/White_Rose_of_York" id="w">White Rose of York</a><sup id="_ref-olderbadge_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-olderbadge" title="">[28]</a></sup> was depicted below the branch alluding to the home county of <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire" id="w">Yorkshire</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Sheaf" id="w">sheaves</a> of Sheffield <i>(Sheaf field)</i> were shown at either side of the owl&#39;s head. The club&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> motto, <i>Consilio et Animis</i>, was displayed beneath the shield.<sup id="_ref-crest_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-crest" title="">[27]</a></sup> This translates into English as &#34;By Wisdom and Courage&#34;.<sup id="_ref-motto_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-motto" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">The minimalist crest</div></div>
</p>
<p>The crest was changed in 1970 to a minimalist version that shows a stylised owl with a large round head and eyes perched on the letters <i>S.W.F.C.</i> Various different colours were used on this badge, regularly changing with the kit design. The predominant colours however were black and yellow. This version remained in use throughout the 1970s and 1980s before being replaced in 1995.<sup id="_ref-badge_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-badge" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>The new crest reverted to a similar design to the original crest. It again featured a traditionally drawn owl perched on a branch although the design of both had changed. The sheaves were replaced by a stylised &#39;SWFC&#39; logo that had been in use on club merchandise for several years prior to the introduction of the new crest. The Yorkshire Rose was moved to above the owl&#39;s head to make way for the words &#39;Sheffield Wednesday&#39;. The word &#39;Hillsborough&#39; was also curved around the top of the design. The club motto was absent on the new design. The crest was encased in a new shape of shield. This crest remained in use for only a few years, during which several versions were used with different colouration including a white crest with blue stripes down either side and the colouring of the detail inverted. Most recently the shield shape has remained but the detailed owl logo has been replaced, yet again, by the minimalist version, echoing the badge&#39;s course of history in the 70s. The most recent change was the addition of a <a href="/wiki/Copyright_symbol" id="w">copyright symbol</a> in 2002.<sup id="_ref-crest_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-crest" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
