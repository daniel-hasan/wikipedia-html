<b>Straffan</b> (<i>Teach Srafáin</i> in <a href="/wiki/Irish_language" id="w">Irish</a>) is a village in <a href="/wiki/County_Kildare" id="w">County Kildare</a>, <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a> situated on the banks of the <a href="/wiki/River_Liffey" id="w">River Liffey</a>, 25 km upstream of the Irish capital <a href="/wiki/Dublin" id="w">Dublin</a>. </p>
<p>With a population, according to the census of 2006, of 439 &#8211; an increase since 2002 of 32.2% &#8211; Straffan is the 31st most populous centre in County Kildare.</p>
<p>Straffan is also an electoral division within <a href="/wiki/Celbridge" id="w">Celbridge</a> Number 1 rural area. At one time a separate <a href="/wiki/Parish" id="w">parish</a>, it is joined to the parish of Celbridge (RC) and Celbridge and Newcastle (CofI) in the Diocese of Dublin.</p>
<p>Straffan is home to the Kildare Country Club, commonly known as the <a href="/wiki/K_Club" id="w">K Club</a>, and its two championship courses which have staged major international events such as the <a href="/wiki/European_Open" id="w">European Open</a> (annually since <a href="/wiki/1995" id="w">1995</a>), and the <a href="/wiki/Ryder_Cup" id="w">Ryder Cup</a> tournament between Europe and the USA in <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>.</p>
<a id="Contemporary_Village" name="Contemporary_Village"></a><h1>Contemporary Village</h1>
<p>The contemporary village is concentrated around two crossroads on which are situated a <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic</a> church and <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Ireland" id="w">Church of Ireland</a> respectively. Development evolved through the building of estate houses (<a href="/wiki/1880" id="w">1880</a>), land commission cottages (<a href="/wiki/1922" id="w">1922</a>-39), the Murray local authority cottages (<a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a>), and five estates around the village, Lodge Park (<a href="/wiki/1970" id="w">1970</a>), Coarse Moor (<a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a>), The Glebe (<a href="/wiki/1985" id="w">1985</a>), The Beeches (<a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>) and Barton Grange (<a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>). This is set to increase in pace in the coming years when large housing estates are developed on two allotments to the north of the village. Four developments also took place on the grounds of the K Club in the <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a>-04 period, Ryder Cup Village, the Courtyard, Churchfields and Ladycastle. A planning application has been lodged with <a href="/wiki/Kildare_County_Council" id="w">Kildare County Council</a> (2007) to develop a separate town to the south west at <a href="/wiki/Turnings%2C_County_Kildare" id="w">Turnings</a>.</p>
<a id="Location" name="Location"></a><h1>Location</h1>
<p>Straffan is situated at a particularly low lying point in the Liffey valley and is surrounded by flood meadows along the Liffey and River Morell. Agriculture is important to the local economy. Since the <a href="/wiki/1700s" id="w">1700s</a> Straffan farmers have been prominent improving agriculturalists and prominent in the prize lists at events run by the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Dublin_Society" id="w">Royal Dublin Society</a>. The research station for the Agriculture department of <a href="/wiki/University_College_Dublin" id="w">University College Dublin</a> is situated at nearby <a href="/wiki/Lyons_Hill" id="w">Lyons Hill</a>. As with the rest of County Kildare, racehorse breeding and training is a prominent local activity. In the <a href="/wiki/1920s" id="w">1920s</a> Straffan Station stud was the leading horse breeding stud in the country when owned by Edward “Cub’ Kennedy.</p>
<a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h1>Etymology</h1>
<p>The name &#39;Straffan&#39; has an interesting etymological history. The town is named for St Srafán, whose feast day in the <a href="/wiki/Martyrology_of_Tallaght" id="w">Martyrology of Tallaght</a> was May 23rd. Straffan was also one of 300 Irish locations accorded its own place-legend in <a href="/wiki/Dindshenchas" id="w">Dinnshenchas Érenn</a> (Metrical (ed. Edward Gwynn 1924) iv, pp328-331). It consisted of a poem <a href="/wiki/Lumman_Tige_Srafain" id="w">Lumman Tige Srafain</a>, about a warrior who possessed a wonderful shield, Lumman of the title, and who, according to the poem, died of his wounds at Tech Srafáin. Two forms of the name cited in the tale, Tech Srafáin and Tige Srafáin, are Middle Irish nominative and genitive case forms. The spelling Strafáin, with a -t-, is unusual. Straphan or Straffan is a shortened anglicised form of the original Irish Teach Srafáin (the initial Str- is the usual development of Irish Sr in English), &#34;teach&#34;, meaning house.. </p>
<p>The second Irish name of the town - &#34;An Cluanini&#34;, means &#34;little meadows&#34;. The story goes that St. Srafán, upon his arrival to the village, noted the smaller size fields in comparison to those of his native Tallaght and gave the town the name.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Dindsenchas" id="w">Dinnshenchas Érenn</a>, probably composed by <a href="/wiki/Cin%C3%A1ed_Ua_Hartac%C3%A1in" id="w">Cináed Ua Hartacáin</a> (d975), also selected the nearby <a href="/wiki/Lyona_Hill" id="w">Cnoch Liamhna</a> for mention as one of the “assemblies and noted places in Ireland” , an indication of the strength of the local ruling family, the Uí Dúnchada branch of the <a href="/wiki/U%C3%AD_D%C3%BAnlainge" id="w">Uí Dúnlainge</a> who supplied ten <a href="/wiki/Kings_of_Leinster" id="w">kings of Leinster</a> from their base on nearby <a href="/wiki/Lyons_Hill" id="w">Lyons Hill</a> between 750-1050.</p>
<p>Sruthán (stream) was mistakenly cited by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_O%26%2339%3BConnor" id="w">Thomas O&#39;Connor</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Ordnance_Survey" id="w">Ordnance Survey</a> Letters in 1837.and adopted as the Irish form of Straffan. Seosamh Laoide used it in his list of Irish names of post-offices published in Post-Sheanchas (1905).  An Sruthán gained currency among those involved in the Irish revival and was promoted as name in the local schools. Recent research  by Domhnall mac Gilla Easpaig declares it “completely at odds with the written evidence cited above and with local pronunciation and appears to be no more than an ad hoc explanation of the name by O&#39;Connor&#39;s informant.” Sruthán is anglicised struffaun in some parts of the country. One would not expect to find it rendered thus in the Straffan area.”</p>
<p>To add to the confusion the Post Office Guide published by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs 1937 gives the Irish form Cluainíní for Straffan, as cited by Seosamh Laoide.  <a href="/wiki/An_Comisi%C3%BAn_Logainmneacha" id="w">An Comisiún Logainmneacha</a> proposed the form Na Cluainíní as the Irish form of Straffan Station in the provisional list of the Irish names of postal towns Ainmneacha Gaeilge na mBailte Poist i gCuige Laighean, Liosta Sealadach (1964). It was changed to Teach Strafan in 1982 Post Office Guide. </p>
<p>Adding further to the confusion was the anomaly, which was corrected in the last five years, of the road signs on the three major roads leading into the village showing the three different names.</p>

<p>The nearby tower house of <a href="/wiki/Castledillon%2C_County_Kildare" id="w">Castledillon</a> passed to the de Hereford and Rochford families (1359) until it too fell into disrepair – now only the foundations remain.</p>
<p>A Wogan family tower house “in the north part of Richardstown townland” described as “a square building about 60 feet in height&#39; by Thomas O’Conor in 1837 is now reduced to a pile of stones and mortar which has obviously been moved from its original location.</p>
<p>Barberstown Castle was more fortunate. Its battlemented keep is a prominent landmark on the <a href="/wiki/Celbridge" id="w">Celbridge</a> to <a href="/wiki/Clane" id="w">Clane</a> road, 50 feet at its greatest height with walls four and a half feet thick, two small towers, a 53 step staircase and some evidence of damage in the war of 1641. Originally built by Nicholas Barby in the13th century, it passed to the Penkistons in the 14th century, Suttons in the 15th century, the Gaynors who built the Elizabethan House in the 16th century, to Katherine Dillon and Lord Kingston in the 17th century, <a href="/wiki/Bartholmew_Van_Homreigh" id="w">Bartholmew Van Homreigh</a> in the 18th century and Hugh Barton who built the  castle roof and added the Victorian House in the 19th  century. It is now a hotel and wedding venue.
<a href="/wiki/Lyons_Hill" id="w">Lyons</a> Castle mentioned in the 1332 Book of Howth when it was burned  by the O’Tooles, passed to the Tyrrell in the 1200s, the Aylmer family in 1271 and to the Lawless family, Barons Cloncurry in 1796 after which they built the nearby house, substantially rebuilt and refurbished by <a href="/wiki/Valentine_Lawless" id="w">Valentine Lawless</a>, the second Baron Cloncurry 1803-10...
Lodge Park was designed by <a href="/wiki/Nathaniel_Clements" id="w">Nathaniel Clements</a> for Hugh Henry, a Palladian house unusual for its four wings. The story was already current in the early 19th century that when Henry married the daughter of Earl of Milltown he promised her frontage as long as <a href="/wiki/Russborough" id="w">Russborough</a>.</p>
<p>The townland known variously in the calendar Rolls as Surning, Twinings, Surnyng and eventually known as Turnings passed in to the ownership of Thomas Hall (1406), William Preston (1508), Patrick Sarsfield (ancestor of <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Sarsfield" id="w">Patrick Sarsfield</a> of siege of Limerick fame) (1560), Theophilus Jones (1641) and eventually passed to the Mills family.</p>
<p>Straffan Lodge, described by <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Lewis" id="w">Samuel Lewis</a> in 1837 as “the neat residence of Mrs Whitelaw” is noted for its dining room decorated Tudor style with oak panels. Itssingle storey wing was added later.</p>

<p>Local ecclesiastical sites prospered at different times, The medieval parish of Straffan lies on the border of the Diocese of Dublin (boundaries established 1111), to the south of <a href="/wiki/Taghadoe%2C_County_Kildare" id="w">Tagahdoe</a> Parish (Teach Tua), bounded on the west by {Mainham%2C_County_Kildare|Mainham]], south by <a href="/wiki/Bodenstown%2C_County_Kildare" id="w">Bodenstown</a> and <a href="/wiki/Whitechurch%2C_County_Kildare" id="w">Whitechurch</a>, and east by <a href="/wiki/Killadoon%2C_County_Kildare" id="w">Killadoon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Castledillon%2C_County_Kildare" id="w">Castledillon</a>. Ecclesiastical sources refer to Straphan (Register of the Hospital of St. John the Baptist 1245, the Calendar of Justiciary Rolls 1306 and the Regal Visitation 1530 which describes Straffan as &#39;a church of the deanery of Saltu Salmonis. In 1541 Straffan was united with Castledillon, Donacumper and Kildrought. </p>
<p>The last Catholic Parish Priest of <a href="/wiki/Castledillon%2C_County_Kildare" id="w">Castledillon</a> died in 1707 after which the parish was joined with Straffan. Straffan parish is now joined to Celbridge.</p>
<p>Straffan’s ruined parish church in the graveyard at the centre of the village can be dated to the 15th century from its distinctive bell cote, and defensive living quarters over the main building in the manner of Oughterard and other local churches. The Church of Ireland (1833) has stained glass windows by <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Child" id="w">Alfred Child</a> and <a href="/wiki/Catherine_O%E2%80%99Brien" id="w">Catherine O’Brien</a> and several monuments to the Barton family. It was modeled on churches in France. The Catholic church (1787, rebuilt 1987) was also the site of the national school until 1963. It is part of Straffan’s proud ecumenical tradition that the Catholic community used the Church of Ireland while their own church was undergoing reconstruction.</p>
<p>A well and stone roofed chapel at Ardrass (restored 1898) are associated with St Patrick. The hill was a place of pilgrimage until the 19th century.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Castledillon%2C_County_Kildare" id="w">Castledillon</a> , situated on the south bank of the River Liffey opposite Straffan, is an ancient monastic site in tits own right founded by Iollathan of the desert (feast day is listed as 2nd Feb in the Martyrology of Tallaght) and accorded a genealogy which indicated close kinship with the Ui Dunglainge <a href="/wiki/Kings_of_Leinster" id="w">kings of Leinster</a>. By 1294 the church of Tristeyldelane was described as “not worth the services of chaplains” in the Calendar of Christ Church deeds. The site is now identified by a pile of stones and one headstone, erected in 1758 to the Spellissy family. The Castledillon Friars Stone, probably erected for a 15th century abbot of St Wolstan’s (four miles to the east), remained on the site until removed to the Visitor centre in Kildare town.</p>

<p>Hugh <a href="/wiki/Barton" id="w">Barton</a> (1766-1854) was in turn succeeded by Nathaniel Barton (1799-1867), Hugh Lyndoch Barton (1824-1899), Bertram Francis Barton (1830-1904), Bertram Hugh Barton (1858-1927) and Capt Frederick (Derick) Barton (1900-1993).  The first five generations of Bartons owned both the estate at Straffan and the family’s 37-hectacre vineyard in St Julien near the Gironde north of Bordeaux, producers of <a href="/wiki/Chateau_Leoville-Barton" id="w">Chateau Leoville-Barton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chateau_Langoa-Barton" id="w">Chateau Langoa-Barton</a>. On his death Bertram Barton left the Straffan estate to his eldest son Derrick and the Bordeaux estate to his second son Ronald Barton. Anthony Barton moved to <a href="/wiki/St_Julien" id="w">St Julien</a> in 1951 and took over the vineyard on the death of Ronald in 1986. The Barton dynasty is believed to be the longest period of single family ownership of any vineyard in Bordeaux.</p>

<p>On the death of Bertram Barton in a hunting accident in 1927 the scale of the losses on the estate, £4,000 per year, became apparent. The staff of 50 outdoor and 16 indoor employees was unsustainable. Derrick Barton laid off most of the staff and demolished part of the house before selling the house and estate for £15,000 to motorcycle manufacturer John Ellis in 1949. Derrick Barton moved to Straffan Glebe House for a time. The last five private owners of Straffan House followed in quick succession: car importer <a href="/wiki/Stephen_O%E2%80%99Flaherty" id="w">Stephen O’Flaherty</a> (1960), film producer <a href="/wiki/Kevin_McClory" id="w">Kevin McClory</a> (1973), Iranian air force founder and minister in the Shah’s government <a href="/wiki/Nadar_Djhanbani" id="w">Nadar Djhanbani</a> (1977, shortly before the downfall of the Shah’s government and his execution), developer <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Gallagher" id="w">Patrick Gallagher</a> (1979) and property magnate <a href="/wiki/Alan_Ferguson" id="w">Alan Ferguson</a> (1981) who invested £6m in Straffan House but never lived there. </p>
<p>Entrepreneur <a href="/wiki/Michael_Smurfit" id="w">Michael Smurfit</a> who was searching for a suitable old house and estate to develop as a country club recruited <a href="/wiki/Ray_Carroll" id="w">Ray Carroll</a>, former manager at the <a href="/wiki/Grosvenor_Hotel" id="w">Grosvenor Hotel</a> in London to help with the task. Carroll recommended Straffan above seven other estates he had examined. In 1988 Straffan house was sold for £7m to the Jefferson Smurfit company for use as a golf course and hotel. A further £35m was spent developing the house as a hotel under a scheme negotiated with the government to produce 200 jobs in return for tax breaks for investors. In 1991 Straffan was opened as a 31-bedroom hotel. In 2004 a wing was added to double the size of the hotel and a granite porch from Ballynegal Co Westmeath used to bring the two wings together. </p>
<p>Straffan put in its first bid to host the Ryder Cup in 1988, before the course had even been built, for the 1993 event. In 1990 the north course, designed by <a href="/wiki/Arnold_Palmer" id="w">Arnold Palmer</a>, was completed. Straffan staged the PGA cup in 1991 and Irish professional Championship in 1992. As a result of a £1 million sponsorship offer form the <a href="/wiki/Smurfit_Group" id="w">Smurfit Group</a>, the <a href="/wiki/European_Open" id="w">European Open</a> moved its annual home from <a href="/wiki/Walton_Heath" id="w">Walton Heath</a> to Straffan in 1995. In 1999 Straffan’s bid for the Ryder Cup was eventually accepted by the European PGA. The tournament, staged in September 2006, proved to be the most profitable in the history of the tournament. The south course was completed in 2003 and used for the European Open of 2004.
In 2002 <a href="/wiki/Madison_Dearborm" id="w">Madison Dearborm</a> took over the Jefferson Smurfit corporation and divested itself of the K Club. Michael Smurfit purchased the hotel and estate and acquired a further 80 acres on the opposite side of the river for €115m in 2004, with the support of property developer <a href="/wiki/Gerry_Gannon" id="w">Gerry Gannon</a>. To fund this expansion 81 housing units were developed on the course and sold for €2.5m each.</p>
