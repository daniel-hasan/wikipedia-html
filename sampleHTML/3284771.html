The duo was formed in late 1998 by <a href="/wiki/SM_Entertainment" id="w">SM Entertainment</a>. Brian Joo auditioned while he was attending <a href="/wiki/Holy_Spirit_High_School_(New_Jersey)" id="w">Holy Spirit High School</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a>. Hwang Yoon-Suk, later to be known as Fany, was encouraged to audition by a staff member working for the label at his high school festival. Fly to the Sky officially debuted on <a href="/wiki/November_21" id="w">November 21</a> <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a> at the LOG-IN <a href="/wiki/H.O.T." id="w">H.O.T.</a> Concert and SM Festival Concert &#39;99.</p>
<p>Soon after, the duo released their debut album <i><a href="/wiki/Day_by_Day_(Fly_to_the_Sky_album)" id="w">Day by Day</a></i> on <a href="/wiki/December_9" id="w">December 9</a> <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a>, and made their first official television appearance two days later. Unlike their predecessors on their label, popular <a href="/wiki/Teen_idols" id="w">teen idols</a> at that time, they shied away from upbeat <a href="/wiki/Techno" id="w">techno</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dance_music" id="w">dance music</a>, opting for mid-tempo ballads. The debut became highly successful selling over 250,000 copies.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The duo acquired status as the next-generation stars as they won Best New Artist award in 2000.<sup id="_ref-Fly to the Sky artist review_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Fly to the Sky artist review" title="">[3]</a></sup> At the same time, the duo failed to rise to instant stardom unlike their predecessors such as <a href="/wiki/H.O.T." id="w">H.O.T.</a>, whose album sales have passed the one million mark.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Their popularity slowly climbed with the release of their second album <a href="/wiki/The_Promise_(Fly_to_the_Sky_album)" id="w">&#39;&#39;The Promise&#39;&#39;</a> in 2001, which featured more diverse genres than its predecessor. With more upbeat tracks, it peaked at #2, but quickly disappeared from the charts.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> In the same year, they held a joint concert with Korean R&#38;B singer Kim Jo-Han.</p>

In April 2002, their third album <i><a href="/wiki/Sea_of_Love_(Fly_to_the_Sky_album)" id="w">Sea of Love</a></i> was released while Joo was in <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" id="w">New Jersey</a> attending <a href="/wiki/Rutgers_University" id="w">Rutgers University</a>. As a result, Hwang began to perform by himself until Brian returned to Korea. The lead single from the album was the title track, a poppy ballad, and it became a summer hit. Their second single &#34;Condition of my Heart&#34; was written by American singer <a href="/wiki/Brian_McKnight" id="w">Brian McKnight</a>; in contrast to the first single, &#34;Condition&#34; was a heavier ballad. The single signaled the duo&#39;s musical transition from bubblegum music to R&#38;B. Along with their music, their image began to change as the duo traded in their &#34;<a href="/wiki/Bishounen" id="w">bishounen</a>&#34; look for a more masculine image.</p>
<p>Their 2003 studio album <i><a href="/wiki/Missing_You_(Fly_to_the_Sky_album)" id="w">Missing You</a></i> featured more tracks that departed from <a href="/wiki/Bubblegum_music" id="w">bubblegum music</a> and emphasized their vocal skills for an image as serious artists. Performing commercially well, the album gave the duo many awards including &#34;Bonsang&#34; award from <a href="/wiki/Seoul_Broadcasting_System" id="w">SBS</a> Gayo Daejun and Korea Music Awards. This period is remembered for the highly publicized death of their manager, who was also the manager of  <a href="/wiki/BoA" id="w">BoA</a>, another Korean singer.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> On a <a href="/wiki/Variety_show" id="w">variety show</a>, both members recalled this incident as an emotionally hard time for them. Fany was especially shocked, because he was on the same vehicle with his manager just hours before the incident.</p>
<p>In November 2004, the duo released their fifth and last studio album under SM Entertainment, <i><a href="/wiki/Gravity_(Fly_to_the_Sky_album)" id="w">Gravity</a></i>. The album received little promotion, and became the duo&#39;s lowest-selling studio album, selling just below 90,000 copies.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Nevertheless, they held their first official concert successfully in <a href="/wiki/Jamsil_Arena" id="w">Jamsil Arena</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_21" id="w">December 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, and received &#34;Best R&#38;B Artist&#34; award from SBS Gayo Daejun.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> A controversy rose as critics questioned their eligibility for the award, because the album was released only two months before the show. They challenged the credibility and fairness of SBS Gayo Daejun in its entirety as the artists who boycotted SBS such as <a href="/wiki/YG_Family" id="w">YG Family</a> or those who were not present did not receive any awards. They scorned the show as &#34;a party for only those who were present.&#34;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The release of their <a href="/wiki/Greatest_hits" id="w">Greatest hits</a> album <i>Eternity</i> in 2005 coincided with the release of the soundtrack of Korean drama <i>Fashion 70s</i> which featured the duo. The popular Korean show made their song &#34;가슴 아파도&#34; (&#34;Although My Heart Aches&#34;), the theme song of the show, an unexpected hit.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> <i>Eternity</i> is the last Fly to the Sky album released by SM Entertainment.</p>

<p>After Fly to the Sky&#39;s contract with SM Entertainment expired in November 2004, the duo signed on with PFull Entertainment. The duo stated that they wanted a smaller label that was willing to promote them as musicians and focus less on commercial success.<sup id="_ref-twovoices_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-twovoices" title="">[1]</a></sup> Under this label, Fly to the Sky released their sixth studio album <i>Transition</i> after a year-long hiatus in January 2006. The album became massively successful, selling over 160,000 copies.</p>
<p>The duo embarked on their first nationwide tour, &#34;Fly To The Sky: 2006 The Twice Tour&#34;. Starting from Jamsil Arena in <a href="/wiki/Seoul" id="w">Seoul</a> in May 2006, they held concerts in <a href="/wiki/Busan" id="w">Busan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Daegu" id="w">Daegu</a>, Junju, and <a href="/wiki/Kwangju" id="w">Kwangju</a>. Including the number of audiences in the encore concert in Seoul, the tour garnered more than 50,000 people.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>To commemorate the success of <i>Transition</i>, Fly To The Sky released a special new edition, which included music videos, deleted scenes and the additional tracks &#34;Hwan Sang (Illusion),&#34; &#34;Hot and Cold,&#34; and &#34;When I Say.&#34;</p>
<p>In 2004 and 2005, the duo&#39;s uncertain future after their contract with SM Entertainment led to a speculation that they would disband.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Brian Joo publicly addressed the rumours on <a href="/wiki/SBS_(Korea)" id="w">SBS</a> show &#34;Yah Shim Man Man,&#34; which aired on July 10. He admitted that the two had difficulties in the early days of their career and said that he had been troubled by feelings of inferiority to Fany, because he received more attention and praise than him.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Despite their status as a duo, he felt that he was not given his due or the same amount of attention as Hwang. Eventually he found this difficult to bear, and suggested to him that they pursue their separate paths. Hwang responded angrily and the matter escalated into a serious fight nearly leading to disbandment. The two reconciled soon after, and said they &#34;grew to better understand each other and realized that they both needed each other.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6집으로 돌아온 Fly to the Sky (Fly to the Sky Returning with Sixth Album)_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6집으로 돌아온 Fly to the Sky (Fly to the Sky Returning with Sixth Album)" title="">[17]</a></sup> Afterwards, the pair decided to try to better understand each other in order to solve their problems together and to support each other. After reflecting on this incident, Joo&#39;s eyes were brimming with tears.</p>
<p>Since 2006, the duo has been seen frequently on variety shows and pursued individual careers. Hwang appeared on <a href="/wiki/Korean_television_drama" id="w">Korean television drama</a> &#34;Over the Rainbow&#34; during summer of 2006, and Joo released his solo album <i><a href="/wiki/The_Brian" id="w">The Brian</a></i> in December 2006. As they appeared more often on non-music programs, the duo saw an increase in their popularity and backlash from critics at the same time as they felt the duo were compromising their image as artists.<sup id="_ref-castallthesame_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-castallthesame" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<a id="2007-present:_''No_Limitations''" name="2007-present:_''No_Limitations''"></a><h2>2007-present: &#39;&#39;No Limitations&#39;&#39;</h2>

<p>After the contract to SM Entertainment expired, the duo, Brian in particular, has appeared frequently on <a href="/wiki/Variety_shows" id="w">variety shows</a> since 2005. Brian became one of two <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Ceremonies" id="w">MCs</a> for MBC&#39;s &#34;Music Core&#34; on <a href="/wiki/May_6" id="w">May 6</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>. This helped Brian gain publicity and expand his fanbase in ways he could not have in the early days of his career. After the duo officially took a hiatus from their sixth album, Brian continues to appear on variety shows such as Love Letter, and is still the MC of <i>Music Core</i>.</p>
<p>Brian&#39;s solo album was released <a href="/wiki/December_18" id="w">December 18</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>. Brian performed his first single, &#34;Gajima&#34; (<i>Don&#39;t Go</i>) on Mnet Countdown on December 7.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Musical_style" name="Musical_style"></a><h1>Musical style</h1>
<p>The duo&#39;s debut single &#34;Day by Day&#34; was a light bubblegum <a href="/wiki/Love_song" id="w">love song</a>. Their subsequent songs were a combination of R&#38;B, <a href="/wiki/Pop_rap" id="w">pop rap</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hip-hop" id="w">hip-hop</a> until 2002, when the duo abandoned bubblegum pop. Since 2002, they opted for a blend of heavy R&#38;B and <a href="/wiki/Korean_pop" id="w">Korean pop</a>. They continue to sing love songs, and some of them continue to incorporate hip-hop and rap from Brian.</p>
<p>The duo differs in their taste of music. Producer of <i>Transition</i>, Hwang Se-Jun, has said Fany prefers pure R&#38;B while Brian likes music with distinct beats and has a strong liking for rap.<sup id="_ref-6집으로 돌아온 Fly to the Sky (Fly to the Sky Returning with Sixth Album)_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6집으로 돌아온 Fly to the Sky (Fly to the Sky Returning with Sixth Album)" title="">[17]</a></sup> Despite his passion, their 2006 studio album <i>Transition</i> does not feature any. Brian predicts that there will no longer be any opportunity to include his rap in their album, and dislikes &#34;being generalized as a duo comprised of one rapper and one vocalist.&#34; He lamented the waning popularity of hip-hop in South Korea where &#34;hip-hop is merely labeled as dance music in Korea.&#34;<sup id="_ref-twovoices_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-twovoices" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Criticisms" name="Criticisms"></a><h1>Criticisms</h1>
<p>Prior to the duo&#39;s transition to R&#38;B, critics were displeased as despite being promoted as serious artists that appeal to older audiences, they felt that the duo was no different from other popular teen idols at that time.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> In a lengthy interview with music review site &#34;52street&#34;, the site described the duo in the early years as, &#34;trendy hairstyle, thick make-up, and flashy dance moves.&#34;<sup id="_ref-twovoices_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-twovoices" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>As their career matured, critics have pointed that Fly to the Sky has yet to find their own style. The duo has been criticized for lack of creative control over their works and relying heavily on composers whose distinct styles overpower their vocals.<sup id="_ref-albumreviewtransition_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-albumreviewtransition" title="">[29]</a></sup> During their career they have written lyrics for four songs in albums <i>Gravity</i> and <i>No Limitations.&#34;<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-albumreviewtransition_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-albumreviewtransition" title="">[29]</a></sup> Music critic Shin Hye Rim says,<sup id="_ref-albumreviewtransition_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-albumreviewtransition" title="">[29]</a></sup></i></p>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>Their appearances at variety shows were met with scrutiny as the duo were seen frequently outside of music programs during 2006.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> They were one of many artists who hopped on a bandwagon to promote their albums by appearing comical on variety shows. Critics have said their choice was like a double-edged sword; while they gained more publicity and a more viewer-friendly image, they were compromising their image as professional artists.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> From January to February 2006, Seoul YWCA conducted a research to study variety shows that air from 6PM to 8PM. The research concluded that &#34;variety shows star the same celebrities and air similar content.&#34;<sup id="_ref-castallthesame_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-castallthesame" title="">[18]</a></sup> The article listed celebrities who frequent those shows, of which Brian was one of them. He appeared in television shows of three major broadcasting networks of Korea during the same time slot on January 6 and January 29.<sup id="_ref-castallthesame_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-castallthesame" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
