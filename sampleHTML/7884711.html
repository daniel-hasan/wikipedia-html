The <b>1939 Soviet invasion of Poland</b> was a military operation that started without a formal declaration of war on <a href="/wiki/17_September" id="w">17 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1939" id="w">1939</a>, during the early stages of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, sixteen days after the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Nazi German</a> <a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland_(1939)" id="w">attack on Poland</a>. It ended in a decisive victory for the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a>.</p>
<p>In early 1939, the Soviet Union tried to form an alliance against Nazi Germany with the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic" id="w">Poland</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Romania" id="w">Romania</a>; but several difficulties arose, including the refusal of Poland and Romania to allow Soviet troops transit rights through their territories as part of <a href="/wiki/Collective_security" id="w">collective security</a>.<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cienciala" title="">[1]</a></sup> With the failure of the negotiations, the Soviets shifted from their anti-German stance and on <a href="/wiki/23_August" id="w">23 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1939" id="w">1939</a> signed the <a href="/wiki/Molotov-Ribbentrop_Pact" id="w">Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact</a> with Nazi Germany. As a result, on <a href="/wiki/1_September" id="w">1 September</a>, the Germans invaded Poland from the west; and on <a href="/wiki/17_September" id="w">17 September</a>, the Red Army invaded Poland from the east.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Soviet government announced that it was acting to protect the <a href="/wiki/Ukrainians" id="w">Ukrainians</a> and <a href="/wiki/Belarusians" id="w">Belarusians</a> who lived in the <a href="/wiki/Kresy" id="w">eastern part of Poland</a>, because the Polish state had collapsed in the face of the German attack and could no longer guarantee the security of its own citizens.<sup id="_ref-SCHULENBURG_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SCHULENBURG" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-note_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-note" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Red Army quickly achieved its targets, vastly outnumbering Polish resistance.<sup id="_ref-Wojsko_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wojsko" title="">[5]</a></sup> About 230,000 Polish soldiers or more (452 500<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>)  were taken <a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war" id="w">prisoners of war</a>.<sup id="_ref-PWN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PWN" title="">[7]</a></sup> The Soviet government annexed the territory newly under its control and in November declared that the 13.5 million Polish citizens who lived there were now Soviet citizens.

<p>The Soviet <a href="/wiki/Offence_(law)" id="w">invasion</a>, which the <a href="/wiki/Politburo" id="w">Politburo</a> called &#34;the liberation campaign&#34;, led to the incorporation of millions of Poles, western Ukrainians and western Belarusians into the Soviet <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_SSR" id="w">Ukrainian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Byelorussian_SSR" id="w">Byelorussian</a> <a href="/wiki/Soviet_republic" id="w">republics</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> During the existence of the <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_Poland" id="w">People&#39;s Republic of Poland</a>, the invasion was considered a delicate subject, almost <a href="/wiki/Taboo" id="w">taboo</a>, and was often omitted from official history in order to preserve the illusion of &#34;eternal friendship&#34; between members of the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Bloc" id="w">Eastern Bloc</a>.<sup id="_ref-Ferro_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ferro" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the late 1930s, the Soviet Union tried to form an anti-German alliance with the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> and <a href="/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic" id="w">Poland</a>.{{Ref_label}} The negotiations, however, proved difficult.

The governments of those countries rejected the proposal because, as <a href="/wiki/Polish_Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs" id="w">Polish foreign minister</a> <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Beck" id="w">Józef Beck</a> pointed out, they feared that once the Red Army entered their territories, it might never leave.<sup id="_ref-Cienciala_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cienciala" title="">[1]</a></sup> The Soviets did not trust the British and French to honour <a href="/wiki/Collective_security" id="w">collective security</a>, since they had failed to <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" id="w">assist Spain</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Falange" id="w">Fascists</a> or <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Munich" id="w">protect Czechoslovakia</a> from the Nazis.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/23_August" id="w">23 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1939" id="w">1939</a>, the Soviet Union signed the <a href="/wiki/Molotov-Ribbentrop_Pact" id="w">Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact</a> with Nazi Germany, taking the allies by surprise.

<p>The treaty provided the Soviets with extra defensive space in the west.<sup id="_ref-Dunnigan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Dunnigan" title="">[14]</a></sup> It also offered them a chance to regain territories ceded to Poland <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920)" id="w">twenty years earlier</a> and to unite the eastern and western Ukrainian and Belarusian peoples under a Soviet government, for the first time in the same state.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Soviet leader <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" id="w">Joseph Stalin</a> saw advantages in a war in western Europe, which might weaken his ideological enemies and open up new regions to the advance of <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">communism</a>.<sup id="_ref-Gelven_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gelven" title="">[16]</a></sup>{{Ref_label}}</p>

<p>At first, the Polish <a href="/wiki/Commander-in-chief" id="w">commander-in-chief</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marshal_of_Poland" id="w">Marshal of Poland</a> <a href="/wiki/Edward_Rydz-%C5%9Amig%C5%82y" id="w">Edward Rydz-Śmigły</a>, ordered the border forces to resist the Soviets.

<p>The Polish military&#39;s original fall-back plan was to retreat and regroup along the <a href="/wiki/Romanian_Bridgehead" id="w">Romanian Bridgehead</a>, an area in south-east Poland near the border with Romania. The idea was to adopt defensive positions there and wait for a promised French and British attack in the west.

<p>The Polish political and military leaders knew that they were losing the war against Germany even before the Soviet invasion settled the issue.<sup id="_ref-Sanford_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sanford" title="">[20]</a></sup> Nevertheless, they refused to surrender or negotiate a peace with Germany.

Polish units proceeded to manoeuvre towards the Romanian bridgehead area, sustaining German attacks on one flank and occasionally clashing with Soviet troops on the other.

<p>The mass deportations were motivated by class warfare—Soviet propaganda hammered home the message that they were fighting a war against barbarism on behalf of civilization—and obsessive security concerns. Less openly admitted advantages of the deportations were the redistribution of deportees&#39; housing and land, the establishment of a back-up labour force prior to the inevitable war with Germany, and the radical alteration of the ethnic demographic of the annexed region.<sup id="_ref-Rieber14,32-37_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rieber14,32-37" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
