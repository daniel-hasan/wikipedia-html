<p><b>Back Stage</b> is an entertainment-industry brand aimed at people working in film and the performing arts. </p>
<p>Back Stage publishes two weekly tabloid-sized trade magazines in the U.S. (<i>Back Stage East</i> and <i>Back Stage West</i>) and a bimonthly digest-sized resource directory (<i>Ross Reports</i>) that cover the entertainment industry from the perspective of performers (singers, dancers, comedians, etc.), the performance unions (<a href="/wiki/SAG" id="w">SAG</a>, <a href="/wiki/Actors%26%2339%3B_Equity_Association" id="w">Actors&#39; Equity Association</a>, <a href="/wiki/AFTRA" id="w">AFTRA</a>, <a href="/wiki/AGVA" id="w">AGVA</a>, <a href="/wiki/AGMA" id="w">AGMA</a>, the <a href="/wiki/American_Federation_of_Musicians" id="w">American Federation of Musicians</a>, <a href="/wiki/AFTRA" id="w">AFTRA</a>, etc.), casting directors, agents, writers, directors, and, in particular, actors. </p>
<p>Back Stage also publishes related books and newsletters, produces industry trade shows (such as Actorfest), and hosts various panels and screenings, along with running multiple websites (including BackStage.com and RossReports.com).</p>
<p>Back Stage may be most well known as a resource for audition information, casting calls/casting notices, training opportunities, and entertainment-industry jobs, news, and interviews. Film and theatre are the main topics reviewed and reported upon, but the television, radio, dance, music, cabaret, voice-over, modeling, and stand-up comedy industries are also included in Back Stage&#39;s coverage.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>

<p>Back Stage (the company) was founded by Allen Zwerdling and Ira Eaker in New York City in December 1960. At the time, <i>Back Stage</i> (the <a href="/wiki/Newsmagazine" id="w">newsmagazine</a>) was primarily a trade paper intended for New York actors and entertainment industry professionals, although its reach began to slowly spread across the U.S., especially on the East Coast.</p>
<p><i>Back Stage</i> also included a weekly pull-out section called <i>Back Stage Shoot,</i> a sort of mini-publication for behind-the-scenes people working in the film and video industries, with a special focus on the commercials industry.</p>
<p>In 1975 Back Stage opened a Los Angeles bureau and began to more actively extend its editorial coverage across the U.S., with corespondents based in Florida, Chicago, London, and other key entertainment-industry-centric areas added to the Back Stage roster over the years.</p>
<p>In 1986, Back Stage was bought by Billboard Publications Inc. (BPI), owner of such publications as  <i><a href="/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)" id="w">Billboard (magazine)</a></i>.  In 1988, BPI bought <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" id="w">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</i> Back Stage and <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, along with a few other related brands, were grouped together within BPI, becoming its film and performing arts division.</p>
<p>Interestingly, although <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, <i>Billboard</i>, and <i>Back Stage</i> each covers distinct areas of the entertainment industry, they were (and are) all competitors to <i>Variety (magazine)</i> to some degree.</p>
<p>On July 6, 1990, <i>Back Stage Shoot</i> was spun off into into a full, standalone publication, <i>SHOOT</i>. The concept was to have <i>Back Stage</i> concentrate on actors, performing artists, and theatre, while <i>SHOOT</i> would continue to &#34;serve the news and information needs of creative and production decision-makers at ad agencies, and executives &#38; artisans in the production industry&#34; (according to their official press materials found on ShootOnline.com). To emphasize the change, the official <i>Back Stage</i> tagline &#34;The complete service weekly for the communications and entertainment industry&#34; was switched to &#34;The Performing Arts Weekly.&#34;</p>
<p>In early 1994, Netherlands-based company <a href="/wiki/VNU" id="w">VNU</a> bought Back Stage owner BPI. VNU eventually came to own a variety of trade publications -- including <i><a href="/wiki/Mediaweek" id="w">Mediaweek</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Adweek" id="w">Adweek</a></i> -- along with measurement company <a href="/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research" id="w">Nielsen Media Research</a>. </p>
<p>Later that same year, Back Stage created a new publication, <i>Back Stage West</i>, a weekly trade paper similar to the New York-based <i>Back Stage</i> but with a special focus on the West Coast acting community and casting opportunities based in California. At the time, despite past efforts, <i>Back Stage</i> was still popular primarily in the Northeast U.S.</p>
<p>Then, in 1997, BackStage.com was founded, which combined content from <i>Back Stage</i> and <i>Back Stage West</i> with selected news articles from <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> and <i>Billboard</i> and original online-only content intended to reach a larger, international audience. </p>
<p>And in May of 1998, Back Stage bought its chief LA competitor, <a href="/wiki/Drama-Logue" id="w">Drama-Logue</a>. </p>
<p>The Drama-Logue company was founded in 1969 as a casting hotline, and in 1972 it became a weekly trade publication entitled <i>The Hollywood Drama-Logue Casting Sheet</i>, commonly known simply as <i>Drama-Logue</i>. Before the end of 1998, Drama-Logue&#39;s holdings were fully integrated into BackStage.com and <i>Back Stage West,</i> which for a time became known as <i>Back Stage West/Drama-Logue.</i> However, the Drama-Logue brand name was slowly phased out.</p>
<p>Beginning in the late 1990s, a number of <a href="/wiki/Casting_(performing_arts)" id="w">casting (performing arts)</a> information and entertainment job websites began cropping up, offering specialized online tools for actors, performers, and models, including online casting submission systems and video-enhanced resumes. Although the BackStage.com website from this time period published hundreds of casting notices every week, the site was essentially set up only as a news publication, with the majority of the casting content published in bulk once a week along with the editorial content from the various Back Stage print publications. Thus, the site lacked the daily activity and new-media casting tools being developed by cutting-edge sites. </p>
<p>The competition eventually sparked major changes in Back Stage&#39;s development, and in October of 2005 Back Stage relaunched its print and online publications in order to regain its edge. </p>
<p>During this 2005 relaunch process, all Back Stage publications were redesigned (including <i>Back Stage West</i>); various staffing changes took place; the East Coast/New York edition of <i>Back Stage</i> was renamed <i>Back Stage East</i>; BackStage.com began publishing more articles on a daily basis and introduced more exclusive editorial content, blogs, feeds, and tools; and Casting.BackStage.com was founded, giving BackStage.com users access to advanced casting/job search, sort, and alert tools, along with a searchable talent database featuring resumes, pictures, video reels, and audio reels of thousands of working and aspiring actors and performers.</p>
<p>Around this same time, the primary Back Stage <a href="/wiki/Tagline" id="w">tagline</a> changed from &#34;The Performing Arts Weekly&#34; to &#34;The Actor&#39;s Resource.&#34; A secondary branding slogan, &#34;Casting You Can Trust - Since 1960&#34; was also added and given prominent placement both on BackStage.com and on the front covers of the weekly East Coast and West Coast newspaper/magazine versions of Back Stage. And sister publication <i>SHOOT</i> (and ShootOnline.com) was sold to another publishing company.</p>
<p>In 2006, a company called Valcon Acquisition B.V., run by a private equity group consortium, bought VNU, making Valcon the new owner of Back Stage and all other VNU holdings. Then, on January 18th 2007, VNU rebranded itself <a href="/wiki/The_Nielsen_Company" id="w">The Nielsen Company</a>, with its trade-publication division being renamed Nielsen Business Media.</p>
<p>And in early 2007, publisher Steve Elish retired from Back Stage after 34 years. However, founder Ira Eaker&#39;s daughter, longtime Back Stage editor-in-chief Sherry Eaker, carries on her father&#39;s work as the Back Stage editor at large. As of 2007, principals at Back Stage included associate publisher Charlie Weiss, national editor-in-chief Jamie Painter Young, national film and television editor <a href="/wiki/Jenelle_Riley" id="w">Jenelle Riley</a>, national casting editor Luke Thomas Crowe, managing website editor Tom Penketh, and director of manufacturing and operations Lydia Mikulko.</p>
<p>The Back Stage brand is still closely tied to its primary sister publications, <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> and <i>Billboard</i>, as well as the other Nielsen Business Media publications (Double R corporation). However, Back Stage has also carved out its own industry niche by publishing directories (such as <i>Ross Reports</i>, a bimonthly <a href="/wiki/List_of_Hollywood_agencies_and_management_companies" id="w">list of Hollywood agencies and management companies</a> and casting directors), books (actor handbooks and biographies published under the Watson-Guptill imprint Back Stage Books), and print-only industry inserts (such as the quarterly <i>ACTion</i> magazine for actors interested in making their own movies). </p>
<p>Back Stage also hosts and produces the semi-annual Actorfest trade show (this entertainment-industry networking event is held once in NYC and once in LA every year), the annual <a href="/wiki/Back_Stage_West_Garland_Awards" id="w">Back Stage West Garland Awards</a> (an awards show honoring the California theatre scene), and the annual Bistro Awards (honoring the cabaret industry, especially NYC-based cabaret). Additionally, Back Stage sponsors numerous events and panels for talent working in the fields of film, television, commercials, radio/voice-overs, theatre, dance, modeling, and club talent (comedians, singers, etc.).</p>
