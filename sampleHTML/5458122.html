<p><b>USS <i>John P. Jackson</i></b> was a <a href="/wiki/Steamship" id="w">steamship</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" id="w">United States Navy</a>.</p>
<p><i>John P. Jackson</i> was built at <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn%2C_New_York" id="w">Brooklyn, New York</a>, in <a href="/wiki/1860" id="w">1860</a> and purchased by the Navy at <a href="/wiki/Newark%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Newark, New Jersey</a>, from <a href="/wiki/Jersey_City_Ferry_Company" id="w">Jersey City Ferry Company</a> on <a href="/wiki/6_November" id="w">6 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1861" id="w">1861</a>. She was commissioned at <a href="/wiki/New_York_Navy_Yard" id="w">New York Navy Yard</a> on <a href="/wiki/14_February" id="w">14 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1862" id="w">1862</a>, Lieutenant <a href="/wiki/Selim_E._Woodworth" id="w">Selim E. Woodworth</a> in command.</p>
<p><i>John P. Jackson</i> was ordered to <a href="/wiki/Key_West" id="w">Key West</a> on <a href="/wiki/10_February" id="w">10 February</a> to serve as one of the steamers in Comdr. <a href="/wiki/David_D._Porter" id="w">David D. Porter</a>&#39;s mother flotilla. On <a href="/wiki/30_March" id="w">30 March</a> she arrived at Ship Island from Key West as Flag Officer Farragut assembled vessels for his campaign against <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana" id="w">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>. While Farragut labored to move his deep-draft, sea-going ships across the bar into the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a>, <i>John P. Jackson</i> was part of the task force which secured <a href="/wiki/Pass_Christian%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Pass Christian, Mississippi</a> on <a href="/wiki/4_April" id="w">4 April</a>. During the operation she joined <a href="/wiki/USS_New_London_(1859)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;New London&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/USS_Hatteras_(1861)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Hatteras&#39;&#39;</a> in driving off <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" id="w">Confederate</a> steamers <a href="/wiki/CSS_Carondelet" id="w">&#39;&#39;Carondelet&#39;&#39;</a>, <a href="/wiki/CSS_Pamlico" id="w">&#39;&#39;Pamlico&#39;&#39;</a>, and <a href="/wiki/CSS_Oregon" id="w">&#39;&#39;Oregon&#39;&#39;</a> as they attempted to prevent the Union landing which wrested the area around <a href="/wiki/Biloxi%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Biloxi, Mississippi</a> from the South. The same day <i>John P. Jackson</i> captured steamer <i>P. C. Wallis</i> with a cargo of naval stores.</p>
<p>She next escorted <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin_Butler_(politician)" id="w">General Butler</a>&#39;s occupation troop ships to the Mississippi passes while towing <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" id="w">Army</a> transport <i>Great Republic</i>. Leaving the Army vessels at the mouth of the Mississippi to await the outcome of the impending naval effort against New Orleans, <i>John P. Jackson</i> joined the mortar boats for the intense bombardment of <a href="/wiki/Fort_St._Philip" id="w">Forts St. Philip</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fort_Jackson_(Louisiana)" id="w">Jackson</a>. The cannonade began <a href="/wiki/18_April" id="w">18 April</a> and lasted until Farragut&#39;s ships had safely passed the Confederate batteries 6 days later, dooming the Southern riverside strongholds and the metropolis which they had fought to protect. </p>
<p><i>John P. Jackson</i> again supported Farragut when he ran the gauntlet at <a href="/wiki/Vicksburg%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Vicksburg, Mississippi</a> almost 2 months later to meet Flag Officer <a href="/wiki/Charles_Henry_Davis" id="w">Charles Henry Davis</a>, who had battled south along the Mississippi valley. Braving the fire of skillfully used Vicksburg cannons, Porter&#39;s flotilla peppered the Southern emplacements with shell, grape, and shrapnel throughout the daring dash. During the fray <i>John P. Jackson</i> was hit twice by 7-inch rifle projectiles, leaving her without power and causing other serious damage. Moments later <a href="/wiki/USS_Clifton_(1861)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Clifton&#39;&#39;</a>, coming to her aid with a towline, was struck in her starboard boiler; seven men were killed by scalding steam. <i>John P. Jackson</i> quickly lowered her boats to save a number of other men who had been forced overboard by the steam. </p>
<p>After repairs at New Orleans, <i>John P. Jackson</i> was ordered to Mississippi Sound on <a href="/wiki/30_September" id="w">30 September</a> for reconnaissance work; and she served there throughout the remainder of the war. Fire broke out in her engineering spaces on <a href="/wiki/8_October" id="w">8 October</a>, but efficient and courageous damage control action extinguished the blaze and saved the ship. She captured sloop <i>Young Gustave</i> in Mississippi Sound on <a href="/wiki/21_October" id="w">21 October</a>, and diligently performed blockade duty in the months that followed. On <a href="/wiki/12_September" id="w">12 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1863" id="w">1863</a> she cooperated with <a href="/wiki/USS_Genesee_(1862)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Genesee&#39;&#39;</a> and <a href="/wiki/USS_Calhoun_(1851)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Calhoun&#39;&#39;</a> in chasing steamer <i>Fanny</i> ashore where she was burned to prevent her falling into Union hands. The next day the same team engaged Confederate steamer <a href="/wiki/CSS_Jeff_Davis" id="w">&#39;&#39;Jeff Davis&#39;&#39;</a>, forcing her to withdraw to the shelter of batteries at Grant&#39;s Pass. The Union vessels then silenced the Grant&#39;s Pass guns. <i>John P. Jackson</i> overhauled and took schooner <i>Syrena</i> bound from Biloxi to Pascagoula on <a href="/wiki/21_October" id="w">21 October</a>.</p>
<p>Admiral Farragut&#39;s next major objective was <a href="/wiki/Mobile_Bay" id="w">Mobile Bay</a>. <i>John P. Jackson</i> was on hand at the outset of the campaign on <a href="/wiki/16_February" id="w">16 February</a> <a href="/wiki/1864" id="w">1864</a> when she towed three <a href="/wiki/Schooner" id="w">schooners</a> into position for the bombardment of <a href="/wiki/Fort_Powell" id="w">Fort Powell</a> and then joined in the cannonade. For the next 6 months she operated from New Orleans supporting the operations which culminated on <a href="/wiki/5_August" id="w">5 August</a> in Admiral Farragut&#39;s stirring victory. </p>
<p><i>John P. Jackson</i> captured the schooner <i>Medora</i> in Mississippi Sound on <a href="/wiki/8_December" id="w">8 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1864" id="w">1864</a>, and continued to serve in the <a href="/wiki/West_Gulf_Blockading_Squadron" id="w">West Gulf Blockading Squadron</a> until after the end of the war. She departed <a href="/wiki/Pensacola_Navy_Yard" id="w">Pensacola Navy Yard</a> on <a href="/wiki/26_July" id="w">26 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1865" id="w">1865</a> and two days later arrived New Orleans, where she decommissioned <a href="/wiki/5_September" id="w">5 September</a>. She was sold at public auction in New Orleans to Marcy, Maury &#38; Co. on <a href="/wiki/27_September" id="w">27 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1865" id="w">1865</a>. She was renamed <i>J. P. Jackson</i> on <a href="/wiki/3_October" id="w">3 October</a> <a href="/wiki/1865" id="w">1865</a> and was later abandoned in 1871.</p>
