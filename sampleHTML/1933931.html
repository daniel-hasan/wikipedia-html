The <b>history of American football</b>, the most popular spectator sport in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>,<sup id="_ref-popular_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-popular" title="">[1]</a></sup> can be traced to early versions of <a href="/wiki/Rugby_football" id="w">rugby football</a>. Both games have their origin in <a href="/wiki/Football" id="w">varieties of football</a> played in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> in the mid-<a href="/wiki/19th_century" id="w">19th century</a>, in which a <a href="/wiki/Football_(ball)" id="w">ball</a> is kicked at a <a href="/wiki/Goal_(sport)" id="w">goal</a> and/or run over a line.</p>
<p>American football resulted from several major divergences from <a href="/wiki/Rugby_football" id="w">rugby football</a>, most notably the rule changes instituted by <a href="/wiki/Walter_Camp" id="w">Walter Camp</a>, considered the &#34;Father of American Football&#34;. Among these important changes were the introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage" id="w">line of scrimmage</a> and of <a href="/wiki/Down_(football)" id="w">down-and-distance</a> rules.<sup id="_ref-PFRA2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFRA2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-histfoot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-histfoot" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NFL1869_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NFL1869" title="">[4]</a></sup> In the late 19th and early <a href="/wiki/20th_century" id="w">20th centuries</a>, gameplay developments by college coaches such as <a href="/wiki/Amos_Alonzo_Stagg" id="w">Amos Alonzo Stagg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Knute_Rockne" id="w">Knute Rockne</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Scobey_Warner" id="w">Glenn &#34;Pop&#34; Warner</a> helped take advantage of the newly introduced <a href="/wiki/Forward_pass" id="w">forward pass</a>. The popularity of <a href="/wiki/College_football" id="w">collegiate football</a> grew as it became the dominant version of the sport for the first half of the twentieth century.  <a href="/wiki/Bowl_game" id="w">Bowl games</a>, a college football tradition, attracted a national audience for collegiate teams. Bolstered by fierce <a href="/wiki/List_of_NCAA_college_football_rivalry_games" id="w">rivalries</a>, college football still holds widespread appeal in the US.</p>
<p>The origin of professional football can be traced back to 1892, with <a href="/wiki/William_Heffelfinger" id="w">William &#34;Pudge&#34; Heffelfinger&#39;s</a> $500 contract to play in a game for the Allegheny Athletic Association against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. In 1920 the American Professional Football Association was formed. This league changed its name to the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" id="w">National Football League</a> (NFL) two years later, and eventually became the <a href="/wiki/Major_North_American_professional_sports_leagues" id="w">major league</a> of American football. Primarily a sport of Midwestern, industrial towns in the United States, professional football eventually became a national phenomenon. Football&#39;s increasing popularity is usually traced to the <a href="/wiki/1958_NFL_Championship_Game" id="w">1958 NFL Championship Game</a>, a contest that has been dubbed the &#34;Greatest Game Ever Played&#34;. A rival league to the NFL, the <a href="/wiki/American_Football_League" id="w">American Football League</a> (AFL), began play in 1960; the pressure it put on the senior league led to a merger between the two leagues and the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl" id="w">Super Bowl</a>, which has become the most watched television event in the United States on an annual basis.<sup id="_ref-popular_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-popular" title="">[1]</a></sup>  </p>

<a id="First_games" name="First_games"></a><h3> First games </h3>
<p>Although there are mentions of <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native Americans</a> playing ball games, modern American football has its origins in traditional ball games played at villages and schools in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> for many centuries before America was settled by Europeans. There are reports of early <a href="/wiki/Settler" id="w">settlers</a> at <a href="/wiki/Jamestown%2C_Virginia" id="w">Jamestown, Virginia</a> playing games with inflated balls in the early <a href="/wiki/17th_century" id="w">17th century</a>.</p>
<p>As is the case with many sports, football-like games were popularized in the USA by students at and/or from elite schools and universities. These appear to have had much in common with the traditional &#34;mob football&#34; played in <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, especially on <a href="/wiki/Shrove_Tuesday" id="w">Shrove Tuesday</a>. The games remained largely unorganized until the <a href="/wiki/19th_century" id="w">19th century</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Intramural_sports" id="w">intramural</a> games of football began to be played on college campuses. Each school played its own variety of football. <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" id="w">Princeton</a> students played a game called &#34;ballown&#34; as early as 1820. A <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" id="w">Harvard</a> tradition known as &#34;Bloody Monday&#34; began in 1827, which consisted of a mass ballgame between the freshman and sophomore classes. <a href="/wiki/Dartmouth_College" id="w">Dartmouth</a> played its own version called &#34;<a href="/wiki/Old_division_football" id="w">Old division football</a>&#34;, the rules of which were first published in 1871, though the game dates to at least the 1830s. All of these games, and others, shared certain commonalities. They remained largely &#34;mob&#34; style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple and violence and injury were common.<sup id="_ref-PFRA1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFRA1" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ODF_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ODF" title="">[6]</a></sup>  The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" id="w">Yale</a>, under pressure from the city of <a href="/wiki/New_Haven%2C_Connecticut" id="w">New Haven</a>, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard followed suit in 1861.<sup id="_ref-PFRA1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFRA1" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="%22Boston_game%22" name="%22Boston_game%22"></a><h3> &#34;Boston game&#34; </h3>

<p>While the game was being banned in colleges, it was growing in popularity in various <a href="/wiki/New_England" id="w">New England</a> <a href="/wiki/University-preparatory_school" id="w">prep schools</a>. In 1855, manufactured inflatable balls were introduced. These were much more regular in shape than the handmade balls of earlier times, making kicking and carrying easier. Two general types of football had evolved by this time: &#34;kicking&#34; games and &#34;running&#34; (or &#34;carrying&#34;) games. A hybrid of the two, known as the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Boston_Game" id="w">Boston game</a>&#34;, was played by a group known as the <a href="/wiki/Oneida_Football_Club" id="w">Oneida Football Club</a>. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal <a href="/wiki/Football_club" id="w">football club</a> in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the &#34;Boston game&#34; on <a href="/wiki/Boston_Common_(park)" id="w">Boston Common</a>. They played mostly among themselves, though they organized a team of non-members to play a game in November 1863, which the Oneidas won easily. The game caught the attention of the press, and the &#34;Boston game&#34; continued to spread throughout the 1860s.<sup id="_ref-PFRA1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFRA1" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The game began to return to college campuses by the late 1860s. Yale, Princeton, <a href="/wiki/Rutgers_University" id="w">Rutgers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Brown_University" id="w">Brown</a> all began playing &#34;kicking&#34; game during this time.

The first team to reach six goals was declared the winner. Rutgers crossed the line first and went on to win by a score of six to four. A rematch was played at Princeton a week later under Princeton rules (one notable difference was the awarding of a &#34;free kick&#34; to any player that caught the ball on the fly). Princeton won that game by a score of eight to zero. <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" id="w">Columbia</a> joined the series in 1870, and by 1872 several schools were fielding intercollegiate teams, including Yale and <a href="/wiki/Stevens_Institute_of_Technology" id="w">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>.<sup id="_ref-PFRA1_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFRA1" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/October_19" id="w">October 19</a>, <a href="/wiki/1873" id="w">1873</a>, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> to codify the first set of intercollegiate football rules. Prior to this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team&#39;s own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on soccer than on rugby, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.<sup id="_ref-PFRA1_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFRA1" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Harvard, which played the &#34;Boston game&#34;, a version of football that allowed carrying, refused to attend this rules conference and continued to play under its own code. Harvard&#39;s voluntary absence from the meeting made it hard for them to schedule games against other American universities, so it agreed to play <a href="/wiki/McGill_University" id="w">McGill University</a>, from <a href="/wiki/Montr%C3%A9al" id="w">Montréal</a>, in a two-game series. The McGill team traveled to <a href="/wiki/Cambridge%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Cambridge</a> to meet Harvard in a game played under &#34;Boston&#34; rules, followed by a game of rugby. On <a href="/wiki/May_14" id="w">May 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/1874" id="w">1874</a>, the &#34;Boston&#34;-style game, was won easily by Harvard.

Harvard quickly took a liking to the rugby game, and its use of the <a href="/wiki/Touchdown" id="w">touchdown</a> which, until that time, was not used in American football. In late 1874, the Harvard team traveled to Montréal to play McGill in rugby, and won by three touchdowns. A year later, on <a href="/wiki/June_4" id="w">June 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1875" id="w">1875</a>, Harvard faced <a href="/wiki/Tufts_University" id="w">Tufts University</a> in the first game between two American colleges played under rules similar to the McGill/Harvard contest.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup>  The first edition of <a href="/wiki/Harvard-Yale_football_games_(The_Game)" id="w">The Game</a>—the annual contest between Harvard and Yale—was played on <a href="/wiki/November_13" id="w">November 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/1875" id="w">1875</a>, under a modified set of rugby rules known as &#34;The Concessionary Rules&#34;.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_23" id="w">November 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/1876" id="w">1876</a>, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit House in <a href="/wiki/Springfield%2C_Massachusetts" id="w">Springfield, Massachusetts</a> to standardize a new code of rules based on the rugby game first introduced to Harvard by McGill University in 1874. The rules were based largely on the Rugby Union Code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring. Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the <a href="/wiki/Intercollegiate_Football_Association" id="w">Intercollegiate Football Association</a>, as a result of the meeting.

<a href="/wiki/Walter_Camp" id="w">Walter Camp</a> is widely considered to be the most important figure in the development of American football.<sup id="_ref-PFRA2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFRA2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-histfoot_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-histfoot" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NFL1869_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NFL1869" title="">[4]</a></sup>  As a youth, he excelled in sports like <a href="/wiki/Track_and_field" id="w">track</a>, <a href="/wiki/Baseball" id="w">baseball</a>, and soccer, and after enrolling at Yale in 1876, he earned varsity honors in every sport the school offered.<sup id="_ref-PFRA2_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFRA2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. He proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp&#39;s most famous change, the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage" id="w">line of scrimmage</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Snap_(football)" id="w">snap</a> from <a href="/wiki/Center_(American_football)" id="w">center</a> to <a href="/wiki/Quarterback" id="w">quarterback</a>, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.<sup id="_ref-PFRA2_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFRA2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Camp&#39;s new scrimmage rules revolutionized the game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play to slow the game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each <a href="/wiki/Down_(football)" id="w">down</a>. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp&#39;s original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined with the establishment of the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby or soccer into the distinct sport of American football.<sup id="_ref-PFRA2_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFRA2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Camp was central to several more significant rule changes that came to define American football. In 1881, the field was reduced in size to its modern dimensions of 120 by 53 1/3 yards (109.7 by 48.8 meters). Several times in 1883, Camp tinkered with the scoring rules, finally arriving at four points for a touchdown, two points for <a href="/wiki/Extra_point" id="w">kicks after touchdowns</a>, two points for safeties, and five for <a href="/wiki/Field_goal_(football)" id="w">field goals</a>. In 1887, gametime was set at two halves of 45 minutes each. Also in 1887, two paid officials—a <a href="/wiki/Official_(American_football)#Referee" id="w">referee</a> and an <a href="/wiki/Official_(American_football)#Umpire" id="w">umpire</a>—were mandated for each game. A year later, the rules were changed to allow tackling below the waist, and in 1889, the officials were given whistles and stopwatches.<sup id="_ref-PFRA2_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFRA2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>After leaving Yale in 1882, Camp was employed by the New Haven Clock Company until his death in 1925. Though no longer a player, he remained a fixture at annual rules meetings for most of his life, and he personally selected an annual <a href="/wiki/All-America" id="w">All-American team</a> every year from 1898 through 1924. The <a href="/wiki/Walter_Camp_Foundation" id="w">Walter Camp Foundation</a> continues to select All-American teams in his honor.<sup id="_ref-camp_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-camp" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

In 1879, the <a href="/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football" id="w">University of Michigan</a> became the first team west of Pennsylvania to establish a college football team. Other Midwestern schools soon followed suit, including the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" id="w">University of Chicago</a>, <a href="/wiki/Northwestern_University" id="w">Northwestern University</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_Golden_Gophers_football" id="w">University of Minnesota</a>.

<p>From its earliest days as a mob game, football was a violent sport.<sup id="_ref-PFRA1_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PFRA1" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The 1894 Harvard-Yale game, known as the &#34;Hampden Park Blood Bath&#34;, resulted in crippling injuries for four players; the contest was suspended until 1897. The annual Army-Navy game was suspended from 1894–1898 for similar reasons.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  One of the major problems was the popularity of mass-formations like the <a href="/wiki/Flying_wedge" id="w">flying wedge</a>, in which a large number of offensive players charged as a unit against a similarly arranged defense. The resultant collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The situation came to a head in 1905 when there were 19 fatalities nationwide.  <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt" id="w">Theodore Roosevelt</a> threatened to shut the game down if drastic changes were not made. One rule change introduced in 1905, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass.

After the 1905–1906 reforms, which made mass formation plays illegal and forward passes legal, several coaches emerged who took advantage of these sweeping changes. Amos Alonzo Stagg introduced such innovations as the <a href="/wiki/Huddle" id="w">huddle</a>, the tackling dummy, and the pre-snap shift.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup>  Other coaches, such as <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Scobey_Warner" id="w">Pop Warner</a> and <a href="/wiki/Knute_Rockne" id="w">Knute Rockne</a>, introduced new strategies that still remain part of the game.</p>
<p>Besides these coaching innovations, several rules changes during the first third of the twentieth century had a profound impact on the game, mostly in opening up the passing game. In 1914, the first roughing-the-passer penalty was implemented. In 1918, the rules on eligible receivers were loosened to allow eligible players to catch the ball anywhere on the field—previously strict rules were in place only allowing passes to certain areas of the field.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>  Scoring rules also changed during this time: field goals were lowered to three points in 1909<sup id="_ref-NFL1869_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NFL1869" title="">[4]</a></sup> and touchdowns raised to six points in 1912.<sup id="_ref-NFL1911_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NFL1911" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>

Knute Rockne rose to prominence in 1913 as an <a href="/wiki/End_(American_football)" id="w">end</a> for the University of Notre Dame, then a largely unknown midwestern <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" id="w">Catholic</a> school. When Army scheduled Notre Dame as a warm-up game, they thought little of the small school. Rockne and quarterback <a href="/wiki/Gus_Dorais" id="w">Gus Dorais</a> made innovative use of the forward pass, still at that point a relatively unused weapon, to defeat Army 35–13 and helped establish the school as a national power. Rockne returned to coach the team in 1918, and devised the powerful <a href="/wiki/Notre_Dame_Box" id="w">Notre Dame Box</a> offense, based on Warner&#39;s single wing. He is credited with being the first major coach to emphasize offense over defense. In 1927, his complex shifts led directly to a rule change whereby all offensive players had to stop for a full second before the ball could be snapped. Rather than simply a regional team, Rockne&#39;s &#34;Fighting Irish&#34; became famous for <a href="/wiki/Barnstorm_(athletics)" id="w">barnstorming</a> and played any team at any location. It was during Rockne&#39;s tenure that the annual <a href="/wiki/Jeweled_Shillelagh" id="w">Notre Dame-University of Southern California rivalry</a> began. He led his team to an impressive 105–12–5 record before his premature death in a plane crash in 1931.

<p>As it grew beyond its regional affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new <a href="/wiki/Bowl_game" id="w">bowl games</a> were created: the <a href="/wiki/Orange_Bowl_(game)" id="w">Orange Bowl</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sugar_Bowl" id="w">Sugar Bowl</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Sun_Bowl" id="w">Sun Bowl</a> in 1935, and the <a href="/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_(game)" id="w">Cotton Bowl</a> in 1937. In lieu of an actual national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant regions of the country that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the <a href="/wiki/Associated_Press" id="w">Associated Press</a> began its <a href="/wiki/AP_Poll" id="w">weekly poll</a> of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation&#39;s college football teams.

was crowned the <a href="/wiki/Mythical_National_Championship" id="w">National Champion</a> of college football.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 1930s saw growth in the passing game. Though some coaches, such as General <a href="/wiki/Robert_Neyland" id="w">Robert Neyland</a> at Tennessee, continued to eschew its use, several rules changes to the game had a profound effect on teams&#39; ability to throw the ball. In 1934, the rules committee removed two major penalties—a loss of five yards for a second incomplete pass in any series of downs and a loss of possession for an incomplete pass in the end zone—and shrunk the circumference of the ball, making it easier to grip and throw. Players who became famous for taking advantage of the easier passing game included Alabama receiver <a href="/wiki/Don_Hutson" id="w">Don Hutson</a> and TCU passer <a href="/wiki/Sammy_Baugh" id="w">&#34;Slingin&#34; Sammy Baugh</a>.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

Nine out of ten Heisman trophy winners in the 1950s were runners.

As professional football became a national television phenomenon, college football did as well. In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, but by and large the sport still retained a mostly regional following.  In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights.

In 1940, there were only five bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar, Sun, and Cotton). By 1950, three more had joined that number and in 1970, there were still only eight. The number grew to eleven in 1976. At the birth of <a href="/wiki/Cable_television" id="w">cable television</a> and cable sports networks like <a href="/wiki/ESPN" id="w">ESPN</a>, there were fifteen bowls in 1980. With more national venues and increased available revenue, the bowls saw an explosive growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In the twenty years from 1960 to 1980, seven bowl games were added to the schedule. From 1980 to 2006, an additional 17 bowl games were added to the schedule.<sup id="_ref-bowls1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bowls1" title="">[46]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hickok1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hickok1" title="">[47]</a></sup>  Some have criticized this growth, claiming that the increased number of games has diluted the significance of playing in a bowl game. Yet others have countered that the increased number of games has increased exposure and revenue for a greater number of schools, and see it as a positive development.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> </p>
<p>With the growth of bowl games, it became difficult to determine a national champion in a fair and equitable manner. As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a tie-in), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the <a href="/wiki/Bowl_Coalition" id="w">Bowl Coalition</a>, which attempted to arrange an annual #1 versus #2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years, however several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences—the Pac-10 and Big Ten—meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition was replaced by the <a href="/wiki/Bowl_Alliance" id="w">Bowl Alliance</a>, which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national champion to three—the <a href="/wiki/Fiesta_Bowl" id="w">Fiesta</a>, Sugar, and Orange Bowls—and the participating conferences to five—the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference" id="w">ACC</a>, SEC, Southwest, Big Eight, and <a href="/wiki/Big_East_Conference" id="w">Big East</a>. It was agreed that the #1 and #2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the Big Ten, Pac-10, or the Rose Bowl, and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.<sup id="_ref-BCS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BCS" title="">[49]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-hickok1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hickok1" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>

In 1998, a new system was put into place, the Bowl Championship Series. For the first time, it included all major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-10, and SEC) and all four major bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta). The champions of these six conferences, along with two &#34;at-large&#34; selections, were invited to play in the four bowl games. Each year, one of the four bowl games served as a national championship game. Also, a complex system of human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule calculations was instituted to rank schools. Based on this ranking system, the #1 and #2 teams met each year in the national championship game. Traditional tie-ins were maintained for schools and bowls not part of the national championship. For example, in years when not a part of the national championship, the Rose Bowl still hosted the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions.<sup id="_ref-BCS_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BCS" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>The system continued to change, as the formula for ranking teams was tweaked from year to year. At-large teams could be chosen from any of the <a href="/wiki/Division_I" id="w">Division I</a> conferences, though only one selection—<a href="/wiki/Utah_Utes_football" id="w">Utah</a> in 2005—came from a non-BCS affiliated conference. Starting with the 2006 season, a fifth game—simply called the <a href="/wiki/BCS_National_Championship_Game" id="w">BCS National Championship Game</a>—was added to the schedule, to be played at the site of one of the four BCS bowl games on a rotating basis, one week after the regular bowl game. This opened up the BCS to two additional at-large teams. Also, rules were changed to add the champions of five additional conferences (<a href="/wiki/Conference_USA" id="w">Conference USA</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mid-American_Conference" id="w">Mid-American Conference</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mountain_West_Conference" id="w">Mountain West Conference</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference" id="w">Sun Belt Conference</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Western_Athletic_Conference" id="w">Western Athletic Conference</a>), provided that said champion ranked in the top twelve in the final BCS rankings.<sup id="_ref-BCS_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BCS" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the early twentieth century, football began to catch on among the general population of the United States and was the subject of intense competition and rivalry, albeit of a localized nature. Although payments to players were considered unsporting and dishonorable at the time, a <a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Pittsburgh</a> area club, the Allegheny Athletic Association, surreptitiously hired former Yale All-American guard <a href="/wiki/William_Heffelfinger" id="w">William &#34;Pudge&#34; Heffelfinger</a>. On <a href="/wiki/November_12" id="w">November 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1892" id="w">1892</a>, Heffelfinger became the first known professional football player. He was paid $500 to play in a game against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. Heffelfinger picked up a Pittsburgh fumble and ran 35 yards for a touchdown, winning the game 4–0 for Allegheny. Although observers held suspicions, the payment remained a secret for years.<sup id="_ref-birth_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-birth" title="">[50]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-histfoot_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-histfoot" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NFL1869_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NFL1869" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>In its early years the league was little more than a formal agreement between teams to play each other and to declare a champion at season&#39;s end. Teams were still permitted to play non-league members. The 1920 season saw several teams drop out and fail to play through their schedule. Only four teams: Akron, Buffalo, Canton, and Decatur, finished the schedule. Akron claimed the first league champion, with the only undefeated record among the remaining teams.<sup id="_ref-NFL1911_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NFL1911" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Other_professional_leagues" name="Other_professional_leagues"></a><h4> Other professional leagues </h4>

<p>Several other professional football leagues have been formed since the AFL-NFL merger, though none have had the success of the AFL. In 1974, the <a href="/wiki/World_Football_League" id="w">World Football League</a> formed, and despite attracting such stars as <a href="/wiki/Larry_Czonka" id="w">Larry Czonka</a> away from the NFL with lucrative contracts, the league was financially insolvent and folded after only two seasons. In 1982, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Football_League" id="w">United States Football League</a> formed as a spring league, and enjoyed moderate success during its first two seasons behind such stars as <a href="/wiki/Jim_Kelly" id="w">Jim Kelly</a> and <a href="/wiki/Herschel_Walker" id="w">Herschel Walker</a>. It moved its schedule to the fall in 1985, and tried to compete with the NFL directly, but it was unable to do so and folded, despite winning an anti-trust suit against the older league. In 2001, the <a href="/wiki/XFL" id="w">XFL</a> was formed as a joint venture between the <a href="/wiki/World_Wrestling_Entertainment" id="w">World Wrestling Federation</a> and the NBC television network. It folded after one season, and XFL stars such as <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Maddox" id="w">Tommy Maddox</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rod_Smart" id="w">Rod &#34;He Hate Me&#34; Smart</a> enjoyed limited success in the NFL.<sup id="_ref-NFL1971_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NFL1971" title="">[76]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup></p>
<p>The NFL founded a developmental league known as the <a href="/wiki/World_League_of_American_Football" id="w">World League of American Football</a> with teams based in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The WLAF ran for two years, from 1991 to 1992. The league went on a two-year hiatus before reorganizing as <a href="/wiki/NFL_Europe" id="w">NFL Europe</a> in 1995, with teams only in European cities. The name of the league was changed to NFL Europa in 2006. After the 2007 season, the NFL announced that it was closing down the league to focus its international marketing efforts in other ways, such as playing NFL regular season games in cities outside of the U.S.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup></p>
<p>Two football leagues are scheduled to begin play in the near future.

<p>American football has been played outside the US since the <a href="/wiki/1920s" id="w">1920s</a> and accelerated in popularity after <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, especially in countries with large numbers of U.S. military personnel, who often formed a substantial proportion of the players and spectators.</p> 
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a>, the <a href="/wiki/International_Federation_of_American_Football" id="w">International Federation of American Football</a>, was formed to coordinate international amateur competition.

<p>Until 2007, Japan dominated amateur football outside of the USA.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup> The Japanese national team won the first two world cups — hosted by <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a> in <a href="/wiki/1999_IFAF_World_Cup" id="w">1999</a> and <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> in <a href="/wiki/2003_IFAF_World_Cup" id="w">2003</a> — defeating <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a> in the play-off on both occasions.

<a id="Mexico" name="Mexico"></a><h3> Mexico </h3>
<p>American football has been played in Mexico since the early 1920s, and is a strong minority sport at Mexican colleges and universities, mainly in <a href="/wiki/Mexico_City" id="w">Mexico City</a>. Over successive decades, more universities and colleges joined the championship, and four categories, called <i>fuerzas</i>, were created. The First <i>Fuerza</i> became the <a href="/wiki/Mexican_College_Football" id="w">National League</a> in 1970. In 1978, this was reorganized under the name <i>Organización Nacional Estudiantil de Fútbol Americano</i> (ONEFA).</p>
<a id="Japan" name="Japan"></a><h3> Japan </h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Japan_American_Football_Association" id="w">Japan American Football Association</a> was founded in <a href="/wiki/1934" id="w">1934</a> with three collegiate teams: <a href="/wiki/Rikkyo_University" id="w">Rikkyo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Meiji_University" id="w">Meiji</a> and <a href="/wiki/Waseda_University" id="w">Waseda</a>.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup> By 1937, an allstar game involving teams representing eastern and western Japan, attracted over 25,000 spectators.</p>
<p>In Japan, high school teams also began to appear. In the 1970s, the movement of players between Japan and the U.S. increased dramatically, along with greater exposure on Japanese television.</p>
<a id="Europe" name="Europe"></a><h3> Europe </h3>
<p>The first amateur clubs in Europe were formed in <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" id="w">West Germany</a> in the 1970s. The <a href="/wiki/German_Football_League" id="w">German Football League</a>&#39;s first <a href="/wiki/German_Bowl" id="w">German Bowl</a> was played in 1979, with Frankfurt winning. In Europe the use of experienced players from the USA or Canada, who had to wear a large &#34;A&#34; on their helmets, brought quick success, but hampered the development of local talent. No more than two or three &#34;A&#34; players were allowed on the field, and in countries like <a href="/wiki/Finland" id="w">Finland</a>, teams also had to provide a local quarterback. This helped the <a href="/wiki/Finnish_American_Football_Association" id="w">Finnish American Football Association</a> win the European championships in the 1980s, over <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">Great Britain</a> and Germany, where US players often ran the offense in club games, but were not available for the national teams. However they could play for clubs that competed for the <a href="/wiki/Euro_Bowl" id="w">Euro Bowl</a>. The <a href="/wiki/European_Federation_of_American_Football" id="w">European Federation of American Football</a> was formed in 1996.</p>

<p>American football is a popular participatory sport among youth. One of the earliest youth football organizations was founded in Philadelphia, in 1929, as the Junior Football Conference. Organizer <a href="/wiki/Joe_Tomlin" id="w">Joe Tomlin</a> started the league to provide activities and guidance for teenage boys who were vandalizing the factory he owned.  The original four-team league expanded to sixteen teams in 1933 when Pop Warner, who had just been hired as the new coach of the Temple University football team, agreed to give a lecture to the boys in the league.  In his honor, the league was renamed the <a href="/wiki/Pop_Warner_Little_Scholars" id="w">Pop Warner Conference</a>. <sup id="_ref-amatimeline_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amatimeline" title="">[92]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-popwarnerhist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-popwarnerhist" title="">[93]</a></sup>  </p>
