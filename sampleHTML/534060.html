<p>The sales tax rate, as defined in the legislation, is 23% of the total amount paid, which includes the tax payment itself.

Critics argue that the sales tax rate defined in the legislation may not be revenue neutral (that is, it would collect less for the government than the current tax regime), and thus would not yield enough money for the government.<sup id="_ref-money_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-money" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Sales_tax_rate" name="Sales_tax_rate"></a><h2>Sales tax rate</h2>
<p>The FairTax legislation would apply a 23% federal <a href="/wiki/Retailing" id="w">retail</a> sales tax on the total transaction value of a purchase; in other words, consumers pay to the government 23 cents of every dollar spent in total (sometimes called <i><a href="/wiki/Tax-inclusive" id="w">tax-inclusive</a></i>—as income taxes are calculated). The assessed tax rate is 30% if the FairTax is applied to the pre-tax price of a good like traditional <a href="/wiki/Sales_taxes_in_the_United_States" id="w">U.S. state sales taxes</a> (sometimes called <i><a href="/wiki/Tax-exclusive" id="w">tax-exclusive</a></i>).<sup id="_ref-money_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-money" title="">[3]</a></sup> The FairTax legislation uses total transaction value (tax-inclusive) in presenting the rate; with an item purchased for $100 total, the retailer receives $77 and the remaining is collected for the federal government. However, American sales taxes have historically been expressed as a percentage of the original sale price (tax-exclusive); items priced at $100 pre-tax cost $130 with the tax added.<sup id="_ref-ludwigvonmises_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ludwigvonmises" title="">[25]</a></sup> The use of the tax-inclusive number in presenting the rate has been criticized as deceptive and misleading by the plan&#39;s opponents.<sup id="_ref-ludwigvonmises_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ludwigvonmises" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-FactCheck_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FactCheck" title="">[26]</a></sup>  Proponents argue that the 23% number represents a better comparison to income tax rates, which are presented as inclusive rates (see below, <a href="/wiki/FairTax#Presentation of tax rate" id="w">Presentation of tax rate</a>).<sup id="_ref-fairtaxbook_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fairtaxbook" title="">[5]</a></sup> Critics also argue that the sales tax rate would need to be higher to be revenue neutral (see below, <a href="/wiki/FairTax#Revenue neutrality" id="w">Revenue neutrality</a>).<sup id="_ref-finalreport_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-finalreport" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new goods and services.  A good would be considered &#34;used&#34; and not taxable if a consumer already owns it before the FairTax takes effect or if the FairTax has been paid previously on the good,<sup id="_ref-ABKS_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ABKS" title="">[14]</a></sup> which may be different than the item being sold previously. <a href="/wiki/Export" id="w">Exports</a> and the purchase of intermediate business sales would not be taxed, nor would <a href="/wiki/Saving_(economics)" id="w">savings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Investments" id="w">investments</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Tuition" id="w">education tuition</a> expenses as they would be considered an investment (rather than final consumption).<sup id="_ref-billtext_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billtext" title="">[1]</a></sup> Personal services such as <a href="/wiki/Health_care" id="w">health care</a>, legal services, <a href="/wiki/Financial_services" id="w">financial services</a>, haircuts, and auto repairs would be subject to the FairTax, as would renting apartments and other <a href="/wiki/Real_property" id="w">real property</a>.<sup id="_ref-money_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-money" title="">[3]</a></sup> In comparison, the current tax system also taxes such consumption indirectly by taxing the income used for purchase.  <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">State</a> sales taxes generally exempt these services in an effort to reduce the tax burden on low-income families.  The FairTax would use a monthly rebate system instead of the common state exclusions. The FairTax would apply to Internet purchases and would tax retail international purchases (such as a boat or car) that are imported to the United States (collected by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Customs_Service" id="w">U.S. Customs Service</a>).<sup id="_ref-billtext_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billtext" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>{{details}}
The <a href="/wiki/Effective_tax_rate" id="w">effective tax rate</a> for any household would be variable due to the fixed monthly tax rebates. The rebates would have the greatest impact at low spending levels, where they could lower a household&#39;s effective rate to zero or a negative rate.  At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact, and a household&#39;s effective tax rate would approach 23% of total spending.<sup id="_ref-NRSACalc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NRSACalc" title="">[27]</a></sup> For example, a household of three spending $30,000 a year on taxable items would devote about 6% of total spending to the FairTax after the rebate.  A household spending $125,000 on taxable items would spend around 19% on the FairTax.<sup id="_ref-money_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-money" title="">[3]</a></sup>  The lowest effective tax rate under the FairTax could be negative due to the rebate.  This could occur when a household spends less and pays less in taxes than the average <a href="/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States#Current poverty rate and guidelines" id="w">poverty level spending</a> for a similar household size.  The household&#39;s rebate would exceed actual taxes paid by that household. Buying or otherwise receiving used items can also contribute towards a lower rate.  The total amount of spending and the proportion of spending allocated to taxable items would determine a household&#39;s effective tax rate.<sup id="_ref-fairtaxfaq_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fairtaxfaq" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Presentation_of_tax_rate" name="Presentation_of_tax_rate"></a><h2>Presentation of tax rate</h2>
<p>Sales and income taxes behave differently due to differing definitions of tax base, which can make comparisons between the two confusing. For direct rate comparisons between sales and income taxes, one rate must be manipulated to look like the other. A 30% sales tax rate approximates a 23% income tax rate after adjustment.  The current U.S. tax system imposes taxes primarily on income. The tax base is a household&#39;s pre-tax income. The appropriate income tax rate is applied to the tax base to calculate taxes owed. Under this formula, taxes to be paid are included in the base on which the tax rate is imposed (known as <i>tax-inclusive</i>). If an individual&#39;s gross income is $100 and income tax rate is 23%, taxes owed equals $23. The tax base of $100 can be treated as two parts—$77 of after-tax spending money and $23 of income taxes owed. The income tax is taken &#34;off the top&#34;, so the individual is left with $77 in after-tax money.<sup id="_ref-ABKS_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ABKS" title="">[14]</a></sup> Traditional state sales tax laws impose taxes on a tax base equal to the pre-tax portion of a good&#39;s price (known as <i>tax-exclusive</i>). Unlike income taxes, U.S. sales taxes do not include actual taxes owed as part of the base. A good priced at $77 with a 30% sales tax rate yields $23 in taxes owed. Since the sales tax is added &#34;on the top&#34;, the individual pays $23 of tax on $77 of pre-tax goods.<sup id="_ref-ABKS_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ABKS" title="">[14]</a></sup>  By including taxes owed in the tax base, a sales tax rate can be directly compared to an income tax rate.</p>
<p>The FairTax <a href="/wiki/Statutory_rate" id="w">statutory rate</a>, unlike most U.S. <a href="/wiki/Sales_taxes_in_the_United_States" id="w">state-level sales taxes</a>, is calculated on a tax base that includes the amount of FairTax paid. In this manner, the FairTax, like <a href="/wiki/Value_added_tax#European Union" id="w">European sales taxes</a>, more closely resembles an income tax calculation. A final price of $100 includes $23 of taxes. Like the income tax example above, the taxes to be paid would be included in the base on which the FairTax is imposed.  Neal Boortz has stated that the FairTax would be implemented as an inclusive tax, which would include the tax in the retail price (not added on at checkout) and display the tax on the receipt as 23% of the total.<sup id="_ref-ftnote_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ftnote" title="">[31]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-americansolutions_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-americansolutions" title="">[23]</a></sup>   The FairTax is presented as a 23% tax rate for easy comparison to income tax rates (the taxes it would be replacing). Proponents believe it is both inaccurate and misleading to say that an income tax is 23% and the FairTax is 30% as it implies that the sales tax burden is higher, when in fact the burden of the two taxes is precisely the same—either both taxes are 23% or both taxes are 30%.  The plan&#39;s opponents call the semantics deceptive.  <a href="/wiki/FactCheck" id="w">FactCheck</a> called the presentation misleading, saying that it hides the real truth of the tax rate.<sup id="_ref-FactCheck_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FactCheck" title="">[26]</a></sup>  Laurence Vance, writing for the <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises_Institute" id="w">Ludwig von Mises Institute</a>, goes so far as to call the rate presentation a &#34;lie&#34;.<sup id="_ref-ludwigvonmises_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ludwigvonmises" title="">[25]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Bartlett" id="w">Bruce Bartlett</a> stated that polls show tax reform support is extremely sensitive to the proposed rate,<sup id="_ref-Bartletttaxnotes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bartletttaxnotes" title="">[30]</a></sup> and called the presentation confusing and deceptive based on the conventional method of calculating sales taxes.<sup id="_ref-BartlettWSJ_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BartlettWSJ" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>

A key question surrounding the FairTax rate is the ability to be revenue-neutral; that is, whether it would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues.<sup id="_ref-ABKS_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ABKS" title="">[14]</a></sup> Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods that result in dramatically different <a href="/wiki/Tax_rates" id="w">tax rates</a> making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between <a href="/wiki/Static_analysis" id="w">static</a> or <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_scoring" id="w">dynamic scoring</a> further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates,<sup id="_ref-scoring_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-scoring" title="">[33]</a></sup> with the rates presented below based on a static scoring analysis. </p>
<p>One of the leading economists supporting the FairTax is Dr. <a href="/wiki/Laurence_Kotlikoff" id="w">Laurence Kotlikoff</a> of Boston University.  A detailed 2006 study published in <i><a href="/wiki/Tax_Notes" id="w">Tax Notes</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Beacon_Hill_Institute" id="w">Beacon Hill Institute</a> at Suffolk University and Dr. Kotlikoff concluded the FairTax would be revenue-neutral for the tax year 2007 at a rate of 23.82% (31.27% tax-exclusive) assuming full taxpayer compliance.<sup id="_ref-beaconhill_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beaconhill" title="">[34]</a></sup> The study states that <a href="/wiki/Purchasing_power" id="w">purchasing power</a> is transferred to state and local taxpayers from state and local governments.

These studies implicitly incorporated some degree of tax evasion in their calculations simply by using <a href="/wiki/National_Income_and_Product_Accounts" id="w">National Income and Product Account</a> based figures that presumably understate total household consumption.<sup id="_ref-beaconhill_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beaconhill" title="">[34]</a></sup> Moreover, these studies did not account for the expected capital gains that would result from a reduction in the real nominal value of <a href="/wiki/U.S._government_debt" id="w">U.S. government debt</a> and the increased <a href="/wiki/Economic_growth" id="w">economic growth</a> that economists believe would occur.<sup id="_ref-endorsement_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-endorsement" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-beaconhill_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beaconhill" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to the above studies, one of the leading economists opposing the FairTax, <a href="/wiki/William_Gale" id="w">William Gale</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Brookings_Institution" id="w">Brookings Institution</a>, published a detailed 2005 study in <i>Tax Notes</i> that estimated a rate of 28.2% (39.3% tax-exclusive) for 2007 assuming full taxpayer compliance and an average rate of 31% (44% tax-exclusive) from 2006&#8211;2015 (an increase that accounts for the replacement of an additional $3 trillion in revenue collected through the <a href="/wiki/Alternative_Minimum_Tax" id="w">Alternative Minimum Tax</a> (AMT) impacting the <a href="/wiki/American_middle_class" id="w">middle class</a> over the 10 year period).<sup id="_ref-money_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-money" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-taxnotes_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-taxnotes" title="">[38]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-CBO_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CBO" title="">[39]</a></sup> The study also concluded that if the tax base were eroded by 10% due to tax evasion, tax avoidance, and/or legislative adjustments, the average rate would be 34% (53% tax-exclusive) for the 10 year period. The study did not take into consideration the increase in economic activity that Gale expects would result from the imposition of the FairTax.

The FairTax&#39;s impact on the distribution of taxation or <a href="/wiki/Tax_incidence" id="w">tax incidence</a> (the effect on the distribution of <a href="/wiki/Welfare_economics" id="w">economic welfare</a>) is a point of dispute. The plan&#39;s supporters argue that it would broaden the tax base, be <a href="/wiki/Progressive_tax" id="w">progressive</a>, decrease tax burdens, and start taxing wealth, while opponents argue that a national sales tax would be inherently <a href="/wiki/Regressive_tax" id="w">regressive</a> and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals.<sup id="_ref-money_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-money" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Taranto_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Taranto" title="">[40]</a></sup> Sales taxes are normally considered regressive, but the FairTax provides a rebate that supporters argue would create a progressive <a href="/wiki/Effective_rate" id="w">effective rate</a> on consumption. For example, a family of four (a couple with two children) earning about $25,000 and spending this on taxable goods and services, would consume 100% of their income. A higher income family of four making about $100,000, spending $75,000, and saving $25,000, would consume only 75% of their income on taxable goods and services. According to economist <a href="/wiki/William_G._Gale" id="w">William G. Gale</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Brookings_Institution" id="w">Brookings Institution</a>, the percentage of income taxed is regressive (using a cross-section time frame).<sup id="_ref-wgale_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wgale" title="">[6]</a></sup> When presented with an estimated effective tax rate, the low-income family above would pay a tax rate of 0% on the 100% of consumption and the higher income family would pay a tax rate of 15% on the 75% of consumption (with the other 25% taxed at a later point in time, as savings is <a href="/wiki/Tax-deferred" id="w">tax-deferred</a>).<sup id="_ref-whatisthedif_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-whatisthedif" title="">[41]</a></sup> The effective tax rate is progressive on consumption,<sup id="_ref-Kotlikoff_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kotlikoff" title="">[2]</a></sup> as a person spending at the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 0%, whereas someone spending at four times the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 17.2%.<sup id="_ref-whatisthedif_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-whatisthedif" title="">[41]</a></sup>
To see this in terms of realistic numbers, we can turn to the CBO figures<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup>  on household income and total federal tax rate.  For the middle quintile of American households, all federal taxes consumed 14.1% of the $58,000 average income.  With the poverty level set at approximately $14,000<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> for an average household size of 2.6,<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> that household would pay FairTax on $44,000 of its income, for an effective federal tax rate of 17.4%.</p>

<p>Households at the lower end of the income scale spend almost all their income, while households at the higher end are more likely to devote a portion of income to saving; households at the extreme high end of consumption often finance their purchases out of savings, not income.<sup id="_ref-wgale_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wgale" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Bartletttaxnotes_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bartletttaxnotes" title="">[30]</a></sup> These savings would be taxed when they become purchases. Income earned and saved would not be taxed immediately under the proposal. In other words, savings would be spent at some point in the future and taxed according to that consumption. FairTax advocates state that this would improve taxing of wealth. Economist <a href="/wiki/Laurence_Kotlikoff" id="w">Laurence Kotlikoff</a> of Boston University states that the FairTax could make the tax system much more progressive and generationally equitable.<sup id="_ref-Kotlikoff_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kotlikoff" title="">[2]</a></sup> &#34;Their view that taxing sales is regressive is just plain wrong.

If the FairTax bill were passed, permanent elimination of income taxation would not be guaranteed; the FairTax bill would repeal much of the existing <a href="/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Code" id="w">tax code</a>, but the Sixteenth Amendment would remain in place.

(It is also important to note that the Jorgenson model did not capture any reduction in the cost of compliance associated with changing from a complex income tax system to a simpler consumption tax.) This means that Jorgenson assumed that businesses would pass on all the cost savings from the repeal of payroll taxes and income tax withholding to consumers in the form of lower prices.

The Beacon Hill Institute shows that it would not matter whether prices fall or rise—the relative tax burden remains the same because if prices increased with the addition of the FairTax, wages would also rise accordingly; or if the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System" id="w">Federal Reserve</a> did not decide to accommodate (does not increase the <a href="/wiki/Money_supply" id="w">money supply</a>), then prices would fall and wages would remain at their net rates.

The current income tax system fails to collect on a significant percentage of taxes. The IRS estimates twenty additional cents of taxes are owed on unreported income for every tax dollar collected. In 2001, the IRS estimated this shortfall to be over $312 billion.<sup id="_ref-economist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-economist" title="">[82]</a></sup> These figures do not include taxes lost on illicit sources of income, such as illegal drug dealing. Proponents assert that the transparency and simplicity of the FairTax would subject much of this unreported income to taxation. The number of tax collection points would significantly reduce under the FairTax, as only retailers would file a tax return compared to every income earner. The FairTax would reduce the number of tax filers by about 80% (from 145 million to 25 million) and reduce the filing complexity to a simplified state sales tax form.<sup id="_ref-taxfilers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-taxfilers" title="">[83]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-lindersite_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lindersite" title="">[52]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Research supports the claim that simplified tax systems lead to greater compliance. The <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" id="w">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) found that Russia&#39;s transition to a flat tax increased income reporting from 52% to 68% in one year. Similar results have occurred in Slovenia.<sup id="_ref-economist_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-economist" title="">[82]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office" id="w">Government Accountability Office</a>, among others, have specifically identified the negative relationship between compliance and the number of focal points for collection. The federal government would be able to concentrate its entire tax enforcement efforts on a single tax—the FairTax. Retailers would receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs.<sup id="_ref-billtext_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billtext" title="">[1]</a></sup> In addition, the overwhelming majority of purchases occur in major retail outlets, which are very unlikely to evade the FairTax and risk losing their business licenses.<sup id="_ref-beaconhill_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-beaconhill" title="">[34]</a></sup> Economic figures show that 47% of all retail sales are made by just 688 businesses (<a href="/wiki/Big-box_store" id="w">&#34;Big-Box&#34; retailers</a>). 87% of retail sales are made by 193,000 businesses, which is 3.7% of U.S. businesses.<sup id="_ref-Newnan_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Newnan" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>FairTax opponents believe that compliance decreases when taxes are not <a href="/wiki/Tax_withholding_in_the_United_States" id="w">automatically withheld</a> from citizens, and that massive <a href="/wiki/Tax_evasion" id="w">tax evasion</a> could result by collecting at just one point in the economic system.<sup id="_ref-Bartletttaxnotes_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bartletttaxnotes" title="">[30]</a></sup> Compliance rates can also fall when taxed entities, rather than a third party, self-report their tax liability. For example, ordinary personal income taxes can be automatically withheld and are reported to the government by a third party. Taxes without withholding and with self-reporting, such as the FairTax, can see higher <a href="/wiki/Tax_evasion" id="w">evasion</a> rates.  In other countries, similar <a href="/wiki/Value_added_tax" id="w">VAT</a> taxes have an average evasion rate of 20%.<sup id="_ref-taxpanelrebuttal_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-taxpanelrebuttal" title="">[28]</a></sup>  Studies done by the <a href="/wiki/OECD" id="w">OECD</a>, IMF, and academic economists show that the upper limit for a sales tax is about 10% before incentives for evasion become too great to control.<sup id="_ref-Bartletttaxnotes_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bartletttaxnotes" title="">[30]</a></sup> William Gale has estimated that erosion of the tax base by 10% due to evasion would require an average sales tax rate of  34% (53% tax-exclusive) from 2006&#8211;2015 (which also accounts for the additional $3 trillion in revenue collected through the <a href="/wiki/Alternative_Minimum_Tax" id="w">AMT</a> impacting the middle class over the 10 year period) and evasion of 20% would have an average rate of 39% (65% tax-exclusive) for the 10 year period.<sup id="_ref-taxnotes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-taxnotes" title="">[38]</a></sup>  FairTax proponents, including the Beacon Hill Institute, disagree with those conclusions and published a study which challenges the findings.<sup id="_ref-galerebuttal_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-galerebuttal" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-taxpanelrebuttal_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-taxpanelrebuttal" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>The FairTax is a national tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency.<sup id="_ref-billtext_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billtext" title="">[1]</a></sup> This has a bearing on compliance, as the states&#39; own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration. According to the California 2004–05 budget analysis, this is more than the $327 million California is spending on the state&#39;s sales and excise taxes.<sup id="_ref-LAO_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LAO" title="">[84]</a></sup> The FairTax is simpler, but extends to cover services which are not currently subject to the California sales tax. Because the federal money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims the states would have an incentive to maximize collections.<sup id="_ref-fairtaxbook_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fairtaxbook" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, information sharing, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules.<sup id="_ref-billtext_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billtext" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-states_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-states" title="">[85]</a></sup>  Economist Bruce Bartlett suggests that the State may not have sufficient incentive to enforce the tax and that sales taxes have long exempted all but a few services because of the enormous difficulty in taxing intangibles.<sup id="_ref-BartlettWSJ_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BartlettWSJ" title="">[32]</a></sup> University of Michigan economist Joel Slemrod argues that states would face significant issues in enforcing the tax. &#34;Even at an average rate of around 5 percent, state sales taxes are difficult to administer.&#34;<sup id="_ref-nyreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nyreview" title="">[86]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Underground_economy" name="Underground_economy"></a><h2>Underground economy</h2>
<p>Opponents of the FairTax argue that imposing a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground and create a vast <a href="/wiki/Underground_economy" id="w">underground economy</a>.<sup id="_ref-money_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-money" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NSTv.VAT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NSTv.VAT" title="">[87]</a></sup> Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods would not always be taxed, since those goods would produce a retail good that will be taxed. Individuals and businesses may be able to manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller&#39;s certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see <a href="/wiki/FairTax#Personal vs. business purchases" id="w">Personal vs. business purchases</a>).<sup id="_ref-billtext_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billtext" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>While many economists and tax experts support a consumption tax, problems could arise with using a retail sales tax rather than a <a href="/wiki/Value_added_tax" id="w">value added tax</a> (VAT).<sup id="_ref-money_r" class="reference"><a href="#_note-money" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Bartletttaxnotes_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bartletttaxnotes" title="">[30]</a></sup> A VAT imposes a tax at every intermediate step of production, so the goods reach the final consumer with much of the tax already in the price, along with some extra overhead. The retail seller has little incentive to conceal retail sales, since he has already paid much of the good&#39;s tax. Retailers are unlikely to subsidize the consumer&#39;s tax evasion by concealing sales. In contrast, a retailer has paid no tax on goods under a sales tax system. This provides an incentive for retailers to conceal sales and engage in &#34;tax <a href="/wiki/Arbitrage" id="w">arbitrage</a>&#34; by sharing some of the illicit tax savings with the final consumer.<sup id="_ref-VAT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VAT" title="">[88]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the United States, a general sales tax is imposed in 45 states plus the District of Columbia (accounting for over 97% of both population and economic output). Most states also collect a variety of local sales taxes including county, city, and transit taxes.<sup id="_ref-SalesTaxFAQ_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SalesTaxFAQ" title="">[89]</a></sup> The United States has a large infrastructure for taxing sales that many countries do not have. Proponents respond to the underground economy argument by pointing out that, whereas tax evasion under the current income tax system requires only one person (the payer) to lie on their tax forms, tax evasion under the FairTax requires collusion of both the payer (the retail purchaser) and the payee (the retail seller). Furthermore, the number of individuals required to file taxes drops from approximately 145 million to 25 million, a drop in excess of 80%. This drop in the number of collection points will allow the tax administration to view tax fraud with greater scrutiny.<sup id="_ref-taxfilers_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-taxfilers" title="">[83]</a></sup> Proponents of the FairTax see a substantial amount of additional tax revenue from those engaging in the black market, as a sales tax would require all who consume to be taxed (see <a href="/wiki/FairTax#Effects on tax code compliance" id="w">Effects on tax code compliance</a>).</p>
<a id="Personal_vs._business_purchases" name="Personal_vs._business_purchases"></a><h2>Personal vs. business purchases</h2>
<p>For an individual to purchase items tax-free for business purposes, the business would be required to be a registered seller with the state sales tax authority, and thereby be subject to audit. The state would issue the business a registered seller&#39;s certificate. This would enable the business to purchase tax free from wholesale vendors, but they must give a copy of their registration certificate to the vendor to leave an audit trail.<sup id="_ref-billtext_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billtext" title="">[1]</a></sup> When an item is purchased for business use from a retail vendor, the business would have to pay the tax on the purchase and take a credit against the tax due on their sales tax return. Taxable property and services purchased by a qualified non-profit or religious organization &#39;for business purposes&#39; would not be taxable.<sup id="_ref-nonprofit_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nonprofit" title="">[90]</a></sup></p>
<p>Businesses would be required to submit monthly or quarterly reports (depending on sales volume) of taxable sales and sales tax collected on their monthly sales tax return.<sup id="_ref-ABKS_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ABKS" title="">[14]</a></sup> During audits, the business would have to produce invoices for the &#34;business purchases&#34; that they did not pay sales tax on, and would have to be able to show that they were genuine business expenses.<sup id="_ref-billtext_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billtext" title="">[1]</a></sup> Since 145 million individuals would no longer be filing tax returns, there would only be about 25 million businesses that could be audited.<sup id="_ref-taxfilers_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-taxfilers" title="">[83]</a></sup> Advocates claim that this would greatly increase the likelihood of business audits, making tax evasion behavior much more risky. Additionally, the FairTax legislation has several fines and penalties for non-compliance and authorizes a mechanism for reporting tax cheats and obtaining a reward.<sup id="_ref-billtext_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billtext" title="">[1]</a></sup> To prevent businesses from purchasing everything for their employees, in a family business for example, goods and services bought by the business for the employees that are not strictly for business use would be taxable.<sup id="_ref-billtext_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-billtext" title="">[1]</a></sup> Health insurance or medical expenses would be an example where the business would have to pay the FairTax on these purchases.</p>
