In 1809 a child born to the couple <b>Ponnu Nadar</b> and <b>Veiyelal</b> in <a href="/wiki/South_India" id="w">south India</a>, at <a href="/wiki/Swamithoppe" id="w">Swamithoppe</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Kanyakumari" id="w">Kanyakumari</a> District. They are of <a href="/wiki/Channar" id="w">Channar</a> cast, which was considered as a lower caste in the then society. They are of very poor means, and initially named the child <b>Mudisoodum Perumal</b>, meaning &#34;Lord <a href="/wiki/Vishnu" id="w">Vishnu</a> with a crown&#34;, but due to objections from those of higher <a href="/wiki/Caste" id="w">caste</a>, the family changed his name to <a href="/wiki/Muthukutty" id="w">Muthukutty</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The religious book, <a href="/wiki/Akilattirattu_Ammanai" id="w">Akilam</a>, states a legend that the child was born dead, and then the soul of the <a href="/wiki/Deva_(Hinduism)" id="w">deva</a>  <a href="/wiki/Sampooranathevan" id="w">Sampooranathevan</a> was installed in the body. According to the legend, the parents found the child still for a time immediately after the birth, and then the child began behave normally. Thereafter, that boy grew up called <b>Muthukutty</b> in human history, and <b>Sampooranathevan</b> in <a href="/wiki/Ayyavazhi_mythology" id="w">Ayyavazhi mythology</a>. </p>
<p>Muthukutty, a religious minded boy, had special interest in the worship of <a href="/wiki/Vishnu" id="w">Vishnu</a>. The holy book <a href="/wiki/Akilattirattu_Ammanai" id="w">Akilam</a> mentions that he had set a pedestal for Lord <a href="/wiki/Vishnu" id="w">Vishnu</a> in his house and worshipped the deity devoutly.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> At the age of seventeen, Muthukutty married <a href="/wiki/Thirumalammal" id="w">Thirumalammal</a> from the nearby village of <a href="/wiki/Puviyur" id="w">Puviyur</a>, and led a family life with her. However, there is also an opinion that they were not married at all, but that, she had come to live with him only to serve him during his public activities.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Thirumalammal had been previously married, but left her former husband to marry Muthukutty.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> According to quotes found in <i>Akilam</i>, they had a male child and that the child was born to her in the relationship with her first husband.

<a id="The_transformation" name="The_transformation"></a><h2> The transformation </h2>
<p>In his twenty-fourth year, Muthukutty was struck by a severe illness and suffered for a year. His mother took her sick son to the temple at <a href="/wiki/Thiruchendur" id="w">Thiruchendur</a>, during a festival in <a href="/wiki/Thiruchendur" id="w">Thiruchendur</a>. There, Muthukutty went in to the sea and disappeared. The parents searched for his body for a whole day. According to legends, on the third day, <a href="/wiki/Vishnu" id="w">Vishnu</a> appeared on the sea-shore. On seeing him, Muthukutty&#39;s mother mistook him to be her son and tried to embrace him. But the god told her that he was no longer her son, but the son of <a href="/wiki/Narayana" id="w">Narayana</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup>   Then he started walking towards <a href="/wiki/Detchanam" id="w">Detchanam</a>. This place became a holy place for the devotees of <a href="/wiki/Ayyavazhi_Mythology" id="w">Ayyavazhi</a> and they erected a temple there named <a href="/wiki/Avatharappathi" id="w">Avatharappathi</a> at Thiruchendur. This process is celebrated during the festival of <a href="/wiki/Ayya_vaikundar_avataram" id="w">Ayya vaikundar avataram</a>.</p>
<a id="The_incarnation_of_Ayya_Vaikundar" name="The_incarnation_of_Ayya_Vaikundar"></a><h2> The incarnation of Ayya Vaikundar </h2>
<p>Ayya Vaikundar, who arose from the sea at <a href="/wiki/Thiruchendur" id="w">Thiruchendur</a> on 20th of the Tamil Month of Masi, <i>(March 4<sup>th</sup>, 1833 A.D; <b>3/4/1833</b>)</i> is considered a unique <a href="/wiki/Avatar" id="w">Avatar</a> by the followers of Ayyavazhi. <a href="/wiki/Akilattirattu_Ammanai" id="w">Akilam</a>, speaks about it in great detail, as summarized below: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>In each of the five <a href="/wiki/Yuga" id="w">yugas</a> prior to the transformation of Ayya Vaikundar, as each fragment of <a href="/wiki/Kroni" id="w">Kroni</a> (evil or Devil) came into physical form, the Lord <a href="/wiki/Vishnu" id="w">Vishnu</a> incarnated as well, destroying them. However, in this the sixth yuga, the evil was called <a href="/wiki/Kalineesan" id="w">Kali</a>, (n<i>ot the Hindu deity</i>)<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> and having no physical form (see <a href="/wiki/Pre-Incarnational_Events" id="w">Pre-Incarnational Events</a> for this account) he occupied the mind of people of earth as the Mayai (illusion), causing them to behave discourteously.  <a href="/wiki/Kalineesan" id="w">Kaliyan</a> claimed, it was impossible to destroy him in this <a href="/wiki/Yuga" id="w">yuga</a> as in the previous ones as he held the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Boon">boon</a> from gods, it was impossible for <a href="/wiki/Narayan" id="w">Narayan</a>, or any others, to incarnate in the world to destroy him. 

Since <a href="/wiki/God" id="w">God</a> could not incarnate directly, He incarnated as Ayya Vaikundar in three stages. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>The first stage of Avatar was the born dead child (birth of the Body).</li>
<li>Next, immediately the soul of Sampooranathevan was installed into the body, along with the Spirit (not Soul) of <a href="/wiki/Narayana" id="w">Narayana</a> kept in Parvatha Ucchi Malai (a mythical mountain believed to be in this region) after the completion of the <a href="/wiki/Krishna" id="w">Krishna</a> Avatar. This was the second stage of the Avatar.   </li>
<li>Then in the sea (during the 24th year), the soul of Sampooranathevan was granted <a href="/wiki/Moksha" id="w">moksha</a> (liberation from the cycle of death and birth, synonymous with heaven), unified to the <a href="/wiki/Paramatma" id="w">Ultimate Soul</a>. Now, the Spirit of <a href="/wiki/Narayana" id="w">Narayana</a> along with the <a href="/wiki/Paramatma" id="w">Ultimate Soul</a> (<a href="/wiki/Paramatma" id="w">Paramatma</a>) incarnated in the body of a human being (Muthukutty). <i>(see:<a href="/wiki/Ayyavazhi_mythology#The Incarnation" id="w">The Incarnation</a>)</i> This is the third stage of Avatar and from then he was called Ayya Vaikundar. Then Ayya Vaikundar was given <a href="/wiki/Vinchai" id="w">Vinchai</a> by Narayanar.<i>(see: <a href="/wiki/Vinchai_to_Vaikundar" id="w">Vinchai to Vaikundar</a>)</i>.</li></ul>
<p>According to Ayyavazhi legends Ayya Vaikundar was not merely a human, not merely <a href="/wiki/Narayana" id="w">Narayana</a>, and not merely the <a href="/wiki/Paramatma" id="w">Ultimate Soul</a>, but he was a human and he was the <a href="/wiki/Paramatma" id="w">Ultimate Soul</a> and he was <a href="/wiki/Narayana" id="w">Narayana</a>. He was the one who had the responsibility to destroy the evil.

There is another vew that Vaikundar did not take a human body and showed only a bodily appearance<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> to mankind based upon some quotes in akilam.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>

<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Having reached Poovantanthoppe, (present-day <a href="/wiki/Swamithope" id="w">Swamithope</a>), he undertook to perform a penance. The penance consisted of three stages, each spanning two years. There is a tradition that describes his postures during the six-year tavam as follows: during the first two years, he stood inside a pit of six depth, during the next two years, squatted on the ground, and, during last two years, sat on a raised platform. His appearance was squalid, &#34;long and entangled plait of hair&#34; and frayed clothes. He spoke less and subsisted on frugal meals.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Incinerating_evil_spirits" name="Incinerating_evil_spirits"></a><h2> Incinerating evil spirits </h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Akilattirattu_Ammanai" id="w">Akilattirattu</a> speaks of this act of incinerating the evil spirits as an important event in the incarnation of Ayya Vaikundar. It took place when he was performing his great penance, which had been announced by him to be the means of destroying the <a href="/wiki/Kalimayai" id="w">kalimayai</a> - the illusory evil force.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup>  He, then, gathered the people around, and caused some of them, both male and female, to get possessed of the evil spirits (peyattam).<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> The possessed ones came and danced in front of the crowd as if the evil spirits had come upon them. Vaikundar, then, ordered these evil spirits to make an oath, in front of the people, to surrender their powers and get burned up in flames. When he had finished his orders, those dancing under the duress of possession got exhausted and fell flat on the ground. Thus the evil spirits were incinerated.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>Similarly, Vaikundar performed another action to &#39;seize the esoteric evil powers&#39;. Akilam says that, he took away the powers of those who knew to perform witchcraft, sorcery, and other magical rituals. People living in the hills, called as Kanikkarar, were believed to be powerful shamans or witchdoctors, having powers to contain or to provoke the demons. Vaikundar, in a trance, made some of these Kanikkarar to testify in front of the people that they had surrendered their powers. People grew appreciative of Ayya&#39;s actions. They began addressing him as Vaikuntacami. This implied an attribution of divinity to Vaikundar.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>   <a href="/wiki/Vaikundar" id="w">Vaikundar</a> exhorted the people as follows:</p>
<p><i>&#34;There are no demons, no devils,
No ill effects of magical practices,
No disease, no pain, and no extortion of taxes,
And, therefore, live courageously.&#34;</i></p>

The fame of Vaikundar had begun to spread in the countries of <a href="/wiki/Travancore" id="w">Travancore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tirunelveli" id="w">Tirunelveli</a>, and he had been gradually recognised socially as a religious person with extraordinary powers.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> In the religious parlance of the time, he was addressed as a <a href="/wiki/Pantaram" id="w">Pantaram</a>, a religious person hailing from, and serving the ordinary folk. Akilattirattu addresses him as NarayanaPantaram.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> </p>
<p>People came to him to listen to his teachings and instructions, to be cured by him of different diseases, to witness, worship and serve a religious person. Vaikundar encouraged the people to come together around a well to take a ritual bath, irrespective of caste differences. He encouraged them to dine together in his presence.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>He gave out a number of teachings and instructions, the central point of which was that he had come to abolish <a href="/wiki/Kali_Yukam" id="w">Kali Yukam</a>, and to usher in an age of <a href="/wiki/Dharma_Yukam" id="w">Dharma Yukam</a>, during the time of which the now-oppressed and suffering people would be liberated and rule the land under his leadership. &#39;Uplift of the lowly is dharmam’<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> was a constant refrain in his teachings.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> People were encouraged to serve as catalysts for the destruction of <a href="/wiki/Kaliyan" id="w">Kali</a> by transforming themselves to be &#39;people of Dharma Yukam&#39; and to acquire a new character. The new character would come upon them, he said, if they learned to live with self-respect, social dignity and fearlessness. Underscoring the importance of self-respect and social dignity, he said,  ‘if one lives with dignity and self-respect, the kali would destroy itself’ .   He said when people grew out of <a href="/wiki/Kalimayai" id="w">kalimayai</a>, Dharma Yukam would unfold itself and in that age, he would rule over the people as <a href="/wiki/Dharma_Raja" id="w">Dharma Raja</a>, the king of Dharma Yukam.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Ordeals" name="Ordeals"></a><h2> Ordeals </h2>
<p>Against the background of the growing popularity of Vaikundar, and the convergence of people around him in multitudes, a complaint seems to have been lodged against him with the <a href="/wiki/Swathi_Thirunal_Rama_Varma" id="w">king of Travancore</a>. The king arrested Vaikundar and tortured him.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> There is an opinion that Ayya was arrested on 11 November, 1839.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> But the date is not mentioned in Akilam. </p>

<a id="Attaining_Vaikundam" name="Attaining_Vaikundam"></a><h2> Attaining Vaikundam </h2>
<p>Later Vaikundar was invited by his devotees to their homes and treated in a grand manner. By way of soliciting his blessings, his devotees carried him to different places. During these occasions, he laid foundations in various places for small shrine-like centres, called as <a href="/wiki/Nizhal_Thangal" id="w">Nizhal Thangals</a>. Vaikundar came to recognize five individuals as his closest disciples. Through one of his disciples, <a href="/wiki/Hari_Gopalan_Citar" id="w">Hari Gopalan Citar</a>, he wrote the holy book, called <a href="/wiki/Akilattirattu_Ammanai" id="w">Akilam</a>.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/3_June" id="w">3 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1851" id="w">1851</a>, (malayalam era 1026 Vaikasi,21) Vaikundar attained Vaikundam <i>(see also:<a href="/wiki/Ayyavazhi_mythology#Ascending to Vaikundam.2C the abode of Thirumal" id="w">Attaining Vaikundam</a>)</i>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> But How ever Samuel Mateer mentions the year as 1848.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> But today most of the historians opinins it as it is mentioned in Akilam. As he attained Vaikundam his body was interned in a tomb and, around that, a pati (temple) was raised later on. His devotees continued to visit this site, and performed the rituals as they used to do when Vaikundar was bodily present. His life and works remain the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/Ayyavazhi" id="w">Ayyavazhi</a>.
