<p>The use of poison varies greatly. Historically, its employment in assassination and homicide incited fear in the public. Other times, it has been used for political implosion and elements of <a href="/wiki/Espionage" id="w">espionage</a>. </p>
<p>In the present day, poison is still used for a variety of mostly mundane purposes involving <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" id="w">agriculture</a> and food preservation, but is also still used for the starker purposes of murder. Due to more modern-day technology, however, poisons can be more easily detected.</p>

<a href="/wiki/Archaeology" id="w">Archaeological</a> findings provide proof that, while <a href="/wiki/Human_evolution" id="w">primitive mankind</a> used conventional weapons such as axes and clubs, and later swords, they probably sought more subtle, destructive means of causing <a href="/wiki/Death" id="w">death</a>—something that could be achieved through poison.<sup id="_ref-ancient_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ancient" title="">[2]</a></sup>
Grooves for storing or holding poisons such as <a href="/wiki/Tubocurarine" id="w">tubocurarine</a> have been found in their hunting weapons and tools, showing that early humans had discovered poisons of varying potency and been applying them to their weapons.<sup id="_ref-ancient_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ancient" title="">[2]</a></sup> Some speculate that this use and existence of these strange and noxious substances would have been kept within the more important and higher-ranked members of a <a href="/wiki/Tribe" id="w">tribe</a> or <a href="/wiki/Clan" id="w">clan</a>, and were seen as emblems of a greater power.

</p><a id="Egypt" name="Egypt"></a><h3> Egypt </h3>
<p>Unlike many civilizations, records of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">Egyptian</a> knowledge and use of poisons can only be dated back to approx. <a href="/wiki/300_BCE" id="w">300 BCE</a>. However, it is believed that the earliest known Egyptian <a href="/wiki/Pharaoh" id="w">pharaoh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Menes" id="w">Menes</a>, studied the properties of poisonous plants and venoms, according to early records.<sup id="_ref-ancient_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ancient" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Before this, however, evidence of poison-related knowledge in Egypt can be traced to the writings of an ancient Egyptian alchemist, <a href="/wiki/Agathodiamon" id="w">Agathodiamon</a> (100BC approx.), who spoke of an (unidentified) mineral that when mixed with <a href="/wiki/Natron" id="w">natron</a> produced a &#39;fiery poison&#39;. He described this poison as &#39;disappearing in water&#39;, giving a clear solution. This &#39;fiery poison&#39; may exist as the roots for some of the later poisons that were invisible when mixed with water, and indicates that such an elusive poison may have been available to some civilisations such as Egypt as early as <a href="/wiki/100_BC" id="w">100 BC</a>.<sup id="_ref-Emsley p.2-3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Emsley p.2-3" title="">[15]</a></sup>
As to the &#39;fiery poison&#39; which this alchemist had concocted, it appears that he must surely have created arsenic trioxide, the unidentified mineral having to have been either <a href="/wiki/Realgar" id="w">realgar</a> or <a href="/wiki/Orpiment" id="w">orpiment</a>, due to the relation between the unidentified mineral and his other writings. <sup id="_ref-Emsley p.2-3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Emsley p.2-3" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Egyptians are also thought to have come into knowledge about elements such as <a href="/wiki/Antimony" id="w">antimony</a>, <a href="/wiki/Copper" id="w">copper</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" id="w">crude arsenic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lead" id="w">lead</a>, <a href="/wiki/Opium" id="w">opium</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mandrake_(plant)" id="w">mandrake</a> (among others).

<p>In Roman times, poisoning carried out at the dinner table or common eating or drinking area was not unheard of, or probably even uncommon, and was happening as early as <a href="/wiki/331_BC" id="w">331 BC</a>.<sup id="_ref-ancient_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ancient" title="">[2]</a></sup> These poisonings would have been used for self-advantageous reasons in every class of the social order.

<a id="Europe" name="Europe"></a><h3>Europe</h3>
<p>Later, in Europe during the Middle Ages, when the nature of poisons were known better than simply <a href="/wiki/Magic_(paranormal)" id="w">magic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Witchcraft" id="w">witchcraft</a>, there were sellers and suppliers of <a href="/wiki/Potion" id="w">potions</a> and poisons, known as <a href="/wiki/Apothecaries" id="w">apothecaries</a>.<sup id="_ref-medieval_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-medieval" title="">[20]</a></sup> Despite the fact that the medicinal uses of poisons were now known, it was no secret that people bought poisons for less useful and lawful reasons.

<p>At the same time, in other areas of the world, the technological advancement of poisons was expanding, and, in the <a href="/wiki/Arab" id="w">Arab</a> nations, some had succeeded in making arsenic transparent, odourless and tasteless when applied to a drink, a method which would allow poison murderers to remain undetected for at least one millennia.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>An excerpt from <a href="/wiki/Chaucer" id="w">Chaucer</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales" id="w">The Canterbury Tales</a></i>, a text that existed sometime in the <a href="/wiki/14th_century" id="w">14th century</a> to the <a href="/wiki/15th_century" id="w">15th century</a> describes a killer buying poison from an apothecary to rid a <a href="/wiki/Rat" id="w">rat</a> infestation:</p>

<p>This is one example of a large <a href="/wiki/Literature" id="w">literature</a> related to poison, and poisons and potions were a very popular subject in fiction. There were also academic texts discussing the subject, and both <a href="/wiki/Non-fiction" id="w">non-fiction</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fiction" id="w">fiction</a> were written for the most part by <a href="/wiki/Monk" id="w">monks</a>, whose <a href="/wiki/Knowledge" id="w">knowledge</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wisdom" id="w">wisdom</a> were respected, and as such authored a large portion of published works.<sup id="_ref-medieval_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-medieval" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>One example of a non-fiction work is <i>The Book of Venoms</i>, a book describing the known poisons of the time, their effects and uses, written by Magister Santes de Ardoynis in 1424. It also recommended the best known treatments for a given poison.
Despite this, it is considered probable that these factual works were not released to the <a href="/wiki/Public" id="w">public</a>, but kept within appropriate learned circles for study and research.<sup id="_ref-medieval_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-medieval" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>The troubled 14th and 15th centuries in <a href="/wiki/Rajasthan" id="w">Rajasthan</a>, India saw invasions in the <a href="/wiki/Rajput" id="w">Rajput</a> heartlands. Rajput women practiced a custom of <i>jauhar</i> ( literally <i>the taking of life</i>) when their sons, brothers, or husbands faced certain death in battle. <i>Jauhar</i> was practiced within the <i><a href="/wiki/Kshatriya" id="w">Kshatriya</a></i> warrior class to avoid the fate of subservience, slavery, rape, or slaughter at the hands of the invading forces.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Public_reaction" name="Public_reaction"></a><h4> Public reaction </h4>
<p>If the truth was indeed kept from the public, it did not prevent the spawning of <a href="/wiki/Folk-lore" id="w">folklore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rumors" id="w">rumors</a> about poisons, and use of them for purposes that were distasteful to the public. This caused a level of <a href="/wiki/Paranoia" id="w">paranoia</a> within some areas of the societies of <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>.<sup id="_ref-medieval_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-medieval" title="">[20]</a></sup> This wave of concern was furthered by the availability of &#39;medicine&#39; potent enough to be lethal when secretly administered in sufficient quantity - it provided an easy way to kill, and one which was subtle, quiet, and generally allowed the criminal to remain undetected.<sup id="_ref-medieval_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-medieval" title="">[20]</a></sup>
Perhaps it was this wave of paranoia that swept the streets, or the public need for answers about these toxins, but books about ways of counteracting poisons became sought for, and fed off the mounting anxiety, even though generally being wholly inaccurate.<sup id="_ref-medieval_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-medieval" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Naturally, crafty book salesmen would have sought to inflame the issue as a marketing ploy, and exaggerate the risk so that people would buy their books in search of a non-existent security. Other salesmen such as <a href="/wiki/Jewelry" id="w">jewelry</a> traders offering a supposedly poison-weakening <a href="/wiki/Amulet" id="w">amulet</a>, or a <a href="/wiki/Physician" id="w">doctor</a> selling a magical cure would have profited greatly in such times of doubt.
The information the public craved was kept from them, a treasure only for scholars and scientists, and so the public was left to make their own assumptions.<sup id="_ref-medieval_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-medieval" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Persia" name="Persia"></a><h3> Persia </h3>
<p>Despite the negative effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example can be found in the works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar <a href="/wiki/Rhazes" id="w">Rhazes</a>, writer of <i>Secret of Secrets</i>, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a <a href="/wiki/Laxative" id="w">laxative</a>. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as &#39;the <a href="/wiki/Itch" id="w">itch</a>&#39;, which is now referred to as <a href="/wiki/Scabies" id="w">scabies</a>. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury&#39;s poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch. <sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Renaissance" name="Renaissance"></a><h2> Renaissance </h2>
<p>By the <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" id="w">Renaissance</a>, the use of poisons for unlawful and reprehensible intentions had peaked; it was arguably becoming any assassin or murderer&#39;s essential tool.<sup id="_ref-Renaissance_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Renaissance" title="">[25]</a></sup> This peaking of poison&#39;s popularity within crime syndicates and circles would probably have been due at least in part to the new discoveries that were then being made about poison.<sup id="_ref-Renaissance_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Renaissance" title="">[25]</a></sup>

Borgia was notorious not only for being the son of a very controversial man, but also because he was thought to be a poison-wielding murderer.<sup id="_ref-Renaissance_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Renaissance" title="">[25]</a></sup> In the following quote, <a href="/wiki/Apollinaire" id="w">Apollinaire</a> describes what he believes is a kind of &#39;Borgia Recipe&#39; used for the disposing of victims:</p>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>After the death of Cesare Borgia&#39;s father, many rumors circulated proposing several theories about the cause, although most ended with the Pope having died in some horrible way involving murder, usually by poisoning.</p>
<p>Apollinaire&#39;s idea was that the pope was poisoned by wine which was in fact intended for another at the dinner table, <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_de_Corneto" id="w">Cardinal de Corneto</a>. <a href="/wiki/Sanuto" id="w">Sanuto</a> held a similar theory, except that it involved a box of sweetmeats, instead of wine.<sup id="_ref-Renaissance_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Renaissance" title="">[25]</a></sup>
The death of the pope elicited little mourning, which was expected after the debased standards of his tenure. Historical evidence suggests that the pope was indeed poisoned in some way; when his body was exhibited, it was in a shocking state of decomposition. To reduce suspicion, it was only on display at night by candlelight.<sup id="_ref-Renaissance_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Renaissance" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cesare Borgia&#39;s passing did not cause much sadness either, a result of the reputation that he had forged for himself. However, his sister <a href="/wiki/Lucrezia_Borgia" id="w">Lucrezia</a> did mourn for this man who had been accused of so many crimes. Lucrezia was also considered a wrongdoer, but may in fact have been held responsible for some of Cesare&#39;s misdeeds.<sup id="_ref-Renaissance_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Renaissance" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_Council_of_Ten" name="The_Council_of_Ten"></a><h3> The Council of Ten </h3>
<p>By the 1600s, the use of poison had become an art of sorts, and, in several cities of <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a> including <a href="/wiki/Venice" id="w">Venice</a> and Rome, there were actual schools teaching the ways of poison and the &#39;art&#39; which had been born.<sup id="_ref-Renaisance2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Renaisance2" title="">[26]</a></sup>
Earlier, in the fifteenth century, a guild of alchemists and poisoners known as the Council of Ten was formed. This <a href="/wiki/Cult" id="w">cult</a> of poison-wielding assassins carried out contracts for people who paid them enough money, and usually anyone contracted for death ended up slain, killed by an undetected dose of lethal substances of varying description.<sup id="_ref-Renaisance2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Renaisance2" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<a id="''Neopoliani_Magioe_Naturalis''" name="''Neopoliani_Magioe_Naturalis''"></a><h3> &#39;&#39;Neopoliani Magioe Naturalis&#39;&#39; </h3>
<p><i>Neopoliani Magioe Naturalis</i> was a publication first printed just before <a href="/wiki/1590" id="w">1590</a> that detailed the art of poisoning, and effective methods of using poison to commit homicide. The most effective way of killing someone with poison, according to the work, was by drugging someone&#39;s wine, a method that was very popular at the time.<sup id="_ref-Renaisance2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Renaisance2" title="">[26]</a></sup>
One &#39;very strong mixture&#39; used in the book is the <i>Veninum Lupinum</i>, which consists of a mix of aconite, <a href="/wiki/Taxus_baccata" id="w">taxus baccata</a>, <a href="/wiki/Caustic_lime" id="w">caustic lime</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arsenic" id="w">arsenic</a>, bitter <a href="/wiki/Almonds" id="w">almonds</a> and powdered <a href="/wiki/Glass" id="w">glass</a> mixed with honey.

<a id="16th%E2%80%9318th_centuries" name="16th%E2%80%9318th_centuries"></a><h2> 16th–18th centuries </h2>
<p>By the end of the <a href="/wiki/16th_century" id="w">16th century</a>, the art and popularity of poison had moved from Italy to <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>, where criminal poisoning was becoming more and more frequent. It is estimated that in the 1570s that there would have been about thirty thousand people in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> alone using poison or having some connection to poison in an illegal or immoral way.<sup id="_ref-later_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-later" title="">[27]</a></sup> It was becoming something of which was described as a &#39;plague&#39; or &#39;epidemic&#39;.<sup id="_ref-later_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-later" title="">[27]</a></sup>
And this epidemic, while obviously contributing greatly to the death toll, was also greatly affecting citizens who had no connection to poison.
Many people, nobles especially, were becoming extremely afraid of poisoning. They would attend dinner parties of only the most trusted, and hired only hand-picked servants. 
Several instances very famous or high-born people who were very afraid of poisoning are both <a href="/wiki/Henrietta_Anne_Stuart" id="w">Henrietta Anne of England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Henry_IV" id="w">Henry IV</a>.<sup id="_ref-later_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-later" title="">[27]</a></sup>
The princess Henrietta Anne of England was so fearful and aware of poisoning that she instantly made the assumption that she had been poisoned when she was afflicted with a peritonitis due to a duodenal ulcer, while Henry IV, while making a visit to the <a href="/wiki/Louvre" id="w">Louvre</a>, was recorded to have eaten only eggs that he had cooked himself, and drank only water that he had poured for himself.<sup id="_ref-later_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-later" title="">[27]</a></sup> 
Later, in 1662, Louis XIV limited the sale of poisons within apothecaries, and certain poisons were not to be sold, except to people whom the shopkeeper knew well to be trustworthy.<sup id="_ref-later_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-later" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Trustworthy alchemists did, however, become hard to find during this period; many of them were <a href="/wiki/Con_men" id="w">con men</a>, fooling both their patrons and the public at large into believing that <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" id="w">Mercury</a>, thought then to be something of a &#39;core&#39; element - one of which all others were invariably composed - was convertible into gold and other fine metals. While many took advantage of this belief, others genuinely, in the name of science, attempted to make gold out of less valuable and duller elements. Such of these alchemists were driven towards the same goal of attaining three objects of high desire within alchemical circles: the Philiosopher&#39;s Stone, able to change <a href="/wiki/Base_metal" id="w">base metals</a> into pure gold; the <a href="/wiki/Elixir_of_Life" id="w">Elixir of Life</a>, which lengthened one&#39;s life expansively, and finally, the <a href="/wiki/Alkahest" id="w">Alkahest</a>, a substance which was capable of dissolving anything. The pursuit of these goals, as fantastical, but scientifically supported as it was, retarded greatly the progress of alchemical science, as these goals were ultimately impossible to realise. <sup id="_ref-Emsley p.2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Emsley p.2" title="">[21]</a></sup>

<a id="Chambre_Ardente" name="Chambre_Ardente"></a><h3> Chambre Ardente </h3>
<p>At a similar time to the ban of poisons, priests in <a href="/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Paris" id="w">Notre Dame</a> became so astounded with the number of poison-related confessions that they had listened to that they decided to inform the king about how bad the &#39;epidemic&#39; of poison actually was. In response to this, the king organized an order dedicated to the investigation of poisonings called the <i><a href="/wiki/Chambre_Ardente" id="w">Chambre Ardente</a></i>, and the investigation itself became known as the <i><a href="/wiki/Poison_Affair" id="w">affaire des poisons</a></i>.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the inquisitors had been sponsored by the sovereign himself, they failed to catch many of the worst and most murderous poisoners, in whom probably had many connections in which were employed to evade punishment. However, in the life of the order, approximately 442 persons were caught and received punishment.<sup id="_ref-later_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-later" title="">[27]</a></sup>
The work of this order did cause a backfiring, or side effect that was a magnifying in the interest of poison and how to use them, and, inexplicably, many people actually became actively involved in poison after the birth of an order made to reduce poisonings.<sup id="_ref-later_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-later" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>

<a id="In_Spain" name="In_Spain"></a><h3> In Spain </h3>
<p>While criminals based in Italy and England were the first to introduce poison as a means of murder or harm, during this period the use of poison truly was spreading all over Europe.
<a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire" id="w">Spain</a> was notable for the fact that it had, by some means or another, committed several failed attempts at the disposal of <a href="/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_of_England" id="w">Queen Elizabeth of England</a>.<sup id="_ref-later_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-later" title="">[27]</a></sup>
One person named Dr. <a href="/wiki/Rodrigo_Lopez" id="w">Rodrigo Lopez</a>, a Jewish physician, was called on by Spain to kill the queen, but he was caught and then later hanged, drawn and quartered for the act, though Elizabeth herself and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Cecil" id="w">Robert Cecil</a> doubted his guilt. It is thought that some aspects, specifically a character, of <a href="/wiki/Shakespeare" id="w">Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice" id="w">The Merchant of Venice</a></i> may refer to or have been inspired by this Dr. Lopez.
After this particular incident, the queen&#39;s food had to be tasted for poisoning, and greater security was put into effect. She was even known to have taken antidotes on a weekly basis for protection.</p>
<p>Conversely, royal assassination attempts by poison were also domestic in Spain, with several people and groups wanting to kill the monarchs. One successful attempt at this (probable one of few in Europe) was the poisoning of <a href="/wiki/Maria_Luisa_of_Orl%C3%A9ans" id="w">Marie Louise</a>, the wife of <a href="/wiki/Charles_II_of_Spain" id="w">Carlos II</a>, who died suddenly in September <a href="/wiki/1689" id="w">1689</a>.<sup id="_ref-later_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-later" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<a id="20th_century" name="20th_century"></a><h2> 20th century </h2>
<p>The same trend continued through the <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era" id="w">Victorian era</a>, and was still labelled as an epidemic of sorts, and with poison still being considered one of the easiest and simplest ways to commit murder.<sup id="_ref-Vic_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vic" title="">[28]</a></sup> 
However, several changes occurred in the Victorian era, such as the rise of the <a href="/wiki/Life_insurance" id="w">life insurance</a> <a href="/wiki/Industry" id="w">industry</a>, made poisoning the &#39;fashionable&#39; crime considering the guaranteed and lucrative profit in the killing of a life-ensured relative with a large price on their head.<sup id="_ref-Vic_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vic" title="">[28]</a></sup>
But as the move into the 1900s occurred, the technology of preventing poisoning became better and more efficient, and criminal poisoning become much harder than in previous centuries.<sup id="_ref-twenty_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-twenty" title="">[29]</a></sup> 
Criminal poisoning had to be made cleaner and better planned to match the ever-advancing technologies employed against would-be poisoners.<sup id="_ref-twenty_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-twenty" title="">[29]</a></sup>
However, because of a wider range of educated people, more people were able to understand how to use poison and were intelligent or skilled enough to plan out a logical poison-induced murder, whereas in past times, usually only a select few knowledgeable people knew enough to conduct a successful homicide.<sup id="_ref-twenty_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-twenty" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Old_poisons" name="Old_poisons"></a><h3> Old poisons </h3>
<p>Poison used in the past were also present in 20th-century murders. In the early 20th century, arsenic was often used, but during the mid-century, cyanide became quite popular. It was used during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> by captured agents of the Resistance as a means of suicide to escape the heinous torture of their enemies.<sup id="_ref-twenty_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-twenty" title="">[29]</a></sup> Nazi war leader <a href="/wiki/Herman_Goering" id="w">Herman Goering</a> even used it to kill himself the night before he was supposed to be hanged during the <a href="/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials" id="w">Nuremberg Trials</a>.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a> had also taken a pill of <a href="/wiki/Cyanide" id="w">cyanide</a> shortly before the fall of <a href="/wiki/Berlin" id="w">Berlin</a> along with his wife, <a href="/wiki/Eva_Braun" id="w">Eva Braun</a>.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, new poisons later became more used, so as to outmatch the knowledge of the current toxicology field of science. In this way, wielding a new and unknown poison, a poisoner could kill someone, and the death might be mistaken as an unfortunate case of a rare <a href="/wiki/Illness" id="w">illness</a>.<sup id="_ref-twenty_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-twenty" title="">[29]</a></sup>
This put a new strain on toxicology and other branches dealing with poison, and they were forced to work hard to keep up with the criminals who were using poisons that they had never previously encountered.</p>
<a id="Present_day" name="Present_day"></a><h2> Present day </h2>
<p>In the late 20th century, an increasing number of products used for everyday life proved to be poisonous. The risk of being poisoned nowadays lies more in the accidental factor, where poison be induced or taken by accident. These problems occur more frequently in <a href="/wiki/Children" id="w">children</a>, and poisoning is the 4th most common cause of death within young people. Accidental ingestions are most common in children less than 5 years old.</p>
<p>However, <a href="/wiki/Hospital" id="w">hospital</a> and emergency facilities are much enhanced compared to the first half of the 20th century and before,
and antidotes are more available.
Antidotes have been found for many poisons, and the antidotes for some of the most commonly known poisons are shown in the table below: </p>

<p>However, poison still exists as a murderous entity today, but, for a variety of reasons, it is not as popular form of conducting murder as it used to be in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration. </p>

<a id="Uses_in_the_modern_day" name="Uses_in_the_modern_day"></a><h3> Uses in the modern day </h3>
<p>Today, poison is used for a wider variety of purposes than it used to be.
Quite often, poison can be used to rid an unwanted infestation by pests or to kill weeds and such, and provides perhaps the most effective way of destroying an <a href="/wiki/Infestation" id="w">infestation</a>.</p>
<p>These chemicals, known as <a href="/wiki/Pesticide" id="w">pesticides</a>,<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> have been known to have been used in some form since about <a href="/wiki/2500_BC" id="w">2500 BC</a>, but the use of pesticides has increased staggeringly from <a href="/wiki/1950" id="w">1950</a>, and presently approximately 2.5 <a href="/wiki/Million" id="w">million</a> tons of industrial pesticides are used each year. <sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Certain poisons can also be used to <a href="/wiki/Food_preservation" id="w">preserve foods</a> and building material. For safety and <a href="/wiki/Health" id="w">health</a> reasons, the poisons that are used for these purposes are usually found to be somewhat less poisonous than poisons used for weed killing and infestation ridding.</p>
<a id="Poison_in_other_cultures_today" name="Poison_in_other_cultures_today"></a><h3> Poison in other cultures today </h3>
<p>Today, in many developing peoples of countries and nations such as Africa, South America and certain parts of Asia, the use of poison as an actual weapon of hunting and attack still endures.
In Africa, certain arrow poisons are made using floral ingredients, such as of that taken from the plant <i>Acokanthera</i>. This plant contains <a href="/wiki/Ouabain" id="w">ouabain</a>, which is a cardiac glycoside, <a href="/wiki/Oleander" id="w">oleander</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Milkweed" id="w">milkweeds</a>.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup>
Poisoned arrows are also still used in the jungle areas of <a href="/wiki/Assam" id="w">Assam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Burma" id="w">Burma</a> and <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" id="w">Malaysia</a>. The ingredients for the creation of these poisons are mainly extracted from plants of the <i><a href="/wiki/Antiaris" id="w">Antiaris</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Strychnos" id="w">Strychnos</a></i> and <i>Strophanthus</i> genera, and <i><a href="/wiki/Antiaris_toxicaria" id="w">Antiaris toxicaria</a></i> (a tree of the <a href="/wiki/Mulberry" id="w">mulberry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Breadfruit" id="w">breadfruit</a> family), for example, is used in the Java island of Indonesia, as well as several of its surrounding islands.
The juice or liquid extracts are smeared on the head of the arrow, and inflicts the target <a href="/wiki/Paralysis" id="w">paralysis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Convulsions" id="w">convulsions</a> and/or <a href="/wiki/Cardiac_arrest" id="w">cardiac arrest</a>, virtually on strike due to the speed in which the extracts can effect a victim.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>As well as plant based poisons, there are others that are made that are based on animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a <a href="/wiki/Beetle" id="w">beetle</a> genus of the Northern <a href="/wiki/Kalahari_Desert" id="w">Kalahari Desert</a> is used to create a slow-acting poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an <a href="/wiki/Adhesive" id="w">adhesive</a>. However, instead of the plant sap, a <a href="/wiki/Powder_(substance)" id="w">powder</a> made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
