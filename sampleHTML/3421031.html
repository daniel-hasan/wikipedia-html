At the time of <a href="/wiki/Indian_independence" id="w">Indian independence</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> was divided into two sets of territories, the first being the territories under the control of the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British Empire</a>, and the second being the territories over which <a href="/wiki/The_Crown" id="w">the Crown</a> had <a href="/wiki/Suzerainty" id="w">suzerainty</a>, but which were under the control of their hereditary rulers.  In addition, there were several colonial enclaves controlled by <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> and <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portugal</a>.  The <b>political integration</b> of these territories into <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> was a declared objective of the <a href="/wiki/Indian_National_Congress" id="w">Indian National Congress</a>, which the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_India" id="w">Government of India</a> pursued over the next decade.  Through a combination of factors, <a href="/wiki/Vallabhbhai_Patel" id="w">Vallabhbhai Patel</a> and <a href="/wiki/V.P._Menon" id="w">V.P. Menon</a> convinced the rulers of the various <a href="/wiki/Princely_states" id="w">princely states</a> to accede to India.  Having secured their accession, they then proceeded to, in a step-by-step process, secure and extend the central government&#39;s authority over these states and transform their <a href="/wiki/Administration" id="w">administration</a> until, by 1956, there was little difference between the territories that had formerly been part of <a href="/wiki/British_India" id="w">British India</a> and those that had been part of princely states.  Simultaneously, the Government of India through a combination of <a href="/wiki/Diplomatic" id="w">diplomatic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Military" id="w">military</a> means acquired <a href="/wiki/De_facto" id="w">de facto</a> and <a href="/wiki/De_jure" id="w">de jure</a> control over the remaining colonial enclaves, which too were integrated into India.</p>
<p>Although this process successfully integrated the vast majority of princely states into India, it was not as successful in relation to a few states, notably the former princely states of <a href="/wiki/Kashmir" id="w">Kashmir</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tripura" id="w">Tripura</a> and <a href="/wiki/Manipur" id="w">Manipur</a>, where active secessionist movements exist.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The British-ruled <a href="/wiki/Madras_Province" id="w">Madras Province</a> and adjacent princely states</div>
The early history of British expansion in India was characterised by the co-existence of two approaches towards the existing princely states.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The first was a policy of annexation, where the British sought to forcibly absorb the Indian princely states into the provinces which constituted their <a href="/wiki/British_India" id="w">Empire in India</a>.  The second was a policy of indirect rule, where the British assumed <a href="/wiki/Suzerainty" id="w">suzerainty</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paramountcy" id="w">paramountcy</a> over princely states, but conceded some degree of sovereignty to them.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>   During the early part of the nineteenth century, the policy of the British tended towards annexation, but the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857" id="w">Indian Rebellion of 1857</a> forced a change in this approach, by demonstrating both the difficulty of absorbing and subduing annexed states, and the usefulness of princely states as a source of support.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  In 1858, the policy of annexation was formally renounced, and British relations with the princely states thereafter were based on <a href="/wiki/Indirect_rule" id="w">indirect rule</a>, whereby the British exercised paramountcy over all princely states with the <a href="/wiki/British_crown" id="w">British crown</a> as ultimate <a href="/wiki/Suzerain" id="w">suzerain</a>, but at the same time respected and protected them as allies.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> The exact relations between the British and each princely state were regulated by individual treaties, and varied widely, with some states having significant autonomy, some being subject to significant control in internal affairs, and some being in effect the owners of a few acres of land with little autonomy.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>During the 20th century, the British made several attempts to integrate the princely states more closely with British India, creating the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Princes" id="w">Chamber of Princes</a> in 1921 as a consultative and advisory body,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> transferring the responsibility for supervision of smaller states from the provinces to the centre in 1936, and creating direct relations between the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_India" id="w">Government of India</a> and the larger princely states superseding political agents.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>  The most ambitious was a scheme of federation in the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_India_Act%2C_1935" id="w">Government of India Act, 1935</a>, which envisaged the princely states and British India being united under a federal government.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> This scheme came close to success, but was abandoned in 1939 as a result of the outbreak of the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> As a result, in the 1940s, the relationship between the princely states and the crown remained regulated by the principle of paramountcy and the various treaties between the British crown and the states.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Neither paramountcy nor these arrangements could continue after <a href="/wiki/Indian_independence" id="w">Indian independence</a>.  The British took the view that because they had been established directly between the British crown and the princely states, they could not be transferred to independent India.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup>  At the same time, they imposed obligations on Britain that it was not prepared to continue to carry out, such as the obligation to maintain troops in India for the <a href="/wiki/Defence" id="w">defence</a> of the princely states.  The British government therefore decided that paramountcy, together with all treaties between them and the princely states, would come to an end upon the transfer of power.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

The termination of paramountcy would have in principle have meant that all rights that flowed from the states&#39; relationship with the British crown would return to them, leaving them free to negotiate relationships with the new states of India and Pakistan &#34;on a basis of complete freedom.&#34;<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Early British plans for the transfer of power, such as the offer produced by the <a href="/wiki/Cripps_Mission" id="w">Cripps Mission</a>, recognised the possibility that some princely states might choose to stand out of independent India.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>  This was unacceptable to the <a href="/wiki/Indian_National_Congress" id="w">Congress</a>, which regarded the independence of princely states as a denial of the course of Indian history, and consequently regarded this scheme as a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Balkanisation" id="w">Balkanisation</a>&#34; of India.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> The Congress had traditionally been less active in the princely states because of their limited resources which restricted their ability to organise there and their focus on the goal of independence from the British,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> and because Congress leaders, in particular <a href="/wiki/Gandhi" id="w">Gandhi</a>,<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> were sympathetic to the more progressive princes as examples of the capacity of Indians to rule themselves.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> This changed in the 1930s as a result of the federation scheme contained in the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_India_Act%2C_1935" id="w">Government of India Act, 1935</a> and the rise of socialist Congress leaders such as <a href="/wiki/Jayaprakash_Narayan" id="w">Jayaprakash Narayan</a>, and the Congress began to actively engage with popular political and labour activity in the princely states.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>  By 1939, the Congress&#39; official stance was that the states must enter independent India, on the same terms and with the same autonomy as the provinces of British India, and with their people granted responsible government.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> As a result, it insisted on the incorporation of the princely states into India in its negotiations with Mountbatten.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>A few British leaders, particularly <a href="/wiki/Lord_Mountbatten" id="w">Lord Mountbatten</a>, the last British viceroy in India, were also uncomfortable with breaking links between independent India and the princely states.  The development of trade, commerce and communications during the 19th and 20th centuries had bound the princely states to British India through a complex network of interests.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup>  Agreements relating to railways, customs, irrigation, the use of ports, and other similar agreements would disappear, posing a serious threat to the economic life of the subcontinent.  Mountbatten was also persuaded by the argument of Indian leaders such as <a href="/wiki/V.P._Menon" id="w">V.P. Menon</a> that the integration of the princely states into independent India would to some extent assuage the wounds of <a href="/wiki/Partition_of_India" id="w">partition</a>.  The result was that Mountbatten personally favoured and worked towards the <a href="/wiki/Accession" id="w">accession</a> of princely states to India following the transfer of power, as proposed by the Congress.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

<a id="The_princes'_position" name="The_princes'_position"></a><h3> The princes&#39; position </h3>

<p>The rulers of the princely states were not uniformly enthusiastic about integrating their domains into independent India.  Some, such as the kings of  Bikaner and Jawhar, were motivated to join India out of ideological and patriotic considerations,<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> but others insisted that they had the right to join either India or Pakistan, to remain independent, or form a union of their own.<sup id="_ref-Ramu273_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ramu273" title="">[25]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Bhopal" id="w">Bhopal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Travancore" id="w">Travancore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hyderabad_state" id="w">Hyderabad</a> announced that they did not intend to join either dominion.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Hyderabad went as far as to appoint trade representatives in European countries and commencing negotiations with the <a href="/wiki/Portugal" id="w">Portuguese</a> to lease or buy <a href="/wiki/Goa" id="w">Goa</a> to give it access to the sea,<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> and Travancore pointed to the strategic importance to western countries of its <a href="/wiki/Thorium" id="w">thorium</a> reserves while asking for recognition.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup>  Some states proposed a subcontinent-wide confederation of princely states, as a third entity in addition to India and Pakistan.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>  Bhopal attempted to build an alliance between the princely states and the <a href="/wiki/Muslim_League" id="w">Muslim League</a> to counter the pressure being put on rulers by the Congress.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>A number of factors contributed to the collapse of this initial resistance and to nearly all princely states agreeing to accede to India.  An important factor was the lack of unity amongst the princes.  The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many <a href="/wiki/Hindu" id="w">Hindu</a> rulers did not trust <a href="/wiki/Muslim" id="w">Muslim</a> princes, in particular <a href="/wiki/Hamidullah_Khan" id="w">Hamidullah Khan</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Nawab_of_Bhopal" id="w">Nawab of Bhopal</a> and a leading proponent of independence, who they viewed as an agent for <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a>.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup>  Others, believing integration inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> The decision by the Muslim League to stay out of the <a href="/wiki/Constituent_Assembly" id="w">Constituent Assembly</a> was also fatal to the princes&#39; plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress,<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on <a href="/wiki/28_April" id="w">28 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a>, when the states of <a href="/wiki/Baroda" id="w">Baroda</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bikaner" id="w">Bikaner</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cochin" id="w">Cochin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gwalior" id="w">Gwalior</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jaipur" id="w">Jaipur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jodhpur" id="w">Jodhpur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Patiala" id="w">Patiala</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rewa" id="w">Rewa</a> took their seats in the Assembly.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Many princes were also pressured by popular sentiment favouring integration with India, which meant their plans for independence had little support from their subjects.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup>  The king of Travancore, for example, definitively abandoned his plans for independence after the attempted assassination of his dewan, Sir <a href="/wiki/C.P._Ramaswamy_Aiyar" id="w">C.P. Ramaswamy Aiyar</a>.<sup id="_ref-Cop97258_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97258" title="">[36]</a></sup> In a few states, the chief ministers or <a href="/wiki/Dewan" id="w">dewans</a> played a significant role in convincing the princes to accede to India.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup>  The key factors that led the states to accept integration into India were, however, the efforts of Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of British India, and <a href="/wiki/Vallabhbhai_Patel" id="w">Vallabhbhai Patel</a> and <a href="/wiki/V.P._Menon" id="w">V.P.

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption"><a href="/wiki/Lord_Louis_Mountbatten" id="w">Lord Louis Mountbatten</a> played an important role in convincing reluctant monarchs to accede to the Indian Union.</div>
Mountbatten believed that securing the states&#39; accession to India was crucial to reaching a negotiated settlement with the Congress for the transfer of power.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup>  As a relative of the British Emperor, he was trusted by most of the princes and was a personal friend of many, especially the Nawab of Bhopal, <a href="/wiki/Hamidullah_Khan" id="w">Hamidullah Khan</a>. The princes also believed that he would be in a position to ensure the independent India adhered to any terms that might be agreed upon, because <a href="/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru" id="w">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> and Patel had asked him to become the first <a href="/wiki/Governor_General" id="w">Governor General</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Dominion_of_India" id="w">Dominion of India</a>.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Mountbatten used his influence with the princes to push them towards accession.  He declared that the British Government would not grant dominion status to any of the princely states, nor would it accept them into the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">British Commonwealth</a>, which meant that the states would sever all connections with the British crown unless they joined either India or Pakistan.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup>  He pointed out that the <a href="/wiki/Indian_subcontinent" id="w">Indian subcontinent</a> was one economic entity, and that the states would suffer most if the link were broken.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup>  He also pointed to the difficulties that princes would face maintaining order in the face of threats such as the rise of <a href="/wiki/Communalism_(South_Asia)" id="w">communal violence</a> and <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">communist movements</a>.<sup id="_ref-Cop97258_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97258" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mountbatten stressed that he would act as the trustee of the princes&#39; commitment, as he would be serving as India&#39;s head of state well into 1948. He engaged in a personal dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of Bhopal, who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making Bhopal part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked up in his safe. It would be handed to the <a href="/wiki/States_Department" id="w">States Department</a> on <a href="/wiki/15_August" id="w">15 August</a> only if the Nawab did not change his mind before then, which he was free to do. The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the time, several princes complained that they were being betrayed by Britain, who they regarded as an ally,<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> and Sir <a href="/wiki/Conrad_Corfield" id="w">Conrad Corfield</a> resigned his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten&#39;s policies.<sup id="_ref-Cop97258_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97258" title="">[36]</a></sup> Mountbatten&#39;s policies were also criticised by the opposition <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)" id="w">Conservative Party</a>.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup>  <a href="/wiki/Winston_Churchill" id="w">Winston Churchill</a> compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" id="w">Adolf Hitler</a> before the <a href="/wiki/Anschluss" id="w">invasion of Austria</a>.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup>  Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten played a crucial role in ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Vallabhbhai Patel as Minister for Home and States Affairs had the responsibility of welding the British Indian provinces and the princely states into a united India</div>
By far the most significant factor that led to the princes&#39; decision to accede to India was the policy of the Congress and, in particular, of the two key figures in the States Department, <a href="/wiki/Sardar_Vallabhbhai_Patel" id="w">Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</a> and <a href="/wiki/V.P._Menon" id="w">V.P. Menon</a>.  The Congress&#39; stated position was that the princely states were not sovereign entities, and as such could not opt to be independent notwithstanding the end of paramountcy.  The princely states, it declared, must therefore accede to either India or Pakistan.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup>  In July 1946, Nehru pointedly observed that no princely state could prevail militarily against the army of independent India.<sup id="_ref-Cop97258_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97258" title="">[36]</a></sup>  In January 1947, he said that independent India would not accept the <a href="/wiki/Divine_Right_of_Kings" id="w">Divine Right of Kings</a>,<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> and in May 1947, he declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state.<sup id="_ref-Cop97258_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97258" title="">[36]</a></sup>  Other Congress leaders, such as <a href="/wiki/C._Rajagopalachari" id="w">C. Rajagopalachari</a>, argued that as paramountcy &#34;came into being as a fact and not by agreement&#34;, it would necessarily pass to the government of independent India, as the successors of the British.<sup id="_ref-LumbyMult_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LumbyMult" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>Patel and Menon, who were charged with the actual job of negotiating with the princes, took a more conciliatory approach than Nehru.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup>  The official policy statement of the Government of India made by Patel on <a href="/wiki/5_July" id="w">5 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a> made no threats.  Instead, it emphasised the unity of India and the common interests of the princes and independent India, reassured them about the Congress&#39; intentions, and invited them to join independent India &#34;to make laws sitting together as friends than to make treaties as aliens.&#34;<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup>  He reiterated that the States Department would not attempt to establish a relationship of domination over the princely states.  Unlike the Political Department of the British Government, it would not be an instrument of paramountcy, but a medium whereby business could be conducted between the states and India as equals.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Instruments_of_Accession" name="Instruments_of_Accession"></a><h3> Instruments of Accession </h3>

<p>Patel and Menon backed up their diplomatic efforts by producing treaties that were designed to be attractive to rulers of princely states.  Two key documents were produced.  The first was the Standstill Agreement, which confirmed that the agreements and administrative practices that existed as between the princely state in question and the British would be continued by India.  The second was the <a href="/wiki/Instrument_of_Accession" id="w">Instrument of Accession</a>, by which the ruler of the princely state in question agreed to the accession of his kingdom to independent India, and to granting India control over specified subject matters.<sup id="_ref-Ramu273_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ramu273" title="">[25]</a></sup>  The nature of the subject matters varied depending on the acceding state.  The states which had internal autonomy under the British signed an Instrument of Accession which only ceded three subjects to the government of India &#8212; defence, <a href="/wiki/External_affairs" id="w">external affairs</a>, and communications, each defined in accordance with List 1 to Schedule VII of the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_India_Act%2C_1935" id="w">Government of India Act, 1935</a>.  Rulers of states which were in effect estates or <a href="/wiki/Taluk" id="w">talukas</a>, where substantial administrative powers were exercised by the Crown, signed a different Instrument of Accession, which vested all <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_legislative_powers_in_India" id="w">residuary powers</a> and jurisdiction in the government of India.  Rulers of states which had an intermediate status signed a third type of Instrument, which preserved the degree of power they had under the British.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Instruments of Accession implemented a number of other safeguards.  Clause 7 provided that the princes would not be bound to the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_India" id="w">Indian constitution</a> as and when it was drafted.  Clause 8 guaranteed their autonomy in all areas in which authority was not expressly ceded to the Government of India.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup>  This was supplemented by a number of promises.  Rulers who agreed to accede would receive guarantees that their <a href="/wiki/Extra-territorial" id="w">extra-territorial</a> rights, such as <a href="/wiki/Immunity_from_prosecution" id="w">immunity from prosecution</a> in Indian courts and exemption from <a href="/wiki/Customs_duty" id="w">customs duty</a>, would be protected, that they would be allowed to democratise slowly, that none of the eighteen major states would be forced to merge, and that they would remain eligible for <a href="/wiki/British_honours" id="w">British honours and decorations</a>.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> In discussions, Lord Mountbatten reinforced the statements of Patel and Menon by emphasising that the documents gave the princes all the &#34;practical independence&#34; they needed.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup>  Mountbatten, Patel and Menon also sought to give princes the impression that if they did not accept the terms put to them then, they would subsequently have to accede on substantially less favourable terms.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup>  The Standstill Agreement was also used as a negotiating tool, as the States Department categorically ruled out signing a Standstill Agreement with princely states that did not sign an Instrument of Accession.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_accession_process" name="The_accession_process"></a><h2> The accession process </h2>

<p>The limited scope of the Instruments of Accession and the promise of a wide-ranging autonomy and the other guarantees they offered, gave sufficient comfort to many rulers, who saw this as the best deal they could strike given the lack of support from the British, and popular internal pressures.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup>   Between May 1947 and the transfer of power on <a href="/wiki/15_August" id="w">15 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a>, the vast majority of states signed Instruments of Accession.  A few, however, held out.  Some simply delayed signing the Instrument of Accession.  <a href="/wiki/Piploda" id="w">Piploda</a>, a small state in central India, did not accede until March 1948.<sup id="_ref-Cop97260_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97260" title="">[60]</a></sup>  The biggest problems, however, arose with a few border states, such as <a href="/wiki/Jodhpur" id="w">Jodhpur</a>, which tried to negotiate better deals with Pakistan, with <a href="/wiki/Junagadh" id="w">Junagadh</a>, which actually did accede to Pakistan, and with <a href="/wiki/Hyderabad_state" id="w">Hyderabad</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kashmir" id="w">Kashmir</a>, which declared that they intended to remain independent.  </p>
<a id="Border_states" name="Border_states"></a><h3> Border states </h3>

<p>The ruler of <a href="/wiki/Jodhpur" id="w">Jodhpur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hanwant_Singh" id="w">Hanwant Singh</a>, was antipathetic to the Congress, and did not see much future in India for him or the lifestyle he wished to lead, and entered into negotiations with <a href="/wiki/Jinnah" id="w">Jinnah</a>, who was the designated head of state for <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a>, along with the ruler of <a href="/wiki/Jaisalmer" id="w">Jaisalmer</a>.  Jinnah was keen to attract some of the larger border states, hoping thereby to attract other <a href="/wiki/Rajput" id="w">Rajput</a> states to Pakistan and compensate for the loss of half of <a href="/wiki/Bengal" id="w">Bengal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Punjab" id="w">Punjab</a>.  He offered to permit Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to accede to Pakistan on any terms they chose, giving their rulers blank sheets of paper and asking them to write down their terms, which he would sign.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup>  Jaisalmer refused, arguing that it would be difficult for him to side with <a href="/wiki/Muslims" id="w">Muslims</a> against <a href="/wiki/Hindus" id="w">Hindus</a> in the event of communal problems.  Hanwant Singh came close to signing.  However, the atmosphere in Jodhpur was in general hostile to accession to Pakistan.  Mountbatten also pointed out that the accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan would violate the principle of the <a href="/wiki/Two-nation_theory" id="w">two-nation theory</a> on which <a href="/wiki/Partition_of_India" id="w">Partition</a> was based, and was likely to cause communal violence in the State.  Hanwant Singh was persuaded by these arguments, and somewhat reluctantly agreed to accede to India.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Junagadh" name="Junagadh"></a><h3> Junagadh </h3>

<p>{{Main}}
Although the states were in theory free to choose whether they wished to accede to India or Pakistan, Mountbatten had pointed out that &#34;geographic compulsions&#34; meant that most of them must choose India.  In effect, he took the position that only the states that shared a border with Pakistan could choose to accede to it.<sup id="_ref-Cop97260_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97260" title="">[60]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The nawab of <a href="/wiki/Junagadh" id="w">Junagadh</a>, a princely state located on the south-western end of <a href="/wiki/Gujarat" id="w">Gujarat</a> and having no common border with Pakistan, chose to accede to Pakistan ignoring Mountbatten&#39;s views, arguing that it could be reached from Pakistan by sea. The rulers of two states that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh &#8212; <a href="/wiki/Mangrol" id="w">Mangrol</a> and <a href="/wiki/Babariawad" id="w">Babariawad</a> &#8212; reacted to this by declaring their independence from Junagadh and acceding to India.  In response, the nawab of Junagadh militarily occupied the states. The rulers of neighbouring states reacted angrily, sending their troops to the Junagadh frontier and appealed to the Government of India for assistance. A group of Junagadhi people, led by <a href="/wiki/Samaldas_Gandhi" id="w">Samaldas Gandhi</a>, formed a government-in-exile, the <i>Aarzi Hukumat</i> (&#34;temporary government&#34;).<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>India believed that if Junagadh was permitted to go to Pakistan, the communal tension already simmering in Gujarat would worsen, and refused to accept the accession.  The government pointed out that the state was 80% Hindu, and called for a plebiscite to decide the question of accession.  Simultaneously, they <a href="/wiki/Blockade" id="w">cut off</a> supplies of fuel and coal to Junagadh, severed air and postal links, sent troops to the frontier, and reoccupied the <a href="/wiki/Principality" id="w">principaliites</a> of Mangrol and Babariawad that had acceded to India.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup>  Pakistan agreed to discuss a plebiscite, subject to the withdrawal of Indian troops, a condition India rejected.  On <a href="/wiki/26_October" id="w">26 October</a>, the Nawab and his family fled to Pakistan following clashes with Indian troops.  On <a href="/wiki/7_November" id="w">7 November</a>, Junagadh&#39;s court, facing collapse, invited the Government of India to take over the State&#39;s administration. The Government of India agreed.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup>  A <a href="/wiki/Plebiscite" id="w">plebiscite</a> was conducted in February 1948, which went almost unanimously in favour of accession to India.<sup id="_ref-Furb359_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Furb359" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>

<p>Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir&#39;s accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir&#39;s only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of <a href="/wiki/Poonch" id="w">Poonch</a> by the Maharajah&#39;s forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest.

<a href="/wiki/Hyderabad_state" id="w">Hyderabad</a> was a landlocked state that stretched over 82,000 <a href="/wiki/Square_miles" id="w">square miles</a> (over 212,000 <a href="/wiki/Square_kilometres" id="w">square kilometres</a>) in south-eastern India.  Whilst 87% of its 17 million people were Hindus, its ruler <a href="/wiki/Nizam" id="w">Nizam</a> <a href="/wiki/Osman_Ali_Khan" id="w">Osman Ali Khan</a> was a Muslim, and its politics were dominated by a Muslim elite.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup>  The Muslim nobility and the <a href="/wiki/Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen" id="w">Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen</a>, a powerful pro-Nizam Muslim party, insisted that Hyderabad must remain an independent state and stand on an equal footing to India and Pakistan.  Accordingly, the Nizam in June 1947 issued a <i><a href="/wiki/Firman" id="w">firman</a></i> announcing that on the transfer of power, his state would be resuming independence.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup>  The Government of India rejected the firman, terming it a &#34;<a href="/wiki/Legalism_(Western_philosophy)" id="w">legalistic claim</a> of doubtful validity.&#34;  It argued that the strategic location of Hyderabad, which lay astride the main lines of <a href="/wiki/Communication" id="w">communication</a> between northern and southern India, meant it could easily be used by &#34;foreign interests&#34; to threaten India, and that in consequence, the issue involved India&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Peace" id="w">peace</a> and <a href="/wiki/Security" id="w">security</a>.  It also pointed out that the state&#39;s people, history and location made it unquestionably Indian, and that its own &#34;common interests&#34; therefore mandated its integration into India.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The Nizam was prepared to enter into a limited <a href="/wiki/Treaty" id="w">treaty</a> with India, which gave Hyderabad safeguards not provided for in the standard Instrument of Accession, such as a provision guaranteeing Hyderabad&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Neutrality" id="w">neutrality</a> in the event of a conflict between India and Pakistan.  India rejected this proposal, arguing that other states would demand similar <a href="/wiki/Concession" id="w">concessions</a>.  A temporary Standstill Agreement was signed as a stopgap measure, even though Hyderabad had not yet agreed to accede to India.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> By December 1947, however, India was accusing Hyderabad of repeatedly violating the Agreement, while the Nizam alleged that India was <a href="/wiki/Blockade" id="w">blockading</a> his state, a charge India denied.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>
<p>The situation deteriorated further in 1948.  The <a href="/wiki/Razakars_(Hyderabad)" id="w">Razakars</a> (&#34;volunteers&#34;), a militia affiliated to the Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen and set up under the influence of Muslim radical <a href="/wiki/Qasim_Razvi" id="w">Qasim Razvi</a>, assumed the role of supporting the Muslim ruling class against upsurges by the Hindu populace, and began intensifying its activities and was accused of attempting to intimidate <a href="/wiki/Village" id="w">villages</a>.  The Hyderabad State Congress Party, affiliated to the <a href="/wiki/Indian_National_Congress" id="w">Indian National Congress</a>, launched a political agitation.<sup id="_ref-Talbot325_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Talbot325" title="">[79]</a></sup>  Matters were made worse by <a href="/wiki/Communism" id="w">Communist</a> groups, which had originally supported the Congress but now switched sides and began attacking Congress groups.<sup id="_ref-Talbot325_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Talbot325" title="">[79]</a></sup>  Attempts by Mountbatten to find a negotiated solution failed and, in August, the Nizam, claiming that he feared an imminent invasion, attempted to approach the <a href="/wiki/UN_Security_Council" id="w">UN Security Council</a> and the <a href="/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice" id="w">International Court of Justice</a>.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup>  Patel now insisted that if Hyderabad was allowed to continue its independence, the prestige of the Government would be tarnished and then neither Hindus nor Muslims would feel secure in its realm.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup>  On <a href="/wiki/13_September" id="w">13 September</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Army" id="w">Indian Army</a> was sent into Hyderabad in <a href="/wiki/Operation_Polo" id="w">Operation Polo</a> on the ground that the law and order situation there threatened the peace of <a href="/wiki/South_India" id="w">South India</a>.

<p>The Instruments of Accession were limited, transferring control of only three matters to India, and would by themselves have produced a rather loose <a href="/wiki/Federation" id="w">federation</a>, with significant differences in administration and <a href="/wiki/Governance" id="w">governance</a> across the various states.

<a id="Fast-track_integration" name="Fast-track_integration"></a><h3> Fast-track integration </h3>

<p>The first step in this process, carried out between 1947 and 1949, was to merge the smaller states that were not seen by the Government of India to be viable  administrative units either into neighbouring provinces, or with other princely states to create a &#34;princely union.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Cop97262_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97262" title="">[88]</a></sup>  This policy was contentious, since it involved the dissolution of the very states whose existence India had only recently guaranteed in the Instruments of Accession.  Patel and Menon emphasised that without integration, the economies of states would collapse, and anarchy would arise if the princes were unable to provide democracy and govern properly.  They pointed out that many of the smaller states were very small and lacked resources to sustain their economies and support their growing populations. Many also imposed tax rules and other restrictions that impeded free trade, and which had to be dismantled in a united India.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup>  Given that merger involved the breach of guarantees personally given by Mountbatten, Patel and Nehru initially intended to wait until after his term as <a href="/wiki/Governor-General_of_India" id="w">Governor-General</a>.  An <a href="/wiki/Adivasi" id="w">adivasi</a> uprising in <a href="/wiki/Orissa" id="w">Orissa</a> in late 1947, however, forced their hand.<sup id="_ref-Cop97262_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97262" title="">[88]</a></sup>  In December 1947, princes from the Eastern and Chhatisgarh Agencies were summoned to an all-night meeting with Menon, in the course of which they were persuaded to sign Merger Agreements integrating their states into <a href="/wiki/Orissa" id="w">Orissa</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Central_Provinces" id="w">Central Provinces</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bihar" id="w">Bihar</a> with effect from <a href="/wiki/1_January" id="w">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1948" id="w">1948</a>.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup>  Later that year, sixty-six states in <a href="/wiki/Gujarat" id="w">Gujarat</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Deccan" id="w">Deccan</a> were merged into <a href="/wiki/Bombay_Presidency" id="w">Bombay</a>, including the large states of <a href="/wiki/Kolhapur" id="w">Kolhapur</a> and <a href="/wiki/Baroda" id="w">Baroda</a>.

Thirty states of the former <a href="/wiki/Punjab_Hill_States_Agency" id="w">Punjab Hill States Agency</a> which lay near the international border and had signed Merger Agreements were integrated into <a href="/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh" id="w">Himachal Pradesh</a>, a distinct entity which was administered directly by the centre as a <a href="/wiki/Chief_Commissioner%26%2339%3Bs_Province" id="w">Chief Commissioner&#39;s Province</a>, for reasons of security.<sup id="_ref-Furber366_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Furber366" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Merger Agreements required rulers to cede &#34;full and exclusive jurisdiction and powers for and in relation to governance&#34; of their state to the <a href="/wiki/Dominion_of_India" id="w">Dominion of India</a>. In return for their agreement to entirely cede their states, it gave princes a large number of guarantees. Princes would receive an annual payment from the Indian government in the form of a <a href="/wiki/Privy_purse" id="w">privy purse</a> as compensation for the surrender of their powers and the dissolution of their states.

<a id="Merger" name="Merger"></a><h4> Merger </h4>

<p>The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step, process.  The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a &#34;princely union&#34; through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger.  Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the <a href="/wiki/Rajpramukh" id="w">Rajpramukh</a> of the new union.  The other rulers were associated with two bodies, the <a href="/wiki/Council" id="w">council</a> of rulers whose members were the rulers of <a href="/wiki/Salute_state" id="w">salute states</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Presidium" id="w">presidium</a>, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and a deputy Rajpramukh, or <i>Uprajpramukh</i>, were chosen by the council from amongst the members of the presidium.  The Covenants made provision for the creation of a <a href="/wiki/Constituent_assembly" id="w">constituent assembly</a> for the new union which would be charged with framing its <a href="/wiki/Constitution" id="w">constitution</a>.  In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a <a href="/wiki/Privy_purse" id="w">privy purse</a> and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.<sup id="_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#_note-94" title="">[94]</a></sup></p>

<p>Merging the administrative machineries of each state and integrating them into one political and administrative entity was not easy, particularly as many of the merged states had a history of <a href="/wiki/Rivalry" id="w">rivalry</a>.  In the former <a href="/wiki/Central_India_Agency" id="w">Central India Agency</a>, whose princely states had initially been merged into a princely union called <a href="/wiki/Vindhya_Pradesh" id="w">Vindhya Pradesh</a>, the rivalry between two groups of states became so bad that the Government of India persuaded the rulers to sign a Merger Agreement abrogating the old Covenants of Merger, and took direct control of the state as a Chief Commissioner&#39;s State.<sup id="_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#_note-100" title="">[100]</a></sup>  As such, the mergers did not meet the expectations of the Government of India or the States Department.  In December 1947, Menon suggested requiring the rulers of states to take &#34;practical steps towards the establishment of popular government.&#34;  The States Department accepted his suggestion, and implemented it through a special covenant signed by the rajpramukhs of the merged princely unions, binding them to act as constitutional monarchs.<sup id="_ref-Cop97264_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97264" title="">[101]</a></sup>  This meant that their powers were de facto no different from those of the <a href="/wiki/Governors_of_India" id="w">Governors</a> of the former British provinces,<sup id="_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#_note-102" title="">[102]</a></sup> thus giving the people of their territories the same measure of responsible government as the people of the rest of India.<sup id="_ref-Cop97264_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97264" title="">[101]</a></sup></p>
<p>The result of this process has been described as being, in effect, an assertion of paramountcy by the Government of India over the states in a more pervasive form.<sup id="_ref-Furb36970_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Furb36970" title="">[103]</a></sup>  Whilst this contradicted the British statement that paramountcy would lapse on the transfer of power, the Congress position had always been that independent India would inherit the position of being the paramount power.<sup id="_ref-LumbyMult_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LumbyMult" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Centralisation_and_constitutionalisation" name="Centralisation_and_constitutionalisation"></a><h4> Centralisation and constitutionalisation </h4>

<p><a href="/wiki/Democracy" id="w">Democratisation</a> still left open one important distinction between the former princely states and the former British provinces, namely, that since the princely states had signed limited Instruments of Accession covering only three subjects, they were insulated from government policies in other areas.  The Congress viewed this as hampering its ability to frame policies that brought about <a href="/wiki/Social_justice" id="w">social justice</a> and national <a href="/wiki/Development" id="w">development</a>.<sup id="_ref-Cop97264_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97264" title="">[101]</a></sup> Consequently, they sought to secure to the central government the same degree of <a href="/wiki/Power" id="w">powers</a> over the former princely states as it had over the former British provinces.  In May 1948, at the initiative of V.P. Menon, a meeting was held in Delhi between the Rajpramukhs of the princely unions and the States Department, at the end of which the Rajpramukhs signed new Instruments of Accession which gave the Government of India the power to pass laws in respect of all matters that fell within the seventh schedule of the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_India_Act%2C_1935" id="w">Government of India Act, 1935</a>.<sup id="_ref-Cop97264_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97264" title="">[101]</a></sup> Subsequently, each of the princely unions, as well as Mysore and Hyderabad, agreed to adopt the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_India" id="w">Constitution of India</a> drafted by the <a href="/wiki/Constituent_Assembly_of_India" id="w">constituent assembly</a> as the constitution of that state, thus ensuring that they were placed in exactly the same legal position vis-à-vis the central government as the former British provinces.<sup id="_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#_note-104" title="">[104]</a></sup>  The only exception was Kashmir, whose relationship with India continued to be governed by the original Instrument of Accession, and the constitution produced by the state&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Constituent_Assembly_of_Jammu_and_Kashmir" id="w">Constituent Assembly</a>.</p>
<p>The Constitution of India classified the constituent units of India into three classes, which it termed Part A, B, and C states.  The former British provinces, together with the princely states that had been merged into them, were the Part A states.  The princely unions, plus Mysore and Hyderabad, were the Part B states.  The former Chief Commissioners&#39; Provinces and other centrally administered areas, except the <a href="/wiki/Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands" id="w">Andaman and Nicobar Islands</a>, were the Part C states.<sup id="_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#_note-105" title="">[105]</a></sup>  The only practical difference between the Part A states and the Part B states was that the constitutional heads of the Part B states were the Rajpramukhs appointed under the terms of the Covenants of Merger, rather than Governors appointed by the central government.  In addition, Constitution gave the central government a significant range of powers over the former princely states, providing amongst other things that their governance shall be under the general control of, and comply with such particular directions, if any, as may from time to time be given by, the President.&#34;  Apart from that, the form of government in both was identical.<sup id="_ref-Furb36970_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Furb36970" title="">[103]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reorganisation" name="Reorganisation"></a><h4> Reorganisation </h4>

<p>The distinction between Part A and Part B states was only intended to last for a brief, transitional period.  In 1956, the <a href="/wiki/States_Reorganization_Act" id="w">States Reorganization Act</a> reorganised the former British provinces and princely states on the basis of <a href="/wiki/Language" id="w">language</a>.  Simultaneously, the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution removed the distinction between Part A and Part B states, both of which were now treated only as &#34;states&#34;, with Part C states being renamed &#34;<a href="/wiki/Union_territories" id="w">union territories</a>.&#34;  The Rajpramukhs lost their authority, and were replaced as the constitutional heads of state by Governors, who were appointed by the central government.  These changes finally ended the princely order to an end.<sup id="_ref-Cop97266_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97266" title="">[106]</a></sup>  In both legal and practical terms, the territories that formerly were part of the princely states were now fully integrated into India and did not differ in any way from those that were formerly part of British India.<sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[107]</a></sup> The personal privileges of the princes - the privy purse, the exemption from customs duty, and customary dignities - survived slightly longer, but were abolished in 1971.<sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[108]</a></sup></p>

<p>Whilst the progressive integration of the princely states into India was largely peaceful, not all princes were happy with the outcome.

A plebiscite held in Chandernagore on <a href="/wiki/19_June" id="w">19 June</a> <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a> resulted in a vote of 7,463 to 114 in favour of being integrated with India.

<a id="Secessionism_and_sub-nationalism" name="Secessionism_and_sub-nationalism"></a><h3> Secessionism and sub-nationalism </h3>

<p>Whilst the majority of princely states absorbed into India have been fully integrated, a few outstanding issues remain.  The most prominent of these is in relation to Kashmir, where a <a href="/wiki/Kashmir_conflict" id="w">violent secessionist insurgency</a> has been raging since the late 1980s.  </p>
<p>Some academics suggest that the insurgency in Kashmir is at least partly a result of the manner in which it was integrated into India.  Kashmir, uniquely amongst princely states, was not required to sign either a Merger Agreement or a revised Instrument of Accession giving India control over a larger number of issues than the three originally provided for.  Instead, the power to make laws relating to Kashmir was granted to the Government of India by Article 5 of the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Jammu_and_Kashmir" id="w">Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir</a> and was, under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, somewhat more restricted than in relation to other states.  Widmalm argues that during the 1980s, a number of Kashmiri youth began to feel that the Indian government was increasingly interfering in the <a href="/wiki/Politics_of_Jammu_and_Kashmir" id="w">politics of Jammu and Kashmir</a>.<sup id="_ref-Widmalm1923_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Widmalm1923" title="">[128]</a></sup> The elections of 1987 caused them to lose faith in the political process and begin the violent insurgency which is still ongoing.<sup id="_ref-Widmalm1923_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Widmalm1923" title="">[128]</a></sup> Similarly, Sumit suggests that the policies of the Indian government towards Kashmir meant that the state, unlike other parts of India, never developed the solid political institutions associated with a modern <a href="/wiki/Multi-ethnic" id="w">multi-ethnic</a> <a href="/wiki/Democracy" id="w">democracy</a>.<sup id="_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#_note-129" title="">[129]</a></sup>  As a result, the growing dissatisfaction with the status quo felt by an increasingly politically aware youth was expressed through non-political channels<sup id="_ref-130" class="reference"><a href="#_note-130" title="">[130]</a></sup> which Pakistan, seeking to weaken India&#39;s hold over Kashmir, transformed into an active insurgency.<sup id="_ref-131" class="reference"><a href="#_note-131" title="">[131]</a></sup></p>
<p>Separatist movements also exist in two other former princely states located in <a href="/wiki/North-East_India" id="w">North-East India</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tripura" id="w">Tripura</a> and <a href="/wiki/Manipur" id="w">Manipur</a>.  These separatist movements are generally treated by scholars as being part of the broader problem of <a href="/wiki/Insurgent_groups_in_Northeast_India" id="w">insurgencies in North-east India</a>, rather being a result of specific problems in integrating the princely states into India, as the Kashmir problem is and, in particular, to reflect the failure of the Government of India to adequately address the aspirations of tribal groups in the Northeast, or to tackle the tensions arising from the immigration of people from other parts of India to the north-eastern areas.<sup id="_ref-132" class="reference"><a href="#_note-132" title="">[132]</a></sup></p>
<p>The integration of former princely states with other provinces to form new states has also given rise to some issues.  The <a href="/wiki/Telengana" id="w">Telengana</a> region, comprising the <a href="/wiki/Telugu_language" id="w">Telugu</a>-speaking districts of the former <a href="/wiki/Hyderabad_State" id="w">Hyderabad State</a>, were in many ways different from the Telugu-speaking areas of British India with which they were merged.  In recognition of these differences, the <a href="/wiki/States_Reorganisation_Commission" id="w">States Reorganisation Commission</a> originally recommended that Telengana be created as a separate state, rather than as part of a broader Telugu-speaking entity.  This recommendation was rejected by the Government of India, and Telengana was merged into <a href="/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh" id="w">Andhra Pradesh</a>.  The result was the emergence in the 1960s of a movement demanding a separate Telengana state, which continues to be strong in the region.<sup id="_ref-133" class="reference"><a href="#_note-133" title="">[133]</a></sup>  A similar movement, although less strong, exists in the <a href="/wiki/Vidarbha" id="w">Vidarbha</a> region of <a href="/wiki/Maharashtra" id="w">Maharashtra</a>, which consists of the former <a href="/wiki/Nagpur" id="w">Nagpur</a> state and the <a href="/wiki/Berar" id="w">Berar</a> region of the former Hyderabad state.<sup id="_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#_note-134" title="">[134]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Jinnah supported the right of princely states to remain independent, a position rejected by Nehru and the Congress</div>
As this article has discussed, the integration process repeatedly brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict.  During negotiations, <a href="/wiki/Jinnah" id="w">Jinnah</a>, representing the <a href="/wiki/Muslim_League" id="w">Muslim League</a>, strongly supported the right of the princely states to remain independent, joining neither India nor Pakistan, an attitude which was diametrically opposed to the stance taken by Nehru and the Congress<sup id="_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="#_note-135" title="">[135]</a></sup> and which was reflected in Pakistan&#39;s support of Hyderabad&#39;s bit to stay independent.  Post-partition, the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan" id="w">Government of Pakistan</a> accused India of hypocrisy on the ground that there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan &#8212; which India refused to recognise &#8212; and the accession of the Maharajah of Kashmir to India, and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India&#39;s incorporation of Junagadh, treating it as de jure Pakistani territory.<sup id="_ref-Furb359_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Furb359" title="">[66]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Different theories have been proposed to explain the designs of Indian and Pakistani leaders in this period. <a href="/wiki/Rajmohan_Gandhi" id="w">Rajmohan Gandhi</a> postulates that an ideal deal working in the mind of Patel was that if Muhammad Ali Jinnah let India have Junagadh and Hyderabad, Patel would not object to Kashmir acceding to Pakistan.<sup id="_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#_note-136" title="">[136]</a></sup>  In his book <i>Patel: A Life</i>, Gandhi asserts that Jinnah sought to engage the questions of Junagadh and Hyderabad in the same battle. It is suggested that he wanted India to ask for a <a href="/wiki/Plebiscite" id="w">plebiscite</a> in Junagadh and Hyderabad, knowing thus that the principle then would have to be applied to Kashmir, where the Muslim-majority would, he believed, vote for Pakistan. A speech by Patel at the Bahauddin College in <a href="/wiki/Junagadh" id="w">Junagadh</a> following the latter&#39;s take-over, where he said that &#34;we would agree to Kashmir if they agreed to Hyderabad&#34; suggests that he may have been amenable to this idea.<sup id="_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="#_note-137" title="">[137]</a></sup> Whilst Patel&#39;s opinions were not India&#39;s policy, nor were they shared by Nehru, both leaders were angered at Jinnah&#39;s courting the princes of <a href="/wiki/Jodhpur" id="w">Jodhpur</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bhopal" id="w">Bhopal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Indore" id="w">Indore</a>, leading them to take a harder stance on a possible deal with Pakistan.<sup id="_ref-138" class="reference"><a href="#_note-138" title="">[138]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Modern historians have also re-examined the role of the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the accession process.  Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed, and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950.<sup id="_ref-Cop97264_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cop97264" title="">[101]</a></sup> He points out that the mergers and <a href="/wiki/Cession" id="w">cession</a> of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the instruments of accession, and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes.<sup id="_ref-139" class="reference"><a href="#_note-139" title="">[139]</a></sup>  Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element of coercion.  Copland disagrees, on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign, and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements.<sup id="_ref-140" class="reference"><a href="#_note-140" title="">[140]</a></sup>  He also criticises Mountbatten&#39;s role, saying that whilst he stayed within the letter of the law, he was at least under a moral obligation to do something for the princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place, and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence.<sup id="_ref-141" class="reference"><a href="#_note-141" title="">[141]</a></sup> Both Copland and Ramusack argue that, in the ultimate analysis, one of the reasons why the princes consented to the demise of their states was that they felt abandoned by the British, and saw themselves as having little other option.<sup id="_ref-142" class="reference"><a href="#_note-142" title="">[142]</a></sup>  Older historians such as Lumby, in contrast, take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power, and that their demise was inevitable.  They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India was a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten, and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes, who jointly achieved in a few months what the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">Empire</a> had attempted, unsuccessfully, to do for over a century &#8212; unite all of India under one rule.<sup id="_ref-143" class="reference"><a href="#_note-143" title="">[143]</a></sup></p>
