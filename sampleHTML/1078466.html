<p><b>George Robert Gleig</b> (<a href="/wiki/20_April" id="w">20 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1796" id="w">1796</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/9_July" id="w">9 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1888" id="w">1888</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scottish</a> soldier and military writer.</p>
<p>Gleig was born in <a href="/wiki/Stirling" id="w">Stirling</a>. His parents were <a href="/wiki/George_Gleig" id="w">George Gleig</a> (<a href="/wiki/1753" id="w">1753</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/1840" id="w">1840</a>), Bishop of <a href="/wiki/Brechin" id="w">Brechin</a> from October <a href="/wiki/1808" id="w">1808</a>) and Janet, nee Hamilton.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/1813-06-21" id="w">1813-06-21</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington" id="w">Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington</a> had his first victory in <a href="/wiki/Spain" id="w">Spain</a> over the <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a>, at the battle of <a href="/wiki/Vitoria" id="w">Vitoria</a>.  One month later a young student of divinity, George Robert Gleig, gave up a scholarship to <a href="/wiki/Balliol_College%2C_Oxford" id="w">Balliol College</a> to join Wellington’s army as an Ensign in the <a href="/wiki/85th_Foot" id="w">85th Light Infantry</a>.  His father, by then Bishop of Brechin, furnished him with £20, a substantial sum, though he notes that the rate at which he could buy readily exchangeable gold coins was poor — he had to pay 6s for every gold dollar, and £5 for a doubloon.  On 7 October Wellington crossed into France for the first time.</p>
<p>On 6 April 1814, <a href="/wiki/Napol%C3%A9on" id="w">Napoléon</a> abdicated, though Wellington did not find out until the 12th.  By then, on 10 April he had fought and won the decisive battle of the war at <a href="/wiki/Toulouse" id="w">Toulouse</a>.  The young divinity student was then sent to the war against the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, where he fought in five battles (<a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Bladensburg" id="w">Bladensburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Baltimore" id="w">Baltimore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans" id="w">New Orleans</a>, <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C." id="w">Washington</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fort_Bayo" id="w">Fort Bayo</a>) and was three times wounded;  after peace broke out he resumed his scholarship at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" id="w">Oxford</a> in 1816. </p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Baltimore" id="w">Battle of Baltimore</a>, in which Gleig saw action, the British army took prisoners including one <a href="/wiki/Francis_Scott_Key" id="w">Francis Scott Key</a>.  Key witnessed his captors’ bombardment of <a href="/wiki/Fort_McHenry" id="w">Fort McHenry</a>; next morning he found that the Fort’s large flag was still flying.  He was familiar with the old English tune <i><a href="/wiki/To_Anacreon_in_Heaven" id="w">To Anacreon in Heaven</a></i>;  the flying flag inspired him to write a poem, to fit the tune.  His song was immediately popular with Americans, and was adopted by Congress as the national anthem in 1931, as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner" id="w">The Star-Spangled Banner</a></i>.  Napoléon Buonaparte meanwhile was sent to <a href="/wiki/Elba" id="w">Elba</a>.  </p>
<p>Gleig married in 1819, while at Oxford.  Having taken his B.A. and M.A., the young Gleig took holy orders in 1820.  He became curate of <a href="/wiki/Westwell%2C_Kent" id="w">Westwell, Kent</a>, and was later appointed to two additional parishes, as curate of <a href="/wiki/Ash_(near_Sandwich)" id="w">Ash</a> and as Rector of <a href="/wiki/Ivychurch" id="w">Ivychurch</a>.  He wrote a series of articles for <a href="/wiki/Blackwood%E2%80%99s_Magazine" id="w">Blackwood’s Magazine</a> on his <a href="/wiki/Peninsular_War" id="w">Peninsular War</a> experiences;  they were collected into a book, published in 1825:  “The Subaltern”.  In 1827 he published an account of his experiences in the USA as &#34;The Campaigns of the British Army at Washington and New Orleans&#34;. In 1829 he was invited to meet Wellington, and became a regular house-guest of the Duke.</p>
<p>In 1832 George Robert Gleig, by then Chaplain to the <a href="/wiki/Chelsea_Hospital" id="w">Chelsea Hospital</a> — the <a href="/wiki/Chelsea_Pensioners" id="w">Chelsea Pensioners</a> — and a well-known author, mainly on military matters, publicly opposed the <a href="/wiki/Reform_Act_1832" id="w">Reform Bill</a> before Parliament.</p>
<p>Gleig had excellent relations with the Duke of Wellington, but that did not stop the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Duke" id="w">Iron Duke</a> from issuing a public reprimand in 1840 to Gleig for his plan to educate NCOs and private soldiers:
</p><dl><dd><i>By Jove!  If there is a mutiny in the army – and in all probability we shall have one – you’ll see that these new-fangled schoolmasters will be at the bottom of it.</i></dd></dl>
<p>Gleig was appointed Chaplain-General of the Forces in 1844, resigned 1875;  from 1846 to 1857 he was Inspector-General of Military Schools.</p>
<p>Gleig was a frequent contributor to reviews and magazines, especially <i><a href="/wiki/Blackwood%26%2339%3Bs_Magazine" id="w">Blackwood&#39;s Magazine</a></i>, in which his best-known novel, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Subaltern" id="w">The Subaltern</a></i>, appeared in instalments.  He was also the author of Lives of <a href="/wiki/Warren_Hastings" id="w">Warren Hastings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Clive" id="w">Robert Clive</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Wellington" id="w">Wellington</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Military_Commanders" id="w">Military Commanders</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Chelsea_Pensioners" id="w">Chelsea Pensioners</a></i>, and other works.</p>
<p>He died	at <a href="/wiki/Stratfield_Turgis" id="w">Stratfield Turgis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hampshire" id="w">Hampshire</a> in <a href="/wiki/1888" id="w">1888</a>.</p>
