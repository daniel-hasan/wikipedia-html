The <b>SR N Class</b> were <a href="/wiki/2-6-0" id="w">2-6-0</a> (mogul) <a href="/wiki/Steam_locomotives" id="w">steam locomotives</a> designed by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Maunsell" id="w">Richard Maunsell</a> for mixed-traffic duties on initially the <a href="/wiki/South_Eastern_and_Chatham_Railway" id="w">SECR</a> , and latterly the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Railway_(UK)" id="w">Southern Railway</a>.  A highly standardised class of locomotive, the N Class had a long period of conception upon the interruption of the <a href="/wiki/First_World_War" id="w">First World War</a> in 1914, only being introduced in 1917, three years after the original design.</p>
<p>Several members of the class were manfactures as kits of parts at the <a href="/wiki/Woolwich_Arsenal" id="w">Woolwich Arsenal</a>, with these being granted the nickname &#39;Woolworths.&#39;  Able to operate over most of the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Railway_(Great_Britain)" id="w">Southern Railway</a> network after <a href="/wiki/Railways_Act_1921" id="w">grouping in 1923</a>,  the N Class survived until 1966, when all had been withdrawn from service.  Only a single example has been preserved.</p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h1> Background </h1>

<p>The class was a respone to the <a href="/wiki/South_Eastern_and_Chatham_Railway" id="w">South Eastern and Chatham Railway</a>&#39;s requirement for a sturdy mixed-traffic locomotive with high route availability on its network.<sup id="_ref-Middlemass_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middlemass" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The design was to act as a replacement for elderly classes that were still present in this railway&#39;s running fleet, resulting in a requirement for standardization and ease of maintenance.<sup id="_ref-Middlemass_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middlemass" title="">[1]</a></sup>  This had to be married to the ability for the new locomotive to operate over the lightly laid trackwork on the SECR, and as a result, the 2-6-0 wheel arrangement was settled upon.<sup id="_ref-Casserley_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Casserley" title="">[2]</a></sup>  The design was to have mass production in mind, and the result was the two-cylinder N Class.<sup id="_ref-Middlemass_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middlemass" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Construction_history" name="Construction_history"></a><h1> Construction history </h1>

<p>Designed in 1914 by Richard Maunsell as a modern solution to the problems the SECR experienced with ageing and unspectacular mixed traffic designs, the N Class&#39; production was delayed by the outbreak of the <a href="/wiki/First_World_War" id="w">First World War</a>.<sup id="_ref-Haresnape_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haresnape" title="">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Production finally began towards the end of the war with number 810 emerging from <a href="/wiki/Ashford_railway_works" id="w">Ashford works</a> in <a href="/wiki/July" id="w">July</a> <a href="/wiki/1917" id="w">1917</a>.<sup id="_ref-Middlemass_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middlemass" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The new locomotive showed a heavy <a href="/wiki/Swindon" id="w">Swindon</a> influence, as <a href="/wiki/GWR" id="w">GWR</a> engineer <a href="/wiki/Harry_Holcroft" id="w">Harry Holcroft</a> had been recruited by the SECR as Maunsell&#39;s assistant.  The locomotives were <a href="/wiki/Superheated" id="w">superheated</a> and were equipped with Walschaerts valve gear.<sup id="_ref-Haresnape_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haresnape" title="">[3]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Standardization of the SECR&#39;s locomotive fleet was a key consideration due to the various mismatched classes already under that railway&#39;s control providing unnecessary burden on its financial resources.<sup id="_ref-Herring_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Herring" title="">[4]</a></sup>  Effective standardisation of locomotive parts meant that the design was successful when trialled, and the Ministry of Supply ordered several of the class to be constructed at Woolwich Arsenal after the war, earning the locomotive the nickname &#34;Woolworths.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Middlemass_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middlemass" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/British_government" id="w">British government</a>&#39;s interest in the standardisation potential of the N Class stemmed from an early attempt to <a href="/wiki/Nationalise" id="w">nationalise</a> the railways, although this idea was soon abandoned in favour of grouping the railways into the &#34;Big Four&#34; from 1923.<sup id="_ref-Middlemass_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middlemass" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ease of construction through the manufacturing of prefabricated components at <a href="/wiki/Woolwich" id="w">Woolwich</a> meant that many were available for purchase at the time of Grouping, and several were sold to <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Railway" id="w">Metropolitan Railway</a>.<sup id="_ref-Middlemass_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middlemass" title="">[1]</a></sup>  The class was readily adopted by the newly formed <a href="/wiki/Southern_Railway_(Great_Britain)" id="w">Southern Railway</a>, with 50 members being assembled at <a href="/wiki/Ashford" id="w">Ashford</a>.<sup id="_ref-Reynolds_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reynolds" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The first 65 of the class constructed were equipped with the standard right hand drive characteristic of <a href="/wiki/Ashford" id="w">Ashford</a> works.  The success of the design, however, spawned the infamous <a href="/wiki/SECR_K_Class" id="w">SECR K Class</a> 2-6-4Ts which used the front end and boiler of the N design.<sup id="_ref-Middlemass_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middlemass" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_final_batch" name="The_final_batch"></a><h2> The final batch </h2>

<p>The final batch of 15 locomotives were constructed between 1932 and 1934.  These had various detail differences to the &#34;Woolworth&#34; batches, the major alteration being the adaptation of the design to encompass the Southern&#39;s adopted left-hand drive standard.<sup id="_ref-Reynolds_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reynolds" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Further detail differences were the implementation of <a href="/wiki/Southern_Railway_U1_Class" id="w">U1 Class</a> components, such as the dome and chimney, which were of a lower profile than the original N design.<sup id="_ref-Middlemass_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Middlemass" title="">[1]</a></sup>  These locomotives were also equipped with 4,000 gallon tenders, and sported a step on the <a href="/wiki/Footplate" id="w">footplate</a>, the area of the boiler backplate being lower than that of the tender fall-plate.<sup id="_ref-Haresnape_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haresnape" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Further_modifications" name="Further_modifications"></a><h2> Further modifications </h2>

<p>From 1933, the entire class was supplied with smoke deflectors, and although originally equipped with smokebox-mounted snifting valves, these were removed by the end of the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a>.<sup id="_ref-Reynolds_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reynolds" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The batch constructed after 1930 were also equipped with front steps when built, those built prior to these did not encompass this refinement until later on in their careers.<sup id="_ref-Haresnape_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haresnape" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<a id="SECR_and_Southern_Railway" name="SECR_and_Southern_Railway"></a><h2> SECR and Southern Railway</h2>

<p>When grouping occurred in 1923, the liveries sported by the constituent companies were standardised.<sup id="_ref-Reynolds_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reynolds" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The N Class was initially outshopped in Urie LSWR Green, and ran in this guise throughout the 1920s, with yellow numbering and &#39;Southern&#39; on the tender.  From 1931, the class was repainted in Maunsell lined SR Olive Green after 1931, once again with yellow markings.<sup id="_ref-Haresnape_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haresnape" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Upon the outbreak of the Second World War in <a href="/wiki/1939" id="w">1939</a>, locomotive numbers 1413 &#38; 1850 were painted Olive Green with no lining due to the inevitable cutbacks on labour.<sup id="_ref-Reynolds_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reynolds" title="">[5]</a></sup> Others were outshopped in wartime black when their overhauls became due.<sup id="_ref-Haresnape_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haresnape" title="">[3]</a></sup>  However, some of the locomotives (numbers 1821/25/47/78 &#38; 1403) had, by 1941 acquired a new Maunsell Green livery, though received the new <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Bulleid" id="w">Bulleid</a> gilt lettering; these were also unlined due to wartime constraints.<sup id="_ref-Reynolds_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reynolds" title="">[5]</a></sup>  All Ns had been painted black by the end of the war.<sup id="_ref-Haresnape_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haresnape" title="">[3]</a></sup></p> 
<p>Two locomotives, numbers 1817 &#38; 1854, received Bulleid&#39;s Malachite Green livery in 1946 with yellow and black lining and &#34;Sunshine Yellow&#34; lettering replacing the gilt.<sup id="_ref-Haresnape_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haresnape" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Numbering was also a highly complex issue, a reflection of the initial slow pace of production.<sup id="_ref-Reynolds_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reynolds" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Ashford works had constructed a mere 15 locomotives numbered from 810&#8211;824 by December 1923, which were numbered under SECR parlance.<sup id="_ref-Reynolds_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reynolds" title="">[5]</a></sup>  The Woolwich Arsenal batch of 50 locomotives purchased by the newly formed Southern Railway from 1923 were numbered from A825&#8211;A875.<sup id="_ref-Haresnape_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haresnape" title="">[3]</a></sup>   </p>
<p>The letter &#39;A&#39; reflected the post grouping practice of the Southern to denote the engine&#39;s place of origin within the pre-grouping (SECR in this case) number.<sup id="_ref-Reynolds_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reynolds" title="">[5]</a></sup>  This helped to prevent confusion with locomotives of similar numbers also acquired from other pre-grouping railway companies.  The &#39;A&#39; in this case denotes Ashford, where the Woolwich batch was assembled from a series of kits.  Southern numbering policy was eventually rationalised, and from 1928, the locomotives were renumbered 1810 to 1875.<sup id="_ref-Haresnape_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haresnape" title="">[3]</a></sup>  The final batch of 15 locomotives built between 1932 and 1934 were numbered 1400&#8211;1414 without the &#39;A&#39; prefix.</p>
<a id="Post-1948_(nationalisation)" name="Post-1948_(nationalisation)"></a><h2>Post-1948 (nationalisation)</h2>

<p>The class was absorbed by <a href="/wiki/British_Railways" id="w">British Railways</a> in 1948, and were given the BR <a href="/wiki/Power_classification" id="w">Power classification</a> 4P5F.  Livery was initially as Southern Railway, though with &#39;British Railways&#39; on the tender, and an &#39;S&#39; prefix to the Southern number.  This was succeeded by the BR mixed traffic lined black livery with red and white lining, and the BR crest on the tender.<sup id="_ref-Longworth_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Longworth" title="">[6]</a></sup>  Numbering was under the BR standard system, and were allocated the series 31810&#8211;31875 for the earlier locomotives, and 31400&#8211;31414 for the final 15.<sup id="_ref-ABC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ABC" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>Prior to nationalisation, Government-backed locomotive fuelling trials meant that 1831 was converted to oil burning during 1947 and converted back in 1948.<sup id="_ref-Haresnape_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Haresnape" title="">[3]</a></sup>  Their heavy usage began to show, as from 1955 until 1961, 29 of the class had to be re-cylindered due to wear.
