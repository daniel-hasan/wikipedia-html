<p>The feature film <i>Stargate</i>, written by <a href="/wiki/Dean_Devlin" id="w">Dean Devlin</a> and directed by <a href="/wiki/Roland_Emmerich" id="w">Roland Emmerich</a>, was released in <a href="/wiki/1994_in_film" id="w">1994</a>.

<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h2>Plot</h2>
<p>The film&#39;s plot lays the framework of the Stargate mythos. A brilliant <a href="/wiki/Archaeologist" id="w">Archaeologist</a>, <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Jackson" id="w">Dr. Daniel Jackson</a> (<a href="/wiki/James_Spader" id="w">James Spader</a>), is shunned by the academic world due to his far-fetched theories regarding the <a href="/wiki/Great_Pyramids" id="w">Great Pyramids</a>. <a href="/wiki/Catherine_Langford" id="w">Dr. Catherine Langford</a> privately hires him to <a href="/wiki/Decipher" id="w">decipher</a> a set of <a href="/wiki/Symbol" id="w">symbols</a> found on the <a href="/wiki/Cover_stone" id="w">cover stones</a> of an ancient ring-shaped artifact (the <a href="/wiki/Stargate_(device)" id="w">Stargate</a>) that was found at <a href="/wiki/Giza" id="w">Giza</a> in 1928. Jackson determines that the symbols are in fact <a href="/wiki/Constellation" id="w">constellations</a>, and if 6 symbols are identified, a point in space can be extrapolated that corresponds to a &#34;destination&#34;; a seventh symbol defines the <a href="/wiki/Point_of_origin" id="w">point of origin</a>. This discovery unlocks the secret to using the Stargate for interstellar travel.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" id="w">USAF</a> Colonel <a href="/wiki/Jack_O%26%2339%3BNeil_(Stargate)" id="w">Jack O&#39;Neil</a> (<a href="/wiki/Kurt_Russell" id="w">Kurt Russell</a>), with Jackson, leads an expedition through the Stargate to the planet <a href="/wiki/Abydos_(Stargate)" id="w">Abydos</a>. In the film, only two Stargates are known to exist, i.e. the two connecting Abydos and Earth; hence the purpose of the mission is to determine whether Abydos poses a danger to Earth, and, if so, to destroy the gate on Abydos to protect Earth. Expansions of the film, such as <i>SG-1</i>, alter this premise, explaining that an entire network of Stargates exists.</p>
<p>On Abydos, O&#39;Neil&#39;s team comes into conflict with <a href="/wiki/Ra_(Stargate)" id="w">an alien</a> posing as the <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_Mythology" id="w">Egyptian sun god</a> <a href="/wiki/Ra" id="w">Ra</a> (<a href="/wiki/Jaye_Davidson" id="w">Jaye Davidson</a>). Ra controls vast numbers of slaves who labor in his mine, living in fear and ignorance. The slaves are the descendants of humans who were transported to Abydos from Ancient Egypt to mine the mineral needed to sustain Ra&#39;s life. O&#39;Neil&#39;s team befriends the people of Abydos, and Jackson falls in love with and marries a woman named <a href="/wiki/Sha%26%2339%3Buri" id="w">Sha&#39;uri</a> (<a href="/wiki/Mili_Avital" id="w">Mili Avital</a>), who was originally given to him by the people of Abydos as a peace offering. The team reveals Ra&#39;s hoax to the people of Abydos and leads them in revolution against him.</p>
<p>Before O&#39;Neil is able to detonate a nuclear warhead to seal the pathway to Earth, Ra steals the bomb and uses the same mineral comprising the Stargate to increase its destructive power a hundredfold, with the intention of sending the bomb back to Earth through the Stargate. O&#39;Neil is unable to defuse the detonation timer, and alternatively transports the bomb onto Ra&#39;s space-vessel. It detonates, destroying both Ra and his ship.  With Ra&#39;s destruction, the slaves of Abydos are liberated.</p>
<p>O&#39;Neil and the surviving members of his team return to Earth, but Jackson stays behind to live with his wife.<sup id="_ref-primer_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-primer" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Stargate SG-1</i> proved to be very popular.

The show is developed by most of the same people as <i>SG-1</i>, and is produced in the same studios.</p>
<p><i>Atlantis</i> debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel on <a href="/wiki/July_16" id="w">July 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, starring <a href="/wiki/Joe_Flanigan" id="w">Joe Flanigan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Torri_Higginson" id="w">Torri Higginson</a> in the lead roles, with <a href="/wiki/Rainbow_Francks" id="w">Rainbow Sun Francks</a>, <a href="/wiki/David_Hewlett" id="w">David Hewlett</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Luttrell" id="w">Rachel Luttrell</a> alongside.

Even though the series was produced by <a href="/wiki/MGM" id="w">MGM</a> with <a href="/wiki/DiC_Entertainment" id="w">DiC Entertainment</a>, none of the writers and producers of <i>Stargate SG-1</i> were involved with <i>Infinity</i>, and it is not considered official Stargate <a href="/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" id="w">canon</a>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> The show was canceled after 1 season for its poor reception and ratings.</p>
<p>Set 30 to 40 years in the future, <i>Infinity</i> tells the story of a team of young recruits led by a veteran member of <a href="/wiki/Stargate_Command" id="w">Stargate Command</a> that are framed for a crime they did not commit. The team must travel from world to world trying to find a way to clear their name, while protecting a strange alien being discovered in the first episode, which is believed to hold the secret to mysteries surrounding the Stargates and the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_(Stargate)" id="w">Ancient</a> race that built them. Due to its cancellation, none of the major <a href="/wiki/Plot_arc" id="w">plot arcs</a> of the series were concluded.</p>
<p>The series featured a strong <a href="/wiki/Moral" id="w">moral</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edutainment" id="w">educational</a> theme, purposely summarizing each episode with a distinct lesson for its young audience to learn. It focused primarily on the importance of <a href="/wiki/Teamwork" id="w">working together</a> and accepting <a href="/wiki/Xenophobia" id="w">differences</a> in other cultures or people, whether they be aliens or members of one&#39;s own team.

<p>There are three series of novels based on the Stargate franchise, one based on the original <i><a href="/wiki/Stargate_(film)" id="w">Stargate</a></i> film and two based in the <i><a href="/wiki/Stargate_SG-1" id="w">Stargate SG-1</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Stargate_Atlantis" id="w">Stargate Atlantis</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Television_show" id="w">television shows</a>. Short fiction has also been published in the official <i>Stargate Magazine</i>. </p>
<p>A series of books written by <a href="/wiki/Bill_McCay" id="w">Bill McCay</a> were published from <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a> to <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a> that were unofficial sequels to the film. These were produced by consulting the original notes made by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, in an attempt to envision where the film &#34;would have gone&#34;. Neither party has commented on whether McCay&#39;s interpretation was correct. Despite the fact that he attempted to remain close to the original vision, the subsequent television series <i>Stargate SG-1</i> (which began under an entirely independent development) developed the story along different lines, making  no attempt to reconcile the plot lines of the books. This marked the first major branching of the franchise.</p>
<p>Later,  from 1999 to 2001, <a href="/wiki/ROC_(publisher)" id="w">ROC</a> published four novels based in <i>Stargate SG-1</i> written by <a href="/wiki/Ashley_McConnell" id="w">Ashley McConnell</a>. In 2004, <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a>-based <a href="/wiki/Fandemonium" id="w">Fandemonium Press</a> started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on <i>Stargate SG-1</i>. Due to the conflict with ROC&#39;s license, these books were available in  <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a>, <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" id="w">South Africa</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a>, but not in the US. Fandemonium books became available in the US in 2006.</p>
<p>The official <i>Stargate Magazine</i>, produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both <i>SG-1</i> and <i>Atlantis</i>.</p>

<p>Charles Cohen, executive vice president of MGM Television, has voiced plans to develop further Stargate films and produce a third television series to be titled <a href="/wiki/Stargate_Universe" id="w">Stargate Universe</a> (discounting <i>Infinity</i> as a Stargate television series), currently in a pre-production concept phase.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Additionally, <a href="/wiki/Brad_Wright" id="w">Brad Wright</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_C._Cooper" id="w">Robert C.

<p>Plans for producing two sequels of the original film were announced by the original film&#39;s creator <a href="/wiki/Dean_Devlin" id="w">Dean Devlin</a> at the 2006 <a href="/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con" id="w">San Diego Comic-Con</a>.

<p>In the meantime, Lionsgate remains the major rights holder to the original film (any home video or theatrical reissue is now the responsibility of Lionsgate)--this was due to the fact that its predecessor, Live Entertainment, owned home video rights to the <a href="/wiki/Carolco_Pictures" id="w">Carolco Pictures</a> library and had also owned international distribution rights, although Carolco itself was on the brink of bankruptcy when they produced this film.</p>

<p>According to the SF writer <a href="/wiki/Vernor_Vinge" id="w">Vernor Vinge</a>: &#34;It’s a truism that science fiction is always about the present.

<p><i>Gaters</i> (singular <i>Gater</i>) is a term that is used to describe a <a href="/wiki/Fandom" id="w">fan</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Stargate" id="w">Stargate</a> <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a> franchise. The term was first used on the <a href="/wiki/Usenet" id="w">usenet</a> group alt.tv.stargate-sg1, in 1997, in a discussion about what to call Stargate fans and has since been added to the group&#39;s FAQ.  <i>Gaters</i> was popularised when alt.tv.stargate-sg1&#39;s host website (SG-1.net) was shut down when the owner, Sean Fitzgibbons, was offered a brief job with <a href="/wiki/MGM" id="w">MGM</a>. This led to the creation of a replacement forum Gaters.net. The term is officially recognised by the show&#39;s executive producers in DVD commentaries of the tv show. Gaters participate in conventions such as Gatecon.  There are many online fan clubs for the shows and films and for the cast and crew of the tv series. The terms <i>Gatehead</i>, <i>Gaties</i> and <i>Gate Fans</i> are alternatively used by many fans.</p>
