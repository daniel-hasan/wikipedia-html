<b><i>The Simpsons</i></b><b> <i>Treehouse of Horror</i> episodes</b>, also known as <b><i>The Simpsons</i></b><b> Halloween episodes</b>, are a series of episodes in the <a href="/wiki/List_of_animated_television_series" id="w">animated television series</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons" id="w">The Simpsons</a></i>. They are <a href="/wiki/Halloween" id="w">Halloween</a> specials, each consisting of three separate, self-contained segments. These segments usually involve the <a href="/wiki/Simpson_family" id="w">Simpson family</a> in some <a href="/wiki/Horror_film" id="w">horror</a>, <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" id="w">science fiction</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Supernatural" id="w">supernatural</a> setting. Considered <a href="/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" id="w">non-canon</a>, they always take place outside the normal continuity of the show and completely abandon any pretense of being realistic. The first <i>Treehouse of Horror</i> episode aired on <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a> as part of the <a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons_(season_2)" id="w">second season</a> and was inspired by <a href="/wiki/EC_Comics" id="w">EC Comics</a> horror tales. As of 2007, there are 18 <i>Treehouse of Horror</i> episodes, with one airing every year. The episodes are known for being more violent than an average <i>Simpsons</i> episode and contain several trademarks, including the alien characters <a href="/wiki/Kang_and_Kodos" id="w">Kang and Kodos</a>, &#34;scary names&#34; in the credits, a special version of the opening sequence, and parodies of horror and science fiction films. The show&#39;s staff regard the <i>Treehouse of Horror</i> as being particularily difficult to produce as the scripts often go through many rewrites, and the animators typically have to design new characters and backgrounds. </p>
<p>Many of the episodes are popular among fans and critics of the show and have inspired a whole off-shoot of <i>Simpsons</i> merchandise, including action figures, playsets, video games, books, DVDs, comic books and a special version of <i><a href="/wiki/Monopoly_(game)" id="w">Monopoly</a></i>. Several of the episodes have won awards for animation and sound editing. In 1996, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VI" id="w">Treehouse of Horror VI</a>&#34; was nominated for the <a href="/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award" id="w">Primetime Emmy Award</a> in the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Animated_Program_(For_Programming_less_than_One_Hour)" id="w">Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)</a>&#34; category, but it ultimately lost.</p>
<a id="Segments" name="Segments"></a><h1>Segments</h1>
<p><i>Treehouse of Horror</i> episodes typically consist of four parts: an opening and Halloween-themed version of the credits as well as three segments. These segments usually have a horror, science fiction or fantasy theme and quite often are parodies of films, novels, plays, television shows, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone_(1959_TV_series)" id="w">The Twilight Zone</a></i> episodes, or old issues of <a href="/wiki/EC_Comics" id="w">EC Comics</a>. Although they are sometimes connected by &#34;wraparounds&#34;, the three segments rarely have any kind of continuing connection within the segment. The exception is &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_V" id="w">Treehouse of Horror V</a>&#34;, in which <a href="/wiki/Groundskeeper_Willie" id="w">Groundskeeper Willie</a> is killed by an axe in a similar fashion in all three segments.<sup id="_ref-Mirkin5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mirkin5" title="">[1]</a></sup> The segments are considered to be non-canon and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show.<sup id="_ref-Groening1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Groening1" title="">[2]</a></sup> From &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror" id="w">Treehouse of Horror</a>&#34; to &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_XIII" id="w">Treehouse of Horror XIII</a>&#34;, all three segments were written by different writers.

Every <i>Treehouse of Horror</i> episode opens with a special introductory segment. The first, second and fifth <i>Treehouse of Horror</i> episodes open with <a href="/wiki/Marge_Simpson" id="w">Marge</a> standing on a stage and warning parents about the content of the episode, advising them to put their children to bed. The warning in the first episode was put in as a sincere effort to warn young viewers, as the producers felt it was somewhat scary.<sup id="_ref-Jean1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jean1" title="">[11]</a></sup> The entire segment was a parody of the opening of the 1931 film <i><a href="/wiki/Frankenstein_(1931_film)" id="w">Frankenstein</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Reiss1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reiss1" title="">[12]</a></sup> Marge&#39;s warnings became a burden to write as the years went on and there was no warning for third and fourth <i>Treehouse of Horror</i>s. The tradition was revived for &#34;Treehouse of Horror V&#34; and after that, they were permanently dropped<sup id="_ref-Jean2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jean2" title="">[13]</a></sup> and the writers did not make any attempts at reviving them.<sup id="_ref-Oakley6_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oakley6" title="">[10]</a></sup> Other <i>Treehouse of Horror</i> episodes open with parodies, for example &#34;Treehouse of Horror III&#34; had Homer introduce the episode in a way similar to <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" id="w">Alfred Hitchcock</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents" id="w">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a></i><sup id="_ref-III_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-III" title="">[14]</a></sup> and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_V" id="w">Treehouse of Horror V</a>&#34; featured a parody of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Outer_Limits" id="w">The Outer Limits</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-V_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-V" title="">[15]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VI" id="w">sixth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VII" id="w">seventh</a> episodes featured short clips with no lines because the episodes had run long and longer segments were cut.<sup id="_ref-Oakley6_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Oakley6" title="">[10]</a></sup> Following &#34;Treehouse of Horror VII&#34;, the opening can be upwards of a minute long and sometimes feature an introduction by a character, such as <a href="/wiki/Montgomery_Burns" id="w">Mr. Burns</a> in &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_XVII" id="w">Treehouse of Horror XVII</a>&#34;<sup id="_ref-XVII_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-XVII" title="">[8]</a></sup> or include over the top violence, such as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VIII" id="w">Treehouse of Horror VIII</a>&#34; which shows a <a href="/wiki/FOX_Network" id="w">FOX Network</a> censor being  brutally murdered and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_XIV" id="w">Treehouse of Horror XIV</a>&#34; which showed the Simpson family killing each other.<sup id="_ref-XIV_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-XIV" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the opening segment of the first five episodes, the camera zooms through a cemetery where tombstones with humorous messages written on them can be seen. These messages include the names of canceled shows from the previous season, celebrities such as <a href="/wiki/Walt_Disney" id="w">Walt Disney</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jim_Morrison" id="w">Jim Morrison</a><sup id="_ref-II_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-II" title="">[16]</a></sup> and other messages such as one that read &#34;TV violence&#34;, but was then filled with bullet holes. They were last used in &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_V" id="w">Treehouse of Horror V</a>&#34;, which included a single tombstone with the words &#34;Amusing Tombstones&#34; to signal this.<sup id="_ref-V_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-V" title="">[15]</a></sup> The Tombstone gags were easy for the writers in the first episode, but like Marge&#39;s warnings, they eventually got more difficult to write, so they were abandoned.<sup id="_ref-Reiss1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reiss1" title="">[12]</a></sup> Another reason they were dropped was because the tombstones would list television shows that had been canceled the previous season and after a few years, several of the shows that were canceled were produced by ex-<i>Simpsons</i> writers.<sup id="_ref-Groening5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Groening5" title="">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>While the early <i>Treehouse of Horror</i> episodes featured a Halloween themed opening sequence, the later ones only included the title and the &#34;created by&#34; and &#34;developed by&#34; credits. Every episode between &#34;Treehouse of Horror II&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_X" id="w">Treehouse of Horror X</a>&#34; featured a couch gag with a Halloween theme, examples of which included the Simpson family dressed as skeletons,<sup id="_ref-II_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-II" title="">[16]</a></sup> Zombies<sup id="_ref-IV_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IV" title="">[3]</a></sup> and characters from previous Halloween episodes.<sup id="_ref-X_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-X" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

Two characters that are virtually exclusive to the <i>Treehouse of Horror</i> series are <a href="/wiki/Kang_and_Kodos" id="w">Kang and Kodos</a>, who are a pair of large green space aliens who were introduced in the &#34;Hungry are the Damned&#34; segment of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror" id="w">Treehouse of Horror</a>&#34;. Kang and Kodos have since appeared in every <i>Treehouse of Horror</i> episode, sometimes as important parts of a story, but often just for brief cameos.

The first <i>Treehouse of Horror</i> episode aired in 1990 as part of <a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons_(season_2)" id="w">the second season</a>, and its on-screen title was &#34;The Simpsons Hallowe&#39;en Special.&#34; It was inspired by <a href="/wiki/EC_Comics" id="w">EC Comics</a> Horror tales.<sup id="_ref-Jean1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jean1" title="">[11]</a></sup> Although every episode is entitled &#34;Treehouse of Horror&#34;, the first one was the only episode that actually used the treehouse motif.<sup id="_ref-Groening1_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Groening1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Treehouse of Horror episodes are difficult for both the writers and the animators.<sup id="_ref-Reiss1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reiss1" title="">[12]</a></sup> The episodes were originally written at the beginning of the production run, but in later seasons they were written at the end and aired at the beginning of the next season as holdovers, thus giving the animators more time to work.<sup id="_ref-Jean1_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jean1" title="">[11]</a></sup> Part of the difficulty for the animators is that the episodes always involve many complex backgrounds, new characters, and new designs.<sup id="_ref-Jean1_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jean1" title="">[11]</a></sup> They are difficult for the writers because they must produce three stories, an opening and, in the early episodes, a wraparound. They would have to try to fit all of this into a 20-22 minute episode.<sup id="_ref-Mirkin4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mirkin4" title="">[36]</a></sup> The episodes often go through many last minute changes such as rewrites, and new lines are recorded.<sup id="_ref-Reiss2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reiss2" title="">[37]</a></sup> &#34;Treehouse of Horror III&#34; in particular underwent somewhere between 80 and 100 line changes in the six week period between when the animation came back from Korea and the airing of the episode.<sup id="_ref-Jean3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jean3" title="">[22]</a></sup> By the fourth season, executive producers <a href="/wiki/Al_Jean" id="w">Al Jean</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mike_Reiss" id="w">Mike Reiss</a> were less enamored with <i>Treehouse of Horror</i> episodes and considered dropping them, but the other writers insisted that they be kept.<sup id="_ref-Jean3_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jean3" title="">[22]</a></sup>

Part of the attraction for the writers is that they are able to break the rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode.<sup id="_ref-Groening1_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Groening1" title="">[2]</a></sup> In some cases, the writers will have an idea that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode and are used as segments.<sup id="_ref-Jean1_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jean1" title="">[11]</a></sup> Several of the writers, former executive producer <a href="/wiki/David_Mirkin" id="w">David Mirkin</a> among them, believe that the episodes should be scary and not just funny.<sup id="_ref-Mirkin4_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mirkin4" title="">[36]</a></sup> &#34;Treehouse of Horror V&#34; has been described by Mirkin as being &#34;the most intense, disturbing Halloween show ever&#34; as it was filled with violence and gore in response to new censorship rules.<sup id="_ref-Mirkin5_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mirkin5" title="">[1]</a></sup> Although gruesome for the most part, some segments, such as &#34;Citizen Kang&#34; in &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VII" id="w">Treehouse of Horror VII</a>&#34;, satirize political issues. In &#34;<a href="/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_XVII" id="w">Treehouse of Horror XVII</a>&#34;, a segment called &#34;The Day the Earth Looked Stupid&#34; ends with Kang and Kodos taking over Springfield as part of a mission called &#34;Operation: Enduring occupation&#34;. The script originally called for Kodos and Kang to look over the smoking ruins of Springfield and say &#34;This sure is a lot like Iraq will be.&#34; The Fox network did not have any objection to the line, but it was rejected by some of the writers as too obvious and was cut from broadcast.

<p>Although the series is meant to be seen on Halloween, in recent years new episodes have premiered in November.
