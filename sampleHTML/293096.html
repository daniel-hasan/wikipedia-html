<b>Thomas Carmichael Hindman, Jr.</b> (<a href="/wiki/January_28" id="w">January 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1828" id="w">1828</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1868" id="w">1868</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Lawyer" id="w">lawyer</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" id="w">United States Representative</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Arkansas%26%2339%3Bs_1st_congressional_district" id="w">1st Congressional District</a> of <a href="/wiki/Arkansas" id="w">Arkansas</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Major_General" id="w">Major General</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_Army" id="w">Confederate States Army</a> during the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>.<sup id="_ref-Bioguide_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bioguide" title="">[1]</a></sup> Shortly after he was born in <a href="/wiki/Knoxville%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Knoxville, Tennessee</a>, Hindman moved with his family to <a href="/wiki/Jacksonville%2C_Alabama" id="w">Jacksonville, Alabama</a> and later <a href="/wiki/Ripley%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Ripley, Mississippi</a>. After receiving his primary education in Ripley, he attended the <a href="/wiki/Lawrenceville_School" id="w">Lawrenceville Classical Institute</a> (now known as the Lawrenceville School) and graduated with honors on <a href="/wiki/September_25" id="w">September 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1843" id="w">1843</a>. Afterwards, he raised a <a href="/wiki/Company_(military_unit)" id="w">company</a> in <a href="/wiki/Tippah_County%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Tippah County</a> for the 2nd <a href="/wiki/Mississippi" id="w">Mississippi</a>  regiment in the <a href="/wiki/Mexican-American_War" id="w">Mexican-American War</a>. Hindman served during the war as a <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant" id="w">lieutenant</a> and later as a <a href="/wiki/Captain#Military" id="w">captain</a> of his company. After the war, he returned to Ripley. He studied <a href="/wiki/Law" id="w">law</a>, and was admitted to the state bar in <a href="/wiki/1851" id="w">1851</a>. He then started a law practice in Ripley, before moving it to <a href="/wiki/Helena%2C_Arkansas" id="w">Helena</a> two years later. </p>
<p>Hindman then served as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Mississippi House of Representatives</a> from 1854 to 1856. He was elected as the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic</a> representative from Arkansas&#39;s 1st congressional district in the <a href="/wiki/36th_United_States_Congress" id="w">Thirty-sixth Congress</a> from <a href="/wiki/March_4" id="w">March 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1859" id="w">1859</a> to <a href="/wiki/March_4" id="w">March 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1861" id="w">1861</a>. He was re-elected to the <a href="/wiki/37th_United_States_Congress" id="w">Thirty-seventh Congress</a>, but declined to serve after the onset of the Civil War and Arkansas&#39;s secession from the Union. Instead, Hindman joined the armed forces of the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" id="w">Confederacy</a>. He commanded the <a href="/wiki/Trans-Mississippi_Theater_of_the_American_Civil_War" id="w">Trans-Mississippi Department</a>, and later raised and commanded &#34;Hindman&#39;s legion&#34; for the Confederate States Army. He was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Brigadier_general" id="w">brigadier general</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_28" id="w">September 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1861" id="w">1861</a> and later to Major General on <a href="/wiki/April_18" id="w">April 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1862" id="w">1862</a>. After the war, Hindman avoided surrender to the federal government by fleeing to <a href="/wiki/Mexico_City" id="w">Mexico City</a>. He worked in Mexico as a coffee planter, and attempted to practice law. After the execution of <a href="/wiki/Maximilian_I_of_Mexico" id="w">Maximilian I of Mexico</a>, Hindman submitted a petition for a pardon to President <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Johnson" id="w">Andrew Johnson</a>, but it was denied. Hindman, nonetheless, returned back to his former life in Helena.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> He became the leader of the &#34;Young Democracy&#34;, a new political organization that was willing to accept the <a href="/wiki/Reconstruction" id="w">Reconstruction</a> for the restoration of the <a href="/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)" id="w">Union</a>. Unexpectedly, he was assassinated by an unknown individual on <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1868" id="w">1868</a> at his Helena home.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Family_background" name="Family_background"></a><h1>Family background</h1>
<p>Hindman&#39;s parents, Thomas and Sallie Holt, were of English and Scottish ancestry.<sup id="_ref-p1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p1" title="">[4]</a></sup> His maternal ancestors included Major Robert Holt, a successful planter and a member of the <a href="/wiki/Virginia" id="w">Virginia</a> <a href="/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Burgesses" id="w">House of Burgesses</a> in 1655. The Holt family originally came from <a href="/wiki/Halifax_County%2C_Virginia" id="w">Halifax County, Virginia</a> before moving to Knoxville. Hindman&#39;s paternal lineage descended from the Carmichael clan in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" id="w">Scotland</a>, some members of which made their way into America after <a href="/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain" id="w">King George II of Great Britain</a> ousted nine hundred Scottish followers of <a href="/wiki/Charles_Edward_Stuart" id="w">Bonnie Prince Charles</a> to America after the <a href="/wiki/April_16" id="w">April 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1746" id="w">1746</a> <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Culloden" id="w">Battle of Culloden</a>.<sup id="_ref-p1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p1" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>One of the descendants of the Carmichael clan, Sarah Carmichael, married Samuel Hindman, a wealthy <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a> merchant in the early 1790s. They then moved to Knoxville, and their youngest son Thomas C. Hindman, Sr. was born on <a href="/wiki/November_10" id="w">November 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1793" id="w">1793</a>. Family legend claims that Hindman, Sr. was the first white male child born in Knoxville.<sup id="_ref-CV_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CV" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>

He was promoted to third lieutenant on <a href="/wiki/January_11" id="w">January 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1814" id="w">1814</a> and to second lieutenant on May 20 of the same year. He fought in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans" id="w">Battle of New Orleans</a>, the final major battle of the war, and served in active duty until he resigned on <a href="/wiki/June_30" id="w">June 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1816" id="w">1816</a> due to health concerns.<sup id="_ref-CV_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CV" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> After leaving the army, Hindman, Sr. operated a military ferry on the <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_River" id="w">Tennessee River</a> and served as a lieutenant colonel in the 10th Territorial Militia Regiment for the <a href="/wiki/Alabama_Territory" id="w">Alabama Territory</a>. In his dealings as a merchant, he met Lewis Ross. Hindman, Sr. was a frequent visitor at the Ross household, and it was there that he met Lewis&#39;s sister-in-law, Sallie Holt.<sup id="_ref-p2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p2" title="">[10]</a></sup> After a brief courtship, the couple was married in Knoxville on <a href="/wiki/January_21" id="w">January 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1819" id="w">1819</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> After settling down in <a href="/wiki/Rhea_County%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Rhea County, Tennessee</a>, their first daughter was born in 1820. Three more children, Robert, Mary, and Sarah, were born after the family moved to Post Oak Springs. The family moved back to Knoxville in 1827. Thomas Carmichael Hindman Jr. was born the next year, and Mildred followed in the year after that.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h1>Early life</h1>
<p>The elder Hindman frequently made business trips to <a href="/wiki/Alabama" id="w">Alabama</a>, and even moved the family to Jacksonville, Alabama after buying several lots of land there. Hindman took advantage of the many local business opportunities and was able to provide his family with whatever they needed. Hindman Sr. gained a reputation for honesty with his business associates, which included <a href="/wiki/Cherokee" id="w">Cherokee Indian</a> tribes in the area.<sup id="_ref-p3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p3" title="">[13]</a></sup> He became trusted by the <a href="/wiki/Cherokee_Nation" id="w">Cherokee Nation</a> and was appointed as the sub-agent to the Cherokees by <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" id="w">President</a> <a href="/wiki/James_Monroe" id="w">James Monroe</a>. When President Andrew Jackson was in office, Hindman, Sr. was appointed to the post of United States Agent for the Cherokee Nation.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The elder Hindman frequently traveled to Washington D.C. to discuss the interests of the Cherokee Nation and, in 1841, he was assigned by Acting <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War" id="w">Secretary of War</a> Albert M. Lea to determine why the Cherokees in <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a> had rejected the government&#39;s suggestion to join other parts of the tribe in Indian Territory.<sup id="_ref-p3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p3" title="">[13]</a></sup> Hindman spent almost two months unsuccessfully trying to persuade the North Carolina Cherokees to &#34;rejoin the nation in the West.&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>That year, Hindman&#39;s father purchased a new plantation in Ripley, Mississippi. Meanwhile, the younger Hindman attended local schools before leaving for the <a href="/wiki/Lawrenceville_Classical_Institute" id="w">Lawrenceville Classical Institute</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lawrenceville%2C_New_Jersey" id="w">Lawrenceville, New Jersey</a>, the third oldest boarding school in the country.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Encyclopedia_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyclopedia" title="">[17]</a></sup> Hindman received a classical education there and graduated with honors on <a href="/wiki/September_25" id="w">September 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1843" id="w">1843</a>,<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> as the class <a href="/wiki/Salutatorian" id="w">salutatorian</a>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> After spending some time visiting relatives and studying in New York, Hindman went back to Ripley and commenced his law studies under Orlando Davis, a notable local attorney and <a href="/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Whig Party</a> politician.<sup id="_ref-CV_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CV" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hindman&#39;s father became an active participant in Mississippi politics. He led the state&#39;s Whig Party and served as a member on the executive committee of the local <a href="/wiki/Henry_Clay" id="w">Henry Clay</a> club. In 1845, he was selected as a delegate to attend a convention in <a href="/wiki/Memphis%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Memphis, Tennessee</a> that promoted transportation and infrastructural projects in the South and West.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Participation_in_the_Mexican-American_War" name="Participation_in_the_Mexican-American_War"></a><h1>Participation in the Mexican-American War</h1>
<p>Soon, the United States Army engaged in fighting at the US-Mexico border. After skirmishes along the <a href="/wiki/Rio_Grande" id="w">Rio Grande</a> between Mexican forces and American forces led by <a href="/wiki/General" id="w">General</a> <a href="/wiki/Zachary_Taylor" id="w">Zachary Taylor</a>, Congress approved a declaration of war and President <a href="/wiki/James_K._Polk" id="w">James K. Polk</a> called upon the states to draw up 50,000 volunteers to be alongside the army. Mississippi newspapers encouraged state residents to join the action. One newspaper, the <a href="/wiki/Holly_Springs%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Holly Springs</a> <i>Guard</i>, proclaimed, &#34;To arms! To arms! Ye brave! Th&#39; avenging sword unsheathe: March on, march on, all hearts resolved, on [to] victory or death.&#34;<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Hindman was eager to have the chance of serving his country in war. He enlisted as a <a href="/wiki/Second_Lieutenant" id="w">Second Lieutenant</a> in <a href="/wiki/Company_(military)" id="w">company</a> E of the Second Mississippi Infantry.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> His older brother, Robert, also joined the same unit as a private.<sup id="_ref-Robert_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Robert" title="">[24]</a></sup> Hindman and his fellow infantrymen spent the winter training for battle in Camp McClung. Many soldiers were unprepared for the cold temperatures in January 1847 and, as a result, many died of <a href="/wiki/Influenza" id="w">influenza</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" id="w">pneumonia</a> and &#34;the cold plague.&#34;<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> The Second Mississippi Infantry headed off towards the <a href="/wiki/United_States%E2%80%93Mexico_border" id="w">United States–Mexico border</a> in February and reached the mouth of the Rio Grande on <a href="/wiki/February_24" id="w">February 24</a>, <a href="/wiki/1847" id="w">1847</a>, just a day after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Buena_Vista" id="w">Battle of Buena Vista</a>. They continued marching, and the number of dead soldiers escalated. By June 1847, 167 men had died, 134 had been discharged and 38 had deserted.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> The infantry later moved to Buena Vista, seven miles south of <a href="/wiki/Saltillo%2C_Coahuila" id="w">Saltillo, Coahuila</a>, for guard duty. The anticipation of glory for the regiment evaporated amongst the ravages of disease, guerrilla raids and camp duties. In March 1847, Colonel Charles Clark assigned Hindman the position of appointment as the acting regiment’s adjutant, due to his educational background and writing skills.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Hindman&#39;s brother, Robert, who was now a sergeant, suffered from smallpox and was medically discharged on April 23.<sup id="_ref-Robert_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Robert" title="">[24]</a></sup> Hindman rose to the rank of lieutenant and Post Adjutant by the end of the war in <a href="/wiki/1848" id="w">1848</a>, but did not see any major action during the remainder of his time with the infantry.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Back_in_Mississippi" name="Back_in_Mississippi"></a><h1>Back in Mississippi</h1>
<p>After returning back to Ripley, Hindman continued his law studies under Orlando Davis. A year after the war ended Hindman&#39;s brother, Robert, engaged in a fight with William Falkner because he had thought Falkner tried to block his membership into the Ripley section of the <a href="/wiki/Sons_of_Temperance" id="w">Sons of Temperance</a>. Robert Hindman tried to defend himself, but his gun failed to fire, and Falkner then fatally stabbed him. Falkner was tried for murder, but was acquitted by the jury ruling that he was acting in self-defense.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Afterwards, Falkner killed a family friend of the Hindmans, and he again was acquitted in the murder trial.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Thomas Hindman and Falkner engaged in a gun fight, but neither man was injured. The tense relationship between Falkner and Hindman culminated in a settlement made by Matthew C. Galloway, who would later become the future editor of the Memphis, Tennessee <i>Appeal</i>.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Hindman himself joined the Ripley chapter of the Sons of Temperance and served as the recording secretary of the local branch. In 1853, he successfully campaigned for a seat to represent Tippah County in the Mississippi legislature. Hindman&#39;s Mississippi lawmaking career ended when the legislature adjourned in March 1854.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>

By 1854, Hindman realized that he had little room to maneuver in the crowded Mississippi political arena. Looking across the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a>, Hindman observed that the young and turbulent State of Arkansas was wide open for a well educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics when he moved to Helena, Arkansas on <a href="/wiki/March_18" id="w">March 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1854" id="w">1854</a>.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hindman threw himself into the political and social scenes in his new home state. In June 1854, he formed a law partnership with John Palmer, a young Kentucky native who was known as a &#34;distinguished member&#34; of the Helena bar. Hindman became active in civic affairs and plans for Helena&#39;s economic development.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> At an Independence Day festival in 1854, he gave a speech about the importance of railroad development in Arkansas.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> Hindman catapulted himself into the fray by taking a stand against the anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic <a href="/wiki/Know-Nothing_movement" id="w">Know-Nothings</a>, whom he considered &#34;pestilent fanatics.&#34;<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> Hindman and Palmer established a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party" id="w">Democratic</a> association designed to stamp out the Know-Nothing threat. During this time, Hindman became close friends with <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Cleburne" id="w">Patrick Cleburne</a>, who would later parallel his course as a Confederate Major General. The two men also formed a business partnership with William Weatherly to buy a newspaper, the <i>Democratic Star</i>, in December 1855.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Cleburne and Hindman were both wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena with Know-Nothing members. After the men recovered, they appeared before a grand jury to respond to any charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterwards, went to Hindman&#39;s parents&#39; house in Mississippi.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> Hindman received praise for his actions and became a force in Democratic politics after the Know-Nothings were defeated.</p>
<p>In 1856, Hindman ran for the Congressional seat in his First District, but was defeated by the incumbent, <a href="/wiki/Alfred_B._Greenwood" id="w">Alfred B. Greenwood</a>, at the Democratic state convention.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> His gracious withdrawal at the convention to avoid Democratic infighting earned him more notice from the party hierarchy. During this time, Hindman met and courted Mary &#34;Mollie&#34; Watkins Biscoe. Despite her parents&#39; reluctance, the two were married on <a href="/wiki/November_11" id="w">November 11</a>, <a href="/wiki/1856" id="w">1856</a>, with Patrick Cleburne serving as best man.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the summer of 1857, Hindman became editor of the <i>Helena States-Rights Democrat</i><sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> and was the unchallenged leader of the Democratic Party in eastern Arkansas.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> From this platform, he launched his 1858 Congressional bid. He did not face a serious challenge for the Democratic nomination and he had the backing of newspapers through the state. Editor Richard H. Johnson of the <a href="/wiki/Little_Rock%2C_Arkansas" id="w">Little Rock</a> <i>True Democrat</i> reminded voters of Hindman&#39;s previous run for the nomination in 1856 and praised him for being a &#34;thorough going Democrat&#34; of &#34;marked abilities.&#34;<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> At the state Democratic convention in <a href="/wiki/Batesville%2C_Arkansas" id="w">Batesville</a>, Hindman easily defeated A.

<p>During his term, Hindman tried to bring unity to the state&#39;s Democratic Party. He turned on the political hierarchy in the state, and political warfare divided the Democratic Party in Arkansas, with the pro-Hindman forces on one side and the forces of the political &#34;family&#34; that had ruled Arkansas since territorial days on the other. He labeled the actions of the &#34;family&#34; as &#34;the most concentrated wrath of the small managers of the caucus and of certain outside high-priests who manage[d] them.&#34;<sup id="_ref-p47_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p47" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#34;Family&#34; leaders threatened to block Hindman&#39;s 1860 re-election to Congress. Hindman challenged them and predicted the overthrow of a group he called &#34;the fusionists&#34; and &#34;champions of amalgamation.&#34;<sup id="_ref-p47_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p47" title="">[48]</a></sup> The dispute between Hindman and the political family escalated after Hindman charged that the state had been overpaying the <i>True Democrat</i> for public printing. The <i>True Democrat</i> denied the allegations and claimed that Hindman&#39;s motive was out of selfishness, rather than concern. They argued that he wanted printing contracts to be awarded to the Helena <i>State-Rights Democrat</i> and the Little Rock <i>Old Line Democrat</i>, both of which he controlled.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the &#34;family&#34; leaders, <a href="/wiki/Elias_Nelson_Conway" id="w">Elias Nelson Conway</a>, sought to settle the state&#39;s banking situation by starting a plan that would seize the assets of people indebted to the bank, who included Hindman&#39;s father-in-law.<sup id="_ref-Encyclopedia_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyclopedia" title="">[17]</a></sup> Hindman travelled across the state to publicly denounce the proposition. In the 1860 race for governor, Hindman backed <a href="/wiki/Henry_Massey_Rector" id="w">Henry Massey Rector</a>,<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> while the &#34;family&#34; candidate was Richard H.

As the American Civil War approached, Hindman was an ardent voice for secession and was essentially Arkansas&#39;s most prominent <a href="/wiki/Fire-Eaters" id="w">Fire-Eater</a>. When Arkansas voted 65-5 to secede from the <a href="/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)" id="w">Union</a> in May of 1861, Hindman was present in the gallery of the convention.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> With war approaching, Hindman resigned from Congress and recruited a regiment at Helena, which was mustered into Confederate service. He requested the state government for muskets, clothing and ten days of rations so that his men could &#34;fight for our country.&#34;<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> By <a href="/wiki/June_1" id="w">June 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1861" id="w">1861</a>, Hindman had raised ten companies, six stationed at Helena and four at <a href="/wiki/Pine_Bluff%2C_Arkansas" id="w">Pine Bluff</a>. He lost five companies who refused to leave the state to fight. Afterwards, Hindman followed orders to report to <a href="/wiki/Richmond%2C_Virginia" id="w">Richmond, Virginia</a>.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> He began the long journey with his regiment in June. By September 1861, Hindman was promoted to the rank of <a href="/wiki/Brigadier_General" id="w">Brigadier General</a>.<sup id="_ref-Encyclopedia_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyclopedia" title="">[17]</a></sup>
He and his regiment were soon active participants in the disastrous Kentucky Campaign, followed soon thereafter by fierce fighting at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh" id="w">Battle of Shiloh</a> in April 1862, where he was slightly wounded.<sup id="_ref-Encyclopedia_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyclopedia" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>After his recovery, Hindman was promoted to the rank of Major General and was appointed commander of the Trans-Mississippi Department to prevent an invasion by the Union troops led by <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Curtis" id="w">Samuel Curtis</a>.<sup id="_ref-Encyclopedia_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyclopedia" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> Events in Arkansas had taken a terrible turn for the worst. Most units had been stripped from the state for service east of the Mississippi River. When Hindman arrived in <a href="/wiki/Little_Rock%2C_Arkansas" id="w">Little Rock, Arkansas</a>, he found that his command was &#34;bare of soldiers, penniless, defenseless, and dreadfully exposed&#34; to the Federal Army that was approaching dangerously from the northwest.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hindman set to work and issued a series of harsh military edicts, instituting conscription, authorizing guerrilla warfare and requisitioning supplies for the defense of the State.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state&#39;s defenses. He also diverted <a href="/wiki/Texas" id="w">Texas</a> troops bound for Virginia for use in the defense of Arkansas.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear that they did not have an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>

Hindman&#39;s edicts, however, raised the ire of the local citizenry and they, and Hindman&#39;s political enemies, demanded that the Confederate leaders in Richmond replace him. By August of 1862, the authorities in Richmond decided to replace him with the well-meaning but incompetent <a href="/wiki/Theophilus_H._Holmes" id="w">Theophilus H. Holmes</a>.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> Hindman convinced Holmes to give him a field command in northern Arkansas and he proceeded with a plan to drive out the invader.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> Hindman aggressively moved into northwest Arkansas and managed to intercept the Federal army while it was divided into two parts. At this moment, however, Hindman&#39;s normally aggressive style gave way to uncharacteristic doubt. Rather than attack the divided pieces of the Federal army, Hindman entrenched himself at <a href="/wiki/Prairie_Grove%2C_Arkansas" id="w">Prairie Grove, Arkansas</a>, allowing the Federal forces to recombine and assault him.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hindman&#39;s position was well selected, but the better equipped and supplied Federal forces wore down the Confederate forces and Hindman was forced to withdraw back towards Little Rock, having missed his chance to destroy the Federal army. After the stalemate at Prairie Grove, Hindman was transferred back across the river and participated in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Chickamauga" id="w">Battle of Chickamauga</a> alongside his friend Pat Cleburne.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> After being wounded in the neck at Chickamauga,<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> Hindman and his legion continued to fight along with the <a href="/wiki/Army_of_Tennessee" id="w">Army of Tennessee</a> against General <a href="/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman" id="w">William Tecumseh Sherman</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Campaign" id="w">Atlanta Campaign</a>, across north Georgia from the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Dalton" id="w">Battle of Dalton</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Kennesaw_Mountain" id="w">Battle of Kennesaw Mountain</a>, just outside <a href="/wiki/Marietta%2C_Georgia" id="w">Marietta, Georgia</a>. On <a href="/wiki/July_4" id="w">July 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1864" id="w">1864</a>, at Kennesaw Mountain he was struck in the eye by a tree limb and fell off his horse. Hindman suffered severe injuries that left him unfit for service on the battlefield. He went to Atlanta and later <a href="/wiki/Macon%2C_Georgia" id="w">Macon, Georgia</a> to recuperate from his injuries.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> Afterwards, Hindman hoped that he would be able to fight after a full recovery. He applied for a transfer to the Trans-Mississippi Department. His request was denied by the Confederate War Department, but <a href="/wiki/Jefferson_Davis" id="w">Jefferson Davis</a> offered Hindman a leave of absence until he had fully recovered from his &#34;physical disability&#34;.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> After his leave of absence was approved in August, Hindman set out for Texas. During their journey, Hindman&#39;s second daughter, Sallie, died of an illness near <a href="/wiki/Meridian%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Meridian, Mississippi</a>.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> Hindman arrived in <a href="/wiki/San_Antonio" id="w">San Antonio</a> and settled there with his family for the time being. He was honored by military officials and local residents on <a href="/wiki/January_26" id="w">January 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/1865" id="w">1865</a>.<sup id="_ref-p200_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p200" title="">[71]</a></sup> By May 1865, Confederate generals in <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans" id="w">New Orleans</a> signed a document with Union generals detailing the Confederate terms of surrender.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> Hindman refused to surrender and, along with many other ex-Confederates, he crossed the Rio Grande into <a href="/wiki/Mexico" id="w">Mexico</a> and sought asylum.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>

Hindman joined Confederate refugees in the Mexican town of Carolota, where he engaged in coffee planting and attempted to practice law. By April 1867, he was confident enough in the situation at home to return to Arkansas and apply to President Andrew Johnson for a pardon.<sup id="_ref-p200_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p200" title="">[71]</a></sup> Hindman&#39;s application was one of the few denied. Nonetheless, he attempted to return to his former life. Politics still called to him and, although ineligible to run for office, he came out against the Reconstruction Constitution, which put him in direct conflict with reconstruction authorities.<sup id="_ref-Encyclopedia_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Encyclopedia" title="">[17]</a></sup> These authorities revived a <a href="/wiki/Treason" id="w">treason</a> indictment against him and had him arrested. This did not stop Hindman, who went on the political circuit and had some success building an unlikely coalition of newly freed slaves and Democrats.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Assassination" name="Assassination"></a><h2> Assassination </h2>
<p>At around 9:30 on the night of <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1868" id="w">1868</a>, Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his newspaper with his children. The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss, ending the life of Arkansas&#39; highest ranking Confederate military officer.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters, from the porch of his house.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> With &#34;perfect composure&#34;, Hindman told listeners to &#34;unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people&#34;. Hindman hinted at the recent political debate with <a href="/wiki/Powell_Clayton" id="w">Powell Clayton</a> as a possible motivation for the shooting and said, &#34;I do not know who killed me; but I can say, whoever it was, I forgive him.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Nash_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nash" title="">[77]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Biscoe_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Biscoe" title="">[78]</a></sup> He asked James H. O&#39;Connor, the husband of Mollie&#39;s stepmother, to &#34;take care of my family and be a protector to my wife and dear little ones.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Nash_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Nash" title="">[77]</a></sup> After O&#39;Connor accepted, Hindman stated, &#34;I forgive everybody, and hope they will forgive me.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Biscoe_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Biscoe" title="">[78]</a></sup> Afterwards, he was too weak to continue speaking, and he sat down on a lounge. He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the <i>Gazette</i> said Hindman died as an &#34;able and distinguished man&#34; whose &#34;short but splendid career&#34; had a profound impact on Arkansan state politics.<sup id="_ref-p234_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p234" title="">[79]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Hindman&#39;s assassins were never caught, and many theories regarding their identities have circulated throughout the years. In 1869, a white prisoner at the <a href="/wiki/Phillips_County%2C_Arkansas" id="w">Phillips County</a> jail told officials that he overheard two black inmates, Sip Cameron and Heyward Grant, discussing the crime. Grant supposedly confessed to the crime, saying the murder was part of a larger plot to seek revenge for the killing of Lee Morrison, a black individual from Helena who had been hanged on <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/1868" id="w">1868</a>.<sup id="_ref-p234_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-p234" title="">[79]</a></sup> Grant&#39;s claims did not corroborate with the facts of the murder and his statements were dismissed from the investigation.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> No further leads ever developed, so the case was never reopened. Hindman was buried at Evergreen Cemetery (later named Maple Hill Cemetery) in Helena, near the grave of his friend Patrick Cleburne.</p>
