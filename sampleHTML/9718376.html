<b>Fashion in the period 1900-1909</b> in European and European-influenced countries continued the long elegant lines of the <a href="/wiki/1890s_in_fashion" id="w">1890s</a>.  Tall, stiff collars characterize the period, as do women&#39;s broad hats and full &#34;<a href="/wiki/Gibson_girl" id="w">Gibson girl</a>&#34; hairstyles.  A new, columnar silhouette introduced by the <i><a href="/wiki/Fashion_designer" id="w">couturiers</a></i> of <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> late in the decade signaled the approaching abandonment of the <a href="/wiki/Corset" id="w">corset</a> as an indispensable garment of fashionable women.</p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Paul Poiret&#39;s new silhouette of 1908 was a radical departure.</div></div>
</p>
<p>The fashionable silhouette in the early 1900s was that of a mature woman, with full low bust and curvy hips.  The &#34;health <a href="/wiki/Corset" id="w">corset</a>&#34; of this period removed pressure from the abdomen and created an <a href="/wiki/S-curve" id="w">S-curve</a> silhouette.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Blouses and dresses were full in front and puffed into a &#34;pouter-pigeon&#34; look over the narrow waist, which sloped from back to front and was often accented with a sash or belt.</p>
<p>Skirts brushed the floor, often with a <a href="/wiki/Train_(clothing)" id="w">train</a>, even for day dresses, in mid-decade. </p>
<p>Around 1908, the <a href="/wiki/Fashion_house" id="w">fashion houses</a> of Paris began to show a new silhouette, with a thicker waist, flatter bust, and narrower hips.  By the end of the decade the most fashionable skirts cleared the floor and approached the ankle.  The overall silhouette narrowed and straightened, beginning a trend that would continue into the years leading up to the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">Great War</a>.</p>
<a id="Lingerie_dresses" name="Lingerie_dresses"></a><h2>Lingerie dresses</h2>
<p>Frothy washable day dresses of translucent <a href="/wiki/Linen" id="w">linen</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cotton" id="w">cotton</a>, called <i>lingerie dresses</i>, were worn in warm climates.  These were trimmed lavishly with tiny <a href="/wiki/Tuck_(sewing)" id="w">pintucks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lace" id="w">lace</a> insertions, <a href="/wiki/Embroidery" id="w">embroidery</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Passementerie" id="w">passementerie</a>. Their origins lie in the <a href="/wiki/Artistic_Dress_movement" id="w">artistic or aesthetic dress</a> and the adoption of the uncorseted <a href="/wiki/Tea_gown" id="w">tea gown</a> for wear outside the home.</p>
<a id="Sportswear_and_tailored_fashions" name="Sportswear_and_tailored_fashions"></a><h2>Sportswear and tailored fashions</h2>
<p>Unfussy, <a href="/wiki/Tailor" id="w">tailored</a> clothes were worn for outdoor activities and traveling.  The <a href="/wiki/Shirtwaist" id="w">shirtwaist</a>, a costume with a <a href="/wiki/Bodice" id="w">bodice</a> or <i>waist</i> tailored like a man&#39;s shirt with a high collar, was adopted for informal daywear and became the uniform of working women.  Wool or tweed <a href="/wiki/Suit_(clothes)" id="w">suits</a> called <a href="/wiki/Tailor" id="w">tailor-mades</a> or (in French) <i>tailleurs</i>  featured ankle-length skirts with matching jackets; ladies of fashion wore them with <a href="/wiki/Fox" id="w">fox</a> <a href="/wiki/Fur" id="w">furs</a> and huge hats.</p>

<dl><dd><i>See also main article</i> <a href="/wiki/History_of_fashion_design#1900s" id="w">History of fashion design (1900s)</a></dd></dl>
<p>This decade marked the full flowering of Parisian <i><a href="/wiki/Haute_couture" id="w">haute couture</a></i> as the arbiter of styles and silhouettes for women of all classes.  Designers sent <a href="/wiki/Fashion_model" id="w">fashion models</a> or <i>mannequins</i> to the <a href="/wiki/Hippodrome_de_Longchamp" id="w">Longchamp races</a> wearing the latest styles.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>, and fashion photographs identified the creators of individual gowns.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  In 1908, a new silhouette emerged from <a href="/wiki/Callot_Soeurs" id="w">Callot Soeurs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Madeleine_Vionnet" id="w">Vionnet</a> at the house of <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Doucet_(fashion_designer)" id="w">Doucet</a>, and most importantly, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Poiret" id="w">Paul Poiret</a><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>.  The styles were variously called <i>Merveilleuse</i>, <i>Diréctoire</i>, and <i>Empire</i> after the fashions of the <a href="/wiki/1795-1820_in_fashion" id="w">turn of the ninteenth century</a>, which they resembled in their narrow skirts and raised waistlines.</p>
<p>The new styles featured form-fitting gowns with high or undefined waists, or ankle-length skirts and long tunic-like jackets, and required a different &#34;straight line&#34; corset. The Paris correspondent for <i><a href="/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)" id="w">Vogue</a></i> described this new look as &#34;straighter and straighter ... less bust, less hips, and more waist...how slim, how graceful, how elegant...!&#34;<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Hairstyles_and_hats" name="Hairstyles_and_hats"></a><h2>Hairstyles and hats</h2>

<p>Huge, broadbrimmed hats were worn in mid-decade, trimmed with masses of feathers and occasionally complete stuffed birds, or decorated with ribbons and artificial flowers.  Masses of wavy hair were fashionable, swept up to the top of the head (over horsehair pads called &#34;rats&#34; if necessary) and gathered into a knot.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Large hats were worn with evening wear.</p>
<p>By the end of the decade, hats had smaller drooping brims that shaded the face and deep crowns, and the overall top-heavy effect remained.</p>

The long, lean, and athletic silhouette of the 1890s persisted.  Hair was generally worn short.  Beards were less pointed than before and moustaches were often curled.</p>
<a id="Coats%2C_waistcoats%2C_and_trousers" name="Coats%2C_waistcoats%2C_and_trousers"></a><h2>Coats, waistcoats, and trousers</h2>
<p>The sack coat or lounge coat continued to replace the <a href="/wiki/Frock_coat" id="w">frock coat</a> for most informal and semi-formal occasions.  Three-piece suits consisting of a sack coat with matching <a href="/wiki/Waistcoat" id="w">waistcoat</a> (U.S. <i>vest</i>) and <a href="/wiki/Trousers" id="w">trousers</a> were worn, as were matching coat and waistcoat with contrasting trousers, or matching coat and trousers with contrasting waistcoat.  Trousers were shorter than before, often had <i>turn-ups</i> or <i>cuffs</i>, and were creased front and back using the new <a href="/wiki/Trouser_press" id="w">trouser press</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Waistcoats fastened high on the chest.  The usual style was single-breasted.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Blazer" id="w">blazer</a>, a navy blue or brightly-colored or striped <a href="/wiki/Flannel" id="w">flannel</a> coat cut like a sack coat with patch pockets and brass buttons, was worn for sports, sailing, and other casual activities.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Norfolk_jacket" id="w">Norfolk jacket</a> remained fashionable for shooting and rugged outdoor pursuits. It was made of sturdy tweed or similar fabric and featured paired box pleats over the chest and back, with a fabric belt.  Worn with matching <a href="/wiki/Breeches" id="w">breeches</a> or (U.S. <a href="/wiki/Knickerbockers_(clothing)" id="w">knickerbockers</a>), it became the <i>Norfolk suit</i>, suitable for bicycling or golf with knee-length stockings and low shoes, or for hunting with sturdy boots or shoes with leather <a href="/wiki/Gaiters" id="w">gaiters</a>.</p>
<p>The cutaway <a href="/wiki/Morning_coat" id="w">morning coat</a> was still worn for formal day occasions in Europe and major cities elsewhere, with striped trousers.  </p>
<p>The most formal <a href="/wiki/Evening_dress" id="w">evening dress</a> remained a dark tail coat and trousers with a dark or light waistcoat.  Evening wear was worn with a white bow tie and a shirt with a winged collar.  The less formal <a href="/wiki/Dinner_jacket" id="w">dinner jacket</a> or <a href="/wiki/Tuxedo_(clothing)" id="w">tuxedo</a>, which featured a shawl collar with silk or satin facings, now generally had a single button. Dinner jackets were appropriate formal wear when &#34;dressing for dinner&#34; at home or at a men&#39;s club.  The dinner jacket was worn with a white shirt and a dark tie.</p>
<p>Knee-length <a href="/wiki/Topcoat" id="w">topcoats</a> and calf-length <a href="/wiki/Overcoat" id="w">overcoats</a> were worn in winter.</p>
<a id="Shirts_and_neckties" name="Shirts_and_neckties"></a><h2>Shirts and neckties</h2>
<p>Formal dress shirt <a href="/wiki/Collar_(clothing)" id="w">collars</a> were turned over or pressed into &#34;wings&#34;.  Collars were overall very tall and stiffened.  Dress shirts had stiff fronts, sometimes decorated with <a href="/wiki/Shirt_stud" id="w">shirt studs</a> and buttoned up the back.  Striped shirts were popular for informal occasions.</p>
<p>The usual <a href="/wiki/Necktie" id="w">necktie</a> was a narrow four-in-hand.  <a href="/wiki/Ascot_tie" id="w">Ascot ties</a> were worn with formal day dress and white <a href="/wiki/Bow_tie" id="w">bow ties</a> with evening dress.</p>
