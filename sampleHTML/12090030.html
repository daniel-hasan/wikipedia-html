<p>The <b>castle of Mirwart</b> is situated in the <a href="/wiki/Luxembourg_(Belgium)" id="w">province of Luxembourg</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Walloon_Region" id="w">Walloon Region</a> in <a href="/wiki/Belgium" id="w">Belgium</a>. It is built on a rock rising above the &#34;Vallée de la l&#39;Homme&#34;. The oldest parts of the castle date back to the 11th-century. It was a stronghold belonging to the <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Lorraine" id="w">duchy of Lorraine</a>. The Lords of <a href="/wiki/Mirwart" id="w">Mirwart</a> had many bloody conflicts with other feudal Lords from the region, such as the Lords of <a href="/wiki/Bouillon" id="w">Bouillon</a> and Orchimont.</p>
<p>The Lords of Mirwart came into conflict with the monks of the powerful Abbey of <a href="/wiki/Saint-Hubert%2C_Belgium" id="w">Saint-Hubert</a>. The latter were supported by the <a href="/wiki/Prince-bishop_of_Li%C3%A8ge" id="w">Prince-bishop of Liège</a> who wanted to extend his power in this region to the disadvantage of the Dukes of Lorraine.</p> 
<p>In 1083 the Abbot of Saint-Hubert commanded the destruction of the fortifications at Mirwart. This act however wasn&#39;t approved by the Prince-Bishop. After he regained control over the <a href="/wiki/Feoff" id="w">feoff</a>, Prince-Bishop Otbert ordered the reconstruction of the fortified castle and entrusted it to Bavon de Waha in 1099.</p>
<p>In 1293, against the wish of the Prince-Bishop, the feoff was acquired by Jean d&#39;Avesnes. This resulted in a conflict between the prince-bishop of Liège and the new vassal who sought for support with the <a href="/wiki/Counts_of_Hainault" id="w">Counts of Hainault</a>, Luxembourg, Namur, Looz and even the Dukes of Brabant. Control of the castle changed regularly and was finally held by Prince-Bishop <a href="/wiki/Adolphe_II_de_la_Marck" id="w">Adolphe II de la Marck</a>.</p>
<p>During the numerous conflicts between Spain, Austria and France in the 17th and 18th centuries the castle was damaged several times. It was only at the beginning of the 18th-century that a long undisturbed period began and that extensive renovations and embellishments could be undertaken. During this process the castle  gradually lost its strongly fortified character. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the 19th century the castle was acquired by Aimé-Gabriel d&#39;Artigues, the founder of the famous &#34;Cristallerie de Vonêche&#34;. Successive proprietors - the families Van der Linden d&#39;Hoogvorst, d&#39;Arrigade and von der Becke - further embellished the castle and turned it into a beautiful country residence. In the middle of the 19th-century the castle was renovated by <a href="/wiki/Alphonse_Balat" id="w">Alphonse Balat</a>, architect to King <a href="/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium" id="w">Leopold II of Belgium</a>. </p>
<p>After World War II the castle was acquired by the province of Luxembourg. The building was renovated but the province failed to find a use for the castle.  As a result, little by little, the castle was neglected and was subsequently looted by burglars who removed valuable furniture and decorative fittings from the interior.</p>
