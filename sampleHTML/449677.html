<p><b>Project Stormfury</b> was an attempt to weaken <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclones" id="w">tropical cyclones</a> by flying aircraft into them and <a href="/wiki/Cloud_seeding" id="w">seeding</a> with <a href="/wiki/Silver_iodide" id="w">silver iodide</a>. The project was run by the United States Government from <a href="/wiki/1962" id="w">1962</a> to <a href="/wiki/1983" id="w">1983</a>.</p>
<p>The hypothesis was that the silver iodide would cause <a href="/wiki/Supercooling" id="w">supercooled</a> <a href="/wiki/Water" id="w">water</a> in the storm to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this hypothesis was incorrect. In reality, it was determined most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)#Eyewall replacement cycle" id="w">structural changes</a> that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury&#39;s successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation.</p>
<p>The last experimental flight was flown in 1971, due to a lack of candidate storms and a changeover in <a href="/wiki/NOAA" id="w">NOAA</a>&#39;s fleet. More than a decade after the last modification experiment, Project Stormfury was officially cancelled. Although a failure in its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes, Project Stormfury was not without merit. The observational data and storm lifecycle research generated by Stormfury helped improve meteorologists&#39; ability to <a href="/wiki/Weather_forecasting" id="w">forecast</a> the movement and intensity of future hurricanes.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The working hypothesis of Project Stormfury</div></div>

Cloud seeding was first attempted by <a href="/wiki/Vincent_Schaefer" id="w">Vincent Schaefer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Irving_Langmuir" id="w">Irving Langmuir</a>. After witnessing the artificial creation of ice crystals, Langmuir became an enthusiastic proponent of <a href="/wiki/Weather_modification" id="w">weather modification</a>.<sup id="_ref-Davies p. 85_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davies p. 85" title="">[1]</a></sup> Schaefer found that when he dumped crushed <a href="/wiki/Dry_ice" id="w">dry ice</a> into a cloud, precipitation in the form of <a href="/wiki/Snow" id="w">snow</a> resulted.<sup id="_ref-Whipple p. 150_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whipple p. 150" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>With regard to hurricanes, it was hypothesized that by seeding the area around the <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)" id="w">eyewall</a> with <a href="/wiki/Silver_iodide" id="w">silver iodide</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latent_heat" id="w">latent heat</a> would be released. This would promote the formation of a new eyewall. As this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall, the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced <a href="/wiki/Pressure_gradient" id="w">pressure gradient</a>.<sup id="_ref-Landsea D9_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Landsea D9" title="">[3]</a></sup> Even a small reduction in the speed of a hurricane&#39;s winds would be beneficial; as the damage potential of a hurricane increased exponentially with its winds,<sup id="_ref-Landsea D5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Landsea D5" title="">[4]</a></sup> a slight lowering of wind velocity would have a large reduction in potential destructiveness.<sup id="_ref-Landsea D5_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Landsea D5" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Due to Langmuir&#39;s efforts, and the research of Schaefer at <a href="/wiki/General_Electric" id="w">General Electric</a>, the concept of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on <a href="/wiki/December_20" id="w">December 20</a>, 1946 by seeding a cloud.<sup id="_ref-Whipple p. 150_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whipple p. 150" title="">[2]</a></sup> This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project Cirrus, the first large study of <a href="/wiki/Cloud_physics" id="w">cloud physics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Weather_modification" id="w">weather modification</a>. Its most important goal was to try and weaken <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">hurricanes</a>.<sup id="_ref-Whipple p. 151_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whipple p. 151" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Project Cirrus was the first attempt to modify a hurricane.

<p>The first seeding experiment since the Cirrus disaster was attempted into <a href="/wiki/1958_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Hurricane Daisy" id="w">Hurricane Daisy</a>.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_16" id="w">September 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1961" id="w">1961</a>, seeding flights were made into <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Esther_(1961)" id="w">Hurricane Esther</a>.

<p>The seedings into Hurricane Esther led to the establishment of Project Stormfury in 1962.

<a id="Project_Stormfury" name="Project_Stormfury"></a><h2>Project Stormfury</h2>
<p>There were several guidelines used in selecting which storms to seed. The hurricane had to have a less than 10 percent chance of approaching inhabited land within a day;<sup id="_ref-Whipple p. 153_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whipple p. 153" title="">[10]</a></sup>  it had to be within range of the seeding aircraft; and it had to be a fairly intense storm with a well-formed <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)" id="w">eye</a>.<sup id="_ref-Davies p. 89_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davies p. 89" title="">[8]</a></sup> The primary effect of these criteria was to make possible seeding targets extremely rare.<sup id="_ref-Whipple p. 154_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whipple p. 154" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>No suitable storms formed in the <a href="/wiki/1962_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1962 season</a>. Next year, Stormfury began by conducting <a href="/wiki/Scientific_experiment" id="w">experiments</a> on <a href="/wiki/Cumulus_cloud" id="w">cumulus clouds</a>. From <a href="/wiki/August_17" id="w">August 17</a> to 20 of that year, experiments were conducted in 11 clouds, of which six were seeded and five were <a href="/wiki/Control" id="w">controls</a>.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_23" id="w">August 23</a> 1963, <a href="/wiki/1963_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Hurricane Beulah" id="w">Hurricane Beulah</a> was the site of the next seeding attempt. It had an indistinct eyewall. In addition, mistakes were made, as the seedings of silver iodide were dropped in the wrong places. As a consequence, nothing happened.<sup id="_ref-Davies p. 90_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davies p. 90" title="">[9]</a></sup> The next day, another attempt was made, and the seeders hit their targets. The eyewall was observed to fall apart and be replaced by another eyewall with a larger radius.<sup id="_ref-Bulletin p. 507_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bulletin p. 507" title="">[12]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Sustained_winds" id="w">sustained winds</a> also fell by twenty percent.<sup id="_ref-Bulletin p. 507_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bulletin p. 507" title="">[12]</a></sup> All in all, the results of the experiments on Beulah were &#34;encouraging but inconclusive.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Davies p. 90 quoted_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davies p. 90 quoted" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the six years after Beulah, no seedings were conducted for several different reasons.

<p>While out to sea in August of the <a href="/wiki/1965_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">1965 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Stormfury meteorologists decided that <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Betsy" id="w">Hurricane Betsy</a> was a good candidate for seeding.<sup id="_ref-Whipple p. 153_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whipple p. 153" title="">[10]</a></sup> However, the storm immediately swung towards land, and on <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a>, the planned flights were cancelled. For some reason, the press was not notified that there were no seedings, and several newspapers reported that it had begun.<sup id="_ref-Whipple p. 153_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whipple p. 153" title="">[10]</a></sup> As Betsy passed close to <a href="/wiki/The_Bahamas" id="w">the Bahamas</a> and smashed into southern <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, the public and <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" id="w">Congress</a> thought that seeding was underway and blamed Stormfury.<sup id="_ref-Whipple p. 153_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whipple p. 153" title="">[10]</a></sup> It took two months for Stormfury officials to convince Congress that Betsy was not seeded, and the project was allowed to continue.<sup id="_ref-Whipple p. 153_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whipple p. 153" title="">[10]</a></sup> A second candidate, <a href="/wiki/1965_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Hurricane Elena" id="w">Hurricane Elena</a> stayed too far out to sea.<sup id="_ref-Bulletin p. 507_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bulletin p. 507" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>There were no more near-seedings until 1969. In the interim, equipment was improved. What once was the primitive method of hand-dumping dry ice was replaced with rocket canisters loaded with silver iodide, and then gun-like devices mounted on the wings of the airplanes that fired silver iodide into the clouds. Observation equipment was improved.<sup id="_ref-Whipple p. 153_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whipple p. 153" title="">[10]</a></sup> Additional reconnaissance data was utilized to modify the working hypothesis. The new theory took cumulus towers outside the <a href="/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)" id="w">eyewall</a> into account. According to the revised theory, by seeding the towers, <a href="/wiki/Latent_heat" id="w">latent heat</a> would be released. This would trigger the start of new convection, which would then cause a new eyewall. Since the new eyewall was outside the original one, the first eyewall would be choked off of energy and fall apart. In addition, since the new eyewall was broader than the old one, the winds would be lower due to a less sharp pressure difference.<sup id="_ref-Whipple p. 153_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Whipple p. 153" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/1969_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Hurricane Debbie" id="w">Hurricane Debbie</a> provided the best opportunity to test the underpinnings of Project Stormfury.

<p>Atlantic hurricanes meeting all of the criteria were extremely rare, which made duplication of the &#34;success&#34; reached with Hurricane Debbie extremely difficult. Meanwhile, developments outside of meteorology hindered the cause of hurricane modification.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, the Navy withdrew from the project.<sup id="_ref-Davies p. 91_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davies p. 91" title="">[17]</a></sup> Stormfury began to refocus its efforts on understanding, rather than modifying, tropical cyclones.<sup id="_ref-Williams_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Williams" title="">[18]</a></sup> At the same time, the Project&#39;s aircraft were nearing the end of their operational lifetimes.

It also underwent changes in the diameter of its eye and developed multiple eyewalls. All this was consistent with the behavior that would have been expected of Allen had it been seeded. Thus, what Stormfury was accomplishing by seeding was also happening on its own.<sup id="_ref-Goldenberg_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Goldenberg" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Other observations in Hurricanes Anita, David, <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Frederic" id="w">Frederic</a>, and Allen<sup id="_ref-Bulletin p. 509_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bulletin p. 509" title="">[26]</a></sup> also discovered that tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water and a great deal of ice crystals.<sup id="_ref-HRD_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HRD" title="">[27]</a></sup> The reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the <a href="/wiki/Updraft" id="w">updrafts</a> within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing.<sup id="_ref-Landsea C4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Landsea C4" title="">[28]</a></sup> As cloud seeding needed supercooled water to function, the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding would have no effect.</p>
<p>Those observations called the basis for Project Stormfury into question. In the middle of 1983, Stormfury was finally cancelled after the hypothesis guiding its efforts was debunked.<sup id="_ref-Bulletin p. 513_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bulletin p. 513" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>In the sense of weakening hurricanes to reduce their destructiveness, Project Stormfury was a complete failure because it did not distinguish between natural phenomena in tropical cyclones and the impact of human intervention.<sup id="_ref-HRD_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HRD" title="">[27]</a></sup> Millions of dollars had been spent trying to do the impossible. In the end, &#34;[Project] STORMFURY had two fatal flaws: it was neither microphysically nor statistically feasible.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Bulletin p. 513_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bulletin p. 513" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition, Stormfury had been a primary generator of funding for the Hurricane Research Division. While the project was operational, the HRD&#39;s budget had been around $4 million (1975 <a href="/wiki/United_States_Dollar" id="w">USD</a>), with a staff of approximately 100 people.<sup id="_ref-Davies p. 92_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davies p. 92" title="">[30]</a></sup> Today, the HRD employs 30 people and has a budget of roughly $2.6 million each year.<sup id="_ref-Davies p. 93_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davies p. 93" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, Project Stormfury had positive results as well. Knowledge gained during flights proved invaluable in debunking its hypotheses.<sup id="_ref-Davies p. 93_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davies p. 93" title="">[31]</a></sup> Other science resulted in a greater understanding of tropical cyclones. In addition, the Lockheed P-3&#39;s were perfectly suitable for gathering data on tropical cyclones, allowing improved forecasting of these monstrous storms.<sup id="_ref-Davies p. 93_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Davies p. 93" title="">[31]</a></sup> Those planes are still used by the NOAA today.<sup id="_ref-Swanson and Williams_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Swanson and Williams" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
