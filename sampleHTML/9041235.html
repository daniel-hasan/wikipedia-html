<p>The <b>Hamlet chicken processing plant fire</b> was an <a href="/wiki/Industrial_disaster" id="w">industrial disaster</a> that took place at the Imperial Foods chicken processing plant in <a href="/wiki/Hamlet%2C_North_Carolina" id="w">Hamlet</a>, <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" id="w">North Carolina</a>,  <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">USA</a> on <a href="/wiki/September_3" id="w">September 3</a> <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a>, after a failure in a faulty modification to a <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic_line" id="w">hydraulic line</a>. Twenty-five people were killed and 54 injured in the <a href="/wiki/Fire" id="w">fire</a> as they were trapped behind locked fire doors. Due to a lack of inspectors, the plant had never received a <a href="/wiki/Safety_inspection" id="w">safety inspection</a> in 11 years of operation,<sup id="_ref-emergency.com_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emergency.com" title="">[1]</a></sup> and it is thought that a single inspection would have easily prevented the incident.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>A full <a href="/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" id="w">federal</a> investigation was launched, which resulted in the owner receiving a 20-year <a href="/wiki/Prison" id="w">prison</a> <a href="/wiki/Sentence_(law)" id="w">sentence</a>, and the company received the highest <a href="/wiki/Fine" id="w">fines</a> ever handed out in the history of North Carolina.<sup id="_ref-fedlock_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fedlock" title="">[3]</a></sup> The investigation also highlighted failings in the authoritative enforcement of existing <a href="/wiki/Safety_regulations" id="w">safety regulations</a>, and resulted in a number of worker safety laws being passed. Accusations of <a href="/wiki/Racism" id="w">racism</a> were leveled at both the fire service and the city of Hamlet in the aftermath of the fire. The latter dispute, concerning a memorial service organized by the city, resulted in two separate, near-identical monuments being erected. The plant was never reopened.</p>
<p>The fire was North Carolina&#39;s worst industrial disaster,<sup id="_ref-UnitVII_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UnitVII" title="">[4]</a></sup> and the third worst American industrial disaster, exceeded only by the 1947 <a href="/wiki/Texas_City_disaster" id="w">Texas City disaster</a> and the 1911 <a href="/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire" id="w">Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire</a>.<sup id="_ref-lessons_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lessons" title="">[5]</a></sup> (Mining disasters are in a separate category.

<p>The Imperial Foods building was 11 years old, although the basic structure dated back to the early 1900s.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup> The building had been used for various food processing applications and was previously an <a href="/wiki/Ice_cream" id="w">ice cream</a> factory.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup> At the time of the fire it had grown to include a series of adjoining structures totaling {{convert}}.<sup id="_ref-UnitVII_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UnitVII" title="">[4]</a></sup> The factory was constructed with bricks and metalwork and was one story high.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup> The interior was a &#34;maze of large rooms separated by moveable walls&#34;,<sup id="_ref-UnitVII_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UnitVII" title="">[4]</a></sup> and both workers and the product moved around the interior from process to process, going from front to rear.<sup id="_ref-UnitVII_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UnitVII" title="">[4]</a></sup> Imperial&#39;s owners usually kept the doors of the chicken plant padlocked and the windows boarded.<sup id="_ref-Organica_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Organica" title="">[6]</a></sup> This was done to prevent people from stealing chickens, vandalizing the premises or committing other petty criminal acts. There had been no safety inspections by the state due to a lack of inspectors.<sup id="_ref-emergency.com_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emergency.com" title="">[1]</a></sup> The poultry inspector had visited the site daily and was aware of the various fire violations; one worker has stated that much of the chicken meat was rotten,<sup id="_ref-Organica_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Organica" title="">[6]</a></sup> and that the reason it was processed into <a href="/wiki/Chicken_nuggets" id="w">chicken nuggets</a> was to disguise the foul taste.

<p>The company always had a poor safety record although it had had no previous fatal accidents. It was cited in the 1980s for safety violations at its <a href="/wiki/Moosic%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Moosic, Pennsylvania</a> plant. The violations included poorly marked or blocked emergency exits.<sup id="_ref-safety record_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-safety record" title="">[7]</a></sup> The offending factory had been closed by the time of the North Carolina fire.</p>
<p>The Hamlet plant had had three previous non-fatal fires but no action was taken to prevent recurrence or to unlock the doors.<sup id="_ref-Organica_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Organica" title="">[6]</a></sup> The plant had been hit by fires before Imperial took over as well, although these, too, were non-fatal.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Imperial plant at <a href="/wiki/Cumming%2C_Georgia" id="w">Cumming, Georgia</a> had had two major fires, one of which, in 1989, caused $1.2 million worth of damage.<sup id="_ref-safety record_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-safety record" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The constant contact with chicken carcasses led to many workers contracting <a href="/wiki/Psittacosis" id="w">psittacosis</a>, a potentially fatal type of <a href="/wiki/Zoonotic" id="w">zoonotic</a> <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" id="w">pneumonia</a>, spread to humans by infected <a href="/wiki/Poultry" id="w">poultry</a>.<sup id="_ref-WisCOSH_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WisCOSH" title="">[8]</a></sup> There was also a high rate of repetitive motion injuries and an average of 23 percent of workers fell seriously ill or were seriously injured every year.<sup id="_ref-WisCOSH_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WisCOSH" title="">[8]</a></sup> It had no <a href="/wiki/Fire_alarm" id="w">fire alarm</a> system to warn workers further back in the plant, and there were no sprinklers anywhere in the building.<sup id="_ref-Organica_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Organica" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-no fire alarm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-no fire alarm" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>An extensive fire was considered unlikely because there was a general lack of flammable materials throughout the complex, other than some packing materials towards the rear.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup> As a result there were open spaces between rooms in place of doors to allow for easy access by <a href="/wiki/Forklift_truck" id="w">forklift trucks</a>. The only barrier to any of these was curtains of plastic strips between some to hold in refrigerated air.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup> This allowed for rapid spread of smoke and heat in the deadly blaze. Also, the building&#39;s previous use as an ice cream production facility meant that the walls and floor were hard, smooth surfaces, which would severely limit the amount of material that was available to absorb heat and smoke during the fire.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

There were 90 employees in the facility at the time of the fire, which began when a 25 <a href="/wiki/Foot_(unit_of_length)" id="w">foot</a> (7.6 metre) long <a href="/wiki/Deep_fryer" id="w">deep fat fryer</a> <a href="/wiki/Storage_tank" id="w">vat</a> apparently <a href="/wiki/Spontaneous_combustion" id="w">spontaneously ignited</a> at around 8:30 AM.<sup id="_ref-emergency.com_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emergency.com" title="">[1]</a></sup> This cooker&#39;s temperature was controlled by thermostat and was maintained at a constant 375 °F (190 °C), which was variable by design to 15 °F (8.3 °C) either way.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup> The fire spread rapidly, sending workers into a panic so that some suffered trauma injuries during their rush to escape.<sup id="_ref-emergency.com_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emergency.com" title="">[1]</a></sup> Large quantities of smoke were produced by a combination of burning <a href="/wiki/Soybean_oil" id="w">soybean oil</a> and chicken, and melting roof insulation. The smoke was later found to be <a href="/wiki/Hydrocarbon" id="w">hydrocarbon</a>-charged and therefore had the potential to disable someone within a few breaths.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup> Several gas lines embedded in the ceiling also caught fire and exploded.<sup id="_ref-fedlock_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fedlock" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Most of those who escaped who were unharmed worked in the front of the building and got out through the unlocked main entrance, but most workers were trapped by a curtain of smoke.<sup id="_ref-UnitVII_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UnitVII" title="">[4]</a></sup> Others tried to escape through the locked doors by kicking them down, but without success; most of the survivors from the rear of the building got out via a loading bay. The bay was originally blocked by a <a href="/wiki/Tractor-trailer_truck" id="w">tractor-trailer</a>, but three workers went into the rear of the truck and pounded on the walls until they were heard by rescuers who moved the vehicle.<sup id="_ref-UnitVII_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UnitVII" title="">[4]</a></sup> Others escaped when several workers managed to break open a few of the doors, though for many this came too late.<sup id="_ref-fedlock_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fedlock" title="">[3]</a></sup> <div style="wigth:300px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:300px-Imperial_foods_-_cooker_2.jpg" title="The same cooker viewed from further back to give a better view of the general area.

<a id="Emergency_response" name="Emergency_response"></a><h3>Emergency response</h3>
<p>Emergency response was delayed because telephones inside the building could not be used. The plant owner&#39;s son drove to the fire station and informed them there that the factory was on fire but neglected to say that workers were still in the plant.<sup id="_ref-fedlock_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fedlock" title="">[3]</a></sup> More than 100 medical and emergency service personnel attended the scene,<sup id="_ref-emergency.com_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emergency.com" title="">[1]</a></sup> some of whom ran from a local hospital, and nearby towns provided emergency evacuation for the injured via four <a href="/wiki/Air_ambulance" id="w">air ambulances</a> from the local hospital to nearby burns units.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The response later came under heavy criticism. <a href="/wiki/Fire_Chief" id="w">Fire Chief</a> Fuller, who was in charge of the emergency response, refused help several times from the Dobbins Heights fire department, just five minutes distant. The Dobbins Heights Fire Department was composed of <a href="/wiki/African-American" id="w">African-American</a> <a href="/wiki/Volunteer_fire_department" id="w">volunteers</a> and most of the workers were also black, and there were allegations of racial prejudice from the Fire Chief.<sup id="_ref-Organica_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Organica" title="">[6]</a></sup> However, Fuller has defended his decision, saying at the time he refused assistance he did not realize the doors were locked, adding &#34;In a fire like this you need good, seasoned people.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Organica_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Organica" title="">[6]</a></sup> Witnesses have also said that there were only two oxygen tanks on site to help smoke-inhalation victims.<sup id="_ref-Organica_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Organica" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fuller was asked to evaluate the emergency response for investigators.

It was immediately clear that the workers had been trapped by locked fire doors, which drew much criticism. A spokesman for the company admitted that &#34;certain doors&#34; in the plant were locked at &#34;certain times&#34; but refused to say which doors.<sup id="_ref-emergency.com_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emergency.com" title="">[1]</a></sup> Clark Staten of the Emergency Response and Research Institute in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a> said in response to the blaze: &#34;If the initial reports can be believed, this is an intolerable set of circumstances that should result in criminal charges being placed against those responsible for having the fire doors locked... Our past experience with fires and fire deaths shows that we must ensure an adequate number of open exits from any occupied building... It&#39;s hard to believe, in today&#39;s day and age that any business owner or manager would be so insensitive to fire safety as to allow this sort of incident to happen.&#34;<sup id="_ref-emergency.com_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emergency.com" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Imperial processing facility in Cumming, Georgia was shut down for 24 hours immediately after the fire when a resulting inspection by the <a href="/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration" id="w">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> found an inoperative sprinkler system, &#34;improper&#34; fire exits and no evacuation plan.<sup id="_ref-safety record_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-safety record" title="">[7]</a></sup> Imperial Foods were told that the plant posed an &#34;imminent danger&#34; to workers because it lacked an automatic fire extinguisher over the cooker similar to the one installed in the Hamlet plant, which failed to prevent the disaster, but did slow the ignition of oil in the vat.<sup id="_ref-imminent danger_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-imminent danger" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-officialreport_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

An investigation was immediately launched by state authorities who were joined one month later by federal colleagues.<sup id="_ref-fed. investigators_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fed. investigators" title="">[12]</a></sup> Investigators found indentations left on at least one door by people attempting to kick it down.<sup id="_ref-emergency.com_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emergency.com" title="">[1]</a></sup> There were concentrations of bodies around <a href="/wiki/Fire_exits" id="w">fire exits</a><sup id="_ref-emergency.com_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-emergency.com" title="">[1]</a></sup> and inside a large walk-in freezer where panicked workers had sought shelter. Some sources say they instead quickly froze to death, in temperatures as low as -28 °F (-33&#160;°C),<sup id="_ref-UnitVII_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UnitVII" title="">[4]</a></sup> but the official report states they were killed by smoke infiltration around the improperly closed door.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup> Twelve deaths occurred in this area, though five people survived in the freezer, albeit with injuries.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-WisCOSH_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WisCOSH" title="">[8]</a></sup> Timothy Bradly, North Carolina&#39;s Deputy Commissioner of Insurance, said that technically &#34;There was not a single door in the plant that met the criteria of a fire exit.&#34;<sup id="_ref-WisCOSH_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WisCOSH" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The fire was caused by failure of a <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic" id="w">hydraulic</a> line which powered a <a href="/wiki/Conveyor_belt" id="w">conveyor belt</a> supplying the cooker vat. When the original line developed a leak a worker originally replaced it with new line and with new connections. Later the line, which was too long and created a tripping hazard, was shortened, but in the process the worker replaced the new end connector with the old fitting. </p>
<p>The line was rated to 3,000 <a href="/wiki/Pound-force_per_square_inch" id="w">psi</a> (20,700&#160;<a href="/wiki/Pascal_(unit)" id="w">kPa</a>), while normal operating pressure never fluctuated higher than 1,500 psi (10,300&#160;kPa). However, when the line with a customized connector was brought up to normal operating pressure, it separated from the connector at between 800 and 1,500 psi (5,500&#8211;10,300&#160;kPa). <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic_fluid" id="w">Hydraulic fluid</a> spattered onto the heating plumbs for the cooker and immediately vaporized. This vapor then went directly into the flame of the gas-fired cooker. The vapor had a relatively low <a href="/wiki/Flashpoint" id="w">flashpoint</a> and erupted into a fireball. The ruptured hydraulic line went on to pump a total of 50 to 55 <a href="/wiki/U.S._customary_units#Liquid volume" id="w">US gallons</a> (41&#8211;46&#160;<a href="/wiki/Imperial_unit#Measures_of_volume" id="w">imp.&#160;gal</a>/189&#8211;208&#160;<a href="/wiki/Liter" id="w">L</a>) of hydraulic fluid into the fire before electrical failure shut it down.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>A state-of-the-art automatic <a href="/wiki/Carbon_dioxide" id="w">carbon dioxide</a> <a href="/wiki/Fire_extinguisher" id="w">fire extinguisher</a> designed to cope with such fires had been installed over the vat after a non-fatal fire in 1983 at the fire department&#39;s request. This prevented the oil itself from igniting until the later stages of the fire.<sup id="_ref-UnitVII_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-UnitVII" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-WisCOSH_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WisCOSH" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-officialreport_r" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some blame was also laid upon state authorities. The state labor secretary at the time, John Brooks, blamed his department&#39;s failure to inspect the plant on shortage of money and staff, but also blamed the federal government for not enforcing stricter standards.<sup id="_ref-blame on authorities_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blame on authorities" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Recommendations" name="Recommendations"></a><h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>The final report made ten recommendations. A summary of each point is included below.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_s" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li>Life safety codes must be enforced. Proper enforcement of existing regulations must occur in future.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Cooking areas must be separately partitioned from other employee work areas. Cooking operations in food processing plants carry a high risk of fire, and so must be separated from the rest of the building, and from as many workers as possible.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Building exits in wet-type operations should have double emergency lighting, one positioned above the door and one low to the floor. Because the work areas were cooled to comply with food preservation laws, humidity was high, so-called &#34;wet conditions&#34;. These conditions cause particularly heavy smoke, obscuring much high-level emergency lighting.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>High-pressure equipment maintenance and repairs must be limited to factory-trained personnel and specifications. Maintenance personnel working on high-pressure machinery, such as the maintenance employee who conducted the faulty modification to the hydraulic hose in the plant, must be trained by personnel from the factory that supplied the equipment.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>High-pressure equipment in probable incident areas should have built-in catastrophic shutdown valves. This would reduce the probability of accidents in high-risk areas by shutting down machinery should a fault occur.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Negative_pressure" id="w">Negative air flow</a> systems in these facilities could enhance safety by being modified to also accomplish smoke evacuation. Many similar plants have this equipment, which is designed to quickly purge the air of toxic fumes in the event of accidental release of <a href="/wiki/Ammonia" id="w">ammonia</a>. The report recommends modifying the equipment to also pull heavy smoke away from lower areas.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>State and federal inspectors from various departments should be cross-trained. Had the food inspector reported the problems he saw, the disaster may have been prevented despite the lack of other safety inspections. Such personnel should be trained to recognise major problems and to report them to the relevant authorities.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Establish a “worry free” line of communications for industry employees. Workers inside the Hamlet plant were afraid to say anything about safety conditions for fear of being fired. To overcome such problems, states should establish systems of anonymous reporting of problems by workers.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>The number of OSHA safety inspectors must be increased. The team of inspectors was hugely overburdened at the time of the accident, and the report says that the number of inspectors requires increasing to solve the problem.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Emergency exit drills must be incorporated into industry policies. This would allow quick evacuation of premises like the Hamlet chicken plant.</li></ul>

<p>Emmett J. Roe, owner of Imperial Foods Products Inc.; his son Brad, who was operations manager for the company; and plant manager James N.

<p>After the fire the factory was permanently closed, with the loss of 215 jobs.<sup id="_ref-VA-Pilot_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VA-Pilot" title="">[15]</a></sup> Within two years of the accident <a href="/wiki/Insurance_company" id="w">insurance companies</a> and the North Carolina business lobby collaboratively introduced legislation to severely limit the compensation available to injured workers and relatives of killed workers.<sup id="_ref-Organica_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Organica" title="">[6]</a></sup> Insurance companies had originally agreed to pay $16.1 million to the injured and the families of the deceased.<sup id="_ref-$16.1 million_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-$16.1 million" title="">[18]</a></sup> Some of the workers became activists as a result, to fight what they see as &#34;bureaucratic injustice&#34;. They had originally hired <a href="/wiki/John_Coale" id="w">John Coale</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Attorney" id="w">attorney</a> who had worked on the <a href="/wiki/Bhopal_disaster" id="w">Bhopal disaster</a>, but he could not legally practice in North Carolina.<sup id="_ref-Organica_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Organica" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Two separate monuments were erected due to a dispute.

But Mayor Abbie Covington did not want him involved and was backed up by many other local authority figures.<sup id="_ref-fedlock_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fedlock" title="">[3]</a></sup> The result was that a group of the survivors held their own service which included Jackson. Both services unveiled near-identical monuments, which are situated just 50 yards (46&#160;<a href="/wiki/Metre" id="w">m</a>) from each other.<sup id="_ref-fedlock_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fedlock" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because of the town&#39;s small size, many firefighters knew some or all of the victims, and have suffered psychological problems. Fifty to sixty of them attended counseling sessions afterward.<sup id="_ref-officialreport_t" class="reference"><a href="#_note-officialreport" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>A memorial service was held in 2000, though by then many survivors had died, mostly due to complications from their injuries.<sup id="_ref-fedlock_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fedlock" title="">[3]</a></sup> The burned-out shell of the factory was bulldozed by the state in 2001 after it was declared &#34;a public health nuisance&#34; due to the <a href="/wiki/Psychology" id="w">psychological</a> effects it had on the victims, many of whom still lived within sight of the structure.<sup id="_ref-fedlock_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fedlock" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
