<p>A similar barrier, the <a href="/wiki/Israeli_Gaza_Strip_barrier" id="w">Israeli Gaza Strip barrier</a>, was constructed in 1994 largely on the 1949 armistice line between Israel and the Gaza Strip, and has been much less controversial.</p>

<a id="Names_of_the_barrier" name="Names_of_the_barrier"></a><h2> Names of the barrier </h2>
<p>The naming of the barrier is controversial. Israelis most commonly refer to the barrier as the &#34;separation <i>(hafrada)</i> fence&#34; ({{Audio}}, <i>gader ha&#39;hafrada</i> or <i>geder ha&#39;hafrada</i>) and &#34;security fence&#34; or &#34;anti-terrorist fence&#34;, with &#34;<a href="/wiki/Seam_zone" id="w">seam zone</a>&#34; referring to the land between the fence and the 1949 armistice lines.</p>
<p>Palestinians most commonly refer to the barrier in <a href="/wiki/Arabic_language" id="w">Arabic</a> as {{Audio}}, (racial segregation wall), and  some opponents of the barrier refer to it in English as the &#34;Apartheid Wall&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Al-J Wall_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Al-J Wall" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The International Court of Justice, in its advisory opinion on the barrier, wrote it had chosen to use the term “wall” as “the other expressions sometimes employed are no more accurate if understood in the physical sense.”<sup id="_ref-ICI-Advise_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ICI-Advise" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a>&#39;s style guide for journalists states &#34;The BBC uses the terms &#34;barrier&#34;, &#34;separation barrier&#34; or &#34;West Bank barrier&#34; as acceptable generic descriptions to avoid the political connotations of &#34;security fence&#34; (preferred by the Israeli government) or &#34;apartheid wall&#34; (preferred by the Palestinians).&#34;<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sometimes various other names including separation/security and fence/wall/barrier are used.{{Fact}}</p>
<a id="History_and_stated_purpose" name="History_and_stated_purpose"></a><h2> History and stated purpose </h2>
<p>The idea of creating a physical barrier between the Israeli and Palestinian populations was first proposed by <a href="/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin" id="w">Yitzhak Rabin</a> in 1992, following the murder of an Israeli teenage girl in Jerusalem. Rabin said that Israel must &#34;take <a href="/wiki/Gaza" id="w">Gaza</a> out of <a href="/wiki/Tel_Aviv" id="w">Tel Aviv</a>&#34;, in order to minimize friction between the peoples.<sup id="_ref-Makovsky_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Makovsky" title="">[14]</a></sup> Following an outbreak of violent incidents in Gaza in October 1994, Rabin announced his stance that &#34;we have to decide on separation as a philosophy. There has to be a clear border. Without demarcating the lines, whoever wants to swallow 1.8 million Arabs will just bring greater support for <a href="/wiki/Hamas" id="w">Hamas</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Makovsky_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Makovsky" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>To this end, the government of Yitzhak Rabin built the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier in 1994. Following an attack on <a href="/wiki/HaSharon_Junction" id="w">HaSharon Junction</a>, near the city of <a href="/wiki/Netanya" id="w">Netanya</a>, Rabin made his goals more specific:</p>
<p /><blockquote>This path must lead to a separation, though not according to the borders prior to 1967. We want to reach a separation between us and them. We do not want a majority of the Jewish residents of the state of Israel, 98% of whom live within the borders of sovereign Israel, including a united Jerusalem, to be subject to terrorism.</blockquote>

<p>In early 1995, the Shahal commission was established by Yitzhak Rabin to discuss how to implement a barrier separating Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Ehud_Barak" id="w">Ehud Barak</a>, prior to the <a href="/wiki/Camp_David_2000_Summit" id="w">Camp David 2000 Summit</a> with <a href="/wiki/Yasser_Arafat" id="w">Yasser Arafat</a>, vowed to build a separation barrier, stating that it is &#34;essential to the Palestinian nation in order to foster its national identity and independence without being dependent on the State of Israel&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Makovsky_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Makovsky" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Israeli Supreme Court made reference to the conditions and history that led to the building of the barrier. In the September 2005 decision,<sup id="_ref-HCF_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HCF" title="">[1]</a></sup> it described the history of violence against Israeli citizens since the breakout of <a href="/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Intifada" id="w">al-Aqsa Intifada</a> and the loss of life that ensued on the Israeli side. The court ruling also cited the attempts Israel had made to defend its citizens, including &#34;military operations&#34; carried out against &#34;terrorist acts&#34;, and stated that these actions...
</p><blockquote>
<p>...did not provide a sufficient answer to the immediate need to stop the severe acts of terrorism. . . . Despite all these measures, the terror did not come to an end. The attacks did not cease. Innocent people paid with both life and limb. This is the background behind the decision to construct the separation fence (Id., at p. 815)</p></blockquote>

<a id="Grassroots_effort" name="Grassroots_effort"></a><h4> Grassroots effort </h4>
<p>In June 2001 a <a href="/wiki/Grassroots_democracy" id="w">grass roots organization</a> called &#34;<a href="/wiki/Fence_for_Life" id="w">Fence for Life</a> - The Public Movement for The Security Fence&#34; began the grassroots effort for the construction of a continuous security fence. The movement was founded by people from all over Israel following the <a href="/wiki/Dolphinarium_massacre" id="w">Dolphinarium massacre</a>. </p>
<p>The goal of the Movement, is to encourage the government to construct a Security Fence along Israel&#39;s borders. &#34;Fence for Life&#34; urged the government to build a continuous Fence as speedily as possible, and without any connection to the political future of the areas it separates, with a goal of hermetically sealing off the Palestinian territories from Israeli population centers to prevent the terrorist acts by Palestinians against the people living in Israel. </p>
<p>From the very beginning of its public campaign , &#34;Fence for Life&#34; emphasized that any Security Fence has no connection whatsoever to the political future of the settlements. The Movement for the Security Fence for Israel included protests, demonstrations, conferences with public figures, media blitzes, lobbying in the Knesset as well as legal battles in the High Court of Justice, both with demands to quickly build the Security Fence as well as appeals not to cause further delay in construction. The Movement does not support any specific path for the Barrier, as this is subject to a government decision. &#34;Fence for Life&#34; was of the opinion that “politicization” of the Fence by various groups was delaying the completion of the Security Barrier and is likely to block its construction. At the end of 2002, due to government inaction, several localities who suffered the most from lack of a border barrier had started to build the barrier using their own funds directly on the green-line.<sup id="_ref-Gilboa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gilboa" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Government_action" name="Government_action"></a><h4> Government action </h4>
<p>Although the government of Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Ariel_Sharon" id="w">Ariel Sharon</a> was initially hesitant to construct the barrier, he finally embraced the plan. The stated purpose of the barrier is to prevent <a href="/wiki/Terrorism" id="w">terrorists</a> from entering Israeli cities, a problem which has plagued Israel since the start of the <a href="/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Intifada" id="w">Second Intifada</a>. A secondary purpose of the barrier is to prevent illegal infiltrations by Palestinians, mainly illegal immigrants and car thieves. The Israeli government says that the high concrete portions are to protect cars and people on the Israeli side from gunfire. Many Israelis note the danger of terrorist incursions from the area, such as waves of <a href="/wiki/Suicide_attack" id="w">suicide bombings</a> in early 2002.
{{seealso}}</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Natan_Sharansky" id="w">Natan Sharansky</a>, Minister of Housing and Construction at the time:
</p><blockquote>When Israel&#39;s free society was defending itself against an unprecedented campaign of terror, most of the international community was calling for an end of the &#34;cycle of violence&#34; and a return to the negotiating table. When the Palestinian terrorists struck... Israel was condemned for imposing &#34;collective punishment&#34; on the Palestinian population. When Israel chose to target individual terrorists with precision air strikes, its actions were condemned as illegal extrajudicial assassinations. It seemed that in eyes of many, the Jews had a right to defend themselves in theory but could not exercise that right in practice... our government understood that there were three options to maintain an acceptable level of security for our citizens. The first was to wage a total war against Palestinian terror using weapons that would claim many innocent Palestinian lives. The second was to keep our reserves constantly mobilized to defend the country. The third option was to build the security fence. Had the Palestinian Authority become a partner in fighting terror, as it was obliged to do under all the <a href="/wiki/Oslo_Accords" id="w">agreements that it signed</a>, none of these options would have become necessary.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></blockquote>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Israeli West Bank Barrier - North of <a href="/wiki/Meitar" id="w">Meitar</a>, near the south west corner of the West Bank.</div>
As of November 2003, the barrier extends inside most of the northwestern and western edges of the West Bank, sometimes close to the Green Line, and sometimes running further east. In some places there are also secondary barriers, creating a number of completely enclosed <a href="/wiki/Enclave" id="w">enclaves</a>. </p>
<p>In February 2004, Israel said it would review the route of the barrier in response to U.S. and Palestinian concerns. In particular, Israeli cabinet members said modifications would be made to reduce the number of checkpoints Palestinians had to cross, and especially to reduce Palestinian hardship in areas such as <a href="/wiki/Qalqilyah" id="w">Qalqilyah</a> where the barrier goes very near, and in some cases nearly encircles, populated areas.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_30" id="w">June 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Israel" id="w">Supreme Court of Israel</a> ruled that a portion of the barrier west of Jerusalem violates the rights of Palestinians, and ordered 30&#160;km of existing and planned barrier to be rerouted. However, it did rule that the barrier is legal in essence and accepted the Israeli government&#39;s claim that it is a security measure. On <a href="/wiki/July_9" id="w">July 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, the <a href="/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice" id="w">International Court of Justice</a> issued an advisory opinion that it is a violation of international law. At the beginning of September 2004, Israel started the southern part of the barrier.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_20" id="w">February 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, the Israeli cabinet approved a new route. The new route is 681 kilometers and would leave approximately seven percent of the West Bank and 10,000 <a href="/wiki/Palestinian" id="w">Palestinians</a> on the Israeli side. (<span class="image"><img alt="Map" rel="nofollow" src="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/maps/fence10.jpg" /></span>) Before that time, the exact route of the barrier had not been finalized, and it had been alleged by opponents that the barrier route would encircle the <a href="/wiki/Samaria" id="w">Samarian highlands</a> of the West Bank, separating them from the <a href="/wiki/Jordan_valley" id="w">Jordan valley</a>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Following a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, the route was again revised by a cabinet decision on <a href="/wiki/April_30" id="w">April 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The route<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> now leaves fewer Palestinians and less West Bank land on the Israeli side of the barrier. In the <a href="/wiki/Ariel_(city)" id="w">Ariel</a> area, the new route corrects an anomaly of the previous route that would have left thousands of Palestinians on the Israeli side. The <a href="/wiki/Alfei_Menashe" id="w">Alfei Menashe</a> settlement bloc was reduced in size, and the new plan leaves three groups of Palestinian houses on the Palestinian side of the fence. The barrier&#39;s route in the Jerusalem area will leave Beit Iksa on the Palestinian side; and Jaba on the Israeli side, but with a crossing to the Palestinian side at Tzurif. Further changes were made to the route around <a href="/wiki/Eshkolot" id="w">Eshkolot</a> and <a href="/wiki/Metzadot_Yehuda" id="w">Metzadot Yehuda</a>, and the route from Metzadot to Har Choled was approved.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Structure" name="Structure"></a><h2> Structure </h2>
<p>Most of the barrier (over 95% of total length) consists of a &#34;multi-layered fence system&#34; <sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> ideally 50&#160;m in width. The IDF&#39;s preferred design has three fences, with pyramid-shaped stacks of barbed wire for the two outer fences and a lighter-weight fence with intrusion detection equipment in the middle. Patrol roads are provided on both sides of the middle fence, an anti-vehicle ditch is located on the West Bank side of the fence, and a smooth dirt strip on the Israeli side for &#34;intrusion tracking&#34;. </p>
<p>Some sections (less than 5% of total length) are constructed as a wall made up of concrete slabs up to 8&#160;m in height and 3&#160;m in width. Occasionally, due to topographic conditions other sections of the barrier will reach up to 100&#160;m in width.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Wall construction (5%) is more common in urban settings, such as areas near Qalqilyah and <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" id="w">Jerusalem</a>, because it is narrower, requires less land, and provides more protection against snipers. In all cases there are regular observation posts, automated sensing devices and other apparatus. Gates at various points are controlled by Israeli soldiers.</p>

<p>Israeli statistics indicate that the barrier has drastically reduced the number of Palestinian infiltrations and suicide bombings and other attacks on civilians in Israel and in Israeli settlements, and Israeli officials assert that completion of the barrier will make it even more effective in stopping these attacks<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> since &#34;An absolute halt in terrorist activities has been noticed in the West Bank areas where the fence has been constructed&#34;.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Israeli officers, including the head of the <a href="/wiki/Shin_Bet" id="w">Shin Bet</a>, quoted in the newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/Maariv" id="w">Maariv</a></i>, have claimed that in the areas where the barrier was complete, the number of hostile infiltrations has decreased to almost zero. Maariv also stated that Palestinian militants, including a senior member of <a href="/wiki/Islamic_Jihad" id="w">Islamic Jihad</a>, had confirmed that the barrier made it much harder to conduct attacks inside Israel. Since the completion of the fence in the area of <a href="/wiki/Tulkarem" id="w">Tulkarem</a> and Qalqilyah in June 2003, there have been no successful attacks from those areas. All attacks were intercepted or the <a href="/wiki/Suicide_bomber" id="w">suicide bombers</a> detonated prematurely.<sup id="_ref-Makovsky_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Makovsky" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>

<p>However, there is debate over how effective the barrier has been in preventing terrorist attacks. A report by the <a href="/wiki/Shin_Beit" id="w">Shin Beit</a>, published in early 2006 notes that terror attacks in 2005 have significantly decreased due to increased pursuing of Palestinian militants by the Israeli army and intelligence organizations, Hamas&#39;s increased political activity, and a truce among Palestinian militant groups in the Palestinian Territories. According to <i><a href="/wiki/Haaretz" id="w">Haaretz</a></i> the report also mentions that &#34;The security fence is no longer mentioned as the major factor in preventing suicide bombings, mainly because the terrorists have found ways to bypass it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Shin Bet Truce_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shin Bet Truce" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>

<p>The barrier has many effects on Palestinians including reduced freedoms, reduction of <a href="/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces_checkpoint" id="w">Israeli checkpoint</a> and closures, loss of land, increased difficulty in accessing medical services in Israel, change in political tactics and strategy, and economic effects.</p>
<a id="Reduced_freedoms" name="Reduced_freedoms"></a><h4> Reduced freedoms </h4>
<p>In a recent report, the <a href="/wiki/UN" id="w">UN</a> stated that: </p><blockquote>...it is difficult to overstate the humanitarian impact of the Barrier. The route inside the West Bank severs communities, people’s access to services, livelihoods and religious and cultural amenities. In addition, plans for the Barrier’s exact route and crossing points through it are often not fully revealed until days before construction commences. This has led to considerable anxiety amongst Palestinians about how their future lives will be impacted...The land between the Barrier and the Green Line constitutes some of the most fertile in the West Bank. It is currently the home for 49,400 West Bank Palestinians living in 38 villages and towns.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>An often-quoted example of the effects of the barrier is the Palestinian town of <a href="/wiki/Qalqilyah" id="w">Qalqilyah</a>, a city of around 45,000, where an 8 meter-high concrete section is built on the <a href="/wiki/Green_Line" id="w">Green Line</a> between the city and the nearby <a href="/wiki/Highway_6_(Israel)" id="w">Trans-Israel Highway</a>. The wall in this section, referred to as an &#34;anti-sniper wall,&#34; has been claimed to prevent gun attacks against Israeli motorists and the Israeli town of <a href="/wiki/Kfar_Saba" id="w">Kfar Saba</a>,<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> The city is accessible through a main road from the east, and an underground tunnel built in September 2004 on the south side connects Qalqilyah with the adjacent village of Habla. Recently, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the government to change the route of the barrier in this area to ease movement of Palestinians between Qalqilyah and 5 surrounding villages. In the same ruling, the court rejected the arguments that the fence must be built only on the Green Line. The ruling cited the topography of the terrain, security considerations, and sections 43 and 52 of The Hague Regulations 1907 and Article 53 of the 4th Geneva Convention as reasons for this rejection.<sup id="_ref-HCF_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HCF" title="">[1]</a></sup>

<p>In early October 2003, the IDF OC <a href="/wiki/Israeli_Central_Command" id="w">Central Command</a> declared the area between the separation barrier in the northern section of the West Bank (Stage 1) and the Green Line a closed military area for an indefinite period of time. New directives stated that every Palestinian over the age of twelve living in the enclaves created in the closed area have to obtain a “permanent resident permit” from the Civil Administration to enable them to continue to live in their homes. Other residents of the West Bank have to obtain special permits to enter the area.<sup id="_ref-BTStat_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BTStat" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>In June 2004, the Washington Times<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> reported that the reduced need for Israeli military incursions in Jenin have prompted efforts to rebuild damaged streets and buildings and a gradual return to a semblance of normalcy, and in a letter<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> dated <a href="/wiki/October_25" id="w">October 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, from the Israeli mission to <a href="/wiki/Kofi_Annan" id="w">Kofi Annan</a>, Israel&#39;s government pointed out that a number of restrictions east of the barrier have been lifted as a result of the barrier, including a reduction in checkpoints from 71 to 47 and roadblocks from 197 to 111. <a href="/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post" id="w">The Jerusalem Post</a> reports that, for some Palestinians who are Israeli citizens living in the <a href="/wiki/Israeli_Arab" id="w">Israeli Arab</a> town of <a href="/wiki/Umm_el-Fahm" id="w">Umm el-Fahm</a> (population 42,000) near <a href="/wiki/Jenin" id="w">Jenin</a>, the barrier has &#34;significantly improved their lives&#34; because, on one hand, it prevents would-be thieves or terrorists from coming to their town and, on the other hand, has increased the flow of customers from other parts of Israel who would normally have patronised Palestinian business in the West Bank, resulting in an economic boom. The report states that the downsides are that the barrier has divided families in half and &#34;damaged Israeli Arabs&#39; solidarity with the Palestinians living on the other side of the Green Line&#34;.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>A UN report released in August 2005 observed that the existence of the barrier &#34;replaced the need for closures: movement within the northern West Bank, for example, is less restrictive where the Barrier has been constructed. Physical obstacles have also been removed in Ramallah and Jerusalem governorates where the Barrier is under construction.&#34; The report notes that more freedom of movement in rural areas may ease Palestinian access to hospitals and schools, but also notes that restrictions on movement between urban population centers have not significantly changed.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

<p>As of May 2004, the fence construction had already uprooted an estimated 102,320 Palestinian olive and citrus trees, demolished 75 acres (0.3&#160;km²) of greenhouses and 23&#160;miles (37&#160;km) of irrigation pipes. At that point, it rested on 15,000 dunums (3,705&#160;acres or 15&#160;km²) of confiscated land, only meters away from a number of small villages, or hamlets. In early 2003, in order to move a section of the barrier to the Green Line, a ramshackle mall of 63 shops straddling that line into Israel was demolished by the IDF in the village of <a href="/wiki/Nazlat_Issa" id="w">Nazlat Issa</a> .<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> In August of that year, an additional 115 shops/stalls (an important source of income for several communities) and five to seven homes were also demolished there.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> The Israeli Government has promised that trees affected by the construction will be replanted.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> </p>

In addition to loss of land, in the city of Qalqilyah one-third of the city&#39;s water wells lie on the other side of the barrier.

However, these drops in economic productivity came before the construction of the barrier began. In 2005, the PNA Ministry of Finance cited the 2003 &#34;construction of the separation wall&#34; as one reason for the depressed Palestinian economic activity.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.mof.gov.ps/english/Press_Coverage/press%20release.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.mof.gov.ps/english/Press_Coverage/press%20release.pdf">http://www.mof.gov.ps/english/Press_Coverage/press%20release.pdf</a></p>
<p>According to the Palestinian Negotiations Affairs Department (NAD) and other sources, 45% of Qalqilyah&#39;s farmland<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> now lie outside the barrier, and farmers require permits from Israeli authorities to access their lands that are on the opposite side.

<a id="Opinions_on_the_barrier" name="Opinions_on_the_barrier"></a><h1> Opinions on the barrier</h1>
<a id="Israeli_opinions" name="Israeli_opinions"></a><h2>Israeli opinions</h2>
<p>Israeli public opinion has been very strongly in favor of the barrier, partly in the hope that it will improve security and partly in the belief that the barrier marks the <a href="/wiki/Proposals_for_a_Palestinian_state" id="w">eventual border of a Palestinian state</a>. Due to the latter possibility, the settler movement opposes the barrier, although this opposition has waned since it became clear the barrier would be diverted to the east of major <a href="/wiki/Israeli_settlement" id="w">Israeli settlements</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Ariel_(city)" id="w">Ariel</a>. According to <a href="/wiki/Haaretz" id="w">Haaretz</a>, a survey conducted by of the <a href="/wiki/Tami_Steinmetz_Center_for_Peace_Research" id="w">Tami Steinmetz Center for Peace Research</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tel_Aviv_University" id="w">Tel Aviv University</a>, there is an overwhelming support for the barrier among the Jewish population of Israel: 84% on March 2004 and 78% on June 2004.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>Most Israelis believe the barrier and intensive activity by the <a href="/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces" id="w">Israel Defense Forces</a> to be the main factors in the decrease in successful <a href="/wiki/Suicide_attack" id="w">suicide attack</a> from the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" id="w">West Bank</a>. The proponents of the barrier insist that reversible inconveniences to Palestinians should be balanced with the threats to lives of Israeli civilians and point out that the barrier is a non-violent way to stop terrorism and save innocent lives.</p>
<p>However, there are some Israelis who oppose the barrier. The Israeli <a href="/wiki/Peace_Now" id="w">Peace Now</a> movement has stated that while they would support a barrier that follows the <a href="/wiki/1949_Armistice_Agreements" id="w">1949 Armistice lines</a>, the &#34;current route of the fence is intended to destroy all chances of a future  peace settlement with the Palestinians and to annex as much land as possible  from the West Bank&#34; and that  the barrier would &#34;only increase the blood to be split on both sides and continue the sacrificing  of Israeli and Palestinian lives for the settlements.&#34; <sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>Additionally, many Israelis living in settlements, such as the <a href="/wiki/Gush_Etzion" id="w">Gush Etzion</a> area, oppose the fence because it separates them from the rest of Israel. They argue that building the fence defines a border, and that they are being left out. According to most settlers, all of the West Bank belongs to Israel, and separating any of it with a fence is the first step in giving the land away.<sup id="_ref-Women in Green_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Women in Green" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some Israeli left wing activists, such as <a href="/wiki/Anarchists_Against_the_Wall" id="w">Anarchists Against the Wall</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gush_Shalom" id="w">Gush Shalom</a> are active in protests against the barrier, especially in the West Bank towns of <a href="/wiki/Bil%26%2339%3Bin" id="w">Bil&#39;in</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jayyous" id="w">Jayyous</a>.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Palestinian_opinions" name="Palestinian_opinions"></a><h2>Palestinian opinions</h2>
<p>The Palestinian population and its leadership are essentially unanimous in opposing the barrier. A significant number of Palestinians have been separated from their own farmlands or their places of work or study, and many more will be separated as the barriers near <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" id="w">Jerusalem</a> are completed. Furthermore, because of its planned route as published by the Israeli government, the barrier is perceived as a plan to confine the Palestinian population to specific areas, causing further humiliation.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> They state that Palestinian institutions in <a href="/wiki/Abu_Dis" id="w">Abu Dis</a> will be prevented from providing services to residents in the <a href="/wiki/East_Jerusalem" id="w">East Jerusalem</a> suburbs, and that a 10-minute walk has become a 3-hour drive in order to reach a gate, to go (if allowed) through a crowded military checkpoint, and drive back to the destination on the other side.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>
<p>More broadly, Palestinian spokespersons, supported by many in the Israeli left wing and other organizations, claim that the hardships imposed by the barrier will breed further discontent amongst the affected population and add to the security problem rather than solving it. </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_14" id="w">April 14</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>, American President <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">George W.

The fence/wall is not being built between Israel and the Occupied Territories but mostly (close to 90%) inside the West Bank, turning Palestinian towns and villages into isolated enclaves, cutting off communities and families from each other, separating farmers from their land and Palestinians from their places of work, education and health care facilities and other essential services. This in order to facilitate passage between Israel and more than 50 illegal Israeli settlements located in the West Bank.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_20" id="w">February 20</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a> the <a href="/wiki/World_Council_of_Churches" id="w">World Council of Churches</a> adopted a statement demanding that Israel halt and reverse construction on the barrier and strongly condemning what they believe to be violations of human rights and humanitarian consequences that have resulted due to construction of the barrier. While acknowledging Israel&#39;s serious security concerns and asserting that the construction of the barrier on its own territory would not have been a violation of international law, the statement rejected what it saw as the creation of a new political boundary that confiscates Palestinian land.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Graffiti" id="w">Graffiti</a> on the Palestinian side of walled sections of the barrier has consistently been one of many forms of protest against its existence.
