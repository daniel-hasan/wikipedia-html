<b><i>Ninja Gaiden</i></b> is a console <a href="/wiki/Action-adventure_game" id="w">action-adventure game</a> developed by <a href="/wiki/Team_Ninja" id="w">Team Ninja</a> and published by <a href="/wiki/Tecmo" id="w">Tecmo</a>. It was released in 2004 for the <a href="/wiki/Xbox" id="w">Xbox</a> <a href="/wiki/Video_game_console" id="w">video game console</a>, and starts off a whole new <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> story and universe, different from the older <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System" id="w">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_(NES)" id="w">Ninja Gaiden</a></i> series.  It has received much critical acclaim, with several publications proclaiming it the best as well as one of the most difficult video games ever made, inducting it into their Halls of Fame.</p>
<p><i>Ninja Gaiden</i> marks the first foray into the third-person, <a href="/wiki/3D_computer_graphics" id="w">three-dimensional</a> action-adventure market for the <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> series.  Taking place in Japan and the fictional country of Vigoor, the game follows the <a href="/wiki/Ninja" id="w">ninja</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ryu_Hayabusa" id="w">Ryu Hayabusa</a> as he fights hordes of enemies in a variety of environments to retrieve the stolen Dark Dragon Blade. An online tournament was held for it shortly after its release. The qualifiers played over <a href="/wiki/Xbox_Live" id="w">Xbox Live</a> established record-breaking participation, and culminated in the finalists having their showdown at the <a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Game_Show" id="w">Tokyo Game Show</a> 2004.</p>
<p>The game mechanics of <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> have gradually evolved through downloadable contents and two re-releases, <b><i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i></b> for the Xbox in 2005, and <b><i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i></b> for the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_3" id="w">PlayStation 3</a> in 2007. Its saga will be continued in <i><a href="/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_Dragon_Sword" id="w">Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword</a></i> on the <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_DS" id="w">Nintendo DS</a>, and later on in <i><a href="/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_II_(Xbox_360)" id="w">Ninja Gaiden II</a></i> on the <a href="/wiki/Xbox_360" id="w">Xbox 360</a>.</p>
<a id="Gameplay" name="Gameplay"></a><h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The player controls Ryu Hayabusa, guiding him in a <a href="/wiki/Third-person_shooter" id="w">third person</a> view, fighting foes and exploring the environment of the 3D world. Except for a few situations dictated by the story, Ryu is unrestrained in his exploration, running through the streets, jumping and running up and along walls, and swinging from pole to pole. Although the game world is loaded in stages, the load times are said to be negligible.<sup id="_ref-gwxngrev_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gwxngrev" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Ninja Gaiden&#39;s</i> standard game mode, Story Mode, follows the pacing of the typical <a href="/wiki/Action-adventure_game" id="w">action-adventure game</a>, where the protagonist starts off weak at the beginning of the story and can be built up to have a larger life bar, more powerful weapons and magical ability through items or purchases, by the end of the it. The player&#39;s performance in this mode is based purely on the karma score, with &#34;Master Ninja&#34; as the highest rank, and &#34;Ninja Dog&#34; as the lowest.</p>
<p>Another gaming experience was introduced in <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i> and <i>Sigma</i>, in the form of Mission Mode. The missions are short sessions of pure combat action, and each mission typically comes with its own equipment loadout for the player. The highest scores for each mission are accumulated for the player&#39;s Mission Mode score.</p>
<p>Players can upload their scores to online ranking boards for both modes, and compete with other players to get the best scores. Besides this, the games also promote replayability with the large number of Mission Mode missions, and unlockable costumes and emulated games for completing Story Mode on different difficulties.</p>

 have praised <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> as having one of the deeper combat engines for a Xbox game, the smooth interaction and responsiveness of its controls.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-gwxngrev_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gwxngrev" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Using only the control stick and three buttons, the player is able to make Ryu block, dodge and attack with ease. Ryu&#39;s defence is unbreakable by most attacks, though he can still be grabbed. He can also dodge attacks with a &#39;reverse-wind&#39; (tumble and roll).</p>
<p>Ryu has a multitude of weapons to choose from. With the light swords (Dragon Sword, Kitetsu, etc), he is able to perform quick attacks, the Flying Swallow (high speed leaping slash) - cutting through foes, as well as his signature Izuna Drop (leaping spinning <a href="/wiki/Piledriver_(professional_wrestling)" id="w">piledriver</a>) smashing foes into the ground. Heavy weapons like the Dabilahro, are slow but powerful. Flails and staves let him string together long <a href="/wiki/Combo_(video_games)" id="w">combos</a> of attacks. <a href="/wiki/Shuriken" id="w">Shurikens</a> and arrows make up the rest of his arsenal, allowing him to hurt foes at a distance.</p>
<p>By absorbing essences given off by slain enemies, Ryu can unleash super powerful attacks known as Ultimate Techniques. Each weapon has its own unique Ultimate Technique, and besides dealing out heavy damage to the unfortunate foes caught in them, it also grants Ryu invulnerability during the attack. In the later versions of <i>Ninja Gaiden</i>, these techniques award karma points, making them an integral part of high scoring play.</p>
<p>Lastly, fueled by his ki, Ryu can cast ninpos (magic spells), harming his foes with fireballs, ice storms or bolts of lightning while avoiding damage from their attacks.</p>

<i>Ninja Gaiden<b>s world consists of fictional locations between two countries, <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> and the fictional Vigoor Empire. For the Japanese locations, the ninja fortress and the Hayabusa village are designed in the typical Japanese <a href="/wiki/Japanese_architecture#Heian period" id="w">Heian period</a> architecture, set amongst the mountains.</b></i></p>
<p>The Vigoor Empire is an imaginative environment, consisting of a variety of real world cultural influences. The city of Tairon bears the marks of <a href="/wiki/Islamic_architecture" id="w">Islamic architecture</a> with <a href="/wiki/Arabic_language" id="w">Arabic</a> letterings found on various gates and structures. The monastery bears the looks of <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_architecture" id="w">Byzantine architecture</a> with the large spacious hall, multiple levels of windows and archways.

</p><a id="Characters" name="Characters"></a><h3>Characters</h3>
<p>{{main}}
The protagonist and the only playable character in <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> and <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i> is the super ninja, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Ryu Hayabusa 2" id="w">Ryu Hayabusa</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> A man of few words, he works alone in his quest. He ends up rescuing the fiend hunter, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Supporting characters 2" id="w">Rachel</a> (who is another playable character in <i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i>) quite a number of times over the course of the game.</p>
<p>The bulk of enemies the protagonist faces in the game are Fiends, humans turned into supernatural creatures through cursing of their blood.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Of the three Greater Fiends,<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> only <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Leaders of the Fiends" id="w">Doku</a> plays a major role in the storyline, being the one who starts off Ryu&#39;s quest for vengeance, by killing his village, stealing the Dark Dragon Blade, and having turned <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Leaders of the Fiends" id="w">Alma</a> into a Fiend.</p>
<a id="Story" name="Story"></a><h3>Story</h3>
<p>Taking place two years before the first <i><a href="/wiki/Dead_or_Alive_(arcade_game)" id="w">Dead or Alive</a></i> game, the story starts off with Ryu invading the Shadow clan ninja fortress to pay a visit to his uncle, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Ninjas" id="w">Murai</a> who is the clan&#39;s leader. During the visit, Ryu receives news of the Hayabusa village being raided and rushes back to his village. He encounters Doku who is stealing away the Dark Dragon Blade. Their confrontration results in Ryu getting cut down by Doku. The scene ends with the Hayabusa&#39;s spiritual animal, a <a href="/wiki/Falcon" id="w">falcon</a> watching over Ryu&#39;s fallen body.</p>
<p><div style="wigth:200px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:200px-Kyoiori_RyuVsDoku0000.png" title="Ryu fights with Doku."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200px-Kyoiori_RyuVsDoku0000.png" alt="Ryu fights with Doku." title="Ryu fights with Doku." class="location-left type-thumb" width="200px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Ryu fights with Doku.</div></div>
 information given by Murai, a fully recovered Ryu sets off to Vigoor, seeking vengeance<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> and retrieval of the Blade. Guided by <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Supporting characters 2" id="w">Ayane</a>, Ryu fights through the streets of Tairon, cutting down those who stand in his way. In his adventures, he meets the Fiend Hunter, Rachel and the enigmatic swordsmith, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Supporting characters 2" id="w">Muramasa</a>, both of whom provide him aid.</p>
<p>Ryu kills a lot of fiends, even defeating the Greater Fiend, Alma, and has a final showdown with Doku in a <a href="/wiki/Labyrinth" id="w">labyrinth</a>. Doku&#39;s spirit is defeated and banished, but he casts the blood curse on Ryu with his last breath.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> To overcome this curse and to recover the Dark Dragon Blade, Ryu enters the palace and overcomes the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Leaders of the Fiends" id="w">Holy Vigoor Emperor</a> in the latter&#39;s own realm.</p>
<p>With the Emperor&#39;s hold on his realm gone, it starts to collapse. Ryu loses his grip on the Dark Dragon Blade while escaping. It is picked up by the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Ninjas" id="w">Dark Disciple</a> who was shadowing Ryu throughout his adventure. Unmasking himself to be Murai, the whole ordeal is revealed to be a set up by him to infuse the Blade with the souls harnessed from Ryu&#39;s quest of vengeance, thereby restoring its evil power.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>In this final duel, Murai despite possessing the fully powered evil blade, is of no match to Ryu. The story ends with Ryu shattering the Dark Dragon Blade with the True Dragon Sword. Simply stating &#34;It&#39;s over...&#34;, Ryu turns himself into a falcon and flies back to the Hayabusa village.

</p><a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2>Development</h2>
<p>The &#34;Next-Generation Ninja Gaiden Project&#34; began in 1999; it was originally intended to be a game for the <a href="/wiki/Sega_NAOMI" id="w">Sega NAOMI</a> <a href="/wiki/Arcade_system_board" id="w">arcade system board</a>. The game&#39;s development cycle was plagued by several delays and changes of platform: first to the <a href="/wiki/Dreamcast" id="w">Sega Dreamcast</a>, then as a launch title for the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_2" id="w">PlayStation 2</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> It was a surprise then when <a href="/wiki/Tecmo" id="w">Tecmo</a> announced during <a href="/wiki/E3_Media_and_Business_Summit" id="w">E3</a> 2002 that <b><i>Ninja Gaiden</i></b> would be exclusive to the <a href="/wiki/Xbox" id="w">Xbox</a>,<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> especially when their own online poll showed the <a href="/wiki/GameCube" id="w">GameCube</a> as the fans&#39; overwhelming choice platform for the game.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Game_director" id="w">game director</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tomonobu_Itagaki" id="w">Tomonobu Itagaki</a> had stated his desire for this game to be a violent action game at heart.<sup id="_ref-plot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-plot" title="">[19]</a></sup> He intended for a difficult game which primarily challenges players on their reflexes instead of their memorization of layouts and timings like in the old NES series.<sup id="_ref-ign_inter_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ign_inter" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-teamxbox_int_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-teamxbox_int" title="">[6]</a></sup> Itagaki sought to attract casual and hardcore gamers with a well-made game which integrated high quality smooth flowing graphics, with responsive controls, and immersive gaming experience. As a brand new take on the <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> universe, the game made a few references to the old series like the theme of a pair of good and evil swords, reused attacks from the old games, and new imaginings of old foes.</p>
<p>The release date of the game kept slipping and Tecmo finally announced that it would be released in 2004.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> The demo disc of <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> came with the March 2004 edition of <a href="/wiki/Famitsu" id="w">Famitsu Xbox</a>,<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> on <a href="/wiki/12_February" id="w">12 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>. In the demo, the player is restricted to the ninja fortress in the retail version&#39;s chapter one. However, Ryu starts off with three fully upgraded melee weapons, two types of shurikens, and a bow. He is also equipped with the Art of Inazuma ninpo, which shoots out bolts of lightning. This gives the player a taste of the later features in the retail version. The demo offers only the Normal and Hard difficulty levels to choose from.</p>
<p><i>Ninja Gaiden</i>{{&#39;}}s American retail release was two weeks earlier than its Japanese release,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> and was accompanied by a commercial<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> and the launching of the official website.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Those who had pre-ordered the game on Tecmo&#39;s site could purchase <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> merchandises at a discount.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Despite the retail release, work continued on and downloadable contents in the form of <i>Hurricane Pack</i>s were announced to be available for download via <a href="/wiki/Xbox_Live" id="w">Xbox Live</a> from August 2004.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> The <i>Pack</i>s are part of the qualifying process for the Master Ninja Tournament World Wide Finals.</p>
<p><b><i>Hurricane Pack 1</i></b> was available for download since <a href="/wiki/August_9" id="w">August 9</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>. It reused <i>Ninja Gaiden<b>s Story Mode, but added several new foes like the blue furred humanoid <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Fiends" id="w">Cat Fiends</a>, the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Fiends" id="w">Dino Fiends</a> wearing <i><a href="/wiki/Triceratops" id="w">Triceratops</a></i> skull masks, and upgraded versions of the Vigoor military forces. Modifications were made to the scoring system to reward clearing only encounters for the first time, and for fast kills. The player is now able to manually rotate the camera, and an Intercept technique (similar to <a href="/wiki/Soul_Calibur_II" id="w">Soul Calibur II</a>&#39;s Guard Impact),<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> was introduced.</b></i></p>
<p><b><i>Hurricane Pack 2</i></b> was available for download since <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>. It integrated all the features of <i>Hurricane Pack 1</i>, but changed the story and game world. With the aid of a new weapon, the Lunar, the player has to fight through several rounds of combats to rescue Rachel from the twin Ancient Fiends, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Fiends" id="w">Nicchae</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Fiends" id="w">Ishtaros</a>. Going up through the palace, and into the nether world, the player can only shop and save after certain rounds of combats with old foes and a few new foes, like the slide tackling <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Fiends" id="w">Crow Shadows</a> and the great sword wielding <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Fiends" id="w">Nightmare Fiends</a>.</p>
<p>Tecmo announced in May&#39;s <a href="/wiki/E3_Media_and_Business_Summit" id="w">E3</a> 2005 that <b><i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i></b> for the Xbox would be <a href="/wiki/Team_Ninja" id="w">Team Ninja</a>&#39;s next project.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> The game was shortly listed as playable for the <a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Game_Show" id="w">Tokyo Game Show</a> 2005,<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> and was released on schedule in September 2005 with loads of content for a comparatively low price.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Those who pre-ordered the game received a free exclusive t-shirt as well.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup> Considered to be the complete <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> experience by the designer Tomonobu Itagaki himself,<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i> integrated all of the features in the two <i>Hurricane Packs</i>, along with new features of its own, such as  Mission Mode, and the easy difficulty - Ninja Dog. According to interviews with Itagaki, the Ninja Dog difficulty was added only grudgingly.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> He felt the standard difficulty implemented in the game was reasonable for any casual player if they had persevered through the difficult parts.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> However, due to the strong outcries to the game&#39;s difficulty, he instituted the Ninja Dog mode as a double-edged compromise: it can only be accessed through dying three successive times (similar to the Special Edition of <i><a href="/wiki/Devil_May_Cry_3:_Dante%26%2339%3Bs_Awakening#Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition" id="w">Devil May Cry 3</a></i>) within the first stage, at which point the player is asked, &#34;Do you wish to abandon the way of the ninja?&#34; If the player accepts, the game enters Ninja Dog and continues on under a condescending atmosphere - pink ribbons for accessories, Ayane taking on an attitude to Ryu, etc.</p>
<p>In the September 2006 issue of <a href="/wiki/Famitsu" id="w">Famitsu</a>, Tecmo announced its next project in the <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> series would be <a href="/wiki/Video_game_remake" id="w">remaking</a> <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i> into <b><i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i></b> for the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_3" id="w">PlayStation 3</a>.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> This was officially announced by <a href="/wiki/Sony" id="w">Sony</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Tokyo_Game_Show" id="w">Tokyo Game Show</a> 2006.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Yosuke Hayashi was appointed the <a href="/wiki/Game_director" id="w">game director</a> of this remake, and <a href="/wiki/Eidos_Interactive" id="w">Eidos</a> managed to purchase the publishing rights for Europe and North America. Tomonobu Itagaki while having no direct involvement in the project, had stated <i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i> is only for PlayStation owners who never got the chance to experience what <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> and <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i> had to offer, which is why this version will remain exclusively for the PS3.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/GameStop" id="w">GameStop</a> announced in April 2007 that it would be releasing limited number of copies of <i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma Collectors Edition</i> for the North American market.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> They were sold at ten US dollars more than the standard edition, with the only extra exclusive content being a &#39;behind-the-scenes&#39; DVD of Team Ninja, as the advertised exclusive code was applicable for the standard editions as well. Hopes for a <i>Collectors Edition</i> for Europe were dashed with a followup announcement by Eidos.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> In Japan, the <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>-based singer, <a href="/wiki/Leah_Dizon" id="w">Leah Dizon</a> was contracted to be the <a href="/wiki/Celebrity" id="w">celebrity</a> promoter for the game, starring in and singing the song for its commercial there.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> Her autographed posters were also prizes for the game&#39;s Japanese launch.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> Limited supplies of free t-shirts were given to those who pre-ordered the game for the North American launch.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i>{{&#39;}}s demo was released on <a href="/wiki/April_26" id="w">April 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, over the PlayStation Network. Like the original <i>Ninja Gaiden</i>{{&#39;}}s demo, the player is restricted to chapter one&#39;s game world. However the demo unlocks the next higher difficulty when the player completes it on a lower difficulty. The player can also play as Rachel in a separate mission. The demo exhibited a scoring glitch which resulted in ridiculously high scores on the leaderboards to the dismay of many <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> veterans.

<p>Being rated as a &#39;Mature&#39; video game, <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> can retain its heavy gore content (blood, violence, decapitations, grotesque monsters) without any censorship. However, the ratings systems for certain countries prohibit beheadings from being depicted in them. Several of these decisions were based on public opinion over current events, and as such there are differences in the rulings between versions.</p>
<p>Despite heavy suspicions that the European release of the game would be censored in certain aspects, <a href="/wiki/Microsoft" id="w">Microsoft</a> reassured Europe in March 2004 that the gore would be left intact.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> A month later, however they admitted the European PAL version would exclude decapitation of human foes.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> While the submitted material was uncensored,<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> law forbids games featuring the decapitations portrayed in <i>Ninja Gaiden</i>, to be released to those 18 years old and above. As such, decapitations were removed from the PAL retail versions. However, a year later, <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i> was accredited with the same rating by the <a href="/wiki/Unterhaltungssoftware_Selbstkontrolle" id="w">USK</a>, but the decapitations were left untouched in the <a href="/wiki/PAL_region" id="w">PAL</a> versions.</p>
<p>Since 2006, <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> has become more stringent with <a href="/wiki/Computer_Entertainment_Rating_Organization" id="w">CERO</a>, its violence rating system. Therefore, <i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i> cannot feature human decapitation unless Tecmo is willing to accept a &#39;Z&#39; rating for the game. As it is sold in Japan under the &#39;D&#39; rating, there are no decapitations in the <a href="/wiki/NTSC" id="w">NTSC/J</a> version of <i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i>.

<p>The original purpose of the first <i>Hurricane Pack</i> was for the Master Ninja World Tournament qualification, and the second pack was a separate tournament on its own.

<a id="Versions_and_merchandise" name="Versions_and_merchandise"></a><h2>Versions and merchandise</h2>
<p>Two versions of <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> were produced, <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i> and <i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i>. On the whole, they are all the same games, possessing the same story regarding Ryu and the Dark Dragon Blade. The game engine remained the same, but was tweaked for the later two versions. <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i> is considered to be the final version of <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> with all the features of the latter, and a Mission Mode. In moving the game from the older generation Xbox to the later generation PlayStation 3, the graphics were improved for <i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i>.</p>

<b><i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i></b> is <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> integrated with the contents of the two <i>Hurricane Packs</i>, and a Mission Mode. Tomonobu Itagaki has tweaked it to be more difficult than the original release, especially on the higher difficulties. Several bosses including <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Leaders of the Fiends" id="w">Spirit Doku</a> and the Dark Disciple attack faster and more furiously, plus a variety of dangerous new foes have been added to make life even harder. Furthermore, players who have played <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> will find the Flying Swallow move, which could previously dominate almost any foe thrown against Ryu, has been heavily toned down. On Hard difficulty and above, foes block the Flying Swallow more frequently, forcing players to adapt to a new style of fighting. There are even a couple of new enemies having moves specifically to punish usage of the Flying Swallow against them.</p>

<i>Hurricane Pack 1<b>s design, along with several new in-game cutscenes were effectively integrated into Story Mode, and playable on all difficulty levels, including the new Ninja Dog and Master Ninja difficulty. Encounters were added on higher levels of difficulty to surprise players on their first play, and almost all foes were given grabbing, guard breaking or crushing attacks. This coupled with the increase in the enemies&#39; aggressiveness made the player more wary on their toes, and less likely to &#39;<a href="/wiki/Turtle_(game_term)" id="w">turtle</a>&#39; in <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i>.</b></i></p>
<p>New elements are continually introduced as the player clears the higher difficulties with the aid of the Lunar and Smoke Bombs (a new projectile which aids in distracting enemies). As the player attempts the higher difficulties, he will encounter foes from the <i>Hurricane Packs</i>, as well as new ones, like explosive bats, flame ninjas (red-clad ninjas whose attacks inflict additional flame damage), and Ryu&#39;s evil shadows, the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Fiends" id="w">Doppelganger Fiends</a>. New costumes for Ryu were also available for the player to unlock, as well as the <i><a href="/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_(arcade_game)" id="w">Ninja Gaiden arcade game</a></i> (which took the place of the three bonus unlockable NES games in <i>Ninja Gaiden</i>).</p>
<p>Mission Mode introduced 46 missions concentrating on combat in small arenas. The majority of the missions are new scenarios, while several are modified versions of fights found in Story Mode. The game the finalists played in the World Wide Master Ninja Tournament 2004 finalists was implemented as one of the missions. The longest mission is Eternal Legend, which is <i>Hurricane Pack 2</i> implemented on <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i>{{&#39;}}s engine.

<b><i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i></b> is basically a reworked version of <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i> with some changes to it. Contrary to claims of this being the &#34;more complete&#34; version,<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> almost all of the bonus features from the two previous versions were excluded from this version. Unlockable costumes were reduced to only two, and the old NES and arcade games which can be unlocked previously were eliminated. The introductory movie chronicling the legend of the Dark Dragon Blade and the Dragon Sword was also no longer in the game.</p>
<p>Graphics were overhauled to <a href="/wiki/High-definition_video" id="w">high definition</a> standards. Vast changes were made to the layout of a few environments. A great number of new save and shop locations were added, and Rachel&#39;s three chapters were simply inserted amongst Ryu&#39;s Story Mode chapters. New foes, like the biker <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Vigoor military" id="w">MVAPs</a>, the fish-men <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Fiends" id="w">girtablilu</a>, and the wisp-like <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Fiends" id="w">phantoms</a>, were introduced with the two new bosses, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Vigoor military" id="w">Gamov</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ninja_Gaiden_characters#Vigoor military" id="w">Alternator</a>, with quite a few changes made to the specifications (AI, damage, etc) of the old foes. The player can fight these foes with the new weapon, a pair of <a href="/wiki/Katana" id="w">katanas</a>, the Dragon&#39;s Claw &#38; Tiger&#39;s Fang.</p>
<p>Ryu&#39;s reverse wind technique was replaced with that of his ninja foes. He can now fight on water, and shoot arrows in mid-air. The most prominent change allowed the player to use restoration items without going through the menus. The controller can also be shaken to increase a casted ninpo&#39;s power. If the player had played the demo before starting the very first game on the retail version, a bonus amount of yellow essence will be awarded based on the player&#39;s achievements in the demo.</p>
<p>From <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> onwards, Survival Mode is available in the form of three separate packages for <i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i> on the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_Network" id="w">PlayStation Network</a>, each costing a small fee to download.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup> Each package adds a set of themed missions (Weapon Master, Speed Master, Rachel Master) to the new Survival Mode option.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> The player goes through the missions without any restoration item, and keeps fighting enemies until the character&#39;s life is reduced to zero. Online rankings primarily keep track of the player&#39;s individual mission records, in terms of the number of kills.

<p>Tecmo produces several merchandises for its own products, and <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> is no exception. Its online shop carries mostly apparel in the form of caps, wristbands, t-shirts, etc. Most of these were produced for the launches of the <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> games, or for the Master Ninja Tournaments. The original soundtrack of the game has also been released to the music industry.</p>
<p>Kotobukiya was contracted to produce PVC figures for the collectible industry. The statues are in the <a href="/wiki/1:6_scale_modeling" id="w">1/6th scale</a>, ranging from 10.6 to 12.4 inches tall.

GameSpot hailed it having the best visual and audio presentation on the Xbox and its new features, &#34;mission mode distills the game down to its purest essentials&#34;. IGN called its release &#34;a rare and welcome day&#34; for a re-release which can &#34;bring your excitement levels back to the first time you played the game.&#34;</p>
<p>From a technical viewpoint, <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> and <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i> were regarded by the reviewers as epitomes of Xbox programming, fully using and pushing to the limits the resources of the console while still performing fluidly. GameSpot was floored by their &#34;Absolutely first-rate presentation--visuals and audio still second-to-none&#34; while IGN claimed their standards were such &#34;that can make you momentarily forget about the next generation of consoles&#34;. When the Xbox 360 was released, <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> and <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i> were listed among the Xbox&#39;s top games and set for <a href="/wiki/Backward_compatibility" id="w">backward compatibility</a> in all three regions right at the very start.<sup id="_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#_note-107" title="">[107]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#_note-108" title="">[108]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#_note-109" title="">[109]</a></sup></p>
<p>When <i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i> was released, the reviewing community was divided in its opinion over the technical aspects. While <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly" id="w">EGM</a> gushed over the updated graphics, calling it &#34;a gorgeous reworking of the modern ninja classic&#34;, Pro-G was harsh on it, saying they are average by next-gen standards with occasional &#34;tearing, jagged edges and miss matched collision between bloodstains and walls.&#34; Frequent loadings unseen in the Xbox versions (which refuse to go away despite installing the game on the local hard drive), as well as previous recognized flaws remaining unfixed were on the lists of complaints, characterized by EGM bemoaning &#34;weird glitches (sync problems that make the screen &#34;tear&#34; when the camera moves, odd bouts of loading where the screen briefly fades to gray, even in combat)&#34; made the game &#34;feel like a bit of a slapdash port.&#34;</p>
<p><i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i>{{&#39;}}s lack of new attractive features raised the question on the value of a remake of a remake of a game. Pro-G stated none of <i>Sigma</i>{{&#39;}}s features made it worthwhile as a full priced game which &#34;has, in effect, been available for years in one form or another&#34; while <a href="/wiki/Eurogamer" id="w">Eurogamer</a> said <i>Sigma</i> lacked the &#34;wow factor&#34;, compared to the advancements found in <i><a href="/wiki/God_of_War_(video_game)" id="w">God of War</a></i> <i>1</i> and <i>2</i>. EGM mocked the controller-shaking to power up a ninpo as a &#34;foolishly tacked-on Sixaxis functionality&#34; and &#34;silly&#34;. Rachel&#39;s implementation as a playable character was dampened with IGN wishing they could &#34;get back to Ryu&#39;s sections simply because he&#39;s more fun to play&#34;, though DailyGame said her slowness brings &#34;much-needed respite for newcomers and provide something new for experienced players.&#34;<sup id="_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#_note-110" title="">[110]</a></sup></p>
<p>The games have become quite well known throughout the gaming community for its difficulty<sup id="_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#_note-111" title="">[111]</a></sup> which is both a blessing and a curse. While <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> appeals to gamers who like <a href="/wiki/Pro-G" id="w">Pro-G</a> desire a &#34;bloody hard, but also bloody good&#34; challenge, casual gamers seem to find the learning curve daunting. IGN enthused about <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i>{{&#39;}}s difficulty but cautioned those with lesser ability will unlikely be able to &#34;get as much out of this game as others due to the incredible difficulty of most of the new content.&#34;</p>
<p>One common criticism of <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> and its offshoots, is with the camera placement. While the default camera controls are adequate for most fights in centering the action on Ryu and his surroundings, there are certain fights where the camera is locked on a certain object (usually a boss), or loses track of Ryu. Although reviewers acknowledged the rotational control of the camera implemented since the <i>Hurricane Packs</i> is an improvement, it is of no help when the camera angle is locked.</p>

<p><i>Ninja Gaiden</i> spawned two re-releases, <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i>, and <i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i>. <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> and <i>Ninja Gaiden Black</i> has accounted for 1.5 million copies sold to consumers, while Tecmo has shipped 500,000 copies of <i>Ninja Gaiden Sigma</i> to the retailers as of August, 2007.<sup id="_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#_note-112" title="">[112]</a></sup> In recognition of its quality, <a href="/wiki/CNET" id="w">CNET</a> and GameSpot <a href="/wiki/Asia" id="w">Asia</a> have inducted <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> into their Hall of Fame.<sup id="_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#_note-113" title="">[113]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#_note-114" title="">[114]</a></sup> <i>Ninja Gaiden</i>{{&#39;}}s story is to be continued in <i><a href="/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_Dragon_Sword" id="w">Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword</a></i>, and further on in <i><a href="/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_II_(Xbox_360)" id="w">Ninja Gaiden II</a></i>, both of which are to be developed under <a href="/wiki/Tomonobu_Itagaki" id="w">Tomonobu Itagaki</a>.</p>
<p>Clive Thompson focused on <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> in his <a href="/wiki/Slate_(magazine)" id="w">Slate</a>&#39;s article on the rewards of conquering difficult games.<sup id="_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#_note-115" title="">[115]</a></sup> In it, he says that while some games are hard just to frustrate and hinder players, overcoming <i>Ninja Gaiden</i>{{&#39;}}s rewards you with &#34;a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of <i><a href="/wiki/War_and_Peace" id="w">War and Peace</a></i>&#34;. <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> is recognised as a game which has successfully struck that balance between challenge and reward.
