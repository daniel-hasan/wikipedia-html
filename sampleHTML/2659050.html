<p><a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a> first competed in the <a href="/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games" id="w">Winter Olympic Games</a> in <a href="/wiki/1936_Winter_Olympics" id="w">1936</a> in <a href="/wiki/Garmisch-Partenkirchen" id="w">Garmisch-Partenkirchen</a>, and has participated in every Winter Olympics since, with the exception of the <a href="/wiki/1948_Winter_Olympics" id="w">1948 Games</a> in <a href="/wiki/St._Moritz" id="w">St. Moritz</a>.</p>
<p>Australia achieved its first medal, a bronze, in 1994 in the men&#39;s 5,000 metres short track relay speed skating event. <a href="/wiki/Zali_Steggall" id="w">Zali Steggall</a> gained Australia&#39;s first individual medal in 1998 when she won bronze in the slalom event.

<p>Australia sent 40 competitors to compete in 10 sports at the <a href="/wiki/2006_Winter_Olympics" id="w">2006 Games</a> in <a href="/wiki/Turin" id="w">Turin</a>, a record number of athletes and events for the nation. For the first time, there was a stated aim of winning a medal, and this goal was achieved when <a href="/wiki/Dale_Begg-Smith" id="w">Dale Begg-Smith</a> won the gold medal in men&#39;s  freestyle skiing. Camplin attained her second medal, a bronze in the aerials event.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h1> History </h1>
<p>Australia first competed at the Winter Olympics in 1936, when its sole representative, <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Kennedy" id="w">Kenneth Kennedy</a>, participated in speed skating. Australia did not send a team to the 1948 Winter Olympics, but has competed at every Winter Olympics since, sending nine athletes to the 1952 Olympics. At the 1956 Winter Olympics, <a href="/wiki/Colin_Hickey" id="w">Colin Hickey</a>, a &#34;rink rat&#34; who was overlooked for ice hockey when he was young because of his small frame,<sup id="_ref-Gordon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gordon" title="">[1]</a></sup> came seventh in the 500 and 1000 metres speed skating. </p>
<p>Australia sent 31 athletes in 1960, its largest team prior to the 2006 Winter Olympics, its size boosted by an outclassed ice hockey team. Hal Nerdal competed in Nordic combined, the only time Australia has ever participated in the event at the Olympics. In contrast to the large 1960 team, the teams in subsequent Olympics were the smallest since 1936, with only three competitors sent in 1968. The 1964 Winter Olympics were marred by the deaths of Australian skier <a href="/wiki/Ross_Milne" id="w">Ross Milne</a> and a British luge competitor. Motivated in part by wanting to prove that Australians can compete with the best (some people attributed Ross&#39;s death to inexperience), his brother <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_Milne" id="w">Malcolm Milne</a> represented Australia at the next two Winter Olympics, won a World Cup event and came third in a World Championship.<sup id="_ref-Gordon_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gordon" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Speed skater Colin Coates competed from 1968 to 1988, coming sixth in 1976 with the 10000 metres event, Australia&#39;s best result prior to <a href="/wiki/Lillehammer" id="w">Lillehammer</a> in 1994. Although a competitor on paper in 1988, Colin was supposed to only be a coach and was forbidden to compete, but when it was time for his event, he put on a uniform and skated his best time ever.<sup id="_ref-Gordon_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gordon" title="">[1]</a></sup> The Winter Paralympics started in 1976, and Australia has attended every Winter Paralympics.</p>
<p>Australia&#39;s short track relay team went into the 1992 Olympics as world champions, but the team crashed in the semi-finals.<sup id="_ref-Bradbury_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bradbury" title="">[2]</a></sup> Australia won its first Paralympic medals in 1992: a gold, a silver and two bronze. In 1994, Australia&#39;s short track relay team won Australia&#39;s first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze, having stuck to their finals plan of staying on their feet, remaining undisqualified and beating at least one of the other three finalists.<sup id="_ref-Gordon_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gordon" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Zali_Steggall" id="w">Zali Steggall</a> won the first individual medal in 1998 with a bronze in slalom skiing.</p>
<p>In 2002, Australia won two gold medals. <a href="/wiki/Steven_Bradbury" id="w">Steven Bradbury</a>, a member of the bronze-winning 1994 relay team, won gold in short track speed skating when all of his competitors in the 1000 metres final crashed out on the final turn. <a href="/wiki/Jacqui_Cooper" id="w">Jacqui Cooper</a> was previously the favourite to win a medal for Australia in aerials, but injured herself in training. <a href="/wiki/Alisa_Camplin" id="w">Alisa Camplin</a>, who hadn&#39;t won a world cup event before and was so nervous she didn&#39;t eat dinner the night before the final,<sup id="_ref-SportsCamplin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SportsCamplin" title="">[3]</a></sup> won the women&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Freestyle_skiing#aerial" id="w">aerial skiing</a>. </p>
<p>In 2006, Australia sent 40 athletes to compete in 10 sports, a record number of competitors and events. For the first time, Australia set a goal of winning a medal.<sup id="_ref-HeraldSunTargetOneMedal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeraldSunTargetOneMedal" title="">[4]</a></sup> 
Aerial skiing medal hopeful <a href="/wiki/Lydia_Ierodiaconou" id="w">Lydia Ierodiaconou</a> injured herself when she landed badly in the second qualification jump, while <a href="/wiki/Jacqui_Cooper" id="w">Jacqui Cooper</a>, who was first in the qualification round, crashed in both of her finals jumps. <a href="/wiki/Alisa_Camplin" id="w">Alisa Camplin</a> won bronze, her second Olympic medal.

Damon Hayler, who was rated as a medal chance in snowboard cross,<sup id="_ref-HeraldSunCrashCourse_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HeraldSunCrashCourse" title="">[6]</a></sup> came seventh in his event. <a href="/wiki/Michelle_Steele" id="w">Michelle Steele</a>, who less than two years ago was a <a href="/wiki/Flags_(sport)" id="w">beach flag</a> sprinter, was seen as a medal possibility in skeleton,<sup id="_ref-SundayMailCoolChange_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SundayMailCoolChange" title="">[7]</a></sup> but inexperience with the intimidating and technical track<sup id="_ref-NervesofSteele_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NervesofSteele" title="">[8]</a></sup> contributed to her coming 13th.  As only eight teams compete in men&#39;s short track speed skating relay, Australia had a good chance of getting a medal in the event,<sup id="_ref-SMHAussiesLand_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SMHAussiesLand" title="">[9]</a></sup> but they did not make it into the A final.</p>
<a id="Public_support" name="Public_support"></a><h1> Public support </h1>
<p>Interest and support in winter sport has grown over time.<sup id="_ref-Bradbury_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bradbury" title="">[2]</a></sup> Australia&#39;s first entry in the Winter Olympics, while consisting of a single person, was officially sanctioned, with the then Australian Olympic Federation evaluating Kenneth Kennedy&#39;s entry. However, supervision and support were relatively minimal. Colin Hickey said that he never got clothing from the Australian Olympic Federation, except for a black <a href="/wiki/Armband" id="w">armband</a> and tie for the 1952 Olympics to mark the death of <a href="/wiki/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">King George VI</a>. He also said that Australian officials had &#34;no control over me ... All they&#39;d do was tell me what times I had to do&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Gordon_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gordon" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>After the 1960 Winter Olympics, in which Australia&#39;s only ever ice hockey team was soundly defeated, there was debate about the trade-off between selection standards and participation. At a 1963 meeting, <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Kennedy" id="w">Kenneth Kennedy</a> complained that the ice hockey team wasn&#39;t given trips because they weren&#39;t world class, but could never become competitive unless they had overseas matches. Edgar Tanner said &#34;I ask the winter sports whether they really believe they are in world class, or world ranking, in the field of sport and whether they can do Australia credit, or just be there.&#34; Bill Young, of cycling, disagreed, saying &#34;I thought the first spirit of the Games was to compete&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Gordon_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gordon" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the 1968 Winter Olympics, in which the only alpine skier was <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_Milne" id="w">Malcolm Milne</a>, skiing delegate Dr Peter Blaxland said that Australia should not send a skier on his own again for psychological reasons. The response was unsympathetic, with Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes expressing concern that no-hopers might be selected.<sup id="_ref-Gordon_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gordon" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1993, a training centre and base called Sonnpark was set up in Axams, near <a href="/wiki/Innsbruck" id="w">Innsbruck</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austria</a>, a joint venture between the Australian and Austrian Olympic Committees for both summer and winter sports.<sup id="_ref-Gordon_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gordon" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Colin_Hickey" id="w">Colin Hickey</a> said about Sonnpark &#34;Yeah. It&#39;s great ... With that sort of back-up, we&#39;d have given [the Europeans] a run for their money.&#34; Australia has since sold the base.<sup id="_ref-FoxFutureOnIce_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FoxFutureOnIce" title="">[10]</a></sup> After the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics, the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Sport#Olympic Winter Institute of Australia" id="w">Olympic Winter Institute of Australia</a> (initially called the Australian Institute of Winter Sports) was created. </p>

No Australian cross-country skiers competed in the Olympics for the first time since 1976, and no bobsleigh sliders competed for the first time since Australia&#39;s debut in the sport in 1988.

Steven Bradbury and Alisa Camplin&#39;s triumphs were celebrated by <a href="/wiki/Australia_Post" id="w">Australia Post</a> issuing postage stamps of them, which followed on from them issuing stamps of Australian gold medallists at the <a href="/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics" id="w">2000 Sydney Olympics</a>. They were produced by high-speed offset stamp-printing, unlike the digitally produced 2000 stamps.

While generally viewed as a country more suited to summer sport (the mock <a href="/wiki/Smiggin_Holes_2010_Winter_Olympic_bid" id="w">Smiggin Holes 2010 Winter Olympic bid</a> required Australia&#39;s tallest mountain to be raised 1000 feet with rubbish, for example), several winter sports take place in Australia. Snow falls on the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Alps" id="w">Australian Alps</a> and parts of <a href="/wiki/Tasmania" id="w">Tasmania</a>. The Australian Alps are within driving range for weekend trips for residents of <a href="/wiki/Sydney" id="w">Sydney</a>, <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" id="w">Melbourne</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canberra" id="w">Canberra</a>, while Tasmanian ski slopes are within day trip range for residents of the state.  However, there are no runs long or fast enough for the <a href="/wiki/Downhill" id="w">downhill</a> competition and the season is quite short, with the snow skiable for only about three months per year.</p>
<p>In 2004, a mogul course called &#34;Toppa&#39;s Dream&#34; was constructed on <a href="/wiki/Blue_Cow%2C_New_South_Wales" id="w">Blue Cow</a>.<sup id="_ref-AlphaShortBumpy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AlphaShortBumpy" title="">[16]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Mount_Buller" id="w">Mount Buller</a> World Aerials is an annual event, the first on the World Cup calendar.

<p>Many major Australian cities have indoor <a href="/wiki/Ice_rink" id="w">ice rinks</a>, enabling participation in some winter sports regardless of the city&#39;s climate—for example, subtropical <a href="/wiki/Brisbane" id="w">Brisbane</a> is a major short track speed skating hub for Australia.<sup id="_ref-Bradbury_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bradbury" title="">[2]</a></sup> Sydney hosted the 1991 short track speed skating World Championships (in which Australia won the men&#39;s relay event), and the 2001 <a href="/wiki/Goodwill_Games" id="w">Goodwill Games</a>, hosted in Brisbane, included figure skating. </p>

James Millar, who was born without his right forearm, was Australia&#39;s first Paralympic cross-country skier since Peter Rickards in 1980. Millar also competed in biathlon. Milton attended his last Paralympics. A target of two medals was set, which took into account the consolidation of disability classes.<sup id="_ref-SMHExpectFewer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SMHExpectFewer" title="">[21]</a></sup> Australia met this target, with Milton winning silver in downhill and Toby Kane winning bronze in super-G.</p>
