<p>Colonel <b>David &#34;Dave&#34; Devall</b> is a well-known meteorologist who presents the weather on <a href="/wiki/CTV_News" id="w">CTV News</a> for television station <a href="/wiki/CTV_Television_Network" id="w">CTV</a> in <a href="/wiki/Toronto%2C_Ontario%2C_Canada" id="w">Toronto, Ontario, Canada</a> having been an employee since 1961.</p>
<p>Dave was born, raised, and educated in Toronto, Ontario (graduate of <a href="/wiki/York_Memorial_Collegiate" id="w">York Memorial Collegiate</a> in the old <a href="/wiki/York%2C_Ontario" id="w">City of York</a>). While studying Radio and Television Arts at <a href="/wiki/Ryerson" id="w">Ryerson</a>, he also served in the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Air_Force" id="w">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> (RCAF) where part of his training centered on meteorology. In <a href="/wiki/1956" id="w">1956</a>, while still a student, he worked at <a href="/wiki/CFPL" id="w">CFPL</a>-TV and then moved to <a href="/wiki/CFRB" id="w">CFRB</a> where he stayed from <a href="/wiki/1957" id="w">1957</a>-<a href="/wiki/1958" id="w">1958</a>. After graduating in <a href="/wiki/1958" id="w">1958</a>, he worked at <a href="/wiki/CHEX" id="w">CHEX</a>-TV in <a href="/wiki/Peterborough%2C_Ontario" id="w">Peterborough, Ontario</a>. When <a href="/wiki/CTV_Television_Network" id="w">CTV Toronto</a> launched in <a href="/wiki/1961" id="w">1961</a>, Devall auditioned with 2,000 other hopefuls; he was one of six people hired as a broadcaster. </p>
<p>Devall&#39;s voice was heard across Canada as <a href="/wiki/Jim_Perry_(television)" id="w">Jim Perry</a>&#39;s announcer on many of his game shows, including <i><a href="/wiki/Definition_(TV_series)" id="w">Definition</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Headline_Hunters" id="w">Headline Hunters</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Eye_Bet" id="w">Eye Bet</a></i>, as well as in <a href="/wiki/Ford" id="w">Ford</a> television commercials on the popular <i><a href="/wiki/Hockey_Night_in_Canada" id="w">Hockey Night in Canada</a></i> program.</p>
<p>A member of the <a href="/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization" id="w">World Meteorological Organization</a>, Dave hones his forecasting skills by regularly attending weather conferences throughout North America. He is always working to further his understanding and knowledge of meteorology and climatology in areas such as severe storm forecasting, ozone studies, UV interpretation and air, land, and sea pollution.</p>
<p>Despite various new weathercasters, Devall remains the senior and top weatherman at the station, and also appears daily on <a href="/wiki/CTV_Newsnet" id="w">CTV Newsnet</a>. His funny antics have made him popular with Toronto viewers. During his early years, he would stand behind a clear <a href="/wiki/Acrylic_glass" id="w">acrylic glass</a> weather map, which necessitated writing backwards with a slightly pink eye shadow type marker. He continues the tradition today with a single daily weather word (since the weather maps are now generated electronically.)</p>
<p>Devall was made honorary colonel of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Forces" id="w">Canadian Forces</a> Squadron 436 at <a href="/wiki/CFB_Trenton" id="w">CFB Trenton</a> in February <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.</p>
