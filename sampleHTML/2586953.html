 film adaptation of <a href="/wiki/Sarat_Chandra_Chattopadhyay" id="w">Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay</a>&#39;s 1914 novella, <i><a href="/wiki/Parineeta" id="w">Parineeta</a></i>, places the story in the <a href="/wiki/Kolkata" id="w">Kolkata</a> of 1962. As the credits roll, scenes from the erstwhile <a href="/wiki/Calcutta" id="w">Calcutta</a> are displayed along with the narrator&#39;s (<a href="/wiki/Amitabh_Bachchan" id="w">Amitabh Bachchan</a>) introduction of the era to the audience. The narration focuses on the night of the marriage of Shekhar (<a href="/wiki/Saif_Ali_Khan" id="w">Saif Ali Khan</a>) and Gayatri Tantya (<a href="/wiki/Diya_Mirza" id="w">Diya Mirza</a>), a rich industrialist&#39;s daughter. The audience is introduced to Navin Rai (<a href="/wiki/Sabyasachi_Chakravarthy" id="w">Sabyasachi Chakravarthy</a>) as Shekhar&#39;s father while we see Shekhar readying himself for the occasion. While he is doing that, images of Lolita calling him by his name flash through his mind. Downstairs, musical celebrations begin as Shekhar meets Vasundhara, a widow from his neighborhood, who is thankful to her son-in-law, Girish (<a href="/wiki/Sanjay_Dutt" id="w">Sanjay Dutt</a>), for supporting their family after the death of her husband, Gurcharan. Lolita, who is present there, playfully confronts Shekhar as to why he is being indifferent to her. Shekhar admonishes her for speaking so in spite of being married. </p>

 angry Shekhar comes back home to play a favorite tune from the past on his piano. The flashback shows a young Shekhar playing the <a href="/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore" id="w">Rabindranath Tagore</a>’s tune on his piano while young Lolita and Koel are around. Lolita, with her parents having died in a car accident, lives with Gurcharan’s family whereas Koel and Charu are her neighbors. As this scene flashes across Shekhar’s mind, he sings a song full of sadness and loss. As time flies, they grow up to become close friends. A rebellious and musically inclined Shekhar, spends his days playing the music of <a href="/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore" id="w">Rabindranath Tagore</a> or <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" id="w">Elvis Presley</a> and composing his own songs with Lolita, rather than becoming part of his shrewd father&#39;s world of profit and business. Part of this rebellion involves resistance to meeting Gayatri Tantia (<a href="/wiki/Diya_Mirza" id="w">Diya Mirza</a>), the beautiful but, devious daughter of a wealthy industrialist, whom his father would like Shekhar to marry into. Meanwhile, Girish, a steel tycoon from London, makes a dramatic entry into Koel’s house. Girish seems smitten by Lolita whereas Koel is by Girish. Shekhar is visibly jealous of Lolita’s close friendship with Girish.</p>
<p>One day, a shocked Lolita, who’s employed at the Rai’s office, realises of a hotel project from Gurcharan’s ancestral <i>haveli</i> (palatial house). On an earlier occasion, Gurcharan had borrowed money from Navin Rai after putting his <i>haveli</i> on mortage. She understands that if the money is not be repayed in a few months, Navin Rai would take over the property. She immediately thinks of asking Shekhar for monetary help. Unforeseen circumstances prevent this and Girish upon realising this, alleviates their problem by making Gurcharan his business partner. Gurcharan repays the debt and the turn of events prompts Shekhar to think why Lolita chose to ask Girish for money instead of him. On one auspicious night, Shekhar and Lolita apparently get married without anyone’s knowledge. </p>

 Shekhar is off to <a href="/wiki/Darjeeling" id="w">Darjeeling</a> on a business trip, Navin Rai violently thunders on Lolita about the loss of his hotel project embarrassing and humiliating her. Rai gets a wall built between his and Gurcharan’s house symbolizing the end of their association. Gurcharan unable to digest this faces a heart attack. Upon Shekhar’s return, Rai informs him of the ill-health of his mother and Gurcharan and viciously adds a note of Lolita and Girish’s marriage. Shekhar is digusted to hear of the marriage and in the anger he scowls at Lolita, humiliating her like his father. In the meanwhile, Girish assists the Gurcharan family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the family’s return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lolita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri. The film returns to the night of Shekhar’s marriage when Girish hands him the ownership papers of Gurcharan’s <i>haveli</i>. With a shock, Shekhar realises that Lolita denied Girish&#39;s marriage proposal and thereby he married Koel. As a conclusion, Shekhar confronts his father and symbolically breaks down the wall separating the two families. He then brings Lolita to his home as his bride much to the delight of his mother.</p>

<p>Prior to <i>Parineeta</i>, <a href="/wiki/Pradeep_Sarkar" id="w">Pradeep Sarkar</a> was a well-known personality in the area of <a href="/wiki/Advertisement" id="w">advertisements</a>. With 17 years in mainstream advertising and 7 years of advertisement film-making and commercial cinema, he completed about 1000 <a href="/wiki/Television_advertisement" id="w">commercials</a> and 15 music videos.<sup id="_ref-pradeepintro_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pradeepintro" title="">[2]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Vidhu_Vinod_Chopra" id="w">Vidhu Vinod Chopra</a>, the film&#39;s producer, took notice of his music videos and contacted Sarkar to direct some of the music videos of the film, <a href="/wiki/Mission_Kashmir" id="w">Mission Kashmir</a> (2000).<sup id="_ref-ref2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ref2" title="">[1]</a></sup> After carving a niche in filming music videos, Sarkar gave the thought of filming <i>Parineeta</i> to Chopra.<sup id="_ref-ref2_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ref2" title="">[1]</a></sup> There began the making of the film. </p>
<p>About the film&#39;s comparison with the novel, Chopra said in an interview that, as compared to its <a href="/wiki/Parineeta_(1953_film)" id="w">1953 namesake film</a> by Bimal Roy, the film&#39;s story was based in the year 1962. He said that it took them one and a half years to script the film, with them adding new characters and emphasizing under-represented characters from the novel.<sup id="_ref-chopra1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chopra1" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-chopra2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chopra2" title="">[4]</a></sup> In a separate interview, Chopra admitted that he was actively involved with the screenplay because the film was an adaptation of the novel. When speaking about cinematic adaptation, Chopra gave due credit to Sarkar, and Natarajan Subramaniam (the film&#39;s cinematographer), for providing the vintage visuals in the film.<sup id="_ref-ref1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ref1" title="">[5]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Saif_Ali_Khan" id="w">Saif Ali Khan</a> once said that the film was initially attempted to be made in a contemporary way. When the film&#39;s crew did not find the depiction appealing, the filming began with the <i>60&#39;s</i> look.<sup id="_ref-refsaif_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-refsaif" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Chopra once cited an interesting anecdote about his belief in Sarkar&#39;s film making abilities. He said that he never personally signed the <a href="/wiki/Cheques" id="w">cheques</a> for the film&#39;s expenditure. He transferred money into Sarkar&#39;s bank account and the cheques were eventually signed by Sarkar and his spouse.<sup id="_ref-chopra1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chopra1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Casting" name="Casting"></a><h3> Casting </h3>
<p>Chopra said in an interview that <a href="/wiki/Saif_Ali_Khan" id="w">Saif Ali Khan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vidya_Balan" id="w">Vidya Balan</a> were not the first choices for the lead roles in <i>Parineeta</i>.<sup id="_ref-ref1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ref1" title="">[5]</a></sup> This fact was corroborated by Saif  in an interview<sup id="_ref-refsaif_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-refsaif" title="">[6]</a></sup> when he said that even though Sarkar had faith in his abilities, Chopra was not too keen on having him. </p>
<p>The choice of Vidya Balan came with Sarkar&#39;s prior work experience with her in three music videos.<sup id="_ref-balan2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-balan2" title="">[7]</a></sup> Chopra said that Vidya was screen-tested for a period of 6 months and only then they were sure of her acting abilities.<sup id="_ref-ref1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ref1" title="">[5]</a></sup> Saif once said that he was not convinced of Vidya&#39;s abilities, since <i>Parineeta</i> was to be her first film.<sup id="_ref-balan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-balan" title="">[8]</a></sup> He instead hoped to work with established actresses like <a href="/wiki/Aishwarya_Rai" id="w">Aishwarya Rai</a> or <a href="/wiki/Rani_Mukherjee" id="w">Rani Mukherjee</a>. However, after seeing Vidya portray the character of <i>Lolita</i>, he was thoroughly appreciative of her performance.<sup id="_ref-refsaif_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-refsaif" title="">[6]</a></sup> Getting an opportunity to debut with big names from the industry along with a lovely character to enact made Vidya accept the role of <i>Lolita</i>.<sup id="_ref-balan2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-balan2" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Shekhar and his friend in the green car.</div> choice of <a href="/wiki/Sanjay_Dutt" id="w">Sanjay Dutt</a> was because of his versatility, said Chopra in an interview.

 Sarkar knew the city of <a href="/wiki/Kolkata" id="w">Kolkata</a> very well, the film was primarily shot there.<sup id="_ref-kolkata_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kolkata" title="">[10]</a></sup> While most of the film was made in Kolkata, a small portion was shot in Darjeeling.<sup id="_ref-chopra2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chopra2" title="">[4]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>To re-create the 60s era, lot of efforts were made by the producers. For instance, Chopra said that it cost them money and difficulty to procure the green colored car which was driven by <i>Shekhar</i> in the film.

<p>Post-release, the same critic said &#34;Vidhu Vinod Chopra&#39;s &#34;Parineeta&#34; - a remake of an old classic of the same name...(had) the love story (which) was received well by the younger generation and it went on to become the biggest hit of the year.&#34;<sup id="_ref-bollywoodcritics1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bollywoodcritics1" title="">[25]</a></sup> The film was generally well-received by the critics<sup id="_ref-pbollywoodcritics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pbollywoodcritics" title="">[26]</a></sup>, with one of them terming the movie as &#34;...a beautiful story, beautifully told. It approximates what most of us expect, and increasingly yearn for, in vain, our cinematic experience.&#34;<sup id="_ref-rediffcritics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rediffcritics" title="">[27]</a></sup> A reviewer from About.com said that it is &#34;contemporary retelling of...(an) engaging and timeless tale rich with human emotion and universal drama&#34;. The reviewer appreciates the film in most of the nuances of film making saying that this is &#34;enhanced by a brilliant musical score, and accentuated by superb performances by Sanjay Dutt, Saif Ali Khan, Raima Sen, Diya Mirza and debutante Vidya Balan in the lead role of Lolita&#34;.<sup id="_ref-aboutcritics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aboutcritics" title="">[28]</a></sup> A news report from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times_of_India" id="w">The Times of India</a></i> states that 3000 copies of the novella were sold within weeks of the films release, owing to the film&#39;s good reception.<sup id="_ref-novellasales_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-novellasales" title="">[29]</a></sup> </p>
<p>About the movie, Derek Elley from <a href="/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" id="w">Variety</a> said &#34;A character-driven meller that&#39;s a treat for the eyes, with performances to match, &#34;Parineeta&#34; is high-end Bollywood near its best&#34;. He also says that, &#34;... though the climax is still emotionally powerful, it comes over as overcooked.&#34;<sup id="_ref-varietycritics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-varietycritics" title="">[30]</a></sup> A mixed review from <i><a href="/wiki/Mid-Day" id="w">Mid-Day</a></i> that says &#34;Pradeep Sarkar weaves the story like magic, especially in the first half ... excelling in the detailing ... the vintage look of the film (that stood out) with authentic costumes, props and the roads of Kolkata&#34;. However, the review criticised the film&#39;s climax terming it as amateur, thereby diluting the whole film&#39;s impact.<sup id="_ref-middaycritics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-middaycritics" title="">[31]</a></sup> Another such review came from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hindu" id="w">The Hindu</a></i> which begins by saying &#34;A simple enough story, but Sarkar tells it well, with some great shots of Shekhar and Lolita together. The review eventually says &#34;Except for the end ... where it is too much to bear.&#34;<sup id="_ref-hinducritics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hinducritics" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The issue of piracy cropped up when a news article published in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Indian_Express" id="w">The Indian Express</a></i> exposed the dark side of the film market. Hardly into weeks of the film&#39;s release, <a href="/wiki/CD" id="w">CD</a>&#39;s were being sold at as low as Rs. 40.<sup id="_ref-expresscontro_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-expresscontro" title="">[33]</a></sup> Another blemish for the film was that Soumitra Dasgupta, a writer and close associate of Sarkar alleged that, the film&#39;s story had a striking resemblance to his parallel work on the novella.<sup id="_ref-timescontro_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timescontro" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
