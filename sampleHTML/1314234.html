<p>The {{nihongo}} of 1948 (as amended) establishes the occasions on which <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> has a legal <a href="/wiki/Holiday" id="w">holiday</a>. This article lists those dates together with other occasions for celebration.</p>
<p>A provision of the law establishes that when a national holiday lands on a Sunday, that holiday is moved to the next day. Also when a day is sandwiched between two national holidays, that day shall also become a holiday (thus <a href="/wiki/May_4" id="w">May 4</a>, sandwiched between <a href="/wiki/May_3" id="w">May 3</a> and <a href="/wiki/May_5" id="w">May 5</a>, is a holiday). By the same law, <a href="/wiki/September_22" id="w">September 22</a> <a href="/wiki/2009" id="w">2009</a> is supposed to be a national holiday because the autumnal equinox is expected to land on <a href="/wiki/September_23" id="w">September 23</a> that year; however, the official date of the autumnal equinox will be decided on <a href="/wiki/February_1" id="w">February 1</a> of that year.

お正月 (<i>Oshōgatsu</i>)</td>
<td><a href="/wiki/January_1" id="w">January 1</a> stands at the beginning of Japan&#39;s most important holiday season. Japanese call this season <i>shōgatsu</i> or <i>o-shōgatsu</i>. The term may refer to January 1–3, 1–7, or 1–20. Historically, <i>shogatsu</i> was a name for January. <a href="/wiki/January_1" id="w">January 1</a> is a national holiday, <i>ganjitsu</i>. Visitors flock to <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" id="w">Buddhist</a> temples, some of which ring the bells just as the holiday begins, once for each of the sins. Many people travel to temples or scenic places to watch the year&#39;s first sunrise. The <a href="/wiki/Japan_Post" id="w">post office</a> delivers the greeting cards that Japanese people write in such great numbers on <a href="/wiki/January_1" id="w">January 1</a>. Traditional decorations include <a href="/wiki/Kadomatsu" id="w">kadomatsu</a>, displays featuring auspicious symbols of pine and bamboo, in a pair flanking the door or gate. Inside the home, a <a href="/wiki/Kagami_mochi" id="w">kagami mochi</a> adorns the altar or the <a href="/wiki/Tokonoma" id="w">tokonoma</a>. The kagami mochi includes layers of a rice cake topped with a <i><a href="/wiki/Daidai" id="w">daidai</a></i>, a citrus fruit with an auspicious name. Mochi also feature prominently in <i>zōni</i>, the vegetable soup of the holidays. Families eat special seasonal food, <a href="/wiki/Osechi" id="w">osechi</a>, which they prepare during the closing days of December so that they will not have to cook too much over the holidays. <a href="/wiki/Karuta" id="w">Karuta</a>, a card game involving the <i><a href="/wiki/Waka_(poetry)" id="w">waka</a></i> poems of the <i><a href="/wiki/Hyakunin_Isshu" id="w">Hyakunin Isshu</a>,</i> is a traditional pastime during the New Year holidays, which typically last several days into January.</td></tr>

Many of these ceremonies serve alcoholic beverages, which are the privilege of adults. Disorderly conduct has led some cities to curtail these ceremonies.

<div class="thumbcaption">Setsubun at Tokuan Shrine.</div> This traditional holiday, although not a national holiday, marks the beginning of spring. Setsubun inherits a number of traditions peculiar to the season. One of these traditions is <i>mamemaki</i>, the throwing of beans. In which, one throws roasted beans out of one&#39;s home, crying <i><a href="/wiki/Oni_(Japanese_folklore)" id="w">oni</a> wa soto, fuku wa uchi</i> (&#34;out with the devils, in with good fortune&#34;). There are regional variations of this saying, and one temple in <a href="/wiki/Nara_Prefecture" id="w">Nara Prefecture</a> even invites the devils in. During Setsubun, each person also eats a number of beans equal in number to his or her age. In recent years, people in Japan have begun using <a href="/wiki/Peanut" id="w">peanuts</a> instead of Soybeans for this part of the holiday festivities.

Following the war, it was eliminated as a national holiday, until the law established it in its present form in 1966 (with the first celebration in the following year). Unlike other national holidays, the law does not establish a date, but rather authorizes an administrative order to do so. An order from the Office of the Prime Minister sets the date.</td></tr>

Other customs include displaying peach blossoms; eating red, white and green diamond-shaped <a href="/wiki/Mochi" id="w">mochi</a>; and drinking <i>shirozake</i>, a white beverage.

<td>On this Japanese twist on Valentine&#39;s Day, a man buys his special woman a treat. The national association of candy makers established this event, which formally began in 1980, although its roots date back a few years. It takes its name from the color of sugar. White Day is not a national holiday. </td></tr>

Around this time, various <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" id="w">Buddhist</a> sects celebrate the spring <i>higan</i>.

<td>This national holiday originally began as the birthday of the <a href="/wiki/Hirohito" id="w">Shōwa Emperor</a> (see <i>The Emperor&#39;s Birthday</i>, below). Following the death of the Emperor, the date continued to be a holiday under the new name: Greenery Day.

<td>This national holiday began as a non-holiday. The holiday law stipulates that a day that falls between two holidays shall also be a holiday, and since this day falls between Constitution Memorial Day and Children&#39;s Day, it too is a holiday.

The <a href="/wiki/Edo_period" id="w">Edo period</a> <a href="/wiki/Samurai" id="w">samurai</a> custom of flying streamers in the shape of <a href="/wiki/Koi" id="w">koi</a> continues. <a href="/wiki/Golden_Week" id="w">Golden Week</a> closes with this national holiday. </td></tr>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Tanabata</div> known as the day of the Star Festival, Tanabata is of Chinese origin. This is the one night on which the lovers Orihime (the weaver princess) and Hikoboshi (the cowherd), separated by the princess&#39;s father, are able to meet. They had married with the father&#39;s approval, but in their wedded contentment, were neglecting their weaving and herding; for this, the father (the Emperor of Heaven) placed them on opposite sides of the river. In this astronomical tale, Orihime is identified with the star <a href="/wiki/Vega" id="w">Vega</a>, and Hikoboshi with <a href="/wiki/Altair" id="w">Altair</a>; the <a href="/wiki/Milky_Way" id="w">Milky Way</a> is the river that separates them. Japanese people celebrate by decorating the shops and streets with bamboo and colorful plastic ornaments. They write their wishes on poem-cards and tie them to the bamboo. Tanabata is not a national holiday; moreover, in some localities the celebrations occur on <a href="/wiki/July_7" id="w">July 7</a> while in others they take place on dates such as <a href="/wiki/August_7" id="w">August 7</a> (which is closer to the traditional date according to the lunar calendar).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Third Monday of July</td>
<td><a href="/wiki/Marine_Day" id="w">Marine Day</a><br/>海の日 (<i>Umi no hi</i>)</td>
<td>The law established this national holiday as a day of gratitude for the blessings of the oceans and for hoping for the prosperity of the maritime nation that is Japan. Prior to 1996, it was known as Marine Memorial Day, and was not a holiday. In 1996, it became a national holiday, with its date fixed as <a href="/wiki/July_20" id="w">July 20</a>. An amendment to the law made it, as of 2003, the Monday holiday it now is.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>July/August 13-15</td>
<td><a href="/wiki/Bon_Festival" id="w">Bon Festival</a><br/>お盆 (<i>Obon</i>)</td>
<td>Obon is a festival with origins in the Buddhist <i>urabon</i> ceremony of giving offerings to one&#39;s parents and other ancestors. In addition, native traditions have become intermixed with Buddhist practice in the present-day Obon. Although it is not a national holiday, many companies close their offices, and people return to their ancestral homes in the country, resulting in traffic jams and overcrowding on the railways both at the beginning and at the end of the August Obon. Bonfires guide the spirits of the departed home. Priests read from the scriptures for the souls; relatives place offerings in front of altars. At the end of the period, a second round of fires guides the spirits back to the other world. Around this time, a special form of communal dancing, <i>bon odori</i>, is popular, with many communities hosting events in public parks to the accompaniment of live or recorded music. The traditional date of Obon was the fifteenth day of the seventh month according to the lunar calendar; after Japan adopted the Gregorian calendar, some people continued to celebrate it on the traditional date, while most adopted either <a href="/wiki/July_15" id="w">July 15</a> or <a href="/wiki/August_15" id="w">August 15</a> (which is close to the traditional date). In recent years, with a decline in religious observance, the August date has become predominant. In addition, the <a href="/wiki/Perseids" id="w">Perseid meteor shower</a> reaches its peak around this time, and since Japanese tradition associates &#34;shooting stars&#34; with the spirits of the departed, this meshes nicely with an August <i>obon</i>.</td></tr>

<td>Third Monday of September</td>
<td><a href="/wiki/Respect_for_the_Aged_Day" id="w">Respect for the Aged Day</a><br/>敬老の日 (<i>Keirō no hi</i>)</td>
<td>This national holiday traces its origins to 1947, when a town proclaimed <a href="/wiki/September_15" id="w">September 15</a> as Old Folks&#39; Day. Its popularity spread nationwide, and in 1966 it took its present name and status. Annually, Japanese media take the opportunity to feature the elderly, reporting the population and highlighting the oldest people in the country.</td></tr>

It commemorates the adoption of the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Japan" id="w">Constitution</a> (which took effect six months later). The date was also a holiday prior to World War II, having been the birthday of <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Meiji" id="w">Emperor Meiji</a>.

<td>On this <a href="/wiki/Shinto" id="w">Shinto</a> holiday, families celebrate a child’s accomplishment of achieving the ages of 3, 5, or 7. By custom, parents bring their children to the <a href="/wiki/Tutelary" id="w">tutelary</a> <a href="/wiki/Jinja_(shrine)" id="w">shrine</a>: boys at ages 3 and 5, girls at 3 and 7. Although previously ages were reckoned by the <i>kazoedoshi</i> system, according to which a child was born with age one and turned two on New Year&#39;s Day, parents nowadays bring their children to shrines according to age based on birthdays. The traditional date was the fifteenth day according to the lunar calendar, that is, the full moon. November is the month when people visit the shrine to give thanks for the harvest, and parents pray in addition for their children. Children receive <i>chitose-ame</i>, a sweet whose name means &#34;thousand-year (i.e. long-life) candy.&#34; It has auspicious red and white stripes, and comes in bags bearing motifs of cranes and turtles, which are also symbols of long life, as well as pines, bamboo and <i><a href="/wiki/Ume" id="w">ume</a></i>.

<td><a href="/wiki/December_31" id="w">December 31</a></td>
<td><a href="/wiki/Ōmisoka" id="w">Ōmisoka</a><br/>大晦日 (<i>Ōmisoka</i>)</td>
<td>In the weeks prior to year&#39;s end, Japanese people hold <i>bōnenkai</i> or &#34;forget-the-year meetings.&#34; Many employers hold these parties to reward their employees for their service during the past year. Held at restaurants, these gatherings are occasions for consumption of large amounts of beer and sake.

<i>Ōsōji,</i> major housecleaning, is part of the New Year&#39;s tradition. The equivalent of &#34;spring cleaning&#34; Japanese households are cleaned thoroughly towards the beginning of the New Year. Once the house is clean, a lot of cooking is done to prepare for the traditional New Year&#39;s meals.

Between Christmas and New Year&#39;s Eve, the holiday season begins as many offices and factories close for a week or so. Traffic jams amounting to 50 km build up as cars leave Tokyo and other major population centers, bound for the countryside. Travel by rail can become difficult as trains on the Shinkansen and other lines are filled with standees. Enormous numbers of tourists leave the country, flocking to destinations like Hawaii and Southeast Asia. 

Shortly before midnight on New Year&#39;s Eve Toshi-koshi soba, which literally translates to &#34;Across the Years Noodles&#34;, are served in houses and temples across Japan just before midnight and eaten as the New Year occurs. At midnight, gongs at local temples are rung 108 times, once to eliminate each type of greed, and is broadcast throughout Japan.

An annual television spectacular is <a href="/wiki/NHK" id="w">NHK</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/K%C5%8Dhaku_Uta_Gassen" id="w">Kōhaku Uta Gassen</a></i> program, on which teams of singers perform in a variety of genres for some hours to close the year. 

New Year&#39;s Eve is not a national holiday.</td></tr></table></div>
