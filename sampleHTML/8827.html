The <b>Docklands Light Railway</b> (<b>DLR</b>) is a <a href="/wiki/Light_rail" id="w">light rail</a> system serving the redeveloped <a href="/wiki/London_Docklands" id="w">Docklands</a> area of <a href="/wiki/East_London%2C_England" id="w">East London, England</a>. It extends to <a href="/wiki/Stratford%2C_London" id="w">Stratford</a> in the north, and <a href="/wiki/Lewisham" id="w">Lewisham</a> in the south, west to <a href="/wiki/Bank_and_Monument_stations" id="w">Bank</a>, close to the City financial district, and east to the rest of the Docklands, <a href="/wiki/London_City_Airport" id="w">London City Airport</a>, <a href="/wiki/Beckton" id="w">Beckton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Woolwich" id="w">Woolwich</a>. The DLR has separate track and trains from the <a href="/wiki/London_Underground" id="w">London Underground</a>, but the two systems share a ticketing system and the DLR appears on the London Underground’s <a href="/wiki/Tube_map" id="w">Tube map</a>. </p>
<p>The trains are computer-controlled and normally have no driver: a Passenger Service Agent (PSA) <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>
<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> on each train is responsible for patrolling the train, checking tickets, making announcements and controlling the doors. PSAs can also take control of the train in certain circumstances including equipment failure and emergencies. Stations are generally unstaffed except the ones below ground, which are required to be staffed in case evacuation is needed.</p>
<p>The DLR has been operated and maintained by a private franchise since 1997. The current franchise, due to expire in April 2013, belongs to Serco Docklands Ltd., a company jointly formed by <a href="/wiki/Serco" id="w">Serco</a> and the former DLR management team.</p>
<p>The DLR system is undergoing continuing expansion, with currently 38 stations. In 2006 it carried over 60 million passengers.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The Docklands Light Railway was 20 years old on <a href="/wiki/31_August" id="w">31 August</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<a id="Before_the_DLR" name="Before_the_DLR"></a><h3> Before the DLR </h3>
<p>The decline of the docks east of London began in the early 1960s, as containerised traffic began to move overseas, and the declining UK manufacturing base shipped less and less through the docks.  The opening of the <a href="/wiki/Tilbury" id="w">Tilbury</a> container docks, further east in Essex, sealed the fate of the docks, and in 1980 control of the now almost out-of-use docks passed to the British government.

<div class="thumbcaption">Tower Gateway station was the DLR’s original link to central London.</div></div>

The <a href="/wiki/Jubilee_line" id="w">Jubilee line</a> as opened (<a href="/wiki/Stanmore_tube_station" id="w">Stanmore</a> to <a href="/wiki/Charing_Cross_tube_station" id="w">Charing Cross</a>) in 1979, was supposed to be the first stage in a new cross-town tube line, stretching from Charing Cross, via <a href="/wiki/Ludgate_Circus" id="w">Ludgate Circus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cannon_Street_station" id="w">Cannon Street</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wapping_tube_station" id="w">Wapping</a>, to various sites in South-East London. One option considered was <a href="/wiki/Lewisham" id="w">Lewisham</a> via <a href="/wiki/Surrey_Quays" id="w">Surrey Quays</a>, taking over the <a href="/wiki/East_London_line" id="w">East London line</a> at that point; another was <a href="/wiki/Thamesmead" id="w">Thamesmead</a> via <a href="/wiki/West_India_Docks" id="w">West India Docks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Royal_Docks" id="w">Royal Docks</a>.           </p>
<p>Although land had been reserved for the construction of a second section (land at the derelict Ludgate Circus and Lewisham amongst others had been bought by London Transport in anticipation of the go-ahead), the escalating cost of a second-stage Jubilee Line saw the project officially postponed indefinitely in the early 1980s.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>A search for a cheaper way to throw public transport across the docks, in order to stimulate regeneration, saw various plans, but the one investigated most eagerly was a light-rail scheme, exploiting much existing former railway infrastructure, to link the West India Docks to <a href="/wiki/Tower_Hill" id="w">Tower Hill</a>, and a northern terminus, either Stratford running alongside the Great Eastern lines out of London, or a street-running railway to the <a href="/wiki/District_line" id="w">District</a> and <a href="/wiki/Central_line" id="w">Central line</a> station at <a href="/wiki/Mile_End_tube_station" id="w">Mile End</a>.  The final decision to invest in a fully automated railway precluded any tram-like ideas, and Stratford was chosen as the northern Terminus, using a bay platform at the far west of the station.  Interchange here was with the Central line and main lines, later the Jubilee line (the regeneration of the docks brought the Jubilee plans full circle &#8212; an extension along the South Bank, via the Surrey Quays/Docks through <a href="/wiki/Canary_Wharf" id="w">Canary Wharf</a> and on to Stratford via the next regeneration &#34;hotspot&#34;, the Greenwich peninsula, opened in 1999).</p>
<p>The initial <a href="/wiki/Tower_Gateway_DLR_station" id="w">Tower Gateway</a>/<a href="/wiki/Stratford_station" id="w">Stratford</a> to <a href="/wiki/Island_Gardens_DLR_station" id="w">Island Gardens</a> (at the southern end of the <a href="/wiki/Isle_of_Dogs" id="w">Isle of Dogs</a>, next to the <a href="/wiki/Thames" id="w">Thames</a> facing <a href="/wiki/Greenwich" id="w">Greenwich</a> (see &#34;extensions&#34; below) was opened by <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in 1987, the costs having been held down to £77 million &#8212; a relatively low figure considering the state of the art technology employed.</p>
<a id="Initial_system" name="Initial_system"></a><h3> Initial system </h3>
<p>As originally conceived, the system was to be entirely above ground and comprise three branches, with their termini at <a href="/wiki/Tower_Gateway_DLR_station" id="w">Tower Gateway</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stratford_station" id="w">Stratford</a> and <a href="/wiki/Island_Gardens_DLR_station" id="w">Island Gardens</a>. </p>
<p>Most of the track was elevated, either on new lightweight concrete viaducts or on disused railway viaducts, with some use of disused surface-level railway right of way. </p>
<p>The system was lightweight, with stations and trains only a single articulated vehicle long. The three branches together totalled 13 <a href="/wiki/Kilometre" id="w">km</a>,<sup id="_ref-facts_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-facts" title="">[6]</a></sup> were connected by a flat triangular junction near Poplar. Services ran Tower Gateway-Island Gardens and Stratford-Island Gardens, meaning that the north side of the junction was not used in regular passenger service.</p>
<p>The stations on the initial system were mostly to a common design and were constructed out of a standard set of parts.  The principal distinguishing feature of the stations was a relatively short half cylindrical glazed blue canopy to provide shelter from the rain.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The view from <a href="/wiki/Tower_Gateway_DLR_station" id="w">Tower Gateway</a> looking east shows <a href="/wiki/Fenchurch_Street_railway_station" id="w">Fenchurch Street</a> approach tracks to the left, the original DLR line in the centre, and DLR train emerging from the tunnel to <a href="/wiki/Bank_and_Monument_stations" id="w">Bank</a> to the right</div></div>
</p>
<p>The initial system proved to have insufficient capacity as the Docklands area developed into a major financial centre and employment zone. Additionally, the Tower Gateway terminus, situated at the very edge of the <a href="/wiki/City_of_London" id="w">City of London</a>, attracted criticism for its poor connections.</p>
<p>In response to this, all stations and trains were extended to two-unit lengths, and the system was extended into the heart of the City of London with a tunnel to <a href="/wiki/Bank_and_Monument_stations" id="w">Bank underground station</a>, which opened in 1991. This extension diverged from the initial western branch, leaving <a href="/wiki/Tower_Gateway_DLR_station" id="w">Tower Gateway station</a> on a limb. It also rendered the initial car fleet obsolete, as its construction was not suitable for use underground <i>(see the <a href="/wiki/#Rolling Stock" id="w">Rolling Stock</a> section, below, and the main article <a href="/wiki/Docklands_Light_Railway_rolling_stock" id="w">Docklands Light Railway rolling stock</a>)</i>.</p>
<p>At the same time, the areas in the east of <a href="/wiki/London_Docklands" id="w">Docklands</a> needed better transport connections to encourage development. This resulted in a fourth branch being constructed, from <a href="/wiki/Poplar_DLR_station" id="w">Poplar</a> via <a href="/wiki/Canning_Town_station" id="w">Canning Town transport interchange</a> to <a href="/wiki/Beckton_DLR_station" id="w">Beckton</a>, running along the north side of the Royal Docks complex. Early designs showed several options through the Blackwall Area <span class="image"><img alt="http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/transport/3tran15.jpg" rel="nofollow" src="http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/transport/3tran15.jpg" /></span>. As part of this extension, one side of the original flat triangular junction was replaced with a <a href="/wiki/Grade_separation" id="w">grade-separated</a> junction west of Poplar, and a new grade-separated junction was created at the divergence of the Stratford and Beckton lines east of Poplar. Poplar station was rebuilt to provide cross-platform interchange between the Stratford and Beckton lines.</p>
<p>The growth of the <a href="/wiki/Canary_Wharf" id="w">Canary Wharf</a> office complex required the redevelopment of <a href="/wiki/Canary_Wharf_DLR_station" id="w">Canary Wharf DLR station</a> from a small wayside station to a large complex with six platforms serving three tracks, beneath a large overall roof and fully integrated into the malls below the office towers. The original DLR station was never completed and was, in fact, dismantled before the line officially opened.  The trains&#39;, automatic operation continued to stop at the location.</p>
<a id="Second_stage_extensions" name="Second_stage_extensions"></a><h3>Second stage extensions</h3>
<p>Early in the days of the DLR&#39;s operation, the <a href="/wiki/London_Borough_of_Lewisham" id="w">London Borough of Lewisham</a> commissioned a feasibility study of extending the DLR under the Thames to Lewisham.  The outcome of the study led the South London borough to push the case for an extension, and eventually a line to <a href="/wiki/Greenwich" id="w">Greenwich</a>, <a href="/wiki/Deptford" id="w">Deptford</a> and Lewisham joined the roster of extensions.</p>
<p>The line was planned to leave the original DLR route south of Crossharbour turn-back sidings, dropping gently to Mudchute, a street level station replacing the high-level Mudchute on the former London &#38; Blackwall viaduct.  Immediately after, the line would drop into tunnel, tracing the route of the viaduct to Island Gardens, a just-below-surface station reached by a staircase.  Crossing the Thames, the line would have a station in the centre of Greenwich, thereafter rising to the surface in deep tunnel and then cut-and-cover to a stop at the mainline <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_station" id="w">Greenwich station</a>, the southbound DLR track offering convenient cross-platform interchange with the city-bound mainline.  From here, the line would snake across concrete viaducts to Deptford, Elverson Road (at street level on a road close to Lewisham town centre), terminating in two platforms lying directly under the mainline platforms at Lewisham, in walking distance of the town shopping centre, and bus services stopping directly outside the station.</p>
<p>The Lewisham extension, authorised as above, opened in 1999. With the opening of the extension, DLR took its first steps from being a local people-mover to a truly important backbone of the east/south-east London transport system.  Further extension to Woolwich, already being shown on London tube maps, and to be built at or close to the future stop on the <a href="/wiki/Crossrail" id="w">Crossrail</a> line to Abbey Wood via West India and Royal Docks, will contribute to this growth.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/2_December" id="w">2 December</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, a new eastward branch, running along the southern side of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Docks" id="w">Royal Docks</a> complex, opened from Canning Town to <a href="/wiki/King_George_V_DLR_station" id="w">King George V</a>, via <a href="/wiki/London_City_Airport" id="w">London City Airport</a>.</p>

<p>The DLR now includes routes extending for a total of 31 <a href="/wiki/Kilometre" id="w">km</a>.<sup id="_ref-facts_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-facts" title="">[6]</a></sup> There are five branches: to <a href="/wiki/Lewisham_station" id="w">Lewisham</a> in the south, <a href="/wiki/Stratford_station" id="w">Stratford</a> in the north, <a href="/wiki/Beckton_DLR_station" id="w">Beckton</a> and <a href="/wiki/King_George_V_DLR_station" id="w">King George V</a> in the east, and to Central London, splitting to serve <a href="/wiki/Bank_and_Monument_stations" id="w">Bank</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tower_Gateway_DLR_station" id="w">Tower Gateway</a>. Although the system allows many different combinations of routes, at present the following four are operated in normal service:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stratford to Lewisham</li>
<li>Bank to Lewisham</li>
<li>Bank to King George V</li>
<li>Tower Gateway to Beckton</li></ul>
<p>Trains during peak times on the Stratford line turn back at <a href="/wiki/Crossharbour_and_London_Arena_DLR_station" id="w">Crossharbour</a> rather than continuing to Lewisham. There are also occasional trains from <a href="/wiki/Tower_Gateway_DLR_station" id="w">Tower Gateway</a> to Crossharbour and <a href="/wiki/Lewisham_station" id="w">Lewisham</a>. There are no <a href="/wiki/Limited-stop" id="w">limited-stop</a> trains on the DLR: every train serves every station on its route.</p>
<p>The northern and southern branches terminate at the National Rail (main line) stations at Stratford and Lewisham. Other direct interchanges between the DLR and National Rail are at <a href="/wiki/Limehouse_station" id="w">Limehouse</a> and Greenwich.</p>

Many DLR stations are elevated, with others at street level, in a cutting, or underground. Access to the platforms is normally by staircase, very few stations having escalators. Since 2000, all DLR stations have had lifts or ramps, making them accessible by <a href="/wiki/Wheelchair" id="w">wheelchair</a>. The stations have high platforms, matching the floor height of the cars, allowing easy access to the trains for passengers with wheelchairs or pushchairs.</p>
<p>Most of the stations are of a modular design dating back to the initial system, albeit extended and improved over the years. This design has two side platforms, each with separate access from the street, and platform canopies with a distinctive rounded roof design. Most stations are unstaffed, although for safety reasons the three stations below ground, <a href="/wiki/Bank_and_Monument_stations" id="w">Bank</a>, <a href="/wiki/Island_Gardens_DLR_station" id="w">Island Gardens</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cutty_Sark_DLR_station" id="w">Cutty Sark</a>, are staffed, as are a few of the busier interchange stations.</p>

<a id="Fares_and_ticketing" name="Fares_and_ticketing"></a><h3>Fares and ticketing</h3>
<p>Ticketing is part of the London Underground fare zone system, and <a href="/wiki/Travelcard" id="w">Travelcards</a> that cover the correct zones are valid. </p>
<p>There are also one-day and season DLR-only &#34;Rover&#34; tickets available, plus a one-day DLR &#34;Rail and River Rover&#34; ticket for use on the DLR and on City Cruises river boats. Oyster Pre-Pay is also available on the DLR &#8212; passengers need to both touch in and touch out their <a href="/wiki/Oyster_card" id="w">Oyster cards</a> on the readers at the entrance / exit to the platforms, or pass through the automatic gates at selected stations.</p>
<p>Tickets must be purchased from ticket machines at the entrance to the platforms, and are required before the passenger enters the platform. There are no ticket barriers in DLR-only stations, and correct ticketing is enforced by on-train checks by the Passenger Service Agent. Exceptions to this rule are <a href="/wiki/Bank_and_Monument_stations" id="w">Bank</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canning_Town_station" id="w">Canning Town</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stratford_station" id="w">Stratford</a> stations, where the DLR platforms are located within the barrier lines of a <a href="/wiki/London_Underground" id="w">London Underground</a> or <a href="/wiki/National_Rail" id="w">National Rail</a> station.</p>
<p>The DLR is used by up to a hundred thousand people daily, with around 60 million journeys yearly.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4825.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4825.aspx">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/4825.aspx</a></p>

<p>In July 1987, a series of minor incidents marred the operation of the royal train (number E2R) carrying <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Queen Elizabeth II</a> as part of the ceremonies marking the opening of the line.  The train had been manually dispatched from its starting point at Island Gardens station five minutes early because of the early arrival of the royal party.  The train was on automatic control and so, being ahead of schedule, was held at the next station (Mudchute) for a few minutes before the driver reverted to manual control &#34;to speed the Royal passage&#34; and continued on to Poplar station, where the royal party were to disembark.  At the station, a member of the royal security detail used the emergency exit to leave the train ahead of the Queen before it had fully stopped.  This caused the train to make an emergency stop in the station, short of its normal position and out of range of the docking beacon that marked its arrival point. The train doors would not open, impeding the Queen&#39;s exit for several minutes.<sup id="_ref-Risks2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Risks2" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Risks3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Risks3" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-ModernRailways3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ModernRailways3" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>The DLR is operated by high-floor, bi-directional, single-articulated cars with four doors on each side, each train consisting of two cars. The cars have no driver’s cab, although there is a small driver’s console concealed behind a locked panel at each car end from which the PSA can drive the car when necessary. Other consoles at each door opening allow the PSA to control door closure and make announcements whilst patrolling the train. Because of the absence of a driver’s position, the fully-glazed car ends provide an unusual forward (or rear) view for passengers. The current stock has a top speed of 50 mph (80 km/hour).</p>
<p>Despite having high floors and being highly automated, the cars are derived from a <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> <a href="/wiki/Light_rail" id="w">light-rail</a> design intended for use in systems with elements of street running. All the cars that have operated on the system to date look similar, but there have been several different types, some still in service and others sold to other operators. A further car type, with quite different styling, is to be introduced in 2007.</p>

</p><a id="Signalling_technology" name="Signalling_technology"></a><h2>Signalling technology</h2>
<p>Originally, the DLR used <a href="/wiki/Railway_signalling" id="w">signalling</a> based on a <a href="/wiki/Railway_signalling#Fixed block" id="w">fixed-block</a> technology developed by GEC-General Signal and <a href="/wiki/General_Railway_Signal" id="w">General Railway Signal</a><sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>. This was replaced in 1994 with a <a href="/wiki/Railway_signalling#Moving block" id="w">moving-block</a> system developed by <a href="/wiki/Alcatel" id="w">Alcatel</a>, called <a href="/wiki/SelTrac" id="w">SelTrac</a>. The same technology is used for some other <a href="/wiki/Rapid_transit" id="w">rapid transit</a> systems, including Vancouver&#39;s <a href="/wiki/SkyTrain_(Vancouver)" id="w">SkyTrain</a>, San Francisco&#39;s Municipal Railway (<a href="/wiki/MUNI" id="w">MUNI</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" id="w">Hong Kong</a>&#39;s MTR. Transmissions occur between each train&#39;s onboard computer and the control centre at Poplar. If this link is broken, the train stops until it is authorised to move again. If the whole system fails the train can run at only 20 km/h for safety until the system is restored. Also, emergency brakes can be applied if the train breaks the speed limit during manual control, or if the train leaves the station when the route has not been set.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<p>The stations between <a href="/wiki/Bank_and_Monument_stations" id="w">Bank station</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lewisham_station" id="w">Lewisham station</a> will be upgraded to allow operation of 3-car trains to increase capacity.

<p>It is expected that the work will be carried out during 2007-2009; the awarding of the £200m contract was confirmed on 3 May 2007 <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup>. The work involves the lengthening of platforms on most stations (except <a href="/wiki/Bank_and_Monument_stations" id="w">Bank</a>), together with viaduct-strengthening works. Most of this section dates from the initial system originally built for single-car operation. <a href="/wiki/South_Quay_DLR_station" id="w">South Quay station</a> will have to be moved as nearby curves preclude lengthening. Due to the cost and the risk to nearby historic buildings, the underground <a href="/wiki/Cutty_Sark_DLR_station" id="w">Cutty Sark station</a> will not be extended.

<dl><dd><b><i>Status</i></b><i> - In consultation phase, route safeguarded</i> - 2016</dd></dl>
<p>This is a proposed extension from Gallions Reach to Dagenham Dock via the riverside at Barking. This would connect the Barking Reach area, a formerly industrial area now undergoing major redevelopment as part of the <a href="/wiki/London_Riverside" id="w">London Riverside</a>, with the Docklands. This new route would cover major developments at Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Dock Opportunity Area, and five stations have been planned at Beckton Riverside, Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Vale and <a href="/wiki/Dagenham_Dock_railway_station" id="w">Dagenham Dock</a>. The extension is key if <a href="/wiki/English_Partnerships" id="w">English Partnerships</a>&#39; plan is to work. As shown in DLR&#39;s first consultation leaflet <sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup>, there are plans for the DLR to extend further than <a href="/wiki/Dagenham_Dock" id="w">Dagenham Dock</a>, possibly to <a href="/wiki/Dagenham_Heathway" id="w">Dagenham Heathway</a> or <a href="/wiki/Rainham_railway_station" id="w">Rainham</a>.</p>

<p>In February 2006 a proposal to extend the DLR to <a href="/wiki/Charing_Cross_tube_station" id="w">Charing Cross station</a> from <a href="/wiki/Bank_and_Monument_stations" id="w">Bank</a> DLR branch was revealed.<sup id="_ref-mrmarch_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mrmarch" title="">[26]</a></sup> The idea, originating from a DLR &#34;Horizon Study&#34;, is at a very early stage at the moment, but would involve extending the line from Bank in bored tunnels under Central London to the Charing Cross <a href="/wiki/Jubilee_Line" id="w">Jubilee line</a> platforms, which would be brought back to public use.  These platforms are now on a spur off the current Jubilee line and are not used by passenger trains.</p>
<p>While not confirmed it is probable that the scheme would also use the existing overrun tunnels between the Charing Cross Jubilee platforms and a location slightly to the west of <a href="/wiki/Aldwych_tube_station" id="w">Aldwych</a>. These tunnels were intended to be incorporated into the abandoned Phase 2 of the <i>Fleet Line</i> (Phase 1 became the original Jubilee Line, prior to the Jubilee Line Extension). However they would need some enlargement because DLR <a href="/wiki/Loading_gauge" id="w">gauge</a> is larger than tube gauge and current safety regulations would require an emergency walkway to be provided in the tunnel.</p>
<p>The two reasons driving the proposal are capacity problems at Bank, having basically one interchange between the DLR and the central portion of <a href="/wiki/London_Underground" id="w">Underground</a>, and the difficult journeys faced by passengers from <a href="/wiki/Kent" id="w">Kent</a> and South Coast between their rail termini and the DLR. Intermediate stations would be at <a href="/wiki/City_Thameslink" id="w">City Thameslink</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aldwych" id="w">Aldwych</a>, for future connection with the <a href="/wiki/Cross_River_Tram" id="w">Cross River Tram</a>.</p>

The main benefit of this extension will be tapping into an area that doesn&#39;t have a direct link to the Canary Wharf site, either existing or proposed.

<p>The current route projections for the cross-London Crossrail Line 1 entail interchanges with the DLR at Custom House, Stratford, and the provision for interchanges at West India Quay (with Crossrail Isle of Dogs station) and London City Airport (with Crossrail Silvertown station). Another option would be to provide an interchange with a possible new station on the DLR (see <i>Connaught Road/Silvertown Interchange station</i> section above).<sup id="_ref-atoproj1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-atoproj1" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
