<p>An <b>aircraft carrier</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Warship" id="w">warship</a> designed to deploy and in most cases recover <a href="/wiki/Aircraft" id="w">aircraft</a>, acting as a sea-going <a href="/wiki/Airbase" id="w">airbase</a>. Aircraft carriers thus allow a <a href="/wiki/Navy" id="w">naval</a> force to project <a href="/wiki/Air_power" id="w">air power</a> great distances without having to depend on local bases for staging aircraft operations. They have evolved from wooden vessels used to deploy a <a href="/wiki/Balloon" id="w">balloon</a> into <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_powered" id="w">nuclear powered</a> warships that carry dozens of fixed and rotary wing aircraft.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Balloon_carrier" id="w">Balloon carriers</a> were the first ships to deploy manned aircraft, used during the 19th and early 20th century, mainly for observation purposes. The 1903 advent of fixed wing airplanes was followed in 1910 by the first flight of such an aircraft from the deck of a US Navy cruiser. <a href="/wiki/Seaplane" id="w">Seaplanes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Seaplane_tender" id="w">seaplane tender</a> support ships, such as <a href="/wiki/HMS_Engadine_(1911)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Engadine&#39;&#39;</a>, followed. The development of flat top vessels produced the first large fleet ships. This evolution was well underway by the mid 1920s, resulting in ships such as the <i><a href="/wiki/HMS_Hermes_(95)" id="w">HMS Hermes</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_H%C5%8Dsh%C5%8D" id="w">Hōshō</a></i>, and the <a href="/wiki/Lexington_class_aircraft_carrier" id="w">Lexington class aircraft carriers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> saw the first large scale use and further refinement of the aircraft carrier, spawning several types. <a href="/wiki/Escort_aircraft_carrier" id="w">Escort aircraft carriers</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/USS_Barnes_(CVE-20)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Barnes&#39;&#39;</a>, were built only during World War II. Although some were purpose built, most were converted from merchant ships, and were a stop-gap measure in order to provide air support for convoys and amphibious invasions. <a href="/wiki/Light_aircraft_carrier" id="w">Light aircraft carriers</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/USS_Independence_(CVL-22)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Independence&#39;&#39;</a> represented a larger, more &#34;militarized&#34; version of the escort carrier concept. Although the light carriers usually carried the same size air groups as escort carriers, they had the advantage of higher speed as they had been converted from cruisers under construction rather than civilian merchant ships.</p>
<p>Wartime <a href="/wiki/Emergency" id="w">emergencies</a> also saw the creation or conversion of other, unconventional aircraft carriers. <a href="/wiki/CAM_ship" id="w">CAM ships</a>, like the <a href="/wiki/SS_Michael_E" id="w">SS &#39;&#39;Michael E&#39;&#39;</a>, were cargo carrying merchant ships which could launch but not retrieve fighter aircraft from a catapult. These vessels were an emergency measure during World War II as were <a href="/wiki/Merchant_aircraft_carrier" id="w">Merchant aircraft carriers</a> (MACs), such as <a href="/wiki/MV_Empire_MacAlpine" id="w">MV &#39;&#39;Empire MacAlpine&#39;&#39;</a>, another emergency measure which saw cargo-carrying merchant ships equipped with flight decks. <a href="/wiki/Battlecarrier" id="w">Battlecarriers</a> were created by the Imperial Japanese Navy to partially compensate for the loss of carrier strength at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Midway" id="w">Midway</a>. Two of them were made from <a href="/wiki/Ise_class_battleship" id="w">&#39;&#39;Ise&#39;&#39; class</a> battleships during late 1943. The aft turrets were removed and replaced with a hangar, deck and catapult. The heavy cruiser <a href="/wiki/Japanese_cruiser_Mogami_(1934)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Mogami&#39;&#39;</a> concurrently received a similar conversion. This &#34;half and half&#34; design was an unsuccessful compromise, being neither one thing nor the other. In addition the superstructure and the turbulent airflow it generated made landing even more hazardous than usual.  <a href="/wiki/Submarine_aircraft_carrier" id="w">Submarine aircraft carriers</a>, such as the French <a href="/wiki/French_submarine_Surcouf" id="w">&#39;&#39;Surcouf&#39;&#39;</a>, or the Japanese <a href="/wiki/I-400_class_submarine" id="w">I-400 class submarines</a>, which were capable of carrying 3 <a href="/wiki/Aichi" id="w">Aichi</a> <a href="/wiki/Aichi_M6A" id="w">M6A &#39;&#39;Seiran&#39;&#39;</a> aircraft, were first built in the 1920s, but were generally unsuccessful at war. Modern navies that operate such ships treat aircraft carriers as the <a href="/wiki/Capital_ship" id="w">capital ship</a> of the fleet, a role previously played by the <a href="/wiki/Battleship" id="w">battleship</a>. The change, part of the growth of air power as a significant part of warfare, took place during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>. This change was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft.</p>
<p>Following the war, the scope of carrier operations continued to increase in size and importance. The <a href="/wiki/Supercarrier" id="w">Supercarrier</a>, typically displacing 75,000&#160;tonnes or greater has been the pinnacle of carrier development since their introduction. Most are powered by nuclear reactors and form the core of a fleet designed to operate far from home. <a href="/wiki/Amphibious_assault_ship" id="w">Amphibious assault carriers</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/USS_Tarawa_(LHA-1)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Tarawa&#39;&#39;</a> or <a href="/wiki/HMS_Ocean_(L12)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Ocean&#39;&#39;</a>, which serve the purpose of carrying and landing Marines and operate a large contingent of helicopters for that purpose. They have a secondary capability to operate VSTOL aircraft. Also known as &#34;commando carriers&#34; or &#34;helicopter carriers&#34;.</p> 
<p>Lacking the firepower of other warships, carriers by themselves are considered vulnerable to attack by other ships, aircraft, submarines or missiles and therefore travel as part of a <a href="/wiki/Carrier_battle_group" id="w">carrier battle group</a> (CVBG) for their protection. Unlike other types of capital ships in the 20th century, aircraft carrier designs since World War II have been effectively unlimited by any consideration save budgetary, and the ships have increased in size to handle the larger aircraft: The large, modern <a href="/wiki/Nimitz_class_aircraft_carrier" id="w">&#39;&#39;Nimitz&#39;&#39; class</a> of United States Navy carriers has a displacement nearly four times that of the World War II-era <a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(CV-6)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Enterprise&#39;&#39;</a> yet its complement of aircraft is roughly the same, a consequence of the steadily increasing size of military aircraft over the years.</p>
<a id="History_and_milestones" name="History_and_milestones"></a><h1>History and milestones</h1>
<p>Though aircraft carriers are given their definition with respect to fixed-wing aircraft, the first known instance of using a ship for airborne operations occurred in 1806, when the British Royal Navy&#39;s Lord <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Cochrane" id="w">Thomas Cochrane</a> launched kites from the 32-gun frigate <i><a href="/wiki/HMS_Pallas" id="w">HMS Pallas</a></i> in order to drop propaganda leaflets on the French territory.</p>

On <a href="/wiki/July_12" id="w">July 12</a>, <a href="/wiki/1849" id="w">1849</a>, the Austrian Navy ship <i>Vulcano</i> launched a manned <a href="/wiki/Hot_air_balloon" id="w">hot air balloon</a> in order to drop bombs on <a href="/wiki/Venice" id="w">Venice</a>, although the attempt failed due to contrary winds.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Later, during the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>, about the time of the <a href="/wiki/Peninsula_Campaign" id="w">Peninsula Campaign</a>, gas-filled <a href="/wiki/Balloon_(aircraft)" id="w">balloons</a> were being used to perform reconnaissance on Confederate positions. The battles soon turned inland into the heavily forested areas of the Peninsula, however, where balloons could not travel. A coal barge, the George Washington Parke Custis, was cleared of all deck rigging to accommodate the gas generators and apparatus of balloons. From the GWP Prof. <a href="/wiki/Thaddeus_S._C._Lowe" id="w">Thaddeus S. C. Lowe</a>, Chief Aeronaut of the <a href="/wiki/Union_Army_Balloon_Corps" id="w">Union Army Balloon Corps</a>, made his first ascents over the <a href="/wiki/Potomac_River" id="w">Potomac River</a> and telegraphed claims of the success of the first aerial venture ever made from a water-borne vessel. Other barges were converted to assist with the other military balloons transported about the eastern waterways. It is only fair to point out in deference to modern aircraft carriers that none of these Civil War crafts had ever taken to the high seas.</p>
<p>Balloons launched from ships led to the development of <a href="/wiki/Balloon_carrier" id="w">balloon carriers</a>, or balloon tenders, during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, by the navies of Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Sweden. About ten such &#34;balloon tenders&#34; were built, their main objective being aerial observation posts. These ships were either decommissioned or converted to <a href="/wiki/Seaplane_tender" id="w">seaplane tenders</a> after the war.</p>

The invention of the <a href="/wiki/Seaplane" id="w">seaplane</a> in March 1910 with the French <i><a href="/wiki/Le_Canard" id="w">Le Canard</a></i> led to the earliest development of a ship designed to carry airplanes, albeit equipped with floats: in December 1911 appears the French Navy <i><a href="/wiki/La_Foudre" id="w">La Foudre</a></i>, the first <a href="/wiki/Seaplane_carrier" id="w">seaplane carrier</a>, and the first known carrier of <a href="/wiki/Airplanes" id="w">airplanes</a>. Commissioned as a seaplane tender, and carrying float-equipped planes under hangars on the main deck, from where they were lowered on the sea with a crane, she participated in tactical exercises in the Mediterranean in 1912. <i>La Foudre</i> was further modified in November 1913 with a 10 meter long flat deck to launch her seaplanes.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/HMS_Hermes_(1913)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Hermes&#39;&#39;</a>, temporarily converted as an experimental seaplane carrier in April-May 1913, is also one of the first seaplane carriers, and the first experimental seaplane carrier of the British Navy. She was originally laid down as a merchant ship, but was converted on the building stocks to be a seaplane carrier for a few trials in 1913, before being converted again to a cruiser, and back again to a seaplane carrier in 1914. She was sunk by a German submarine in October 1914. The first seaplane tender of the US Navy was the <a href="/wiki/USS_Mississippi_(BB-23)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Mississippi&#39;&#39;</a>, converted to that role in December 1913.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many <a href="/wiki/Cruiser_(warship)" id="w">cruisers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Capital_ship" id="w">capital ships</a> of the inter-war years often carried a catapult launched seaplane for reconnaissance and spotting the fall of the guns. It was launched by a catapult and recovered by crane from the water after landing. These were highly successful during World War II; there were many notable successes early in the war as shown by <a href="/wiki/HMS_Warspite_(1913)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Warspite&#39;&#39;</a>’s float equipped <a href="/wiki/Fairey_Swordfish" id="w">Swordfish</a> during operations in the Norwegian fjords in 1940. The Japanese Rufe floatplane derived from the Zero was a formidable fighter with only a slight loss in flight performance, one of their pilots scored 26 kills in the <a href="/wiki/A6M2-N_Rufe" id="w">A6M2-N Rufe</a>; a score only bettered by a handful of American pilots throughout WW2. Other Japanese seaplanes launched from tenders and warships sank merchant ships and small-scale ground attacks. The culmination of the type was the American 300+ mph ({{nowrap}}) Curtiss <a href="/wiki/SC_Seahawk" id="w">SC Seahawk</a> which was actually a fighter aircraft like the Rufe in addition to a two-seat gunnery spotter and transport for an injured man in a litter. Spotter seaplane aircraft on U.S. Navy cruisers and battleships were in service until 1949. Seaplane fighters were considered poor combat aircraft compared to their carrier-launched brethren; they were slower due to the drag of their pontoons or boat hulls. Contemporary propeller-driven, land-based fighter aircraft were much faster ({{nowrap}} / {{nowrap}} as opposed to {{nowrap}} / {{nowrap}} and more heavily armed. The <a href="/wiki/Curtiss_Seahawk" id="w">Curtiss Seahawk</a> only had two 0.50 inch ({{nowrap}}) calibre machine guns compared to four {{nowrap}} cannon in the Grumman <a href="/wiki/F8F_Bearcat" id="w">F8F Bearcat</a> or four 0.50 ({{nowrap}}) cal machine guns plus two {{nowrap}} cannon in the Vought <a href="/wiki/F4U_Corsair" id="w">F4U Corsair</a>.

The <a href="/wiki/Washington_Naval_Treaty" id="w">Washington Naval Treaty</a> of 1922 placed strict limits on the tonnages of battleships and <a href="/wiki/Battlecruiser" id="w">battlecruisers</a> for the major naval powers after <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, as well as limits not only on the total tonnage for carriers, but also an upper limit on 27,000&#160;tonnes for each ship. Although exceptions were made regarding the max ship tonnage (fleet units counted, experimental units did not), the total tonnage could not be exceeded. However, while all of the major navies were over-tonnage on battleships, they were all considerably under-tonnage on aircraft carriers. Consequently, many battleships and battlecruisers under construction (or in service) were converted into aircraft carriers. The first ship to have a full length flat deck was <a href="/wiki/HMS_Argus_(1917)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Argus&#39;&#39;</a> the conversion of which was completed in September 1918, with the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" id="w">U.S. Navy</a> not following suit until 1920, when the conversion of <a href="/wiki/USS_Langley_(CV-1)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Langley&#39;&#39;</a> (an experimental ship which did not count against America&#39;s carrier tonnage) had completed.

<p>The first purpose-designed aircraft carrier to be developed was the <a href="/wiki/HMS_Hermes_(1923)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Hermes&#39;&#39;</a>, although the first one to be commissioned was the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_H%C5%8Dsh%C5%8D" id="w">&#39;&#39;Hōshō&#39;&#39;</a> (commissioned in December 1922, followed by HMS <i>Hermes</i> in July 1923).<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> <i>Hermes</i>&#39; design preceded and influenced that of <i>Hōshō</i>, and its construction actually began earlier, but numerous tests, experiments and budget considerations delayed its commission.</p>
<p>By the late 1930s, aircraft carriers around the world typically carried three types of aircraft: <a href="/wiki/Torpedo_bomber" id="w">torpedo bombers</a>, also used for conventional bombings and <a href="/wiki/Reconnaissance" id="w">reconnaissance</a>; <a href="/wiki/Dive_bomber" id="w">dive bombers</a>, also used for reconnaissance (in the U.S. Navy, this type of aircraft were known as &#34;scout bombers&#34;); and <a href="/wiki/Fighter_aircraft" id="w">fighters</a> for fleet defence and bomber escort duties. Because of the restricted space on aircraft carriers, all these aircraft were of small, single-engined types, usually with <a href="/wiki/Folding_wing" id="w">folding wings</a> to facilitate storage.</p>
<a id="World_War_II" name="World_War_II"></a><h2>World War II</h2>
<p>Aircraft carriers played a significant role in World War II. With seven aircraft carriers afloat, the British Royal Navy had a considerable numerical advantage at the start of the war as neither the Germans nor the Italians had carriers of their own. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of <a href="/wiki/HMS_Glorious" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Glorious&#39;&#39;</a> by <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">German</a> battlecruisers during the Norwegian campaign in 1940. </p>
<p>This apparent weakness to battleships was turned on its head in November 1940 when <a href="/wiki/HMS_Illustrious_(R87)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Illustrious&#39;&#39;</a> launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Taranto" id="w">Taranto</a>. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships in the harbour at a cost of two of the 21 attacking <a href="/wiki/Fairey_Swordfish" id="w">Fairey Swordfish</a> <a href="/wiki/Torpedo_bombers" id="w">torpedo bombers</a>. Carriers also played a major part in reinforcing <a href="/wiki/Malta" id="w">Malta</a>, both by transporting planes and by defending convoys sent to supply the besieged island. The use of carriers prevented the <a href="/wiki/Italian_Navy" id="w">Italian Navy</a> and land-based German aircraft from dominating the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean" id="w">Mediterranean</a> theatre.</p>
<p>In the Atlantic, aircraft from HMS <i>Ark Royal</i> and <a href="/wiki/HMS_Victorious_(R38)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Victorious&#39;&#39;</a> were responsible for slowing <a href="/wiki/German_battleship_Bismarck" id="w">&#39;&#39;Bismarck&#39;&#39;</a> during May 1941. Later in the war, escort carriers proved their worth guarding convoys crossing the <a href="/wiki/Second_Battle_of_the_Atlantic" id="w">Atlantic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arctic_convoys_of_World_War_II" id="w">Arctic</a> oceans.</p>
<p>Many of the major battles in the <a href="/wiki/Pacific" id="w">Pacific</a> involved aircraft carriers. <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a> started the war with ten aircraft carriers, the largest and most modern carrier fleet in the world at that time. There were six American aircraft carriers at the beginning of the hostilities, although only three of them were operating in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Drawing on the 1939 Japanese development of shallow water modifications for aerial torpedoes and the 1940 British aerial attack on the Italian fleet at <a href="/wiki/Taranto" id="w">Taranto</a>, the 1941 Japanese surprise <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" id="w">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> was a clear illustration of the <a href="/wiki/Power_projection" id="w">power projection</a> capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six flattops in a single striking unit marked a turning point in naval history, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. (Though Germany and Italy began construction of carriers, neither were completed. Of the two, Germany&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/German_aircraft_carrier_Graf_Zeppelin" id="w">Graf Zeppelin</a></i> had the greater potential.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Japanese began their advance through <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" id="w">Southeast Asia</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Sinking_of_Prince_of_Wales_and_Repulse" id="w">sinking of &#39;&#39;Prince of Wales&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Repulse&#39;&#39;</a> by Japanese land-based aircraft drove home the need for this ship class for fleet defence from aerial attack. In April 1942, the Japanese fast carrier strike force ranged into the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Ocean_raid" id="w">Indian Ocean</a> and sank shipping, including the damaged and undefended carrier <a href="/wiki/HMS_Hermes_(95)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Hermes&#39;&#39;</a>. Smaller Allied fleets with inadequate aerial protection were forced to retreat or be destroyed. In the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Coral_Sea" id="w">Coral Sea</a>, US and Japanese fleets traded aircraft strikes in the first battle where neither side&#39;s ships sighted the other. At the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Midway" id="w">Battle of Midway</a> all four Japanese carriers engaged were sunk by planes from three American carriers (one of which was lost) and the battle is considered the turning point of the war in the Pacific. Notably, the battle was orchestrated by the Japanese to draw out American carriers that had proven very elusive and troublesome to the Japanese. </p>

<p>Subsequently the US was able to build up large numbers of aircraft aboard a mixture of fleet, light and (newly commissioned) escort carriers, primarily with the introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Essex_class_aircraft_carrier" id="w">Essex class</a> in 1943. These ships, around which were built the fast carrier task forces of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_3rd_Fleet" id="w">Third</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_States_5th_Fleet" id="w">Fifth Fleets</a>, played a major part in winning the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_war" id="w">Pacific war</a>.

Japan also built the largest aircraft carrier of the war, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Shinano" id="w">&#39;&#39;Shinano&#39;&#39;</a>, which was a <i>Yamato</i> class ship converted mid-way through construction after the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at Midway.

</p><a id="Hurricane_bow" name="Hurricane_bow"></a><h2>Hurricane bow</h2>
<p>A hurricane bow is a completely enclosed hangar deck, first seen on the American <a href="/wiki/Lexington_class_aircraft_carrier" id="w">Lexington class</a> aircraft carriers which entered service in 1927. Combat experience proved it to be by far the most useful configuration for the bow of the ship among others that were tried; including second flying-off decks and an anti-aircraft battery (the latter was the most common American configuration during World War II). This feature would be re-incorporated into American carriers post-war. The Japanese carrier <a href="/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Taih%C5%8D" id="w">&#39;&#39;Taihō&#39;&#39;</a> was the first of their ships to incorporate it.</p>
<a id="Light_aircraft_carriers" name="Light_aircraft_carriers"></a><h2>Light aircraft carriers</h2>
<p>The loss of three major carriers in quick succession in the Pacific led the US Navy to develop the light carrier (CVL) from <a href="/wiki/Light_cruiser" id="w">light cruiser</a> hulls that had already been laid down. They were intended to provide additional fast carriers, as escort carriers did not have the requisite speed to keep up with the fleet carriers and their escorts. The actual U.S. Navy classification was small aircraft carrier (CVL), not light. Prior to July 1943, they were just classified as aircraft carriers (CV).<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>The British Royal Navy made a similar design which served both them and <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" id="w">Commonwealth</a> countries after World War II. One of these carriers, India&#39;s <a href="/wiki/INS_Viraat" id="w">INS &#39;&#39;Viraat&#39;&#39;</a>, formerly <a href="/wiki/HMS_Hermes_(R12)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Hermes&#39;&#39;</a>, is still being used.</p>
<a id="Escort_carriers_and_merchant_aircraft_carriers" name="Escort_carriers_and_merchant_aircraft_carriers"></a><h2>Escort carriers and merchant aircraft carriers</h2>
<p>To protect Atlantic <a href="/wiki/Convoy" id="w">convoys</a>, the British developed what they called <a href="/wiki/Merchant_Aircraft_Carrier" id="w">Merchant Aircraft Carriers</a>, which were merchant ships equipped with a flat deck for half a dozen aircraft. These operated with civilian crews, under merchant colors, and carried their normal cargo besides providing air support for the convoy. As there was no lift or hangar, aircraft maintenance was limited and the aircraft spent the entire trip sitting on the deck.</p>
<p>These served as stop-gap until dedicated <a href="/wiki/Escort_aircraft_carrier" id="w">escort carriers</a> could be built in the US (US classification <i>CVE</i>). About a third of the size of a fleet carrier, it carried about two dozen aircraft for anti-submarine duties. Over one hundred were built or converted from merchantmen.</p>
<p>Escort carriers were built in the US from two basic hull designs: one from a merchant ship, and the other from a slightly larger, slightly faster tanker. Besides defending convoys, these were used to transport aircraft across the ocean. Nevertheless, some participated in the battles to liberate the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippines</a>, notably the <a href="/wiki/Battle_off_Samar" id="w">Battle off Samar</a> in which six escort carriers and their escorting destroyers briefly took on five Japanese battleships and bluffed them into retreating.</p>
<a id="Catapult_aircraft_merchantmen" name="Catapult_aircraft_merchantmen"></a><h2>Catapult aircraft merchantmen</h2>
<p>As an emergency stop-gap before sufficient merchant aircraft carriers became available, the British provided air cover for convoys using <i>Catapult aircraft merchantman</i> (CAM ships) and <a href="/wiki/Merchant_aircraft_carrier" id="w">merchant aircraft carriers</a>. CAM ships were merchant vessels equipped with an aircraft, usually a battle-weary <a href="/wiki/Hawker_Hurricane" id="w">Hawker Hurricane</a>, launched by a catapult. Once launched, the aircraft could not land back on the deck and had to ditch in the sea if it was not within range of land. Over two years, fewer than 10 launches were ever made, yet these flights did have some success: 6 bombers for the loss of a single pilot.</p>
<a id="Post-war_developments" name="Post-war_developments"></a><h1>Post-war developments</h1>

<p>Three major post-war developments came from the need to improve operations of jet-powered aircraft, which had higher weights and landing speeds than their propeller-powered forbears.
The first jets were tested as early as <a href="/wiki/3_December" id="w">3 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1945" id="w">1945</a>; a <a href="/wiki/De_Havilland_Vampire" id="w">de Havilland Vampire</a> and jets were operating by the early 1950s from carriers. </p>
<a id="Angled_decks" name="Angled_decks"></a><h2>Angled decks</h2>
<p><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Cvnanim.gif" title=" The angled [[flight deck]] allows for safe simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cvnanim.gif" alt=" The angled [[flight deck]] allows for safe simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft." title=" The angled [[flight deck]] allows for safe simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft." class="location-left type-thumb" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">
<pre>The angled <a href="/wiki/Flight_deck" id="w">flight deck</a> allows for safe simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft.</pre></div>
During the Second World War, aircraft would land on the flight deck parallel to the long axis of the ship&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)" id="w">hull</a>. Aircraft which had already landed would be parked on the deck at the bow end of the flight deck. A crash barrier was raised behind them to stop any landing aircraft which overshot the landing area because its landing hook missed the arrestor cables. If this happened, it would often cause serious damage or injury and even, if the crash barrier was not strong enough, destruction of parked aircraft.</p>
<p>An important development of the early 1950s was the British invention of the angled deck, where the runway was canted at an angle of a few degrees across the ship. If an aircraft misses the arrestor cables, the pilot only needs to increase <a href="/wiki/Engine" id="w">engine</a> power to maximum to get airborne again (referred to as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Bolter_(aviation)" id="w">bolting</a>&#34;) and will not hit the parked aircraft because the angled deck points out over the sea.</p>
<a id="Steam_catapults" name="Steam_catapults"></a><h2>Steam catapults</h2>
<p>The modern <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_catapult" id="w">steam-powered catapult</a>, powered by steam from the ship&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Boiler" id="w">boilers</a> or reactors, was invented by Commander C.C. Mitchell of the British <a href="/wiki/Royal_Naval_Reserve" id="w">RNVR</a>. It was widely adopted following trials on <a href="/wiki/HMS_Perseus_(R51)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Perseus&#39;&#39;</a> between 1950 and 1952 which showed it to be more powerful and reliable than the compressed air catapults which had been introduced in the 1940s.</p>

Another British invention was the <a href="/wiki/Visual_Approach_Slope_Indicator" id="w">glide-slope indicator</a> (also known as a &#34;meatball&#34;). This was a gyroscopically-controlled lamp (which used a <a href="/wiki/Fresnel_lens" id="w">Fresnel lens</a>) on the port side of the deck which could be seen by the aviator who was about to land, indicating to him whether he was too high or too low in relation to the desired glidepath. It also took into account the effect of the waves on the flight deck. The device allowed the pilot to land without direction from the ship, previously provided by a signalman with flags or lighted wands, or an air controller using a radio. It became a necessity as the landing speed of aircraft increased.</p>
<a id="Nuclear_age" name="Nuclear_age"></a><h2>Nuclear age</h2>
<p>The US Navy attempted to become a strategic nuclear force in parallel with the USAF long range bombers with the project to build <a href="/wiki/USS_United_States_(CVA-58)" id="w">&#39;&#39;United States&#39;&#39;</a>, which was termed CVA, with the &#34;A&#34; signifying &#34;atomic&#34;. This ship would have carried long range twin-engine bombers, each of which could carry an atomic bomb. The project was canceled under pressure from the newly-created <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" id="w">United States Air Force</a>, and the letter &#34;A&#34; was re-cycled to mean &#34;attack.&#34; But this only delayed the growth of carriers. <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" id="w">Nuclear weapons</a> would be part of the carrier weapons load despite Air Force objections beginning in 1955 aboard <a href="/wiki/USS_Forrestal_(CV-59)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Forrestal&#39;&#39;</a>, and by the end of the fifties the Navy had a series of nuclear-armed attack aircraft (see also <a href="/wiki/USS_Franklin_D._Roosevelt_(CV-42)#Early career" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;&#39; (CV-42)</a>).</p>
<p>The US Navy also built the first aircraft carrier to be powered by nuclear reactors. <a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(CVN-65)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Enterprise&#39;&#39;</a> is powered by eight nuclear reactors and was the second surface warship (after <a href="/wiki/USS_Long_Beach_(CGN-9)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Long Beach&#39;&#39;</a>) to be powered in this way. Subsequent supercarriers starting with <a href="/wiki/USS_Nimitz_(CVN-68)" id="w">USS &#39;&#39;Nimitz&#39;&#39;</a> took advantage of this technology to increase their endurance utilizing only two reactors. The only other nation to have followed the US lead is France with <a href="/wiki/FS_Charles_de_Gaulle" id="w">&#39;&#39;Charles de Gaulle&#39;&#39;</a> although nuclear power is used for submarine propulsion by France, Great Britain, China and the former Soviet Union.</p>

The post-war years also saw the development of the <a href="/wiki/Helicopter" id="w">helicopter</a>, with a variety of useful roles and mission capability aboard aircraft carriers. Whereas fixed-wing aircraft are suited to air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack, helicopters are used to transport equipment and personnel and can be used in an <a href="/wiki/Anti-submarine_warfare" id="w">anti-submarine warfare</a> (ASW) role, with dipping sonar, air-launched torpedoes, and depth charges; as well as anti-surface vessel warfare, with air-launched anti-ship missiles.</p>
<p>In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the UK and the U.S. converted some of their older carriers into Commando Carriers; sea-going helicopter airfields like <a href="/wiki/HMS_Bulwark_(R08)" id="w">HMS &#39;&#39;Bulwark&#39;&#39;</a>. To mitigate against the expensive connotations of the term &#34;aircraft carrier&#34;, the new <a href="/wiki/Invincible_class_aircraft_carriers" id="w">&#39;&#39;Invincible&#39;&#39; class</a> carriers were originally designated as &#34;through deck cruisers&#34; and were initially helicopter-only craft to operate as escort carriers. The arrival of the Sea Harrier <a href="/wiki/VTOL" id="w">VTOL</a>/<a href="/wiki/STOVL" id="w">STOVL</a> fast jet meant they could carry fixed-wing aircraft, despite their short flight deck. </p>
<p>The U.S. used conventional carriers initially as pure ASW carriers, embarking helicopters and fixed-wing ASW aircraft like the <a href="/wiki/S-2_Tracker" id="w">S-2 Tracker</a>. Later, specialized <a href="/wiki/Landing_Platform_Helicopter" id="w">LPH</a> helicopter carriers for the transport of <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" id="w">United States Marine Corps</a> troops and their helicopter transports were developed. These were evolved into the <a href="/wiki/Landing_Helicopter_Assault" id="w">LHA</a> and later into the <a href="/wiki/Landing_Helicopter_Dock" id="w">LHD</a> classes of amphibious assault ships, similar to the UK model even to the point of embarking <a href="/wiki/Harrier_Jump_Jet" id="w">Harrier Jump Jet</a> aircraft, though much larger.</p>

Still another British invention was the ski-jump ramp as an alternative to contemporary catapult systems. As the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" id="w">Royal Navy</a> retired or sold the last of its <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>-era carriers, they were replaced with smaller ships designed to operate helicopters and the <a href="/wiki/VTOL" id="w">VTOL</a> <a href="/wiki/Sea_Harrier" id="w">Sea Harrier</a> fast jet; ships such as <a href="/wiki/Invincible_class_aircraft_carrier" id="w">&#39;&#39;HMS Invincible&#39;&#39;</a>. The ski-jump allowed Harriers to take off with heavier loads, a <a href="/wiki/STOVL" id="w">STOVL</a> option allowing them to take off with a heavier payload despite its usage of space for aircraft parking. It has since been adopted by the navies of several nations.</p>

<a id="Flight_deck" name="Flight_deck"></a><h2>Flight deck</h2>
<p>{{main}}
As &#34;runways at sea,&#34; modern aircraft carriers have a flat-top deck design that serves as a <a href="/wiki/Flight_deck" id="w">flight deck</a> for <a href="/wiki/Take_off" id="w">take-off</a> and <a href="/wiki/Landing" id="w">landing</a> of aircraft. Aircraft take off to the front, into the wind, and land from the rear. Carriers steam at speed, for example up to {{nowrap}} ({{nowrap}}), into the wind during take-off in order to increase the <a href="/wiki/Apparent_wind" id="w">apparent wind</a> speed, thereby reducing the speed of the aircraft relative to the ship. On some ships, a steam-powered <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_catapult" id="w">catapult</a> is used to propel the aircraft forward assisting the power of its engines and allowing it to take off in a shorter distance than would otherwise be required, even with the headwind effect of the ship&#39;s course. On other carriers, aircraft do not require assistance for take off — the requirement for assistance relates to aircraft design and performance. Conversely, when landing on a carrier, conventional aircraft rely upon a <a href="/wiki/Tailhook" id="w">tailhook</a> that catches on <a href="/wiki/Arrestor_wires" id="w">arrestor wires</a> stretched across the deck to bring them to a stop in a shorter distance than normal. Other aircraft — <a href="/wiki/Helicopter" id="w">helicopters</a> and <a href="/wiki/V/STOL" id="w">V/STOL</a> (Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing) designs — utilize their hover capability to land vertically and so require no assistance in speed reduction upon landing.</p>
<p>Conventional (&#34;tailhook&#34;) aircraft rely upon a <a href="/wiki/Landing_signal_officer" id="w">landing signal officer</a> (LSO) to control the plane&#39;s landing approach, visually gauging altitude, attitude, and speed, and transmitting that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot. From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as mirrors provided information on proper <a href="/wiki/Glide_slope" id="w">glide slope</a>, but LSOs still transmit voice calls to landing pilots by radio.</p>
<p>Since the early 1950s it has been common to direct the landing recovery area off to port at an angle to the line of the ship. The primary function of the angled deck landing area is to allow aircraft who miss the arresting wires, referred to as a &#34;bolter&#34;, to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked on the forward parts of the deck. The angled deck also allows launching of aircraft at the same time as others land.</p>

The above deck areas of the warship (the <a href="/wiki/Bridge_(ship)" id="w">bridge</a>, flight <a href="/wiki/Control_tower" id="w">control tower</a>, and so on) are concentrated to the <a href="/wiki/Starboard" id="w">starboard</a> side of the deck in a relatively small area called an &#34;island&#34;. The starboard side of the ship is used for the island because early carrier pilots showed a tendency to veer left in a crash situation. Very few carriers have been designed or built without an island and such a configuration has not been seen in a fleet sized carrier. The &#34;flush deck&#34; configuration proved to have very significant drawbacks, complicating navigation, air traffic control and numerous other factors.</p>
<p>A more recent configuration, used by the British <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" id="w">Royal Navy</a>, has a &#39;ski-jump&#39; ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was developed to help launch <a href="/wiki/VTOL" id="w">VTOL</a> (or <a href="/wiki/STOVL" id="w">STOVL</a>) aircraft (aircraft that are able to take off and land with little or no forward movement) such as the <a href="/wiki/BAE_Sea_Harrier" id="w">Sea Harrier</a>. Although the aircraft are capable of flying vertically off the deck, using the ramp is more fuel efficient. As catapults and arrestor cables are unnecessary, carriers with this arrangement reduce weight, complexity, and space needed for equipment. The disadvantage of the ski jump — and hence, the reason this configuration has not appeared on American supercarriers — is the penalty that it exacts on aircraft size, payload and fuel load (and hence, range): Large, slow planes such as the <a href="/wiki/E-2_Hawkeye" id="w">E-2 Hawkeye</a> and heavily-laden strike fighters like the <a href="/wiki/F/A-18E/F_Super_Hornet" id="w">F/A-18E/F Super Hornet</a> cannot use a ski jump because their high weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck, or catapult assistance.</p>
<a id="Future_aircraft_carriers" name="Future_aircraft_carriers"></a><h1>Future aircraft carriers</h1>
<p>{{future}}</p>
<p>Several nations which currently possess aircraft carriers are in the process of planning new classes to replace current ones. The world&#39;s navies still generally see the aircraft carrier as the main future capital ship, with developments such as the <a href="/wiki/Arsenal_ship" id="w">arsenal ship</a>, which have been promoted as an alternative, seen as too limited in terms of flexibility.</p>
<p>Military experts such as <a href="/wiki/John_Keegan" id="w">John Keegan</a><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> have noted that in any future naval conflict between reasonably evenly matched powers, all surface ships - including aircraft carriers - would be at extreme and disproportionate risk, mainly due to the advanced capabilities of satellite reconnaissance and anti-ship missiles. Contrary to the thrust of most current naval spending, Keegan therefore postulates that eventually, most navies will move to <a href="/wiki/Submarine" id="w">submarines</a> as their main fighting ships, including in roles where submarines play only a minor or no role at the moment.</p>
