The <b>Australian Defence Force</b> (ADF) is the <a href="/wiki/Armed_forces" id="w">military organisation</a> responsible for the defence of <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>. It consists of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" id="w">Royal Australian Navy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australian_Army" id="w">Australian Army</a>, <a href="/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" id="w">Royal Australian Air Force</a> and a number of &#39;tri-service&#39; units. </p>
<p>During the first decades of the 20th century, the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Australia" id="w">Australian Government</a> established three separate armed services. Each service had an independent <a href="/wiki/Chain_of_command" id="w">chain of command</a>. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments. </p>
<p>The ADF is technologically sophisticated but relatively small. Although the ADF&#39;s 51,000 full-time active-duty personnel and 19,400 <a href="/wiki/Military_reserve_force" id="w">reservists</a> make it the largest military in <a href="/wiki/Oceania" id="w">Oceania</a>, it is much smaller than most <a href="/wiki/Asia" id="w">Asian</a> militaries. Nonetheless, the ADF is able to deploy forces in multiple locations outside Australia.</p>

<a id="Legal_standing" name="Legal_standing"></a><h2>Legal standing</h2>

<p>The ADF&#39;s legal standing draws on the Executive Government sections of the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Constitution" id="w">Australian Constitution</a>. Section 51(vi) gives the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Australia" id="w">Commonwealth Government</a> the power to make laws regarding Australia&#39;s defence and defence forces. Section 114 of the Constitution prevents the States from raising armed forces without the permission of the Commonwealth and Section 119 gives the Commonwealth responsibility for defending Australia from invasion and sets out the conditions under which the government can deploy the defence force domestically.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Section 68 of the Constitution sets out the ADF&#39;s command arrangements. The Section states that &#34;the command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the <a href="/wiki/Governor-General_of_Australia" id="w">Governor-General</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Monarchy_in_Australia" id="w">Queen&#39;s</a> representative.&#34; The Constitution does not mention the Air Force as aircraft had not been invented when it was written. Subsequent legislation places the Air Force under the same command structure. In practice, the Governor General does not play an active part in the ADF&#39;s command structure and the elected <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Australia" id="w">Australian Government</a> controls the ADF. The <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Defence_(Australia)" id="w">Minister for Defence</a> and several subordinate ministers <a href="/wiki/Civilian_control_of_the_military" id="w">exercise this control</a>. The Minister acts on most matters alone, though the National Security Committee of <a href="/wiki/Cabinet_of_Australia" id="w">Cabinet</a> considers important matters. The Minister then advises the Governor-General who acts as advised in the normal form of <a href="/wiki/Executive_government" id="w">executive government</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Current_priorities" name="Current_priorities"></a><h2>Current priorities</h2>

<p>In 2000, the Australian Government developed a White Paper to guide all aspects of its defence policy. The White Paper sets out and explains the ADF&#39;s priorities. The paper states that the ADF has three priorities. The first of these priorities is to maintain the capability to defend Australian territory from any credible attack, without relying on help from the combat forces of any other country. The second priority is to contribute to the security of Australia&#39;s immediate neighbourhood through working with neighbouring countries and participating in <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" id="w">United Nations</a>-sanctioned <a href="/wiki/Peacekeeping" id="w">peacekeeping</a> operations. The third priority for the ADF is to contribute to international coalitions of forces outside of Australia&#39;s immediate neighbourhood where Australian interests are engaged. The ADF is also responsible for contributing to coastal surveillance and responding to emergencies, including natural disasters.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Australia&#39;s National Security. A Defence Update 2007</i> is the most recent Australian Government review of its national security policies. This document states that &#34;because of the increasing complexity of the international security environment, Australia must prepare for a range of possible events, both close to home and further afield, with lessened forewarning of crises.&#34;.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> To meet these events it is argued that the ADF must be capable of acting independently within Australia&#39;s region to deter or defeat threats to Australia&#39;s territory and interests. This includes possessing a capability to conduct military operations at short notice.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The document also states that the ADF must be able to make a significant contribution to international coalition operations outside Australia&#39;s region. The ADF is not expected to be capable of acting independently outside this region, however.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> </p>

Australia has maintained military forces since <a href="/wiki/Federation_of_Australia" id="w">federation as a nation</a> in January 1901. Upon Federation, the Australian Government established the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Army" id="w">Australian Army</a> and Commonwealth Naval Force. In 1909, the Government established the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" id="w">Royal Australian Navy</a>, which absorbed the Commonwealth Naval Force. The Army established the Australian Flying Corps in 1912 although this separated to form the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" id="w">Royal Australian Air Force</a> in 1921. The services were not linked by a single chain of command, as they each reported to their own separate Minister and had separate administrative arrangements. The three services saw action around the world during <a href="/wiki/Military_history_of_Australia_during_World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> and <a href="/wiki/Military_history_of_Australia_during_World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>The importance of <a href="/wiki/Joint_warfare" id="w">&#39;joint&#39; warfare</a> was made clear to the Australian Military during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a> when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for the appointment of a <a href="/wiki/Commander_in_chief" id="w">commander in chief</a> of the three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained fully independent.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The absence of a central authority resulted in poor coordination between the services with each service organising and operating on the basis of a different <a href="/wiki/Military_doctrine" id="w">military doctrine</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The need for an integrated command structured received more emphasis during <a href="/wiki/Military_history_of_Australia_during_the_Vietnam_War" id="w">the Australian military&#39;s experiences in the Vietnam War</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> In 1973, the Secretary of the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Defence_(Australia)" id="w">Department of Defence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Tange" id="w">Arthur Tange</a>, submitted a report to the <a href="/wiki/Government_of_Australia" id="w">Government</a> that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single Department of Defence and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. The government accepted these recommendations and the Australian Defence Force was established on 9 February 1976.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>Until the 1970s, Australia&#39;s military strategy centred on the concept of &#39;forward defence&#39;, in which the role of the Australian military was to cooperate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia&#39;s region. In 1969, when the United States began the <a href="/wiki/Guam_Doctrine" id="w">Guam Doctrine</a> and the British withdrew &#39;<a href="/wiki/East_of_Suez" id="w">east of Suez</a>&#39;, Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self-reliance of the Australian continent. This policy was the <a href="/wiki/Defence_of_Australia_Policy" id="w">Defence of Australia (DOA) Policy</a>. Under DOA, the focus of Australian defence planning was to protect Australia&#39;s northern maritime approaches (the &#39;air-sea gap&#39;) against enemy attack.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> In line with this goal, the ADF was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. The ADF achieved this by increasing the capabilities of the RAN and RAAF and relocating regular Army units to <a href="/wiki/Northern_Australia" id="w">northern Australia</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>At this time, the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of <a href="/wiki/Operation_Morris_Dance" id="w">Operation Morris Dance</a>, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off <a href="/wiki/Fiji" id="w">Fiji</a> in response to the <a href="/wiki/1987_Fijian_coups_d%26%2339%3B%C3%A9tat" id="w">1987 Fijian coups d&#39;état</a>. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Since the late 1980s, the Government has increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to <a href="/wiki/Namibia" id="w">Namibia</a> in early 1989, <a href="/wiki/Cambodia" id="w">Cambodia</a> between 1992 and 1993, <a href="/wiki/Operation_Solace" id="w">Somalia in 1993</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rwanda" id="w">Rwanda</a> between 1994 and 1995 and <a href="/wiki/Bougainville" id="w">Bougainville</a> in 1994 and from 1997 onwards.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Australian_contribution_to_the_1991_Gulf_War" id="w">Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War</a> was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF. Although the warships and <a href="/wiki/Clearance_Diving_Team_(RAN)" id="w">clearance diving team</a> deployed to the <a href="/wiki/Persian_Gulf" id="w">Persian Gulf</a> did not see combat, the deployment tested the ADF&#39;s capabilities and command structure. Following the war the Navy regularly deployed a <a href="/wiki/List_of_recent_Australian_warship_deployments_to_the_Middle_East" id="w">frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea</a> to enforce the <a href="/wiki/Iraq_sanctions" id="w">trade sanctions imposed on Iraq</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

In 1996, <a href="/wiki/John_Howard" id="w">John Howard</a> led the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" id="w">Liberal Party</a>&#39;s election campaign and became Prime Minister. Subsequently, there were significant reforms to the ADF&#39;s force structure and role. The new government&#39;s defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in cooperation with regional states and <a href="/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Australia" id="w">Australia&#39;s allies</a> to manage potential security threats.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> In line with this new focus, the ADF&#39;s force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the ADF&#39;s combat effectiveness.</p>
<p>The ADF&#39;s experiences during the <a href="/wiki/International_Force_for_East_Timor" id="w">deployment to East Timor in 1999</a> led to significant changes in Australia&#39;s defence policies and to an enhancement of the ADF&#39;s ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF&#39;s ability to mount and sustain such operations.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> In 2000, the Government released a new Defence White Paper, <i>Defence 2000 - Our Future Defence Force</i> that placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Government committed to improve the ADF&#39;s capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF and increasing <a href="/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value" id="w">real</a> Defence expenditure by 3% per year.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> In 2003 and 2005, the <i>Defence Updates</i> emphasised this focus on expeditionary operations and the result has been an expansion and modernisation of the ADF.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since 2000, the ADF&#39;s expanded force structure and deployment capabilities have been put to the test on a number of occasions. Following the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks" id="w">September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks</a> on the United States, Australia committed a <a href="/wiki/Special_forces" id="w">special forces</a> task group and an <a href="/wiki/Air-to-air_refuelling" id="w">air-to-air refuelling</a> aircraft to operations in <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a>, and naval warships to the <a href="/wiki/Persian_Gulf" id="w">Persian Gulf</a> as <a href="/wiki/Operation_Slipper" id="w">Operation Slipper</a>. In 2003, approximately 2000 ADF personnel, including a special forces task group, three warships and 14 <a href="/wiki/F/A-18_Hornet" id="w">F/A-18 Hornet</a> aircraft, took part in the <a href="/wiki/Australian_contribution_to_the_2003_invasion_of_Iraq" id="w">invasion of Iraq</a>. Later in 2003, elements of all three services deployed to the <a href="/wiki/Solomon_Islands" id="w">Solomon Islands</a> as part of the <a href="/wiki/Regional_Assistance_Mission_to_the_Solomon_Islands" id="w">Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands</a>. In late 2004, over 1000 ADF personnel deployed to Indonesia in <a href="/wiki/Operation_Sumatra_Assist" id="w">Operation Sumatra Assist</a> following the <a href="/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake" id="w">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a>.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> In May 2006, approximately 2000 ADF personnel deployed to <a href="/wiki/Timor_Leste" id="w">Timor Leste</a> (East Timor) in <a href="/wiki/Operation_Astute" id="w">Operation Astute</a> following unrest between elements of the <a href="/wiki/Timor_Leste_Defense_Force" id="w">Timor Leste Defense Force</a>. </p>

In July 2007 around 3850 Australian Defence Force personnel were deployed on overseas operations. An additional 450 personnel were also deployed on domestic maritime security tasks.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> While these deployments have placed pressure on some elements of the military, and particularly the Army, the ADF is not currently &#39;overstretched&#39;.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ADF currently has two-large scale deployments in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" id="w">Middle East</a>. The ADF&#39;s contribution to the rehabilitation of <a href="/wiki/Iraq" id="w">Iraq</a>, <a href="/wiki/Operation_Catalyst" id="w">Operation Catalyst</a>, forms the largest ADF deployment.

<a id="Future_trends" name="Future_trends"></a><h2>Future trends</h2>

<p>Australia&#39;s changing security environment will lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force. Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack, <a href="/wiki/Terrorist" id="w">terrorist</a> groups and tensions between nations in <a href="/wiki/East_Asia" id="w">East Asia</a> pose threats to Australian security. The unstable governments in many South Pacific countries may lead to some of these countries becoming <a href="/wiki/Failed_state" id="w">&#39;failed states&#39;</a> in the future. Such &#39;failed states&#39; may require military-led interventions to restore civil government.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Demographics_of_Australia" id="w">Australian demographic trends</a> will put pressure on the ADF in the future.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Excluding other factors, the aging of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian <a href="/wiki/Labour_market" id="w">labour market</a> each year. Some predictions are that population aging will result in slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of these trends, the aging of Australia&#39;s population may worsen the ADF&#39;s manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> In addition, the current labour shortages across much of the <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_Australia" id="w">Australian economy</a> may frustrate the ADF&#39;s expansion plans and delay the introduction of new equipment.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>The increasing cost of defence equipment also poses a challenge to the ADF. The <a href="/wiki/Australian_Strategic_Policy_Institute" id="w">Australian Strategic Policy Institute</a> estimates that the cost of purchasing and operating the equipment in the <i>Defence Capability Plan</i> may exceed the projected Defence Budget. If additional resources are not made available to correct this funding shortfall the government may be forced to reduce the ADF&#39;s size.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ADF has developed strategies to respond to Australia&#39;s changing strategic environment and population base. These strategies include expanding the ADF and introducing new equipment in order to increase Australia&#39;s &#39;strategic weight&#39;. To maintain Australia&#39;s qualitative lead over neighbouring states the ADF intends to introduce new technologies and maintain the high quality of Australian military training. The ADF is also seeking to develop and implement improved military tactics based upon the integration of technology and better cooperation between the services.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) is the most senior appointment in the ADF. The CDF commands the ADF under the direction of the <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Defence_(Australia)" id="w">Minister of Defence</a> and is notionally the equal of the Secretary of Defence, the most senior public servant in the Department of Defence.

Hugh White, a prominent academic and former Deputy Secretary in the Department of Defence, has criticised the ADF&#39;s current command structure.

<p>While the individual members of each service ultimately report to their service&#39;s Chief, the Chiefs do not control military operations. Control of ADF operations is exercised through a formal command chain headed by the Chief of Joint Operations (CJOPS), who reports to the CDF. As part of this structure each service is organised into an administrative headquarters (Navy, Army and Air Force headquarters) which supports the service Chief and an operational command (Fleet Headquarters, Land Command and Air Command) which report to the respective service Chief but are responsive to CJOPS. The Navy and Army also have a training command which reports to the head of the respective service (the RAAF&#39;s Training Group has formed part of Air Command since 2006). Several &#39;joint&#39; operational task forces also report to CJOPS. In practice, when ADF units deploy on exercises or operational deployments they are temporarily re-assigned from their respective service to the relevant operational headquarters.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Australian Army is Australia&#39;s military land force. While the Australian Army is principally a <a href="/wiki/Light_infantry" id="w">light infantry</a> force, it is currently being &#39;hardened and networked&#39; and expanded to enable it to conduct higher-intensity operations.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup>   </p>
<p>Land Command is the authority responsible for the operations of Australian land forces and has its headquarters in <a href="/wiki/Sydney" id="w">Sydney</a>. The organisation of the Australian Army&#39;s combat forces is as follows. There are two high-readiness regular <a href="/wiki/Brigade" id="w">brigades</a>, one combined regular-reserve brigade, six <a href="/wiki/Australian_Army_Reserve" id="w">Army Reserve</a> brigades, an aviation brigade and a logistics brigade.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> The Army&#39;s main tactical formations are <a href="/wiki/Battlegroup_(army)" id="w">battlegroups</a> formed around the headquarters of a <a href="/wiki/Battalion" id="w">battalion</a>-sized formation. The Australian Army is currently capable of fielding up to nine battlegroups (one armoured, two cavalry, five infantry and one aviation), though it would not be feasible to deploy all nine battlegroups simultaneously. The &#39;hardened and networked&#39; Army initiative will add two further battlegroups.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> The six Army Reserve brigades suffer from serious shortfalls in personnel and equipment and are not capable of being deployed as formed units or providing full strength sub-units at short notice.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the Australian Army has two <a href="/wiki/Division_(military)" id="w">divisional headquarters</a>, only one (the <a href="/wiki/1st_Division_(Australia)" id="w">1st Division</a>) is deployable as the Deployable Joint Force Headquarters (Land).

Since these reforms most of the &#39;garrison&#39; support services at military bases have been provided by <a href="/wiki/Private_military_company" id="w">private firms</a>. The reforms also led to many of the ADF&#39;s logistics units being disbanded or reduced in size.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> Private firms have increasingly been contracted to provide critical support to ADF units deployed outside Australia.

<p>The Government has introduced new policies to increase recruitment and reduce the ADF&#39;s separation rate.

<p>Women first served in the Australian military during World War II when each service established a separate female branch. The RAAF was the first service to fully integrate women into operational units, doing so in 1977, with the Army and RAN following in 1979 and 1985 respectively.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> The ADF initially struggled to integrate women, with integration being driven by changing Australian social values and Government legislation rather than a change in attitudes within the male-dominated military.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The number of positions available to women in the ADF has increased over time. Although servicewomen were initially barred from combat positions, these restrictions began to be lifted in 1990.<sup id="_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#_note-85" title="">[85]</a></sup> In 2006 approximately 97% of employment categories in the ADF were available to females as well as males. The only positions which women are currently excluded from are those in which there is a high probability of &#39;direct combat&#39;, which includes all <a href="/wiki/Infantry" id="w">infantry</a> positions and other positions in which there is a high probability of <a href="/wiki/Hand_to_hand_combat" id="w">hand to hand combat</a>.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> As a result, while almost all positions in the Navy and Air Force are open to women, women are excluded from a high proportion of Army positions.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Despite the expansion in the number of positions available to women, there has been only limited growth in the percentage of female permanent defence personnel. In the 1989–1990 financial year women filled 11.4% of permanent ADF positions. In the 2005–2006 financial year women occupied 13.3% of permanent positions and 15.6% of reserve positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 40.3%.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup> The percentage of female members of the Australian <a href="/wiki/Labour_force" id="w">labour force</a> increased from approximately 41% to 45% between June 1989 and June 2006.<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Domestic_responsibilities" name="Domestic_responsibilities"></a><h1>Domestic responsibilities</h1>

<p>The Australian Defence Force has a number of domestic responsibilities. In most of these tasks the ADF supports the relevant civilian authorities. These responsibilities are typically undertaken by specialised elements of the ADF, though the services&#39; combat elements can be deployed within Australia in response to major emergencies.</p>
<p>The ADF makes a significant contribution to Australia&#39;s domestic maritime security. ADF ships, aircraft and <a href="/wiki/Regional_Force_Surveillance_Units" id="w">Regional Force Surveillance Units</a> conduct patrols of northern Australia in conjunction with the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Customs_Service" id="w">Australian Customs Service</a>. This operation, which is code-named <a href="/wiki/Operation_Resolute" id="w">Operation Resolute</a>, is commanded by the <a href="/wiki/Border_Protection_Command_(Australia)" id="w">Border Protection Command</a> which is jointly manned by members of the ADF and Customs. Approximately 450 personnel were assigned to Operation Resolute in July 2007.<sup id="_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#_note-120" title="">[120]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the ADF does not have a significant nation-building role, it provides assistance to remote <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" id="w">Indigenous Australian</a> communities. Since 1996 the Army has regularly deployed engineer units to assist remote communities. Under this program a single <a href="/wiki/Royal_Australian_Engineers" id="w">engineer squadron</a> works with one community for several months each year to upgrade the community&#39;s infrastructure and provide training.<sup id="_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#_note-121" title="">[121]</a></sup> The ADF has also taken part in the intervention in remote Northern Territory Indigenous communities since late June 2007. The ADF provides logistical support to the Northern Territory Emergency Response Task Force and has helped assess the communities&#39; needs.<sup id="_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#_note-122" title="">[122]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ADF shares responsibility for <a href="/wiki/Counter-terrorism" id="w">counter-terrorism</a> with civilian law enforcement agencies. Under the Australian National Counter-Terrorism Plan the <a href="/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Australia" id="w">State and Territory police</a> and emergency services have the primary responsibility for responding to any terrorist incidents on Australian territory. If a terrorist threat or the consequences of an incident are beyond the capacity of civilian authorities to resolve the ADF may be <a href="/wiki/Military_Aid_to_the_Civil_Power" id="w">&#39;called out&#39;</a> to provide support. In order to meet its counter-terrorism responsibilities the ADF maintains two elite <a href="/wiki/Tactical_Assault_Group_(Australia)" id="w">Tactical Assault Groups</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Incident_Response_Regiment" id="w">Incident Response Regiment</a> and a company-sized high readiness group in each <a href="/wiki/Australian_Army_Reserve" id="w">Army Reserve</a> brigade and the <a href="/wiki/1st_Commando_Regiment" id="w">1st Commando Regiment</a>.<sup id="_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#_note-123" title="">[123]</a></sup> While these forces provide a substantial counter-terrorism capability, the ADF does not regard domestic security as being part of its &#39;core business&#39;.<sup id="_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#_note-124" title="">[124]</a></sup></p>

The Australian Defence Force&#39;s capabilities enable it to carry out a range of tasks. The size of the force that the government can deploy differs according to the likelihood of high-intensity combat and the distance from Australia. In overall terms, Dr. Mark Thomson of the <a href="/wiki/Australian_Strategic_Policy_Institute" id="w">Australian Strategic Policy Institute</a> assesses the ADF&#39;s size and capability as being typical for a <a href="/wiki/Western_world" id="w">Western</a> nation with Australia&#39;s economic and population base.<sup id="_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#_note-136" title="">[136]</a></sup> The ADF has probably the most capable air and naval capabilities in the South-East Asia region. However, the small size of the Army and the age of much of the RAN and RAAF&#39;s equipment constrains Australia&#39;s ability to make large-scale deployments or engage in high-intensity combat.<sup id="_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="#_note-137" title="">[137]</a></sup> The ADF&#39;s personnel shortages may also limit its ability to quickly conduct new deployments.<sup id="_ref-138" class="reference"><a href="#_note-138" title="">[138]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ADF is highly capable of defeating direct attacks on Australia by conventional forces, though such attacks are highly improbable at present. The ADF&#39;s intelligence gathering capabilities should enable it to detect any attacking force before it reaches Australia. Once detected, the RAN and RAAF would be able to defeat the attacking force while it was still in Australia&#39;s maritime approaches. The Army and RAAF are also capable of defeating small raiding forces once they are detected.<sup id="_ref-139" class="reference"><a href="#_note-139" title="">[139]</a></sup> The ADF currently maintains sufficient forces to meet its domestic security and counter-terrorism responsibilities.<sup id="_ref-140" class="reference"><a href="#_note-140" title="">[140]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ADF does not currently possess the resources that a prolonged large-scale deployment with high-intensity warfare would require. Although the RAN and RAAF are capable of deploying significant numbers of capable ships and aircraft, these forces are neither large nor modern enough to operate independently in a high-threat environment and would typically make up a small part of a larger international coalition force. Due to its relatively small size and lack of firepower the Army&#39;s capability for high intensity warfare presents is even more limited than that of the other services. As a result of these limitations, the ADF is capable of providing only relatively small, but high-quality, &#39;niche&#39; forces for high intensity warfare. Such forces include the Navy&#39;s submarines, the Army&#39;s special forces and the RAAF&#39;s Orion aircraft.<sup id="_ref-141" class="reference"><a href="#_note-141" title="">[141]</a></sup> However, the ADF&#39;s logistic capabilities are insufficient to independently supply such forces deployed in areas distant from Australia. As a result, the ADF can only contribute forces to high intensity warfare outside of Australia&#39;s region when larger coalition partners provide logistical support.<sup id="_ref-142" class="reference"><a href="#_note-142" title="">[142]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ADF is highly capable of undertaking peacekeeping operations around the world. The Navy&#39;s frigates and transport ships, the Army&#39;s light infantry battalions and the RAAF&#39;s transport aircraft are well-suited to peacekeeping. The ADF has the capability to undertake peacekeeping and low-intensity warfare operations independently in Australia&#39;s region and can sustain such deployments for a lengthy period. It is also capable of leading international peacekeeping forces in the Asia-Pacific region.<sup id="_ref-143" class="reference"><a href="#_note-143" title="">[143]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the ADF&#39;s capacity to participate in high-intensity warfare is limited, the Government does not presently require that the military possess such capabilities. The information released in the <i>Defence Annual Report</i> indicates that the ADF consistently meets most of the readiness targets which are set by the Government. The ADF&#39;s performance in meeting the Government&#39;s requirements improved between 2000–01 and 2005–06, with the majority of these targets being met. The only readiness targets to be consistently missed over this period were those set for the Army Reserve and the Army&#39;s logistic support forces.<sup id="_ref-144" class="reference"><a href="#_note-144" title="">[144]</a></sup></p>
