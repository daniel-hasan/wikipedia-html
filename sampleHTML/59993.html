<p>&#34;<b>Smells Like Teen Spirit</b>&#34; is a song by the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Rock_music" id="w">rock</a> band <a href="/wiki/Nirvana_(band)" id="w">Nirvana</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Opening_track" id="w">opening track</a> and lead <a href="/wiki/Single_(music)" id="w">single</a> from the band&#39;s 1991 breakthrough album <i><a href="/wiki/Nevermind" id="w">Nevermind</a></i>.

<p>The unexpected success of &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; propelled <i>Nevermind</i> to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, often marked as the point where <a href="/wiki/Alternative_rock" id="w">alternative rock</a> entered the mainstream.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> &#34;Teen Spirit&#34; was Nirvana&#39;s first and biggest hit, reaching number six on the <i><a href="/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)" id="w">Billboard</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100" id="w">Hot 100</a> and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992.</p>
<p>&#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; received many critical plaudits, including topping the <i><a href="/wiki/Village_Voice" id="w">Village Voice</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Pazz_%26amp%3B_Jop" id="w">Pazz &#38; Jop</a> critics&#39; poll and winning two <a href="/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Awards" id="w">MTV Video Music Awards</a> for its <a href="/wiki/Music_video" id="w">music video</a>, which was in heavy rotation on <a href="/wiki/Music_television" id="w">music television</a>.

In the years since Nirvana&#39;s breakup, listeners and critics have continued to praise &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; as one of the greatest rock songs of all time.</p>
<a id="Origins_and_recording" name="Origins_and_recording"></a><h2>Origins and recording</h2>
<p>In a January 1994 <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" id="w">Rolling Stone</a></i> interview, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain revealed that &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; was an attempt to write a song in the style of the <a href="/wiki/Pixies" id="w">Pixies</a>, a band he greatly admired. He explained:<sup id="_ref-pixies_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pixies" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>Cobain did not begin to write &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; until a few weeks before recording started on Nirvana&#39;s second album, <i>Nevermind</i>, in 1991.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> When he first presented the song to his bandmates, it comprised just the main riff and the chorus vocal melody,<sup id="_ref-az176_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-az176" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-rsslts_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rsslts" title="">[7]</a></sup> which <a href="/wiki/Bassist" id="w">bassist</a> Krist Novoselic dismissed at the time as &#34;ridiculous.&#34; In response, Cobain made the band play the riff for &#34;an hour and a half.&#34;<sup id="_ref-pixies_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pixies" title="">[4]</a></sup> In a 2001 interview, Novoselic recalled that after playing the riff repeatedly, he thought, &#34;&#39;Wait a minute. Why don&#39;t we just kind of slow this down a bit?&#39; So I started playing the verse part. And Dave [started] playing a drum beat.&#34;<sup id="_ref-requiem_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-requiem" title="">[8]</a></sup> As a result, all three band members are credited as songwriters.</p>
<p>Cobain came up with the song&#39;s title when his friend <a href="/wiki/Kathleen_Hanna" id="w">Kathleen Hanna</a>, at the time the lead singer of the <a href="/wiki/Riot_Grrrl" id="w">Riot Grrrl</a> punk band <a href="/wiki/Bikini_Kill" id="w">Bikini Kill</a>, spray painted &#34;Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; on his wall. Since they had been discussing <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" id="w">anarchism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Punk_rock" id="w">punk rock</a>, and similar topics, Cobain interpreted the slogan as having a revolutionary meaning. What Hanna actually meant, however, was that Cobain smelled Like the deodorant <a href="/wiki/Teen_Spirit_(deodorant)" id="w">Teen Spirit</a>, which his then-girlfriend <a href="/wiki/Tobi_Vail" id="w">Tobi Vail</a> wore. Cobain later claimed that he was unaware that it was a brand of deodorant until months after the single was released.<sup id="_ref-Azerrad21112_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Azerrad21112" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; was, along with &#34;<a href="/wiki/Come_as_You_Are_(Nirvana_song)" id="w">Come as You Are</a>,&#34; one of a few new songs that had been written since Nirvana&#39;s first recording sessions with producer Butch Vig in 1990. Prior to the start of the <i>Nevermind</i> recording sessions, the band sent Vig a rough cassette demo of song rehearsals that included &#34;Teen Spirit.&#34; While the sound of the tape was wildly distorted due to the band playing at a loud volume, Vig could pick out some of the melody and felt the song had promise.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Nirvana recorded &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; at Sound City recording studio in <a href="/wiki/Van_Nuys" id="w">Van Nuys</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a> with Vig in May of 1991.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Vig suggested some arrangement changes to the song, including moving a guitar ad lib into the chorus, and trimming down the chorus length.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> The band recorded the basic track for the song in three takes, and decided to keep the second one.<sup id="_ref-rsslts_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rsslts" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

&#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; is written in the <a href="/wiki/Key_(music)" id="w">key</a> of <a href="/wiki/F_minor" id="w">F minor</a>, with the main guitar riff constructed from four <a href="/wiki/Power_chord" id="w">power chords</a> (F5-Bb5-Ab5-Db5) played in a <a href="/wiki/Syncopation" id="w">syncopated</a> <a href="/wiki/Sixteenth_note" id="w">sixteenth note</a> strum by Cobain.<sup id="_ref-music_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-music" title="">[13]</a></sup> The guitar chords were double-tracked because the band &#34;wanted to make it sound more powerful,&#34; according to Vig.<sup id="_ref-classicalbums_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-classicalbums" title="">[14]</a></sup> The chords occasionally lapse into <a href="/wiki/Added_tone_chord" id="w">suspended chord</a> voicings as a result of Cobain playing the bottom four strings of the guitar for the thickness of sound.<sup id="_ref-music_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-music" title="">[13]</a></sup> Due to being neither major nor minor, the occasional use of suspended chords also allows the <a href="/wiki/Chord_progression" id="w">chord progression</a> used in the riff to be thought of as a I-IV-bIII-bVI major chord progression. The song&#39;s chord progression has been described as &#34;an ambiguous, harmonically dislocated sequence,&#34; and &#34;it is the asymmetrical nature of Cobain&#39;s riff [. . .] that makes it so great.&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> Listeners made many comments that the song bore a passing resemblance to <a href="/wiki/Boston_(band)" id="w">Boston</a>&#39;s 1976 hit &#34;<a href="/wiki/More_Than_a_Feeling" id="w">More Than a Feeling</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-az176_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-az176" title="">[6]</a></sup> Cobain himself held similar opinions, saying that it &#34;was such a clichéd riff. It was so close to a Boston riff or [<a href="/wiki/The_Kingsmen" id="w">The Kingsmen</a>&#39;s] &#39;<a href="/wiki/Louie_Louie" id="w">Louie Louie</a>.&#39;&#34;<sup id="_ref-pixies_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pixies" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; utilizes a &#34;somewhat conventional formal structure&#34; consisting of four-, eight-, and twelve-bar sections that includes an eight-bar verse, an eight-bar first chorus (pre-chorus), and a twelve-bar second chorus (main chorus).<sup id="_ref-Starr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Starr" title="">[16]</a></sup> Elements of the song&#39;s structure are marked off with shifts in volume and dynamics, going back and forth from quiet to loud a number of times during the length of the recording. This structure of &#34;quiet verses with wobbly, <a href="/wiki/Chorus_effect" id="w">chorused</a> guitar, followed by big, loud <a href="/wiki/Hardcore_punk" id="w">hardcore</a>-inspired choruses&#34; became a much-emulated template in alternative rock because of &#34;Teen Spirit.&#34;<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>The song begins with Cobain strumming the main riff, adding <a href="/wiki/Guitar_effects#Distortion" id="w">distortion</a> when the rest of the band joins in. During the verse Cobain plays a sparse two-note guitar line over Novoselic&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Eighth_note" id="w">eighth note</a> bassline, which outlines the chord progression. In the pre-chorus, Cobain begins to play the same two notes on every beat of the measure and repeats the phrase &#34;Hello, hello, hello, how low?&#34; Cobain then resumes the main guitar riff for the chorus, where the band plays loudly and Cobain yells the lyrics. The first and second choruses both end with a brief four-bar interlude where Cobain shouts &#34;Yeah!&#34; twice over a new riff. After the second chorus, Cobain plays a 16-bar guitar solo that almost completely restates his vocal melody from the verse and pre-chorus.<sup id="_ref-Starr_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Starr" title="">[16]</a></sup> The band extends the third and final verse and chorus as Cobain sings the refrain &#34;A denial&#34; repeatedly. At this point Cobain&#39;s vocals become strained and his voice is almost shot from the force of yelling.<sup id="_ref-classicalbums_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-classicalbums" title="">[14]</a></sup> The song ends with the feedback of the guitar.</p>

<p>&#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; was released on <a href="/wiki/September_10" id="w">September 10</a>, <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a> as the lead single from <i>Nevermind</i>, the band&#39;s major label debut on <a href="/wiki/Geffen_Records" id="w">Geffen Records</a> (DGC). The song was not expected to be a hit, for it was merely intended to be the base-building alternative rock cut. It was anticipated that the follow-up single &#34;Come as You Are&#34; would be the song that could cross over to mainstream formats. However, <a href="/wiki/Campus_radio" id="w">campus radio</a> and <a href="/wiki/Modern_rock" id="w">modern rock</a> radio stations picked up on the track, and placed it on heavy rotation. Danny Goldberg of Nirvana&#39;s management firm Gold Mountain later admitted that &#34;none of us heard it as a crossover song, but the public heard it and it was instantaneous [. . .] They heard it on alternative radio, and then they rushed out like lemmings to buy it.&#34;<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> The video received its world premiere on <a href="/wiki/MTV" id="w">MTV</a>&#39;s late-night alternative rock program <i><a href="/wiki/120_Minutes" id="w">120 Minutes</a></i>, and proved so popular that the channel began to air it during its regular daytime rotation.<sup id="_ref-Azerrad199_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Azerrad199" title="">[19]</a></sup> As a result, <i>Nevermind</i> began to sell thousands of copies a week, culminating in the album knocking <a href="/wiki/Michael_Jackson" id="w">Michael Jackson</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Dangerous_(album)" id="w">Dangerous</a></i> album from the top spot on the <i>Billboard</i> charts in January of 1992.</p>
<p>&#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; was a critical and commercial success. The song topped the 1991 <i><a href="/wiki/Village_Voice" id="w">Village Voice</a></i> &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pazz_%26amp%3B_Jop" id="w">Pazz &#38; Jop</a>&#34; and <i><a href="/wiki/Melody_Maker" id="w">Melody Maker</a></i> year-end polls, and reached number two on <i>Rolling Stone&#39;s</i> list of best singles of the year. The single peaked at number six on the <i>Billboard</i> singles chart the same week that <i>Nevermind</i> reached number one on the album charts.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> &#34;Teen Spirit&#34; hit number one on the <a href="/wiki/Modern_Rock_Tracks" id="w">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart, and has since been <a href="/wiki/RIAA_single_certification" id="w">certified platinum</a> (one million copies shipped) by the <a href="/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America" id="w">Recording Industry Association of America</a>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> However, many American <a href="/wiki/Top_40" id="w">Top 40</a> stations were reluctant to play the song in regular rotation due to its sound, and restricted it to night-time play.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> The single was also successful in other countries. In the United Kingdom, &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; reached number seven and charted for 184 weeks.<sup id="_ref-qpg54_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-qpg54" title="">[23]</a></sup> The song was nominated for two Grammy awards &#8212;<a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Hard_Rock_Performance" id="w">Best Hard Rock Vocal Performance</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Rock_Song" id="w">Best Rock Song</a>&#8212; though it lost to the <a href="/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers" id="w">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>&#39; &#34;<a href="/wiki/Give_it_Away" id="w">Give it Away</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Layla" id="w">Layla</a>&#34; by <a href="/wiki/Eric_Clapton" id="w">Eric Clapton</a>, respectively.

<p>In the wake of Nirvana&#39;s success, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Azerrad" id="w">Michael Azerrad</a> wrote in a 1992 <i>Rolling Stone</i> article, &#34;&#39;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#39; is an anthem for (or is it against?) the &#39;Why Ask Why?&#39; generation.

<a id="Lyrics_and_interpretation" name="Lyrics_and_interpretation"></a><h2>Lyrics and interpretation</h2>

<p>The lyrics to &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; were often difficult for listeners to decipher, both due to their nonsensicality and because of Cobain&#39;s slurred, guttural singing voice. This problem was compounded by the fact that the <i>Nevermind</i> album liner notes did not include any lyrics for the songs aside from selected lyrical fragments. This incomprehensibility contributed to the early resistance from radio stations towards adding the song to their playlists; one Geffen promoter recalled that people from rock radio told her, &#34;We can&#39;t play this. I can&#39;t understand what the guy is saying.&#34;<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> MTV went as far as to prepare a version of the video that included the lyrics running across the bottom of the screen, which they aired when the video was added to their heavy rotation schedule.<sup id="_ref-Azerrad199_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Azerrad199" title="">[19]</a></sup> The lyrics for the album &#8212;and some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs&#8212; were later released with the liner notes of the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Lithium_(Nirvana_song)" id="w">Lithium</a>&#34; single in 1992. American rock critic <a href="/wiki/Dave_Marsh" id="w">Dave Marsh</a> noted comments by <a href="/wiki/Disc_jockey" id="w">disc jockeys</a> of the time that the song was &#34;the &#39;Louie Louie&#39; of the nineties&#34; and wrote, &#34;Like &#39;Louie,&#39; only more so, &#39;Teen Spirit&#39; reveals its secrets reluctantly and then often incoherently.&#34;<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Marsh, trying to decipher the lyrics of the song, felt after reading the correct lyrics from the song&#39;s sheet music that &#34;what I imagined was quite a bit better (at least, more gratifying) than what Nirvana actually sang,&#34; and added, &#34;Worst of all, I&#39;m not sure that I know more about [the meaning of] &#39;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#39; now than before I plunked down for the official version of the facts.&#34;<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#34;Teen Spirit&#34; is widely interpreted to be a <a href="/wiki/Teenager" id="w">teen</a> revolution anthem, an interpretation reinforced by the song&#39;s music video.<sup id="_ref-Crisafulli38_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crisafulli38" title="">[28]</a></sup> When discussing the song in Michael Azerrad&#39;s biography <i><a href="/wiki/Come_as_You_Are:_The_Story_of_Nirvana" id="w">Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana</a></i>, Cobain revealed that he felt a duty &#34;to describe what I felt about my surroundings and my generation and people my age.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Azerrad21112_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Azerrad21112" title="">[9]</a></sup> The book <i>Teen Spirit: The Stories Behind Every Nirvana Song</i> describes &#34;Teen Spirit&#34; as &#34;a typically murky Cobain exploration of meaning and meaninglessness.&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Azerrad plays upon the juxtaposition of Cobain&#39;s contradictory lyrics (such as &#34;It&#39;s fun to lose and to pretend&#34;) and states &#34;the point that emerges isn&#39;t just the conflict of two opposing ideas, but the confusion and anger that the conflict produces in the narrator&#8212;he&#39;s angry that he&#39;s confused.&#34; Azerrad&#39;s conclusion is that the song is &#34;alternately a sarcastic reaction to the idea of actually having a revolution, yet it also embraces the idea.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Azerrad213_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Azerrad213" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>

Cross cites the line &#34;She&#39;s over-bored and self-assured&#34; and states the song &#34;could not have been about anyone else.&#34; Cross backs up his argument with lyrics which were present in earlier drafts, such as &#34;Who will be the King &#38; Queen of the outcasted [sic] teens.&#34;<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cobain has said, &#34;The entire song is made up of contradictory ideas [. . .] It&#39;s just making fun of the thought of having a revolution. But it&#39;s a nice thought.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Azerrad213_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Azerrad213" title="">[42]</a></sup> Drummer Dave Grohl has stated he does not believe the song has any message, and said, &#34;Just seeing Kurt write the lyrics to a song five minutes before he first sings them, you just kind of find it a little bit hard to believe that the song has a lot to say about something. You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes.&#34;<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">A screenshot from the music video</div></div>

The music video for &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; was the first for director <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Bayer" id="w">Samuel Bayer</a>, who would go on to direct videos for artists including <a href="/wiki/Green_Day" id="w">Green Day</a>, <a href="/wiki/Metallica" id="w">Metallica</a>, and <a href="/wiki/The_Smashing_Pumpkins" id="w">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>. Bayer believes he was hired because his test reel was so poor the band anticipated his production would be &#34;punk&#34; and &#34;not corporate.&#34;<sup id="_ref-classicalbums_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-classicalbums" title="">[14]</a></sup> The video was based on the concept of a school concert which ends in <a href="/wiki/Anarchy" id="w">anarchy</a> and riot. Inspiration was taken from <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Kaplan" id="w">Jonathan Kaplan</a>&#39;s 1979 movie <i><a href="/wiki/Over_the_Edge_(film)" id="w">Over the Edge</a></i>, as well as the <a href="/wiki/Ramones" id="w">Ramones</a> film <i><a href="/wiki/Rock_%26%2339%3Bn%26%2339%3B_Roll_High_School" id="w">Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll High School</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-classicalbums_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-classicalbums" title="">[14]</a></sup> Filmed on a soundstage in <a href="/wiki/Culver_City" id="w">Culver City</a>, the video featured the band playing at a <a href="/wiki/Pep_rally" id="w">pep rally</a> in a high school gym to an audience of apathetic students on bleachers, and cheerleaders wearing black dresses with the <a href="/wiki/Anarchist_symbolism#Circle-A" id="w">Circle-A</a> anarchist symbol. The video ends with the assembled students destroying the set and the band&#39;s gear. The demolition of the set captured in the video&#39;s conclusion was the result of genuine discontent. The extras that filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated through numerous replays of the song for an entire afternoon of filming. Cobain convinced Bayer to allow the extras to <a href="/wiki/Moshing" id="w">mosh</a>, and the set became a scene of chaos. &#34;Once the kids came out dancing they just said &#39;fuck you,&#39; because they were so tired of this shit throughout the day,&#34; Cobain said.<sup id="_ref-Azerrad19091_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Azerrad19091" title="">[46]</a></sup> Cobain disliked Bayer&#39;s final edit and personally oversaw a re-edit of the video that resulted in the version finally aired.<sup id="_ref-qpg54_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-qpg54" title="">[23]</a></sup> One of Cobain&#39;s major additions was the next-to-last shot of the video, which was a close-up of his own face after it had been obscured for most of the video.<sup id="_ref-Azerrad19091_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Azerrad19091" title="">[46]</a></sup> Bayer noted that unlike subsequent artists he worked with, Cobain did not care about vanity, rather that &#34;the video had something that was truly about what they were about.&#34;<sup id="_ref-classicalbums_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-classicalbums" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Like the song itself, the music video for &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; was well received by critics. <i>Rolling Stone</i> writer <a href="/wiki/David_Fricke" id="w">David Fricke</a> described the video as looking like &#34;the greatest gig you could ever imagine.&#34;<sup id="_ref-classicalbums_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-classicalbums" title="">[14]</a></sup> In addition to a number one placing in the singles category, &#34;Teen Spirit&#34; also topped the music video category in the <i>Village Voice<b>s 1991 &#34;Pazz &#38; Jop&#34; poll.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> The video won Nirvana the &#34;Best New Artist&#34; and &#34;Best Alternative Group&#34; awards at the 1992 <a href="/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Awards" id="w">MTV Video Music Awards</a>,<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> and in 2000 the <i><a href="/wiki/Guinness_World_Records" id="w">Guinness World Records</a></i> named &#34;Teen Spirit&#34; the Most Played Video on <a href="/wiki/MTV_Europe" id="w">MTV Europe</a>.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> In subsequent years Amy Finnerty, formerly of MTV&#39;s Programming department, claimed the video &#34;changed the entire look of MTV&#34; by giving them &#34;a whole new generation to sell to.&#34;<sup id="_ref-classicalbums_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-classicalbums" title="">[14]</a></sup> VH1 placed the debut of the &#34;Teen Spirit&#34; video at number eighteen on its list of &#34;100 Greatest Rock &#38; Roll Moments on TV,&#34; noting that &#34;the video [ushered] in alternative rock as a commercial and pop culture force.&#34;<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> In 2001, VH1 ranked the video fourth on its &#34;100 Greatest Videos&#34; list.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> The video has been parodied at least twice: in <a href="/wiki/&amp;quot%3BWeird_Al%26quot%3B_Yankovic" id="w">&#34;Weird Al&#34; Yankovic</a>&#39;s music video for &#34;<a href="/wiki/Smells_Like_Nirvana" id="w">Smells Like Nirvana</a>&#34; and in <a href="/wiki/Bob_Sinclar" id="w">Bob Sinclar</a>&#39;s 2006 music video for &#34;<a href="/wiki/Rock_This_Party_(Everybody_Dance_Now)" id="w">Rock This Party (Everybody Dance Now)</a>.&#34;</b></i></p>

&#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; was first performed live on <a href="/wiki/April_17" id="w">April 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a> at the <a href="/wiki/OK_Hotel" id="w">OK Hotel</a> in <a href="/wiki/Seattle%2C_Washington" id="w">Seattle, Washington</a>.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 boxset <i><a href="/wiki/With_the_Lights_Out" id="w">With the Lights Out</a>,</i> while shorter clips are included on the <i><a href="/wiki/Nevermind" id="w">Nevermind</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Classic_Albums" id="w">Classic Albums</a> DVD, as well as the documentary film <i><a href="/wiki/Hype!" id="w">Hype!</a></i>. As the song&#39;s lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with &#34;Come out and play, make up the rules&#34; instead of the eventual opening of &#34;Load up on guns, bring your friends.&#34; A recording of the earlier version appears on <i>With the Lights Out</i> and again on <i><a href="/wiki/Sliver:_The_Best_of_the_Box" id="w">Sliver: The Best of the Box</a></i>. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary <i><a href="/wiki/1991:_The_Year_Punk_Broke" id="w">1991: The Year Punk Broke</a></i>, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> with <a href="/wiki/Sonic_Youth" id="w">Sonic Youth</a>.</p>
<p>Nirvana often altered the song&#39;s lyrics and <a href="/wiki/Tempo" id="w">tempo</a> for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line &#34;our little group has always been&#34; changed to &#34;our little tribe has always been,&#34; which can be heard on the 1996 live album <i><a href="/wiki/From_the_Muddy_Banks_of_the_Wishkah" id="w">From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah</a></i>. <i>Rolling Stone</i> remarked that the <i>Wishkah</i> version of &#34;Teen Spirit&#34; &#34;[found] Cobain&#39;s guitar reeling outside the song&#39;s melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit.&#34;<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> A notable alternate performance of &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; occurred on <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops" id="w">Top of the Pops</a></i> in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the prerecorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, &#34;Load up on guns, bring your friends&#34; became &#34;Load up on drugs, kill your friends&#34;). Cobain would later claim he was trying to sound like former <a href="/wiki/The_Smiths" id="w">Smiths</a> frontman <a href="/wiki/Morrissey" id="w">Morrissey</a>.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Observer" id="w">The Observer</a></i> stated Nirvana&#39;s performance was responsible for &#34;Teen Spirit&#34; entering the UK top ten the following week;<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> when <i>Top of the Pops</i> was cancelled in 2006, <i>The Observer</i> listed Nirvana&#39;s performance of &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; as the third greatest in the show&#39;s history.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> This performance can be found on the 1994 home video <i><a href="/wiki/Live!_Tonight!_Sold_Out!!" id="w">Live!

<p>In addition to cover versions, &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; has also inspired a few <a href="/wiki/Parody" id="w">parodies</a>. &#34;Weird Al&#34; Yankovic parodied the song in 1992 with &#34;Smells Like Nirvana,&#34; a song about Nirvana itself.

<p>The single edit of &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&#34; which was featured in the music video, removes approximately thirty seconds from the album version. In particular, two repetitions of the main riff have been removed from the beginning of the song, as has the repeat of the first section of the guitar solo. Additionally, the CD single falsely lists the length of &#34;Even in His Youth&#34; as 4:20.</p>
