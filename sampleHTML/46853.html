{{South Asian history}}
The <b>Indus Valley Civilization</b> (c. 3300&#8211;1700 BCE, flourished 2600&#8211;1900 BCE), abbreviated <b>IVC</b>, was an ancient  <a href="/wiki/Civilization" id="w">civilization</a> that flourished in the <a href="/wiki/Indus_River" id="w">Indus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ghaggar-Hakra_River" id="w">Ghaggar-Hakra</a> river valleys primarily in what is now <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a> and western <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_India" id="w">India</a>, extending westward into <a href="/wiki/Balochistan" id="w">Balochistan</a>. The mature phase of this civilization is known as the <b>Harappan Civilization</b>, after the first of its cities to be excavated, <a href="/wiki/Harappa" id="w">Harappa</a>.
Excavation of IVC sites has been ongoing since the <a href="/wiki/1920s" id="w">1920s</a>.</p>
<p>The civilization is sometimes referred to as the <b>Indus Ghaggar-Hakra civilization</b><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> or the <b>Indus-Saraswati civilization</b>. The appellation <i>Indus-Saraswati</i> is based on the possible identification of the Ghaggar-Hakra River with the  <a href="/wiki/Sarasvati_River" id="w">Sarasvati River</a> mentioned in the <a href="/wiki/Rig_Veda" id="w">Rig Veda</a>,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> but this usage is disputed.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>

<p>The mature (Harappan) phase of the IVC is contemporary to the <a href="/wiki/Early_Bronze_Age" id="w">Early</a> to <a href="/wiki/Middle_Bronze_Age" id="w">Middle Bronze Age</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Near_East" id="w">Ancient Near East</a>, in particular the <a href="/wiki/Old_Elamite_period" id="w">Old Elamite period</a>, <a href="/wiki/Early_Dynastic_Period_of_Sumer" id="w">Early Dynastic</a> to <a href="/wiki/Third_Dynasty_of_Ur" id="w">Ur III</a> <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" id="w">Mesopotamia</a>, Prepalatial <a href="/wiki/Minoan_Crete" id="w">Minoan Crete</a> and <a href="/wiki/Old_Kingdom" id="w">Old Kingdom</a> to <a href="/wiki/First_Intermediate_Period_of_Egypt" id="w">First Intermediate Period</a> <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">Egypt</a>.</p>
<p>The IVC has been tentatively identified with the toponym <a href="/wiki/Meluhha" id="w">Meluhha</a> known from Sumerian records. It has been compared in particular with the civilizations of <a href="/wiki/Elam" id="w">Elam</a> (also in the context of the <a href="/wiki/Elamo-Dravidian" id="w">Elamo-Dravidian</a> hypothesis), and with <a href="/wiki/Minoan_Crete" id="w">Minoan Crete</a> (because of cultural parallels such as <a href="/wiki/Goddess_worship" id="w">goddess worship</a> and depictions of <a href="/wiki/Bull-leaping" id="w">bull-leaping</a>)<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>

<a id="Discovery_and_excavation" name="Discovery_and_excavation"></a><h1>Discovery and excavation</h1>
<p>The ruins of <a href="/wiki/Harappa" id="w">Harappa</a> were first described in 1842 by Charles Masson in his <i>Narrative of Various Journeys in Baluchistan, Afghanistan and the Panjab</i>, where locals talked of an ancient city extending &#34;thirteen <a href="/wiki/Kos_(measure)" id="w">cosses</a>&#34; (about 25 miles), but no archaeological interest would attach to this for nearly a century.<sup id="_ref-masson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-masson" title="">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1856" id="w">1856</a>, British engineers John and William Brunton were laying the <a href="/wiki/History_of_rail_transport_in_India" id="w">East Indian Railway Company</a> line connecting <a href="/wiki/Karachi" id="w">Karachi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lahore" id="w">Lahore</a>.  John wrote: &#34;I was much exercised in my mind how we were to get ballast for the line of the railway.&#34;  They were told of an ancient ruined city near the lines, called Brahminabad.  Visiting the city, he found it full of hard well-burnt bricks; and &#34;convinced that there was a grand quarry for the ballast I wanted&#34;,  the city of Brahminabad was reduced to ballast.<sup id="_ref-davreau_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-davreau" title="">[9]</a></sup>.  A few months later, further north, John&#39;s brother William Brunton&#39;s &#34;section of the line ran near another ruined city,
bricks from which had already been used by villagers in the nearby
village of Harappa at the same site.  These bricks now provided ballast along 93 miles of the railroad
track running from Karachi to Lahore.&#34; <sup id="_ref-davreau_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-davreau" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was more than half a century later, in <a href="/wiki/1912" id="w">1912</a>, that Harappan seals—with the then unknown symbols—were discovered by J. Fleet, prompting an excavation campaign under <a href="/wiki/John_Marshall_(archaeologist)" id="w">Sir John Hubert Marshall</a> in 1921/22, and resulting in the discovery of the hitherto unknown civilization at Harappa by Sir John Marshall, Rai Bahadur Daya Ram Sahni and Madho Sarup Vats, and at <a href="/wiki/Mohenjo-daro" id="w">Mohenjo-daro</a> by Rakhal Das Banerjee, E. J. H. MacKay, and Sir John Marshall. By <a href="/wiki/1931" id="w">1931</a>, much of Mohenjo-Daro had been excavated, but excavations continued, such as that led by <a href="/wiki/Mortimer_Wheeler" id="w">Sir Mortimer Wheeler</a>, director of the <a href="/wiki/Archaeological_Survey_of_India" id="w">Archaeological Survey of India</a> in <a href="/wiki/1944" id="w">1944</a>. Among other archaeologists who worked on IVC sites before the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 were <a href="/wiki/Ahmad_Hasan_Dani" id="w">Ahmad Hasan Dani</a>, <a href="/wiki/B._B._Lal" id="w">Brij Basi Lal</a>, Nani Gopal Majumdar, and <a href="/wiki/Aurel_Stein" id="w">Aurel Stein</a>.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/British_Raj" id="w">partition of British India</a>, the area of the IVC was divided between <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a> and <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>, and excavations from this time include those led by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in <a href="/wiki/1949" id="w">1949</a>, archaeological adviser to the Government of Pakistan.  Outposts of the Indus Valley civilization were excavated as far west as <a href="/wiki/Sutkagan_Dor" id="w">Sutkagan Dor</a> in <a href="/wiki/Balochistan_(Pakistan)" id="w">Baluchistan</a>, as far north as the <a href="/wiki/Oxus_river" id="w">Oxus river</a> in current <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a>.</p>

<p>The mature phase of the Harappan civilization lasted from c. 2600 BC to 1900 BC. With the inclusion of the predecessor and successor cultures — Early Harappan and Late Harappan, respectively — the entire Indus Valley Civilization may be taken to have lasted from the 33rd to the 14th centuries BC.
Two terms are employed for the <i>periodization</i> of the IVC: <i>Phases</i> and <i>Eras</i>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The Early Harappan, Mature Harappan, and Late Harappan <i>phases</i> are also called the &#34;Regionalisation,&#34; &#34;Integration,&#34; and &#34;Localisation&#34; <i>eras</i>, respectively, with the Regionalization era reaching back to the Neolithic <a href="/wiki/Mehrgarh" id="w">Mehrgarh</a> II period. &#34;Discoveries at Mehrgarh changed the entire concept of the Indus civilization,&#34; according to <a href="/wiki/Ahmad_Hasan_Dani" id="w">Ahmad Hasan Dani</a>, professor emeritus at <a href="/wiki/Quaid-e-Azam_University" id="w">Quaid-e-Azam University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Islamabad" id="w">Islamabad</a>, &#34;There we have the whole sequence, right from the beginning of settled village life.&#34;<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>There is evidence of dry river beds overlapping with the <a href="/wiki/Hakra" id="w">Hakra</a> channel in <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a> and the seasonal <a href="/wiki/Ghaggar_River" id="w">Ghaggar River</a> in <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>. Many Indus Valley (or <i>Harappan</i>) sites have been discovered along the Ghaggar-Hakra beds.<sup id="_ref-possehl_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-possehl" title="">[22]</a></sup> Among them are: Rupar, <a href="/wiki/Rakhigarhi" id="w">Rakhigarhi</a>, Sothi, <a href="/wiki/Kalibangan" id="w">Kalibangan</a>, and Ganwariwala.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> According to J.

<p>According to some archaeologists over 500 Harappan sites have been discovered along the dried up river beds of the Ghaggar-Hakra River and its tributaries,<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> in contrast to only about 100 along the <a href="/wiki/Indus_River" id="w">Indus</a> and its tributaries,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> consequently, in their opinion, the appellation <i>Indus Ghaggar-Hakra civilisation</i> or <a href="/wiki/Sindhi_Civilization" id="w">&#39;&#39;Indus-Saraswati civilisation&#39;&#39;</a> is justified. However, these arguments are disputed by other archaeologists who state that the Ghaggar-Hakra desert area has been left untouched by settlements and agriculture since the end of the Indus period and hence shows more sites than found in the alluvium of the Indus valley; second, that the number of Harappan sites along the Ghaggar-Hakra river beds have been exaggerated and that the Ghaggar-Hakra, when it existed, was a tributary of the Indus, so the new nomenclature is redundant.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Early_Harappan" name="Early_Harappan"></a><h1>Early Harappan</h1>
<p>The Early Harappan Ravi Phase, named after the nearby <a href="/wiki/Ravi_River" id="w">Ravi River</a>, lasted from circa 3300 BC until 2800 BC. It is related to the Hakra Phase, identified in the Ghaggar-Hakra River Valley to the west, and predates the <a href="/wiki/Kot_Diji" id="w">Kot Diji</a> Phase (2800-2600 BC, Harappan 2), named after a site in northern <a href="/wiki/Sindh" id="w">Sindh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a>, near <a href="/wiki/Mohenjo_Daro" id="w">Mohenjo Daro</a>.

<p>The mature phase of earlier village cultures is represented by <a href="/wiki/Rehman_Dheri" id="w">Rehman Dheri</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amri" id="w">Amri</a> in Pakistan.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Kot_Diji" id="w">Kot Diji</a> (Harappan 2) represents the phase leading up to Mature Harappan, with the citadel representing centralised authority and an increasingly urban quality of life. Another town of this stage was found at <a href="/wiki/Kalibangan" id="w">Kalibangan</a> in India on the Hakra River.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Trade networks linked this culture with related regional cultures and distant sources of raw materials, including <a href="/wiki/Lapis_lazuli" id="w">lapis lazuli</a> and other materials for bead-making.

<a id="Mature_Harappan" name="Mature_Harappan"></a><h1>Mature Harappan</h1>
<p>By 2600 BC, the Early Harappan communities had been turned into large urban centers. Such urban centers include <a href="/wiki/Harappa" id="w">Harappa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mohenjo_Daro" id="w">Mohenjo Daro</a> in Pakistan and <a href="/wiki/Lothal" id="w">Lothal</a> in India. In total, over 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Ghaggar and Indus Rivers and their tributaries.</p>
<p>By <a href="/wiki/2500_BC" id="w">2500 BC</a>, irrigation had transformed the region. {{Fact}}</p>
<a id="Cities" name="Cities"></a><h2>Cities</h2>
<p>A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture is evident in the Indus Valley Civilization. The quality of <a href="/wiki/Municipal" id="w">municipal</a> town planning suggests knowledge of <a href="/wiki/Urban_planning" id="w">urban planning</a> and efficient <a href="/wiki/Municipal_government" id="w">municipal governments</a> which placed a high priority on <a href="/wiki/Hygiene" id="w">hygiene</a>. The streets of major cities such as <a href="/wiki/Mohenjo-daro" id="w">Mohenjo-daro</a> or <a href="/wiki/Harappa" id="w">Harappa</a> were laid out in perfect <a href="/wiki/Grid_plan" id="w">grid patterns</a>. The houses were protected from noise, odors, and thieves.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>As seen in Harappa, Mohenjo-daro and the recently discovered <a href="/wiki/Rakhigarhi" id="w">Rakhigarhi</a>, this urban plan included the world&#39;s first urban <a href="/wiki/Sanitation" id="w">sanitation</a> systems. Within the city, individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from <a href="/wiki/Water_well" id="w">wells</a>. From a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing, <a href="/wiki/Wastewater" id="w">waste water</a> was directed to covered drains, which lined the major streets. Houses opened only to inner <a href="/wiki/Courtyard" id="w">courtyards</a> and smaller lanes. The house-building in some villages in the region still resembles in some respects the house-building of the Harappans.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ancient Indus systems of <a href="/wiki/Sewerage" id="w">sewerage</a> and <a href="/wiki/Drainage" id="w">drainage</a> that were developed and used in cities throughout the Indus region were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" id="w">Middle East</a> and even more efficient than those in some areas of <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a> and <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a> today. The advanced architecture of the Harappans is shown by their impressive <a href="/wiki/Dockyard" id="w">dockyards</a>, <a href="/wiki/Granary" id="w">granaries</a>, <a href="/wiki/Warehouse" id="w">warehouses</a>, brick platforms and protective walls. The massive <a href="/wiki/Citadel" id="w">citadels</a> of Indus cities, which protected the Harappans from floods and attackers, were larger than most <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamian" id="w">Mesopotamian</a> <a href="/wiki/Ziggurat" id="w">ziggurats</a>.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>The purpose of the citadel remains debated. In sharp contrast to this civilization&#39;s contemporaries, <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" id="w">Mesopotamia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">Ancient Egypt</a>, no large monumental structures were built. There is no conclusive evidence of palaces or temples - or of kings, armies, or priests. Some structures are thought to have been granaries. Found at one city is an enormous well-built bath, which may have been a public bath. Although the citadels were walled, it is far from clear that these structures were defensive. They may have been built to divert flood waters.</p>
<p>Most city dwellers appear to have been <a href="/wiki/Traders" id="w">traders</a> or <a href="/wiki/Artisans" id="w">artisans</a>, who lived with others pursuing the same occupation in well-defined neighborhoods. Materials from distant regions were used in the cities for constructing seals, <a href="/wiki/Beads" id="w">beads</a> and other objects. Among the <a href="/wiki/Artifact_(archaeology)" id="w">artifacts</a> discovered were beautiful beads of glazed stone called <a href="/wiki/Fa%C3%AFence" id="w">faïence</a>. The seals have images of animals, gods and other types of inscriptions. Some of the seals were used to stamp clay on trade goods and most probably had other uses. </p>
<p>Although some houses were larger than others, Indus Civilization cities were remarkable for their apparent <a href="/wiki/Egalitarianism" id="w">egalitarianism</a>. All the houses had access to <a href="/wiki/Water" id="w">water</a> and <a href="/wiki/Drainage" id="w">drainage</a> facilities. This gives the impression of a society with low wealth concentration.</p>

<p>The people of the Indus Civilization achieved great accuracy in measuring length, mass and time. They were among the first to develop a system of uniform weights and measures. Their measurements were extremely precise. Their smallest division, which is marked on an ivory scale found in <a href="/wiki/Lothal" id="w">Lothal</a>, was approximately 1.704&#160;<a href="/wiki/Millimeter" id="w">mm</a>, the smallest division ever recorded on a scale of the <a href="/wiki/Bronze_Age" id="w">Bronze Age</a>. Harappan engineers followed the decimal division of measurement for all practical purposes, including the measurement of mass as revealed by their <a href="/wiki/Hexahedron" id="w">hexahedron</a> weights. </p>
<p>These brick weights were in a perfect ratio of 4:2:1 with weights of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 units, with each unit weighing approximately 28 grams, similar to the English <a href="/wiki/Imperial_units#Measures of weight and mass" id="w">Imperial ounce</a> or Greek uncia, and smaller objects were weighed in similar ratios with the units of 0.871.

Eleven drilled molar crowns from nine adults were discovered in a Neolithic graveyard in Mehrgarh that dates from 7,500-9,000 years ago.

<p>The Indus civilization&#39;s economy appears to have depended significantly on <a href="/wiki/Trade" id="w">trade</a>, which was facilitated by major advances in transport technology. These advances included <a href="/wiki/Bullock_cart" id="w">bullock carts</a> that are identical to those seen throughout South Asia today, as well as boats. Most of these boats were probably small, flat-bottomed craft, perhaps driven by sail, similar to those one can see on the Indus River today; however, there is secondary evidence of sea-going craft. Archaeologists have discovered a massive, dredged canal and docking facility at the coastal city of <a href="/wiki/Lothal" id="w">Lothal</a>.</p>
<p>During 4300 - 3200 BC of the <a href="/wiki/Chalcolithic" id="w">chalcolithic</a> period (copper age), the Indus Valley Civilization area shows ceramic similarities with southern <a href="/wiki/Turkmenistan" id="w">Turkmenistan</a> and northern <a href="/wiki/Iran" id="w">Iran</a> which suggest considerable mobility and trade. During the Early Harappan period (about 3200–2600 BC), similarities in pottery, seals, figurines, ornaments etc. document intensive caravan trade with <a href="/wiki/Central_Asia" id="w">Central Asia</a> and the Iranian plateau.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Judging from the dispersal of Indus civilisation artifacts, the trade networks, economically, integrated a huge area, including portions of <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a>, the coastal regions of <a href="/wiki/Iran" id="w">Persia</a>, northern and central India, and <a href="/wiki/Mesopotamia" id="w">Mesopotamia</a>.</p>
<p>There was an extensive maritime trade network operating between the Harappan and Mesopotamian civilisations as early as the middle Harappan Phase, with much commerce being handled by &#34;middlemen merchants from Dilmun&#34; (modern <a href="/wiki/Bahrain" id="w">Bahrain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Failaka" id="w">Failaka</a> located in the <a href="/wiki/Persian_Gulf" id="w">Persian Gulf</a>).<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> Such long-distance sea-trade became feasible with the innovative development of plank-built watercraft, equipped with a single central mast supporting a sail of woven rushes or cloth.</p>
<p>Several coastal settlements like Sotkagen-dor (astride Dasht River, north of Jiwani), <a href="/wiki/Sokhta_Koh" id="w">Sokhta Koh</a> (astride Shadi River, north of <a href="/wiki/Pasni_City" id="w">Pasni</a>) and Balakot (near Sonmiani) in Pakistan along with Lothal in India testify to their role as Harappan trading outposts. Shallow harbors located at the estuary of rivers opening into the sea allowed brisk maritime trade with Mesopotamian cities.</p>
<a id="Agriculture" name="Agriculture"></a><h2>Agriculture</h2>
<p>Post 1980 studies indicate that food production was largely indigenous to the Indus Valley. It is known that the people of <a href="/wiki/Mehrgarh" id="w">Mehrgarh</a> used domesticated <a href="/wiki/Wheat" id="w">wheats</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barley" id="w">barley</a><sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> and the major cultivated cereal crop was naked six-row barley, a crop derived from two-row barley (see Shaffer and Liechtenstein 1995, 1999). Archaeologist <a href="/wiki/Jim_G._Shaffer" id="w">Jim G. Shaffer</a> (1999: 245) writes that the Mehrgarh site &#34;demonstrates that food production was an indigenous South Asian phenomenon&#34; and that the data support interpretation of &#34;the prehistoric urbanization and complex social organization in South Asia as based on indigenous, but not isolated, cultural developments.&#34;</p>
<p>{{contradict}} 
{{POV}}
Indus civilization agriculture must have been highly productive; after all, it was capable of generating surpluses sufficient to support tens of thousands of urban residents who were not primarily engaged in agriculture. It relied on the considerable technological achievements of the pre-Harappan culture, including the <a href="/wiki/Plough" id="w">plough</a>. Still, very little is known about the farmers who supported the cities or their agricultural methods. Some of them undoubtedly made use of the fertile <a href="/wiki/Alluvial" id="w">alluvial</a> soil left by rivers after the flood season, but this simple method of agriculture is not thought to be productive enough to support cities. There is no evidence of irrigation, but such evidence could have been obliterated by repeated, catastrophic floods.{{Facts}}</p>
<p>The Indus civilization appears to contradict the <a href="/wiki/Hydraulic_despotism" id="w">hydraulic despotism</a> hypothesis of the origin of urban civilization and the <a href="/wiki/State" id="w">state</a>. According to this hypothesis, all early, large-scale civilizations arose as a by-product of irrigation systems capable of generating massive <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" id="w">agricultural</a> surpluses. {{Facts}}</p>
<p>It is often assumed that intensive agricultural production requires <a href="/wiki/Dam" id="w">dams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Canal" id="w">canals</a>. This assumption is easily refuted. Throughout Asia, rice farmers produce significant agricultural surpluses from terraced, hillside <a href="/wiki/Rice_paddy" id="w">rice paddies</a>, which result not from slavery but rather the accumulated labor of many generations of people. Instead of building canals, Indus civilization people may have built water diversion schemes, which—like <a href="/wiki/Terrace_agriculture" id="w">terrace agriculture</a>—can be elaborated by generations of small-scale labor investments. It should be noted that only the easternmost section of the Indus Civilisation people could build their lives around the <a href="/wiki/Monsoon" id="w">monsoon</a>, a weather pattern in which the bulk of a year&#39;s rainfall occurs in a four-month period; others had to depend on the seasonal flooding of rivers caused by snow melt at high elevations.{{Facts}}</p>

Well over 400 distinct Indus symbols have been found on <a href="/wiki/Seal_(device)" id="w">seals</a> or ceramic pots and over a dozen other materials, including a &#34;signboard&#34; that apparently once hung over the gate of the inner citadel of the Indus city of Dholavira. Typical <a href="/wiki/Indus_inscriptions" id="w">Indus inscriptions</a> are no more than four or five characters in length, most of which (aside from the Dholavira &#34;signboard&#34;) are exquisitely tiny; the longest on a single surface, which is less than 1 inch (2.54 cm) square, is 17 signs long; the longest on any object (found on three different faces of a mass-produced object) has a length of 26 symbols.</p>
<p>While the Indus Valley Civilization is often characterized as a &#34;literate society&#34; on the evidence of these inscriptions, this description has been challenged on linguistic and archaeological grounds: it has been pointed out that the brevity of the inscriptions is unparalleled in any known premodern literate society. Based partly on this evidence, a controversial paper by Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel (2004)<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> argues that the Indus system did not encode language, but was instead similar to a variety of non-linguistic sign systems used extensively in the Near East and other societies. It has also been claimed on occasion that the symbols were exclusively used for economic transactions, but this claim leaves unexplained the appearance of Indus symbols on many ritual objects, many of which were mass produced in <a href="/wiki/Molding_(process)" id="w">molds</a>. No parallels to these mass-produced inscriptions are known in any other early ancient civilizations.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

Photos of many of the thousands of extant inscriptions are published in the <i>Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions</i> (1987, 1991), edited by A. Parpola and his colleagues. Publication of a final third volume, which will reportedly republish photos taken in the 1920s and 1930s of hundreds of lost or stolen inscriptions, along with many discovered in the last few decades, has been announced for several years, but has not yet found its way into print. For now, researchers must supplement the materials in the <i>Corpus</i> by study of the tiny photos in the excavation reports of Marshall (1931), Mackay (1938, 1943), Wheeler (1947), or reproductions in more recent scattered sources.</p>

In view of the large number of figurines found in the Indus valley, it has been suggested that the Harappan people worshipped a <a href="/wiki/Mother_goddess" id="w">Mother goddess</a> symbolizing fertility; however, this interpretation is not unanimously accepted. Some Indus valley seals show <a href="/wiki/Swastika" id="w">swastikas</a> which are found in other later religions and mythologies. In the earlier phases of their culture, the Harappans buried their dead; however, later, especially in the cemetery H culture of the late Harrapan period, they also cremated their dead and buried the ashes in burial urns. Many Indus valley seals show animals; for example, a seal showing a figure seated in a <a href="/wiki/Yoga" id="w">yoga</a>-like posture and surrounded by animals has been compared to the &#34;lord of creatures,&#34; <a href="/wiki/Pashupati" id="w">Pashupati</a>.</p>
<a id="Late_Harappan" name="Late_Harappan"></a><h1>Late Harappan</h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>Around <a href="/wiki/19th_century_BC" id="w">1800 BC</a>, signs of a gradual decline began to emerge, and by around <a href="/wiki/18th_century_BC" id="w">1700 BC</a>, most of the cities were abandoned. However, the Indus Valley Civilization did not disappear suddenly, and many elements of the Indus Civilization can be found in later cultures. Current archaeological data suggests that material culture classified as Late Harappan may have persisted until at least c. 1000-900 BC, and was partially contemporaneous with the <a href="/wiki/Painted_Grey_Ware" id="w">Painted Grey Ware</a> and perhaps early NBP cultures.<sup id="_ref-Spodek_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Spodek" title="">[42]</a></sup> Archaeologists have emphasised that just as in most areas of the world,  there was a continuous series of cultural developments.

<p>A possible natural reason for the IVC&#39;s decline is connected with <a href="/wiki/Climate_change" id="w">climate change</a>: The Indus valley climate grew significantly cooler and drier from about 1800 BC, linked to a general weaking of the <a href="/wiki/Monsoon" id="w">monsoon</a> at that time. Alternatively, a crucial factor may have been the disappearance of substantial portions of the <a href="/wiki/Ghaggar_Hakra_river" id="w">Ghaggar Hakra river</a> system. A <a href="/wiki/Tectonic" id="w">tectonic</a> event may have diverted the system&#39;s sources toward the <a href="/wiki/Ganges_Plain" id="w">Ganges Plain</a>, though there is some uncertainty about the date of this event. Although this particular factor is speculative, and not generally accepted, the decline of the IVC, as with any other civilization, will have been due to a combination of various reasons.{{Fact}} New geological research is now being conducted by a group lead by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Clift" id="w">Peter Clift</a>, from <a href="/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen" id="w">University of Aberdeen</a> to investiagte how the courses of rivers have changed in this region since 8000 years ago in order to test whether climate or river reorganizations are responsible for the decline of the Harappan.</p>

<p>{{cleanup-merge}}
In the course of the <a href="/wiki/2nd_millennium_BC" id="w">2nd millennium BC</a>, remnants of the IVC&#39;s culture (the so-called <a href="/wiki/Cemetery_H" id="w">Cemetery H</a> culture) would amalgamate with those of <a href="/wiki/Indo-Aryans" id="w">Indo-Aryan</a> peoples according to Indo Aryan Invasion or Migration theory, likely contributing to what eventually resulted in the rise of <a href="/wiki/Vedic_culture" id="w">Vedic culture</a> and eventually historical <a href="/wiki/Hinduism" id="w">Hinduism</a>. Judging from the abundant figurines, which may depict female fertility, that they left behind, some assume that IVC people worshipped a <a href="/wiki/Mother_goddess" id="w">Mother goddess</a> (compare <a href="/wiki/Shakti" id="w">Shakti</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kali" id="w">Kali</a>, several thousands years later). However, there is no firm agreement among experts as to whether or not these figurines actually depict female fertility, or if they depict something else. IVC seals depict animals, perhaps as the objects of veneration, comparable to the zoomorphic aspects of some Hindu gods. Seals that some think resemble <a href="/wiki/Pashupati" id="w">Pashupati</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Yoga" id="w">yogic</a> posture have also been discovered. </p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Indus Civilization&#39;s collapse, regional cultures emerged, to varying degrees showing the influence of the Indus Civilization. In the formerly great city of Harappa, burials have been found that correspond to a regional culture called the <a href="/wiki/Cemetery_H_culture" id="w">Cemetery H culture</a>. At the same time, the <a href="/wiki/Ochre_Coloured_Pottery_culture" id="w">Ochre Coloured Pottery culture</a> expanded from <a href="/wiki/Rajasthan" id="w">Rajasthan</a> into the <a href="/wiki/Gangetic_Plain" id="w">Gangetic Plain</a>.
