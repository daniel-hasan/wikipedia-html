<p><b>Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, marquis de Condorcet</b> (<a href="/wiki/September_17" id="w">September 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1743" id="w">1743</a> – <a href="/wiki/March_28" id="w">March 28</a>, <a href="/wiki/1794" id="w">1794</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> <a href="/wiki/Philosopher" id="w">philosopher</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" id="w">mathematician</a>, and early <a href="/wiki/Political_science" id="w">political scientist</a> who devised the concept of a <i><a href="/wiki/Condorcet_method" id="w">Condorcet method</a></i>. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he advocated a <a href="/wiki/Liberalism" id="w">liberal economy</a>, free and equal <a href="/wiki/Public_education" id="w">public education</a>, <a href="/wiki/Constitutionalism" id="w">constitutionalism</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Social_equality" id="w">equal rights</a> for women and people of all races. His ideas and writings were said to embody the ideals of the <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" id="w">Age of Enlightenment</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rationalism" id="w">rationalism</a>, and remain influential to this day. He died a mysterious death in prison after a period of being a fugitive from French Revolutionary authorities.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h1>Early life</h1>
<p>Condorcet was born in <a href="/wiki/Ribemont" id="w">Ribemont</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aisne" id="w">Aisne</a>, and descended from the ancient family of Caritat, who took their title from the town of <a href="/wiki/Condorcet%2C_Dr%C3%B4me" id="w">Condorcet</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dauphin%C3%A9" id="w">Dauphiné</a>, of which they were long-time residents. Fatherless at a young age, he was raised by his devoutly religious mother. He was educated at the <a href="/wiki/Society_of_Jesus" id="w">Jesuit</a> College in <a href="/wiki/Reims" id="w">Reims</a> and at the <i><a href="/wiki/Coll%C3%A8ge_de_Navarre" id="w">Collège de Navarre</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a>, where he quickly showed his intellectual ability, and gained his first public distinctions in <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" id="w">mathematics</a>. When he was sixteen, his analytical abilities gained the praise of <a href="/wiki/Jean_le_Rond_d%26%2339%3BAlembert" id="w">Jean le Rond d&#39;Alembert</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alexis_Clairault" id="w">Alexis Clairault</a>; soon, Condorcet would study under d&#39;Alembert.</p>
<p>From 1765 to 1774, he focused on science. In 1765, he published his first work on mathematics entitled <i>Essai sur le calcul intégral</i>, which was very well received, launching his career as a respected mathematician. He would go on to publish many more papers, and on <a href="/wiki/February_25" id="w">February 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1769" id="w">1769</a>, he was elected to the <i><a href="/wiki/French_Academy_of_Sciences" id="w">Académie royale des Sciences</a></i> (French Royal Academy of Sciences).</p>
<p><div style="wigth:180px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:180px-Anne_Robert_Jacques_Turgot.jpg" title="Jacques Turgot was Condorcet&#39;s mentor and longtime friend"><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180px-Anne_Robert_Jacques_Turgot.jpg" alt="Jacques Turgot was Condorcet&#39;s mentor and longtime friend" title="Jacques Turgot was Condorcet&#39;s mentor and longtime friend" class="location-right type-thumb" width="180px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Jacques Turgot was Condorcet&#39;s mentor and longtime friend</div></div>

In 1772, he published another paper on <a href="/wiki/Integral_calculus" id="w">integral calculus</a> which was widely hailed as a groundbreaking paper in several domains. Soon after, he met <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Turgot" id="w">Jacques Turgot</a>, a French economist, and the two became friends. Turgot was to be an administrator under <a href="/wiki/King_of_France" id="w">King</a> <a href="/wiki/Louis_XV_of_France" id="w">Louis XV</a> in 1772, and later became <a href="/wiki/List_of_Finance_Ministers_of_France" id="w">Controller-General of Finance</a> under <a href="/wiki/Louis_XVI_of_France" id="w">Louis XVI</a> (in 1774).</p>
<p>Condorcet was recognized worldwide and worked with such famous scientists as <a href="/wiki/Leonhard_Euler" id="w">Leonhard Euler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" id="w">Benjamin Franklin</a>. He soon became an honorary member of many foreign academies and philosophic societies notably in <a href="/wiki/List_of_states_in_the_Holy_Roman_Empire" id="w">Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Russia" id="w">Imperial Russia</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>.</p>
<a id="Early_political_career" name="Early_political_career"></a><h1>Early political career</h1>
<p>In 1774, Condorcet was appointed <a href="/wiki/Inspector_General" id="w">Inspector General</a> of the <i><a href="/wiki/Monnaie_de_Paris" id="w">Monnaie de Paris</a></i> by Turgot. From this point on, Condorcet shifted his focus from the purely mathematical to philosophy and political matters. In the following years, he took up
the defense of <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" id="w">human rights</a> in general, and of <a href="/wiki/Women%26%2339%3Bs_rights" id="w">women&#39;s</a> and <a href="/wiki/Black_(people)" id="w">Blacks&#39;</a> rights in particular (an <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism" id="w">abolitionist</a>, he became active in the <a href="/wiki/Society_of_the_Friends_of_the_Blacks" id="w">Society of the Friends of the Blacks</a> in the 1780s). He supported the ideals embodied by the newly formed United States, and proposed projects of political, administrative and economic reforms intended to transform France.</p>
<p>In 1776, Turgot was dismissed as Controller General. Consequently, Condorcet submitted his resignation as Inspector General of the <i>Monnaie</i>, but the request was refused, and he continued serving in this post until 1791. Condorcet later wrote <i>Vie de M. Turgot</i> (1786), a <a href="/wiki/Biography" id="w">biography</a> which spoke fondly of Turgot and advocated Turgot&#39;s economic theories. Condorcet continued to receive prestigious appointments: in 1777, he became Permanent Secretary of the <a href="/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_des_Sciences" id="w">Académie des Sciences</a>, holding the post until the abolition of the Académie in 1793, and in 1782 secretary of the <i><a href="/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_Fran%C3%A7aise" id="w">Académie Française</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Condorcet's_paradox" name="Condorcet's_paradox"></a><h1>Condorcet&#39;s paradox</h1>
<p>In 1785, Condorcet wrote the <i>Essay on the Application of Analysis to the Probability of Majority Decisions</i>, one of his most important works. In this, he explores &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/Voting_paradox" id="w">Condorcet&#39;s paradox</a></i>&#34;, which describes the <a href="/wiki/Intransitivity" id="w">intransitivity</a> of <a href="/wiki/Majority" id="w">majority</a> preference. The <a href="/wiki/Paradox" id="w">paradox</a> states that it is possible for a majority to prefer A over B, another majority to prefer B over C, and another majority to prefer C over A, all from the same
electorate and same set of <a href="/wiki/Ballot" id="w">ballots</a>. </p>
<p>The paper also outlines a generic <a href="/wiki/Condorcet_method" id="w">Condorcet method</a>, designed to simulate pair-wise elections between all candidates in an <a href="/wiki/Election" id="w">election</a>. He disagreed strongly with the alternative method of aggregating preferences put forth by <a href="/wiki/Jean-Charles_de_Borda" id="w">Jean-Charles de Borda</a> (based on <a href="/wiki/Summation" id="w">summed</a> <a href="/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics" id="w">rankings of alternatives</a>). Condorcet was one of the first to systematically apply mathematics in the <a href="/wiki/Social_sciences" id="w">social sciences</a>.</p>
<a id="Other_works" name="Other_works"></a><h1>Other works</h1>
<p>In 1786, Condorcet worked on ideas for the <a href="/wiki/Derivative" id="w">differential</a> and <a href="/wiki/Integral_calculus" id="w">integral calculus</a>, giving a new treatment of <a href="/wiki/Infinitesimal" id="w">infinitesimals</a> - a work which was never printed. In 1789, he published <i>Vie de Voltaire (1789)</i>, which agreed with <a href="/wiki/Voltaire" id="w">Voltaire</a> in his opposition to the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Church</a>. In 1798, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Malthus" id="w">Thomas Malthus</a> wrote an <i><a href="/wiki/Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population" id="w">Essay on the Principle of Population</a></i> partly in response to Condorcet&#39;s views on the &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/Perfection" id="w">perfectibility of society</a></i>&#34;. In 1781, Condorcet wrote a pamphlet, <i>Reflections on Negro Slavery</i>, in which he denounced <a href="/wiki/Slavery" id="w">slavery</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Condorcet                is also credited for first expressing <a href="/wiki/Condorcet%26%2339%3Bs_jury_theorem" id="w">Condorcet&#39;s jury theorem</a>. It states that if each member of a voting group is more likely than not to make a correct decision, the probability that the highest vote of the group is the correct decision increases as the number of members of the group increases.</p>
<a id="French_Revolution" name="French_Revolution"></a><h1>French Revolution</h1>
<a id="Deputy" name="Deputy"></a><h2>Deputy</h2>
<p>Condorcet took a leading role when the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" id="w">French Revolution</a> swept France in 1789, hoping for a <a href="/wiki/Rationalism" id="w">rationalist</a> reconstruction of society, and championed many <a href="/wiki/Liberalism" id="w">liberal causes</a>. As a result, in 1791 he was elected as a Paris representative in the <a href="/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_(France)" id="w">Assemblée</a>, and then became the secretary of the Assembly. The institution adopted Condorcet&#39;s design for state education system, and he drafted a proposed <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" id="w">Bourbon Constitution</a> for the new France. He advocated <a href="/wiki/Women%26%2339%3Bs_suffrage" id="w">women&#39;s suffrage</a> for the new government, writing an article for <i>Journal de la Société de 1789</i>, and by publishing <i>De l&#39;admission des femmes au droit de cité</i> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/book-sum/condorcet4.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/book-sum/condorcet4.html">(&#34;For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women&#34;)</a>in 1790.</p>
<p>There were two competing views on which direction France should go, embodied by two political parties: the moderate <a href="/wiki/Girondist" id="w">Girondists</a>, and the more radical <a href="/wiki/The_Mountain" id="w">Montagnards</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Maximilien_Robespierre" id="w">Maximilien Robespierre</a>, who favored purging France of its <a href="/wiki/House_of_Bourbon" id="w">royal</a> past (<i><a href="/wiki/Ancien_R%C3%A9gime" id="w">Ancien Régime</a></i>). Condorcet was quite independent, but still counted many friends in the Girondist party. He presided over the Assembly as the Girondist held the majority, until it was replaced by the <a href="/wiki/National_Convention" id="w">National Convention</a>, elected in order to design a new constitution (the <i><a href="/wiki/French_Constitution_of_1793" id="w">French Constitution of 1793</a></i>), and which abolished the monarchy in favor of the <a href="/wiki/First_French_Republic" id="w">French Republic</a> as a consequence of the <i><a href="/wiki/Flight_to_Varennes" id="w">Flight to Varennes</a></i>.</p>
<p>At the time of King Louis XVI&#39;s trial, the Girondists had, however, lost their majority in the Convention. Condorcet, who opposed the <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment" id="w">death penalty</a> but still supported the trial itself, spoke out against the execution of the King during the public vote at the Convention. From that moment on, he was usually considered a Girondist. The Montagnards were becoming more and more influential in the Convention as the King&#39;s &#34;betrayal&#34; was confirming their theories. One of them, <a href="/wiki/Marie-Jean_H%C3%A9rault_de_Seychelles" id="w">Marie-Jean Hérault de Seychelles</a>, a member, like Condorcet, of the Constitution&#39;s Commission, misrepresented many ideas from Condorcet&#39;s draft and presented what was called a <i>Montagnard Constitution</i>. Condorcet criticized the new work, and as a result, he was branded a <a href="/wiki/Treason" id="w">traitor</a>. On <a href="/wiki/October_3" id="w">October 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/1793" id="w">1793</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Writ" id="w">warrant</a> was issued for Condorcet&#39;s arrest.</p>
<a id="Arrest_and_death" name="Arrest_and_death"></a><h2>Arrest and death</h2>
<p><div style="wigth:250px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:250px-Pantheon_paris.jpg" title="Condorcet was symbolically interred in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] (pictured) in 1989."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/250px-Pantheon_paris.jpg" alt="Condorcet was symbolically interred in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] (pictured) in 1989." title="Condorcet was symbolically interred in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] (pictured) in 1989." class="location-right type-thumb" width="250px" />

<div class="thumbcaption">Condorcet was symbolically interred in the <a href="/wiki/Panth%C3%A9on%2C_Paris" id="w">Panthéon</a> (pictured) in 1989.</div></div>

The warrant forced Condorcet into hiding. He hid for five (or eight) months in the house of Mme. Vernet, on Rue Servandoni, in Paris. It was there that he wrote <i>Esquisse d&#39;un tableau historique des progrès de l&#39;esprit humain</i> (English translation: <i>Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind</i>), which was published posthumously in 1795 and is considered one of the major texts of the Enlightenment and of historical thought. It narrates the history of civilization as one of progress in the sciences, shows the intimate connection between <a href="/wiki/Scientific_progress" id="w">scientific progress</a> and the development of human rights and justice, and outlines the features of a future rational society entirely shaped by scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/March_25" id="w">March 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1794" id="w">1794</a> Condorcet, convinced he was no longer safe, left his hideout and attempted to flee Paris. Two days later he was arrested in <a href="/wiki/Clamart" id="w">Clamart</a> and imprisoned in the <a href="/wiki/Bourg-la-Reine" id="w">Bourg-la-Reine</a> (or, as it was known during the Revolution, <i>Bourg-l&#39;Égalité</i>, &#34;Equality Borough&#34; rather than &#34;Queen&#39;s Borough&#34;). Two days after that, he was found dead in his cell. The most widely accepted theory is that his friend, <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Jean_George_Cabanis" id="w">Pierre Jean George Cabanis</a>, gave him a poison which he eventually used. However, some historians believe that he may have been murdered (perhaps because he was too loved and respected to be executed).</p>
<p>Condorcet was interred in the <a href="/wiki/Panth%C3%A9on%2C_Paris" id="w">Panthéon</a> in 1989, in honor of the bicentennial of the French Revolution and Condorcet&#39;s role as a central figure in the Enlightenment. However his coffin was empty : interred in the common cemetery of Bourg-la-Reine, his remains were lost during the nineteenth century.</p>
<a id="Family" name="Family"></a><h1>Family</h1>
<p>In 1786 Condorcet married <a href="/wiki/Sophie_de_Condorcet" id="w">Sophie de Grouchy</a>, who was more than twenty years his junior. His wife, reckoned one of the most beautiful women of the day, became an accomplished <a href="/wiki/Salon_(gathering)" id="w">salon</a> hostess as Madame de Condorcet, and also an accomplished translator of <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Paine" id="w">Thomas Paine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" id="w">Adam Smith</a>.  Unusually for French noblewomen, she was erudite, intelligent, and well-educated, fluent in both English and Italian.  The marriage was a strong one, and Sophie visited her husband regularly while he remained in hiding. Although she began proceedings for divorce in January 1794, it was at the instance of Condorcet and Cabanis to protect their property from expropriation and to provide financially for herself and their young child, a daughter Louise Alexandrine, known as Eliza, who had been born in 1790.</p>
<p>Condorcet was survived by his widow, and their four-year-old daughter Eliza.  Sophie died in 1822, never having remarried, and having published all her husband&#39;s works between 1801 and 1804. Her work was carried on by their daughter Eliza Condorcet-O&#39;Connor, wife of former United Irishman <a href="/wiki/Arthur_O%26%2339%3BConnor" id="w">Arthur O&#39;Connor</a>.  The Condorcet-O&#39;Connors brought out a revised edition between 1847 and 1849.</p>
<a id="de_Condorcet_and_progress" name="de_Condorcet_and_progress"></a><h1>de Condorcet and progress</h1>
<p>Antoine-Nicolas de Condorcet&#39;s writtings were a key contribution to the <a href="/wiki/French_Enlightenment" id="w">French Enlightenment</a>, particularily his work on the concept of human <a href="/wiki/Progress" id="w">progress</a>. Previously it had been inconceivable to believe that man could come to understand everything about the natural world. <a href="/wiki/De_Condorcet" id="w">de Condorcet</a> believed that through the use of our <b>senses</b> and <a href="/wiki/Communication" id="w">communication</a> with others knowledge could be compared and contrased as a way of analyzing our systems of belief and understanding. Through this accumulation and sharing of <b>knowledge</b> he believed it was possible for any man to comprehend all the known facts of the <b>natural world</b>. The <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" id="w">enlightenment</a> of the natural world spurred the desire for <b>enlightenment</b> of the <a href="/wiki/Social" id="w">social</a> and political world. de Condorcet believed that there was no definition of the perfect human existence and thus believed that the progression of the human race would inevitably continue throughout the course of our existence. He envisioned man as continually progressing toward a perfectly <a href="/wiki/Utopian" id="w">utopian</a> society. However, de Condorcet stressed that for this to be a possibility man must unify regardless of <b>race</b>, <b>religion</b>, <b>culture</b>, <b>ethnicity</b> or <b>sex</b>. This concept of <a href="/wiki/Equality" id="w">equality</a> was not only the only way to progress toward a utopian existence, but equality itself was an attribute of such an existence.</p>
