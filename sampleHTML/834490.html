<b>Key</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> <a href="/wiki/Visual_novel" id="w">visual novel</a> studio under <a href="/wiki/Visual_Art%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">Visual Art&#39;s</a>, known for making dramatic and <a href="/wiki/Plot_(narrative)" id="w">plot</a>-oriented visual novels. <i><a href="/wiki/Kanon" id="w">Kanon</a></i> was Key&#39;s debut release, which combined an elaborate storyline, an up-to-date <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a>-style drawing style, and a musical score which helped to set the mood for the game. Key&#39;s second game, <i><a href="/wiki/Air_(visual_novel)" id="w">Air</a></i> had a similar if not more complex storyline to <i>Kanon</i> and a more thorough gameplay. Both <i>Kanon</i> and <i>Air</i> were originally produced as <a href="/wiki/Eroge" id="w">adult games</a>, but had non-erotic console ports released for the <a href="/wiki/Dreamcast" id="w">Dreamcast</a>, <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_2" id="w">PlayStation 2</a>, and <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_Portable" id="w">PlayStation Portable</a>. As of July 2007, Key has released six games, and has worked in the past with <a href="/wiki/Interchannel" id="w">Interchannel</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Prototype_(company)" id="w">Prototype</a> for the consumer port releases of previous Key titles.</p>
<p>Every soundtrack that is released based from one of Key&#39;s titles is on a <a href="/wiki/Record_label" id="w">record label</a> called <a href="/wiki/Key_Sounds_Label" id="w">Key Sounds Label</a>. There are other albums on the label not directly related to the visual novels, such as two albums by <a href="/wiki/Lia_(singer)" id="w">Lia</a> and one by <a href="/wiki/Eufonius" id="w">Eufonius</a>. The albums on this label have music composed by members from Key, such as <a href="/wiki/Jun_Maeda" id="w">Jun Maeda</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Shinji_Orito" id="w">Shinji Orito</a>. Three of Key&#39;s works, <i>Kanon</i>, <i>Air</i> and <i>Clannad</i>, have been made into <a href="/wiki/Anime" id="w">anime</a>. Key supervised the production of these anime while working with two animation studios, <a href="/wiki/Toei_Animation" id="w">Toei Animation</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Kyoto_Animation" id="w">Kyoto Animation</a>. Toei Animation animated the first <i>Kanon</i> TV anime series, the <a href="/wiki/Air_(film)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Air&#39;&#39; movie</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Clannad_(film)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Clannad&#39;&#39; movie</a>. Kyoto Animation animated the <i>Air</i> TV anime series, the second <i>Kanon</i> TV anime series, and the <i>Clannad</i> TV anime series.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>Before forming Key, the founding members worked for another visual novel development company called <a href="/wiki/Tactics_(company)" id="w">Tactics</a>. At the time of <i><a href="/wiki/D%C5%8Dsei" id="w">Dōsei</a><b>s production, Tactics&#39; first game, only two of Key&#39;s original staff worked on the game: <a href="/wiki/Itaru_Hinoue" id="w">Itaru Hinoue</a> as art director and <a href="/wiki/Shinji_Orito" id="w">Shinji Orito</a> as musical composer. After <i>Dōsei</i>, the rest of Key&#39;s founding staff joined Tactics and contributed to two more games: <i><a href="/wiki/Moon." id="w">Moon.</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/One:_Kagayaku_Kisetsu_e" id="w">One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e</a></i>. After the release of <i>One</i>, these developers transferred to <a href="/wiki/Visual_Art%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">Visual Art&#39;s</a> where they created their debut title <i><a href="/wiki/Kanon" id="w">Kanon</a></i> in 1999. <i>Kanon</i> was an <a href="/wiki/Eroge" id="w">adult game</a>,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> though the scenes containing sexual intercourse were kept to a minimum. This gave the player more of a focus on the characters&#39; stories and on the visuals and music, especially for a visual novel at the time of its release. A year later, in 2000, Key released their second game <i><a href="/wiki/Air_(visual_novel)" id="w">Air</a></i>, which was also an adult game and similar in storytelling to <i>Kanon</i>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>In 2001, Visual Art&#39;s created the <a href="/wiki/Record_label" id="w">record label</a> <a href="/wiki/Key_Sounds_Label" id="w">Key Sounds Label</a>.<sup id="_ref-ksldisc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ksldisc" title="">[3]</a></sup> The music albums released by Key after this were put under this label, meaning that this does not include the first three albums which were released before it was officially formed. The first album on this label was <i><a href="/wiki/Humanity..." id="w">Humanity...</a></i>, though the only direct connection to Key&#39;s works is that it contains a remixed version of the opening theme to <i>Air</i>. The albums under this label are composed by Key&#39;s signature <a href="/wiki/Composer" id="w">composers</a>: Jun Maeda, <a href="/wiki/Shinji_Orito" id="w">Shinji Orito</a> and <a href="/wiki/Magome_Togoshi" id="w">Magome Togoshi</a>. Three of the albums feature songs sung by <a href="/wiki/Lia_(singer)" id="w">Lia</a> and one other, <i><a href="/wiki/Love_Song_(album)" id="w">Love Song</a></i>, features the singer <a href="/wiki/Riya" id="w">Riya</a> from <a href="/wiki/Eufonius" id="w">Eufonius</a>. Two <a href="/wiki/Drama_CD" id="w">drama CDs</a> have been released as well.<sup id="_ref-ksldisc_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ksldisc" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The third game named <i><a href="/wiki/Clannad_(visual_novel)" id="w">Clannad</a></i> is a <a href="/wiki/Visual_novel" id="w">visual novel</a> similar to Key&#39;s previous games, but is entirely clean, without any <a href="/wiki/Hentai" id="w">adult</a> content. <i>Clannad</i> was meant to be released in 2002, but was delayed, leading to the game finally being released in 2004.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Seven months after <i>Clannad<b>s release, Key released their shortest game, <i><a href="/wiki/Planetarian:_Chiisana_Hoshi_no_Yume" id="w">Planetarian: Chiisana Hoshi no Yume</a></i>, in late 2004.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> <i>Planetarian</i>, in contrast to Key&#39;s past games, is a linear visual novel that does not require the user to make a choice, but to sit back and enjoy the story; this is what is referred to as a <a href="/wiki/KineticNovel" id="w">kinetic novel</a>. The company&#39;s fifth game was <i><a href="/wiki/Tomoyo_After:_It%26%2339%3Bs_a_Wonderful_Life" id="w">Tomoyo After: It&#39;s a Wonderful Life</a></i>, an <a href="/wiki/Eroge" id="w">adult</a> game and sequel of sorts to <i>Clannad</i> released in 2005.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Key released their sixth game, <i><a href="/wiki/Little_Busters!" id="w">Little Busters!</a></i>, on <a href="/wiki/July_27" id="w">July 27</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.<sup id="_ref-littlebusters!_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlebusters!" title="">[7]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>Key began to produce an <a href="/wiki/Internet_radio" id="w">Internet radio</a> show regarding the company with the first recording released on <a href="/wiki/December_13" id="w">December 13</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.<sup id="_ref-rec-1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rec-1" title="">[8]</a></sup> It is hosted by <a href="/wiki/Itaru_Hinoue" id="w">Itaru Hinoue</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shinji_Orito" id="w">Shinji Orito</a>, and another woman by the name of Chiro.<sup id="_ref-key-radio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-key-radio" title="">[9]</a></sup> Listeners can submit thoughts about the show and any requests they may have for the show, along with submitting questions to the host trio.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The broadcasts are available via download on Key&#39;s official website and the radio show&#39;s official blog.<sup id="_ref-key-radio_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-key-radio" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> The first broadcast was originally over an hour long, but was cut down to thirty minutes.<sup id="_ref-rec-1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-rec-1" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-key-radio_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-key-radio" title="">[9]</a></sup> The main topic of discussion of the first broadcast was Key&#39;s products at <a href="/wiki/Comiket" id="w">Comiket 73</a> to be held in late December 2007.<sup id="_ref-key-radio_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-key-radio" title="">[9]</a></sup> The second broadcast was an end-of-the-year special released on <a href="/wiki/December_28" id="w">December 28</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> and was longer than the first broadcast at forty-one minutes and thirty seconds.<sup id="_ref-key-radio_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-key-radio" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Staff" name="Staff"></a><h2>Staff</h2>
<a id="Main" name="Main"></a><h3>Main</h3>
<p>The main staff in Key are members that have had a hand in nearly every game released by Key and do the majority of the work involved. <a href="/wiki/Jun_Maeda" id="w">Jun Maeda</a> has worked on the planning for the individual projects and was one of the main scenario writers; he has also composed music for all of Key&#39;s games except <i>Planetarian</i>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-" title="">[22]</a></sup> Maeda was reported to say in the February 2007 issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Comptiq" id="w">Comptiq</a></i> that after the completion of <i>Little Busters!</i>, he would not be working on the scenario staff for Key any longer. However, in an interview in the December 2007 issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Dengeki_G%26%2339%3Bs_Magazine" id="w">Dengeki G&#39;s Magazine</a></i>, Maeda said that he would still be working on the music for Key&#39;s next game.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Itaru_Hinoue" id="w">Itaru Hinoue</a> is Key&#39;s main artist and was the art director for Key&#39;s first three games.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Na-Ga" id="w">Na-Ga</a>, another prominent artist in the company, mainly worked with background art in earlier games, but with <i>Little Busters!</i> was given the position of co-art director with Hinoue.<sup id="_ref-littlebusters!_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littlebusters!" title="">[7]</a></sup> Further computer graphics have been provided in the past by three graphic artists, Shinory, Mochisuke, and Minimo Yamada.<sup id="_ref-kanon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kanon" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Key&#39;s main <a href="/wiki/Composer" id="w">composer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shinji_Orito" id="w">Shinji Orito</a>, has been with the company since <i>Kanon</i>.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> With Maeda no longer contributing to the scenario, another scenario writer, <a href="/wiki/Y%C5%ABto_Tonogawa" id="w">Yūto Tonogawa</a>, joined Key and first worked on the scenario in <i>Little Busters!</i>.</p>

According to Satoshi Todome&#39;s work, <i>A History of Adult Games</i>, Key&#39;s impact on the visual novel, or rather primarily the <a href="/wiki/Eroge" id="w">adult game</a>, world stems from before Key was formed and most of the founding members of Key worked for <a href="/wiki/Tactics_(company)" id="w">Tactics</a> under <a href="/wiki/Nexton" id="w">Nexton</a>.<sup id="_ref-history-of-adult-games_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history-of-adult-games" title="">[37]</a></sup> Due to an influence by <a href="/wiki/Leaf_(company)" id="w">Leaf&#39;s</a> visual novel <i><a href="/wiki/To_Heart" id="w">To Heart</a></i> released in 1997, the developers at Tactics created a simple formula for a game: a comedic first half with a heart-warming romantic middle followed by a tragic separation and finally an emotional reunion formed what is known as a &#34;crying game&#34;. The main purpose of such a game is to make the player feel for the characters and make them cry due to emotional scenarios which serves to leave a bigger impact on the player after the game is over.<sup id="_ref-history-of-adult-games_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history-of-adult-games" title="">[37]</a></sup> Tactics&#39; second title <i><a href="/wiki/One:_Kagayaku_Kisetsu_e" id="w">One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e</a></i> was created based on this formula.</p>
<p>After <i>One</i> was complete, the development team quit Tactics to form Key where they developed their first title <i><a href="/wiki/Kanon" id="w">Kanon</a></i> also based upon on this formula.<sup id="_ref-history-of-adult-games_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-history-of-adult-games" title="">[37]</a></sup> <i>Kanon</i> was &#34;heavily hyped [and] had gamers impatient until its release. It was only one game released by Key so far, and yet [it] had already sent major shockwaves around the industry. And yet another game [<i>Air</i>], two years later, sent even more shockwaves. <i>Air</i> was equally hyped and well received.&#34;<sup id="_ref-bluemist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bluemist" title="">[38]</a></sup> The success of <i>One</i> and <i>Kanon</i> on Key&#39;s formula to create a &#34;crying game&#34; was later adopted by other visual novel developing companys which were influenced by this formula.

<a id="Leaf%2C_Key_BBS" name="Leaf%2C_Key_BBS"></a><h3>Leaf, Key BBS</h3>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" id="w">bulletin board system</a> (BBS) based off of the interface of the large Japanese <a href="/wiki/Internet_forum" id="w">Internet forum</a> <a href="/wiki/2channel" id="w">2channel</a> (2ch) was formed on <a href="/wiki/January_26" id="w">January 26</a> <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a> named {{Nihongo}}, otherwise nicknamed as {{Nihongo}}.<sup id="_ref-BBS-chrono_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBS-chrono" title="">[45]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Leaf-Key-BBS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leaf-Key-BBS" title="">[46]</a></sup> The board originated from 2ch&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Video_game" id="w">video game</a> discussion board due to a dispute involving the game <i><a href="/wiki/Kizuato" id="w">Kizuato</a></i> in December 1999;<sup id="_ref-BBS-chrono_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBS-chrono" title="">[45]</a></sup> <i>Kizuato</i> was an early game of another visual novel producing company named <a href="/wiki/Leaf_(company)" id="w">Leaf</a>. Ultimately, fans of the game moved to 2ch&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Eroge" id="w">adult game</a> board, but there was not much resolution, and at the time Key fans on the board were being shunned for discussions on <i>Kanon</i> and, at the time, Key&#39;s upcoming game <i>Air</i>. This resulted finally with the Leaf and Key fans moving away from 2ch and forming again on the PINKchannel Internet forum.<sup id="_ref-Leaf-Key-BBS_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leaf-Key-BBS" title="">[46]</a></sup> The board serves as a discussion board for anything related to Leaf and Key. This includes the games the companies produce, but also the companies themselves and the staff that make up those companies. The BBS gets approximately 1500 posts per day as of November 2007. Like 2ch, the board has a default <a href="/wiki/Anonymous" id="w">anonymous</a> posting setting, and the defalt name is {{Nihongo}}, a reference to the heroine <a href="/wiki/One:_Kagayaku_Kisetsu_e#Main characters" id="w">Mizuka Nagamori</a> from <i><a href="/wiki/One:_Kagayaku_Kisetsu_e" id="w">One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e</a></i> who uses the words &#34;dayo&#34; and &#34;mon&#34; frequently.<sup id="_ref-Leaf-Key-BBS_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Leaf-Key-BBS" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
