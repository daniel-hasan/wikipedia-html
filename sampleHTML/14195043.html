<p>This specific epithet refers to the relatively small flowers of this species. History <a href="/wiki/F._Eichlam" id="w">F. Eichlam</a> found this cacti in Guatemala and sent a living specimen to the U. S. which flowered in Washington on October 3, 1912. It had previously been collected at several occasions but passed as <i><a href="/wiki/Epiphyllum_pittieri" id="w">E. pittieri</a></i>. Unaware of its variable nature, Britton and Rose described the same species again in the same paper, under the name <i>E. caudatum</i>. This time from a specimen collected in Oaxaca, Mexico collected by   <a href="/wiki/E._W._Nelson" id="w">E. W. Nelson</a> in 1894. Later the same year, Vaupel transferred the two taxa to <i>Phyllocactus</i>, an invalid name used in Europe by that time. </p>
