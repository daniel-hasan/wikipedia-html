<p>The <b>Kentucky Coffeetree</b>, <i>Gymnocladus dioicus</i>, is a <a href="/wiki/Tree" id="w">tree</a> in the subfamily <a href="/wiki/Caesalpinioideae" id="w">Caesalpinioideae</a> of the pea family <a href="/wiki/Fabaceae" id="w">Fabaceae</a>, native to the <a href="/wiki/Midwestern_United_States" id="w">midwest</a> of <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a>. The range is limited, occurring from the far south of <a href="/wiki/Ontario" id="w">Ontario</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a> and in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> from <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" id="w">Kentucky</a> (where it was first encountered by Europeans) and western <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a> in the east, to <a href="/wiki/Kansas" id="w">Kansas</a>,eastern <a href="/wiki/Nebraska" id="w">Nebraska</a>, and southeastern <a href="/wiki/South_Dakota" id="w">South Dakota</a> in the west, and to northern <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a> in the south. It was formerly the state tree of <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" id="w">Kentucky</a>.</p>
<a id="Description" name="Description"></a><h2>Description</h2>

<p>Varies from seventy-five to one hundred feet high with a trunk two or three feet in diameter which usually separates ten or fifteen feet from the ground into three or four divisions which spread slightly and form a narrow pyramidal head; or when crowded by other trees, sending up one tall central branchless shaft to the height of fifty or seventy feet.  Branches stout, pithy, and blunt; roots fibrous.<sup id="_ref-Keeler_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Keeler" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Like the <a href="/wiki/Sumac" id="w">Sumac</a> this is totally destitute of fine spray, its smaller branches are thick, blunt, clumsy and lumpish.  Other trees lose their leaves but along their twigs and branchlets are borne the buds, the hope and the promise of the coming year.  But the <i>Gymnocladus</i> seems so destitute of these, that the French in Canada named it <b>Chicot</b>, the dead tree.  Even when spring comes it  gives no apparent recognition of light and warmth until nearly every other tree is in full leaf.  The casual observer says it bears no winter buds, but there is a tiny pair, wrapped in down and woll, lying sleeping in the axil of every last year&#39;s leaf.<sup id="_ref-Keeler_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Keeler" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Leaves</div>
The Kentucky Coffeetree has immense bipinnate <a href="/wiki/Leaf" id="w">leaves</a>, 60-90 cm in length, and about 2/3 as broad. The leaves emerge later in the spring than those of most other <a href="/wiki/Deciduous" id="w">deciduous</a> trees, and fall earlier in the autumn.</p>
<p>Among the trees of the eastern United States, there are two others with similarly large leaves: the <a href="/wiki/Honey_locust" id="w">Honey locust</a>(Gleditsia triacanthos) and the Devil&#39;s Walking-Stick(Aralia spinosa).  Despite the large leaves the tree is sparingly clothed and the foliage effect is scanty.  The expanding leaves are conspicuous because of the varied colors of the leaflets; the youngest are bright pink, while those which are older vary from green to bronze.<sup id="_ref-Keeler_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Keeler" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Bark of the Kentucky coffeetree</div>
The bark is ash-gray and scaly, flaking similarly to <a href="/wiki/Black_cherry" id="w">black cherry</a>, but more so. The <a href="/wiki/Flower" id="w">flowers</a> are <a href="/wiki/Plant_sexuality" id="w">dioecious</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Fruit" id="w">fruit</a> is a hard-shelled bean in heavy, woody, thick-walled pods filled with sweet, thick, gooey pulp. The shape of the pods varies somewhat: pod length ranges from ca. 12.7cm to 25.4cm; unfertilized female trees may bear miniature seedless pods. The beans contain the <a href="/wiki/Toxin" id="w">toxin</a> cytisine. </p>

<li>Winter buds: Minute, depressed in downy cavities of the stem, two in the axil of each leaf, the smaller sterile.  Bud scales two, ovate, coated with brown tomentum and growing with the shoot, become orange green, hairy and about one inch long, before they fall.</li>

Leaf stalks and stalks of pinnae, are terete, enlarged at base, smooth when mature, pale green, often purple on the upper side.  Leaflets ovate, two to two and one-half inches long, wedge-shaped or irregularly rounded at base, with wavy margin, acute apex.

<a id="Taxonomy" name="Taxonomy"></a><h2>Taxonomy</h2>

<p><i>Gymnocladus</i> is of Greek derivation and refers to the stout branches destitute of spray.<sup id="_ref-Keeler_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Keeler" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is one of three species in the genus <i>Gymnocladus</i>, the other two being native to eastern <a href="/wiki/Asia" id="w">Asia</a>. These are <b>Chinese Coffeetree</b> <i>Gymnocladus chinensis</i> in central China, and <b>Burmese Coffeetree</b> <i>Gymnocladus burmanicus</i> in <a href="/wiki/Myanmar" id="w">Myanmar</a>.</p>
<p>The name is sometimes hyphenated as &#39;coffee-tree&#39;; the form &#39;coffeetree&#39; used here is as used officially by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service" id="w">United States Forest Service</a>.</p>
<a id="Distribution" name="Distribution"></a><h2>Distribution</h2>

<p>Widely dispersed, but rare.</p>
<p>This tree usually occurs as widely dispersed individuals or small colonial groups with interconnected root systems. This tree is found in floodplains and river valleys but is also sometimes seen on rocky hillsides and limestone woods. In the northeastern part of its range, seemingly natural groves of this tree are actually associated with known prehistoric village sites.</p>

Kentucky Coffeetree is easy to grow from seed. Filing the seedcoat by hand with a small file, and then soaking the seeds in water for 24 hours will ensure rapid germination. <a href="/wiki/Plant_propagation" id="w">Propagation</a> is also easy from dormant <a href="/wiki/Root_cuttings" id="w">root cuttings</a>.</p>
<p>It forms large <a href="/wiki/Clonal_colony" id="w">clonal colonies</a>, reproducing by shoots sprouting from roots.</p>
<p>Prefers bottom lands, and a rich moist soil.<sup id="_ref-Keeler_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Keeler" title="">[1]</a></sup>  This tree is bothered little by heat, cold, drought, insects, disease, road salt, ice, and alkaline soil.</p>
<a id="Uses" name="Uses"></a><h2>Uses</h2>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>In pleasure grounds it is not uncommon, since it is often planted because of its unique appearance and interesting character.<sup id="_ref-Keeler_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Keeler" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The peculiarly late-emerging and early-dropping leaves, coupled with the fact that the large leaves mean few twigs in the winter profile, make it a tree that is ideal for urban shading where winter sunlight is to be maximized (such as in proximity to <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" id="w">solar</a> hot-air systems). </p>
<a id="Food" name="Food"></a><h3>Food</h3>

<p>The common name &#34;coffeetree&#34; derives from the use of the roasted seeds as a substitute for <a href="/wiki/Coffee" id="w">coffee</a> in times of poverty. They are a very inferior substitute for real coffee, and caution should be used in trying them as they are poisonous in large quantities. </p>
