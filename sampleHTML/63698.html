<ul>
<li><b>Copts</b> ({{Unicode}} قبط) – Under Muslim rule, the Egyptians came to be known as <a href="/wiki/Copt" id="w">Copts</a>, a derivative of the Greek word {{Polytonic}}, <i>Aiguptios</i> (Egyptian), from {{Polytonic}}, <i>Aiguptos</i> (Egypt).

The majority live near the banks of the <a href="/wiki/Nile" id="w">Nile River</a> where the only <a href="/wiki/Arable_land" id="w">arable land</a> is found. Close to a half of the Egyptian people today are urban, living in the densely populated centres of greater <a href="/wiki/Cairo" id="w">Cairo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alexandria" id="w">Alexandria</a> and other major cities. Most of the rest are <a href="/wiki/Fellahin" id="w">fellahin</a> (farmers) leading humble lives in rural towns and villages. A large influx of fellahin into urban towns and cities, and rapid urbanization of many rural areas since the turn of the last century, have shifted the balance between the number of urban and rural Egyptians. </p>
<p>Egyptians also form smaller minorities in the countries that neighbour them, in particular <a href="/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" id="w">Saudi Arabia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Libya" id="w">Libya</a> where they are mostly temporary professionals and workers, as well as in other countries as immigrants, notably in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" id="w">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" id="w">Italy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greece" id="w">Greece</a> and <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>. It is also a matter of dispute whether the <a href="/wiki/Egyptians_(Balkans)" id="w">Egyptian population</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Balkans" id="w">Balkan states</a> are ethnic Egyptians. </p>
<p>The Egyptians are an <a href="/wiki/Autochthonous" id="w">autochthonous</a> people deeply attached to their land. Historically, it was rare for Egyptians to leave their country permanently or for an extended period of time—it was not until the 1970s that Egyptians began to emigrate in large numbers. Until only recently, a study on the pattern of Egyptian emigration was quoted as saying &#34;Egyptians have a reputation of preferring their own soil. Few leave except to study or travel; and they always return... Egyptians do not emigrate.&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Egyptians also tend to be provincial, meaning their attachment extends not only to Egypt but to the specific <a href="/wiki/Governorates_of_Egypt" id="w">provinces</a>, towns and villages from which they hail. Therefore, return migrants, such as temporary workers abroad, come back to their region of origin in Egypt.</p>

<p>A sizable Egyptian diaspora did not begin to form until well into the 1980s, today numbering nearly 4 million (2006 est).<sup id="_ref-Ahram Weekly 1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ahram Weekly 1" title="">[5]</a></sup> Generally, those who emigrate to the United States and western European countries tend to do so with the intention of settling permanently, while Egyptians migrating to neighboring countries in the Middle East only go there to work with the intention of returning to Egypt:</p>

Egyptian emigration is primarily motivated by economic and political considerations. High rates of unemployment and population growth are two of the socioeconomic conditions that steadily deteriorated following the 1952 <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%26%2339%3B%C3%A9tat" id="w">coup d&#39;état</a>, leading scores of Egyptians to seek better opportunities in foreign countries. Political repression and human rights violations by Egypt&#39;s ruling régime are other contributing factors (see <a href="/wiki/Egypt#Human rights" id="w">Egypt - Human rights</a>). Egyptians have also been impacted by the wars between Egypt and <a href="/wiki/Israel" id="w">Israel</a>, particularly after the <a href="/wiki/Six-Day_War" id="w">Six-Day War</a> in 1967, when migration rates began to rise. In August 2006, Egyptians made headlines when 11 students from <a href="/wiki/Mansoura_University" id="w">Mansoura University</a> failed to show up at their <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> host institutions for a cultural exchange program in the hope of finding employment.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Many <a href="/wiki/Copt" id="w">Coptic Christians</a> also leave the country due to discrimination and harassment by the Egyptian government and Islamist groups.</p>
<p>Egyptians in neighboring countries face additional challenges.

Among the samples included in the study is skeletal material from the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fayum_mummy_portraits">Hawara tombs of Fayum</a>, which clustered very closely with the <a href="/wiki/Badarian" id="w">Badarian</a> series of the <a href="/wiki/Predynastic_Egypt" id="w">predynastic</a> period. All the samples, particularly those of the Dynastic period, were significantly divergent from a neolithic West Saharan sample from Lower Nubia. Biological continuity was also found intact from the dynastic to the post-pharaonic periods. According to Irish:             
</p><blockquote>[The Egyptian] samples [996 mummies] exhibit morphologically simple, mass-reduced <a href="/wiki/Dentition" id="w">dentitions</a> that are similar to those in populations from greater North Africa (Irish, 1993, 1998a–c, 2000) and, to a lesser extent, western Asia and Europe (Turner, 1985a; Turner and Markowitz, 1990; Roler, 1992; Lipschultz, 1996; Irish, 1998a). Similar craniofacial measurements among samples from these regions were reported as well (Brace et al., 1993)... an inspection of MMD values reveals no evidence of increasing <a href="/wiki/Phenetic" id="w">phenetic</a> distance between samples from the first and second halves of this almost 3,000-year-long period. For example, phenetic distances between First-Second Dynasty Abydos and samples from Fourth Dynasty Saqqara (MMD ¼ 0.050), 11-12th Dynasty Thebes (0.000), 12th Dynasty Lisht (0.072), 19th Dynasty Qurneh (0.053), and 26th–30th Dynasty Giza (0.027) do not exhibit a directional increase through time... Thus, despite increasing foreign influence after the Second Intermediate Period, not only did Egyptian culture remain intact (Lloyd, 2000a), but the people themselves, as represented by the dental samples, appear biologically constant as well... Gebel Ramlah [Neolithic Nubian/Western Desert sample] is, in fact, significantly different from <a href="/wiki/Badari" id="w">Badari</a> based on the 22-trait MMD (Table 4). For that matter, the Neolithic Western Desert sample is significantly different from all others [but] is closest to predynastic and early dynastic samples.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></blockquote>

A group of noted physical anthropologists conducted <a href="/wiki/Craniofacial" id="w">craniofacial</a> studies of Egyptian skeletal remains and concluded similarly that &#34;the Egyptians have been in place since back in the Pleistocene and have been largely unaffected by either invasions or migrations.

<p><a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" id="w">University of Chicago</a> Egyptologist Frank Yurco confirmed this finding of historical and regional continuity, saying:          
</p><blockquote>Certainly there was some foreign admixture [in Egypt], but basically a homogeneous African population had lived in the Nile Valley from ancient to modern times... [the] Badarian people, who developed the earliest Predynastic Egyptian culture, already exhibited the mix of North African and Sub-Saharan physical traits that have typified Egyptians ever since (Hassan 1985; Yurco 1989; Trigger 1978; Keita 1990; Brace et al., this volume)... The peoples of Egypt, the Sudan, and much of East Africa, Ethiopia and Somalia are now generally regarded as a Nilotic (i.e. Nile River) continuity, with widely ranging physical features (complexions light to dark, various hair and craniofacial types) but with powerful common cultural traits, including cattle pastoralist traditions (Trigger 1978; Bard, Snowden, this volume). Language research suggests that this Saharan-Nilotic population became speakers of the Afro-Asiatic languages... Semitic was evidently spoken by Saharans who crossed the Red Sea into Arabia and became ancestors of the Semitic speakers there, possibly around 7000 BC... In summary we may say that Egypt was distinct North African culture rooted in the Nile Valley and on the Sahara.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Egyptians may have the longest continuous history of any people, spanning a period of some 7,000 years.

A succession of thirty mostly native dynasties ruled for the next three <a href="/wiki/Millennium" id="w">millennia</a>, during which Egyptian culture flourished and remained distinctively Egyptian in its <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_mythology" id="w">religion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Art_of_ancient_Egypt" id="w">arts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_language" id="w">language</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">customs</a>. <a href="/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" id="w">Alexander the Great</a> conquered Egypt in <a href="/wiki/332_BC" id="w">332 BC</a>, giving rise to the <a href="/wiki/Ptolemaic_Egypt" id="w">Ptolemaic dynasty</a> which introduced <a href="/wiki/Hellenistic_civilization" id="w">Hellenic</a> culture to the Egyptians, but continued to rule according to ancient Egyptian traditions.

By about 5500 BC, Egypt was inhabited by settled communities of people who cultivated emmer wheat and barley, made pottery, weaved linen and raised sheep, goats and cattle. Before the unification of <a href="/wiki/Lower_and_Upper_Egypt" id="w">Lower and Upper Egypt</a>, northern Egyptians seem to have been somewhat culturally distinct from their neighbors to the south. Surviving evidence for early settlement in Lower Egypt such as pottery, houses and burial sites appear different from those of the Upper Egyptians. The earliest known predynastic northern Egyptian site, Merimda, predates the earliest in Upper Egypt, the <a href="/wiki/Badarian" id="w">Badarian</a>, by about 700 years.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> However, later predynastic Lower Egyptians were in contact with not only contemporaneous southern Egyptians, but also with people from the <a href="/wiki/Levant" id="w">Levant</a> and with the <a href="/wiki/Sumerians" id="w">Sumerians</a> of <a href="/wiki/Uruk" id="w">Uruk</a>, as some of the plants cultivated and the pottery types found in Lower Egypt resemble those of neighboring cultures.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Prehistoric Lower Egyptians already believed in an existence after death, as attested by their grave goods.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Each province before the unification of Egypt acquired its own animal deity. <a href="/wiki/Wadjet" id="w">Uto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bast_(goddess)" id="w">Bast</a> were worshipped in the <a href="/wiki/Nile_delta" id="w">delta</a> towns of <a href="/wiki/Buto" id="w">Buto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bubastis" id="w">Bubastis</a> respectively, while <a href="/wiki/Thoth" id="w">Thoth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wepwawet" id="w">Wepwawet</a> were the Upper Egyptian deities of <a href="/wiki/Hermopolis" id="w">Ashmounein</a> and <a href="/wiki/Asyut" id="w">Asyut</a>. The predynastic settlements of Upper Egypt displayed more elaborate funerary practices and artifacts that were more clearly the direct predecessors of those of the dynastic Egyptians. Significantly, the earliest known evidence of <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyph" id="w">Egyptian hieroglyphic</a> inscriptions appears on <a href="/wiki/Naqada" id="w">Naqada</a> III pottery vessels dated to about 3200 BC.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> During the predynastic and <a href="/wiki/Protodynastic_Period_of_Egypt" id="w">protodynastic</a> periods, the southern Egyptian cities of <a href="/wiki/Nekheb" id="w">Nekheb</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nekhen" id="w">Nekhen</a> (Hierakonpolis) and <a href="/wiki/Abydos%2C_Egypt" id="w">Abydos</a> were major centers of power. The first attempt to conquer Lower Egypt seems to have been made by a king from Nekhen known as Scorpion, but it would be another 100 years or so before another upper Egyptian king successfully unified the two lands.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>

 beginning of the Egyptians&#39; recorded history starts with the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt by the Upper Egyptian king <a href="/wiki/Narmer" id="w">Narmer</a> (identified with the pharaoh <a href="/wiki/Menes" id="w">Menes</a>). He founded <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">Ancient Egypt</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/First_dynasty_of_Egypt" id="w">1st dynasty</a> around 3150 BC. To strengthen his political role, King Menes/Narmer married the northern Egyptian princess Neithotep and took on the title of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_royal_titulary#The Nebty (Two Ladies) Name" id="w">Two Ladies</a>, i.e., <a href="/wiki/Nekhbet" id="w">Nekhbet</a>, the vulture goddess of Upper Egypt and <a href="/wiki/Wadjet" id="w">Uto</a> the cobra goddess worshipped by the Lower Egyptians, as a symbol of the unification. <a href="/wiki/Herodotus" id="w">Herodotus</a>, like the Egyptian historian <a href="/wiki/Manetho" id="w">Manetho</a>, associated the unification with King Menes. He also indicated that Menes founded the ancient city of <a href="/wiki/Memphis%2C_Egypt" id="w">Memphis</a> in Lower Egypt, which became the new capital of the unified country. The Egyptians from this point onwards referred to the country as <i>tAwy</i>, Two Lands, a name that came to predominate until the <a href="/wiki/New_Kingdom" id="w">New Kingdom</a> period when the name <i>km.t</i> (<a href="/wiki/Coptic_language" id="w">Coptic</a>: <i>kīmi</i>), Black Land, was more commonly used. The first two dynasties of Egypt were each ruled by eight kings and lasted for a combined period of nearly 400 years.</p>

<p>By the end of the <a href="/wiki/Early_Dynastic_Period_of_Egypt" id="w">Early Dynastic period</a>, a strong centralized government was firmly established with Memphis as its capital city, and the foundations of the first peak period of Egyptian civilization were laid. The following era in Egyptian history, the <a href="/wiki/Old_Kingdom" id="w">Old Kingdom</a> (<i>c</i>. 2700−2200 BC), is particularly famous for its magnificent superstructures, many of which served as royal tombs for the pharaohs. They were state-sponsored projects built in the <a href="/wiki/Third_dynasty_of_Egypt" id="w">3rd</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fourth_dynasty_of_Egypt" id="w">4th</a> dynasties and in which the whole of the Egyptian population often participated.

 <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_mythology" id="w">religion</a> and <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" id="w">writing</a> took definitive shape in the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods. The local pantheon, which had been in the predynastic period confined to sacred animal deities, expanded to include cosmic gods representing the sun, moon, sky and wind. This constituted an effort toward greater philosophical and intellectual development.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> Solar worship embodied in the cults of <a href="/wiki/Ra" id="w">Ra</a> and <a href="/wiki/Atum" id="w">Atum</a>—subsequently Atum-Ra—came to particular prominence in the Old Kingdom.

<p>A period of political fragmentation led to the <a href="/wiki/First_Intermediate_Period_of_Egypt" id="w">First Intermediate Period of Egypt</a>. It lasted for about 150 years during which central authority and social order were maintained by local governors. Stronger Nile floods and stabilization of government brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt" id="w">Middle Kingdom</a> <i>c</i>. 2040 BC, reaching a peak during the reign of <a href="/wiki/Amenemhat_III" id="w">Amenemhat III</a>. <a href="/wiki/Thebes%2C_Egypt" id="w">Thebes</a> (modern <a href="/wiki/Luxor" id="w">Luxor</a>) became the new capital during the <a href="/wiki/Eleventh_dynasty_of_Egypt" id="w">11th dysnaty</a>, though government administration remained in Memphis. Egyptians regularly traded with their neighbors to the south and east, and their political influence extended into those areas. However, land cultivation and stock raising remained the foundation of Egypt&#39;s economy, as they would during the course of Egyptian history. The state did not institute a system of coinage until the <a href="/wiki/Late_Period_of_Ancient_Egypt" id="w">Late Period</a>—most business hitherto was conducted by barter.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> The Middle Kingdom became a golden age of Egyptian literature thanks to a large body of textual evidence that made this stage of <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_language" id="w">Egyptian</a> (i.e., Middle Egyptian) the classical phase of the language.</p>
<p>The end of the Middle Kingdom was brought about by a decline in central authority which led to Egypt being occupied for the first time during its dynastic history. The <a href="/wiki/Hyksos" id="w">Hyksos</a> invaders were a <a href="/wiki/Semitic" id="w">Semitic</a> people who took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC, and founded a new capital at <a href="/wiki/Avaris" id="w">Avaris</a>. They ruled as Egyptian pharaohs and their names were often inscribed on scarabs bearing both the their Semitic and Egyptian titles. Hyksos rule lasted just over 100 years when they were eventually driven out by the native Egyptian nobleman <a href="/wiki/Ahmose_I" id="w">Ahmose I</a>. Despite the Hyksos&#39; attempt to rule according to native Egyptian traditions, the Egyptians&#39; perception of them was consistently negative. They were depicted as &#34;uncouth barbarians who &#39;ruled without Re.&#39;&#34;<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Ahmose took to the throne in a re-unified Egypt, and with his rule began a period of Egyptian independence as well as expansion into surrounding regions.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/New_Kingdom" id="w">New Kingdom</a> is perhaps the most celebrated period of Egyptian history. Lasting from roughly 1550 to 1070 BC, the period marked the rise of Egypt as an international power. Ahmose founded the <a href="/wiki/Eighteenth_dynasty_of_Egypt" id="w">18th dynasty</a> and relocated the capital to <a href="/wiki/Thebes%2C_Egypt" id="w">Thebes</a>, though once again Memphis remained the administrative capital. The Egyptians emerged from the shock of the Hyksos invasion determined to protect Egypt&#39;s national and territorial integrity. The Egyptian army developed into a well-organized service made up of professionally trained soldiers. International relations became a primary concern for the New Kingdom pharaohs. Egyptians were introduced to many foreign ideas, some of which they adopted and incorporated into their lifestyle. As in most periods, agriculture and stock farming continued to be the mainstays of Egyptian economy. The introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Shaduf" id="w">shaduf</a> from western Asia helped develop more efficient methods of irrigation. <a href="/wiki/Amun" id="w">Amun</a> rose to become a state god and was <a href="/wiki/Syncretism" id="w">syncretized</a> with Ra as Amun-Ra. The main <a href="/wiki/Precinct_of_Amon-Re" id="w">Temple of Amun</a> built in Thebes is the largest structure in the <a href="/wiki/Karnak" id="w">Karnak</a> complex.</p>
<p>Perhaps this period is best known for some of its rulers. Queen <a href="/wiki/Hatshepsut" id="w">Hatshepsut</a> was one of only a few Egyptian female rulers and their most influential. She sent trade missions as far south as the coast of modern <a href="/wiki/Eritrea" id="w">Eritrea</a>, and her numerous building projects, most notably her <a href="/wiki/Mortuary_temple" id="w">mortuary temple</a> complex at <a href="/wiki/Deir_el-Bahri" id="w">Deir el-Bahri</a>, were rivaled only by those of her Old Kingdom predecessors. <a href="/wiki/Thutmose_III" id="w">Thutmose III</a>, dubbed the Napoleon of Egypt, pushed Egypt&#39;s southern frontier to the Fourth Cataract in <a href="/wiki/Nubia" id="w">Nubia</a>, then conquered and subsequently founded protectorates in the <a href="/wiki/Levant" id="w">Levant</a>. He undertook a building program at Karnak, including the festival temple &#34;Effective of Monuments&#34; in the precinct of Amun.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Akhenaten" id="w">Akhenaten</a> with his wife <a href="/wiki/Nefertiti" id="w">Nefertiti</a> revolutionized Egyptian religion, albeit briefly, with the solar <a href="/wiki/Monotheism" id="w">monotheism</a> of <a href="/wiki/Aten" id="w">Aten</a>. Young King <a href="/wiki/Tutankhamun" id="w">Tutankhamun</a> is world famous for his magnificent tomb found intact. <a href="/wiki/Ramesses_II" id="w">Ramesses II</a> conducted many successful military campaigns and signed what may be the world&#39;s first peace treaty.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> He constructed many impressive monuments, including the renowned archaeological complex of <a href="/wiki/Abu_Simbel" id="w">Abu Simbel</a> and the memorial temple of <a href="/wiki/Ramesseum" id="w">Ramesseum</a>. <a href="/wiki/Ramesses_III" id="w">Ramesses III</a> was the last of the great pharaohs of the New Kingdom, under whose rule Egypt reached a peak of prosperity.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

<p>When the New Kingdom came to an end, the priests of Amun and the military had become powerful and independent at the expense of the throne. By 1200 BC, Egypt was under repeated attacks by <a href="/wiki/Berber_people" id="w">Libyans</a> from the west and invaders from the <a href="/wiki/Aegean_Sea" id="w">Aegean</a> region referred to as the <a href="/wiki/Sea_Peoples" id="w">Sea Peoples</a>. The country fell into the chaos of the <a href="/wiki/Third_Intermediate_Period_of_Egypt" id="w">Third Intermediate Period</a> during which authority was divided among several competing <a href="/wiki/Nomarch" id="w">nomarchs</a>. The 22nd through the 25th dynasties were made up entirely of Libyan and <a href="/wiki/Nubia" id="w">Nubian</a>/<a href="/wiki/Kush" id="w">Kushite</a> rulers. The <a href="/wiki/Assyria" id="w">Assyrians</a> invaded and took of control of Egypt in the 7th century BC, but soon a native Egyptian dynasty drove out the Assyrians and reclaimed the throne. The <a href="/wiki/Twenty-sixth_dynasty_of_Egypt" id="w">26th dynasty</a> began the Saïte period which witnessed another period of Egyptian independence as well as a cultural revival. The first Saïte king, <a href="/wiki/Psammetichus_I" id="w">Psamtek I</a>, founded a new capital at <a href="/wiki/Sais%2C_Egypt" id="w">Saïs</a> and reunified upper and lower Egypt. Egyptians looked at the Old Kingdom, by then a 2000-year-old civilization, for inspiration in their artistic and religious expression to cope with the repeated foreign assaults on their country at the close of the Pharaonic era.</p>

<p>Throughout the Pharaonic epoch, divine kingship was the glue which held Egyptian society together. It was especially pronounced in the Old and Middle Kingdoms and continued until the Roman conquest. The societal structure created by this system of government remained virtually unchanged up to modern times.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> The role of the king, however, was considerably weakened after the <a href="/wiki/Twentieth_dynasty_of_Egypt" id="w">20th dynasty</a>. The king in his role as Son of Ra was entrusted to maintain <a href="/wiki/Ma%26%2339%3Bat#Ma&#39;at as a principle" id="w">Ma&#39;at</a>, the principle of truth, justice and order. His job also entailed maintaining and enhancing the country&#39;s agricultural economy by ensuring regular annual <a href="/wiki/Nile" id="w">Nile</a> floods on which the people depended for sustenance and their very livelihood. Ascendancy to the Egyptian throne reflected the myth of Horus who assumed kingship after he buried his murdered father <a href="/wiki/Osiris" id="w">Osiris</a>. The king of Egypt, as a living personification of Horus, could claim the throne after burying his predecessor, who was typically his father. When the role of the king waned, the country became more susceptible to foreign influence and invasion.</p>

</p>
<p>The attention paid to the dead, and the veneration with which they were held, were one of the hallmarks of ancient Egyptian society. Egyptians built tombs for their dead that were meant to last for eternity. This was most prominently expressed by the Great Pyramids. The ancient <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_language" id="w">Egyptian</a> word for tomb <i>pr n{{Unicode}}</i> means &#39;House of Eternity.&#39; The Egyptians also celebrated life and this is attested by tomb reliefs and inscriptions, papyri and other sources depicting Egyptians farming, conducting trade expeditions, hunting, holding festivals, attending parties and receptions with their pet dogs, cats and monkeys, dancing and singing, enjoying food and drink, and playing games. The ancient Egyptians were also known for their engaging sense of humor, much like their modern descendants.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another important continuity during this period is the Egyptian attitude toward foreigners—those they considered not fortunate enough to be part of the community of <i>rmṯ</i> or &#34;the people&#34; (i.e., Egyptians.) This attitude was facilitated by the Egyptians&#39; more frequent contact with other peoples during the New Kingdom, when Egypt expanded to an empire that also encompassed <a href="/wiki/Nubia" id="w">Nubia</a> through <a href="/wiki/Jebel_Barkal" id="w">Jebel Barkal</a> and parts of the <a href="/wiki/Levant" id="w">Levant</a>. The Egyptian sense of superiority was given religious validation, as foreigners in the land of <i>Ta-Meri</i> (Egypt) were anathema to the maintenance of Maat—a view most clearly expressed by the <a href="/wiki/Ipuwer_papyrus" id="w">admonitions of Ipuwer</a> in reaction to the chaotic events of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Intermediate_Period_of_Egypt" id="w">Second Intermediate Period</a>.

<p>The ancient Egyptians used a solar calendar that divided the year into 12 months of 30 days each, with five extra days added. As with nearly every other aspect of Egyptian society, the calendar revolved around the annual <a href="/wiki/Nile" id="w">Nile</a> Inundation (<i>akh.t</i>), the first of three seasons into which the year was divided. The other two were Winter and Summer, each lasting for four months. The modern Egyptian <i><a href="/wiki/Fellah" id="w">fellahin</a></i> calculate the agricultrual seasons, with the months still bearing their ancient names, in much the same manner. The importance of the Nile in Egyptian life, ancient and modern, cannot be overemphasized. The rich alluvium carried by the Nile inundation were the basis of Egypt&#39;s formation as a society and a state. Regular inundations were a cause for celebration; low waters often meant famine and starvation. The ancient Egyptians personified the river flood as the god <a href="/wiki/Hapy" id="w">Hapy</a> and dedicated a <i>Hymn to the Nile</i> to celebrate it. <i>km.t</i>, the Black Land, was as <a href="/wiki/Herodotus" id="w">Herodotus</a> observed, &#34;the gift of the river.&#34;</p>
<a id="Nubian_Rule_period" name="Nubian_Rule_period"></a><h3>Nubian Rule period</h3>
<p>Kush invaded and controlled Egypt itself for a period (the Ethiopian dynasty). They held sway over their northern neighbors for nearly 100 years. The Nubian kingdom to the south took full advantage of this division and political instability. Prior to Piye&#39;s Year 20 campaign into Egypt, the previous Nubian ruler – Kashta – had already extended his kingdom&#39;s influence over into Thebes when he compelled Shepenupet, the serving Divine Adoratice of Amun and Takelot III&#39;s sister, to adopt his own daughter Amenirdis, to be her successor. Then, 20 years later, around 732 BC his successor, Piye, marched North and defeated the combined might of several native Egyptian rulers such as Peftjaubast, Osorkon IV of Tanis, and Tefnakht of Sais. Piye established the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty and appionted the defeated rulers as his provincial governors. He was succeeded first by his brother, Shabaka, and then by his two sons Shebitku and Taharqa.Eventually the Kushites were defeated by the invading Assyrians. They retreated further south and established their capital at Meroë.</p>

When Alexander died, a story began to circulate that Nectanebo II, the last indigenous monarch, was Alexander&#39;s father. This made Alexander in the eyes of the Egyptians a legitimate heir to the native pharaohs.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> Alexander may have been hailed as a liberator for freeing Egypt from <a href="/wiki/Persian_Empire" id="w">Persian</a> <a href="/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire" id="w">Achaemenid rule</a>, but his <a href="/wiki/Macedon" id="w">Macedonian</a> successors, however, did not live up to his legacy as they proved to be no better than the previous <a href="/wiki/History_of_Egypt_under_Achaemenid_Persian_domination" id="w">Persian rulers in Egypt</a>. The Ptolemies exploited Egypt for their own benefit and a great social divide was created whereby Egyptians were reduced to second-class citizens.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Frequent revolting by the Egyptians against the Greeks took place under <a href="/wiki/Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes" id="w">Ptolemy V Epiphanes</a> (205 − 180 BC),  whose coronation had earlier been commemorated by erecting a <a href="/wiki/Stele" id="w">stele</a> inscribed in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greek" id="w">Greek</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs" id="w">hieroglyphic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)" id="w">demotic</a> <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_language" id="w">Egyptian</a>.

<p>But while Egyptians lost their national independence to the Macedonian Greeks, the priesthood continued to wield power as they had during the dynastic age. Under the Ptolemies, Egyptians practiced their religion undisturbed and largely maintained their own separate communities from their foreign conquerors.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> The Ptolemaic rulers all retained their Greek names and titles, but projected a public image of being Egyptian pharaohs. Much of this period&#39;s vernacular literature was composed in the <a href="/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)" id="w">demotic</a> phase and script of the Egyptian language. It was focused on earlier stages of Egyptian history when Egyptians were independent and ruled by those they viewed as great native pharaohs such as <a href="/wiki/Ramesses_II" id="w">Ramesses II</a>. Many prophetic writings circulated among Egyptians promising expulsion of the Greeks.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> The language of administration became <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a>, but the mass of the Egyptian population was <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_language" id="w">Egyptian</a>-speaking and concentrated in the countryside, while most Greeks lived in Alexandria and only few had any knowledge of Egyptian.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> A revival in animal cults, the hallmark of the Predyanstic and Early Dyanstic periods, is said to have come about as Egyptians became increasingly disillusioned and sickened by successive waves of foreign invasions.

When the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Romans</a> annexed Egypt in 30 BC, the social structure created by the Greeks was largely retained, though the power of the Egyptian priesthood diminished. The Roman emperors lived abroad and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship as the Ptolemies had. Egypt became further stratified with Romans at the apex of the social pyramid, <a href="/wiki/Greek_people" id="w">Greeks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jews" id="w">Jews</a> in the middle, and Egyptians, who constituted the vast majority, at the bottom. At one point, the Roman emperor <a href="/wiki/Caracalla" id="w">Caracalla</a> advocated the expulsion of all ethnic Egyptians from the city of Alexandria, saying &#34;genuine Egyptians can easily be recognized among the linen-weavers by their speech.&#34;<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> This attitude lasted until AD <a href="/wiki/212" id="w">212</a> when Roman citizenship was granted to all the inhabitants of Egypt, though ethnic divisions remained largely entrenched.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> The Romans, like the Ptolemies had before them, treated Egypt like their own private property, a land exploited for the benefit of a small foreign elite.

 The cult of <a href="/wiki/Isis" id="w">Isis</a>, like those of <a href="/wiki/Osiris" id="w">Osiris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Serapis" id="w">Serapis</a>, had been popular in Egypt and throughout the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Roman Empire</a> at the coming of Christianity, and continued to be the main competitor with Christianity in its early years.

The feast of the coming of the Lord of Egypt on June 1 became an important part of Christian Egyptian tradition.

 St. Mark is said to have founded the Holy Apostolic See of Alexandria and to have become its first <a href="/wiki/List_of_Coptic_Popes" id="w">Patriarch</a>. Within 50 years of St. Mark&#39;s arrival in Alexandria, a fragment of <a href="/wiki/New_Testament" id="w">New Testament</a> writings appeared in <a href="/wiki/Oxyrhynchus" id="w">Oxyrhynchus</a> (Bahnasa), which suggests that Christianity already began to spread south of Alexandria at an early date. By the mid-third century, a sizable number of Egyptians were persecuted by the Romans on account of having adopted the new Christian faith, beginning with the Edict of <a href="/wiki/Decius" id="w">Decius</a>. Christianity was tolerated in the Roman Empire until AD 284, when the Emperor <a href="/wiki/Diocletian" id="w">Diocletian</a> persecuted and put to death a great number of Christian Egyptians. This event became a watershed in the history of Egyptian Christianity, marking the beginning of a distinct Egyptian or <a href="/wiki/Coptic_Christianity" id="w">Coptic Church</a>. It became known as the &#39;Era of the Martyrs&#39; and is commemorated in the <a href="/wiki/Coptic_calendar" id="w">Coptic calendar</a> in which dating of the years began with the start of Diocletian&#39;s reign. When Egyptians were persecuted by Diocletian, many retreated to the desert to seek relief. The practice precipitated the rise of <a href="/wiki/Monasticism" id="w">monasticism</a>, for which the Egyptians, namely <a href="/wiki/Anthony_the_Great" id="w">St. Antony</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pachomius" id="w">St. Bakhum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saint_Shenouda_the_Archimandrite" id="w">St. Shenouda</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saint_Amun" id="w">St. Amun</a>, are credited as pioneers.

 the threshold of the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" id="w">Byzantine</a> period, the New Testament had been entirely translated into Coptic. But while Christianity continued to thrive in Egypt, the old pagan beliefs which had survived the test of time were facing mounting pressure. The Byzantine period was particularly brutal in its zeal to erase any traces of ancient Egyptian religion. Under emperor <a href="/wiki/Theodosius_I" id="w">Theodosius I</a>, Christianity had already been proclaimed the religion of the Empire and all pagan cults were forbidden. When Egypt fell under the jurisdiction of <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" id="w">Constantinople</a> after the split of the Roman Empire, many ancient Egyptians temples were either destroyed or converted into monasteries.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the defining moments in the history of the Church in Egypt is a controversy that ensued over the nature of Jesus Christ which culminated in the final split of the Coptic Church from both the Byzantine and Roman Catholic Churches. The <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Chalcedon" id="w">Council of Chalcedon</a> convened in AD 451, signaling the Byzantine Empire&#39;s determination to assert its hegemony over Egypt. When it declared that Jesus Christ was of two natures embodied in Christ&#39;s person, the Egyptian reaction was swift, rejecting the decrees of the Council as incompatible with the <a href="/wiki/Miaphysitism" id="w">Miaphysite</a> doctrine of Coptic Orthodoxy. The Copts&#39; upholding of the Miaphysite doctrine against the pro-Chalcedonian Greek <a href="/wiki/Melkite" id="w">Melkites</a> had both theological and national implications. As Coptologist Jill Kamil notes, the position taken by the Egyptians &#34;paved [the way] for the Coptic church to establish itself as a separate entity...No longer even spiritually linked with Constantinople, theologians began to write more in Coptic and less in Greek. <a href="/wiki/Coptic_art" id="w">Coptic art</a> developed its own national character, and the Copts stood united against the imperial power.&#34;<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>

 <a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Islamic</a> tradition in Egypt, similar to its Christian predecessor, traces its history to an earlier encounter with the new faith. It begins with Muhammad&#39;s union with the Egyptian lady Maria (subsequently &#39;Mother of the Believers&#39;)—an event believed by Egyptian Muslims as having led Muhammad to draft and sign a document ensuring the protection of the Copts when the Arabs conquered Egypt.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> Later, the story of the Muslim wresting of Egypt from the Byzantines would circulate among Muslim Egyptians as having been foretold in the <a href="/wiki/Qur%26%2339%3Ban" id="w">Quranic</a> injunction, &#34;Come into Egypt safely, as God wills it&#34; (Yusuf 12:99). Egyptians were known to the <a href="/wiki/Arab" id="w">Arabs</a> as Copts—a word believed to be a corruption of the Greek <i>Aiguptios</i> (Egyptian). Hence, throughout the early Islamic period, Egyptians in Arabic texts were often referred to as <a href="/wiki/Copts" id="w">Copts</a> (qib{{Unicode}} or qub{{Unicode}}), who continued in the majority to be Christian and <a href="/wiki/Coptic_language" id="w">Coptic</a>-speaking for centuries, though in the early years it also applied to the native community that had embraced Islam.</p>
<p>Just before the Arab conquest, the Byzantine Emperor <a href="/wiki/Heraclius" id="w">Heraclius</a> was able to reclaim Egypt after a brief Persian invasion in AD 616. He subsequently appointed <a href="/wiki/Cyrus_of_Alexandria" id="w">Cyrus of Alexandria</a>, a Chalcedonian, as Patriarch. Cyrus was determined to convert the Egyptian Miaphysites by any means. He expelled Coptic monks and bishops from their monasteries and sees. Many died in the chaos, and the resentment of the Egyptians against their Byzantine conquerors reached a peak.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> Meanwhile, the new religion of <a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Islam</a> was making headway in <a href="/wiki/Arabia" id="w">Arabia</a>, culminating in the <a href="/wiki/Muslim_conquests" id="w">Muslim conquests</a> that took place following <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" id="w">Muhammad</a>&#39;s death.

The relationship between the Greek Melkites and the Egyptian Copts had grown so bitter that many Egyptians hailed the Arabs as liberators from Byzantine tyranny,<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> ironically much as they had done nearly a thousand years earlier when their ancestors welcomed the Macedonian <a href="/wiki/Greeks" id="w">Greeks</a> to free them from the <a href="/wiki/Persian_people" id="w">Persians</a>. </p>

Egyptians continued to worship freely so long as they paid the <a href="/wiki/Jizya" id="w">jizya</a> poll tax levied by the Arabs, and the authority of the Miaphysite doctrine of the Coptic Church was nationally recognized. It was not long, however, before the relationship between the Egyptians and their Arab conquerors began to deteriorate. Initially, many Egyptians readily embraced Islam in the wake of the bitter conflict that ensued between the Coptic and Byzantine Churches. But soon, increased taxation by the Arabs became heavier, leading many Christians to adopt Islam in order to escape the jizya in addition to a land tax that had also been imposed on all Egyptians.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> According to <a href="/wiki/Ya%26%2339%3Bqubi" id="w">al-Ya&#39;qubi</a>, repeated revolts by Egyptian Christians against the Arabs took place in the 8th and 9th centuries under the reign of the <a href="/wiki/Umayyad" id="w">Umayyads</a> and <a href="/wiki/Abbasid" id="w">Abbasids</a>.

 In the years to follow the Arab occupation of Egypt, a social hierarchy was created whereby Egyptians who converted to Islam acquired the status of <a href="/wiki/Mawali" id="w">mawali</a> or &#34;clients&#34; to the ruling Arab elite, while those who remained Christian, the Copts, became <a href="/wiki/Dhimmis" id="w">dhimmis</a>. In time, however, the power of the Arabs waned throughout the <a href="/wiki/Islamic_Caliphate" id="w">Islamic Empire</a> so that in the 10th century, the Turkish <a href="/wiki/Ikhshidid_dynasty" id="w">Ikhshids</a> were able to take control of Egypt and made it an independent political unit from the rest of the empire. Egyptians continued to live socially and politically separate from their foreign conquerors, but their rulers like the Ptolemies before them were able to stabilize the country and bring renewed economic prosperity. It was under the <a href="/wiki/Shi%26%2339%3Ba_Islam" id="w">Shiite</a> <a href="/wiki/Fatimid" id="w">Fatimids</a> from the 10th to the 12th centuries that Muslim Egyptian institutions began to take form along with the <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_Arabic" id="w">Egyptian dialect</a> of Arabic, which was to eventually supplant native Egyptian or Coptic as the spoken language. <a href="/wiki/Al-Azhar" id="w">Al-Azhar</a> was founded in AD 970 in the new capital <a href="/wiki/Cairo" id="w">Cairo</a>, not very far from its ancient predecessor in Memphis. It became the preeminent Muslim center of learning in Egypt and by the <a href="/wiki/Ayyubid_dynasty" id="w">Ayyubid</a> period it had acquired a Sunni orientation. The Fatimids with some exceptions were known for their religious tolerance and their observance of local Muslim, Coptic and indigenous Egyptian festivals and customs. Under the Ayyubids, the country for the most part continued to prosper until it fell to the <a href="/wiki/Mamluk" id="w">Mamluks</a>. </p>
<p>The Mamluk period (AD 1258-1517) is generally regarded as one under which Egyptians, Muslims and Copts, greatly suffered. Copts were forcibly converted to Islam in greater numbers following the <a href="/wiki/Crusade" id="w">Crusader</a> assaults on Egypt. By the 15th century most Egyptians had already been converted to Islam, while Coptic Christians were reduced to a minority.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> The Mamluks were mainly ethnic <a href="/wiki/Circassians" id="w">Circassians</a> and <a href="/wiki/Turkish_people" id="w">Turks</a> who had been captured as slaves then recruited into the army fighting on behalf of the Islamic empire. Native Egyptians were not allowed to serve in the army until the reign of <a href="/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt" id="w">Mohamed Ali</a>. Historian James Jankwoski writes:</p>

 under the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Turks" id="w">Ottoman Turks</a> from the 16th to the 18th centuries lived within a social hierarchy similar to that of the Mamluks, Arabs, Romans, Greeks and Persians before them. Native Egyptians applied the term <i>atrak</i> (<a href="/wiki/Turkish_people" id="w">Turks</a>) indiscriminately to the Ottomans and Mamluks, who were at the top of the social pyramid, while Egyptians, most of whom were farmers, were at the bottom. Frequent revolts by the Egyptian peasantry against the Ottoman-Mamluk <a href="/wiki/Bey" id="w">Beys</a> took place throughout the 18th century, particularly in Upper Egypt where the peasants at one point wrested control of the region and declared a separatist government.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup> The only segment of Egyptian society which appears to have retained a degree of power during this period were the Muslim <b>ulama<i> or religious scholars, who directed the religious and social affairs of the native Egyptian population and interceded on their behalf when dealing with the Turko-Circassian elite. Egyptians, as Muslims, were part of a wider Islamic community, yet they held on to their national identity in the face of repeated invasions in the course of nearly 2000 years. Some Egyptian writers in the Ottoman period who wrote about the history of Egypt include Ibn Zunbul, el-Bakri, el-Is{{Unicode}}aqi and el-Sharqawi.</i></b></p>

 Egyptian history is generally believed to begin with the <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France#The Egyptian expedition of 1798–99" id="w">French expedition</a> in Egypt led by <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France" id="w">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> in 1798. The <a href="/wiki/French_people" id="w">French</a> defeated a Mamluk-Ottoman army at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Pyramids" id="w">Battle of the Pyramids</a>, and soon they were able to seize control of the country. The French occupation was short-lived, ending when <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" id="w">British</a> troops drove out the French in 1801. Its impact on the social and cultural fabric of Egyptian society, however, was tremendous. To be sure, the Egyptians were deeply hostile to the French, whom they viewed as yet another foreign occupation to be resisted. At the same time, the French expedition introduced Egyptians to the ideals of the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" id="w">French Revolution</a> which were to have a significant influence on their own self-perception and realization of modern independence. When Napoleon invited the Egyptian <i>ulama</i> to head a French-supervised government in Egypt, for some, it awakened a sense patriotism and a desire for national independence from the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Turks" id="w">Turks</a>. In addition, the French introduced the printing press in Egypt and published its first newspaper. The monumental catalogue of Egypt&#39;s ecology, society and economy, <i><a href="/wiki/Description_de_l%26%2339%3BEgypte_(1809)" id="w">Description de l&#39;Égypte</a></i>, was written by scholars and scientists who accompanied the French army on their expedition. </p>
<p>The withdrawal of French forces from Egypt left a power vacuum that was filled after a period of political turmoil by <a href="/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt" id="w">Mohammed Ali</a>, an Ottoman officer of <a href="/wiki/Albanians" id="w">Albanian</a> descent. He rallied support among the Egyptians until he was elected by the native Muslim <i>ulama</i> as governor of Egypt. Mohammed Ali is credited for having undertaken a massive campaign of public works, including irrigation projects, agricultural reforms and the cultivation of cash crops (notably <a href="/wiki/Cotton" id="w">cotton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rice" id="w">rice</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sugarcane" id="w">sugar-cane</a>), increased industrialization, and a new educational system—the results of which are felt to this day. In order to consolidate his power in Egypt, Mohammed Ali worked to eliminate the Turko-Circassian domination of administrative and army posts. For the first time since the Roman period, native Egyptians filled the junior ranks of the country&#39;s army. The army would later conduct military expeditions in the <a href="/wiki/Levant" id="w">Levant</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sudan" id="w">Sudan</a> and against the <a href="/wiki/Wahhabism" id="w">Wahabis</a> in <a href="/wiki/Arabia" id="w">Arabia</a>.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> Many Egyptians student missions were sent to <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> in the early 19th century to study at European universities and acquire technical skills such as printing, shipbuilding and modern military techniques. One of these students, whose name was Rifa&#39;a et-Tahtawy, was the first in a long line of intellectuals that started the modern Egyptian Renaissance.</p>

 period between 1860 − 1940 was most characterized by a <i>nahda</i>, renaissance or rebirth of a distinct Egyptian history, culture and language. It is best known for the renewed interest in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">Egyptian antiquity</a> and the cultural achievements that were inspired by it. Along with this interest came an indigenous, Egypt-centered orientation, particularly among the Egyptian intelligentsia that would affect Egypt&#39;s autonomous development as a sovereign and independent nation-state.</p>
<p>The first modern self-conscious expression of Egyptian patriotism came in the mid-19th century from the Egyptian intellectual <a href="/wiki/Rifa%26%2339%3Ba_et-Tahtawi" id="w">Rifa&#39;a et-Tahtawi</a>. Tahtawi was born in 1801 in a village south of <a href="/wiki/Asyut" id="w">Asyut</a>, the same year the French troops evacuated Egypt. He was an <a href="/wiki/Al-Azhar_University" id="w">Azharite</a> recommended by his teacher and mentor Hassan el-Attar to be the chaplain of a group of students Mohammed Ali was sending to <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> in 1826. According to Tahtawi&#39;s memoir <i>Rihla</i> (Journey to Paris), he read works by <a href="/wiki/Étienne_Bonnot_de_Condillac" id="w">Condillac</a>, <a href="/wiki/Voltaire" id="w">Voltaire</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" id="w">Rousseau</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Secondat%2C_baron_de_Montesquieu" id="w">Montesquieu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Étienne_B%C3%A9zout" id="w">Bezout</a> among others during his sojourn in <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> In 1831, Tahtawi returned home in Egypt to undertake a career in journalism, education and translation. He founded the School of Languages in 1835 which had a great impact on the emerging Egyptian intellectual milieu. Three of his published volumes are works of political and moral <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" id="w">philosophy</a> in which he introduces his Egyptian audience to <a href="/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" id="w">Enlightenment</a> ideas such as <a href="/wiki/Secularism" id="w">secular</a> authority and political rights and liberty; his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or &#34;good Egyptian&#34;; and his ideas on public interest and public good.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup></p>

 self-government, education, and the continued plight of Egypt&#39;s peasant majority deteriorated most significantly under British occupation. Slowly, an organized national movement for independence began to form. In its beginnings, it took the form of an Azhar-led religious reform movement that was more concerned with the social conditions of Egyptian society. It gathered momentum between 1882 and 1906, ultimately leading to a resentment against European occupation.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> Sheikh <a href="/wiki/Muhammad_Abduh" id="w">Muhammad Abduh</a>, the son of a Delta farmer who was briefly exiled for his participation in the Urabi revolt and a future Azhar <a href="/wiki/Mufti" id="w">Mufti</a>, was its most notable advocate. Abduh called for a reform of Egyptian Muslim society and formulated the <a href="/wiki/Modernism" id="w">modernist</a> interpretations of <a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Islam</a> that took hold among younger generations of Egyptians. Among these were <a href="/wiki/Mustafa_Kamil" id="w">Mustafa Kamil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ahmed_Lutfi_el-Sayed" id="w">Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed</a>, the architects of modern Egyptian nationalism. Mustafa Kamil had been a student activist in the 1890s involved in the creation of a secret nationalist society that called for British evacuation from Egypt. He was famous for coining the popular expression, &#34;If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one.&#34;</p>

 nationalist sentiment reached a high point after the 1906 <a href="/wiki/Dinshaway_Incident" id="w">Dinshaway Incident</a>, when following an altercation between a group of British soldiers and Egyptian farmers, four of the farmers were hanged while others were condemned to public flogging. Dinshaway, a watershed in the history of Egyptian anti-<a href="/wiki/Colonialism" id="w">colonial</a> resistance, galvanized Egyptian opposition against the British, culminating in the founding of the first two political parties in Egypt: the secular, liberal <i>Umma</i> (the Nation, 1907) headed by <a href="/wiki/Ahmed_Lutfi_el-Sayed" id="w">Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed</a>, and the more radical, pro-Islamic <i>Watani</i> Party (Nationalist Party, 1908) headed by Mustafa Kamil. Lutfi was born to a family of farmers in the Delta province of <a href="/wiki/Ad_Daqahliyah" id="w">Daqahliya</a> in <a href="/wiki/1872" id="w">1872</a>. He was educated at al-Azhar where he attended lectures by Mohammed Abduh. Abduh came to have a profound influence on Lutfi&#39;s reformist thinking in later years. In 1907, he founded the Umma Party newspaper, el-Garida, whose statement of purpose read: &#34;El-Garida is a purely Egyptian party which aims to defend Egyptian interests of all kinds.&#34;<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Both the People and Nationalist parties came to dominate Egyptian politics until <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a>, but the new leaders of the national movement for independence following four arduous years of war (in which <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" id="w">Great Britain</a> declared Egypt a British <a href="/wiki/Protectorate" id="w">protectorate</a>) were closer to the secular, liberal principles of <a href="/wiki/Ahmed_Lutfi_el-Sayed" id="w">Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed</a> and the People&#39;s Party.

 Zaghlul held several ministerial positions before he was elected to the Legislative Assembly and organized a mass movement demanding an end to the British Protectorate. He garnered such massive popularity among the Egyptian people that he came to be known as &#39;Father of the Egyptians&#39;. When on March 8, 1919 the British arrested Zaghlul and his associates and exiled them to <a href="/wiki/Malta" id="w">Malta</a>, the Egyptian people staged their <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_Revolution_of_1919" id="w">first modern revolution</a>. Demonstrations and strikes across Egypt by students, civil servants, merchants, peasants, workers, religious leaders; by Egyptian women; by Copts as well as Muslims became such a daily occurrence that normal life was brought to a halt.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup> The uprising in the Egyptian countryside was more violent, involving attacks on British military installations, civilian facilities and personnel. By the end of March, it was apparent that the Wafd had gained countrywide support leading <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> to issue a unilateral declaration of Egyptian independence on February 22, 1922.</p>
<p>The Wafd Party drafted a <a href="/wiki/1923_Constitution_of_Egypt" id="w">new Constitution in 1923</a> based on a <a href="/wiki/Parliamentary_system" id="w">parliamentary</a> representative system. Egyptian independence at this stage was provisional, as British forces continued to be physically present on Egyptian soil. Saad Zaghlul became the first popularly-elected Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924, and in 1936 the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Egyptian_Treaty_of_1936" id="w">Anglo-Egyptian Treaty</a> was concluded. Many cultural and economic developments accompanied the inter-war period.

 the parliamentary monarchy, Egypt reached the peak of its modern intellectual Renaissance that was started by Rifa&#39;a el-Tahtawy nearly a century earlier. The most prominent Egyptian thinkers and writers of modern history belonged to this period. Among those who set the intellectual tone of a newly independent Egypt, in addition to <a href="/wiki/Muhammad_Abduh" id="w">Muhammad Abduh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ahmed_Lutfi_el-Sayed" id="w">Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed</a>, were <a href="/wiki/Qasim_Amin" id="w">Qasim Amin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Muhammad_Husayn_Haykal" id="w">Muhammad Husayn Haykal</a>, <a href="/wiki/Taha_Hussein" id="w">Taha Hussein</a>, <a href="/wiki/Abbas_Al-Akkad" id="w">Abbas el-&#39;Akkad</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tawfiq_al-Hakeem" id="w">Tawfiq el-Hakeem</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Salama_Moussa" id="w">Salama Moussa</a>. They delineated a liberal outlook for their country expressed as a commitment to individual freedom, <a href="/wiki/Secularism" id="w">secularism</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Evolution" id="w">evolutionary</a> view of the world and faith in science to bring progress to human society.<sup id="_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#_note-90" title="">[90]</a></sup> This period was looked upon with fondness by future generations of Egyptians as a <a href="/wiki/Golden_Age" id="w">Golden Age</a> of Egyptian liberalism, openness, and an Egypt-centered attitude that put the country&#39;s interests center stage. </p>
<p>When Egyptian novelist and <a href="/wiki/Noble_Prize" id="w">Noble Prize</a> laureate <a href="/wiki/Naguib_Mahfouz" id="w">Naguib Mahfouz</a> died in 2006, many Egyptians felt that perhaps the last of the Greats of Egypt&#39;s golden age had passed away.

 involvement by the <a href="/wiki/Farouk_of_Egypt" id="w">King</a> in parliamentary affairs, government corruption, and the widening gap between the country&#39;s rich and poor led to the eventual toppling of the monarchy and the dissolution of the parliament through a <i><a href="/wiki/Coup_d%26%2339%3B%C3%A9tat" id="w">coup d&#39;état</a></i> by a group of <a href="/wiki/Free_Officers_Movement" id="w">army officers</a> in 1952. The Egyptian Republic was declared on June 18, 1953 with General <a href="/wiki/Muhammad_Naguib" id="w">Muhammad Naguib</a> as the first President of the Republic. After Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 and later put under house arrest by <a href="/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser" id="w">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a>, the real architect of the 1952 movement, mass protests by Egyptians erupted against the forced resignation of what became a popular symbol of the new régime.<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup> Nevertheless, Nasser assumed <a href="/wiki/Political_power" id="w">power</a> as President and began a <a href="/wiki/Nationalization" id="w">nationalization</a> process that initially had profound effects on the socioeconomic strata of Egyptian society. According to one historian, &#34;Egypt had, for the first time since 343 BC, been ruled not by a Macedonian <a href="/wiki/Greek_people" id="w">Greek</a>, nor a <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Roman</a>, nor an <a href="/wiki/Arabs" id="w">Arab</a>, nor a <a href="/wiki/Turkish_people" id="w">Turk</a>, but by an Egyptian.&#34;<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup></p>

 <a href="/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak" id="w">Mohamed Hosni Mubarak</a> has been the <a href="/wiki/President_of_Egypt" id="w">President of the Republic</a> since <a href="/wiki/October_14" id="w">October 14</a> <a href="/wiki/1981" id="w">1981</a>, currently serving his fifth term in office. Although power is ostensibly organized under a <a href="/wiki/Multi-party_system" id="w">multi-party</a> <a href="/wiki/Semi-presidential_system" id="w">semi-presidential system</a>, in practice it rests almost solely with the President. In late February 2005, Mubarak announced in a surprise television broadcast that he had ordered the reform of the country&#39;s presidential election law, paving the way for multi-candidate polls. For the first time since the 1952 coup d&#39;état, the Egyptian people had an apparent chance to elect a leader from a list of various candidates. However, the new law placed draconian restrictions on the filing for presidential candidacies, designed to prevent well-known candidates such as <a href="/wiki/Ayman_Nour" id="w">Ayman Nour</a> from standing against Mubarak, and paved the road for his easy re-election victory. </p>
<p>Most Egyptians today are skeptical about the process of <a href="/wiki/Democratization" id="w">democratization</a> and fear that power may ultimately be transferred to the President&#39;s first son, <a href="/wiki/Gamal_Mubarak" id="w">Gamal Mubarak</a>. Newspapers, however, have since exhibited an increasing degree of freedom in criticizing the President. In 2003, the <a href="/wiki/Kifaya" id="w">Egyptian Movement for Change</a> or simply <i>Kifaya</i> was founded as a grassroots mobilization of Egyptians from different socioeconomic, political and religious backgrounds seeking a return to democracy, a transparent government and greater equality and freedom. </p>
<p>The long road to Egyptian independence took more than 20 centuries to achieve, and for many Egyptians it is still a work in progress. Egyptians have endured as a people for more than 5,000 years thanks in large part to Egypt&#39;s unique geography. They take pride in their pharaonic heritage and in their descent from one of mankind&#39;s earliest civilizations.</p>

<a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2>Culture</h2>
<p>{{main}}
Egyptian culture boasts five millennia of recorded history. <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">Ancient Egypt</a> was among the earliest and greatest civilizations during which the Egyptians maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Near_East" id="w">Near East</a> and <a href="/wiki/Africa" id="w">Africa</a>. After the Pharaonic era, the Egyptians themselves came under the influence of <a href="/wiki/Hellenistic_civilization" id="w">Hellenism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coptic_Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Muslim_culture" id="w">Islamic</a> culture. Today, many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture exist in interaction with newer elements, including the influence of modern <a href="/wiki/Western_culture" id="w">Western culture</a>, itself with roots in Ancient Egypt.</p>
<a id="Surnames" name="Surnames"></a><h3>Surnames</h3>

<p>It is common for people of Egyptian origins to have surnames beginning with &#34;Ba/Be&#34; which is the <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_language" id="w">Egyptian</a> masculine singular definite article; for example, <a href="/wiki/Tamer_Bayoumi" id="w">Bayoumi</a> بيومي (&#34;of the sea&#34;, i.e. Lower Egyptian) (variations: Baioumi, Bayoumi, Baioumy), Bashandi بشندي , Bakhum باخوم (&#34;the eagle&#34;), Bekhit, Bahur (&#34;of <a href="/wiki/Horus" id="w">Horus</a>&#34;) and Banoub بانوب (&#34;of <a href="/wiki/Anubis" id="w">Anubis</a>&#34;). The name Shenouda شنوده, which is very common among <a href="/wiki/Copt" id="w">Copts</a> (e.g., it is the name of the present <a href="/wiki/Shenouda_III" id="w">Egyptian Pope</a> as well as that of one of the Coptic Church&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Saint_Shenouda_the_Archimandrite" id="w">foremost saints</a>), means &#34;God is living&#34;. Hence names, and many <a href="/wiki/Toponym" id="w">toponyms</a>, may end with -nouda or -nuti which is the Egyptian word for God. In addition, Egyptian families often derive their name from places in Egypt, such as el-Minyawi المنياوي from <a href="/wiki/Al_Minya_Governorate" id="w">Minya</a> and <a href="/wiki/Suyuti" id="w">Suyuti</a> السيوطي from <a href="/wiki/Asyut" id="w">Asyut</a>; or from one of the local <a href="/wiki/Sufi" id="w">Sufi</a> orders such as el-Shazli الشاذلي and el-Sawy الصاوي.</p>
<p>With the adoption of Christianity and eventually Islam, Egyptians began to take on names associated with these religions. Many Egyptian surnames also became <a href="/wiki/Hellenization" id="w">Hellenized</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arabization" id="w">Arabized</a>, meaning they were altered to sound <a href="/wiki/Greek_language" id="w">Greek</a> or <a href="/wiki/Arabic_language" id="w">Arabic</a>. This was done by the addition of the Greek suffix <i>-ios</i> to Egyptian names; for example, Bakhum &#62; Pachomios; or by adding the Arabic definite article <i>el</i> (Classical Arabic <i>al</i>) to names such as Baymoui &#62; el-Bayoumi. Names starting with the Egyptian affix <i>bu</i> (&#34;place&#34;) were often Arabized to <i>abu</i> (&#34;father of&#34;); for example, <a href="/wiki/Busiri" id="w">Busiri</a> بوصيري (&#34;of the place of <a href="/wiki/Osiris" id="w">Osiris</a>&#34;) occasionally became Abusir and al-Busiri. Some people might also have surnames like el-Shami الشامي (&#34;the Levantine&#34;) indicating a possible Levantine origin, or Turkish Dawidar دويدار, an Ottoman-Mamluk remnant. Conversely, some Levantines might carry the surname el-Masri (&#34;the Egyptian&#34;) suggesting a possible Egyptian extraction. The Egyptian peasantry, the fellahin, are often likely to retain indigenous names with little to no change given their relative isolation throughout the country&#39;s history.</p>
