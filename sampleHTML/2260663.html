<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Lambert was educated at <a href="/wiki/Cheltenham" id="w">Cheltenham</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oxford" id="w">Oxford</a>, where he became friends with filmmakers <a href="/wiki/Karel_Reisz" id="w">Karel Reisz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lindsay_Anderson" id="w">Lindsay Anderson</a>. At Oxford he also founded, together with Reisz and Anderson, the short-lived but influential journal, <i>Sequence</i>, which he co-edited with Anderson. From 1949 to 1955 he edited the periodical <i><a href="/wiki/Sight_and_Sound" id="w">Sight and Sound</a></i>, with Anderson as a regular contributor. At about the same time Lambert was deeply involved in Britain&#39;s Free Cinema movement which called for more social realism in contemporary movies. He also wrote <a href="/wiki/Film_criticism" id="w">film criticism</a> for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sunday_Times_(UK)" id="w">The Sunday Times</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" id="w">The Guardian</a></i>. In 1957 he moved to <a href="/wiki/Hollywood" id="w">Hollywood</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" id="w">California</a>, in order to work there as a screenwriter and personal assistant to director <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Ray" id="w">Nicholas Ray</a>, whose movie <i>Bitter Victory</i> (1957) he co-wrote.

<p>Lambert became a notable screenwriter of the Hollywood studio era. In 1954, while still living in England, he wrote his first <a href="/wiki/Screenplay" id="w">screenplay</a>, <i>Another Sky</i>, about the sexual awakening of a prim English woman in <a href="/wiki/North_Africa" id="w">North Africa</a>. In 1955, he also directed <i>Another Sky</i> in <a href="/wiki/Morocco" id="w">Morocco</a>. This was followed in 1958 by the Hollywood screenplay, <i>Bitter Victory</i> and in 1960 by <i>Sons and Lovers</i>. The latter, for which Lambert gained an <a href="/wiki/Academy_Awards" id="w">Academy Award</a> nomination, is based on a novel by <a href="/wiki/D._H._Lawrence" id="w">D. H. Lawrence</a>. <a href="/wiki/The_Roman_Spring_of_Mrs._Stone" id="w">The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone</a> (1961), adapted a novella by <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" id="w">Tennessee Williams</a> on the affairs of an older actress with a young Italian <a href="/wiki/Gigolo" id="w">gigolo</a>. As, from the 1920s through the late 1960s, <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality" id="w">homosexuality</a> was rarely portrayed on the screen, gay screenwriters like Lambert learned to express their personal sensibilities discreetly between the lines of a film. &#34;The important thing to remember about &#39;gay influence&#39; in movies,&#34; observed Gavin Lambert, &#34;is that it was obviously never direct. It was all subliminal. It couldn&#39;t be direct because the mass audience would say, Hey, no way.&#34; It was not until 1965 that Lambert adapted his own Hollywood insider novel <i>Inside Daisy Clover</i> (1963) for the screen. <i>Clover</i>, starring <a href="/wiki/Natalie_Wood" id="w">Natalie Wood</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Redford" id="w">Robert Redford</a>, tells the cautionary tale of a teenage movie star involved in the Hollywood studio system of the 30&#39;s and her unhappy marriage to a closeted gay leading man. However, in the film version he was not fully identified as gay because at Redford&#39;s request, the husband he played was changed from homosexual to appear as though he might be bisexual. From this time on, Lambert and Wood became lifelong friends. Another of Lambert&#39;s screenplays was <i>I Never Promised You a Rose Garden</i> (1977), based on a novel by <a href="/wiki/Hannah_Green" id="w">Hannah Green</a>, which describes in layman&#39;s terms a <a href="/wiki/Teenager" id="w">teenager</a>&#39;s battle with <a href="/wiki/Schizophrenia" id="w">schizophrenia</a>. Later, the author also wrote the scripts for some TV movies such as <i>Second Serve</i> (1986) on <a href="/wiki/Transgender" id="w">transgender</a> <a href="/wiki/Tennis" id="w">tennis</a> player <a href="/wiki/Renee_Richards" id="w">Renee Richards</a> and <i>Liberace: Behind the Music</i> (1988) on gay performer <a href="/wiki/Liberace" id="w">Liberace</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>, he contributed to <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Frears" id="w">Stephen Frears</a>&#39;s film <i>A Personal History of British Cinema</i>. He was heavily quoted in William J. Mann&#39;s book, <i>Behind the Screen: How Gays and Lesbians Shaped Hollywood, 1910-1969.</i></p>

<p>Lambert was also a noted biographer and novelist, who focused his efforts on biographies of gay and lesbian figures in Hollywood. According to screenwriter and cinema Professor <a href="/wiki/Joseph_McBride" id="w">Joseph McBride</a>, he was &#34;a keenly observant, wryly witty chronicler of Hollywood&#39;s social mores and artistic achievements.&#34; He wrote biographies on some Hollywood stars, such as <i>On Cukor</i> (1972) on gay <a href="/wiki/Film_director" id="w">film director</a> <a href="/wiki/George_Cukor" id="w">George Cukor</a> and <i>Norma Shearer: A Life</i> (1990) on the Canadian actress <a href="/wiki/Norma_Shearer" id="w">Norma Shearer</a>. His book, <i>Nazimova: A Biography</i> (1997) was the first full-scale account of the private life and acting career of <a href="/wiki/Lesbian" id="w">lesbian</a> actress <a href="/wiki/Alla_Nazimova" id="w">Alla Nazimova</a>. He was the author of the memoir <i>Mainly About <a href="/wiki/Lindsay_Anderson" id="w">Lindsay Anderson</a></i> (2000) and wrote seven <a href="/wiki/Novel" id="w">novels</a> primarily with Hollywood settings, among them <i>The Slide Area: Scenes of Hollywood Life</i> (1959), a collection of seven short stories that portray a bevy of tinsel-town lowlifes, <i><a href="/wiki/Inside_Daisy_Clover" id="w">Inside Daisy Clover</a></i> (1963), <i>The Goodbye People</i> (1971) about Hollywood&#39;s beautiful people, and <i>Running Time</i> (1982), a portrait of an indefatigable woman from child starlet to screen goddess, but also a unique life history of the American film industry. In 1996, Lambert wrote the introduction to <i>3 Plays</i>, a collection of works by his longtime friend, <a href="/wiki/Mart_Crowley" id="w">Mart Crowley</a>.</p>
<p>His final biography, <i>Natalie Wood: A Life</i> (2004) supplied an insider&#39;s look at actress <a href="/wiki/Natalie_Wood" id="w">Natalie Wood</a> and chronicled everything concerning her life, as Lambert was a Wood friend for 16 years.The book was praised by Natalie Wood&#39;s daughter, Natasha Gregson Wagner, as &#34;a wonderful biography on my Mom. It will be the definitive biography on my mother.&#34; Lambert&#39;s biography includes Wood&#39;s relationship with <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" id="w">Elvis Presley</a>, and interviews with the people who knew Wood best, such as <a href="/wiki/Robert_Wagner" id="w">Robert Wagner</a>, <a href="/wiki/Warren_Beatty" id="w">Warren Beatty</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Mazursky" id="w">Paul Mazursky</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Leslie_Caron" id="w">Leslie Caron</a>. In his book, Lambert controversially claimed that Wood frequently dated gay and bisexual men, including director <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Ray" id="w">Nicholas Ray</a> and actors <a href="/wiki/Nick_Adams" id="w">Nick Adams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Raymond_Burr" id="w">Raymond Burr</a>, <a href="/wiki/James_Dean" id="w">James Dean</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tab_Hunter" id="w">Tab Hunter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scott_Marlowe" id="w">Scott Marlowe</a>. Lambert said he was <a class="externallink" href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,12589,1533971,00.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,12589,1533971,00.html">also</a> involved with Ray and that Wood supported homosexual playwright Mart Crowley (a later lover of Lambert&#39;s) in a manner that made it possible for him to write his play, <a href="/wiki/The_Boys_in_the_Band_(play)" id="w">The Boys in the Band</a> (1968). Lambert&#39;s final book was <i>The Ivan Moffat File: Life Among the Beautiful and Damned in London, Paris, New York and Hollywood</i> (2004). </p>
