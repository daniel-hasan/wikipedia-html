<a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h1> Plot </h1>
<p>In the style of a traditional musical, this episode follows a two-<a href="/wiki/Act_(theatre)" id="w">act</a> structure<sup id="_ref-blog1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog1" title="">[1]</a></sup> – with the acts separated by a <a href="/wiki/Commercial_break" id="w">commercial break</a> instead of an <a href="/wiki/Intermission" id="w">intermission</a>. However, in the style of a traditional <i>Scrubs</i> episode, this is preceded by a <a href="/wiki/Cold_open" id="w">cold open</a>. </p>
<a id="Cold_open" name="Cold_open"></a><h2> Cold open </h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/J.D._(Scrubs)" id="w">J.D.</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elliot_Reid" id="w">Elliot</a> are in the park, when a woman, Patti Miller (D&#39;Abruzzo), abruptly falls unconscious. As she returns to consciousness, she sees Elliot, J.D., and a worried group of onlookers singing to her (&#34;All Right&#34;). When she tries to respond, she sings too. In reality, no one is actually singing; Ms. Miller is hallucinating. She drifts out of consciousness, and wakes up being wheeled out an ambulance in the parking lot of <a href="/wiki/Sacred_Heart_Hospital" id="w">Sacred Heart Hospital</a>, with all the hospital employees singing to her, &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_Musical#Welcome_to_Sacred_Heart" id="w">Welcome to Sacred Heart</a>,&#34; led by <a href="/wiki/Bob_Kelso" id="w">Dr. Kelso</a>.</p>
<a id="Act_One" name="Act_One"></a><h2> Act One </h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Cox" id="w">Dr. Cox</a> tells J.D. he believes Ms. Miller is suffering from a <a href="/wiki/Psychology" id="w">psychological</a> problem (as opposed to a <a href="/wiki/Neurology" id="w">neurological</a> one), and tells him to run some tests and &#34;turf her to <a href="/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital" id="w">psych</a>.&#34;  <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Turk" id="w">Turk</a> and J.D. approach Ms. Miller for a stool sample, explaining that &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_Musical#Everything_Comes_Down_to_Poo" id="w">Everything Comes Down to Poo</a>.&#34;</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Carla_Espinosa" id="w">Carla</a> has brought Isabella to the hospital, and everyone is cooing over the new baby, when Elliot comes in and announces happily that she just bought a new house. Turk exits with Isabella, and Elliot expresses concern that J.D. thinks he&#39;s moving into the house with Elliot. Carla has decided to take one year <a href="/wiki/Parental_leave" id="w">parental leave</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Laverne_Roberts" id="w">Laverne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ted_Buckland" id="w">Ted</a>, and The Worthless Peons wonder how they can go on at the hospital without Carla&#39;s help (<a href="/wiki/My_Musical#Gonna_Miss_You,_Carla" id="w">&#34;Gonna Miss You, Carla&#34;</a>). Carla begins to realize that she does not want to separate herself from her work for so long.</p>
<p>Ms. Miller stops Dr. Cox in the hall to insist that she is not crazy, when they are interrupted by J.D. Cox breaks into a rapid-fire delivery (<a href="/wiki/My_Musical#The_Rant_Song" id="w">The Rant Song&#34;</a>) of the litany of annoying things J.D. does, with some help from <a href="/wiki/Janitor_(Scrubs)" id="w">Janitor</a>. Dr. Cox tells Ms. Miller that if she can get J.D. to leave him alone, she&#39;ll get the tests she wants. Ms. Miller yells at J.D., and an impressed Dr. Cox agrees to schedule a <a href="/wiki/Computed_tomography" id="w">CT scan</a>.</p>
<p>Elliot and Carla worry about the difficult conversations they have to have with J.D. and Turk, respectively (&#34;Options&#34;). In the Act One finale (<a href="/wiki/My_Musical#When_the _Truth_Comes_Out" id="w">When the Truth Comes Out&#34;</a>), all the plotlines come together. Dr. Kelso offers Carla her job back, but she worries how to tell Turk. Elliot worries how to tell J.D. he&#39;s not moving in. And Ms. Miller goes in for her CT scan, which turns up a gigantic <a href="/wiki/Aneurysm" id="w">aneurysm</a> in her <a href="/wiki/Temporal_lobe" id="w">temporal lobe</a>. Dr. Cox breaks the news to Ms. Miller before the act break.</p>
<a id="Act_Two" name="Act_Two"></a><h2> Act Two </h2>
<p>Carla and Elliot decide to confront Turk and J.D. Carla thinks that Turk and J.D. will help each other through the respective problems, but Elliot believes that men cannot be open about their feelings. Quite the contrary, Turk and J.D. sing about their &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_Musical#Guy_Love" id="w">Guy Love</a>.&#34;  Elliot breaks the news to J.D., who walks out of the room, refusing to talk to her. Carla tells Turk she wants to return to work. Turk responds by saying, &#34;I always thought family was the most important thing to <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Rican" id="w">Puerto Ricans</a>.&#34; She becomes angry, singing that &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_Musical#For_the_Last_Time,_I&#39;m_Dominican" id="w">For the Last Time, I&#39;m Dominican</a>&#34;. Turk tries to explain himself, and finally, agrees to support her decision. Elliot catches up with J.D., feeling awful, and offers to let him move in. He declines, and tells her they&#39;ll be &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_Musical#Friends Forever/What&#39;s Going to Happen" id="w">Friends Forever</a>.&#34;</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Ms. Miller, with shaved head, being prepared for surgery.</div></div>

Ms. Miller interrupts them, afraid about her upcoming surgery, and asks, &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_Musical#Friends Forever/What&#39;s Going to Happen" id="w">What&#39;s Going to Happen?</a>&#34; The staff of Sacred Heart reassure her that she will be fine, which J.D. qualifies with &#34;we hope,&#34; as she goes under <a href="/wiki/Anesthesia" id="w">anesthesia</a>.</p>
<p>When she awakes, she finds that the surgery was a success. She no longer hears singing. J.D. reflects in voiceover that after having made a choice, we may miss the way things were; as Elliot realizes she misses her roommate, Carla realizes she misses her daughter, and Ms. Miller realizes she misses the music.</p>
<a id="Production_details" name="Production_details"></a><h1> Production details </h1>
<p>It had long been a dream in the <i>Scrubs</i> writers&#39; room to do a musical episode. <i>Scrubs</i> creator <a href="/wiki/Bill_Lawrence_(producer)" id="w">Bill Lawrence</a> is a self-confessed musical theatre &#34;nerd,&#34; as are many of the writers.<sup id="_ref-timeout_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timeout" title="">[2]</a></sup> In addition, many of the cast members have had backgrounds in musical theatre. According to Lawrence, &#34;I knew that <a href="/wiki/Donald_Faison" id="w">Donald [Faison</a>] and <a href="/wiki/Judy_Reyes" id="w">Judy [Reyes</a>] were Broadway-style singers and dancers. I knew <a href="/wiki/Sarah_Chalke" id="w">Sarah [Chalke</a>] could dance, because she danced when she was young. I knew <a href="/wiki/Zach_Braff" id="w">Zach [Braff</a>] loved musical theater. I had actually seen <a href="/wiki/Ken_Jenkins" id="w">Ken Jenkins</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Big_River_(musical)" id="w">Big River</a></i> on Broadway when I was a kid. <a href="/wiki/Neil_Flynn" id="w">Neil Flynn</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_C._McGinley" id="w">John C. McGinley</a> were the last two guys to admit that they&#39;d done a lot of musicals and stuff, but being actors, they had. Johnny C. knew how to do a <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_and_Sullivan" id="w">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> number, and Neil had a big <a href="/wiki/Baritone" id="w">baritone</a> voice.&#34;<sup id="_ref-tvguide_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tvguide" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Scrubs</i> had previously dabbled in the musical genre, including a <i><a href="/wiki/West_Side_Story" id="w">West Side Story</a></i> parody in the episode &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_Way_or_the_Highway" id="w">My Way or the Highway</a>,&#34; and a Broadway-style finale in &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_Philosophy" id="w">My Philosophy</a>.&#34; However, Lawrence had long been unwilling to do full musical episode, because of difficulties making it &#34;organic to the show,&#34;<sup id="_ref-tvguide_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tvguide" title="">[3]</a></sup> and because of the amount of work that would inevitably be involved.<sup id="_ref-timeout_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timeout" title="">[2]</a></sup> Finally, at the end of Season 5, with Season 6 looking like it would probably be the last season; Lawrence told the writers that if they were ever going to do a musical episode, it should be in Season 6.<sup id="_ref-blog1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Long-time <i>Scrubs</i> writer Deb Fordham took the challenge, and contacted the show&#39;s medical consultant, Jonathan Doris, who provided her with several case studies,<sup id="_ref-podcast_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup> one of which (&#34;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/inside.asp?AID=1173&#38;UID=" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/inside.asp?AID=1173&#38;UID=">Musical hallucinations associated with seizures originating from an intracranial aneurysm</a>,&#34; published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings) became the basis for Ms. Miller&#39;s condition.<sup id="_ref-timeout_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timeout" title="">[2]</a></sup> Unlike most episodes, which were products of the entire writers&#39; room, &#34;My Musical&#34; was written almost entirely by Fordham - including most of the lyrics, even though Fordham had never written lyrics.<sup id="_ref-blog1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The music, however, was not written by Fordham, but rather by several composers, including Paul Perry (a member of The Worthless Peons), <i>Scrubs</i> composer Jan Stevens, and Tony Award-winner Doug Besterman, each of whom helped write and arrange several songs. But, perhaps the most notable contributors were Jeff Marx and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Lopez" id="w">Robert Lopez</a>, the writers of hit Broadway musical <i>Avenue Q</i>. Marx and Lopez&#39;s involvement came at the suggestion of Braff, who overheard Fordham asking producer Randall Winston if it would be possible to get actual Broadway composers to work on the episode.<sup id="_ref-blog1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Fordham did have some contribution to the music, in the form of <a href="/wiki/Musical_genre" id="w">musical genre</a> suggestions, but during the actual composition process, she and the composers were almost never in the same room.<sup id="_ref-blog1_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Intriguingly, the casting of Stephanie D&#39;Abruzzo was done entirely independently of her starring role in <i>Avenue Q</i>. Fordham wrote the part of Ms. Miller with D&#39;Abruzzo in mind after seeing her in the off-Broadway show <i><a href="/wiki/I_Love_You_Because" id="w">I Love You Because</a></i>, after D&#39;Abruzzo had left <i>Avenue Q</i>.<sup id="_ref-playbilldiva_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-playbilldiva" title="">[5]</a></sup> In another coincidence, D&#39;Abruzzo had long been a fan of the show, and was overjoyed to have the chance to be on it.<sup id="_ref-blog2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog2" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Will Mackenzie was suggested by Fordham to direct the episode, because of his Broadway experience as Cornelius Hackle in <i><a href="/wiki/Hello%2C_Dolly!_(musical)" id="w">Hello, Dolly!</a></i> during the show&#39;s original Broadway run, opposite <a href="/wiki/Carol_Channing" id="w">Carol Channing</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-podcast_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The filming of the episode was, as expected, a long process. Prior to the episode, the cast underwent a full week of rehearsals, something never before done for a <i>Scrubs</i> episode.<sup id="_ref-blog1_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog1" title="">[1]</a></sup> A group of eight core dancers were brought in for the dance numbers, while over fifty dancers were involved in the &#34;Welcome To Sacred Heart&#34; scene. There are some notable cameos in the episode, including episode composer Jeff Marx as a pharmacist in &#34;Gonna Miss You, Carla;&#34; occasional <i>Scrubs</i> musical contributor <a href="/wiki/Keren_DeBerg" id="w">Keren DeBerg</a> as an extra in &#34;Are You Okay?&#34;; and Broadway actress <a href="/wiki/Karen_Ziemba" id="w">Karen Ziemba</a> (a friend of Mackenzie&#39;s) as the neurologist.<sup id="_ref-podcast_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup> Further complicating matters was the fact that Judy Reyes had recently fractured her pelvis,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> and so had to film all her scenes sitting down, and not dancing.<sup id="_ref-podcast_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup> The bald cap D&#39;Abruzzo wore during the end of the episode took four hours to put on, and she described it as very uncomfortable.<sup id="_ref-blog2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog2" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Welcome_to_Sacred_Heart" name="Welcome_to_Sacred_Heart"></a><h2> Welcome to Sacred Heart </h2>
<p>&#34;Welcome to Sacred Heart&#34; was composed by Fordham, Marx, Lopez, and Besterman<sup id="_ref-podcast_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-playbill_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-playbill" title="">[9]</a></sup> Fordham considers &#34;Welcome To Sacred Heart&#34; to be Dr. Kelso&#39;s song; Kelso (and especially Jenkins&#39; performance of Kelso) being Sacred Heart&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Orbach" id="w">Jerry Orbach</a>/<a href="/wiki/Robert_Preston_(actor)" id="w">Robert Preston</a>-type showman, as in &#34;<a href="/wiki/Lullaby_of_Broadway_(song)" id="w">Lullaby of Broadway</a>&#34; from <i><a href="/wiki/42nd_Street_(musical)" id="w">42nd Street</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-blog1_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog1" title="">[1]</a></sup> &#34;Be Our Guest&#34; from <i><a href="/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(1991_film)" id="w">Beauty and the Beast</a></i> was also cited as an influence.<sup id="_ref-blog1_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Filming the sequence involved over 50 extras<sup id="_ref-podcast_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Busby_Berkeley" id="w">Busby Berkeley</a>-style top shot kaleidoscopic choreography - which was achieved with a crane-mounted camera.<sup id="_ref-podcast_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup> Dr. Cox <a href="/wiki/Jump_rope" id="w">jumps rope</a> during this scene because McGinley cannot dance.</p>
<a id="Everything_Comes_Down_to_Poo" name="Everything_Comes_Down_to_Poo"></a><h2> Everything Comes Down to Poo </h2>
<p>&#34;Everything Comes Down to Poo&#34; was composed by Fordham, Marx, Lopez, and Besterman.<sup id="_ref-podcast_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-playbill_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-playbill" title="">[9]</a></sup>  The inspiration for the song came when one of the show&#39;s medical advisors, Jonathan Doris, shared his observation with Fordham that stool samples seemed to be asked for at hospitals no matter what was being diagnosed. The number was the latter of two music videos released by NBC on <a href="/wiki/YouTube" id="w">YouTube</a> in advance of the episode&#39;s airdate - the other video being &#34;Guy Love.&#34;<sup id="_ref-variety_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-variety" title="">[10]</a></sup> The videos have since been removed from YouTube, but are still available on <a class="externallink" href="http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/video/index.shtml" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/video/index.shtml">NBC&#39;s official &#39;&#39;Scrubs&#39;&#39; site</a>.</p>
<p>The song&#39;s lyrics underwent many changes, in order to find the right level of vulgarity. The initial version was much more &#34;genteel,&#34; while later versions included references to &#39;turtleheads&#39; and other slang for <a href="/wiki/Feces" id="w">feces</a>;<sup id="_ref-podcast_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup> as was the line &#34;It may sound gross, it may sound crass, but we need to see what comes out of your ass;&#34; which was changed to &#34;It may sound gross, you might say shush, but we need to see what comes out of your tush.&#34;<sup id="_ref-blog3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog3" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Gonna_Miss_You%2C_Carla" name="Gonna_Miss_You%2C_Carla"></a><h2> Gonna Miss You, Carla </h2>
<p>&#34;Gonna Miss You, Carla&#34; was composed by Fordham and Perry (who sings during the song, as a member of The Worthless Peons).<sup id="_ref-podcast_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup> D&#39;Abruzzo has called this her favorite song in the episode.<sup id="_ref-blog2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog2" title="">[6]</a></sup> Carla sits throughout the song because of Reyes&#39; fractured <a href="/wiki/Pelvis" id="w">pelvis</a>.  According to the album on <a href="/wiki/ITunes" id="w">iTunes</a>, it is the least popular song.</p>
<a id="The_Rant_Song" name="The_Rant_Song"></a><h2> The Rant Song </h2>
<p>&#34;The Rant Song&#34; was composed by Fordham and Perry. The song is a Gilbert and Sullivan-style <a href="/wiki/Patter_song" id="w">patter song</a>, in order to complement Dr. Cox&#39;s normal rapid-fire rants. Bill Lawrence has mentioned &#34;<a href="/wiki/Major-General%26%2339%3Bs_Song" id="w">Major-General&#39;s Song</a>&#34; from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Pirates_of_Penzance" id="w">The Pirates of Penzance</a></i> as a specific influence. &#34;We were mortified because <i><a href="/wiki/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip" id="w">Studio 60</a></i> did [a &#39;Modern Major General&#39; spoof] first.  But theirs isn&#39;t funny.&#34;<sup id="_ref-timeout_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timeout" title="">[2]</a></sup> Fordham has described D&#39;Abruzzo&#39;s section in this song as the episode&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/Patti_LuPone" id="w">Patti LuPone</a> moment.&#34; <sup id="_ref-podcast_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup> Fordham had long been a LuPone fan (which is the reason D&#39;Abruzzo&#39;s character was named Patti Miller).<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Janitor&#39;s section in this song (&#34;It all started with a penny in the door&#34;) refers to an incident in <i>Scrubs<b> pilot, &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_First_Day" id="w">My First Day</a>,&#34; when he became convinced J.D. had broken a door by wedging a penny in it. This incident was the beginning of the antagonism between J.D. and Janitor.</b></i></p>
<a id="When_the_Truth_Comes_Out" name="When_the_Truth_Comes_Out"></a><h2> When the Truth Comes Out </h2>
<p>&#34;When the Truth Comes Out&#34; was composed by Fordham, Marx, and Lopez.<sup id="_ref-podcast_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup> Unlike the other songs in the episode, this song was always intended as a direct parody of a single song: &#34;<a href="/wiki/Songs_from_Les_Mis%C3%A9rables#Do You Hear the People Sing?" id="w">Do You Hear the People Sing?</a>&#34; from <i><a href="/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables_(musical)" id="w">Les Misérables</a></i>. It also serves the same dramatic purpose as &#34;One Day More&#34;: it is a showstopper finale to Act One that reprises all previous songs, summarizes Act One&#39;s events, and teases the events to come in Act Two.<sup id="_ref-blog1_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog1" title="">[1]</a></sup>  Carla does not march during this song, except for a few &#34;painful steps&#34; in this sequence, due to Reyes&#39; aforementioned fractured pelvis.

<a id="Guy_Love" name="Guy_Love"></a><h2> Guy Love </h2>
<p>&#34;Guy Love&#34; was composed by Fordham and Perry.<sup id="_ref-podcast_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup> It was a late addition to the episode, brought on because, according to Bill Lawrence, &#34;All the modern musicals like <i><a href="/wiki/Jekyll_%26amp%3B_Hyde_(musical)" id="w">Jekyll &#38; Hyde</a></i> have these really overwrought love songs, so we really wanted to have one between J.D. and Turk.&#34;<sup id="_ref-timeout_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timeout" title="">[2]</a></sup> It was the hardest song for Fordham to write. She met with Perry for help with the lyrics, and he gave her the <a href="/wiki/Hook_(music)" id="w">hook</a>, &#34;It&#39;s guy love, between two guys.&#34; The writing became easier, but she still wanted a reference to a tender moment between Turk and J.D. She emailed D&#39;Abruzzo, who she knew to be a big fan of the show, &#34;and, no exaggeration, five minutes later, she sent me a list of 30 [moments],&#34;  including Turk performing an <a href="/wiki/Appendectomy" id="w">appendectomy</a> on J.D. in &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_Day_Off" id="w">My Day Off</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-podcast_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup>  </p>

However, this was not the original plan. According to Fordham, &#34;I was really shocked when I got the demo back, because I had never envisioned a &#39;50s number.

<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h1> Reception </h1>
<p>The episode was received very well by critics and audiences alike. Many described initial misgivings that the musical concept would make the episode seem gimmicky,<sup id="_ref-IGN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN" title="">[17]</a></sup> but these fears were, for the most part, put to rest by the fact that the episode was &#34;logically insane;&#34;<sup id="_ref-IGN_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN" title="">[17]</a></sup> the singing came about organically (through the brain aneurysm), and, despite the singing, the episode felt like it fit into the <i>Scrubs</i> continuity. Many noted that the songs fit the characters (like Dr. Cox&#39;s &#34;Rant Song&#34;), and that story arcs actually advanced in the episode (Carla returning to the hospital, and J.D. and Elliot no longer living together).<sup id="_ref-timeout_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-timeout" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-IGN_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-postg_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-postg" title="">[18]</a></sup> On the other hand, others thought the music felt forced.<sup id="_ref-2guys_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2guys" title="">[19]</a></sup> Inevitably, almost all reviews, both positive and negative, compared the episode to <i><a href="/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer" id="w">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></i>‘s musical episode, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Once_More%2C_with_Feeling_(Buffy_episode)" id="w">Once More, with Feeling</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-tvguide_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tvguide" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-IGN_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2guys_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2guys" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-postg_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-postg" title="">[18]</a></sup> This comparison was also made by Bill Lawrence, who credits <i>Buffy</i> for inspiring <i>Scrubs</i>‘ propensity for &#39;big&#39; episodes (such as this one, the <a href="/wiki/Multiple-camera_setup" id="w">multi-camera</a> &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_Life_in_Four_Cameras" id="w">My Life in Four Cameras</a>&#34;, and the <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)" id="w">Wizard of Oz</a></i> parody &#34;<a href="/wiki/My_Way_Home" id="w">My Way Home</a>&#34;).<sup id="_ref-tvguide_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tvguide" title="">[3]</a></sup> The singing abilities of the cast (McGinley and Chalke in particular) came under some fire, but most critics agreed that most were competent, and anything beyond that simply did not matter.<sup id="_ref-zap2it_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-zap2it" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-IGN_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-tvguide_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tvguide" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NYT_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NYT" title="">[21]</a></sup> Reyes and Faison were the only members of the cast (besides the Broadway star D&#39;Abruzzo) to receive praise for their singing abilities. In general, the final assessments were positive. The episode was called &#34;the show&#39;s best episode thus far this season,&#34;<sup id="_ref-zap2it_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-zap2it" title="">[20]</a></sup> &#34;worth all the hype,&#34;<sup id="_ref-IGN_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGN" title="">[17]</a></sup> and &#34;a heck of a lot of fun.&#34;<sup id="_ref-postg_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-postg" title="">[18]</a></sup> Fans of the show also reacted positively, giving the episode, as of December 2007, a 9.0 on <a href="/wiki/TV.com" id="w">TV.com</a><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> and a 9.4 on the <a href="/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database" id="w">Internet Movie Database</a>.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>  The episode is also the most popular download of the sixth season of <i>Scrubs</i> in the <a href="/wiki/ITunes_Store" id="w">iTunes Store</a>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>The episode also received praise from those who worked on it. D&#39;Abruzzo described the experience of being on <i>Scrubs</i> as a &#34;really great experience,&#34; and called the crew &#34;one of the friendliest crews I&#39;ve ever worked with.&#34;<sup id="_ref-blog2_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog2" title="">[6]</a></sup> Marx and Lopez, who had previously had misgivings about working in Hollywood, loved working on the show.<sup id="_ref-blog3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog3" title="">[11]</a></sup> And Chalke described the episode as a unifying experience for the struggling show, mentioning that, for the first time in six years, the entire cast and crew met up to watch the episode together.<sup id="_ref-podcast_u" class="reference"><a href="#_note-podcast" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the 2007 <a href="/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award" id="w">Primetime Emmy Awards</a>, the episode &#34;My Musical&#34; was nominated for five awards in four categories: <a href="/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Directing_for_a_Comedy_Series" id="w">Outstanding Directing For A Comedy Series</a> (Will Mackenzie), Outstanding Original Music And Lyrics (&#34;Everything Comes Down to Poo&#34; and &#34;Guy Love&#34;), Outstanding Music Direction (Jan Stevens), and Outstanding Sound Mixing For A Comedy Or Drama Series (half-hour) And Animation (Joe Foglia, Peter J.
