<b><i>The Hobbit, or There and Back Again</i></b> is a fantasy novel <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> written by <a href="/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien" id="w">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> in the tradition of the <a href="/wiki/Fairy_tale" id="w">fairy tale</a>. It was first published on <a href="/wiki/September_21" id="w">September 21</a>, <a href="/wiki/1937" id="w">1937</a> to wide acclaim. While it stands in its own right, it is often marketed as a prelude to Tolkien&#39;s monumental novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" id="w">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>

<p><i>The Hobbit</i> is set in a time &#34;between the dawn of Faerie and the Dominion of Men&#34;,<sup id="_ref-eaton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-eaton" title="">[4]</a></sup> and follows the quest of home-loving Bilbo Baggins (the &#34;Hobbit&#34; of the title) as he leaves his comedic-rustic village and moves into darker, deeper territory<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> along with the thirteen dwarves and wizard Gandalf. He encounters various denizens of the Wilderland, in order to reach and win his share of Smaug, the Dragon&#39;s, hoard. Through accepting the nature of his &#34;<a href="/wiki/Took_clan" id="w">Tookish</a>&#34; half (a disrespectable, romantic, fey and adventurous side of his family tree) and utilising both his wits and common sense during the quest, Bilbo develops a new level of maturity, competence and wisdom.<sup id="_ref-Matthews_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Matthews" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Synopsis" name="Synopsis"></a><h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a planning party for Thorin&#39;s band of dwarves, whose ambition is to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the <a href="/wiki/Dragon_(Middle-earth)" id="w">Dragon</a> <a href="/wiki/Smaug" id="w">Smaug</a>. During the council Gandalf unveils a map showing a <a href="/wiki/Secret_passage" id="w">secret door</a> into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo be the expedition&#39;s &#34;burglar&#34;. The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, joins despite himself.</p>
<p>The group travels into the wild, where Gandalf saves the company from trolls. Their path takes them into the <a href="/wiki/Misty_Mountains" id="w">Misty Mountains</a>. There they are captured by goblins and driven deep underground. Though Gandalf frees them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblin tunnels. Groping along lost, he finds a <a href="/wiki/One_ring" id="w">ring</a> and encounters Gollum, who engages him in a game of <a href="/wiki/Riddles" id="w">riddles</a>. Bilbo wins, but Gollum, suspecting Bilbo has his precious ring, tries to kill him anyway. With the help of the ring, which confers <a href="/wiki/Invisibility" id="w">invisibility</a>, Bilbo escapes and rejoins the company. His success raises his reputation. Gandalf departs on a private errand, and the rest enter the black forest of <a href="/wiki/Mirkwood" id="w">Mirkwood</a>, where Bilbo first saves the dwarves from giant spiders and then from the dungeons of the <a href="/wiki/Silvan_Elves" id="w">Wood-elves</a>. By this time Bilbo is the de facto leader.</p>
<p>Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the travellers are welcomed by the human inhabitants of Lake-town, who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug&#39;s demise. The expedition travels to the Mountain and finds the secret door; Bilbo scouts the dragon&#39;s lair, stealing a great cup and learning of a weakness in Smaug&#39;s armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town aided the intruder, sets out to destroy the town. A noble <a href="/wiki/Thrush_(bird)" id="w">thrush</a> who overheard Bilbo&#39;s report of Smaug&#39;s vulnerability reports it to Bard the Bowman, who slays the Dragon.</p>
<p>When the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the prized <a href="/wiki/Arkenstone" id="w">Arkenstone</a> gem and hides it away. The Wood-elves and Lake-men besiege the Mountain and request compensation for their aid, reparations for Lake-town&#39;s destruction, and settlement of old claims on the treasure. Thorin refuses and, having summoned his kin from the north, reinforces his position. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to head off a war, but Thorin is intransigent. He banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable.</p>
<p>Gandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men, and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn is the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Five_Armies" id="w">Battle of Five Armies</a> won. Thorin, mortally-wounded, lives long enough to part from Bilbo as friends. The treasure is divided fairly, but, having no need or desire for it, Bilbo refuses most of his contracted share. Nevertheless, he returns home with enough to make himself a very wealthy hobbit.</p>

<a id="Writing" name="Writing"></a><h3>Writing</h3>
<p>In a <a href="/wiki/1955" id="w">1955</a> letter to <a href="/wiki/W._H._Auden" id="w">W. H. Auden</a>, Tolkien recollects that in the late 1920s, when he was Professor of Anglo-Saxon at <a href="/wiki/Pembroke_College%2C_Oxford" id="w">Pembroke College</a>, he began <i>The Hobbit</i> when he was marking School Certificate papers. He found one blank page. Suddenly inspired he wrote the words &#34;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&#34; He did not go any further than that at the time, although in the following years he drew up <a href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_Dwarves#Thrór" id="w">Thrór&#39;s</a> map, outlining the geography of the tale, and by January 1933 had finished the story: <a href="/wiki/C._S._Lewis" id="w">C. S. Lewis</a> read it that month with great enthusiasm. It was eventually published when a family friend and student of Tolkien&#39;s named Elaine Griffiths was lent the typescript of the story in 1936. When Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staffmember of the publisher <a href="/wiki/Allen_%26amp%3B_Unwin" id="w">George Allen &#38; Unwin</a>, she either lent Dagnall the book or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien (the sources are unclear). In any event,  Miss Dagnall, impressed by it, showed the book to <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Unwin_(publisher)" id="w">Stanley Unwin</a>, who then asked his 10-year-old son <a href="/wiki/Rayner_Unwin" id="w">Rayner</a> to review it. Rayner wrote such an enthusiastic review of the book that it was published by <a href="/wiki/Allen_%26amp%3B_Unwin" id="w">Allen &#38; Unwin</a>.</p>

George Allen &#38; Unwin, Ltd. of London published the first edition of <i>The Hobbit</i> on September 21, 1937. It was illustrated with many black-and-white drawings by Tolkien himself. The original printing numbered a mere 1,500 copies and sold out by December due to enthusiastic reviews.<sup id="_ref-hammond-anderson_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hammond-anderson" title="">[7]</a></sup> Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York prepared an American edition to be released early in 1938 in which four of the illustrations would be colour plates. Allen &#38; Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937.<sup id="_ref-hammond-anderson_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hammond-anderson" title="">[7]</a></sup> Despite the book&#39;s popularity, wartime conditions forced the London publisher to print small runs of the remaining two printings of the first edition.</p>
<p>The first printing of the first English language edition can sell for between £6000<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup>  and £20,000 at auction.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> , although the price has occasionally reached over £40,000.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>New <a href="/wiki/English-language_editions_of_The_Hobbit" id="w">English-language editions of &#39;&#39;The Hobbit&#39;&#39;</a> spring up often, despite the book&#39;s age, with at least fifty editions having been published to date. Each comes from a different publisher or bears distinctive cover art, internal art, or substantial changes in format. The text of each generally adheres to the Allen &#38; Unwin edition extant at the time it is published. In addition, the Hobbit has been <a href="/wiki/Translations_of_The_Hobbit" id="w">translated into over forty languages</a>. Some languages have seen multiple translations.</p>
<a id="Revisions" name="Revisions"></a><h4>Revisions</h4>
<p>In December 1937, Tolkien&#39;s publishers asked for a sequel, so the author began work on what would become the much larger <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" id="w">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>.</p>
<p>In the first edition of <i>The Hobbit</i>, Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle-game, and he and Bilbo part amicably.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> During the writing of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> Tolkien saw the need to revise these passages, in order to reflect his new concept of the <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" id="w">ring</a> and its powerful hold on Gollum. Tolkien tried many different passages in the chapter that would become chapter 2 of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, &#34;The Shadow of the Past&#34;. Eventually Tolkien decided a rewrite of the Gollum encounter in <i>The Hobbit</i> was in order, and he sent a revised version to his publishers. He heard nothing further for years. When he was sent <a href="/wiki/Galley_proof" id="w">galley proofs</a> of a new edition he learned to his surprise the new chapter had been incorporated as the result of a misunderstanding <sup id="_ref-carpenter-tolkien_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carpenter-tolkien" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, Tolkien <a href="/wiki/Retcon#Addition" id="w">retroactively establishes</a> that the events of <i>The Hobbit</i> take place during the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Third_Age" id="w">Third Age</a>&#34; of <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth" id="w">Middle-earth</a>,<sup id="_ref-prologue_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-prologue" title="">[13]</a></sup> a fictional prehistoric Earth<sup id="_ref-prologue_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-prologue" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>. He presents himself as the translator of the supposedly historic <i><a href="/wiki/Red_Book_of_Westmarch" id="w">Red Book of Westmarch</a></i>, where Bilbo and <a href="/wiki/Frodo_Baggins" id="w">Frodo</a>&#39;s stories were recorded. In the book&#39;s prologue, as well as in the chapter &#34;The Shadow of the Past&#34;, Tolkien  explains the original version of the riddle-game as a &#34;lie&#34; that Bilbo made up because of the One Ring&#39;s influence on him, and which he originally wrote down in his diary, the basis of <i>The Hobbit</i>. Revised versions of <i>The Hobbit</i> would contain the &#34;true&#34; version of events.<sup id="_ref-prologue_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-prologue" title="">[13]</a></sup> This first revision became the second edition, published in 1951 in both UK and American editions.<sup id="_ref-hammond-anderson_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hammond-anderson" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>After an unauthorised edition of the Lord of the Rings was published by Ace in 1965, Houghton Mifflin and Ballantine  requested Tolkien to provide a new authorised text of the Hobbit, in order to re-assert US copyright control. <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>. This text became the (1966) third edition.  Tolkien took the opportunity to further adjust the narrative to conform with <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and to unpublished <i><a href="/wiki/Quenta_Silmarillion" id="w">Quenta Silmarillion</a></i> as it stood at that time.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup>  These minor changes included, for example, that the phrase <i>elves that are now called <a href="/wiki/Gnome" id="w">Gnomes</a></i> appears in the first<sup id="_ref-Hobbit first edition_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hobbit first edition" title="">[17]</a></sup> and second<sup id="_ref-Hobbit second edition_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hobbit second edition" title="">[18]</a></sup> editions on page 63. Tolkien had used &#34;Gnome&#34; in his earlier writing to refer to the second kindred of the <a href="/wiki/High_Elves" id="w">High Elves</a> – the <a href="/wiki/Noldor" id="w">Noldor</a> (or &#34;Deep Elves&#34;). Tolkien thought that &#34;gnome&#34;, being derived from the Greek <i>gnosis</i> (knowledge), was a good name for the wisest of the Elves, but with its common denotation of a <a href="/wiki/Garden_gnome" id="w">garden gnome</a>, Tolkien ultimately replaced the phrase with <i>High Elves of the West, my kin</i> in the third edition<sup id="_ref-Hobbit third edition_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hobbit third edition" title="">[19]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In its final revision, <i>The Hobbit</i> still retains many differences in tone from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. For example, goblins are more often referred to as Orcs in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Many of the inconsistencies arose because Tolkien wrote the Hobbit as a children&#39;s story having a loose relationship to his mythological writing, only later strengthening the connections through revisions and through its sequel. <sup id="_ref-carpenter-tolkien_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-carpenter-tolkien" title="">[12]</a></sup> Moreover, his concept of Middle-earth was to change and evolve throughout his life and writings.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Publication_of_early_drafts" name="Publication_of_early_drafts"></a><h3> Publication of early drafts </h3>

<p>In May and June 2007, HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin published <i><a href="/wiki/The_History_of_The_Hobbit" id="w">The History of The Hobbit</a></i> in the United Kingdom.  Much like <i><a href="/wiki/The_History_of_Middle-earth" id="w">The History of Middle-earth</a></i>, <i>The History of The Hobbit</i> examines in two volumes previously unpublished original drafts of <i>The Hobbit</i> with extensive commentary by <a href="/wiki/John_Rateliff" id="w">John Rateliff</a>. In celebration and recognition of the 70th anniversary of <i>The Hobbit</i>, <i>The History</i> was published in the United States on September 21, 2007, exactly 70 years after the initial publication of Tolkien&#39;s work.</p>
<a id="Style" name="Style"></a><h2>Style</h2>
<p>The basic form of the story is that of a <a href="/wiki/Quest" id="w">quest</a>, told in <a href="/wiki/Episode" id="w">episodes</a>. Tolkien fills the story with a wealth of incidental detail regarding minor characters and distant events which can make his imaginary world seem to have more depth. The narrative voice often addresses the reader directly, a device which the author himself came to dislike, <sup id="_ref-Carpenter_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carpenter" title="">[22]</a></sup> yet is retained and lessened when Tolkien began in 1966 (and subsequently abandoned) an entire rewrite of <i>The Hobbit</i> to make a better tonal fit with it&#39;s sequel.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup>. In a large part the narrative voice contributes significantly to the success of the novel, and lends it to being read aloud.</p>
<p>The novel draws on Tolkien&#39;s knowledge of historical languages and early European texts, the names of Gandalf and all but one of the thirteen dwarves being taken directly from the <a href="/wiki/Old_Norse" id="w">Old Norse</a> poem &#34;Voluspa&#34; from the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Edda" id="w">Elder Edda</a>.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> and its illustrations (provided by the author) make use of <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_language" id="w">Anglo-Saxon</a> <a href="/wiki/Rune" id="w">runes</a>. The story is filled with information on calendars and moon phases, detailed geographical descriptions that fit well with the accompanying maps — attention to detail that is also found in Tolkien&#39;s later work.</p>
<a id="Major_themes" name="Major_themes"></a><h2>Major themes</h2>

<p>The central character, Bilbo, is a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world, yet the character is able to negotiate and interact within it because of the connections between the modern and antique worlds through language and tradition. Gollum&#39;s riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo from modern nursery books. The familiar form of the riddle-game allows the two characters to discourse, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast in characters&#39; linguistic style leading to an understanding of the deeper unity is a constant recurring theme throughout <i>The Hobbit</i>. <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>The Hobbit</i> may be read as Tolkien&#39;s parable of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">First World War</a>, where the hero is plucked from his rural home, and thrown into a far off war where traditional types of heroism are shown to be futile<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> and as such explores the theme of heroism.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Carl_Jung" id="w">Jungian</a> concept of <a href="/wiki/Individuation" id="w">individuation</a> is reflected through theme of growing maturity and capability, with the author seen to be contrasting Bilbo&#39;s personal growth against the lack of that of the dwarves. <sup id="_ref-Matthews_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Matthews" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Greed plays a central role in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from one or more of the characters simple desire for food (be it trolls eating dwarves, or dwarves eating Wood-elf fare) or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Adaptations" name="Adaptations"></a><h2> Adaptations </h2>
