<a id="Plot_summary" name="Plot_summary"></a><h2>Plot summary</h2>


<p>Poh Huat (Richard Low), the patriarch of the Loh family, works as a lawyer&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Clerk" id="w">clerk</a>. He is married to Siew Luan (Alice Lim), a <a href="/wiki/Housewife" id="w">housewife</a> who obsessively brews <i>liang teh</i> (<a href="/wiki/Herbal_tea" id="w">herbal tea</a>) for the family. Poh Huat has a habit of buying <a href="/wiki/Lottery" id="w">lottery</a> tickets in hope of winning and enjoying a better life. He also keeps newspaper cuttings of <a href="/wiki/Car_model" id="w">car models</a> and <a href="/wiki/Condominium" id="w">condominiums</a> and stores them in a box in his room. </p>
<p>The family has one son, Seng (Dick Su), and one daughter, Mei (Yeo Yann Yann). Despite Mei&#39;s superior academic performance, the family has consistently shown favouritism for Seng. Even though he was ostensibly the academically poorer sibling, dropping out of school in <a href="/wiki/Secondary_education" id="w">Secondary 3</a>, his parents still chose to fund his overseas <a href="/wiki/Polytechnic" id="w">polytechnic</a> education instead of his sister&#39;s further education. Seng is due to return after two years at Idaho Polytechnical University. To fund his overseas studies, apart from his parents, he had to borrow money from his <a href="/wiki/Fianc%C3%A9e" id="w">fiancée</a>, Irene (Serene Chen). Irene, who lives with Seng&#39;s parents while Seng is overseas, yearns to marry Seng and fulfill her dream of the perfect family.</p>
<p>Mei works as a <a href="/wiki/Secretary" id="w">secretary</a> who maintains a friendly working relationship with her boss. Her boss values Mei&#39;s help as a secretary. She is due for <a href="/wiki/Childbirth" id="w">delivery</a> in two months&#39; time, and for <a href="/wiki/Maternity_leave" id="w">maternity leave</a> in a month&#39;s time. Her husband, CK (Lim Yu-Beng), quit the army a month before and began to sell <a href="/wiki/Insurance" id="w">insurance</a> instead, without much success. He is therefore belittled by Mei. Even though they cannot afford it, they go to a condominium <a href="/wiki/Showroom" id="w">showroom</a> to take a look, revealing their aspirations for a more luxurious lifestyle.</p>
<p>Seng returns from the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, and keeps from his family the fact that he has not graduated. Tensions escalate in the family, especially between Mei and Seng, due to the family&#39;s apparent favouritism for Seng. Seng goes for several <a href="/wiki/Job_interview" id="w">job interviews</a>, but companies find it difficult to accept him, since other job candidates hold degrees from prestigious universities. He becomes immensely disappointed, but lies to his family about the sanguinity of his job prospects. Seng eventually decides that he wants to try starting a business. He gains acceptance from his father, who gives him effectively unlimited funding. He also buys a car, without Irene&#39;s knowledge. Upon discovering this, Irene becomes disappointed.</p>
<p>Poh Huat strikes the lottery, winning $2 million. Initially thrilled by his sudden elevation to the higher class, Poh Huat dies suddenly while at a <a href="/wiki/Country_club" id="w">country club</a> for a membership interview. Siew Luan goes into <a href="/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder" id="w">shock</a> as a result. At the <a href="/wiki/Funeral" id="w">funeral</a>, Seng quarrels with Mei over the funeral expenses; Seng feels that Mei is too much of a <a href="/wiki/Scrooge" id="w">scrooge</a> while Mei hits back at Seng for not doing enough work for the funeral. Mei vents her anger on CK, who shows his displeasure by throwing the carton of drinks on the floor.  </p>
<p>Mei is called back to work one afternoon, even though she is still managing the funeral. CK expresses his outrage at this unreasonable request, but Mei says out of frustration, &#34;Singapore is like that, everywhere is like that, [do we have a choice]?&#34; and returns to work. At work, Mei&#39;s boss, frustrated at the new temporary worker, asks Mei to photocopy a stack of notes and brew a cup of coffee for him. Mei flips at the triviality of the task, and becomes very stressed.</p>
<p>Back at the funeral, Mei realizes that $500 has gone missing from the <i>pek kim</i>,{{Ref_label}} and wrongly accuses her <a href="/wiki/Maid" id="w">maid</a>, Pinky, of stealing the money. This accusation is made without evidence, but under extreme stress and desperation for money on Mei&#39;s part. CK reveals shortly after that the money is actually with him. Pinky, indignant at the wrong accusation, spits at Mei. CK goes to a nearby <a href="/wiki/Coffee_shop" id="w">coffee shop</a> for a drink. A Chinese girl approaches him at his table to talk to him, and CK ends up confiding his worries about life. The girl notes, &#34;You Singaporeans are always complaining. Do you think your life is tough?&#34;</p>
<p>While Poh Huat&#39;s funeral is being held, Seng reveals to his family that he, in fact, did not graduate from university. Initially unbeknownst to him, Irene is standing nearby at the door, and hears his confession. Irene is greatly disappointed with Seng, and resolves to leave him.</p>
<p>A few months later, CK and Seng, along with Mei and her newly born son, are called to a lawyer&#39;s office by the daughter of Poh Huat&#39;s former boss. In a last-minute twist of events, it is revealed that Poh Huat&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Will_(law)" id="w">will</a> has been found, and that he had left all his assets to Siew Luan &#8212; a net sum of $1.2 million. Siew Luan is absent from the meeting, so the daughter announces that he gave $300,000 to Mei, and $1,000 to Seng. Meanwhile, at home, Siew Luan hands some money over to Poh Huat&#39;s mistress in a show of benevolence.</p>
<a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2>Development</h2>

<p>The development of <i>Singapore Dreaming</i> began in <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a> when New York-based couple Colin Goh and Woo Yen Yen wrote an essay for <b>Singaporeans Exposed</b>, a publication to commemorate the Singapore International Foundation&#39;s ten-year anniversary. The 5200-word essay, <i>Paved with Good Intentions</i>, explained the difference between the Singapore Dream and the Singapore Plan, and discussed the source and fashion of many Singaporeans&#39; aspirations.  <i>Paved with Good Intentions</i> was later circulated round the <a href="/wiki/Internet" id="w">Internet</a>, where many Singaporeans read the essay.<sup id="_ref-mb_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-stpremiere_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stpremiere" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-blog06_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog06" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Confessional responses the couple received thereafter reached the hundreds. In a <a href="/wiki/Podcast" id="w">podcast</a> with <a href="/wiki/Mrbrown" id="w">mrbrown</a>, Woo explained the typical reader response was &#34;How is it that I now have a house, I now have a car, a job, why I am still unhappy?&#34; The couple &#34;felt a responsibility to do something&#34;, which inspired them to write the film,<sup id="_ref-mb_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup> the original working title of which was <i>The 5Cs</i>.<sup id="_ref-blog90_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog90" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h2>Production</h2>

<p>The film was a number of firsts in the <a href="/wiki/Film_industry" id="w">film industry</a>; <i>Singapore Dreaming</i> was the first Singaporean film to be digitally encoded <i>and</i> projected.<sup id="_ref-blog44_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog44" title="">[10]</a></sup> It was also the first collaboration between Singaporean and New York film-makers; the <a href="/wiki/Director_of_photography" id="w">Director of photography</a> Martina Radwan, <a href="/wiki/Film_editing#Film editor" id="w">editor</a> Rachel Kittner and <a href="/wiki/Sound_designer" id="w">sound designer</a> Paul Hsu were based in New York, along with the production staff, while <a href="/wiki/Film_score" id="w">composer</a> Sydney Tan was based in Singapore.<sup id="_ref-af_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-af" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Singapore Dreaming</i> was an independent, low-budget production, costing only <a href="/wiki/S%24" id="w">S$800</a> 000 in total to produce &#8212; 80% of which was raised by Executive Producer Woffles Wu.<sup id="_ref-dus_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dus" title="">[6]</a></sup> The film was Woffles Wu&#39;s first production, and the Colin Goh&#8211;Woo Yen Yen team&#39;s second.<sup id="_ref-af_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-af" title="">[11]</a></sup> The rigors of production forced Producer Woo Yen Yen to take a no-pay leave from her job as an <a href="/wiki/Assistant_professor" id="w">assistant professor</a>.<sup id="_ref-mb_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-dus_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dus" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Filming began in August <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>,<sup id="_ref-blog43_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog43" title="">[12]</a></sup> with the scenes in the house shot in an actual 3-room <a href="/wiki/Housing_and_Development_Board" id="w">HDB flat</a> in a bid for authenticity. This led to situations in which the cast and crew had to squeeze into the rooms in the  small flat for hours on end. The team also had to endure heat and stuffy conditions, especially during the scene in which the family shared <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Steamboat" id="w">steamboat</a> in the living room.<sup id="_ref-mb_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In an attempt at authenticity and realism, the producers allowed the characters speak in a mix of Hokkien, English and Mandarin, in the typical Singaporean manner. The film would later be <a href="/wiki/Subtitle_(captioning)" id="w">subtitled</a> in English and Mandarin during post-production so that the audience would be able to understand the characters&#39; lexicon without knowing how the average Singaporean speaks.<sup id="_ref-mb_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike in larger productions, the team of directors had to assume numerous roles during the independent production, some of which included the transportation of furniture and buying drinking water for the crew during the shoot. Colin Goh and Steven Chin, the assistant director, also had to take the unusual step of staging a fight to distract curious passers-by and prevent them from gathering round when they were shooting a certain scene.<sup id="_ref-mb_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup>  After the filming was complete, the movie was digitally encoded in New York and digitally projected at a number of select cinemas.<sup id="_ref-blog44_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog44" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Cast" name="Cast"></a><h2>Cast</h2>

<p>A team of local actors composed the cast for <i>Singapore Dreaming</i>. Some casting decisions were made when the producers were penning the script in New York while others were made in Singapore.</p>
<p>The characters of the film were based on the experiences of the people around the writers, that of the writers themselves,<sup id="_ref-mb_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup> and on the e-mail responses that they received to their essay.<sup id="_ref-npintro_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-npintro" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Richard_Low" id="w">Richard Low</a> as Poh Huat</b>: <a href="/wiki/MediaCorp" id="w">MediaCorp</a> actor Richard Low had a role in one of the MediaCorp productions that was filming during the time <i>Singapore Dreaming</i> was set to film. However, he was not engaged as his character in that production was in coma.<sup id="_ref-mb_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup> In the film, Poh Huat is the patriarch of the Loh family. He persistently favours and sides with his son, Seng over his daughter, Mei. Like the rest of the family, he yearns for a better life and, in particular, for a car and a <a href="/wiki/Country_club" id="w">country club</a> membership.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Alice_Lim" id="w">Alice Lim</a> as Siew Luan</b>: Alice Lim was one of the actresses that were cast later. She is the first female <a href="/wiki/MC" id="w">MC</a> for major events in Singapore, and used to be active in the <a href="/wiki/1970s" id="w">1970s</a>. The directors admired her &#39;beautiful&#39; delivery of <a href="/wiki/Min_Nan" id="w">Hokkien</a> in the film.<sup id="_ref-mb_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup> In the film, Siew Luan married Poh Huat when she was young and remained a <a href="/wiki/Housewife" id="w">housewife</a> ever since. She is seen to brew bottles of herbal tea perpetually (for members of the family, which, except for Irene, tend to reject them). She shares part of her life story with the audience as the film concludes.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Serene_Chen" id="w">Serene Chen</a> as Irene</b>: The producers had a good relationship with Serene Chen from their previous work together on an earlier production, <i>3Meals</i>. They planned to cast Serene Chen early on, during the initial script-writing.<sup id="_ref-mb_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup> In the film, Serene plays the live-in fiancée of Seng, Irene. Irene is deeply attached to Seng and hankers for a <a href="/wiki/Marriage" id="w">marriage</a> with him in the beginning of the film. She, together with Poh Huat, funded his overseas studies. Irene is also very close to Siew Luan.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Yeo_Yann_Yann" id="w">Yeo Yann Yann</a> as Mei</b>: Although the producers were unacquainted with Yann Yann, they used her face as a reference when writing for the character, Mei. Back in Singapore, Yann Yann accepted their offer to cast as Mei.<sup id="_ref-mb_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup> In the film, Mei is the underappreciated daughter of the family, married to CK, whom she occasionally henpecks. Indignant that Seng was sent overseas when she was the one whose academic performance was more distinguished, she bears a patent grudge against Seng.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Lim_Yu-Beng" id="w">Lim Yu-Beng</a> as CK</b>: The part of CK was written for Lim Yu-Beng, who agreed to join the film&#39;s production.<sup id="_ref-mb_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup> In the film, CK resigned as an army officer and turned to selling insurance, a career at which he does not appear to be successful.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Dick_Su" id="w">Dick Su</a> as Seng</b>: Dick Su was involved in the production only after Serene Chen brought him in.<sup id="_ref-mb_o" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup> In the film, Seng is the son in the family, who failed in graduating from his overseas studies. There were times when he tries to convince his family, especially his father, that he can succeed in life. Unfortunately, his plans never seem to work out and he ends up disappointing the people around him.</li></ul>

<p>The producers were initially concerned about the small independent film lasting in the cinemas with the influx of <a href="/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States" id="w">American blockbusters</a>. Thus, the producers continually urged on the film&#39;s blog for those interested to watch the film as early as possible, in case of a short theatrical run.<sup id="_ref-blog95_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog95" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-blog100_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog100" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-blog109_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog109" title="">[22]</a></sup> These concerns were mirrored by at least one movie reviewer.<sup id="_ref-tonyreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tonyreview" title="">[23]</a></sup> However, the film&#39;s theatrical run was to continue for eight weeks; it outlasted all other films that opened in the same week.<sup id="_ref-blog125_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog125" title="">[24]</a></sup> After a hiatus of a few weeks, the film reopened transiently at GV VivoCity.<sup id="_ref-blog126_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog126" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<p>The directors, with their limited funds, put print <a href="/wiki/Advertising" id="w">advertisements</a> in local newspapers to advertise the film.

The film was spread around resulting in it being nominated for the film festival.<sup id="_ref-dus_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dus" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The feature film is the first Singaporean film to be in competition for the two awards at the IFFPA-recognized{{Ref_label}} San Sebastian International Film Festival.<sup id="_ref-blog105_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blog105" title="">[36]</a></sup> Moreover, while other Singaporean films (like those directed by <a href="/wiki/Eric_Khoo" id="w">Eric Khoo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Royston_Tan" id="w">Royston Tan</a>) have won awards at other international <a href="/wiki/Film_festival" id="w">film festivals</a> before, those are either not recognized by IFFPA, or are categorized by them as &#34;specialized&#34;. The &#34;specialized&#34; tag means that, as <i>The Straits Times</i> explains, &#34;they focus on a particular aspect of film or film-making&#34;. The film thus has the added honour of being the first Singaporean film to receive an award at an IFFPA-recognised international feature film festival.<sup id="_ref-dus_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dus" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>On Sunday, 28 October 2007 Singapore Dreaming snagged the Best Asian/Middle-Eastern Film Award at the 20th Tokyo International Film Festival, beating competing films such as Exodus by Hong Kong director Pang Ho Cheung and starring Simon Yam; Breath by South Korean auteur Kim Ki-duk; Mad Detective by Hong Kong&#39;s Johnny To; and A Few Days Later by Iranian superstar Niki Karimi. The Tokyo International Film Festival is one of the world&#39;s most important film festivals, and Singapore Dreaming is the first Singapore feature to win this award. [Channel News Asia/TODAY]</p>
<a id="Soundtrack" name="Soundtrack"></a><h2>Soundtrack</h2>

<p>The <i>Singapore Dreaming</i> <a href="/wiki/Film_score" id="w">soundtrack</a> was released by BooBao Records in June <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>.<sup id="_ref-mxsoundtrack_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mxsoundtrack" title="">[37]</a></sup> It comprises various songs and tunes that were featured in the movie, most of which were composed by the music director for the film, Sydney Tan.<sup id="_ref-sydney_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sydney" title="">[38]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Hough" id="w">Stephen Hough</a> is also listed as one of the soundtrack&#39;s composers. The soundtrack album, containing both emotive and entertaining pieces, shows a variation in the mood of the songs.<sup id="_ref-mxsoundtrack_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mxsoundtrack" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Of particular prominence in the soundtrack is the <a href="/wiki/1933" id="w">1933</a> <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" id="w">Taiwanese</a> song &#34;Bong Chun Hong&#34;. As the producers were writing the script in New York, Woo Yen Yen called her mother to ask her about the most popular song of her time. Her mother&#39;s first suggestion was &#34;Bong Chun Hong&#34;, a song which the producers came to like.<sup id="_ref-mb_s" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mb" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-imdbtrivia_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-imdbtrivia" title="">[39]</a></sup> The song was later adopted as the opening theme, and the character Siew Luan would hum it again as the film concludes, this time more wistfully as she would recount the days when she was young. The internet trailer also features two renditions of the song, a vocal and a <a href="/wiki/Piano" id="w">piano</a> rendition.<sup id="_ref-bannedtrailer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bannedtrailer" title="">[40]</a></sup> Four major and three minor variations of &#34;Bong Chun Hong&#34; were included in the soundtrack.<sup id="_ref-jeffyen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-jeffyen" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#34;Bong Chun Hong&#34; is so popular in Taiwan that it has been described as &#34;their unofficial second national anthem&#34;.<sup id="_ref-imdbtrivia_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-imdbtrivia" title="">[39]</a></sup> As Moviexclusive describes Sydney Tan&#39;s score, &#34;the […] use of pianos and <a href="/wiki/String_instrument" id="w">strings</a> is complemented by the occasional wistful accompaniments of the traditional <a href="/wiki/Erhu" id="w">erhu</a>, adding the essential &#39;Asian touch&#39; to the music.&#34;<sup id="_ref-mxsoundtrack_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mxsoundtrack" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>The film&#39;s soundtrack also includes two songs by the local <a href="/wiki/Band_(music)" id="w">band</a> <a href="/wiki/Ronin_(band)" id="w">Ronin</a>, &#34;Black Maria&#34; and &#34;Memories&#34;. It also includes &#34;Mei Man Ren Sheng&#34;, a song that shares its title with the film. The tune was rearranged by Sydney Tan and performed by Nicole Lai, with lyrics in <a href="/wiki/Chinese_language" id="w">Chinese</a> by Ng King Kang. The film&#39;s producer, Woffles Wu, did the <a href="/wiki/Backing_vocalist" id="w">backing vocals</a> for the recording.<sup id="_ref-mxsoundtrack_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mxsoundtrack" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
