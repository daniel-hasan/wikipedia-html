<a id="Apparent_sharp_focus" name="Apparent_sharp_focus"></a><h2> Apparent sharp focus </h2>

<p>Precise focus is possible at only one distance; at that distance, a point object will produce a point image.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>
At any other distance, a point object is <i><a href="/wiki/Defocus" id="w">defocused</a></i>, and will produce a blur spot shaped like the <a href="/wiki/Aperture" id="w">aperture</a>, which for the purpose of analysis is usually assumed to be circular. When this circular spot is sufficiently small, it is indistinguishable from a point, and appears to be in focus; it is rendered as &#8220;acceptably sharp&#8221;. The diameter of the circle increases with distance from the point of focus; the largest circle that is indistinguishable from a point is known as the <i>acceptable <a href="/wiki/Circle_of_confusion" id="w">circle of confusion</a></i>, or informally, simply as the <i>circle of confusion</i>. The acceptable circle of confusion is influenced by visual acuity, viewing conditions, and the amount by which the image is enlarged. The increase of the circle diameter with defocus is gradual, so the limits of depth of field are not hard boundaries between sharp and unsharp.</p>
<p>Several other factors, such as subject matter, movement, and the distance of the subject from the camera, also influence when a given defocus becomes noticeable.</p>

For a <a href="/wiki/35_mm_film" id="w">35&#160;mm</a> motion picture, the image area on the negative is roughly 22&#160;mm by 16&#160;mm (0.87&#160;in by 0.63&#160;in). The limit of tolerable error is usually set at 0.05&#160;mm (0.002&#160;in) diameter. For <a href="/wiki/16_mm_film" id="w">16&#160;mm&#160;film</a>, where the image area is smaller, the tolerance is stricter, 0.025&#160;mm (0.001&#160;in). Standard depth-of-field tables are constructed on this basis, although generally 35&#160;mm productions set it at 0.025&#160;mm (0.001&#160;in). Note that the acceptable circle of confusion values for these formats are different because of the relative amount of magnification each format will need in order to be projected on a full-sized movie screen.</p>
<p>(A table for 35&#160;mm still photography would be somewhat different since more of the film is used for each image and the amount of enlargement is usually much less.)</p>

</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Film_format" id="w">image format</a> size also will affect the depth of field. The larger the format size, the longer a lens will need to be to capture the same framing as a smaller format. In motion pictures, for example, a frame with a 12 degree horizontal field of view will require a 50&#160;mm lens on 16&#160;mm film, a 100&#160;mm lens on 35&#160;mm film, and a 250&#160;mm lens on 65&#160;mm film. Conversely, using the same focal length lens with each of these formats will yield a progressively wider image as the film format gets larger: a 50&#160;mm lens has a horizontal field of view of 12&#160;degrees on 16&#160;mm film, 23.6&#160;degrees on 35&#160;mm film, and 55.6&#160;degrees on 65&#160;mm film. What this all means is that because the larger formats require longer lenses than the smaller ones, they will accordingly have a smaller depth of field. Therefore, compensations in exposure, framing, or subject distance need to be made in order to make one format look like it was filmed in another format.</p>

<p>For a given subject framing, the DOF is controlled by the lens <a href="/wiki/F-number" id="w">f-number</a>. Increasing the <var>f</var>-number (reducing the <a href="/wiki/Aperture" id="w">aperture</a> diameter) increases the DOF; however, it also reduces the amount of light transmitted, and increases <a href="/wiki/Diffraction" id="w">diffraction</a>, placing a practical limit on the extent to which the aperture size may be reduced. Motion pictures make only limited use of this control; to produce a consistent image quality from shot to shot, cinematographers usually choose a single aperture setting for interiors and another for exteriors, and adjust exposure through the use of camera filters or light levels.  Aperture settings are adjusted more frequently in still photography, where variations in depth of field are used to produce a variety of special effects.</p>
<a id="Camera_movements_and_DOF" name="Camera_movements_and_DOF"></a><h2>Camera movements and DOF</h2>

<p>When the lens axis is perpendicular to the image plane, as is normally the
case, the plane of focus (POF) is parallel to the image plane, and the DOF
extends between parallel planes on either side of the POF.  When the lens
axis is not perpendicular to the image plane, the POF is no longer parallel
to the image plane; the ability to rotate the POF is
known as the <a href="/wiki/Scheimpflug_principle" id="w">Scheimpflug principle</a>.  Rotation of the POF is
accomplished with <a href="/wiki/View_camera#Movements" id="w">camera movements</a>
(tilt, a rotation of the lens about a horizontal axis, or swing, a rotation
about a vertical axis).  Tilt and swing are available on most <a href="/wiki/View_camera" id="w">view cameras</a>, and
are also available with specific lenses on some small- and medium-format
cameras.</p>
<p>When the POF is rotated, the near and far limits of DOF are no longer
parallel; the DOF becomes wedge-shaped, with the apex of the wedge nearest
the camera. With tilt, the height of the DOF increases with distance
from the camera; with swing, the width of the DOF increases with distance.</p>
<p>Rotating the POF with tilt or swing (or both) can be used either to
maximize or <a href="/wiki/Tilted_plane_focus" id="w">minimize</a> the part of an image that is within the DOF.</p>
<a id="Limited_DOF:_selective_focus" name="Limited_DOF:_selective_focus"></a><h2> Limited DOF: selective focus </h2>
<p>Depth of field can be anywhere from a fraction of a millimeter to virtually infinite.
In some cases, such as landscapes, it may be desirable to have the entire image in focus,
and a large DOF is appropriate. In other cases, artistic considerations may dictate that only
a part of the image be in focus, emphasizing the subject while de-emphasizing the background,
perhaps giving only a suggestion of the environment (<a href="/wiki/#CITEREFLangford1973" id="w">Langford 1973</a>, 81).
For example, a common technique in <a href="/wiki/Melodrama" id="w">melodramas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Horror_film" id="w">horror films</a> is a closeup of a person&#39;s face,
with someone just behind that person visible but out of focus. A <a href="/wiki/Portrait" id="w">portrait</a> or
<a href="/wiki/Macro_photography" id="w">closeup</a> still photograph might use a small DOF to isolate the subject
from a distracting background. The use of limited DOF to emphasize one part of an image is known 
as <i>selective focus</i> or <i>differential focus</i>.</p>
<p>Although a small DOF implies that other parts of the image will be unsharp, it does not, by itself,
determine <i>how</i> unsharp those parts will be. The amount of background (or foreground) blur depends
on the distance from the plane of focus, so if a background is close to the subject, it may be difficult
to blur sufficiently even with a small DOF. In practice, the lens <var>f</var>-number is usually adjusted
until the background or foreground is acceptably blurred, often without direct concern for the DOF.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, it is desirable to have the entire subject sharp while ensuring that the background
is sufficiently unsharp. When the distance between subject and background is fixed, as is the case with
many scenes, the DOF and the amount of background blur are not independent. Although it is not always
possible to achieve both the desired subject sharpness and the desired background unsharpness, several
techniques can be used to increase the separation of subject and background.</p>
<p>For a given scene and subject magnification, the background blur increases with lens focal length.
If it is not important that background objects be unrecognizable, background de-emphasis can be
increased by using a lens of longer focal length and increasing the subject distance to maintain
the same magnification. This technique requires that sufficient space in front of the subject
be available; moreover, the perspective of the scene changes because of the different camera position,
and this may or may not be acceptable.</p>
<p>The situation is not as simple if it is important that a background object, such as a sign, be unrecognizable.
The magnification of background objects also increases with focal length, so with the technique just described,
there is little change in the recognizability of background objects. However, a lens of longer focal length
may still be of some help; because of the narrower angle of view, a slight change of camera position may suffice
to eliminate the distracting object from the field of view.</p>
<p>Although tilt and swing are normally used to maximize the part of the
image that is within the DOF, they also can be used, in combination with a
small <var>f</var>-number, to give selective focus to a plane that isn&#39;t
perpendicular to the lens axis.  With this technique, it is possible to
have objects at greatly different distances from the camera in sharp focus
and yet have a very shallow DOF.  The effect can be interesting because it
differs from what most viewers are accustomed to seeing.</p>
<a id="Hyperfocal_distance" name="Hyperfocal_distance"></a><h2> Hyperfocal distance </h2>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Hyperfocal_distance" id="w">hyperfocal distance</a> is the nearest focus distance at which the DOF extends to infinity; focusing the camera at the hyperfocal distance results in the largest possible depth of field for a given <var>f</var>-number. Focusing <i>beyond</i> the hyperfocal distance does not increase the far DOF (which already extends to infinity), but it does decrease the DOF in front of the subject, decreasing the total DOF.  Some photographers refer to this as &#8220;wasting DOF&#8221;; however, see <a href="/wiki/Depth_of_field#The_object_field_method" id="w">The object field method</a> below for a rationale for doing so. Focusing ahead of the hyperfocal distance increases the DOF ahead of the subject, but decreases DOF beyond the subject, including objects near infinity. Of course, this latter approach may be appropriate for images in which the visual field does not extend to infinity or in which <a href="/wiki/Bokeh" id="w">bokeh</a> is desired.</p>
<a id="The_object_field_method" name="The_object_field_method"></a><h2>The object field method</h2>

<p>Traditional depth-of-field formulae and tables assume equal circles of
confusion for near and far objects.  Some authors, such as
<a href="/wiki/#CITEREFR Merklinger1992" id="w">Merklinger (1992)</a>,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>
have suggested that distant objects often need to be much sharper to be
clearly recognizable, whereas closer objects, being larger on the film, do
not need to be so sharp.  The loss of detail in distant objects may be
particularly noticeable with extreme enlargements.  Achieving this additional
sharpness in distant objects usually requires focusing beyond the
hyperfocal distance, sometimes almost at infinity.  For example, if
photographing a cityscape with a <a href="/wiki/Bollard#Roads" id="w">traffic bollard</a> in the foreground, this
approach, termed the <i>object field method</i> by Merklinger, would recommend
focusing very close to infinity, and stopping down to make the bollard
sharp enough.  With this approach, foreground objects cannot always be made
perfectly sharp, but the loss of sharpness in near objects may be
acceptable if recognizability of distant objects is paramount.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Moritz_von_Rohr" id="w">Moritz von Rohr</a> also used an object field method, but unlike Merklinger, he 
used the conventional criterion of a maximum circle of confusion diameter in 
the image plane, leading to unequal front and rear depths of field.</p>
<a id="Near:far_distribution" name="Near:far_distribution"></a><h2>Near:far distribution </h2>

<p>The DOF beyond the subject is always greater than the DOF in front of the
subject.  When the subject is at the hyperfocal distance or beyond, the far
DOF is infinite; as the subject distance decreases, near:far DOF ratio
increases, approaching unity at high magnification.  The oft-cited
&#8220;rule&#8221; that 1/3 of the DOF is in front of the subject and 2/3
is beyond is true only when the subject distance is 1/3 the hyperfocal
distance.</p>
<a id="Depth_of_field_formulae" name="Depth_of_field_formulae"></a><h2> Depth of field formulae</h2>

<p>The basis of these formulae is given in the section

<a id="Moderate-to-large_distances" name="Moderate-to-large_distances"></a><h3>Moderate-to-large distances</h3>

<p>Let <span class="math">s</span> be the distance at which the camera is focused (the
&#8220;subject distance&#8221;).  When <span class="math">s</span> is large in comparison with the
lens <a href="/wiki/Focal_length" id="w">focal length</a>, the distance <span class="math">D_{\mathrm N}</span> from the

<dl><dd><span class="math">D_{\mathrm N} \approx \frac {H s} {H + s}</span></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><span class="math">D_{\mathrm F} \approx \frac {H s} {H - s} \mbox{ for } s &lt; H</span></dd></dl>
<p>When the subject distance is the hyperfocal distance,</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">D_{\mathrm F} = \infty</span></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><span class="math">D_{\mathrm N} = \frac H 2</span></dd></dl>
<p>The depth of field <span class="math">D_{\mathrm F} - D_{\mathrm N}</span> is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">
\mathrm {DOF} \approx \frac {2 Hs^2}
{H^2 - s^2} \mbox{ for } s &lt; H
</span></dd></dl>
<p>For <span class="math">s \ge H</span>, the far limit of DOF is at infinity and the DOF
is infinite; of course, only objects at or beyond the near limit of DOF
will be recorded with acceptable sharpness.</p>
<p>Substituting for <span class="math">H</span> and rearranging, DOF can be expressed as</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\mathrm {DOF} \approx \frac {2 N c f^2 s^2} {f^4 - N^2 c^2 s^2}</span></dd></dl>
<p>Thus, for a given <a href="/wiki/Film_format" id="w">image format</a>, depth of field is determined
by three factors: the <a href="/wiki/Focal_length" id="w">focal length</a> of the lens, the <var>f</var>-number of the
lens opening (the <a href="/wiki/Aperture" id="w">aperture</a>), and the camera-to-subject distance.</p>
<a id="Close-up" name="Close-up"></a><h3>Close-up </h3>

<p>When the subject distance <span class="math">s</span> approaches the focal length, using
the formulae given above can result in significant errors.  For close-up
work, the hyperfocal distance has little applicability, and it usually is
more convenient to express DOF in terms of image magnification.  Let
<span class="math">m</span> be the magnification; when the subject distance is small in
comparison with the hyperfocal distance,</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\mathrm {DOF} \approx 2 N c \left ( \frac {m + 1} {m^2} \right ),</span></dd></dl>
<p>so that for a given magnification, DOF is independent of focal length.
Stated otherwise, for the same subject magnification, all focal lengths
give approximately the same DOF.  This statement is true <em>only</em> when
the subject distance is small in comparison with the hyperfocal distance,
however.</p>
<p>The discussion thus far has assumed a symmetrical lens for which the
entrance and exit <a href="/wiki/Pupil_(optics)" id="w">pupils</a> coincide with the front and rear 
<a href="/wiki/Nodal_point#Nodal points" id="w">nodal planes</a>, and for which the <a href="/wiki/Pupil_magnification" id="w">pupil magnification</a>
(the ratio of <a href="/wiki/Exit_pupil" id="w">exit pupil</a> diameter to that of the
<a href="/wiki/Entrance_pupil" id="w">entrance pupil</a>)<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> is unity.
Although this assumption usually is reasonable for large-format lenses, it

<p>When <span class="math">s \ll H</span>, the DOF for an asymmetrical lens is</p>

<p>where <span class="math">P</span> is the pupil magnification.  When the

symmetrical lens.</p>
<p>Except for close-up and macro photography, the effect of lens asymmetry is
minimal.  At unity magnification, however, the errors from neglecting the
pupil magnification can be significant.  Consider a telephoto lens with
<span class="math">P = 0.5</span> and a retrofocus wide-angle lens with <span class="math">P =

<span class="math">\mathrm {DOF} = 6 N c</span> and <span class="math">\mathrm {DOF} = 3 N c</span>,
respectively.  The symmetrical-lens formula gives <span class="math">\mathrm {DOF} = 4 N

<a id="Foreground_and_background_blur" name="Foreground_and_background_blur"></a><h3>Foreground and background blur</h3>

<p>If a subject is at distance <span class="math">s</span> and the foreground or background is at distance
<span class="math">D</span>, let the distance between the subject and the foreground or background be
indicated by </p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">x_\mathrm d = \left | D - s \right |</span></dd></dl>
<p>The blur disk diameter <span class="math">b</span> of a detail at distance <span class="math">x_\mathrm d</span>
from the subject can be expressed as a function of the focal length, subject magnification, and
<var>f</var>-number according to </p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">b = \frac {fm_\mathrm s} N \frac { x_\mathrm d } { s \pm x_\mathrm d}</span></dd></dl>
<p>The minus sign applies to a foreground object, and the plus sign applies to a background object.</p>
<p>The blur increases with the distance from the subject; when <span class="math">b \le c</span>, the detail
is within the depth of field, and the blur is imperceptible. If the detail is only slightly
outside the DOF, the blur may be only barely perceptible.</p>
<p>For a given subject magnification, <var>f</var>-number, and distance from the subject
of the foreground or background detail, the degree of detail blur varies with the lens focal length.
For a background detail, the blur increases with focal length; for a foreground detail,
the blur decreases with focal length. For a given scene, the positions of the subject,
foreground, and background usually are fixed, and the distance between subject and the 
foreground or background remains constant regardless of the camera position; however, to maintain
constant magnification, the subject distance must vary if the focal length is changed.
For small distance between the foreground or background detail, the effect of focal length is small;
for large distance, the effect can be significant. For a reasonably distant background detail,
the blur disk diameter is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">b \approx \frac {fm_\mathrm s} {N} ,</span></dd></dl>
<p>depending only on focal length.</p>
<p>The blur diameter of foreground details is very large if the details are close to the lens.</p>
<p>The ratio <span class="math">b/c</span> is independent of camera format; the blur then is in terms of
circles of confusion.</p>
<p>The magnification of the detail also varies with focal length; for a given detail,
the ratio of the blur disk diameter to imaged size of the detail is independent of focal length,
depending only on the detail size and its distance from the subject. This ratio can be useful
when it is important that the background be recognizable (as usually is the case in evidence or
surveillance photography), or unrecognizable (as might be the case for a pictorial photographer
using selective focus to isolate the subject from a distracting background). As a general rule,
an object is recognizable if the blur disk diameter is one-tenth to one-fifth the size of the object
or smaller (<a href="/wiki/#CITEREFWilliams1990" id="w">Williams 1990</a>, 205),<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>
and unrecognizable when the blur disk diameter is the object size or greater.</p>
<p>The effect of focal length on background blur is illustrated in van Walree&#39;s article on

<a id="Practical_complications" name="Practical_complications"></a><h3>Practical complications</h3>

<p>The distance scales on most medium- and small-format lenses indicate
distance from the camera&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Image_plane_(optics)" id="w">image plane</a>.  Most DOF
formulae, including those in this article, use the object distance
<span class="math">s</span> from the lens&#39;s object nodal plane, which often is not easy to
locate.  Moreover, for many zoom lenses and internal-focusing non-zoom
lenses, the location of the object nodal plane, as well as focal length,
changes with subject distance.  When the subject distance is large in
comparison with the lens focal length, the exact location of the object
nodal plane is not critical; the distance is essentially the same whether
measured from the front of the lens, the image plane, or the actual nodal
plane.  The same is not true for close-up photography; at unity
magnification, a slight error in the location of the object nodal plane can
result in a DOF error greater than the errors from any approximations in
the DOF equations.</p>
<p>The asymmetrical lens formulae require knowledge of the
<a href="/wiki/Pupil_magnification" id="w">pupil magnification</a>, which usually is not specified for medium- and
small-format lenses.  The pupil magnification can be estimated by looking
into the front and rear of the lens and measuring the diameters of the
apparent apertures, and computing the ratio (rear diameter divided by front
diameter).<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>
However, for many zoom lenses and internal-focusing non-zoom lenses, the
pupil magnification changes with subject distance, and several measurements
may be required.</p>
<a id="Limitations" name="Limitations"></a><h3>Limitations </h3>

<p>Most DOF formulae, including those discussed in this article, employ
several simplifications:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="/wiki/Paraxial_approximation" id="w">Paraxial</a> (<a href="/wiki/Gaussian_optics" id="w">Gaussian)</a> optics is assumed, and technically, the formulae are valid only for rays that are infinitesimally close to the lens axis.  However, Gaussian optics usually is more than adequate for determining DOF, and non-paraxial formulae are sufficiently complex that requiring their use would make determination of DOF impractical in most cases.</li>
<li>Lens <a href="/wiki/Aberration_in_optical_systems" id="w">aberrations</a> are ignored.  Including the effects of aberrations is nearly impossible, because doing so requires knowledge of the specific lens design.  Moreover, in well-designed lenses, most aberrations are well corrected, and at least near the <a href="/wiki/Optical_axis" id="w">optical axis</a>, often are almost negligible when the lens is stopped down 2&#8211;3 steps from maximum <a href="/wiki/Aperture" id="w">aperture</a>.  Because lenses usually are stopped down at least to this point when DOF is of interest, ignoring aberrations usually is reasonable. Not all aberrations are reduced by stopping down, however, so actual sharpness may be slightly less than predicted by DOF formulae.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Diffraction" id="w">Diffraction</a> is ignored.  DOF formulae imply that any arbitrary DOF can be achieved by using a sufficiently large <a href="/wiki/F-number" id="w">f-number</a>. Because of diffraction, however, this isn&#39;t quite true. Once a lens is stopped down to where most aberrations are well corrected, stopping down further will decrease sharpness in the center of the field.  At the DOF limits, however, further stopping down decreases the size of the <a href="/wiki/Defocus_aberration" id="w">defocus</a> blur spot, and the overall sharpness may increase.  Consequently, choosing an <var>f</var>-number sometimes involves a tradeoff between center and edge sharpness, although viewers typically prefer uniform sharpness to slightly greater center sharpness.  The choice, of course, is subjective, and may depend upon the particular image.  Eventually, the defocus blur spot becomes negligibly small, and further stopping down serves only to decrease sharpness even at DOF limits.  Typically, diffraction at DOF limits becomes significant only at fairly large <var>f</var>-numbers; because large <var>f</var>-numbers typically require long exposure times, <a href="/wiki/Motion_blur" id="w">motion blur</a> often causes greater loss of sharpness than does diffraction. Combined defocus and diffraction is discussed in <a href="/wiki/#CITEREFR Hansma1996" id="w">Hansma (1996)</a> and in Conrad&#39;s <a class="externallink" href="http://www.largeformatphotography.info/articles/DoFinDepth.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.largeformatphotography.info/articles/DoFinDepth.pdf">Depth of Field in Depth</a> (<a href="/wiki/PDF" id="w">PDF</a>) and Jacobson&#39;s <a class="externallink" href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/rec-photo/lenses/tutorial/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/rec-photo/lenses/tutorial/">Photographic Lenses Tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>Post-capture manipulation of the image is ignored. Sharpening via techniques such as <a href="/wiki/Deconvolution" id="w">deconvolution</a> or <a href="/wiki/Unsharp_mask" id="w">unsharp mask</a> can increase the DOF in the final image, particularly when the original image has a large DOF. Conversely, <a href="/wiki/Image_noise_reduction" id="w">image noise reduction</a> can reduce the DOF.</li>
<li>For digital capture with color filter array sensors, <a href="/wiki/Demosaicing" id="w">demosaicing</a> is ignored. Demosaicing alone would normally reduce the DOF, but the demosaicing algorithm used might also include sharpening.</li></ol>
<p>The lens designer cannot restrict analysis to Gaussian optics and cannot
ignore lens aberrations.  However, the requirements of practical
photography are less demanding than those of lens design, and despite the
simplifications employed in development of most DOF formulae, these
formulae have proven useful in determining camera settings that result in
acceptably sharp pictures.  It should be recognized that DOF limits are not
hard boundaries between sharp and unsharp, and that there is little point
in determining DOF limits to a precision of many significant figures.</p>
<a id="DOF_vs._format_size" name="DOF_vs._format_size"></a><h2> DOF vs. format size </h2>

<p>To a first approximation, DOF is inversely proportional to format size.
More precisely, if photographs with the same final-image size are taken in
two different camera formats at the same subject distance with the same
field of view and <var>f</var>-number, the DOF is, to a first
approximation, inversely proportional to the format size.  Strictly
speaking, this is true only when the subject distance is large in
comparison with the focal length and small in comparison with the
hyperfocal distance, for both formats, but it nonetheless is generally
useful for comparing results obtained from different formats</p>
<p>To maintain the same field of view, the lens focal lengths must be in
proportion to the format sizes.  Assuming, for purposes of comparison, that
the 4&#215;5 format is four times the size of 35&#160;mm format, if a
4&#215;5 camera used a 300&#160;mm lens, a 35&#160;mm camera would need a
75&#160;mm lens for the same field of view.  For the same
<var>f</var>-number, the image made with the 35&#160;mm camera would have
four times the DOF of the image made with the 4&#215;5 camera.</p>
<p>In many cases, the DOF is fixed by the requirements of the desired image.
For a given DOF and field of view, the required <var>f</var>-number is
proportional to the format size.  For example, if a 35&#160;mm camera
required {{f/}}11, a 4&#215;5 camera would require {{f/}}45 to give the
same DOF.  For the same ISO speed, the exposure time on the 4&#215;5 would
be sixteen times as long; if the 35&#160;camera required 1/250 second, the
4&#215;5 camera would require 1/15 second.  In windy conditions, the
exposure time with the larger camera might allow <a href="/wiki/Motion_blur" id="w">motion blur</a>.
Adjusting the <var>f</var>-number to the camera format is equivalent to
maintaining the same absolute aperture diameter.</p>
<p>The greater DOF with the smaller format can be either an advantage or a
disadvantage, depending on the desired effect.  For the same amount of
foreground and background blur, a small-format camera requires a smaller
<var>f</var>-number and allows a shorter exposure time than a large-format
camera; however, many point-and-shoot digital cameras cannot provide a very shallow
DOF.  For example, a point-and-shoot digital camera with a 1/1.8&#8243;
sensor (7.18&#160;mm&#160;&#215;&#160;5.32&#160;mm) at a normal focal
length and {{f/}}2.8 has the same DOF as a 35&#160;mm camera with a normal
lens at {{f/}}13.</p>
<p>In some cases, <a href="/wiki/View_camera#View camera movements" id="w">camera movements</a> (tilt or
swing) can be used to better fit the DOF to the
scene, and achieve the required sharpness at a smaller <var>f</var>-number.</p>
<a id="Photolithography" name="Photolithography"></a><h2> Photolithography </h2>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Semiconductor" id="w">semiconductor</a> <a href="/wiki/Photolithography" id="w">photolithography</a> applications, depth of field is extremely important as <a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit" id="w">integrated circuit</a> layout features must be printed with high accuracy at extremely small size.  The difficulty is that the <a href="/wiki/Wafer_(electronics)" id="w">wafer</a> surface is not perfectly flat, but may vary by several <a href="/wiki/Micrometre" id="w">micrometres</a>.  Even this small variation causes some distortion in the projected image, and results in unwanted variations in the resulting pattern. Thus photolithography engineers take extreme measures to maximize the optical depth of field of the photolithography equipment. To minimize this distortion further, chip makers like <a href="/wiki/International_Business_Machines" id="w">IBM</a> are forced to use <a href="/wiki/Chemical_mechanical_polish" id="w">chemical mechanical polishing</a> machines to make the wafer surface even flatter before lithographic patterning.</p>
<a id="Ophthalmology_and_optometry" name="Ophthalmology_and_optometry"></a><h2> Ophthalmology and optometry</h2>
<p>A person may sometimes experience better vision in daylight than at night because of an increased depth of field due to constriction of the <a href="/wiki/Pupil" id="w">pupil</a> (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Miosis" id="w">miosis</a>).</p>

<p>gives</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\mathrm {DOF} = \frac
{2 N c \left ( m + 1 \right )}
{m^2 - \left ( \frac {N c} {f} \right )^2}
</span></dd></dl>
<p>Decreasing the focal length <span class="math">f</span> increases the second term in the
denominator, decreasing the denominator and increasing the value of the
right-hand side, so that a shorter focal length gives greater DOF.  The
effect of focal length is greatest near the hyperfocal distance, and
decreases as subject distance is decreased.  However, the near/far
perspective will differ for different focal lengths, so the difference in
DOF may not be readily apparent.  When the subject distance is small in
comparison with the hyperfocal distance, the effect of focal length is
negligible, and, as noted above, the DOF essentially is independent of
focal length.</p>
<a id="Near:far_DOF_ratio" name="Near:far_DOF_ratio"></a><h3>Near:far DOF ratio</h3>
<p>From the &#8220;exact&#8221; equations for near and far limits of DOF, the DOF in front of the subject is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">s - D_{\mathrm N} = \frac {Ncs(s - f)} {f^2 + Nc(s - f)}\,,</span></dd></dl>
<p>and the DOF beyond the subject is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">D_{\mathrm F} - s = \frac {Ncs(s - f)} {f^2 - Nc(s - f)}</span></dd></dl>
<p>The near:far DOF ratio is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\frac {s - D_{\mathrm N}}  {D_{\mathrm F} - s}
= \frac {f^2 - Nc(s - f)} {f^2 + Nc(s - f)}</span></dd></dl>
<p>This ratio is always less than unity; at moderate-to-large subject distances, <span class="math">f \ll s</span>, and</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\frac {s - D_{\mathrm N}}  {D_{\mathrm F} - s}
\approx \frac {f^2 - Ncs} {f^2 + Ncs} = \frac {H - s} {H + s}</span></dd></dl>
<p>When the subject is at the hyperfocal distance or beyond, the far DOF is infinite, and the near:far ratio is zero. It&#39;s commonly stated that approximately 1/3 of the DOF is in front of the subject and approximately 2/3 is beyond; however, this is true only when <span class="math">s \approx H/3</span>.</p>
<p>At closer subject distances, it&#39;s often more convenient to express the DOF ratio in terms of the magnification</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">m = \frac f {s - f}</span></dd></dl>
<p>Substitution into the &#8220;exact&#8221; equation for DOF ratio gives</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\frac {s - D_{\mathrm N}}  {D_{\mathrm F} - s}
= \frac {m - Nc/f} {m + Nc/f}</span></dd></dl>
<p>As magnification increases, the near:far ratio approaches a limiting value of unity.</p>
<a id="Focus_and_%3Cvar%3Ef%3C/var%3E-number" name="Focus_and_%3Cvar%3Ef%3C/var%3E-number"></a><h3>Focus and &#60;var&#62;f&#60;/var&#62;-number </h3>

<p>Not all images require that sharpness extend to infinity; the equations for
the DOF limits can be combined to eliminate <span class="math">Nc</span> and solve for
the subject distance.  For given near and far DOF limits
<span class="math">D_{\mathrm N}</span> and <span class="math">D_{\mathrm F}</span>, the
subject distance is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">s = \frac {2 D_{\mathrm N} D_{\mathrm F} }
{D_{\mathrm N} +  D_{\mathrm F} }
</span></dd></dl>
<p>The equations for DOF limits also can be combined to eliminate
<span class="math">s</span> and solve for the required <var>f</var>-number, giving</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">N = \frac {f^2} {c}
\frac {D_{\mathrm F} -  D_{\mathrm N} }
{D_{\mathrm F} ( D_{\mathrm N} - f ) + D_{\mathrm N} ( D_{\mathrm F} - f ) }
</span></dd></dl>
<p>When the subject distance is large in comparison with the lens focal
length, this simplifies to</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">N \approx \frac {f^2} {c}
\frac {D_{\mathrm F} -  D_{\mathrm N} } {2 D_{\mathrm N} D_{\mathrm F} }
</span></dd></dl>
<p>Most discussions of DOF concentrate on the object side of the lens, but the
formulae are simpler and the measurements usually easier to make on the
image side.  If <span class="math">v_{\mathrm N}</span> and <span class="math">v_{\mathrm F}</span>
are the image distances that correspond to the near and far limits of DOF,
the required <var>f</var>-number is minimum when the image distance
<span class="math">v</span> is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">v = \frac {2 v_{\mathrm N} v_{\mathrm F} }
{v_{\mathrm N} +  v_{\mathrm F} }
</span></dd></dl>
<p>The required <var>f</var>-number is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">N = \frac {f} {c}
 \frac { v_{\mathrm N} - v_{\mathrm F} }
{v_{\mathrm N} +  v_{\mathrm F} }
</span></dd></dl>
<p>The image distances are measured from the camera&#39;s image plane to the
lens&#39;s image nodal plane, which is not always easy to locate.  In most
cases, focus and <var>f</var>-number can be determined with sufficient accuracy using
the approximate formulae</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">v \approx \frac { v_{\mathrm N} + v_{\mathrm F} } {2}
= v_{\mathrm F} + \frac { v_{\mathrm N} - v_{\mathrm F} } {2}
</span></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><span class="math">N \approx \frac { v_{\mathrm N} - v_{\mathrm F} } { 2 c },</span></dd></dl>
<p>which require only the difference between the near and far image distances;
focus is simply set to halfway between the near and far distances.
View camera users often refer to the difference
<span class="math">v_{\mathrm N} \, - \, v_{\mathrm F}</span> as the <i>focus spread</i>;
it usually is measured on the bed or focusing rail. On manual-focus
small- and medium-format lenses, the focus and <var>f</var>-number
usually are determined using the lens DOF scales, which
often are based on the two equations above.</p>
<p>For close-up photography, the <var>f</var>-number is more accurately determined using</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">N \approx \frac {1} { 1 + m } \frac { v_{\mathrm N} - v_{\mathrm F} } { 2 c },</span></dd></dl>
<p>where <span class="math">m</span> is the magnification.</p>
<p><div style="wigth:600px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:600px-DefocusBlur.png" title="Defocus blur for background object at B."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/600px-DefocusBlur.png" alt="Defocus blur for background object at B." title="Defocus blur for background object at B." class="location-right type-thumb" width="600px" />

<div class="thumbcaption">Defocus blur for background object at B.</div></div>
</p>
<a id="Foreground_and_background_blur" name="Foreground_and_background_blur"></a><h3>Foreground and background blur</h3>
<p>If the equation for the far limit of DOF is solved for <span class="math">c</span>, and the far distance
replaced by an arbitrary distance <span class="math">D</span>, the blur disk diameter
<span class="math">b</span> at that distance is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">b = \frac {fm_\mathrm s} {N} \frac { D - s } { D }</span></dd></dl>
<p>When the background is at the far limit of DOF, the blur disk diameter is equal to the circle
of confusion <span class="math">c</span>, and the blur is just imperceptible. The diameter of the background
blur disk increases with the distance to the background. A similar relationship holds for the
foreground; the general expression for a defocused object at distance <span class="math">D</span> is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">b = \frac {fm_\mathrm s} {N} \frac { \left| D - s \right | } { D }</span></dd></dl>
<p>For a given scene, the distance between the subject and a foreground or background object is usually
fixed; let that distance be represented by</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">x_\mathrm d = \left | D - s \right | ;</span></dd></dl>
<p>then</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">b = \frac {fm_\mathrm s} {N} \frac { x_\mathrm d } { D }</span></dd></dl>
<p>or, in terms of subject distance,</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">b = \frac {fm_\mathrm s} {N} \frac { x_\mathrm d } { s \pm x_\mathrm d } ,</span></dd></dl>
<p>with the minus sign used for foreground objects and the plus sign used for background objects.
For a relatively distant background object,</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">b \approx \frac {fm_\mathrm s} N </span></dd></dl>
<p>In terms of subject magnification, the subject distance is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">s = \frac { m_\mathrm s + 1 } { m_\mathrm s } f ,</span></dd></dl>
<p>so that, for a given <var>f</var>-number and subject magnification,</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">b = \frac {fm_\mathrm s} {N} \frac { x_\mathrm d } { \frac { m_\mathrm s + 1} {m_\mathrm s} f \pm x_\mathrm d }
= \frac {fm_\mathrm s ^2} {N} \frac { x_\mathrm d } { \left ( m_\mathrm s + 1 \right ) f \pm m_\mathrm s x_\mathrm d }
</span></dd></dl>
<p>Differentiating <span class="math">b</span> with respect to <span class="math">f</span> gives</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\frac {\mathrm d b} {\mathrm d f}
= \frac {\pm m_\mathrm s ^3 x_\mathrm d ^2}
        {N \left [ \left ( m_\mathrm s + 1 \right ) f \pm m_\mathrm s x_\mathrm d \right ]^2 }
</span></dd></dl>
<p>With the plus sign, the derivative is everywhere positive,
so that for a background object, the blur disk size increases with focal length.
With the minus sign, the derivative is everywhere negative,
so that for a foreground object, the blur disk size decreases with focal length.</p>
<p>The magnification of the defocused object also varies with focal length; the magnification of the
defocused object is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">m_\mathrm d = \frac {v_\mathrm s} {D} = \frac { \left ( m_\mathrm s + 1 \right ) f } { D },</span></dd></dl>
<p>where <span class="math">v_\mathrm s</span> is the image distance of the subject. For a defocused object
with some characteristic dimension <span class="math">y</span>, the imaged size of that object is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">m_\mathrm d y = \frac { \left ( m_\mathrm s + 1 \right ) f y } { D }</span></dd></dl>
<p>The ratio of the blur disk size to the imaged size of that object then is</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math"> \frac b { m_\mathrm d y } = \frac {m_\mathrm s} { m_\mathrm s + 1 } \frac {x_\mathrm d } { Ny },</span></dd></dl>
<p>so for a given defocused object, the ratio of the blur disk diameter to object size
is independent of focal length, and depends only on the object size and its distance from the subject.</p>
<a id="Asymmetrical_lenses" name="Asymmetrical_lenses"></a><h3>Asymmetrical lenses</h3>

<p>The discussion thus far has assumed a symmetrical lens for which the
entrance and exit <a href="/wiki/Pupil" id="w">pupils</a> coincide with the object and image
<a href="/wiki/Nodal_planes" id="w">nodal planes</a>, and for which the <a href="/wiki/Pupil_magnification" id="w">pupil magnification</a> is unity.
Although this assumption usually is reasonable for large-format lenses, it
often is invalid for medium- and small-format lenses.</p>
<p>For an asymmetrical lens, the DOF ahead of the subject distance and the
DOF beyond the subject distance are given by<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\mathrm {DOF_N} = \frac
{N c (1 + m/P)}
{m^2 [ 1 + (N c ) / ( f m ) ] }
</span></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\mathrm {DOF_F} = \frac
{N c (1 + m/P)}
{m^2 [ 1 - (N c )/ ( f m ) ] },
</span></dd></dl>
<p>where <span class="math">P</span> is the pupil magnification.</p>
<p>Combining gives the total DOF:</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\mathrm {DOF} = \frac {2 f ( 1/m + 1/P ) }
{ ( f m ) / ( N c ) - ( N c ) / ( f m ) }
</span></dd></dl>
<p>When <span class="math">s \ll H</span>, the second term in the denominator becomes
small in comparison with the first, and</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\mathrm {DOF} \approx \frac {2 N c (1 + m/P)}{m^2}</span></dd></dl>
<p>When the pupil magnification is unity, the equations for asymmetrical
lenses reduce to those given earlier for symmetrical lenses.</p>
<a id="Effect_of_lens_asymmetry" name="Effect_of_lens_asymmetry"></a><h3>Effect of lens asymmetry</h3>

<p>Except for close-up and macro photography, the effect of lens asymmetry is
minimal.  A slight rearrangement of the last equation gives</p>
<dl><dd><span class="math">\mathrm {DOF} \approx \frac {2 N c} {m}
\left ( \frac 1 m + \frac 1 P \right )
</span></dd></dl>
<p>As magnification decreases, the <span class="math">1/P</span> term becomes smaller in
comparison with the <span class="math">1/m</span> term, and eventually the effect of
pupil magnification becomes negligible.</p>
