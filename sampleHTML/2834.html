<p><b><i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects</i></b> (<a href="/wiki/1792_in_literature" id="w">1792</a>), written by the <a href="/wiki/Eighteenth-century" id="w">eighteenth-century</a> British <a href="/wiki/Feminist" id="w">feminist</a> <a href="/wiki/Mary_Wollstonecraft" id="w">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to the educational and political theorists of the eighteenth century who wanted to deny women an education. She argues that women ought to have an education <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Commensurate">commensurate</a> with their position in society, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be &#34;companions&#34; to their husbands, rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men.</p>
<p>Wollstonecraft was prompted to write the <i>Rights of Woman</i> by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Maurice_de_Talleyrand-P%C3%A9rigord" id="w">Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord&#39;s</a> 1791 report to the French <a href="/wiki/National_Assembly_(French_Revolution)" id="w">National Assembly</a> which stated that women should only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the <i>Rights of Woman</i> hurriedly in order to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume, but she died before completing it.</p>
<p>While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her. Although it is commonly assumed now that the <i>Rights of Woman</i> was unfavorably received, this is a modern misconception based on the belief that Wollstonecraft was as reviled during her lifetime as she became after the publication of <a href="/wiki/William_Godwin" id="w">William Godwin&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Memoirs_of_the_Author_of_A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Woman" id="w">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a></i> (1798). The <i>Rights of Woman</i> was actually well-received when it was first published in 1792. One biographer has called it &#34;perhaps the most original book of [Wollstonecraft&#39;s] century&#34;.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i> was written against the tumultuous background of the <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" id="w">French Revolution</a> and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the <i><a href="/wiki/Revolution_Controversy" id="w">Revolution Controversy</a></i>, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with <i><a href="/wiki/A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Men" id="w">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</a></i>, a response to <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Burke" id="w">Edmund Burke&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Reflections_on_the_Revolution_in_France" id="w">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a></i> (1790).<sup id="_ref-MS1112_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MS1112" title="">[2]</a></sup> In his <i>Reflections</i>, Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain&#39;s own <a href="/wiki/Glorious_Revolution" id="w">Glorious Revolution</a> in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" id="w">English Civil War</a> (1642–1651) in which <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" id="w">Charles I</a> had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In <i>Reflections</i> he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged&#8212;the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft&#39;s <i>Rights of Men</i>, published just six weeks after Burke&#39;s <i>Reflections</i>, is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>When <a href="/wiki/Charles_Maurice_de_Talleyrand-P%C3%A9rigord" id="w">Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord</a> presented his <i>Rapport sur l&#39;instruction publique</i> (1791) to the <a href="/wiki/National_Assembly_(French_Revolution)" id="w">National Assembly</a> in France, Wollstonecraft was galvanized to respond.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> In his recommendations for a national system of education, Talleyrand had written:
</p><blockquote>
<p>Let us bring up women, not to aspire to advantages which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Men are destined to live on the stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup>

<div class="thumbcaption"><a href="/wiki/Olympe_de_Gouge" id="w">Olympe de Gouge</a></div>
Wollstonecraft dedicated the <i>Rights of Woman</i> to Talleyrand: &#34;Having read with great pleasure a pamphlet which you have lately published, I dedicate this volume to you; to induce you to reconsider the subject, and maturely weigh what I have advanced respecting the rights of woman and national education.&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> That same year, French feminist <a href="/wiki/Olympe_de_Gouge" id="w">Olympe de Gouge</a> published her <i><a href="/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Woman_and_the_Female_Citizen" id="w">Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen</a></i>, and the question of women&#39;s rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain.<sup id="_ref-MS1112_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MS1112" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Rights of Woman</i> is an extension of Wollstonecraft&#39;s arguments in the <i>Rights of Men</i>. In the <i>Rights of Men</i>, as the title suggests, she is concerned with the rights of particular men (eighteenth-century British men) while in the <i>Rights of Woman</i>, she is concerned with the rights afforded to &#34;woman&#34;, an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to eighteenth-century women or British women. The first chapter of the <i>Rights of Woman</i> addresses the issue of <a href="/wiki/Natural_rights" id="w">natural rights</a> and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> <i>The Rights of Woman</i> thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by contemporary <a href="/wiki/Political_philosophy" id="w">political philosophers</a> such as <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" id="w">John Locke</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" id="w">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Themes" name="Themes"></a><h1>Themes</h1>
<p>Wollstonecraft did not employ the formal argumentation or logical prose style common to eighteenth-century philosophical writing when composing her own works. The <i>Rights of Woman</i> is a long essay that introduces all of its major topics in the opening chapters and then repeatedly returns to them, each time from a different point of view. It also adopts a hybrid tone that combines rational argument with the fervent rhetoric of <a href="/wiki/Sensibility" id="w">sensibility</a>.<sup id="_ref-K110_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-K110" title="">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the eighteenth century, <i>sensibility</i> was a physical phenomenon that came to be attached to a specific set of moral beliefs. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive a person&#39;s nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men.<sup id="_ref-BB9_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BB9" title="">[10]</a></sup> The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism" id="w">movement to abolish the slave trade</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> But sensibility also paralyzed those who had too much of it; as scholar G. J. Barker-Benfield explains, &#34;an innate refinement of nerves was also identifiable with greater suffering, with weakness, and a susceptibility to disorder&#34;.<sup id="_ref-BB9_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BB9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the time Wollstonecraft was writing the <i>Rights of Woman</i>, sensibility had already been under sustained attack for a number of years.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Sensibility, which had initially promised to draw individuals together through sympathy, was now viewed as &#34;profoundly separatist&#34;; novels, plays, and poems that employed the language of sensibility asserted individual rights, sexual freedom, and unconventional familial relationships based only upon feeling.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Furthermore, as <a href="/wiki/Janet_Todd" id="w">Janet Todd</a>, another scholar of sensibility, argues, “to many in Britain the cult of sensibility seemed to have feminized the nation, given women undue prominence, and emasculated men.”<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Rational_education" name="Rational_education"></a><h2>Rational education</h2>
<p>One of Wollstonecraft&#39;s central arguments in the <i>Rights of Woman</i> is that women should be educated rationally in order to give them the opportunity to contribute to society. In the eighteenth century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and <a href="/wiki/Conduct_book" id="w">conduct book</a> writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books,<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as <a href="/wiki/Catharine_Macaulay" id="w">Catharine Macaulay</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hester_Chapone" id="w">Hester Chapone</a>, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, <i><a href="/wiki/Thoughts_on_the_Education_of_Daughters" id="w">Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</a></i> (1787), in her children&#39;s book, <i><a href="/wiki/Original_Stories_from_Real_Life" id="w">Original Stories from Real Life</a></i> (1788), as well as in the <i>Rights of Woman</i>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Stating in her preface that “my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if [woman] be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all&#34;, Wollstonecraft contends that society will degenerate without educated women, particularly because mothers are the primary educators of young children.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> She attributes the problem of uneducated women to men and “a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who, consider[ed] females rather as women than human creatures&#34;.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Women are capable of rationality; it only appears that they are not, because men have refused to educate them and encouraged them to be frivolous(Wollstonecraft describes silly women as &#34;spaniels&#34; and &#34;toys&#34;<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>).<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wollstonecraft attacks conduct book writers such as <a href="/wiki/James_Fordyce" id="w">James Fordyce</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Gregory_(moralist)" id="w">John Gregory</a> as well as educational philosophers such as <a href="/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" id="w">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> who argue that a woman does not need a rational education. (Rousseau famously argues in <i><a href="/wiki/Emile:_Or%2C_On_Education" id="w">Emile</a></i> (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men; Wollstonecraft, infuriated by this argument, attacks not only it but also Rousseau himself.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup>) Intent on illustrating the limitations that contemporary educational theory placed upon women, Wollstonecraft writes, &#34;taught from their infancy that beauty is woman’s sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison&#34;,<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> implying that without this damaging ideology, which encourages young women to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, they could achieve much more. Wives could be the rational &#34;companions&#34; of their husbands and even pursue careers should they so choose: &#34;women might certainly study the art of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses. And midwifery, decency seems to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Allot">allot</a> to them&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. they might, also, study politics&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Business of various kinds, they might likewise pursue.&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>For Wollstonecraft, &#34;the most perfect education&#34; is &#34;an exercise of the understanding as is best calculated to strengthen the body and form the heart. Or, in other words, to enable the individual to attach such habits of virtue as will render it independent.”<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> In addition to her broad philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft lays out a specific plan for national education to counter <a href="/wiki/Talleyrand" id="w">Talleyrand&#39;s</a>. In Chapter 12, &#34;On National Education&#34;, she proposes that all children be sent to a &#34;country day school&#34; as well as given some education at home &#34;to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures&#34;. She also maintains that schooling should be <a href="/wiki/Coeducation" id="w">co-educational</a>, contending that men and women, whose marriages are &#34;the cement of society&#34;, should be &#34;educated after the same model&#34;.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

It is debatable to what extent the <i>Rights of Woman</i> is a <a href="/wiki/Feminist" id="w">feminist</a> text; because the definitions of <i>feminist</i> vary, different scholars have come to different conclusions. Wollstonecraft herself would never have referred to her text as feminist because the words <i>feminist</i> and <i>feminism</i> were not coined until the 1890s.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> Moreover, there was no <a href="/wiki/Feminist_movement" id="w">feminist movement</a> to speak of during Wollstonecraft&#39;s lifetime. In the introduction to her seminal work on Wollstonecraft&#39;s thought, Barbara Taylor writes:
</p><blockquote>
<p>Describing [Wollstonecraft&#39;s philosophy] as feminist is problematic, and I do it only after much consideration. The label is of course anachronistic&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Treating Wollstonecraft’s thought as an anticipation of nineteenth and twentieth-century feminist argument has meant sacrificing or distorting some of its key elements. Leading examples of this&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. have been the widespread neglect of her religious beliefs, and the misrepresentation of her as a bourgeois liberal, which together have resulted in the displacement of a religiously inspired utopian radicalism by a secular, class-partisan reformism as alien to Wollstonecraft’s political project as her dream of a divinely promised age of universal happiness is to our own. Even more important however has been the imposition on Wollstonecraft of a heroic-individualist brand of politics utterly at odds with her own ethically driven case for women’s emancipation. Wollstonecraft’s leading ambition for women was that they should attain virtue, and it was to this end that she sought their liberation.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>
<p>In the <i>Rights of Woman</i>, Wollstonecraft does not make the claim for gender equality using the same arguments or the same language that late nineteenth- and twentieth-century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that men and women are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> For Wollstonecraft, men and women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to twenty-first-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the eighteenth century. For example, it implied that both men and women&#8212;not just women&#8212;should be modest<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> and respect the sanctity of marriage.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> Wollstonecraft&#39;s argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late eighteenth century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.</p>
<p>However, Wollstonecraft&#39;s arguments for equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valor.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously states: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, Wollstonecraft calls on men, rather than women, to initiate the social and political changes she outlines in the <i>Rights of Woman</i>. Because women are uneducated, they cannot alter their own situation&#8212;men must come to their aid.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> Wollstonecraft writes at the end of her chapter &#34;Of the Pernicious Effects Which Arise from the Unnatural Distinctions Established in Society&#34;:
</p><blockquote>
<p>I then would <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Fain">fain</a> convince reasonable men of the importance of some of my remarks; and prevail on them to weigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observations. – I appeal to their understandings; and, as a fellow-creature, claim, in the name of my sex, some interest in their hearts. I entreat them to assist to emancipate their companion, to make her a help meet for them! Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothers – in a word, better citizens.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is Wollstonecraft&#39;s last novel, <i><a href="/wiki/Maria:_or%2C_The_Wrongs_of_Woman" id="w">Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman</a></i> (1798), the fictionalized sequel to the <i>Rights of Woman</i>, that is usually considered her most radical feminist work.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Sensibility" name="Sensibility"></a><h2>Sensibility</h2>
<p>One of Wollstonecraft&#39;s most scathing criticisms in the <i>Rights of Woman</i> is against false and excessive <a href="/wiki/Sensibility" id="w">sensibility</a>, particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are &#34;blown about by every momentary gust of feeling&#34;; because these women are &#34;the prey of their senses&#34;, they cannot think rationally.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> In fact, not only do they do harm to themselves but they also do harm to all of civilization: these are not women who can refine civilization, these are women who will destroy it. But reason and feeling are not independent for Wollstonecraft; rather, she believes that they should inform each other. For Wollstonecraft, as for the important eighteenth-century philosopher <a href="/wiki/David_Hume" id="w">David Hume</a>, the passions underpin all reason.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> This was a theme that she would return to throughout her career, but particularly in her novels <i><a href="/wiki/Mary:_A_Fiction" id="w">Mary: A Fiction</a></i> (1788) and <i><a href="/wiki/Maria:_or%2C_The_Wrongs_of_Woman" id="w">Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman</a></i>.</p>
<p>As part of her argument that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that they should not be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the &#34;negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality&#34; is a &#34;<i><a href="/wiki/Leitmotif" id="w">leitmotif</a></i>&#34; of the <i>Rights of Woman</i>.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to &#34;calmly let passion subside into friendship&#34; in the ideal companionate marriage (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time).<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> It would be better, she writes, when “two virtuous young people marry . . . if some circumstances checked their passion”.<sup id="_ref-W192_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-W192" title="">[42]</a></sup> According to Wollstonecraft, “love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom&#34;.<sup id="_ref-W192_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-W192" title="">[42]</a></sup> As Mary Poovey explains, “Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man’s lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given might even be deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body.”<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> If women are not interested in sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with &#34;romantic wavering&#34;, that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> Because the <i>Rights of Woman</i> eliminates sexuality from a woman&#39;s life, Kaplan contends, it  “expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual&#34; while at the same time &#34;exaggerat[ing] the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women&#34;. Wollstonecraft was so determined to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: &#34;it is important to remember that the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [was] fatally linked [during the eighteenth century] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality.&#34;<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>

<a href="/wiki/Claudia_L._Johnson_(scholar)" id="w">Claudia Johnson</a>, a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, has called the <i>Rights of Woman</i> &#34;a republican manifesto&#34;. <sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> Johnson contends that Wollstonecraft is hearkening back to the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_men" id="w">Commonwealth</a> tradition of the seventeenth century and attempting to reestablish a <a href="/wiki/Republicanism" id="w">republican</a> ethos. In Wollstonecraft&#39;s version, there would be strong, but separate, masculine and feminine roles for citizens.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> According to Johnson, Wollstonecraft &#34;denounces the collapse of proper sexual distinction as the leading feature of her age, and as the grievous consequence of sentimentality itself. The problem undermining society in her view is feminized men&#34;.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> If men feel free to adopt both the masculine position and the sentimental feminine position, she argues, women have no position open to them in society.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Johnson therefore sees Wollstonecraft as a critic, in both the <i><a href="/wiki/A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Men" id="w">Rights of Men</a></i> and the <i>Rights of Woman</i>, of the &#34;masculinization of sensitivity&#34; in such works as <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Burke" id="w">Edmund Burke&#39;s</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Reflections_on_the_Revolution_in_France" id="w">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the <i>Rights of Woman</i> Wollstonecraft adheres to a version of republicanism that includes a belief in the eventual overthrow of all titles, including the monarchy. She also briefly suggests that all men and women should be represented in government. But the bulk of her “political criticism,” as Chris Jones, a Wollstonecraft scholar, explains, “is couched predominantly in terms of morality&#34;.<sup id="_ref-J43_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-J43" title="">[52]</a></sup> Her definition of virtue focuses on the individual’s happiness rather than, for example, the good of the entire society.<sup id="_ref-J43_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-J43" title="">[52]</a></sup> This is reflected in her explanation of <a href="/wiki/Natural_rights" id="w">natural rights</a>. Because rights ultimately proceed from God, Wollstonecraft maintains that there are duties, tied to those rights, incumbent upon each and every person. But it also true that, for Wollstonecraft, the individual is taught republicanism and benevolence within the family; domestic relations and familial ties are crucial to her understanding of social cohesion and patriotism.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Class" name="Class"></a><h2>Class</h2>
<p>In many ways the <i>Rights of Woman</i> is inflected by a <a href="/wiki/Bourgeoisie" id="w">bourgeois</a> view of the world, as is its direct predecessor the <i><a href="/wiki/A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Men" id="w">Rights of Men</a></i>. Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle class, which she calls the &#34;most natural state&#34;. She also frequently praises modesty and industry, virtues which, at the time, were associated with the middle class.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> From her position as a middle-class writer arguing for a middle-class ethos, Wollstonecraft also attacks the wealthy, criticizing them using the same arguments she employs against women. She points out the &#34;false-refinement, immorality, and vanity&#34; of the rich, calling them &#34;weak, artificial beings, raised above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature unnatural manner [who] undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society&#34;.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>But Wollstonecraft&#39;s criticisms of the wealthy do not necessarily reflect a concomitant sympathy for the poor. For her, the poor are fortunate because they will never be trapped by the snares of wealth: “Happy is it when people have the cares of life to struggle with; for these struggles prevent their becoming a prey to enervating vices, merely from idleness!”<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> Moreover, she contends that charity has only negative consequences because, as Jones puts it, she “sees it as sustaining an unequal society while giving the appearance of virtue to the rich&#34;.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In her national plan for education, she retains class distinctions (with an exception for the intelligent), suggesting that: &#34;After the age of nine, girls and boys, intended for domestic employments, or mechanical trades, ought to be removed to other schools, and receive instruction, in some measure appropriated to the destination of each individual . . . The young people of superior abilities, or fortune, might now be taught, in another school, the dead and living languages, the elements of science, and continue the study of history and politics, on a more extensive scale, which would not exclude polite literature.&#34;<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>

In attempting to navigate the cultural expectations of female writers and the generic conventions of political and philosophical discourse, Wollstonecraft, as she does throughout her <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Oeuvre">oeuvre</a></i>, constructs a unique blend of masculine and feminine styles in the <i>Rights of Woman</i>.<sup id="_ref-K109_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-K109" title="">[59]</a></sup> She utilizes the language of philosophy, referring to her work as a &#34;treatise&#34; with &#34;arguments&#34; and &#34;principles&#34;.<sup id="_ref-K109_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-K109" title="">[59]</a></sup> However, Wollstonecraft also uses a personal tone, employing &#34;I&#34; and &#34;you&#34;, dashes and exclamation marks, and autobiographical references to create a distinctly feminine voice in the text.<sup id="_ref-K110_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-K110" title="">[9]</a></sup> The <i>Rights of Woman</i> further hybridizes its genre by weaving together elements of the conduct book, the short essay, and the novel, genres often associated with women, while at the same time claiming that these genres could be used to discuss philosophical topics such as rights.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Wollstonecraft argues against excessive <a href="/wiki/Sensibility" id="w">sensibility</a>, the rhetoric of the <i>Rights of Woman</i> is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader. Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at <a href="/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" id="w">Rousseau</a>. For example, after excerpting a long passage from <i><a href="/wiki/Emile:_Or%2C_On_Education" id="w">Emile</a></i> (1762), Wollstonecraft pithily states, &#34;I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage, than just to observe, that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness.&#34;<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> A mere page later, after indicting Rousseau&#39;s plan for female education, she writes &#34;I must relieve myself by drawing another picture.&#34;<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument (it is assumed that the reader will agree with them). While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience,<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility in order to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric.</p>
<p>In her efforts to vividly describe the condition of women within society, Wollstonecraft employs several different analogies.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup> She often compares women to slaves, arguing that their ignorance and powerlessness places them in that position. But at the same time, she also compares them to &#34;capricious tyrants&#34; who use cunning and deceit to manipulate the men around them. At one point, she reasons that a woman can become either a slave or tyrant, which she describes as two sides of the same coin.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> Wollstonecraft also compares women to soldiers; like military men, they are valued only for their appearance. And like the rich, women&#39;s &#34;softness&#34; has &#34;debased mankind&#34;.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Revision" name="Revision"></a><h1>Revision</h1>
<p>Wollstonecraft was forced to write the <i>Rights of Woman</i> hurriedly in order to respond to <a href="/wiki/Talleyrand" id="w">Talleyrand</a> and ongoing events. Upon completing the work, she wrote to her friend <a href="/wiki/William_Roscoe" id="w">William Roscoe</a>: &#34;I am dissatisfied with myself for not having done justice to the subject. – Do not suspect me of false modesty – I mean to say that had I allowed myself more time I could have written a better book, in every sense of the word&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written.&#34;<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[68]</a></sup> When Wollstonecraft revised the <i>Rights of Woman</i> for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[69]</a></sup> She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[70]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Wollstonecraft never wrote the second part to the <i>Rights of Woman,</i> although <a href="/wiki/William_Godwin" id="w">William Godwin</a> published her &#34;Hints&#34;, which were &#34;chiefly designed to have been incorporated in the second part of the <i>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>&#34;, in the posthumous collection of her works.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[71]</a></sup> However, she did begin writing the novel <i><a href="/wiki/Maria:_or%2C_The_Wrongs_of_Woman" id="w">Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman</a></i>, which most scholars consider a fictionalized sequel to the <i>Rights of Woman</i>. It was unfinished at her death and also included in the <i>Posthumous Works</i> published by Godwin.<sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>

When it was first published in 1792, the <i>Rights of Woman</i> was reviewed positively by the <i><a href="/wiki/Analytical_Review" id="w">Analytical Review</a></i>, the <i>General Magazine</i>, the <i>Literary Magazine</i>, <i>New York Magazine</i>, and the <i>Monthly Review</i>, although the assumption persists even today that <i>Rights of Woman</i> received hostile reviews.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[73]</a></sup> It was almost immediately released in a second edition in 1792, several American editions appeared, and it was translated into French. Taylor writes that &#34;it was an immediate success&#34;.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[74]</a></sup> Moreover, other writers such as <a href="/wiki/Mary_Hays" id="w">Mary Hays</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mary_Robinson_(poet)" id="w">Mary Robinson</a> specifically alluded to Wollstonecraft&#39;s text in their own works. Hays cited the <i>Rights of Woman</i> in her novel <i><a href="/wiki/Memoirs_of_Emma_Courtney" id="w">Memoirs of Emma Courtney</a></i> (1796) and modeled her female characters after Wollstonecraft&#39;s ideal woman.<sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[75]</a></sup> Although female conservatives such as <a href="/wiki/Hannah_More" id="w">Hannah More</a> excoriated Wollstonecraft personally, they actually shared many of the same values. As the scholar Anne Mellor has shown, both More and Wollstonecraft wanted a society founded on “Christian virtues of rational benevolence, honesty, personal virtue, the fulfillment of social duty, thrift, sobriety, and hard work&#34;.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[76]</a></sup> During the early 1790s, many writers within British society were engaged in an intense debate regarding the position of women in society. For example, the respected poet and essayist <a href="/wiki/Anna_Laetitia_Barbauld" id="w">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</a> and Wollstonecraft sparred back and forth; Barbauld published several poems responding to Wollstonecraft’s work and Wollstonecraft commented on them in footnotes to the <i>Rights of Woman</i>.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[77]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Wollstonecraft died in 1797, her husband <a href="/wiki/William_Godwin" id="w">William Godwin</a> published his <i><a href="/wiki/Memoirs_of_the_Author_of_A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Woman" id="w">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a></i> (1798). He revealed much about her private life that had previously not been known to the public: her illegitimate child, her love affairs, and her attempts at suicide. While Godwin believed he was portraying his wife with love, sincerity, and compassion, contemporary readers were shocked by Wollstonecraft&#39;s unorthodox lifestyle and she became a reviled figure. Wollstonecraft’s ideas became associated with her life story and women writers felt that it was dangerous to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her <i>Rights of Woman</i>, for example, did not include her in the collection of <i>Illustrious and Celebrated Women</i> she published in 1803.<sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[78]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Maria_Edgeworth" id="w">Maria Edgeworth</a> specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel <i><a href="/wiki/Belinda_(Edgeworth_novel)" id="w">Belinda</a></i> (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[79]</a></sup> But, like <a href="/wiki/Jane_Austen" id="w">Jane Austen</a>, she does not reject Wollstonecraft’s ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial to the development of the nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.<sup id="_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#_note-80" title="">[80]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The negative views towards Wollstonecraft persisted for over a century. The <i>Rights of Woman</i> was not reprinted until the middle of the nineteenth century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute. <a href="/wiki/George_Eliot" id="w">George Eliot</a> wrote &#34;there is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the <i>Rights of Woman</i> as in some way or other a reprehensible book, but readers who go to it with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely moral, and withal rather heavy&#34;.<sup id="_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#_note-81" title="">[81]</a></sup>  While the <i>Rights of Woman</i> may have paved the way for feminist arguments, twentieth-century feminists have tended to use Wollstonecraft&#39;s life story, rather than her texts, for inspiration;<sup id="_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#_note-82" title="">[82]</a></sup> her unorthodox lifestyle convinced them to try new &#34;experiments in living&#34;, as <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Woolf" id="w">Virginia Woolf</a> termed it in her famous essay on Wollstonecraft.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[83]</a></sup> However, there is some evidence that the <i>Rights of Woman</i> may be influencing current feminists. <a href="/wiki/Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali" id="w">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a>, a feminist who is critical of <a href="/wiki/Women_and_Islam" id="w">Islam&#39;s dictates regarding women</a>, cites the <i>Rights of Woman</i> in her autobiography, writing that she &#34;inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights&#34;.<sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[84]</a></sup>
