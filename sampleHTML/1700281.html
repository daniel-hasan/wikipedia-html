<p><b>Humanum Genus</b> was a <a href="/wiki/Papal_encyclical" id="w">papal encyclical</a> promulgated on <a href="/wiki/April_20" id="w">April 20</a> <a href="/wiki/1884" id="w">1884</a> by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIII" id="w">Pope Leo XIII</a>.</p>
<a id="Two_Cities" name="Two_Cities"></a><h1>Two Cities</h1>
<p>It starts by using the <a href="/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo" id="w">Augustinian</a> concept of the two cities, the City of Man and <a href="/wiki/The_City_of_God" id="w">the City of God</a>. So the human race was &#34;separated into two diverse and opposite parts, of which the one steadfastly contends for truth and virtue, the other of those things which are contrary to virtue and to truth. The one is the kingdom of God on earth, namely, the true Church of <a href="/wiki/Jesus" id="w">Jesus Christ</a> ... The other is the kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Satan" id="w">Satan</a>,&#34; which were &#34;led on or assisted&#34; by Freemasonry.</p>
<p>The fundamental doctrine of Masonry was portrayed as <a href="/wiki/Philosophical_naturalism" id="w">naturalism</a>, which leads to <a href="/wiki/Deism" id="w">Deism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gnosticism" id="w">gnosticism</a>. This was seen to lead them to a fundamental clash with (<a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" id="w">Roman Catholic</a>) <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a> as, due to their supposed  beliefs, Freemasons were accused of support of a radical <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state" id="w">separation of church and state</a>, with an attempt to impose legal obstacles to the church.</p>
<a id="Historical_circumstances" name="Historical_circumstances"></a><h1>Historical circumstances</h1>
<p>The encyclical argued that the late 19th century was a time of particular danger for Christians as the &#34;partisans of evil&#34; were now far more open, as evidenced by the new openness of <a href="/wiki/Freemasonry" id="w">Freemasonry</a>. Freemasonry had been condemned by previous Popes as contrary to Christian doctrine, but the nature (if not beliefs) of Freemasonry was changing as Freemasons were now far more open in their practices and affiliations.</p>
<p>The encyclical specifically condemned certain practices of the Freemasons, such as: the admission of persons of every creed, which was equated to religious indifference;<sup id="_ref-allcreeds_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-allcreeds" title="">[1]</a></sup> the promotion of <a href="/wiki/Public_education" id="w">public education</a> which denied the Church&#39;s role and where &#34;the education of youth shall be exclusively in the hands of laymen&#34;;<sup id="_ref-laymen_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-laymen" title="">[2]</a></sup> the approval of the notion that &#34;the people are sovereign,&#34;{{Fact}} and that &#34;those who rule have no authority but by the commission and concession of the people.&#34;{{Fact}} The encyclical went on to state that Freemasonry was condemned because it encourages the political power of the people,<sup id="_ref-polpower_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-polpower" title="">[3]</a></sup> and went on to state that &#34;it is most untrue that the people have it in their power to cast aside their obedience whensoever they please.&#34;<sup id="_ref-castaside_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-castaside" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>It had long been a practice of the church to forbid <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Catholics</a> from becoming freemasons, often backed up by temporal governments. This did not stop Freemasonry growing into a position where it (in 1884), like the democratic governments that it encouraged,{{Fact}} had considerable power.</p>
<a id="Condemnation_of_Jeffersonian_Principles" name="Condemnation_of_Jeffersonian_Principles"></a><h1>Condemnation of Jeffersonian Principles</h1>
<p><i>Humanum Genus</i> criticises many <a href="/wiki/Jeffersonian_democracy" id="w">Jeffersonian</a> principles, which are today equated by most people with the founding principles of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. For example, paragraph 22 condemns <a href="/wiki/Popular_sovereignty" id="w">popular sovereignty</a>:</p>
<dl><dd><i>Then come their doctrines of politics, in which the naturalists lay down that all men have the same right, and are in every respect of equal and like condition; that each one is naturally free; that no one has the right to command another; that it is an act of violence to require men to obey any authority other than that which is obtained from themselves.</i><sup id="_ref-para22_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-para22" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>It also condemns the doctrine of perpetual <a href="/wiki/Revolution" id="w">revolution</a>:</p>
<dl><dd><i>According to this, therefore, all things belong to the free people; power is held by the command or permission of the people, so that, when the popular will changes, rulers may lawfully be deposed and the source of all rights and civil duties is either in the multitude or in the governing authority when this is constituted according to the latest doctrines.</i><sup id="_ref-para22_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-para22" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Finally it condemns the Jeffersonian and Masonic idea of the &#34;wall of separation&#34; between church and state:</p>
<dl><dd><i>It is held also that the State should be without God; that in the various forms of religion there is no reason why one should have precedence of another; and that they are all to occupy the same place.</i><sup id="_ref-para22_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-para22" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" id="w">Thomas Jefferson</a>, in common with many other <a href="/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States" id="w">founding fathers</a>, was strongly influenced by Masonic ideas on the place of religion in the state..{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Interstingly, when President <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" id="w">John F. Kennedy</a>,(a Roman Catholic), welcomed forty-nine Nobel Prize winners to the White House in 1962 he said, &#34;I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent and of human knowledge that has ever been gathered together at the White House—with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<li><a href="/wiki/Pope_Pius_IX" id="w">Pope Pius IX</a> - <a href="/wiki/Qui_Pluribus" id="w">Qui Pluribus</a></li></ul>
<p>Leo XIII&#39;s denunciation of Freemasonry should be seen in context of his examination of <a href="/wiki/Socialism" id="w">socialism</a> (<a href="/wiki/Quod_Apostolici_Muneris" id="w">Quod Apostolici Muneris</a>), his defence of Christian <a href="/wiki/Marriage" id="w">marriage</a> (Arcanum) and on the role of government (<a href="/wiki/Diuturnum" id="w">Diuturnum</a>). Because of the supposed secrecy in freemasonry, it was believed by the Roman Catholic Church to have an enormous amount of secret discipline of its members - which was seen by the Pope as enslavement. So by this definition, although individual Masons may be decent people, they were being led to do evil things.</p>

Therefore, in the education and instruction of children they allow no share, either of teaching or of discipline, to the ministers of the Church; and in many places they have procured that the education of youth shall be exclusively in the hands of laymen, and that nothing which treats of the most important and most holy duties of men to God shall be introduced into the instructions on morals.&#34; Paragraph 21, <a class="externallink" href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13HUMAN.HTM" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13HUMAN.HTM">Humanum Genus</a></li><li id="_note-3"><b><a href="#_ref-3" title="">&uarr;</a></b> Paragraphs 22 and 23, <a class="externallink" href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13HUMAN.HTM" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13HUMAN.HTM">Humanum Genus</a></li><li id="_note-4"><b><a href="#_ref-4" title="">&uarr;</a></b> Paragraph 25, <a class="externallink" href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13HUMAN.HTM" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13HUMAN.HTM">Humanum Genus</a></li><li id="_note-para22">&uarr; <a href="#_ref-para22_a" title=""><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></a> <a href="#_ref-para22_b" title=""><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></a> <a href="#_ref-para22_c" title=""><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></a> Paragraph 22, <a class="externallink" href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13HUMAN.HTM" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13HUMAN.HTM">Humanum Genus</a></li><li id="_note-6"><b><a href="#_ref-6" title="">&uarr;</a></b> April 29, 1962 dinner honoring 49 Nobel Laureates (<i>Simpson’s Contemporary Quotations</i>, 1988, from <i>Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States</i>: John F.
