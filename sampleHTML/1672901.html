{{Nihongo}}, is a <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japanese</a> <a href="/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction" id="w">post-apocalyptic</a> <a href="/wiki/Visual_novel" id="w">visual novel</a> centering around a middle-aged man who comes across a malfunctioning robot in a dead city. The man, known simply as &#34;the junker&#34;, stays with this robot for a time and attempts to fix the projector of the <a href="/wiki/Planetarium" id="w">planetarium</a> where the story takes place.</p>
<p><i>Planetarian</i> was first released on the Internet in 2004 by <a href="/wiki/Key_(company)" id="w">Key</a>, a Japanese software studio whose previous works include <i><a href="/wiki/Kanon" id="w">Kanon</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Air_(visual_novel)" id="w">Air</a></i>. Unlike those two games, <i>Planetarian</i> did not contain <a href="/wiki/Eroge" id="w">adult</a> content, and was the second of Key&#39;s products to do this, the first being <i><a href="/wiki/Clannad_(visual_novel)" id="w">Clannad</a></i>. It was later re-released on <a href="/wiki/April_28" id="w">April 28</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> on <a href="/wiki/CD-ROM" id="w">CD-ROM</a> with full voice acting for the female lead.<sup id="_ref-ncsx_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ncsx" title="">[1]</a></sup> A limited edition version was sold for pre-orders and early buyers; in it included a 243-page book of short stories set in the world of <i>Planetarian</i> and some included a bonus <a href="/wiki/Shitajiki" id="w">shitajiki</a>, or pencil board. A <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_2" id="w">PlayStation 2</a> port published by <a href="/wiki/Prototype_(company)" id="w">Prototype</a> and a portable version of the game produced by <a href="/wiki/NTT_DoCoMo" id="w">NTT DoCoMo</a> were released in 2006. The mobile version was used on <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_Mobile_Multimedia_Access" id="w">FOMA</a> <a href="/wiki/Mobile_phone" id="w">cellular phones</a>. A <a href="/wiki/Drama_CD" id="w">drama CD</a> based on the &#34;Snow Globe&#34; short story from the promotional book was released at the end of 2006, and two more went on sale in July 2007.</p>
<p>Key defines <i>Planetarian</i> as a &#34;kinetic novel&#34;,<sup id="_ref-key_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-key" title="">[2]</a></sup> since it offers no choices or alternate endings. Instead, the player proceeds through the story solely by reading. In that sense, <i>Planetarian</i>, unlike Key&#39;s past works, is not a game. In addition, <i>Planetarian</i> is the only Key production not to have <a href="/wiki/Itaru_Hinoue" id="w">Itaru Hinoue</a> as an artist, using <a href="/wiki/Eeji_Komatsu" id="w">Eeji Komatsu</a> instead. Key&#39;s signature musical <a href="/wiki/Composer" id="w">composers</a> <a href="/wiki/Shinji_Orito" id="w">Shinji Orito</a> and <a href="/wiki/Magome_Togoshi" id="w">Magome Togoshi</a> arranged the music on the game&#39;s original soundtrack.<sup id="_ref-keydisc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keydisc" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Gameplay" name="Gameplay"></a><h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Unlike traditional <a href="/wiki/Visual_novel" id="w">visual novels</a>, no choices are given to the player to advance the story in alternate directions, and there is only one ending possible; this is what Key referred to as a <a href="/wiki/KineticNovel" id="w">kinetic novel</a>.<sup id="_ref-key_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-key" title="">[2]</a></sup> The player can choose when to go to the next <a href="/wiki/Dialogue" id="w">dialogue</a> screen or put the game on autoplay. In this respect, the player does not play the game as if it were a video game but plays it rather more like one would play a music track on a <a href="/wiki/Compact_disc" id="w">CD</a> or play a <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVD</a> movie. During gameplay, the player can choose to hide the text from view, and go back to any previous lines.<sup id="_ref-ncsx_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ncsx" title="">[1]</a></sup> Another option includes choosing to save at any time, but there are only five save slots available. A load option is also available where the player can load any of the automatically-saved chapter markers, or choose to load any of the manually saved games.<sup id="_ref-ncsx_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ncsx" title="">[1]</a></sup> The length of <i>Planetarian<b>s story is shorter than typical visual novels and is the shortest of Key&#39;s games. Excluding the opening and ending sequences, there are sixteen parts to the story; the first half of the story is set within the planetarium while the latter half is set outside in the ruined city where the planetarium resides. The entire novel takes four hours and forty minutes to complete on auto-play.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> After the game has been completed at least once, two new options appear on the title screen. The first is a feature that allows the player to view <a href="/wiki/CG_artwork" id="w">CG artwork</a> observed in the game, totaling twenty separate images. The second option allows the player to replay eight out of the nine music tracks played in the game.<sup id="_ref-moby_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-moby" title="">[5]</a></sup></b></i></p>

</p><a id="Setting" name="Setting"></a><h3>Setting</h3>
<p>The game is set in a <a href="/wiki/Post-apocalyptic" id="w">post-apocalyptic</a> world. It is said that due to the depletion of natural resources, <a href="/wiki/Overpopulation" id="w">overpopulation</a>, and the failure of the Space Exploration Project, mankind has virtually eradicated itself through <a href="/wiki/Biological_warfare" id="w">biological</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_warfare" id="w">nuclear warfare</a>, turning a once prosperous civilization into complete ruin, cast in darkness and poisoned by constant rain<sup id="_ref-story_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-story" title="">[6]</a></sup> from <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_fallout" id="w">nuclear fallout</a>. One such military invasion in the past history was at <a href="/wiki/Mare_Nectaris" id="w">Mare Nectaris</a>. Thirty years later, machines manufactured during the war have taken over, continuing the bloodshed in a <a href="/wiki/Dystopia" id="w">dystopic</a> world, killing any remaining humans who trespass on their territory. Of the surviving humans, there are those known as &#34;junkers&#34; who go around scavenging for anything in order to survive; the protagonist in the story is one such junker.</p>
<p>The main location where most of the story takes place is the fictional Flowercrest Department Store in a derelict city. It is based on the real <a href="/wiki/Matsubishi_Department_Store" id="w">Matsubishi Department Store</a> of <a href="/wiki/Hamamatsu%2C_Shizuoka" id="w">Hamamatsu, Shizuoka</a> in <a href="/wiki/Japan" id="w">Japan</a>, though the planetarium on the rooftop is purely fictional.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> The onset of the story takes place within the planetarium which is where the junker first meets Yumemi. The room is filled with seats which are slightly inclined back to give the customers a better view of the ceiling during a show. The most prominent feature in the room when a show is not taking place is the large black planetarium projector called &#34;Miss Jena&#34;, which is placed on a stage in front of the seats.</p>
<p>The planetarium has electricity when the junker arrives, but only for a short time. Once a year for 168 hours, electricity in the planetarium is operational, but the projector is broken. The rest of the floors in the department store are run-down; mold and rats run rampant.

<a id="Characters" name="Characters"></a><h3>Characters</h3>
<dl><dt>{{Nihongo}}</dt></dl><dl><dd>The junker is a nameless middle-aged human soldier, living the life of a &#34;junker&#34;, scavenging useful items among the ruins to survive. He enters a derelict city searching for undamaged goods, and goes into hiding after fleeing from an encounter with dangerous mobile war machines. Rather than retreating and resupplying himself, he heads deeper into the ruins and enters an old abandoned <a href="/wiki/Planetarium" id="w">planetarium</a> on the roof of an abandoned building he first thought was a military facility. There, he meets Yumemi Hoshino, a robot designed to look like a young girl who annoys him greatly due to her constant talking.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The junker has a tough personality that comes from trying to survive in a <a href="/wiki/Dystopia" id="w">dystopic</a> world. To survive, he carries a <a href="/wiki/Grenade_launcher" id="w">grenade launcher</a> with him and covers his person with a water-proof coat to protect his skin from the toxic rain. For water, he has a canteen with a water-purifier that can purify the rain. He is constantly searching for rarer substances such as cigarettes and alcohol which fetch a big price if sold. {{anime voices}}<div style="wigth:200px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:200px-Planetarian_screenshot.jpg" title="Example of what average conversation looks like in &#39;&#39;Planetarian&#39;&#39;.

<div class="thumbcaption">Example of what average conversation looks like in <i>Planetarian</i>. Here, the junker is talking with Yumemi.</div></div>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>{{Nihongo}}</dt></dl><dl><dd>Yumemi, named <b>Reverie Planetarian</b> in the unofficial English translation, is a good-natured but extremely talkative <a href="/wiki/Robot" id="w">robot</a> attendant of an abandoned planetarium; she is designed to look like a young female human. Yumemi is slightly damaged and completely unaware of the changes that have occurred in the past thirty years,<sup id="_ref-story_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-story" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> as none of the facilities and databases that she connects to exist anymore. Therefore, she treats the junker like a regular guest by calling him {{Nihongo}}, speaks of the world as it was before the war, and fails to understand any information he tells her, other than things related to her job at the planetarium. The name &#34;Hoshino Yumemi&#34; itself is a pun &#8212; &#34;hoshi&#34; means star or planetary body; &#34;no&#34; is a possessive particle; &#34;yume&#34; is a dream or a reverie; &#34;mi&#34; means see. Yumemi is the only character shown to the audience of the game.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Yumemi is very adamant about protecting humans and is happiest when she is in the care of the beloved humans she serves. When she is unable to help someone who asks needs it, she gets terribly worried that she is incapable of offering assistance and must instead indirectly help a customer by directing him or her to someone who can. <a href="/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics" id="w">Protecting humans is her top priority</a> and will even ignore previous orders to make sure no human is harmed when in her care. {{anime voices}}</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>{{Nihongo}}</dt></dl><dl><dd>The planetarium director is the manager of the planetarium that Yumemi works at. He is spoken of by Yumemi throughout most of the story and only appears near the ending in a hazy holographic video which is projected from Yumemi&#39;s own memories; only a <a href="/wiki/Silhouette" id="w">silhouette</a> is visible as he stands among four other coworkers. He is depicted as a man who treated Yumemi well, and more as a coworker than a robot. {{anime voices}}</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>{{Nihongo}}</dt></dl><dl><dd>The elder junker is an older man in the same situation as the protagonist, but is never shown; he is only spoken of by the junker. The elder junker told the protagonist about when he once happened across a dead city and found a talkative robot; it is never explicitly stated whether the robot he met was Yumemi or not. The elder junker told the junker that if he were to ever enter the same city he had to not talk to the robot he met under any circumstance. The junker later is reminded of the elder junker&#39;s warning after he finds out how talkative Yumemi can be. {{anime voices}}</dd></dl>
<a id="Story" name="Story"></a><h3>Story</h3>
<p>While dodging detection from killer machines, the junker enters a building with a dome on the roof to search for usable supplies. Inside the dome, he meets Yumemi, who offers to show him a special commemorative projection especially reserved for the 2,500,000th customer, although he is in fact the 2,497,290th customer. Despite his aggravation with her, he agrees to attend her show. However, the projector device, &#34;Miss <a href="/wiki/Jena" id="w">Jena</a>&#34;,<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> has broken down and is in need of repair. Curiously, he tries to repair it himself,<sup id="_ref-story_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-story" title="">[6]</a></sup> and in the process, understands that the planetarium is not a military building but an amusement attraction. It turns out that his arrival is of sheer coincidence, as the place runs on an old power generator somewhere in the city still giving minimal power, which is only enough to recharge Yumemi to operate for exactly one week every year. After Miss Jena is repaired enough to function mechanically, Yumemi plugs herself in to start the show, and presents an amazing projection of the starry sky, something missing from the outside world because of the polluted skies. Unfortunately, the power finally goes out in the midst of the show, but Yumemi proceeds through the rest of the event with no visuals at the request of the protagonist.<div style="wigth:200px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:200px-Planetarian_screenshot_of_the_starry_sky.png" title="Yumemi &#34;shows&#34; the junker the night sky after the power goes out."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200px-Planetarian_screenshot_of_the_starry_sky.png" alt="Yumemi &#34;shows&#34; the junker the night sky after the power goes out." title="Yumemi &#34;shows&#34; the junker the night sky after the power goes out." class="location-left type-thumb" width="200px" />
</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Yumemi &#34;shows&#34; the junker the night sky after the power goes out.</div></div>
</p>
<p>Both of them eventually leave the planetarium, as Yumemi insists on escorting her customer back to his vehicle outside the city walls. It is during this time that he devises a plan to quietly transport Yumemi out of the city when her battery completely runs out, and later find a way to re-activate her and obtain a portable projector so that they can travel to various refugee encampments together and show the remaining humans her presentation. When they reach the city walls, he spots a machine he calls a <a href="/wiki/Fiddler_crab" id="w">fiddler crab</a> due to its design guarding the entrance in which he came from, and he tells Yumemi to stay put while he leaves to destroy it. Armed with only a <a href="/wiki/Grenade_launcher" id="w">grenade launcher</a>, he tries to take down the machine with his remaining <a href="/wiki/High_explosive_squash_head" id="w">high explosive squash head</a> rounds covertly, but a dud blows his cover and he is forced to face the machine front on, and thus is completely outmatched by it, breaking his right leg while evading its gunfire. Programmed with the directive to protect human life before performing all other orders, Yumemi ignores the earlier request to stand still and approaches the machine to try and electronically command it to retreat. Before the protagonist can capitalize on the distraction and finish the machine off, Yumemi is literally blown in half by its machine guns, destroying her main battery.</p>
<p>Irreparably damaged from the attack and being further destroyed by the toxic rain shorting her now exposed internals, she attempts one last time to send a distress call to the no longer existent planetarium database. She spends her emergency battery life replaying her pre-war memories to him using a tiny hologram projector on her ear. She visually recollects the day she was activated, cheerful experiences with past customers, and the day the entire city was evacuated as war broke out, with the other planetarium workers unwillingly leaving her behind. When the video fades, she reveals that she had known that the planetarium would never have more customers during the thirty years she was alone, despite her apparent infinite optimism up to this point. She prays to the stars and wishes to serve humans forevermore in heaven as she &#34;dies&#34; in front of him. To comfort her, he lies and makes up a story that he was specifically sent by her human coworkers to pull her from the city and take her to her new place of work, indirectly referring to his own earlier plans to rescue her. In her final moment, she ejects the memory card from her artificial brain for his safekeeping. Touched and completely shaken by the loss of the beautiful world she left in his mind, he throws away his gun and puts the memory card in his coat, before wandering off with a broken leg as the fallen war machine&#39;s automated backup close in on the scene.</p>

The musical tracks played at the beginning and the end of the game (track one and eight in the original soundtrack) are rearrangements of the <a href="/wiki/Hymn" id="w">hymn</a> &#34;<a href="/wiki/What_a_Friend_We_Have_in_Jesus" id="w">What a Friend We Have in Jesus</a>&#34; by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Crozat_Converse" id="w">Charles Crozat Converse</a>, and their titles reflect this as well: the original title &#34;Hoshi no Sekai ~Opening~&#34; refers to the Japanese version of the hymn named &#34;Hoshinoyo&#34;,<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> and &#34;Itsukushimi Fukaki&#34; is the Japanese translation of the hymn&#39;s original title.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>The first <a href="/wiki/Drama_CD" id="w">drama CD</a> entitled <i><a href="/wiki/List_of_Planetarian_albums#A snow globe" id="w">a snow globe</a></i> was released on <a href="/wiki/December_29" id="w">December 29</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> during Comiket 71,<sup id="_ref-keydisc_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keydisc" title="">[3]</a></sup> and was re-released on <a href="/wiki/May_25" id="w">May 25</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.<sup id="_ref-keydisc_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keydisc" title="">[3]</a></sup> As its name suggests, the CD covers the &#34;Snow Globe&#34; story from the limited edition book. The opening track takes place one year before the junker arrives at the planetarium and the &#34;Snow Globe&#34; story is told as a flashback. The end of the drama CD is where the kinetic novel begins. A second drama CD entitled <i><a href="/wiki/List_of_Planetarian_albums#Jerusalem" id="w">Jerusalem</a></i> was released on <a href="/wiki/July_27" id="w">July 27</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> and covers the &#34;Jerusalem&#34; story from the limited edition book. The final drama CD entitled <i><a href="/wiki/List_of_Planetarian_albums#Hoshi no Hito" id="w">Hoshi no Hito</a></i> was released on the same day as the second drama CD and covers the &#34;Hoshi no Hito&#34; and &#34;Tircis and Aminte&#34; stories from the limited edition book. The &#34;Hoshi no Hito&#34; story plays like a regular drama CD with several different voice actors acting out the parts, but &#34;Tircis and Aminte&#34; is just a recited story by <a href="/wiki/Keiko_Suzuki" id="w">Keiko Suzuki</a>, the voice actress who plays Yumemi Hoshino.<sup id="_ref-keydisc_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-keydisc" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h2>Reception</h2>
<p><i>Planetarian</i> was the first game under the brand name <a href="/wiki/KineticNovel" id="w">KineticNovel</a> to be described by the term &#34;kinetic novel&#34;,<sup id="_ref-knsite_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-knsite" title="">[11]</a></sup> and is one of only two kinetic novels to be featured in the <i><a href="/wiki/Lyc%C3%A8e_Trading_Card_Game" id="w">Lycèe Trading Card Game</a></i>, the other being <i>Fushigi no Kuni no Kanojo</i>. The PC version of the visual novel was positively reviewed by the visual novel-based website visual-novels.net. The reviewer commented, &#34;You know that you are not able to change the story, the good things and the bad things which are going to happen. The reason I recommend Planetarian is because of it&#39;s interesting story, the bombastic soundtrack, and the lovely graphics. Though this game doesn&#39;t provide that much of content, I think it&#39;s still something which should appeal to everyone, not just a <i>Key</i> fan.&#34;<sup id="_ref-PCreviewvn.net_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PCreviewvn.net" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
