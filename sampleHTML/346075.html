<p><b>Robert Bernard &#39;Robbie&#39; Fowler</b>, (born <a href="/wiki/9_April" id="w">9 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1975" id="w">1975</a> in <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" id="w">Liverpool</a>, <a href="/wiki/Merseyside" id="w">Merseyside</a>) is an <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> <a href="/wiki/Football_(soccer)" id="w">footballer</a> who plays for <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Championship" id="w">Championship</a> side <a href="/wiki/Cardiff_City_F.C." id="w">Cardiff City</a>. </p>
<p>Fowler&#39;s career began with <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_F.C." id="w">Liverpool</a>. He signed as a youth team player on leaving school in the summer of <a href="/wiki/1991" id="w">1991</a>, and signed professional on <a href="/wiki/9_April" id="w">9 April</a> <a href="/wiki/1992" id="w">1992</a> - his 17th birthday. He made his first-team debut the following season and was soon established as a regular first-team player. Fowler scored 120 premiership goals for Liverpool in an eight year period. He subsequently played for <a href="/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C." id="w">Leeds United</a> and <a href="/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C." id="w">Manchester City</a>, before returning to Liverpool in January 2006. As of December 2007, Fowler is the fourth <a href="/wiki/FA_Premier_League#Top scorers" id="w">highest goalscorer</a> in <a href="/wiki/FA_Premier_League" id="w">Premier League</a> history.</p>
<p>He has been <a href="/wiki/Cap_(football)" id="w">capped</a> for <a href="/wiki/England_national_football_team" id="w">England</a> twenty-six times, scoring seven goals. The most recent of these appearances came in the <a href="/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_2002" id="w">2002 World Cup</a>.</p>
<a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Fowler was born in Liverpool and brought up in the <a href="/wiki/Toxteth" id="w">Toxteth</a> area where he was known as Robert Ryder. He lived in Toxteth at the time of the <a href="/wiki/1981" id="w">1981</a> <a href="/wiki/Toxteth_riots" id="w">Toxteth riots</a>, when he was six years old. As a youngster he supported <a href="/wiki/Everton_F.C." id="w">Everton</a>, regularly travelling to <a href="/wiki/Goodison_Park" id="w">Goodison Park</a>. He played regularly for schoolboy team Thorvald, and once scored 16 times in a 26–0 rout.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> He was selected for Liverpool Schoolboys from the age of 11 and was spotted by Liverpool scout Jim Aspinall. He began training with Liverpool once a week and signed schoolboy forms with the club. Two years later he signed as a <a href="/wiki/Youth_Training_Scheme" id="w">YTS</a> trainee, and turned professional on his 17th birthday.<sup id="_ref-4thegame_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4thegame" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Career" name="Career"></a><h2>Career</h2>
<a id="Liverpool" name="Liverpool"></a><h3>Liverpool</h3>
<p>Fowler&#39;s first involvement with the Liverpool first team came on <a href="/wiki/13_January" id="w">13 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1993" id="w">1993</a>, when he was an unused substitute in an <a href="/wiki/FA_Cup" id="w">FA Cup</a> tie against <a href="/wiki/Bolton_Wanderers_F.C." id="w">Bolton Wanderers</a>. In the following close season, Fowler helped the <a href="/wiki/England_national_under-18_football_team" id="w">England Under-18</a> team to win the 1993 European Championship,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> before making a scoring first-team debut in Liverpool&#39;s 3&#8211;1 win in a first round <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Cup" id="w">Coca Cola Cup</a> tie at <a href="/wiki/Fulham_F.C." id="w">Fulham</a> on <a href="/wiki/22_September" id="w">22 September</a> <a href="/wiki/1993" id="w">1993</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Fowler scored all five goals in the second leg at Anfield two weeks later, making him the fourth player in Liverpool&#39;s history to score five in a senior fixture.<sup id="_ref-4thegame_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4thegame" title="">[2]</a></sup> He scored his first league <a href="/wiki/Hat-trick" id="w">hat-trick</a> against <a href="/wiki/Southampton_F.C." id="w">Southampton</a> in only his fifth league game. His first 13 games for the club yielded 12 goals, and he was rewarded with an <a href="/wiki/England_national_under-21_football_team" id="w">England Under-21</a> debut against <a href="/wiki/San_Marino_national_football_team" id="w">San Marino</a> in November 1993, in which he scored England&#39;s opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio throughout the season, but finished his first season as the club&#39;s leading scorer with 18 goals in all competitions.<sup id="_ref-4thegame_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4thegame" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/1994-95_in_English_football" id="w">1994–95 season</a>, Fowler was an ever-present for Liverpool, playing in all of their 57 matches, including the victory in the <a href="/wiki/1995_Football_League_Cup_Final" id="w">1995 League Cup final</a>, and a match against <a href="/wiki/Arsenal_F.C." id="w">Arsenal</a> in which he scored a hat-trick in four minutes 33 seconds,<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> a Premiership record. Fowler was voted the <a href="/wiki/PFA_Young_Player_of_the_Year" id="w">PFA Young Player of the Year</a> in two consecutive years in 1995 and 1996,<sup id="_ref-MEN factfile_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MEN factfile" title="">[6]</a></sup> a feat equalled only by <a href="/wiki/Ryan_Giggs" id="w">Ryan Giggs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Rooney" id="w">Wayne Rooney</a>.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Throughout the mid and late 1990s, Fowler was widely considered to be the most natural finisher playing in England.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Fowler sealed this reputation as he scored more than 30 goals for three consecutive seasons, up to 1997. <a href="/wiki/Stan_Collymore" id="w">Stan Collymore</a>, Fowler&#39;s old strike partner, said in his autobiography that Fowler was the best player he has ever played with. Fowler and Collymore were among the most lethal strike partnership in England during the <a href="/wiki/1995-96_in_English_football" id="w">1995–96</a> season. In the same season he scored twice in a 4–3 victory over <a href="/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C." id="w">Newcastle United</a>, a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fowler received a call-up to the full England squad for the first time in 1996, winning his first cap on <a href="/wiki/27_March" id="w">27 March</a> against <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria_national_football_team" id="w">Bulgaria</a> as a substitute,<sup id="_ref-MEN factfile_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MEN factfile" title="">[6]</a></sup> and making his first start at international level in England&#39;s next match, against <a href="/wiki/Croatia_national_football_team" id="w">Croatia</a>. Fowler was part of the England squad for <a href="/wiki/1996_European_Football_Championship" id="w">Euro 96</a>, making two appearances in the tournament.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/14_December" id="w">14 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a>, he scored four against <a href="/wiki/Middlesbrough_F.C." id="w">Middlesbrough</a>, including his hundredth for the club. This meant he reached a century of goals one game quicker than his mentor, <a href="/wiki/Ian_Rush" id="w">Ian Rush</a>.</p>
<p>That year, he also won a <a href="/wiki/UEFA" id="w">UEFA</a> <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Fair_Play_ranking" id="w">Fair Play</a> award for admitting that he had not been fouled by <a href="/wiki/David_Seaman" id="w">David Seaman</a> at <a href="/wiki/Arsenal_Stadium" id="w">Highbury</a> after a penalty had been given.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> After unsuccessfully trying to convince the referee to change his decision about the penalty Fowler took it tamely and Seaman saved, the ball rebounded however and <a href="/wiki/Jason_McAteer" id="w">Jason McAteer</a> scored.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fowler was part of a group of Liverpool players from the mid-1990s who were nicknamed &#34;The Spice Boys&#34; by the press following a series of off-field controversies. The term was coined by the <a href="/wiki/Daily_Mail" id="w">Daily Mail</a>, and arose due to misplaced rumours that Fowler was dating <a href="/wiki/Spice_Girls" id="w">Spice Girl</a> <a href="/wiki/Emma_Bunton" id="w">Emma Bunton</a>.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The term was subsequently used in a derogatory manner, implying Fowler and colleagues such as <a href="/wiki/Jamie_Redknapp" id="w">Jamie Redknapp</a>, Stan Collymore, <a href="/wiki/David_James_(footballer)" id="w">David James</a> and <a href="/wiki/Steve_McManaman" id="w">Steve McManaman</a> were underachieving playboys. </p>
<p>A downturn in Fowler&#39;s fortunes began in 1998, after a knee ligament injury kept him out of action for half the season and caused him to miss the <a href="/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_1998" id="w">1998 World Cup</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> This injury coincided with the rise of <a href="/wiki/Michael_Owen" id="w">Michael Owen</a>, whose debut came in 1997. Owen established himself in the Liverpool team in Fowler&#39;s absence. </p>
<p>In 1999, Fowler was fined £60,000 by his club for bringing the game into disrepute after he had mimed snorting <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" id="w">cocaine</a> off the white line of the <a href="/wiki/Penalty_area_(football)" id="w">penalty area</a> while celebrating his goal against Everton.<sup id="_ref-MEN factfile_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MEN factfile" title="">[6]</a></sup> Defending himself, he said that he was getting back at Everton fans who had insulted him with false accusations of <a href="/wiki/Recreational_drug_use" id="w">drug abuse</a>. Fowler received a four match suspension from <a href="/wiki/The_Football_Association" id="w">the FA</a> for this incident. At the same FA disciplinary hearing, Fowler received a further two match suspension due to a separate incident in which he had <a href="/wiki/Homophobic" id="w">homophobically</a> taunted the non-gay <a href="/wiki/Chelsea_F.C." id="w">Chelsea</a> defender <a href="/wiki/Graeme_Le_Saux" id="w">Graeme Le Saux</a> by waving his backside at him as Le Saux&#39;s wife and children watched from the stands. The FA imposed a £32,000 fine for the two incidents.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Treble_season" name="Treble_season"></a><h4>Treble season</h4>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/2000-01_in_English_football" id="w">2000–01 season</a> was Fowler’s most successful season. He appeared in three finals, scoring 17 goals and lifting three trophies in a unique <a href="/wiki/The_Treble" id="w">cup treble</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> In the absence of Jamie Redknapp, who was sidelined by injury, Fowler was named Liverpool captain when starting.<sup id="_ref-4thegame_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4thegame" title="">[2]</a></sup> However he found himself the third choice Liverpool striker, with Houllier favouring a forward partnership of Michael Owen and <a href="/wiki/Emile_Heskey" id="w">Emile Heskey</a>.<sup id="_ref-4thegame_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4thegame" title="">[2]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>He did take part in a fourth round <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Cup" id="w">League Cup</a> hammering of <a href="/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C" id="w">Stoke City</a> scoring a hat trick in an 8–0 victory en route to Liverpool’s first of three finals.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> In the <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Cup_Final_2001" id="w">final</a> against <a href="/wiki/Birmingham_F.C." id="w">Birmingham</a>, the club&#39;s first cup final since 1996, he captained the side, scoring on 30 minutes. Liverpool went on to win the trophy on penalties. Fowler picked up the Alan Hardaker Man of the Match award and lifted the trophy.</p>
<p>Fowler’s season picked up from there as he scored several important goals including a goal against <a href="/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C." id="w">Manchester United</a> and a free kick in the <a href="/wiki/FA_Cup" id="w">FA Cup</a> semi-final against <a href="/wiki/Wycombe_Wanderers_F.C." id="w">Wycombe Wanderers</a>. According to <a href="/wiki/Steven_Gerrard" id="w">Steven Gerrard</a>&#39;s autobiography, <a href="/wiki/Gary_McAllister" id="w">Gary McAllister</a> was supposed to take the free-kick, but Fowler, knowing this, pulled one of his infamous cheeky antics and struck it before McAllister could get there. McAllister was seen chasing Fowler around, and, according to the book, &#34;People thought he [Gary Mac] was trying to congratulate Robbie. Bollocks! He was chasing him because he was going to throttle him!&#34; He featured as a substitute <a href="/wiki/FA_Cup_Final_2001" id="w">2001 FA Cup Final</a> coming on as a 77th minute replacement for <a href="/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_%C5%A0micer" id="w">Vladimír Šmicer</a>. Liverpool, who were 1–0 down at that point, eventually won the game 2–1 with two goals from Michael Owen. Fowler raised the trophy along with <a href="/wiki/Sami_Hyypi%C3%A4" id="w">Sami Hyypiä</a> and Jamie Redknap.</p>
<p>Four days later he was a substitute again in Liverpool’s third final, the <a href="/wiki/2001_UEFA_Cup_Final" id="w">2001 UEFA Cup Final</a> against <a href="/wiki/Deportivo_Alav%C3%A9s" id="w">Alavés</a>. He came on in the 64th minute for Emilie Heskey with the score at 3–3. He scored seven minutes later but Alavés equalised before full time and Liverpool eventually won with a <a href="/wiki/Golden_goal" id="w">golden goal</a>, an own goal, in the 116th minute.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> Fowler and Hyypia then raised Liverpool’s third trophy of the season together. Liverpool’s next and final game of the season was against <a href="/wiki/Charlton_Athletic_F.C." id="w">Charlton Athletic</a>. Fowler scored twice in a 4–0 victory that assured them <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League" id="w">Champions League</a> qualification for next season.</p>
<a id="Liverpool_departure" name="Liverpool_departure"></a><h4>Liverpool departure</h4>
<p>Fowler began the <a href="/wiki/2001-02_in_English_football" id="w">2001–02 season</a> amidst controversy with then Liverpool manager <a href="/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_Houllier" id="w">Gérard Houllier</a> when he was dropped from the entire squad for Liverpool&#39;s 2–1 victory in the 2001 <a href="/wiki/Community_Shield" id="w">Community Shield</a> match against rivals Manchester United.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> He made an appearance in Liverpool&#39;s 3–2 victory over European Champions <a href="/wiki/Bayern_Munich" id="w">Bayern Munich</a>,<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> but starts were intermittent. In October <a href="/wiki/2001" id="w">2001</a>, he scored his first league hat-trick for three years, helping Liverpool beat <a href="/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C." id="w">Leicester City</a> 4&#8211;1, but was dropped for the following league game. Speculation over Fowler&#39;s future persisted for most of Houllier&#39;s tenure and became an issue that divided Liverpool fans.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>His last appearance before leaving the club was against <a href="/wiki/Sunderland_F.C." id="w">Sunderland</a>, in which he was substituted at half-time.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Leeds_United" name="Leeds_United"></a><h3>Leeds United</h3>
<p>Despite his popularity with Liverpool fans, who referred to Fowler as &#34;God&#34;,<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup>  a combination of off-field controversy, disputes with Gérard Houllier and training ground arguments with then Assistant Manager <a href="/wiki/Phil_Thompson" id="w">Phil Thompson</a>,<sup id="_ref-ESPN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ESPN" title="">[25]</a></sup> led to Fowler&#39;s departure to Leeds United. Fowler maintains that Houllier forced him out of Liverpool, and accused Houllier of pressuring the <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Echo" id="w">Liverpool Echo</a> newspaper to use its influence to turn opinion against him.<sup id="_ref-Observer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Observer" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>The transfer went ahead just one month after his hat-trick at Leicester with a fee of £11 million. He made his Leeds debut in an away game against Fulham,<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> the same venue as his Liverpool debut. Fowler scored 12 goals in the remainder of the season, helping Leeds to a <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Cup" id="w">UEFA Cup</a> qualifying place. Fowler was included in the England squad for the <a href="/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup" id="w">2002 World Cup</a>, but only made one appearance, coming on as substitute in a second round win over <a href="/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team" id="w">Denmark</a>. </p>
<p>Fowler suffered an aggravation of a pre-existing hip injury in the 2002–03 pre-season, and did not recover until December.<sup id="_ref-ESPN_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ESPN" title="">[25]</a></sup> Struggling to gain fitness, and seeing team-mates sold off due to a financial crisis, Fowler&#39;s form and market value diminished. However, in total he scored 15 goals in 31 appearances for Leeds; a goal every two games.</p>
<a id="Manchester_City" name="Manchester_City"></a><h3>Manchester City</h3>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/2002-03_in_English_football" id="w">2002–03 season</a>, Fowler was transferred to <a href="/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C." id="w">Manchester City</a> following a protracted transfer saga. Fowler initially turned down the move, and a dispute between Manchester City manager <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Keegan" id="w">Kevin Keegan</a> and chairman <a href="/wiki/David_Bernstein_(executive)" id="w">David Bernstein</a> over whether the transfer should take place due to medical concerns resulted in Bernstein leaving the club.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> Following encouragement from Keegan, Fowler finally signed for Manchester City on <a href="/wiki/16_January" id="w">16 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a> for an initial fee of £3 million and a further £3 million dependent upon appearances.<sup id="_ref-MEN factfile_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MEN factfile" title="">[6]</a></sup> Bizarre transfer conditions meant Leeds United still paid a significant proportion of Fowler&#39;s wages.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> Fowler made his Manchester City debut against <a href="/wiki/West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C." id="w">West Bromwich Albion</a> on <a href="/wiki/1_February" id="w">1 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2003" id="w">2003</a>,<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> but made a poor start to his Manchester City career, scoring just two goals in the remainder of the season. </p>
<p>Fowler continued to struggle with fitness problems in the <a href="/wiki/2003-04_in_English_football" id="w">2003–04</a> season, completing the full 90 minutes only nine times, however he did score against his old club Liverpool in a 2&#8211;2 home fixture with virtually the last kick of the game. The arrival of close friend Steve McManaman from <a href="/wiki/Real_Madrid" id="w">Real Madrid</a> gave hope, but the pair failed to rekindle their prolific partnership of yesteryear, and received criticism from the fans and tabloids for their salaries and alleged excesses.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> In 2004 Fowler, depressed by his lack of form and fitness, considered retiring, but was persuaded to carry on by Keegan and <a href="/wiki/Stuart_Pearce" id="w">Stuart Pearce</a>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> He then showed a marked improvement in the second half of the <a href="/wiki/2004-05_in_English_football" id="w">2004–2005 season</a>, scoring his 150th Premiership goal in the 3&#8211;2 win over <a href="/wiki/Norwich_City_F.C." id="w">Norwich City</a> on <a href="/wiki/28_February" id="w">28 February</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>. However, his failure to convert a 90th minute penalty kick against <a href="/wiki/Middlesbrough_F.C." id="w">Middlesbrough</a> in the final game of the season prevented Manchester City from gaining a place in the <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Cup" id="w">UEFA Cup</a>.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> Fowler ended the season as the club&#39;s joint top goal scorer,<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> and gained the approval of the fans, finishing in the top three in the fans&#39; Player of the Year poll, described by Fowler as &#34;one of the proudest achievements of my career&#34;.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fowler had injury problems at the start of the <a href="/wiki/2005-06_in_English_football" id="w">2005–06 season</a>, and rarely featured when fit, making just two substitute appearances in the first four months of the season. His first start of the season came against <a href="/wiki/Scunthorpe_United_F.C." id="w">Scunthorpe United</a> in the FA Cup on <a href="/wiki/7_January" id="w">7 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, in which he scored a hat-trick.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> The following week he scored Manchester City&#39;s third goal in their 3&#8211;1 win against local rivals Manchester United after coming on as substitute. After scoring, he ran to the United supporters, holding up five fingers in reference to Liverpool&#39;s five <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League" id="w">European Cup</a> wins, in comparison to United&#39;s two. His goal celebration against United would prove to have added significance in the following weeks. However, Fowler made only one more appearance for Manchester City before returning to Liverpool on a free transfer.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Return_to_Liverpool" name="Return_to_Liverpool"></a><h3>Return to Liverpool</h3>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/27_January" id="w">27 January</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, Fowler rejoined Liverpool from Manchester City on a free transfer, signing a contract until the end of the season. Fowler had remained a Liverpool fan after he left the club; he was in the <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" id="w">Istanbul</a> crowd when Liverpool won the Champions League in 2005.</p>
<p>Fowler&#39;s return against <a href="/wiki/Birmingham_City_F.C." id="w">Birmingham City</a> in February 2006 was labelled by the tabloid press as the stuff of fairytales,<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> and he himself said he felt like &#34;a kid waking up on Christmas morning every day&#34;.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Fowler&#39;s first appearance back at <a href="/wiki/Anfield" id="w">Anfield</a> was as a substitute against Birmingham, receiving a standing ovation upon his introduction.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> After his return, he had three goals ruled out for offside, before finally getting off the mark on <a href="/wiki/15_March" id="w">15 March</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> in a home game against Fulham, the same opponents against which he scored his first ever goal for Liverpool 13 years earlier. </p>
<p>Fowler&#39;s next Liverpool goal, against <a href="/wiki/West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C." id="w">West Bromwich Albion</a>, meant he overtook <a href="/wiki/Kenny_Dalglish" id="w">Kenny Dalglish</a> in the club&#39;s all time top scorers, while he marked his 31st birthday with a goal against Bolton Wanderers. He made it four goals in five games when he scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over <a href="/wiki/Blackburn_Rovers_F.C." id="w">Blackburn Rovers</a> on <a href="/wiki/16_April" id="w">16 April</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>. However, Fowler&#39;s fitness remained a concern. In March 2006, manager <a href="/wiki/Rafael_Benitez" id="w">Rafael Benitez</a> commented on Fowler&#39;s work and progress by saying, &#34;to buy a Robbie Fowler who is fit and scoring goals would cost a lot, maybe £10m or more&#34;. Despite concerns about his fitness, Fowler finished the <a href="/wiki/2005-06_in_English_football" id="w">2005–06</a> season scoring on a more consistent basis than Liverpool&#39;s other strikers. In May 2006 he was offered a new one year contract with the club,<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> and celebrated by scoring the first goal in Liverpool&#39;s last league game of the season in a 3–1 away win at <a href="/wiki/Portsmouth_F.C." id="w">Portsmouth</a>. It was his final game of the 2005–06 season, as he was unable to take part in the club&#39;s <a href="/wiki/2006_FA_Cup_Final" id="w">FA Cup Final</a> success due to being <a href="/wiki/Cup-tied" id="w">cup-tied</a>.</p>
<p>Fowler featured rarely in his final Liverpool season, making only six league starts. Bizarrely, all three of his League goals were penalties against <a href="/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C." id="w">Sheffield United</a>. Appearances in other competitions were more common due to Rafael Benitez&#39;s squad rotation policy. On the <a href="/wiki/25_October" id="w">25 October</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> Fowler was named as Liverpool&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Captain_(football)" id="w">captain</a> for the first time since his return in a <a href="/wiki/Football_League_Cup" id="w">League Cup</a> tie against <a href="/wiki/Reading_F.C." id="w">Reading</a>, scoring just before half-time in a 4–3 win.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/5_December" id="w">5 December</a>, Fowler scored his first two goals in the <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League" id="w">UEFA Champions League</a> competition proper against <a href="/wiki/Galatasaray_S.K." id="w">Galatasaray</a> (he had previously scored during a qualifying tie some six years prior against <a href="/wiki/FC_Haka" id="w">FC Haka</a>),<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> though Liverpool lost 3–2.</p>
<p>On the <a href="/wiki/1_May" id="w">1 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> he was a substitute in the Champions League Semi-Final against Chelsea, brought on in the last few minutes of <a href="/wiki/Extra-time" id="w">extra-time</a>. He set up an attack for <a href="/wiki/Dirk_Kuyt" id="w">Dirk Kuyt</a> but the shot went straight at the Chelsea goalkeeper. The match went into a penalty shoot-out that Liverpool won. Fowler was due to take the fifth and final spot-kick, but the game had already ended when Kuyt slotted home his winning penalty.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>In what transpired to be his last appearance for the club, against Charlton Athletic on <a href="/wiki/13_May" id="w">13 May</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, Fowler was given the captain&#39;s armband one final time. He was substituted two minutes from the final whistle and given a standing ovation. The crowd still chanted his name as the match finished and applauded him for his years of service. He finished his second run as a Liverpool player with a <a href="/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League" id="w">UEFA Champions League</a> runners up medal, however, he was not named in either the starting eleven or the seven substitutes. He became a free agent on <a href="/wiki/1_July" id="w">1 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> having scored 183 goals in 369 appearances during his two spells at the club.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Cardiff_City" name="Cardiff_City"></a><h3>Cardiff City</h3>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/21_July" id="w">21 July</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> Fowler signed a two-year contract to play for Cardiff City.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> He missed the season&#39;s opening fixtures due to a lack of fitness,<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> making his debut in a <a href="/wiki/League_Cup" id="w">League Cup</a> tie on <a href="/wiki/28_August" id="w">28 August</a>.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> He scored his first two Cardiff goals on <a href="/wiki/22_September" id="w">22 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> against <a href="/wiki/Preston_North_End_F.C." id="w">Preston North End</a>, scoring with two headers.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> and he then scored twice in his next game, a third round <a href="/wiki/Carling_Cup" id="w">Carling Cup</a> tie against <a href="/wiki/West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C." id="w">West Brom</a>, which Cardiff won 4&#8211;2<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> and were then drawn against Fowler&#39;s former Club Liverpool, at <a href="/wiki/Anfield" id="w">Anfield</a>, for the fourth round of the competition but were knocked out in a 2&#8211;1 defeat on <a href="/wiki/31_October" id="w">31 October</a>.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p>In November Fowler travelled to <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt" id="w">Frankfurt</a>,<a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> to see Dr. <a href="/wiki/Hans-Wilhelm_M%C3%BCller-Wohlfarth" id="w">Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfarth</a>, a specialist sports injuries doctor, to try and resolve a recurring hip problem that had left him lacking fitness in early season fixtures for the Bluebirds.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> The treatment involved taking around twenty-eight injections into his hip. He returned to full training in late November<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> and made his comeback on <a href="/wiki/15_December" id="w">15 December</a> as a late substitute in a 2&#8211;1 defeat against <a href="/wiki/Bristol_City_F.C." id="w">Bristol City</a>. However he went on to suffer another injury blow just days later after a mistimed tackle in training from club captain <a href="/wiki/Darren_Purse" id="w">Darren Purse</a><sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> saw him damage ankle ligaments.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> Due to the new injury blow Cardiff and Fowler have agreed that he will travel to <a href="/wiki/Colarado" id="w">Colarado</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" id="w">U.S.A.</a> to undergo keyhole surgery on the hip problem which has plagued him in recent years in the hope that it will finally resolve the problem.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Outside_football" name="Outside_football"></a><h2>Outside football</h2>
<p>In association with Steve McManaman, Fowler has invested in several racehorses through a company named <i>The Macca and Growler Partnership</i>, most notably 2003 Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Celebration Chase
winner <a href="/wiki/Seebald" id="w">Seebald</a>.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> In 2005, Fowler was listed as one of the 1,000 wealthiest Britons by the <i><a href="/wiki/Sunday_Times_Rich_List" id="w">Sunday Times Rich List</a></i>. Business interests including a large property portfolio have resulted in Fowler becoming the third wealthiest footballer,<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> in Britain, and leading to the affectionate, Manchester City chant <i>We all live in a Robbie Fowler house</i>, sung to the tune of <a href="/wiki/Yellow_Submarine_(song)" id="w">Yellow Submarine</a>.<sup id="_ref-Observer_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Observer" title="">[26]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/2_September" id="w">2 September</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> he released &#39;Fowler: My Autobiography&#39;, about his time as a footballer and the issues surrounding him. Since his transfer to Liverpool he has updated it and included a section about his return to <a href="/wiki/Anfield" id="w">Anfield</a>. Excerpts published in newspapers included criticism of the England management. </p>
