<b>Subtitles</b> are textual versions of the dialog in films and television programs, usually displayed at the bottom of the screen. They can either be a form of written translation of a dialog in a foreign language, or a written rendering of the dialog in the same language—with or without added information intended to help viewers who are deaf and hard-of-hearing to follow the dialog.  Sometimes, mainly at film festivals, subtitles may be shown on a separate display below the screen, thus saving the film-maker from creating a subtitled copy for perhaps just one showing. In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, television subtitling for the deaf and hard-of-hearing is <a href="/wiki/Closed_captioning" id="w">closed captioning</a>.</p>
<a id="Creation_of_subtitles" name="Creation_of_subtitles"></a><h1>Creation of subtitles</h1>
<p>Today professional subtitlers usually work with specialized computer software and hardware where the video is digitally stored on a hard disk, making each individual frame instantly accessible. Besides creating the subtitles, the subtitler usually also tells the computer software the exact positions where each subtitle should appear and disappear. For cinema film, this task is traditionally done by separate technicians. The end result is a subtitle file containing the actual subtitles as well as position markers indicating where each subtitle should appear and disappear. These markers are usually based on <a href="/wiki/SMPTE_time_code" id="w">timecode</a> if it is a work for electronic media (e.g. TV, video, DVD), or on film length (measured in feet and frames) if the subtitles are to be used for traditional cinema film.</p>
<p>The finished subtitle file is used to add the subtitles to the picture, either directly into the picture (open subtitles); embedded in the <a href="/wiki/Vertical_interval" id="w">vertical interval</a> and later superimposed on the picture by the end user with the help of an external decoder or a decoder built into the TV (closed subtitles on TV or video); or converted to <a href="/wiki/Tiff" id="w">tiff</a> or <a href="/wiki/BMP_file_format" id="w">bmp</a> graphics that are later superimposed on the picture by the end user (closed subtitles on DVD).</p>
<p>Subtitles can also be created by individuals using freely-available subtitle-creation software like <a href="/wiki/Aegisub" id="w">Aegisub</a> and then hardcode them onto a video file with programs such as <a href="/wiki/VirtualDub" id="w">VirtualDub</a> in combination with <a href="/wiki/VSFilter" id="w">VSFilter</a> which could also be used to show subtitles as softsubs in many <a href="/wiki/Video_player_(software)" id="w">software video players</a>.</p>
<a id="Same_language_captions" name="Same_language_captions"></a><h1>Same language captions</h1>
<p>Same language captions, i.e., without translation, are primarily intended as an aid for people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Subtitles in the same language as the dialog are sometimes edited for reading speed and readability. This is especially true if they cover a situation where many people are speaking at the same time, or where speech is unstructured or contains redundancy.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Closed_captioning" id="w">Closed captioning</a> is the American term for closed subtitles specifically intended for people who are <a href="/wiki/Deaf" id="w">deaf</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hard-of-hearing" id="w">hard-of-hearing</a>. These are a transcription rather than a translation, and usually contain descriptions of important non-dialog audio as well such as &#34;(sighs)&#34; or &#34;(door creaks)&#34;. From the expression &#34;closed captions&#34; the word &#34;caption&#34; has in recent years come to mean a subtitle intended for the hard of hearing, be it &#34;open&#34; or &#34;closed&#34;. In British English &#34;subtitles&#34; usually refers to subtitles for the hard-of-hearing (HoH), as translation subtitles are so rare on British cinema and TV; however, the term &#34;HoH subtitles&#34; is sometimes used when there is a need to make a distinction between the two.</p>
<a id="Realtime" name="Realtime"></a><h4>Realtime</h4>
<p>Programs such as news bulletins, current affairs programs, sport, some talk shows and political and special events utilize realtime or online captioning.<sup id="_ref-dcita_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup> Live captioning is increasingly common, especially in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, as a result of regulations that stipulate that virtually all TV eventually must be accessible for people who are deaf and hard–of–hearing.</p>
<a id="Pre-prepared" name="Pre-prepared"></a><h5>Pre-prepared</h5>
<p>Some programs may be prepared in their entirety several hours before broadcast, but with insufficient time to prepare a timecoded caption file for automatic play-out. Pre-prepared captions look very similar to offline captions, although the accuracy of cueing may be compromised slightly as the captions are not locked to program timecode.<sup id="_ref-dcita_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Newsroom captioning involves the automatic transfer of text from the newsroom computer system to a device which outputs it as captions. It does work, but its suitability as an exclusive system would only apply to programs which had been scripted in their entirety on the newsroom computer system, such as short interstitial updates.<sup id="_ref-dcita_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the United States and Canada, some broadcasters have used it exclusively and simply left uncaptioned sections of the bulletin for which a script was unavailable.<sup id="_ref-dcita_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup> Newsroom captioning limits captions to pre-scripted materials and, therefore, covers does not cover 100% of the news, weather and sports segments of a typical local news broadcast. It does not cover such things as the weather and sports segments which are typically not pre-scripted, last second breaking news or changes to the scripts, ad lib conversations of the broadcasters, emergency or other live remote broadcasts by reporters in-the-field. By failing to cover items such as these, newsroom style captioning (or use of the <a href="/wiki/Teleprompter" id="w">TelePrompTer</a> for captioning) typically results in coverage of less than 30% of a local news broadcast.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Communication Access Real-Time Translation (CART) <a href="/wiki/Stenographer" id="w">stenographers</a>, who use a computer with using either <a href="/wiki/Stenotype" id="w">stenotype</a> or <a href="/wiki/Velotype" id="w">Velotype</a> keyboards to transcribe stenographic input for presentation as captions within 2-3 seconds of the representing audio, must caption anything which is purely live and unscripted,<sup id="_ref-dcita_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup> however, the most recent developments include operators using <a href="/wiki/Voice_recognition" id="w">voice recognition</a> software and revoicing the dialog. Voice recognition technology has advanced so quickly in the United Kingdom that about 50% of all live captioning is through voice recognition as of 2005.{{Fact}} Realtime captions look different to offline captions, as they are presented as a continuous flow of text as people speak.<sup id="_ref-dcita_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Realtime stenographers are the most highly skilled in their profession. Stenography is a system of rendering words phonetically, and English, with its multitude of homophones (e.g. there, their, they’re), is particularly unsuited to easy transcriptions. Stenographers working in courts and inquiries usually have 24 hours in which to deliver their transcripts. Consequently they may enter the same phonetic stenographic codes for a variety of homophones, and fix up the spelling later. Realtime stenographers must deliver their transcriptions accurately and immediately. They must therefore develop techniques for keying homophones differently, and be unswayed by the pressures of delivering accurate product on immediate demand.<sup id="_ref-dcita_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Submissions to recent captioning-related inquiries have revealed concerns from broadcasters about captioning sports. In much sport captioning&#39;s absence, the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.auscap.com.au/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.auscap.com.au/">Australian Caption Centre</a> submitted to the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.hreoc.gov.au/disability_rights/inquiries/capmovie/nwpc.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.hreoc.gov.au/disability_rights/inquiries/capmovie/nwpc.htm">National Working Party on Captioning</a> (NWPC), in November of <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a>, three examples of sport captioning, each performed on tennis, rugby league and swimming programs:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Heavily reduced: Captioners ignore commentary and provide only scores and essential information such as “try” or “out”.</li>
<li>Significantly reduced: Captioners use <a href="/wiki/QWERTY" id="w">QWERTY</a> input to type summary captions yielding the essence of what the commentators are saying, delayed due to the limitations of QWERTY input.</li>
<li>Comprehensive realtime: Captioners use stenography to caption the commentary in its entirety.<sup id="_ref-dcita_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup></li></ol>
<p>The NWPC concluded that the standard they accept is the comprehensive realtime method, which gives them access to the commentary in its entirety. Also, not all sports are live.  Many events are pre-recorded hours before they are broadcast, allowing them a captioner to caption them using offline methods.<sup id="_ref-dcita_i" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Hybrid" name="Hybrid"></a><h5>Hybrid</h5>
<p>Because different programs are produced under different conditions, a case-by-case basis must consequently determine captioning methodology. Some bulletins may have a high incidence of truly live material, or insufficient access to video feeds and scripts may be provided to the captioning facility, making stenography unavoidable. Other bulletins may be pre-recorded just before going to air, making pre-prepared text preferable.<sup id="_ref-dcita_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In Australia and the United Kingdom, hybrid methodologies have proven to be the best way to provide comprehensive, accurate and cost-effective captions on news and current affairs programs. News captioning applications currently available are designed to accept text from a variety of inputs: stenography, Velotype, QWERTY, <a href="/wiki/American_Standard_Code_for_Information_Interchange" id="w">ASCII</a> import, and the newsroom computer. This allows one facility to handle a variety of online captioning requirements and to ensure that captioners properly caption all programs.<sup id="_ref-dcita_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Current affairs programs usually require stenographic assistance. Even though the segments which comprise a current affairs program may be produced in advance, they are usually done so just before on-air time and their duration makes QWERTY input of text unfeasible.<sup id="_ref-dcita_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>News bulletins, on the other hand can often be captioned without stenographic input (unless there are live crosses or ad-libbing by the presenters).  This is because:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Most items are scripted on the newsroom computer system and this text can be electronically imported into the captioning system.</li>
<li>Individual news stories are of short duration, so even if they are made available only just prior to broadcast, there is still time to QWERTY in text.<sup id="_ref-dcita_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dcita" title="">[2]</a></sup></li></ol>

For non-live, or pre-recorded programs, television program providers can choose offline captioning.

<a id="SDH" name="SDH"></a><h2>SDH</h2>
<p>&#34;SDH&#34; is an American term the DVD industry introduced. It is an <a href="/wiki/Acronym" id="w">acronym</a> for &#34;<b>S</b>ubtitles for the <b>d</b>eaf and <b>h</b>ard-of-hearing&#34;, and refers to regular subtitles in the original language where important non-dialog audio has been added, as well as speaker identification, useful when the viewer cannot otherwise visually tell who is saying what.</p>
<p>The only significant difference for the user between &#34;SDH&#34; subtitles and &#34;closed captions&#34; is their appearance: SDH subtitles usually are displayed with the same proportional font used for the translation subtitles on the DVD; however, closed captions are displayed as white text on a black band, which blocks a large portion of the view. Closed captioning is falling out of favor as many users have no difficulty reading SDH subtitles, which are text with contrast outline. In addition, DVD subtitles can specify many colors, on the same character: primary, outline, shadow, and background. This allows subtitlers to display subtitles on a usually translucent band for easier reading, however, this is rare, since most subtitles use an outline and shadow instead, in order to block a smaller portion of the picture. Closed captions may still supersede DVD subtitles, since many SDH subtitles present all of the text centered, while closed captions usually specify position on the screen: centered, left align, right align, top, etc. This is very helpful for speaker identification and overlapping conversation. Some SDH subtitles do have positioning, but it is not as common.</p>
<p>DVDs for the US market now sometimes have three forms of English subtitles: SDH subtitles, English subtitles, helpful for viewers who are Hearing and whose first language may not be English (although they are usually an exact transcript and not edited into <a href="/wiki/Basic_English" id="w">Simple English</a>), and closed caption data that is decoded by the end-user’s closed caption decoder.</p>
<p>High definition disc media (<a href="/wiki/HD_DVD" id="w">HD DVD</a>, <a href="/wiki/Blu-ray_disc" id="w">Blu-ray disc</a>) uses SDH subtitles as the sole method because technical specifications do not require HD to support line 21 closed captions. Some blu-ray discs, however, are said to carry a closed caption stream that only displays through standard definition connections. Many <a href="/wiki/High-definition_television" id="w">HDTVs</a> allow the end–user to customize the captions, including the ability to remove the black band.</p>
<a id="Use_by_those_not_deaf_or_hard-of-hearing" name="Use_by_those_not_deaf_or_hard-of-hearing"></a><h2>Use by those not deaf or hard-of-hearing</h2>
<p>Although same-language subtitles and captions are produced primarily with the deaf and hard-of-hearing in mind, many hearing film and television viewers choose to use them. This is often done, because the presence of closed captioning and subtitles ensures that not one word of dialog will be missed. Films and television shows often have subtitles displayed in the same language, if the speaker has a speech disability and/or an accent. In addition, captions may further reveal information that would be difficult to pick up on otherwise. Some examples of this would be the song lyrics; dialog spoken quietly or by those with unfamiliar accents; or supportive, minor dialog from background characters. It is argued that such additional information and detail will enhance the overall experience and allow the viewer a better grasp on the material. Furthermore, people learning a foreign language may sometimes use same-language subtitles to better understand the dialog while not having to resort to a translation.</p>
<a id="Asia" name="Asia"></a><h4>Asia</h4>
<p>In some Asian television programming, captioning is considered a part of the genre, and has evolved beyond simply capturing what is being said. The captions are used artistically; it is common to see the words appear one by one as they are spoken, in a multitude of fonts, colors, and sizes that capture the spirit of what is being said. Languages like Japanese also have a rich vocabulary of <a href="/wiki/Japanese_sound_symbolism" id="w">onomatopoeia</a> which are used in captioning.</p>
<a id="East_Asia" name="East_Asia"></a><h5>East Asia</h5>
<p>In some East Asian countries, such as China and Japan, captioning is common in some genres of television. In these languages, written text is less ambiguous than spoken text, so there is a distinct advantage to captioning. Furthermore, the various spoken dialects of Chinese are mutually incomprehensible, but are all written identically; captioning means someone who only understands Mandarin could watch a show filmed in Cantonese. Captioning is also common in taped interviews during news broadcasts, as accents in Asian languages can be difficult to understand.</p>

Subtitles can be used to translate dialog from a foreign language to the native language of the audience.  It is the quickest and the cheapest method of translating content, and is usually praised for the possibility to hear the original dialog and voices of the actors.</p>
<p>Translation of subtitling is sometimes very different from the translation of written text. Usually, when a film or a TV program is subtitled, the subtitler watches the picture and listens to the audio sentence by sentence. The subtitler may or may not have access to a written transcript of the dialog.  Especially in commercial subtitles, the subtitler often interprets what is meant, rather than translating how it is said, i.e. meaning being more important than form.  The audience does not always appreciate this, and it can be frustrating to those who know some of the spoken language, due to the fact that spoken language may contain verbal padding or culturally implied meanings, in confusing words, if not adapted in the written subtitles. The subtitler does this when the dialog must be condensed in order to achieve an acceptable reading speed. i.e. purpose being more important than form.</p>
<p>Especially in <a href="/wiki/Fansub" id="w">fansubs</a>, the subtitler may translate both form and meaning. The subtitler may also choose to display a note in the subtitles, usually in <a href="/wiki/Bracket#Parentheses ( )" id="w">parentheses</a> (“<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/(">(</a>” and “<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/)">)</a>”). This allows the subtitler to preserve form and achieve an acceptable reading speed, by leaving the note on the screen, even after the character has finished speaking, to both preserve form and allow for understanding. For example, the Japanese language has multiple first-person pronouns (see <a href="/wiki/Japanese_pronouns" id="w">Japanese pronouns</a>), and using one instead of another implies a different degree of politeness. In order to compensate, when translating to English, the subtitler may reformulate the sentence, add appropriate words and/or use notes.</p>

</p><a id="Realtime" name="Realtime"></a><h4>Realtime</h4>
<p>Realtime translation subtitling, usually involving simultaneous interpreter listening to the dialog quickly translating, while a stenographer types, is rare. The unavoidable delay, typing errors, lack of editing, and high costs regard very little need for translation subtitling. Allowing the interpreter to directly speak to the viewers is usually both cheaper and quicker, however, the translation is not accessible to people who are deaf and hard–of–hearing.</p>
<a id="Offline" name="Offline"></a><h4>Offline</h4>
<p>Some subtitlers purposely provide edited subtitles or captions, to match the needs of their audience, for learners of the spoken dialog as a second or foreign language, visual learners, beginning readers who are deaf or hard-of-hearing and for people with learning and/or mental disabilities. For example, for many of its films and television programs, <a href="/wiki/PBS" id="w">PBS</a> displays  standard captions representing speech the program audio, word-for-word, if the viewer selects &#34;CC1&#34;, by using the television remote control or on-screen menu, however, they also provide edited captions to present simplified sentences at a slower rate, if the viewer selects &#34;CC2&#34;. Programs with a very diverse audience also often have captions in another language. This is common with popular Spanish <a href="/wiki/Soap_opera" id="w">soap operas</a>. Since CC1 and CC2 share <a href="/wiki/Bandwidth" id="w">bandwidth</a>, the <a href="/wiki/FCC" id="w">FCC</a> recommends translation subtitles be placed in CC3. CC4, which shares bandwidth with CC3, is also available, but programs very seldom use it.</p>
<a id="Subtitles_vs._dubbing_and_lectoring" name="Subtitles_vs._dubbing_and_lectoring"></a><h2>Subtitles vs. dubbing and lectoring</h2>
<p>The two alternative methods of &#39;translating&#39; films in a foreign language are <a href="/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)" id="w">dubbing</a>, in which other actors record over the voices of the original actors in a different language, and <a href="/wiki/Lectoring" id="w">lectoring</a>, a form of <a href="/wiki/Voice-over" id="w">voice-over</a> for fiction material where a narrator tells the audience what the actors are saying while their voices can be heard in the background. Lectoring is common for television in Russia, Poland, and a few other East European countries, while cinemas in these countries commonly show films dubbed or subtitled.</p>
<p>The preference for dubbing or subtitling in various countries is largely based on decisions taken in the late 1920s and early 1930s. With the arrival of sound film, the film importers in Germany, Italy, France and Spain decided to dub the foreign voices, while the rest of Europe elected to display the dialog as translated subtitles. The choice was largely due to financial reasons (subtitling is inexpensive and quick, while dubbing is very expensive and thus requires a very large audience to justify the cost), but during the 1930s it also became a political preference in Germany, Italy and Spain; an expedient form of <a href="/wiki/Censorship" id="w">censorship</a> that ensured that foreign views and ideas could be stopped from reaching the local audience, as dubbing makes it possible to create a dialogue which is totally different from the original. In Spain the compulsory dubbing was also employed for encouraging the use of Spanish language (Castilian) among non-Spanish-speaking population (languages such as Galician, Catalonian and Basque were forbidden and prosecuted during Franco&#39;s dictatorship).</p>
<p>Dubbing is still the norm and favored form in these four countries, but the proportion of subtitling is slowly growing, mainly to save cost and turnaround-time, but also due to a growing acceptance among younger generations, who are better readers and increasingly have a basic knowledge of English (the dominant language in film and TV) and thus prefer to hear the original dialogue.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in Spain, for example, only public TV channels show subtitled foreign films, usually at late night. It is extremely rare that any Spanish TV channel shows subtitled versions of TV programs, series or documentaries. In addition, only a small proportion of cinemas shows subtitled films. Films talking in Galician, Catalonian or Basque are always dubbed, not subtitled, when they are showed in the rest of the country. Some non-Spanish-speaking TV stations subtitle interviews in Spanish; others do not.</p>
<p>In many Latin American countries, local network television will show dubbed versions of English-language programs and movies, while cable stations (often international) more commonly broadcast subtitled material. Preference for subtitles or dubbing varies according to individual taste and reading ability, and theaters may order two prints of the most popular films, allowing moviegoers to chose between dubbing or subtitles. Animation and children&#39;s programming, however, is nearly universally dubbed, as in other regions.</p>
<p>In the traditional subtitling countries, dubbing is generally regarded as something very strange and unnatural and is only used for animated films and TV programs intended for pre-school children. As animated films are &#34;dubbed&#34; even in their original language and ambient noise and effects are usually recorded on a separate sound track, dubbing a low quality production into a second language produces little or no noticeable effect on the viewing experience. In dubbed live-action television or film, however, viewers are often distracted by the fact that the audio does not match the actors&#39; lip movements.  Furthermore, the dubbed voices may seem detached, inappropriate for the character, or overly expressive, and some ambient sounds may not be transferred to the dubbed track, creating a less enjoyable viewing experience.</p>

<p>It is also common that television services in minority languages subtitle their programmes in the dominating language as well. Examples include the <a href="/wiki/Welsh_language" id="w">Welsh</a> <a href="/wiki/S4C" id="w">S4C</a> and <a href="/wiki/Irish_language" id="w">Irish</a> <a href="/wiki/TG4" id="w">TG4</a> who subtitle in <a href="/wiki/English_language" id="w">English</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Swedish_language" id="w">Swedish</a> <a href="/wiki/FST5" id="w">FST5</a> who subtitle in <a href="/wiki/Finnish_language" id="w">Finnish</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Wallonia" id="w">Wallonia</a> (Belgium) films are usually dubbed, but sometimes they are played on two channels at the same time: one dubbed (on La Une) and the other subtitled (on La Deux), but due to low ratings not much anymore.</p>
<p>In Australia, one <a href="/wiki/Free-to-air" id="w">FTA</a> network, <a href="/wiki/Special_Broadcasting_Service" id="w">SBS</a> airs its foreign-language shows subtitled in English.</p>
<a id="Categories" name="Categories"></a><h1>Categories</h1>
<p>Subtitles in the same language on the same production can be in different categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Narrative</b> This is the most common type of subtitle.  <i>Narrative subtitles</i> are those in which all the foreign language dialog and on-screen text is translated to the local tongue.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Forced</b> These are common on <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVDs</a>. <i>Forced subtitles</i> only provide subtitles when the characters speak a foreign or <a href="/wiki/Alien_language" id="w">alien language</a>.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Titles only</b> Dubbed programs use this sort of subtitle. <i>Titles only</i> provide only the text for any untranslated on-screen text.</li></ul>
<a id="Types" name="Types"></a><h1>Types</h1>
<p>While distributing content, subtitles can appear in one of 3 types:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Hard</b> (also known as <b>hardsubs</b> or <b>open</b> subtitles). The subtitle text is irreversibly merged in original video frames, thus this format of subtitles doesn&#39;t require any special equipment or software at all. Thus, very complex transition effects and animation can be implemented, such as <a href="/wiki/Karaoke" id="w">karaoke</a> song lyrics using various colors, fonts, sizes, animation (like a bouncing ball) etc. to follow the lyrics. However, these subtitles can&#39;t be turned off unless the original video is also included in the distribution, because they are just a part of the original frame, and it&#39;s impossible to do several variants of subtitling, such as in multiple languages.</li>
<li><b>Prerendered</b> subtitles are separate video frames that are overlaid on the original video stream while playing. Prerendered subtitles are used on <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVD</a> (though they are contained in the same file as the video stream). It is possible to turn them off or have multiple language subtitles and switch among them. Obviously, the player is required to support such subtitles to display them. On the other hand, subtitles are usually encoded as images with minimal bitrate and number of colors, thus they usually lack <a href="/wiki/Anti-aliasing" id="w">anti-aliased</a> <a href="/wiki/Font_rasterization" id="w">font rasterization</a>. Also, it is hard to change such subtitles, but special <a href="/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" id="w">OCR</a> software, such as <a href="/wiki/SubRip" id="w">SubRip</a> exists to convert such subtitles to &#34;soft&#34; ones.</li>
<li><b>Soft</b> (also known as <b>softsubs</b> or <b>closed</b> subtitles) are separate instructions, usually a specially marked up text with time stamps to be displayed during playback. It requires player support and, moreover, there are multiple incompatible (but usually reciprocally convertible) subtitle file formats. It&#39;s relatively easy to create and change such subtitles, and thus it&#39;s frequently used for <a href="/wiki/Fansub" id="w">fansubs</a>. Text rendering quality can vary depending on the player, but generally, it&#39;s higher than prerendered subtitles. Also, some formats introduce <a href="/wiki/Text_encoding" id="w">text encoding</a> troubles for end-user, especially if very different languages are used simultaneously (for example, Latin and Asian scripts).</li></ul>
<p>In other categorization, digital video subtitles are sometimes called <b>internal</b>, if they&#39;re embedded in a single video file container along with video and audio streams, and <b>external</b> if they are distributed as separate file (that is less convenient, but it is easier to edit/change such file).

<p>Occasionally, movies will use subtitles as a source of humor.</p>

<ul>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Annie_Hall" id="w">Annie Hall</a></i> the characters of <a href="/wiki/Woody_Allen" id="w">Woody Allen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Diane_Keaton" id="w">Diane Keaton</a> are having a conversation; their real thoughts are shown in subtitles.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Austin_Powers_in_Goldmember" id="w">Austin Powers in Goldmember</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" id="w">Japanese</a> dialog is subtitled using white type that blends in with white objects in the background. An example is when white binders turn the subtitle &#34;Please eat some shitake [sic] mushrooms&#34; into &#34;Please eat some shit.&#34; After many cases of this, Mr. Roboto says &#34;Why don&#39;t I just speak English?&#34;, in English.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Impostors" id="w">The Impostors</a></i> one character speaks in a foreign language, while another character hides under the bed. Although the hidden character cannot understand what is being spoken, he can read the subtitles. Since the subtitles are overlaid on the film, they appear to be reversed from his point of view. His attempt to puzzle out these subtitles enhances the humor of the scene.</li>
<li>The movie <i><a href="/wiki/Airplane!" id="w">Airplane!</a></i> and its sequel feature two inner-city <a href="/wiki/African_Americans" id="w">African Americans</a> speaking in barely comprehensible <a href="/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English" id="w">jive</a>, with English subtitles.  However, the movie viewer can sense that the subtitles do not match the context of the speech; when they talk in sexually explicit slang, inaccurate sanitized text appears below. Read the conversation here <a class="externallink" href="http://larry.teamoverkill.com/jive/" rel="nofollow" title="http://larry.teamoverkill.com/jive/">http://larry.teamoverkill.com/jive/</a></li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Carl_Reiner" id="w">Carl Reiner</a> comedy  <i><a href="/wiki/The_Man_with_Two_Brains" id="w">The Man with Two Brains</a></i> also features comedic use of subtitles. After stopping Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr (<a href="/wiki/Steve_Martin" id="w">Steve Martin</a>) for speeding, a German police officer realizes that Hfuhruhurr can speak English. He asks his colleague in their squad car to turn off the subtitles, and indicates toward the bottom of the screen, commenting that &#34;This is better - we have more room down there now&#34;.</li>
<li>In the opening credits of <i><a href="/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail" id="w">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></i> the Swedish subtitler switches to English and promotes his country, until the introduction is cut off and the subtitler &#34;sacked&#34;.  In the <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVD</a> version of the same film, the viewer could choose, instead of hearing aid and local languages, lines from <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" id="w">Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Henry_IV%2C_part_5" id="w">Henry IV, part 5</a></i> that vaguely resemble the lines that are actually being spoken in film, if they are &#34;<i>people who hate the film</i>&#34;.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Scary_Movie_4" id="w">Scary Movie 4</a></i>, there is a scene where the actors speak in faux <a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" id="w">Japanese</a> (nonsensical words which mostly consist of Japanese company names), but the content of the subtitles is the &#34;real&#34; conversation.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Not_Another_Teen_Movie" id="w">Not Another Teen Movie</a></i> the nude <a href="/wiki/Foreign_exchange_student" id="w">foreign exchange student</a> character Areola speaks lightly accented English, but her dialog is subtitled anyway. Also, the text is spaced in such a way that a view of her bare breasts is unhindered.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Simon_Ellis" id="w">Simon Ellis</a>&#39; <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a> short film <i>Telling Lies</i> juxtaposes a soundtrack of a man telling lies on the telephone against subtitles which expose the truth. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/A7079510" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/A7079510">http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/A7079510</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Animutation" id="w">Animutations</a> commonly use subtitles to present the comical <a href="/wiki/Mondegreen" id="w">&#34;fake lyrics&#34;</a> (English words that sound close to what is actually being sung in the song in the non-English language). These fake lyrics are a major staple of the Animutation genre.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Lock%2C_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels" id="w">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</a></i> contains a scene spoken entirely in <a href="/wiki/Cockney_rhyming_slang" id="w">cockney rhyming slang</a> that is subtitled in standard English.</li>
<li>In an episode of <i><a href="/wiki/Angry_Beavers" id="w">Angry Beavers</a></i>, at one point Norbert begins to speak with such a heavy European accent that his words are subtitled on the bottom of the screen. Daggett actually touches the subtitles, shoving them out of the way.</li>
<li>The film <i><a href="/wiki/Crank" id="w">Crank</a></i> contains a scene where <a href="/wiki/Jason_Statham" id="w">Jason Statham</a>&#39;s character understands an Asian character&#39;s line of dialogue from reading the on-screen subtitle. The subtitle is even in reverse when his character reads the line.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Fatal_Instinct" id="w">Fatal Instinct</a></i>, also directed by <a href="/wiki/Carl_Reiner" id="w">Carl Reiner</a>, one scene involving two characters talking about their murder plan in Yiddish to prevent anyone from knowing about it, only to be foiled by a man on the bench reading the on-screen subtitles.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Ken_Loach" id="w">Ken Loach</a> released the film <a href="/wiki/Riff-Raff" id="w">Riff-Raff</a> into American theatres with subtitles not only so people could understand the thick Scottish accents, but also to make fun of how most Americans needed the subtitles just to understand the dialogue (this is mentioned in the theatrical trailer). Loach has continued this process with some of his other films.</li>
<li>In one of <a href="/wiki/Mad_TV" id="w">Mad TV</a>&#39;s episode which features <a href="/wiki/Bobby_Lee" id="w">Bobby Lee</a> in a &#34;Korean Drama&#34; <a href="/wiki/Parody" id="w">parody</a>, the subtitles seems to be intentionally made longer than what they actually say in the drama, id est, the actor said only one syllable of Korean language, but the subtitles were so long that it covered the whole screen.</li></ul>
<p>One unintentional source of humor in subtitles comes from illegal DVDs produced in non-English-speaking countries (esp. China).  These DVDs often contain poorly-worded subtitle tracks, possibly produced by <a href="/wiki/Machine_translation" id="w">machine translation</a>, with humorous results.  One of the better-known examples is a copy of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_III:_Revenge_of_the_Sith" id="w">Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</a></i> whose opening title was subtitled, &#34;Star war: The backstroke of the west&#34;. <a class="externallink" href="http://antibody.za.net/backstrokeofwest/" rel="nofollow" title="http://antibody.za.net/backstrokeofwest/">http://antibody.za.net/backstrokeofwest/</a></p>
<a id="Controversy" name="Controversy"></a><h1>Controversy</h1>
<p>One recent controversy about the necessity of subtitles involved the <a href="/wiki/Mel_Gibson" id="w">Mel Gibson</a> movie <i><a href="/wiki/The_Passion_of_the_Christ" id="w">The Passion of the Christ</a></i>. All the dialog in this film was in <a href="/wiki/Aramaic" id="w">Aramaic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latin" id="w">Latin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language" id="w">Hebrew</a>. Gibson initially intended not to include subtitles in the belief that the audience already knew the story, but the distributors ordered him to include them by arguing that audiences would refuse to watch a film whose dialog was entirely untranslated.{{Fact}}</p>
<p>Another controversy arising out of bad subtitling was of <a href="/wiki/Bollywood" id="w">Bollywood</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/Lagaan" id="w">Lagaan</a></i>. There was a reference to the Hindu God <a href="/wiki/Hanuman" id="w">Hanuman</a> as Monkey in one of the foreign release prints in English. This resulted in widespread protests, leading distributors to change the subtitling and issue an apology.{{Fact}}</p>
