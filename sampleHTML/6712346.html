<p>The <b>history of Lithuania between 1219 and 1295</b> deals with the establishment and early history of the first Lithuanian state, the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania" id="w">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>. The beginning of the 13th century marks the end of the <a href="/wiki/Prehistory" id="w">prehistory</a> of Lithuania. From this point on the <a href="/wiki/History_of_Lithuania" id="w">history of Lithuania</a> is recorded in chronicles, treaties, and other written documents. In 1219, <a href="/wiki/List_of_early_Lithuanian_dukes" id="w">twenty-one Lithuanian dukes</a> signed a peace treaty with <a href="/wiki/Halych-Volhynia" id="w">Halych-Volhynia</a>. This event is widely accepted as the first proof that the <a href="/wiki/Balts" id="w">Baltic tribes</a> were uniting and consolidating.<sup id="_ref-gerutis_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gerutis" title="">[1]</a></sup> Despite continuous warfare with two Christian orders, the <a href="/wiki/Livonian_Order" id="w">Livonian Order</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Teutonic_Knights" id="w">Teutonic Knights</a>, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was established and gained some control over the lands of <a href="/wiki/Black_Ruthenia" id="w">Black Ruthenia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Polatsk" id="w">Polatsk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minsk" id="w">Minsk</a>, and other territories east of modern-day Lithuania that had become weak and vulnerable after the collapse of <a href="/wiki/Kievan_Rus%26%2339%3B" id="w">Kievan Rus&#39;</a>.</p>
<p>The first ruler to hold the title of <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duke" id="w">Grand Duke</a> was <a href="/wiki/Mindaugas" id="w">Mindaugas</a>. Traditionally he is considered the founder of the state, the one who united the Baltic tribes and established the Duchy. Some scholars, however, challenge this perception, arguing that an organized state existed before Mindaugas,<sup id="_ref-EL_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EL" title="">[2]</a></sup> possibly as early as 1183.<sup id="_ref-voruta_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-voruta" title="">[3]</a></sup> After quelling an internal war with his nephews, Mindaugas was baptized in 1251, and was crowned as <a href="/wiki/King_of_Lithuania" id="w">King of Lithuania</a> in 1253. However, in 1261, he broke the peace with the Livonian Order, perhaps even renouncing Christianity. His assassination in 1263 by <a href="/wiki/Treniota" id="w">Treniota</a> ended the early Christian kingdom in Lithuania. For another 120 years Lithuania would remain a pagan empire, fighting against the Teutonic and Livonian Orders during the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Crusades" id="w">Northern Crusades</a> to Christianize the land.<sup id="_ref-empire_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-empire" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>After Mindaugas&#39; death, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania entered times of relative instability, as reflected by the fact that <a href="/wiki/List_of_Lithuanian_rulers" id="w">seven Grand Dukes</a> held the title over the course of the next thirty-two years. Little is known about this period, but the <a href="/wiki/Gediminids" id="w">Gediminid dynasty</a> was founded in about 1280. Despite the instability, the Grand Duchy did not disintegrate. <a href="/wiki/Vytenis" id="w">Vytenis</a> assumed power in 1295, and during the next twenty years laid solid foundations for the Duchy to expand and grow  under the leadership of <a href="/wiki/Gediminas" id="w">Gediminas</a> and his son <a href="/wiki/Algirdas" id="w">Algirdas</a>. While the Grand Duchy was established between 1219 and 1295, the years after 1295 marked its expansion.</p>

<p>The Balts were largely driven to unite by external threats from aggressive German religious orders. In 1202, the Order of the <a href="/wiki/Livonian_Brothers_of_the_Sword" id="w">Livonian Brothers of the Sword</a> was established by Albert, the Bishop of <a href="/wiki/Riga" id="w">Riga</a>, to promote the Christianization and conquest of the <a href="/wiki/Livonian_people" id="w">Livonians</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latvians" id="w">Latvians</a>, <a href="/wiki/Estonians" id="w">Estonians</a>, and other pagan peoples located near the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Riga" id="w">Gulf of Riga</a>. It waged a number of successful campaigns and posed a great danger to the Lithuanian territories. The Order&#39;s progress was halted by its defeat at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Saule" id="w">Battle of Saule</a> in 1236, after which it almost collapsed.<sup id="_ref-kiaupa_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiaupa" title="">[5]</a></sup> Eventually, it united with the Teutonic Knights and continued its incursions, known as <i>Reisen</i>, against the Baltic tribes.</p>
<p>In 1226, <a href="/wiki/Konrad_I_of_Masovia" id="w">Konrad I of Masovia</a> invited the <a href="/wiki/Teutonic_Knights" id="w">Teutonic Knights</a> to defend his borders and subdue the <a href="/wiki/Old_Prussians" id="w">Prussians</a>, offering the Knights the use of <a href="/wiki/Che%C5%82mno_Land" id="w">Chełmno</a> as a base for their campaign. In 1230, they settled in Chełmno, built a castle, and began attacking Prussian lands. After forty-four years, and despite two Prussian uprisings against them, they had conquered most of the Prussian tribes. Afterwards, the Knights spent nine years conquering the <a href="/wiki/Nadruvians" id="w">Nadruvians</a>, <a href="/wiki/Skalvians" id="w">Skalvians</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Yotvingians" id="w">Yotvingians</a>, and from 1283, they were better positioned to threaten the young Lithuanian state from the west.<sup id="_ref-cd-812_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cd-812" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Further unification of the Lithuanian tribes was facilitated by the social changes that took place in Lithuania during this period. Private land ownership was established (<a href="/wiki/Allodium" id="w">allodiums</a>, Lithuanian: <i>atolai</i>), which would later evolve into a <a href="/wiki/Feudalism" id="w">feudal system</a>. As attested by many chronicles, it was the principal form of organization governing land ownership in the 13th century.<sup id="_ref-MGweb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MGweb" title="">[7]</a></sup> Under this system, known in England as <a href="/wiki/Primogeniture" id="w">primogeniture</a>, only the eldest son could inherit lands, which allowed dukes to consolidate their holdings. <a href="/wiki/Social_class" id="w">Social classes</a> and divisions of labor also began taking shape. There were castes of strong and experienced soldiers, owning land, people and stock, and a caste of &#34;unfree&#34; people (likely, prisoners of war).<sup id="_ref-MGweb_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MGweb" title="">[7]</a></sup> In order to enforce this social structure, a united state was needed. Another force behind unification was the desire to take advantage of Ruthenian lands, which were suffering from the <a href="/wiki/Mongols" id="w">Mongol</a> invasion. Temporary alliances among Lithuanian dukes often sufficed for military ventures into, and plundering of, these lands (including <a href="/wiki/Pskov" id="w">Pskov</a>, plundered in 1213). Altogether, between 1201 and 1236, Lithuanians launched at least 22 incursions into <a href="/wiki/Livonia" id="w">Livonia</a>, 14 into <a href="/wiki/Ruthenia" id="w">Rus</a>, and 4 into <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a>. The ongoing administration of conquered territories, however, required a strong and unified central power.<sup id="_ref-kiaupa_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiaupa" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Some evidence suggests that Lithuanians began combining their forces at the dawn of the 13th century. For example, in 1207, soldiers were recruited across Lithuania to fight the German <a href="/wiki/Religious_order" id="w">religious orders</a>, and in 1212, <a href="/wiki/Daugirutis" id="w">Daugirutis</a>&#39; treaty with <a href="/wiki/Novgorod" id="w">Novgorod</a> shows that he exerted some degree of influence over a vast area.<sup id="_ref-cd-821_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cd-821" title="">[8]</a></sup> During the first twenty years of the 13th century, Lithuanians organized some thirty military expeditions to Livonia, Russia, and Poland.<sup id="_ref-kiaupa_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiaupa" title="">[5]</a></sup> Historian <a href="/wiki/Tomas_Baranauskas" id="w">Tomas Baranauskas</a> argues that a <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Lithuania" id="w">Lithuanian state</a> could be said to exist as early as 1183.<sup id="_ref-voruta_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-voruta" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, the first conclusive evidence that the Balts were uniting is considered to be the treaty with <a href="/wiki/Halych-Volhynia" id="w">Halych-Volhynia</a> signed in 1219.<sup id="_ref-gerutis_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gerutis" title="">[1]</a></sup> The treaty&#39;s signatories include <a href="/wiki/List_of_early_Lithuanian_dukes" id="w">twenty-one Lithuanian dukes</a>; it specifies that five of those were elder and thus took precedence over the remaining sixteen. Presumably, the eldest Duke was <a href="/wiki/Živinbudas" id="w">Živinbudas</a>, since his name was mentioned first.<sup id="_ref-voruta_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-voruta" title="">[3]</a></sup> Mindaugas, despite his youth, and his brother <a href="/wiki/Dausprungas" id="w">Dausprungas</a>, are listed among the elder dukes. That would imply that they inherited their titles.<sup id="_ref-cd-821_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cd-821" title="">[8]</a></sup> The remaining two elder dukes were <a href="/wiki/Daujotas" id="w">Daujotas</a> (mentioned 2nd) and his bother <a href="/wiki/Vilikaila" id="w">Vilikaila</a> (mentioned last of the five).</p>
<p>The treaty is important for several reasons. It shows that the Lithuanian Dukes were co-operating; the signatories include Dukes who ruled lands such as <a href="/wiki/Samogitia" id="w">Samogitia</a>, which probably had no contact with Halych-Volhynia. Their participation implies a perception of common interest, an indication of a nascent state. However, the designation of five Dukes as &#34;elder&#34; shows that the process of unification was still in transition. The inclusion of twenty-one Dukes indicates that the various lands in Lithuania were powerful and semi-independent. Historians consider the treaty an interesting documentation of the long and complex process of a state&#39;s formation.<sup id="_ref-cd-821_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cd-821" title="">[8]</a></sup> The progress of unification was uneven; for example, after the deaths of Dukes <a href="/wiki/Daugirutis" id="w">Daugirutis</a> in 1213 and <a href="/wiki/Stek%C5%A1ys" id="w">Stekšys</a> in 1214, fewer raids were organized by Lithuanians.<sup id="_ref-kiaupa_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiaupa" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Mindaugas, the duke who governed southern Lithuania between the <a href="/wiki/Neman_River" id="w">Neman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neris" id="w">Neris</a> Rivers,<sup id="_ref-MGweb_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MGweb" title="">[7]</a></sup> eventually became the founder of the state. Mindaugas is referred to as the ruler of all Lithuania in the <a href="/wiki/Livonian_Rhymed_Chronicle" id="w">Livonian Rhymed Chronicle</a> in 1236.<sup id="_ref-LV-Mind_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LV-Mind" title="">[9]</a></sup> The means by which he managed to acquire this title are not well-known. Russian chronicles mention that he murdered or expelled various other dukes, including his relatives.<sup id="_ref-gerutis_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gerutis" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1236, Duke <a href="/wiki/Vykintas" id="w">Vykintas</a> led the Samogitian forces to victory in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Saule" id="w">Battle of Saule</a>, where the Livonian Order suffered a catastrophic defeat. It seems that Vykintas did not receive support from Mindaugas.<sup id="_ref-cd-822_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cd-822" title="">[10]</a></sup> Vykintas&#39; personal power grew. The Livonian Order was on the brink of collapse and was forced to become a branch of the Teutonic Knights. The combined Orders focused on the conquest of <a href="/wiki/Samogitia" id="w">Samogitia</a>, since only this land prevented them from consolidating their territories. The union of these aggressive powers could not have passed without notice in Lithuanian lands, and might have furthered the unification process.<sup id="_ref-kiaupa_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiaupa" title="">[5]</a></sup> In about 1239 Mindaugas took over the weakened <a href="/wiki/Black_Ruthenia" id="w">Black Ruthenia</a> and appointed his son Vaišvilkas to govern it.<sup id="_ref-LV-Mind_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LV-Mind" title="">[9]</a></sup> During the early 1240s, Mindaugas strengthened and established his power in various Baltic lands.<sup id="_ref-kiaupa_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiaupa" title="">[5]</a></sup> In 1245, Mindaugas sent his nephews <a href="/wiki/Tautvilas" id="w">Tautvilas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Edivydas" id="w">Edivydas</a>, the sons of Dausprungas and Vykintas, to conquer <a href="/wiki/Smolensk" id="w">Smolensk</a>, but they were unsuccessful.

Tautvilas, Edivydas, and Vykintas formed a powerful coalition with the Samogitians, the Livonian Order, <a href="/wiki/Daniel_of_Halych" id="w">Daniel of Halych</a> (Tautvilas and Edivydas&#39; brother-in-law), and Vasilko of <a href="/wiki/Volhynia" id="w">Volhynia</a> in opposition to Mindaugas. Only Poles, invited by Daniel, declined to take part in the coalition against the Lithuanians. The dukes of Halych and Volhynia managed to gain control over Black Ruthenia, an area ruled by Mindaugas&#39; son Vaišvilkas. Tautvilas traveled to Riga, where he was baptized by the Archbishop. In 1250, the Order organized two major raids, one against Nalša land and the other against the domains of Mindaugas and those parts of Samogitia that still supported him.<sup id="_ref-MGweb_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MGweb" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>

Attacked from the north and south and facing the possibility of unrest elsewhere, Mindaugas was placed in an extremely difficult position, but managed to use the conflicts between the Livonian Order and the <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Riga" id="w">Archbishop of Riga</a> in his own interests. He succeeded in bribing Andreas von Stierland,<sup id="_ref-MGweb_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MGweb" title="">[7]</a></sup> the master of the Order, who was still angry at Vykintas for the defeat in 1236.<sup id="_ref-cd-823_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cd-823" title="">[11]</a></sup> In 1251, Mindaugas agreed to receive baptism and relinquish control over some lands in western Lithuania, for which he was to receive a crown in return. In 1252, Tautvilas and his remaining allies attacked Mindaugas in <a href="/wiki/Voruta" id="w">Voruta</a>, sometimes considered to be the first capital of Lithuania.

Vykintas died in or about 1253, and Tautvilas was forced to rejoin Daniel of Halych. Daniel reconciled with Mindaugas in 1254; the Black Ruthenian lands were transferred to Roman, the son of Daniel.

<p>As promised, Mindaugas and his wife <a href="/wiki/Morta" id="w">Morta</a> were crowned at some time during the summer of 1253, and the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Lithuania" id="w">Kingdom of Lithuania</a>, proclaimed by the pope in 1251, was soundly established. July 6 is now celebrated as &#34;Statehood Day&#34; (Lithuanian: <i>Valstybės diena</i>); it is an official holiday in modern Lithuania.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> However, the exact date of the coronation is not known; the scholarship of historian <a href="/wiki/Edvardas_Gudavi%C4%8Dius" id="w">Edvardas Gudavičius</a>, who promulgated this date, is sometimes challenged.<sup id="_ref-voruta_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-voruta" title="">[3]</a></sup> The location of the coronation also remains unknown.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Pope_Innocent_IV" id="w">Pope Innocent IV</a> supported Mindaugas, hoping that a new Christian state could stem the inroads being made by the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Horde" id="w">Golden Horde</a>, a state of <a href="/wiki/Mongols" id="w">Mongols</a>-<a href="/wiki/Tatars" id="w">Tatars</a>.<sup id="_ref-LV-Mind_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LV-Mind" title="">[9]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/July_17" id="w">July 17</a>, <a href="/wiki/1251" id="w">1251</a>, the pope signed two crucial <a href="/wiki/Papal_bull" id="w">papal bulls</a>.

The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the pope.<sup id="_ref-MGweb_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MGweb" title="">[7]</a></sup> This was a welcome development to the Lithuanians, since they were concerned that their long-standing antagonists, the Livonian Order, would exert too much control over the new state.<sup id="_ref-gerutis_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gerutis" title="">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It took some time before a Bishop of Lithuania was appointed because of various conflicts of interest. The Bishop of <a href="/wiki/Gniezno" id="w">Gniezno</a> appointed Vito (Lithuanian: <i>Vitas</i>), a monk of the <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Order" id="w">Dominican Order</a>, to this position, but he was not recognized by Mindaugas or accepted by the populace.

Mindaugas endowed him with some lands in Samogitia, but not much is known about his activities.

The Livonian Order used this period to consolidate their control over Samogitian lands.

<p>Mindaugas then formed an alliance with <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Nevsky" id="w">Alexander Nevsky</a> of <a href="/wiki/Novgorod" id="w">Novgorod</a> and marched against the Order.

After Mindaugas&#39; death, the state did not disintegrate and Treniota took over the title of Grand Duke. However, his power was fragile; he was challenged by Tautvilas, who had not forgotten his own claim to power. Tautvilas was also assassinated. However, just a year later, in 1264, Treniota was killed by Mindaugas&#39; son <a href="/wiki/Vai%C5%A1vilkas" id="w">Vaišvilkas</a> and his ally from Volhynia, <a href="/wiki/Svarn" id="w">Svarn</a>.

<p>The circumstances surrounding the advance to power in 1269 of the next ruler, <a href="/wiki/Traidenis" id="w">Traidenis</a>, are not clear. From the outset his relationships with Halych-Volhynia were tense and eventually resulted in the 1274–1276 war. Traidenis was successful in battle, and his control over Black Ruthenia was strengthened.<sup id="_ref-cd-831_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cd-831" title="">[16]</a></sup> Traidenis, known for his strong anti-German attitude,<sup id="_ref-kiaupa_p" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiaupa" title="">[5]</a></sup> was also successful in fighting with the Livonian Order. In 1270 he won the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Karuse" id="w">Battle of Karuse</a>, fought on ice near <a href="/wiki/Saaremaa" id="w">Saaremaa</a>. However, in 1272 the Order retaliated, attacking Semigalia and building Dünaburg (<a href="/wiki/Daugavpils" id="w">Daugavpils</a>) Castle in 1273 on lands nominally controlled by Traidenis.<sup id="_ref-kiaupa_q" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kiaupa" title="">[5]</a></sup> Several years later, in 1281, Traidenis conquered Jersika Castle in the present-day <a href="/wiki/Prei%C4%BCi_District" id="w">Preiļi District</a>, and was able to exchange it for   the Dünaburg Castle.<sup id="_ref-cd-831_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cd-831" title="">[16]</a></sup> Dünaburg remained a Lithuanian outpost until 1313.

Traidenis&#39; reign was the longest and most stable regime during the period of unrest.

<p>There is considerable uncertainty about the identities of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis&#39; death in 1282 and <a href="/wiki/Vytenis" id="w">Vytenis</a>&#39;s assumption of power in 1295. In 1285, one chronicle mentions <a href="/wiki/Daumantas_of_Lithuania" id="w">Daumantas</a> as Grand Duke.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Gediminids" id="w">Gediminid</a> dynasty began its ascent in Lithuania during this time with the emergence of its first leader, <a href="/wiki/Butigeidis" id="w">Butigeidis</a>.<sup id="_ref-LV-Butigeidis_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LV-Butigeidis" title="">[20]</a></sup> In 1289, leading about 8,000 troops, he attacked <a href="/wiki/Sambia" id="w">Sambia</a>. In 1289 the Teutonic Knights built a castle in present-day <a href="/wiki/Sovetsk%2C_Kaliningrad_Oblast" id="w">Sovetsk</a> (Tilsit) and their raids intensified.

<p>The period from 1219 to 1295 also shaped future conflicts: the <a href="/wiki/Lithuanian_mythology" id="w">pagan Lithuanians</a> were surrounded by the aggressive <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic</a> Orders to its north and southwest, and by adherents of the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" id="w">Orthodox Church</a> in the east.
