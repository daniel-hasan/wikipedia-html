<a id="Synopsis" name="Synopsis"></a><h1> Synopsis </h1>

<p><a href="/wiki/Elder_(Latter_Day_Saints)" id="w">Elder</a> Aaron Davis (<a href="/wiki/Steve_Sandvoss" id="w">Steve Sandvoss</a>), a young <a href="/wiki/Mormon" id="w">Mormon</a> missionary from <a href="/wiki/Pocatello%2C_Idaho" id="w">Pocatello, Idaho</a>, is sent to <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles%2C_California" id="w">Los Angeles</a> with three other missionaries to spread the Mormon faith. They move into a bungalow apartment next to the apartment of openly gay party boy Christian Markelli (<a href="/wiki/Wes_Ramsey" id="w">Wes Ramsey</a>), an aspiring actor who works as a waiter at <i>Lila&#39;s</i>, a trendy restaurant owned by retired actress Lila Montagne (<a href="/wiki/Jacqueline_Bisset" id="w">Jacqueline Bisset</a>). Intrigued by his new, sober Mormon neighbors, Christian makes a $50 bet with his cynical co-workers that he can seduce one of them. Christian soon realizes that Aaron, the most inexperienced missionary, is a closeted homosexual.</p>
<p>Aaron and Christian become acquainted after several encounters in the apartment complex. When Christian accidentally cuts himself on a piece of metal and faints, Aaron helps him indoors and cleans his wound. Christian seizes the opportunity to seduce Aaron and nearly succeeds. However, the hesitant Mormon becomes upset by Christian&#39;s standard patter that sex &#34;doesn&#39;t have to mean anything.&#34; Aaron angrily replies that Christian &#34;equates sex with a handshake&#34;, and after accusing him of being superficial and shallow, walks out. Worried that Aaron is right, Christian joins Project Angel Food to deliver meals to people with <a href="/wiki/AIDS" id="w">AIDS</a>, through which he befriends a man named Keith (<a href="/wiki/Erik_Palladino" id="w">Erik Palladino</a>).</p>
<p>Later, Aaron&#39;s fellow missionary, Paul Ryder (<a href="/wiki/Joseph_Gordon-Levitt" id="w">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a>), has a cycling accident. On returning to his apartment, a distraught Aaron encounters Christian, who tries to comfort him with a hug. Both men are overwhelmed by their feelings and end up kissing. Lost in the moment, they fail to notice the return of Aaron&#39;s roommates. Christian is ordered to leave. He returns to the missionaries&#39; apartment the next day to explain himself, but is told that Aaron has been sent home in disgrace. This leads to a confrontation with Elder Ryder, who is angry that Christian has corrupted a decent young man for no apparent purpose. Christian admits that he initially just wanted to win a bet, but says &#34;it&#39;s not about that&#34; anymore.<a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Latterdays_001.jpg" title="Aaron and Christian discuss their lives."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latterdays_001.jpg" alt="Aaron and Christian discuss their lives." title="Aaron and Christian discuss their lives." class="location-right type-thumb" />

<div class="thumbcaption">Aaron and Christian discuss their lives.</div></p>
<p>Recognizing Christian&#39;s genuine distress, Ryder softens enough to tell him that Aaron has a five-hour layover in <a href="/wiki/Salt_Lake_City" id="w">Salt Lake City</a>. Christian catches the next flight there and eventually finds Aaron standing in the snow outside the terminal. Christian confesses his love, and despite his profound misgivings, Aaron admits his own feelings of love. With all flights cancelled due to a snowstorm, Christian and Aaron are able to spend a loving and intimate night together in a nearby motel. However, when Christian awakes in the morning, he finds Aaron has gone. He returns sadly to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>On arriving home in Idaho, Aaron is <a href="/wiki/Excommunicated" id="w">excommunicated</a> by the church elders, led by his own father (Jim Ortlieb), who is the <a href="/wiki/Stake_President" id="w">Stake President</a> (regional leader). Aaron is rejected by his father and scolded by his mother (<a href="/wiki/Mary_Kay_Place" id="w">Mary Kay Place</a>), who informs him of the $50 bet she is told about by the Mission President. Overwhelmed by despair, he tries to commit suicide. Aaron is sent by his parents to a treatment facility to undergo <a href="/wiki/Aversion_therapy" id="w">aversion therapy</a> to &#34;cure&#34; him of his homosexuality.</p>
<p>Christian is desperate to find Aaron and eventually locates his home address and phone number. On phoning, he is devastated to be told by Aaron&#39;s mother that &#34;Thanks to you, my son took a razor to his wrists; thanks to you I have <i>lost</i> my son.&#34;  Believing that Aaron is dead, Christian seeks out the family home in Idaho, where he tearfully returns Aaron&#39;s family heirloom watch to his mother. She recognizes that she may have been too harsh in her judgment, but is too late to stop Christian before he drives off.</p>
<p>Late one night in the treatment facility, Aaron watches a music video on television. The song was written by Christian&#39;s roommate, Julie, who described her friend&#39;s anguish at losing Aaron. The video prompts Aaron to return to Los Angeles in search of Christian. Believing that Christian has given up his apartment, and having nowhere else to go, Aaron makes his way to Lila&#39;s restaurant. By chance, he had befriended Lila while on missionary work after her life partner died, though he did not realize that she owned the restaurant where Christian worked. Christian is shocked but overjoyed at seeing Aaron alive, and their reconciliation ends the movie on a happy note. Together with Christian&#39;s co-workers, they celebrate <a href="/wiki/Thanksgiving" id="w">Thanksgiving</a> and look forward to a happy future together.</p>
<a id="Development_and_production" name="Development_and_production"></a><h1>Development and production</h1>
<p><i>Latter Days</i> was written by C. Jay Cox after the success of his previous screenplay, <i><a href="/wiki/Sweet_Home_Alabama_(film)" id="w">Sweet Home Alabama</a></i>, gave him the financial resources and critical credit to write a more personal love story.<sup id="_ref-Zap Interview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Zap Interview" title="">[4]</a></sup> Cox based both characters—Christian and Aaron—on himself. He was raised as a <a href="/wiki/Mormon" id="w">Mormon</a> and served at a mission before coming out as gay, and had wondered what the two halves of himself would have said to each other if they had ever met.<sup id="_ref-Belief_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Belief" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>

<p>The film was banned by Madstone Theaters, a cinema chain in Utah, which claimed it was &#34;not up to our artistic quality.&#34;<sup id="_ref-DVD_j" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DVD" title="">[7]</a></sup> The company was allegedly pressured with threatened boycotts and protests by conservative groups to withdraw their planned release.<sup id="_ref-MCN_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MCN" title="">[2]</a></sup>  At the box office, <i>Latter Days</i> made only $834,685, but it was never shown at more than 19 screens at any one time.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup>  Critical reviews have also been mixed: one wrote, &#34;Cox&#39;s screenplay, while occasionally lapsing into the sort of clichés endemic to so many gay-themed films, generally treats its unusual subject matter with dignity and complexity.&#34;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Film critic <a href="/wiki/Roger_Ebert" id="w">Roger Ebert</a> gave it two and a half stars, writing &#34;the movie could have been (a) a gay love story, or (b) an attack on the Mormon Church, but is an awkward fit by trying to be (c) both at the same time.&#34;<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> There have been positive reviews as well, with one critic saying <i>Latter Days</i> was &#34;the most important gay male movie of the past few years.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Jam_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jam" title="">[13]</a></sup> <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> was also positive, saying, &#34;at once romantic, earthy and socially critical, &#39;Latter Days&#39; is a dynamic film filled with humor and pathos.&#34;<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> The average film critic rating on Rottentomatoes.com, a popular film rating website, is 42%.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Themes" name="Themes"></a><h1>Themes</h1>
<p>C. Jay Cox has stated that the film is primarily about a love story between two characters.<sup id="_ref-Killer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Killer" title="">[16]</a></sup> There is also an exploration of religious attitudes towards homosexuality, and the dilemma of religious homosexuals, torn between who they are and what they believe. A non-fiction film with similar themes that has been contrasted with <i>Latter Days</i> is <i><a href="/wiki/Trembling_before_G-d" id="w">Trembling before G-d</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Jam_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Jam" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cox has also said that there is a massive irony, both in the film and in real life, that a religion so focused on the family and its importance is ripping families apart through its teaching on homosexuality.<sup id="_ref-Killer_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Killer" title="">[16]</a></sup> In fact, Cox believes one cannot be Mormon and gay.<sup id="_ref-Belief_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Belief" title="">[5]</a></sup> Nevertheless, a major theme of <i>Latter Days</i> is that there is an underlying spirituality in the world that goes beyond the rituals and dogmas of religion.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> This can be particularly seen in the scene where, after a day of making phone calls, Christian finally traces Aaron, writes down his phone number, and then discovers he has already idly drawn it on the previous page.</p>
<a id="Soundtrack" name="Soundtrack"></a><h1>Soundtrack</h1>
<p>Eric Allaman scored the soundtrack to the film after shooting wrapped, and composed much of the score himself. Several scenes featuring the rapid passing of time, such as Christian&#39;s desperate search for Aaron at <a href="/wiki/Salt_Lake_City_Airport" id="w">Salt Lake City Airport</a>, were scored with techno style beats, and scenes with emotional content were given a more &#34;ambient &#39;tronica feel.&#34;<sup id="_ref-DVD_k" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DVD" title="">[7]</a></sup> A total of three songs were written by C. Jay Cox for Julie to sing: &#34;Another Beautiful Day,&#34; &#34;More,&#34; and &#34;Tuesday 3 AM.&#34; Allaman was very impressed with C. Jay Cox&#39;s musical ability, and both men composed more songs as background music.<sup id="_ref-DVD_l" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DVD" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The official soundtrack album was released on <a href="/wiki/October_26" id="w">October 26</a>, <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a>. For contractual reasons, <a href="/wiki/Rebekah_Johnson" id="w">Rebekah Johnson</a> did not appear on the album, and her character&#39;s songs were performed by Nita Whitaker instead.<sup id="_ref-DVD_m" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DVD" title="">[7]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

In 2004, the <i>Latter Days</i> screenplay was adapted into a novel by T. Fabris, which was published by <a href="/wiki/Alyson_Publications" id="w">Alyson Publications</a>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> The book was faithful to the film, but added several extra scenes that explained confusing aspects of the film and gave more about the characters&#39; backgrounds. For example, the reason Ryder tells Christian where to find Aaron is his own broken heart over a girl he fell in love with while on his mission training.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> The novel also added dialogue that had been cut out of the film: finishing, for example Christian&#39;s cry - in the film - of &#34;That&#39;s the hand I use to...&#34; with &#34;masturbate with.&#34;<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>In France, <i>Latter Days</i> has been titled <i>La Tentation d&#39;Aaron</i> (&#34;The Temptation of Aaron&#34;), and the DVD given a cover showing Aaron in a nude and suggestive pose. A new trailer has also been released, which is considerably more sexual than the original.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
