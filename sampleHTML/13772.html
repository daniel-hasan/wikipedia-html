<p>{{History of Poland}}</p>
<p>Over the past millennium, the territory ruled by <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a> has shifted and varied greatly. At one time, in the <a href="/wiki/16th_century" id="w">16th century</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" id="w">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> was the second largest state in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a>, after <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a>. At other times there was no separate Polish state at all. Poland regained its independence in <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a>, after more than a century of rule by its neighbours, but its borders shifted again after the Second World War.</p>
<p>In the period following its emergence in the <a href="/wiki/10th_century" id="w">10th century</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Polish nation</a> was led by a series of strong rulers who converted the <a href="/wiki/Poles" id="w">Poles</a> to <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a>, created a strong <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe" id="w">Central European</a> state and integrated Poland into <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_Europe" id="w">European culture</a>. Formidable foreign enemies and internal fragmentation eroded this initial structure in the <a href="/wiki/13th_century" id="w">13th century</a>, but consolidation in the <a href="/wiki/1300s" id="w">1300s</a> laid the base for the dominant <a href="/wiki/Polish_Kingdom" id="w">Polish Kingdom</a> that was to follow. </p>
<p>Beginning with the Lithuanian Grand Duke <a href="/wiki/Jogaila" id="w">Jogaila</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Jagiellon_dynasty" id="w">Jagiellon dynasty</a> (1385–1569) formed the <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Union" id="w">Polish-Lithuanian Union</a>. The partnership proved beneficial for the Poles and Lithuanians, who played a dominant role in one of the most powerful empires in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">Europe</a> for the next three centuries. The <i><a href="/wiki/Nihil_novi" id="w">Nihil novi</a></i> act adopted by the Polish <a href="/wiki/Sejm" id="w">Sejm</a> (<a href="/wiki/Parliament" id="w">parliament</a>) in <a href="/wiki/1505" id="w">1505</a>, transferred most of the <a href="/wiki/Legislative_power" id="w">legislative power</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Monarch" id="w">Monarch</a> to the Sejm. This event marked the beginning of the period known as &#34;<a href="/wiki/History_of_Poland_(1569-1795)" id="w">Nobility Commonwealth</a>&#34; when the <a href="/wiki/State" id="w">State</a> was ruled by the &#34;free and equal&#34; Polish <a href="/wiki/Szlachta" id="w">nobility</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Lublin_Union" id="w">Lublin Union</a> of 1569, established the <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" id="w">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> as an influential player in <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> <a href="/wiki/Politics" id="w">politics</a> and a vital <a href="/wiki/Culture" id="w">cultural</a> entity.</p>
<p>By the <a href="/wiki/18th_century" id="w">18th century</a> the nobles&#39; democracy had gradually declined into <a href="/wiki/Anarchy_(word)" id="w">anarchy</a>, making the once powerful Commonwealth vulnerable to foreign intervention. Over the course of three successive <a href="/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland" id="w">partitions</a> by the countries bordering it (Russia, Austria and Prussia), the Commonwealth was steadily reduced in size and ultimately ceased to exist in 1795. The idea of Polish independence was kept alive by events inside and outside of Poland throughout the <a href="/wiki/19th_century" id="w">19th century</a>.</p>
<p>Poland&#39;s location in the very center of Europe became especially significant in a period when both <a href="/wiki/Prussia" id="w">Prussia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" id="w">Russia</a> were intensely involved in European rivalries and alliances and modern nation states were established over the entire <a href="/wiki/History_of_Europe#The 16th, 17th and 18th century" id="w">continent</a>. Poland regained its independence in 1918, but the <a href="/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic" id="w">Second Polish Republic</a> was destroyed by <a href="/wiki/Germany" id="w">Germany</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland_(1939)" id="w">Invasion of Poland</a> at the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" id="w">Second World War</a>. Nevertheless the <a href="/wiki/Polish_government_in_exile" id="w">Polish government in exile</a> never surrendered and <a href="/wiki/Polish_contribution_to_World_War_II" id="w">managed to contribute significantly</a> to the Allied victory. <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Nazi Germany</a>&#39;s forces were forced to retreat from Poland as the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a> advanced, which led to the creation of <a href="/wiki/People%26%2339%3Bs_Republic_of_Poland" id="w">People&#39;s Republic of Poland</a>, a Soviet <a href="/wiki/Satellite_state" id="w">satellite state</a>. By the late 1980s, a Polish reform movement, <a href="/wiki/Solidarity" id="w">Solidarity</a>, was able to enforce a peaceful transistion from <a href="/wiki/Communist_state" id="w">communist state</a> to <a href="/wiki/Democracy" id="w">democracy</a>, which resulted in the creation of the modern Polish state.</p>
<a id="Early_history" name="Early_history"></a><h1>Early history</h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>

<p>Most Scholars agree that the original Slav homeland lay within the boundaries of modern Poland in the Odra (Oder) and Wisla (Vistula) basins. The Slavs subsequently expanded into territories to the east, south and west and became increasingly differentiated until, by AD 800, three main geographical and linguistic divisions had arisen; the East Slavs inhabiting a large part of European Russia, the South Slavs who settled in the Balkan Peninsula, and the West Slavs who settled in what is now Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany. </p>
<p>The West Slavs suffered different fates; the Lusatians and Veleti were absorbed by German expansion, the Czechs and Moravians merged to form the nucleus of the Czech Kingdom, whilst the Slovaks became part of the kingdom of Hungary. The remaining tribes, including the Polanie, Wislanie, Pomorzanie and the Mazovians, joined together (in time) to form the Polish State.</p>
<p>The Polish state was born in 966 with the <a href="/wiki/Baptism_of_Poland" id="w">baptism</a> of <a href="/wiki/Mieszko_I_of_Poland" id="w">Mieszko I</a>, duke of the <a href="/wiki/Slavic_peoples" id="w">Slavic</a> tribe of <a href="/wiki/Polans_(western)" id="w">Polans</a> and founder of the <a href="/wiki/Piast_dynasty" id="w">Piast dynasty</a>. His conversion from paganism to <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a> was Poland&#39;s first recorded historical event.  By 990, when <a href="/wiki/Mieszko" id="w">Mieszko</a> officially submitted to the authority of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See" id="w">Holy See</a>, he had transformed his country into one of the strongest powers in <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Europe" id="w">Eastern Europe</a>. Mieszko&#39;s son <a href="/wiki/Boleslaus_I_of_Poland" id="w">Bolesław the Brave</a> built on his father&#39;s achievements, for the first time uniting all the provinces that subsequently came to comprise the traditional territory of Poland. In 1025 he became the first king of Poland. After his death the country entered a period of instabiliy under Boleslaw&#39;s son, Mieszko II (990-1034). Six years after Mieszko II was crowned king, he was defeated by the Holy Roman Empire in 1031. However the nation made a recovery under his son, Casimir the Restorer (1016-1058). Casimir rebuilt the early medieval Polish monarchy. Casimir&#39;s son Boleslaw the Daring, also known as the Generous (1040-1081) revived Polish military strength and with the blessing of Pope Gregory VII crowned himself king in 1076. There was a conspiracy that involved Boleslaw&#39;s brother Wladyslaw Herman (1040-1102) and the Bishop of Krakow. Boleslaw had Bishop of Krakow Stanislaw tortured and executed. However Boleslaw was forced to abdicate the Polish throne because of pressure from Catholic Church and nobility. In time of unstable reign of his brother Wladyslaw Herman who was strongly dependant from leader of nobles Sieciech, Poland was divided beetween him and his two sons - Zbigniew and Boleslaw. After death of Wladyslaw, The son of Wladyslaw was then crowned duke of Poland. His name was <a href="/wiki/Boleslaus_III_of_Poland" id="w">Bolesław the Wrymouth</a> (1102-1138), soon he blinded and executed his half brother Zbigniew. In 1135 he would be forced to pay tribute to the Emperor Lothair III for Western Pomerania, which he held in fief. After he died in 1138, however, the kingdom was divided among four of his sons, ushering in a period of fragmentation. For two centuries, the Piasts sparred with each other, the clergy, and the nobility for control over the divided kingdom. The civil strife and foreign invasions, such as <a href="/wiki/Mongol_invasions" id="w">Mongol invasions</a> in 1241 and 1259, weakened and depopulated the small Polish principalities. This caused a massive immigration of German settlers into Poland. They brought with them German laws and customs which the Poles adopted. Germans made up a significant minority up until the 20th century. </p>
<p>The 12th and 13th centuries were marked by the economic and social evolution of Poland into a Western Christian state. In 1228, the Acts of Cienia were passed and signed into law by <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_III_Spindleshanks" id="w">Duke Wladyslaw III</a>. The Duke of Poland promised to provide a &#34;just and noble law according to the council of bishops and barons.&#34; The Acts of Cienia were very similar to the English <a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta" id="w">Magna Carta</a> of 1215. The Act of Cienia guaranteed Wladyslaw that he would become the next king of Poland.</p>
<p>St. Adalbert or <a href="/wiki/Adalbert_of_Prague" id="w">Adalbert of Prague</a> (Swiety Wojciech) was a member of the Slawnikowics (<a href="/wiki/Slavn%C3%ADk%26%2339%3Bs_dynasty" id="w">Slavník&#39;s dynasty</a>), a <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" id="w">Czech</a> noble family, who had to flee their native <a href="/wiki/Bohemia" id="w">Bohemia</a> after losing a power stuggle with the Czech ruler <a href="/wiki/Boleslaus_II_of_Bohemia" id="w">Boleslaus II of Bohemia</a>. St. Adalbert was initially bishop of <a href="/wiki/Prague" id="w">Prague</a> and wrote a treatise titled &#34;Infelix Aurum&#34; which condemned the slave trade. He went to <a href="/wiki/Hungary" id="w">Hungary</a> and baptized <a href="/wiki/G%C3%A9za_of_Hungary" id="w">Géza of Hungary</a> and his son <a href="/wiki/Stephen" id="w">Stephen</a> in the city of <a href="/wiki/Esztergom" id="w">Esztergom</a>. Then he went to Poland where he was cordially welcomed by <a href="/wiki/Boles%C5%82aw_I_the_Brave" id="w">Bolesław I the Brave</a>. Bohemian rulers (i.e., Přemyslids) refused to ransom Saint Adalbert&#39;s body from the <a href="/wiki/Prussians" id="w">Prussians</a> who murdered him, so it was purchased by Poles. He was declared the patron saint of Poland in the 11th and 12th centuries. His Latin biography was the beginning of Latin Polish literature.</p>
<p>In 1226, <a href="/wiki/Konrad_I_of_Masovia" id="w">Konrad I of Masovia</a> invited the <a href="/wiki/Teutonic_Knights" id="w">Teutonic Knights</a> to help him fight the pagan <a href="/wiki/Prussian_people" id="w">Prussian people</a> on the border of his lands. In the following decades, the Teutonic Order conquered large areas long the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Sea" id="w">Baltic Sea</a> coast and established their <a href="/wiki/Monastic_State_of_the_Teutonic_Knights" id="w">monastic state</a>. When virtually all of the former heathen Baltic people had become Christians, the Knights turned their attention to Poland and Lithuania, waging war with them for most of the 14th and 15th centuries until their remaining state was converted into the Protestant <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Prussia" id="w">Duchy of Prussia</a> under the King of Poland in 1525.</p>
<p>In 1308, a group of armed German monks, known as the Order of the Knights of Riga, committed mass murder of hundreds of Polish peasants and knights. In 1318, the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" id="w">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_XXII" id="w">Pope John XXII</a> appointed inqisitors to determine the truth of the massacure, but the inquisitors were inactive in their duties. The church eventually held a trial in 1320-1321, and convicted the knights of murder and ordered them to compensate the Poles and evacuate all of Bohemia. However the Knights refused to obey the Popes orders and a war ensued. It was then in 1325 that the Poles and Lithuainians made a treaty to defeat the Teutonic Knights who were invading both lands. The Teutonic Order made a treaty with Bohemia. From 1327-1332, the Polish-Lithuanian armies fought the invading Teutonic Order. Despite some success, the Teutonic Knights captured Kujaway and Dobrzyn. It was during these wars that the Mongols invaded Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>In the middle of 14th century Poland started to expand to the East and annexed Galich Rus&#39;.</p>
<p>The regional division ended when <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_I_the_Elbow-high" id="w">Władysław I the Elbow-high</a> united the various principalities of <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a>. His son <a href="/wiki/Casimir_III_of_Poland" id="w">Kazimierz the Great</a>, the last of the <a href="/wiki/Piast" id="w">Piast</a> dynasty, considerably strengthened the country&#39;s position in both foreign and domestic affairs. Before his death in 1370, the heirless king arranged for his nephew, the <a href="/wiki/Andegawen" id="w">Andegawen</a> <a href="/wiki/Louis_I_of_Hungary" id="w">Louis of Hungary</a>, to inherit the throne.</p>
<p>In 1385, the <a href="/wiki/Union_of_Krewo" id="w">Union of Krewo</a> was signed between Louis&#39; daughter <a href="/wiki/Jadwiga_of_Poland" id="w">Jadwiga</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jogaila" id="w">Jogaila</a>, Grand Duke of Lithuania (later known as Władysław II Jagiełło), beginning the <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Union" id="w">Polish-Lithuanian Union</a> and strengthening both nations in their shared opposition to the Teutonic Knights and the growing threat of <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow" id="w">Grand Duchy of Moscow</a>.</p>

<p>After the death of Casmir the Great the period of hereditary monarchy in Poland ended. Casmir did not have any male heirs to succeed him. The Polish nobility could not determine who would be the new Polish king. The land owners and nobles did not want a strong monarchy. A constitutional monarchy was established between (1370-1493)</p>
<p>During the reign of King Ludwik I, the nations of Poland formed a union with Hungary. This union was known as the Act of Koszyce. This union lasted for twelve years and ended in war. The failure of the union of Poland and Hungary paved the way for the union of Lithuania and Poland. </p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Personal_union" id="w">personal union</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Grand_duchy" id="w">Grand Duchy</a> of <a href="/wiki/Lithuania" id="w">Lithuania</a> to the North-East, paved the way for the extension of Polish power far to the East and the creation (by the <a href="/wiki/Union_of_Lublin" id="w">Union of Lublin</a> in 1569), of a unified <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" id="w">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> (<i><a href="/wiki/Rzeczpospolita" id="w">Rzeczpospolita</a></i>), stretching from the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Sea" id="w">Baltic Sea</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains" id="w">Carpathian</a> mountains, to present-day <a href="/wiki/Belarus" id="w">Belarus</a> and Western and Central <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" id="w">Ukraine</a> (which earlier had been Kievan Rus&#39; principalities).</p>
<p>In the north-west, the <a href="/wiki/Teutonic_Knights" id="w">Teutonic Knights</a>, in control of <a href="/wiki/Prussia" id="w">Prussia</a> since the 13th century, were defeated by a combined Polish-Lithuanian force in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Grunwald" id="w">Battle of Grunwald</a> (1410), and in the later <a href="/wiki/Thirteen_Years_War" id="w">Thirteen Years War</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/Peace_of_Toru%C5%84_1466" id="w">Second Treaty of Toruń</a> of 1466, they had to surrender the Western half of their territory to the Polish crown (the areas known afterwards as <a href="/wiki/Royal_Prussia" id="w">Royal Prussia</a>), and to accept Polish-Lithuanian <a href="/wiki/Suzerainty" id="w">suzerainty</a> over the remainder (the later <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Prussia" id="w">Ducal Prussia</a>). </p>
<p>During this period <a href="/wiki/Poland" id="w">Poland</a> became the home to Europe&#39;s largest Jewish population, as royal edicts guaranteeing Jewish safety and religious freedom, issued during the 13th <a href="/wiki/Century" id="w">century</a>, contrasted with bouts of persecution in <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe" id="w">Western Europe</a>. This persecution intensified following the <a href="/wiki/Black_Death" id="w">Black Death</a> of 1348–1349, when some in the West blamed the outbreak of the plague on the Jews. Much of Poland was spared from this disease, and Jewish immigration brought their valuable contributions and abilities to the rising state. The greatest increase in <a href="/wiki/Jewish" id="w">Jewish</a> numbers occurred in the 18th century, when Jews came to make up 7% of the population. Generally speaking, the Kings of Poland, and the <a href="/wiki/Szlachta" id="w">szlachta</a> (nobles), were friendly to the Jews, while the peasants and the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic Church</a> were not.</p>
<a id="Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" name="Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth"></a><h1>Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>During the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, in the 16th century, Poland became an <a href="/wiki/Elective_monarchy" id="w">elective monarchy</a>, in which the king was elected by the hereditary <a href="/wiki/Szlachta" id="w">nobility</a>. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would have another election.</p>
<p>In 1572, the Polish king <a href="/wiki/Sigismund_II_Augustus" id="w">Sigismund II Augustus</a> died without any heirs. At the time, Poland didn’t have any method of choosing a king if such a thing happened. It took a long time for the Poles to decide how to elect their king. Finally, after much debate, they decided to let the entire nobility of Poland decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather near Warsaw and vote in a “free election”. However, they did not have elections every two or four years like most countries do today. Instead, they voted after the death of the old king.</p>
<p>The first Polish election was held in 1573. There were four men running for king in this election. These men were, <a href="/wiki/Henry_III_of_France" id="w">Henri of Valois</a> (<i>Henryk Walezy</i>), who was the brother of the <a href="/wiki/Charles_IX_of_France" id="w">king of France</a> Charles IX, the Russian czar <a href="/wiki/Ivan_IV_of_Russia" id="w">Ivan IV &#34;the Terrible&#34;</a>, <a href="/wiki/Archduke_Ernest_of_Austria" id="w">Archduke Ernest</a> from the Austrian Habsburg dynasty, and the king of Sweden, <a href="/wiki/John_III_of_Sweden" id="w">Johan Vasa III</a>. Henri of Valois was the winner in a very disorderly election. The reason for so much disorder was that a huge number of people came to elect the new king. But after serving as Polish king for only four months, he received news that his brother had died. He then went to France and claimed the throne as <a href="/wiki/Henry_III_of_France" id="w">Henry III</a>. This surprised much of the country because Poland had a better economy at the time.</p>
<p>From <a href="/wiki/1569" id="w">1569</a> the <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" id="w">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> suffered a series of <a href="/wiki/Tatar_invasions" id="w">Tatar invasions</a>, the goal of which was to loot, pillage and capture slaves into jasyr. The borderland area to the south-east was in a state of semi-permanent warfare until the <a href="/wiki/18th_century" id="w">18th century</a>. Some researchers estimate that altogether more than 3 million people, predominantly <a href="/wiki/Ukrainians" id="w">Ukrainians</a> but also <a href="/wiki/Circassians" id="w">Circassians</a>, <a href="/wiki/Russians" id="w">Russians</a>, <a href="/wiki/Belarusians" id="w">Belarusians</a> and <a href="/wiki/Poles" id="w">Poles</a>, were captured and enslaved during the time of the <a href="/wiki/Crimean_Khanate" id="w">Crimean Khanate</a>. </p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1593" id="w">1593</a>, <a href="/wiki/1626" id="w">1626</a>, <a href="/wiki/1637" id="w">1637</a>-<a href="/wiki/1638" id="w">1638</a> and <a href="/wiki/1648" id="w">1648</a>-<a href="/wiki/1654" id="w">1654</a> several <a href="/wiki/Cossack" id="w">Cossack</a> uprisings took place. The last one led by <a href="/wiki/Bohdan_Khmelnytsky" id="w">Bohdan Khmelnytsky</a> lasted for six years. As a result of several requests from the Ukrainian hetman Ukraine was taken under the protection of <a href="/wiki/Russia" id="w">Russia</a>. The agreement was made in January of <a href="/wiki/1654" id="w">1654</a> in the city of <a href="/wiki/Pereyaslavl" id="w">Pereyaslavl</a> (Ukraine). This breakout led to a new Russian-Polish war that lasted from 1654 to 1667. In the end, the parties signed an agreement in the village of Andrusovo (near <a href="/wiki/Smolensk" id="w">Smolensk</a>) according to which the eastern Ukraine now belonged to Russia (with a high degree of local autonomy and an internal army).</p>
<p>Poland stopped electing after the <a href="/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland" id="w">Partitions of Poland</a>. The elected kings in chronological order were: Henri of Valois, <a href="/wiki/Stefan_Batory" id="w">Stefan Batory</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sigismund_III_Vasa" id="w">Zygmunt Waza III</a>, <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_IV_Vasa" id="w">Wladyslaw Waza IV</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_II_Casimir_of_Poland" id="w">Jan Kazmierz Waza</a>, <a href="/wiki/Micha%C5%82_Korybut_Wi%C5%9Bniowiecki" id="w">Michał I (Wiśniowiecki)</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_III_Sobieski" id="w">Jan III (Sobieski)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Augustus_II_the_Strong" id="w">August II &#34;The Strong&#34;</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Leszczy%C5%84ski" id="w">Stanisław I (Leszczyński)</a>, <a href="/wiki/Augustus_III_of_Poland" id="w">August III</a> and, last, <a href="/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_August_Poniatowski" id="w">Stanisław II August (Poniatowski)</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" id="w">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, following upon the <a href="/wiki/Union_of_Lublin" id="w">Union of Lublin</a>, became an interesting counterpoint to the <a href="/wiki/Absolute_monarchy" id="w">absolute monarchies</a> gaining power in Europe. Its quasi-<a href="/wiki/Democracy" id="w">democratic</a> <a href="/wiki/Political_system" id="w">political system</a> of <a href="/wiki/Golden_Liberty" id="w">Golden Liberty</a>, albeit limited to <a href="/wiki/Szlachta" id="w">nobility</a> was mostly unprecedented in the <a href="/wiki/History_of_Europe" id="w">history of Europe</a>. </p>
<p>However the series of power struggles between the lesser nobility, the higher nobility (<a href="/wiki/Magnate" id="w">magnates</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Free_election" id="w">elected</a> <a href="/wiki/Monarch" id="w">kings</a> undermined <a href="/wiki/Citizenship" id="w">citizenship</a> values and gradually eroded the <a href="/wiki/Government" id="w">government</a>&#39;s function and authority. After the series of devastating wars in the middle of the 17th century (most notably the <a href="/wiki/Chmielnicki_Uprising" id="w">Chmielnicki Uprising</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Deluge_(Polish_history)" id="w">The Deluge</a>) Poland-Lithuania stopped being an influential player in the politics of Europe. Its <a href="/wiki/Economic_system" id="w">economy</a> and growth was further damaged by the nobility&#39;s reliance on <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" id="w">agriculture</a> and <a href="/wiki/Serfdom" id="w">serfdom</a>, delaying the <a href="/wiki/Industrialization" id="w">industrialization</a> of the country. By the beginning of the 18th century, the Polish-Lithuanian Commownealth, the largest European state, was little more than a pawn of its neighbours (<a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" id="w">Russian Empire</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prussia" id="w">Prussia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Habsburg_Monarchy" id="w">Austria</a>) who interfered in its domestic politics almost at will. </p>
<p>With the coming of the <a href="/wiki/Polish_Enlightenment" id="w">Polish Enlightenment</a> in the second half of the 18th century, the movement for reform and revitalization of the country made important gains, culminating in the adoption of the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_May_3" id="w">Constitution of May 3</a>, the first modern codified <a href="/wiki/Constitution" id="w">constitution</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> continent. However the reforms, which transformed the Commonwealth into a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy" id="w">constitutional monarchy</a> were viewed as dangerous by Poland&#39;s neighbours, who didn&#39;t want the rebirth of the strong Commonwealth. Before the Commonwealth could fully implement and benefit from its reforms, it was <a href="/wiki/War_in_the_Defence_of_the_Constitution" id="w">invaded by its neighbours</a>.</p>

The wars of the 17th. Century had left Poland ruined; her population had decreased by a third and the victory at Vienna was the Commonwealth&#39;s last military success. The need for reform had become obvious even during the reign of Zygmunt III Vasa and the Jesuit preacher, Piotr Skarga, had blamed social injustice as the main cause of evil. The general decline was especially noticed in the Sejm; the parliamentary system grew awkward and ineffective as deputies used the notorious &#34;Liberum Veto&#34;, which allowed any deputy to prevent legislation since all resolutions had to be carried unanimously. </p>
<p>The idea of consensus rule was, in principle, a good one but the &#34;liberum Veto&#34; was first used in 1652 by a deputy in the pay or power of a magnate. It soon became obvious to Poland&#39;s neighbours that the veto could be used to their own political ends and they soon clubbed together to &#34;defend Polish freedoms&#34;. The &#34;szlachta&#34; themselves, becoming less influential as they lost their military valour and, in many cases, impoverished, saw the veto as the last symbol of their ability to play a role in the running of the Commonwealth. </p>
<p>The Decline of Poland:
In 1697 the Elector of Saxony, Augustus, was elected King. From 1700 - 1721, Augustus II allied himself with Russia and became involved in war with Sweden for control of the Baltic (the Great Northern War). Poland became a battlefield and the Polish throne the prize. In 1704 Sweden won, Augustus was removed and the Voivode of Poznan, Stanislaw Leszczynski, was elected in his place. In 1709 the Russians defeated the Swedes at Poltava and Augustus was returned to the throne. </p>
<p>Conflict between Augustus and the Sejm almost ended in civil war in 1717, only prevented by a Russian offer of mediation; 18,000 Russian troops surrounded the chamber where the deputies met, they were denied the right to speak whilst the Russian &#34;mediator&#34; dictated the Russian &#34; solution&#34;. This Sejm became known as the &#34;Dumb Sejm&#34; and the Republic became little more than a Russian client state; this was the start of the Russian &#34;Protectorate&#34; in which Poland was forced to reduce her standing army. On Augustus&#39; death, in 1733, Leszczynski was again elected King but the Russians interfered by sending in an army and rerunning the election; Augustus&#39; son, Frederick Augustus, was elected. </p>
<p>The sixty-six years of Saxon rule, from 1697 - 1763, were a national disaster and drove the country to the brink of anarchy. Most ominous was the fact that in 1732 Russia, Prussia and Austria had entered into a secret alliance to maintain the paralysis of law and order within Poland. This pact became known as the &#34;Alliance of the Three Black Eagles&#34; (since all three powers had a black eagle in their coat-of-arms). </p>
<p>The reign of the magnate, Stanislaw August Poniatowski, 1764 - 1795, a favourite of Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, was totally controlled by Russia. Poniatowski was to become the last King of Poland. </p>
<p>From 1768 - 1772, an anti-Russian rising known as the &#34;Confederation of Bar&#34; was crushed by the Russians. Over 5000 captured &#34;szlachta&#34; were sent to Siberia. Among the few who escaped was Kazimierz Pulaski who was to play an important role in the United States&#39; struggle for independence. </p>
<p>Polish independence ended in a series of <a href="/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland" id="w">Partitions</a> (1772, 1793 and 1795) undertaken by <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Russia" id="w">Russia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Prussia" id="w">Prussia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austria</a>, with Russia gaining most of the Commonwealth&#39;s territory including nearly all of the former <a href="/wiki/Lithuania" id="w">Lithuania</a> (except <a href="/wiki/Podlasie" id="w">Podlasie</a> and lands West from the <a href="/wiki/Niemen_river" id="w">Niemen river</a>), <a href="/wiki/Volhynia" id="w">Volhynia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" id="w">Ukraine</a>. Austria gained the populous southern region henceforth named <a href="/wiki/Galicia_(Central_Europe)" id="w">Galicia</a>–<a href="/wiki/Lodomeria" id="w">Lodomeria</a>, named after the Duchy of <a href="/wiki/Halicz" id="w">Halicz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wlodzimierz_Wolynski" id="w">Volodymyr</a> (The Duchy was briefly occupied by <a href="/wiki/Hungary" id="w">Hungary</a> between 1372 and 1399, and the <a href="/wiki/Habsburg" id="w">Habsburgs</a> claimed to have inherited it from the Hungarian Kings, despite the fact that <a href="/wiki/Wlodzimierz_Wolynski" id="w">Volodymyr</a> was not a part of <a href="/wiki/Galicia_(Eastern_Europe)" id="w">Galicia</a>). In 1795 Austria also gained the land between <a href="/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w" id="w">Kraków</a> and <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" id="w">Warsaw</a>, between <a href="/wiki/Vistula_river" id="w">Vistula river</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pilica_river" id="w">Pilica river</a>. Prussia acquired the western lands from the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Sea" id="w">Baltic</a> through <a href="/wiki/Greater_Poland" id="w">Greater Poland</a> to <a href="/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w" id="w">Kraków</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Warsaw" id="w">Warsaw</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lithuania" id="w">Lithuanian</a> territories to the north-east (<a href="/wiki/August%C3%B3w" id="w">Augustów</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marijampol%C4%97" id="w">Mariampol</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Podlasie" id="w">Podlasie</a>. The last heroic attempt to save Poland&#39;s independence was a national uprising (1794) led by <a href="/wiki/Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko" id="w">Tadeusz Kościuszko</a>, however it was eventually quenched.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">French</a> emperor <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_I" id="w">Napoleon I</a>&#39;s defeat of Prussia, a Polish state was again set up in 1807 under French tutelage as the <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Warsaw" id="w">Duchy of Warsaw</a>.  When Austria was defeated in 1809, Lodomeria was added, giving the new state a population of some 3.75 million, a quarter of that of the former <a href="/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" id="w">Commonwealth</a>.  Polish nationalists were to remain among the staunchest allies of the French as the tide of war turned against them, inaugurating a relationship that continued into the <a href="/wiki/Twentieth_century" id="w">twentieth century</a>. </p>
<p>With Napoleon&#39;s defeat, the <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna" id="w">Congress of Vienna</a> in 1815 converted most of the Grand Duchy into a <a href="/wiki/Congress_Poland" id="w">Kingdom of Poland</a> ruled by the Russian <a href="/wiki/Tsar" id="w">Tsar</a> before the Russian dynasty was deposed from the throne by the Kingdom&#39;s Parliament during the Polish-Russian War of 1830/1. After the <a href="/wiki/January_Uprising" id="w">January Uprising</a> of <a href="/wiki/1863" id="w">1863</a> the Kingdom was fully integrated into Russia proper. Several national uprisings were bloodily subdued by the partitioning powers.  However, the striving of Polish patriots to regain their independence could not be extinguished. The opportunity for freedom appeared only after <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> when the oppressing states were defeated or weakened by a combination of each other, the <a href="/wiki/Allied_Powers" id="w">Allied Powers</a>, and internal revolt (such as the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution" id="w">Russian Revolution</a>).</p>
<a id="Second_Republic" name="Second_Republic"></a><h1>Second Republic</h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">World War I</a> and the political turbulence that was sweeping Europe in 1914 offered the Polish nation hopes for regaining independence. By the end of World War I, Poland had seen the defeat or retreat of all three occupying powers. On the outbreak of war the Poles found themselves conscripted into the armies of Germany, Austria and Russia, and forced to fight each other in a war that was not theirs. Although many Poles sympathised with France and Britain they found it hard to fight with them on the Russian side. They also had little sympathy with the Germans. </p>
<p>Polish independence was eventually proclaimed on <a href="/wiki/November_3" id="w">November 3</a>, <a href="/wiki/1918" id="w">1918</a> and later confirmed by the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" id="w">Treaty of Versailles</a> in 1919; the same treaty also gave Poland some territories annexed by German and Austrian during the partitions (see <a href="/wiki/Polish_Corridor" id="w">Polish Corridor</a>). The post-war eastern borders of Poland were determined by Polish victory in the <a href="/wiki/Polish-Soviet_War" id="w">Polish-Soviet War</a>. From mid 1920s to mid 1930s Polish government was under the control of <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Pi%C5%82sudski" id="w">Józef Piłsudski</a>, the politically-moderate war hero who had engineered the defeat of Soviet forces. Polish independence had boosted the development of culture, but Poland was hit hard by the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a>. The new Polish state had had only 20 years of relative stability and uneasy peace before Poland&#39;s aggressive neighbours tried to wipe her from the map of Europe again. In 1939, under constant threat from Germany, Poland entered into a full military alliance with Britain and France. In August, Germany and Russia signed a secret agreement concerning the future of Poland, the <a href="/wiki/Molotov-Ribbentrop_Pact" id="w">Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact</a>.</p>
<a id="World_War_II" name="World_War_II"></a><h1>World War II</h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>On August 23, 1939, <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" id="w">Nazi Germany</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a> signed the <a href="/wiki/Ribbentrop-Molotov_pact" id="w">Ribbentrop–Molotov</a> non-aggression pact, which secretly provided for the dismemberment of Poland into <a href="/wiki/Nazism" id="w">Nazi</a> and Soviet-controlled zones.  On <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1939" id="w">1939</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hitler" id="w">Hitler</a> ordered his troops into Poland. On <a href="/wiki/September_17" id="w">September 17</a>, Soviet troops marched into and then took control of most of the areas of eastern Poland having significant <a href="/wiki/Ukrainians" id="w">Ukrainian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Belarusians" id="w">Belarusian</a> populations under the terms of this agreement. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Poland was completely occupied by German troops.</p>
<p>The Poles formed an underground resistance movement and a <a href="/wiki/Polish_government_in_exile" id="w">Polish government in exile</a>, first in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> and later in <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a>, which was recognized by the Soviet Union. During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, 400,000 Poles fought under Soviet command, and 200,000 went into combat on Western fronts in units loyal to the Polish government in exile. Many Polish refugee camps were set up, including one in Valdivadé, near <a href="/wiki/Kolhapur" id="w">Kolhapur</a> in <a href="/wiki/India" id="w">India</a>. The camp numbered about 5 000, and the Polish embassy in exile had its office in <a href="/wiki/Bombay" id="w">Bombay</a>. The camp existed from 1943 to 1948.</p>
<p>In April 1943, the Soviet Union broke relations with the Polish government in exile after the German military announced that they had discovered mass graves of murdered Polish army officers at <a href="/wiki/Katy%C5%84_massacre" id="w">Katyń</a>, in the USSR. The Soviets claimed that the Poles had insulted them by requesting that the <a href="/wiki/Red_Cross" id="w">Red Cross</a> investigate these reports. In July 1944, the Soviet <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" id="w">Red Army</a> and the Peoples&#39; Army of Poland (<i><a href="/wiki/Ludowe_Wojsko_Polskie" id="w">Ludowe Wojsko Polskie</a></i> or LWP) entered Poland, defeated the Germans (losing 600,000 of its soldiers), and established a communist-controlled &#34;Polish Committee of National Liberation&#34; in <a href="/wiki/Lublin" id="w">Lublin</a>.</p>
<p>There was powerful hatred of the Nazis in Warsaw, and there was often resistance, most famously the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising" id="w">Warsaw Uprising</a> in 1944 in which most of the Warsaw population participated, but which was largely instigated by the <a href="/wiki/Armia_Krajowa" id="w">Armia Krajowa</a>, or Home Army. The uprising was planned on the condition that the Soviet forces, waiting on the other side of the Vistula River in full force, would help in battle over Warsaw. However, the Soviets betrayed the Poles, stopping their advance at the Vistula and branding them as criminals on radio broadcasts. For the next two months, the Soviets calmly watched as the Nazis returned and brutally suppressed the Underground forces. Historian Professor <a href="/wiki/Norman_Davies" id="w">Norman Davies</a> famously said that to comprehend the numbers killed, one would have to imagine the Twin Towers 9/11 disaster every day for 63 days, and it still wouldn&#39;t be enough. After a hopeless surrender on the part of the Poles, the Germans then carried out Hitler&#39;s request that &#34;there not be two bricks standing&#34; in Warsaw, systematically levelling the city. They retreated only in January 1945 when the Soviets resumed their invasion.</p>
<p>During the war, about 6 million Polish citizens were killed by Germans, and 2.5 million were deported to Germany for forced labour or to extermination camps such as Oświęcim <a href="/wiki/Auschwitz" id="w">Auschwitz</a>. In 1941-1943 Ukrainian nationalists (OUN and Ukrainian Insurgent Army) massacred more than 100,000 Poles in Galicia and Volhynia. More than 500,000 Polish citizens  were deported to the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" id="w">Soviet Union</a>, many of them to <a href="/wiki/Concentration_camp" id="w">concentration camps</a> and <a href="/wiki/Labor_camp" id="w">labor camps</a> (<a href="/wiki/Gulag" id="w">Gulag</a>). </p>
<p>The Soviet government insisted on retaining most of the territories captured in the course of the <a href="/wiki/Nazi-Soviet_pact" id="w">Nazi-Soviet pact</a> in 1939 (now western <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" id="w">Ukraine</a> and western <a href="/wiki/Belarus" id="w">Belarus</a>), compensating Poland with parts of  <a href="/wiki/Silesia" id="w">Silesia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pomerania" id="w">Pomerania</a> and southern <a href="/wiki/East_Prussia" id="w">East Prussia</a>, along with <a href="/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk" id="w">Gdańsk</a>(&#34;<a href="/wiki/Regained_Territories" id="w">Regained Territories</a>&#34;), which were annexed by Poland and <a href="/wiki/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II" id="w">most of German population expelled to Germany</a>.
Over half a million fighting men and women, and 6 million civilians (or 22% of the total population) died. About 50% of these were Polish Christians and 50% were Polish Jews. Approximately 5,384,000, or 89.9% of Polish war losses (Jews and Gentiles) were the victims of prisons, death camps, raids, executions, annihilation of ghettos, epidemics, starvation, excessive work and ill treatment. So many Poles were sent to concentration camps that virtually every family had someone close to them who had been tortured or murdered there. </p>
<p>There were one million war orphans and over half a million invalids. The country lost 38% of its national assets (Britain lost 0.8%, France lost 1.5%). Half the country was swallowed up by the Soviet Union including the two great cultural centres of Lwow and Wilno. Many Poles could not return to the country for which they has fought because they belonged to the &#34;wrong&#34; political group or came from eastern Poland and had thus become Soviet citizens. Others were arrested, tortured and imprisoned by the Soviet authorities for belonging to the Home Army. Although &#34;victors&#34; they were not allowed to partake in victory celebrations.</p>
<a id="People's_Republic_of_Poland" name="People's_Republic_of_Poland"></a><h1>People&#39;s Republic of Poland</h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>In June 1945, following the February <a href="/wiki/Yalta_Conference" id="w">Yalta Conference</a>, a Polish Provisional Government of National Unity was formed; the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">US</a> recognized it the next month. Although the Yalta agreement called for free elections, those held in January 1947 were controlled by the <a href="/wiki/PZPR" id="w">Communist Party</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Communist" id="w">communists</a> then established a regime entirely under their domination. The <a href="/wiki/Polish_government_in_exile" id="w">Polish government in exile</a> existed until 1990, although its influence was degraded.</p>
<p>In October 1956, after the <a href="/wiki/Twentieth_Party_Congress" id="w">20th Soviet Party Congress</a> in <a href="/wiki/Moscow" id="w">Moscow</a> ushered in <a href="/wiki/Destalinization" id="w">destalinization</a> and riots by workers in <a href="/wiki/Pozna%C5%84" id="w">Poznań</a> ensued, there was a shakeup in the communist regime. While retaining most traditional communist economic and social aims, the regime of First Secretary <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Gomu%C5%82ka" id="w">Władysław Gomułka</a> began to liberalize internal Polish life.</p>
<p>In 1968, this trend was reversed when student demonstrations were suppressed and an <a href="/wiki/Anti-Zionism" id="w">anti-Zionist</a> campaign initially directed against Gomułka supporters within the party eventually led to the emigration of much of Poland&#39;s remaining Jewish population. In December 1970, disturbances and strikes in the port cities of <a href="/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk" id="w">Gdańsk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gdynia" id="w">Gdynia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Szczecin" id="w">Szczecin</a>, triggered by a price increase for essential consumer goods, reflected deep dissatisfaction with living and working conditions in the country. <a href="/wiki/Edward_Gierek" id="w">Edward Gierek</a> replaced Gomułka as First Secretary.</p>
<p>Fueled by large infusions of Western credit, Poland&#39;s economic growth rate was one of the world&#39;s highest during the first half of the 1970s.  But much of the borrowed capital was misspent, and the centrally <a href="/wiki/Planned_economy" id="w">planned economy</a> was unable to use the new resources effectively. The growing debt burden became insupportable in the late 1970s, and economic growth had become negative by 1979.</p>
<p>In October 1978, the <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Krak%C3%B3w" id="w">Archbishop of Kraków</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholicism)" id="w">Cardinal</a> <a href="/wiki/Karol_J%C3%B3zef_Wojty%C5%82a" id="w">Karol Józef Wojtyła</a>, became <a href="/wiki/Pope" id="w">Pope</a> <a href="/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II" id="w">John Paul II</a>, head of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic Church</a>. Polish Catholics rejoiced at the elevation of a <a href="/wiki/Poles" id="w">Pole</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Papacy" id="w">papacy</a> and greeted his June 1979 visit to Poland with an outpouring of emotion.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/July_1" id="w">July 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1980" id="w">1980</a>, with the Polish foreign debt at more than $20 billion, the government made another attempt to increase meat prices. A chain reaction of strikes virtually paralyzed the Baltic coast by the end of August and, for the first time, closed most coal mines in <a href="/wiki/Silesia" id="w">Silesia</a>.  Poland was entering into an extended crisis that would change the course of its future development.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/31_August" id="w">31 August</a>, <a href="/wiki/1980" id="w">1980</a>, workers at the Lenin Shipyard in <a href="/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk" id="w">Gdańsk</a>, led by an electrician named <a href="/wiki/Lech_Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa" id="w">Lech Wałęsa</a>, signed a 21-point agreement with the government that ended their strike. Similar agreements were signed at <a href="/wiki/Szczecin" id="w">Szczecin</a> and in <a href="/wiki/Silesia" id="w">Silesia</a>. The key provision of these agreements was the guarantee of the workers’ right to form independent <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" id="w">trade unions</a> and the right to strike. After the Gdańsk agreement was signed, a new national union movement &#34;<a href="/wiki/Solidarity" id="w">Solidarity</a>&#34; swept Poland.</p>
<p>The discontent underlying the strikes was intensified by revelations of widespread corruption and mismanagement within the Polish state and party leadership. In September 1980, Gierek was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Kania" id="w">Stanisław Kania</a> as First Secretary.</p>
<p>Alarmed by the rapid deterioration of the PZPR&#39;s authority following the Gdańsk agreement, the Soviet Union proceeded with a massive military buildup along Poland&#39;s border in December 1980. In February 1981, Defense Minister Gen. <a href="/wiki/Wojciech_Jaruzelski" id="w">Wojciech Jaruzelski</a> assumed the position of Prime Minister, and in October 1981, was named party First Secretary. At the first Solidarity national congress in September–October 1981, Lech Wałęsa was elected national chairman of the union.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/December_12" id="w">December 12</a>–<a href="/wiki/December_13" id="w">13</a>, the regime declared <a href="/wiki/Martial_law" id="w">martial law</a>, under which the army and <a href="/wiki/ZOMO" id="w">ZOMO</a> riot police were used to crush the union.  Virtually all Solidarity leaders and many affiliated intellectuals were arrested or detained.  The United States and other Western countries responded to martial law by imposing economic sanctions against the Polish regime and against the Soviet Union. Unrest in Poland continued for several years thereafter.</p>
<p>In a series of slow, uneven steps, the Polish regime rescinded martial law. In December 1982, martial law was suspended, and a small number of political prisoners were released. Although martial law formally ended in July 1983 and a general amnesty was enacted, several hundred political prisoners remained in jail.</p>
<p>In July 1984, another general amnesty was declared, and two years later, the government had released nearly all political prisoners. The authorities continued, however, to harass dissidents and Solidarity activists. Solidarity remained proscribed and its publications banned.  Independent publications were censored.</p>
<p>In late 1980s the government was forced to negotiate with <a href="/wiki/Solidarity" id="w">Solidarity</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Polish_Roundtable_Negotiations" id="w">Polish Roundtable Negotiations</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Polish_legislative_elections%2C_1989" id="w">Polish legislative elections, 1989</a> become one of the important events marking the <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_communism" id="w">fall of communism</a> in Poland.</p>

<a id="Third_Republic" name="Third_Republic"></a><h1>Third Republic</h1>
<p>{{main}}</p>
<p>The history of Poland from 1989 to 2007 starts with free elections which took place in Poland during 1989, when the communist administration in Central Europe was starting to disintegrate. The Hungarians destroyed part of the fence that alienated them from Austria in May of 1989 and this began a flood of unlawful migration. East Germans would &#39;vacation&#39; in Hungary and then journey on to Austria and West Germany. Budapest was disinclined to use force to discontinue the fleeing East Germans and on November 9, 1989, the wall that alienated West Berlin from East Berlin was unfolded by the East German Government in an effort to discontinue the unlawful migration by making it lawful. 1 In 1990, East Germany entered in free elections, and the communist party lost its hold on East Germany. With the breakup of the Soviet hold on European countries and the absorption of East Germany into West Germany, Russia no longer wielded the same power it did in the 1950s and &#39;60s. The fall of communism in Germany signaled an end to the Cold War. In 1990 Lech Walesa was elected President. Latest independent Poland presents strict financial troubles for its Communists because Poland underwent great changeover from Communism to Capitalism and manufacturing industry was privatized but nowadays the strong financial system is rising powerfully although joblessness ruins high portion of population. Finally Poland gained a new constitution in 1997.But,since 1989, no right-wing party won the election. Lech Kaczynski is currently ruling in this new era of 2007.</p>
