<b>Hurricane Katrina</b> was the costliest and one of the five deadliest <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" id="w">hurricanes</a> in the history of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>.<sup id="_ref-KatrinaTCR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KatrinaTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup> It was the sixth-strongest <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic</a> <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane" id="w">hurricane</a> ever recorded and the third-strongest hurricane on record that made landfall in the United States. Katrina formed on <a href="/wiki/August_23" id="w">August 23</a> during the <a href="/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season" id="w">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a> and caused devastation along much of the north-central <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States" id="w">Gulf Coast</a>. The most severe <a href="/wiki/Effect_of_Hurricane_Katrina_on_New_Orleans" id="w">loss of life and property damage</a> occurred in <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana" id="w">New Orleans</a>, <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a>, which flooded as the <a href="/wiki/Levee" id="w">levee</a> system catastrophically failed, in many cases hours after the storm had moved inland.<sup id="_ref-TPInteractive_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TPInteractive" title="">[2]</a></sup> The hurricane caused severe destruction across the entire <a href="/wiki/Mississippi" id="w">Mississippi</a> coast and into <a href="/wiki/Alabama" id="w">Alabama</a>, as far as 100&#160;miles (160&#160;km) from the storm&#39;s center. Katrina was the eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, third <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Classifications.2C terminology.2C and naming" id="w">major hurricane</a>, and second <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 5 hurricane</a> of the 2005 Atlantic season.</p>
<p>It formed over the <a href="/wiki/Bahamas" id="w">Bahamas</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_23" id="w">August 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, and crossed southern <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> as a moderate <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 1 hurricane</a>, causing some deaths and flooding there, before strengthening rapidly in the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a> and becoming one of the strongest hurricanes on record while at sea. The storm weakened before making its second and third landfalls as a <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 3</a> storm on the morning of <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a> in southeast Louisiana and at the Louisiana/Mississippi state line, respectively.</p>
<p>The storm surge caused severe damage along the Gulf Coast, devastating the Mississippi cities of <a href="/wiki/Waveland%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Waveland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bay_St._Louis%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Bay St. Louis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pass_Christian%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Pass Christian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Long_Beach%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Long Beach</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gulfport%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Gulfport</a>, <a href="/wiki/Biloxi%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Biloxi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ocean_Springs" id="w">Ocean Springs</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pascagoula%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Pascagoula</a>. In Louisiana, the <a href="/wiki/Flood_Control_Act_of_1965" id="w">federal flood protection</a> system in New Orleans failed in more than 50 places. Nearly every levee in metro New Orleans breached as Hurricane Katrina passed east of the city, subsequently flooding 80% of the city and many areas of neighboring <a href="/wiki/List_of_parishes_of_Louisiana" id="w">parishes</a> for weeks.<sup id="_ref-TPInteractive_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TPInteractive" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>At least 1,836 people lost their lives in Hurricane Katrina and in the subsequent floods, making it the deadliest U.S. hurricane since the <a href="/wiki/1928_Okeechobee_Hurricane" id="w">1928 Okeechobee Hurricane</a>. The storm is estimated to have been responsible for $81.2 billion (2005 <a href="/wiki/United_States_dollar" id="w">U.S. dollars</a>) in damage, making it the costliest natural disaster in <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_United_States" id="w">U.S. history</a>. The catastrophic failure of the flood protection in New Orleans prompted immediate review of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers" id="w">Army Corps of Engineers</a> since the agency has by <a href="/wiki/Flood_Control_Act_of_1965" id="w">congressional mandate</a> sole responsibility for design and construction of the flood protection. There was also widespread criticism of the federal, state and local governments&#39; reaction to the storm and resulting in an investigation by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" id="w">U.S. Congress</a> and the resignation of <a href="/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency" id="w">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> director <a href="/wiki/Michael_D._Brown" id="w">Michael D.

<p>Hurricane Katrina formed as Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on <a href="/wiki/August_23" id="w">August 23</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> as the result of an interaction of a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" id="w">tropical wave</a> and the remains of <a href="/wiki/List_of_2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season_storms#Tropical Depression Ten" id="w">Tropical Depression Ten</a>. The system was upgraded to <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Intensity classifications" id="w">tropical storm status</a> on the morning of <a href="/wiki/August_24" id="w">August 24</a> and at this point, the storm was given the name <i><a href="/wiki/Katrina" id="w">Katrina</a>.</i> The tropical storm continued to move towards Florida, and became a hurricane only two hours before it made <a href="/wiki/Landfall_(meteorology)" id="w">landfall</a> between <a href="/wiki/Hallandale_Beach%2C_Florida" id="w">Hallandale Beach</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aventura%2C_Florida" id="w">Aventura, Florida</a> on the morning of <a href="/wiki/August_25" id="w">August 25</a>. The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" id="w">Gulf of Mexico</a>.<sup id="_ref-KatrinaTCR_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KatrinaTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The storm <a href="/wiki/Rapid_deepening" id="w">rapidly intensified</a> after entering the Gulf, partly because of the storm&#39;s movement over the warm <a href="/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature" id="w">waters</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Loop_Current" id="w">Loop Current</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/August_27" id="w">August 27</a>, the storm reached Category 3 intensity on the <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale</a>, becoming the third <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone#Categories and ranking" id="w">major hurricane</a> of the season. An <a href="/wiki/Eyewall#Eyewall replacement cycles" id="w">eyewall replacement cycle</a> disrupted the intensification, but caused the storm to nearly double in size. Katrina again rapidly intensified, attaining Category 5 status on the morning of <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a> and reached its peak strength at 1:00 p.m. CDT that day, with maximum sustained winds of 175&#160;mph (280&#160;km/h) and a minimum central <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure" id="w">pressure</a> of 902&#160;<a href="/wiki/Bar_(unit)" id="w">mbar</a>. The pressure measurement made Katrina the fourth most intense <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane" id="w">Atlantic hurricane</a> on record at the time, only to be surpassed by Hurricanes <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Rita" id="w">Rita</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Wilma" id="w">Wilma</a> later in the season; it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico at the time (a record also later broken by <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Rita" id="w">Rita</a>).<sup id="_ref-KatrinaTCR_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KatrinaTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Katrina made its second landfall at 6:10 a.m. CDT<sup id="_ref-KatrinaTCR_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KatrinaTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup> on <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a> as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125&#160;mph (205&#160;km/h) near <a href="/wiki/Buras-Triumph%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Buras-Triumph, Louisiana</a>. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended outward 120&#160;miles (190&#160;km) from the center and the storm&#39;s central pressure was 920&#160;mbar. After moving over southeastern Louisiana and <a href="/wiki/Breton_Sound" id="w">Breton Sound</a>, it made its third landfall near the Louisiana/Mississippi border with 120&#160;mph (195&#160;km/h) sustained winds, still at Category 3 intensity.<sup id="_ref-KatrinaTCR_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KatrinaTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Katrina maintained strength well into Mississippi, finally losing hurricane strength more than 150&#160;miles (240&#160;km) inland near <a href="/wiki/Meridian%2C_Mississippi" id="w">Meridian, Mississippi</a>. It was downgraded to a tropical depression near <a href="/wiki/Clarksville%2C_Tennessee" id="w">Clarksville, Tennessee</a>, but its remnants were last distinguishable in the eastern <a href="/wiki/Great_Lakes" id="w">Great Lakes</a> region on <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>, when it was absorbed by a <a href="/wiki/Surface_weather_analysis#cold front" id="w">frontal boundary</a>.

<p>On the morning of <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a>, at 10 a.m. <a href="/wiki/Central_Daylight_Time" id="w">CDT</a> (1500&#160;<a href="/wiki/UTC" id="w">UTC</a>), Katrina had strengthened to a <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 3</a> storm in the Gulf of Mexico. Later that afternoon, the NHC realized that Katrina had yet to make the turn toward the Florida Panhandle and ended up revising the predicted track of the storm from the panhandle to the Mississippi coast.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NHC disc 014_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NHC disc 014" title="">[6]</a></sup> The NHC issued a hurricane watch for southeastern Louisiana, including the New Orleans area at 10 a.m. CDT <a href="/wiki/August_27" id="w">August 27</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard" id="w">United States Coast Guard</a> began pre-positioning resources beyond the expected impact zone starting on <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a>, and activated more than 400 reservists.<sup id="_ref-CG response_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CG response" title="">[7]</a></sup> Aircrews from the Aviation Training Center, in Mobile, staged rescue aircraft from Texas to Florida.<sup id="_ref-CG leadership_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CG leadership" title="">[8]</a></sup> All aircraft were returning back towards the Gulf of Mexico by the afternoon of <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a>, as the sheer size of Katrina became clear, the NHC extended the tropical storm warning zone to cover most of the Louisiana coastline and a larger portion of the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Panhandle" id="w">Florida Panhandle</a>.

On <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a>, the state of Mississippi activated its <a href="/wiki/United_States_National_Guard" id="w">National Guard</a> in preparation of the storm&#39;s landfall. Additionally, the state government activated its Emergency Operations Center the next day, and local governments began issuing evacuation orders. By 7:00 p.m. <a href="/wiki/EDT" id="w">EDT</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a>, 11 counties and eleven cities issued evacuation orders, a number which increased to 41 counties and 61 cities by the following morning.

Louisiana&#39;s hurricane evacuation plan calls for local governments in areas along and near the coast to evacuate in three phases, starting with the immediate coast 50 hours before the start of tropical storm force winds. Persons in areas designated Phase II begin evacuating 40 hours before the onset of tropical storm winds and those in Phase III areas (including New Orleans) evacuate 30 hours before the start of such winds.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

By <a href="/wiki/August_26" id="w">August 26</a>, the possibility of unprecedented cataclysm was already being considered. Many of the computer models had shifted the potential path of Katrina {{convert}} westward from the Florida Panhandle, putting the city of <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana" id="w">New Orleans</a> right in the center of their track probabilities; the chances of a direct hit were forecast at 17%, with strike probability rising to 29% by <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> This scenario was considered a potential catastrophe because some parts of New Orleans and the metro area are below sea level. Since the storm surge produced by the hurricane&#39;s right-front quadrant (containing the strongest winds) was forecast to be 28&#160;feet (8.5&#160;m), emergency management officials in New Orleans feared that the storm surge could go over the tops of levees protecting the city, causing major flooding.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>At a news conference at 10:00 a.m. on <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a>, shortly after Katrina was upgraded to a <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 5</a> storm, New Orleans mayor <a href="/wiki/Ray_Nagin" id="w">Ray Nagin</a> ordered the first ever <a href="/wiki/Emergency_evacuation" id="w">mandatory evacuation</a> of the city, calling Katrina &#34;a storm that most of us have long feared.&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> The city government also established several &#34;refuges of last resort&#34; for citizens who could not leave the city, including the massive <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Superdome" id="w">Louisiana Superdome</a>, which sheltered approximately 26,000 people and provided them with food and water for several days as the storm came ashore.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

<p>Many people living in the area were unaware when Katrina strengthened from a tropical storm to a hurricane in one day and struck southern <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a> near the <a href="/wiki/Miami-Dade_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Miami-Dade</a> – <a href="/wiki/Broward_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Broward</a> county line.

On <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a> Hurricane Katrina made landfall near <a href="/wiki/Buras%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Buras, Louisiana</a> with 125&#160;mph (205&#160;km/h) winds, as a strong Category 3 storm. However, as it had only just weakened from Category 4 strength and the radius of maximum winds was large, it is possible that sustained winds of Category 4 strength briefly impacted extreme southeastern Louisiana. Although the storm surge to the east of the path of the eye in <a href="/wiki/Mississippi" id="w">Mississippi</a> was higher, a very significant surge affected the Louisiana coast. The height of the surge is uncertain because of a lack of data, although a tide gauge in <a href="/wiki/Plaquemines_Parish" id="w">Plaquemines Parish</a> indicated a storm tide in excess of 14&#160;feet (4.3&#160;m) and a 12&#160;foot (3&#160;m) storm surge was recorded in <a href="/wiki/Grand_Isle%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Grand Isle</a>.<sup id="_ref-KatrinaTCR_n" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KatrinaTCR" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina also brought heavy rain to Louisiana, with 8 – 10&#160;inches (200 – 250&#160;mm) falling on a wide swath of the eastern part of the state. In the area around <a href="/wiki/Slidell%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Slidell</a>, the rainfall was even higher, and the highest rainfall recorded in the state was approximately 15&#160;inches (380&#160;mm).

As the eye of Hurricane Katrina swept to the northeast, it subjected the city to hurricane conditions for hours. Although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in New Orleans, there were a few measurements of hurricane-force winds. From this the NHC concluded that it is likely that much of the city experienced sustained winds of Category 1 or Category 2 strength.</p>
<p>Katrina&#39;s storm surge led to 53 levee breaches in the <a href="/wiki/Flood_Control_Act_of_1965" id="w">federally built levee system</a> protecting metro New Orleans.

The economic effects of the storm were far-reaching.

More specifically, the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana" id="w">New Orleans</a>, and the subsequent state of chaos in the Crescent City.<sup id="_ref-thevenot_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thevenot" title="">[42]</a></sup> The neologism <i>Katrinagate</i> was coined to refer to this controversy, and was a runner-up for &#34;2005 word of the year.&#34;<sup id="_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#_note-89" title="">[89]</a></sup></p>
<p>Within days of Katrina&#39;s <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> landfall, public debate arose about the local, state and federal governments&#39; role in the <a href="/wiki/Preparations_for_Hurricane_Katrina" id="w">preparations</a> for and response to the hurricane. <a href="/wiki/Criticism" id="w">Criticism</a> was prompted largely by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders and of residents who remained in New Orleans without <a href="/wiki/Drinking_water" id="w">water</a>, <a href="/wiki/Food" id="w">food</a> or <a href="/wiki/Shelter" id="w">shelter</a>.

Others alleged that <a href="/wiki/Race" id="w">race</a>, <a href="/wiki/Social_class" id="w">class</a>, and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response. The percentage of black victims among storm-related deaths (49%)<sup id="_ref-LaDHH_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LaDHH" title="">[90]</a></sup> was below their proportion in the area&#39;s population (approx. 60%<sup id="_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#_note-91" title="">[91]</a></sup>
).</p>
<p>The government was accused of making things worse, instead of making things better, by preventing help by others while delaying its own response. In accordance with federal law, President <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">George W. Bush</a> directed the <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_Homeland_Security" id="w">Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Chertoff" id="w">Michael Chertoff</a>, to coordinate the Federal response. Chertoff designated <a href="/wiki/Michael_D._Brown" id="w">Michael D. Brown</a>, head of the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency" id="w">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>, as the Principal Federal Official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the Gulf Coast region. However, the President and Secretary Chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination. Eight days later, Brown was recalled to Washington and Coast Guard Vice Admiral <a href="/wiki/Thad_W._Allen" id="w">Thad W. Allen</a> replaced him as chief of hurricane relief operations.<sup id="_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#_note-92" title="">[92]</a></sup> Three days after the recall, Michael D. Brown resigned as director of FEMA in spite of having received praise from Bush with the now-well-known phrase, <i>&#34;Brownie, you&#39;re doing a heck of a job.&#34;</i><sup id="_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#_note-93" title="">[93]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, during a <a href="/wiki/Benefit_concert" id="w">benefit concert</a> for Hurricane Katrina relief on <a href="/wiki/NBC" id="w">NBC</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/A_Concert_for_Hurricane_Relief" id="w">A Concert for Hurricane Relief</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Kanye_West" id="w">Kanye West</a> was a featured speaker. Controversy arose when West was presenting, as he deviated from the prepared script:</p>
<p /><blockquote><i>I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, &#39;They&#39;re looting.&#39; You see a white family, it says, &#39;They&#39;re looking for food.&#39; And, you know, it&#39;s been five days [waiting for federal help] because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about it, I would be a hypocrite because I&#39;ve tried to turn away from the teacher-the TV because it&#39;s too hard to watch. I&#39;ve even been shopping before even giving a donation, so now I&#39;m calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can give, and just to imagine if I was down there, and those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help — with the way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean, the Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another way — and they&#39;ve given them permission to go down and shoot us!</i></blockquote>

<p><a href="/wiki/Mike_Myers_(actor)" id="w">Mike Myers</a>, with whom West was paired to present, spoke next and continued as normal by reading the script. Once it was West&#39;s turn to speak again, West delivered the controversial phrase:</p>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>Although the camera quickly cut away to <a href="/wiki/Chris_Tucker" id="w">Chris Tucker</a>, West&#39;s comments still reached the East Coast broadcasts, and was replayed or discussed afterwards.</p>
<p>Kanye West and Mike Myers met again on a brief sketch on <i><a href="/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" id="w">Saturday Night Live</a></i>, in which Myers joked that since the telethon, the government has stripped him of his American citizenship (&#34;still got my Canadian citizenship to fall back on,&#34; Myers joked), and placed him under heavy government surveillance.</p>
<p>Criticism from politicians, activists, pundits and journalists of all stripes was directed at the local and state and governments headed by Mayor <a href="/wiki/Ray_Nagin" id="w">Ray Nagin</a> of New Orleans and Louisiana Governor <a href="/wiki/Kathleen_Blanco" id="w">Kathleen Blanco</a>. Nagin and Blanco were criticized for failing to implement New Orleans&#39; evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin was that he delayed his <a href="/wiki/Emergency_evacuation" id="w">emergency evacuation</a> order until 19&#160;hours before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who (by that time) could not find any way out of the city.<sup id="_ref-CongressInvestigation_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CongressInvestigation" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>According to new modeling and field observations by a team from <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_State_University" id="w">Louisiana State University</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River_Gulf_Outlet" id="w">Mississippi River Gulf Outlet</a> (MRGO), a 200-meter (660&#160;ft) wide canal designed to provide a shortcut from New Orleans to the Gulf of Mexico, helped provide a funnel for the storm surge, making it 20% higher and 100%-200% faster as it crashed into the city. St. Bernard Parish, one of the more devastated areas, lies just south of the MRGO. The <a href="/wiki/Army_Corps_of_Engineers" id="w">Army Corps of Engineers</a> disputes this causality and maintains Katrina would have overwhelmed the levees with or without the contributing effect of the MRGO.<sup id="_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#_note-114" title="">[114]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_5" id="w">April 5</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lieutenant General Carl Strock testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that &#34;We have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure.&#34;<sup id="_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#_note-115" title="">[115]</a></sup> He also testified that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not know of this mechanism of failure prior to <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>. The claim of ignorance is refuted, however, by the National Science Foundation investigators hired by the Army Corps of Engineers, who point to a 1986 study by the Corps itself that such separations were possible in the I-wall design.<sup id="_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#_note-116" title="">[116]</a></sup></p>
<p>Various <a href="/wiki/Conspiracy_theory" id="w">conspiracy theories</a> began floating around that the levees were in fact deliberately demolished. A number of New Orleans residents described hearing &#34;explosions&#34; coming from the Industrial Canal levee in the Lower 9th Ward before the floodwaters rushed in. A National Guard worker claims he was sworn to secrecy upon finding explosives residue at the site of the break.<sup id="_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#_note-117" title="">[117]</a></sup></p>

<div class="thumbcaption"><a href="/wiki/Geraldo_Rivera" id="w">Geraldo Rivera</a> reporting from the New Orleans Convention Center on <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>.</div>
Many representatives of the <a href="/wiki/News_media" id="w">news media</a> reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina became directly involved in the unfolding events, instead of simply reporting. Because of the loss of most means of communication, such as land-based and cellular telephone systems, field reporters in many cases became conduits for information between victims and authorities.</p>
<p>The authorities, who monitored local and network news broadcasts, as well as internet sites, would then attempt to coordinate rescue efforts based on the reports. One illustration was when <a href="/wiki/Geraldo_Rivera" id="w">Geraldo Rivera</a> of <a href="/wiki/Fox_News" id="w">Fox News</a> tearfully pleaded for authorities to either send help or evacuate the thousands of evacuees stranded at the <a href="/wiki/Ernest_N._Morial_Convention_Center" id="w">Ernest N. Morial Convention Center</a>.<sup id="_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#_note-118" title="">[118]</a></sup></p>
<p>The storm also brought a dramatic rise in the role of <a href="/wiki/Website" id="w">Internet sites</a> - especially <a href="/wiki/Blogging" id="w">blogging</a> and community journalism. One example was the effort of <i>NOLA.com</i>, the web affiliate of New Orleans&#39; <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times-Picayune" id="w">Times-Picayune</a></i>, which was awarded the Breaking News <a href="/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize" id="w">Pulitzer Prize</a>,<sup id="_ref-Pulitzer BN_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pulitzer BN" title="">[119]</a></sup> and shared the Public Service Pulitzer with the Biloxi-based <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sun_Herald" id="w">Sun Herald</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Pulitzer PS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pulitzer PS" title="">[120]</a></sup> The newspaper&#39;s coverage was carried for days only on NOLA&#39;s blogs, as the newspaper lost its presses and evacuated its building as water rose around it on August 30. The site became an international focal point for news by local media, and also became a vital link for rescue operations and later for reuniting scattered residents, as it accepted and posted thousands of individual pleas for rescue on its blogs and forums. NOLA was monitored constantly by an array of rescue teams - from individuals to the Coast Guard - which used information in rescue efforts. Much of this information was relayed from trapped victims via the SMS functions of their cell phones, to friends and relatives outside the area, who then relayed the information back to NOLA.com. The aggregation of community journalism, user photos and the use of the internet site as a collaborative response to the storm attracted international attention, and was called a watershed moment in journalism.<sup id="_ref-OJR NOLA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OJR NOLA" title="">[121]</a></sup> In the wake of these online-only efforts, the Pulitzer Committee for the first time opened all its categories to online entries.<sup id="_ref-Pulitzer speech_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pulitzer speech" title="">[122]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the U.S. military and rescue services regained control over the city, there were restrictions on the activity of the media. On <a href="/wiki/September_9" id="w">September 9</a>, the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have &#34;zero access&#34; to efforts to recover bodies in New Orleans. Immediately following this announcement, <a href="/wiki/CNN" id="w">CNN</a> filed a <a href="/wiki/Lawsuit" id="w">lawsuit</a> and obtained a temporary <a href="/wiki/Restraining_order" id="w">restraining order</a> against the ban. The next day the government backed down and reversed the ban.<sup id="_ref-Media Ban_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Media Ban" title="">[123]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina has also been the centerpiece of several documentary films including <a href="/wiki/Spike_Lee" id="w">Spike Lee</a>&#39;s film, <i><a href="/wiki/When_the_Levees_Broke" id="w">When the Levees Broke</a></i>, and <a href="/wiki/Darren_Martinez" id="w">Darren Martinez</a>&#39;s film, <i>Hellp</i>.<sup id="_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#_note-124" title="">[124]</a></sup></p>

Because of the large loss of life and property along the <a href="/wiki/Gulf_Coast" id="w">Gulf Coast</a>, the name Katrina was officially retired on <a href="/wiki/April_6" id="w">April 6</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> by the <a href="/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization" id="w">World Meteorological Organization</a> at the request of the U.S. government.
