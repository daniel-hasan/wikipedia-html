<p>Rhee Taekwon-Do occupies a prominent place in Australian taekwondo history.

<a id="Father_of_Australian_Taekwondo" name="Father_of_Australian_Taekwondo"></a><h3> Father of Australian Taekwondo </h3>

<p>No one has challenged Rhee&#39;s claim as the Father of Australian Taekwondo. The title might be debated, however, based on claims made about four other martial art masters:</p>

<p>Kim would have been in the lower <i>dan</i> ranks, and would not yet have held the title of Master, when he was invited to teach in Australia.

</p>
<p>Rhee Taekwon-Do <a href="/wiki/Training" id="w">training</a> consists of exercises that may be classified as: basics (group drill exercises; similar to <i><a href="/wiki/Kihon" id="w">kihon</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/Karate" id="w">karate</a>), <a href="/wiki/Breaking_(martial_arts)" id="w">destruction</a> (breaking), <a href="/wiki/Hyung" id="w">hyung</a> (patterns or forms), <a href="/wiki/Self-defence" id="w">self-defence</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sparring" id="w">sparring</a>. Basics, destruction, hyung, and self-defence are similar to equivalent exercises in other traditional martial art schools. Rhee Taekwon-Do <a href="/wiki/Sparring" id="w">sparring</a> is different to that in ITF and WTF schools, having more in common with <a href="/wiki/Kumite#Delivering_strikes" id="w">traditional karate sparring</a>.</p>
<p>Rhee Taekwon-Do sparring is unscored, unarmoured,<sup id="_ref-Sparring1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sparring1" title="">[44]</a></sup> and usually &#39;non-contact&#39; in principle. Members typically achieve non-contact sparring by two methods, whether separately or in combination:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>The attacker</b> consciously stops just short of hitting the training partner, while still executing attacks with full speed and power.<sup id="_ref-Sparring1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sparring1" title="">[44]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Sparring2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sparring2" title="">[45]</a></sup> The attacker has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs when one training partner has more experience than the other.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><b>The defender</b> actively avoids or blocks an incoming attack executed by the training partner.<sup id="_ref-Sparring3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sparring3" title="">[46]</a></sup> The defender has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs with training partners of similar experience.</li></ul>

</p>
<p>Rhee Taekwon-Do <a href="/wiki/Rank" id="w">ranks</a> are denoted by coloured belts, which indicate a member&#39;s level of experience and responsibility within the school.

<p>Members start with white belts and progress through yellow, green, blue, brown, and then black. &#39;Tips&#39; denoting odd-numbered <i>kup</i> ranks are marked by a stripe of the higher colour near the right end (from the wearer&#39;s point of view) of a belt of the lower colour. <i>Dan</i> ranks are represented by a white bars embroidered on a black belt. A black belt with no bars is a Junior Black Belt, a rank assigned to members considered too young for 1st <i>dan</i>.</p>
<p>To attain Rhee Taekwon-Do 1st <i>dan</i> ranking typically takes around five years of regular training.

{{note}} While discussing the introduction of taekwondo to Malaysia and Singapore, Ki Ha Rhee noted that Choi had instructed him to bring another instructor with him. Almost certainly referring to C. H. Rhee, he added, &#34;That&#39;s why I took the brother of Rhee Chong Chul—from Rhee International—he was the first to graduate so he came to Malaysia then I brought him to Singapore&#34; (p. 52).<sup id="_ref-KHRhee_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KHRhee" title="">[54]</a></sup>

{{note}} The Korean striking art taught by Kim, Rozinsky, and No in the 1960s was described as tang soo do<sup id="_ref-Kim-Rozinsky_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kim-Rozinsky" title="">[10]</a></sup> or Korean karate,<sup id="_ref-Kim1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kim1" title="">[11]</a></sup> and not as taekwondo. It is a matter of interpretation whether the art should be called taekwondo retrospectively. The Shuto Karate Club (founded by Rozinsky in 1963)<sup id="_ref-Rozinsky1_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rozinsky1" title="">[13]</a></sup> later became the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre, and tang soo do was one of the arts taught there. Rhee was the first to use the name &#34;taekwondo&#34; officially in Australia.
