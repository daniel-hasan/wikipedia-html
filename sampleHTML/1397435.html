<p><b>Christopher Woodhead</b> (born <a href="/wiki/1947" id="w">1947</a>) was the <a href="/wiki/Chief_Inspector_of_Schools" id="w">Chief Inspector of Schools</a> in <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a> from <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a> until <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a> and is one of the most controversial figures in debates on the direction of <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">English</a> education policy<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup>.  He is currently the Chairman of <a class="externallink" href="http://www.cognitaschools.co.uk/index.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cognitaschools.co.uk/index.php">Cognita</a>, a company dedicated to fostering private education.</p>
<p>A graduate of English from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Bristol" id="w">University of Bristol</a>, Woodhead worked as a teacher for several years before moving into teacher education. He became a lecturer at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" id="w">University of Oxford</a> and held a number of posts in education development, including Deputy Chief Education Officer in <a href="/wiki/Devon" id="w">Devon</a> in <a href="/wiki/1989" id="w">1989</a>.  Woodhead then held a number of national posts, culminating in his appointment as head of the <a href="/wiki/Office_for_Standards_in_Education" id="w">Office for Standards in Education</a> (OFSTED), the schools inspection service, in <a href="/wiki/1994" id="w">1994</a>.</p>
<p>Woodhead is particularly associated with support for &#34;traditional teaching methods&#34; and for taking a scornful view of &#34;progressive educational theories&#34; introduced into English schools from the <a href="/wiki/1960s" id="w">1960s</a> onwards. Supporters claimed that Woodhead was a radical reformer willing to tackle the failings of the education system and only encountering the defensiveness of the educational establishment. Critics argued that he was generating poor morale, rarely identified successes in schools, and that the &#34;progressive teaching&#34; he attacked was a <a href="/wiki/Straw_man" id="w">straw man</a>, with little resemblance to actual classroom practices.  Woodhead most prominently identified weaknesses in schools with poor teaching and repeatedly asserted this view. Amongst his controversial remarks he claimed there were &#34;15,000 incompetent teachers&#34; and &#34;I am paid to challenge mediocrity, failure and complacency&#34;.  His blunt approach gained him many enemies, especially in the teaching profession.  </p>
<p>When the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" id="w">Labour</a> government came to power in <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a> there was much political pressure to replace Woodhead, either immediately or when his initial term expired in <a href="/wiki/1998" id="w">1998</a>, but instead he was retained and his appointment renewed by <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education_and_Skills" id="w">Education Secretary</a> <a href="/wiki/David_Blunkett" id="w">David Blunkett</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1999" id="w">1999</a> Woodhead came under immense pressure to resign when it was claimed by his ex-wife that whilst working as a teacher he had had an affair with a pupil<a class="externallink" href="http://www.thisisoxfordshire.co.uk/oxfordshire/archive/1999/04/16/FEATURES0VQ.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.thisisoxfordshire.co.uk/oxfordshire/archive/1999/04/16/FEATURES0VQ.html">http://www.thisisoxfordshire.co.uk/oxfordshire/archive/1999/04/16/FEATURES0VQ.html</a>, however he stood firm with the support of Blunkett.  Woodhead and Amanda Johnston, the pupil concerned, insisted that although they had met while he was her teacher, the relationship (which lasted for nine years) had only developed several years after they had both left the school.  In February 1999 Woodhead addressed an audience of trainee teachers and was asked for his views on legislation to ban sexual relationships between pupils and teachers.  His response was that such relationships, while regrettable, could be &#34;experiential and educative on both sides&#34;<a class="externallink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/273662.stm" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/273662.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/273662.stm</a>, a remark for which he later apologised.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/November_2" id="w">November 2</a> <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a> Woodhead announced his resignation, to much rejoicing amongst the teaching unions. He was employed as a columnist for the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Telegraph" id="w">Daily Telegraph</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sunday_Times_(UK)" id="w">The Sunday Times</a></i> newspapers. Subsequently he stated that he felt the school-inspection system was now in a strong position and that he &#34;felt unable to defend some aspects of government policy.&#34; <a class="externallink" href="http://www.readersdigest.co.uk/magazine/woodhead.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.readersdigest.co.uk/magazine/woodhead.htm">http://www.readersdigest.co.uk/magazine/woodhead.htm</a>  In <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a> he was appointed a Professor of Education at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Buckingham" id="w">University of Buckingham</a>. He continues to speak out in public on many issues relating to education at both school and university level, often provoking great controversy.  In <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a> Woodhead became chairmain of <a href="/wiki/Cognita" id="w">Cognita</a>, a company that owns and runs independent schools. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.cognitaschools.co.uk/chris-woodhead.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cognitaschools.co.uk/chris-woodhead.php">http://www.cognitaschools.co.uk/chris-woodhead.php</a></p>
<p>In February <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" id="w">The Guardian</a></i> obtained information<a class="externallink" href="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Education/documents/2005/02/03/minute.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Education/documents/2005/02/03/minute.pdf">http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Education/documents/2005/02/03/minute.pdf</a> using the UK <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_Kingdom)" id="w">Freedom of Information Act</a>, which confirmed that in 1997 Woodhead had overruled a unanimous decision by his own inspectors, and a subsequent inspection visit by HMI inspectors, in order to declare that Islington Green school was failing and required special measures<a class="externallink" href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,1405710,00.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,1405710,00.html">http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,1405710,00.html</a>. According to the head of the school at the time, &#34;the consequences for staff and pupils were catastrophic.&#34; Despite Woodhead&#39;s enthusiasm for evidence-based inspection, he has never made public the reasons for this decision.</p>
