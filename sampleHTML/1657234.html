He was captured while fighting against American forces in <a href="/wiki/Afghanistan" id="w">Afghanistan</a> when he was 15 years of age.<sup id="_ref-DoDList2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DoDList2" title="">[1]</a></sup> 
His case has drawn considerable attention as a <a href="/wiki/Child_soldier" id="w">child soldier</a>, and he is among the youngest prisoners held in <a href="/wiki/Extrajudicial_punishment" id="w">extrajudicial detention</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Guant%C3%A1namo_Bay_detainment_camp" id="w">Guantánamo Bay detainment camps</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Cuba" id="w">Cuba</a>, and the only <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canadian</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/2007-06-04" id="w">2007-06-04</a>, a military court dismissed all charges against Khadr because of a procedural flaw - the court was authorized to try <a href="/wiki/Unlawful_enemy_combatant" id="w">unlawful enemy combatants</a>, but an earlier review had labelled Khadr as merely an &#34;<a href="/wiki/Enemy_combatant" id="w">enemy combatant</a>&#34;<sup id="_ref-MiamiHerald20070604_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MiamiHerald20070604" title="">[2]</a></sup>.  On <a href="/wiki/2007-09-24" id="w">2007-09-24</a>, a military court ruled that the dismissal was in error.

<a id="Life_in_Canada" name="Life_in_Canada"></a><h1> Life in Canada </h1>
<p>Omar Khadr, like most of the children in the <a href="/wiki/Khadr_family" id="w">Khadr family</a>, was born in <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, and both parents were Canadian citizens.  Through <a href="/wiki/1985" id="w">1985</a> to <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a> mostly the family was living in <a href="/wiki/Peshawar" id="w">Peshawar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" id="w">Pakistan</a>, where the father <a href="/wiki/Ahmed_Said_Khadr" id="w">Ahmed Said Khadr</a> was working, they visited Canada on a 1-2 year basis.<sup id="_ref-GoodSon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GoodSon" title="">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 1992 Ahmed Said Khadr was wounded by a land-mine, and spent a year back in Canada recovering his health.</p>
<a id="Life_in_bin_Laden's_compound" name="Life_in_bin_Laden's_compound"></a><h1> Life in bin Laden&#39;s compound </h1>
<p>Khadr&#39;s father moved his family to Afghanistan in <a href="/wiki/1997" id="w">1997</a>, where they lived in their office compound. They later moved to bin Laden&#39;s compound but only after it had been evacuated. During their stay in their office the family visited the bin Laden compound occasionaly and the children played with his children amongst others.<sup id="_ref-SonofAlQaeda_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SonofAlQaeda" title="">[5]</a></sup>  Khadr&#39;s father has been described as one of bin Laden&#39;s senior lieutenants.</p>
<p>Omar&#39;s older brother <a href="/wiki/Abdurahman_Khadr" id="w">Abdurahman Khadr</a> described being sent to military training camps shortly after his arrival, when he was just eleven years old.  All of the Khadr boys are believed to have military training while they were  children.</p>
<a id="Capture" name="Capture"></a><h1> Capture </h1>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/2002-07-22" id="w">2002-07-22</a>, 15-year-old Khadr was in a compound near <a href="/wiki/Khost" id="w">Khost</a> that was surrounded by US special forces.  According to Master Sgt Scotty Hansen of Utah, &#34;we [sent] a couple of Afghan interpreters to go in and talk to them because we didn&#39;t want to be storm troopers unless we had to.&#34;  The two interpreters were shot &#34;point blank in the face,&#34; however, according to Sergeant <a href="/wiki/Layne_Morris" id="w">Layne Morris</a>, after which &#34;all heck broke out,&#34; according to Hansen<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup>.  Sergeant <a href="/wiki/Layne_Morris" id="w">Layne Morris</a> was injured early in the skirmish.  The Americans called in a devasting air strike, such that no survivors were expected.  Khadr, however, survived and allegedly threw a grenade, which injured Sgt. <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Speer" id="w">Christopher Speer</a> and led to his death, and injured three other members of the squad.<sup id="_ref-GoodSon_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GoodSon" title="">[4]</a></sup> 
Omar was shot three times, and left nearly blind in one eye. He received medical treatment for the gunshot wounds upon being captured.</p>
<a id="Accusations_against_Khadr" name="Accusations_against_Khadr"></a><h1> Accusations against Khadr </h1>

<p>In addition to being charged with the murder of Sgt.

<p>There were other child detainees incarcerated at Guantánamo Bay.  Three of them were kept in a smaller compound, <a href="/wiki/Camp_Iguana" id="w">Camp Iguana</a>, where they were allegedly treated humanely.  They were not required to wear the orange coveralls.  They were provided with school teachers, and recreation.  The BBC interviewed one 13-year-old child detainee upon his return to Afghanistan.  He had learned to read at Camp Iguana.  The two years he spent there were the only education he had ever had, and he reported being sorry to leave.  </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Elaine_Chao" id="w">Elaine Chao</a> the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Labor" id="w">United States Secretary of Labor</a> has spoken about the responsibility to give child soldiers special treatment, to provide help for them to re-integrate into society.<sup id="_ref-ChildSoldiers_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ChildSoldiers" title="">[9]</a></sup>  She announced a $3 million program to help re-integrate child-soldiers in Afghanistan back into Afghan society.</p>
<p>However, Khadr was treated as an adult.  Khadr has been reported to have been kept in solitary confinement, for long periods of time; to have been denied adequate medical treatment; to have been subjected to <i>&#34;<a href="/wiki/Short_shackling" id="w">short shackling</a>&#34;</i> , and left bound, in uncomfortable <i>&#34;<a href="/wiki/Stress_position" id="w">stress positions</a>&#34;</i> until he soiled himself.<sup id="_ref-AmnestyInternationalCase8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AmnestyInternationalCase8" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Ctv200602110_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ctv200602110" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Crin20070611_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Crin20070611" title="">[12]</a></sup>
In a press conference on <a href="/wiki/2005-01-16" id="w">2005-01-16</a>, Khadr&#39;s lawyers described how Khadr&#39;s captors took Khadr&#39;s still bound body and wiped his hair and clothes in his urine and feces.<sup id="_ref-Cbc20060710_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cbc20060710" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

During this press conference he asserted that Khadr, and two other youths, were incarcerated separately from adults, and were provided with daily lessons:
</p><blockquote>Del Monte said that those in charge of the Guantanamo detention camp provide the three youngsters with lessons every morning in Mathematics, English, Sciences, and other subjects for their mental and psychological needs in addition to teaching physical fitness and sports.</blockquote>

<p>Del Monte&#39;s assertion stands in contrast to the other accounts of Khadr&#39;s incarceration, where he has been described as leading the prayer sessions of the other detainees in his cell block.</p>

Omar Khadr&#39;s brother <a href="/wiki/Abdurahman_Khadr" id="w">Abdurahman Khadr</a> claimed in the documentary <a href="/wiki/Son_of_al_Qaeda" id="w">Son of al Qaeda</a> that he talked with Omar over a fence in 2003.

In or about June 2002, Khadr received approximately one month of one-on-one, private al Qaeda basic training from an al Qaeda member named “Abu Haddi.”  This training was arranged by Omar Khadr’s father, Ahmad Sa’id Khadr, and consisted of training in the use of rocket propelled grenades, rifles, pistols, hand grenades, and explosives.
b.	In or about June 2002, Khadr conducted surveillance and reconnaissance against the U.S. military in support of efforts to target U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

d.	In or about July 2002, Khadr joined a group of Al Qaeda operatives and converted land mines to improvised explosive devices and planted said improvised explosive devices in the ground where, based on previous surveillance, U.S. troops were expected to be traveling.
e.	On or about <a href="/wiki/2002-07-27" id="w">2002-07-27</a>, near the village of Ayub Kheil, Afghanistan, U.S. forces surrounded a compound housing suspected al Qaeda members.

Khadr and/or the ther suspected al Qaeda members also threw and/or fired grenades at nearby coalition forces resulting in numerous injuries.
f.	When U.S. forces entered the compound upon completion of the firefight, Khadr threw a grenade, killing Sergeant First Class Christopher Speer.</p>
