<p>As the first studio album from the group in fourteen years, <i>Time on Earth</i> has been subject to much speculation. Upon its release garnered positive critical reception and reached Platinum status with weeks of release in Australia,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> and Gold status in its second week of release in <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a>.<sup id="_ref-nzchart_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nzchart" title="">[3]</a></sup> In conjunction and promotion of the album, the group is currently touring internationally, which was begun by performing at <a href="/wiki/Coachella" id="w">Coachella</a> music festival and at <a href="/wiki/Live_Earth" id="w">Live Earth</a> in July. For further promotion, two singles have been released from the album, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Don%26%2339%3Bt_Stop_Now" id="w">Don&#39;t Stop Now</a>&#34;, &#34;<a href="/wiki/She_Called_Up" id="w">She Called Up</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Pour_Le_Monde" id="w">Pour Le Monde</a>&#34;, and a special tour edition of the album was released in Australia in <a href="/wiki/November_2007" id="w">November 2007</a> featuring an extra CD with eleven songs from a concert from the album&#39;s <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North American</a> tour.</p>
<a id="Album_history" name="Album_history"></a><h1>Album history</h1>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h2>Background</h2>
<p>The album was originally intended to be frontman <a href="/wiki/Neil_Finn" id="w">Neil Finn</a>&#39;s third solo release.  In the wake of Paul Hester&#39;s death, as well as preparations for the release of the live album <i><a href="/wiki/Farewell_to_the_World" id="w">Farewell to the World</a></i>, the band members were drawn together and their friendship was reinvigorated.  In 2006, Neil Finn invited bassist <a href="/wiki/Nick_Seymour" id="w">Nick Seymour</a> to participate in the recording of his new album and subsequent tour. In the initial phase, various session musicians filled parts, such as studio musician <a href="/wiki/Joey_Waronker" id="w">Joey Waronker</a> on drums and British soul singer <a href="/wiki/Beth_Rowley" id="w">Beth Rowley</a> provided backup vocals for the song &#34;Transit Lounge.&#34; After recording a complete album with Ethan Johns in the producer and drummer&#39;s seat and Seymour contributing substantially throughout the process, Finn decided Crowded House would reform and that <i>Time on Earth</i> would be the band&#39;s fifth studio album. The title <i>Time on Earth</i> takes its name from a song of the same name that was not included in the album.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-toe credits_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-toe credits" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>With new drummer <a href="/wiki/Matt_Sherrod" id="w">Matt Sherrod</a> and returning multi-instrumentalist <a href="/wiki/Mark_Hart" id="w">Mark Hart</a> now involved as members of the official lineup, the band returned to the studio to record four additional tracks with producer Steve Lillywhite. Hart and Sherrod also contributed retroactively to some of the Ethan Johns-produced material.  In its final form, the album features tracks mixed by Johns, Lillywhite and <a href="/wiki/Tchad_Blake" id="w">Tchad Blake</a>. Guitarist <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Marr" id="w">Johnny Marr</a> was involved in the recording of &#34;Even a Child&#34;, which he co-wrote, and &#34;Don&#39;t Stop Now&#34;.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-toe credits_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-toe credits" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Recording_and_production" name="Recording_and_production"></a><h2>Recording and production</h2>
<p>Due to the transient nature of the album, gradually adapting from a solo venture into a band effort, the recording process used was somewhat unorthodox in that it encompassed various session musicians for the majority, while the &#34;central lineup&#34; of Finn, Seymour, Hart and Sherrod only performed on four tracks, which includes &#34;<a href="/wiki/Don%26%2339%3Bt_Stop_Now" id="w">Don&#39;t Stop Now</a>&#34;, the album&#39;s lead single, and &#34;<a href="/wiki/She_Called_Up" id="w">She Called Up</a>&#34;, the following single. Before this point, most of the album was produced by <a href="/wiki/Ethan_Johns" id="w">Ethan Johns</a>, however from enlisting Sherrod and calling upon Hart to return, the prolific producer <a href="/wiki/Steve_Lillywhite" id="w">Steve Lillywhite</a> took over.<sup id="_ref-toe credits_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-toe credits" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Release" name="Release"></a><h2>Release</h2>
<p>To bring their music to the public before the album&#39;s release, the group played together a few times before the release. On <a href="/wiki/17_March" id="w">17 March</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a> the band played a 2 Â½ hour set streamed live to the internet from veteran musician <a href="/wiki/Peter_Gabriel" id="w">Peter Gabriel</a>&#39;s studio (<a href="/wiki/Real_World_Studios" id="w">Real World Studios</a>) in England. In this performance, there were eight new songs featured, beginning with Finn&#39;s co-written piece with the <a href="/wiki/Dixie_Chicks" id="w">Dixie Chicks</a> &#34;<a href="/wiki/Silent_House" id="w">Silent House</a>&#34; and also included &#34;Pour Le Monde&#34; (<a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">&#34;For the world&#34;</a>), &#34;Transit Lounge&#34;, &#34;<a href="/wiki/She_Called_Up" id="w">She Called Up</a>&#34; and &#34;<a href="/wiki/Don%26%2339%3Bt_Stop_Now" id="w">Don&#39;t Stop Now</a>&#34;.</p>
<p>To also pre-empt the album&#39;s release, a single was released. The song &#34;<a href="/wiki/Don%26%2339%3Bt_Stop_Now" id="w">Don&#39;t Stop Now</a>&#34; was selected, as it featured the new lineup of the band. The single received moderate success in the charts. The follow-up single, &#34;<a href="/wiki/She_Called_Up" id="w">She Called Up</a>&#34;, released in <a href="/wiki/September_2007" id="w">September 2007</a>, was not as successful as &#34;Don&#39;t Stop Now&#34;.</p>
<p>The album had a staggered release internationally across a fortnight, beginning in Australia, while the final location of its release was with the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. Following the Australian release, the group performed at <a href="/wiki/Live_Earth" id="w">Live Earth</a> in Australia, performing many of the album&#39;s songs, and also on various television programs, along with many interviews, such as on <i><a href="/wiki/Rove_(TV_series)" id="w">Rove</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Enough_Rope" id="w">Enough Rope</a></i> with <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Denton" id="w">Andrew Denton</a>. A special live version of Crowded House performing &#34;<a href="/wiki/Silent_House" id="w">Silent House</a>&#34; was made available for Australian and UK purchasers of the album by inserting the disc into their computer and downloading the song from the internet. The song features the advertised album lineup, including new drummer <a href="/wiki/Matt_Sherrod" id="w">Matt Sherrod</a> and returning member of Crowded House <a href="/wiki/Mark_Hart" id="w">Mark Hart</a>, neither of whom were on the studio version.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-toe credits_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-toe credits" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Critical_reception" name="Critical_reception"></a><h2>Critical reception</h2>
<p>The album has been very well received by critics and the public, with many critics praising the album as &#34;a worthy successor to Crowded House&#39;s existing catalog&#34;.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Some reviews have indicated that the album has its flaws, though these are easily dismissed due to the album&#39;s other qualities &#34;<i>[Time on Earth]</i> is not perfect. Like Woodface, at nearly an hour long and weighed down by a few too many mid-tempo tracks, Time on Earth gets a little out of the band&#39;s control. &#34;Transit Lounge&#34; features a distracting turn from singer Beth Rowley, while the nostalgic Old Country tribute &#34;English Trees&#34; probably would have worked better with brother Tim... Finn&#39;s forte has always been as a songwriter first and foremost, not a pretentious album-length crafter of grand cohesive statements or conveyor of didactic meaning. He writes deeply personal pop songs with oblique lyrics and deceptively tricky melodies, but no matter who (or what) Finn is mourning, he leaves it up to the listener to make it all fit.&#34;<sup id="_ref-pitch_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pitch" title="">[1]</a></sup> Some reviewers indicate that in &#34;Text, context and subtext, Hester&#39;s passing seems to color every line&#34;, indicating the album clearly articulates Finn&#39;s grief for Hester&#39;s death in 2005.<sup id="_ref-av_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-av" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Musical_style" name="Musical_style"></a><h1>Musical style</h1>
<p>According to Neil Finn, &#34;It (<i>Time on Earth</i>) doesn&#39;t sound like any one particular Crowded House album, but it has elements of Crowded House... in as much as Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. I think there&#39;s a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and best way to do that was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be.&#34;<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Crowded House&#39;s leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different to Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that &#34;fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically&#34;.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> Finn has said of the song &#34;People Are Like Suns&#34;, that &#34;Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, I was reading <a href="/wiki/Ian_McEwan" id="w">Ian McEwan</a>&#39;s novel <i><a href="/wiki/Saturday_(novel)" id="w">Saturday</a></i>, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image.&#34;<sup id="_ref-uncutmag_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uncutmag" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The song &#34;Pour le Monde&#34; (which means &#34;For the World&#34; in the <a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French language</a>) was inspired when Finn was in Paris and observed a demonstration march protesting against the <a href="/wiki/War_on_terror" id="w">war on terror</a>, with the chant &#34;Pour le monde pas pour la guerre&#34;, which translates to &#34;For the world, not for the war&#34; (which is then sung in English directly after the French on the song).<sup id="_ref-plm_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-plm" title="">[15]</a></sup> Seymour adds that the song contains &#34;a lot of nobility and integrity&#34; and that when they have performed the song it &#34;really does stand upright&#34;.<sup id="_ref-chtoe_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chtoe" title="">[16]</a></sup> The last song recorded for the album, &#34;Transit Lounge&#34;, is written about time spent in various transit lounges around the world, particularly <a href="/wiki/Singapore" id="w">Singapore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bangkok" id="w">Bangkok</a>.<sup id="_ref-chtoe_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chtoe" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lyrically, Andy Strickland of <a href="/wiki/Yahoo!_Music" id="w">Yahoo! Music</a> asserts that the album&#39;s song &#34;English Trees&#34; shows Finn&#39;s &#34;brilliant weaving of a tale of loss and yearning marks him out as up there with the very best songwriters working today&#34; and of the album&#39;s musical structure as a whole, comments that it is a &#34;collection of songs that reflect Finn&#39;s usual palette of singalong pop (&#34;She Called Up&#34;), achingly fine ballads (&#34;Pour Le Monde&#34;), and darker, more ambient sounds (&#34;A Sigh&#34;)&#34;.<sup id="_ref-yahoo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-yahoo" title="">[17]</a></sup> Jessica Letkemann of <a href="/wiki/Billboard" id="w">Billboard</a> points out that to those unfamiliar with Finn&#39;s solo work expecting the album to resemble a prior Crowded House work would be surprised, insisting that &#34;Gone are the more overtly &#39;80s top 40 flourishes&#34;.<sup id="_ref-bb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bb" title="">[18]</a></sup> Bud Scoppa writes in <i><a href="/wiki/Uncut_(magazine)" id="w">Uncut Magazine</a></i> that the album&#39;s extremes are portrayed in its first two songs, &#34;Nobody Wants To&#34;, which he describes as &#34;[setting] the prevailing melancholy mood, as Finnâs slide guitar hovers like a solitary seabird over a vocal laced with regret&#34;, and &#34;Don&#39;t Stop Now&#34;, in which &#34;Finn explores the metaphorical possibilities of the GPS, seeking <i>âsomething I can write aboutâ¦ something I can cry aboutâ</i>&#34;.<sup id="_ref-uncut_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-uncut" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
