<p><b><a href="/wiki/Royal_Ordnance_Factory" id="w">Royal Ordnance Factory</a> (ROF) Elstow</b> was one of sixteen <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">UK</a> <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Supply_(United_Kingdom)" id="w">Ministry of Supply</a>, <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, <a href="/wiki/Filling_Factories" id="w">Filling Factories</a>. It was a medium-sized filling factory, (Filling Factory No. 16), which filled and packed <a href="/wiki/Munition" id="w">munitions</a>. It was located south of the <a href="/wiki/Town" id="w">town</a> of <a href="/wiki/Bedford" id="w">Bedford</a>, between the villages of <a href="/wiki/Elstow" id="w">Elstow</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wilstead" id="w">Wilstead</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bedfordshire" id="w">Bedfordshire</a>. It was bounded on the northeast by the <a href="/wiki/A6_road" id="w">A6</a> and on the west by a railway line. <a href="/wiki/Hostel" id="w">Hostels</a> were built nearby to  accommodate the workers who were mostly <a href="/wiki/Female_roles_in_the_World_Wars" id="w">female</a>.</p>
<p>It was built with the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Works" id="w">Ministry of Works</a> acting as <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Agent">Agents</a>; building work started in November <a href="/wiki/1940" id="w">1940</a> and was completed by August <a href="/wiki/1941" id="w">1941</a>. It was managed as an &#34;Agency Factory&#34; by <a href="/wiki/J._Lyons" id="w">J. Lyons</a> on behalf of the Ministry of Supply as, by then, the Ministry of Supply was overstretched in regards recruiting and managing the workers needed to staff these munitions factories.</p>
<p>It had 250 buildings and 15 miles of <a href="/wiki/Standard_gauge" id="w">standard gauge</a> railway lines. It was linked to the <a href="/wiki/Midland_Railway" id="w">Midland Railway</a> line running between <a href="/wiki/London" id="w">London</a> and Bedford.</p>

<p>ROF Elstow started filling munitions in February <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a>.</p>
<p>It was divided into a number of different filling <i>Groups</i> (see <a href="/wiki/Filling_Factories" id="w">Filling Factories</a>) which occupied different areas of the site. The Groups filled cartridges, high-explosive (HE) and 4,000-pound <a href="/wiki/Bomb" id="w">bombs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shell_(projectile)" id="w">shells</a>. Later larger 8,000-pound, 12,000-pound and 22,000-pound bombs were also filled.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Cordite" id="w">Cordite</a> Group opened in June <a href="/wiki/1942" id="w">1942</a> and closed in May <a href="/wiki/1943" id="w">1943</a>; it was then employed to recondition shells. The Pellet Group also closed in 1943. After 1943 Elstow was used to store surplus ammunition components and <a href="/wiki/Machine_tools" id="w">machine tools</a>.</p>

<p>ROF Elstow closed in 1946. The <a href="/wiki/CEGB" id="w">CEGB</a> took over the site in 1969 with the intention of building a <a href="/wiki/Power_station" id="w">power station</a> but this never came to fruition.</p>
<p>In the early <a href="/wiki/1980s" id="w">1980s</a> Elstow was proposed as a site for a UK nuclear waste repository. In 2007 work began on the new town of <a href="/wiki/Wixams" id="w">Wixams</a> on the site.</p>
