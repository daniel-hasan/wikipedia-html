{{General CVG character}}
<b>Master Chief Petty Officer John-117</b>, commonly called <b>Master Chief</b>, is the protagonist of the fictional <a href="/wiki/Halo_universe" id="w">&#39;&#39;Halo&#39;&#39; universe</a>, created by <a href="/wiki/Bungie_Studios" id="w">Bungie Studios</a>, and is a <a href="/wiki/Player_character" id="w">player character</a> in the trilogy of science fiction <a href="/wiki/First-person_shooter" id="w">first-person shooter</a> <a href="/wiki/Video_game" id="w">video games</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved" id="w">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></i>,  <i><a href="/wiki/Halo_2" id="w">Halo 2</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Halo_3" id="w">Halo 3</a></i>. Outside of video games, the Master Chief appears in the novels <i><a href="/wiki/Halo:_The_Fall_of_Reach" id="w">Halo: The Fall of Reach</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Halo:_The_Flood" id="w">Halo: The Flood</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Halo:_First_Strike" id="w">Halo: First Strike</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Halo:_Uprising" id="w">Halo: Uprising</a></i>, and has cameos in <i><a href="/wiki/Halo:_Ghosts_of_Onyx" id="w">Halo: Ghosts of Onyx</a></i> and the <i><a href="/wiki/Halo_Graphic_Novel" id="w">Halo Graphic Novel</a></i>. He is voiced by Chicago <a href="/wiki/Disc_jockey" id="w">disc jockey</a> <a href="/wiki/Steve_Downes" id="w">Steve Downes</a> in the video games in which he appears.</p>
<p>The Master Chief is one of the most visible symbols of the <a href="/wiki/Halo_(series)" id="w">&#39;&#39;Halo&#39;&#39; series</a>. Originally designed by Marcus Lehto, Rob McLees, and Shi Kai Wang, the character is a towering and faceless <a href="/wiki/Cybernetics" id="w">cybernetically</a> enhanced supersoldier; he is never seen without his armor or helmet. The character has been called an icon, a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters, such as <a href="/wiki/Mario" id="w">Mario</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(character)" id="w">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lara_Croft" id="w">Lara Croft</a>.<sup id="_ref-businessweek_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-businessweek" title="">[1]</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly" id="w">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a></i> named the Master Chief as the eighth greatest video game character ever. Conversely, the Chief&#39;s silent nature during gameplay has led to criticisms that the character is one-dimensional and unbelievable.</p>

The task of developing the Master Chief for the character&#39;s first appearance in <i><a href="/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved" id="w">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></i> fell on Rob McLees and the project&#39;s Art Director, Marcus Lehto. Eventually, Shi Kai Wang was hired for conceptual art.<sup id="_ref-aoh20_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aoh20" title="">[2]</a></sup> One of Wang&#39;s sketches was accepted and became the basis for the Master Chief. However, after Wang&#39;s version was converted to a 3-D model, it was decided the character looked too slender, &#34;almost effeminate&#34;.<sup id="_ref-aoh20_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aoh20" title="">[2]</a></sup> The Master Chief was subsequently bulked up to the version currently found in the games.<sup id="_ref-aoh20_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-aoh20" title="">[2]</a></sup> Similarly, the Chief&#39;s armor went through various changes, such as the addition of an antenna, which was removed later in development, and a green tint.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In an interview on creating believable video game characters, Bungie&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Staten" id="w">Joseph Staten</a> noted that, until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not considered how to immerse people in the world of <i>Halo</i>. &#34;Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity,&#34; he said, &#34;in terms of how people react to him. He&#39;s a space marine in really cool green armor.&#34;<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Steve_Downes" id="w">Steve Downes</a>, who voices the Master Chief, is a disc jockey and voice actor who had never played video games before <i>Halo</i>.<sup id="_ref-interview1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview1" title="">[5]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Martin_O%26%2339%3BDonnell" id="w">Martin O&#39;Donnell</a>, Bungie&#39;s music director, had worked with Downes on a previous video game, <i><a href="/wiki/Septerra_Core:_Legacy_of_the_Creator" id="w">Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator</a></i>, and recommended him for the part.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> Downes has never appeared at Bungie or Microsoft events, and believes that the Master Chief is left masked because &#34;[the character&#39;s identity] is really in the eye of the player&#34;.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Personality" name="Personality"></a><h3>Personality</h3>
<p>Steve Downes said that his voice acting was based entirely on Bungie&#39;s written character description provided , which specified a character similar to <a href="/wiki/Clint_Eastwood" id="w">Clint Eastwood</a> and of few words. In a <a href="/wiki/Podcast" id="w">podcast</a> interview, the actor noted that, during the recording, he was given a fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief&#39;s personality.<sup id="_ref-interview1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-interview1" title="">[5]</a></sup> In the games, the Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him almost a <a href="/wiki/Silent_protagonist" id="w">silent protagonist</a>. Even during cutscenes, the character generally speaks sparingly. Bungie Studios&#39; Frank O&#39;Connor has described the Chief as &#34;so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they&#39;re the Chief. The player gets to inhabit those shoes [and] apply their own personality.&#34;<sup id="_ref-frank_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-frank" title="">[8]</a></sup>  Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described the Master Chief as &#34;pretty much the consummate professional.  He does his job, walks off, doesn&#39;t even get the girl, he&#39;s that cool he doesn&#39;t need her.&#34;<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Although the Master Chief is usually depicted as calm, quiet, and wryly cynical, some reviewers stated that Eric Nylund&#39;s portrayal of the character in <i><a href="/wiki/Halo:_The_Fall_of_Reach" id="w">Halo: The Fall of Reach</a></i> deviates significantly from the treatment found in the games and other media.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Entirely encased in heavy armor and standing seven feet tall, the Chief inspires awe and terror in friends and foes alike.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> Despite his cold exterior, Master Chief cares about his fellow soldiers, especially the Spartan-IIs with whom he has trained.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> At one point, the Master Chief risks injury in a massive explosion to save a fellow Spartan,<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> and withholds some combat information on the threat of the <a href="/wiki/Flood_(Halo)" id="w">Flood</a>, an alien parasite, after realizing that its disclosure would mean the death of <a href="/wiki/Sergeant_Major_A.J._Johnson" id="w">Sergeant Avery Johnson</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>During his training, the Master Chief is taught by <a href="/wiki/Chief_Petty_Officer" id="w">Chief Petty Officer</a> <a href="/wiki/List_of_Halo_characters#Franklin Mendez" id="w">Franklin Mendez</a> to sacrifice lives only when necessary and to understand the difference between &#34;wasting lives and spending lives.&#34;<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> While in the Chi Ceti system, one of the Master Chief&#39;s fellow Spartans and best friend, Samuel-034, suffers an irreparable breach in his armor.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> Sam stays behind to detonate explosives, while the Master Chief and another comrade evacuate the ship. Although the Chief would have preferred to die with his friend, he tells himself that he needs to &#34;live and fight another day&#34;.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> In <i><a href="/wiki/Halo:_First_Strike" id="w">Halo: First Strike</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Halo_characters#Catherine Halsey" id="w">Dr. Catherine Halsey</a> tries to teach him to save every single life possible.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the Master Chief&#39;s excellent combat record, many in the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Space_Command" id="w">United Nations Space Command</a> (UNSC), the military unit to which he belongs, distrust him. <a href="/wiki/Characters_in_the_Halo_series#Antonio Silva" id="w">Antonio Silva</a>, an <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Space_Command#Orbital Drop Shock Troopers" id="w">Orbital Drop Shock Trooper</a>, exemplifies this attitude,<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> and considers the Master Chief a freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated. Although the Chief resents Silva&#39;s dishonor to his fallen comrades&#39; memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> Despite these explorations of the character&#39;s personality, O&#39;Connor said in an interview that revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character.<sup id="_ref-frank_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-frank" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Outward_appearance" name="Outward_appearance"></a><h3>Outward appearance</h3>
<p>In the video games, the Master Chief is never seen without his armor. In the final cutscene of <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i>, the Chief removes his helmet, but camera movement hides his face. Bungie did this to help the player identify with the Chief.<sup id="_ref-time_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-time" title="">[21]</a></sup> The only physical description of the Master Chief comes from the novels. During a briefing scene in <i><a href="/wiki/Halo:_The_Flood" id="w">Halo: The Flood</a></i>, the Chief is described as tall with short hair, serious eyes, and strong features. His skin is &#34;too white&#34;, a consequence of spending most of his time in his armor.<sup id="_ref-tf80_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tf80" title="">[22]</a></sup> The Master Chief stands about seven&#160;feet (2.13&#160;m) tall and weighs 1,000 pounds (450&#160;kg) in armor;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> without it, he stands six&#160;feet, six&#160;inches (1.98&#160;m) tall and weighs 287&#160;pounds (130&#160;kg).<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

The Master Chief&#39;s backstory is never explained in the video games. A prequel of <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i>, the 2001 novel <i><a href="/wiki/Halo:_The_Fall_of_Reach" id="w">The Fall of Reach</a></i>, reveals much of the character&#39;s history and was released as a companion to the game. The Master Chief, originally named John, was born in 2511 and first lived with his family on the human colony planet Eridanus 2. Large for his six years of age, and approximately a foot above his school peers, he is described as a typical boy with brown hair, freckles and a gap between his two front teeth.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> In 2517, John and seventy-four other children his age are covertly taken from their homes and replaced with <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Space_Command#Flash clones" id="w">flash clones</a> to hide the kidnapping. The original children are brought to planet <a href="/wiki/Reach_(Halo)" id="w">Reach</a>, one of the UNSC&#39;s headquarters, to begin intense physical and psychological training to become <a href="/wiki/SPARTAN-II_Project" id="w">SPARTAN-II</a> supersoldiers.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> They are assigned new identification numbers instead of last names; John becomes known as John-117. Approximately eight years later, John and the other children are biologically and <a href="/wiki/Cybernetics" id="w">cybernetically</a> augmented and enhanced.

<p>After the Spartans&#39; first successful operation, John-117 is briefed on the threat posed by the <a href="/wiki/Covenant_(Halo)" id="w">Covenant</a>, a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> The Spartans are first sent to the Damascus Materials Testing Facility on the planet Chi Ceti 4 to retrieve the <a href="/wiki/MJOLNIR_battle_armor" id="w">MJOLNIR Mark IV armor</a>.
