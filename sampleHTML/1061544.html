The <b>City &#38; South London Railway</b> (C&#38;SLR) was the first deep-level underground &#34;tube&#34; <a href="/wiki/Railway" id="w">railway</a> in the world,<sup id="_ref-first_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-first" title="">[1]</a></sup> and the first major railway in the world to use <a href="/wiki/Railway_electrification_in_Great_Britain" id="w">electric traction</a>. Originally intended for cable-hauled trains, the collapse of the cable contractor while the railway was under construction forced a change to electric traction before the line opened &#8211; an experimental technology at the time. </p>
<p>When opened in 1890, it served six stations and ran for a distance of {{convert}}<sup id="_ref-dist_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dist" title="">[2]</a></sup> in a pair of tunnels between the <a href="/wiki/City_of_London" id="w">City of London</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stockwell" id="w">Stockwell</a>, passing under the <a href="/wiki/River_Thames" id="w">River Thames</a>. The diameter of the tunnels restricted the size of the trains and the small carriages with their high-backed seating were nicknamed <i><a href="/wiki/Padded_cell" id="w">padded cells</a></i>. The railway was extended several times north and south; eventually serving 22 stations over a distance of {{convert}} from <a href="/wiki/Camden_Town" id="w">Camden Town</a> in north London to <a href="/wiki/Morden" id="w">Morden</a> in <a href="/wiki/Surrey" id="w">Surrey</a>.<sup id="_ref-dist_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dist" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the C&#38;SLR was well-frequented, low ticket prices and the construction cost of the extensions placed a strain on the company&#39;s finances. In 1913, the C&#38;SLR became part of the <a href="/wiki/Underground_Electric_Railways_Company" id="w">Underground Group</a> of railways and, in the 1920s, it underwent major reconstruction works before its merger with another of the Group&#39;s railways. In 1933, the C&#38;SLR and the rest of the Underground Group was taken into <a href="/wiki/Public_ownership" id="w">public ownership</a>. Today, its tunnels and stations form the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Line#Bank branch" id="w">Bank</a> branch and <a href="/wiki/Kennington_tube_station" id="w">Kennington</a> to <a href="/wiki/Northern_Line#Morden branch" id="w">Morden</a> section of the <a href="/wiki/London_Underground" id="w">London Underground</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Northern_Line" id="w">Northern Line</a>.</p>

In November 1883, notice was given that a <a href="/wiki/Private_bill" id="w">private bill</a> was to be presented to <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">Parliament</a> for the construction of the City of London &#38; Southwark Subway (CL&#38;SS).<sup id="_ref-Gazette_01_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_01" title="">[3]</a></sup> The promoter of the bill and engineer of the proposed railway was <a href="/wiki/James_Henry_Greathead" id="w">James Henry Greathead</a> who had, in 1869&#8211;1870, constructed the <a href="/wiki/Tower_Subway" id="w">Tower Subway</a> using the same <a href="/wiki/Tunnelling_shield" id="w">tunnelling shield</a>/segmented <a href="/wiki/Cast_iron" id="w">cast iron</a> tube method proposed for the CL&#38;SS.

<p>The bill received <a href="/wiki/Royal_Assent" id="w">Royal Assent</a> as the <i>City of London and Southwark Subway Act, 1884</i> on <a href="/wiki/28_July" id="w">28 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1884" id="w">1884</a>.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_02_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_02" title="">[5]</a></sup> Section 5 of the Act stated:<br/>

<p>Like Greathead&#39;s earlier Tower Subway, the CL&#38;SS was originally intended to be operated by cable haulage with a static engine pulling the cable through the tunnels at a steady speed.<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_x_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes_x" title="">[11]</a></sup> Section 5 of the 1884 Act specified that:<br/>

Trains were to be attached to the cable with clamps. These would be opened and closed at stations allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or interfere with the progress of other trains sharing the cable.<sup id="_ref-SubRail_01_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_01" title="">[12]</a></sup> The additional lengths of tunnels permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality of a cable-hauled system and before a solution could be found the cable contractor went out of business.<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes" title="">[4]</a></sup> Given the small dimension of the tunnels, steam power, used on London&#39;s other underground railways, was not feasible for a deep tube railway and had been prohibited by the enabling Act. The solution adopted was electrical power provided via a <a href="/wiki/Third_rail" id="w">third rail</a> beneath the train. Although the use of electricity to power trains had been experimented with in the previous decade and small-scale operations had been implemented, the C&#38;SLR was the first major railway in the world to adopt it as a means of motive power.<sup id="_ref-SubRail_01_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_01" title="">[12]</a></sup> The system operated using <a href="/wiki/London_Underground_electric_locomotives#City &amp; South London Railway" id="w">electric locomotives</a> built by Mather &#38; Platt collecting a <a href="/wiki/Electric_current" id="w">current</a> at 500 <a href="/wiki/Volt" id="w">volts</a> from the third rail and pulling several carriages.<sup id="_ref-CULG_01_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CULG_01" title="">[13]</a></sup> A depot and <a href="/wiki/Power_station" id="w">generating station</a> were constructed at Stockwell.<sup id="_ref-depot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-depot" title="">[14]</a></sup> The limited capacity of the generators meant that the stations were originally illuminated by <a href="/wiki/Gas_lighting" id="w">gas</a>.<sup id="_ref-SubRail_03_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_03" title="">[15]</a></sup> The depot was on the surface and trains requiring maintenance were initially hauled to the surface via a ramp but a <a href="/wiki/Elevator" id="w">lift</a> was soon installed.<sup id="_ref-SubRail_02_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_02" title="">[16]</a></sup> In practice, most rolling stock and locomotives only went to the surface for major maintenance. </p>
<p>To avoid the need to purchase agreements for running under surface buildings, the tunnels were bored below roadways where construction could be carried out without charge.<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes" title="">[4]</a></sup> At the northern end of the railway, the need to pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the <a href="/wiki/Middle_ages" id="w">mediaeval</a> street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Due to the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were required to the west of the station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere.<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes" title="">[4]</a></sup> The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tunnels converged immediately before the station, which was contained in one large tunnel and comprised a single track with platforms each side.<sup id="_ref-KWS_rebuilt_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KWS_rebuilt" title="">[17]</a></sup> The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks each side of a central platform.<sup id="_ref-Stockwell_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Stockwell" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

<p>The original service was operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage<sup id="_ref-SubRail_03_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_03" title="">[15]</a></sup>, which was provided with longitudinal bench seating and sliding doors at the ends, leading onto a platform from which they could board and alight. It was reasoned that there was nothing to look at in the tunnels so the only windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Due to their <a href="/wiki/Claustrophobia" id="w">claustrophobic</a> interiors, the carriages soon became known as <i>padded cells</i>.<sup id="_ref-padded_1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-padded_1" title="">[21]</a></sup> Unlike other railways, there were no ticket classes or paper tickets; when the railway began operations, a single flat fare of two <a href="/wiki/British_one_penny_coin_(pre-decimal)" id="w">pence</a>, collected at a turnstile, was charged for all passengers.<sup id="_ref-SubRail_03_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_03" title="">[15]</a></sup> Despite the cramped carriages and competition from existing bus and tram services over its route, the railway attracted 5.1&#160;million passengers in 1891, its first year of operation.<sup id="_ref-SubRail_11_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_11" title="">[22]</a></sup> To alleviate overcrowding, the fleet of rolling stock was enlarged.<sup id="_ref-SubRail_12_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_12" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>

<p>Shortly before it opened to the public, the C&#38;SLR gave notice of its intention to submit another private bill to Parliament &#8211; this time to construct a new line from its northern terminus at King William Street towards <a href="/wiki/Islington" id="w">Islington</a>.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_07_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_07" title="">[24]</a></sup> Due to the awkward arrangement of King William Street station, the extension was not to be connected directly to the existing running tunnels but was to be linked via a pedestrian subway through which passengers could make interchanges between the separate lines. The bill was rejected on the grounds that the extension failed to make a connection to the existing line.<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_02_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes_02" title="">[25]</a></sup> In November 1891, the C&#38;SLR published details of a revised bill for the extension to Islington.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_08_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_08" title="">[26]</a></sup> The company had recognised the deficiencies of its King William Street station and, just a year after the line had opened, planned to construct a new pair of tunnels to bypass the problematic northern section. </p>
<p>From near Borough station, the new tunnels would branch off and follow a new route via a new station to form an interchange with <a href="/wiki/London_Bridge_station" id="w">London Bridge</a> mainline station. The tunnels would then pass to the east of <a href="/wiki/London_Bridge" id="w">London Bridge</a>, then north through the City of London to <a href="/wiki/The_Angel%2C_Islington" id="w">The Angel, Islington</a>. Following a delay, during which a <a href="/wiki/Joint_committee" id="w">Joint Select Committee</a> reviewed the proposals of several new underground railways,<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_03_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes_03" title="">[27]</a></sup> the <i>City and South London Railway Act, 1893</i> was approved and received Royal Assent on <a href="/wiki/24_August" id="w">24 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1893" id="w">1893</a>.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_09_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_09" title="">[28]</a></sup> The Act also incorporated another bill of 1893<sup id="_ref-Gazette_10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_10" title="">[29]</a></sup> to grant an extension of time to build the southern extension to Clapham.<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_03_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes_03" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Construction of the two authorised extensions was delayed while funds were raised and plans were finalised. Between 1895 and 1898, three further bills were put before Parliament to keep the permissions alive and obtain additional approvals:

The new tunnels permitted by the 1895 Act enabled the track layout at King William Street station to be modified to a single central platform with a track each side.

The <a href="/wiki/Dividend" id="w">dividends</a> were low and declining (2⅛% in 1898, 1⅞% in 1899 and 1¼% in 1900) and the company had been accused of extravagance for the abandonment of King William Street station.<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_06_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes_06" title="">[42]</a></sup> In an attempt to work around this poor reputation and make it easier to raise funds, the next bill for an extension of the line was submitted in November 1900 by a notionally separate company, the Islington and Euston Railway (I&#38;ER),<sup id="_ref-Gazette_19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_19" title="">[43]</a></sup> albeit one that shared its chairman with the C&#38;SLR.<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_07_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes_07" title="">[44]</a></sup> The proposed railway was to run from the, as yet unfinished, C&#38;SLR station at Angel to the mainline stations at <a href="/wiki/London_King%26%2339%3Bs_Cross_railway_station" id="w">King&#39;s Cross</a>, <a href="/wiki/St_Pancras_railway_station" id="w">St. Pancras</a> and <a href="/wiki/Euston_railway_station" id="w">Euston</a>. The I&#38;ER bill coincided with a rash of other railway bills encouraged by the successful opening of the <a href="/wiki/Central_Line" id="w">Central London Railway</a> (CLR) in 1900 and was considered alongside these by another Parliamentary Joint Committee in 1901. The bill was approved,<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_08_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes_08" title="">[45]</a></sup> but the time taken for the committee&#39;s review meant that it had to be resubmitted for the 1902 Parliamentary session.<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_09_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes_09" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1902 session, the bill was considered again but was subject to opposition from one of London&#39;s other underground railways, the <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_and_Metropolitan_District_Railways#Metropolitan Railway" id="w">Metropolitan Railway</a> (MR), which considered the proposed extension to be a threat to its service between King&#39;s Cross and Moorgate. The I&#38;ER also submitted a petition to allow the C&#38;SLR to take over the powers of the railway if approved.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_20_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_20" title="">[47]</a></sup> The committee reversed its earlier decision and rejected the bill.<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes_10" title="">[48]</a></sup> In November 1902, the C&#38;SLR submitted a bill in its own name for the Euston extension as well as the authority to take over the dormant powers of the C&#38;BR.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_21_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_21" title="">[49]</a></sup> At Euston, the railway would have an interchange with the planned but not yet built <a href="/wiki/Charing_Cross%2C_Euston_%26amp%3B_Hampstead_Railway" id="w">Charing Cross, Euston &#38; Hampstead Railway</a> (CCE&#38;HR).

<p>By 1907, Londoners had seen the network of deep tube underground railways expand from the original C&#38;SLR line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than seventy stations.<sup id="_ref-line_list_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-line_list" title="">[52]</a></sup> These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and Metropolitan District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers as well as with the new <a href="/wiki/Tram" id="w">electric trams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bus" id="w">motor buses</a>. In several cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines made it difficult for the operators to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.<sup id="_ref-SubRail_05_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_05" title="">[53]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_12_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes_12" title="">[54]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In an effort to improve their collective situations, most of the underground railways in London; the C&#38;SLR, the CLR, the <a href="/wiki/Northern_City_Line" id="w">Great Northern &#38; City Railway</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Underground_Electric_Railways_Company" id="w">Underground Electric Railways Company of London Limited</a> (UERL, which operated the <a href="/wiki/Bakerloo_Line" id="w">Baker Street &#38; Waterloo Railway</a> (BS&#38;WR), the <a href="/wiki/Piccadilly_Line" id="w">Great Northern, Piccadilly &#38; Brompton Railway</a> (GNP&#38;BR), the CCE&#38;HR and the MDR) began, from 1907, to introduce fare agreements. From 1908, they began to present themselves through common branding as the <i>Underground</i>.<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_12_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes_12" title="">[54]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Waterloo_%26amp%3B_City_Line" id="w">Waterloo &#38; City Railway</a>, operated by the mainline <a href="/wiki/London_and_South_Western_Railway" id="w">London and South Western Railway</a>, was the only tube railway that did not participate in the arrangement.</p>
<p>In 1912, the C&#38;SLR submitted another bill for Parliamentary consideration seeking to increase its capacity by enlarging its tunnels to the larger diameter used for the tunnels of the more recently built railways. The enlarged tunnels would allow larger, more modern rolling stock to be used and this was also provided for in the bill.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_23_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_23" title="">[55]</a></sup> A separate bill was published at the same time by the <a href="/wiki/Underground_Electric_Railways_Company" id="w">London Electric Railway</a> (LER, a company formed by the UERL in 1910 through a merger of the BS&#38;WR, GNP&#38;BR and CCE&#38;HR), which included plans to construct tunnels to connect the C&#38;SLR at Euston to the CCE&#38;HR&#39;s station at <a href="/wiki/Camden_Town_tube_station" id="w">Camden Town</a>.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_24_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_24" title="">[56]</a></sup> Together, the works proposed in these bills would enable the CCE&#38;HR&#39;s trains to run over the C&#38;SLR&#39;s route and vice versa, effectively combining the two separate railways. </p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/1_January" id="w">1 January</a> <a href="/wiki/1913" id="w">1913</a>, the LER purchased the C&#38;SLR, paying two shares of its own stock for three of the C&#38;SLR&#39;s<sup id="_ref-SubRail_06_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_06" title="">[57]</a></sup> &#8211; a discount reflecting the struggling financial position of the older company.<sup id="_ref-purchase_of_CLR_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-purchase_of_CLR" title="">[58]</a></sup> Both bills were enacted on <a href="/wiki/15_August" id="w">15 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1913" id="w">1913</a> as the <i>City and South London Railway Act, 1913</i> and the <i>London Electric Railway Act, 1913</i>.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_25_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_25" title="">[59]</a></sup> </p>

In February 1919, with the War over, the C&#38;SLR submitted a new bill that included provisions for an extension of time for the tunnel enlargement works approved in the act of 1913.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_26_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_26" title="">[60]</a></sup> The resulting act was passed on <a href="/wiki/19_August" id="w">19 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1919" id="w">1919</a> as the <i>City and South London Railway Act, 1919</i>.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_27_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_27" title="">[61]</a></sup> In 1920, under special wartime provisions, The LER was granted an extension of time to carry out the works for its own 1913 act.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_28_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_28" title="">[62]</a></sup> However; although the permissions to carry out the works had been renewed, the Underground companies were not in a position to raise the funds needed to pay for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the companies could not cover the cost of repaying borrowed capital.<sup id="_ref-SubRail_07_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_07" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>The projects were made possible when the government introduced the <i>Trade Facilities Act, 1921</i> by which the <a href="/wiki/HM_Treasury" id="w">Treasury</a> <a href="/wiki/Underwriting" id="w">underwrote</a> loans for public works as a means of alleviating unemployment. With this support, the Underground companies were able to obtain the funds and work began on enlarging the tunnels of the C&#38;SLR.</p>
<p>The tunnels were enlarged by removing several of the cast iron segments from each tunnel ring, excavating a void behind to the required new diameter and reinstalling the segments with additional packing spacers. The northern section of the C&#38;SLR between Euston and Moorgate was closed from <a href="/wiki/8_August" id="w">8 August</a> <a href="/wiki/1922" id="w">1922</a>, but the rest of the line remained open with enlargement works taking place at night.<sup id="_ref-CULG_02_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CULG_02" title="">[20]</a></sup> A collapse on <a href="/wiki/27_November" id="w">27 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a> caused when a train hit temporary shoring on the incomplete excavations, filled the tunnel with soil.<sup id="_ref-CULG_02_g" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CULG_02" title="">[20]</a></sup> The line was briefly operated in two parts, but was completely closed on <a href="/wiki/28_November" id="w">28 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1923" id="w">1923</a>.<sup id="_ref-CULG_02_h" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CULG_02" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>

Some stations also received <a href="/wiki/Escalator" id="w">escalators</a> to replace the original lifts.</p>
<p>While the reconstruction works were underway, the C&#38;SLR submitted a bill in 1922 that contained proposals to extend the line south from Clapham Common through <a href="/wiki/Balham%2C_London" id="w">Balham</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tooting" id="w">Tooting</a> to <a href="/wiki/Morden" id="w">Morden</a> in tunnel.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_29_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_29" title="">[64]</a></sup> From Morden, the line was to continue on the surface to <a href="/wiki/Sutton%2C_London" id="w">Sutton</a> sharing part of the route of an unbuilt railway planned from <a href="/wiki/Wimbledon%2C_London" id="w">Wimbledon</a> to Sutton.</p>

<p>Despite the modernisation of the C&#38;SLR and other improvements made to other parts of the network,<sup id="_ref-improvements_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-improvements" title="">[67]</a></sup> the Underground railways were still struggling to make a profit. The Underground Group&#39;s ownership of the highly profitable <a href="/wiki/London_General_Omnibus_Company" id="w">London General Omnibus Company</a> (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the Group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways.<sup id="_ref-LGOC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-LGOC" title="">[68]</a></sup> However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early years of the 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole Group. </p>
<p>In an effort to protect the Group&#39;s income, its Managing Director/Chairman, <a href="/wiki/Albert_Stanley%2C_1st_Baron_Ashfield" id="w">Lord Ashfield</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lobbying" id="w">lobbied</a> the government for regulation of transport services in the London area.

Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the existing Group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the LCC&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Tram" id="w">tram</a> system; Morrison preferred full public ownership.<sup id="_ref-SubRail_08_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_08" title="">[69]</a></sup> Eventually, after several years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the <a href="/wiki/London_Passenger_Transport_Board" id="w">London Passenger Transport Board</a>, a public corporation that would take control of the Underground Group, the Metropolitan Railway as well as all buses and trams within an area designated as the <a href="/wiki/London_Passenger_Transport_Board#London Transport Passenger Area" id="w">London Transport Passenger Area</a>.<sup id="_ref-Gazette_31_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gazette_31" title="">[70]</a></sup>  The Board was a compromise &#8211; public ownership but not full <a href="/wiki/Nationalization" id="w">nationalisation</a> &#8211; and came into existence on <a href="/wiki/1_July" id="w">1 July</a> <a href="/wiki/1933" id="w">1933</a>.

<p>The technologies of deep tube tunnelling and electric traction pioneered and proved by the C&#38;SLR shaped the direction of subsequent underground railways built in London.<sup id="_ref-Lost_Tubes_13_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lost_Tubes_13" title="">[72]</a></sup> The C&#38;SLR demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without the need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for the shallow cuttings of sub-surface steam operated railways. Instead, it became possible to construct a tunnel at deep level without adversely effecting conditions on the surface. The C&#38;SLR thus encouraged the construction of a network of underground railways in London &#8211; far larger than would have been the case otherwise.<sup id="_ref-SubRail_10_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SubRail_10" title="">[73]</a></sup> The size and depth of the tunnels used on the deep tube lines does have drawbacks &#8211; the size of train carriages is limited and the lines suffer from overheating in the summer.</p>
<p>During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">World War II</a>, the disused tunnels between Borough and King William Street stations were converted for use as <a href="/wiki/Air-raid_shelter" id="w">air-raid shelters</a>.<sup id="_ref-KWS_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KWS" title="">[74]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-abandoned_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-abandoned" title="">[75]</a></sup> In the 1960s, they were used to assist the ventilation of London Bridge station. Most of the C&#38;SLR&#39;s six original station buildings were rebuilt or modified during the improvements to the line in the 1920s or during more recent modernisations. Only the building at Kennington retains its original exterior and the dome over the lift shaft, a feature of all the original stations.</p>
