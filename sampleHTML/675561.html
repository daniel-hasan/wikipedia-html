<b>Lewis Carl Hamilton</b> (born <a href="/wiki/January_7" id="w">January 7</a>, <a href="/wiki/1985" id="w">1985</a> in <a href="/wiki/Stevenage" id="w">Stevenage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hertfordshire" id="w">Hertfordshire</a>) is a <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Formula_One" id="w">Formula One</a> (F1) racing driver, currently racing for the <a href="/wiki/McLaren" id="w">McLaren</a> team. </p>
<p>He finished second in the <a href="/wiki/2007_Formula_One_Season" id="w">2007 Formula One Championship</a>, behind <a href="/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen" id="w">Kimi Räikkönen</a>. Hamilton has set numerous F1 rookie records and is the first <a href="/wiki/British_Mixed" id="w">black mixed race</a> driver to compete in Formula One.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> After winning the <a href="/wiki/British_Formula_Renault_Championship" id="w">British Formula Renault</a>, <a href="/wiki/Formula_Three_Euroseries" id="w">European Formula Three</a> and <a href="/wiki/GP2_series" id="w">GP2</a> championship he became a McLaren F1 driver for 2007. When he was ten,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> he approached McLaren team principal, <a href="/wiki/Ron_Dennis" id="w">Ron Dennis</a> at an awards ceremony and told him he would drive for McLaren one day; three years later, Hamilton was signed by McLaren and Mercedes-Benz to their Young Driver Support Programme, and ultimately, 12 years after this initial encounter, made his Formula One debut with the McLaren team. He has stated that he wants to stay in the McLaren team for the rest of his F1 career.
</p><a id="Personal_and_early_life" name="Personal_and_early_life"></a><h2>Personal and early life</h2>
<p>Hamilton&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Paternal" id="w">paternal</a> grandparents immigrated to the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a> from <a href="/wiki/Grenada" id="w">Grenada</a> in the 1950s. His grandfather worked on the <a href="/wiki/London_Underground" id="w">London Underground</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> His mother Carmen and father Anthony named him after the US <a href="/wiki/Olympic_Games" id="w">Olympic</a> gold medal winning athlete <a href="/wiki/Carl_Lewis" id="w">Carl Lewis</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Hamilton&#39;s parents separated when he was two and, until he was ten, he lived with his mother and half-sisters Nicola and Samantha.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> After that he lived with his father, stepmother Linda and half-brother Nicholas who has <a href="/wiki/Cerebral_palsy" id="w">cerebral palsy</a>.</p>
<p>Hamilton&#39;s first taste of racing competition came at the controls of <a href="/wiki/Radio-controlled_car" id="w">radio-controlled cars</a>. Father Anthony bought him one in 1991, and Hamilton finished second in the national championship the following year. Hamilton said of the time: &#34;I was racing these remote-controlled cars and winning club championships against adults&#34;.<sup id="_ref-hamiltonf1fbio_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hamiltonf1fbio" title="">[6]</a></sup> That led to Hamilton sampling kart racing for the first time. Aged six, his father bought him his first <a href="/wiki/Go-kart" id="w">go-kart</a> as a Christmas present,<sup id="_ref-nutsref_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nutsref" title="">[7]</a></sup> and would support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school. When supporting his son became problematic Anthony Hamilton took redundancy as an IT Manager and became a contractor - sometimes doing up to three jobs at a time to support his son&#39;s career - and still found enough time to attend all his races. He would later set up his own computer company, as well as working as a manager for Hamilton on a full time basis.<sup id="_ref-observer_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-observer" title="">[8]</a></sup>

<a id="Career" name="Career"></a><h2>Career</h2>
<a id="Karting" name="Karting"></a><h3>Karting</h3>
<p>Hamilton began <a href="/wiki/Kart_racing" id="w">karting</a> in 1993 at the age of eight,<sup id="_ref-BBC_07-06-19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC_07-06-19" title="">[13]</a></sup> at the <a href="/wiki/Rye_House_Kart_Circuit" id="w">Rye House Kart Circuit</a><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> and quickly began winning races and championships. At age ten, he approached McLaren F1 team boss Ron Dennis for an autograph, and told him, &#34;Hi. I&#39;m Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.&#34; Dennis wrote in his autograph book, &#34;Phone me in nine years, we&#39;ll sort something out then.&#34;<sup id="_ref-hamiltonf1fbio_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hamiltonf1fbio" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>From the Cadet ranks (1993-7), he progressed through the Junior Yamaha (1998) and Junior Intercontinental A (1999) divisions. In 1998 Dennis delivered on his promise and signed Hamilton to the McLaren driver development program. This contract included an option of a future F1 seat, making Hamilton the youngest ever driver to secure a contract which later resulted in an F1 drive.<sup id="_ref-BBC_07-06-19_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC_07-06-19" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

Lewis Hamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In <a href="/wiki/Formula_A" id="w">Formula A</a> and <a href="/wiki/Formula_Super_A" id="w">Formula Super A</a>, racing for TeamMBM.com, his team mate was <a href="/wiki/Nico_Rosberg" id="w">Nico Rosberg</a>, who would later drive for the <a href="/wiki/WilliamsF1" id="w">Williams</a> team in Formula One. Following his karting successes, the <a href="/wiki/British_Racing_Drivers%26%2339%3B_Club" id="w">British Racing Drivers&#39; Club</a> made him a ‘Rising Star’ Member in 2000.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2001 <a href="/wiki/Michael_Schumacher" id="w">Michael Schumacher</a> made a one-off return to karts and competed against Hamilton along with other future F1 drivers <a href="/wiki/Vitantonio_Liuzzi" id="w">Vitantonio Liuzzi</a> and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final seventh, four places behind Schumacher, and although the two saw little of each other on the track Schumacher praised the young Briton (see quote box).<sup id="_ref-hamiltonschumacherf1f_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hamiltonschumacherf1f" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Formula_Renault_and_Formula_Three" name="Formula_Renault_and_Formula_Three"></a><h3>Formula Renault and Formula Three</h3>

<p>Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series. Despite crashing on his third lap in the car in testing, he finished fifth overall in the winter series.<sup id="_ref-hamiltonf1fbio_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hamiltonf1fbio" title="">[6]</a></sup> and in the second he crashed out and was taken to hospital after a collision with his team-mate Tor Graves.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> He did show his speed at both the <a href="/wiki/Macau_Grand_Prix" id="w">Macau</a> and Korean Grands Prix. In the latter he qualified on pole position in his first visit to the track and in only his fourth F3 race.</p>
<p>Hamilton and Manor then made their début in the <a href="/wiki/2004" id="w">2004</a> <a href="/wiki/Formula_Three_Euroseries" id="w">Formula Three Euroseries</a>. They won one race and Hamilton ended the year fifth in the championship. He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix and raced one of the <a href="/wiki/Macau_Grand_Prix" id="w">Macau F3 Grand Prix</a>. Hamilton first tested for <a href="/wiki/McLaren" id="w">McLaren</a> in late 2004, at <a href="/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit" id="w">Silverstone</a>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>He moved to reigning Euroseries champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds after being disqualified from one win at <a href="/wiki/Spa-Francorchamps" id="w">Spa-Francorchamps</a> on a technical infringement that caught out several other drivers.<sup id="_ref-hamiltonf1fbio_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hamiltonf1fbio" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="GP2" name="GP2"></a><h3>GP2</h3>

<p>After the season, British magazine <i><a href="/wiki/Autosport" id="w">Autosport</a></i> featured him in their “Top 50 Drivers of 2005” issue, ranking Hamilton 24th. After his success in Formula Three, he moved to ASM&#39;s sister GP2 team <a href="/wiki/ART_Grand_Prix" id="w">ART Grand Prix</a> for <a href="/wiki/2006_GP2_Series_season" id="w">2006</a>. Just like their sister team in F3, ART were the class of the field and reigning champions having taken the 2005 GP2 crown with <a href="/wiki/Nico_Rosberg" id="w">Nico Rosberg</a>. Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt, beating <a href="/wiki/Nelson_Angelo_Piquet" id="w">Nelson Piquet, Jr</a>.</p>
<p>His notable performances included a dominant win at the <a href="/wiki/N%C3%BCrburgring" id="w">Nürburgring</a>, despite serving a penalty for speeding in the <a href="/wiki/Pit_stop" id="w">pit lane</a>. At his home race at <a href="/wiki/Silverstone" id="w">Silverstone</a>, supporting the <a href="/wiki/British_Grand_Prix" id="w">British Grand Prix</a>, Hamilton impressed by overtaking two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed (up to 150&#160;mph in a GP2 car) bends where overtaking is rare. He demonstrated his overtaking prowess again in Istanbul, when he recovered from a spin that left him 18th to take second place in the final corners. He won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final point he needed after <a href="/wiki/Giorgio_Pantano" id="w">Giorgio Pantano</a> was stripped of fastest lap in the <a href="/wiki/Autodromo_Nazionale_Monza" id="w">Monza</a> feature race.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

This was the first time in his F1 career he finished a race in a lower position than he started, and the first time he had been passed on the racetrack in Formula One. He took pole at his home Grand Prix at <a href="/wiki/2007_British_Grand_Prix" id="w">Silverstone</a> and led the first 16 laps, but slipped to third, 40 seconds behind Räikkönen and Alonso. </p>

However as he kept his engine running he was lifted back on to the circuit and able rejoin the race after the restart. His ninth place finish in this race was his first non-podium and non-points finish, enabling title contenders Alonso and Massa to reduce Hamilton&#39;s championship lead.</p>
<p>Hamilton won the <a href="/wiki/2007_Hungarian_Grand_Prix" id="w">Hungarian Grand Prix</a> from pole position following a controversy in qualifying. Alonso had set the fastest time, but was relegated to fifth on the grid for preventing Hamilton from leaving the pit lane in time to complete his final qualifying lap. <a href="/wiki/Kimi_R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen" id="w">Kimi Räikkönen</a> stayed within five seconds of Hamilton for the entire race (excluding pit stop periods).

<div class="thumbcaption">Hamilton took fourth place in <a href="/wiki/2007_Belgian_Grand_Prix" id="w">Belgium</a>.</div>
Alonso beat Hamilton in the <a href="/wiki/2007_Italian_Grand_Prix" id="w">Italian</a> and <a href="/wiki/2007_Belgian_Grand_Prix" id="w">Belgian</a> Grands Prix, leaving the Briton with a two-point lead in the title race. However he extended his lead to 12 points after winning the <a href="/wiki/2007_Japanese_Grand_Prix" id="w">Japanese Grand Prix</a> in heavy rain, after Alonso crashed. Following the race Hamilton was investigated by the race stewards over his involvement in an incident behind the safety car, which saw both <a href="/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel" id="w">Sebastian Vettel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mark_Webber" id="w">Mark Webber</a> crash out of the race while following the McLaren.

<p>After securing pole position in <a href="/wiki/2007_Chinese_Grand_Prix" id="w">China</a>, Hamilton retired from the race which saw changeable weather conditions. He experienced considerable tyre wear, notably his right rear, and he ran wide into the gravel trap in the pitlane, where his car beached. This was Hamilton&#39;s first retirement of his Formula One career. It was later revealed that <a href="/wiki/Bridgestone" id="w">Bridgestone</a> became unnerved at the glaringly worn tyres and advised McLaren to order him to make a <a href="/wiki/Pit_stop" id="w">pit stop</a> which McLaren refused to do, believing it would be counterproductive. Hamilton himself couldn&#39;t tell the full extent of the tyre problem as raindrops were in his wing mirrors.  Hamilton thus went into the final race of the season four and seven points ahead of Alonso and Räikkönen respectively.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/2007_Brazilian_Grand_Prix" id="w">Brazilian Grand Prix</a>, he failed to finish in a championship-winning position, finishing the race in 7th overall after being in 18th place at his worst point of the race. This occurred due to two major incidents; first, he was passed by Räikkönen away from the line, before being boxed in by Massa and Räikkönen in the first corner, the latter sharply &#39;chopping&#39; into him in mid-turn.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> As a result, Hamilton was passed by Alonso at Turn 3. Hamilton attempted to re-pass Alonso in turn four, but ran wide, dropping four places to eighth.</p>
<p>On lap 9, Hamilton encountered a gearbox problem, which meant that he was stuck in neutral and could not select any gears.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> 
The gearbox became operational again after Hamilton switched settings on his steering wheel, but he lost 40 seconds while his car was coasting. For most of the race, Massa was leading the race with Räikkönen in second. If this was the case come the <a href="/wiki/Racing_flag#The checkered flag" id="w">chequered flag</a> and with Hamilton in 7th place, this would have meant that Hamilton would become world champion, but after their second round of pit stops, Räikkönen stayed out a couple of laps longer than Massa and took the lead.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> Once in front, Räikkönen made no mistakes in the remaining laps to win the race and become Formula One world champion. </p>
<p>Later on <a href="/wiki/October_21" id="w">October 21</a>, it was announced that the <a href="/wiki/FIA" id="w">FIA</a> were investigating <a href="/wiki/BMW_Sauber" id="w">BMW Sauber</a> and <a href="/wiki/WilliamsF1" id="w">Williams</a> for fuel irregularities, the BMW drivers finished 5th and 6th, if they were to be excluded Hamilton would be promoted to 5th and would win the 2007 Drivers World Championship by one point over Räikkönen. A precedent had been set in 1995, Michael Schumacher, then of Benetton-Renault, and <a href="/wiki/David_Coulthard" id="w">David Coulthard</a>, then of Williams-Renault, were both found guilty of possessing illegal fuel in their cars. In that situation both drivers were initially docked drivers points, but for unspecified reasons it would transpire - over a week later - that constructor points would be docked. Ultimately, no penalty whatsoever was given to any team and it was said that there was &#34;sufficient doubt as to render it inappropriate to impose a penalty&#34;, though McLaren have officially appealed this decision.<sup id="_ref-McLaren appeal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McLaren appeal" title="">[40]</a></sup>
Hamilton subsequently told the BBC he does not want to win an F1 title through the disqualifications of other drivers.<sup id="_ref-McLaren appeal-LH view_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McLaren appeal-LH view" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hamilton has reportedly signed a multi-million pound contract with <a href="/wiki/HarperCollins" id="w">HarperCollins</a> for his autobiography.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ahead of the world championship finale, Hamilton answered a question about what it would mean to him to become the first <a href="/wiki/Blacks" id="w">black</a> champion, saying: &#34;It will show that not only white people can do it, but also black people, Indians, Japanese and Chinese. It will be good to mean something.&#34;<sup id="_ref-hamiltonpretitleremarks_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hamiltonpretitleremarks" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<p>Having made few public remarks about his ethnicity since becoming an F1 driver, Hamilton added: &#34;Outside of Formula One my heroes are foremost my father, then Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King. Being black is not a negative. It’s a positive, if anything, because I’m different. In the future it can open doors to different cultures and that is what motor sport is trying to do anyway.&#34;<sup id="_ref-hamiltonpretitleremarks_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hamiltonpretitleremarks" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>

</a>
<div class="thumbcaption">Hamilton on the podium after winning the <a href="/wiki/2007_United_States_Grand_Prix" id="w">2007 United States Grand Prix</a></div>
Hamilton&#39;s relationship with McLaren team boss Ron Dennis dates back to 1995.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> The first indication that Hamilton was unhappy with his team appeared after he finished second at <a href="/wiki/2007_Monaco_Grand_Prix" id="w">Monaco</a>. After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA initiated an inquiry to determine whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders.<sup id="_ref-inquiry_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-inquiry" title="">[45]</a></sup> McLaren denied favouring double world champion <a href="/wiki/Fernando_Alonso" id="w">Fernando Alonso</a>, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that: &#34;McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars. They did nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.&#34;<sup id="_ref-inquiry_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-inquiry" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, rivalry with team mate Alonso led to speculation that one of the pair would leave McLaren at the end of the 2007 season.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup>  Alonso and McLaren subsequently terminated their contract by mutual consent on <a href="/wiki/November_2" id="w">November 2</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>The tensions within the team surfaced at the <a href="/wiki/2007_Hungarian_Grand_Prix" id="w">2007 Hungarian Grand Prix</a>. During final qualifying for the race, Hamilton was involved in a controversy that saw McLaren and Alonso penalised after Hamilton was delayed in the pits and thus unable to set a final lap before the end of the session. McLaren pointed out that Hamilton had disobeyed an earlier instruction to let Alonso past in qualifying.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Alonso was relegated to 6th place on the grid, thus elevating Hamilton (who had originally qualified second) to first. Hamilton said he thought Alonso&#39;s penalty was &#34;quite light if anything&#34; and only regretted the loss of constructors&#39; points.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> British motorsport journal <i><a href="/wiki/Autosport" id="w">Autosport</a></i> claimed that this &#34;[lead] Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust (a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso&#39;s pole)&#34;.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> However McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton which denied the use of any profanity.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup>  As a result of these events, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso temporarily collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Hamilton calls for truce_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hamilton calls for truce" title="">[34]</a></sup>  In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by <a href="/wiki/Luca_di_Montezemolo" id="w">Luca di Montezemolo</a> regarding a <a href="/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari" id="w">Ferrari</a> drive for {{F1}}.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following the stewards&#39; investigation into the incident at the <a href="/wiki/2007_Japanese_Grand_Prix" id="w">2007 Japanese Grand Prix</a>, Alonso insinuated that the verdict had settled the championship in Hamilton&#39;s favour, saying: &#34;I’m not thinking of this championship anymore, it’s been decided off the track. The drivers’ briefing has no purpose. You go there to hear what <a href="/wiki/Charlie_Whiting" id="w">Charlie Whiting</a> and the other officials say. Twenty one drivers have an opinion, Charlie and the officials another, and so it’s like talking to a wall.&#34;<sup id="_ref-f1falonsohamiltonattack_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-f1falonsohamiltonattack" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<a id="2008_Season" name="2008_Season"></a><h4>2008 Season</h4>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/December_14" id="w">December 14</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, it was confirmed that <a href="/wiki/Heikki_Kovalainen" id="w">Heikki Kovalainen</a> will drive the second car for McLaren-Mercedes for the 2008 Formula One season alongside Hamilton.</p>
<a id="Records" name="Records"></a><h2>Records</h2>
<p>Hamilton has matched or set the following <a href="/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_records" id="w">records</a> in Formula One:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most consecutive podiums from debut race: 9 (previous record was 2)<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup> </li>
<li>Most consecutive podiums for a British driver: 9 (tied with <a href="/wiki/Jim_Clark" id="w">Jim Clark</a>)<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></li>
<li>Youngest driver to lead the World Championship.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup></li>
<li>Most wins in a debut season: 4 (equalling <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Villeneuve" id="w">Jacques Villeneuve</a>&#39;s record from {{f1}})</li>
<li>Most pole positions in a debut season: 6</li></ul>
<p>Hamilton is the first black driver to compete in Formula One (although <a href="/wiki/Willy_T._Ribbs" id="w">Willy T. Ribbs</a> tested an F1 car in 1986<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup>) and the first black driver to win a major race at <a href="/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway" id="w">Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a> in any discipline. In addition, he is the third youngest driver to achieve an F1 pole position, and the fourteenth F1 driver to achieve a podium finish on his debut.<sup id="_ref-Super Wheels_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Super Wheels" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>During the 2007 European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, Hamilton became the first driver to have his car recovered by a crane and put back on the track during an F1 race, although several drivers have been pushed back onto the circuit by the marshals without mechanical aids when judged to be in a dangerous position, such as Michael Schumacher during the <a href="/wiki/2003_European_Grand_Prix" id="w">2003 European Grand Prix</a>.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Lewis Hamilton&#39;s contract for the McLaren driver development program made him the youngest ever driver to secure a contract which later resulted in an F1 drive.<sup id="_ref-BBC_07-06-19_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC_07-06-19" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
