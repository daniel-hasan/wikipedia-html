<p>The <b>Turnip Prize</b> is a spoof UK prize that satirises the <a href="/wiki/Tate_Gallery" id="w">Tate Gallery</a>&#39;s  <a href="/wiki/Turner_Prize" id="w">Turner Prize</a> by exhibiting deliberately badly made &#34;art&#34; created with minimal effort. It was started mainly as a joke in 1999, but has gained national media attention and inspired other similar prizes.</p>
<a id="History" name="History"></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>It was conceived in 1999 by the management and regulars of The George Hotel (subsequently the New Inn), <a href="/wiki/Wedmore" id="w">Wedmore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Somerset" id="w">Somerset</a>. Its instigation was prompted by the exhibition of <a href="/wiki/Tracey_Emin" id="w">Tracey Emin</a>&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/My_Bed" id="w">My Bed</a></i> in the <a href="/wiki/Turner_Prize" id="w">Turner Prize</a> that year. It is organised by Trevor Prideaux. It was announced as, &#34;The Turnip Prize is a crap art competition ... You can enter anything you like, but it must be rubbish.&#34; The competition was based on the notion, &#34;We know it&#39;s rubbish, but is it art?&#34; and competitors submitted entries of ridiculous objects posing as contemporary art objects, mostly made from junk with titles that are spoofs or puns. The prize is a turnip impaled on a rusty six-inch nail.  </p>
<p>In May 2000, the nominees appeared on the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a> TV <a href="/wiki/Esther_Rantzen" id="w">Esther Rantzen</a> show. The show has been featured regularly by national and even international media.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Other_competitions" name="Other_competitions"></a><h2>Other competitions</h2>
<p>Other prizes have also challenged the Turner Prize. In 1993, the <a href="/wiki/K_Foundation" id="w">K Foundation</a> awarded the Â£40,000 &#34;<a href="/wiki/K_Foundation_art_award" id="w">Anti-Turner Prize</a>&#34;, for the &#34;worst artist in Britain&#34;, voted from the Turner Prize&#39;s short-list. In 2000 the <a href="/wiki/Stuckism" id="w">Stuckists</a> instituted &#34;The Real Turner Prize&#34; for painters. In 2003, the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Mail" id="w">Daily Mail</a></i> ran a &#34;Not the Turner Prize&#34; competition. </p>
<p>Many independent &#34;Turnip Prize&#34; competitions are now held around the world, with differing rules made up by those who are running the competitions. Competitions generally aspire to concept, &#34;We know it&#39;s rubbish, but is it art?&#34; and competitors submit entries made from junk with titles that are nonsensical or puns. Marks are awarded for amusement and lack of effort, and  competitors are frequently disqualified for applying too much effort. In  2001,  <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sun" id="w">The Sun</a></i> tabloid newspaper featured its own Turnip Prize.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2002 &#34;The Turnip Award&#34; was opened annually for students at <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh_College_of_Art" id="w">Edinburgh College of Art</a> to &#34;carve or design something out of the humble vegetable&#34;.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup> The 2005 prize was a mountain bike.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> In 2005 a Turnip Prize was staged at St Paul&#39;s Gallery in <a href="/wiki/London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets" id="w">Tower Hamlets</a>, London for local residents.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The term was previously used in 1998 by <a href="/wiki/YBA" id="w">YBA</a> Jake Chapman of the <a href="/wiki/Chapman_Brothers" id="w">Chapman Brothers</a> (2003 Turner Prize nominees): &#34;We thought if we couldn&#39;t get the Turner Prize we should get the Turnip Prize.&#34;<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_Wedmore_competition" name="The_Wedmore_competition"></a><h2>The Wedmore competition</h2>

<p>In 2003, the winner was James Timms with <i>Take a Leaf out of My Chook</i>, a raw chicken stuffed with leaves.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2005, Ian Osenthroat, a 69-year-old former photocopier salesman, won with <i>Birds Flew</i>, a bird&#39;s nest with a flu remedy box. He commented, &#34;I have entered this most coveted art award on several occasions and I really feel that the lack of effort this year has really paid off.&#34;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The winner in 2006 was Ian Lewis with <i>Torn Beef</i>, an empty corned beef can. He said, &#34;The work took no time at all to create.&#34; Trevor Prideaux commented, &#34;I believe that over the last seven years the bad artists of Wedmore and surrounding areas have created far better works than <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Serota" id="w">Nicholas Serota</a> and The <a href="/wiki/Tate_Britain" id="w">Tate Britain</a> Gallery could ever wish to exhibit.&#34;<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Also in 2006, the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a>&#39;s Chief Somerset Correspondent, <a href="/wiki/Clinton_Rogers" id="w">Clinton Rogers</a>, was immortalised as <i>Clint on a Row of Jars</i>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2007, the competition gained even more publicity after the entry of a piece of artwork with the title <i>By the Banksea</i>. The painting bears a striking resemblance to the work of the famous Bristol graffiti artist <a href="/wiki/Banksy" id="w">Banksy</a> and it&#39;s origins are a closely guarded secret.
By the Banksea protrays a seaside Aunt Sally in the form of a stencil of the Mona Lisa, but in true Banksy-style, the Mona Lisa is holding a rocket launcher, firing a a turnip over the wreckage of a seaside pier and an emergency exit sign.
Competition organiser Trevor Prideaux said: &#39;It does seem to be in Banksy&#39;s style. But someone has thought too much about this one and tried too hard. So for that reason it&#39;s not likely to win.&#39; 
The piece was duly disqualified for &#39;too much effort and not s##t enough&#39;.
The 2007 competition was won by Bracey Vermin with <i>Tea P</i>, used tea bags in the shape of a P.</p>
