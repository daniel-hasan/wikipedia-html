<b>Lucius Aelius Seianus</b> (<a href="/wiki/20_BC" id="w">20 BC</a> &#8211; <a href="/wiki/October_18" id="w">October 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/31" id="w">31 AD</a>), commonly known as <b>Sejanus</b>, was an ambitious soldier, friend and confidant of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Emperor" id="w">Roman Emperor</a> <a href="/wiki/Tiberius" id="w">Tiberius</a>. An <a href="/wiki/Equestrian_(Roman)" id="w">equestrian</a> by birth, Sejanus rose to power as <a href="/wiki/Praetorian_Prefect" id="w">prefect</a> of the Roman imperial <a href="/wiki/Bodyguard" id="w">bodyguard</a>, known as the <a href="/wiki/Praetorian_Guard" id="w">Praetorian Guard</a>, of which he was commander from <a href="/wiki/14" id="w">14 AD</a> until his death in 31.</p>
<p>While formally established under emperor <a href="/wiki/Augustus" id="w">Augustus</a>, Sejanus introduced a number of reforms to the Praetorians which saw the unit evolve beyond a mere bodyguard into a powerful and influential branch of the government involved in public security, civil administration, and ultimately political intercession; changes which would have a lasting impact on the course of the <a href="/wiki/Principate" id="w">Principate</a>.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/20s" id="w">20s</a>, Sejanus gradually accumulated power by consolidating his influence over Tiberius and eliminating potential political opponents, including the emperor&#39;s son, <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar_Drusus" id="w">Julius Caesar Drusus</a>. When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in <a href="/wiki/26" id="w">26</a>, Sejanus was left in control of the entire state mechanism as <a href="/wiki/De_facto" id="w">de facto</a> ruler of the empire. For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome, Sejanus suddenly fell from power the same year his career culminated with the <a href="/wiki/Roman_consul" id="w">consulship</a> in <a href="/wiki/31" id="w">31</a>. Amidst suspicions of conspiracy against the emperor, Sejanus was arrested and executed, along with his followers.</p>

Officially the equestrians were only the second tier of the elite, behind the <a href="/wiki/Patrician" id="w">patrician</a> or senatorial class. Sejanus&#39; grandfather however maintained relations with senatorial families through his marriage with Terentia, a sister of the wife of <a href="/wiki/Gaius_Maecenas" id="w">Gaius Maecenas</a>, who was one of emperor <a href="/wiki/Augustus" id="w">Augustus</a>&#39; most powerful political allies.<sup id="_ref-adams 76_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-adams 76" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Strabo himself married into equally illustrious families.

<p>The adoptive family of Sejanus counted two consuls among their family: the aforementioned Quintus Aelius Tubero (consul in <a href="/wiki/11_BC" id="w">11 BC</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Sextus_Aelius_Catus" id="w">Sextus Aelius Catus</a> (consul in <a href="/wiki/4" id="w">4</a>), who was the father of <a href="/wiki/Aelia_Paetina" id="w">Aelia Paetina</a>, future wife of <a href="/wiki/Claudius" id="w">Claudius</a>.

</p>
<p>It is likely that Sejanus&#39; father Strabo came to the attention of Augustus through his father&#39;s connection with Maecenas. Sometime after <a href="/wiki/2_BC" id="w">2 BC</a>,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> he was appointed <a href="/wiki/Praetorian_prefect" id="w">prefect</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Praetorian_Guard" id="w">Praetorian Guard</a>, one of the two most powerful positions a Roman knight could attain in the Empire. This office he carried on dutifully and without incident until the death of the emperor in <a href="/wiki/14" id="w">14</a>. Little is known about the life Sejanus led prior to this date, but according to Tacitus, he accompanied <a href="/wiki/Gaius_Caesar" id="w">Gaius Caesar</a>, adopted grandson of Augustus, during his campaigns in <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Armenia" id="w">Armenia</a> in <a href="/wiki/1_BC" id="w">1 BC</a>.<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-iv-1_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-iv-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> It was upon the accession of <a href="/wiki/Tiberius" id="w">Tiberius</a> in 14, that Sejanus was appointed prefect of the Praetorian Guard as the colleague of his father Strabo, and began his rise to prominence. </p>
<p>The Praetorian Guard was an elite unit of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_army" id="w">Roman army</a> formed by Augustus in <a href="/wiki/27_BC" id="w">27 BC</a>, with the specific function to serve as a <a href="/wiki/Bodyguard" id="w">bodyguard</a> to the emperor and members of the imperial family.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Much more than a guard however, the Praetorians also managed the day-to-day care of the city, such as general security and civil administration.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> Furthermore, their presence served as a constant reminder to the people and the Senate of the substantial armed force which served as the basis for the imperial power.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Augustus was careful however to uphold the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic" id="w">republican</a> veneer of this regime, and only allowed nine <a href="/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)" id="w">cohorts</a> to be formed (one less than in a normal <a href="/wiki/Roman_legion" id="w">Roman legion</a>), which were inconspicuously scattered across various lodging houses in the city, and commanded by two prefects.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Strabo was assigned to the <a href="/wiki/Roman_governor" id="w">governorship</a> of <a href="/wiki/Ægyptus" id="w">Egypt</a> in <a href="/wiki/15" id="w">15</a>, Sejanus became the sole commander of the Praetorians and instigated reforms that helped shape the guard into a powerful tool of the <a href="/wiki/Principate" id="w">principate</a>.<sup id="_ref-dio-history-lvii-19_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dio-history-lvii-19" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/20" id="w">20</a> the scattered encampments inside the city were centralized into <a href="/wiki/Castra_Praetoria" id="w">a single garrison</a> just outside Rome<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-iv-2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-iv-2" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> and the number of cohorts was increased from nine to twelve,<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> one of which now held the daily guard at the palace. The practice of joint leadership between two prefects was abandoned, and Sejanus himself appointed the <a href="/wiki/Centurion_(Roman_army)" id="w">centurions</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tribune#Roman military officers" id="w">tribunes</a>.<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-iv-2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-iv-2" title="">[13]</a></sup> With these changes in effect, Sejanus now commanded the complete loyalty of a force of around 12,000 soldiers, all of which were at his immediate disposal. The facade of Augustus was no longer maintained, and Tiberius openly displayed the strength of the guard at parades.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

In his capacity of Praetorian prefect Sejanus quickly became a trusted advisor to Tiberius. By 23 he already exerted a considerable influence over the decisions of the emperor, who referred to Sejanus as &#34;my partner in my toils&#34;.<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-iv-2_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-iv-2" title="">[13]</a></sup> By this time he had been raised to the rank of <a href="/wiki/Praetor" id="w">praetor</a>, a position which was not normally granted to Romans of the <a href="/wiki/Equestrian_(Roman)" id="w">equestrian class</a>.<sup id="_ref-dio-history-lvii-19_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dio-history-lvii-19" title="">[11]</a></sup> A statue had been erected in his honor in the <a href="/wiki/Theatre_of_Pompey" id="w">Theatre of Pompey</a>,<sup id="_ref-seneca-marcia-xxii-4-6_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-seneca-marcia-xxii-4-6" title="">[17]</a></sup> and in the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Senate" id="w">Senate</a> his followers were advanced with public offices and governorships.<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-iv-2_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-iv-2" title="">[13]</a></sup> However this privileged position caused resentment among the senatorial class and the imperial family, in particular earning him the enmity of <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar_Drusus" id="w">Julius Caesar Drusus</a>, Tiberius&#39; son.</p>
<p>The history of Sejanus and Drusus dated back to at least <a href="/wiki/15" id="w">15 AD</a>. That year a <a href="/wiki/Mutiny" id="w">mutiny</a> had broken out among <a href="/wiki/Roman_legion" id="w">legions</a> posted in <a href="/wiki/Pannonia" id="w">Pannonia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Germania" id="w">Germania</a>. While his adopted son <a href="/wiki/Germanicus" id="w">Germanicus</a> restored order in Germania, Tiberius&#39; own son Drusus was sent to quell the uprising in Pannonia, accompanied by Sejanus and two Praetorian <a href="/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)" id="w">cohorts</a>.<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-i-24_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-i-24" title="">[18]</a></sup> In part due to what the soldiers believed to be bad <a href="/wiki/Omen" id="w">omens</a>, Drusus quickly managed to restore the stability in the army and publicly put the chief instigators to death. The camp was purged of mutineers by the Praetorians and the legions returned to the <a href="/wiki/Castra#Types of castra" id="w">winter barracks</a>.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Despite this success, the following years witnessed a growing animosity between Drusus and Sejanus. </p>
<p>Since the accession of Tiberius Drusus had been systematically groomed as the successor of his father, successfully commanding legions in <a href="/wiki/Illyricum_(Roman_province)" id="w">Illyricum</a> in <a href="/wiki/18" id="w">18</a>,<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> and sharing the consulship with Tiberius in <a href="/wiki/21" id="w">21</a>.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> In practice however it was still Sejanus who was the second man in the empire, and he was ambitious to further expand his power. As early as 20, Sejanus had sought to solidify his connection with the imperial family by betrothing his daughter Junilla to the son of <a href="/wiki/Claudius" id="w">Claudius</a>, Claudius Drusus.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> At the time the girl was only 4 years old but the marriage was nonetheless prevented when the boy accidentally died a few days later of <a href="/wiki/Asphyxia" id="w">asphyxiation</a>.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When this failed it seems Sejanus turned his attention toward eliminating Drusus. By <a href="/wiki/23" id="w">23</a> the enmity between the two men had reached a critical point. During an argument Drusus had struck the prefect with his fist,<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-iv-3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-iv-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> and he openly lamented that &#34;a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor&#39;s son was alive&#34;.<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-iv-7_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-iv-7" title="">[24]</a></sup> With Tiberius already in his sixties, there was a real possibility of Drusus succeeding his father in the near future. To secure his position Sejanus secretly plotted against him and succeeded in seducing his wife <a href="/wiki/Livilla" id="w">Livilla</a>.<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-iv-3_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-iv-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> With her as an accomplice Drusus was slowly poisoned and died of seemingly natural causes on <a href="/wiki/September_13" id="w">September 13</a>, <a href="/wiki/23" id="w">23</a>.<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-iv-8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-iv-8" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

The loss of his son was a major blow to Tiberius, both personally and politically. Over the years he had grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps, and by sharing the <a href="/wiki/Tribune#Tribune of the Plebs" id="w">tribunician powers</a> with Drusus in <a href="/wiki/22" id="w">22</a> had prepared to relent some of his responsibilities in favour of his son.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> With these hopes now dashed, Tiberius left his administration more than ever in the care of Sejanus, and looked toward the sons of <a href="/wiki/Germanicus" id="w">Germanicus</a> as possible future heirs.<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-iv-8_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-iv-8" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

Her relations with Tiberius became increasingly fraught as she made it clear that she believed that he was responsible for the death of Germanicus.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> The climate was further poisoned by the hatred that Tiberius&#39; mother <a href="/wiki/Livia" id="w">Livia Augusta</a> felt for her, since Agrippina&#39;s ambition, to be the mother of emperors and thus Rome&#39;s first woman, was an open secret.<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-iv-12_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-iv-12" title="">[29]</a></sup> To Sejanus personally, Agrippina&#39;s sons <a href="/wiki/Nero_Caesar" id="w">Nero</a>, <a href="/wiki/Drusus_Caesar" id="w">Drusus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Caligula" id="w">Gaius Caligula</a> were considered a direct threat to his power.<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-iv-12_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-iv-12" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sejanus again attempted to marry into the <a href="/wiki/Julio-Claudian_dynasty" id="w">Julio-Claudian</a> family. Having divorced Apicata two years earlier he requested marriage with Livilla in <a href="/wiki/25" id="w">25</a>, possibly with an eye towards placing himself, as an adopted <a href="/wiki/Julius" id="w">Julian</a>, in the position of a potential successor.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> The Emperor denied this request, warning Sejanus that he was in danger of overstepping his rank.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> Alarmed by this sudden denigration, Sejanus changed his plans and began to isolate Tiberius from Rome. By fueling his <a href="/wiki/Paranoia" id="w">paranoia</a> towards Agrippina and the Senate he induced the emperor to withdraw to the countryside of <a href="/wiki/Campania" id="w">Campania</a>, which he did in <a href="/wiki/26" id="w">26</a>, and finally to the island of <a href="/wiki/Capri" id="w">Capri</a>, where he would spend the remainder of his life until his death in <a href="/wiki/37" id="w">37</a>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Guarded by the Praetorians, Sejanus easily controlled all information that passed between Tiberius and the capital.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the withdrawal of Tiberius from Rome&#39;s political scene, the presence of Livia seems to have checked Sejanus&#39; overt power for a time. According to Tacitus, her death in <a href="/wiki/29" id="w">29</a> changed all that.<sup id="_ref-tacitus-annals-v-3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-tacitus-annals-v-3" title="">[34]</a></sup> Sejanus began a series of purge trials of <a href="/wiki/Roman_Senator" id="w">senators</a> and wealthy equestrians in the city, removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial (and his own) treasury. Networks of <a href="/wiki/Espionage" id="w">spies</a> and informers brought the victims to trial with false accusations of <a href="/wiki/Treason" id="w">treason</a>, and many chose suicide over the disgrace of being condemned and executed.<sup id="_ref-dio-history-lviii-4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dio-history-lviii-4" title="">[35]</a></sup> Among those who perished were <a href="/wiki/Gaius_Asinius_Gallus" id="w">Asinius Gallus</a>, a prominent senator and opponent of Tiberius who was linked to Agrippina&#39;s faction.<sup id="_ref-dio-history-lviii-3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dio-history-lviii-3" title="">[36]</a></sup> Agrippina herself and two of her sons, Nero and Drusus were arrested and <a href="/wiki/Exile" id="w">exiled</a> in <a href="/wiki/30" id="w">30</a>, and later <a href="/wiki/Starvation" id="w">starved</a> to death in suspicious circumstances.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> Only Gaius (aka Caligula), as the last remaining son of Germanicus, managed to survive the purges of Sejanus by moving to Capri with Tiberius in <a href="/wiki/31" id="w">31</a>.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 31, despite his equestrian rank, Sejanus shared the <a href="/wiki/Roman_consul" id="w">consulship</a> with Tiberius <a href="/wiki/In_absentia" id="w">in absentia</a>,<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> and finally became betrothed to <a href="/wiki/Livilla" id="w">Livilla</a>. The emperor had not been seen in Rome since 26. Sejanus was de facto ruler of the Roman Empire, and senators and equestrians openly courted his favour as if he were such.<sup id="_ref-dio-history-lviii-2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dio-history-lviii-2" title="">[40]</a></sup> His <a href="/wiki/Birthday" id="w">birthday</a> was publicly observed and statues were being erected in his honour.<sup id="_ref-dio-history-lviii-2_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dio-history-lviii-2" title="">[40]</a></sup> With most of the political opposition crushed, Sejanus felt his position was unassailable. As the ancient historian <a href="/wiki/Cassius_Dio" id="w">Cassius Dio</a> describes:</p>
<p /><blockquote>Sejanus was so great a person by reason both of his excessive haughtiness and of his vast power, that, to put it briefly, he himself seemed to be the emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, inasmuch as the latter spent his time on the island of Capreae.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor, Sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire. By the end of 31, he would be arrested, summarily <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment" id="w">executed</a> and his body unceremoniously cast down the <a href="/wiki/Gemonian_stairs" id="w">Gemonian stairs</a>. Exactly what caused his sudden downfall is unclear.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> Ancient historians disagree about the nature of his conspiracy, whether it was Tiberius or Sejanus who struck first, and in which order subsequent events transpired.<sup id="_ref-boddington-sejanus_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boddington-sejanus" title="">[43]</a></sup> Modern historians consider it unlikely that Sejanus plotted to seize the imperial power for himself and, if he had planned so at all, rather might have aimed at overthrowing Tiberius to serve as a <a href="/wiki/Regent" id="w">regent</a> to <a href="/wiki/Tiberius_Gemellus" id="w">Tiberius Gemellus</a>, son of Drusus, or possibly even <a href="/wiki/Caligula" id="w">Gaius Caligula</a>.<sup id="_ref-boddington-sejanus_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boddington-sejanus" title="">[43]</a></sup> Unfortunately the relevant section pertaining to this period in the <i>Annals</i> of Tacitus has been lost. According to <a href="/wiki/Josephus" id="w">Josephus</a> however, it was <a href="/wiki/Antonia_Minor" id="w">Antonia</a>, the mother of Livilla, who finally alerted Tiberius to the growing threat Sejanus posed, in a letter she dispatched to Capri in the care of her <a href="/wiki/Freedman" id="w">freedman</a> <a href="/wiki/Pallas_(freedman)" id="w">Pallas</a>.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Further details concerning Sejanus&#39; fall are provided by Cassius Dio, writing nearly 200 years after the facts in his <i>Roman History</i>. It appears that, when Tiberius heard to which extent Sejanus had already <a href="/wiki/Usurper" id="w">usurped</a> power in Rome, he immediately took steps to remove him from power, but realised that an outright condemnation could provoke Sejanus in attempting a <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%26%2339%3B%C3%A9tat" id="w">coup</a> against him.<sup id="_ref-dio-history-lviii-4_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dio-history-lviii-4" title="">[35]</a></sup> Instead he addressed a number of contradictory letters to the Senate, some of which praised Sejanus and his friends, others which suddenly denounced them. Alternatingly, Tiberius announced he would arrive in Rome the very next day, or claimed he was at the point of death.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> He stepped down as consul, thereby forcing Sejanus to do the same,<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> and conferred an honorary priesthood upon Caligula, which rekindled popular support for the house Germanicus.<sup id="_ref-dio-history-lviii-8_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dio-history-lviii-8" title="">[47]</a></sup> The ensuing confusion was successful in alienating Sejanus from many of his followers. With the intentions of the emperor no longer clear, it was now deemed a safer course of action at Rome to withdraw from overt support to Sejanus until the matter was clearly settled.<sup id="_ref-dio-history-lviii-8_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dio-history-lviii-8" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>When it became clear to Tiberius that support for Sejanus was not as strong as he had feared, his next step was to choose <a href="/wiki/Naevius_Sutorius_Macro" id="w">Naevius Sutorius Macro</a>, who had previously been prefect of the <a href="/wiki/Vigiles" id="w">vigiles</a> (Roman police and fire department),<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup> to replace Sejanus and accomplish his downfall.<sup id="_ref-dio-history-lviii-9_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dio-history-lviii-9" title="">[49]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/October_18" id="w">October 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/31" id="w">31</a>, Sejanus was summoned to a Senate meeting by a letter from Tiberius, ostensibly to bestow the tribunician powers upon him. At dawn he entered the Senate, but while the letter was being read Macro assumed control of the Praetorian Guard, and members of the vigiles led by <a href="/wiki/Graecinius_Laco" id="w">Graecinius Laco</a> surrounded the building.<sup id="_ref-dio-history-lviii-9_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dio-history-lviii-9" title="">[49]</a></sup> The senators at first congratulated Sejanus, but when the letter, which first digressed into completely unrelated matters, suddenly denounced him and ordered his arrest, he was immediately surrounded and escorted to <a href="/wiki/Mamertine_Prison" id="w">prison</a>.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>

The same evening, the Senate convened at the <a href="/wiki/Temple_of_Concord" id="w">Temple of Concord</a> and summarily condemned Sejanus to death.

<a id="Praetorian_Guard" name="Praetorian_Guard"></a><h2> Praetorian Guard </h2>
<p>Augustus&#39;s death on <a href="/wiki/August_19" id="w">August 19</a> <a href="/wiki/14" id="w">14</a> marked the end of Praetorian calm, the only time the Praetorian Guard did not use its military strength to play a part in the politics of Rome to force its own agenda. Augustus would be the sole emperor to command their complete loyalty. The reforms of Sejanus, most significantly the founding of the Castra Praetoria, essentially established the Praetorian Guard as the powerful political force for which it is primarily known today.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> Henceforth the entire Guard was at the disposal of the emperors, but the rulers were now equally at the mercy of the Praetorians.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> The reality of this was seen in 31 when Tiberius was forced to rely upon the vigiles against the soldiers of his own guard.<sup id="_ref-dio-history-lviii-9_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dio-history-lviii-9" title="">[49]</a></sup> Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>The power Sejanus attained in his capacity as prefect proved <a href="/wiki/Maecenas" id="w">Maecenas</a> right in his prediction to Augustus that it was dangerous to allow one man to command the guard.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> Cassius Dio notes that after Sejanus, no other prefect except <a href="/wiki/Gaius_Fulvius_Plautianus" id="w">Gaius Fulvius Plautianus</a> would rise to such influence.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, following his death the guard began to play an increasingly ambitious and bloody role in the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" id="w">Empire</a>. With the right amount of money, or at will, they assassinated emperors, bullied their own prefects, or turned on the people of Rome. In <a href="/wiki/41" id="w">41</a> Caligula was killed by conspirators from the senatorial class and from the Guard.
