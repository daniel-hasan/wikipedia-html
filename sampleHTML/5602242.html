<p><b>The Tannehill Ironworks</b> is a state historic site in <a href="/wiki/Tuscaloosa_County%2C_Alabama" id="w">Tuscaloosa County</a> near <a href="/wiki/Bessemer%2C_Alabama" id="w">Bessemer, Alabama</a>, <a href="/wiki/USA" id="w">USA</a></p>
<p>Listed on the <a href="/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places" id="w">National Register of Historic Places</a>, it was a major supplier of iron for <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" id="w">Confederate</a> ordnance. Remains of the old furnaces are the central attraction of <b>Tannehill Ironworks Historical State Park</b> located {{convert}} south of Bessemer, Alabama off <a href="/wiki/Interstate_59" id="w">I-59</a>/<a href="/wiki/Interstate_20" id="w">20</a> near the southern end of the <a href="/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains" id="w">Appalachian Mountains</a>.</p>
<p>The 1,500 acre (6 kmÂ²) historical park also includes the John Wesley Hall Grist Mill, May Plantation Cotton Gin House and the <a class="externallink" href="http://www.tannehill.org/museum.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.tannehill.org/museum.html">Iron &#38; Steel Museum of Alabama</a>.</p>
<p>Ironmaking at the site began with construction of a bloomery forge by Daniel Hillman Sr. in 1830.</p>
<p>Built by noted southern ironmaster Moses Stroup from 1859 to 1862, the three charcoal blast furnaces at Tannehill could produce 22 tons of pig iron a day, most of which was shipped to the Naval Gun Works and Arsenal at Selma. Furnaces Nos. 2 and 3 were equipped with hot blast stoves and a steam engine. Brown iron ore mines were present two miles (3 km) distant.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Tannehill furnaces and its adjacent foundry, where kettles and hollow-ware were cast for southern troops, were attacked and burnt by three companies of the U.S. 8th Iowa Cavalry on March 31, 1865 (<a href="/wiki/Wilson%26%2339%3Bs_Raid" id="w">Wilson&#39;s Raid</a>). The ruins remain today as one the best preserved 19th century iron furnace sites in the South.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also known as the Roupes Valley Iron Company, these works had significant influence on the later development of the <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" id="w">Birmingham</a> iron and steel industry.  An experiment conducted at Tannehill in 1862 proved red iron ore could successfully be used in Alabama blast furnaces. The test, promoted by South &#38; North Railroad developers, led to the location of government-financed ironworks in the immediate Birmingham area (Jefferson County).<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The furnace remains, including reconstructed portions, are an <a href="/wiki/American_Society_for_Metals" id="w">American Society for Metals</a> historical landmark<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> and have been designated as a <a class="externallink" href="http://www.civilwar.org/CWDT/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.civilwar.org/CWDT/">Civil War Discovery Trail</a> site. The park attracted over 425,000 visitors in 2005.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
