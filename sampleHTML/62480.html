Archaeologists have excavated prehistoric fishing camps on Mackinac Island and in the surrounding areas. Fishhooks, pottery, and other artifacts establish a Native American presence at least 700 years before European exploration, around 900 AD. The island is a sacred place in the tradition of some of its earliest known inhabitants, the <a href="/wiki/Anishinaabe" id="w">Anishinaabe</a> (<a href="/wiki/Ojibwa" id="w">Ojibwa</a>) tribes, who consider it to be home to the <a href="/wiki/Gitche_Manitou" id="w">Gitche Manitou</a>, or the &#34;Great Spirit&#34;.<sup id="_ref-.orgHistory_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-.orgHistory" title="">[15]</a></sup> According to legend, Mackinac Island was created by the Great Hare, <a href="/wiki/Michabou" id="w">Michabou</a> and was the first land to appear after the recession of the <a href="/wiki/Deluge_(prehistoric)" id="w">Great Flood</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> The island was a gathering place for the local tribes where their offerings were made to Gitche Manitou and was where tribal chiefs were buried. </p>
<p>The first European likely to have seen Mackinac Island is <a href="/wiki/Jean_Nicolet" id="w">Jean Nicolet</a>, a French-Canadian <a href="/wiki/Coureur_de_bois" id="w">coureur de bois</a>, during his 1634 explorations. The Jesuit priest <a href="/wiki/Claude_Dablon" id="w">Claude Dablon</a> founded a mission for the <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native Americans</a> on Mackinac Island in 1670, and stayed over the winter of 1670-71.  Dablon&#39;s fall 1671 successor, the missionary and explorer <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Marquette" id="w">Jacques Marquette</a>, moved the mission to St. Ignace soon after his arrival.<sup id="_ref-Hamilton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hamilton" title="">[17]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Boynton_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Boynton" title="">[18]</a></sup> With the mission as a focus, the Straits of Mackinac quickly became an important French fur trading location. The British took control of the Straits of Mackinac after the <a href="/wiki/French_and_Indian_War" id="w">French and Indian War</a> and Major <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Sinclair" id="w">Patrick Sinclair</a> chose the bluffs of the island for <a href="/wiki/Fort_Mackinac" id="w">Fort Mackinac</a> in 1780.<sup id="_ref-High Cliffs_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-High Cliffs" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-.orgHistory_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-.orgHistory" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the British built Fort Mackinac to protect their settlement from attack by Americans and native tribes, the fort was never attacked during the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" id="w">American Revolutionary War</a> and the entire Straits area was officially acquired by the United States through the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)" id="w">Treaty of Paris</a> in 1783. However, much of the British forces did not leave the Great Lakes area until after <a href="/wiki/Jay%26%2339%3Bs_Treaty" id="w">Jay&#39;s Treaty</a> established U.S. sovereignty over the entire <a href="/wiki/Northwest_Territory" id="w">Northwest Territory</a> in 1794.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup>
During the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" id="w">War of 1812</a>, the British captured the fort in the first <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Mackinac_Island_(1812)" id="w">battle</a> of the conflict because the Americans had not yet heard that war had been declared. The victorious British attempted to protect their prize by building Fort George on the <a href="/wiki/High_ground" id="w">high ground</a> behind Fort Mackinac. In 1814, the Americans and British fought a second <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Mackinac_Island" id="w">battle</a> on the north side of the island. The American second-in-command, Major <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Holmes" id="w">Andrew Hunter Holmes</a>, was killed and the Americans failed to recapture the island.  </p>
<p>Despite this outcome, the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Ghent" id="w">Treaty of Ghent</a> forced the British to return the island and surrounding mainland to the U.S. in 1815. The United States reoccupied Fort Mackinac, and renamed Fort George <i>Fort Holmes</i>, after Major Holmes.<sup id="_ref-High Cliffs_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-High Cliffs" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Holmes_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Holmes" title="">[4]</a></sup> Fort Mackinac remained under the control of the United States government until 1895 and provided volunteers to defend the Union during the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>. The fort even served as a prison for three <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" id="w">Confederate</a> sympathizers.<sup id="_ref-.orgHistory_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-.orgHistory" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/John_Jacob_Astor" id="w">John Jacob Astor</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/American_Fur_Company" id="w">American Fur Company</a> was centered on Mackinac Island after the War of <a href="/wiki/1812" id="w">1812</a> and exported <a href="/wiki/Beaver" id="w">beaver</a> pelts for thirty years. By the middle of the 19th century, <a href="/wiki/Commercial_fishing" id="w">commercial fishing</a> for <a href="/wiki/Common_whitefish" id="w">whitefish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lake_trout" id="w">lake trout</a> began to replace the fur trade as the island&#39;s primary industry. As <a href="/wiki/Sport_fishing" id="w">sport fishing</a> became more popular in the 1880s, hotels and restaurants accommodated tourists coming by train or lake boat from <a href="/wiki/Detroit" id="w">Detroit</a> and similar cities.<sup id="_ref-High Cliffs_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-High Cliffs" title="">[2]</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Following the Civil War, the island became a popular tourist destination for residents of cities on the Great Lakes. Much of the federal land on Mackinac Island was designated as <a href="/wiki/Mackinac_National_Park" id="w">Mackinac National Park</a> in <a href="/wiki/1875" id="w">1875</a>, just three years after <a href="/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park" id="w">Yellowstone</a> was designated as the first national park. To accommodate an influx of tourists in the 1880s, the boat and railroad companies built hotels, including the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Hotel_(Mackinac_Island)" id="w">Grand Hotel</a>. Souvenir shops began to spring up as a way for island residents to profit from the tourists. Many wealthy <a href="/wiki/Industrialist" id="w">industrialists</a> built summer <a href="/wiki/Cottage" id="w">cottages</a> along the island&#39;s bluffs for extended stays. When the federal government left the island in 1895, all of the federal land, including Fort Mackinac, was given to the state of Michigan and became Michigan&#39;s first state park. The Mackinac Island State Park Commission appointed to oversee the island has limited private development in the park and requires leaseholders to maintain the island&#39;s distinctive Victorian architecture.<sup id="_ref-Historic Treasure_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Historic Treasure" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Victorian Era_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Victorian Era" title="">[20]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Motor_vehicles" id="w">Motor vehicles</a> were restricted at the end of the 19th century because of concerns for the health and safety of the island&#39;s residents and horses after local carriage drivers complained that automobiles startled their horses.

<a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>Like many historic places in the Great Lakes region, Mackinac Island&#39;s name derives from a Native American language. Native Americans in the Straits of Mackinac region likened the shape of the island to that of a turtle. Therefore, they named it &#34;Mitchimakinak&#34; (<a href="/wiki/Anishinaabe_language" id="w">Ojibwe</a> <i>mishi-mikinaak</i>)<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> meaning &#34;big turtle&#34;. The French used a version of the original pronunciation: <a href="/wiki/Michilimackinac" id="w">Michilimackinac</a>. However, the English shortened it to the present name: &#34;Mackinac.&#34;<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

<p>Every summer, Mackinac Island accommodates at least 50 Michigan <a href="/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America" id="w">Boy Scouts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scouting_in_Michigan" id="w">Girl Scouts</a> over alternate weeks. The program began in 1929, when the State Park Commission invited eight <a href="/wiki/Eagle_Scout_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" id="w">Eagle Scouts</a>, including young <a href="/wiki/Gerald_Ford" id="w">Gerald Ford</a>, to serve as <a href="/wiki/Honor_guard" id="w">honor guards</a> for the Michigan governor. In 1974, the program was expanded to include Girl Scouts. The program is popular and selective. Scouts raise and lower all of the flags in the city and in Fort Mackinac, serve as guides, and complete a service project during their stay.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>

<p>Mackinac Island contains a wide variety of terrain, including fields, marshes, bogs, coastline, <a href="/wiki/Boreal_forest" id="w">boreal forest</a>, and limestone formations. The environment is legally preserved on the island by the State Historic Park designation. About half of the shoreline and adjacent waters off Mackinac Island, including the harbor (Haldimand Bay) and the southern and western shore from Mission Point to Pointe aux Pins, is protected as part of the <a href="/wiki/Straits_of_Mackinac_Shipwreck_Preserve" id="w">Straits of Mackinac Shipwreck Preserve</a>, a state <a href="/wiki/Marine_park" id="w">marine park</a>.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> </p>
<p>As it is separated from the mainland by 3&#160;miles (4.8&#160;km) of water, few <a href="/wiki/Mammal" id="w">mammals</a> inhabit the island, except those that traverse the ice during the winter months. <a href="/wiki/Bat" id="w">Bats</a> are the most abundant mammals as crossing the water is no obstacle for them. There are many limestone caves serving as homes for the bats and many insects on the island for the bat to prey on. The island is frequented by migratory birds on their trips between their summer and winter habitats. <a href="/wiki/Eagle" id="w">Eagles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hawk" id="w">hawks</a> are abundant in April and May, while smaller birds such as <a href="/wiki/Yellow_Warbler" id="w">Yellow Warblers</a>, <a href="/wiki/American_Redstart" id="w">American Redstart</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Indigo_Bunting" id="w">Indigo Bunting</a> are more common in early summer.

Mackinac Island was formed as the glaciers of the last <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin_glaciation" id="w">ice age</a> began to melt around 13,000 BC. The bedrock strata that underlie the island are much older, dating to Late <a href="/wiki/Silurian" id="w">Silurian</a> and Early <a href="/wiki/Devonian" id="w">Devonian</a> time, about 400 to 420 million years ago. Subsurface deposits of <a href="/wiki/Halite" id="w">halite</a> (rock salt) dissolved, allowing the collapse of overlying limestones; these once-broken but now solidified rocks comprise the Mackinac <a href="/wiki/Breccia" id="w">Breccia</a>.</p>
<p>The melting glaciers formed the Great Lakes, and the receding lakewaters eroded the <a href="/wiki/Limestone" id="w">limestone</a> bedrock, forming the island&#39;s steep cliffs and rock formations. At least three previous lake levels are known, two of them higher than the present shore: Algonquin lakeshores date to about 10,000 years ago, and the Nipissing shorelines formed about 12,000 years ago.<sup id="_ref-Shorelines_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Shorelines" title="">[52]</a></sup> During an intermediate period of low water between these two high-water stages, the Straits of Mackinac shrank to a narrow gorge which discharged its water into Lake Huron through <a href="/wiki/Mackinac_Falls" id="w">Mackinac Falls</a>, located just east of Mackinac Island.<sup id="_ref-Waterfall_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Waterfall" title="">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the Great Lakes assumed their present levels, Mackinac Island took on its current size.<sup id="_ref-HistplacesPDF_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HistplacesPDF" title="">[1]</a></sup> The steep cliffs were one of the primary reasons for the British army&#39;s choice of the island for a fortification; their decision differed from that of the French army, which had built <a href="/wiki/Fort_Michilimackinac" id="w">Fort Michilimackinac</a> about 1715 near present-day <a href="/wiki/Mackinaw_City" id="w">Mackinaw City</a>. The limestone formations are still part of the island&#39;s appeal. However, tourists are attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is <a href="/wiki/Arch_Rock_(Mackinac_Island)" id="w">Arch Rock</a>, a natural limestone arch, nearly 150&#160;feet (45&#160;m) above the ground.<sup id="_ref-High Cliffs_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-High Cliffs" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> Other popular geologic formations include <a href="/wiki/Sugar_Loaf_(Mackinac_Island)" id="w">Sugar Loaf</a> and Skull Cave.<sup id="_ref-Historic Treasure_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Historic Treasure" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
