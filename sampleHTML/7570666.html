<p><b><i>Haystacks</i></b> is the title of a series of <a href="/wiki/Impressionism" id="w">impressionist</a> <a href="/wiki/Painting" id="w">paintings</a> by <a href="/wiki/Claude_Monet" id="w">Claude Monet</a>. The primary subjects of all of the paintings in the series are stacks of <a href="/wiki/Hay" id="w">grain</a> that have been stacked in the field after the harvest season. The title refers primarily to a twenty-five <a href="/wiki/Canvas#Canvas for painting" id="w">canvas</a> series (<a href="/wiki/Wildenstein_Index_Number" id="w">Wildenstein Index Number</a> 1266-1290) begun the fall of 1890 and continued through the following spring, using that year&#39;s grain <a href="/wiki/Harvest" id="w">harvest</a>. Some use a broader definition of the title to refer to other paintings by Monet with this same theme.  The series is known for its <a href="/wiki/Theme_(arts)" id="w">thematic</a> use of repetition to show differences in <a href="/wiki/Perception" id="w">perception</a> of <a href="/wiki/Light" id="w">light</a> across various times of day, <a href="/wiki/Seasons" id="w">seasons</a>, and types of <a href="/wiki/Weather" id="w">weather</a>. The subjects were painted in fields near Monet&#39;s home in <a href="/wiki/Giverny" id="w">Giverny</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>.</p>
<p>The series is among Monet&#39;s most notable works. Although the largest collections of Monet&#39;s work are held in <a href="/wiki/Paris" id="w">Paris</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_d%26%2339%3BOrsay" id="w">Musée d&#39;Orsay</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_Marmottan_Monet" id="w">Musée Marmottan Monet</a>, <a href="/wiki/Boston" id="w">Boston</a>, <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Massachusetts</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Museum_of_Fine_Arts%2C_Boston" id="w">Museum of Fine Arts</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" id="w">New York City</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum" id="w">Metropolitan Museum</a> and <a href="/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art" id="w">Museum of Modern Art</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tokyo" id="w">Tokyo</a> at the <a href="/wiki/National_Museum_of_Western_Art" id="w">National Museum of Western Art</a>,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> six of the twenty-five haystacks pieces are currently housed at the <a href="/wiki/Art_Institute_of_Chicago" id="w">Art Institute of Chicago</a> in <a href="/wiki/Chicago%2C_IL" id="w">Chicago</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a>, <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a> holds two,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/The_Louvre" id="w">The Louvre</a> in <a href="/wiki/Paris%2C_France" id="w">Paris</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a> holds one.

<a id="Monet_background" name="Monet_background"></a><h1>Monet background</h1>
<p>{{mainarticle}}
Monet settled in <a href="/wiki/Giverny" id="w">Giverny</a> in 1883. Most of his paintings from 1883 until his death 40 years later were of scenes within {{km to mi}} of his home. Indeed, the grainstacks themselves were situated just outside his door.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> He was intensely aware of and fascinated by the visual nuances of the region’s landscape and the variation in the seasons. </p>
<p>Monet had already painted the same subject in different moods. However, as he matured as a painter, his depictions of <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere" id="w">atmospheric</a> influences were increasingly concerned not only with specific effects, but with overall color harmonies that allowed for an autonomous use of rich color.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The conventional wisdom was that the compact, solid haystacks were both a simple subject and an unimaginative one. However, contemporary writers and friends of the artist noted that Monet&#39;s subject matter was always carefully chosen, the product of careful thought and analysis.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Monet undertook a study of capturing their vibrance under direct light, and juxtaposing the same subject from the same view in more muted atmospheric conditions. It was not unusual for Monet to alter the canvases back in his studio, in search of harmonious transitions within the series.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Series_background" name="Series_background"></a><h1>Series background</h1>
<p>The stacks depicted herein are variously referred to as haystacks and grainstacks.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[16]</a></sup> The {{ft to m}} stacks emblematized the <a href="/wiki/Normandy" id="w">Normandy</a> region of France by emphasizing the beauty and prosperity of the countryside. The grainstacks functioned as storage facilities that preserved the wheat until stalk and chaff could be more efficiently separated.<sup id="_ref-MiN143_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MiN143" title="">[17]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Normans" id="w">Norman</a> method of storing grain was to use hay as a cover to shield ears of grain from the elements until they could be threshed. The threshing machines traveled from village to village. Thus, although the grain was harvested in July it often took until March for all the farms to be reached. These stacks became common in the mid 19th century. This method survived for 100 years, until the inception of <a href="/wiki/Combine_harvesters" id="w">combine harvesters</a>. Although shapes of stacks were regional, it was common for them to be round in the <a href="/wiki/Paris_Basin_(geology)" id="w">Paris basin</a> and the region of Normandy in which Giverny is situated. </p>
<p>Monet noticed this subject on a casual walk. He requested that his stepdaughter Blanche Hoschedé bring him two canvases. He believed that one canvas for overcast weather and one for sunny weather would be sufficient.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup> However, he realized he could not demonstrate the several distinct impressions on one or two canvases. As a result, his willing helper was quickly carting as many canvases as a <a href="/wiki/Wheelbarrow" id="w">wheelbarrow</a> could hold.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> His daily routine involved carting <a href="/wiki/Paint" id="w">paints</a>, <a href="/wiki/Easel" id="w">easels</a>, and many unfinished canvases and working on whichever canvas most closely resembled the scene of the moment as conditions fluctuated. Although he began painting realistic depictions <i><a href="/wiki/En_plein_air" id="w">en plein air</a></i>, he eventually revised initial effects in a studio to both generate contrast and preserve the harmony within the series.<sup id="_ref-MIN139_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MIN139" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Monet produced numerous Haystack paintings. His earlier <a href="/wiki/Landscape_art" id="w">landscapes</a> (Wildenstein Index Number 900-995, 1073) had included haystacks in an ancillary manner. Monet had also produced five paintings (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1213-1217) with haystacks as the primary subject during the 1888 harvest.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> The general consensus is that only the canvases produced using the 1890 harvest (Wildenstein Index Number 1266-1290) comprise the haystacks series proper. However, some include several additional paintings when referencing this series. For example, <a href="/wiki/Hill-Stead_Museum" id="w">Hill-Stead Museum</a> discusses their two serial haystack or grainstack paintings even though one is from the 1890 harvest and the other is from the 1888 harvest.<sup id="_ref-HSM_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-HSM" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>This series is one of Monet&#39;s earliest that relied on thematic repetition to illustrate nuances in perception across natural variation such as times of day, seasons, and types of weather.  For Monet, the concept of producing and exhibiting a series of paintings related by subject and vantage point began in 1889, with at least ten paintings done at the <i>Valley of the Creuse</i>, and subsequently shown at the <a href="/wiki/Art_gallery" id="w">Galerie</a> <a href="/wiki/Georges_Petit" id="w">Georges Petit</a>.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> This interest in the serial <a href="/wiki/Motif_(visual_arts)" id="w">motif</a> would continue for the rest of his career.</p>
<a id="Thematic_issues" name="Thematic_issues"></a><h1>Thematic issues</h1>
<p>Although the mundane subject was constant throughout this series, the underlying theme may be seen as the transience of light. This concept enabled him to use repetition to show nuances of perception as seasons, time of day, and weather changes. The constant subject provided the basis from which comparisons could be made in changes of light across this nuanced series.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October of 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.<sup id="_ref-MIN139_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MIN139" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Beginning in the 1880s and 1890s, Monet focused on <i>Haystacks</i> and a number of other subjects (other series included the <i>Mornings on the <a href="/wiki/Seine" id="w">Seine</a>,</i> <i><a href="/wiki/Poplar" id="w">Poplars</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Rouen_Cathedral_(Monet)" id="w">Rouen Cathedral</a>,</i> the <i><a href="/wiki/London_Parliament_(Monet)" id="w">Houses of Parliament</a>,</i> and the <i><a href="/wiki/Water_Lilies" id="w">Water Lilies</a>,</i> among others). In order to work on many paintings virtually simultaneously, he would awake before <a href="/wiki/Dawn" id="w">dawn</a> so as to begin at the earliest time of day:</p>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>As the morning progressed and the light changed he would switch to sequentially later canvas settings, sometimes working on as many as ten or twelve paintings a day, each one depicting a slightly different aspect of light.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> The process would be repeated over the course of days, weeks, or months, depending on the weather and the progress of the paintings, until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed. </p>
<p>Certain effects of light only last for a few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera received attention for no more than a few minutes a day.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent <a href="/wiki/Sunrise" id="w">sunrises</a>, for example, could alter substantially, and would require separate canvases within the series.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup> Subsequently, different <a href="/wiki/Hue" id="w">hues</a> are evident in each painting, and in each work <a href="/wiki/Color" id="w">color</a> is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons haystacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color <a href="/wiki/Spectrum" id="w">spectrum</a>. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the haystacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many notable painters have been influenced by this particular series including <a href="/wiki/Les_Fauves" id="w">Les Fauves</a>, <a href="/wiki/Derain" id="w">Derain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maurice_de_Vlaminck" id="w">Vlaminck</a>.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Kandinsky" id="w">Kandinsky</a>&#39;s memoirs refer to the series: “What suddenly became clear to me was the unsuspected power of the palette, which I had not understood before and which surpassed my wildest dreams.”<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> <div style="wigth:240px"><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:240px-1274_Grainstacks_Snow_Effect%2C_Meules%2C_effet_de_neige%2C_1890-91%2C_60_x_100cm%2C_Oil_on_Canvas%2C_Hill-Stead_Museum%2C_Farmington%2C_CT.JPG" title="&#39;&#39;Grainstacks, Snow Effect&#39;&#39;, 1890-91, [[Shelburne Museum]], Shelburne, VT."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/240px-1274_Grainstacks_Snow_Effect%2C_Meules%2C_effet_de_neige%2C_1890-91%2C_60_x_100cm%2C_Oil_on_Canvas%2C_Hill-Stead_Museum%2C_Farmington%2C_CT.JPG" alt="&#39;&#39;Grainstacks, Snow Effect&#39;&#39;, 1890-91, [[Shelburne Museum]], Shelburne, VT." title="&#39;&#39;Grainstacks, Snow Effect&#39;&#39;, 1890-91, [[Shelburne Museum]], Shelburne, VT." class="location-right type-thumb" width="240px" />

The <i>Haystacks</i> series was a financial success.<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup> Fifteen of these were exhibited by <a href="/wiki/Durand-Ruel" id="w">Durand-Ruel</a> in May 1891, and every painting sold within days.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> The exhibit met with great public acclaim. <a href="/wiki/Octave_Mirbeau" id="w">Octave Mirbeau</a> described Monet&#39;s daring series as representing &#34;what lies beyond progress itself.&#34; Others described the grainstacks as &#34;faces of the landscape,&#34; and viewers seemed to take assurance that the series would help preserve rural traditions despite <a href="/wiki/Industrialization" id="w">industrialization</a> and <a href="/wiki/Urbanization" id="w">urbanization</a>.<sup id="_ref-MiN143_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MiN143" title="">[17]</a></sup> They represented the <a href="/wiki/Countryside" id="w">countryside</a> as a retreat from daily problems and home for contentment with nature. <a href="/wiki/Camille_Pissarro" id="w">Camille Pissarro</a> said &#34;These canvases breathe contentment.&#34;<sup id="_ref-MiN143_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MiN143" title="">[17]</a></sup> Most of the paintings sold immediately for as much as 1,000 <a href="/wiki/Franc" id="w">francs</a>.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> Additionally, Monet’s prices in general began to rise steeply. As a result, he was able to buy outright the house and grounds at <a href="/wiki/Giverny" id="w">Giverny</a> and to start constructing a <a href="/wiki/Waterlily" id="w">waterlily</a> <a href="/wiki/Pond" id="w">pond</a>. After years of mere subsistence living he was able to enjoy success. </p>
<p>The series demonstrates his intense study of light and atmospheric conditions and Monet was a perfectionist in his renderings. Monet destroyed more than one series of paintings that he found wanting.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup> However, this series escaped his own harsh self-criticism and destruction.</p>
