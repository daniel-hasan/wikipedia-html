<b>Typhoon Xangsane</b> (international designation: <b><i>0615</i></b>, JTWC designation: <b><i>18W</i></b>, PAGASA name <b>Typhoon Milenyo</b>) was a deadly typhoon that affected the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vietnam" id="w">Vietnam</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Thailand" id="w">Thailand</a> during the <a href="/wiki/2006_Pacific_typhoon_season" id="w">2006 Pacific typhoon season</a>. It was the fifteenth tropical storm and ninth typhoon recognized by the <a href="/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency" id="w">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> operationally during the season, although in post-operational analysis it became the tenth typhoon of the season with the addition of Typhoon Maria. According to the <a href="/wiki/Joint_Typhoon_Warning_Center" id="w">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a>, Xangsane was the sixteenth tropical storm and tenth typhoon of the season, and was a <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 4-equivalent</a> typhoon in terms of 1-minute average wind speeds. The name Xangsane was submitted by <a href="/wiki/Laos" id="w">Laos</a> and means <a href="/wiki/Elephant" id="w">elephant</a>.<sup id="_ref-Typhoon Name (RSMC)_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Typhoon Name (RSMC)" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Xangsane made landfall in the Philippines, battering the northern islands with torrential rains and strong winds, and causing widespread flooding and landslides. After passing over <a href="/wiki/Manila" id="w">Manila</a> and emerging over the <a href="/wiki/South_China_Sea" id="w">South China Sea</a>, the typhoon made a second landfall in central Vietnam, also causing flooding and landslides there and in Thailand. The storm was responsible for at least 279 deaths, mostly in the Philippines and Vietnam, and at least $747 million (2006 USD) in damage.<sup id="_ref-RW-Xinhua_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RW-Xinhua" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-NDCC_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NDCC" title="">[3]</a></sup>

On <a href="/wiki/September_25" id="w">September 25</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Philippine_Atmospheric%2C_Geophysical_and_Astronomical_Services_Administration" id="w">Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration</a> (PAGASA) named an active low pressure area within its area of responsibility Tropical Depression Milenyo. Having earlier issued a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_Cyclone_Formation_Alert" id="w">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Joint_Typhoon_Warning_Center" id="w">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) issued its first warning on Tropical Depression 18W the same day. On <a href="/wiki/September_26" id="w">September 26</a> the <a href="/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency" id="w">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) designated the system Tropical Storm Xangsane.</p>
<p>Xangsane rapidly intensified and later that day, the JMA upgraded Xangsane to a severe tropical storm. Xangsane made landfall on <a href="/wiki/Samar_Island" id="w">Samar Island</a> as a severe tropical storm, before a bout of further rapid intensification occurred. All three agencies, the JMA, JTWC and PAGASA upgraded the storm to a typhoon late on <a href="/wiki/September_26" id="w">September 26</a> or early <a href="/wiki/September_27" id="w">September 27</a>.</p>
<p>Xangsane then passed through the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" id="w">Philippine islands</a>, wreaking havoc and becoming the strongest typhoon to directly impact <a href="/wiki/Metro_Manila" id="w">Metro Manila</a> in eleven years.<sup id="_ref-Metro Manila_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Metro Manila" title="">[5]</a></sup> As it entered the <a href="/wiki/South_China_Sea" id="w">South China Sea</a> as a weak typhoon, it began to re-intensify, reaching its secondary peak strength shortly before landfall near <a href="/wiki/Hu%E1%BA%BF" id="w">Huáº¿</a> on <a href="/wiki/October_1" id="w">October 1</a>. The JTWC ceased advisories after landfall, while the JMA carried the storm inland until it was over <a href="/wiki/Thailand" id="w">Thailand</a> as a tropical depression. It remained as a low pressure area over central <a href="/wiki/Indochina" id="w">Indochina</a> on the JMA&#39;s weather charts for several days, while the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Navy" id="w">U.S. Navy</a>&#39;s Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting system carried the remnants of Xangsane into the <a href="/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal" id="w">Bay of Bengal</a>.</p>
