<b><i>Doctor Who</i></b> is a long-running award-winning <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television" id="w">science fiction television</a> programme produced by the <a href="/wiki/BBC" id="w">BBC</a>. The programme depicts the adventures of a mysterious <a href="/wiki/Time_travel" id="w">time-traveller</a> known as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">the Doctor</a>&#34; who travels in his space- and time-ship, the <a href="/wiki/TARDIS" id="w">TARDIS</a>, which appears from the exterior to be a blue <a href="/wiki/Police_box" id="w">police phone box</a>. With his <a href="/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">companions</a>, he explores time and space, solving problems and righting wrongs.</p>
<p>The programme is listed in <i><a href="/wiki/Guinness_World_Records" id="w">Guinness World Records</a></i> as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> and is also a significant part of <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a> <a href="/wiki/Popular_culture" id="w">popular culture</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-icon_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-icon" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Moran_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Moran" title="">[4]</a></sup> It has been recognised for its imaginative stories, creative low-budget <a href="/wiki/Special_effects" id="w">special effects</a> during its original run, and pioneering use of electronic music (originally produced by the <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop" id="w">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a>). In Britain and elsewhere, the show has become a <a href="/wiki/Cult_television" id="w">cult television</a> favourite and has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. It has received <a href="/wiki/#Awards" id="w">recognition</a> from critics and the public as one of the finest British television programmes, including the <a href="/wiki/British_Academy_Television_Awards" id="w">BAFTA Award</a> for <a href="/wiki/British_Academy_Television_Award_for_Best_Drama_Series" id="w">Best Drama Series</a> in 2006.</p>
<p>The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. A <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film)" id="w">television film</a> was made in 1996 as a <a href="/wiki/Backdoor_pilot" id="w">backdoor pilot</a> for a new series (which never entered production), and the programme was successfully <a href="/wiki/History_of_Doctor_Who#The 2000s" id="w">relaunched</a> in 2005, produced <a href="/wiki/In-house" id="w">in-house</a> by <a href="/wiki/BBC_Wales" id="w">BBC Wales</a>. Some development money for the new series is contributed by the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation" id="w">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (CBC), which is credited as a co-producer. <i>Doctor Who</i> has also spawned <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_spin-offs" id="w">spin-offs</a> in multiple media, including the current television programmes <i><a href="/wiki/Torchwood" id="w">Torchwood</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sarah_Jane_Adventures" id="w">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a></i>.</p>
<p>The show&#39;s lead character is currently portrayed by <a href="/wiki/David_Tennant" id="w">David Tennant</a>. A <a href="/wiki/Voyage_of_the_Damned_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Christmas special</a> co-starring <a href="/wiki/Kylie_Minogue" id="w">Kylie Minogue</a> aired in December 2007, and a <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series 4 (2008) and beyond" id="w">fourth series</a>, scheduled to air in 2008, is in production.<sup id="_ref-Series4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Series4" title="">[5]</a></sup>

<i>Doctor Who</i> first appeared on BBC television at 5:15 pm (<a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time" id="w">GMT</a>) on <a href="/wiki/23_November" id="w">23 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a>,<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> following discussions and plans that had been in progress for a year. The <a href="/wiki/BBC_television_drama" id="w">Head of Drama</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Newman" id="w">Sydney Newman</a>, was mainly responsible for developing it, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the Head of the Script Department (later Head of Serials) <a href="/wiki/Donald_Wilson_(writer_and_producer)" id="w">Donald Wilson</a> and staff writer <a href="/wiki/C._E._Webber" id="w">C.

Writer <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Coburn" id="w">Anthony Coburn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Script_editor" id="w">story editor</a> <a href="/wiki/David_Whitaker_(screenwriter)" id="w">David Whitaker</a> and initial <a href="/wiki/Television_producer" id="w">producer</a> <a href="/wiki/Verity_Lambert" id="w">Verity Lambert</a> also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup> The series&#39; title theme was composed by <a href="/wiki/Ron_Grainer" id="w">Ron Grainer</a> and realised by <a href="/wiki/Delia_Derbyshire" id="w">Delia Derbyshire</a> of the <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop" id="w">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a>.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup>  The programme was originally intended to appeal to both children and adults.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup>
The BBC drama department&#39;s Serials division produced the programme for twenty-six series, broadcast on <a href="/wiki/BBC_One" id="w">BBC One</a>. Viewing numbers that had fallen (though comparably increased at some points), a decline in the public perception of the show and a less prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Powell" id="w">Jonathan Powell</a>, Controller of BBC One.<sup id="_ref-powell_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-powell" title="">[16]</a></sup> Although it was for all intents and purposes <a href="/wiki/Cancellation_(television)" id="w">cancelled</a> (as series co-star <a href="/wiki/Sophie_Aldred" id="w">Sophie Aldred</a> reported in the documentary <i>Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS</i>), the BBC said the series would return.</p>
<p>While in-house production had ceased, the BBC was hopeful of finding an independent production company to relaunch the show.  <a href="/wiki/Philip_Segal" id="w">Philip Segal</a>, a British <a href="/wiki/Expatriate" id="w">expatriate</a> who worked for <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" id="w">Columbia Pictures</a>&#39; television arm in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, approached the BBC about such a venture. Segal&#39;s negotiations eventually led to a <a href="/wiki/Television_movie" id="w">television movie</a>. <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film)" id="w">The &#39;&#39;Doctor Who&#39;&#39; television movie</a> was broadcast on the <a href="/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company" id="w">Fox Network</a> in 1996 as a co-production between Fox, <a href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" id="w">Universal Pictures</a>, the BBC, and <a href="/wiki/BBC_Worldwide" id="w">BBC Worldwide</a>. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1 million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_spin-offs" id="w">Licensed</a> media such as novels and audio plays provided new stories, but as a television programme <i>Doctor Who</i> remained dormant until 2003. In September of that year, <a href="/wiki/BBC_Television" id="w">BBC Television</a> announced the in-house production of a new series after several years of unsuccessful attempts by BBC Worldwide to find backing for a feature film version. The new incarnation of the series is executively produced by writer <a href="/wiki/Russell_T_Davies" id="w">Russell T Davies</a> and <a href="/wiki/BBC_Wales" id="w">BBC Wales</a> Head of Drama/BBC Television Controller of Drama Commissioning <a href="/wiki/Julie_Gardner" id="w">Julie Gardner</a>. It has been sold to many other countries worldwide (see <a href="/wiki/#Viewership" id="w">Viewership</a>).</p>
<p>The new series debuted with the episode <a href="/wiki/Rose_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">&#34;Rose&#34;</a> on BBC One on <a href="/wiki/26_March" id="w">26 March</a> <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>. There have been two further series in 2006 and 2007, and Christmas Day specials in 2005, 2006 and 2007.  This will be followed by a fourth series to be shown in 2008.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup>
There will be a rest year in 2009, with no new series, although David Tennant will star in 3 specials in that year. A fifth series is planned for 2010. <sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>

The programme rapidly became a national institution, the subject of countless jokes, newspaper mentions and other popular culture references.<sup id="_ref-screenonline_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-screenonline" title="">[19]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-mobc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-mobc" title="">[20]</a></sup> Many renowned actors asked for or were offered and accepted <a href="/wiki/Celebrity_appearances_in_Doctor_Who" id="w">guest starring roles</a> in various stories. </p>
<p>With popularity came controversy over the show&#39;s suitability for children. Moral campaigner <a href="/wiki/Mary_Whitehouse" id="w">Mary Whitehouse</a> repeatedly complained to the BBC in the 1970s over what she saw as the show&#39;s frightening or gory content.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> The programme became even more popular - especially with children. <a href="/wiki/John_Nathan-Turner" id="w">John Nathan-Turner</a>, who produced the series during the 1980s, was heard to say that he looked forward to Whitehouse&#39;s comments, as the show&#39;s ratings would increase soon after she had made them.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> During the 1970s, the <i><a href="/wiki/Radio_Times" id="w">Radio Times</a></i>, the BBC&#39;s listings magazine, announced that a child&#39;s mother said the theme music terrified her son. The <i>Radio Times</i> was apologetic, but the theme music remained.</p>
<p>There were more complaints about the programme&#39;s content than its music. During <a href="/wiki/Jon_Pertwee" id="w">Jon Pertwee</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season 8 (1971)" id="w">second season</a> as the Doctor, in the serial &#34;<a href="/wiki/Terror_of_the_Autons" id="w">Terror of the Autons</a>&#34; (1971), images of murderous plastic dolls, daffodils killing unsuspecting victims and blank-featured android policemen marked the apex of the show&#39;s ability to frighten children. Other notable moments in that decade included the Doctor apparently being drowned by Chancellor Goth in &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Deadly_Assassin" id="w">The Deadly Assassin</a>&#34; (1976), and the allegedly negative portrayal of Chinese people in &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Talons_of_Weng-Chiang" id="w">The Talons of Weng-Chiang</a>&#34; (1977).</p>
<p>It has been said that watching <i>Doctor Who</i> from a position of safety &#34;<a href="/wiki/Behind_the_sofa" id="w">behind the sofa</a>&#34; (as the <i>Doctor Who</i> exhibition at the <a href="/wiki/Museum_of_the_Moving_Image" id="w">Museum of the Moving Image</a> in London was titled) and peering cautiously out to see if the frightening part was over is one of the great shared experiences of British childhood. The phrase has become commonly used in association with the programme and occasionally elsewhere.</p>

A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that by their own definition of &#34;any act(s) which may cause physical and / or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental&#34;, <i>Doctor Who</i> was the most violent of all the drama programmes the corporation then produced.<sup id="_ref-times-violence_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-times-violence" title="">[23]</a></sup> The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as &#34;very unsuitable&#34; for family viewing.<sup id="_ref-times-audience_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-times-audience" title="">[24]</a></sup> However, responding to the findings of the survey in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" id="w">The Times</a></i> newspaper, journalist <a href="/wiki/Philip_Howard" id="w">Philip Howard</a> maintained that: &#34;to compare the violence of <i>Dr Who</i>, sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing <a href="/wiki/Monopoly_(game)" id="w">Monopoly</a> with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously.&#34;<sup id="_ref-times-violence_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-times-violence" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>The image of the <a href="/wiki/TARDIS" id="w">TARDIS</a> has become firmly linked to the show in the public&#39;s consciousness. In 1996, the BBC applied for a <a href="/wiki/Trademark" id="w">trademark</a> to use the TARDIS&#39; blue <a href="/wiki/Police_box" id="w">police box</a> design in merchandising associated with <i>Doctor Who</i>.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> In 1998, the Metropolitan Police filed an objection to the trademark claim; in 2002 the <a href="/wiki/UK_Intellectual_Property_Office" id="w">Patent Office</a> ruled in favour of the BBC,<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> indicating that the police box image was more associated with <i>Doctor Who</i> than with the police.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The 21st-century revival of the programme has become the centrepiece of BBC One&#39;s Saturday schedule, and has &#34;defined the channel&#34;.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup>  In 2007, <a href="/wiki/Caitlin_Moran" id="w">Caitlin Moran</a>, television reviewer for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" id="w">The Times</a></i>, wrote that <i>Doctor Who</i> is &#34;quintessential to being British&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Moran_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Moran" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Doctor Who</i> originally ran for <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials" id="w">26 seasons</a> on BBC1, from <a href="/wiki/23_November" id="w">23 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1963" id="w">1963</a> until <a href="/wiki/6_December" id="w">6 December</a> <a href="/wiki/1989" id="w">1989</a>. During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or &#34;<a href="/wiki/Serial_(radio_and_television)" id="w">serial</a>&#34;) — usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Notable exceptions were the epic <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daleks%26%2339%3B_Master_Plan" id="w">The Daleks&#39; Master Plan</a></i>, which aired in twelve episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, &#34;<a href="/wiki/Mission_to_the_Unknown" id="w">Mission to the Unknown</a>&#34;, featuring none of the regular cast),<sup id="_ref-MasterPlan_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-MasterPlan" title="">[30]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Invasion3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Invasion3" title="">[31]</a></sup> almost an entire season of 7-episode serials (season 7), the 10-episode serial <i><a href="/wiki/The_War_Games" id="w">The War Games</a></i><sup id="_ref-WarGames_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WarGames" title="">[32]</a></sup> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Trial_of_a_Time_Lord" id="w">The Trial of a Time Lord</a></i>, which ran for 14 episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season 23 (1986)" id="w">Season 23</a>.<sup id="_ref-Trial_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Trial" title="">[33]</a></sup> Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a storyline, such as <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season 16 (1978–79)" id="w">Season 16&#39;s</a> quest for <a href="/wiki/The_Key_to_Time" id="w">the Key to Time</a> or <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season 18 (1980–81)" id="w">Season 18&#39;s</a> journey through <a href="/wiki/E-Space" id="w">E-Space</a> and the theme of entropy.</p>
<p>The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule. Initially, it alternated stories set in the past, which would teach younger audience members about history, with stories set either in the future or in outer space to teach them about science. This was also reflected in the Doctor&#39;s original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.</p>
<p>However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme and the &#34;historicals&#34;, which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after <i><a href="/wiki/The_Highlanders_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">The Highlanders</a></i> (1967). While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: <i><a href="/wiki/Black_Orchid_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Black Orchid</a></i> set in 1920s Britain.<sup id="_ref-Orchid_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Orchid" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
<p>The early stories were more serial-like in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes. Following <i><a href="/wiki/The_Gunfighters" id="w">The Gunfighters</a></i> (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, with the individual parts simply being assigned episode numbers. What to name these earlier stories is often <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_story_title_debate" id="w">a subject of fan debate</a>.</p>
<p>Writers during the original run included <a href="/wiki/Terry_Nation" id="w">Terry Nation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Lincoln" id="w">Henry Lincoln</a>, <a href="/wiki/Douglas_Adams" id="w">Douglas Adams</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Holmes_(scriptwriter)" id="w">Robert Holmes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Terrance_Dicks" id="w">Terrance Dicks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dennis_Spooner" id="w">Dennis Spooner</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eric_Saward" id="w">Eric Saward</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_Hulke" id="w">Malcolm Hulke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Christopher_H._Bidmead" id="w">Christopher H.

<p>The serial format changed for the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Ninth Doctor .28Christopher Eccleston.29" id="w">2005 revival</a>, with each series consisting of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes, with adverts, on overseas commercial channels). Each series includes several standalone and multi-part stories, linked with a loose story arc that resolves in the series finale. As in the early &#34;classic&#34; era, each episode — whether standalone or part of a larger story — has its own title.</p>
<p>737 <i>Doctor Who</i> instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging from 25-minute episodes (the most common format), to 45-minute episodes (for <i><a href="/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_Daleks" id="w">Resurrection of the Daleks</a></i> in the 1984 series, a single season in 1985, and the revival), to two feature-length productions (1983&#39;s &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Five_Doctors" id="w">The Five Doctors</a>&#34; and the <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film)" id="w">1996 television movie</a>), to the two 60-minute <a href="/wiki/Christmas_special#Television_series_specials" id="w">Christmas specials</a> produced for the revival. </p>

In all, <a href="/wiki/List_of_incomplete_Doctor_Who_serials" id="w">108</a> of 253 episodes produced during the first six years of the programme are not held in the BBC&#39;s archives. It has been reported that in 1972 almost all episodes then made were known to exist at the BBC,<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> whilst by 1978 the practice of wiping tapes had ended.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some episodes have been returned to the BBC from the archives of other countries who bought copies for broadcast, or by private individuals who got them by various means. Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved, as well as excerpts filmed off the television screen onto 8 mm <a href="/wiki/Cine_film" id="w">cine film</a> and clips that were shown on other programmes. Audio versions of all of the lost episodes exist from home viewers who made tape recordings of the show. </p>
<p>In addition to these, there are off-screen photographs made by photographer <a href="/wiki/John_Cura" id="w">John Cura</a>, who was hired by various production personnel to document many of their programmes during the 1950s and 1960s, including <i>Doctor Who</i>. These have been used in fan reconstructions of the serials. These amateur reconstructions have been tolerated by the BBC, provided they are not sold for profit and are distributed as low quality VHS copies.</p>

One of the most sought-after lost episodes is Part Four of the last William Hartnell serial, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Tenth_Planet" id="w">The Tenth Planet</a></i> (1966), which ends with the <a href="/wiki/First_Doctor" id="w">First Doctor</a> transforming into the <a href="/wiki/Second_Doctor" id="w">Second</a>. The only portion of this in existence, barring a few poor quality silent 8 mm clips, is the few seconds of the regeneration scene, thanks to it having been shown on the children&#39;s magazine show <i><a href="/wiki/Blue_Peter" id="w">Blue Peter</a></i>. With the approval of the BBC, efforts are now under way to restore as many of the episodes as possible from the extant material.
Starting in the early 1990s, the BBC began to release audio recordings of missing serials on cassette and compact disc, with linking narration provided by former series actors. &#34;Official&#34; reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on <a href="/wiki/MP3" id="w">MP3</a> <a href="/wiki/CD-ROM" id="w">CD-ROM</a> and as a special feature on a DVD. The BBC, in conjunction with animation studio <a href="/wiki/Cosgrove_Hall" id="w">Cosgrove Hall</a> has reconstructed the missing Episodes 1 and 4 of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Invasion_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">The Invasion</a></i> (1968) in animated form, using remastered audio tracks and the comprehensive stage notes for the original filming, for the serial&#39;s DVD release in November 2006. Although no similar reconstructions have been announced as of early 2007, Cosgrove Hall has expressed an interest in animating more lost episodes in the future,<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> despite the announcement in April 2007 that this project is on indefinite hiatus.</p>
<p>In April 2006, <i><a href="/wiki/Blue_Peter" id="w">Blue Peter</a></i> launched a challenge to find these missing episodes with the promise of a full scale <a href="/wiki/Dalek" id="w">Dalek</a> model.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>

The character of the Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery. All that was known about him in the programme&#39;s early days was that he was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable old time machine called the <a href="/wiki/TARDIS" id="w">TARDIS</a>, <i>TARDIS</i> being an abbreviation for <b>T</b>ime <b>A</b>nd <b>R</b>elative <b>D</b>imension <b>I</b>n <b>S</b>pace. The TARDIS is much larger on the inside than on the outside<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> and, due to a chronic malfunction, is stuck in the shape of a 1950s-style British <a href="/wiki/Police_box" id="w">police box</a>.</p>
<p>However, not only did the initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellow into a more compassionate figure, it was eventually revealed that he had been on the run from his own people, the <a href="/wiki/Time_Lord" id="w">Time Lords</a> of the planet <a href="/wiki/Gallifrey" id="w">Gallifrey</a>. </p>
<p>As a Time Lord, the Doctor has the ability to &#34;<a href="/wiki/Regeneration_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">regenerate</a>&#34; his body when near death. Introduced into the storyline as a way of continuing the series when the writers were faced with the departure of lead actor <a href="/wiki/William_Hartnell" id="w">William Hartnell</a> in 1966, it has continued to be a major element of the series, allowing for the recasting of the lead actor when the need arises. The serial <i><a href="/wiki/The_Deadly_Assassin" id="w">The Deadly Assassin</a></i> established that a Time Lord can regenerate twelve times, for a total of thirteen incarnations (although at least one Time Lord, <a href="/wiki/The_Master_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">The Master</a>, has managed to circumvent this). To date, the Doctor has gone through this process and its resulting after-effects on nine occasions, with each of his incarnations having his own quirks and abilities but otherwise sharing the memories and experience of the previous incarnations:</p>

<p>Other actors have also played the Doctor, though rarely more than once (see the <a href="/wiki/List_of_actors_who_have_played_the_Doctor" id="w">list of actors who have played the Doctor</a> for details). </p>
<p>Despite these shifts in personality, the Doctor has always remained an intensely curious and highly moral adventurer, who would rather solve problems with his wits than through violence. </p>
<p>Throughout the programme&#39;s long history certain controversial revelations about the Doctor have been made. For example, in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Brain_of_Morbius" id="w">The Brain of Morbius</a></i> (1976), it was hinted that the <a href="/wiki/First_Doctor" id="w">First Doctor</a> may not have been the Doctor&#39;s first incarnation (although the other faces depicted may have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius); during the <a href="/wiki/Seventh_Doctor" id="w">Seventh Doctor</a>&#39;s era it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the <a href="/wiki/Eighth_Doctor" id="w">Eighth Doctor</a> movie, it was suggested that the Doctor was &#34;half human&#34;, though the canonicity of this is highly contested.  He does physically become a human in the 10th Doctor story, &#34;Human Nature&#34;. The very first episode, <i><a href="/wiki/An_Unearthly_Child" id="w">An Unearthly Child</a></i>, revealed that the <a href="/wiki/First_Doctor" id="w">Doctor</a> has a granddaughter, <a href="/wiki/Susan_Foreman" id="w">Susan Foreman</a>, and in &#34;<a href="/wiki/Fear_Her" id="w">Fear Her</a>&#34; (2006), he remarked that he had, in the past, been a father. The 2005 series revealed that the <a href="/wiki/Ninth_Doctor" id="w">Ninth Doctor</a> thought he had become the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed.</p>
<a id="Companions" name="Companions"></a><h3>Companions</h3>
<p>{{main}}
The Doctor almost always shares his adventures with up to three <a href="/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">companions</a>, and since 1963 more than 35 actors and actresses have featured in these roles. The First Doctor&#39;s original companions were his granddaughter <a href="/wiki/Susan_Foreman" id="w">Susan Foreman</a> (<a href="/wiki/Carole_Ann_Ford" id="w">Carole Ann Ford</a>) and school teachers <a href="/wiki/Barbara_Wright_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Barbara Wright</a> (<a href="/wiki/Jacqueline_Hill" id="w">Jacqueline Hill</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Ian_Chesterton" id="w">Ian Chesterton</a> (<a href="/wiki/William_Russell_(actor)" id="w">William Russell</a>). The only episode of the original series in which the Doctor travels alone was <i>The Deadly Assassin</i>. </p>
<p>Dramatically, the <a href="/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">companion</a> characters provide a <a href="/wiki/Audience_surrogate" id="w">surrogate</a> with whom the audience can identify, and serves to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes — or loves — on worlds they have visited. Some have even died during the course of the series.</p>
<p>Although the majority of the Doctor&#39;s companions have been young, attractive females, the production team for the 1963–1989 series maintained a long-standing taboo against any overt romantic involvement in the TARDIS. The taboo was controversially broken in the 1996 television film when the <a href="/wiki/Eighth_Doctor" id="w">Eighth Doctor</a> was shown kissing companion <a href="/wiki/Grace_Holloway" id="w">Grace Holloway</a>. The 2005 series played with this idea by having various characters think that the Ninth Doctor and <a href="/wiki/Rose_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Rose</a> (played by <a href="/wiki/Billie_Piper" id="w">Billie Piper</a>) were a couple, which they vehemently denied (see also <a href="/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)#Romance" id="w">&#34;The Doctor and romance&#34;</a>). The idea of a possible involvement was suggested again in &#34;<a href="/wiki/Smith_and_Jones_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Smith and Jones</a>&#34;, when the Tenth Doctor kisses his soon-to-be new companion <a href="/wiki/Martha_Jones" id="w">Martha Jones</a>, although the Doctor insists that the kiss was simply for the purpose of &#39;genetic transfer&#39;.</p>
<p>Previous companions have reappeared in the series, usually for anniversary specials. One former companion, <a href="/wiki/Sarah_Jane_Smith" id="w">Sarah Jane Smith</a> (played by <a href="/wiki/Elisabeth_Sladen" id="w">Elisabeth Sladen</a>), together with the robotic dog <a href="/wiki/K-9_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">K-9</a>, appeared in <a href="/wiki/School_Reunion_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">an episode</a> of the 2006 series more than twenty years after their last appearances in the 20th Anniversary story &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Five_Doctors" id="w">The Five Doctors</a>&#34; (1983). Afterwards, the character was featured in the spinoff series <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sarah_Jane_Adventures" id="w">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a></i>.</p>
<p>The most recent companions of the Tenth Doctor (<a href="/wiki/David_Tennant" id="w">David Tennant</a>) are <a href="/wiki/Martha_Jones" id="w">Martha Jones</a> (<a href="/wiki/Freema_Agyeman" id="w">Freema Agyeman</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Jack_Harkness" id="w">Captain Jack Harkness</a> (<a href="/wiki/John_Barrowman" id="w">John Barrowman</a>), both of whom depart at the end of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Last_of_the_Time_Lords" id="w">Last of the Time Lords</a>&#34;. <a href="/wiki/Catherine_Tate" id="w">Catherine Tate</a> will reprise her role as <a href="/wiki/Donna_Noble" id="w">Donna Noble</a> from the 2006 Christmas special, becoming the Doctor&#39;s companion for the entire run of the fourth series.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> Agyeman will appear as Martha Jones in three episodes of the spin-off series <i>Torchwood</i> before returning to <i>Doctor Who</i> halfway through the fourth series.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup>. <a href="/wiki/Billie_Piper" id="w">Billie Piper</a> will reprise her role as <a href="/wiki/Rose_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Rose Tyler</a> for a rumored three episodes of season four in 2008. <sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> For the 2007 Christmas episode,<a href="/wiki/Voyage_of_the_Damned_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Voyage of the Damned</a>, The Doctor&#39;s companion was <a href="/wiki/Astrid_Peth" id="w">Astrid Peth</a>, played by Australian performer <a href="/wiki/Kylie_Minogue" id="w">Kylie Minogue</a>.</p>

When Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the cliché of the &#34;bug-eyed monster&#34; of science fiction. However, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_monsters_and_aliens" id="w">monsters</a> were a staple of <i>Doctor Who</i> almost from the beginning and were popular with audiences. </p>
<p>Notable adversaries of the Doctor in the original series include the <a href="/wiki/Auton" id="w">Autons</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Cyberman" id="w">Cybermen</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Sontaran" id="w">Sontarans</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Zygons" id="w">Zygons</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Sea_Devil_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Sea Devils</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Silurian_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Silurians</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Ice_Warrior" id="w">Ice Warriors</a>, the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_monsters_and_aliens#Wirrn" id="w">Wirrn</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Yeti_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Yeti</a>, <a href="/wiki/Davros" id="w">Davros</a> (the creator of the Daleks), <a href="/wiki/Master_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">the Master</a> (a Time Lord with a thirst for universal conquest), and, most notably, the <a href="/wiki/Dalek" id="w">Daleks</a>. This continued with the resurrection of the series in 2005, which has featured the Daleks, the Cybermen, the Master and, less prominently, the Autons and the Macra. The new series has also introduced new monsters, including the <a href="/wiki/Slitheen" id="w">Slitheen</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Ood" id="w">Ood</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Judoon" id="w">Judoon</a>.

<a id="Daleks" name="Daleks"></a><h3>Daleks</h3>
<p>{{main}}
Of all the monsters and villains, the ones that have most secured the series&#39; place in the public&#39;s imagination are the <a href="/wiki/Dalek" id="w">Daleks</a>. The Daleks are Kaled mutants in tank-like mechanical armour shells from the planet <a href="/wiki/Skaro" id="w">Skaro</a>. Their chief role in the great scheme of things, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognizable metallic voices, is to &#34;Exterminate!&#34; all beings inferior to themselves, even destroying the <a href="/wiki/Time_Lords" id="w">Time Lords</a> in the often referenced but never shown <a href="/wiki/Time_War_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Time War</a>. <a href="/wiki/Davros" id="w">Davros</a>, the Daleks&#39; creator, became a recurring villain after he was introduced in <i><a href="/wiki/Genesis_of_the_Daleks" id="w">Genesis of the Daleks</a></i>, in which the Time Lords send the Doctor back to either destroy the Daleks, avert their creation, or tamper with their genetic structure to make them less warlike.</p>
<p>The Daleks were created by writer <a href="/wiki/Terry_Nation" id="w">Terry Nation</a> (who intended them as an <a href="/wiki/Allegory" id="w">allegory</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Nazism" id="w">Nazis</a>) and BBC designer <a href="/wiki/Raymond_Cusick" id="w">Raymond Cusick</a>. The Daleks&#39; début in the programme&#39;s second serial, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daleks" id="w">The Daleks</a></i> (1963–64), caused a tremendous reaction in the viewing figures and the public, putting <i>Doctor Who</i> on the cultural map. A Dalek appeared on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by <a href="/wiki/Antony_Armstrong-Jones%2C_1st_Earl_of_Snowdon" id="w">Lord Snowdon</a>.</p>

The original 1963 <a href="/wiki/Radiophonic" id="w">radiophonic</a> arrangement of the <i>Doctor Who</i> theme is widely regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, and <i>Doctor Who</i> was the first television series in the world to have a theme entirely realised through electronic means. </p>
<p>The original theme was composed by <a href="/wiki/Ron_Grainer" id="w">Ron Grainer</a> and realised by <a href="/wiki/Delia_Derbyshire" id="w">Delia Derbyshire</a> at the <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop" id="w">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a>, with assistance from <a href="/wiki/Dick_Mills" id="w">Dick Mills</a>. The various parts were built up by creating <a href="/wiki/Tape_loop" id="w">tape loops</a> of an individually struck piano string and individual test <a href="/wiki/Oscillator" id="w">oscillators</a> and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season 17 (1979-80)" id="w">Season 17</a> (1979–80).</p>
<p>A more modern and dynamic arrangement was composed by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Howell" id="w">Peter Howell</a> for <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season 18 (1980-81)" id="w">Season 18</a> (1980), which was in turn replaced by <a href="/wiki/Dominic_Glynn" id="w">Dominic Glynn</a>&#39;s arrangement for Season 23&#39;s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Trial_of_a_Time_Lord" id="w">The Trial of a Time Lord</a></i> (1986). <a href="/wiki/Keff_McCulloch" id="w">Keff McCulloch</a> provided the new arrangement for the <a href="/wiki/Seventh_Doctor" id="w">Seventh Doctor</a>&#39;s era which lasted from <a href="/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Season 24 (1987)" id="w">Season 24</a> (1987) until the series&#39; suspension in 1989. For the new series in 2005, <a href="/wiki/Murray_Gold" id="w">Murray Gold</a> provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Christmas_Invasion" id="w">The Christmas Invasion</a>&#34;, Gold introduced a modified closing credits arrangement that has been used ever since.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, <a href="/wiki/Jon_Pertwee" id="w">Jon Pertwee</a>, who had played the <a href="/wiki/Third_Doctor" id="w">Third Doctor</a>, recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, &#34;Who Is the Doctor&#34;. In 1988 the band <a href="/wiki/The_Justified_Ancients_of_Mu_Mu" id="w">The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu</a> (later known as <a href="/wiki/The_KLF" id="w">The KLF</a>) released the single &#34;<a href="/wiki/Doctorin%26%2339%3B_the_Tardis" id="w">Doctorin&#39; the Tardis</a>&#34; under the name <a href="/wiki/The_Timelords" id="w">The Timelords</a>, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia.

A reggae/ska version of the Dr Who theme tune was released on the Explosion label in 1969 by Bongo Herman and Les. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs and has made its way into <a href="/wiki/Mobile_phone" id="w">mobile phone</a> ring tones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme.</p>
<p>In &#34;<a href="/wiki/Voyage_of_the_Damned_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Voyage of the Damned</a>&#34;, the theme is slightly different, as revealed in December 2007 on <i><a href="/wiki/Newsround" id="w">Newsround</a></i>.</p>
<a id="Incidental_music" name="Incidental_music"></a><h3>Incidental music</h3>
<p>Most of the innovative incidental music for <i>Doctor Who</i> has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, although in the early years some episodes also used <a href="/wiki/Royalty_free_music" id="w">stock music</a>, as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or <a href="/wiki/Cover_version" id="w">cover versions</a> of songs by popular music acts such as <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" id="w">The Beatles</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Beach_Boys" id="w">The Beach Boys</a>.</p>

Many of the stories of the <a href="/wiki/William_Hartnell" id="w">William Hartnell</a> period were scored by electronic music pioneer <a href="/wiki/Tristram_Cary" id="w">Tristram Cary</a>, whose <i>Doctor Who</i> credits include <i>The Daleks</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Marco_Polo_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Marco Polo</a></i>, <i>The Daleks&#39; Master Plan</i>, <i>The Gunfighters</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Mutants" id="w">The Mutants</a></i>. Other composers in this early period were included <a href="/wiki/Richard_Rodney_Bennett" id="w">Richard Rodney Bennett</a>, <a href="/wiki/Carey_Blyton" id="w">Carey Blyton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Burgon" id="w">Geoffrey Burgon</a>.</p>
<p>The most frequent musical contributor during the first fifteen years was <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Simpson" id="w">Dudley Simpson</a>, who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for <i><a href="/wiki/Blake%26%2339%3Bs_7" id="w">Blake&#39;s 7</a></i>. Simpson&#39;s first <i>Doctor Who</i> score was <i><a href="/wiki/Planet_of_Giants" id="w">Planet of Giants</a></i> (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the Sixties and Seventies, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee / Tom Baker periods, ending with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Horns_of_Nimon" id="w">The Horns of Nimon</a></i> (1979). He also made a <a href="/wiki/Cameo_appearance" id="w">cameo appearance</a> in <i>The Talons of Weng-Chiang</i> (as a <a href="/wiki/Music-hall" id="w">music-hall</a> conductor).</p>
<p>Beginning with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Leisure_Hive" id="w">The Leisure Hive</a></i> (1980), the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. <a href="/wiki/Paddy_Kingsland" id="w">Paddy Kingsland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peter_Howell" id="w">Peter Howell</a> contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included <a href="/wiki/Roger_Limb" id="w">Roger Limb</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_Clarke" id="w">Malcolm Clarke</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Gibbs_(composer)" id="w">Jonathan Gibbs</a>.</p>
<p>The Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after the <i><a href="/wiki/The_Trial_of_a_Time_Lord" id="w">The Trial of a Time Lord</a></i> season, and <a href="/wiki/Keff_McCulloch" id="w">Keff McCulloch</a> took over as the series&#39; main composer, with <a href="/wiki/Dominic_Glynn" id="w">Dominic Glynn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mark_Ayres" id="w">Mark Ayres</a> also contributing scores.</p>
<p>All the incidental music for the 2005 revived series has been composed by Murray Gold and Ben Foster and has been performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales from the 2005 Christmas episode <i>The Christmas Invasion</i> onwards. A concert featuring the orchestra performing music from the first two series took place on 19th November 2006 to raise money for <a href="/wiki/Children_in_Need" id="w">Children in Need</a>. <a href="/wiki/David_Tennant" id="w">David Tennant</a> hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert. <a href="/wiki/Murray_Gold" id="w">Murray Gold</a> and <a href="/wiki/Russell_T._Davies" id="w">Russell T.

The concert aired on <a href="/wiki/BBCi" id="w">BBCi</a> on Christmas Day 2006.</p>
<p>The new series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the Eighties, Nineties and early 2000s, including works by <a href="/wiki/Soft_Cell" id="w">Soft Cell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rogue_Traders" id="w">Rogue Traders</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Scissor_Sisters" id="w">Scissor Sisters</a>.

<a id="%22Special_sound%22" name="%22Special_sound%22"></a><h3>&#34;Special sound&#34;</h3>
<p><i>Doctor Who<b>s science-fiction themes and settings meant that many sound effects had to be specially created for the series, although some common sound effects (such as crowds, horses and jungle noises) were sourced from stock recordings. Because <i>Doctor Who</i> began several years before the advent of the first mass-produced <a href="/wiki/Synthesiser" id="w">synthesisers</a>, much of the equipment used to create electronic sound effects in the early days was custom-built by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and until the early 1970s audio effects were realised using a combination of electronic and <a href="/wiki/Radiophonic" id="w">radiophonic</a> techniques.</b></i></p>
<p>Almost all of the original sound effects and audio backgrounds during the 1960s were realised by the Radiophonic Workshop&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Brian_Hodgson" id="w">Brian Hodgson</a>, who worked on <i>Doctor Who</i> from its inception until the middle of Jon Pertwee&#39;s tenure in the early 1970s, when he was succeeded by <a href="/wiki/Dick_Mills" id="w">Dick Mills</a>. Hodgson created hundreds of pieces of &#34;special sound&#34; ranging from ray-gun blasts to dinosaurs, but without doubt his best known sound effects are the sound of the TARDIS as it de-materialises and re-appears, and the voices of the <a href="/wiki/Daleks" id="w">Daleks</a>. </p>
<p>The basic audio source Hodgson used for the TARDIS effect was the sound of his house keys being scraped up and down along the strings of an old gutted piano, and played backwards. The famous Dalek voice effect was obtained by passing the actors&#39; voices through a device called a <a href="/wiki/Ring_modulator" id="w">ring modulator</a>, and it was further enhanced by exploiting the <a href="/wiki/Distortion" id="w">distortion</a> inherent in the microphones and amplifiers then in use. However, the precise sonic character of the Daleks&#39; voices varied somewhat over time because the original frequency settings used on the ring modulator were never noted down.</p>

<i>Doctor Who</i> has always appeared on the BBC&#39;s mainstream <a href="/wiki/BBC_One" id="w">BBC One</a> channel, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers. It was most popular in the late 1970s, with audiences frequently as high as 12 million. During the <a href="/wiki/ITV" id="w">ITV</a> network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16 million. No first-run episode of <i>Doctor Who</i> has ever drawn fewer than three million viewers on BBC One, although its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time and was, according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme&#39;s 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the <a href="/wiki/Soap_opera" id="w">soap opera</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Coronation_Street" id="w">Coronation Street</a></i>, the most popular show at the time. The BBC One broadcast of &#34;<a href="/wiki/Rose_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Rose</a>&#34;, the first episode of the 2005 revival, drew an average audience of 10.81 million, third highest for BBC One that week and seventh across all channels. The 2005 series had an average audience of 7.91 million viewers, the 2006 series achieved an average audience of about 7.85 million, and the 2007 series achieved 7.54 million in the context of declining year-to-year viewership for all television channels. The 2006 episode &#34;<a href="/wiki/Rise_of_the_Cybermen" id="w">Rise of the Cybermen</a>&#34; managed sixth place in the charts across the week with 9.22 million viewers.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> The all-time highest chart placing for an episode of <i>Doctor Who</i> is fifth, for episode two of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Ark_in_Space" id="w">The Ark in Space</a></i> in 1975.</p>
<p>The programme also gained a <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_in_Australia" id="w">strong following in Australia</a>, possibly as a result of the close connection between the BBC and Australia&#39;s major public broadcaster, <a href="/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" id="w">ABC</a>. The latest repeat of the classic series in Australia ran from September 2003 to February 2006, and the revived series has also been shown on ABC and <a href="/wiki/UK.TV" id="w">UK.TV</a>.</p>
<p>The series also has a fan base in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>, where it was shown in syndication from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly on <a href="/wiki/PBS" id="w">PBS</a> stations (see <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Who_in_America" id="w">Doctor Who in America</a>). <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" id="w">New Zealand</a> was the first country outside the UK to screen <i>Doctor Who</i> beginning in September 1964, and continued to screen the series for many years, including the new series from 2005. In <a href="/wiki/Canada" id="w">Canada</a>, the series debuted in January 1965, but the CBC only aired the first twenty-six episodes. <a href="/wiki/TVOntario" id="w">TVOntario</a> picked up the show in 1976 beginning with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Three_Doctors" id="w">The Three Doctors</a></i> and aired it through to Season 24 in 1991. TVO&#39;s schedule ran several years behind the BBC&#39;s throughout this period. In the 1970s TVO airings were bookended by a host who would introduce the episode and then, after the episode concluded, try to place it in an educational context in keeping with TVO&#39;s status as an educational channel. The airing of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Talons_of_Weng_Chiang" id="w">The Talons of Weng Chiang</a></i> resulted in controversy for TVOntario as a result of accusations that the story was <a href="/wiki/Racism" id="w">racist</a>. Consequently the story was not rebroadcast. CBC began showing the series again in 2005.</p>
<p>Only four episodes have ever had their premier showings on channels other than BBC One. The 1983 twentieth anniversary special &#34;<a href="/wiki/The_Five_Doctors" id="w">The Five Doctors</a>&#34; had its début on <a href="/wiki/23_November" id="w">23 November</a> (the actual date of the anniversary) on the <a href="/wiki/Chicago" id="w">Chicago</a> <a href="/wiki/PBS" id="w">PBS</a> station <a href="/wiki/WTTW-TV" id="w">WTTW</a> in the United States and various other PBS members two days prior to its BBC One broadcast. The 1988 story <i><a href="/wiki/Silver_Nemesis" id="w">Silver Nemesis</a></i> was broadcast with all three episodes edited together in compilation form on <a href="/wiki/TVNZ" id="w">TVNZ</a> in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there. Finally, the 1996 television film premièred on <a href="/wiki/12_May" id="w">12 May</a> <a href="/wiki/1996" id="w">1996</a> on <a href="/wiki/CITV-TV" id="w">CITV</a> in <a href="/wiki/Edmonton%2C_Alberta" id="w">Edmonton</a>, Canada, fifteen days before the BBC One showing, and two days before it aired on <a href="/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company" id="w">Fox</a> in the US.</p>
<p>A wide selection of serials is available from BBC Video on <a href="/wiki/VHS" id="w">VHS</a> and <a href="/wiki/DVD" id="w">DVD</a>, on sale in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States. Every fully extant serial has been released on VHS, and BBC Worldwide continues to regularly release serials on DVD.

There were two &#34;Dr. Who&#34; cinema films: <i><a href="/wiki/Dr._Who_and_the_Daleks" id="w">Dr. Who and the Daleks</a></i> in 1965 and <i><a href="/wiki/Daleks_-_Invasion_Earth_2150_AD" id="w">Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD</a></i> in 1966.

<p>In these films, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Cushing" id="w">Peter Cushing</a> played a human scientist named <a href="/wiki/Dr._Who_(Dalek_films)" id="w">Dr. Who</a>, who travelled with his two granddaughters and other companions in a time machine he invented. Due to this and numerous other changes (not to mention the storylines that duplicated televised episodes), the movies are not regarded as part of the ongoing continuity of the series, although the Cushing version of the character would reappear in both comic strip and literary form, the latter attempting to reconcile the film continuity with that of the series.</p>

<p>In 1993, coinciding with the series&#39; 30th anniversary, a charity special entitled &#34;<a href="/wiki/Dimensions_in_Time" id="w">Dimensions in Time</a>&#34; was produced in aid of <a href="/wiki/Children_in_Need" id="w">Children in Need</a>, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. Not taken seriously by many, the story had the <a href="/wiki/Rani_(Doctor_Who)" id="w">Rani</a> opening a hole in time, cycling the Doctor and his companions through his previous incarnations and menacing them with monsters from the show&#39;s past.
