The <b>Susquehanna River</b> (originally &#34;Sasquesahanough&#34; per the <a href="/wiki/1612" id="w">1612</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Smith_of_Jamestown" id="w">John Smith</a> map) is a <a href="/wiki/River" id="w">river</a> located in the northeastern <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. At approximately 444&#160;<a href="/wiki/Mile" id="w">mi</a> (715&#160;<a href="/wiki/Kilometre" id="w">km</a>) long, it is the longest river on the <a href="/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States" id="w">American east coast</a> and the 16th longest in the United States.  The Susquehanna forms from two main branches, with the North Branch, which rises in upstate <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> often regarded as an extension of the main branch.  The shorter <a href="/wiki/West_Branch_Susquehanna_River" id="w">West Branch</a>, which rises in western <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania</a>, is sometimes regarded as the principal tributary, joining the North Branch near <a href="/wiki/Northumberland%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Northumberland</a> in central Pennsylvania.  The river drains 27,500&#160;square miles (71,225&#160;km²), covering nearly half of the land area of Pennsylvania and portions of New York and Maryland.  The drainage basin includes portions of the <a href="/wiki/Allegheny_Plateau" id="w">Allegheny Plateau</a> region of the <a href="/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains" id="w">Appalachian Mountains</a>, cutting through <a href="/wiki/Water_gap" id="w">water gaps</a> in the lateral mountain ridges in a broad <a href="/wiki/Zigzag" id="w">zigzag</a> course to flow across the rural heartland of southeastern Pennsylvania and northeastern <a href="/wiki/Maryland" id="w">Maryland</a>.  The river empties into the northern end of the <a href="/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay" id="w">Chesapeake Bay</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Ria" id="w">ria</a> of the Susquehanna, providing half of the freshwater inflow for the entire Chesapeake Bay. </p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Geology" id="w">Geologically</a>, the river is extremely ancient, often regarded as the oldest or second oldest major system in the world. {{Fact}} It is far older than the mountain ridges through which it turns, most of which were formed in uplift events of the early <a href="/wiki/Cenozoic" id="w">Cenozoic</a> era. Like the <a href="/wiki/Hudson_River" id="w">Hudson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Delaware_River" id="w">Delaware</a> and <a href="/wiki/Potomac_River" id="w">Potomac</a> rivers, the basin was well-established in the <a href="/wiki/Geology_of_the_Appalachians" id="w">flat plains that existed</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Mesozoic" id="w">Mesozoic</a> era.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> There is evidence that the flow of the ancient Susquehanna was established early enough that it predated the <a href="/wiki/Appalachian_orogeny" id="w">Appalachian orogeny</a> over 300 million years ago, meaning that the river was in existence well before <a href="/wiki/Pangea" id="w">Pangea</a> broke up and formed the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a>. {{Fact}}</p>

The environmental group American Rivers named the Susquehanna &#34;America&#39;s Most Endangered River for 2005&#34; due to the excessive pollution it receives. Most of the pollution in the river is due to excess animal manure, agricultural runoff, urban and suburban stormwater, and raw or inadequately treated sewage. In 2003 the river alone contributed 44% of the nitrogen, 21% of the phosphorus, and 21% of the sediment flowing into the Chesapeake Bay. Pennsylvania may be subject to <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" id="w">EPA</a> sanctions if it does not reduce its pollution in the watershed by 2010. <a class="externallink" href="http://www.cbf.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&#38;id=10769" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cbf.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&#38;id=10769">http://www.cbf.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&#38;id=10769</a>

<p>The river has played an enormous role throughout the history of the United States. Before European conquest, the <a href="/wiki/Susquehannock" id="w">Susquehannock</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Iroquoian" id="w">Iroquoian</a> tribe lived along the river and gave the Susquehanna its name. In the 17th century, it was inhabited largely by the <a href="/wiki/Lenape" id="w">Lenape</a>, forming roughly the western boundary of their inhabited territory, known as <a href="/wiki/Lenapehoking" id="w">Lenapehoking</a>. In the 18th century, <a href="/wiki/William_Penn" id="w">William Penn</a>, the founder of the <a href="/wiki/Province_of_Pennsylvania" id="w">Pennsylvania Colony</a>, negotiated with the Lenape to allow white settlement in the colony between the <a href="/wiki/Delaware_River" id="w">Delaware River</a> and the Susquehanna. Local legend claims that the name of the river comes from an Indian phrase meaning &#34;mile wide, foot deep,&#34; referring to the Susquehanna&#39;s unusual dimensions, but while the word is <a href="/wiki/Algonquian_languages" id="w">Algonquian</a>, it simply means &#34;muddy current.&#34;<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the late colonial times, the river became an increasingly important transportation corridor with the discovery of <a href="/wiki/Anthracite_coal" id="w">anthracite coal</a> by Necho Allen in its upper reaches in the mountains. In 1792, the <a href="/wiki/Union_Canal_(Pennsylvania)" id="w">Union Canal</a> was proposed linking the Susquehanna and the Delaware along Swatara Creek and <a href="/wiki/Tulpehocken_Creek_(Pennsylvania)" id="w">Tulpehocken Creek</a>. In the 19th century, the river became the scene of the growth of industrial centers.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/1779" id="w">1779</a> General <a href="/wiki/James_Clinton" id="w">James Clinton</a> led an expedition down the Susquehanna after making the upper portion navigable by damming up the river&#39;s source at Otsego Lake, allowing the lake&#39;s level to rise, and then destroying the dam and flooding the river for miles downstream.  This event is described by <a href="/wiki/James_Fenimore_Cooper" id="w">James Fenimore Cooper</a> in the introduction to his popular novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Pioneers" id="w">The Pioneers</a></i>. At <a href="/wiki/Tioga%2C_New_York" id="w">Tioga, New York</a>, Clinton met up with General <a href="/wiki/John_Sullivan" id="w">John Sullivan</a>&#39;s forces, who had marched from <a href="/wiki/Easton%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Easton, Pennsylvania</a>. Together on <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>, they defeated the <a href="/wiki/Tory" id="w">Tories</a> and <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Indians</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Newtown" id="w">Battle of Newtown</a> (near today&#39;s city of <a href="/wiki/Elmira%2C_New_York" id="w">Elmira, New York</a>).

<p>The Susquehanna River has always loomed large in the transportation history of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>.  Prior to the 1818 opening of the <a href="/wiki/Port_Deposit_Bridge" id="w">Port Deposit Bridge</a>, the river formed a barrier between the northern and southern states, crossable only by ferry.  The earliest dams were constructed to support ferry operations in low water.  The presence of many rapids in the river meant that while commercial traffic could navigate down the river in the spring thaws, nothing could move up.  This led to the construction of two different canal systems on the lower Susquehanna; the first was the <a href="/wiki/Susquehanna_and_Tidewater_Canal#Susquehanna Canal" id="w">Susquehanna Canal</a>, also called the Conowingo Canal or the Port Deposit Canal, completed in 1802 by a Maryland company known as the Proprietors of the Susquehanna Canal; the second was the much longer and more successful <a href="/wiki/Susquehanna_and_Tidewater_Canal" id="w">Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal</a>. The canals required additional dams to provide canal water and navigation pools.  As the industrial age progressed, bridges replaced ferries, and railroads replaced canals, often built right on top of the canal right of way along the river. Many canal remnants can be seen in <a href="/wiki/Havre_de_Grace%2C_Maryland" id="w">Havre de Grace, Maryland</a>, along <a href="/wiki/US_Route_15" id="w">US Route 15</a> in Pennsylvania, and in upstate New York at various locations. These latter remnants are parts of the upstream divisions of the <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania_Canal" id="w">Pennsylvania Canal</a>, of privately funded canals, and of canals in the New York system. </p> 
<p>Today, there are over two hundred bridges crossing the Susquehanna. The sole remaining ferry, at <a href="/wiki/Millersburg%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Millersburg, Pennsylvania</a>, is a seasonal tourist attraction.  The canals are gone or are part of historical parks, and dams are related to power generation or recreation. Perhaps the most famous of the bridges, the <a href="/wiki/Rockville_Bridge" id="w">Rockville Bridge</a>, crosses the river  from <a href="/wiki/Harrisburg%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</a> to <a href="/wiki/Marysville%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Marysville, Pennsylvania</a>. The Rockville Bridge, when constructed, was the longest <a href="/wiki/Stone_masonry" id="w">stone masonry</a> <a href="/wiki/Arch_bridge" id="w">arch bridge</a> in the world.  It was built by the <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad" id="w">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> in the early 1900s, replacing an earlier iron bridge.</p>
