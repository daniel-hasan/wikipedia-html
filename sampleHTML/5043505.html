<p><b>John Bruce “Jack” Thompson</b> (born <a href="/wiki/July_25" id="w">July 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/1951" id="w">1951</a>) is an <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Attorney" id="w">attorney</a> and <a href="/wiki/Activist" id="w">activist</a>, based in <a href="/wiki/Coral_Gables%2C_Florida" id="w">Coral Gables</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>.  Thompson describes himself as a <a href="/wiki/Christian_conservative" id="w">Christian conservative</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Republican</a>.<sup id="_ref-Provenzo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Provenzo" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>After an initial foray into politics, Thompson concentrated his legal efforts against perceived <a href="/wiki/Obscenity" id="w">obscenity</a>, particularly in <a href="/wiki/Rap_music" id="w">rap music</a> and broadcasts by radio personality <a href="/wiki/Howard_Stern" id="w">Howard Stern</a>. More recently, he has focused on <a href="/wiki/Violence" id="w">violence</a> as well, particularly in the content of <a href="/wiki/Computer_and_video_games" id="w">computer and video games</a> and their alleged effects on children. Thompson is also frequently involved in <a href="/wiki/Medical_malpractice" id="w">medical malpractice</a> lawsuits in his capacity as an attorney.<sup id="_ref-RollingStoneMag_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-RollingStoneMag" title="">[2]</a></sup>  He is perhaps the most vocal advocate of banning stylized violence in video games, and initially started this crusade in 1997 while representing the parents of the three students killed in the <a href="/wiki/Heath_High_School_shooting" id="w">Heath High School shooting</a>.</p>
<p>Thompson is known for his public advocacy of conservative Christian moral standards. His involvement with gaming and the media (and especially use of legal threats) have raised questions about <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">First Amendment</a> rights. The Florida Bar Association is currently seeking sanctions against Thompson for inappropriate conduct.<sup id="_ref-law.com_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-law.com" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h1>Background</h1>
<p>Thompson grew up in <a href="/wiki/Cleveland%2C_Ohio" id="w">Cleveland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ohio" id="w">Ohio</a>, and attended <a href="/wiki/Denison_University" id="w">Denison University</a>. He received media attention when he hosted his own political talk show on the college radio station.<sup id="_ref-PrivateSting_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PrivateSting" title="">[4]</a></sup>  He went to <a href="/wiki/Law_school" id="w">law school</a> at <a href="/wiki/Vanderbilt_University" id="w">Vanderbilt University</a>, where he met his wife, Patricia.<sup id="_ref-Batman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Batman" title="">[5]</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/1976" id="w">1976</a> they moved to <a href="/wiki/Florida" id="w">Florida</a>, where Thompson, working as a lawyer and then a fundraiser for a Christian ministry,<sup id="_ref-Batman_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Batman" title="">[5]</a></sup> began attending the <a href="/wiki/Key_Biscayne" id="w">Key Biscayne</a> <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian_Church" id="w">Presbyterian Church</a> and became a <a href="/wiki/Born-again_Christian" id="w">born-again Christian</a>.<sup id="_ref-PrivateSting_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PrivateSting" title="">[4]</a></sup> Thompson admits to having a “colorful disciplinary history” as an attorney.<sup id="_ref-Linn_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Linn" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Campaign_against_Janet_Reno" name="Campaign_against_Janet_Reno"></a><h1>Campaign against Janet Reno</h1>
<p>Thompson first met <a href="/wiki/Janet_Reno" id="w">Janet Reno</a> in November 1975, when he applied for a job as an assistant <a href="/wiki/State%26%2339%3Bs_Attorney" id="w">State’s Attorney</a> in <a href="/wiki/Miami-Dade_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Dade County</a>, but was not hired.<sup id="_ref-outofharmsway_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-outofharmsway" title="">[7]</a></sup> In 1988, he ran for prosecutor against then incumbent Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno. At the time, Thompson was involved in a feud with local radio host <a href="/wiki/Neil_Rogers" id="w">Neil Rogers</a> and Reno had declined his request to prosecute Rogers.<sup id="_ref-Evans_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Evans" title="">[8]</a></sup> Thompson was instrumental in getting the FCC to fine Miami radio station WIOD $10,000 for airing such parody songs as “Boys Like Sex in the Morning” on Rogers’ show.<sup id="_ref-PrivateSting_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PrivateSting" title="">[4]</a></sup> Thompson also sued the station for violating a December 1987 agreement to end on-air harassment against him.  Thompson had complained to the station after Rogers solicited homosexuals to join Thompson on his vacation; Rogers aired Thompson’s address and phone number.  For the next eight months Thompson recorded all of Rogers’ broadcasts and documented 40,000 mentionings of his name.  He claimed one of the terms of his agreement with the station was that it would pay him $5,000 each time his name was mentioned, totaling $200 million in the suit.<sup id="_ref-ABA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ABA" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thompson gave Reno a letter at a campaign event requesting that she check a box to indicate whether she was homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual. Thompson said that Reno then put her hand on his shoulder and responded, “I’m only interested in virile men. That’s why I’m not attracted to you.”<sup id="_ref-Vick_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vick" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> He filed a police report accusing her of <a href="/wiki/Battery_(crime)" id="w">battery</a> for touching him.  In response, Reno asked Florida governor <a href="/wiki/Bob_Martinez" id="w">Bob Martinez</a> to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate.<sup id="_ref-Battery_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Battery" title="">[12]</a></sup> The special prosecutor rejected the charge, concluding that it was “a political ploy.” Reno was ultimately re-elected with 69% of the vote. Thompson repeated allegations that Reno was a lesbian when she was nominated as <a href="/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General" id="w">U.S. Attorney General</a>, leading one of her supporters, lieutenant governor <a href="/wiki/Buddy_MacKay" id="w">Buddy MacKay</a>, to dismiss him as a “kook.”<sup id="_ref-Vick_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Vick" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1990, after his election loss, Thompson began a campaign against the efforts of <a href="/wiki/Switchboard_of_Miami" id="w">Switchboard of Miami</a>, a social services group of which Reno was a board member. Thompson charged that the group placed “homosexual-education tapes” in public schools. Switchboard responded by getting the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Supreme_Court" id="w">Florida Supreme Court</a> to order that he submit to a psychiatric examination. Thompson did so and passed, and since then has stated on more than one occasion that he is “the only officially certified sane lawyer in the entire state of Florida.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Timmerman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Timmerman" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Rap_music" name="Rap_music"></a><h1>Rap music</h1>
<p>Thompson came to national prominence in the controversy over <a href="/wiki/2_Live_Crew" id="w">2 Live Crew</a>’s <i><a href="/wiki/As_Nasty_As_They_Wanna_Be" id="w">As Nasty As They Wanna Be</a></i> album. (<a href="/wiki/Luke_Skyywalker_Records" id="w">Luke Skyywalker Records</a>, the company of 2 Live Crew’s <a href="/wiki/Luther_Campbell" id="w">Luther Campbell</a>, had previously released a record supporting Reno in her race against Thompson.)<sup id="_ref-OntheBeat_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-OntheBeat" title="">[14]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/January_1" id="w">January 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1990" id="w">1990</a>, he wrote to Martinez and Reno asking them to investigate whether the album violated Florida obscenity laws. Although the state prosecutor declined to proceed with an investigation, Thompson pushed local officials in various parts of the state to block sales of the album, along with <a href="/wiki/N.W.A" id="w">N.W.A</a>’s <i><a href="/wiki/Straight_Outta_Compton" id="w">Straight Outta Compton</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Philips1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Philips1" title="">[15]</a></sup> In sending documents to opponents, Thompson would frequently attach a photocopy of his driver&#39;s license, with a photo of <a href="/wiki/Batman" id="w">Batman</a> pasted over his own, just to make sure they knew who they were dealing with.  Thompson said, &#34;I have sent my opponents pictures of Batman to remind them I&#39;m playing the role of Batman.  Just like Bruce Wayne helped the police in the movie, I have had to assist the sheriff of Broward County.&#34; He also wore a Batman wristwatch.<sup id="_ref-Batman2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Batman2" title="">[16]</a></sup>  Thompson compared Campbell to the <a href="/wiki/Joker_(comics)" id="w">Joker</a>.<sup id="_ref-Batman3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Batman3" title="">[17]</a></sup>  Thompson also said, “I understand as well as anybody that the <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment" id="w">First Amendment</a> is a cornerstone of a free society—but there is a responsibility to people who can be harmed by words and thoughts, one of which is the message from Campbell that women can be sexually abused.”<sup id="_ref-PrivateSting_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PrivateSting" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thompson also took issue with another 2 Live Crew song, <i><a href="/wiki/Banned_in_the_USA" id="w">Banned in the USA</a></i>.  Thompson sent a letter to <a href="/wiki/Jon_Landau" id="w">Jon Landau</a>, manager of <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen" id="w">Bruce Springsteen</a>, whose song <i><a href="/wiki/Born_in_the_USA" id="w">Born in the USA</a></i> was to be sampled by the group.  Thompson suggested that Landau &#34;protect <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i> from its apparent theft by a bunch of clowns who traffic toxic waste to kids,&#34; or else Thompson would &#34;be telling the nation about Mr. Springsteen&#39;s tacit approval&#34; of the song, which, according to Campbell, &#34;expresses anger about the failure of the First Amendment to protect 2 Live Crew from prosecution.&#34;<sup id="_ref-BannedUSA_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BannedUSA" title="">[18]</a></sup>  Thompson also said, &#34;the &#39;social commentary&#39; on this album is akin to a sociopath&#39;s discharging his <a href="/wiki/AK-47" id="w">AK-47</a> into a crowded schoolyard, with the machine gun bursts interrupted by <a href="/wiki/Pee_Wee_Herman" id="w">Pee Wee Herman</a>&#39;s views on politics.&#34;<sup id="_ref-BannedUSA2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BannedUSA2" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>The members of 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the <a href="/wiki/Broward_County%2C_Florida" id="w">Broward County</a> sheriff in federal district court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album could result in a prosecution for obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional <a href="/wiki/Prior_restraint" id="w">prior restraint</a> on free speech, the court ruled that the album was in fact <a href="/wiki/Miller_test" id="w">obscene</a>. However, an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it have no artistic value.<sup id="_ref-Luke_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Luke" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the debate continued, Thompson wrote, “An industry that says a line cannot be drawn will be drawn and quartered.”<sup id="_ref-Billboard_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Billboard" title="">[21]</a></sup> He said of his campaign, “I won’t stop till I get the head of a record company or record chain in jail. Only then will they stop trafficking in obscenity.”<sup id="_ref-Cox_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cox" title="">[22]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Bob_Guccione_Jr." id="w">Bob Guccione Jr.</a>, founder of <i><a href="/wiki/Spin_magazine" id="w">Spin</a></i> magazine, responded by calling Thompson “a sort of latter-day <a href="/wiki/Don_Quixote" id="w">Don Quixote</a>, as equally at odds with his times as that mythical character was,” and argued that his campaign was achieving “two things...: pissing everybody off and compounding his own celebrity.”<sup id="_ref-Guccione_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Guccione" title="">[23]</a></sup> Thompson responded by noting, “Law enforcement and I put 2 Live Crew’s career back into the toilet where it began.”<sup id="_ref-GuccioneResponse_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GuccioneResponse" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thompson wrote another letter in 1991, this time to the Minnesota attorney general <a href="/wiki/Hubert_H._Humphrey_III" id="w">Hubert H. Humphrey III</a>, complaining about the N.W.A album <i><a href="/wiki/Efil4zaggin" id="w">Efil4zaggin</a></i>. Humphrey warned locally-based <a href="/wiki/Musicland" id="w">Musicland</a> that sales of the album might violate state law against distribution of sexually explicit material harmful to minors. Humphrey also referred the matter to the Minneapolis city attorney, who concluded that some of the songs might fit the legal definition if issued as singles, but that sales of the album as a whole were not prosecutable.<sup id="_ref-Harrington1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harrington1" title="">[25]</a></sup> Thompson also initiated a similar campaign in Boston.<sup id="_ref-Reibman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reibman" title="">[26]</a></sup> Later, Thompson would criticize the Republican Party for inviting N.W.A member and party donor <a href="/wiki/Eazy-E" id="w">Eric “Eazy-E” Wright</a> to an exclusive function.<sup id="_ref-Philips2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Philips2" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1992, Thompson was hired by the <a href="/wiki/Freedom_Alliance" id="w">Freedom Alliance</a>, a self-described patriot group founded by <a href="/wiki/Oliver_North" id="w">Oliver North</a>, described as &#34;<a href="/wiki/Right-wing_politics" id="w">far-right</a>&#34; by the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Post" id="w">Washington Post</a>.    By this time, Thompson was looking to have <a href="/wiki/Time_Warner" id="w">Time Warner</a>, then being criticized for promoting the <a href="/wiki/Ice-T" id="w">Ice-T</a> song <i><a href="/wiki/Cop_Killer_(song)" id="w">Cop Killer</a></i>, prosecuted for federal and state crimes such as <a href="/wiki/Sedition" id="w">sedition</a>, incitement to riot, and “advocating overthrow of government” by distributing material that, in Thompson&#39;s view, advocated the killing of police officers.<sup id="_ref-Harrington2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Harrington2" title="">[28]</a></sup> Time Warner eventually released Ice-T and his band from their contract, and voluntarily suspended distribution of the album on which <i>Cop Killer</i> was featured.</p>
<p>Thompson’s push to label various musical performances obscene was not entirely limited to rap. In addition to taking on 2 Live Crew, Thompson campaigned against sales of the racy music video for <a href="/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer)" id="w">Madonna</a>’s <i><a href="/wiki/Justify_My_Love" id="w">Justify My Love</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Philips3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Philips3" title="">[29]</a></sup> Then in 1996, he took on <a href="/wiki/MTV" id="w">MTV</a> broadcasts for “objectification of women” by writing to the station’s corporate parent, <a href="/wiki/Viacom" id="w">Viacom</a>, demanding a stop to what he called “corporate pollution.”<sup id="_ref-Sandler_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sandler" title="">[30]</a></sup> He also went after MTV’s advertisers and urged the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Army" id="w">U.S. Army</a> to pull recruiting commercials, citing the Army’s recruitment of women and problems with sexual harassment scandals.<sup id="_ref-Sandler2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sandler2" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Video_games_and_juveniles" name="Video_games_and_juveniles"></a><h1>Video games and juveniles</h1>
<p>More recently, Thompson has heavily criticized a number of video games and campaigned against their producers and distributors.  His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as “murder simulators” to rehearse violent plans.  He has pointed to alleged connections between such games and a number of school massacres. According to Thompson, “In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers.”<sup id="_ref-EveryShooting_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EveryShooting" title="">[32]</a></sup> Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and <a href="/wiki/Copycat" id="w">copycat</a> behavior.<sup id="_ref-Tribune_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tribune" title="">[33]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> According to Thompson, “If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing <i><a href="/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City" id="w">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a></i>, one has to wonder why he doesn’t get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain.”<sup id="_ref-Drew_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Drew" title="">[35]</a></sup> Thompson has described the proliferation of games by <a href="/wiki/Sony" id="w">Sony</a>, a Japanese company, as “<a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" id="w">Pearl Harbor</a> 2.”<sup id="_ref-Lasker_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Lasker" title="">[36]</a></sup> According to Thompson, “Many parents think that stores won’t sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that’s not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked.”<sup id="_ref-Cooper360_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cooper360" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_expression" id="w">freedom of expression</a>, saying, “Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They’re not even speech. They’re dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it,” as well as simply calling video games &#34;mental masturbation&#34;.<sup id="_ref-Benedetti_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Benedetti" title="">[38]</a></sup> In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, saying that it was looking “for a way to disconnect in the soldier’s mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end.”<sup id="_ref-DenverPost_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-DenverPost" title="">[39]</a></sup> Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and <a href="/wiki/Simulation" id="w">simulation</a> technologies, such as those being developed at the <a href="/wiki/Institute_for_Creative_Technologies" id="w">Institute for Creative Technologies</a>, which, he suggests, were created by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" id="w">Department of Defense</a> to help overcome soldiers’ inhibition to kill.<sup id="_ref-Worthy_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Worthy" title="">[40]</a></sup>  He also claims that the <a href="/wiki/PlayStation_2" id="w">PlayStation 2</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/DualShock" id="w">DualShock</a> controller &#34;gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill.

<a id="Early_litigation" name="Early_litigation"></a><h2>Early litigation</h2>
<p>Thompson filed a lawsuit on behalf of the parents of three children killed in the <a href="/wiki/Heath_High_School_shooting" id="w">Heath High School shooting</a> in 1997. Investigations showed that the perpetrator, 14-year-old Michael Carneal, had regularly played various computer games (including <i><a href="/wiki/Doom_(video_game)" id="w">Doom</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Quake_(series)" id="w">Quake</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Castle_Wolfenstein" id="w">Castle Wolfenstein</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Redneck_Rampage" id="w">Redneck Rampage</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Nightmare_Creatures" id="w">Nightmare Creatures</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/MechWarrior" id="w">MechWarrior</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Resident_Evil_(series)" id="w">Resident Evil</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Final_Fantasy" id="w">Final Fantasy</a></i>) and accessed some pornographic websites. Carneal had also owned a videotape of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Basketball_Diaries_(film)" id="w">The Basketball Diaries</a></i>, which includes a high school student dreaming about shooting his teacher and some classmates. The suit sought $33 million in damages, alleging that the producers of the games, the movie, and the operators of the Internet sites were <a href="/wiki/Negligence" id="w">negligent</a> in distributing this material to a minor because it would desensitize him and make him more prone to violence. Additional claims included <a href="/wiki/Product_liability" id="w">product liability</a> for making defective products (the defects alleged were violent features and lack of warnings) and violation of the <a href="/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act" id="w">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a> for distributing this material to minors.<sup id="_ref-James1_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-James1" title="">[42]</a></sup> Said Thompson, “We intend to hurt Hollywood.

<p>The suit was filed in federal district court and was dismissed for failing to present a legally recognizable claim. The court concluded that Carneal’s actions were not reasonably foreseeable by the defendants and that in any case, his actions superseded those of the defendants, so that the latter could not be the <a href="/wiki/Proximate_cause" id="w">proximate cause</a> of the harm. In addition, the judge determined that “thoughts, ideas and images” in the defendants’ materials did not constitute “products” that could be considered defective.<sup id="_ref-James1_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-James1" title="">[42]</a></sup> The ruling was upheld on appeal.<sup id="_ref-James2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-James2" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>

<p>In February 2003, Thompson asked permission to file an <i><a href="/wiki/Amicus_curiae" id="w">amicus curiae</a></i> (or “friend of the court”) brief in the Ohio case of Dustin Lynch, 16, who was charged with aggravated murder in the slaying of JoLynn Mishne; Lynch was &#34;obsessed&#34; with <i><a href="/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III" id="w">Grand Theft Auto III</a></i>.<sup id="_ref-Hudak_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hudak" title="">[45]</a></sup> When Judge John Lohn ruled that Lynch would be tried as an adult, Thompson passed a message from Mishne’s father to the judge, asserting that “the attorneys had better tell the jury about the violent video game that trained this kid [and] showed him how to kill our daughter, JoLynn. If they don’t, I will.”<sup id="_ref-Hudak2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hudak2" title="">[46]</a></sup> In a motion sent to the prosecutor, the boy’s court-appointed lawyer, and to reporters, Thompson asked to be recognized as the boy’s lawyer in the case. However, Medina County Prosecutor Dean Holman said Thompson would be faced with deeply conflicting interests if he were to represent Dustin Lynch because he also advised Mishne’s parents.<sup id="_ref-Hudak3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hudak3" title="">[47]</a></sup> Claiming that delays had weakened his case, Jack Thompson asked Medina County Common Pleas Judge Christopher Collier to disqualify himself from presiding over the case because the judge had not ruled on Thompson’s request for two months.<sup id="_ref-Hudak4_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hudak4" title="">[48]</a></sup> Lynch himself eventually rejected Thompson’s offer, withdrawing his insanity plea. Lynch’s mother, Jerrilyn Thomas, who previously demanded that Judge Christopher Collier appoint Thompson to defend her son, said she changed her mind after visiting with her boy in jail, saying, “It has nothing to do with video games or <a href="/wiki/Paxil" id="w">Paxil</a>, and my son’s no murderer.”<sup id="_ref-Hudak5_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hudak5" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>

However, his participation in the case ran into a dispute over his <a href="/wiki/Pro_hac_vice" id="w">pro hac vice</a> admission to practice law in that state.

The 69-page complaint filed by Thompson and Albuquerque attorney <a href="/wiki/Steven_Sanders" id="w">Steven Sanders</a>  argued that &#34;obsessively&#34; playing <i>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</i> made violence &#34;pleasurable and attractive,&#34; disconnected violence from consequences, and caused Posey to &#34;act out, copycat, replicate and emulate the violence&#34; when he shot and killed his father, stepmother, and stepsister, and then buried them under a manure pile at a ranch owned by former <a href="/wiki/ABC_News" id="w">ABC News</a> reporter <a href="/wiki/Sam_Donaldson" id="w">Sam Donaldson</a> in July, 2004. Thompson and Sanders filed the lawsuit on behalf of the surviving family members of Posey&#39;s father. According to Thompson, &#34;Posey essentially practiced how to kill on this game.

Once the game is out, according to Thompson, &#34;the horse will be out of the barn and it will be too late to do anything about it.&#34; Thompson  argued that it violated Florida&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Public_nuisance" id="w">public nuisance</a> laws, which prohibit activities that can injure the health of the community.<sup id="_ref-TechWeb_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TechWeb" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Activism_and_lobbying" name="Activism_and_lobbying"></a><h2>Activism and lobbying</h2>
<p>In addition to filing lawsuits, Thompson has pushed for measures against similar games in a variety of public settings.

<p>Thompson has supported legislation in a number of states that would ban sales of violent and sexually explicit video games to minors.<sup id="_ref-Baldas_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Baldas" title="">[59]</a></sup> In response to <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">First Amendment</a> concerns, he argued that the games were a “public safety hazard.”<sup id="_ref-Snyder_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Snyder" title="">[79]</a></sup> However, he rejected as “completely unconstitutional” <a href="/wiki/Hillary_Clinton" id="w">Hillary Clinton</a>’s proposed legislation to ban sales to minors of games rated “M” for Mature by the <a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board" id="w">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a>. Thompson contended that the government could not enforce a private-sector standard but had to depend on a <a href="/wiki/Miller_test" id="w">&#39;&#39;Miller&#39;&#39; obscenity test</a>.

<p>In July 2005, Thompson sent a letter to several politicians urging them to investigate <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sims_2" id="w">The Sims 2</a></i>, alleging that the game contained nudity accessible by entering special codes. Thompson called the nudity inappropriate for a game rated “T” for Teen, a rating which indicates suitability for anyone 13 and older. Manufacturer <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Arts" id="w">Electronic Arts</a> dismissed the allegations, with vice president Jeff Brown explaining that game characters have “no anatomical detail” under their clothes, effectively resembling <a href="/wiki/Barbie" id="w">Barbie</a> dolls. Although the game does display blurred-out patches over body regions when characters are naked, such as when taking a shower, Brown said that was for “humorous effect” and denied there was anything improper about the game.<sup id="_ref-Wingfield_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wingfield" title="">[81]</a></sup> Nevertheless, a command that could be entered into the <a href="/wiki/In-game_console" id="w">in-game console</a> in order to disable the blur effect was removed from the game in an expansion. No official reason was given for the change.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a>, Thompson helped draft a 2006 bill sponsored by state representative <a href="/wiki/Roy_Burrell" id="w">Roy Burrell</a> to ban the sale of violent video games to buyers under 18 (<a href="/wiki/Louisiana_House_Bill_1381" id="w">HB1381</a>). In an effort to avoid constitutional problems, it avoided trying to define &#34;violent&#34; and instead adopted a variation of the <a href="/wiki/Miller_test" id="w">&#39;&#39;Miller&#39;&#39; obscenity test</a>: Sales to minors would be illegal based on community standards if the game appealed to &#34;the minor’s morbid interest in violence&#34;, was patently offensive based on adult standards of suitability for minors, and lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.

<p>At one point, Thompson was asked by the <a href="/wiki/National_Institute_on_Media_and_the_Family" id="w">National Institute on Media and the Family</a> to stop invoking the organization’s name in his campaigns.

Your game, a killing simulator, according to the news that used to be in the Post, trained him to enjoy killing and how to kill.&#34; However, Microsoft did not create <i>Counter-Strike</i> - they only published the <a href="/wiki/Xbox" id="w">Xbox</a> version of the game.<sup id="_ref-Benedetti_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Benedetti" title="">[38]</a></sup> The official Virginia state panel commissioned to investigate the shooting determined that Seung-Hui &#34;played video games like <a href="/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(video_game)" id="w">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>,&#34; and that &#34;none of the video games [he had played] were war games or had violent themes.&#34;<sup id="_ref-VTReport_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VTReport" title="">[98]</a></sup></p>

Thompson&#39;s &#34;high-profile crusades&#34; have made him an enemy of video game aficionados.<sup id="_ref-Krueger_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Krueger" title="">[60]</a></sup> On occasion, Thompson has sparred directly with the gaming industry and its fans. In 2005, he wrote an open letter to <a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Association" id="w">Entertainment Software Association</a> president <a href="/wiki/Doug_Lowenstein" id="w">Doug Lowenstein</a>, making what he described as a “a modest video game proposal” (an allusion to the title of <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Swift" id="w">Jonathan Swift</a>&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Satire" id="w">satirical</a> essay, <i><a href="/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal" id="w">A Modest Proposal</a></i>) to the video game industry: Thompson said he would donate $10,000 to a charity designated by Take-Two CEO <a href="/wiki/Paul_Eibeler" id="w">Paul Eibeler</a> if any video game company would create a game including the scenario he described in the letter. The scenario called for the main character, whose son was killed by a boy who played violent video games, to murder a number of industry executives (including one modeled on Eibeler) and go on a killing spree at the <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Entertainment_Expo" id="w">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>. Video game fans promptly began working to take Thompson up on his offer, resulting in the game <i><a href="/wiki/I%26%2339%3Bm_O.K_-_A_Murder_Simulator" id="w">I&#39;m O.K - A Murder Simulator</a></i>, among others. Afterwards, he claimed that his proposal was <a href="/wiki/Satire" id="w">satire</a>, and as of <a href="/wiki/November_2007" id="w">November 2007</a> he has not made his proposed donation.</p>
<p>In response, <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Holkins" id="w">Jerry Holkins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mike_Krahulik" id="w">Mike Krahulik</a>, the creators of gaming <a href="/wiki/Webcomic" id="w">webcomic</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Penny_Arcade_(webcomic)" id="w">Penny Arcade</a></i> and of the children&#39;s charity <a href="/wiki/Child%26%2339%3Bs_Play_(charity)" id="w">Child&#39;s Play</a>, stepped in to make the donation instead, writing in the memo field of their check, “For Jack Thompson, Because Jack Thompson Won&#39;t.” Afterwards, Thompson tried to get Seattle police and the FBI to investigate Holkins and Krahulik for orchestrating &#34;criminal harassment&#34; of him through articles on their site.<sup id="_ref-Kohler_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kohler" title="">[99]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Gillett_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gillett" title="">[100]</a></sup> Other <a href="/wiki/Webcomic" id="w">webcomics</a> have regularly incorporated references to Thompson, alluding to this incident as well as others.<sup id="_ref-Webcomics_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Webcomics" title="">[101]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2006, two <a href="/wiki/Michigan" id="w">Michigan</a> gamers began a project dubbed &#34;Flowers for Jack&#34;, soliciting donations to deliver a massive floral arrangement to Thompson’s office.  The flowers were delivered in February along with a letter aimed at opening a dialogue between Thompson and the video gaming community. Thompson rejected this overture and forwarded the flowers to some of his industry foes, with such comments as “Discard them along with the decency you discarded long ago. I really don’t care. Grind them up and smoke them if you like.”<sup id="_ref-Tilley_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tilley" title="">[102]</a></sup></p>
<p>Gamers have responded to Thompson&#39;s attempt to link the Virginia Tech massacre to the game <i>Counter-Strike</i>. Video game Web sites and young  gamers on Internet message boards &#34;teemed with anger&#34; at what <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle" id="w">San Francisco Chronicle</a> reporter <a href="/wiki/Peter_Hartlaub" id="w">Peter Hartlaub</a> called &#34;his serial  misstatements,&#34; in some cases linking to <a href="/wiki/YouTube" id="w">YouTube</a> videos of Thompson and  dissecting his claims point by point.<sup id="_ref-Hartlaub_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Hartlaub" title="">[103]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Jason_Della_Rocca" id="w">Jason Della Rocca</a>, executive director of the <a href="/wiki/International_Game_Developers_Association" id="w">International Game Developers Association</a>, said, &#34;It’s so sad. These massacre chasers—they’re worse than <a href="/wiki/Ambulance_chaser" id="w">ambulance chasers</a>—they’re waiting for these things to happen so they can jump on their soapbox,&#34;<sup id="_ref-Benedetti_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Benedetti" title="">[38]</a></sup> In response, Thompson referred to Della Rocca as an &#34;idiot&#34; and a &#34;jackass&#34; &#34;paid not to connect the dots [connecting shootings to video games],&#34; and compared himself to people who warned that the government should be more concerned about terrorism before the <a href="/wiki/September_11%2C_2001_attacks" id="w">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>.<sup id="_ref-VTMSNBC2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-VTMSNBC2" title="">[104]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Thompson_and_Howard_Stern" name="Thompson_and_Howard_Stern"></a><h1>Thompson and Howard Stern</h1>
<p>In 2004, Thompson helped get <a href="/wiki/Howard_Stern" id="w">Howard Stern</a>’s show taken off a radio station in <a href="/wiki/Orlando%2C_Florida" id="w">Orlando, Florida</a> by filing a complaint with the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission" id="w">Federal Communications Commission</a>. Thompson objected to Stern’s use of obscenities on the air. He argued that “Either broadcasters will accept the light harness of decency that has been the law for decades and start cleaning up their acts, or the public’s deepening outrage will foster a more fearsome governmental response.”<sup id="_ref-WhyIComplain_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WhyIComplain" title="">[105]</a></sup>  Thompson claimed to have received death threats from listeners of Stern&#39;s show, noting that &#34;you&#39;d expect that considering the <a href="/wiki/IQ" id="w">IQ</a> of people who listen to Howard Stern. Apparently they fail to realize that I might have <a href="/wiki/Caller_ID" id="w">caller ID</a>.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Mayo_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mayo" title="">[106]</a></sup> </p>
<p>During his opposition to Howard Stern, Thompson was asked in an interview with a reporter if, by his standards, he would blame <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christianity</a> for the murders committed by <a href="/wiki/List_of_school_massacres#Secondary and Post-secondary school killings" id="w">Michael Hernandez</a>, a fourteen year old who murdered two classmates in 2004, because Hernandez wrote a diary in which he constantly spoke about praying to God. Thompson replied, &#34;The Bible doesn&#39;t promote killing innocent people, <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> does.  <a href="/wiki/Islam" id="w">Islam</a> does.&#34; Thompson then expanded his comments in the same interview by saying, &#34;Islam promotes the killing of innocent people. The <a href="/wiki/Qur%26%2339%3Ban" id="w">Quran</a> requires the infidel, whether Jew or Christian, to be killed. ... That&#39;s a core essence of the religion. ... <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" id="w">Muhammad</a> was a pirate who killed infidels and who advocated the killing of infidels - not a nice guy. <a href="/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden" id="w">Osama bin Laden</a> is in keeping with his fine tradition.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Mayo2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Mayo2" title="">[107]</a></sup></p>
<p>He later spoke in defense of Stern during the latter’s legal dispute with <a href="/wiki/CBS" id="w">CBS</a> over promoting <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Satellite_Radio" id="w">Sirius</a> on-air before his switch to satellite radio. Thompson contended that the technology added by CBS to edit out profanity also could have worked to edit out Stern’s references to Sirius.<sup id="_ref-Arango_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Arango" title="">[108]</a></sup> According to Thompson, “The reason why CBS chose not to edit Stern is that Stern’s Arbitron ratings remained high and were arguably even enhanced by people tuning in to hear daily about Stern’s running feud with CBS and his move to Sirius. In other words, CBS actually used Stern’s discussion of his move to Sirius to make more money for CBS.”<sup id="_ref-Rosenthal_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rosenthal" title="">[109]</a></sup> </p>
<p>CBS President <a href="/wiki/Leslie_Moonves" id="w">Leslie Moonves</a> responded, saying “You know what? You can’t let people like that tell you what to put on the air or what not to put on the air. That would only open the door when suddenly next week, he says, ‘Take <a href="/wiki/The_Late_Show_with_David_Letterman" id="w">David Letterman</a> off the air or take <i><a href="/wiki/CSI:_Crime_Scene_Investigation" id="w">C.S.I.</a></i> off the air.’ Or you know what? <i><a href="/wiki/Everybody_Loves_Raymond" id="w">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></i> was about, you know, sex last week or about a 70-year-old man—you know, we dealt with <a href="/wiki/Peter_Boyle" id="w">Peter Boyle</a> having sex with <a href="/wiki/Doris_Roberts" id="w">Doris Roberts</a>. ‘Take that off the air.’ That’s something we can’t let happen.”<sup id="_ref-Moonves_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Moonves" title="">[110]</a></sup></p>
<a id="The_Florida_Bar" name="The_Florida_Bar"></a><h1>The Florida Bar</h1>
<p>In 1992, Thompson asked a Florida judge to declare the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Bar_Association" id="w">Florida Bar Association</a> unconstitutional. He claimed that the bar was engaged in a vendetta against him because of his religious beliefs, which he said conflict with what he called the bar’s pro-gay, <a href="/wiki/Humanism" id="w">humanist</a>, liberal agenda. He also said that the “wedding of all three functions of government into the Florida Bar, the ‘official arm’ of the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Supreme_Court" id="w">Florida Supreme Court</a>, is violative of the bedrock constitutional requirement of the separation powers and the ‘checks and balances’ which the separation guarantees.”<sup id="_ref-TheRecorder_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-TheRecorder" title="">[111]</a></sup> Thompson accepted a $20,000 out-of-court settlement.<sup id="_ref-Settlement_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Settlement" title="">[112]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/January_7" id="w">January 7</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, Thompson sent the Supreme Court of Florida a letter regarding the Florida Bar&#39;s actions. The letter was filed with the court on <a href="/wiki/January_10" id="w">January 10</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a> and was treated as a petition for a <a href="/wiki/Writ_of_mandamus" id="w">writ of mandamus</a> against the Florida Bar.<sup id="_ref-JTwritlet_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-JTwritlet" title="">[113]</a></sup> Before any action was taken on the petition, Thompson sent the court another letter on <a href="/wiki/January_28" id="w">January 28</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a> voluntarily dismissing the case. The letter was filed with the court on <a href="/wiki/January_30" id="w">January 30</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>, and the Florida Supreme Court issued an order of dismissal on <a href="/wiki/February_28" id="w">February 28</a> <a href="/wiki/2002" id="w">2002</a>.<sup id="_ref-FSCorderdis_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FSCorderdis" title="">[114]</a></sup></p>
<p>In January 2006, Thompson asked the <a href="/wiki/Justice_Department" id="w">Justice Department</a> to investigate the Florida Bar’s actions. “The Florida Bar and its agents have engaged in a documented pattern of this illegal activity, which may sink to the level of criminal racketeering activity, in a knowing and illegal effort to chill my federal First Amendment rights,” Thompson wrote in a letter to <a href="/wiki/Alex_Acosta" id="w">Alex Acosta</a>, interim <a href="/wiki/U.S._attorney" id="w">U.S. attorney</a> for the Southern District of Florida.<sup id="_ref-CarlJones_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CarlJones" title="">[115]</a></sup></p>
<p>In April 2006, Thompson filed another suit against the Florida Bar, this time in the <a href="/wiki/U.S._District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida" id="w">U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a>, alleging that the Bar harassed him by investigating what he called baseless complaints made by disgruntled opponents in previous disputes. His five-count complaint asked for more than $1 million in damages. The lawsuit alleged that the Bar was pursuing baseless ethics complaints brought against Thompson by <a href="/wiki/Tew_Cardenas" id="w">Tew Cardenas</a> attorneys <a href="/wiki/Lawrence_Kellogg" id="w">Lawrence Kellogg</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alberto_%26quot%3BAl%26quot%3B_Cardenas" id="w">Alberto Cardenas</a> of Miami, and by two lawyers from the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" id="w">Philadelphia</a> office of <a href="/wiki/Blank_Rome" id="w">Blank Rome</a>, in violation of Thompson’s constitutional rights. According to the lawsuit, the Bar looked at Thompson for violations of a bar rule that prohibits attorneys from making disparaging remarks about judges, other attorneys, or court personnel. Thompson also filed a motion with the court to order the mediation of his dispute with the Bar. Thompson commented, “I enjoy doing what I do and I think I’ve got a First Amendment right to annoy people and participate in the public square in the cultural war.” Thompson also said he is optimistic his federal lawsuit will be successful. “I’m 100 percent certain that it will effect change, otherwise I would not have filed it.”<sup id="_ref-CarlJones_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CarlJones" title="">[115]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_25" id="w">April 25</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, the Florida Bar filed a motion to dismiss Thompson&#39;s complaint. The Bar argued that Thompson&#39;s complaint should be dismissed for a number of reasons, including the fact that the complaint failed to state a claim on which he could be granted relief. The Bar also argued that it was absolutely immune from liability for actions arising out of its disciplinary functions, that the <a href="/wiki/Eleventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" id="w">Eleventh Amendment</a> barred Thompson&#39;s recovery of damages, and that the court should dismiss the case pursuant to the <a href="/wiki/Abstention_doctrine" id="w">abstention doctrine</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Younger_v._Harris" id="w">Younger v. Harris</a></i>. On <a href="/wiki/May_4" id="w">May 4</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, Thompson filed a motion asking Judge Frederico Moreno to recuse himself from the case, as Judge Moreno was a member of the Florida Bar. Citing an &#34;abundance of caution,&#34; Judge Moreno recused himself on <a href="/wiki/May_9" id="w">May 9</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> and referred the case to Chief Judge William Zloch for further action. Thompson did not, however, respond to the Bar&#39;s motion to dismiss the case. Finally, on <a href="/wiki/May_17" id="w">May 17</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a>, Thompson filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal with the court, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.<sup id="_ref-FlaBar2006_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FlaBar2006" title="">[116]</a></sup></p>
<p>In February 2007, the Florida Bar filed <a href="/wiki/Disbarment" id="w">disbarment</a> proceedings against Thompson over allegations of professional misconduct. The action was the result of separate grievances filed by people claiming that Thompson made defamatory, false statements and attempted to humiliate, embarrass, harass or intimidate them.<sup id="_ref-Disbarment_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Disbarment" title="">[117]</a></sup> According to the complaint, Thompson accused attorney Cardenas of &#34;distribution of pornography to children,&#34; claimed that the Alabama judge presiding over the Devin Moore case &#34;breaks the rules, even the Alabama State Bar Rules, because he thinks that the rules don&#39;t apply to him,&#34; and sent a letter to Blank Rome&#39;s  managing partner, saying, &#34;Your law firm has actively and knowingly facilitated by various means the criminal distribution of sexual material to minors.&#34;  Thompson claims that the complaints violate state religious protections because his advocacy is motivated by his Christian faith.<sup id="_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#_note-118" title="">[118]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Other_activities" name="Other_activities"></a><h1>Other activities</h1>
<p>In 1992, a complaint from Thompson led Florida Secretary of State Jim Smith to withhold a $25,000 grant to the Miami Film Festival; Thompson claimed that the festival was using state money to show pornographic films.<sup id="_ref-Cosford_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cosford" title="">[119]</a></sup> In response, Thompson was named an “Art Censor of the Year” by the <a href="/wiki/ACLU" id="w">ACLU</a>.<sup id="_ref-ACLU_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ACLU" title="">[120]</a></sup> The next month, Thompson faced disbarment over allegations that he lied while making accusations against prominent Dade County lawyer Stuart Z Grossman.<sup id="_ref-Wallace_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Wallace" title="">[121]</a></sup> Thompson ultimately admitted violating bar rules of professional conduct, including charges that he contacted people represented by an attorney without first contacting their attorneys, and agreed to pay $3,000<sup id="_ref-FlaBarrep_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-FlaBarrep" title="">[122]</a></sup> in fines and receive a public reprimand.<sup id="_ref-Reprimand_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Reprimand" title="">[123]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1999, Thompson represented the parents of Bryce Kilduff, an 11-year old boy who committed suicide by hanging himself.  Police believed that the death was an accident, and that Kilduff was imitating <a href="/wiki/Kenny_McCormick" id="w">Kenny</a>, a character from the <a href="/wiki/Comedy_Central" id="w">Comedy Central</a> series <i><a href="/wiki/South_Park" id="w">South Park</a></i>, which Bryce, according to his parents, had never watched. Thompson called for Comedy Central to stop marketing the show and toys based on the series to children. “You see, the whole show—thrust of the show is it’s—it’s cool for kids to act like the characters in <i>South Park</i>.”<sup id="_ref-SouthPark_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-SouthPark" title="">[124]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although his efforts dealing with video games have focused on juveniles, Thompson got involved in a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an <a href="/wiki/Aggravated_murder" id="w">aggravated murder</a> case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around <a href="/wiki/Columbus%2C_Ohio" id="w">Columbus, Ohio</a>. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Getaway_(video_game)" id="w">The Getaway</a></i> were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy’s lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a <a href="/wiki/Search_warrant" id="w">search warrant</a> for McCoy’s residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games <i><a href="/wiki/State_of_Emergency_(video_game)" id="w">State of Emergency</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Max_Payne" id="w">Max Payne</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Dead_To_Rights" id="w">Dead To Rights</a></i>. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an <a href="/wiki/Insanity_defense" id="w">insanity defense</a> based on <a href="/wiki/Paranoid_schizophrenia" id="w">paranoid schizophrenia</a>. In Thompson’s estimation, McCoy was the “functional equivalent of a 15-year-old,”<sup id="_ref-Drew _a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Drew " title="">[125]</a></sup> and “the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense.”<sup id="_ref-NancyGrace_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-NancyGrace" title="">[126]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/February_21" id="w">February 21</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, Thompson filed a complaint with the Florida Judicial Qualifications Commission against Judge <a href="/wiki/Larry_Seidlin" id="w">Larry Seidlin</a>, accusing Seidlin of &#34;violating nearly every judicial canon&#34; in conducting a hearing on the disposition of the body of <a href="/wiki/Anna_Nicole_Smith" id="w">Anna Nicole Smith</a>.<sup id="_ref-Seidlin_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seidlin" title="">[127]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/June_28" id="w">June 28</a> <a href="/wiki/2007" id="w">2007</a>, Thompson filed a complaint with the State Attorney&#39;s Office, asking for an investigation and possible prosecution regarding accusations that Seidlin inappropriately accepted expensive gifts.<sup id="_ref-Seidlin2_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Seidlin2" title="">[128]</a></sup></p>
