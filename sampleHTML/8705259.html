The <b>Buffalo Grove ambush</b> was an <a href="/wiki/Ambush" id="w">ambush</a> that occurred on <a href="/wiki/May_19" id="w">May 19</a> <a href="/wiki/1832" id="w">1832</a> as part of the <a href="/wiki/Black_Hawk_War" id="w">Black Hawk War</a>. A six-man detail carrying dispatches from United States Colonel James M. Strode at <a href="/wiki/Galena%2C_Illinois" id="w">Galena, Illinois</a> to General <a href="/wiki/Henry_Atkinson" id="w">Henry Atkinson</a> at <a href="/wiki/Dixon%26%2339%3Bs_Ferry" id="w">Dixon&#39;s Ferry</a> was ambushed by Native Americans during the attack. William Durley was killed and buried near the site of the ambush. Durley&#39;s remains were initially interred by the party that would become victims of the <a href="/wiki/St._Vrain_massacre" id="w">St. Vrain massacre</a>. Two other men had bullet holes in their clothing, but were uninjured. In 1910 the Polo Historical Society moved Durley&#39;s remains to a plot beneath a memorial they erected west of <a href="/wiki/Polo%2C_Illinois" id="w">Polo, Illinois</a>.</p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h2>Background</h2>
<p>As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the <a href="/wiki/Governor" id="w">Governor</a> of <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Territory" id="w">Indiana Territory</a> and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement, the Sauk and Fox tribes vacated their lands in <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a> and moved west of the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi" id="w">Mississippi</a> in 1828. However, Sauk Chief <a href="/wiki/Black_Hawk_(chief)" id="w">Black Hawk</a> and others disputed the treaty, claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted, nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands.<sup id="_ref-lewis_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lewis" title="">[1]</a></sup> Angered by the loss of his birthplace, between 1830&#8211;31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a>, but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">British</a>, he again moved his so-called &#34;British Band&#34; of around 1000 warriors and non-combatants into Illinois.<sup id="_ref-lewis_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lewis" title="">[1]</a></sup> Finding no allies, he attempted to return to <a href="/wiki/Iowa" id="w">Iowa</a>, but ensuing events led to the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Stillman%26%2339%3Bs_Run" id="w">Battle of Stillman&#39;s Run</a>.<sup id="_ref-wiscsr_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wiscsr" title="">[2]</a></sup> A number of other engagements followed, and the state militias of <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin" id="w">Wisconsin</a> and Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk&#39;s band. The conflict became known as the <a href="/wiki/Black_Hawk_War" id="w">Black Hawk War</a>.</p>
<a id="Prelude" name="Prelude"></a><h2>Prelude</h2>
<p>When the <a href="/wiki/Black_Hawk_War" id="w">Black Hawk War</a> began in the spring of 1832, the settlers at Buffalo Grove were notified of <a href="/wiki/Black_Hawk_(chief)" id="w">Black Hawk</a>&#39;s victory at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Stillman%26%2339%3Bs_Run" id="w">Stillman&#39;s Run</a> and ordered to leave the grove.<sup id="_ref-leeogle_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-leeogle" title="">[3]</a></sup> Most of the settlers went to <a href="/wiki/Peoria%2C_Illinois" id="w">Peoria</a> where they remained for the duration of the war.<sup id="_ref-leeogle_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-leeogle" title="">[3]</a></sup> On <a href="/wiki/May_19" id="w">May 19</a> <a href="/wiki/1832" id="w">1832</a> a small unit was detailed to carry dispatches from Colonel <a href="/wiki/James_M._Strode" id="w">James M. Strode</a> in <a href="/wiki/Galena%2C_Illinois" id="w">Galena</a> to General <a href="/wiki/Henry_Atkinson" id="w">Henry Atkinson</a> at <a href="/wiki/Dixon%26%2339%3Bs_Ferry" id="w">Dixon&#39;s Ferry</a> (present-day <a href="/wiki/Dixon%2C_Illinois" id="w">Dixon, Illinois</a>).<sup id="_ref-kett_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kett" title="">[4]</a></sup> The group of men, which included soldiers Fred Stahl, William Durley, Vincent Smith, Redding Bennett, James Smith, and mail contractor John D. Winters, left Dixon around 3 p.m. on <a href="/wiki/May_19" id="w">May 19</a>.<sup id="_ref-kett_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kett" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

The Buffalo Grove ambush occurred near <a href="/wiki/Buffalo_Grove%2C_Ogle_County%2C_Illinois" id="w">Buffalo Grove</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" id="w">Illinois</a>, a small, unincorporated settlement in present-day <a href="/wiki/Ogle_County%2C_Illinois" id="w">Ogle County</a>.<sup id="_ref-footnote_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-footnote" title="">[5]</a></sup> As the group neared the edge of the grove one of the party noted the increased chances for <a href="/wiki/Ambush" id="w">ambush</a> and suggested that the party avoid the usual route by taking a more roundabout route. The suggestion was opposed and Durley reared his horse and entered the wooded area within the grove. He had traveled only a few &#34;bounds&#34; when he was cut down by gunfire from the previously suggested ambush.<sup id="_ref-hoffman_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-hoffman" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/May_20" id="w">May 20</a> <a href="/wiki/1832" id="w">1832</a>, Sergeant Stahl returned to Dixon&#39;s Ferry with the other four survivors of the attack and reported that his party had been ambushed by a group of <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native Americans</a> the evening before on the edge of the grove.<sup id="_ref-kett_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kett" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-chronology_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-chronology" title="">[7]</a></sup> He reported that Durley was killed instantly, <a href="/wiki/Scalping" id="w">scalped</a>, and left on the spot.<sup id="_ref-smith_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-smith" title="">[8]</a></sup>  Stahl and James Smith both had bullets rip through articles of clothing but were uninjured and only Durley died in the attack.<sup id="_ref-kett_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-kett" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Aftermath" name="Aftermath"></a><h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>The events of the Buffalo Grove ambush are closely interrelated with those of the <a href="/wiki/St._Vrain_massacre" id="w">St. Vrain massacre</a>. A group of four men, including Aaron Hawley and John Fowler, both casualties of the St. Vrain massacre, was en route to Galena when they stumbled upon the body of Durley at Buffalo Grove. The group returned to Dixon&#39;s Ferry, reported their find and stayed there overnight.<sup id="_ref-stevens_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stevens" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Atkinson returned to Dixon on <a href="/wiki/May_23" id="w">May 23</a> it was with dispatches destined for <a href="/wiki/Fort_Armstrong" id="w">Fort Armstrong</a>. He ordered <a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Indian_Affairs" id="w">Indian Agent</a> <a href="/wiki/Felix_St._Vrain" id="w">Felix St. Vrain</a> to join the group that had discovered Durley&#39;s body and travel with them to Galena.<sup id="_ref-stevens_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stevens" title="">[9]</a></sup> The group left Dixon and traveled north where they found, and interred the remains of Durley at Buffalo Grove.<sup id="_ref-stevens_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-stevens" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-wisc_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-wisc" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Polo Historical Society erected a memorial to Durley on <a href="/wiki/May_19" id="w">May 19</a> <a href="/wiki/1910" id="w">1910</a>, the 78th anniversary of the attack.<sup id="_ref-marker_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-marker" title="">[11]</a></sup> At that time, Durley&#39;s remains were moved from where St. Vrain&#39;s party buried him, near where he had fallen, and interred beneath the memorial.<sup id="_ref-leeogle_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-leeogle" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-marker_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-marker" title="">[11]</a></sup> The Buffalo Grove ambush historical marker and memorial to Durley are located west of the city of <a href="/wiki/Polo%2C_Illinois" id="w">Polo, Illinois</a> along Eagle Point Road.<sup id="_ref-marker_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-marker" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
