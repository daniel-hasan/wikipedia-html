<p><i>Age of Mythology</i> focuses less on historical accuracy than the previous games by Ensemble Studios and Microsoft Games&#8212;namely, the <i><a href="/wiki/Age_of_Empires_(series)" id="w">Age of Empires series</a></i> (from which it was originally an extension of sorts)&#8212;but instead centers upon the <a href="/wiki/Mythology" id="w">myths</a> and <a href="/wiki/Legend" id="w">legends</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" id="w">Greeks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" id="w">Egyptians</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Norse_mythology" id="w">Norse</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> Its campaign follows an <a href="/wiki/Atlantis" id="w">Atlantean</a> admiral, <a href="/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Age_of_Mythology_series#Arkantos" id="w">Arkantos</a>, who is forced to travel through the lands of the three civilizations in the game, hunting for a <a href="/wiki/Cyclops" id="w">cyclops</a> who has turned <a href="/wiki/Poseidon" id="w">Poseidon</a> against Atlantis.<sup id="_ref-EuroGamerReview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EuroGamerReview" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Gameplay" name="Gameplay"></a><h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>Like many other <a href="/wiki/Real-time_strategy" id="w">real-time strategy</a> games, <i>Age of Mythology</i> is based on building towns, gathering resources, creating armies, and ultimately destroying enemy units and buildings. In this way, players are able to defeat and conquer rival towns and civilizations. Players advance their tribe through four &#34;Ages&#34;: starting in the <a href="/wiki/Archaic_period_in_Greece" id="w">Archaic Age</a>, the player may upgrade to the <a href="/wiki/Classical_Age" id="w">Classical Age</a>, the Heroic Age, and finally, the Mythic Age. Each upgrade to a higher Age unlocks new units and technologies for the player, which strengthens their settlement. Conversely, upgrading requires a sum of resources to be paid, and certain buildings to be built.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup>  </p>

<div class="thumbcaption">In this screenshot, an Egyptian town under attack by the Norse, defending itself using the meteor god power.</div>
There are three playable civilizations in <i>Age of Mythology</i>: the Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse. Each civilization has three &#34;<a href="/wiki/List_of_Major_Gods_in_Age_of_Mythology_and_The_Titans" id="w">major gods</a>&#34;&#8212;deities; they are: <a href="/wiki/Zeus" id="w">Zeus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hades" id="w">Hades</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poseidon" id="w">Poseidon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Isis" id="w">Isis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ra" id="w">Ra</a>, <a href="/wiki/Set" id="w">Set</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thor" id="w">Thor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Odin" id="w">Odin</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Loki" id="w">Loki</a>. The player chooses their major god before the game begins. Every time a player advances to the next age, a &#34;<a href="/wiki/List_of_Minor_Gods_in_Age_of_Mythology_and_The_Titans" id="w">minor god</a>&#34; is selected. Minor gods are slightly less significant historically than their major counterparts. Some minor gods include <a href="/wiki/Bast_(mythology)" id="w">Bast</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aphrodite" id="w">Aphrodite</a>.<sup id="_ref-gamershell_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamershell" title="">[8]</a></sup> All gods grant to the player unique technologies, myth units, and a unique god power&#8212;a special ability which can either benefit the user or damage his/her opponent.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are four major resources in <i>Age of Mythology</i>: <a href="/wiki/Food" id="w">food</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wood" id="w">wood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gold" id="w">gold</a>, and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Favour">favor</a>; unlike previous games by Ensemble Studios, this game does not include the <a href="/wiki/Rock_(geology)" id="w">stone</a> resource. Resources can be used to train units, construct buildings, and research technologies, among other things. Civilian units&#8212;namely, the Greek <a href="/wiki/Villager" id="w">villagers</a>, Norse <a href="/wiki/Gatherer" id="w">gatherers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dwarf" id="w">dwarfs</a>, the Egyptian <a href="/wiki/Laborer" id="w">laborers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Fishing_boat" id="w">fishing boats</a>&#8212;are used to gather resources. <a href="/wiki/Hunt" id="w">Hunting</a> animals, gathering berries, <a href="/wiki/Harvest" id="w">harvesting</a> livestock, <a href="/wiki/Farm" id="w">farming</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Fishing" id="w">fishing</a> are all methods by which food can be gathered. Wood is gathered only by chopping down trees, and gold is gathered from either gold mines or from <a href="/wiki/Trade" id="w">trade</a>. Each civilization can purchase upgrades that increase the rate of gathering these resources. Favor is acquired in different ways by different civilizations: Greek players gain it by having villagers pray at <a href="/wiki/Temple" id="w">temples</a>; Egyptian players earn it by building <a href="/wiki/Monument" id="w">monuments</a>; and Norse players receive it by fighting or by possessing heroes.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> Resources can be exchanged at a player&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Market" id="w">market</a>.</p>

{{main}}</p>
<p>The bulk of each civilization&#39;s army is made of human soldiers. Each player has a maximum &#34;population&#34;, although the player does not start with the ability to use this entire &#34;population&#34;. Building additional houses or Town Centers&#8212;the main building in a player&#39;s town&#8212;increases the population capacity. Each unit takes up a different number of population slots: civilians take one, whilst some myth units can take up to five.<sup id="_ref-buildings_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-buildings" title="">[11]</a></sup> Most units can be upgraded, making them better at certain tasks.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Units can be classified into seven categories; <a href="/wiki/Infantry" id="w">infantry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Archer" id="w">archers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cavalry" id="w">cavalry</a>,&#8212;the three of which are broadly classified as <a href="/wiki/Human" id="w">human units</a>&#8212;<a href="/wiki/Siege" id="w">siege weaponry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Naval" id="w">naval units</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hero" id="w">heroes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mythology" id="w">myth units</a>.<sup id="_ref-gamespotreview_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gamespotreview" title="">[13]</a></sup>
The <a href="/wiki/Rock%2C_Paper%2C_Scissors" id="w">rock-paper-scissors</a> model governs most units in battle. For example, infantry do additional damage to cavalry, cavalry do additional damage to archers, and archers do additional damage to infantry. The same rock-paper-scissors formation exists in the three different types of naval units&#8212;arrow ships, siege ships, and hammer ships. Siege units are generally exempt from the rock-paper-scissors model, but are instead able to destroy <a href="/wiki/Building" id="w">buildings</a> easily, while being vulnerable to cavalry attacks. Heroes are extremely effective against myth units, which in turn do large amounts of damage against human units.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[14]</a></sup> Heroes are also able to collect <a href="/wiki/Relic" id="w">relics</a>, which grant the player additional economic or military bonuses when deposited in a player’s temple.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Buildings" name="Buildings"></a><h2>Buildings</h2>
<p>Buildings in <i>Age of Mythology</i> can generally be split into three categories; <a href="/wiki/Economy" id="w">economic buildings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Military" id="w">military buildings</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Defense_(military)" id="w">defensive structures</a>. The most important economic building is the Town Center, which is similar to the building of the same name in the <i><a href="/wiki/Age_of_Empires_(series)" id="w">Age of Empires series</a></i> games. All civilian units are trained at the Town Center, as are some technologies. Most importantly, players advance Age via the building. The Town Center provides fifteen population slots, and building additional houses will earn the player ten additional slots per house.<sup id="_ref-buildings_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-buildings" title="">[11]</a></sup> Other economic buildings include the <a href="/wiki/Farm" id="w">farm</a> and <a href="/wiki/Market" id="w">market</a>. </p>
<p>Buildings are able to research technologies and upgrades, as well as provide resources for the player.<sup id="_ref-buildings_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-buildings" title="">[11]</a></sup> All units except civilians are trained at military buildings. These buildings differ in name and usage between civilization, but all are able to train similar units. Military buildings are also used to research military specific technologies, such as armor upgrades, and attack improvements.<sup id="_ref-buildings_d" class="reference"><a href="#_note-buildings" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Wall" id="w">Walls</a> and <a href="/wiki/Guard_Tower" id="w">towers</a> are defensive structures, which are not able to train units, and are used only for the purposes of defense. They are able to research some upgrades, although these are generally only useful to the building performing the research.<sup id="_ref-buildings_e" class="reference"><a href="#_note-buildings" title="">[11]</a></sup> Another type of building available to players, is a <a href="/wiki/Monument" id="w">Wonder</a>: a grand building that represents an architectural achievement of the civilization. In certain game modes, once a player builds a wonder, a ten minute countdown begins. If the wonder is still standing after the countdown ends, the player who built the wonder wins.<sup id="_ref-buildings_f" class="reference"><a href="#_note-buildings" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Multiplayer" name="Multiplayer"></a><h2>Multiplayer</h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Multiplayer_game" id="w">Multiplayer</a> is a highly popular aspect of <i>Age of Mythology</i>. Most multiplayer games are played through <a href="/wiki/Ensemble_Studios" id="w">Ensemble Studios Online (ESO)</a>, or via a direct <a href="/wiki/Local_area_network" id="w">LAN</a> or <a href="/wiki/Internet_Protocol" id="w">IP</a> connection.</p>

<p>In multiplayer games, there are seven different game types available, all of which are provided as standard with the game:<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[17]</a></sup> <i>Supremacy</i>&#8212;the standard game mode&#8212;includes randomly generated map and all gameplay aspects; <i>Conquest</i> is similar to Supremacy, but victory is only possible by defeating all other players; in <i>Deathmatch</i> players begin the game with high resources, but the game is otherwise the same as Supremacy; in <i>Lightning</i>, the gameplay is identical to Supremacy, but the game plays at twice the normal speed; in <i>Nomad</i> mode, players start with one civilian unit, and no Town Center, and must build up on a settlement; the goal of <i>King of the Hill</i> is to control a monument in the center of the map for a set period of time; and in <i>Sudden Death</i>, a player loses if their Town Center is destroyed, and they fail to rebuild it within a set period of time.</p>
<p>Multiplayer <a href="/wiki/Tournament" id="w">tournaments</a> and <a href="/wiki/LAN" id="w">LAN</a> parties are popular throughout the world, with many players visiting to computer <a href="/wiki/Computer_gaming#Multiplayer" id="w">gaming lounges</a> to participate.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup><a class="internal" href="/wiki/Image:Age_of_Mythology_Editor.png" title="The &#39;&#39;Age of Mythology&#39;&#39; scenario editor: visible is a large statue surrounded by deep water and the &#34;rotate camera angle&#34; controls, which allow for construction of more complex custom scenarios."><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Mythology_Editor.png" alt="The &#39;&#39;Age of Mythology&#39;&#39; scenario editor: visible is a large statue surrounded by deep water and the &#34;rotate camera angle&#34; controls, which allow for construction of more complex custom scenarios." title="The &#39;&#39;Age of Mythology&#39;&#39; scenario editor: visible is a large statue surrounded by deep water and the &#34;rotate camera angle&#34; controls, which allow for construction of more complex custom scenarios." class="location-left type-thumb" />

In developing <i>Age of Mythology</i>, Ensemble Studios decided to move away from the center of the <i>Age of Empires series</i>, history, to avoid becoming stale and repetitive. This allowed them to work with new ideas and concepts.<sup id="_ref-C&VG_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-C&VG" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following the announcement of the game for September 2002,<sup id="_ref-GameZone_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameZone" title="">[28]</a></sup> a <a href="/wiki/Game_demo" id="w">trial version</a> was released.<sup id="_ref-AoMHTrial_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AoMHTrial" title="">[29]</a></sup> It contained five scenarios of the game&#39;s campaign, and two random maps.

<p><i>Age of Mythology</i> underwent a large amount of <a href="/wiki/Video_game_development" id="w">play-testing</a> during its developmental phase, as Ensemble Studios attempted to create a more balanced and competitive game than its predecessors. Greg T. Street commented that one of the reasons <i>Age of Mythology</i> became so popular was because the development team spent many hours working on the game through active testing, rather than just taking advice from a &#34;faceless drone in another building.&#34;<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>There was much debate during <i>Age of Mythology<b>s construction concerning the unbalanced nature of god powers and how to make them &#34;fair&#34; while still maintaining an element of fun in them.

It&#39;s easily one of my favorite soundtracks from this past year.&#34;  Semerad was also astonished, and appreciative, of the use of instruments such as the <a href="/wiki/Ney_flute" id="w">ney flute</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tabla" id="w">tabla</a> and <a href="/wiki/Toy_piano" id="w">toy piano</a>, all of which he said produced &#34;some innovative analog and synthesized electronic effects&#34;.  His only critique was that at times some of the background melodies were &#34;bound to a simple harmonization,&#34; and lacking any &#34;real bold or innovative purpose.&#34;<sup id="_ref-m4g_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-m4g" title="">[34]</a></sup></b></i></p>

<p><i>Age of Mythology</i> was well-received by the public, reaching an estimated one million units sold within five months of its release.<sup id="_ref-plat_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-plat" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The game was nominated for the <a href="/wiki/Academy_of_Interactive_Arts_%26amp%3B_Sciences" id="w">Academy of Interactive Arts &#38; Sciences</a>&#39; Interactive Achievement Awards for Computer Game of the Year and strategy computer game of the year.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Age of Mythology&#39;s</i> <a href="/wiki/3D_computer_graphics" id="w">graphics</a> was also praised by the majority of reviewers.  <a href="/wiki/IGN" id="w">IGN</a> reviewer Steve Butts stated that &#34;some fantastic effects and believable animations make this one a joy to watch. The differences between the armies and environments are awesome.&#34; As such, he gave the graphics a rating of 9 out of 10.<sup id="_ref-IGNSummary_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNSummary" title="">[42]</a></sup>  Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/GameSpot" id="w">GameSpot</a> reviewer <a href="/wiki/Greg_Kasavin" id="w">Greg Kasavin</a> also rated the graphics 9 out of 10, stating in his review that &#34;Age of Mythology is a great-looking game, filled with bright colors and carefully detailed animations.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Gamespotp3_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gamespotp3" title="">[43]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Game_Revolution" id="w">Game Revolution</a> also appreciated <i>Age of Mythology<b>s graphics, stating in their review that the &#34;new 3D landscape looks good,&#34; and including graphics as one of the positives in the review summary.<sup id="_ref-GameRevolution_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameRevolution" title="">[38]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/PC_Gamer" id="w">PC Gamer</a> reviewer William Harms admired the graphics, &#34;The environments, units, and buildings are packed with detail,&#34; and excitedly commented on the effects: &#34;What really impressed me, though, were the game’s animations. When a Minotaur smacks a dude with his club, the schmoe goes flying, skids on the ground, and then bounces back into the air.&#34;<sup id="_ref-PC Gamer review_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PC Gamer review" title="">[36]</a></sup> </b></i></p>
<p>The game&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Sound" id="w">sound</a> was also approved of by reviewers, although several commented that it was repetitive and predictable at times.  IGN in particular described it as &#34;great, if repetitive, music,&#34;<sup id="_ref-IGNSummary_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNSummary" title="">[42]</a></sup> whilst Game Revolution declared that the sound &#34;really showcases Ensemble&#39;s continued attention to detail,&#34; before going on to praise the audio snippets in various languages.<sup id="_ref-GameRevolution_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-GameRevolution" title="">[38]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IGN was particularly pleased with <i>Age of Mythology<b>s campaign, and was not bothered by its length. Instead they stated that &#34;the meaningful and engaging single player campaign provides a nearly flawless experience.&#34;<sup id="_ref-IGNSummary_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IGNSummary" title="">[42]</a></sup> However, GameSpot was slightly critical of it, claiming that &#34;while some of the campaign missions do feature some unusual circumstances or objectives that change, the game&#39;s story isn&#39;t incredibly engaging.&#34; This was compromised by stating that <i><a href="/wiki/Age_of_Empires" id="w">Age of Empires</a></i> fans wouldn&#39;t expect an amazing campaign; they would &#34;make a beeline for the game&#39;s random map mode, anyway.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Gamespotp3_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gamespotp3" title="">[43]</a></sup> PC Gamer elaborated more on the campaign however, saying: &#34;many of the missions are extremely well-crafted,&#34; and that &#34;sprinkled throughout these encounters are moments of genuine comedy — a truly delightful surprise.&#34; However, they still found reasons to criticize: &#34;Regrettably, most of AoM’s missions suffer from one recurring, frustrating problem: a severe case of “build base-itis.&#34; The reviewer elaborated: &#34;I know base-building is inherent to the genre, but even the most ardent fan will be put off by just how much there is. What’s most disappointing is that AoM’s setting really lends itself to imaginative mission design — and I don’t think the designers took full advantage of the backdrop, which is a shame.&#34;<sup id="_ref-PC Gamer review_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-PC Gamer review" title="">[36]</a></sup></b></i></p>
<p>Review comments were generally positive, with only minor issues concerning repetitiveness or length.
Overall, the opinions of reviewers seem to have been summed up by Greg Kasavin, when in his review summary he stated: &#34;Of course, what&#39;s most important is that Age of Mythology plays remarkably well. Featuring lots of interesting, inventive design decisions, plenty of fun-to-use units, and tons of variety, Age of Mythology is the last real-time strategy game you&#39;ll need for a long time.&#34;<sup id="_ref-Gamespotp3_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gamespotp3" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Use_in_scientific_studies" name="Use_in_scientific_studies"></a><h2>Use in scientific studies</h2>
<p><i>Age of Mythology&#39;s</i> <a href="/wiki/AI" id="w">AI</a> was used by four <a href="/wiki/Austria" id="w">Austrian</a> researchers&#8212;Christoph Hermann, Helmuth Melcher, Stefan Rank, and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Trappl" id="w">Robert Trappl</a>&#8212;in a study into the value of emotions in <a href="/wiki/Real-time_strategy" id="w">real-time strategy</a> games. According to the abstract, &#34;We were interested whether incorporating a simple emotional model to an existing bot-script improves playing strength.&#34;<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup> The results of the study determined that of the four bots they tested, the <a href="/wiki/Neurotic" id="w">neurotic</a> bot was most capable of defeating <i>Age of Mythology<b>s default AI, followed by the <a href="/wiki/Aggression" id="w">aggressive</a> one. Neither bot was defeated by the standard AI, but the neurotic bot won, on average, twenty five percent more rapidly.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> Plans were made to extend the research in the future by pitting the neurotic bot against a human player.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></b></i></p>
