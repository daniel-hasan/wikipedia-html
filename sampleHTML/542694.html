<p>In 1853 the first family settled in the area, and in the next 15 years the settlement grew quickly when another 88 families followed.  The original settlement was called <b>York Mills</b> but on <a href="/wiki/15_October" id="w">15 October</a> 1879, it was renamed Bancroft by Senator <a href="/wiki/Billa_Flint" id="w">Billa Flint</a> after the maiden name of his wife Phoebe.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The town was once a centre for <a href="/wiki/Uranium_mining" id="w">uranium mining</a>, and the closing of the <a href="/wiki/Madawaska_mine" id="w">Madawaska mine</a> caused some economic hardship.</p>

Located in Ontario&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Haliburton_Hills" id="w">Haliburton Hills</a>, part of the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_Shield" id="w">Canadian Shield</a>, Bancroft is well known in Canada as an excellent location for <a href="/wiki/Rockhounding" id="w">rockhounding</a>.  Bancroft styles itself as the &#34;mineral capital of Canada&#34; and holds an annual event in August called the <i>Rockhound Gemboree</i>.</p>
<p>There is also a Mineral Museum in Bancroft dedicated to the area&#39;s storied <a href="/wiki/Mining" id="w">mining</a> history. There is little active mining going on today.</p>
<p>A popular location is a craggy lookout called Eagle&#39;s Nest, a short distance north of the town. This scenic cliff, with a height of over {{m to ft}}, overlooks the York River valley, the town of Bancroft, and other densely forest-covered ridges that surround it. {{m to ft}} icicles dangle from its largest and most massive cliff in the winter and conceals parts of it entirely.  It is a popular spot for mountain climbers to practice ice climbing in the winter. However, the road to the top is steep and generally impassable in the winter. Another popular location is a series of abandoned Mineral caves/mines at <a href="/wiki/Image:Egan_Chute_ON.JPG" id="w">Egan&#39;s Chute</a> on Highway 28 north-east of Bancroft. </p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Image:Egan_Chute_ON.JPG" id="w">Egan&#39;s Chute</a> lies east of the town on <a href="/wiki/Highway_28_(Ontario)" id="w">Highway 28</a>.  The chute is a small <a href="/wiki/Gorge" id="w">gorge</a> which the York River churns through, creating white water falls.</p>
<p>The local post office on Station St. services locals with lock boxes and five rural routes.</p>
<p>The lakes surrounding Bancroft are dotted with <a href="/wiki/Cottage#Cottages in North America" id="w">cottages</a>, mostly seasonally occupied.</p>
<p>Bancroft lies in a region criss-crossed with <a href="/wiki/Snowmobile" id="w">snowmobile</a> trails, making it a hub for snowmobilers in the winter months.  In the summer these trails are used by hikers and <a href="/wiki/All-terrain_vehicle" id="w">ATV</a> enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The local <a href="/wiki/Curling" id="w">curling</a> club has existed for 50 years (est. 1957), and has hosted increasingly notable <a href="/wiki/Bonspiel" id="w">bonspiels</a> - including a recent (winter 2005) Ontario Regional Men&#39;s Championship.
The town now sports one 9 hole <a href="/wiki/Golf_course" id="w">golf course</a>, and one 18 hole golf course.</p>
<a id="Arts" name="Arts"></a><h2> Arts </h2>
<p>In 2004, Bancroft won <a href="/wiki/TVOntario" id="w">TVOntario</a>&#39;s &#34;Most Talented Town in Ontario&#34; contest.  A large number of artists and artisans live in the surrounding area, and when exhibiting together in events like the &#34;Fall Studio Tour&#34; the local talent is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>The town has the Bancroft Village Playhouse <a class="externallink" href="http://www.bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca">http://www.bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca</a> - a theatre which has been hosting sold out plays and musicals since the early 1990&#39;s.</p>

<p>Bancroft lies at the intersection of two provincial highways, <a href="/wiki/Highway_28_(Ontario)" id="w">Highway 28</a> and <a href="/wiki/Highway_62_(Ontario)" id="w">Highway 62</a>.</p>
<p>Bancroft is served by a small airport, <a href="/wiki/Bancroft_Airport" id="w">Jack Brown Airport</a> (CNW3), with a 2,200 foot (670 meter) crushed gravel runway, located immediately adjoining the town.  The airport is operated by the <a href="/wiki/Bancroft_Flying_Club" id="w">Bancroft Flying Club</a> and is freely available to the general public.  Due to high terrain near both ends of the runway, pilots typically use a non-standard circuit, following the York River valley through the town for departing from runway 12 or landing on runway 30.</p>
<p>The railroad used to go through the town.  The first train from the Central Ontario Railway arrived in November 1900. The railway went through the Musclow-Greenview road and extended behind Birds Creek through a backtrail (which is now used for cyclists and fourwheeling) and continued through the town eventually going further away from the town at the &#39;Y&#39; road division. The line was closed in 1975 and subsequently removed. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Nearby <a href="/wiki/Silent_Lake_Provincial_Park" id="w">Silent Lake Provincial Park</a> provides local <a href="/wiki/Camping" id="w">camping</a> opportunities. American sportsmen fished and hunted on this private lake for 40 years before it became a park. Silent Lake has a rocky and undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. A rugged trail circles the lake, and sections of groomed ski trails have been graded for mountain biking.</p>
