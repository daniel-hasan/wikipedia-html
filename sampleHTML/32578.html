<b>Vermont</b> ({{IPAEng}}) is a <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" id="w">state</a> in the <a href="/wiki/New_England" id="w">New England</a> region of the <a href="/wiki/Northeastern_United_States" id="w">northeastern</a> <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" id="w">United States of America</a>. The state ranks 45th by total area, and 43rd by land area at 9,250&#160;square miles, and has a population of 608,827, making it the second least populous state (second only to <a href="/wiki/Wyoming" id="w">Wyoming</a>). The only New England state with no coastline along the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" id="w">Atlantic Ocean</a>, Vermont is notable for the <a href="/wiki/Green_Mountains" id="w">Green Mountains</a> in the west and <a href="/wiki/Lake_Champlain" id="w">Lake Champlain</a> in the northwest. It is bordered by <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Massachusetts</a> to the south, <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire" id="w">New Hampshire</a> to the east, <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> to the west, and the <a href="/wiki/Canadian_province" id="w">Canadian province</a> of <a href="/wiki/Quebec" id="w">Quebec</a> to the north.</p>

The west bank of the <a href="/wiki/Connecticut_River" id="w">Connecticut River</a> marks the eastern border of the state with New Hampshire (the river itself is part of New Hampshire). <a href="/wiki/Lake_Champlain" id="w">Lake Champlain</a>, the major lake in Vermont, is the sixth-largest body of fresh water in the United States and separates Vermont from New York in the northwest portion of the state. From north to south, Vermont is 159 miles (256&#160;km). Its greatest width, from east to west, is 89 miles (143&#160;km) at the Canadian border; the narrowest width is 37 miles (60&#160;km) at the Massachusetts line. The state&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Geographic_center" id="w">geographic center</a> is <a href="/wiki/Washington%2C_Vermont" id="w">Washington</a>, three miles (5&#160;km) east of <a href="/wiki/Roxbury%2C_Vermont" id="w">Roxbury</a>.</p>
<p>There are six distinct physiographic regions of  Vermont. Categorized by geological and physical attributes, they are the Northeastern Highlands, the Green Mountains, the Taconic Mountains, the Champlain Lowlands, the Valley of Vermont and the Vermont Piedmont.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The origin of the name Green Mountains (<a href="/wiki/French_language" id="w">French</a>: <i>Verts monts</i>) is uncertain. Some authorities say that they are so named because they have much more <a href="/wiki/Forestation" id="w">forestation</a> than the higher White Mountains of New Hampshire and Adirondacks of New York. Other authorities say that they are so named because of the predominance of <a href="/wiki/Mica" id="w">mica</a>-<a href="/wiki/Quartz" id="w">quartz</a>-<a href="/wiki/Chlorite" id="w">chlorite</a> <a href="/wiki/Schist" id="w">schist</a>, a green-hued metamorphosed shale.

<p>Vermont has a continental moist climate, with warm, humid summers and cold winters, which become colder at higher elevations.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> It has a <a href="/wiki/Koppen_climate_classification" id="w">Koppen climate classification</a> of Dfb, similar to Minsk, Stockholm and Fargo.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> Vermont is known for its <a href="/wiki/Mud_season" id="w">mud season</a> in spring followed by a generally mild early summer, hot Augusts and a colorful autumn, and particularly for its cold winters. The northern part of the state, including the rural northeastern section (dubbed the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Northeast_Kingdom" id="w">Northeast Kingdom</a>&#34;) is known for exceptionally cold winters, often averaging 10&#160;°<a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit" id="w">F</a> (6&#160;°<a href="/wiki/Celsius" id="w">C</a>) colder than the southern areas of the state. Annual <a href="/wiki/Snow" id="w">snowfall</a> averages between 60 to 100 inches (150&#8211;250&#160;cm) depending on elevation, giving Vermont some of New England&#39;s best cross-country and downhill <a href="/wiki/List_of_ski_areas_and_resorts_in_the_United_States#Vermont" id="w">ski areas</a>.</p>
<p>In the autumn, Vermont&#39;s hills experience an explosion of red, orange and gold foliage displayed on the <a href="/wiki/Sugar_maple" id="w">sugar maple</a> as cold weather approaches. This famous display of color that occurs so abundantly in Vermont is not due so much to the presence of a particular variant of the sugar maple; rather it is caused by a number of soil and climate conditions unique to the area.</p>
<p>The highest-recorded temperature was 105&#160;°F (41&#160;°C), at <a href="/wiki/Vernon%2C_Vermont" id="w">Vernon</a> on <a href="/wiki/July_4" id="w">July 4</a>, <a href="/wiki/1911" id="w">1911</a>; the lowest-recorded temperature was -50&#160;°F (-46&#160;°C), at <a href="/wiki/Bloomfield%2C_Vermont" id="w">Bloomfield</a> on <a href="/wiki/December_30" id="w">December 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1933" id="w">1933</a>.</p>

<a id="Prehistory_and_Precolumbian" name="Prehistory_and_Precolumbian"></a><h3> Prehistory and Precolumbian </h3>
<p>Vermont was covered with shallow seas periodically from the Cambrian to Devonian periods. Most of the sedimentary rocks laid down in these seas were deformed by mountain-building. Fossils, however, are common in the Lake Champlain region. Lower areas of western Vermont were flooded again, as part of the St. Lawrence Valley &#34;<a href="/wiki/Champlain_Sea" id="w">Champlain Sea</a>&#34; at the end of the last ice age, when the land had not yet rebounded from the weight of the glaciers. Shells of salt-water mollusks, along with the bones of beluga whales, have been found in the Lake Champlain region. </p>
<p>Little is known of the <a href="/wiki/Pre-Columbian" id="w">pre-Columbian</a> history of Vermont. The western part of the state was originally home to a small population of <a href="/wiki/Algonquian" id="w">Algonquian</a>-speaking tribes, including the <a href="/wiki/Mahican" id="w">Mohican</a> and <a href="/wiki/Abenaki" id="w">Abenaki</a> peoples. Between 8500 to 7000 BC, at the time of the Champlain Sea, <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" id="w">Native Americans</a> inhabited and hunted in Vermont. From 8th century BC to 1000 BC was the Archaic Period. During the era, Native Americans migrated year-round. From 1000 BC to AD 1600 was the Woodland Period, when villages and trade networks were established, and ceramic and <a href="/wiki/Bow_(weapon)" id="w">bow and arrow</a> technology was developed. Sometime between 1500 and 1600, the <a href="/wiki/Iroquois" id="w">Iroquois</a> drove many of the smaller native tribes out of Vermont, later using the area as a <a href="/wiki/Hunting" id="w">hunting</a> ground and warring with the remaining Abenaki. The population in 1500 is estimated to be around 10,000 people.</p>
<a id="Colonial" name="Colonial"></a><h3> Colonial </h3>
<p>The first <a href="/wiki/Europe" id="w">European</a> to see Vermont is thought to have been <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Cartier" id="w">Jacques Cartier</a>, in 1535. On <a href="/wiki/July_30" id="w">July 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/1609" id="w">1609</a>, <a href="/wiki/French_colonization_of_the_Americas" id="w">French explorer</a> <a href="/wiki/Samuel_de_Champlain" id="w">Samuel de Champlain</a> claimed the area of what is now <a href="/wiki/Lake_Champlain" id="w">Lake Champlain</a>, giving to the mountains the appellation of <i>les Monts vert</i> (the Green Mountains).  France claimed Vermont as part of <a href="/wiki/New_France" id="w">New France</a>, and erected <a href="/wiki/Fort_Sainte_Anne" id="w">Fort Sainte Anne</a> on <a href="/wiki/Isle_La_Motte%2C_Vermont" id="w">Isle La Motte</a> in 1666 as part of the <a href="/wiki/Fortification" id="w">fortification</a> of Lake Champlain. This was the first European settlement in Vermont and the site of the first <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)" id="w">Mass</a>.</p>
<p>During the latter half of the 17th century, non-French settlers began to explore Vermont and its surrounding area. In 1690, a group of <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Dutch</a>-British settlers from <a href="/wiki/Albany%2C_New_York" id="w">Albany</a> under Captain Jacobus de Warm established the De Warm Stockade at <a href="/wiki/Chimney_Point" id="w">Chimney Point</a> (eight miles or 13 km west of present-day <a href="/wiki/Addison%2C_Vermont" id="w">Addison</a>). This settlement and trading post was directly across Lake Champlain from <a href="/wiki/Crown_Point%2C_New_York" id="w">Crown Point</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a> (<i>Pointe à la Chevelure</i>).</p>
<p>In 1731, more French settlers arrived. They constructed a small temporary wooden stockade (<a href="/wiki/Fort_de_Pieux" id="w">Fort de Pieux</a>) on what was Chimney Point until work on <a href="/wiki/Fort_St._Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric" id="w">Fort St. Frédéric</a> began in 1734. The fort, when completed, gave the French control of the New France/Vermont border region in the Lake Champlain Valley and was the only permanent fort in the area until the building of Fort Carillon more than 20 years later. The government encouraged French colonization, leading to the development of small French settlements in the valley. The British attempted to take the Fort St. Frédéric four times between 1755 and 1758; in 1759, a combined force of 12,000 British regular and provincial troops under Sir <a href="/wiki/Jeffrey_Amherst%2C_1st_Baron_Amherst" id="w">Jeffrey Amherst</a> captured the fort. The French were driven out of the area and retreated to other forts along the <a href="/wiki/Richelieu_River" id="w">Richelieu River</a>. One year later a group of <a href="/wiki/Mohawk_nation" id="w">Mohawks</a> burnt the settlement to the ground, leaving only chimneys, which gave the area its name.</p>
<p>The first permanent British settlement was established in 1724, with the construction of <a href="/wiki/Fort_Dummer" id="w">Fort Dummer</a> in Vermont&#39;s far southeast under the command of <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant" id="w">Lieutenant</a> Timothy Dwight. This fort protected the nearby settlements of <a href="/wiki/Dummerston%2C_Vermont" id="w">Dummerston</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brattleboro_(town)%2C_Vermont" id="w">Brattleboro</a>. These settlements were made by the <a href="/wiki/Province_of_Massachusetts_Bay" id="w">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a> to protect its settlers on the western border along the <a href="/wiki/Connecticut_River" id="w">Connecticut River</a>. The second British settlement was the 1761 founding of <a href="/wiki/Bennington%2C_Vermont" id="w">Bennington</a> in the southwest.</p>

During the <a href="/wiki/Seven_Years_War" id="w">Seven Years War</a>, locally known as the <a href="/wiki/French_and_Indian_War" id="w">French and Indian War</a>, some Vermont settlers, including <a href="/wiki/Ethan_Allen" id="w">Ethan Allen</a>, joined the colonial militia assisting the British in attacks on the French. <a href="/wiki/Fort_Ticonderoga" id="w">Fort Carillon</a> on the <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>-Vermont border, a French fort constructed in 1755, was the site of two British offensives under Lord Amherst&#39;s command: the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Carillon" id="w">unsuccessful British attack in 1758</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Ticonderoga_(1759)" id="w">retaking of the following year</a> with no major resistance (most of the garrison had been removed to defend <a href="/wiki/Quebec" id="w">Quebec</a>, <a href="/wiki/Montreal" id="w">Montreal</a>, and the western forts). The British renamed the fort <a href="/wiki/Fort_Ticonderoga" id="w">Fort Ticonderoga</a> (which became the site of two later battles during the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" id="w">American Revolutionary War</a>).

The end of the war brought new settlers to Vermont. A fort at <a href="/wiki/Crown_Point%2C_New_York" id="w">Crown Point</a> had been built, and the Crown Point Military Road stretched from the east to the west of the Vermont wilderness from <a href="/wiki/Springfield%2C_Vermont" id="w">Springfield</a> to Chimney Point, making travel from the neighboring <a href="/wiki/13_colonies" id="w">British colonies</a> easier. Three colonies, <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" id="w">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York" id="w">New York</a>, and <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire" id="w">New Hampshire</a>, laid claim to the area. The Province of Massachusetts Bay claimed the land on the basis of the 1629 charter of the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony" id="w">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Province_of_New_York" id="w">Province of New York</a> claimed Vermont based on the early Dutch Charter to the West India Company for lands west of the <a href="/wiki/Connecticut_River" id="w">Connecticut River</a>, and the identical land granted to the Duke of York (later <a href="/wiki/James_II_of_England" id="w">King James II</a>) in 1664. The <a href="/wiki/Province_of_New_Hampshire" id="w">Province of New Hampshire</a> also claimed Vermont based upon a decree of <a href="/wiki/George_II_of_Great_Britain" id="w">George II</a> in 1740. In 1741, George II ruled that Massachusetts&#39;s claims in Vermont and New Hampshire were invalid and fixed Massachusetts&#39;s northern boundary at its present location. This still left New Hampshire and New York with conflicting claims to the land.</p>

The situation resulted in the <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire_Grants" id="w">New Hampshire Grants</a>, a series of 135 <a href="/wiki/Land_grant" id="w">land grants</a> made between 1749 and 1764 by New Hampshire&#39;s colonial governor, <a href="/wiki/Benning_Wentworth" id="w">Benning Wentworth</a>. The grants sparked a dispute with the New York governor, who began granting charters of his own for New Yorker settlement in Vermont. In 1770, Ethan Allen&#8212;along with his brothers <a href="/wiki/Ira_Allen" id="w">Ira</a> and Levi, as well as Seth Warner&#8212;recruited an informal militia, the <a href="/wiki/Green_Mountain_Boys" id="w">Green Mountain Boys</a>, to protect the interests of the original New Hampshire settlers against the new migrants from New York. When a New York judge arrived in <a href="/wiki/Westminster_(town)%2C_Vermont" id="w">Westminster</a> with New York settlers in March 1775, violence broke out as angry citizens took over the <a href="/wiki/Courthouse" id="w">courthouse</a> and called a sheriff&#39;s posse.

On <a href="/wiki/January_18" id="w">January 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1777" id="w">1777</a>, representatives of the New Hampshire Grants convened in Westminster and declared the independence of the <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Republic" id="w">Vermont</a>.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> For the first six months of the state&#39;s existence, the state was called <a href="/wiki/New_Connecticut" id="w">New Connecticut</a>, after the name of an existing state.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/June_2" id="w">June 2</a>, a second convention of 72 delegates met at Westminster, known as the &#34;Westminster Convention.&#34; At this meeting, the delegates adopted the name &#34;Vermont&#34; on the suggestion of Dr. Thomas Young of <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania" id="w">Philadelphia</a>, a supporter of the delegates who wrote a letter advising them on how to achieve admission into the newly independent United States as the 14th state. The delegates set the time for a meeting one month later. On <a href="/wiki/July_4" id="w">July 4</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Vermont_Republic" id="w">Constitution of Vermont</a> was drafted during a violent thunderstorm at the <a href="/wiki/Old_Constitution_House" id="w">Windsor Tavern</a> owned by Elijah West and was adopted by the delegates on <a href="/wiki/July_8" id="w">July 8</a> after four days of debate. This was among the first written constitutions in <a href="/wiki/North_America" id="w">North America</a> and was indisputably the first to abolish the institution of slavery, provide for universal manhood suffrage and require support of public schools. The Windsor tavern has been preserved as the <a href="/wiki/Old_Constitution_House" id="w">Old Constitution House</a>, administered as a <a href="/wiki/List_of_Vermont_historic_sites" id="w">state historic site</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Bennington" id="w">Battle of Bennington</a>, fought on <a href="/wiki/August_16" id="w">August 16</a>, <a href="/wiki/1777" id="w">1777</a>, was a seminal event in the history of the state of Vermont. The nascent republican government, created after years of political turmoil, faced challenges from New York, New Hampshire, Great Britain and the new United States, none of which recognized its sovereignty. The republic&#39;s ability to defeat a powerful military invader gave it a legitimacy among its scattered frontier society that would sustain it through fourteen years of fragile independence before it finally achieved statehood as the 14th state in the union in 1791.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1777, the invading British army of General <a href="/wiki/John_Burgoyne" id="w">John Burgoyne</a> slashed southward from Canada to the Hudson River, captured the strategic stronghold of Fort Ticonderoga, and drove the Continental Army into a desperate southward retreat. Raiding parties of British soldiers and native warriors freely attacked, pillaged and burned the frontier communities of the Champlain Valley and threatened all settlements to the south. The Vermont frontier collapsed in the face of the British invasion. The New Hampshire legislature, fearing an invasion from the east, mobilized the state&#39;s militia under the command of General <a href="/wiki/John_Stark" id="w">John Stark</a>.</p>
<p>General Burgoyne received intelligence that large stores of horses, food and munitions were kept at Bennington, which was the largest community in the land grant area. He dispatched 2,600 men, nearly a third of his army, to seize the colonial storehouse there, unaware that General Stark&#39;s New Hampshire troops were then traversing the Green Mountains to join up at Bennington with the Vermont continental regiments commanded by Colonel Seth Warner, together with the local Vermont and western Massachusetts militia. The combined American forces, under Stark&#39;s command, attacked the British column at <a href="/wiki/Hoosick%2C_New_York" id="w">Hoosick, New York</a>, just across the border from Bennington. General Stark reportedly challenged his men to fight to the death, telling them that: &#34;There are your enemies. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow!&#34; In a desperate, all-day battle fought in intense summer heat, the army of <a href="/wiki/Yankee" id="w">yankee</a> farmers killed or captured virtually the entire British detachment. General Burgoyne never recovered from this loss and eventually surrendered the remainder of his 6,000-man force at <a href="/wiki/Saratoga%2C_New_York" id="w">Saratoga, New York</a>, on <a href="/wiki/October_17" id="w">October 17</a>.</p>
<p>The Battles of <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Bennington" id="w">Bennington</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Saratoga" id="w">Saratoga</a> are recognized as the turning point in the Revolutionary War because they were the first major defeat of a British army and convinced the French that the Americans were worthy of military aid. Stark became widely known as the &#34;Hero of Bennington&#34;, and the anniversary of the battle is still celebrated in Vermont as a legal holiday known as &#34;Bennington Battle Day.&#34; Under the portico of the Vermont Statehouse, next to an heroic granite statue of Ethan Allen, there is a brass cannon that was captured from the British troops at the Battle of Bennington.</p>
<p>Vermont continued to govern itself as a sovereign entity based in the eastern town of Windsor for fourteen years. The Vermont Republic issued its own currency, coins and operated a statewide postal service. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Chittenden" id="w">Thomas Chittenden</a>, who came to Vermont from <a href="/wiki/Connecticut" id="w">Connecticut</a> in 1774, acted as head of state, using the term governor over president. Chittenden governed the nascent republic from 1778 to 1789 and from 1790 to 1791. Chittenden exchanged ambassadors with France, the Netherlands, and the American government then at Philadelphia. In 1791, Vermont joined the federal Union as the fourteenth state&#8211;the first state to enter the union after the original thirteen colonies, and a counterweight to slave holding <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" id="w">Kentucky</a>, which was admitted to the Union shortly afterward.</p>

<p>Vermont had a <a href="/wiki/Unicameralism" id="w">unicameral</a> legislature until 1836.</p>
<p>An 1854 <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Senate" id="w">Vermont Senate</a> report on slavery echoed the Vermont Constitution&#39;s first article, on the rights of all men, questioning how a government could favor the rights of one people over another. The report fueled growth of the abolition movement in the state, and in response, a resolution from the Georgia General Assembly authorizing the towing of Vermont out to sea. The mid to late 1850s saw a transition from Vermonters mostly favoring slavery&#39;s containment, to a far more serious opposition to the institution, producing the <a href="/wiki/Radical_Republican_(USA)" id="w">Radical Republican</a> and <a href="/wiki/Abolitionist" id="w">abolitionist</a> <a href="/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens" id="w">Thaddeus Stevens</a>. As the Whig party shriveled, and the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Republican Party</a> emerged, Vermont strongly trended in support of its candidates, first on the state level and later for the presidency. In 1860 it voted for President <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" id="w">Abraham Lincoln</a>, giving him the largest margin of victory of any state.  This strong lean toward the Republican Party has continued until very recently as evidenced by only electing two senators from other parties since the civil war (<a href="/wiki/Patrick_Leahy" id="w">Patrick Leahy</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" id="w">Democratic Party</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bernie_Sanders" id="w">Bernard Sanders</a>, an independent).</p>
<a id="The_Civil_War" name="The_Civil_War"></a><h3> The Civil War </h3>
<p>{{main}}
During the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" id="w">American Civil War</a>, Vermont sent more than 34,000 men into United States service, contributing 18 regiments of <a href="/wiki/Infantry" id="w">infantry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cavalry" id="w">cavalry</a>, 3 batteries of light <a href="/wiki/Artillery" id="w">artillery</a>, 3 companies of <a href="/wiki/Sharpshooters" id="w">sharpshooters</a>, 2 companies of <a href="/wiki/Frontier_Cavalry" id="w">frontier cavalry</a>, and thousands in the regular army and navy, and in other states’ units. Almost 5,200 Vermonters, 15%, were killed or mortally wounded in action or died of disease. Vermonters, if not Vermont units, participated in every major battle of the war.</p>
<p>Among the most famous of the Vermont units were the <a href="/wiki/1st_Vermont_Brigade" id="w">1st Vermont Brigade</a>, the <a href="/wiki/2nd_Vermont_Brigade" id="w">2nd Vermont Brigade</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/1st_Vermont_Cavalry" id="w">1st Vermont Cavalry</a>. </p>
<p>A large proportion of Vermont’s state and national-level politicians for several decades after the Civil War were veterans. </p>
<p>The northernmost land action of the war, the <a href="/wiki/St._Albans_Raid" id="w">St. Albans Raid</a>, took place in Vermont.</p>
<a id="Postbellum_era_and_beyond" name="Postbellum_era_and_beyond"></a><h3>Postbellum era and beyond</h3>
<p>The two decades following the end of the American Civil War (1864-1885) saw both economic expansion and contraction, and fairly dramatic social change. Vermont&#39;s system of railroads expanded and were linked to national systems, agricultural output and export soared and incomes increased. But Vermont also felt the effects of recessions and financial panics, particularly the <a href="/wiki/Panic_of_1873" id="w">1873 Panic</a> which resulted in a substantial exodus of young Vermonters. The transition in thinking about the rights of citizens, first brought to a head by the 1854 Vermont Senate report on slavery, and later Lincoln&#39;s Gettysburg Address in changing how citizens perceived civil rights, fueled agitation for women&#39;s suffrage. The first election in which women were allowed to vote was on <a href="/wiki/December_18" id="w">December 18</a>, <a href="/wiki/1880" id="w">1880</a>, when women were granted limited <a href="/wiki/Suffrage" id="w">suffrage</a> and were first allowed to vote in town elections, and then in state legislative races.</p>
<p>Large-scale <a href="/wiki/Flooding" id="w">flooding</a> occurred in early November 1927. During this incident, 85 people died, 84 of them in Vermont. Another flood occurred in 1973, when the flood caused the death of two people and millions of dollars in property damage.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/April_25" id="w">April 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/2000" id="w">2000</a>, as a result of the <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Supreme_Court" id="w">Vermont Supreme Court</a>&#39;s decision in <a href="/wiki/Baker_v._Vermont" id="w">Baker v. Vermont</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Vermont_General_Assembly" id="w">Vermont General Assembly</a> passed and Governor <a href="/wiki/Howard_Dean" id="w">Howard Dean</a> signed into law H.0847, which provided the state sanctioned benefits of marriage to gay and lesbian couples in the form of <a href="/wiki/Civil_unions" id="w">civil unions</a>.  Controversy over the civil unions bill was a central issue in the subsequent 2000 elections.</p>

<p>Like many of its neighboring states, Vermont&#39;s largest religious affiliation in the colonial period was <a href="/wiki/Congregationalism" id="w">Congregationalism</a>. In 1776, 63% of affiliated church members in Vermont were Congregationalists. At the time, however, most settlers were not church members because much of the land was wilderness. Only 9% of people belonged to a church at the time. The Congregational <a href="/wiki/United_Church_of_Christ" id="w">United Church of Christ</a> remains the largest Protestant denomination and Vermont has the largest percentage of this denomination of any state.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Today more than two-thirds of Vermont residents identify themselves as <a href="/wiki/Christianity" id="w">Christians</a>. The largest single religious body in the state is the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" id="w">Roman Catholic Church</a>. A Catholic Church survey in 1990 reported that 25% of Vermonters were members of the Catholic Church, although more than that self-identify as Catholics.</p>
<p>Over one-fifth of Vermonters identify themselves as non-religious, tying Vermont with Oregon as having the second-highest percentage of non-religious people in the United States. Only Washington State has a higher percentage.</p>

<a id="Agriculture" name="Agriculture"></a><h3>Agriculture</h3>
<p>Agriculture contributes $2.6 billion,<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup> about 12%, directly and indirectly to the states economy.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Over the past two centuries logging has fallen off as over-cutting and the exploitation of other forests made Vermont&#39;s forest less attractive. Loss of farms has had the beneficial effect of allowing Vermont&#39;s land and forest to recover. The accompanying lack of industry has allowed Vermont to avoid many of the ill-effects of 20th century industrial busts, effects that still plague neighboring states. Today, most of Vermont&#39;s forests consist of second-growth.</p>
<p>Of the remaining industries, <a href="/wiki/Dairy_farming" id="w">dairy farming</a> is the primary source of agricultural income.</p>
<p>In the last half of the twentienth century, developers have had plans to build <a href="/wiki/Condominium_(housing)" id="w">condos</a> and houses on what was relatively inexpensive, open land. Vermont&#39;s government has responded with a series of laws controlling development and with some pioneering initiatives to prevent the loss of Vermont&#39;s dairy industry.</p>
<p>In 1947 there were 11,206 dairy farms in the state. In 2003 there were fewer than 1,500, a decline of 80%. The number of cattle had declined by 40%. However, milk production had doubled in the same period due to tripling the production per cow.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup> In 2007, there were 1,087 farms left, down from 1,138 in 2006. While milk production rose, Vermont&#39;s market share declined. Within a group of states supplying the Boston-NYC market,<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup> Vermont was third with a 10.6% share of the market.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>An important and growing part of Vermont&#39;s economy is the manufacture and sale of artisan foods, fancy foods, and novelty items trading in part upon the Vermont &#34;brand&#34; which the state 
manages and defends. Examples of these specialty exports include <a href="/wiki/Cabot_Cheese" id="w">Cabot Cheese</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Teddy_Bear_Company" id="w">Vermont Teddy Bear Company</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fine_Paints_of_Europe" id="w">Fine Paints of Europe</a>, Vermont Butter and Cheese Company, several micro breweries, ginseng growers, <a href="/wiki/Burton_Snowboards" id="w">Burton Snowboards</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lake_Champlain_Chocolates" id="w">Lake Champlain Chocolates</a>, <a href="/wiki/King_Arthur_Flour" id="w">King Arthur Flour</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ben_%26amp%3B_Jerry%26%2339%3Bs" id="w">Ben and Jerry&#39;s Ice Cream</a>. </p>
<p>In 2001, Vermont produced 275,000 US gallons (1,040,000 L) of maple syrup, about one-quarter of U.S. production. For 2005 that number was 410,000 accounting for 37% of national production. <sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In 2000, only 3% of the state&#39;s working population was still engaged in agriculture.<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>

<a id="Manufacturing" name="Manufacturing"></a><h3>Manufacturing</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/IBM" id="w">IBM</a>, in Essex Junction, is Vermont&#39;s largest for-profit employer. It provides 25% of all manufacturing jobs in Vermont.

<a id="Housing" name="Housing"></a><h3>Housing</h3>
<p>Vermont is the 17th highest state in the nation for mortgage affordability. However, in 41 other states, inhabitants contributed within plus or minus 4% of Vermont&#39;s 18.4% of household income to a mortgage.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Housing prices did not rise that much during the early 2000s. As a result, the collapse in real estate values was not that precipitous either. While foreclosure rose significantly in 2007, the state stood 50th (last) in ratio of foreclosure filings to households.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Labor" name="Labor"></a><h3>Labor</h3>

<a id="Insurance" name="Insurance"></a><h3>Insurance</h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Captive_insurance" id="w">Captive insurance</a> plays an increasingly large role in Vermont&#39;s economy. With this form of alternative insurance, large corporations or industry associations form standalone insurance companies to insure their own risks, thereby substantially reducing their insurance premiums and gaining a significant measure of control over types of risks to be covered. There are also significant tax advantages to be gained from the formation and operation of captive insurance companies. According to the Insurance Information Institute, Vermont in 2004 was the world&#39;s third-largest domicile for captive insurance companies, following <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" id="w">Bermuda</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Cayman_Islands" id="w">Cayman Islands</a>.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>

<p>The towns of <a href="/wiki/Rutland_(town)%2C_Vermont" id="w">Rutland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barre_(town)%2C_Vermont" id="w">Barre</a> are the traditional centers of marble and granite quarrying and carving in the U.S. For many years Vermont was also the headquarters of the smallest union in the U.S., the Stonecutters Association, of about 500 members.
Up the western side of the state runs the &#34;Marble Valley&#34; joining up with the &#34;Slate Valley&#34; that runs from just inside New York across from Chimney Point until it meets the &#34;Granite Valley&#34; that runs west past Barre, home of the Rock of Ages quarry, the largest granite quarry in America.
Vermont is the largest producer of slate in the country.
Production of dimension stone is the greatest producer of revenues by quarrying.</p>
<a id="Taxes" name="Taxes"></a><h3>Taxes</h3>
<p>Vermont stands 14th highest out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for state and local taxation, with a per capita load of $3,681.

<p>Vermont collects personal <a href="/wiki/Income_tax" id="w">income tax</a> in a progressive structure of five different income brackets, ranging from 3.6% to 9.5%. </p>
<p>Vermont&#39;s general <a href="/wiki/Sales_tax" id="w">sales tax</a> rate is 6%, which is imposed on sales of tangible personal property, amusement charges, fabrication charges, some public utility charges and some service contracts (some towns impose an additional 1% Local Option Tax). There are 46 exemptions from the tax which include medical items, food, manufacturing machinery, equipment and fuel, residential fuel and electricity, clothing, and shoes. A <a href="/wiki/Use_tax" id="w">use tax</a> is imposed on the buyer at the same rate as the sales tax. The buyer pays the use tax when the sellers fails to collect the sales tax or the items are purchased from a source where no tax is collected. The use tax applies to items taxable under the sales tax. <a href="/wiki/Property_tax" id="w">Property taxes</a> are imposed for the support of education and municipal services. </p>
<p>Vermont does not assess tax on <a href="/wiki/Intangible_property" id="w">intangible</a> <a href="/wiki/Personal_property" id="w">personal property</a>. Vermont does not collect <a href="/wiki/Inheritance_taxes" id="w">inheritance taxes</a>; however, its <a href="/wiki/Estate_tax" id="w">estate tax</a> is decoupled from the federal estate tax laws and therefore the state still imposes its own estate tax.</p>

<a id="Constitutional" name="Constitutional"></a><h3>Constitutional</h3>
<a id="The_Constitution_of_the_State_of_Vermont" name="The_Constitution_of_the_State_of_Vermont"></a><h4> The Constitution of the State of Vermont </h4>
<p>Provision is made for the following &#34;frame of government&#34; under the Constitution of the State of Vermont: the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. All members of the executive and legislative branch serve two-year terms including the governor and senators. There are no <a href="/wiki/Term_limit" id="w">term limits</a> for any office.</p>
<a id="Executive_branch" name="Executive_branch"></a><h4> Executive branch </h4>

<p>The current governor of Vermont is <a href="/wiki/Jim_Douglas" id="w">Jim Douglas</a>, who assumed office in 2003. The offices of the <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Vermont" id="w">Governor of Vermont</a> are located at <a href="/wiki/The_Pavilion_(office_building)" id="w">The Pavilion</a> in <a href="/wiki/Montpelier%2C_Vermont" id="w">Montpelier</a>, the state capital.</p>
<p>Vermonters elect a state <a href="/wiki/Governor" id="w">governor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_governor" id="w">lieutenant governor</a> on separate tickets.  For example, when Republican Governor <a href="/wiki/Richard_Snelling" id="w">Richard Snelling</a> died in office in 1991, the Democratic Lieutenant Governor <a href="/wiki/Howard_Dean" id="w">Howard Dean</a> succeeded him for the remainder of that term. In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, Vermonters elect four other officials on a statewide ballot: Secretary of State, State Treasurer, <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Auditor_of_Accounts" id="w">Vermont Auditor of Accounts</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Attorney_General" id="w">Attorney General</a>.</p>
<a id="Local_government" name="Local_government"></a><h5>Local government</h5>
<p>There are three types of incorporated municipalities in Vermont, towns, cities and villages. As in the other New England states, towns are the basic unit of municipal government. Cities are independent of and equivalent to towns. Villages are included in towns but assume responsibility for some municipal services within their boundaries, usually water, sewage and sometimes local roads. Incorporated villages are not found in any of the other New England states.</p>
<p>Like most of New England, there is slight provision for autonomous county government. Counties and county seats are merely convenient repositories for various government services such as County and State Courts, with several elected officers such as a State&#39;s Attorney and Sheriff. All county services are directly funded by the State of Vermont.</p>
<a id="Legislative_branch" name="Legislative_branch"></a><h4> Legislative branch </h4>

<p>Vermont&#39;s <a href="/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)" id="w">state legislature</a> is the <a href="/wiki/Vermont_General_Assembly" id="w">Vermont General Assembly</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Bicameral_legislature" id="w">bicameral body</a> composed of the <a href="/wiki/Vermont_House_of_Representatives" id="w">Vermont House of Representatives</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Lower_house" id="w">lower house</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Senate" id="w">Vermont Senate</a> (the <a href="/wiki/Upper_house" id="w">upper house</a>) meet at the <a href="/wiki/Vermont_State_House" id="w">Vermont State House</a>. The Senate is composed of 30 state senators, while the House of Representatives has 150 members.</p>
<a id="Judicial_branch" name="Judicial_branch"></a><h4> Judicial branch </h4>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Supreme_Court" id="w">Vermont Supreme Court</a> is the state <a href="/wiki/Supreme_court" id="w">supreme court</a>, made up of five justices who serve six year terms. <a href="/wiki/Superior_court" id="w">Superior courts</a> in the state are made up of eight judges serving a term of six years. Appointments to the state supreme court, superior court, and <a href="/wiki/District_court" id="w">district courts</a> are made by the governor, from a list of names submitted by the state&#39;s <a href="/wiki/Judicial_Nominating_Committee" id="w">Judicial Nominating Committee</a> and then are confirmed by the Senate. At the end of each six year term, the General Assembly votes by <a href="/wiki/Joint_ballot" id="w">joint ballot</a> (each member, senator or representative, getting one vote) on whether to retain the judge or justice (known as a <a href="/wiki/Judicial_retention_vote" id="w">judicial retention vote</a>). Judges on lower courts are elected on a partisan ballot. The <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Constitution" id="w">Vermont Constitution</a> spells out the process of judicial appointment and retention in Chapter 2, Sections 32 through 35, 50 and 51. <sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>Vermont is one of twelve states that have no <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States" id="w">death penalty</a> statute. After 1930, there were four executions, the last two being in 1954. Capital punishment was effectively abolished in practice in 1964, with the statutes being completely removed in 1987. State law allows children as young as ten years to be tried as adults, the lowest age limit currently specified by any of the 50 states. 
The Vermont prison system is administered by Vermont Department of Corrections.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> There are about 2,200 inmates as of May 2007.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> There are nine prisons in Vermont:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Caledonia Community Work Camp</li>
<li>Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility</li>
<li>Dale Women&#39;s Facility</li>
<li>Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility</li>

<li>Southeast State Correctional Facility</li>
<li>Southern State Correctional Facility</li>
<li>St. Johnsbury Regional Correctional Facility</li>
<li>Windsor Women&#39;s Correctional Facility</li></ul>
<p>An unusual feature of Vermont Courts are two side Side Judges for county courts, who are elected as officers of the court and participate in non-legal decisions by the court, such as guilt or innocence or voting in tort cases. In addition to their judicial duties, the two Side Judges serve as administrators of the County government. They appoint the County clerk, Treasurer and Auditor, County Road commissioners, Notaries Public and care for the County Court House plus care and maintenance of any other county-owned property.</p>
<a id="Civil_rights_and_liberties" name="Civil_rights_and_liberties"></a><h4> Civil rights and liberties </h4>

<p>The Vermont Constitution outlines and guarantees broad rights for its citizens. Even in the eighteenth century it was seen as being among the most far-reaching in the new world and in Europe, and it predated the <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_Rights" id="w">Bill of Rights</a> by a dozen years. The Constitution&#39;s first chapter, &#34;Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of The State of Vermont&#34; prohibits slavery, indentured servitude, and allowed for universal suffrage for men, regardless of property ownership. The Declaration of Rights set in place broad protections of religious freedom and conscience while erecting a strong firewall between church and state by prohibiting establishment or promotion of any faith by the government or compulsion to worship. The &#34;Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of The State of Vermont&#34; is believed to have been a model for France&#39;s Déclaration universelle sur des droits de l&#39;homme (Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man).</p>
<a id="Federal_legislative_representation" name="Federal_legislative_representation"></a><h4> Federal legislative representation </h4>

<p>Vermont is represented in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" id="w">U.S. Senate</a>  by <a href="/wiki/Patrick_Leahy" id="w">Patrick Leahy</a>, a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party" id="w">Democrat</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bernie_Sanders" id="w">Bernie Sanders</a>, an independent, caucusing with the Democrats.  Vermont made history with Sanders&#39;s election as the first <a href="/wiki/Democratic_socialism" id="w">Democratic Socialist</a> to be elected to the Senate.  Sanders has served as Vermont&#39;s sole US Representative from 1991-2007 and also served as mayor of <a href="/wiki/Burlington%2C_VT" id="w">Burlington</a> (Vermont&#39;s largest city) from 1981-1988.

<a id="Political" name="Political"></a><h3> Political </h3>

<p>Vermonters are known for their political independence. Vermont is one of four states that were once independent <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Vermont" id="w">republics</a> (the others being Texas,California, and Hawaii). It has sometimes voted contrarian in national elections. Notably, Vermont is the only state to have voted for a presidential candidate from the <a href="/wiki/Anti-Masonic_Party" id="w">Anti-Masonic Party</a>, and Vermont and <a href="/wiki/Maine" id="w">Maine</a> were the only states to vote against <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" id="w">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> in his second election.</p>
<p>Vermont&#39;s unique history and history of independent political thought has led to movements for the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Vermont_Republic" id="w">Second Vermont Republic</a> and other plans advocating <a href="/wiki/Secession" id="w">secession</a>.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[54]</a></sup> In 2007, about 13% of Vermont&#39;s population supported Vermont&#39;s  withdrawal from the Republic. This is almost double the amount from 2005, which was 8%.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Vermont government maintains an interventionist stance regarding the environment, social services, and prevention of <a href="/wiki/Urbanization" id="w">urbanization</a>. Legislators have recently tended to vote liberal on social issues, and moderate to conservative on fiscal issues. {{Fact}}</p>
<p>Republicans dominated Vermont politics from the party&#39;s founding in 1854 until the mid-1970s. Prior to the 1960s, rural interests dominated the legislature. As a result, cities, particularly the older sections of Burlington and Winooski, were neglected and fell into decay. People began to move out to newer suburbs. </p>
<p>In the meantime, many people had moved in from out of state. Much of this immigration included the arrival of more liberal political influences of the urban areas of New York and New England in Vermont.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the legislature was redistricted under one-person, one-vote, it passed legislation to accommodate these new arrivals.
This legislation was the Land Use and Development Law (<a href="/wiki/Act_250_(US_law)" id="w">Act 250</a>) in 1970. The law, which was the first of its kind in the nation, created nine District Environmental Commissions consisting of private citizens, appointed by the Governor, who must approve land development and subdivision plans that would have a significant impact on the state&#39;s environment and many small communities. </p>
<p>As a result of Act 250, Vermont was the last state to get a Wal-Mart (there are four, as of November 2007, but only the Williston store was a newly-built big box). Vermont is also the last state to have a Lowe&#39;s home improvement store built (after several years of debates and deliberation over stormwater runoff from the site, a Lowe&#39;s is nearing completion of construction, and will open on <a href="/wiki/U.S._Route_7" id="w">U.S. Route 7</a> in South Burlington in <a href="/wiki/January" id="w">January</a>, <a href="/wiki/2008" id="w">2008</a>).
Even with some big-box development occurring in the more populous areas, Vermont remains the only state without a Target store (as of November 2007), and the only state without a McDonald&#39;s restaurant or big box store within the city limits of the capital. </p>
<p>Another case involves the recent controversy over the adoption of <a href="/wiki/Civil_union" id="w">civil unions</a>, an institution which grants same-sex couples nearly all the rights and privileges of <a href="/wiki/Marriage" id="w">marriage</a>. In <i><a href="/wiki/Baker_v._Vermont" id="w">Baker v. Vermont</a></i> (1999), the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that, under the <a href="/wiki/Constitution_of_Vermont" id="w">Constitution of Vermont</a>, the state must either allow <a href="/wiki/Same-sex_marriage" id="w">same-sex marriage</a> or provide a <a href="/wiki/Separate_but_equal" id="w">separate but equal</a> status for them. The state legislature chose the second option by creating the institution of <a href="/wiki/Civil_union" id="w">civil union</a>; the bill was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor <a href="/wiki/Howard_Dean" id="w">Howard Dean</a>. </p>
<p>Vermont is the home state of the only current member of the United States Congress who does not associate with a political party: <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" id="w">Senator</a> <a href="/wiki/Bernie_Sanders" id="w">Bernie Sanders</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s many <a href="/wiki/Progressivism" id="w">progressive</a> Vermont Republicans and newcomers to the state helped bolster the state&#39;s small Democratic Party. Until 1992, Vermont had supported a Democrat for president only once since the party&#39;s founding&#8212;in <a href="/wiki/Lyndon_Johnson" id="w">Lyndon Johnson</a>&#39;s 1964 landslide victory against <a href="/wiki/Barry_Goldwater" id="w">Barry Goldwater</a>. In 1992, it supported Democrat <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" id="w">Bill Clinton</a> for president and has voted for Democrats in every presidential election since. Vermont gave John Kerry his fourth-largest margin of victory in 2004. He won the state&#39;s popular vote by 20 percentage points over incumbent <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">George W. Bush</a>, taking almost 59% of the vote. <a href="/wiki/Essex_County%2C_Vermont" id="w">Essex County</a> in the state&#39;s northeastern section was the only county to vote for Bush. Vermont still remains the only state that President Bush has not visited.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, Republican Governor Douglas won all counties but Windham in the 2006 election. Vermonters are frequent ticket-splitters.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2007, when confronted with an allegedly liberal issue, assisted suicide for the terminally ill, the Democratically controlled House of Representatives rejected the measure by a vote of 82-63.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>Minor parties flourish. Rules which eliminate smaller parties from the ballot in most states do not exist in Vermont. As a result, voters often have extensive choices for general elections.</p>
<p>A political issue has been Act 60, which balances taxation for education funding. This has resulted in the town of <a href="/wiki/Killington%2C_Vermont_secession_movement" id="w">Killington</a> trying to secede from Vermont and join <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire" id="w">New Hampshire</a> due to what the locals say is an unfair tax burden.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>A movement favors separating Vermont from the U.S. or making it the 11<sup>th</sup> province of Canada.

<a id="Academies_and_grammar_schools" name="Academies_and_grammar_schools"></a><h3>Academies and grammar schools</h3>
<p>Vermont&#39;s 1777 constitution was the first in English-speaking North America to mandate public funding for universal education. This requirement was first met by elementary-level village schools with sessions held in the cooler months to accommodate farm work. Most schools educated similar numbers of girls and boys. Conditions in these schools varied, and the highest level of instruction was tenth grade. By the end of the eighteenth century, grammar schools, instructing students in English, algebra, geometry, Greek, and Latin, had been established at Bennington, Burlington, Castleton, Middlebury, Montpelier, and Windsor. These grammar schools were of a higher caliber than the smaller villages&#39; schools, and the level of education at some was equivalent to college level. </p>
<p>By the middle nineteenth century, an expansion in settlement and the population of the state, coupled with increased prosperity, brought grammar schools to all corners of Vermont. Even the most remote Northeast Kingdom had established high-school-level instruction in Brownington, Craftsbury, Danville, Hardwick, and Newport. Many of these established grammar schools and academies, though not entirely public, received funds from area town governments in exchange for education of their students. As a system of public funding for primary and secondary education took root, many of these schools became municipal public schools. Several remained private, becoming private high-school-level academies, and several become colleges; the Orange County Grammar School became <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Technical_College" id="w">Vermont Technical College</a>, the Rutland County Grammar School became <a href="/wiki/Castleton_State_College" id="w">Castleton State College</a>, the Lamoille County Grammar School became <a href="/wiki/Johnson_State_College" id="w">Johnson State College</a>, and the Addison County Grammar School became <a href="/wiki/Middlebury_College" id="w">Middlebury College</a>.</p>
<a id="Educating_teachers" name="Educating_teachers"></a><h3>Educating teachers</h3>
<p>In the 1860s a shortage of qualified teachers brought the establishment of state &#34;normal schools,&#34; a term based on the French term <i>école normale</i> – a school to train teachers. The grammar schools at Castleton, Johnson, and Randolph Center became normal schools, additional normal schools were established in Concord and Lyndonville. Additional post secondary schools instructing students to become teachers were called seminaries. While several were nominally associated with Protestant churches, none were seminaries in the sense of training ministers. These seminars also graduated teachers to staff Vermont&#39;s growing number of primary and secondary schools. </p>
<a id="The_one-room_school_house" name="The_one-room_school_house"></a><h3>The one-room school house</h3>
<p>The one-room school house, born of small multi-age rural populations, continued well into the twentieth century. Rural towns without a single central village often built two to a half-dozen school houses across their terrain. Much of this came from a lack of transportation and a need for students to return home by mid afternoon for farm chores. By 1920 all public schools, including the one-room school houses, were regulated by the state government. In the early 1930s state legislation established a review and certification program similar to accreditation. Schools were issued regulations about teacher education and curriculum. Education quality in rural areas was maintained through a program called Vermont Standard Schools. Rural school houses meeting certification requirements displayed a green and white plaque with the Vermont coat of arms and the words &#34;Vermont Standard School.&#34;</p>
<a id="Higher_education" name="Higher_education"></a><h3>Higher education</h3>
<p>During the period of the <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Republic" id="w">Vermont Republic</a> several towns on the east side of the Connecticut River were part of Vermont. This included Hanover, and Dartmouth College. Statehood brought about establishment of the Connecticut River as a natural border. Having lost Dartmouth College, Ira Allen established the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Vermont" id="w">University of Vermont</a> (UVM) in 1791 to complement the smaller college at Castleton. By the mid-twentieth century all but one of the state normal schools, and many of the seminaries, had become four-year colleges of liberal arts and sciences. Experimentation at the University of Vermont by George Perkins Marsh, and later the influence of Vermont born philosopher and educator <a href="/wiki/John_Dewey" id="w">John Dewey</a> brought about the concepts of electives and learning by doing. Today Vermont has five colleges within the <a href="/wiki/Vermont_State_Colleges" id="w">Vermont State Colleges</a> system, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Vermont" id="w">UVM</a>, fourteen other private, degree-granting colleges, including <a href="/wiki/Middlebury_College" id="w">Middlebury College</a>, a private, co-educational liberal arts college founded in 1800, <a href="/wiki/Champlain_College" id="w">Champlain College</a>, a Burlington college founded in 1878, the <a href="/wiki/Vermont_Law_School" id="w">Vermont Law School</a> at Royalton, and <a href="/wiki/Norwich_University" id="w">Norwich University</a>, the oldest private military college in the United States and birthplace of <a href="/wiki/ROTC" id="w">ROTC</a>, founded in <a href="/wiki/1819" id="w">1819</a>.</p>
