<div class="thumbcaption">Weberman&#39;s 2005 work on Dylan</div>
A.J. Weberman early took a great and abiding—perhaps obsessive—interest in the life and works of Bob Dylan, leaving college to focus on creating a <a href="/wiki/Concordance_(publishing)" id="w">word concordance</a> of Dylan&#39;s lyrics. Although a strong advocate of Dylan&#39;s importance as an artist, he is less supportive of Dylan the man, holding him to be an <a href="/wiki/Apostate" id="w">apostate</a> to &#34;<a href="/wiki/1960s#Big changes during the Sixties" id="w">the movement</a>&#34; for failing to speak out against the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" id="w">Vietnam War</a>, and maintaining that he is a longtime heroin addict and that he has been HIV positive since the late 1980&#39;s but has failed to speak out against unprotected sex.</p>
<p>Weberman&#39;s literary analysis of Dylan&#39;s work, which he has termed &#34;Dylanology, is centered around the concept that, to Dylan, many words have lesser-used meanings differing, sometimes greatly, from their common definitions. &#34;Rain&#34;, for instance, often means &#34;destruction&#34; in a Dylan song, as it does, conventionally, in poetry and fiction. </p>

<a id="Public_controversies" name="Public_controversies"></a><h1>Public controversies</h1>
<p>Weberman first came to public notoriety in the late 1960&#39;s with his controversial research method of examining and interpreting the contents of Dylan&#39;s household garbage cans (ash bins).</p>
<p>This activity raised the question of legality, but it was concluded that household trash placed on a public way has been effectively abandoned as property and is, legally, fair game. </p>
<p>Legal or no, Dylan and his friends found this methodology, along with what they regarded as Weberman&#39;s <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Haruspice">haruspice</a>-like tortured reading of meaning into discarded household items, to be an annoying and alarming invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>But even more than his garbage-sifting, it was Weberman&#39;s public hectoring of Dylan and his recruiting of like-minded individuals (styled the <i>Dylan Liberation Front</i>) to picket Dylan at home, that made Weberman such an annoying figure, both to Dylan—who physically assaulted Weberman at one point<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> &#8212; and to some of Dylan&#39;s fans.</p>
<a id="Other_pursuits" name="Other_pursuits"></a><h1>Other pursuits</h1>
<p>Weberman later applied his unusual research methods to <a href="/wiki/Richard_Nixon" id="w">Richard Nixon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norman_Mailer" id="w">Norman Mailer</a>, and other celebrities, coining the term &#34;garbology&#34; to describe his methods and writing the book <i>My Life in Garbology</i>.</p>
<p>Weberman, in a manifestation of his leftist politics, also attempted to expand his &#34;Dylan Liberation Front&#34; into a &#34;Rock Liberation Front&#34;, intended to pressure pop musicians into greater political activity. <a href="/wiki/John_Lennon" id="w">John Lennon</a> was briefly associated with this effort.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup> More recently Weberman has worked closely with the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Defense_Organization" id="w">Jewish Defense Organization</a> in opposing Nazis, the KKK, Lyndon LaRouche and far-left anti-Zionist activists.<a class="externallink" href="http://jdo.org" rel="nofollow" title="http://jdo.org">http://jdo.org</a></p>
<p>Weberman has also studied the 1963 assassination of US President <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" id="w">John F. Kennedy</a> and was employed by the late Congressman Henry Gonzalez of Texas and Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania. Weberman&#39;s book on the subject, <i>Coup D’Etat In America</i>, 
postulates the assassination as part of a <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%26%2339%3Betat" id="w">coup d&#39;etat</a> led by rogue <a href="/wiki/CIA" id="w">CIA</a> agents Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis (a contract agent) and David Christ, Head of the TSD of the CIA, angered by Kennedy&#39;s failure to remove <a href="/wiki/Fidel_Castro" id="w">Fidel Castro</a> from power. The book includes transparent overlays, as in an anatomy textbook, so that the reader can compare the faces of the tramps briefly arrested in Dallas with photos of <a href="/wiki/E._Howard_Hunt" id="w">E. Howard Hunt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frank_Sturgis" id="w">Frank Sturgis</a>. Weberman&#39;s assertion that Hunt was involved in this action led Hunt to initiate a lawsuit, later dropped.</p>
<p>Weberman, an LSD and marijuana advocate, was arrested for marijuana dealing in 2000. He pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges and served a year and a day in jail, where he worked on the <i>Dylan to English Dictionary</i> and claims to have made &#34;translations&#34; of the texts to songs by Dylan.</p>
<p>In 2005, Weberman and other well-known Yippies, including <a href="/wiki/Dana_Beal" id="w">Dana Beal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pie_Man" id="w">Pie Man</a> (Aron Kay), joined forces to turn the long-time Yippie headquarters at 9 Bleecker Street on Manhattan&#39;s Lower East Side into a counterculture museum. As of 2006, renovation of the building has been partially completed, and a charter from the New York State Board of Regents has been granted. Weberman, who is a member of the Yippie Museum&#39;s board of trustees, announced in early 2006, in a typical display of Yippie spoofery, that the museum would house an Institute for the Study of Advanced Political Protest.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.thevillager.com/villager_144/museumwillhave.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.thevillager.com/villager_144/museumwillhave.html">http://www.thevillager.com/villager_144/museumwillhave.html</a></p>
