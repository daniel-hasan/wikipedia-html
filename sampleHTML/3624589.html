<b>Saint Lidwina (Lydwine, Liduina, Lydwid, Lidwid)</b> (<a href="/wiki/April_18" id="w">April 18</a> <a href="/wiki/1380" id="w">1380</a> – <a href="/wiki/April_14" id="w">April 14</a> <a href="/wiki/1433" id="w">1433</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" id="w">Dutch</a> <a href="/wiki/Saint" id="w">saint</a>. At age 14, Lidwina was <a href="/wiki/Ice_skating" id="w">ice skating</a> when she fell and broke a rib.  She never recovered and became progressively invalid for the rest of her life.  Her biographers state that she became paralyzed except for her left hand and that great pieces of her body fell off, and that blood poured from her mouth, ears, and nose.  Saint Lidwina is thought to be one of the first known <a href="/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis" id="w">multiple sclerosis</a> patients and her fall and consequent disability are attributed to the effects of the disease.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Life_and_legend" name="Life_and_legend"></a><h1>Life and legend</h1>
<p>After her fall, Lidwina <a href="/wiki/Fasting" id="w">fasted</a> continuously and acquired fame as a healer and holy woman (although she was also looked upon as being under the influence of an evil spirit).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup>  The town officials of <a href="/wiki/Schiedam" id="w">Schiedam</a>, her hometown, promulgated a document (which has survived) that attests to her complete lack of food and sleep.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup>  At first she ate a little piece of <a href="/wiki/Apple" id="w">apple</a>, then a bit of <a href="/wiki/Date" id="w">date</a> and watered wine, then river water contaminated with salt from the tides.  The authenticating document from Schiedam also attests that Lidwina shed skin, bones, parts of her <a href="/wiki/Intestines" id="w">intestines</a>, which her parents kept in a vase and which gave off a sweet odor.  These excited so much attention that Lidwina had her mother bury them.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup>    </p>
<p>Several <a href="/wiki/Hagiographical" id="w">hagiographical</a> accounts of her life exist.  One of these states that while the soldiers of <a href="/wiki/Philip_the_Bold" id="w">Philip of Burgundy</a> were occupying Schiedam, a guard was set around her to test her fasts, which were authenticated.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It is also reported that four soldiers abused her during this occupation, claiming that Lidwina&#39;s swollen body was due to her being impregnated by the local priest rather than from her sickness.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>She died at the age of 53.</p>
<a id="Veneration" name="Veneration"></a><h1>Veneration</h1>
<p>Her grave became a place of pilgrimage after her death.  A <a href="/wiki/Chapel" id="w">chapel</a> was built in <a href="/wiki/1434" id="w">1434</a> over it. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_%C3%A0_Kempis" id="w">Thomas à Kempis</a> wrote her biography and veneration for her increased. In <a href="/wiki/1615" id="w">1615</a> her <a href="/wiki/Relics" id="w">relics</a> were taken to <a href="/wiki/Brussels" id="w">Brussels</a>, but in <a href="/wiki/1871" id="w">1871</a> they were returned to Schiedam. On March 14, 1890, <a href="/wiki/Leo_XIII" id="w">Leo XIII</a> officially <a href="/wiki/Canonization" id="w">canonized</a> her. She is the <a href="/wiki/Patron_saint" id="w">patron saint</a> of ice skaters and her feast day occurs on April 14th. <a href="/wiki/Joris-Karl_Huysmans" id="w">Joris-Karl Huysmans</a> wrote a biography of her in <a href="/wiki/1901" id="w">1901</a>.</p>
<a id="St_Lidwina_and_multiple_sclerosis" name="St_Lidwina_and_multiple_sclerosis"></a><h1>St Lidwina and multiple sclerosis</h1>
<p>Historical texts reveal that she was afflicted with a debilitating disease, sharing many characteristics with multiple sclerosis as were the age of onset, duration and course of disease. St Lidwina’s disease began soon after her fall. From that time onwards, she developed walking difficulties, headaches and violent pains in her teeth. By the age of 19, both her legs were paralysed and her vision was disturbed. Over the next 34 years, Lidwina&#39;s condition slowly deteriorated, although with apparent periods of remission, until her death at the age of 53. Together these factors suggest that a posthumous diagnosis of MS may he plausible, therefore dating MS back to the 14th century.</p>
