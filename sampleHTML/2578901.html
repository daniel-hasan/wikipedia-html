The <b>effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans</b> was catastrophic and long-lasting. As the center of <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina" id="w">Katrina</a> passed east of <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana" id="w">New Orleans</a> on <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, winds were in the Category 2 range, and tidal surge was equivalent to about a Category 3 hurricane. Though the most severe portion of Katrina missed the city, the storm surge caused more than 50 breaches in drainage canal levees and also in navigational canal levees and precipitated the worst engineering disaster in US history. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>By <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a>, eighty percent of New Orleans was flooded, with some parts under 15 feet of water. Most of the city&#39;s levees designed and built by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers" id="w">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> were breached, including the <a href="/wiki/17th_Street_Canal" id="w">17th Street Canal</a> levee, the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Canal" id="w">Industrial Canal</a> levee, and the <a href="/wiki/London_Avenue_Canal" id="w">London Avenue Canal</a> floodwall. These breaches are responsible for at least two-thirds of the flooding according to a June 2007 report by the <a href="/wiki/American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers" id="w">American Society of Civil Engineers</a>. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ninety percent of the residents of southeast <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" id="w">Louisiana</a> were evacuated in the most successful evacuation of a major urban area in the nation&#39;s history. Despite this, many remained (mainly the elderly and poor). The <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Superdome" id="w">Louisiana Superdome</a> was used as a designated &#34;refuge of last resort&#34; for those who remained in the city. The city flooded due primarily to the failure of the federally built levee system. Many who remained in their homes had to swim for their lives, wade through deep water, or remain trapped in their attics or on their rooftops.</p>
<p>The disaster had major implications for a large segment of the <a href="/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States" id="w">population</a>, <a href="/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States" id="w">economy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States" id="w">politics</a> of the entire <a href="/wiki/United_States" id="w">United States</a>. It has prompted a Congressional review of the <a href="/wiki/Army_Corps_of_Engineers" id="w">Army Corps of Engineers</a> and the near total failure of the <a href="/wiki/Flood_Control_Act_of_1965" id="w">federally built flood protection</a> system which experts agree should have protected the city&#39;s inhabitants from Katrina&#39;s surge. Katrina has also stimulated significant research in the academic community into urban planning, real estate finance, and economic issues in the wake of a natural disaster.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h1>Background</h1>
<p>New Orleans was settled on a natural high ground along the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" id="w">Mississippi River</a>. Later developments that eventually extended to nearby <a href="/wiki/Lake_Pontchartrain" id="w">Lake Pontchartrain</a> were built on fill to bring them above the average lake level. Navigable commercial waterways extended from the lake into the interior of the city to promote waterborne commerce. After the construction of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal in 1940, the state closed these waterways causing the town&#39;s water table to lower drastically. After 1965, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers" id="w">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> built a levee system around a much larger geographic footprint that included previous marshland and swamp. These factors created subsidence of up to {{convert}} in some areas due to the consolidation of the underlying organic soils.</p>
<p>A recent study by Tulane University notes that 49% of New Orleans is below sea level, with the more densely populated areas generally on higher ground. The mean (average) elevation of the city is currently between 1 and 2 feet below sea level, with some portions of the city as high as {{convert}} and others as low as {{convert}}.</p>
<p>In 1965, heavy flooding caused by <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Betsy" id="w">Hurricane Betsy</a> brought concerns regarding flooding from hurricanes to the forefront. That year Congress passed the <a href="/wiki/Flood_Control_Act_of_1965" id="w">Flood Control Act of 1965</a> which by federal mandate gave the US Army Corps of Engineers sole authority for the design and construction of the flood protection in the <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans_metropolitan_area" id="w">New Orleans metropolitan area</a>.  The local municipalities were charged with maintenance once the projects were completed.</p>
<p>When authorized, this mandate was projected to take 13 years to complete. When Katrina made landfall in 2005, the project was between 60-90% complete with a projected date of completion estimated for 2015, nearly 50 years after it first gained authorization.</p>
<p>On August 29, 2005, flood walls and levees catastrophically failed throughout the metro area. Many collapsed well below design thresholds (17th Street and London Canals). Others collapsed after a brief period of overtopping (Industrial Canal) caused by “scouring” or erosion of the earthen levee walls– an egregious design flaw. The American Society of Civil Engineers refers to the flooding of New Orleans as the worst engineering disaster in US history<a class="externallink" href="http://eng.auburn.edu/admin/marketing/seminars/2007/l-roth.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://eng.auburn.edu/admin/marketing/seminars/2007/l-roth.html">http://eng.auburn.edu/admin/marketing/seminars/2007/l-roth.html</a></p>

<p>{{main}}
The eye of Hurricane Katrina was forecast to pass to the east of New Orleans. In that event, the wind would come back from the north as the storm passed, forcing large volumes of water from <a href="/wiki/Lake_Pontchartrain" id="w">Lake Pontchartrain</a> against the levees and possibly into the city. It was also forecast that the storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain would reach 14 to 18&#160;feet (4 - 5 m), with waves reaching seven feet (2 m) above the storm surge.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a>, at 10:00 a.m. CDT, the <a href="/wiki/National_Weather_Service" id="w">National Weather Service</a> (NWS) field office in New Orleans issued <a href="/wiki/National_Weather_Service_bulletin_for_New_Orleans" id="w">a bulletin</a> predicting catastrophic damage to New Orleans and the surrounding region. Anticipated effects included, at the very least, the partial destruction of half of the well-constructed houses in the city, severe damage to most industrial buildings, rendering them inoperable, the &#34;total destruction&#34; of all wood-framed low-rise apartment buildings, all windows blowing out in high-rise office buildings, and the creation of a huge debris field of trees, telephone poles, cars, and collapsed buildings.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> Lack of clean water was predicted to &#34;make human suffering incredible by modern standards&#34;.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was also predicted that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render most of the city uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump all the water out of the city.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Evacuation_order" name="Evacuation_order"></a><h2>Evacuation order</h2>
<p>In anticipation of widespread destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina, Max Mayfield, the director of the <a href="/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center" id="w">National Hurricane Center</a>, telephoned New Orleans <a href="/wiki/Mayor" id="w">Mayor</a> <a href="/wiki/Ray_Nagin" id="w">Ray Nagin</a> on the night of <a href="/wiki/August_27" id="w">August 27</a> to express his extreme concern, and on the following day, made a video call to <a href="/wiki/U.S._President" id="w">U.S. President</a> <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" id="w">George W. Bush</a> at his farm in <a href="/wiki/Crawford%2C_Texas" id="w">Crawford, Texas</a> about the severity of the storm. </p>
<p>With the hurricane threatening the Gulf Coast, many New Orleans residents started taking precautions to secure their homes and prepare for possible evacuation on Friday the 26th and Saturday the 27th. By mid morning on the 27th, many local gas stations which were not yet out of gas had long lines. Nagin first called for a voluntary evacuation of the city at 5:00 p.m. on <a href="/wiki/August_27" id="w">August 27</a> and subsequently ordered a citywide mandatory evacuation at 9:30 a.m. on <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a>, the first such order in the city&#39;s history. In a live news conference, Mayor Nagin predicted that, &#34;the storm surge most likely will topple our levee system&#34;, and warned that oil production in the Gulf of Mexico would be shut down. President Bush made a televised appeal for residents to heed the evacuation orders, warning, &#34;We cannot stress enough the danger this hurricane poses to Gulf Coast communities.&#34;<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> Many neighboring areas and parishes also called for evacuations. By mid-afternoon, officials in <a href="/wiki/Plaquemines_Parish%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Plaquemines</a>, <a href="/wiki/St._Bernard_Parish%2C_Louisiana" id="w">St. Bernard</a>, <a href="/wiki/St._Charles_Parish%2C_Louisiana" id="w">St. Charles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lafourche_Parish%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Lafourche</a>, <a href="/wiki/Terrebonne_Parish%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Terrebonne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jefferson_Parish%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Jefferson</a>, <a href="/wiki/St._Tammany_Parish%2C_Louisiana" id="w">St. Tammany</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Washington_Parish%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Washington</a> parishes had called for voluntary or mandatory evacuations.&#34;<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Mayor Ray Nagin ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city, many remained voluntarily, which a CNN writer described as &#34;gambling with their own lives.&#34;<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Reasons were numerous, including a belief that their homes or the buildings in which they planned to stay offered sufficient protection, lack of financial resources or access to transportation, or a feeling of obligation to protect their property. These reasons were complicated by the fact that an evacuation the previous year for Ivan had resulted in the illnesses of many elderly people since cars were stalled in traffic for six to ten hours. The fact that Katrina occurred at the end of the month, before pay checks were in the hands of many was also significant.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> A &#34;refuge of last resort&#34; was designated at the <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Superdome" id="w">Louisiana Superdome</a> Beginning at noon on <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a> and running for several hours, city buses were redeployed to shuttle local residents from 12 pickup points throughout the city to the &#34;shelters of last resort.&#34;<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the time Hurricane Katrina came ashore early the next morning, approximately one million people had fled the city and its surrounding suburbs by the evening of <a href="/wiki/August_28" id="w">August 28</a>, while about 20,000 to 25,000 people remained in the city, taking shelter at the <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Superdome" id="w">Louisiana Superdome</a>, along with 550 <a href="/wiki/United_States_National_Guard" id="w">National Guard</a> troops. While supplies of <a href="/wiki/Meal%2C_Ready-to-Eat" id="w">MREs</a> (Meals ready to eat) and bottled water were available at the Superdome, Nagin told survivors to bring blankets and enough food for several days, warning that it would be a very uncomfortable place. As the elevation of the Superdome is about three feet (1&#160;m) above sea level, the forecasted storm surge was predicted to cause flooding on that site. Survivors were told to keep out of the lower levels of the structure, for fear it would be flooded.</p>
<p>The Superdome had been used as a shelter in the past, such as during 1998s <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Georges" id="w">Hurricane Georges</a>, because it was estimated to be able to withstand winds of up to 200&#160;mph (320&#160;km/h) and water levels of 35&#160;feet (10&#160;m).</p>
<p>The entire southeastern Louisiana region was declared a disaster area by the Federal Government before Hurricane Katrina made landfall, and <a href="/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency" id="w">FEMA</a> prepositioned 18 disaster medical teams, medical supplies and equipment, urban search and rescue teams along with millions of MREs, liters of water, tarpaulins, and truckloads of ice.</p>

Hurricane Katrina made its second and third landfalls in the Gulf Coast region on <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>, <a href="/wiki/2005" id="w">2005</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale" id="w">Category 3 hurricane</a>.</p>
<p>On Monday <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a> area affiliates of local television station <a href="/wiki/WDSU" id="w">WDSU</a> reported New Orleans was experiencing widespread flooding due to several Army Corps-built levee breaches, was without power, and that there were several instances of catastrophic damage in residential and business areas. Entire neighborhoods on the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain were flooded.</p>
<p>The extensive flooding stranded many residents, who remained long after Hurricane Katrina had passed. Stranded survivors dotted the tops of houses citywide. Some were trapped inside attics, unable to escape. Many people chopped their way onto their roofs with hatchets and sledge hammers, which residents had been urged to keep in their attics in case of such events since <a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Betsy" id="w">Hurricane Betsy</a>. Clean water was unavailable, and power outages were expected to last for weeks.</p>
<p>By 11:00 p.m. on <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>, Mayor Nagin described the loss of life as &#34;significant&#34; with reports of bodies floating on the water throughout the city, though primarily in the eastern portions. There was no clean water or electricity in the city, and some hotels and hospitals reported diesel fuel shortages. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_National_Guard" id="w">National Guard</a> began setting up temporary morgues in select locations.</p>

<p>Coordination of rescue efforts <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a> and <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a> were made difficult by disruption of the communications infrastructure.

In a number of cases, reporters were asked to brief public officials on the conditions in areas where information was not reaching them any other way.</p>
<p>All local television stations were disrupted. Local television stations, and newspapers, moved quickly to sister locations in nearby cities, yet New Orleans CBS-affiliate <a href="/wiki/WWL-TV" id="w">WWL-TV</a> was the only local station to remain on the air during and after the storm. Broadcasting and publishing on the Internet became an important means of distributing information to evacuees and the rest of the world.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Amateur_radio" id="w">Amateur radio</a> provided tactical and emergency communications and handled health-and-welfare enquiries.</p>
<p>By <a href="/wiki/September_4" id="w">September 4</a>, a temporary communications hub was set up at the Hyatt Hotel in downtown New Orleans.</p>

As of mid-day Monday, <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>, the eye of Hurricane Katrina passed to the east of the City subjecting it to hurricane conditions, but sparing New Orleans the worst impact. The City seemed to have escaped most of the catastrophic wind damage and heavy rain that had been predicted. Most buildings came through well structurally.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the storm surge had severely taxed the city&#39;s inadequately built levee system built by the US Army Corps of Engineers. The <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River_Gulf_Outlet" id="w">Mississippi River Gulf Outlet</a> (&#34;MR-GO&#34;) breached its levees in approximately 20 places flooding much of eastern New Orleans, nearly all of <a href="/wiki/Saint_Bernard_Parish%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Saint Bernard Parish</a> and the East Bank of <a href="/wiki/Plaquemines_Parish%2C_Louisiana" id="w">Plaquemines Parish</a>. The major <a href="/wiki/Levee" id="w">levee</a> breaches in the city included breaches at the <a href="/wiki/17th_Street_Canal" id="w">17th Street Canal</a> <a href="/wiki/Levee" id="w">levee</a>, the <a href="/wiki/London_Avenue_Canal" id="w">London Avenue Canal</a>, and the wide, navigable <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Canal" id="w">Industrial Canal</a>, which left approximately 80% of the city flooded.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[15]</a></sup> There were three major breaches at the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Canal" id="w">Industrial Canal</a>; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the <a href="/wiki/Lower_Ninth_Ward" id="w">Lower Ninth Ward</a>, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The <a href="/wiki/17th_Street_Canal" id="w">17th Street Canal</a> <a href="/wiki/Levee" id="w">levee</a> was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the <a href="/wiki/London_Avenue_Canal" id="w">London Avenue Canal</a> breached in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put the majority of the city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings was damaged by Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>In a June, 2006 report on the disaster<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20060601_ARMYCORPS_SUMM.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20060601_ARMYCORPS_SUMM.pdf">http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20060601_ARMYCORPS_SUMM.pdf</a>, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers admitted that faulty design specifications, incomplete sections and substandard construction of levee segments, contributed to the damage done to New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/01/us/01cnd-corps.html?ex=1182052800&#38;en=93ef872cf24431bc&#38;ei=5070" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/01/us/01cnd-corps.html?ex=1182052800&#38;en=93ef872cf24431bc&#38;ei=5070">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/01/us/01cnd-corps.html?ex=1182052800&#38;en=93ef872cf24431bc&#38;ei=5070</a>
A report released by the American Society of Civil Engineers in June 2007 admitted that two-thirds of the flooding in the city could have been avoided if the levees had held.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.asce.org/static/hurricane/whitehouse.cfm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.asce.org/static/hurricane/whitehouse.cfm">http://www.asce.org/static/hurricane/whitehouse.cfm</a></p>
<p>The failure of the <a href="/wiki/Flood_Control_Act_of_1965" id="w">Hurricane Protection Project of New Orleans</a> has prompted many government officials to call for hearings, committees and investigations, including a call for an 8/29 Commission <a class="externallink" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/05/AR2007020501233.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/05/AR2007020501233.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/05/AR2007020501233.html</a> to investigate both the engineering and decision-making behind the collapse of a flood protection system that should have held against Katrina&#39;s storm surge.</p>

<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_4" id="w">September 4</a>, Mayor Nagin speculated that the death toll could rise as high as ten thousand after the clean-up was completed. Some survivors and evacuees reported seeing dead bodies lying in city streets and floating in still-flooded sections, especially in the east of the city. The advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected, hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead.</p>
<p>There were six deaths confirmed at the Superdome. Four of these were from natural causes, one was the result of a drug overdose, and one was a suicide. At the Convention Center, four bodies were recovered. One out of these four is believed to be the result of a homicide.<sup id="_ref-thevenot_a" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thevenot" title="">[17]</a></sup> Body collection throughout the city began on approximately <a href="/wiki/September_9" id="w">September 9</a>.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, <a href="/wiki/Looting" id="w">looting</a>, violence, and other <a href="/wiki/Crime" id="w">criminal activity</a> became serious problems. With most of the attention of the authorities focused on rescue efforts, the security in New Orleans degraded quickly. By <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a>, <a href="/wiki/Looting" id="w">looting</a> had spread throughout the city, often in broad daylight and in the presence of police officers. &#34;The looting is out of control. The <a href="/wiki/French_Quarter" id="w">French Quarter</a> has been attacked&#34;, City Councilwoman Jackie Clarkson said. &#34;We&#39;re using exhausted, scarce police to control looting when they should be used for search and rescue while we still have people on rooftops.&#34;<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Incapacitated by the breakdown of transportation and communication, as well as overwhelmed in terms of numbers, police officers could do little to stop crime, and shopkeepers who remained behind were left to defend their property alone.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[19]</a></sup> Looters included gangs of armed gunmen, and gunfire was heard in parts of the city. Along with violent, armed robbery of non-essential valuable goods, many incidents were of residents simply gathering food, water and other essential commodities from unstaffed grocery stores. There were also reports of looting by some police officers.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[20]</a></sup> There was also significant looting reported continually in areas of the city with few, if any permanent residents, such as the Lakeview, Gentilly, and the Midcity regions.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>&#34;<a href="/wiki/Sniper" id="w">Sniper</a> fire&#34; was also reported throughout the city, targeted at rescue helicopters, relief workers, and police officers. One of the possibilities of the sniper fire was resistance to relocation or evacuation.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[22]</a></sup> </p>
<p>One report of violence involved police shooting six people on the Danziger Bridge, which carries the <a href="/wiki/Chef_Menteur_Highway" id="w">Chef Menteur Highway</a> across the industrial canal, who were reportedly attacking contractors of the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Army_Corps_of_Engineers" id="w">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> involved in the <a href="/wiki/17th_Street_Canal" id="w">17th Street Canal</a> repair.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Looting and violence was also hampering efforts to evacuate the <a href="/wiki/Tulane_University" id="w">Tulane University</a> medical center, as well. Looters in boats with guns had attempted to break into the hospital but were repelled by hospital staff. &#34;If we do not have the federal presence in New Orleans tonight at dark, it will no longer be safe to be there, hospital or no hospital&#34;, <a href="/wiki/Acadian_Ambulance" id="w">Acadian Ambulance</a> Services C.E.O. Richard Zuschlag told CNN. Several news sources reported instances of fighting, theft, rape, and even murder in the Superdome and other refuge centers.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>A significant number of initial reports of mass chaos, particularly in stories about the Superdome, were later found to be exaggerated or rumor.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[25]</a></sup> In the Superdome for example, the New Orleans sex crimes unit investigated every report of rape or atrocity and found only two verifiable incidents, both of sexual assault. The department head told reporters, &#34;&#34;I think it was urban myth. Any time you put 25,000 people under one roof, with no running water, no electricity and no information, stories get told.&#34; In a case of reported sniper fire, the &#34;sniper&#34; turned out to be the relief valve of a gas tank popping every few minutes.</p>
<p>Most of the city&#39;s 750 nuns had remained in the city during the storm. They refused to leave, even after Governor Blanco had ordered everyone left after the storm evacuated, because it would have been the only time in over 200 years that the clergy had left the city in a time of suffering. Many government officials were very concerned about their safety.

On <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>, New Orleans&#39;s 1,500-member police force was ordered to abandon search and rescue missions and turn their attention toward controlling the widespread looting. The city also ordered a mandatory curfew. Mayor Nagin called for increased federal assistance in a, &#34;desperate S.O.S.&#34;, following the city&#39;s inability to control looting and was often misquoted as declaring <a href="/wiki/Martial_law" id="w">martial law</a> in the city, despite there being no such term in Louisiana state law (a declaration of a <a href="/wiki/State_of_emergency" id="w">state of emergency</a> was instead made).<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> On the same day, Governor <a href="/wiki/Kathleen_Blanco" id="w">Kathleen Blanco</a> announced the arrival of a military presence, stating that they, &#34;[knew] how to shoot and kill and [expected that] they [would].&#34; Despite the increased law enforcement presence, crime continued to be problematic. Several armed attacks on relief helicopters, bus convoys, and police officers were reported{{Fact}}, and fires erupted around the city at stores and a chemical storage facility. By <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a>, 6,500 National Guard troops had arrived in New Orleans, and on <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a>, Blanco requested a total of 40,000 for assistance in evacuation and security efforts in Louisiana.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some concern over the availability and readiness of the Louisiana National Guard to help stabilize the security situation was questioned. Guardsman Lieutenant Colonel Pete had commented that, &#34;dozens of high water vehicles, humvees, refuelers, and generators were abroad.&#34;<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[31]</a></sup> At the time of the hurricane, approximately 3,000 members of the Guard were serving a tour of duty in Iraq. With total personnel strength of 11,000, this meant that 27% of the Louisiana National Guard was away.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[32]</a></sup> However, both the <a href="/wiki/White_House" id="w">White House</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Pentagon" id="w">the Pentagon</a> argued that the depletion of personnel and equipment did not impact the ability of the Guard to perform its mission — rather, impassable roads and flooded areas were the major factors impeding the Guardsmen from securing the situation in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Before Hurricane Katrina, the murder rate in New Orleans was ten times higher than the U.S. average. After the situation in New Orleans was brought under control, criminal activity in New Orleans dropped significantly.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>

As one of the largest structures in the city, evacuees were brought to the <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Superdome" id="w">Superdome</a> to wait out the storm or to await further evacuation. Many others made their way to the Superdome on their own, hoping to find food, water, shelter, or transport out of town. On <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>, Katrina passed over New Orleans with such force that it ripped two holes in the Superdome roof. On the evening of <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a>, Maj. Gen. Bennett C. Landreneau, of the Louisiana National Guard, said that the number of people taking shelter in the Superdome had risen to around 15,000 to 20,000 as search and rescue teams brought more people to the Superdome from areas hard-hit by the flooding.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[34]</a></sup> As conditions worsened and flood waters continued to rise, on <a href="/wiki/August_31" id="w">August 31</a>, Governor Blanco ordered that all of New Orleans, including the Superdome, be evacuated. The area outside the Superdome was flooded to a depth of three feet (1&#160;m), with a possibility of seven feet (2.3&#160;m) if the area equalized with Lake Pontchartrain. Governor Blanco had the state send in 68 school buses on Monday to begin evacuating people.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite increasingly squalid conditions, the population inside continued to grow. The situation inside the building was described as chaotic; reports of fights, rape, and filthy living conditions were widespread. At the time, as many as 100 were reported to have died in the Superdome, with most deaths resulting from heat exhaustion, but other reported incidents included an accused rapist who was beaten to death by a crowd and an apparent suicide.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> Despite these reports, though, the final official death toll was significantly less: six people inside (4 of natural causes, one overdose, and an apparent suicide) and a few more in the general area outside the stadium.<sup id="_ref-thevenot_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-thevenot" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/FEMA" id="w">FEMA</a> had announced that, in conjunction with <a href="/wiki/Greyhound_Lines" id="w">Greyhound</a>, the National Guard, and <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Transit_Authority_of_Harris_County%2C_Texas" id="w">Houston Metro</a>, the 25,000 people at the Superdome would be relocated across state lines to the <a href="/wiki/Reliant_Astrodome" id="w">Houston Astrodome</a>. The Dallas Fort Worth area were originally planned to take in evacuees but later refused to take in any more people because of people blaming pre-Katrina evacuees for an extremely rapid increase in crime. Roughly 475 buses were promised by FEMA to ferry evacuees with the entire evacuation expected to take two days.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> By <a href="/wiki/September_4" id="w">September 4</a>, the Superdome had been completely evacuated.</p>
<p>Although the Superdome suffered damage by water and wind to the overall interior and exterior structures, as well as interior damage from human waste and trash, the facility was repaired at a cost of <a href="/wiki/United_States_Dollar" id="w">$140</a> Million and ready for games by the autumn of 2006.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints" id="w">Saints&#39;</a> first game in the Superdome after Hurricane Katrina was played on <a href="/wiki/September_25" id="w">September 25</a>, <a href="/wiki/2006" id="w">2006</a> (the third <a href="/wiki/Monday_Night_Football" id="w">Monday night</a> of the regular season), resulting in a 23-3 Saints victory over the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons" id="w">Atlanta Falcons</a>.</p>

<p>Because of Hurricane Katrina, the <a href="/wiki/Ernest_N._Morial_Convention_Center" id="w">Ernest N.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/August_29" id="w">August 29</a>, as people were being turned away at the Superdome and rescues continued, rescuers began dropping people off at the Convention Center, which, at {{convert}} above sea level, easily escaped the flood. Captain MA Pfeiffer of the NOPD was quoted as saying, &#34;It was supposed to be a bus stop where they dropped people off for transportation. The problem was, the transportation never came.&#34;<sup id="_ref-washpost_haygood_b" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washpost_haygood" title="">[39]</a></sup> By the afternoon of the 29th, the crowd had grown to about 1,000 people. The convention center&#39;s president (who was there with a small group of convention center employees at this time) addressed the crowd near dark, informing them that there was no food, water, medical care, or other services. By late on the evening of the 29th, the convention center had been broken into, and evacuees began occupying the inside of the convention center.<sup id="_ref-washpost_haygood_c" class="reference"><a href="#_note-washpost_haygood" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>A contingent of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied one part of the convention center beginning <a href="/wiki/August_30" id="w">August 30</a> and remained there until <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a>, at times barricaded in their location.

Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was broken into. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface, though were later questioned.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, did not have their bodies moved or removed.</p>
<p>By <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a>, the facility, like the Superdome, was completely overwhelmed and declared unsafe and unsanitary. However, even though there were thousands of people who were evacuating at the center, along with network newscasters, pleading desperately for help on CNN, FOX, and other broadcast outlets, FEMA head <a href="/wiki/Michael_D._Brown" id="w">Michael Brown</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security" id="w">Homeland Security Secretary</a> <a href="/wiki/Michael_Chertoff" id="w">Michael Chertoff</a> both claimed to have no knowledge of the use of the Convention Center as a shelter until the afternoon of <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a>.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup></p>

<p>Expected to last only two days, the evacuation of remaining evacuees proved more difficult than rescue organizations anticipated as transportation convoys struggled with damaged infrastructure and a growing number of evacuees. By the morning of <a href="/wiki/September_1" id="w">September 1</a>, Governor Blanco reported that the number of evacuees in the Superdome was down to 2,500. However, by evening, eleven hours after evacuation efforts began, the Superdome held 10,000 more people than it did at dawn. Evacuees from across the city swelled the crowd to about 30,000, believing the arena was the best place to get a ride out of town.</p>
<p>Evacuation efforts were hastened on <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a> by the wider dispersal of evacuees among newly-opened shelters. <a href="/wiki/Louis_Armstrong_New_Orleans_International_Airport" id="w">Louis Armstrong International Airport</a> was reopened to allow flights related to relief efforts, and began to load evacuees onto planes as well.</p>

Eviction efforts escalated three days later, when door-to-door searches were conducted to advise remaining residents to leave the city. Despite this, a number of residents defied the eviction order. While initially lax in enforcing evictions, National Guard troops eventually began to remove residents by force.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup></p>

There was a concern that the prolonged flooding would lead to an outbreak of health problems for those who remained in the city. In addition to <a href="/wiki/Dehydration" id="w">dehydration</a> and <a href="/wiki/Food_poisoning" id="w">food poisoning</a>, there was also potential for the spread of <a href="/wiki/Hepatitis_A" id="w">hepatitis A</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cholera" id="w">cholera</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis" id="w">tuberculosis</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Typhoid_fever" id="w">typhoid fever</a>, all related to the growing contamination of food and drinking water supplies in the city compounded by the city&#39;s characteristic heat and stifling humidity. Survivors could also face long-term health risks due to prolonged exposure to the petrochemical tainted flood waters and mosquito-borne diseases such as <a href="/wiki/Yellow_fever" id="w">yellow fever</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malaria" id="w">malaria</a> and <a href="/wiki/West_Nile_Virus" id="w">West Nile Virus</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_2" id="w">September 2</a>, an emergency <a href="/wiki/Triage" id="w">triage</a> center was set up at the airport. A steady stream of helicopters and ambulances brought in the elderly, sick, and injured. Baggage equipment was used as gurneys to transport people from the flight line to the hospital, which was set up in the airport terminal. The scene could be described as, &#34;organized chaos&#34;, but efficient. By <a href="/wiki/September_3" id="w">September 3</a>, the situation started to stabilize. Up to 5,000 people had been <a href="/wiki/Triage" id="w">triaged</a> and fewer than 200 remained at the medical unit.</p>
<p>Hospital evacuations continued from other area hospitals that were flooded or damaged. Reports from the <a href="/wiki/Methodist" id="w">Methodist</a> Hospital indicated that people were dying of dehydration and exhaustion while the staff worked unendingly in horrendous conditions. The first floor of the hospital flooded and the dead were stacked in a second floor operating room. Patients requiring ventilators were kept alive with hand-powered resuscitation bags.</p>
<p>Among the many hospitals shut down due to destruction related to the hurricane was the public hospital serving New Orleans, <a href="/wiki/Charity_Hospital" id="w">Charity Hospital</a>, which was also the only trauma center serving that region. The destruction of the hospital&#39;s structure has forced the continued closure through 2007 as funding for a new building is sought out.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/September_6" id="w">September 6</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/E._coli" id="w">E. coli</a></i> was detected in the water supply. According to the <a href="/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention" id="w">CDC</a>, five people died from bacterial infections caused by the toxic waters. The deaths appear to have been caused by <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> bacteria, of the <a href="/wiki/Cholera" id="w">Cholera</a> family.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
