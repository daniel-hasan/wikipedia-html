<p>The <b>slate industry in Wales</b> began during the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Britain" id="w">Roman period</a> when <a href="/wiki/Slate" id="w">slate</a> was used to <a href="/wiki/Roof" id="w">roof</a> the fort at <a href="/wiki/Segontium_Roman_Fort" id="w">Segontium</a>, now <a href="/wiki/Caernarfon" id="w">Caernarfon</a>. The slate industry grew slowly until the early 18th century, then expanded rapidly until the late 19th century, at which time the most important slate producing areas were in northwest <a href="/wiki/Wales" id="w">Wales</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/Penrhyn_Quarry" id="w">Penrhyn Quarry</a> near <a href="/wiki/Bethesda%2C_Wales" id="w">Bethesda</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Dinorwic_Quarry" id="w">Dinorwic Quarry</a> near <a href="/wiki/Llanberis" id="w">Llanberis</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Nantlle_Valley" id="w">Nantlle Valley</a> quarries, and <a href="/wiki/Blaenau_Ffestiniog" id="w">Blaenau Ffestiniog</a>, where the slate was <a href="/wiki/Slate_industry" id="w">mined</a> rather than <a href="/wiki/Quarry" id="w">quarried</a>. Penrhyn and Dinorwig were the two largest slate quarries in the world, and the Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog was the largest slate mine in the world.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[1]</a></sup> Slate is mainly used for roofing, but is also produced as thicker slab for a variety of uses including flooring, worktops and <a href="/wiki/Headstone" id="w">headstones</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Up to the end of the 18th century, slate was extracted on a small scale by groups of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord, carted slate to the ports, and then shipped it to <a href="/wiki/England" id="w">England</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ireland" id="w">Ireland</a> and sometimes <a href="/wiki/France" id="w">France</a>. Towards the close of the century, the landowners began to operate the quarries themselves, on a larger scale. After the government abolished slate duty in 1831, rapid expansion was propelled by the building of <a href="/wiki/Narrow_gauge_railway" id="w">narrow gauge railways</a> to transport the slates to the ports.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Slate_industry" id="w">slate industry</a>  dominated the economy of north-west Wales during the second half of the 19th century, but was on a much smaller scale elsewhere. In 1898, a work force of 17,000 men produced half a million tons of slate. A bitter industrial dispute at the Penrhyn Quarry between 1900 and 1903 marked the beginning of its decline, and the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" id="w">First World War</a> saw a great reduction in the number of men employed in the industry. The <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" id="w">Great Depression</a> and <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" id="w">Second World War</a> led to the closure of many smaller quarries, and competition from other roofing materials, particularly <a href="/wiki/Tile" id="w">tiles</a>, resulted in the closure of most of the larger quarries in the 1960s and 1970s. Slate production continues on a much reduced scale.</p>

<p>The slate deposits of Wales belong to three geological series: <a href="/wiki/Cambrian" id="w">Cambrian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ordovician" id="w">Ordovician</a> and <a href="/wiki/Silurian" id="w">Silurian</a>. The Cambrian deposits run south-west from Conwy to near <a href="/wiki/Criccieth" id="w">Criccieth</a>; these deposits were quarried in the Penrhyn and Dinorwig quarries and in the Nantlle Valley. There are smaller outcrops elsewhere, for example on <a href="/wiki/Anglesey" id="w">Anglesey</a>. The Ordovician deposits run south-west from <a href="/wiki/Betws-y-Coed" id="w">Betws-y-Coed</a> to <a href="/wiki/Porthmadog" id="w">Porthmadog</a>; these were the deposits mined at Blaenau Ffestiniog. There is another band of Ordovician slate further south, running from Llangynnog to <a href="/wiki/Aberdyfi" id="w">Aberdyfi</a>, quarried mainly in the <a href="/wiki/Corris" id="w">Corris</a> area, with a few outcrops in south-west Wales, notably <a href="/wiki/Pembrokeshire" id="w">Pembrokeshire</a>. The Silurian deposits are mainly further east in the <a href="/wiki/River_Dee%2C_Wales" id="w">Dee</a> valley and around <a href="/wiki/Machynlleth" id="w">Machynlleth</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The virtues of slate as a building and roofing material have been recognized since the Roman period. The Roman fort at Segontium, Caernarfon, was originally roofed with tiles, but the later levels contain numerous slates, used for both roofing and flooring. The nearest deposits are about five miles (8 km) away in the Cilgwyn area, indicating that the slates were not used merely because they were available on-site.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[4]</a></sup> During the mediaeval period, there was small-scale quarrying of slate in several areas. The Cilgwyn quarry in the Nantlle Valley dates from the 12th century, and is thought to be the oldest in Wales.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[5]</a></sup> The first record of slate quarrying in the neighbourhood of the later Penrhyn Quarry was in 1413, when a rent-roll of Gwilym ap Griffith records that several of his tenants were paid 10 pence each for working 5,000 slates.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[6]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Aberllefenni_Slate_Quarry" id="w">Aberllefenni Slate Quarry</a> may have started operating as a slate mine as early as the 14th century. The earliest confirmed date of operating dates from the early 1500s when the local house Plas Aberllefenni was roofed in slates from this quarry.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Transport problems meant that the slate was usually used fairly close to the quarries. There was some transport by sea. A poem by the 15th century poet <a href="/wiki/Guto%26%2339%3Br_Glyn" id="w">Guto&#39;r Glyn</a> asks the <a href="/wiki/Dean_(religion)" id="w">Dean</a> of <a href="/wiki/Bangor%2C_Wales" id="w">Bangor</a> to send him a shipload of slates from Aberogwen, near Bangor, to <a href="/wiki/Rhuddlan" id="w">Rhuddlan</a> to roof a house at Henllan, near <a href="/wiki/Denbigh" id="w">Denbigh</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[8]</a></sup> The wreck of a wooden ship carrying finished slates was discovered in the <a href="/wiki/Menai_Strait" id="w">Menai Strait</a> and is thought to date from the 16th century. By the second half of the 16th century, there was a small export trade of slates to Ireland from ports such as <a href="/wiki/Beaumaris%2C_Anglesey" id="w">Beaumaris</a> and Caernarfon.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[9]</a></sup> Slate exports from the Penrhyn estate are recorded from 1713 when 14 shipments totalling 415,000 slates were sent to <a href="/wiki/Dublin" id="w">Dublin</a>.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[10]</a></sup> The slates were carried to the ports by pack-horses, and later by carts. This was sometimes done by women, the only female involvement in what was otherwise an exclusively male industry.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Until the late 18th century, slate was extracted from many small pits by small partnerships of local men, who did not own the capital to expand further. The quarrymen usually had to pay a rent or royalty to the landlord, though the quarrymen at Cilgwyn did not. A letter from the agent of the Penrhyn estate, John Paynter, in 1738 complains that competition from Cilgwyn was affecting the sales of Penrhyn slates. The Cilgwyn slates could be extracted more cheaply and sold at a higher price.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[12]</a></sup> Penrhyn introduced larger sizes of slate between 1730 and 1740, and gave these sizes the names which became standard. These ranged from &#34;Duchesses&#34;, the largest at 24&#160;<a href="/wiki/Inch" id="w">inches</a> by 12&#160;inches, through &#34;Countesses&#34;, &#34;Ladies&#34; and &#34;Doubles&#34; to the smallest &#34;Singles&#34;.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1831 slate duty was abolished, and this helped to produce a rapid expansion in the industry, particularly since the duty on <a href="/wiki/Tile" id="w">tiles</a> was not abolished until 1833.<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[27]</a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Ffestiniog_Railway" id="w">Ffestiniog Railway</a> line was constructed between 1833 and 1836 to transport slate from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the coastal town of Porthmadog, where it was loaded onto ships. The railway was graded so that loaded <a href="/wiki/Slate_waggon" id="w">slate waggons</a> could be run by gravity downhill all the way from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port. The empty waggons were hauled back up by horses, which travelled down in <a href="/wiki/Dandy_waggon" id="w">&#39;dandy&#39; waggons</a>. This helped expansion at the Blaenau Ffestiniog quarries,<sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[28]</a></sup> which had previously had to cart the slate to <a href="/wiki/Maentwrog" id="w">Maentwrog</a> to be loaded onto small boats and taken down the <a href="/wiki/River_Dwyryd" id="w">River Dwyryd</a> to the estuary, where it was transferred to larger vessels.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[29]</a></sup> There was further expansion at Blaenau when J.

<p><a href="/wiki/Mechanization" id="w">Mechanization</a> was gradually introduced to make most aspects of the industry more efficient, particularly at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the Ordovician slate was less brittle than the Cambrian slate further north, and therefore easier to work by machine. The slate mill evolved between 1840 and 1860, powered by a single <a href="/wiki/Line_shaft" id="w">line shaft</a> running along the building and bringing together operations such as sawing, planing and dressing.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[36]</a></sup> In 1859, J. W. Greaves invented the Greaves sawing table to produce blocks for the splitter, then in 1856 introduced a rotary machine to dress the split slate.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[37]</a></sup> The splitting of the blocks to produce roofing slates proved resistant to mechanization, and continued to be done with a mallet and chisel. An extra source of income from the 1860s was the production of &#34;slab&#34;, thicker pieces of slate which were planed and used for many purposes, for example flooring, tombstones and <a href="/wiki/Billiards_table" id="w">billiard tables</a>.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>The larger quarries could be highly profitable. The <i>Mining Journal</i> estimated in 1859 that the Penrhyn quarries produced an annual <a href="/wiki/Net_profit" id="w">net profit</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" id="w">GB£100</a>,000, and the Dinorwig Quarry £70,000 a year.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[39]</a></sup> From 1860 onwards slate prices rose steadily. Quarries expanded and the population of the quarrying districts increased, for example the population of Ffestiniog parish increased from 732 in 1801 to 11,274 in 1881.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[40]</a></sup> Total Welsh production reached 350,000&#160;tons a year by the end of the 1860s. Of this total, over 100,000&#160;tons came from the Bethesda area, mainly from the Penrhyn Quarry. Blaenau Ffestiniog produced almost as much, and the Dinorwig Quarry alone produced 80,000&#160;tons per year. The Nantlle Valley quarries produced 40,000&#160;tons, while the remainder of Wales outside these areas produced only about 20,000&#160;tons per year.<sup id="_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#_note-41" title="">[41]</a></sup> By the late 1870s, Wales was producing 450,000&#160;tons of slate per year, compared with just over 50,000&#160;tons for the rest of the United Kingdom, which then included Ireland.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[42]</a></sup> In 1882, 92% of the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" id="w">United Kingdom</a>&#39;s production was from Wales with the quarries at Penrhyn and Dinorwig producing half of this between them. Alun Richards comments on the importance of the slate industry:</p>
<p>{{cquote}}</p>
<p>The prosperity of the slate industry led to the growth of a number of other associated industries. <a href="/wiki/Shipbuilding" id="w">Shipbuilding</a> increased at a number of coastal locations, particularly at Porthmadog, where 201 ships were built between 1836 and 1880.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[43]</a></sup> Engineering companies were set up to supply the quarries, notably <a href="/wiki/De_Winton" id="w">De Winton</a> at Caernarfon. In 1870, De Winton built and equipped an entire workshop for the Dinorwig Quarry, with machinery powered by overhead shafting that in its turn was driven by the largest <a href="/wiki/Water_wheel" id="w">water-wheel</a> in the United Kingdom, over 50&#160;<a href="/wiki/Foot_(unit_of_length)" id="w">feet</a> in diameter.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Workers" name="Workers"></a><h2>Workers</h2>

<p>There were several different categories of worker in the quarries. The quarrymen proper, who made up just over 50% of the workforce, worked the slate in partnerships of three, four, six or eight, known as &#34;bargain gangs&#34;.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[45]</a></sup> A gang of four typically consisted of two &#34;rockmen&#34; who would blast the rock to produce blocks, a splitter, who would split the blocks with hammer and chisel, and a dresser. A <i>rybelwr</i> would usually be a boy learning his trade, who would wander around the galleries offering assistance to the gangs. Sometimes a gang would give him a block of slate to split. Other groups were the &#34;bad rockmen&#34; who usually worked in crews of three, removing unworkable rock from the face, and the &#34;rubbish men&#34; who cleared the waste rock from the galleries and built the tips of waste which surrounded the quarry.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[46]</a></sup> One ton of saleable slate could produce up to 30&#160;tons of waste.</p>

</p>
<p>The bad rockmen and rubbish men were usually paid by the ton of material removed, but the quarrymen were paid according to a more complicated system. Part of the payment was determined by the number of slates the gang produced, but this could vary greatly according to the nature of the rock in the section allocated to them. The men would therefore be paid an extra sum of &#34;poundage&#34; per pound&#39;s worth of slate produced. &#34;Bargains&#34; were let by the setting steward, who would agree a price for a certain area of rock. If the rock in the bargain allocated to a gang was poor, they would be paid a higher poundage, while good rock meant a lower poundage.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[47]</a></sup> The first Monday of every month was &#34;bargain letting day&#34; when these agreements were made between men and management. The men had to pay for their ropes and chains, for tools and for services such as sharpening and repairing. Subs (advances) were paid every week, everything being settled up on the &#34;day of the big pay&#34;. If conditions had not been good, the men could end up owing the management money. This system was not finally abolished until after the Second World War.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because of this arrangement, the men tended to see themselves as independent contractors rather than employees on a wage, and <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" id="w">trade unions</a> were slow to develop. There were grievances however, including unfairness in setting bargains and disputes over days off. The North Wales Quarrymen&#39;s Union (NWQMU) was formed in 1874, and the same year there were disputes at Dinorwig and then at Penrhyn. Both these disputes ended in victory for the workers, and by May 1878, the union had 8,368 members.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[49]</a></sup> One of the founders of the union, Morgan Richards, described in 1876 the conditions when he started work in the quarries forty years before:</p>

</p>
<p>In 1879, a period of twenty years of almost uninterrupted growth came to an end, and the slate industry was hit by a <a href="/wiki/Recession" id="w">recession</a> which lasted until the 1890s.<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[50]</a></sup> Management responded by tightening rules and making it more difficult for the men to take time off. <a href="/wiki/Labor_relations" id="w">Labour relations</a> were worsened by differences in language, religion and politics between the two sides. The owners and top managers at most of the quarries were English-speaking, <a href="/wiki/Anglicanism" id="w">Anglican</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tory" id="w">Tory</a>, while the quarrymen were <a href="/wiki/Welsh_language" id="w">Welsh-speaking</a> and mainly <a href="/wiki/Nonconformism" id="w">Nonconformist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)" id="w">Liberal</a>. Negotiations between the two sides usually involved the use of interpreters.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[51]</a></sup> In October 1885, there was a dispute at Dinorwig over the curtailing of holidays which led to a <a href="/wiki/Lockout_(industry)" id="w">lock-out</a> lasting until February 1886.<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[52]</a></sup> At the Penrhyn Quarry, <a href="/wiki/George_Sholto_Gordon_Douglas-Pennant%2C_2nd_Baron_Penrhyn" id="w">George Sholto Gordon Douglas-Pennant</a> took over from his father <a href="/wiki/Edward_Gordon_Douglas-Pennant%2C_1st_Baron_Penrhyn" id="w">Edward Gordon Douglas-Pennant</a> in 1885, and in 1886 appointed E. A. Young as chief manager.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[53]</a></sup> A more stringent management regime was introduced, and relations with the workforce deteriorated. This culminated in the suspension of 57 members of the union committee and 17 other men in September 1896, leading to a <a href="/wiki/Strike_action" id="w">strike</a> which lasted eleven months. The men were eventually obliged to go back to work, essentially on the management&#39;s terms, in August 1897.

</p>
<p>There was an upturn in trade in 1892, heralding another period of growth in the industry. This growth was mainly at Blaenau Ffestiniog and in the Nantlle Valley, where the workforce at Penyrorsedd reached 450.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[55]</a></sup> Slate production in Wales peaked at over half a million tons in 1898, with 17,000 men employed in the industry.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[56]</a></sup> A second lock-out or strike<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[57]</a></sup> at the Penrhyn Quarry began on <a href="/wiki/22_November" id="w">22 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1900" id="w">1900</a> and lasted for three years. The causes of the dispute were complex, but included the extension of a system of contracting out parts of the quarry. The quarrymen, instead of arranging their own bargains, would find themselves working for a contractor.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[58]</a></sup> The union&#39;s funds for <a href="/wiki/Strike_pay" id="w">strike pay</a> were inadequate, and there was a great deal of hardship among the 2,800 workers. Lord Penrhyn reopened the quarry in June 1901, and about 500 men returned to work, to be castigated as &#34;traitors&#34; by the remainder. Eventually the workers were forced to return to work in November 1903 on terms laid down by Lord Penrhyn. Many of the men considered to have been prominent in the union were not re-employed, and many of those who had left the area to seek work elsewhere did not return. The dispute left a lasting legacy of bitterness in the Bethesda area.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<a id="Decline_in_production" name="Decline_in_production"></a><h2>Decline in production</h2>

<p>The loss of production at Penrhyn led to a temporary shortage of slates and kept prices high, but part of the shortfall was made up by imports. French exports of slate to the UK increased from 40,000&#160;tons in 1898 to 105,000&#160;tons in 1902.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[60]</a></sup> After 1903 there was a depression in the slate industry which led to reductions in pay and job losses. New techniques in tile manufacture had reduced costs, making tiles more competitive.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[61]</a></sup> Eight Ffestiniog quarries closed between 1908 and 1913, and the Oakley dismissed 350 men in 1909.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[62]</a></sup> R.

<p>The First World War hit the slate industry badly, particularly in Blaenau Ffestiniog where exports to <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" id="w">Germany</a> had been an important source of income. Cilgwyn, the oldest quarry in Wales, closed in 1914, though it later reopened. In 1917, slate quarrying was declared a non-essential industry and a number of quarries were closed for the remainder of the war.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[63]</a></sup> The demand for new houses after the end of the war brought back a measure of prosperity; in the slate mines of Blaenau Ffestiniog production was almost back to 1913 levels by 1927, but in the quarries the output was still well below the pre-war level.<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[64]</a></sup> The Great Depression in the 1930s led to cuts in production, with exports particularly hard hit.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>The quarries and mines made increasing use of mechanization from the turn of the century, with <a href="/wiki/Electricity" id="w">electricity</a> replacing steam and water as a power source. The Llechwedd Quarry introduced its first electrical plant in 1891, and in 1906, a <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" id="w">hydro-electric</a> plant was opened in Cwm Dyli, on the lower slopes of <a href="/wiki/Snowdon" id="w">Snowdon</a>, which supplied electricity to the largest quarries in the area.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[66]</a></sup> The use of electric saws and other machinery reduced the hard manual labour involved in extracting the slate, but produced much more slate dust than the old manual methods, leading to an increased incidence of <a href="/wiki/Silicosis" id="w">silicosis</a>.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[67]</a></sup> The work was also dangerous in other ways, with the blasting operations responsible for many deaths.

<p>The outbreak of World War II in 1939 led to a severe drop in trade.

<p>The Welsh slate industry was essentially a Welsh-speaking industry. Most of the workforce in the main slate-producing areas of North Wales were drawn from the local area, with little immigration from outside Wales. The industry had a considerable influence on the culture of the area and on that of Wales as a whole. The <i>caban</i>, the cabin where the quarrymen gathered for their lunch break, was often the scene of wide-ranging discussions, which were often formally minuted. A surviving set of <a href="/wiki/Minutes" id="w">minutes</a> from a <i>caban</i> at the Llechwedd mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog for 1908–10 records discussions on <a href="/wiki/Disestablishmentarianism" id="w">Church Disestablishment</a>, <a href="/wiki/Protectionism" id="w">tariff reform</a> and other political topics.<sup id="_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#_note-86" title="">[86]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Eisteddfod" id="w">Eisteddfodau</a> were held, poetry composed and discussed and most of the larger quarries had their own <a href="/wiki/Brass_band" id="w">band</a>, with the Oakley band particularly famous. Burn calculates that there are around fifty men judged worthy of an entry in the <i>Dictionary of Welsh Biography</i> who started their working lives as slate quarrymen, compared to only four owners, though obviously there was also a distinct disparity in the numbers of the two groups.<sup id="_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#_note-87" title="">[87]</a></sup> </p>
<p>A number of <a href="/wiki/Welsh_literature" id="w">Welsh writers</a> have drawn on the lives of the quarrymen for their material, for example the novels of T. Rowland Hughes. <i>Chwalfa</i>, translated into English as <i>Out of their night</i> (1954), has the Penrhyn Quarry dispute as a background, while <i>Y cychwyn</i>, translated as <i>The beginning</i> (1969), follows the <a href="/wiki/Apprenticeship" id="w">apprenticeship</a> of a young quarryman. Several novels by <a href="/wiki/Kate_Roberts" id="w">Kate Roberts</a>, the daughter of a quarryman, give a picture of the area around Rhosgadfan, where the slate industry was on a smaller scale and many of the quarrymen were also smallholders. Her novel <i><a href="/wiki/Traed_mewn_cyffion" id="w">Traed mewn cyffion</a></i> (1936), translated as <i>Feet in chains</i> (2002), gives a vivid picture of the struggles of a quarrying family in the period between 1880 and 1914. <i>Y Chwarelwr</i> (&#34;The Quarryman&#34;) produced in 1935 was the first Welsh-language film. It showed various aspects of a slate quarryman&#39;s life at Blaenau Ffestiniog.<sup id="_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#_note-88" title="">[88]</a></sup></p>
