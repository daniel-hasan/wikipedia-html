<p>In <a href="/wiki/Game_theory" id="w">game theory</a>, a player&#39;s <b>strategy</b>, in a <a href="/wiki/Glossary_of_game_theory" id="w">game</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Economic" id="w">business</a> situation, is a complete plan of action for whatever situation might arise; this fully determines the player&#39;s behaviour. A player&#39;s strategy will determine the action the player will take at any stage of the game, for every possible history of play up to that stage.</p>
<p>A <b>strategy profile</b> is a set of strategies for each player which fully specifies all actions in a game. A strategy profile must include one and only one strategy for every player.</p>
<p>The <b>strategy</b> concept is sometimes (wrongly) confused with that of a <b>move</b>. A <b>move</b> is an action taken by a player at some point during the play of a game (e.g., in chess, moving white&#39;s Bishop a2 to b3). A <b>strategy</b> on the other hand is a complete <a href="/wiki/Algorithm" id="w">algorithm</a> for playing the game, implicitly listing all moves and counter-moves for every possible situation throughout the game. The number of &#34;moves&#34; in a <a href="/wiki/Tic_Tac_Toe" id="w">Tic Tac Toe</a> game is 4 or 5, depending on whether you start or not, and considering that neither player can skip a turn; while the actual number of &#34;strategies&#34; is over 6 trillion.</p>

<p>A <b><a href="/wiki/Pure_strategy" id="w">pure strategy</a></b> provides a complete definition in which way a player may play a game. In particular, it defines every possible choice a player might have to make, which option the player picks. A player&#39;s <b>strategy space</b> is the set of pure strategies available to that player.</p>
<p>A <b><a href="/wiki/Mixed_strategy" id="w">mixed strategy</a></b> is an assignment of a <a href="/wiki/Probability" id="w">probability</a> to each pure strategy. It defines a probability over the strategies, and reflects that, rather than choosing a particular pure strategy, the player will randomly select a pure strategy based on the distribution given by their mixed strategy. Of course, every pure strategy is a mixed strategy which selects that particular pure strategy with probability <i>1</i> and every other one with probability <i>0</i>.</p>

<a id="Tit_for_Tat" name="Tit_for_Tat"></a><h2> Tit for Tat </h2>

<p>Strategies in <a href="/wiki/Game_theory" id="w">game theory</a> are of essential importance, since the <a href="/wiki/Prisoners_dilemma" id="w">prisoners dilemma</a> was shown never to lead to cooperation unless multiperiod strategies are considered. 
A highly effective strategy is &#34;<a href="/wiki/Tit_for_Tat" id="w">Tit for Tat</a>&#34;. It was found in a programming contest, with several algorithms competing for the highest utility score.</p>
<a id="Roulette" name="Roulette"></a><h2>Roulette</h2>
<p>There is a variety of betting strategies and tactics in the <a href="/wiki/Roulette" id="w">Roulette</a> game.
The most famous strategy is the doubling strategy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set 1€</li>
<li>If you lose: double your bet</li>
<li>Repeat 2. until you have a profit</li></ol>
<p>This was originally called the &#34;<a href="/wiki/Martingale_(roulette_system)" id="w">Martingale</a> strategy&#34;, and was formalized simply to show why it will not create an <a href="/wiki/Expected" id="w">expected</a> profit. However, it is a common strategy seen in many casinos, especially by beginning players who are sometimes called &#34;system players&#34;. The typical <a href="/wiki/Casino" id="w">casino</a> prefers the &#34;system player&#34; to other types of player because the casino&#39;s risk is very low (they stand to lose only the amount of the minimum bet each time the player starts), but their potential reward is extremely high (the entire <a href="/wiki/Capital" id="w">capital</a> of the gambler). However, most &#34;system players&#34; tend to play only for a short time, and so the casino&#39;s edge is not compounded as often against the system player as against the usual roulette players (who vary their bet size less).</p>
<a id="Hedging" name="Hedging"></a><h2> Hedging </h2>

<p><a href="/wiki/Hedge_(finance)" id="w">Hedging</a> is a strategy for financial investments, that searches for the lowest risk or optimal risk to performance ratio. Some kind of hedges are uniquely determined from simple parameters. The <a href="/wiki/Black-Scholes_equation" id="w">Black-Scholes equation</a> demonstrates how a continuous stock buy and selling strategy can replicate an <a href="/wiki/Option_(finance)" id="w">option</a> without risk.</p>
